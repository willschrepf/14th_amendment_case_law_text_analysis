Duffy, Judge).                  We lack\n\n23   jurisdiction over the claims for damages but hold that the class\n\n24   claims for injunctive and declaratory relief are not moot because\n\n25   they fall within the exception for claims capable of repetition,\n\n26   yet evading review.

The complaint, brought under 42 U.S.C. §\n\n12   1983, sought declaratory and injunctive relief compelling the\n\n13   Department of Correctional Services (“DOCS”) to alter its\n\n14   practices and procedures so as to enhance the protection of the\n\n15   class from sexual assault, abuse, and harassment.            The complaint\n\n16   also asserted individual claims for damages.           The dismissal was\n\n17   based on the grounds that some of the claims of named plaintiffs\n\n18   were moot and that the remaining named plaintiffs had failed to\n\n19   exhaust available remedies as required by the Prison Litigation\n\n20   Reform Act of 1995 (“PLRA”).        Appellees are individual line\n\n21   officers (“line officer appellees”), various superintendents and\n\n22   supervisors of certain New York State prisons, and DOCS officials\n\n23   (“supervisory appellees”).1\n\n\n           1\n             The supervisory appellees include DOCS Superintendents Anginell\n     Andrews, Roberta Coward, Dennis Crowley, Alexandreena Dixon, Elaine Lord,\n     Ronald Moscicki and Melvin Williams; DOCS Deputy Superintendent Donald Wolff;\n     DOCS Director of Personnel Terry Baxter; DOCS Inspector General Richard Roy;\n     DOCS Director of the Sex Crimes Unit of the Inspector General’s Office Barbara\n     D. Leon; DOCS Director of the Bureau of Labor Relations Peter Brown; Office\n     of Mental Health Commissioner James Stone; and DOCS Commissioner Glenn S.\n                                           4\n\f 1         A prior panel held that we have appellate jurisdiction over\n\n 2   the claims for injunctive and declaratory relief pursuant to 28\n\n 3   U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1).      Amador v. Superintendents of Dep’t Corr.\n\n 4   Servs., No. 08-2079-pr (2d Cir. June 25, 2008).           We hold that we\n\n 5   lack pendent appellate jurisdiction over the damages claims.              We\n\n 6   also hold that the claims for injunctive and declaratory relief\n\n 7   by appellants who are now free but were in DOCS custody when they\n\n 8   brought suit are not moot.       Applying a relation-back theory, we\n\n 9   hold that appellants’ class claims are capable of repetition, yet\n\n10   evading review.     We conclude that three appellants have exhausted\n\n11   applicable internal prison grievance proceedings while the\n\n12   remaining ten have not.       We vacate the judgment in part and\n\n13   remand for further proceedings.\n\n14\n\n15\n\n\n     Goord. Deputy Superintendent Donald Wolff has been sued only for damages.\n     Several of these individuals may no longer be holding the named positions, but\n     their successors are automatically substituted under Federal Rule of Appellate\n     Procedure 43(c)(2). The line officer appellees include Charles Davis, Michael\n     Evans, John E. Gilbert III, Rick Laru, Rico Meyers, and Jeffrey Shawver. The\n     line officer appellees respond to damages claims by appellants Corilynn Rock,\n     Kristina Muehleisen, Laura Pullen, Nakia Thompson, Tanya Jones, Stacie\n     Calloway, Hope Susoh, Latasha Dockery, and Tonie Coggins.\n           We do not address appellants’ arguments with respect to its claims\n     against the Commissioner of the Office of Mental Health (“OMH”). The\n     supervisory appellees state, without contradiction, that the district court’s\n     decision could not have addressed the appellants’ claims against the OMH as\n     neither their motion to dismiss nor their opposition to appellants’ motion to\n     reconsider purported to address appellants’ claims against the OMH.\n     Accordingly, our disposition of this appeal does not encompass this claim and\n     is rendered without prejudice to either parties’ arguments with respect to\n     that claim on remand.\n\n                                           5\n\f 1                               BACKGROUND\n\n 2   a) The Complaint\n\n 3        Appellants’ complaint seeks redress as individuals and as a\n\n 4   class for alleged sexual abuse and harassment in violation of\n\n 5   rights secured by the First, Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth\n\n 6   Amendments pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983.   The class is described\n\n 7   as “all present and future women prisoners in DOCS custody.”\n\n 8   Compl. at 67, Amador v. Superintendents of Dep’t of Corr. Servs.,\n\n 9   No. 03 Civ. 0650(KTD) (GWG) (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 14, 2003).   It alleges\n\n10   that the approximately 3000 women prisoners in DOCS custody are\n\n11   at any time subject to a substantial and unreasonable risk of\n\n12   sexual abuse or harassment as a result of DOCS policies and\n\n13   procedures.   These policies and practices, alleged to present\n\n14   common issues of law and fact, include the adequacy of DOCS’:\n\n15   (i) screening, assigning, training, and supervising male staff,\n\n16   and the staff at large, regarding sexual misconduct; (ii)\n\n17   reporting and investigatory mechanisms for sexual misconduct; and\n\n18   (iii) investigating and responding to complaints of sexual\n\n19   misconduct.   On behalf of the class, the complaint sought\n\n20   injunctive and declaratory relief from the supervisory appellees,\n\n21   who were alleged to have been aware of the abuse and to have\n\n22   failed to take appropriate preventive measures.   Appellants also\n\n23   asserted individual claims for damages with respect to certain\n\n                                      6\n\f 1   line officers and one DOCS superintendent for their roles in\n\n 2   alleged sexual assault, abuse, and harassment of several\n\n 3   appellants while they were in DOCS custody.           The conduct alleged\n\n 4   ranges from unwelcome touching and invasions of privacy to\n\n 5   assault and rape.2     More details of the allegations are provided\n\n 6   as relevant infra.\n\n 7   b) Procedural History\n\n 8         Each of the appellants was in DOCS custody when the\n\n 9   complaint was filed on January 28, 2003.          A motion for class\n\n10   certification was filed six months later, followed by an amended\n\n11   complaint adding the claims of two new inmates, Stephanie Dawson\n\n12   and Shantelle Smith.      Shortly thereafter, appellees filed various\n\n13   motions to dismiss.\n\n14         On September 13, 2005, the district court granted the\n\n15   motions in part, dismissing five plaintiffs’ injunctive claims on\n\n16   the ground that they lacked standing because they had been\n\n17   released from prison before joining the amended complaint.              Two\n\n18   of these plaintiffs, Corilynn Rock and Laura Pullen, now appeal.\n\n19   The district court also converted defendants’ motion to dismiss\n\n20   to one for summary judgment on the limited issue of exhaustion\n\n21   and reserved judgment on the motion for class certification.              See\n\n\n\n           2\n             Women entrusted to the custody of DOCS are deemed incapable of consent\n     to sexual advances. See N.Y. Penal Law § 130.05(3)(e).\n                                           7\n\f 1   Amador v. Superintendents of Dep’t of Corr. Servs., No. 03 Civ.\n\n 2   0650 (KTD)(GWG), 2005 WL 2234050 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 13, 2005).\n\n 3        On December 4, 2007, the district court granted the motion\n\n 4   for summary judgment.   See Amador v. Superintendents of Dep’t of\n\n 5   Corr. Servs., No. 03 Civ. 0650 (KTD)(GWG), 2007 WL 4326747\n\n 6   (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 4, 2007).   It dismissed as moot the injunctive\n\n 7   claims of Stephanie Dawson and Shantelle Smith because they had\n\n 8   been released from prison while the motion for class\n\n 9   certification was pending.   The district court then dismissed for\n\n10   failure to exhaust, the claims of Stacie Calloway, Tonie Coggins,\n\n11   Latasha Dockery, Tanya Jones, Kristina Muhleisen, Denise\n\n12   Saffioti, Hope Susoh, and Nakia Thompson.   Finally, the district\n\n13   court dismissed the injunctive claims of Shenyell Smith against\n\n14   the supervisory appellees on the ground that she failed to\n\n15   identify any defendant other than the officer who was alleged to\n\n16   have sexually assaulted her.   Having dismissed all the claims\n\n17   against the supervisory appellees for mootness or failure to\n\n18   exhaust, the district court concluded that class certification\n\n19   was not warranted.   The district court dismissed all claims for\n\n20   damages save those of Shenyell Smith against Officer Delroy\n\n21   Thorpe.   Id.\n\n22        On plaintiffs’ motion for reconsideration, the district\n\n23   court amended its order without explanation, to, among other\n\n                                      8\n\f 1   things, reinstate the claims for damages by certain plaintiffs:\n\n 2   Lucy Amador against Michael Galbreath and Robert Smith; Bette\n\n 3   Jean McDonald against John E. Gilbert III, Mario Pinque and\n\n 4   Donald Wolff; Jeanette Perez against Sergeant Smith, Chris\n\n 5   Sterling, and Pete Zawislak; Stephanie Dawson against Federick\n\n 6   Brenyah; and Shantelle Smith against James Hudson.\n\n 7        This appeal followed.\n\n 8                                 DISCUSSION\n\n 9            We review a district court’s grant of summary judgment de\n\n10   novo, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the non-\n\n11   moving party.    Brownell v. Krom, 446 F.3d 305, 310 (2d Cir.\n\n12   2006).    Whether a plaintiff has exhausted administrative remedies\n\n13   under the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a), is\n\n14   also a question reviewed de novo, see Johnson v. Rowley, 569 F.3d\n\n15   40, 44 (2d Cir. 2009), as are questions of mootness.    White River\n\n16   Amusement Pub., Inc. v. Town of Hartford, 481 F.3d 163, 167 (2d\n\n17   Cir. 2007); Comer v. Cisneros, 37 F.3d 775, 787 (2d Cir. 1994).\n\n18   a) Jurisdiction Over The Damages Claims\n\n19        We have appellate jurisdiction over non-final orders of the\n\n20   district courts’ “granting, continuing, modifying, refusing or\n\n21   dissolving injunctions, or refusing to dissolve or modify\n\n22   injunctions.”    28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1).   A prior panel concluded\n\n23   that appellate jurisdiction should be exercised over appellants’\n\n                                        9\n\f 1   injunctive claims because the district court’s denial of that\n\n 2   relief “might have serious, perhaps irreparable consequence” and\n\n 3   “can be effectually challenged only by direct appeal” prior to\n\n 4   the entry of final judgment.   See Amador, No. 08-2079-pr (2d Cir.\n\n 5   June 25, 2008) (quoting Sahu v. Union Carbide Corp., 475 F.3d\n\n 6   465, 467 (2d Cir. 2007)).\n\n 7        Appellants ask that we exercise pendent jurisdiction to\n\n 8   review the interlocutory orders dismissing some of their\n\n 9   individual claims for damages.   They argue that our review of the\n\n10   district court decision dismissing the injunctive claims entails\n\n11   resolution of the same issue as the dismissed damages claims:\n\n12   whether appellants satisfied the PLRA’s exhaustion requirements.\n\n13   See, e.g., Lamar Adver. of Pa., LLC v. Town of Orchard Park, 356\n\n14   F.3d 365, 371-72 (2d Cir. 2004); Stolt-Nielsen SA v. Celanese AG,\n\n15   430 F.3d 567, 576 (2d Cir. 2005).\n\n16        “[W]here our jurisdiction is properly founded upon the\n\n17   district court’s ruling on a preliminary injunction under 28\n\n18   U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1), our review extends to all matters\n\n19   inextricably bound up with the preliminary injunction.”     Lamar\n\n20   Adver. of Pa., LLC, 356 F.3d at 371 (internal quotations omitted\n\n21   and modifications incorporated).      Section 1292(a)(1), however,\n\n22   provides only a “narrowly tailored exception” to the final\n\n23   judgment rule and its “policy against piecemeal appellate\n\n                                      10\n\f 1   review.”   Cuomo v. Barr, 7 F.3d 17, 19 (2d Cir. 1993).    To be\n\n 2   “inextricably intertwined” requires, for example, that review of\n\n 3   “the otherwise unappealable issue is necessary to ensure\n\n 4   meaningful review of the appealable one.”    Britt v. Garcia, 457\n\n 5   F.3d 264, 273 (2d Cir. 2006) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n 6   No such necessity exists here.   Although prisoners seeking\n\n 7   injunctive relief and those seeking damages are each required by\n\n 8   the PLRA to exhaust internal grievance procedures, see generally\n\n 9   Booth v. Churner, 532 U.S. 731 (2001), the overlap in legal\n\n10   issues is at a very high level of generality.    A resolution of\n\n11   the dispute over exhaustion of the damages claims would not\n\n12   necessarily overlap with the resolution concerning exhaustion\n\n13   with regard to injunctive relief.     There is, therefore, an\n\n14   insufficient basis for us to justify the application of an\n\n15   exception to an exception, i.e., the exercise of jurisdiction\n\n16   over claims pendent to a claim reviewable only as an exception to\n\n17   the final order rule.   Under these circumstances, a measure of\n\n18   self-restraint is desirable, particularly because appellants’\n\n19   proffered justification for pendent jurisdiction does not\n\n20   distinguish them from most litigants seeking both injunctive\n\n21   relief and damages.\n\n22\n\n23\n\n                                      11\n\f 1   b) Exhaustion and the Grievance Procedure\n\n 2        The PLRA provides in pertinent part:\n\n 3        No action shall be brought with respect to prison\n 4        conditions under section 1983 of this title, or\n 5        any other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in\n 6        any jail, prison, or other correctional facility\n 7        until such administrative remedies as are\n 8        available are exhausted.\n 9\n10   42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a).\n11\n12        The purpose of the PLRA is “to reduce the quantity and\n\n13   improve the quality of prisoner suits . . . [and to afford]\n\n14   corrections officials time and opportunity to address complaints\n\n15   internally before allowing the initiation of a federal case.”\n\n16   Abney v. McGinnis, 380 F.3d 663, 667 (2d Cir. 2004) (quoting\n\n17   Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516, 524-25 (2002)) (modifications in\n\n18   original).   Section 1997e(a) requires “proper exhaustion” -– that\n\n19   is, “using all steps that the agency holds out, and doing so\n\n20   properly.”     Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 90 (2006) (quoting Pozo\n\n21   v. McCaughtry, 286 F.3d 1022, 1024 (7th Cir. 2002)) (emphasis\n\n22   omitted).    This entails both “complet[ing] the administrative\n\n23   review process in accordance with the applicable procedural\n\n24   rules,” Woodford, 548 U.S. at 88, and providing the “level of\n\n25   detail necessary in a grievance to comply with the grievance\n\n26   procedures.”     Jones v. Bock, 549 U.S. 199, 218 (2007); see also\n\n27   Espinal v. Goord, 558 F.3d 119, 124 (2d Cir. 2009).    Exhaustion\n\n28   is mandatory –- unexhausted claims may not be pursued in federal\n                                       12\n\f 1   court.      See Johnson, 569 F.3d at 45 (citing Jones, 549 U.S. at\n\n 2   211).\n\n 3           We turn now to the various written materials concerning New\n\n 4   York’s Inmate Grievance Procedure3 (“IGP”) and to various\n\n 5   practices that have developed under it.          We discuss the\n\n 6   application of the procedure and practices to appellants infra.\n\n 7   The IGP defines a grievance as “a complaint about the substance\n\n 8   or application of any written or unwritten policy, regulation,\n\n 9   procedure or rule of the [DOCS] or any of its program units, or\n\n10   the lack of a policy, regulation, procedure or rule.”            N.Y.C.R.R.\n\n11   § 701.2(a) (1994); cf. N.Y.C.R.R. § 701.2(a) (2006) (“[A]\n\n12   complaint, filed with an IGP clerk, about the substance or\n\n13   application of any written or unwritten policy, regulation,\n\n14   procedure or rule . . . or the lack [thereof]”).           The pertinent\n\n15   IGP provides a three step process for the handling of such\n\n16   complaints.\n\n             3\n             First established in 1976 pursuant to New York Corrections Law § 139,\n     the Inmate Grievance Program (“IGP”) has undergone a series of revisions and\n     modifications. See Espinal v. Goord, 558 F.3d 119, 125 (2d Cir. 2009) (noting\n     minor revisions in 2006); Hemphill v. New York, 380 F.3d 680, 685-86 (2d Cir.\n     2004) (noting minor revisions in 2004); Patterson v. Smith, 53 N.Y.2d 98, 101-\n     02 (1981). DOCS’ policies and procedures for the IGP are set forth in Part 7\n     of Title 7 of the New York Compilation of Codes, Rules and Regulations, and\n     are mirrored with minor refinements in DOCS Policy and Procedure Manual\n     Directive Number 4040. See N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 7, (“N.Y.C.R.R.”)\n     § 701.1 et seq; New York Department of Correctional Services Directive No.\n     4040 (1998) (“Directive No. 4040\"). The complaint described incidents that\n     occurred between 1999 and 2003. Accordingly, the relevant regulations are\n     those that were in effect before the 2004 and 2006 revisions. See Espinal,\n     558 F.3d at 125 (noting that the relevant regulations were those in effect\n     when the prisoner filed the grievances at issue).\n\n                                          13\n\f 1        To initiate the process, an inmate must file a written\n\n 2   complaint with the Inmate Grievance Resolution Committee\n\n 3   (“IGRC”), a facility committee composed of inmates and appointed\n\n 4   staff members.   See N.Y.C.R.R. § 701.4-.5.   The complaint must\n\n 5   “contain a concise, specific description of the problem and the\n\n 6   action requested.”    N.Y.C.R.R. § 701.7(a)(1)(i) (1998) (now\n\n 7   codified as amended at N.Y.C.R.R. § 701.5(a)(2) (2007)).   Second,\n\n 8   the inmate can appeal an unfavorable IGRC determination to the\n\n 9   superintendent of the facility.    See N.Y.C.R.R. § 701.7(b) (1998)\n\n10   (now codified as amended and renumbered at N.Y.C.R.R. § 701.5(c)\n\n11   (2007)).    Finally, an inmate can appeal an unfavorable\n\n12   superintendent’s determination to the Central Office Review\n\n13   Committee (“CORC”).   See N.Y.C.R.R. § 701.7(c) (1998) (now\n\n14   codified as amended and renumbered at N.Y.C.R.R. § 701.5(d)\n\n15   (2007)); Directive No. 4040.\n\n16        This scheme specifically contemplates challenges to DOCS\n\n17   policies and procedures.   For example, when a grievance involves\n\n18   “changes in policy,” the IGRC is required to submit a\n\n19   recommendation to the superintendent, which, if accepted, can be\n\n20   appealed.   N.Y.C.R.R. § 701.7(a)(4)(vi) (1998) (now codified as\n\n21   amended and renumbered at N.Y.C.R.R. § 701.5(b)(3)(ii) (2007)).\n\n22   Of particular importance to the proceeding before us is the\n\n23   provision that only those inmates who are affected by a policy or\n\n                                       14\n\f 1   procedure, or lack thereof, may bring such a challenge.      (“An\n\n 2   inmate must be personally affected by the policy or issue he/she\n\n 3   is grieving, or must show that he/she will be personally affected\n\n 4   by that policy or issue unless some relief is granted or changes\n\n 5   made.    All grievances must be filed in an individual capacity.”)\n\n 6           In addition, grievances alleging employee harassment, that\n\n 7   is “employee misconduct meant to annoy, intimidate or harm an\n\n 8   inmate,” see N.Y.C.R.R. § 701.11(a) (1994) (now codified and\n\n 9   renumbered at N.Y.C.R.R. § 701.2(e) (2006)), can be processed\n\n10   through an expedited procedure created for the review of such\n\n11   grievances.    N.Y.C.R.R. § 701.11(b) (1994) (now codified at\n\n12   N.Y.C.R.R. § 701.8(b)-(h) (2006)); Directive No. 4040, VIII.\n\n13   Pursuant to this expedited procedure, an inmate can report an\n\n14   alleged incident of harassment to the employee’s supervisor.\n\n15   Such a report does not, however, “preclude submission of a formal\n\n16   grievance.”    N.Y.C.R.R. § 701.11(b)(1) (1994) (now codified as\n\n17   amended and renumbered at N.Y.C.R.R. § 701.8(a) (2006));\n\n18   Directive No. 4040, VIII(A).    Any allegation of employee\n\n19   misconduct or harassment is to be given a grievance number,\n\n20   recorded with all other grievances in the grievance log and\n\n21   forwarded to the superintendent for his consideration.\n\n22   N.Y.C.R.R. § 701.11(b)(2) (1994) (now codified as amended and\n\n23   renumbered at N.Y.C.R.R. § 701.8(b) (2006)); Directive No. 4040,\n\n                                       15\n\f 1   VIII(B).   If the superintendent (or his or her designee)\n\n 2   concludes that the grievance is not a “bona fide case of\n\n 3   harassment,” the superintendent returns the grievance to the\n\n 4   ordinary procedure.   N.Y.C.R.R. § 701.11(b)(3) (1994) (now\n\n 5   codified as amended and renumbered at N.Y.C.R.R. § 701.8(c)\n\n 6   (2006)); Directive No. 4040, VIII(C).   If the grievance presents\n\n 7   a “bona fide harassment issue,” the superintendent can elect to:\n\n 8   (i) initiate an in-house investigation, (ii) request an\n\n 9   investigation by the Inspector General’s Office; or (iii) in the\n\n10   event of criminal activity, request an investigation by the New\n\n11   York State Police.    N.Y.C.R.R. § 701.11(b)(4) (now codified as\n\n12   amended and renumbered at N.Y.C.R.R. § 701.8(d) (2006)) Directive\n\n13   No. 4040, VIII(D).    An inmate can then appeal the\n\n14   superintendent’s determination to the CORC, provided she does so\n\n15   within four days.    See N.Y.C.R.R. § 701.11(b)(6)-(7) (1994) (now\n\n16   codified as amended at N.Y.C.R.R. § 701.8(g)-(h) (2006) (now\n\n17   providing an inmate with seven days to appeal to the CORC)); see\n\n18   also Directive No. 4040, VIII(E)-(G).\n\n19        The class action complaint contains allegations about the\n\n20   actual practices followed under the IGP.   Upon arrival at DOCS,\n\n21   it is alleged, female prisoners receive an orientation to DOCS\n\n22   policies and practices.   The orientation encourages inmates to\n\n23   lodge sexual misconduct complaints with any official, including\n\n                                      16\n\f 1   the Inspector General (“IG”), as well as DOCS supervisory staff\n\n 2   and employees, whether orally or in writing.            The IG’s Office,\n\n 3   and in particular, its Sex Crimes Unit, is alleged by the\n\n 4   complaint to be the alternative administrative mechanism DOCS\n\n 5   established to handle complaints of staff abuse.             The Sex Crimes\n\n 6   Unit receives more than 200 complaints of sexual misconduct every\n\n 7   year.       According to the complaint, it is DOCS’ standard practice\n\n 8   to refer such complaints to the IG for investigation, whether\n\n 9   initiated by formal grievance or informal complaint.              DOCS’\n\n10   ensuing response is also alleged to be inadequate by failing to\n\n11   initiate an investigation in a timely manner, failing to\n\n12   adequately investigate and credit inmate complaints, failing to\n\n13   maintain confidentiality, and failing to address any\n\n14   substantiated allegations meaningfully.\n\n15           According to appellants, inmates at DOCS facilities are\n\n16   provided with various materials regarding DOCS policies and\n\n17   procedures with respect to sexual abuse complaints.4             For\n\n18   example, at Bedford Hills, the intake facility for all female\n\n19   inmates, see DOCS Directive No. 0046, the Orientation Manual\n\n20   urges female inmates to “report [sexual abuse] . . . to a\n\n\n\n             4\n             Not   all inmate orientation manuals expressly address sexual\n     misconduct;   some simply explicate the IGP. See Albion Correctional Facility\n     Orientation   Manual 9-10 (2002); Taconic Correctional Facility Inmate\n     Orientation   Manual 62-64 (2000).\n\n                                            17\n\f 1   supervisor immediately, go to grievance and make a record of the\n\n 2   allegation, and write to the Superintendent or any official that\n\n 3   you are comfortable approaching.      Write to the Inspector General\n\n 4   . . . if you feel more comfortable going directly outside the\n\n 5   facility.”   Bedford Hills Correctional Facility Inmate\n\n 6   Orientation Manual 3 (1999); see also Bedford Hills Correctional\n\n 7   Facility Inmate Orientation Manual 3 (2000)(same); Bedford Hills\n\n 8   Correctional Facility Inmate Orientation Manual 4 (2003)\n\n 9   (“[R]eport [sexual misconduct] to any member of [Bedford Hill’s]\n\n10   Executive Team or to Inmate Grievance”).      The record demonstrates\n\n11   that the policies conveyed by the inmate orientation manuals to\n\n12   female inmates are reinforced through memoranda and postings at\n\n13   the various prison facilities.     Staff consistently testified that\n\n14   it was DOCS policy to allow women with complaints regarding\n\n15   sexual abuse to report such incidents to a variety of DOCS staff\n\n16   and officials.\n\n17        The Bedford Hills Orientation Manual also describes the IGP,\n\n18   explaining that a “grievance is a complaint about the substance\n\n19   or application of any written or unwritten policy, regulation,\n\n20   procedure, or rule of the facility or department, or the lack of\n\n21   a policy or procedure.”   Bedford Hills Correctional Facility\n\n22   Inmate Orientation Manual 36 (1999); see also Bedford Hills\n\n23   Correctional Facility Inmate Orientation Manual 41 (2000);\n\n                                      18\n\f 1   Bedford Hills Correctional Facility Inmate Orientation Manual 4\n\n 2   (2003).\n\n 3        On this record, it is clear that, under DOCS policies and\n\n 4   procedures, an IG investigation of alleged acts of sexual abuse\n\n 5   is an integral part of the internal grievance procedure.    The\n\n 6   record contains testimony and email correspondence indicating\n\n 7   that DOCS instructs its staff not to conduct any investigation\n\n 8   into sexual abuse and that the grievance procedure operates only\n\n 9   as a pass-through to the Sex Crimes Unit.   Indeed, women\n\n10   prisoners who did pursue relief through the IGP were told that\n\n11   their complaints had been forwarded to the IG for investigation\n\n12   and appropriate action.   All thirteen appellants had their\n\n13   allegations of sexual misconduct investigated by the IG, no\n\n14   matter how initiated.5\n\n15        It is clear, therefore, that the first step in the grievance\n\n16   procedure for an inmate alleging sexual abuse is an IG\n\n17   investigation, whether or not a request for policy/procedure\n\n18   reform is included.   Such allegations, when presented to a\n\n\n          5\n            The district court stated that “[e]ach Plaintiff alleges\n     that she complained to the Inspector General about her sexual\n     abuse.” The court found that Tonie Coggins, Stephanie Dawson,\n     and Kristina Muehleisen complained to the immediate supervisor of\n     the alleged abuser. The court also found that Stephanie Dawson,\n     Tanya Jones, Laura Pullen, Corilynn Rock, Denise Saffioti, and\n     Shenyell Smith all grieved to a DOCS official that “they felt\n     comfortable approaching.”\n\n                                     19\n\f 1   superintendent, were routinely referred to the IG.    Moreover, an\n\n 2   IG determination about abuse of an inmate can be appealed to CORC\n\n 3   when the determination is reported to and accepted by the\n\n 4   superintendent.\n\n 5           The grievance procedures are further complicated when\n\n 6   challenges to DOCS policies concerning sexual misconduct are\n\n 7   made.    As noted, the regulations governing the IGP specifically\n\n 8   contemplate its use to pursue challenges to existing policies as\n\n 9   well as challenges that a policy should be created where one does\n\n10   not exist.     See N.Y.C.R.R. § 701.2(a) (defining grievance as “a\n\n11   complaint about the substance or application of any written or\n\n12   unwritten policy . . . or the lack of a policy”).    As noted,\n\n13   appellants’ complaint asserts just such a challenge.\n\n14           However, an inmate may not challenge a policy, or lack\n\n15   thereof, without a showing of concrete injury, N.Y.C.R.R. §\n\n16   701.3(b), in this case an act of sexual abuse.    Three appellants\n\n17   filed such grievances and appealed through all levels of the IGP\n\n18   procedure:    Shenyell Smith, Stephanie Dawson, and Shantelle\n\n19   Smith.    All three had their grievances investigated by the IG.\n\n20   When the allegation of an act of abuse is combined with a claim\n\n21   for reform of policies and the abuse determination is unfavorable\n\n22   to the inmate, both claims can be pursued on appeal from the IG\n\n23   or superintendent to CORC.    But, it appears on this record that\n\n                                       20\n\f 1   CORC does not entertain the claim for policy change unless the\n\n 2   allegation of an act(s) of sexual abuse is upheld.   In these\n\n 3   three cases, the allegations of acts of sexual abuse were denied.\n\n 4   In none of the three cases did any correctional official or\n\n 5   tribunal ever mention the grievances’ challenge to policies and\n\n 6   procedures.\n\n 7   c) Mootness of the Injunctive Claims\n\n 8        Of course, a class action cannot be sustained without a\n\n 9   named plaintiff who has standing.    Kendall v. Emps. Ret. Plan of\n\n10   Avon Prods., 561 F.3d 112, 118 (2d Cir. 2009) (“In a class\n\n11   action, once standing is established for a named plaintiff,\n\n12   standing is established for the entire class.”)    The district\n\n13   court held that the claims of those appellants who have been\n\n14   released are moot and that the relation-back doctrine does not\n\n15   preserve those claims for judicial review.    Because the claims of\n\n16   all plaintiffs were then dismissed for either mootness or a\n\n17   failure to exhaust, the district court stated “[t]here is no need\n\n18   to grant Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification, which is\n\n19   hereby denied.”   Amador, 2007 WL 4326747 at *9.\n\n20        We conclude that the relation-back doctrine applies to the\n\n21   claims of the plaintiffs who have been released and preserves\n\n22   their claims for adjudication for purposes of a class action.\n\n23\n\n                                     21\n\f 1          The standing requirement winnows out disputes that would be\n\n 2   inappropriate for judicial resolution for lack of three\n\n 3   constitutionally required elements:   (i) an injury in fact (ii)\n\n 4   that is fairly traceable to the defendant and (iii) that is\n\n 5   likely to be redressed by a favorable decision.   See Lujan v.\n\n 6   Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992); McCormick ex\n\n 7   rel. McCormick v. School Dist. of Mamaroneck, 370 F.3d 275, 284\n\n 8   (2d Cir. 2004).   Similarly, the mootness doctrine ensures that\n\n 9   the occasion for judicial resolution established by standing\n\n10   persists throughout the life of a lawsuit.    See Comer, 37 F.3d at\n\n11   798.   Consequently, in the usual case, if the basis for the claim\n\n12   has been rectified or if the plaintiff is no longer subject to\n\n13   the challenged conduct, the claim is moot.    See Armstrong v.\n\n14   Ward, 529 F.2d 1132, 1135 (2d Cir. 1976).\n\n15          The relation-back doctrine, however, has unique application\n\n16   in the class action context, preserving the claims of some named\n\n17   plaintiffs for class certification purposes that might well be\n\n18   moot if asserted only as individual claims.   For example, in\n\n19   Gerstein v. Pugh, a class challenged Florida’s practice of pre-\n\n20   trial detention without a probable cause hearing.   420 U.S. 103\n\n21   (1975).   Although the named class representatives had been\n\n22   convicted after the district court’s certification of the class\n\n23   and before the court was able to pass on the claims, the Court\n\n                                      22\n\f 1   held the case was not moot because it fell within “a narrow class\n\n 2   of cases in which the termination of a class representative’s\n\n 3   claim does not moot the claims of the unnamed members of the\n\n 4   class.”    420 U.S. at 110 n.11 (citing Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393\n\n 5   (1975)).   The Court reasoned that the issue was unlikely to be\n\n 6   resolved before a plaintiff was convicted or released.    Id.    An\n\n 7   individual could, therefore, suffer repeated deprivations under\n\n 8   the challenged practice, and it was certain that a continuing\n\n 9   class of similarly situated persons would suffer the\n\n10   constitutional harm alleged.   Id.\n\n11        In both Sosna and Gerstein, the mootness of the named\n\n12   representative’s claim arose after certification of a class.\n\n13   Each decision noted that the usual case required a live\n\n14   controversy at the time of the filing of the complaint and the\n\n15   class certification.   Sosna, 419 U.S. at 398, 402; Gerstein, 420\n\n16   U.S. at 110 n.11.   Sosna, however, recognized that in certain\n\n17   cases, the claims of the named plaintiffs might become moot\n\n18   before the district court had ruled on a certification motion:\n\n19   “In such instances, whether the certification can be said to\n\n20   ‘relate back’ to the filing of the complaint may depend upon the\n\n21   circumstances of the particular case and especially the reality\n\n22   of the claim that otherwise the issue would evade review.”      419\n\n23   U.S. at 402 n.11.\n\n                                      23\n\f 1        We have applied the relation-back theory to recipients of\n\n 2   public assistance alleging that action on their applications for\n\n 3   public assistance was unlawfully delayed by the state.    See\n\n 4   Robidoux v. Celani, 987 F.2d 931 (2d Cir. 1993).     In that\n\n 5   decision, we concluded that because the state would almost always\n\n 6   process a delayed application before relief could be obtained\n\n 7   through litigation and some of the appellants alleged that they\n\n 8   expected to need public assistance in the future, the claims were\n\n 9   not mooted by their receipt of benefits after the filing of the\n\n10   complaint.    Id. at 938-39.\n\n11        We have also applied the relation-back doctrine to class\n\n12   claims of racial discrimination and segregation in public housing\n\n13   in New York by low-income minority individuals.    Comer, 37 F.3d\n\n14   at 797-801.   We held that, because of the particular combination\n\n15   of a highly fluid public housing population, whose claims were\n\n16   “acutely susceptible to mootness,” and a two-year delay before\n\n17   the district court denied class certification, the class\n\n18   certification, which was granted on appeal, related back to the\n\n19   complaint.    Id.\n\n20        Whether claims are inherently transitory is an inquiry that\n\n21   must be made with reference to the claims of the class as a whole\n\n22   as opposed to any one individual claim for relief.    See U.S.\n\n23   Parole Comm’n v. Geraghty, 445 U.S. 388, 399-400 (1980);\n\n                                     24\n\f 1   Gerstein, 420 U.S. at 110 n.11.    According to the supervisory\n\n 2   appellees, there is nothing inherently transitory about\n\n 3   appellants’ claims because inmates serve a range of terms of\n\n 4   imprisonment.   Thus, they argue, while some inmates may be\n\n 5   released before their claims can be adjudicated, others will\n\n 6   remain incarcerated long enough for courts to adjudicate their\n\n 7   claims.   We disagree.\n\n 8        We have previously observed that “a significant\n\n 9   characteristic” of claims subject to the “capable of repetition,\n\n10   yet evading review” exception is that the mootness resulted from\n\n11   “a factor closely related to the essence of the claim.”     Swan v.\n\n12   Stoneman, 635 F.2d 97, 102 n.6 (2d Cir. 1980).     As such, these\n\n13   claims “involve[] issues that [are] likely to evade review, no\n\n14   matter who prosecute[s] them.”    Id.   Although a close issue, we\n\n15   conclude that this exception applies.\n\n16        This action is brought on behalf of all women inmates in\n\n17   DOCS custody, alleging constitutionally defective policies and\n\n18   procedures in failing to protect female inmates from sexual\n\n19   harassment, abuse, and assault by male staff.    While the entire\n\n20   class may be exposed to the risks caused by the constitutionally\n\n21   defective policies and procedures alleged, as noted, the\n\n22   grievance procedure may be triggered only by an inmate who has\n\n23   been a victim of sexual misconduct.     Because the number of\n\n                                       25\n\f 1   inmates subjected to acts of misconduct can be a small fraction\n\n 2   of the total inmates at risk, the odds of an inmate being able to\n\n 3   complete the grievance procedure and litigate a class action\n\n 4   while still incarcerated are rather small.            All thirteen\n\n 5   appellants were in DOCS custody when they commenced the action;\n\n 6   only four remained incarcerated when the district court rendered\n\n 7   its September 13, 2005 decision.6           Four appellants have been\n\n 8   released and subsequently reincarcerated during the course of\n\n 9   these proceedings,7 and of these, only two, remained in custody\n\n10   following the filing of the notice of appeal.8\n\n11         Accordingly, we conclude that it was error for the district\n\n12   court to dismiss as moot the claims of the individual plaintiffs\n\n13   who had been released from prison after the filing of the amended\n\n14   complaint.      See Wilkerson v. Bowen, 828 F.2d 117, 121 (3d Cir.\n\n15   1987) (“It would seem to us that the principle espoused in\n\n16   Geraghty is applicable whether the particular claim of the\n\n17   proposed class plaintiff is resolved while a class certification\n\n18   motion is pending in the district court (as in the present case)\n\n\n\n           6\n 1           Stacie Calloway, Kristina Muehleisen, Nakia Thompson and Shenyell\n 2   Smith were incarcerated at that time. [A 6952, 6954, 6955, 6956]\n 3\n           7\n             The four appellants are Corilynn Rock, Stacie Calloway, Tanya Jones\n     and Denise Saffioti.\n\n           8\n               The two appellants are Corilynn Rock and Denise Saffioti.\n\n                                            26\n\f 1   or while an appeal from denial of a class certification motion is\n\n 2   pending in the court of appeals (as in Geraghty).            In neither\n\n 3   event is the plaintiff automatically disqualified from being a\n\n 4   class representative . . . .”); Wade v. Kirkland, 118 F.3d 667,\n\n 5   670 (9th Cir. 1997) (holding that, in light of the potential for\n\n 6   a prisoner’s claim to be “inherently transitory,” the action\n\n 7   could qualify for an exception to mootness, and if so found on\n\n 8   remand, the district court could validly certify a class, “since\n\n 9   the ‘relation back’ doctrine will relate to [plaintiff’s]\n\n10   standing at the outset of the case”).\n\n11   d) Exhaustion by Appellants\n\n12         Having held that the relation-back theory applies, we now\n\n13   address whether any of the individual plaintiffs have properly\n\n14   exhausted internal prison remedies.\n\n15         Of the thirteen appellants, nine made internal complaints,\n\n16   investigated by the IG, that sought redress only for the alleged\n\n17   actions of the particular officer and did not seek a change in\n\n18   policies or procedures.9      These nine have, therefore, not\n\n19   exhausted their internal remedies with regard to the complaint in\n\n20   the present action.\n\n21         Another appellant, Stacie Calloway, complained about a\n\n           9\n             The nine individuals are Nakia Thompson, Hope Susoh, Denise Saffioti,\n     Corilynn Rock, Laura Pullen, Kristina Muehleisen, Latasha Dockery, and Tonie\n     Coggins.\n\n                                          27\n\f 1   sexual assault.    However, her affidavit also states that she\n\n 2   informed the IG that sexual abuse was a problem affecting other\n\n 3   inmates and that no one kept track of what the officers were\n\n 4   doing.     We believe that this complaint sufficiently raises\n\n 5   systemic issues relating to policies and procedures regarding the\n\n 6   prevention of sexual abuse.    To be sure, she did not ask for the\n\n 7   precise relief sought in this action, but she adequately alerted\n\n 8   the authorities as to her claim of systemic issues.    However,\n\n 9   Calloway did not appeal to CORC, which is the final step in the\n\n10   grievance procedure for raising issues regarding DOCS polices.\n\n11   The issue, then, is whether her failure to exhaust should be\n\n12   excused.\n\n13        In Hemphill v. New York, we established a three-part inquiry\n\n14   to guide the analysis of whether a plaintiff has met the\n\n15   requirements of Section 1997e(a) of the PLRA.    380 F.3d at 686.\n\n16   The first part, which is not an issue here, is a determination\n\n17   that administrative remedies were in fact available to the\n\n18   prisoner.    Id. at 686-88.   The second part considers whether\n\n19   defendants forfeited the affirmative defense of non-exhaustion by\n\n20   failing to raise or preserve it, or whether defendants’ own\n\n21   actions inhibiting the inmate’s exhaustion of remedies estops one\n\n22   or more of the defendants from raising the exhaustion defense.\n\n23   Id. at 686, 688-89.    The third part requires consideration of\n\n                                       28\n\f 1   whether, if the requirements of step two were not met, special\n\n 2   circumstances excuse the plaintiff’s failure to pursue or exhaust\n\n 3   administrative remedies.   Id. at 686, 689-91.   If any of the\n\n 4   three parts is satisfied, the prisoner is deemed to have\n\n 5   exhausted internal procedures for purposes of the PLRA.\n\n 6        Subsequent decisions have questioned the continued viability\n\n 7   of this framework following the Supreme Court’s decision in\n\n 8   Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81 (2006).    In Woodford the Court\n\n 9   addressed whether “a prisoner can satisfy the [PLRA’s] exhaustion\n\n10   requirement by filing an untimely or otherwise procedurally\n\n11   defective administrative grievance or appeal.”   Id. at 83-84.\n\n12   The Court resolved the question in the negative, explaining that\n\n13   PLRA requires “proper exhaustion,” that is “using all steps that\n\n14   the agency holds out, and doing so properly (so that the agency\n\n15   addresses the issues on the merits).”   Id. at 90 (emphasis\n\n16   omitted).   We have questioned whether, in light of Woodford, the\n\n17   doctrines of estoppel and special circumstances survived.     See\n\n18   Macias v. Zenk, 495 F.3d 37, 43 n.1 (2d Cir. 2007) (“[W]e need\n\n19   not decide what effect Woodford has on Hemphill’s holding that\n\n20   where administrative procedures are confusing a reasonable\n\n21   interpretation of prison grievance regulations may justify an\n\n22   inmate’s failure to follow procedural rules to the letter.”)\n\n23   (internal quotations omitted); Ruggiero v. County of Orange, 467\n\n                                     29\n\f 1   F.3d 170, 176 (2d Cir. 2006) (noting that “[w]e need not\n\n 2   determine what effect Woodford has on our case law in this area”\n\n 3   because the prisoner’s estoppel and special circumstances\n\n 4   arguments nonetheless failed).\n\n 5        We too decline to reach the issue, concluding that, even\n\n 6   under pre-Woodford caselaw, Calloway has failed to establish that\n\n 7   defendants are estopped from raising exhaustion as a defense or\n\n 8   that special circumstances excuse her failure to exhaust.\n\n 9        A prisoner may invoke the doctrine of estoppel when\n\n10   “defendants took affirmative action to prevent him from availing\n\n11   himself of grievance procedures.”     Ruggiero, 467 F.3d at 178.\n\n12   Prior cases have held that verbal and physical threats of\n\n13   retaliation, physical assault, denial of grievance forms or\n\n14   writing implements, and transfers constitute such affirmative\n\n15   action.   See, e.g., Hemphill, 380 F.3d at 688; Ziemba v. Wezner,\n\n16   366 F.3d 161, 162 (2d Cir. 2004).     No such conduct prevented\n\n17   Calloway from appealing to CORC.      Nor were there special\n\n18   circumstances relieving Calloway of the obligation to exhaust the\n\n19   IGP procedures.   It is clear that challenges to DOCS policies or\n\n20   lack thereof, the subject matter of this lawsuit -- where coupled\n\n21   with a claim of sexual abuse -- must be pursued through the CORC\n\n22   level.    While this is a somewhat complex scheme, it hardly\n\n\n\n\n                                      30\n\f 1   constitutes special circumstances.    Calloway’s grievance was thus\n\n 2   not exhausted.\n\n 3        Two other appellants, whose complaints were dismissed as\n\n 4   moot but to which we have applied the relation-back doctrine,\n\n 5   Shantelle Smith and Sheynell Smith, alleged both assaults and a\n\n 6   failure to protect and completed the grievance procedure.\n\n 7        Shenyell Smith wrote a letter addressed “To Whom It May\n\n 8   Concern” that was logged as a grievance on January 3, 2002.    The\n\n 9   letter alleged that she had been harassed for a period of three\n\n10   months, retaliated against, and sexually assaulted by an officer.\n\n11   With respect to the relief sought, she stated, “This officer is\n\n12   still working on this unit and its not right.    I feel that [the\n\n13   officer] should seek counseling [and be] removed . . . , fired\n\n14   and any other [precaution] that is there.”     The superintendent\n\n15   responded that “[a] significant portion of this complaint has to\n\n16   do with issues turned over to the Inspector General’s Office for\n\n17   investigation in accordance with Departmental procedures.\n\n18   Grievance denied in that no basis was found for your\n\n19   allegations.”    She appealed the grievance.   On February 20, 2002,\n\n20   CORC denied it, stating, “Upon full hearing of the facts and\n\n21   circumstances in the instant case, the action requested herein is\n\n22   hereby denied.   CORC upholds the determination of the\n\n23   Superintendent for the reasons stated.”\n\n                                      31\n\f 1         Shantelle Smith filed a grievance with the IGRC on July 10,\n\n 2   2003, alleging a sexual assault by an officer.           With respect to\n\n 3   corrective action, she stated, “I am seeking monetary damages for\n\n 4   the reason that the State had a duty to protect me and failed to\n\n 5   do so, thus rendering their misactions as a ‘Failure to Protect’,\n\n 6   a most serious dereliction of their duty to provide for my care,\n\n 7   custody and control.”      On July 11, 2003, the superintendent\n\n 8   responded, neither granting nor denying the grievance, stating\n\n 9   only, “Your grievance has been forwarded to the Inspector\n\n10   General’s office for further investigation.”           Shantelle appealed,\n\n11   and on September 10, 2003, CORC denied the grievance, stating,\n\n12   “CORC upholds the determination of the Superintendent for the\n\n13   reasons stated.     CORC notes that the grievant’s allegation of\n\n14   sexual misconduct . . . has been forwarded to the appropriate\n\n15   Central Office personnel for investigation.           Any action deemed\n\n16   necessary and appropriate will be taken as a result of that\n\n17   investigation.”     That disposition states that any final action\n\n18   would be taken by the IG.       No favorable action was taken by the\n\n19   IG, and we deem the grievance procedure exhausted.10\n\n20         Each of these inmates completed the IGP procedure.            The\n\n21   issue is whether a claim of a failure to protect is sufficient\n\n           10\n              CORC’s response to Shenyell Smith’s and Shantelle Smith’s appeals was\n     identical to its response to Stephanie Dawson’s appeal, discussed infra.\n     Appellees agree that Dawson exhausted the grievance procedure.\n\n                                          32\n\f 1   exhaustion with regard to litigation seeking systemic relief.\n\n 2   The issue, in our view, is whether a reasonable corrections\n\n 3   official would recognize a complaint alleging a failure to\n\n 4   protect a female inmate from a sexual assault by a male officer\n\n 5   as raising issues regarding DOCS policies and procedures.    We\n\n 6   believe that it would.    To be sure, a “grievance may not be so\n\n 7   vague as to preclude prison officials from taking appropriate\n\n 8   measures to resolve the complaint internally.”    Brownell, 446\n\n 9   F.3d at 310.    However, a failure to protect involves conduct by\n\n10   officials superior to the officer accused of the misconduct and\n\n11   suggests the need for policy and procedural reform.    While the\n\n12   complaint asks for a result -- protection -- rather than\n\n13   specifying the means used to reach that result, the need for the\n\n14   result is clearly articulated and the appropriate means are far\n\n15   more within the expertise of DOCS than the individual prisoner.\n\n16           A fourth appellant, Stephanie Dawson, clearly alleged an act\n\n17   of sexual misconduct, clearly sought systemic reform along the\n\n18   lines of the class action complaint, and clearly exhausted the\n\n19   IGP procedure.    Her claim was dismissed as moot by the district\n\n20   court but is now revived by application of the relation-back\n\n21   doctrine.\n\n22           Dawson filed her grievance with the IGRC on February 25,\n\n23   2003.    She alleged that she was raped by an officer at the prison\n\n                                       33\n\f 1   where she was incarcerated.    In describing her grievance, she\n\n 2   stated, “Taconic didn’t provide protection from Correctional\n\n 3   Officer sexual assault on me.”    Dawson requested various relief\n\n 4   including:   (i) “For DOCS to train and assign and supervise staff\n\n 5   so that [she would] not again [be] subjected to this kind of\n\n 6   abuse”; (ii) “For DOCS to conduct a full and complete\n\n 7   investigation”; (iii) “That [the officer] should be disciplined”;\n\n 8   and (iv) “That [she] continue to receive mental health\n\n 9   counseling.”    In response, the superintendent concluded that “an\n\n10   investigation by the DOCS Inspector General’s Office is in\n\n11   progress.”     When Dawson sought to appeal, she was advised that an\n\n12   appeal would be “redundant.”    Dawson nonetheless pressed her\n\n13   appeal, and CORC upheld the superintendent’s decision.    CORC\n\n14   noted that “the complaint has been forwarded to the appropriate\n\n15   Department personnel for investigation.    Any action deemed\n\n16   necessary will be taken as a result of the investigation.”\n\n17        The parties agree that Dawson’s grievance was both\n\n18   procedurally and substantively exhausted.     Because Dawson’s role\n\n19   as plaintiff is not mooted by her release for reasons stated\n\n20   supra, she is entitled to pursue a role as class representative.\n\n21        Our conclusion that the district court erred when it failed\n\n22   to relate those claims it deemed moot back to the filing of the\n\n23   complaint does not automatically establish that the three\n\n                                       34\n\f 1   appellants affected, Stephanie Dawson, Shantelle Smith, and\n\n 2   Sheynell Smith, are entitled to litigate the interests of the\n\n 3   class they seek to represent.   See Sosna, 419 U.S. at 403 (“This\n\n 4   conclusion does not automatically establish that appellant is\n\n 5   entitled to litigate the interests of the class she seeks to\n\n 6   represent, but it does shift the focus of examination from the\n\n 7   elements of justiciability to the ability of the named\n\n 8   representative to ‘fairly and adequately protect the interests of\n\n 9   the class.’” (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a))).   In a separate\n\n10   proceeding, a previous panel of this court denied appellants’\n\n11   application for leave to appeal the denial of class certification\n\n12   by the district court. Accordingly, the propriety of class\n\n13   certification is not before us.\n\n14                              CONCLUSION\n\n15        We dismiss the damages claims for lack of jurisdiction.     We\n\n16   vacate the judgment of the district court with respect to the\n\n17   claims designated in this opinion, and remand for further\n\n18   proceedings consistent with the opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                       35\n\f",

The complaint, brought under 42 U.S.C. §\n\n12   1983, sought declaratory and injunctive relief compelling the\n\n13   Department of Correctional Services (“DOCS”) to alter its\n\n14   practices and procedures so as to enhance the protection of the\n\n15   class from sexual assault, abuse, and harassment.            The complaint\n\n16   also asserted individual claims for damages.           The dismissal was\n\n17   based on the grounds that some of the claims of named plaintiffs\n\n18   were moot and that the remaining named plaintiffs had failed to\n\n19   exhaust available remedies as required by the Prison Litigation\n\n20   Reform Act of 1995 (“PLRA”).        Appellees are individual line\n\n21   officers (“line officer appellees”), various superintendents and\n\n22   supervisors of certain New York State prisons, and DOCS officials\n\n23   (“supervisory appellees”).1\n\n\n           1\n             The supervisory appellees include DOCS Superintendents Anginell\n     Andrews, Roberta Coward, Dennis Crowley, Alexandreena Dixon, Elaine Lord,\n     Ronald Moscicki and Melvin Williams; DOCS Deputy Superintendent Donald Wolff;\n     DOCS Director of Personnel Terry Baxter; DOCS Inspector General Richard Roy;\n     DOCS Director of the Sex Crimes Unit of the Inspector General’s Office Barbara\n     D. Leon; DOCS Director of the Bureau of Labor Relations Peter Brown; Office\n     of Mental Health Commissioner James Stone; and DOCS Commissioner Glenn S.\n                                           4\n\f 1         A prior panel held that we have appellate jurisdiction over\n\n 2   the claims for injunctive and declaratory relief pursuant to 28\n\n 3   U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1).      Amador v. Superintendents of Dep’t Corr.\n\n 4   Servs., No. 08-2079-pr (2d Cir. June 25, 2008).           We hold that we\n\n 5   lack pendent appellate jurisdiction over the damages claims.              We\n\n 6   also hold that the claims for injunctive and declaratory relief\n\n 7   by appellants who are now free but were in DOCS custody when they\n\n 8   brought suit are not moot.       Applying a relation-back theory, we\n\n 9   hold that appellants’ class claims are capable of repetition, yet\n\n10   evading review.     We conclude that three appellants have exhausted\n\n11   applicable internal prison grievance proceedings while the\n\n12   remaining ten have not.       We vacate the judgment in part and\n\n13   remand for further proceedings.\n\n14\n\n15\n\n\n     Goord. Deputy Superintendent Donald Wolff has been sued only for damages.\n     Several of these individuals may no longer be holding the named positions, but\n     their successors are automatically substituted under Federal Rule of Appellate\n     Procedure 43(c)(2). The line officer appellees include Charles Davis, Michael\n     Evans, John E. Gilbert III, Rick Laru, Rico Meyers, and Jeffrey Shawver. The\n     line officer appellees respond to damages claims by appellants Corilynn Rock,\n     Kristina Muehleisen, Laura Pullen, Nakia Thompson, Tanya Jones, Stacie\n     Calloway, Hope Susoh, Latasha Dockery, and Tonie Coggins.\n           We do not address appellants’ arguments with respect to its claims\n     against the Commissioner of the Office of Mental Health (“OMH”). The\n     supervisory appellees state, without contradiction, that the district court’s\n     decision could not have addressed the appellants’ claims against the OMH as\n     neither their motion to dismiss nor their opposition to appellants’ motion to\n     reconsider purported to address appellants’ claims against the OMH.\n     Accordingly, our disposition of this appeal does not encompass this claim and\n     is rendered without prejudice to either parties’ arguments with respect to\n     that claim on remand.\n\n                                           5\n\f 1                               BACKGROUND\n\n 2   a) The Complaint\n\n 3        Appellants’ complaint seeks redress as individuals and as a\n\n 4   class for alleged sexual abuse and harassment in violation of\n\n 5   rights secured by the First, Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth\n\n 6   Amendments pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983.   The class is described\n\n 7   as “all present and future women prisoners in DOCS custody.”\n\n 8   Compl. at 67, Amador v. Superintendents of Dep’t of Corr. Servs.,\n\n 9   No. 03 Civ. 0650(KTD) (GWG) (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 14, 2003).   It alleges\n\n10   that the approximately 3000 women prisoners in DOCS custody are\n\n11   at any time subject to a substantial and unreasonable risk of\n\n12   sexual abuse or harassment as a result of DOCS policies and\n\n13   procedures.   These policies and practices, alleged to present\n\n14   common issues of law and fact, include the adequacy of DOCS’:\n\n15   (i) screening, assigning, training, and supervising male staff,\n\n16   and the staff at large, regarding sexual misconduct; (ii)\n\n17   reporting and investigatory mechanisms for sexual misconduct; and\n\n18   (iii) investigating and responding to complaints of sexual\n\n19   misconduct.   On behalf of the class, the complaint sought\n\n20   injunctive and declaratory relief from the supervisory appellees,\n\n21   who were alleged to have been aware of the abuse and to have\n\n22   failed to take appropriate preventive measures.   Appellants also\n\n23   asserted individual claims for damages with respect to certain\n\n                                      6\n\f 1   line officers and one DOCS superintendent for their roles in\n\n 2   alleged sexual assault, abuse, and harassment of several\n\n 3   appellants while they were in DOCS custody.           The conduct alleged\n\n 4   ranges from unwelcome touching and invasions of privacy to\n\n 5   assault and rape.2     More details of the allegations are provided\n\n 6   as relevant infra.\n\n 7   b) Procedural History\n\n 8         Each of the appellants was in DOCS custody when the\n\n 9   complaint was filed on January 28, 2003.          A motion for class\n\n10   certification was filed six months later, followed by an amended\n\n11   complaint adding the claims of two new inmates, Stephanie Dawson\n\n12   and Shantelle Smith.      Shortly thereafter, appellees filed various\n\n13   motions to dismiss.\n\n14         On September 13, 2005, the district court granted the\n\n15   motions in part, dismissing five plaintiffs’ injunctive claims on\n\n16   the ground that they lacked standing because they had been\n\n17   released from prison before joining the amended complaint.              Two\n\n18   of these plaintiffs, Corilynn Rock and Laura Pullen, now appeal.\n\n19   The district court also converted defendants’ motion to dismiss\n\n20   to one for summary judgment on the limited issue of exhaustion\n\n21   and reserved judgment on the motion for class certification.              See\n\n\n\n           2\n             Women entrusted to the custody of DOCS are deemed incapable of consent\n     to sexual advances. See N.Y.

Dec. 4, 2007).   It dismissed as moot the injunctive\n\n 7   claims of Stephanie Dawson and Shantelle Smith because they had\n\n 8   been released from prison while the motion for class\n\n 9   certification was pending.   The district court then dismissed for\n\n10   failure to exhaust, the claims of Stacie Calloway, Tonie Coggins,\n\n11   Latasha Dockery, Tanya Jones, Kristina Muhleisen, Denise\n\n12   Saffioti, Hope Susoh, and Nakia Thompson.   Finally, the district\n\n13   court dismissed the injunctive claims of Shenyell Smith against\n\n14   the supervisory appellees on the ground that she failed to\n\n15   identify any defendant other than the officer who was alleged to\n\n16   have sexually assaulted her.   Having dismissed all the claims\n\n17   against the supervisory appellees for mootness or failure to\n\n18   exhaust, the district court concluded that class certification\n\n19   was not warranted.   The district court dismissed all claims for\n\n20   damages save those of Shenyell Smith against Officer Delroy\n\n21   Thorpe.   Id.\n\n22        On plaintiffs’ motion for reconsideration, the district\n\n23   court amended its order without explanation, to, among other\n\n                                      8\n\f 1   things, reinstate the claims for damages by certain plaintiffs:\n\n 2   Lucy Amador against Michael Galbreath and Robert Smith; Bette\n\n 3   Jean McDonald against John E.

A resolution of\n\n11   the dispute over exhaustion of the damages claims would not\n\n12   necessarily overlap with the resolution concerning exhaustion\n\n13   with regard to injunctive relief.     There is, therefore, an\n\n14   insufficient basis for us to justify the application of an\n\n15   exception to an exception, i.e., the exercise of jurisdiction\n\n16   over claims pendent to a claim reviewable only as an exception to\n\n17   the final order rule.   Under these circumstances, a measure of\n\n18   self-restraint is desirable, particularly because appellants’\n\n19   proffered justification for pendent jurisdiction does not\n\n20   distinguish them from most litigants seeking both injunctive\n\n21   relief and damages.\n\n22\n\n23\n\n                                      11\n\f 1   b) Exhaustion and the Grievance Procedure\n\n 2        The PLRA provides in pertinent part:\n\n 3        No action shall be brought with respect to prison\n 4        conditions under section 1983 of this title, or\n 5        any other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in\n 6        any jail, prison, or other correctional facility\n 7        until such administrative remedies as are\n 8        available are exhausted.\n 9\n10   42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a).\n11\n12        The purpose of the PLRA is “to reduce the quantity and\n\n13   improve the quality of prisoner suits . . .

We discuss the\n\n 6   application of the procedure and practices to appellants infra.\n\n 7   The IGP defines a grievance as “a complaint about the substance\n\n 8   or application of any written or unwritten policy, regulation,\n\n 9   procedure or rule of the [DOCS] or any of its program units, or\n\n10   the lack of a policy, regulation, procedure or rule.”            N.Y.C.R.R.\n\n11   § 701.2(a) (1994); cf.

DOCS’ policies and procedures for the IGP are set forth in Part 7\n     of Title 7 of the New York Compilation of Codes, Rules and Regulations, and\n     are mirrored with minor refinements in DOCS Policy and Procedure Manual\n     Directive Number 4040. See N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 7, (“N.Y.C.R.R.”)\n     § 701.1 et seq; New York Department of Correctional Services Directive No.\n     4040 (1998) (“Directive No. 4040\"). The complaint described incidents that\n     occurred between 1999 and 2003. Accordingly, the relevant regulations are\n     those that were in effect before the 2004 and 2006 revisions. See Espinal,\n     558 F.3d at 125 (noting that the relevant regulations were those in effect\n     when the prisoner filed the grievances at issue).\n\n                                          13\n\f 1        To initiate the process, an inmate must file a written\n\n 2   complaint with the Inmate Grievance Resolution Committee\n\n 3   (“IGRC”), a facility committee composed of inmates and appointed\n\n 4   staff members.   See N.Y.C.R.R. § 701.4-.5.   The complaint must\n\n 5   “contain a concise, specific description of the problem and the\n\n 6   action requested.”    N.Y.C.R.R. § 701.7(a)(1)(i) (1998) (now\n\n 7   codified as amended at N.Y.C.R.R. § 701.5(a)(2) (2007)).   Second,\n\n 8   the inmate can appeal an unfavorable IGRC determination to the\n\n 9   superintendent of the facility.    See N.Y.C.R.R. § 701.7(b) (1998)\n\n10   (now codified as amended and renumbered at N.Y.C.R.R. § 701.5(c)\n\n11   (2007)).    Finally, an inmate can appeal an unfavorable\n\n12   superintendent’s determination to the Central Office Review\n\n13   Committee (“CORC”).   See N.Y.C.R.R. § 701.7(c) (1998) (now\n\n14   codified as amended and renumbered at N.Y.C.R.R. § 701.5(d)\n\n15   (2007)); Directive No. 4040.\n\n16        This scheme specifically contemplates challenges to DOCS\n\n17   policies and procedures.   For example, when a grievance involves\n\n18   “changes in policy,” the IGRC is required to submit a\n\n19   recommendation to the superintendent, which, if accepted, can be\n\n20   appealed.   N.Y.C.R.R. § 701.7(a)(4)(vi) (1998) (now codified as\n\n21   amended and renumbered at N.Y.C.R.R. § 701.5(b)(3)(ii) (2007)).\n\n22   Of particular importance to the proceeding before us is the\n\n23   provision that only those inmates who are affected by a policy or\n\n                                       14\n\f 1   procedure, or lack thereof, may bring such a challenge.      (“An\n\n 2   inmate must be personally affected by the policy or issue he/she\n\n 3   is grieving, or must show that he/she will be personally affected\n\n 4   by that policy or issue unless some relief is granted or changes\n\n 5   made.    All grievances must be filed in an individual capacity.”)\n\n 6           In addition, grievances alleging employee harassment, that\n\n 7   is “employee misconduct meant to annoy, intimidate or harm an\n\n 8   inmate,” see N.Y.C.R.R. § 701.11(a) (1994) (now codified and\n\n 9   renumbered at N.Y.C.R.R. § 701.2(e) (2006)), can be processed\n\n10   through an expedited procedure created for the review of such\n\n11   grievances.    N.Y.C.R.R. § 701.11(b) (1994) (now codified at\n\n12   N.Y.C.R.R. § 701.8(b)-(h) (2006)); Directive No. 4040, VIII.\n\n13   Pursuant to this expedited procedure, an inmate can report an\n\n14   alleged incident of harassment to the employee’s supervisor.\n\n15   Such a report does not, however, “preclude submission of a formal\n\n16   grievance.”    N.Y.C.R.R. § 701.11(b)(1) (1994) (now codified as\n\n17   amended and renumbered at N.Y.C.R.R. § 701.8(a) (2006));\n\n18   Directive No. 4040, VIII(A).    Any allegation of employee\n\n19   misconduct or harassment is to be given a grievance number,\n\n20   recorded with all other grievances in the grievance log and\n\n21   forwarded to the superintendent for his consideration.\n\n22   N.Y.C.R.R. § 701.11(b)(2) (1994) (now codified as amended and\n\n23   renumbered at N.Y.C.R.R. § 701.8(b) (2006)); Directive No. 4040,\n\n                                       15\n\f 1   VIII(B).   If the superintendent (or his or her designee)\n\n 2   concludes that the grievance is not a “bona fide case of\n\n 3   harassment,” the superintendent returns the grievance to the\n\n 4   ordinary procedure.   N.Y.C.R.R. § 701.11(b)(3) (1994) (now\n\n 5   codified as amended and renumbered at N.Y.C.R.R. § 701.8(c)\n\n 6   (2006)); Directive No. 4040, VIII(C).   If the grievance presents\n\n 7   a “bona fide harassment issue,” the superintendent can elect to:\n\n 8   (i) initiate an in-house investigation, (ii) request an\n\n 9   investigation by the Inspector General’s Office; or (iii) in the\n\n10   event of criminal activity, request an investigation by the New\n\n11   York State Police.    N.Y.C.R.R. § 701.11(b)(4) (now codified as\n\n12   amended and renumbered at N.Y.C.R.R. § 701.8(d) (2006)) Directive\n\n13   No. 4040, VIII(D).    An inmate can then appeal the\n\n14   superintendent’s determination to the CORC, provided she does so\n\n15   within four days.    See N.Y.C.R.R. § 701.11(b)(6)-(7) (1994) (now\n\n16   codified as amended at N.Y.C.R.R. § 701.8(g)-(h) (2006) (now\n\n17   providing an inmate with seven days to appeal to the CORC)); see\n\n18   also Directive No. 4040, VIII(E)-(G).\n\n19        The class action complaint contains allegations about the\n\n20   actual practices followed under the IGP.   Upon arrival at DOCS,\n\n21   it is alleged, female prisoners receive an orientation to DOCS\n\n22   policies and practices.   The orientation encourages inmates to\n\n23   lodge sexual misconduct complaints with any official, including\n\n                                      16\n\f 1   the Inspector General (“IG”), as well as DOCS supervisory staff\n\n 2   and employees, whether orally or in writing.            The IG’s Office,\n\n 3   and in particular, its Sex Crimes Unit, is alleged by the\n\n 4   complaint to be the alternative administrative mechanism DOCS\n\n 5   established to handle complaints of staff abuse.             The Sex Crimes\n\n 6   Unit receives more than 200 complaints of sexual misconduct every\n\n 7   year.       According to the complaint, it is DOCS’ standard practice\n\n 8   to refer such complaints to the IG for investigation, whether\n\n 9   initiated by formal grievance or informal complaint.              DOCS’\n\n10   ensuing response is also alleged to be inadequate by failing to\n\n11   initiate an investigation in a timely manner, failing to\n\n12   adequately investigate and credit inmate complaints, failing to\n\n13   maintain confidentiality, and failing to address any\n\n14   substantiated allegations meaningfully.\n\n15           According to appellants, inmates at DOCS facilities are\n\n16   provided with various materials regarding DOCS policies and\n\n17   procedures with respect to sexual abuse complaints.4             For\n\n18   example, at Bedford Hills, the intake facility for all female\n\n19   inmates, see DOCS Directive No. 0046, the Orientation Manual\n\n20   urges female inmates to “report [sexual abuse] . . . to a\n\n\n\n             4\n             Not   all inmate orientation manuals expressly address sexual\n     misconduct;   some simply explicate the IGP. See Albion Correctional Facility\n     Orientation   Manual 9-10 (2002); Taconic Correctional Facility Inmate\n     Orientation   Manual 62-64 (2000).\n\n                                            17\n\f 1   supervisor immediately, go to grievance and make a record of the\n\n 2   allegation, and write to the Superintendent or any official that\n\n 3   you are comfortable approaching.      Write to the Inspector General\n\n 4   . . . if you feel more comfortable going directly outside the\n\n 5   facility.”   Bedford Hills Correctional Facility Inmate\n\n 6   Orientation Manual 3 (1999); see also Bedford Hills Correctional\n\n 7   Facility Inmate Orientation Manual 3 (2000)(same); Bedford Hills\n\n 8   Correctional Facility Inmate Orientation Manual 4 (2003)\n\n 9   (“[R]eport [sexual misconduct] to any member of [Bedford Hill’s]\n\n10   Executive Team or to Inmate Grievance”).      The record demonstrates\n\n11   that the policies conveyed by the inmate orientation manuals to\n\n12   female inmates are reinforced through memoranda and postings at\n\n13   the various prison facilities.     Staff consistently testified that\n\n14   it was DOCS policy to allow women with complaints regarding\n\n15   sexual abuse to report such incidents to a variety of DOCS staff\n\n16   and officials.\n\n17        The Bedford Hills Orientation Manual also describes the IGP,\n\n18   explaining that a “grievance is a complaint about the substance\n\n19   or application of any written or unwritten policy, regulation,\n\n20   procedure, or rule of the facility or department, or the lack of\n\n21   a policy or procedure.”   Bedford Hills Correctional Facility\n\n22   Inmate Orientation Manual 36 (1999); see also Bedford Hills\n\n23   Correctional Facility Inmate Orientation Manual 41 (2000);\n\n                                      18\n\f 1   Bedford Hills Correctional Facility Inmate Orientation Manual 4\n\n 2   (2003).\n\n 3        On this record, it is clear that, under DOCS policies and\n\n 4   procedures, an IG investigation of alleged acts of sexual abuse\n\n 5   is an integral part of the internal grievance procedure.    The\n\n 6   record contains testimony and email correspondence indicating\n\n 7   that DOCS instructs its staff not to conduct any investigation\n\n 8   into sexual abuse and that the grievance procedure operates only\n\n 9   as a pass-through to the Sex Crimes Unit.   Indeed, women\n\n10   prisoners who did pursue relief through the IGP were told that\n\n11   their complaints had been forwarded to the IG for investigation\n\n12   and appropriate action.   All thirteen appellants had their\n\n13   allegations of sexual misconduct investigated by the IG, no\n\n14   matter how initiated.5\n\n15        It is clear, therefore, that the first step in the grievance\n\n16   procedure for an inmate alleging sexual abuse is an IG\n\n17   investigation, whether or not a request for policy/procedure\n\n18   reform is included.   Such allegations, when presented to a\n\n\n          5\n            The district court stated that “[e]ach Plaintiff alleges\n     that she complained to the Inspector General about her sexual\n     abuse.” The court found that Tonie Coggins, Stephanie Dawson,\n     and Kristina Muehleisen complained to the immediate supervisor of\n     the alleged abuser. The court also found that Stephanie Dawson,\n     Tanya Jones, Laura Pullen, Corilynn Rock, Denise Saffioti, and\n     Shenyell Smith all grieved to a DOCS official that “they felt\n     comfortable approaching.”\n\n                                     19\n\f 1   superintendent, were routinely referred to the IG.    Moreover, an\n\n 2   IG determination about abuse of an inmate can be appealed to CORC\n\n 3   when the determination is reported to and accepted by the\n\n 4   superintendent.\n\n 5           The grievance procedures are further complicated when\n\n 6   challenges to DOCS policies concerning sexual misconduct are\n\n 7   made.    As noted, the regulations governing the IGP specifically\n\n 8   contemplate its use to pursue challenges to existing policies as\n\n 9   well as challenges that a policy should be created where one does\n\n10   not exist.     See N.Y.C.R.R. § 701.2(a) (defining grievance as “a\n\n11   complaint about the substance or application of any written or\n\n12   unwritten policy . . . or the lack of a policy”).    As noted,\n\n13   appellants’ complaint asserts just such a challenge.\n\n14           However, an inmate may not challenge a policy, or lack\n\n15   thereof, without a showing of concrete injury, N.Y.C.R.R. §\n\n16   701.3(b), in this case an act of sexual abuse.    Three appellants\n\n17   filed such grievances and appealed through all levels of the IGP\n\n18   procedure:    Shenyell Smith, Stephanie Dawson, and Shantelle\n\n19   Smith.    All three had their grievances investigated by the IG.\n\n20   When the allegation of an act of abuse is combined with a claim\n\n21   for reform of policies and the abuse determination is unfavorable\n\n22   to the inmate, both claims can be pursued on appeal from the IG\n\n23   or superintendent to CORC.    But, it appears on this record that\n\n                                       20\n\f 1   CORC does not entertain the claim for policy change unless the\n\n 2   allegation of an act(s) of sexual abuse is upheld.   In these\n\n 3   three cases, the allegations of acts of sexual abuse were denied.\n\n 4   In none of the three cases did any correctional official or\n\n 5   tribunal ever mention the grievances’ challenge to policies and\n\n 6   procedures.\n\n 7   c) Mootness of the Injunctive Claims\n\n 8        Of course, a class action cannot be sustained without a\n\n 9   named plaintiff who has standing.

Because the claims of\n\n16   all plaintiffs were then dismissed for either mootness or a\n\n17   failure to exhaust, the district court stated “[t]here is no need\n\n18   to grant Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification, which is\n\n19   hereby denied.”   Amador, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4326747</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at *9.\n\n20        We conclude that the relation-back doctrine applies to the\n\n21   claims of the plaintiffs who have been released and preserves\n\n22   their claims for adjudication for purposes of a class action.\n\n23\n\n                                     21\n\f 1          The standing requirement winnows out disputes that would be\n\n 2   inappropriate for judicial resolution for lack of three\n\n 3   constitutionally required elements:   (i) an injury in fact (ii)\n\n 4   that is fairly traceable to the defendant and (iii) that is\n\n 5   likely to be redressed by a favorable decision.

Id.\n\n11        In both Sosna and Gerstein, the mootness of the named\n\n12   representative’s claim arose after certification of a class.\n\n13   Each decision noted that the usual case required a live\n\n14   controversy at the time of the filing of the complaint and the\n\n15   class certification.

Sosna, however, recognized that in certain\n\n17   cases, the claims of the named plaintiffs might become moot\n\n18   before the district court had ruled on a certification motion:\n\n19   “In such instances, whether the certification can be said to\n\n20   ‘relate back’ to the filing of the complaint may depend upon the\n\n21   circumstances of the particular case and especially the reality\n\n22   of the claim that otherwise the issue would evade review.”      419\n\n23   U.S. at 402 n.11.\n\n                                      23\n\f 1        We have applied the relation-back theory to recipients of\n\n 2   public assistance alleging that action on their applications for\n\n 3   public assistance was unlawfully delayed by the state.

According to the supervisory\n\n 2   appellees, there is nothing inherently transitory about\n\n 3   appellants’ claims because inmates serve a range of terms of\n\n 4   imprisonment.   Thus, they argue, while some inmates may be\n\n 5   released before their claims can be adjudicated, others will\n\n 6   remain incarcerated long enough for courts to adjudicate their\n\n 7   claims.   We disagree.\n\n 8        We have previously observed that “a significant\n\n 9   characteristic” of claims subject to the “capable of repetition,\n\n10   yet evading review” exception is that the mootness resulted from\n\n11   “a factor closely related to the essence of the claim.”     Swan v.\n\n12   Stoneman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"384547\"><a href=\"/opinion/384547/john-l-swan-on-behalf-of-himself-and-on-behalf-of-all-others-similarly/\"><span class=\"volume\">635</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 102 n.6 (2d Cir. 1980).     As such, these\n\n13   claims “involve[] issues that [are] likely to evade review, no\n\n14   matter who prosecute[s] them.”    Id.   Although a close issue, we\n\n15   conclude that this exception applies.\n\n16        This action is brought on behalf of all women inmates in\n\n17   DOCS custody, alleging constitutionally defective policies and\n\n18   procedures in failing to protect female inmates from sexual\n\n19   harassment, abuse, and assault by male staff.    While the entire\n\n20   class may be exposed to the risks caused by the constitutionally\n\n21   defective policies and procedures alleged, as noted, the\n\n22   grievance procedure may be triggered only by an inmate who has\n\n23   been a victim of sexual misconduct.     Because the number of\n\n                                       25\n\f 1   inmates subjected to acts of misconduct can be a small fraction\n\n 2   of the total inmates at risk, the odds of an inmate being able to\n\n 3   complete the grievance procedure and litigate a class action\n\n 4   while still incarcerated are rather small.            All thirteen\n\n 5   appellants were in DOCS custody when they commenced the action;\n\n 6   only four remained incarcerated when the district court rendered\n\n 7   its September 13, 2005 decision.6           Four appellants have been\n\n 8   released and subsequently reincarcerated during the course of\n\n 9   these proceedings,7 and of these, only two, remained in custody\n\n10   following the filing of the notice of appeal.8\n\n11         Accordingly, we conclude that it was error for the district\n\n12   court to dismiss as moot the claims of the individual plaintiffs\n\n13   who had been released from prison after the filing of the amended\n\n14   complaint.

However, her affidavit also states that she\n\n 2   informed the IG that sexual abuse was a problem affecting other\n\n 3   inmates and that no one kept track of what the officers were\n\n 4   doing.     We believe that this complaint sufficiently raises\n\n 5   systemic issues relating to policies and procedures regarding the\n\n 6   prevention of sexual abuse.    To be sure, she did not ask for the\n\n 7   precise relief sought in this action, but she adequately alerted\n\n 8   the authorities as to her claim of systemic issues.    However,\n\n 9   Calloway did not appeal to CORC, which is the final step in the\n\n10   grievance procedure for raising issues regarding DOCS polices.\n\n11   The issue, then, is whether her failure to exhaust should be\n\n12   excused.\n\n13        In Hemphill v. New York, we established a three-part inquiry\n\n14   to guide the analysis of whether a plaintiff has met the\n\n15   requirements of Section 1997e(a) of the PLRA.    380 F.3d at 686.\n\n16   The first part, which is not an issue here, is a determination\n\n17   that administrative remedies were in fact available to the\n\n18   prisoner.    Id. at 686-88.   The second part considers whether\n\n19   defendants forfeited the affirmative defense of non-exhaustion by\n\n20   failing to raise or preserve it, or whether defendants’ own\n\n21   actions inhibiting the inmate’s exhaustion of remedies estops one\n\n22   or more of the defendants from raising the exhaustion defense.\n\n23   Id. at 686, 688-89.    The third part requires consideration of\n\n                                       28\n\f 1   whether, if the requirements of step two were not met, special\n\n 2   circumstances excuse the plaintiff’s failure to pursue or exhaust\n\n 3   administrative remedies.   Id. at 686, 689-91.   If any of the\n\n 4   three parts is satisfied, the prisoner is deemed to have\n\n 5   exhausted internal procedures for purposes of the PLRA.\n\n 6        Subsequent decisions have questioned the continued viability\n\n 7   of this framework following the Supreme Court’s decision in\n\n 8   Woodford v.

No such conduct prevented\n\n17   Calloway from appealing to CORC.      Nor were there special\n\n18   circumstances relieving Calloway of the obligation to exhaust the\n\n19   IGP procedures.   It is clear that challenges to DOCS policies or\n\n20   lack thereof, the subject matter of this lawsuit -- where coupled\n\n21   with a claim of sexual abuse -- must be pursued through the CORC\n\n22   level.    While this is a somewhat complex scheme, it hardly\n\n\n\n\n                                      30\n\f 1   constitutes special circumstances.    Calloway’s grievance was thus\n\n 2   not exhausted.\n\n 3        Two other appellants, whose complaints were dismissed as\n\n 4   moot but to which we have applied the relation-back doctrine,\n\n 5   Shantelle Smith and Sheynell Smith, alleged both assaults and a\n\n 6   failure to protect and completed the grievance procedure.\n\n 7        Shenyell Smith wrote a letter addressed “To Whom It May\n\n 8   Concern” that was logged as a grievance on January 3, 2002.    The\n\n 9   letter alleged that she had been harassed for a period of three\n\n10   months, retaliated against, and sexually assaulted by an officer.\n\n11   With respect to the relief sought, she stated, “This officer is\n\n12   still working on this unit and its not right.    I feel that [the\n\n13   officer] should seek counseling [and be] removed . . . , fired\n\n14   and any other [precaution] that is there.”     The superintendent\n\n15   responded that “[a] significant portion of this complaint has to\n\n16   do with issues turned over to the Inspector General’s Office for\n\n17   investigation in accordance with Departmental procedures.\n\n18   Grievance denied in that no basis was found for your\n\n19   allegations.”    She appealed the grievance.   On February 20, 2002,\n\n20   CORC denied it, stating, “Upon full hearing of the facts and\n\n21   circumstances in the instant case, the action requested herein is\n\n22   hereby denied.   CORC upholds the determination of the\n\n23   Superintendent for the reasons stated.”\n\n                                      31\n\f 1         Shantelle Smith filed a grievance with the IGRC on July 10,\n\n 2   2003, alleging a sexual assault by an officer.           With respect to\n\n 3   corrective action, she stated, “I am seeking monetary damages for\n\n 4   the reason that the State had a duty to protect me and failed to\n\n 5   do so, thus rendering their misactions as a ‘Failure to Protect’,\n\n 6   a most serious dereliction of their duty to provide for my care,\n\n 7   custody and control.”      On July 11, 2003, the superintendent\n\n 8   responded, neither granting nor denying the grievance, stating\n\n 9   only, “Your grievance has been forwarded to the Inspector\n\n10   General’s office for further investigation.”           Shantelle appealed,\n\n11   and on September 10, 2003, CORC denied the grievance, stating,\n\n12   “CORC upholds the determination of the Superintendent for the\n\n13   reasons stated.     CORC notes that the grievant’s allegation of\n\n14   sexual misconduct . . . has been forwarded to the appropriate\n\n15   Central Office personnel for investigation.           Any action deemed\n\n16   necessary and appropriate will be taken as a result of that\n\n17   investigation.”     That disposition states that any final action\n\n18   would be taken by the IG.       No favorable action was taken by the\n\n19   IG, and we deem the grievance procedure exhausted.10\n\n20         Each of these inmates completed the IGP procedure.            The\n\n21   issue is whether a claim of a failure to protect is sufficient\n\n           10\n              CORC’s response to Shenyell Smith’s and Shantelle Smith’s appeals was\n     identical to its response to Stephanie Dawson’s appeal, discussed infra.\n     Appellees agree that Dawson exhausted the grievance procedure.\n\n                                          32\n\f 1   exhaustion with regard to litigation seeking systemic relief.\n\n 2   The issue, in our view, is whether a reasonable corrections\n\n 3   official would recognize a complaint alleging a failure to\n\n 4   protect a female inmate from a sexual assault by a male officer\n\n 5   as raising issues regarding DOCS policies and procedures.    We\n\n 6   believe that it would.    To be sure, a “grievance may not be so\n\n 7   vague as to preclude prison officials from taking appropriate\n\n 8   measures to resolve the complaint internally.”    Brownell, 446\n\n 9   F.3d at 310.    However, a failure to protect involves conduct by\n\n10   officials superior to the officer accused of the misconduct and\n\n11   suggests the need for policy and procedural reform.    While the\n\n12   complaint asks for a result -- protection -- rather than\n\n13   specifying the means used to reach that result, the need for the\n\n14   result is clearly articulated and the appropriate means are far\n\n15   more within the expertise of DOCS than the individual prisoner.\n\n16           A fourth appellant, Stephanie Dawson, clearly alleged an act\n\n17   of sexual misconduct, clearly sought systemic reform along the\n\n18   lines of the class action complaint, and clearly exhausted the\n\n19   IGP procedure.    Her claim was dismissed as moot by the district\n\n20   court but is now revived by application of the relation-back\n\n21   doctrine.\n\n22           Dawson filed her grievance with the IGRC on February 25,\n\n23   2003.    She alleged that she was raped by an officer at the prison\n\n                                       33\n\f 1   where she was incarcerated.    In describing her grievance, she\n\n 2   stated, “Taconic didn’t provide protection from Correctional\n\n 3   Officer sexual assault on me.”    Dawson requested various relief\n\n 4   including:   (i) “For DOCS to train and assign and supervise staff\n\n 5   so that [she would] not again [be] subjected to this kind of\n\n 6   abuse”; (ii) “For DOCS to conduct a full and complete\n\n 7   investigation”; (iii) “That [the officer] should be disciplined”;\n\n 8   and (iv) “That [she] continue to receive mental health\n\n 9   counseling.”    In response, the superintendent concluded that “an\n\n10   investigation by the DOCS Inspector General’s Office is in\n\n11   progress.”     When Dawson sought to appeal, she was advised that an\n\n12   appeal would be “redundant.”    Dawson nonetheless pressed her\n\n13   appeal, and CORC upheld the superintendent’s decision.    CORC\n\n14   noted that “the complaint has been forwarded to the appropriate\n\n15   Department personnel for investigation.    Any action deemed\n\n16   necessary will be taken as a result of the investigation.”\n\n17        The parties agree that Dawson’s grievance was both\n\n18   procedurally and substantively exhausted.     Because Dawson’s role\n\n19   as plaintiff is not mooted by her release for reasons stated\n\n20   supra, she is entitled to pursue a role as class representative.\n\n21        Our conclusion that the district court erred when it failed\n\n22   to relate those claims it deemed moot back to the filing of the\n\n23   complaint does not automatically establish that the three\n\n                                       34\n\f 1   appellants affected, Stephanie Dawson, Shantelle Smith, and\n\n 2   Sheynell Smith, are entitled to litigate the interests of the\n\n 3   class they seek to represent.   See Sosna, 419 U.S. at 403 (“This\n\n 4   conclusion does not automatically establish that appellant is\n\n 5   entitled to litigate the interests of the class she seeks to\n\n 6   represent, but it does shift the focus of examination from the\n\n 7   elements of justiciability to the ability of the named\n\n 8   representative to ‘fairly and adequately protect the interests of\n\n 9   the class.’” (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a))).   In a separate\n\n10   proceeding, a previous panel of this court denied appellants’\n\n11   application for leave to appeal the denial of class certification\n\n12   by the district court. Accordingly, the propriety of class\n\n13   certification is not before us.\n\n14                              CONCLUSION\n\n15        We dismiss the damages claims for lack of jurisdiction.     We\n\n16   vacate the judgment of the district court with respect to the\n\n17   claims designated in this opinion, and remand for further\n\n18   proceedings consistent with the opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                       35\n\f</pre>",
