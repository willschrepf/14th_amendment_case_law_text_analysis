GARZA and STEWART, Circuit Judges.\n\n       STEWART, Circuit Judge:\n\n       We must decide whether certain provisions of Act 1254 (codified at La. R.S. 40:1299.35.5\n\n(West Supp.1996)), which changed Louisiana's judicial bypass procedure for minors seeking\n\nabortions, comports with the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. We hold that it\n\ndoes not and affirm the district court's summary judgment which permanently enjoined La. R.S.\n\n40:1299.35.5(B).\n\n                                LEGISLATIVE BACKGROUND\n\n       In Louisiana, minors under the age of eighteen must obtain the consent of at least one parent\n\nor legal guardian before a physician has the legal authority to perform an abortion. La. R.S.\n\n40:1299.35.5(A) (West 1992). However, a physician may perform the abortion without the consent\n\nof a parent or legal guardian if t he minor exercises her rights under a judicial bypass procedure\n\nprescribed in La. R.S. 40:1299.35.5(B). Section 1299.35.5(B) has, since 1978, undergone changes.\n\nBecause this appeal largely turns on the 1995 changes to § 1299.35.5(B), we bel ieve that a brief\n\nreview of the legislative history of § 1299.35.5(B) sheds valuable light on the issues before us.\n\nA. The 1978 Version of La. R.S. 40:1299.35.5(B)\n\n       We begin in 1978, when the Louisiana Legislature enacted La. R.S. 40:1299.35.5 (the 1978\n\fAct), which, among other things, regulated the circumstances under which minors could obtain\n\nabortions. Notably, the 1978 Act, while providing for a judicial bypass, gave little (if any) guidance\n\nto courts faced with minors seeking abortions. Subsection (A) of the 1978 Act, titled \"Notice and\n\nconsent,\" provided that the parents or legal guardian of a minor under eighteen must receive actual\n\nnotice twenty-four hours before the minor had an abortion or, if the parent or legal guardian could\n\nnot be reached, that parent or legal guardian must receive constructive notice seventy-two hours\n\nbefore the abortion. The sole exception to these parental notification requirements was a bare-bones\n\njudicial bypass provision, which stated simply \"unless the abortion is ordered by a court having\n\njurisdiction over such minor pregnant woman.\" Subsection (B) provided that if the minor was under\n\nthe age of fifteen, she must obtain informed, written consent from a parent or legal guardian or\n\n\"obtain[ ] an order from a court having jurisdiction over her that the abortion be performed or\n\ninduced.\" Neither subsection (A) nor (B) provided any criteria that must be met before a judge could,\n\nwithout any notice to the parent(s) or legal guardian(s), order a minor to have an abortion.\n\n        Then, in 1979, the Supreme Court handed down Bellotti v. Baird, 443 U.S. 622, 99 S.Ct.\n\n3035, 61 L.Ed.2d 797 (1979) (Bellotti II ), in which a plurality of the Court set forth the standards\n\nthat should govern the judicial bypass procedure for minors seeking abortions. Recognizing the\n\nparent-child tension that may accompany a minor's wish to have an abortion, the Court held that a\n\nminor may seek an order from a court, without the consent or notification of a parent or legal\n\nguardian, that authorizes the procedure. Id. at 646-48, 99 S.Ct. at 3049-51. In particular, the Court\n\nheld:\n\n        If she satisfies the court that she is mature and well enough informed to make intelligently the\n        abortion decision on her own, the court must authorize her to act without parental\n        consultation or consent. If she fails to satisfy the court that she is competent to make this\n        decision independently, she must be permitted to show that an abortion nevertheless would\n        be in her best interests. If the court is persuaded that it is, the court must authorize the\n        abortion.\n\nId. at 647-48, 99 S.Ct. at 3050 (emphasis added). Approximately eight months after Bellotti II was\n\ndecided, Louisiana's skeletal judicial bypass provision was struck down as inconsistent with Bellotti\n\nII. In Margaret S. v. Edwards, 488 F.Supp. 181, 203 (E.D.La.1980) (Margaret S.(I) ), the district\n\ncourt held: \"This section [§ 1299.35.5(B) ] says nothing more than the pregnant minor may receive\n\fan order from a \"court having jurisdiction over her that the abortion be performed or induced.' This\n\nis not enough.... La.Rev.Stat.Ann. § 40:1299.35.5(B) sets forth no standards or guidelines for the\n\nminor seeking judicial approval for abortion.\"\n\nB. The 1980 and 1981 Versions of La. R.S. 40:1299.35.5(B)\n\n       In 1980, the Louisiana Legislature responded to Margaret S.(I) and, among other things,\n\nchanged La. R.S. 40:1299.35.5(B) to comply with Bellotti II. Most importantly for purposes of this\n\nappeal, the new statute contained the mandatory language from the Bellotti II decision. La. R.S.\n\n40:1299.35.5(B) provided in part: \"The court shall authorize the abortion only if the court finds that\n\nthe woman is sufficiently mature and well-informed to make an intelligent decision on her own\n\nconcerning the abortion, or, if the court finds that regardless of the capacity of the woman to make\n\nthe decision, the abortion would be in her best interest.\" (Emphasis added). The 1980 version also\n\nincluded an expediency clause: \"Such applications shall be heard summarily and expeditiously and\n\nshall take precedence over matters on the docket of the court.\" (Emphasis added).\n\n       In 1981, Louisiana modified its abortion statute, beginning with a general statement of\n\nlegislative intent. Section 1299.35.0 (West 1992) provided in part: \"It is the intention of the\n\nLegislature of the State of Louisiana to regulate abortion to the extent permitted by decisions of the\n\nUnited States Supreme Court.\" In 1981, the legislature also refined and expanded § 1299.35.5(B),\n\nand the pertinent sections read as follows:\n\n       (3) Each application shall be heard in chambers, confidentially, in a summary manner, and\n       within forty-eight hours of the filing thereof.\n\n       (4) If the court finds that the minor is sufficiently mature and well enough informed to make\n       the decision concerning the abortion on her own, the court shall issue an order authorizing\n       the minor to act on the matter without parental consultation or consent.\n\n       (5) If the court finds that the minor is not competent to make the decision concerning the\n       abortion on her own, but finds that the abortion nevertheless would be in the best interest of\n       the minor, the court shall issue an order authorizing the abortion.\n\n(Emphasis added). Subsections (4) and (5) parsed out the \"maturity and well-informed\" provision\n\nand the \"best-interests-of-the-minor\" inquiry. As with the 1980 version, the 1981 version of §\n\n1299.35.5(B) retained the mandatory \"shall\" language. However, the word \"expeditiously\" was\n\nremoved and a forty-eight hour time frame for hearing a minor's application was imposed. With these\n\fnew changes in place, § 1299.35.5(B) survived a constitutional attack the next time around. See\n\nMargaret S. v. Treen, 597 F.Supp. 636, 650-52 (E.D.La.1984) (Margaret S. (II) ), aff'd on other\n\ngrounds sub nom. Margaret S. v. Edwards, 794 F.2d 994 (5th Cir.1986).1\n\nC. Act 1254—The 1995 Version of La. R.S. 40:1299.35.5(B)\n\n       And so it was for fourteen years. In 1995, however, the Louisiana Legislature went back to\n\nthe drawing board with Act 1254, which expanded and changed § 1299.35.5(B) to read in part:\n\n       (3) Each application shall be heard in chambers, anonymously, in a summary manner, and\n       within forty-eight hours of the filing thereof.\n\n       (4) If the court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that the minor is sufficiently mature\n       and well enough informed to make the decision concerning the abortion on her own, the court\n       may issue an order authorizing the minor to act on the matter. Prior to any such order, the\n       court may require the minor to participate in an evaluation and counseling session with a\n       mental health professional from the Department of Health and Hospitals, office of mental\n       health, and a staff member from the Department of Social Services, office of community\n       services. The court may refer the petitioner, if necessary, to the appropriate Department of\n       Health and Hospitals, office of mental health regional office to arrange the evaluation and\n       counseling session within forty-eight hours of the ex parte hearing, excluding legal holidays.\n\n       (5) If the court finds that the minor is not sufficiently mature and well enough informed to\n       make a decision intelligently among the alternatives, the court shall decide whether or not it\n       would be in the best interest of the minor to notify her parents or guardian of the proceedings.\n       If the court finds that it is in the minor's best interest to notify her parents or guardian, the\n       court shall so notify and reconvene the proceedings within forty-eight hours with the parents\n       or guardian present to advise and counsel the minor and aid the court in making its\n       determination whether or not the abortion would be in the best interest of the minor.\n\n       (6) If the court finds that the minor is not competent to make the decision concerning the\n       abortion or that it would not be in the minor's best interest to notify her parents or guardian,\n       the court may issue an order authorizing the abo rtion if the court finds, by clear and\n       convincing evidence, that the abortion would be in the best interest of the minor.\n\n(Emphasis added). Three changes to Louisiana's bypass procedure are relevant for purposes of this\n\nappeal:2 (1) in subsections (4) and (6) (which correspond to subsections (4) and (5), respectively,\n\n\n   1\n    The district court in Margaret S. (II) stated that the 1981 judicial bypass procedure provided\nfor an \"expeditious hearing of the matter....\" 597 F.Supp. at 652. As we have noted, however,\nthe word \"expeditious[ ]\" was removed from the 1981 statute. The district court did not consider\nthe meaning of \"summary manner\" as defined under Louisiana law to determine whether the new\nsubsection (3) met the Bellotti II expedition requirement.\n   2\n    Although the plaintiffs challenged and the district court enjoined the expediency provision in\nsubsection (3), that subpart largely remained unchanged in Act 1254. The legislature only\nchanged \"confidentially\" to \"anonymously.\" This particular change has not been challenged by the\nplaintiffs.\n\fin the 1981 statute), \"shall\" has been changed to \"may,\" so that if the juvenile court finds that a minor\n\nis mature and well-informed or that an abortion would be in the minor's best interest, the court now\n\n\"may\" order an abortion; (2) subsection (4) permits judges to refer a minor to a state-sponsored\n\ncounseling and evaluation session within forty-eight hours of the ex parte hearing; and (3) subsection\n\n(5) states that a juvenile court judge is compelled to notify the parents or guardian of an immature\n\nminor if doing so is in the best interest of the minor.\n\n                                      PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n        On July 6, 1995, Causeway Medical Suite and Hope Medical Group for Women (plaintiffs)\n\nfiled suit challenging the constitutionality of Act 1254. The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief, claiming\n\nthat Act 1254 violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because Act 1254 (1)\n\nprovided juvenile court judges discretion to deny a minor an abortion even though the minor\n\ndemonstrated that she was mature and well-informed or that the abortion would be in her best\n\ninterest; (2) failed to establish a time limit for an expeditious resolution of the minor's bypass\n\napplication; (3) allowed the juvenile court to refer minors to state-sponsored evaluation and\n\ncounseling without providing any time frame within which counselors are to report back to the court,\n\nthereby depriving minors of an effective opportunity to obtain an abortion and preventing the minor\n\nfrom remaining anonymous; and (4) breached the minor's confidentiality by permitting the juvenile\n\ncourt to notify the minor's parent that she is seeking an abortion if the court finds such notification\n\nwould be in the minor's best interest.\n\n        With one exception,3 the district court agreed with the plaintiffs on each of these points. 905\n\nF.Supp. 360, 364-66 (E.D.La.1995). Acco rdingly, the district court entered summary judgment,\n\npermanently enjoining Act 1254 because it \"constitute[d] an undue burden on the right of minors to\n\nhave access to abortion services by way of a judicial bypass of the parental consent requirement and\n\nthus violates the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\" Id. at 366. This appeal\n\n   3\n    The district court did not rule on the plaintiff's claim that the state-sponsored counseling\nprovision impermissibly breached anonymity. On appeal, the plaintiffs resurrect this argument.\nWe decline to address this claim, however, because it is unnecessary to the disposition of this\ncase. The counseling and evaluation provision is facially unconstitutional for another reason\ndiscussed in Part IV.A.2, infra.\n\ffollowed.\n\n                                           DISCUSSION\n\n       The State makes three claims on appeal. First, it claims that the plaintiffs do not have standing\n\nto bring this lawsuit because there is no \"case or controversy .\" Second, the State argues that the\n\nproper standard of proof for facial challenges requires plaintiffs to demonstrate that Act 1254, under\n\nno set of circumstances, is constitutional. Third, and central to this appeal, the State contends that\n\neach of the challenged provisions is facially constitutional. We reject each of these contentions.\n\nI. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n        We review the district court's decision to permanently enjoin Act 1254 for an abuse of\n\ndiscretion. North Alamo Water Supply Corp. v. City of San Juan, 90 F.3d 910, 916 (5th Cir.1996).\n\n\"The district court abuses it s discretion if it (1) relies on clearly erroneous factual findings when\n\ndeciding to grant or deny the permanent injunction, (2) relies on erroneous conclusions of law when\n\ndeciding to grant or deny the permanent injunction, or (3) misapplies the factual or legal conclusions\n\nwhen fashioning its injunctive relief.\" Id. at 916-17. \" \"The standard of review over the district\n\ncourt's grant of a permanent injunction must, of course, be segmented according to the component\n\nfunctions performed by the district court.' \" Peaches Entertainment Corp. v. Entertainment\n\nRepertoire Assocs., Inc., 62 F.3d 690, 693 (5th Cir.1995) (quoting Multnomah Legal Serv. Workers\n\nUnion v. Legal Serv. Corp., 936 F.2d 1547, 1552 (9th Cir.1991)).\n\n       This case comes to us from a grant of summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs. We review\n\nde novo the district court's entry of summary judgment. TLI, Inc. v. United States, 100 F.3d 424, 425\n\n(5th Cir.1996).\n\nII. JURISDICTION AND STANDING\n\n        The State suggests that there is no \"case or controversy\" because the state officials named\n\nin this lawsuit do not have \"the power to enforce private-action court procedures.\" As such, the State\n\nconcludes, the injunction in this case is \"hypothetical and meaningless.\" We reject these claims. The\n\nplaintiffs in this case have standing to assert the claims of those minors who seek abortions by way\n\nof a judicial bypass. See Planned Parenthood of Southeastern, Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 842-45,\n\f112 S.Ct. 2791, 2803, 120 L.Ed.2d 674 (1992). And the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to\n\n28 U.S.C. § 1343 because the plaintiffs seek redress for a deprivation of a constitutional right under\n\ncolor of state law.\n\nIII. THE STANDARD OF PROOF FOR FACIAL CHALLENGES TO ABORTION STATUTES\n\n        The plaintiffs in this case have brought a facial challenge, claiming that Act 1254 on its face\n\nviolates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Supreme Court has articulated\n\ntwo approaches to proving a statute is facially unconstitutional. In United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S.\n\n739, 107 S.Ct. 2095, 95 L.Ed.2d 697 (1987), the Court held that in a facial challenge, \"the challenger\n\nmust establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid.\" Id. at 745,\n\n107 S.Ct. at 2100 (emphasis added). However, in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey,\n\n505 U.S. 833, 112 S.Ct. 2791, 120 L.Ed.2d 674 (1992), the Court appeared to temper the Salerno\n\nstandard by suggesting that an abortion law is facially invalid if \"in a large fraction of the cases in\n\nwhich [the law] is relevant, it will operate as a substantial obstacle to a woman's choice to undergo\n\nan abortion.\" Id. at 895, 112 S.Ct. at 2830 (emphasis added). Plainly, more statutes will survive a\n\nfacial attack under Salerno than under Casey.\n\n        Shortly after Casey was decided, we held in Barnes v. Moore, 970 F.2d 12, 14 n. 2 (5th Cir.),\n\ncert. denied, 506 U.S. 1021, 113 S.Ct. 656, 121 L.Ed.2d 582 (1992), that Casey did not overrule\n\nSalerno. Since our decision in Barnes, however, no clear consensus among federal courts has\n\nemerged regarding the standard for facial challenges in a post-Casey world. Six Justices from the\n\nSupreme Court have expressed their views on this issue, but not in cases receiving a full hearing by\n\nthe Court. Justices O'Connor, Souter, and Stevens have made it clear that the Casey standard\n\ncontrols in the abortion context. See Janklow v. Planned Parenthood, Sioux Falls Clinic, --- U.S.\n\n----, ----, 116 S.Ct. 1582, 1583, 134 L.Ed.2d 679 (1996) (Stevens, J., mem. respecting denial of\n\ncertiorari) (\"While a facial challenge may be more difficult to mount than an as-applied challenge, the\n\ndicta in Salerno \"does not accurately characterize the standard for deciding facial challenges,' and\n\n\"neither accurately reflects the Court's practice with respect to facial challenges, nor is it consistent\n\nwith a wide array of legal principles.' \")(quoting Michael C. Dorf, Facial Challenges to State and\n\fFederal Statutes, 46 STAN. L. REV. 235, 236, 238 (1994)); Fargo Women's Health Organization\n\nv. Schafer, 507 U.S. 1013, 1014, 113 S.Ct. 1668, 1669, 123 L.Ed.2d 285 (1993) (O'Connor, J.,\n\njoined by Souter, J., conc. in denial of stay pending appeal) (stating that lower courts' application of\n\nSalerno standard \"is inconsistent with Casey \"). On the other hand, Chief Justice Rehnquist and\n\nJustices Scalia and Thomas have stated that the Salerno standard applies in the abortion context. See\n\nJanklow, --- U.S. at ---- - ----, 116 S.Ct. at 1584-87 (Scalia, J., joined by Rehnquist, C.J. & Thomas,\n\nJ., dissenting from denial of certiorari). There is also considerable disagreement among the lower\n\nfederal courts on this issue.4 See generally Ruth Burdick, Note, The Casey Undue Burden Standard:\n\nProblems Predicted and Encountered, and the Split Over the Salerno Test, 23 HASTINGS CONST.\n\nL.Q. 825 (1996) (arguing that lower federal courts are likely to remain split over the Salerno-Casey\n\nchoice).\n\n       The district court avoided this thicket of disagreement, reasoning that under either approach,\n\nAct 1254 was unconstitutional. 905 F.Supp. at 363 n. 2. As such, the district court applied the more\n\nrigorous Salerno standard. Id. at 363. In this appeal, both parties urge us to confront head-on the\n\nquestion of the standard of proof that should govern facial challenges in abortion cases. Specifically,\n\nthe plaintiffs claim that the statements made by Justices O'Connor and Souter in Fargo Women's\n\nHealth Organization v. Schafer, 507 U.S. at 1014, 113 S.Ct. at 1669, and by Justice Stevens in\n\nJanklow call into doubt our prior holding in Barnes. On the other hand, the State asks us to follow\n\nour previous decision in Barnes because the Supreme Court has not conclusively resolved the\n\nconfusion in this area.\n\n           We are free to reconsider the correctness of a panel opinion, short of the full court sitting en\n\nbanc, if the Supreme Court has handed down an intervening decision that implicitly or explicitly\n\noverrules one of our prior decisions. See Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Dawson, 4 F.3d 1303, 1307\n\n   4\n    Compare Compassion in Dying v. Washington, 79 F.3d 790, 798 n. 9 (9th Cir.1996) (en\nbanc) (holding that Casey displaced Salerno ), cert. granted sub nom. Washington v. Glucksberg,\n--- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 37, 135 L.Ed.2d 1128 (1996) and Planned Parenthood, Sioux Falls\nClinic v. Miller, 63 F.3d 1452, 1456-58 (8th Cir.1995), cert. denied sub nom. Janklow v.\nPlanned Parenthood, Sioux Falls Clinic, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 1582, 134 L.Ed.2d 679 (1996)\n(same) and Casey v. Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa., 14 F.3d 848, 863 n. 21 (3d\nCir.1994) (on remand) (same) with Barnes v. Moore, 970 F.2d at 14 n. 2.\n\f(5th Cir.1993), cert. denied, 512 U.S. 1205, 114 S.Ct. 2673, 129 L.Ed.2d 809 (1994); Campbell\n\nv. Sonat Offshore Drilling, Inc., 979 F.2d 1115, 1121 n. 8 (5th Cir.1992). However, we have not\n\nheld that intermittent statements accompanying denials of certiorari or denials of stays pending appeal\n\namount to an intervening change in the law. The Supreme Court it self has said that \"all opinions\n\ndissenting from the denial of certiorari\" are \"totally unnecessary\" and \"examples of the purest form\n\nof dicta.\" Singleton v. Commissioner, 439 U.S. 940, 944-45, 99 S.Ct. 335, 338, 58 L.Ed.2d 335\n\n(1978) (Stevens, J., respecting the denial of certiorari). Accordingly, for a panel of this court to\n\noverrule a prior decision, we have required a Supreme Court decision that has been fully heard by the\n\nCourt and establishes a rule of law inconsistent with our own. See United States v. Kirk, 528 F.2d\n\n1057, 1063-64 (5th Cir.1976) (holding that two-member concurrence was insufficient as an indicator\n\nthat the Court \"expressly or implicitly\" overruled one of our prior decisions). The wisdom of this\n\npolicy is illustrated here. As far as we can tell, the Court appears to be divided 3-3 on the Salerno-\n\nCasey debate, and it would be ill-advised for us to assume that the Court will abandon Salerno\n\nbecause three members of the Court now desire that result.5\n\n       More to the point, even assuming the statements in Fargo and Janklow amount to an\n\nintervening change in the law such that we may decline to follow Barnes, we nevertheless stay our\n\nhand on this contentious issue because its resolution is not necessary to the disposition of this case,\n\nfor whether viewed under Casey or Salerno, Act 1254 is unconstitutional on its face.6 Thus, like the\n\ndistrict court, we apply the more rigorous Salerno standard to Act 1254.\n\nIV. THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF ACT 1254\n\n       We now turn to the heart of this appeal—whether Act 1254 comports with the Due Process\n\n\n   5\n    The Eighth Circuit boldly declared that the Supreme Court in Casey has \"effectively overruled\nSalerno for facial challenges to abortion statutes.\" Miller, 63 F.3d at 1458. As we have said, we\ndecline to speculate about the outcome of this disagreement between the Justices of the Supreme\nCourt.\n   6\n    We also respectfully decline, for the reasons stated above, Justice Stevens's invitation to\nreconsider the wisdom of our decision in Barnes. See Janklow, --- U.S. at ---- n. 2, 116 S.Ct. at\n1583 n. 2 (Stevens, J., mem. respecting the denial of certiorari) (\"[I]t is not at all clear to me,\ngiven intervening statements by Members of this Court, [citation], that subsequent Fifth Circuit\npanels would follow Barnes ' application of the \"no circumstance' test....\").\n\fClause of the Fourteenth Amendment. We begin with a brief summary of the principles that have\n\nshaped this area and guide our decision today.\n\n       After the Supreme Court declared in Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 93 S.Ct. 705, 35 L.Ed.2d\n\n147 (1973) that women have a constitutional right to an abortion, the issue of where minors fit into\n\nthe constitutional picture was soon addressed by the Court. Thus, in Planned Parenthood of Central\n\nMissouri v. Danforth, 428 U.S. 52, 96 S.Ct. 2831, 49 L.Ed.2d 788 (1976), the Court held that a\n\nparental or legal guardian veto of a minor's choice to have an abortion was unconstitutional. Id. at\n\n74-75, 96 S.Ct. at 2843-44. \"Constitutional rights,\" reasoned the Danforth Court, \"do not mature\n\nand come into being magically only when one attains the state-defined age of majority. Minors, as\n\nwell as adults, are protected by the Constitution and possess constitutional rights.\" Id. The Court\n\nalso noted, however, that \"the State has somewhat broader authority to regulate the activities of\n\nchildren than adults.\" Id. at 74, 96 S.Ct. at 2843.\n\n       Just how far a State can go in restricting a minor's access to abortion was sketched three years\n\nlater in the seminal decision of Bellotti v. Baird, 443 U.S. 622, 99 S.Ct. 3035, 61 L.Ed.2d 797 (1979)\n\n(Bellotti II ) (plurality opinion). There, the Court was faced with a challenge to a Massachusetts\n\nstatute which required a minor under the age of eighteen to obtain parental consent before an abortion\n\ncould be performed, but if such consent was not given, \" \"consent may be obtained by order of a\n\njudge of the superior court for good cause shown.' \" Id. at 625, 99 S.Ct. at 3039 (emphasis added).\n\nThe Massachusetts Supreme Court had interpreted this judicial bypass provision to mean that a minor\n\ncould not obtain a court order without any parental consent whatsoever. Id. at 646, 99 S.Ct. at 3049-\n\n50. Thus, in Bellotti II, the Court had to determine whether this bypass procedure satisfied the\n\nConstitution.\n\n       The Court held that it did not. The Court first recognized that parental consent statutes must\n\n\"provide an alternative procedure\" in the event the minor is unable to secure one or both parents'\n\nconsent. Id. at 643, 99 S.Ct. at 3048. Turning next to the Massachusetts bypass provision, the Court\n\nconcluded that Massachusetts's judicial bypass procedure \"would impose an undue burden upon the\n\nexercise by minors of the right to seek an abortion.\" Id. at 647, 99 S.Ct. at 3050. In reaching this\n\fconclusion, the Court presented the competing considerations underlying a minor's choice to\n\nterminate her pregnancy. The Court recognized that minors are vulnerable, less able than adults to\n\nmake informed and mature decisions, and that parents play a central role in childrearing. Id. at 634,\n\n99 S.Ct. at 3043. Balanced against these concerns, the Court noted, are the battle lines that often\n\ndevelop in families in which one or both parents have strong views about abortion—battle lines that\n\nprevent minors from obtaining abortions. Id. at 647, 99 S.Ct. at 3050. With these considerations in\n\nmind, the Court specified four constitutional requirements that must be built into parental consent\n\nstatutes. The Court wrote:\n\n       A pregnant minor is ent itled to such a proceeding to show either: (1) that she is mature\n       enough and well enough informed to make her abortion decision, in consultation with her\n       physician, independently of her parents' wishes; or (2) that even if she is not able to make this\n       decision independently, the desired abortion would be in her best interests. The proceeding\n       in which this showing is made must assure that a resolution of the issue, and any appeals that\n       may follow, will be completed with [3] anonymity and [4] sufficient expedition to provide an\n       effective opportunity for an abortion to be obtained.\n\nId. at 643-44, 99 S.Ct. at 3048 (footnote omitted); see also Ohio v. Akron Center for Reproductive\n\nHealth, 497 U.S. 502, 511-14, 110 S.Ct. 2972, 2979-81, 111 L.Ed.2d 405 (1990) (Akron II )\n\n(presenting the four Bellotti II requirements). If the minor demonstrates that she is mature,\n\nwell-informed, or that the abortion would be in her best interest, the Bellotti II Court held that the\n\nbypass decisionmaker \"must \" authorize the abortion. Bellotti II, 443 U.S. at 647, 648, 99 S.Ct. at\n\n3050, 3050-51 (emphasis added). Because Massachusetts's bypass procedure did not comport with\n\nthese requirements, the Court declared the statute unconstitutional. Id. at 647-48, 99 S.Ct. at 3050-\n\n51.\n\n       Since Bellotti II, lower federal courts have come to the unanimous conclusion that once a\n\nminor satisfies the maturity criteria or the best-interest test, bypass decisionmakers must order an\n\nabortion. We took the lead in Scheinberg v. Smith, 659 F.2d 476 (5th Cir. Unit B Oct.1981),\n\noverruled on other grounds in Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 112 S.Ct. 2791, 120 L.Ed.2d 674, where we\n\nheld that abstention was inappropriate because a Florida bypass procedure presented federal\n\nconstitutional issues. Id. at 481. The relevant statute provided that a court \"may\" order a minor to\n\nhave an abo rtion if she demonstrates that she is sufficiently mature. Id. at 478 (quoting Fla. Stat.\n\fAnn. § 390.001(4)(a) (West 1981)). In reaching the conclusion that we should not abstain, we\n\nreasoned:\n\n        The language of Bellotti II is not permissive: \"[i]f [the minor] satisfies the court that she is\n        mature and well enough informed to make intelligently the abortion decision on her own, the\n        court must authorize her to act ...\" [Citation.] Thus, whether permissive or mandatory,\n        subsection 4(a) vests Florida courts with constitutionally impermissible discretion to ignore\n        a minor's maturity in determining whether to authorize her abortion.\n\nId. at 481 (original emphasis). Other Circuits have read Bellotti II in the same way.7\n\n        Bellotti II, of course, did not answer all of the questions surrounding minors' access to\n\nabortion. In fact, the fate of Bellotti II was at first unclear because it was decided by a plurality of\n\nthe Court. Since then, however, the Court has held that Bellotti II is cont rolling precedent, see\n\nLambert v. Wicklund, No. 96-858, 1997 WL 141488, at 2, --- U.S. ----, ---- - ----, --- S.Ct. ----, ---- -\n\n----, --- L.Ed.2d ---- (U.S. Mar. 31, 1997); Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505\n\nU.S. 833, 898-900, 112 S.Ct. 2791, 2832, 120 L.Ed.2d 674 (1992); City of Akron v. Akron Ctr. for\n\nReproductive Health, 462 U.S. 416, 439-40, 103 S.Ct. 2481, 2497-98, 76 L.Ed.2d 687 (1983)\n\n(Akron I ), and we have not thought otherwise, Barnes v. Mississippi, 992 F.2d 1335, 1338-39 (5th\n\nCir.1993); Scheinberg v. Smith, 659 F.2d 476, 480-81 (5th Cir. Unit B Oct.1981).8 The Court has\n\nalso suggested that absolute anonymity is not required in bypass proceedings. See Akron II, 497 U.S.\n\nat 513, 110 S.Ct. at 2980.\n\n        With these background principles in mind, we turn next to the specific provisions of Act 1254\n\nto determine whether they comport with Bellotti II and its progeny.\n\nA. The Constitutionality of La. R.S. 40:1299.35.5(B)(4) & (6)\n\n   7\n     See Planned Parenthood, Sioux Falls Clinic v. Miller, 63 F.3d 1452, 1462 (8th Cir.1995) (\"If\na minor can demonstrate that she is mature, the State has no legitimate reason for imposing liberty\nrestrictions upon her that it may not impose on an adult.\"), cert. denied sub nom. Janklow v.\nPlanned Parenthood, Sioux Falls Clinic, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 1582, 134 L.Ed.2d 679 (1996);\nIndiana Planned Parenthood v. Pearson, 716 F.2d 1127, 1134 (7th Cir.1983) (\"The statute does\nnot—and constitutionally cannot—give the juvenile court the authority to refuse to waive\nnotification despite a finding that the minor is mature.\").\n   8\n    The State appears to suggest in their brief that Bellotti II has been modified by subsequent\ndecisions of the Supreme Court. However, as our discussion suggests, the Court has never\nquestioned the viability of the four Bellotti II requirements and we decline to do so in this case.\nMore importantly, the State backed off this claim at oral argument, where it conceded that Act\n1254 must be evaluated under Bellotti II.\n\f        Act 1254 changes Louisiana's judicial bypass procedure so that a minor who demonstrates\n\nthat she is mature, well-informed, or that an abortion would be in her best interest, \"may\" receive\n\njudicial authorization for the abortion. La. R.S. 40:1299.35.5(B)(4), (6). In addition, Act 1254 sets\n\nup a state-sponsored \"evaluation and counseling\" scheme to which a minor may be referred within\n\nforty-eight hours of a hearing before the juvenile court. La. R.S. 40:1299.35.5(B)(4). The plaintiffs\n\nchallenge (B)(4) and (6) on two grounds. First, the plaintiffs claim that (B)(4) and (6) violate the\n\nBellotti II principle that mature and well-informed minors and those for whom an abortion is in their\n\nbest interest must receive judicial authorization to have an abortion. Second, the plaintiffs claim that\n\n(B)(4)'s requirement that minors receive counseling from state health and social services agencies\n\nviolates the Bellotti II principle that bypass proceedings are to proceed expeditiously. The district\n\ncourt agreed with the plaintiffs on both issues. We discuss each of these holdings in turn.\n\n1. \"Shall\" versus \"May\" in § 1299.35.5(B)(4) and (6)\n\n        The 1981 version of § 1299.35.5(B) provided that if a minor demonstrates that she is either\n\nmature and well-informed or that the abortion would be in her best interest, the juvenile court \"shall\"\n\norder an abortion. La. R.S. 40:1299.35.5(B)(4), (5) (West 1992). As we noted above, this language\n\nappeared in Louisiana's judicial bypass statute because of the Supreme Court's decision in Bellotti II,\n\nwhich rendered the 1978 version of § 1299.35.5(B) unconstitutional. See Margaret S.(I), 488\n\nF.Supp. at 203. And with, among other things, the addition of the mandatory \"shall\" language, the\n\n1981 version of § 1299.35.5(B) survived a constitutional challenge. Margaret S.(II), 597 F.Supp.\n\nat 650-52.\n\n        Against this legislative backdrop, the district court declared § 1299.35.5(B)(4) and (6)\n\nunconstitutional. The court looked to the common meaning of the terms \"shall\" and \"may\" and\n\nconcluded that the Louisiana Legislature intended a change in the statutory framework governing the\n\njudicial bypass procedure. \"[T]he clear intent of the statutory amendment,\" reasoned the district\n\ncourt, \"was to grant the substantive power of discretion to the judges of this state that is directly\n\ncontrary to the rulings of the Supreme Court in Casey, Akron II and Bellotti II.\" 905 F.Supp. at 364.\n\n        The State in its briefs and at oral argument strenuously asserts that § 1299.35.5(B)(4) and (6)\n\fis constitutional because (1) the change from \"shall\" to \"may\" does not confer discretion on juvenile\n\ncourt judges to deny a minor an abortion if the minor is mature and well-informed or if the abortion\n\nis in the minor's best interest; and (2) subsections(B)(4) and (6) are procedural in nature and\n\ntherefore do not contradict the substantive federal law in this area. Neither of these arguments is\n\npersuasive.\n\n        We reject the State's co ntention that the change from \"shall\" to \"may\" does not confer\n\ndiscretion on juvenile court judges. We note by way of illustration that with one partial exception,9\n\nLouisiana stands alone on this front: As far as we are aware, every state with a parental consent or\n\nnotification statute has used the mandatory \"shall\" language in their judicial bypass schemes.10 The\n\nState's argument that subsections (4) and (6) pass constitutional muster takes one of two forms.\n\nFirst, the word change does not on its face give juvenile courts the discretion to deny a minor an\n\nabortion if the minor shows that she is mature, well-informed, or that the abortion would be in her\n\nbest interest; or, alternatively, even though the statute on its face states that a juvenile court judge\n\n\n   9\n    North Dakota appears to be the only other state in which a bypass decisionmaker \"may\" order\nan abortion if the Bellotti II requirements are met. N.D. CENT.CODE § 14-02.1-03.1(5)(a),\n(b)(1)-(3) (1995). To be sure, unlike Louisiana, part of North Dakota's statutory scheme tracks\nBellotti II. For example, if a minor in North Dakota demonstrates that she is mature and well\ninformed, § 14-02.1-03.1(5)(a) provides that \"the court shall issue an order authorizing a\ncompetent physician to perform the abortion procedure on the minor.\" (Emphasis added.)\nHowever, if the minor fails to demonstrate she is mature and well informed, § 14-02.1-\n03.1(5)(b)(1), (3) provides that the court \"may\" order an abortion if the court determines that the\nabortion is nevertheless in the minor's best interests. On this point, the North Dakota statute is\nsimilar to La. R.S. 40:1299.35.5(B)(6).\n   10\n     See ALA.CODE § 26-21-4(f)(1), (2) (1996); ARIZ.REV.STAT.

Jane, --- U.S. ----, ---- - ----, 116 S.Ct. 2068, 2069-72, 135 L.Ed.2d\n\n443 (1996) (per curiam); Barnes v. Mississippi, 992 F.2d at 1341-42, mindful of the principle that\n\nwe should avoid \"federal-court nullification of state law,\" Leavitt, --- U.S. at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 2072,\n\nand \"[w]here fairly possible, ... construe a statute to avoid a danger of unconstitutionality,\" Ashcroft,\n\n462 U.S. at 493, 103 S.Ct. at 2526; Akron II, 497 U.S. at 514, 110 S.Ct. at 2980-81.\n\n         Under Louisiana law, \"the paramount consideration for statutory interpretation is the\n\nascertainment of the legislative intent and the reason or reasons which prompted the legislature to\n\nenact the law.\" Fontenot v. Chevron, U.S.A., Inc., 676 So.2d 557, 562 (La.1996). In searching for\n\nthe legislative intent behind subsections (4) and (6), we begin with Article 9 of the Louisiana Civil\n\nCode, which provides:\n\n                When a law is clear and unambiguous and its application does not lead to absurd\n        consequences, the law shall be applied as written and no further interpretation may be made\n        in search of the intent of the legislature.\n\nLa. C.C. art. 9 (West 1996); Tucker v. Fowler, 668 So.2d 718, 719 (La.1996); Marine Marketing\n\nServs., Inc. v. Louisiana Dep't of Ins., 673 So.2d 335, 338 (La.Ct.App. 1st Cir.1996) (holding that\n\nit was reversible error for trial court to look to statutory intent when the language of the statute was\n\nneither ambiguous nor produced absurd consequences). \"When the wording of a Section is clear and\n\nfree of ambiguity, the letter of it shall not be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.\" La.\n\nR.S. 1:4 (West 1996); Sumrall v. Luhr Bros., 665 So.2d 796, 800 (La.Ct.App. 1st Cir.1995), writ\n\ndenied, 669 So.2d 425 (La.1996).\n\n        Thus, when determining the Louisiana Legislature's intent behind subsections (4) and (6), we\n\nmay only go beyond the plain terms of § 1299.35.5(B)(4) and (6) if the statute on its face is unclear\n\for ambiguous or if application of the terms of subsections (4) and (6) produces \"absurd\n\nconsequences.\" We have found no decisions from the Louisiana courts interpreting the meaning of\n\nsubsections (B)(4) and (6), no decisions interpreting the pertinent provisions of the 1981 version of\n\n§ 1299.35.5(B), and no legislative history explaining the 1995 change from \"shall\" to \"may.\" We\n\ntherefore apply Louisiana's principles of statutory construction to § 1299.35.5(B)(4) and (6).\n\n        We hold that § 1299.35.5(B)(4) and (6) plainly violates Bellotti II. As such, the statute is\n\nneither unclear nor ambiguous, nor does application of its plain terms produce absurd results. La.\n\nR.S. 1:3 (West 1996) provides:\n\n        § 3. Words and phrases; how construed\n\n                Words and phrases shall be read with their context and shall be construed according\n        to the common and approved usage of the language. Technical words and phrases, and such\n        others as may have acquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning in the law, shall be construed\n        and understood according to such peculiar and appropriate meaning.\n\n                The word \"shall\" is mandatory and the word \"may\" is permissive.\n\n(emphasis added); see also La. C.C. art. 11 (West 1996) (\"The words of a law must be given their\n\ngenerally prevailing meaning.\"); Backhus v. Transit Cas. Co., 549 So.2d 283, 289 (La.1989) (same).\n\nWe can imagine no more clear indication that § 1299.35.5(B)(4) and (6) on its face provides juvenile\n\ncourt judges discretion to deny an abortion to a minor who has met the Bellotti II requirements. The\n\nbasic guide for interpreting Louisiana statutes states in unmistakably clear terms that \"shall\" means\n\n\"mandatory\" and that \"may\" means \"permissive.\" Moreover, the common usage of the term\n\n\"permissive\" is \"[a]llowed; allowable; that which may be done[;][l]enient; tolerant.\" BLACK'S LAW\n\nDICTIONARY at 1140 (6th ed.1990); Sumrall, 665 So.2d at 800 (looking to Black's Law Dictionary\n\nfor common and approved usage). Thus, the plain language of § 1299.35.5(B)(4) and (6) states that\n\njuvenile court judges within Louisiana have the discretion to deny an abortion to a minor even though\n\nthe minor demonstrates that she is mature, well-informed, or that the abortion would be in her best\n\ninterest. This flies in the face of Bellotti II and its progeny.\n\n        Our reading of the statute does not produce absurd consequences. We have done nothing\n\nmore than apply the meaning of \"may\" and \"shall\" that exists in La. R.S. 1:3 to a statute that is neither\n\nunclear nor ambiguous on its face.          Louisiana courts have not declared that this sort of\n\fbread-and-butter interpretation of statutes produces \"absurd consequences.\" Compare Breaux v.\n\nHoffpauir, 674 So.2d 234, 236 (La.1996) (holding that interpretation of Louisiana statute would lead\n\nto absurd consequence because state definition of \"actual wages\" would be illegal under federal\n\nstatute); Washington-St. Tammany Electrical Coop., Inc. v. Louisiana Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 671\n\nSo.2d 908, 914 (La.1996) (absurd consequence results when interpretation contravenes the purposes\n\nof the statute).\n\n        The State would have us read § 1299.35.5(B) differently. They claim that § 1299.35.5(B)\n\n\"provides only the procedural means needed for Louisiana state judges to apply the federal\n\nsubstantive principles in this area of law to individual cases in order to issue judgments in accordance\n\nwith such substantive principles.\" Because, argues the State, § 1299.35.5(B) is a procedural statute,\n\nwe must liberally construe the statute to effectuate its overall purposes. Second, the State points to\n\nthe Louisiana Supreme Court's decision in Rathborne Lumber & Supply Co. v. Falgout, 218 La. 629,\n\n50 So.2d 295 (1950), in which the court stated in dictum: \"[A]lthough words of a statute are\n\npermissive, ... sometimes they may require an interpretation giving them mandatory effect ... where\n\nthe context or subject matter compels such construction or where it is necessary to carry out the clear\n\npolicy and intention of the Legislature.\" Id. at 635, 50 So.2d 295; accord Romero v. Stephens, 359\n\nSo.2d 1061, 1065 (La.Ct.App.3d Cir.1978); Gurtler, Hebert & Co. v. Marquette Casualty Co., 145\n\nSo.2d 145, 147-48 (La.Ct.App. 4th Cir.1962). But see Hornsby v. Fidelity Nat'l Bank of Baton\n\nRouge, 243 So.2d 96, 98 (La.Ct.App. 1st Cir.1971) (declining to follow Falgout, adhering to La.\n\nR.S. 1:3, and interpreting \"may\" and \"shall\" to mean \"permissive\" and \"mandatory,\" respectively).\n\nThus, concludes the State, we should follow Falgout in this case and effectuate the intent of the\n\nLouisiana Legislature as expressed in § 1299.35.0—\"It is the intention of the Legislature of the State\n\nof Louisiana to regulate abortion to the extent permitted by decisions of the United States Supreme\n\nCourt.\" We reject both arguments.\n\n        For us to accept the State's claim that Act 1254 is a procedural statute that merely effectuates\n\nthe substantive federal law in this area, we would have to conclude that the legislature did not in 1995\n\nintend to change § 1299.35.5(B). In other words, we would have to hold that the change from \"shall\"\n\fto \"may\" has no bearing on the constitutionality of Act 1254 because Act 1254 does not materially\n\nchange the 1981 version of § 1299.35.5(B). We cannot accept the State's proposition that Act 1254\n\ndoes not change the law. First, we would in effect be interpreting the statute so that \"may\" means\n\n\"shall,\" an interpretation that would be flatly inconsistent with the definition of those terms in La. R.S.\n\n1:3. Second, we would be ignoring the Louisiana Supreme Court's understanding of statutory\n\nchanges. The court has said: \"The legislature is presumed to have enacted a statute in light of the\n\npreceding statutes involving the same subject matter and court decisions construing those statutes,\n\nand where the new statute is worded differently from the preceding statute, the legislature is\n\npresumed to have intended to change the law.\" New Orleans Rosenbush Claims Serv., Inc. v. City\n\nof New Orleans, 653 So.2d 538, 544 (La.1995) (emphasis added). Nothing the State has said in their\n\nbriefs or at oral argument persuades us that Act 1254 does not materially change the judicial bypass\n\nprocedure in Louisiana.\n\n        Perhaps the most basic flaw in the State's arguments is the assumption that we must go\n\nbeyond the plain meaning of § 1299.35.5(B)(4) and (6). We decline to do so because, as we have\n\nsaid, the language of subsections (4) and (6) is clear, unambiguous, and does not produce absurd\n\nconsequences. The State points us to no authority, and we perceive none, suggesting that procedural\n\nstatutes are immune from Article 9's clear mandate. In addition, the State fails to provide any\n\nauthority, and again we perceive none, for the proposition that Falgout is an exception to Article 9's\n\nstatutory construction principle.\n\n        Finally, the State argues that if we interpret § 1299.5.5(B)(4) and (6) to mean that juvenile\n\ncourt judges have the discretion to deny an abortion to a minor that meets the Bellotti II\n\nrequirements, we would be indulging the inappropriate assumption that Louisiana judges will decline\n\nto follow the federal Constitution. We agree with the State that we should refrain from assuming that\n\nstate actors will violate the law. \"[T]he Fifth Circuit is not,\" as we have recognized, \"a \"roving\n\ncommission[ ] assigned to pass judgment on the validity of the Nation's laws.' \" Barnes v.\n\nMississippi, 992 F.2d at 1342 (quoting Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 610-11, 93 S.Ct.\n\n2908, 2915, 37 L.Ed.2d 830 (1973)).\n\f        However, we make no such assumption here. We have held that § 1299.35.5(B)(4) and (6)\n\non its face is inconsistent with Bellotti II and its progeny because it invests juvenile court judges with\n\nthe discretion to deny a minor an abortion even though she satisfies the Bellotti II requirements. As\n\nsuch, this case is plainly distinguishable from our decision in Barnes v. Mississippi, 992 F.2d 1335.\n\nThere, the plaintiffs brought a facial challenge against a rule promulgated by the Mississippi Supreme\n\nCourt pursuant to a bypass statute that did not on its face conflict with Bellotti II. Id. at 1337-41.\n\nThe Mississippi statute notably provided that if a minor demonstrates that she is mature and\n\nwell-informed or that the abortion would be in her best interest, the court must order the abortion.\n\nId. at 1342 n. 4. The procedural rule challenged by the plaintiffs, although it was worded differently\n\nthan the language in Bellotti II, did not on its face conflict with the statute. Id. at 1341 (\"[T]he rule\n\nrequires a minor to plead that notifying her parents of the abortion is not in her best interest.\").\n\nAccordingly, we rejected the challenge to the Mississippi Supreme Court's procedural rule on the\n\nground that \"[i]f a Mississippi court does follow [the procedural rule] so as to conflict with Bellotti,\n\na plaintiff will be free to launch an as-applied challenge to the bypass procedure.\" Id. at 1342.\n\n        Here, we face an entirely different situation. Juvenile court judges within Louisiana have a\n\nlegislatively prescribed choice whether to order an abortion for a minor who is mature, well-informed,\n\nor for whom an abortion would be in her best interest. It is this discretion itself, and not the exercise\n\nof it, that we find inconsistent with Bellotti II.\n\n        In short, § 1299.35.5(B)(4) and (6) is unconstitutional. We affirm the district court's decision\n\nto permanently enjoin these provisions of Act 1254.\n\n2. Expeditiousness in § 1299.35.5(B)(3) and (4)\n\n         Section 1299.35.5(B)(3) provides that \"[e]ach application shall be heard in chambers,\n\nanonymously, in a summary manner, and within forty-eight hours of the filing thereof.\" Except for\n\nthe admonition that the hearing proceed in a \"summary manner,\" subsection (B)(3) on its face does\n\nnot pro vide a specific time frame for deciding the merits of a minor's application. Section\n\n1299.35.5(B)(4) provides that a juvenile court may require a minor to attend various state-sponsored\n\nevaluation and counseling sessions within forty-eight hours of the ex parte hearing with the juvenile\n\fcourt judge. Subsection (B)(4), like subsection (3), does not on its face provide a time frame within\n\nwhich that evaluation is to be completed and the results forwarded to the court. Nor does subsection\n\n(4) contain the \"summary manner\" language found in subsection (3).\n\n        The plaintiffs claim that § 1299.35.5(B)(3) and (4) violates the Bellotti II requirement that\n\nbypass procedures proceed expeditiously because both subsections provide an indefinite time period\n\nfor the juvenile court judge to decide the merits of the minor's application. The district court agreed\n\nwith the plaintiffs that subsections (B)(3) and (4) did not meet the Bellotti II requirement for\n\nexpeditious resolution of bypass applications. 905 F.Supp. at 365.11 On appeal, the State argues that\n\nthe district court erred in reaching this conclusion because the statute requires juvenile court judges\n\nto conduct the proceedings in a \"summary manner,\" and to hold that this provision violates Bellotti\n\nII, we \"would have to assume that a state district judge would intentionally ignore the requirements\n\nof state law and the dictates of the United States Supreme Court.\"\n\n        We agree with the district court that subsections (B)(3) and (4) are inconsistent with Bellotti\n\nII because they do not provide for an expeditious resolution of the minor's bypass application. We\n\nagain frame our analysis in accord with Louisiana's rules of statutory construction and determine\n\nwhether proceeding in a \"summary manner\" satisfies Bellotti II 's expedition requirement. Louisiana\n\nCivil Code article 2595 (West 1996) provides that in a summary proceeding, \"[t]he court shall render\n\nits decision as soon as practicable after the conclusion of the trial of a summary proceeding and,\n\nwhenever practicable, without taking the matter under advisement.\" (Emphasis added).\n\n        Such an open-ended bypass procedure has never been approved. We should not, as the\n\nSupreme Court has suggest ed, \"invalidate[ ] [a bypass] statute on a facial challenge based upon a\n\nworst-case analysis that may never occur.\" Akron II, 497 U.S. at 514, 110 S.Ct. at 2981. The\n\n\n   11\n     The district court stated that \"the provisions of Act 1254 amend Section B(4) of the Act to\nrequire that the juvenile court hear the bypass application within 48 hours, without any\nrequirement as to when the application must be ruled upon.\" 905 F.Supp. at 365 (emphasis\nadded). Our reading of the statute, however, reveals that subsection B(3) provides the forty-eight\nhour time frame and that the only change made by Act 1254 was to substitute the word\n\"confidentially\" with \"anonymously.\" Act 1254 did not for the first time introduce the forty-eight\nhour and \"summary manner\" requirements; both appeared in the 1981 version of § 1299.35.5(B).\n\fSupreme Court has held that a seventeen- and twenty-two-day delay satisfies Bellotti II. Akron II,\n\n497 U.S. at 514, 110 S.Ct. at 2980-81 (22 days); Ashcroft, 462 U.S. at 479 n. 4, 491 n. 16, 103\n\nS.Ct. at 2519 n. 4, 2525 n. 16 (17 days). An indefinite period, however, has been rejected. In Glick\n\nv. McKay, 937 F.2d 434 (9th Cir.1991),12 the Ninth Circuit determined the constitutionality of the\n\nbypass procedure in Nevada's parental notification statute. Like Louisiana's bypass procedure,\n\nNevada's statute did not on its face provide a time frame within which a minor's bypass application\n\nwas to be decided. Id. at 438. The Ninth Circuit struck down the statute as inconsistent with Bellotti\n\nII. \"Under the statute,\" reasoned the court, \"the district court could ... delay the bypass procedure\n\nindefinitely. The district court review procedure does not meet the Bellotti expediency criterion.\"\n\nId. at 440-41; see also id. at 441 n. 4 (stating that \"an indefinite period does not\" satisfy Bellotti II\n\n).\n\n          Subsections (B)(3) and (4) plainly conflict with Bellotti II because the juvenile court is not\n\nrequired to rule on the minor's application within any specified time nor are state counselors required\n\nto report back to the juvenile court within any specified time. We hold that \"whenever practicable\"\n\ndoes not satisfy constitutional standards of expediency. There is no fall-back (or constructive\n\nauthorization) provision within subsection (3) that deems a minor's application granted in the event\n\nthe juvenile court does not act within a particular time frame. Thus, not only do subsections (3) and\n\n(4) fail to provide any specific time within which a minor's application will be decided, but they give\n\nno assurances (assurances required by Bellotti II ) that the proceedings will conclude expeditiously.\n\n          The State attempts to rescue subsection (3) by pointing to Article 2591 (West 1961) of the\n\nLouisiana Civil Code, which provides: \"Summary proceedings are those which are conducted with\n\nrapidity, within the delays allowed by the court, and without citation and the observance of all the\n\nformalities required in ordinary proceedings.\" (Emphasis added). Plainly, the \"rapidity\" language\n\nrefers to the expeditiousness of the summary proceeding itself, not to the time a judge has to decide\n\n     12\n     The Supreme Court has disapproved the analysis in Glick, in which the Ninth Circuit held\nunconstitutional a bypass procedure which allowed a minor to have an abortion if parental\nnotification, and not the abortion itself, was not in the minor's best interest. Lambert v. Wicklund,\n1997 WL 141488, at *2-*4, --- U.S. at ---- - ----, --- S.Ct. at ---- - ----. Nothing in Lambert\naffects Glick's holding regarding Bellotti II's expediency requirement.\n\fthe merits of a case. We inevitably return to article 2595 which does, as we have said, prescribe the\n\ntime frame within which a decision in a summary proceeding is to be rendered—\"as soon as\n\npracticable.\" This is insufficient under Bellotti II.\n\n        Finally, contrary to the State's contention, we do not portray Louisiana juvenile court judges\n\nor state-employed counselors as individuals who would intentionally violate Bellotti II, nor are we\n\nanalyzing the constitutionality of subsections (B)(3) and (4) under a worst-case scenario. We have\n\nsimply looked to the plain terms of § 1299.35.5(B)(3) and (4) to determine the rules juvenile court\n\njudges are required to follow when presented with a bypass application from a minor. The Louisiana\n\nLegislature has told them that they must rule on the application \"as soon as\" or \"whenever\n\npracticable.\" This violates Bellotti II 's expedition requirement on its face. We therefore affirm the\n\ndistrict court's decision to permanently enjoin subsections (3) and (4).\n\nB. The Constitutionality of La. R.S. 40:1299.35.5(B)(5)\n\n        Section 1299.35.5(B)(5) provides, among other things, that the juvenile court \"shall\" notify\n\nthe parent(s) or legal guardian if the court determines that such notification is in the minor's best\n\ninterest. The plaintiffs contend, and the district court agreed, that § 1299.35.5(B)(5) does not satisfy\n\nBellotti II 's anonymity requirement. The State, on the other hand, contends that § 1299.35.5(B)(5)\n\ncomports with Bellotti II. The State relies on the following language in Bellotti II for this conclusion:\n\n        [T]he court may deny the abortion request of an immature minor in the absence of parental\n        consultation if it concludes that her best interests would be served thereby, or the court may\n        in such a case defer decision until there is parental consultation in which the court may\n        participate.\n\nBellotti II, 443 U.S. at 648, 99 S.Ct. at 3050-51 (emphasis added). From this statement, the State\n\nargues that the Bellotti II Court \"seem[ed] to encourage [parental notification], if the courts believe\n\nto do so is in the minors [sic ] best interest.\" We agree with the district court and conclude that the\n\nState is mistaken.\n\n        As the plaintiffs and the district court correctly note, this language from Bellotti II in no way\n\npermits the independent bypass decisionmaker to contact a minor's parents, inform them that their\n\nminor daughter is seeking an abortion without their consent, and then ask the parents to participate\n\nin the process of deciding whether the abortion would be in the minor's best interest. We read the\n\fstatement from Bellotti II to mean that a Louisiana juvenile court can refuse to authorize a minor's\n\nabortion if parental notification is in the minor's best interest, or the court may wait until the minor\n\nherself seeks parental consultation, and then, with both the parents' and minor's input, determine\n\nwhether an abortion is in the minor's best interest.\n\n        Any other interpretation of this language—or shall we say, the State's interpretation—would\n\ncut the core out of Bellotti II. If Bellotti II means anything, it surely means that States seeking to\n\nregulate minors' access to abortion must offer a credible bypass procedure, independent of parents\n\nor legal guardians, in a parental consent statute like the one in Louisiana. Plainly, the State has\n\nattempted    to   enter   through    the   proverbial     back    door    by   suggesting     that   the\n\n\"best-interest-of-the-minor\" inquiry cannot arbitrarily exclude the input of parents or a legal guardian.\n\nAlthough the Supreme Court has recognized that bypass decisionmakers can consider whether\n\nparental notification would be in the best interest of the minor, Bellotti II, 443 U.S. at 640, 99 S.Ct.\n\nat 3046-47, and that complete anonymity is not required, Akron II, 497 U.S. at 513, 110 S.Ct. at\n\n2980, the Court has not held that anonymity may give way to parental notification in bypass statutes.\n\n        The Supreme Court's decision in H.L. v. Matheson, 450 U.S. 398, 101 S.Ct. 1164, 67\n\nL.Ed.2d 388 (1981) is not to the contrary. There, the Court upheld a parental notification provision,\n\nreasoning that \"a statute setting out a \"mere requirement of parental notice' does not violate the\n\nconstitutional rights of an immature, dependent minor.\" Id. at 409, 101 S.Ct. at 1171. Because the\n\nCourt has yet to address the question of whether a bypass procedure is required for parental\n\nnotification statutes, we do not read Matheson to hold that parental notification is an exception to\n\nthe Bellotti II anonymity requirement. Indeed, if we were to agree with the State that Matheson\n\nmodified the anonymity requirement in Bellotti II, we would create an exception that swallows the\n\nrule. The central thrust of Bellotti II was to ensure that minors who could not or would not seek the\n\nconsent of a parent or legal guardian have access to a bypass procedure that would ensure anonymity\n\nfrom parents who may \"obstruct both an abortion and their access to court.\" Bellotti II, 443 U.S.\n\nat 647, 99 S.Ct. at 3050. By requiring a juvenile court judge to notify a minor's parents if the judge\n\nfinds that doing so would be in the minor's best interest, Louisiana has undermined the independent\n\fbypass procedure prescribed in Bellotti II.\n\n        We affirm the district court's conclusion that subsection (5) of § 1299.35.5(B) is inconsistent\n\nwith Bellotti II 's anonymity requirement.\n\n                                           CONCLUSION\n\n        We do not question Louisiana's interest in regulating the circumstances under which minors\n\nmay obtain abortions or its interest in ensuring that minors make an informed choice to have an\n\nabortion. The Supreme Court has stressed, as have we, the need to balance parents' strong interest\n\nin participating in a minor's upbringing against a minor's constitutional right to an abortion. Beginning\n\nwith Bellotti II, the Supreme Court has balanced these competing interests in a manner which\n\nmandates our decision today. Accordingly, if the Louisiana Legislature chooses to modify its judicial\n\nbypass procedure, it must do so consistent with the teachings of the Supreme Court and our\n\nConstitution. We hold that Act 1254 is facially unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause of the\n\nFourteenth Amendment of the Constitution.\n\n        The summary judgment of the district court permanently enjoining Act 1254 is AFFIRMED.\n\n        AFFIRMED.\n\n        EMILIO M. GARZA, Circuit Judge, concurring specially:\n\n        For the second time in my judicial career, I am forced to follow a Supreme Court opinion I\n\nbelieve to be inimical to the Constitution. See Sojourner T. v. Edwards, 974 F.2d 27, 31 (5th\n\nCir.1992) (Garza, J., concurring specially). Although I have misgivings about whether the Act's\n\nfailure to require expedient decision can support a facial challenge under United States v. Salerno,\n\n481 U.S. 739, 745, 107 S.Ct. 2095, 2100, 95 L.Ed.2d 697 (1987), I generally agree with the\n\nmajority's opinion that certain provisions of Act 1254 are unconstitutional according to the Supreme\n\nCourt's opinion in Bellotti v. Baird, 443 U.S. 622, 99 S.Ct. 3035, 61 L.Ed.2d 797 (1979) (Bellotti\n\nII ). I respectfully disagree with the Bellotti II Court that the Constitution requires the result we\n\nreach today. I do not believe that the language of the Fourteenth Amendment speaks to the discretion\n\njudges may exercise in permitting minors to have an abortion. I think that the Bellotti II opinion\n\ncrossed the line from judicial review to judicial legislation. Furthermore, in the absence of governing\n\fconstitutional text, I believe that ontological issues such as abortion are more properly decided in the\n\npolitical and legislative arenas. Mindful, however, that the Constitution invests the Supreme Court\n\nwith the final say, I defer to the Court's authority and concur in the majority opinion.\n\n                                                   I\n\n        My disagreement with the holding of Bellotti II begins generally with substantive due process.\n\nAlthough the Supreme Court has assumed that the Fourteenth Amendment has a substantive\n\ncomponent, see Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 846, 112 S.Ct. 2791, 2804, 120\n\nL.Ed.2d 674 (1992) (Due Process Clause \"has been understood to contain a substantive\n\ncomponent\"), it has found the boundaries of such substantive rights to be elusive. Nonetheless,\n\ncourts have extended such protections quite far, as evidenced by the Bellotti II opinion, which\n\nestablishes ambitious and very specific minimum requirements for parental consent statutes in the\n\nabortion context.\n\n                                                   A\n\n        The constitutional mandate of Bellotti II springs from a single word used by the drafters of\n\nthe Civil War amendments: liberty. Casey, 505 U.S. at 846, 112 S.Ct. at 2804. The relevant portion\n\nof the Fourteenth Amendment provides that \"[n]o state shall ... deprive any person of life, liberty, or\n\nproperty, without due process of law....\" U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Drafted in the wake of the Civil\n\nWar, this clause stands as a guarantee against arbitrary action against people by state governments.\n\nDaniels v. Williams, 474 U.S. 327, 331, 106 S.Ct. 662, 665, 88 L.Ed.2d 662 (1986).\n\n        \"Substantive\" due process, as the argument goes, is implicit in this notion. Proponents\n\nsuggest (or assume) that some government action departs so far from the constitutional scheme that\n\nno amount of process will be sufficient to ratify its legitimacy. See, e.g., Casey, 505 U.S. at 846, 112\n\nS.Ct. at 2804; Daniels, 474 U.S. at 331, 106 S.Ct. at 665. The Court has \"understood\" the\n\nFourteenth Amendment to include such guarantees at least as far back as 1887, see Casey, 505 U.S.\n\nat 846, 112 S.Ct. at 2804 (citing Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U.S. 623, 660-61, 8 S.Ct. 273, 291, 31\n\nL.Ed. 205 (1887)) (holding that the Fourteenth Amendment protected brewer from arbitrary\n\ndeprivation of property), although the Court has probably understood the notion of due process to\n\finclude a substantive component at least as early as Dred Scott v. Sanford, 60 U.S. (How.) 393, 450,\n\n15 L.Ed. 691 (1856) (interpreting the Fifth Amendment to say that \"an act of Congress which\n\ndeprives a citizen of the United States of his liberty or property, merely because he came himself or\n\nbrought his property into a particular Territory of the United States, and who had committed no\n\noffence against the laws, could hardly be dignified with the name of due process of law.\").\n\n        Employing this theory of substantive guarantees, the Supreme Court has read the word\n\n\"liberty\" to create extensive, \"fundamental\" rights that the state may burden only under the most\n\ncompelling of circumstances and only in the narrowest of ways. The Court has used the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment to constitutionalize such issues as contraception, Carey v. Population Services Int'l 431\n\nU.S. 678, 684-85, 97 S.Ct. 2010, 2015-16, 52 L.Ed.2d 675 (1977); Griswold v. Connecticut, 381\n\nU.S. 479, 483-86, 85 S.Ct. 1678, 1681-82, 14 L.Ed.2d 510 (1965); municipal housing regulations,\n\nMoore v. East Cleveland, 431 U.S. 494, 499, 97 S.Ct. 1932, 1935, 52 L.Ed.2d 531 (1977) (plurality\n\nopinion); child rearing, Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745, 753, 102 S.Ct. 1388, 1394, 71 L.Ed.2d\n\n599 (1982); marriage, Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 12, 87 S.Ct. 1817, 1823, 18 L.Ed.2d 1010\n\n(1967); school curricula, Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, 535, 45 S.Ct. 571, 573, 69 L.Ed.\n\n1070 (1925); and, of course, abortion, Roe v. Wade 410 U.S. 113, 152-53, 93 S.Ct. 705, 726-27,\n\n35 L.Ed.2d 147 (1973). This list is only a partial catalogue of issues, not mentioned anywhere in the\n\nConstitution generally or the Fourteenth Amendment specifically, that the Supreme Court has\n\nremoved from the political arena. The Court's good intentions, expressed in these cases, have slowly\n\neroded the scope of public debate.\n\n        I do not believe that we should narrow the scope of procedural protection afforded by the\n\nFifth or Fourteenth Amendments. Nor do I dispute that the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates\n\nmost of the Bill of Rights. See, e.g., Casey, 505 U.S. at 847, 112 S.Ct. at 2804; Duncan v.\n\nLouisiana, 391 U.S. 145, 147-148, 88 S.Ct. 1444, 1446, 20 L.Ed.2d 491 (1968). However, I think\n\nit is a mistake to create new substantive rights, of whole cloth, for every state and for all time, under\n\nimplicit \"penumbras\" of a written Constitution; see, e.g., Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479,\n\n484, 85 S.Ct. 1678, 1681, 14 L.Ed.2d 510 (1965) (\"[S]pecific guarantees in the Bill of Rights have\n\fpenumbras, formed by emanations from those guarantees that help give them life and substance.\");\n\nthrough constitutional extrapolation, see id. at 484, 85 S.Ct. at 1682 (holding that contraception,\n\nalthough not mentioned in the Bill of Rights, \"concerns a relationship lying within the zone of privacy\n\ncreated by several fundamental constitutional guarantees\"); or by mere assumptions, see Casey, 505\n\nU.S. at 982, 112 S.Ct. at 2875 (Scalia, J., dissenting in part) (\" \"[R]easoned judgment' does not begin\n\nby begging the question, as Roe and subsequent cases unquestionably did by assuming that what the\n\nState is protecting is the mere \"potentiality of human life.' \").\n\n        Perhaps many of the most important substantive due process cases could have been decided\n\nunder other constitutional provisions, such as the First Amendment. See, e.g., Meyer v. Nebraska,\n\n262 U.S. 390, 399-403, 43 S.Ct. 625, 627, 67 L.Ed. 1042 (1923) (striking down statute that forbade\n\nteaching of German in grammar school). Alternatively, some of these issues could have been dealt\n\nwith by the states—if no extant constitutional provision stood in conflict with these laws, the Court\n\nneed not have stretched the Fourteenth Amendment to create conflict. State legislatures could have\n\nchanged laws as public attitudes changed. See, e.g., Conn. Gen.Stat. § 53-32 (1969) (repealing\n\nConnecticut laws at issue in Griswold prohibiting use of contraceptives). It is a feature of a healthy\n\ndemocracy that evolving public norms find voice in new laws supported by the people.\n\n        Some of these judicial decisions, such as invalidating statutes that discriminate based on race,\n\nreflect our nation's highest aspirations as an individualist, pluralist society. Nonetheless, judicial\n\nofficers should not force the pace of change nor bind the nation to wise po licy using loose\n\ninterpretations of our written Constitution. Neither our aspirations about privacy, nor our concerns\n\nabout the consequences of leaving certain matters for states to decide, invests us with the authority\n\nto nullify state law. Article III courts should not cloak political choices with claims that those choices\n\nare required by the Due Process Clause. See Casey, 505 U.S. at 983, 112 S.Ct. at 2875 (Scalia, J.,\n\ndissenting in part).\n\n        Currently, the boundaries of subst antive due process are less than pellucid. As these\n\nunenumerated substantive rights are by their natures not explicit, the Court has understandably had\n\ndifficulty in fixing their outer perimeter. We have been told by the Court that the limits of due\n\fprocess cannot be reduced to a formula, Poe v. Ullman, 367 U.S. 497, 542, 81 S.Ct. 1752, 1776, 6\n\nL.Ed.2d 989 (1961) (Harlan, J., dissenting), and that the doctrine's \"boundaries are not susceptible\n\nof expression as a simple rule.\" Casey, 505 U.S. at 849, 112 S.Ct. at 2806. The Court has suggested\n\nthat substantive rights must be so \"implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,\" that \"neither liberty nor\n\njustice would exist if [they were] sacrificed,\" Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U.S. 319, 325, 326, 58 S.Ct.\n\n149, 151, 152, 82 L.Ed. 288 (1937). It has also said that \"at the heart of liberty is the right to define\n\none's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.\"\n\nCasey, 505 U.S. at 851, 112 S.Ct. at 2807. As illustrated by the catalogue of substantive due process\n\nrights discussed earlier, the Fourteenth Amendment (thus interpreted) puts quite a bit of public policy\n\nwithin the \"heart\" of liberty. This is how the Supreme Court has dealt with the admittedly difficult\n\nissue of circumscribing which rights and liberties the Fourteenth Amendment comprises.\n\n        I do not believe that such open-ended inquiry can be helpful to judges interpreting the\n\nFourteenth Amendment. We must return to those principles embedded in the Constitution. First, as\n\nChief Justice Marshall said in Marbury v. Madison, \"it is emphatically the province and duty of the\n\njudicial department to say what the law is.\" 5 U.S. (Cranch) 137, 177, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803).\n\nImportantly, \"to say what the law is\" presupposes that there is law to interpret. The Constitution\n\ndoes not charge courts with legislation, merely interpretation.\n\n        Second, the powers of legislatures are limited, but not by the inherent power of the courts.\n\nThey are circumscribed by a written constitution: \"The powers of the legislature are defined and\n\nlimited; and that those limits may not be mistaken and forgotten, the constitution is written.\" Id. 5\n\nU.S. at 176 (emphasis added). Indeed, the Framers specifically protected against the combination\n\nof legislative and judicial powers in one branch. \"The judges can exercise no executive prerogative,\n\nthough they are shoots from the executive stock; nor any legislative function, though they may be\n\nadvised by legislative councils.... \"Were the power of judging joined with the legislative, the life and\n\nliberty of the subject would be exposed to arbitrary control, for the judge would then be the\n\nlegislator.' \" The Federalist No. 47, at 303 (James Madison) (Clinton Rossiter ed., 1961) (quoting\n\nCharles Montesquieu, The Spirit of Laws, Vol. I, Book IX (1748)).\n\f        Third, the people, not the courts, established the Constitution;          it is a document of\n\nself-determination, not judicial determination. \"That the people have an original right to establish,\n\nfor their future government, such principles as, in their opinion, shall most conduce to their own\n\nhappiness, is the basis on which the whole American fabric has been erected.\" Marbury, 5 U.S. at\n\n176 (emphasis added). In the context of unenumerated constitutional rights, the Supreme Court has\n\nconstructed a new constitutional amendment out of the single word \"liberty.\" Instead of interpreting\n\nliberty in the context of the Constitution, the Court would have us interpret the Constitution in the\n\ncontext of its broad interpretation of liberty. Viewed expansively, this word can turn the entire\n\nConstitution on its head and nullify any restraints on the Court's authority, judicial self-restraint\n\nnotwithstanding, which the Constitution itself rejects.\n\n        Fourth and finally, the Constitution is a flexible and dynamic document, designed to have as\n\nmuch vitality today as it did the day it was written. \"This provision is made in a constitution, intended\n\nto endure for ages to come, and consequently, to be adapted to the various crises of human affairs.\"\n\nM'Culloch v. Maryland, 17 U.S. (Wheat.) 316, 415, 4 L.Ed. 579 (1819). Al though historical\n\ncircumstances change, the principles that undergird the Constitution do not.\n\n        With these principles in mind, we should consider the proper way to interpret the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment, and accordingly, the proper scope of substantive due process. As a starting point, an\n\nunderstanding of what constitutional amendments were supposed to mean should guide any attempt\n\nto interpret them. The power to amend the Constitution is one of the greatest powers bestowed by\n\nthe Framers. The power to amend the Constitution gives the people the authority to constrain\n\nmajorities present and future. Because amendments are so powerful, the Constitution provides a\n\nrigorous proposal and ratification procedure for constitutional amendments in Article V, giving\n\nspecial constitutional ratifying authority to the pronouncements of three-fourths of the states. This\n\ngreat authority to bind future generations is seated in the American people. Because only the drafters\n\nand the states have the power to amend, their understanding of the words they choose should govern\n\nthe courts' interpretations where those words are ambiguous. Courts that stray beyond that meaning\n\nare acting beyond their authority. In Casey, however, the courts employed no textual analysis or\n\flegislative history, only judicial \"understandings.\" Casey, 505 U.S. at 846, 112 S.Ct. at 2804.\n\n       That is not to say that the Constitution or the Bill of Rights must be frozen in time. As\n\nMarshall said in M'Culloch, the Constitution is meant to endure, and its application must be flexible.\n\nNo one would dispute that the First Amendment protects television or the internet, or that the Fourth\n\nAmendment protects cellular phones, even though none of these technologies existed in the late\n\neighteenth century. The understanding of the drafters and ratifiers that Congress should not abridge\n\nthe freedom of the media must guide the courts' application of timeless principles to changed\n\ncircumstances. In this way, the understandings that undergird the Constitution and its amendments\n\ncontinue to have vitality in areas unforeseen at the drafting.\n\n       To say that these understandings are flexible, however, is emphatically not to say that changed\n\nvalues gain constitutional precedence to govern changed circumstances. That is a different\n\nproposition altogether. It is unwise to read t he Constitution by reference to a telephone poll, see\n\nCasey, 505 U.S. at 962, 112 S.Ct. at 2865 (Rehnquist, C.J., dissenting in part); even if it were\n\npossible, we have no authority to do so. Article V does not give amendment power to contemporary,\n\nmajority viewpoints. It explicitly sets forth a procedure to be followed for amendment.\n\n       To date, judicial attempts at understanding the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment have\n\nproven unsatisfactory. Although the Court has held that the Due Process Clause incorporates most\n\nof the Bill of Rights against the states, Duncan v. Louisiana, 391, U.S. 145, 147-48, 88 S.Ct. 1444,\n\n1446, 20 L.Ed.2d 491 (1968), it has repudiated the notion that the Bill of Rights limits the\n\ninterpretation of that clause. See Casey, 505 U.S. at 847, 112 S.Ct. at 2804-05 (citing disagreement\n\nwith Adamson v. California, 332 U.S. 46, 68-92, 67 S.Ct. 1672, 1683-97, 91 L.Ed. 1903 (1947)\n\n(Black, J., dissenting)). The Court has also rejected the i dea that the drafters of the Due Process\n\nClause only meant to protect citizens from state actions that were unconstitutional under the Due\n\nProcess Clause of the Fifth Amendment or proscribed by other law when the Fourteenth Amendment\n\nwas ratified. Id. (citing disagreement with Michael H. v. Gerald D., 491 U.S. 110, 127-28 n. 6, 109\n\nS.Ct. 2333, 2344-45 n. 6, 105 L.Ed.2d 91 (1989)).\n\n       In his seminal dissent in Poe v. Ullman (later adopted by the plurality in Casey), Justice Harlan\n\fprovided a different view of how to interpret the Fourteenth Amendment. Justice Harlan suggested\n\nthat we consult what \"history teaches are the traditions from which [liberty] developed as well as the\n\ntraditions from which it broke.\" Justice Harlan does not suggest that we look at the history of the\n\nFourteenth Amendment, but rather to American history and traditions generally to determine what\n\nliberties have been protected. At first blush, American history might seem t o be a good point of\n\nreference—a fixed, knowable tradition from which we might draw understanding. There are two\n\nmajor problems with this approach. First, the traditions from which liberty developed may suggest\n\na different role for government than was actually inscribed into the Fourteenth Amendment. Should\n\nthe liberty of freed slaves under the Fourteenth Amendment truly be defined by reference to American\n\nhistory leading up to the Civil War?\n\n       The second major difficulty of Justice Harlan's approach is that one can find whatever one\n\nseeks in history, if one is so determined. It is certainly true that Justice Harlan's look into the\n\nAmerican history will produce a richer record from which to draw conclusions. However, to canvas\n\nall of American history will likely produce conflicting traditions, allowing those who look to find\n\nwhatever answers they prefer. See Michael D., 491 U.S. at 137, 109 S.Ct. at 2349 (Brennan, J.,\n\ndissenting) (Tradition \"can be as malleable and as elusive as \"liberty' itself....\"); Moore v. East\n\nCleveland, 431 U.S. 494, 549, 97 S.Ct. 1932, 1961, 52 L.Ed.2d 531 (1977) (White, J., dissenting)\n\n(\"What the deeply rooted traditions of the country are is arguable; which of them deserve the\n\nprotection of the Due Process Clause is even more debatable.\").\n\n       The historical approach thus breaks down into the following conundrum: who decides which\n\nliberties were recognized in our history? How do we decide which history or tradition is relevant?\n\nThe task, however, is not to interpret American history, but to interpret the words of the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment. The federal judiciary is not composed of historians, merely lawyers whose expertise is\n\nneither \"history\" nor \"tradition.\" As used in Casey, concepts such as history and tradition have\n\nbecome ersatz constitutional provisions that courts substitute for the actual words.\n\n       Understanding the meaning of the word \"liberty\" in the context of the legislative history of\n\nthe Fourteenth Amendment avoids many of these judicial struggles to determine who gets to define\n\fhistory. Interpreting the Fourteenth Amendment by reference to the understanding of the drafters and\n\nratifiers is an approach more closely targeted to the task of interpreting a written constitution. In fact,\n\nthat is what the Supreme Court does in almost all other provisions of the Constitution.\n\n        I realize that sometimes legislative history is less clear than the Amendment or statute it is\n\nsupposed to illuminate, see, e.g., United States v. Public Utilities Commission, 345 U.S. 295, 320,\n\n73 S.Ct. 706, 720, 97 L.Ed. 1020 (1953) (Jackson, J., concurring), and Congress often speaks with\n\nmore than one voice as to why it chose particular language in a statute. Compare, e.g., TVA v. Hill,\n\n437 U.S. 153, 173-93, 98 S.Ct. 2279, 2291-2301, 57 L.Ed.2d 117 (1978) (legislative history of\n\nEndangered Species Act expresses Congressional intent that Court should enjoin completion of\n\nfederal dam that would threaten endangered species) with id. at 207-10, 98 S.Ct. at 2308-09 (Powell,\n\nJ., dissenting) (legislative history of statute supports opposite view) (cited in Stephen Breyer, On the\n\nUses of Legislative History in Interpreting Statutes, 65 S. Cal. L.Rev. 845, 862 n. 39 (1991)).\n\nIndeed, some Amendments and statutes have scarce history to consider. Such difficulties, however,\n\nare confronted by courts every day. Perfection in legislative history is not to be expected: I do not\n\npretend that this judicial task will be easy, only necessary. Fortunately the drafters of the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment explained in some det ail what they meant to accomplish, the legislative history is\n\nparticularly useful in interpreting the words of the Amendment. See, e.g., Adamson v. California,\n\n332 U.S. 46, 92-123, 67 S.Ct. 1672, 1696-1711, 91 L.Ed. 1903 (1947) (appendix to dissent of Black,\n\nJ., citing extensive legislative history of Fourteenth Amendment in Congress).\n\n        The drafters of the Fourteenth Amendment certainly had more modest goals in mind by using\n\nthe term \"liberty\" than the modern Supreme Court has. Liberty for the drafters came in the context\n\nof dealing with restrictive racial laws in the South. In the floor debates surrounding the drafting of\n\nthe Fourteenth Amendment, the bill sponsor in the Senate, Senator Trumbull, suggested that the\n\nliberty interests involved were intended to deal with these statutes:\n\n        \"[S]tatutes of Mississippi ... provide that if any person of African descent residing in that\n        State travels from one county to the another without having a pass or a certificate of his\n        freedom, he is liable to be committed to jail and to be dealt with as a person who i s in the\n        State without authority. Other provisions of the statute prohibit any negro or mulatto from\n        having fire-arms; and one provision of the statute declares that for \"exercising the functions\n        of a minister of the Gospel free negroes ... on conviction, may be punished by ... lashes....'\n\f       [ ... ] The statutes of South Carolina make it a highly penal offense for any person, white or\n       colored, to teach slaves; and similar provisions are to be found running through all the\n       statutes of the late slaveholding States.... The purpose of the bill ... is to destroy all these\n       discriminations....\"\n\nAdamson, 332 U.S. at 99-100, 67 S.Ct. at 1700 (quoting Cong. Globe, 39th Cong. 1st Sess. 474\n\n(1865)). This does not suggest that the term \"liberty\" as used in the Fourteenth Amendment applies\n\nonly to race-conscious statutes, indeed the plain language of the Fourteenth Amendment admits a\n\nbroader interpretation. However, it does suggest a context in which to decide how to interpret the\n\nAmendment consistent with the drafters' intent, a context that was not intended to include abortion.\n\n       I recognize that the Supreme Court has not accepted this approach. Indeed, the Court has\n\nrecently held that such a fixed interpretive guideline is unhelpful in interpreting the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment. In Casey, the plurality stated that the Court should examine each case as it comes, ad\n\nhoc, to determine what substantive rights the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees, using \"reasoned\n\njudgment.\" Casey, 505 U.S. at 849, 112 S.Ct. at 2806. The power of Article III courts to invalidate\n\nstate laws under the Constitution is not so expansive—even the reasoned judgment of our wisest\n\njurists cannot replace the written constitution as authority.\n\n       Casey best illustrates the approach taken by the Supreme Court. Near the end of the plurality\n\nopinion, the Court says that \"[e]ach generation must learn anew that the Constitution's written terms\n\nembody ideas and aspirations that survive more ages than one.\" Casey, 505 U.S. at 901, 112 S.Ct.\n\nat 2833. This is in line with my earlier suggestion that old understandings apply to new situations and\n\nthat the Constitution is limited by its words. But that is not what the Casey court actually did in the\n\nopinion. In deciding whether the abortion regulations at stake fell within the ambit of the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment, the court cited Justice Harlan's dissent in Poe v. Ullman. Specifically the Court quoted\n\ntwo extensive passages of that opinion. First, the Court asserted that neither the Bill of Rights nor\n\nthe specific practices of states at the time of the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment marks the\n\nouter limits of substantive due process:\n\n       \"[T]he full scope of the liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause cannot be found in or\n       limited by the precise terms of the specific guarantees elsewhere provided in the Constitution.\n       This \"liberty' is not a series of isolated points pricked out in terms of the taking of property;\n       the freedom of speech, press, and religion; the right to keep and bear arms; the freedom from\n       unreasonable searches and seizures; and so on. It is a rational continuum which, broadly\n\f        speaking, includes a freedom from all substantial arbitrary impositions and purposeless\n        restraints, ... and which also recognizes, what a reasonable and sensitive judgment must, that\n        certain interests require particularly careful scrutiny of the state needs asserted to justify their\n        abridgement.\"\n\nCasey, 505 U.S. at 848-49, 112 S.Ct. at 2805 (quoting Poe, 367 U.S. at 543, 81 S.Ct. at 1777\n\n(Harlan, J., dissenting on jurisdictional grounds)). The Casey Court continued, quoting from Poe,\n\nthat the adjudication of substantive due process claims has traditionally been, and will continue to be,\n\na matter of \"reasoned judgment\":\n\n        \"Due process has not been reduced to any formula; its content cannot be determined by\n        reference to any code. The best that can be said is that through the course of this Court's\n        decisions it has represented the balance which our Nation, built upon postulates of respect for\n        the liberty of the individual, has struck between that liberty and the demands of organized\n        society. If the supplying of content to this Constitutional concept has of necessity been a\n        rational process, it certainly has not been one where judges have felt free to roam where\n        unguided speculation might take them. The balance of which I speak is the balance struck by\n        this country, having regard to what history teaches are the traditions from which it developed\n        as well as the traditions from which it broke. That tradition is a living thing. A decision of\n        this Court which radically departs from it could not long survive, while a decision which\n        builds on what has survived is likely to be sound. No formula could serve as a substitute, in\n        this area, for judgment and restraint.\"\n\nCasey, 505 U.S. at 849-50, 112 S.Ct. at 2806, (quoting Poe, 367 U.S. at 542, 81 S.Ct. at 1776\n\n(Harlan, J., dissenting on jurisdictional grounds)). The two block quotes selected by the Court from\n\nPoe are perhaps more telling for what they omitted, however. For between these two long, lofty (and\n\ntransposed) quotes in Poe, lie two telling sentences. After the above-quoted sentence, \"No formula\n\ncould serve as a substitute, in this area, for judgment and restraint[,]\" Justice Harlan continued:\n\n        It is this outlook which has led the Court continuingly to perceive distinctions in the\n        imperative character of Constitutional provisions, since that character must be discerned from\n        a particular provision's larger context. And inasmuch as this context is not one of words, but\n        of history and purposes, the full scope of the liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause\n        cannot be found in or limited by the precise terms of the specific guarantees elsewhere\n        provided in the Constitution.\n\nPoe, 367 U.S. at 543, 81 S.Ct. at 1777 (Harlan, J., dissenting on jurisdictional grounds) (emphasis\n\nadded). This omitted quote highlights Justice Harlan's approach, employed by the Casey Court, of\n\nusing history and tradition in general, not the written Consti tution, to delimit the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment. See also Griswold, 381 U.S. at 501, 85 S.Ct. at 1691 (Harlan, J., concurring) (rejecting\n\nJustice Douglas's restriction of substantive due process to the Bill of Rights and suggesting that\n\njudicial restraint may be achieved in the Fourteenth Amendment context \"only by continual insistence\n\fupon respect for the teachings of history, solid reco gnition of the basic values that underlie our\n\nsociety, and wise appreciation of the great roles that the doctrines of federalism and separation of\n\npowers have played in establishing and preserving American freedoms.\").\n\n        The Court is no longer interpreting the words of the Constitution; after Casey it is\n\ninterpreting history. Words such as \"rational continuum,\" \"substantial arbitrary impositions,\"\n\n\"purposeless restraints,\" and \"balance ... which our Nation has struck\" are code words intended to\n\nevoke emotional and rhetorical fealty, yet they have no meaning independent of that given them by\n\nfive Justices. The people's Constitution—at least as to unenumerated constitutional rights—has\n\nbecome the Court's Constitution. Those principles most conducive to the people's happiness now\n\ncome not from the people, but from Platonic guardians. Justice Black has been proven right, arguing\n\nin his dissent in Griswold against such an ambitious use of the Due Process Clause: \"For myself it\n\nwould be most irksome to be ruled by a bevy of Platonic Guardians, even if I knew how to choose\n\nthem, which I assuredly do not.\" Griswold, 381 U.S. at 526-27, 85 S.Ct. at 1705 (Black, J.,\n\ndissenting) (quoting Learned Hand, The Bill of Rights 70 (1958)).\n\n        As the Supreme Court said in Bowers v. Hardwick, \"The Court is most vulnerable and comes\n\nnearest to illegitimacy when it deals with judge-made constitutional law having little or no cognizable\n\nroots in the language or design of the Constitution.\" 478 U.S. 186, 194, 106 S.Ct. 2841, 2846, 92\n\nL.Ed.2d 140 (1986). Interestingly, the Court does not even conduct such a historical review in Casey\n\nto bolster Roe 's \"doct rinal footing,\" nor does it accept or refer to the history cited in Roe as\n\ncompelling. See Casey, 505 U.S. at 849-50, 112 S.Ct. at 2806.\n\n                                                   B\n\n        In part because of the Supreme Court's ambiguity about the scope of substantive due process,\n\nit is unclear to me that the Court itself still believes that abortion is a \"fundamental right\" under the\n\nFourteenth Amendment. In the narrow context of this concurrence, I will not canvas the Supreme\n\nCourt's entire line of abortion cases. For the purposes of this opinion, it is necessary only to point\n\nout that the Court's more recent decisions indicate tepid support for Roe v. Wade. If Roe is no longer\n\nthe best interpretation of the Constitution, then our authority to strike the Louisiana statute is very\n\ftenuous.\n\n        In Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the Court in a fractured joint opinion upheld Roe 's \"central\n\nholding,\" but did not defend Roe as a sound reading of the Constitution. 505 U.S. at 860-61, 112\n\nS.Ct. at 2812. Instead, it upheld Roe out of concerns for the abstract, nonconstitutional value of\n\nstare decisis, for the institutional credibility of the Court, and because of the primacy of settled\n\nexpectations about constitutional law. Id. (\"Within the bounds of normal stare decisis analysis, then,\n\nand subject to the considerations on which it customarily turns, the stronger argument is for affirming\n\nRoe 's central holding, with whatever degree of personal reluctance any of us may have....\").\n\n        The joint opinion in Casey was correct to consider the force of precedent and the value of\n\nsettled expectations. However, I think that the Court would have been mo re in line with the\n\nConstitution had it given effect to its conclusion that Roe is wrong. Where the Constitution is the\n\nsource of a court's power, it must interpret the Constitution first and consider institutional credibility\n\nsecond. Where, for example, the Court finds that it does not have the constitutional authority to\n\nstrike a state law, its own prior opinions (especially erroneous ones) do not grant that authority, stare\n\ndecisis notwithstanding.\n\n        The Casey Court asserted that it should not overrule cases, especially cases such as Roe,\n\nlightly. It explained: \"a decision to overrule should rest on some special reason over and above the\n\nbelief that a prior case was wrongly decided.\" Casey, 505 U.S. at 864, 112 S.Ct. at 2813, (citing\n\nMitchell v.

But these dissents do not impress upon me why the Supreme Court\n\n(or any Article III court) should derive the authority to evaluate state laws under its own precedents\n\nand not under the best reading of the Constitution. What more should the Court need in order to\n\noverrule a prior case than its studied conclusion, based on the words of the Constitution, that the case\n\nhad been wrongly decided?\n\n        Roe and its progeny, including Bellotti II, have always stood on precarious constitutional\n\nfooting for the reasons I indicated in the last section. After Casey, these cases may not even be\n\fconstitutional law. They might best be considered vestigial precedents propped up only by the judicial\n\ncreation of stare decisis.\n\n                                                     II\n\n        Perhaps because of the difficulties of restricting substantive due process, the Supreme Court\n\nassumed what can only be called legislative duties in Bellotti v. Baird, 443 U.S. 622, 99 S.Ct. 3035,\n\n61 L.Ed.2d 797 (1979) (\"Bellotti II \").            In Bellotti II, the Supreme Court addressed the\n\nconstitutionality of a Massachusetts statute restricting minors' access to abortion. The Bellotti II\n\nCourt held that minors have the same abortion rights as women who have reached the age of\n\nmajority, and that the Massachusetts's parental consent law unduly burdened minors' exercise of that\n\nright. Bellotti II, 443 U.S. at 647, 99 S.Ct. at 3050. But the Court did not stop there. It continued,\n\nstating that the Court's interpretation of the word \"liberty\" in the Fourteenth Amendment required\n\nthat, when states seek to regulate minors' access to abortions,\n\n        every minor must have the opportunity—if she so desires—to go directly to a court without\n        first consulting or notifying her parents. If she satisfies the court that she is mature and well\n        enough informed to make intelligently the abortion decision on her own, the court must\n        authorize her to act without parental consultation or consent. If she fails to satisfy the court\n        that she is competent to make this decision independently, she must be permitted to show that\n        an abortion nevertheless would be in her best interests. If the court is persuaded that it is, the\n        court must authorize the abortion.\n\nId. at 647-48, 99 S.Ct. at 3050. The Court thus decided that a minor seeking an abortion without\n\nparental consent must be afforded a prompt hearing in court; must be allowed to have an abortion\n\nif the court decides she is mature enough to make the decision herself; and must be allowed to\n\nproceed if the court determines an abortion is in her best interests. Id. Regardless of whether that is\n\ngood policy, I am not confident that there is a principled way to reach that conclusion from the word\n\n\"liberty\" in the Fourteenth Amendment. By promulgating specific, minimum requirements for state\n\nparental consent statutes despite a complete vacuum of Constitutional authority, the Court's opinion\n\nin Bellotti II has the distinct flavor of judicial legislation.\n\n        Bellotti II addresses policy concerns with parental consent statutes, elevates those concerns\n\nto constitutional heights, then declares Massachusetts's nonconforming po licy decisions to be\n\nunconstitutional. This line of reasoning amounts to little more than a tautology. By positing a\n\ffundamental right to abortion and by classifying regulations that jurists deem unwise as an \"undue\n\nburden\" on that right, federal judges risk constitutionalizing their policy preferences regarding any\n\nof the catalogue of substantive Fourteenth Amendment rights.\n\n        As one might expect, such backward induction yields conflicting and seemingly arbitrary\n\nresults. For example, we are instructed in Bellotti II that parental consent requirements are\n\nunconstitutional, 443 U.S. at 649-50, 99 S.Ct. at 3051, yet in Casey we are told that the Constitution\n\ndoes not invalidate informed consent requirements, 505 U.S. at 887, 112 S.Ct. at 2826. In Akron I,\n\nwe learn that women have a fundamental right to an abortion that prohibits states from imposing a\n\ntwenty-four hour waiting period, Akron v. Akron Center for Reprod. Health, 462 U.S. 416, 450, 103\n\nS.Ct. 2481, 2503, 76 L.Ed.2d 687 (1983), while in Casey we learn that \"liberty\" does not prohibit\n\nsuch a twenty-four hour waiting period, 505 U.S. at 885, 112 S.Ct. at 2824 (overruling Akron I ).\n\nThe Court's different opinions about the best way to administer a \"fundamental right\" to abortion may\n\nbe sensible; on the other hand they may not. But in any event they are not driven by the Constitution.\n\n        As illustrated by Bellotti II, the due process clause has become a blank check, redeemable for\n\nwhatever rights the courts fashion. This is no rule of law, and it is certainly not constitutionalism.\n\nThe Supreme Court's abortion jurisprudence assures us that our panel has authority under the\n\nConstitution to strike portions of Louisiana's parental consent statute. But because this jurisprudence\n\nno longer derives its force from the written Constitution, I hesitate to invoke Bellotti II to strike this\n\nlaw.\n\n                                                   III\n\n        Aside from serious concerns about substantive due process, I have a pragmatic objection to\n\ncourts substituting their judgments about this type of policy question for the decisions of legislatures.\n\nAs I have asserted before, I think that the modern abortion cases are less about policy than about\n\npower. Sojourner T. v. Edwards, 974 F.2d 27, 31 (Garza, J., concurring specially) (quoting Casey,\n\n505 U.S. at 981, 112 S.Ct. at 2874 (Scalia, J., dissenting in part)). The last two sections have\n\noutlined my belief that the Constitution has vested the power to decide these hotly contested,\n\nnonconstitutional issues in the state legislatures. See U.S. Const. amend. IX and X. In addition to\n\fmy beliefs about the constitutional authority of Article III courts, I also think that these issues are\n\nbetter decided over time by democratic, political institutions. See generally Cass R. Sunstein,\n\nForeword: Leaving Things Undecided, 110 Harv. L.Rev. 4 (1996) (arguing for narrow judicial\n\ndecisions in cases involving constitutional and moral uncertainty).\n\n       The Supreme Court's abortion jurisprudence epitomizes a trend toward centralizing and\n\nconstitutionalizing the most controversial issues of public policy. I believe that expanding the\n\njurisdiction and power of the courts in order to speed the pace of change is unjustified. Where the\n\nConstitution does not dictate otherwise, the proper mode of political reform is through enlightened\n\ndebate, political experimentation, and change. We are a pluralistic nation with strong individualist\n\nideals. One large component of American civic virtue is public debate over issues. To be sure, this\n\nrequires patience, because self-determination is not a guarantee of correctness the first time or every\n\ntime. State legislatures will occasionally pass \"silly\" laws. See, e.g., Griswold, 381 U.S. at 527, 85\n\nS.Ct. at 1705 (Stewart, J., dissenting). Some states may be slower than others in coming to what may\n\neventually be a national consensus on an issue. But the ideal is that, through public discourse and\n\nexperimentation, states will reconsider anachronistic laws, adapt, change, and find the public policies\n\nthat work best. Where these issues are not constitutional, it demeans the ideal of democracy for the\n\ncourts to decide these issues for the people, especially under a strained interpretation of the\n\nConstitution.\n\n       Some have justified an ambitious judicial role in abortion cases by suggesting that the\n\nSupreme Court has a special calling to unite the nation in high-stakes cases in which people\n\npassionately disagree. In Casey, the Court stated that such cases carry a special \"dimension\" that\n\nplaces those opinions in a class by themselves:\n\n       Where, in the performance of its judicial duties, the Court decides a case in such a way as to\n       resolve the sort of intensely divisive controversy reflected in Roe and those rare, comparable\n       cases, its decision has a dimension that the resolution of the normal case does not carry. It\n       is the dimension present whenever the Court's interpretation of the Constitution calls the\n       contending sides of a nat ional controversy to end their national division by accepting a\n       common mandate rooted in the Constitution.\n\nCasey, 505 U.S. at 866-67, 112 S.Ct. at 2815. The Court suggested that the two cases exemplifying\n\nthis call to a common mandate were Roe v. Wade and Brown v. Board of Education. But as Justice\n\fScalia pointed out in his Casey dissent, Roe did not settle the political issue of legalized abortion. No\n\none accepted a common mandate in that case. In retrospect, it is clear that the Suprem e Court's\n\nintervention in the debate clouded the issues, inflaming those who believe that there is no\n\nconstitutional right to abortion and forcing advocates of legalized abortion to defend abortion \"rights\"\n\nunder Roe. Today we see that even many of those who believe that abortion should be legal do not\n\nsupport Roe v. Wade as faithful interpretation of the Constitution. See Casey, 505 U.S. at 860-61,\n\n112 S.Ct. at 2812 (joint opinion reluctantly upholding Roe on stare decisis grounds); see also Ruth\n\nBader Ginsburg, Some Thoughts on Autonomy and Equality in Relation to Roe v. Wade, 63 N.C.\n\nL.Rev. 375, 385-86 (1985) (criticizing the \"[h]eavy handed judicial intervention\" of the Roe court and\n\nsuggesting an alternative starting point for analysis in abortion cases).\n\n        Roe did not mark the end of t he debate or the acceptance of a common mandate, but the\n\nbeginning of a bitter national exegesis. In this respect, Roe is more like Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S.\n\n537, 16 S.Ct. 1138, 41 L.Ed. 256 (1896), than Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct.\n\n686, 98 L.Ed. 873 (1954) (Brown I ). Plessy, like Roe, represented an attempt to read into the\n\nConstitution one view of history and social policy neither explicit nor fairly implied from the\n\nConstitutional text. \"Separate but equal\" may have been an attempt to solve a contentious issue of\n\nthe 1890s, but it was not constitutional interpretation. Plessy did not unite the nation behind the idea\n\nthat segregation was consistent with the Civil War Amendments. As in its abortion cases, the Court\n\noccasionally upheld the \"central holding\" of Plessy on stare decisis grounds, before finally overruling\n\nit in Brown I, 347 U.S. at 494-95, 74 S.Ct. at 691-92. I suggest this comparison not necessarily to\n\ndraw any moral parallel between slavery and abortion, but rather to point out that the Court's\n\ninsertion of itself as the final arbiter of the abortion debate is unlikely to prove more successful than\n\nits attempt in Plessy.\n\n        Plessy is not the only time our nation has faced a conflict between faithful interpretation and\n\nstare decisis. We learned the same lesson about ambitious judicial intervention again in the early\n\ntwentieth century, even in the same substantive due process context, in the line of cases following\n\nLochner v. New York, 198 U.S. 45, 25 S.Ct. 539, 49 L.Ed. 937 (1905). In Lochner and its progeny,\n\fthe Court established and upheld on stare decisis grounds the laissez-faire notion that state regulation\n\nof worker health and welfare violated the substantive due process rights of employers in liberty of\n\ncontract. See, e.g., Adkins v. Children's Hospital of District of Columbia, 261 U.S. 525, 43 S.Ct.\n\n394, 67 L.Ed. 785 (1923). The Court later overruled Adkins and signaled the end of the Lochner era\n\nin West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, 300 U.S. 379, 57 S.Ct. 578, 81 L.Ed. 703 (1937), holding that\n\nthe Due Process Clause did not contain implicit protections of absolute liberty of contract.\n\n       In fact, the very first substantive due process case tel ls the same story. In Dred Scott v.\n\nSanford, 60 U.S. (How.) 393, 450, 15 L.Ed. 691 (1856), the Court held, among other things, that\n\na slave owner did not lose his property interest in the slave when he traveled with the slave to a free\n\nstate. In what could be described as the beginning of substantive due process, the Court held that a\n\nsection of the Missouri Compromise, which would have recognized such slaves as free, was\n\nunconstitutional. The Court held that such governmental intrusion on private property rights,\n\nregardless of procedural safeguards, \"could hardly be dignified with the name of due process of law.\"\n\nId. This was the first time since Marbury v. Madison that the Court used the power of judicial review,\n\nand the first time ever t hat the Court invalidated a statute under judicial review. That a notion as\n\ncontroversial as substantive due process sprang from such a cataclysmic opinion is revealing.\n\n       Dred Scott was fashioned as an opinion to put an end to a bitter dispute in America. It took\n\none of the most contentious and personal of political issues out of the national debate. But instead\n\nof resolving controversies, Dred Scott tore the nation apart. Although Roe and its progeny have not\n\nresulted in a civil war, the peace over abortion since 1973 has been anything but civil. The last twenty\n\nyears have seen political protest over the Court's abortion jurisprudence unmatched by any other\n\npolitical issue of our day. Protest marches, clinic bombings, and fatal shootings have punctuated the\n\ndebate. Putting the lid on this pot has caused it to boil over. Regular debate, lobbying, and\n\nlegislation at the state level, as contemplated by the Constitution, may diffuse political pressure,\n\nrelieve tensions, and provide for nuanced answers to hard questions about abortion. Removing such\n\nissues from the people prevents their vetting at the local level and requires the political pressure to\n\nbe released outside the bounds of civil debate.\n\f        In Dred Scott, Plessy, and Lochner, the Court made things worse by inserting itself into, and\n\npreempting, the national debate. Although at one time these cases were also defensible on stare\n\ndecisis grounds, they are not celebrated cases in our history. By contrast, the cases in which the\n\nCourt overruled such precedents, such as Brown I and West Coast Hotel, are celebrated as\n\nconstitutional moments. It is of course easier to discern between the two types of cases in retrospect.\n\nI think that enough history has passed for us confidently to conclude that Roe belongs in the former\n\ncategory, cases in which the Court intervened to settle a national debate by way of expansive\n\nconstitutional interpretation. It remains for our Supreme Court to write the analog to West Coast\n\nHotel extricating itself from the substantive due process morass of abortion cases and returning the\n\ndebate to the people.\n\n        Deliberation about this subject, although heated, is healthy. As a nation, we have not reached\n\na consensus about when life begins; we have not finally determined the proper interplay between a\n\nmother's liberty, the interests of an unborn child, and the state's interests in protecting life. At an\n\nontological level, we the people have yet to decide whether person defines life or life defines person.\n\nAs technology allows fetal independence at an earlier and earlier age, our understanding of these\n\nquestions will not remain static. The Constitution, in all its prescience, does not answer these\n\nquestions. Such ontic questions are quintessentially the right of the people to decide. In abortion\n\ncases, law presupposes a theory of ethics and morality, which in turn presupposes deeply personal\n\nideas about being and existence. Our answers to such questions as when life begins define our ethical\n\nbeliefs, and these ethical beliefs should determine how we govern ourselves. It is a serious mistake\n\nto try to reverse this order, to make our law determine how we decide these fundamental, personal,\n\nontic issues. Abortion in this context is less a question about constitutional law, and more about who\n\nwe are as a people. I submit that this is a decision the Supreme Court cannot make. Liberty is not\n\ncoextensive with license; it therefore must have limits. Those limits may be imposed only by the\n\npeople, either in their Constitution or through their laws, not legislated by the courts. Taking these\n\nissues out of the public discourse threatens to foment hostility, stifle the search for answers, distance\n\npeople from their Constitution, and undermine the credibility of that document.\n\f                                                    IV\n\n         Bellotti II represents a type of legislating that is better left to Congress or the states. In many\n\ncases, the courts must fill in gaps in statutes, account for unforeseen circumstances, or decide difficult\n\nissues that legislators avoid. However, in this instance, Louisiana actually did exercise its legislative\n\npowers; it debated and struggled and made tough choices. Now we are nullifying Louisiana's choice,\n\nnot under the Constitution, but under Roe 's continuing authority based on stare decisis.\n\n         Therefore it is not impertinence that makes me question the Supreme Court's abortion\n\njurisprudence, but institutional modesty.        I am uncomfortable invoking the authority of the\n\nConstitution to invalidate this statute, especially under such an ambiguous mandate from the\n\nConstitution. Although the Court said in Bellotti II that Roe and the Fourteenth Amendment set\n\nminimum standards for parental consent statutes, it is unclear that the post-Casey Supreme Court still\n\nbelieves that the Constitution demands this outcome. Overturning Louisiana's legislature on such thin\n\nauthority runs dangerously close to anticonstitutional hubris. As Abraham Lincoln said of Dred\n\nScott:\n\n         The candid citizen must confess that if the policy of the government, upon vital questions\n         affecting the whole people, is to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court, the\n         instant they are made, in ordinary litigation between parties in personal actions, the people\n         will have ceased to be their own rulers, having, to that extent, practically resigned the\n         government into the hands of that eminent tribunal.\n\nAbraham Lincoln, First Inaugural Address—Final Text (Mar. 4, 1861), in 4 The Collected Works\n\nof Abraham Lincoln 262, 268 (Roy P.

GARZA and STEWART, Circuit Judges.\n\n       STEWART, Circuit Judge:\n\n       We must decide whether certain provisions of Act 1254 (codified at La. R.S. 40:1299.35.5\n\n(West Supp.1996)), which changed Louisiana's judicial bypass procedure for minors seeking\n\nabortions, comports with the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. We hold that it\n\ndoes not and affirm the district court's summary judgment which permanently enjoined La. R.S.\n\n40:1299.35.5(B).\n\n                                LEGISLATIVE BACKGROUND\n\n       In Louisiana, minors under the age of eighteen must obtain the consent of at least one parent\n\nor legal guardian before a physician has the legal authority to perform an abortion. La. R.S.\n\n40:1299.35.5(A) (West 1992). However, a physician may perform the abortion without the consent\n\nof a parent or legal guardian if t he minor exercises her rights under a judicial bypass procedure\n\nprescribed in La. R.S. 40:1299.35.5(B). Section 1299.35.5(B) has, since 1978, undergone changes.\n\nBecause this appeal largely turns on the 1995 changes to § 1299.35.5(B), we bel ieve that a brief\n\nreview of the legislative history of § 1299.35.5(B) sheds valuable light on the issues before us.\n\nA. The 1978 Version of La. R.S. 40:1299.35.5(B)\n\n       We begin in 1978, when the Louisiana Legislature enacted La. R.S. 40:1299.35.5 (the 1978\n\fAct), which, among other things, regulated the circumstances under which minors could obtain\n\nabortions. Notably, the 1978 Act, while providing for a judicial bypass, gave little (if any) guidance\n\nto courts faced with minors seeking abortions. Subsection (A) of the 1978 Act, titled \"Notice and\n\nconsent,\" provided that the parents or legal guardian of a minor under eighteen must receive actual\n\nnotice twenty-four hours before the minor had an abortion or, if the parent or legal guardian could\n\nnot be reached, that parent or legal guardian must receive constructive notice seventy-two hours\n\nbefore the abortion. The sole exception to these parental notification requirements was a bare-bones\n\njudicial bypass provision, which stated simply \"unless the abortion is ordered by a court having\n\njurisdiction over such minor pregnant woman.\" Subsection (B) provided that if the minor was under\n\nthe age of fifteen, she must obtain informed, written consent from a parent or legal guardian or\n\n\"obtain[ ] an order from a court having jurisdiction over her that the abortion be performed or\n\ninduced.\" Neither subsection (A) nor (B) provided any criteria that must be met before a judge could,\n\nwithout any notice to the parent(s) or legal guardian(s), order a minor to have an abortion.\n\n        Then, in 1979, the Supreme Court handed down Bellotti v. Baird, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110145\"><a href=\"/opinion/110145/bellotti-v-baird/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">622</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110145\"><a href=\"/opinion/110145/bellotti-v-baird/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">797</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1979) (Bellotti II ), in which a plurality of the Court set forth the standards\n\nthat should govern the judicial bypass procedure for minors seeking abortions. Recognizing the\n\nparent-child tension that may accompany a minor's wish to have an abortion, the Court held that a\n\nminor may seek an order from a court, without the consent or notification of a parent or legal\n\nguardian, that authorizes the procedure. Id. at 646-48, 99 S.Ct. at 3049-51. In particular, the Court\n\nheld:\n\n        If she satisfies the court that she is mature and well enough informed to make intelligently the\n        abortion decision on her own, the court must authorize her to act without parental\n        consultation or consent. If she fails to satisfy the court that she is competent to make this\n        decision independently, she must be permitted to show that an abortion nevertheless would\n        be in her best interests. If the court is persuaded that it is, the court must authorize the\n        abortion.\n\nId. at 647-48, 99 S.Ct. at 3050 (emphasis added). Approximately eight months after Bellotti II was\n\ndecided, Louisiana's skeletal judicial bypass provision was struck down as inconsistent with Bellotti\n\nII. In Margaret S. v. Edwards, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1400028\"><a href=\"/opinion/1400028/margaret-s-v-edwards/\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">181</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 203 (E.D.La.1980) (Margaret S.(I) ), the district\n\ncourt held: \"This section [§ 1299.35.5(B) ] says nothing more than the pregnant minor may receive\n\fan order from a \"court having jurisdiction over her that the abortion be performed or induced.' This\n\nis not enough.... La.Rev.Stat.Ann. § 40:1299.35.5(B) sets forth no standards or guidelines for the\n\nminor seeking judicial approval for abortion.\"\n\nB. The 1980 and 1981 Versions of La. R.S. 40:1299.35.5(B)\n\n       In 1980, the Louisiana Legislature responded to Margaret S.(I) and, among other things,\n\nchanged La. R.S. 40:1299.35.5(B) to comply with Bellotti II. Most importantly for purposes of this\n\nappeal, the new statute contained the mandatory language from the Bellotti II decision. La. R.S.\n\n40:1299.35.5(B) provided in part: \"The court shall authorize the abortion only if the court finds that\n\nthe woman is sufficiently mature and well-informed to make an intelligent decision on her own\n\nconcerning the abortion, or, if the court finds that regardless of the capacity of the woman to make\n\nthe decision, the abortion would be in her best interest.\" (Emphasis added). The 1980 version also\n\nincluded an expediency clause: \"Such applications shall be heard summarily and expeditiously and\n\nshall take precedence over matters on the docket of the court.\" (Emphasis added).\n\n       In 1981, Louisiana modified its abortion statute, beginning with a general statement of\n\nlegislative intent. Section 1299.35.0 (West 1992) provided in part: \"It is the intention of the\n\nLegislature of the State of Louisiana to regulate abortion to the extent permitted by decisions of the\n\nUnited States Supreme Court.\" In 1981, the legislature also refined and expanded § 1299.35.5(B),\n\nand the pertinent sections read as follows:\n\n       (3) Each application shall be heard in chambers, confidentially, in a summary manner, and\n       within forty-eight hours of the filing thereof.\n\n       (4) If the court finds that the minor is sufficiently mature and well enough informed to make\n       the decision concerning the abortion on her own, the court shall issue an order authorizing\n       the minor to act on the matter without parental consultation or consent.\n\n       (5) If the court finds that the minor is not competent to make the decision concerning the\n       abortion on her own, but finds that the abortion nevertheless would be in the best interest of\n       the minor, the court shall issue an order authorizing the abortion.\n\n(Emphasis added). Subsections (4) and (5) parsed out the \"maturity and well-informed\" provision\n\nand the \"best-interests-of-the-minor\" inquiry. As with the 1980 version, the 1981 version of §\n\n1299.35.5(B) retained the mandatory \"shall\" language. However, the word \"expeditiously\" was\n\nremoved and a forty-eight hour time frame for hearing a minor's application was imposed. With these\n\fnew changes in place, § 1299.35.5(B) survived a constitutional attack the next time around. See\n\nMargaret S. v.

In 1995, however, the Louisiana Legislature went back to\n\nthe drawing board with Act 1254, which expanded and changed § 1299.35.5(B) to read in part:\n\n       (3) Each application shall be heard in chambers, anonymously, in a summary manner, and\n       within forty-eight hours of the filing thereof.\n\n       (4) If the court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that the minor is sufficiently mature\n       and well enough informed to make the decision concerning the abortion on her own, the court\n       may issue an order authorizing the minor to act on the matter. Prior to any such order, the\n       court may require the minor to participate in an evaluation and counseling session with a\n       mental health professional from the Department of Health and Hospitals, office of mental\n       health, and a staff member from the Department of Social Services, office of community\n       services. The court may refer the petitioner, if necessary, to the appropriate Department of\n       Health and Hospitals, office of mental health regional office to arrange the evaluation and\n       counseling session within forty-eight hours of the ex parte hearing, excluding legal holidays.\n\n       (5) If the court finds that the minor is not sufficiently mature and well enough informed to\n       make a decision intelligently among the alternatives, the court shall decide whether or not it\n       would be in the best interest of the minor to notify her parents or guardian of the proceedings.\n       If the court finds that it is in the minor's best interest to notify her parents or guardian, the\n       court shall so notify and reconvene the proceedings within forty-eight hours with the parents\n       or guardian present to advise and counsel the minor and aid the court in making its\n       determination whether or not the abortion would be in the best interest of the minor.\n\n       (6) If the court finds that the minor is not competent to make the decision concerning the\n       abortion or that it would not be in the minor's best interest to notify her parents or guardian,\n       the court may issue an order authorizing the abo rtion if the court finds, by clear and\n       convincing evidence, that the abortion would be in the best interest of the minor.\n\n(Emphasis added). Three changes to Louisiana's bypass procedure are relevant for purposes of this\n\nappeal:2 (1) in subsections (4) and (6) (which correspond to subsections (4) and (5), respectively,\n\n\n   1\n    The district court in Margaret S. (II) stated that the 1981 judicial bypass procedure provided\nfor an \"expeditious hearing of the matter....\" 597 F.Supp. at 652. As we have noted, however,\nthe word \"expeditious[ ]\" was removed from the 1981 statute. The district court did not consider\nthe meaning of \"summary manner\" as defined under Louisiana law to determine whether the new\nsubsection (3) met the Bellotti II expedition requirement.\n   2\n    Although the plaintiffs challenged and the district court enjoined the expediency provision in\nsubsection (3), that subpart largely remained unchanged in Act 1254. The legislature only\nchanged \"confidentially\" to \"anonymously.\" This particular change has not been challenged by the\nplaintiffs.\n\fin the 1981 statute), \"shall\" has been changed to \"may,\" so that if the juvenile court finds that a minor\n\nis mature and well-informed or that an abortion would be in the minor's best interest, the court now\n\n\"may\" order an abortion; (2) subsection (4) permits judges to refer a minor to a state-sponsored\n\ncounseling and evaluation session within forty-eight hours of the ex parte hearing; and (3) subsection\n\n(5) states that a juvenile court judge is compelled to notify the parents or guardian of an immature\n\nminor if doing so is in the best interest of the minor.\n\n                                      PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n        On July 6, 1995, Causeway Medical Suite and Hope Medical Group for Women (plaintiffs)\n\nfiled suit challenging the constitutionality of Act 1254. The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief, claiming\n\nthat Act 1254 violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because Act 1254 (1)\n\nprovided juvenile court judges discretion to deny a minor an abortion even though the minor\n\ndemonstrated that she was mature and well-informed or that the abortion would be in her best\n\ninterest; (2) failed to establish a time limit for an expeditious resolution of the minor's bypass\n\napplication; (3) allowed the juvenile court to refer minors to state-sponsored evaluation and\n\ncounseling without providing any time frame within which counselors are to report back to the court,\n\nthereby depriving minors of an effective opportunity to obtain an abortion and preventing the minor\n\nfrom remaining anonymous; and (4) breached the minor's confidentiality by permitting the juvenile\n\ncourt to notify the minor's parent that she is seeking an abortion if the court finds such notification\n\nwould be in the minor's best interest.\n\n        With one exception,3 the district court agreed with the plaintiffs on each of these points. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">905</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">360</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 364-66 (E.D.La.1995). Acco rdingly, the district court entered summary judgment,\n\npermanently enjoining Act 1254 because it \"constitute[d] an undue burden on the right of minors to\n\nhave access to abortion services by way of a judicial bypass of the parental consent requirement and\n\nthus violates the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\" Id. at 366. This appeal\n\n   3\n    The district court did not rule on the plaintiff's claim that the state-sponsored counseling\nprovision impermissibly breached anonymity. On appeal, the plaintiffs resurrect this argument.\nWe decline to address this claim, however, because it is unnecessary to the disposition of this\ncase. The counseling and evaluation provision is facially unconstitutional for another reason\ndiscussed in Part IV.A.2, infra.\n\ffollowed.\n\n                                           DISCUSSION\n\n       The State makes three claims on appeal. First, it claims that the plaintiffs do not have standing\n\nto bring this lawsuit because there is no \"case or controversy .\" Second, the State argues that the\n\nproper standard of proof for facial challenges requires plaintiffs to demonstrate that Act 1254, under\n\nno set of circumstances, is constitutional. Third, and central to this appeal, the State contends that\n\neach of the challenged provisions is facially constitutional. We reject each of these contentions.\n\nI.

And the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to\n\n28 U.S.C. § 1343 because the plaintiffs seek redress for a deprivation of a constitutional right under\n\ncolor of state law.\n\nIII. THE STANDARD OF PROOF FOR FACIAL CHALLENGES TO ABORTION STATUTES\n\n        The plaintiffs in this case have brought a facial challenge, claiming that Act 1254 on its face\n\nviolates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Supreme Court has articulated\n\ntwo approaches to proving a statute is facially unconstitutional. In United States v. Salerno, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111891\"><a href=\"/opinion/111891/united-states-v-salerno/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">739</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111891\"><a href=\"/opinion/111891/united-states-v-salerno/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

However, in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v.

Plainly, more statutes will survive a\n\nfacial attack under Salerno than under Casey.\n\n        Shortly after Casey was decided, we held in Barnes v.

Since our decision in Barnes, however, no clear consensus among federal courts has\n\nemerged regarding the standard for facial challenges in a post-Casey world. Six Justices from the\n\nSupreme Court have expressed their views on this issue, but not in cases receiving a full hearing by\n\nthe Court. Justices O'Connor, Souter, and Stevens have made it clear that the Casey standard\n\ncontrols in the abortion context. See Janklow v.

See\n\nJanklow, --- U.S. at ---- - ----, 116 S.Ct. at 1584-87 (Scalia, J., joined by Rehnquist, C.J. & Thomas,\n\nJ., dissenting from denial of certiorari). There is also considerable disagreement among the lower\n\nfederal courts on this issue.4 See generally Ruth Burdick, Note, The Casey Undue Burden Standard:\n\nProblems Predicted and Encountered, and the Split Over the Salerno Test, 23 HASTINGS CONST.\n\nL.Q. 825 (1996) (arguing that lower federal courts are likely to remain split over the Salerno-Casey\n\nchoice).\n\n       The district court avoided this thicket of disagreement, reasoning that under either approach,\n\nAct 1254 was unconstitutional. 905 F.Supp. at 363 n. 2. As such, the district court applied the more\n\nrigorous Salerno standard. Id. at 363. In this appeal, both parties urge us to confront head-on the\n\nquestion of the standard of proof that should govern facial challenges in abortion cases. Specifically,\n\nthe plaintiffs claim that the statements made by Justices O'Connor and Souter in Fargo Women's\n\nHealth Organization v. Schafer, 507 U.S. at 1014, 113 S.Ct. at 1669, and by Justice Stevens in\n\nJanklow call into doubt our prior holding in Barnes. On the other hand, the State asks us to follow\n\nour previous decision in Barnes because the Supreme Court has not conclusively resolved the\n\nconfusion in this area.\n\n           We are free to reconsider the correctness of a panel opinion, short of the full court sitting en\n\nbanc, if the Supreme Court has handed down an intervening decision that implicitly or explicitly\n\noverrules one of our prior decisions.

The wisdom of this\n\npolicy is illustrated here. As far as we can tell, the Court appears to be divided 3-3 on the Salerno-\n\nCasey debate, and it would be ill-advised for us to assume that the Court will abandon Salerno\n\nbecause three members of the Court now desire that result.5\n\n       More to the point, even assuming the statements in Fargo and Janklow amount to an\n\nintervening change in the law such that we may decline to follow Barnes, we nevertheless stay our\n\nhand on this contentious issue because its resolution is not necessary to the disposition of this case,\n\nfor whether viewed under Casey or Salerno, Act 1254 is unconstitutional on its face.6 Thus, like the\n\ndistrict court, we apply the more rigorous Salerno standard to Act 1254.\n\nIV.

There, the Court was faced with a challenge to a Massachusetts\n\nstatute which required a minor under the age of eighteen to obtain parental consent before an abortion\n\ncould be performed, but if such consent was not given, \" \"consent may be obtained by order of a\n\njudge of the superior court for good cause shown.' \" Id. at 625, 99 S.Ct. at 3039 (emphasis added).\n\nThe Massachusetts Supreme Court had interpreted this judicial bypass provision to mean that a minor\n\ncould not obtain a court order without any parental consent whatsoever. Id. at 646, 99 S.Ct. at 3049-\n\n50. Thus, in Bellotti II, the Court had to determine whether this bypass procedure satisfied the\n\nConstitution.\n\n       The Court held that it did not. The Court first recognized that parental consent statutes must\n\n\"provide an alternative procedure\" in the event the minor is unable to secure one or both parents'\n\nconsent. Id. at 643, 99 S.Ct. at 3048. Turning next to the Massachusetts bypass provision, the Court\n\nconcluded that Massachusetts's judicial bypass procedure \"would impose an undue burden upon the\n\nexercise by minors of the right to seek an abortion.\" Id. at 647, 99 S.Ct. at 3050. In reaching this\n\fconclusion, the Court presented the competing considerations underlying a minor's choice to\n\nterminate her pregnancy. The Court recognized that minors are vulnerable, less able than adults to\n\nmake informed and mature decisions, and that parents play a central role in childrearing. Id. at 634,\n\n99 S.Ct. at 3043. Balanced against these concerns, the Court noted, are the battle lines that often\n\ndevelop in families in which one or both parents have strong views about abortion—battle lines that\n\nprevent minors from obtaining abortions. Id. at 647, 99 S.Ct. at 3050. With these considerations in\n\nmind, the Court specified four constitutional requirements that must be built into parental consent\n\nstatutes. The Court wrote:\n\n       A pregnant minor is ent itled to such a proceeding to show either: (1) that she is mature\n       enough and well enough informed to make her abortion decision, in consultation with her\n       physician, independently of her parents' wishes; or (2) that even if she is not able to make this\n       decision independently, the desired abortion would be in her best interests. The proceeding\n       in which this showing is made must assure that a resolution of the issue, and any appeals that\n       may follow, will be completed with [3] anonymity and [4] sufficient expedition to provide an\n       effective opportunity for an abortion to be obtained.\n\nId. at 643-44, 99 S.Ct. at 3048 (footnote omitted); see also Ohio v.

If the minor demonstrates that she is mature,\n\nwell-informed, or that the abortion would be in her best interest, the Bellotti II Court held that the\n\nbypass decisionmaker \"must \" authorize the abortion. Bellotti II, 443 U.S. at 647, 648, 99 S.Ct. at\n\n3050, 3050-51 (emphasis added).

Stat.\n\fAnn. § 390.001(4)(a) (West 1981)). In reaching the conclusion that we should not abstain, we\n\nreasoned:\n\n        The language of Bellotti II is not permissive: \"[i]f [the minor] satisfies the court that she is\n        mature and well enough informed to make intelligently the abortion decision on her own, the\n        court must authorize her to act ...\" [Citation.] Thus, whether permissive or mandatory,\n        subsection 4(a) vests Florida courts with constitutionally impermissible discretion to ignore\n        a minor's maturity in determining whether to authorize her abortion.\n\nId. at 481 (original emphasis). Other Circuits have read Bellotti II in the same way.7\n\n        Bellotti II, of course, did not answer all of the questions surrounding minors' access to\n\nabortion. In fact, the fate of Bellotti II was at first unclear because it was decided by a plurality of\n\nthe Court.

However, as our discussion suggests, the Court has never\nquestioned the viability of the four Bellotti II requirements and we decline to do so in this case.\nMore importantly, the State backed off this claim at oral argument, where it conceded that Act\n1254 must be evaluated under Bellotti II.\n\f        Act 1254 changes Louisiana's judicial bypass procedure so that a minor who demonstrates\n\nthat she is mature, well-informed, or that an abortion would be in her best interest, \"may\" receive\n\njudicial authorization for the abortion. La. R.S. 40:1299.35.5(B)(4), (6). In addition, Act 1254 sets\n\nup a state-sponsored \"evaluation and counseling\" scheme to which a minor may be referred within\n\nforty-eight hours of a hearing before the juvenile court. La. R.S. 40:1299.35.5(B)(4). The plaintiffs\n\nchallenge (B)(4) and (6) on two grounds. First, the plaintiffs claim that (B)(4) and (6) violate the\n\nBellotti II principle that mature and well-informed minors and those for whom an abortion is in their\n\nbest interest must receive judicial authorization to have an abortion. Second, the plaintiffs claim that\n\n(B)(4)'s requirement that minors receive counseling from state health and social services agencies\n\nviolates the Bellotti II principle that bypass proceedings are to proceed expeditiously. The district\n\ncourt agreed with the plaintiffs on both issues. We discuss each of these holdings in turn.\n\n1. \"Shall\" versus \"May\" in § 1299.35.5(B)(4) and (6)\n\n        The 1981 version of § 1299.35.5(B) provided that if a minor demonstrates that she is either\n\nmature and well-informed or that the abortion would be in her best interest, the juvenile court \"shall\"\n\norder an abortion. La. R.S. 40:1299.35.5(B)(4), (5) (West 1992). As we noted above, this language\n\nappeared in Louisiana's judicial bypass statute because of the Supreme Court's decision in Bellotti II,\n\nwhich rendered the 1978 version of § 1299.35.5(B) unconstitutional. See Margaret S.(I), 488\n\nF.Supp. at 203. And with, among other things, the addition of the mandatory \"shall\" language, the\n\n1981 version of § 1299.35.5(B) survived a constitutional challenge. Margaret S.(II), 597 F.Supp.\n\nat 650-52.\n\n        Against this legislative backdrop, the district court declared § 1299.35.5(B)(4) and (6)\n\nunconstitutional. The court looked to the common meaning of the terms \"shall\" and \"may\" and\n\nconcluded that the Louisiana Legislature intended a change in the statutory framework governing the\n\njudicial bypass procedure. \"[T]he clear intent of the statutory amendment,\" reasoned the district\n\ncourt, \"was to grant the substantive power of discretion to the judges of this state that is directly\n\ncontrary to the rulings of the Supreme Court in Casey, Akron II and Bellotti II.\" 905 F.Supp. at 364.\n\n        The State in its briefs and at oral argument strenuously asserts that § 1299.35.5(B)(4) and (6)\n\fis constitutional because (1) the change from \"shall\" to \"may\" does not confer discretion on juvenile\n\ncourt judges to deny a minor an abortion if the minor is mature and well-informed or if the abortion\n\nis in the minor's best interest; and (2) subsections(B)(4) and (6) are procedural in nature and\n\ntherefore do not contradict the substantive federal law in this area. Neither of these arguments is\n\npersuasive.\n\n        We reject the State's co ntention that the change from \"shall\" to \"may\" does not confer\n\ndiscretion on juvenile court judges. We note by way of illustration that with one partial exception,9\n\nLouisiana stands alone on this front: As far as we are aware, every state with a parental consent or\n\nnotification statute has used the mandatory \"shall\" language in their judicial bypass schemes.10 The\n\nState's argument that subsections (4) and (6) pass constitutional muster takes one of two forms.\n\nFirst, the word change does not on its face give juvenile courts the discretion to deny a minor an\n\nabortion if the minor shows that she is mature, well-informed, or that the abortion would be in her\n\nbest interest; or, alternatively, even though the statute on its face states that a juvenile court judge\n\n\n   9\n    North Dakota appears to be the only other state in which a bypass decisionmaker \"may\" order\nan abortion if the Bellotti II requirements are met. N.D. CENT.CODE § 14-02.1-03.1(5)(a),\n(b)(1)-(3) (1995). To be sure, unlike Louisiana, part of North Dakota's statutory scheme tracks\nBellotti II. For example, if a minor in North Dakota demonstrates that she is mature and well\ninformed, § 14-02.1-03.1(5)(a) provides that \"the court shall issue an order authorizing a\ncompetent physician to perform the abortion procedure on the minor.\" (Emphasis added.)\nHowever, if the minor fails to demonstrate she is mature and well informed, § 14-02.1-\n03.1(5)(b)(1), (3) provides that the court \"may\" order an abortion if the court determines that the\nabortion is nevertheless in the minor's best interests. On this point, the North Dakota statute is\nsimilar to La. R.S. 40:1299.35.5(B)(6).\n   10\n     See ALA.CODE § 26-21-4(f)(1), (2) (1996); ARIZ.REV.STAT.

The\n\nbasic guide for interpreting Louisiana statutes states in unmistakably clear terms that \"shall\" means\n\n\"mandatory\" and that \"may\" means \"permissive.\" Moreover, the common usage of the term\n\n\"permissive\" is \"[a]llowed; allowable; that which may be done[;][l]enient; tolerant.\" BLACK'S LAW\n\nDICTIONARY at 1140 (6th ed.1990); Sumrall, 665 So.2d at 800 (looking to Black's Law Dictionary\n\nfor common and approved usage).

This flies in the face of Bellotti II and its progeny.\n\n        Our reading of the statute does not produce absurd consequences.

In other words, we would have to hold that the change from \"shall\"\n\fto \"may\" has no bearing on the constitutionality of Act 1254 because Act 1254 does not materially\n\nchange the 1981 version of § 1299.35.5(B). We cannot accept the State's proposition that Act 1254\n\ndoes not change the law. First, we would in effect be interpreting the statute so that \"may\" means\n\n\"shall,\" an interpretation that would be flatly inconsistent with the definition of those terms in La. R.S.\n\n1:3. Second, we would be ignoring the Louisiana Supreme Court's understanding of statutory\n\nchanges. The court has said: \"The legislature is presumed to have enacted a statute in light of the\n\npreceding statutes involving the same subject matter and court decisions construing those statutes,\n\nand where the new statute is worded differently from the preceding statute, the legislature is\n\npresumed to have intended to change the law.\" New Orleans Rosenbush Claims Serv., Inc. v.

Nothing the State has said in their\n\nbriefs or at oral argument persuades us that Act 1254 does not materially change the judicial bypass\n\nprocedure in Louisiana.\n\n        Perhaps the most basic flaw in the State's arguments is the assumption that we must go\n\nbeyond the plain meaning of § 1299.35.5(B)(4) and (6). We decline to do so because, as we have\n\nsaid, the language of subsections (4) and (6) is clear, unambiguous, and does not produce absurd\n\nconsequences. The State points us to no authority, and we perceive none, suggesting that procedural\n\nstatutes are immune from Article 9's clear mandate. In addition, the State fails to provide any\n\nauthority, and again we perceive none, for the proposition that Falgout is an exception to Article 9's\n\nstatutory construction principle.\n\n        Finally, the State argues that if we interpret § 1299.5.5(B)(4) and (6) to mean that juvenile\n\ncourt judges have the discretion to deny an abortion to a minor that meets the Bellotti II\n\nrequirements, we would be indulging the inappropriate assumption that Louisiana judges will decline\n\nto follow the federal Constitution.

The procedural rule challenged by the plaintiffs, although it was worded differently\n\nthan the language in Bellotti II, did not on its face conflict with the statute. Id. at 1341 (\"[T]he rule\n\nrequires a minor to plead that notifying her parents of the abortion is not in her best interest.\").\n\nAccordingly, we rejected the challenge to the Mississippi Supreme Court's procedural rule on the\n\nground that \"[i]f a Mississippi court does follow [the procedural rule] so as to conflict with Bellotti,\n\na plaintiff will be free to launch an as-applied challenge to the bypass procedure.\" Id. at 1342.\n\n        Here, we face an entirely different situation. Juvenile court judges within Louisiana have a\n\nlegislatively prescribed choice whether to order an abortion for a minor who is mature, well-informed,\n\nor for whom an abortion would be in her best interest. It is this discretion itself, and not the exercise\n\nof it, that we find inconsistent with Bellotti II.\n\n        In short, § 1299.35.5(B)(4) and (6) is unconstitutional. We affirm the district court's decision\n\nto permanently enjoin these provisions of Act 1254.\n\n2. Expeditiousness in § 1299.35.5(B)(3) and (4)\n\n         Section 1299.35.5(B)(3) provides that \"[e]ach application shall be heard in chambers,\n\nanonymously, in a summary manner, and within forty-eight hours of the filing thereof.\" Except for\n\nthe admonition that the hearing proceed in a \"summary manner,\" subsection (B)(3) on its face does\n\nnot pro vide a specific time frame for deciding the merits of a minor's application. Section\n\n1299.35.5(B)(4) provides that a juvenile court may require a minor to attend various state-sponsored\n\nevaluation and counseling sessions within forty-eight hours of the ex parte hearing with the juvenile\n\fcourt judge. Subsection (B)(4), like subsection (3), does not on its face provide a time frame within\n\nwhich that evaluation is to be completed and the results forwarded to the court. Nor does subsection\n\n(4) contain the \"summary manner\" language found in subsection (3).\n\n        The plaintiffs claim that § 1299.35.5(B)(3) and (4) violates the Bellotti II requirement that\n\nbypass procedures proceed expeditiously because both subsections provide an indefinite time period\n\nfor the juvenile court judge to decide the merits of the minor's application. The district court agreed\n\nwith the plaintiffs that subsections (B)(3) and (4) did not meet the Bellotti II requirement for\n\nexpeditious resolution of bypass applications. 905 F.Supp. at 365.11 On appeal, the State argues that\n\nthe district court erred in reaching this conclusion because the statute requires juvenile court judges\n\nto conduct the proceedings in a \"summary manner,\" and to hold that this provision violates Bellotti\n\nII, we \"would have to assume that a state district judge would intentionally ignore the requirements\n\nof state law and the dictates of the United States Supreme Court.\"\n\n        We agree with the district court that subsections (B)(3) and (4) are inconsistent with Bellotti\n\nII because they do not provide for an expeditious resolution of the minor's bypass application. We\n\nagain frame our analysis in accord with Louisiana's rules of statutory construction and determine\n\nwhether proceeding in a \"summary manner\" satisfies Bellotti II 's expedition requirement. Louisiana\n\nCivil Code article 2595 (West 1996) provides that in a summary proceeding, \"[t]he court shall render\n\nits decision as soon as practicable after the conclusion of the trial of a summary proceeding and,\n\nwhenever practicable, without taking the matter under advisement.\" (Emphasis added).\n\n        Such an open-ended bypass procedure has never been approved. We should not, as the\n\nSupreme Court has suggest ed, \"invalidate[ ] [a bypass] statute on a facial challenge based upon a\n\nworst-case analysis that may never occur.\" Akron II, 497 U.S. at 514, 110 S.Ct. at 2981. The\n\n\n   11\n     The district court stated that \"the provisions of Act 1254 amend Section B(4) of the Act to\nrequire that the juvenile court hear the bypass application within 48 hours, without any\nrequirement as to when the application must be ruled upon.\" 905 F.Supp. at 365 (emphasis\nadded). Our reading of the statute, however, reveals that subsection B(3) provides the forty-eight\nhour time frame and that the only change made by Act 1254 was to substitute the word\n\"confidentially\" with \"anonymously.\" Act 1254 did not for the first time introduce the forty-eight\nhour and \"summary manner\" requirements; both appeared in the 1981 version of § 1299.35.5(B).\n\fSupreme Court has held that a seventeen- and twenty-two-day delay satisfies Bellotti II. Akron II,\n\n497 U.S. at 514, 110 S.Ct. at 2980-81 (22 days); Ashcroft, 462 U.S. at 479 n. 4, 491 n. 16, 103\n\nS.Ct. at 2519 n. 4, 2525 n. 16 (17 days).

Like Louisiana's bypass procedure,\n\nNevada's statute did not on its face provide a time frame within which a minor's bypass application\n\nwas to be decided. Id. at 438. The Ninth Circuit struck down the statute as inconsistent with Bellotti\n\nII. \"Under the statute,\" reasoned the court, \"the district court could ... delay the bypass procedure\n\nindefinitely. The district court review procedure does not meet the Bellotti expediency criterion.\"\n\nId. at 440-41; see also id. at 441 n. 4 (stating that \"an indefinite period does not\" satisfy Bellotti II\n\n).\n\n          Subsections (B)(3) and (4) plainly conflict with Bellotti II because the juvenile court is not\n\nrequired to rule on the minor's application within any specified time nor are state counselors required\n\nto report back to the juvenile court within any specified time. We hold that \"whenever practicable\"\n\ndoes not satisfy constitutional standards of expediency. There is no fall-back (or constructive\n\nauthorization) provision within subsection (3) that deems a minor's application granted in the event\n\nthe juvenile court does not act within a particular time frame. Thus, not only do subsections (3) and\n\n(4) fail to provide any specific time within which a minor's application will be decided, but they give\n\nno assurances (assurances required by Bellotti II ) that the proceedings will conclude expeditiously.\n\n          The State attempts to rescue subsection (3) by pointing to Article 2591 (West 1961) of the\n\nLouisiana Civil Code, which provides: \"Summary proceedings are those which are conducted with\n\nrapidity, within the delays allowed by the court, and without citation and the observance of all the\n\nformalities required in ordinary proceedings.\" (Emphasis added). Plainly, the \"rapidity\" language\n\nrefers to the expeditiousness of the summary proceeding itself, not to the time a judge has to decide\n\n     12\n     The Supreme Court has disapproved the analysis in Glick, in which the Ninth Circuit held\nunconstitutional a bypass procedure which allowed a minor to have an abortion if parental\nnotification, and not the abortion itself, was not in the minor's best interest.

Nothing in Lambert\naffects Glick's holding regarding Bellotti II's expediency requirement.\n\fthe merits of a case. We inevitably return to article 2595 which does, as we have said, prescribe the\n\ntime frame within which a decision in a summary proceeding is to be rendered—\"as soon as\n\npracticable.\" This is insufficient under Bellotti II.\n\n        Finally, contrary to the State's contention, we do not portray Louisiana juvenile court judges\n\nor state-employed counselors as individuals who would intentionally violate Bellotti II, nor are we\n\nanalyzing the constitutionality of subsections (B)(3) and (4) under a worst-case scenario. We have\n\nsimply looked to the plain terms of § 1299.35.5(B)(3) and (4) to determine the rules juvenile court\n\njudges are required to follow when presented with a bypass application from a minor. The Louisiana\n\nLegislature has told them that they must rule on the application \"as soon as\" or \"whenever\n\npracticable.\" This violates Bellotti II 's expedition requirement on its face. We therefore affirm the\n\ndistrict court's decision to permanently enjoin subsections (3) and (4).\n\nB. The Constitutionality of La. R.S. 40:1299.35.5(B)(5)\n\n        Section 1299.35.5(B)(5) provides, among other things, that the juvenile court \"shall\" notify\n\nthe parent(s) or legal guardian if the court determines that such notification is in the minor's best\n\ninterest. The plaintiffs contend, and the district court agreed, that § 1299.35.5(B)(5) does not satisfy\n\nBellotti II 's anonymity requirement. The State, on the other hand, contends that § 1299.35.5(B)(5)\n\ncomports with Bellotti II. The State relies on the following language in Bellotti II for this conclusion:\n\n        [T]he court may deny the abortion request of an immature minor in the absence of parental\n        consultation if it concludes that her best interests would be served thereby, or the court may\n        in such a case defer decision until there is parental consultation in which the court may\n        participate.\n\nBellotti II, 443 U.S. at 648, 99 S.Ct. at 3050-51 (emphasis added). From this statement, the State\n\nargues that the Bellotti II Court \"seem[ed] to encourage [parental notification], if the courts believe\n\nto do so is in the minors [sic ] best interest.\" We agree with the district court and conclude that the\n\nState is mistaken.\n\n        As the plaintiffs and the district court correctly note, this language from Bellotti II in no way\n\npermits the independent bypass decisionmaker to contact a minor's parents, inform them that their\n\nminor daughter is seeking an abortion without their consent, and then ask the parents to participate\n\nin the process of deciding whether the abortion would be in the minor's best interest. We read the\n\fstatement from Bellotti II to mean that a Louisiana juvenile court can refuse to authorize a minor's\n\nabortion if parental notification is in the minor's best interest, or the court may wait until the minor\n\nherself seeks parental consultation, and then, with both the parents' and minor's input, determine\n\nwhether an abortion is in the minor's best interest.\n\n        Any other interpretation of this language—or shall we say, the State's interpretation—would\n\ncut the core out of Bellotti II. If Bellotti II means anything, it surely means that States seeking to\n\nregulate minors' access to abortion must offer a credible bypass procedure, independent of parents\n\nor legal guardians, in a parental consent statute like the one in Louisiana. Plainly, the State has\n\nattempted    to   enter   through    the   proverbial     back    door    by   suggesting     that   the\n\n\"best-interest-of-the-minor\" inquiry cannot arbitrarily exclude the input of parents or a legal guardian.\n\nAlthough the Supreme Court has recognized that bypass decisionmakers can consider whether\n\nparental notification would be in the best interest of the minor, Bellotti II, 443 U.S. at 640, 99 S.Ct.\n\nat 3046-47, and that complete anonymity is not required, Akron II, 497 U.S. at 513, 110 S.Ct. at\n\n2980, the Court has not held that anonymity may give way to parental notification in bypass statutes.\n\n        The Supreme Court's decision in H.L. v. Matheson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110432\"><a href=\"/opinion/110432/hl-v-matheson/\"><span class=\"volume\">450</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">398</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110432\"><a href=\"/opinion/110432/hl-v-matheson/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">388</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1981) is not to the contrary. There, the Court upheld a parental notification provision,\n\nreasoning that \"a statute setting out a \"mere requirement of parental notice' does not violate the\n\nconstitutional rights of an immature, dependent minor.\" Id. at 409, 101 S.Ct. at 1171. Because the\n\nCourt has yet to address the question of whether a bypass procedure is required for parental\n\nnotification statutes, we do not read Matheson to hold that parental notification is an exception to\n\nthe Bellotti II anonymity requirement. Indeed, if we were to agree with the State that Matheson\n\nmodified the anonymity requirement in Bellotti II, we would create an exception that swallows the\n\nrule. The central thrust of Bellotti II was to ensure that minors who could not or would not seek the\n\nconsent of a parent or legal guardian have access to a bypass procedure that would ensure anonymity\n\nfrom parents who may \"obstruct both an abortion and their access to court.\" Bellotti II, 443 U.S.\n\nat 647, 99 S.Ct. at 3050. By requiring a juvenile court judge to notify a minor's parents if the judge\n\nfinds that doing so would be in the minor's best interest, Louisiana has undermined the independent\n\fbypass procedure prescribed in Bellotti II.\n\n        We affirm the district court's conclusion that subsection (5) of § 1299.35.5(B) is inconsistent\n\nwith Bellotti II 's anonymity requirement.\n\n                                           CONCLUSION\n\n        We do not question Louisiana's interest in regulating the circumstances under which minors\n\nmay obtain abortions or its interest in ensuring that minors make an informed choice to have an\n\nabortion. The Supreme Court has stressed, as have we, the need to balance parents' strong interest\n\nin participating in a minor's upbringing against a minor's constitutional right to an abortion. Beginning\n\nwith Bellotti II, the Supreme Court has balanced these competing interests in a manner which\n\nmandates our decision today. Accordingly, if the Louisiana Legislature chooses to modify its judicial\n\nbypass procedure, it must do so consistent with the teachings of the Supreme Court and our\n\nConstitution. We hold that Act 1254 is facially unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause of the\n\nFourteenth Amendment of the Constitution.\n\n        The summary judgment of the district court permanently enjoining Act 1254 is AFFIRMED.\n\n        AFFIRMED.\n\n        EMILIO M.

Alternatively, some of these issues could have been dealt\n\nwith by the states—if no extant constitutional provision stood in conflict with these laws, the Court\n\nneed not have stretched the Fourteenth Amendment to create conflict. State legislatures could have\n\nchanged laws as public attitudes changed. See, e.g., Conn. Gen.Stat. § 53-32 (1969) (repealing\n\nConnecticut laws at issue in Griswold prohibiting use of contraceptives). It is a feature of a healthy\n\ndemocracy that evolving public norms find voice in new laws supported by the people.\n\n        Some of these judicial decisions, such as invalidating statutes that discriminate based on race,\n\nreflect our nation's highest aspirations as an individualist, pluralist society. Nonetheless, judicial\n\nofficers should not force the pace of change nor bind the nation to wise po licy using loose\n\ninterpretations of our written Constitution. Neither our aspirations about privacy, nor our concerns\n\nabout the consequences of leaving certain matters for states to decide, invests us with the authority\n\nto nullify state law.

It has also said that \"at the heart of liberty is the right to define\n\none's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.\"\n\nCasey, 505 U.S. at 851, 112 S.Ct. at 2807. As illustrated by the catalogue of substantive due process\n\nrights discussed earlier, the Fourteenth Amendment (thus interpreted) puts quite a bit of public policy\n\nwithin the \"heart\" of liberty. This is how the Supreme Court has dealt with the admittedly difficult\n\nissue of circumscribing which rights and liberties the Fourteenth Amendment comprises.\n\n        I do not believe that such open-ended inquiry can be helpful to judges interpreting the\n\nFourteenth Amendment. We must return to those principles embedded in the Constitution. First, as\n\nChief Justice Marshall said in Marbury v. Madison, \"it is emphatically the province and duty of the\n\njudicial department to say what the law is.\" 5 U.S. (Cranch) 137, 177, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"84759\"><a href=\"/opinion/84759/marbury-v-madison/\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">60</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1803).\n\nImportantly, \"to say what the law is\" presupposes that there is law to interpret. The Constitution\n\ndoes not charge courts with legislation, merely interpretation.\n\n        Second, the powers of legislatures are limited, but not by the inherent power of the courts.\n\nThey are circumscribed by a written constitution: \"The powers of the legislature are defined and\n\nlimited; and that those limits may not be mistaken and forgotten, the constitution is written.\" Id. 5\n\nU.S. at 176 (emphasis added). Indeed, the Framers specifically protected against the combination\n\nof legislative and judicial powers in one branch. \"The judges can exercise no executive prerogative,\n\nthough they are shoots from the executive stock; nor any legislative function, though they may be\n\nadvised by legislative councils.... \"Were the power of judging joined with the legislative, the life and\n\nliberty of the subject would be exposed to arbitrary control, for the judge would then be the\n\nlegislator.' \" The Federalist No. 47, at 303 (James Madison) (Clinton Rossiter ed., 1961) (quoting\n\nCharles Montesquieu, The Spirit of Laws, Vol. I, Book IX (1748)).\n\f        Third, the people, not the courts, established the Constitution;          it is a document of\n\nself-determination, not judicial determination. \"That the people have an original right to establish,\n\nfor their future government, such principles as, in their opinion, shall most conduce to their own\n\nhappiness, is the basis on which the whole American fabric has been erected.\" Marbury, 5 U.S. at\n\n176 (emphasis added). In the context of unenumerated constitutional rights, the Supreme Court has\n\nconstructed a new constitutional amendment out of the single word \"liberty.\" Instead of interpreting\n\nliberty in the context of the Constitution, the Court would have us interpret the Constitution in the\n\ncontext of its broad interpretation of liberty. Viewed expansively, this word can turn the entire\n\nConstitution on its head and nullify any restraints on the Court's authority, judicial self-restraint\n\nnotwithstanding, which the Constitution itself rejects.\n\n        Fourth and finally, the Constitution is a flexible and dynamic document, designed to have as\n\nmuch vitality today as it did the day it was written. \"This provision is made in a constitution, intended\n\nto endure for ages to come, and consequently, to be adapted to the various crises of human affairs.\"\n\nM'Culloch v. Maryland, 17 U.S. (Wheat.) 316, 415, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"85272\"><a href=\"/opinion/85272/mculloch-v-state-of-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">579</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1819). Al though historical\n\ncircumstances change, the principles that undergird the Constitution do not.\n\n        With these principles in mind, we should consider the proper way to interpret the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment, and accordingly, the proper scope of substantive due process. As a starting point, an\n\nunderstanding of what constitutional amendments were supposed to mean should guide any attempt\n\nto interpret them. The power to amend the Constitution is one of the greatest powers bestowed by\n\nthe Framers. The power to amend the Constitution gives the people the authority to constrain\n\nmajorities present and future. Because amendments are so powerful, the Constitution provides a\n\nrigorous proposal and ratification procedure for constitutional amendments in Article V, giving\n\nspecial constitutional ratifying authority to the pronouncements of three-fourths of the states. This\n\ngreat authority to bind future generations is seated in the American people. Because only the drafters\n\nand the states have the power to amend, their understanding of the words they choose should govern\n\nthe courts' interpretations where those words are ambiguous. Courts that stray beyond that meaning\n\nare acting beyond their authority. In Casey, however, the courts employed no textual analysis or\n\flegislative history, only judicial \"understandings.\" Casey, 505 U.S. at 846, 112 S.Ct. at 2804.\n\n       That is not to say that the Constitution or the Bill of Rights must be frozen in time. As\n\nMarshall said in M'Culloch, the Constitution is meant to endure, and its application must be flexible.\n\nNo one would dispute that the First Amendment protects television or the internet, or that the Fourth\n\nAmendment protects cellular phones, even though none of these technologies existed in the late\n\neighteenth century. The understanding of the drafters and ratifiers that Congress should not abridge\n\nthe freedom of the media must guide the courts' application of timeless principles to changed\n\ncircumstances. In this way, the understandings that undergird the Constitution and its amendments\n\ncontinue to have vitality in areas unforeseen at the drafting.\n\n       To say that these understandings are flexible, however, is emphatically not to say that changed\n\nvalues gain constitutional precedence to govern changed circumstances. That is a different\n\nproposition altogether. It is unwise to read t he Constitution by reference to a telephone poll, see\n\nCasey, 505 U.S. at 962, 112 S.Ct. at 2865 (Rehnquist, C.J., dissenting in part); even if it were\n\npossible, we have no authority to do so. Article V does not give amendment power to contemporary,\n\nmajority viewpoints. It explicitly sets forth a procedure to be followed for amendment.\n\n       To date, judicial attempts at understanding the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment have\n\nproven unsatisfactory. Although the Court has held that the Due Process Clause incorporates most\n\nof the Bill of Rights against the states, Duncan v. Louisiana, 391, U.S. 145, 147-48, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107685\"><a href=\"/opinion/107685/duncan-v-louisiana/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ullman (later adopted by the plurality in Casey), Justice Harlan\n\fprovided a different view of how to interpret the Fourteenth Amendment. Justice Harlan suggested\n\nthat we consult what \"history teaches are the traditions from which [liberty] developed as well as the\n\ntraditions from which it broke.\" Justice Harlan does not suggest that we look at the history of the\n\nFourteenth Amendment, but rather to American history and traditions generally to determine what\n\nliberties have been protected. At first blush, American history might seem t o be a good point of\n\nreference—a fixed, knowable tradition from which we might draw understanding. There are two\n\nmajor problems with this approach. First, the traditions from which liberty developed may suggest\n\na different role for government than was actually inscribed into the Fourteenth Amendment. Should\n\nthe liberty of freed slaves under the Fourteenth Amendment truly be defined by reference to American\n\nhistory leading up to the Civil War?\n\n       The second major difficulty of Justice Harlan's approach is that one can find whatever one\n\nseeks in history, if one is so determined. It is certainly true that Justice Harlan's look into the\n\nAmerican history will produce a richer record from which to draw conclusions. However, to canvas\n\nall of American history will likely produce conflicting traditions, allowing those who look to find\n\nwhatever answers they prefer. See Michael D., 491 U.S. at 137, 109 S.Ct. at 2349 (Brennan, J.,\n\ndissenting) (Tradition \"can be as malleable and as elusive as \"liberty' itself....\"); Moore v. East\n\nCleveland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109670\"><a href=\"/opinion/109670/moore-v-east-cleveland/\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">494</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 549, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109670\"><a href=\"/opinion/109670/moore-v-east-cleveland/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

How do we decide which history or tradition is relevant?\n\nThe task, however, is not to interpret American history, but to interpret the words of the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment. The federal judiciary is not composed of historians, merely lawyers whose expertise is\n\nneither \"history\" nor \"tradition.\" As used in Casey, concepts such as history and tradition have\n\nbecome ersatz constitutional provisions that courts substitute for the actual words.\n\n       Understanding the meaning of the word \"liberty\" in the context of the legislative history of\n\nthe Fourteenth Amendment avoids many of these judicial struggles to determine who gets to define\n\fhistory. Interpreting the Fourteenth Amendment by reference to the understanding of the drafters and\n\nratifiers is an approach more closely targeted to the task of interpreting a written constitution. In fact,\n\nthat is what the Supreme Court does in almost all other provisions of the Constitution.\n\n        I realize that sometimes legislative history is less clear than the Amendment or statute it is\n\nsupposed to illuminate, see, e.g., United States v.

Liberty for the drafters came in the context\n\nof dealing with restrictive racial laws in the South. In the floor debates surrounding the drafting of\n\nthe Fourteenth Amendment, the bill sponsor in the Senate, Senator Trumbull, suggested that the\n\nliberty interests involved were intended to deal with these statutes:\n\n        \"[S]tatutes of Mississippi ... provide that if any person of African descent residing in that\n        State travels from one county to the another without having a pass or a certificate of his\n        freedom, he is liable to be committed to jail and to be dealt with as a person who i s in the\n        State without authority. Other provisions of the statute prohibit any negro or mulatto from\n        having fire-arms; and one provision of the statute declares that for \"exercising the functions\n        of a minister of the Gospel free negroes ... on conviction, may be punished by ... lashes....'\n\f       [ ... ] The statutes of South Carolina make it a highly penal offense for any person, white or\n       colored, to teach slaves; and similar provisions are to be found running through all the\n       statutes of the late slaveholding States.... The purpose of the bill ... is to destroy all these\n       discriminations....\"\n\nAdamson, 332 U.S. at 99-100, 67 S.Ct. at 1700 (quoting Cong. Globe, 39th Cong. 1st Sess. 474\n\n(1865)). This does not suggest that the term \"liberty\" as used in the Fourteenth Amendment applies\n\nonly to race-conscious statutes, indeed the plain language of the Fourteenth Amendment admits a\n\nbroader interpretation. However, it does suggest a context in which to decide how to interpret the\n\nAmendment consistent with the drafters' intent, a context that was not intended to include abortion.\n\n       I recognize that the Supreme Court has not accepted this approach. Indeed, the Court has\n\nrecently held that such a fixed interpretive guideline is unhelpful in interpreting the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment. In Casey, the plurality stated that the Court should examine each case as it comes, ad\n\nhoc, to determine what substantive rights the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees, using \"reasoned\n\njudgment.\" Casey, 505 U.S. at 849, 112 S.Ct. at 2806. The power of Article III courts to invalidate\n\nstate laws under the Constitution is not so expansive—even the reasoned judgment of our wisest\n\njurists cannot replace the written constitution as authority.\n\n       Casey best illustrates the approach taken by the Supreme Court. Near the end of the plurality\n\nopinion, the Court says that \"[e]ach generation must learn anew that the Constitution's written terms\n\nembody ideas and aspirations that survive more ages than one.\" Casey, 505 U.S. at 901, 112 S.Ct.\n\nat 2833. This is in line with my earlier suggestion that old understandings apply to new situations and\n\nthat the Constitution is limited by its words. But that is not what the Casey court actually did in the\n\nopinion. In deciding whether the abortion regulations at stake fell within the ambit of the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment, the court cited Justice Harlan's dissent in Poe v. Ullman. Specifically the Court quoted\n\ntwo extensive passages of that opinion. First, the Court asserted that neither the Bill of Rights nor\n\nthe specific practices of states at the time of the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment marks the\n\nouter limits of substantive due process:\n\n       \"[T]he full scope of the liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause cannot be found in or\n       limited by the precise terms of the specific guarantees elsewhere provided in the Constitution.\n       This \"liberty' is not a series of isolated points pricked out in terms of the taking of property;\n       the freedom of speech, press, and religion; the right to keep and bear arms; the freedom from\n       unreasonable searches and seizures; and so on. It is a rational continuum which, broadly\n\f        speaking, includes a freedom from all substantial arbitrary impositions and purposeless\n        restraints, ... and which also recognizes, what a reasonable and sensitive judgment must, that\n        certain interests require particularly careful scrutiny of the state needs asserted to justify their\n        abridgement.\"\n\nCasey, 505 U.S. at 848-49, 112 S.Ct. at 2805 (quoting Poe, 367 U.S. at 543, 81 S.Ct. at 1777\n\n(Harlan, J., dissenting on jurisdictional grounds)). The Casey Court continued, quoting from Poe,\n\nthat the adjudication of substantive due process claims has traditionally been, and will continue to be,\n\na matter of \"reasoned judgment\":\n\n        \"Due process has not been reduced to any formula; its content cannot be determined by\n        reference to any code. The best that can be said is that through the course of this Court's\n        decisions it has represented the balance which our Nation, built upon postulates of respect for\n        the liberty of the individual, has struck between that liberty and the demands of organized\n        society. If the supplying of content to this Constitutional concept has of necessity been a\n        rational process, it certainly has not been one where judges have felt free to roam where\n        unguided speculation might take them. The balance of which I speak is the balance struck by\n        this country, having regard to what history teaches are the traditions from which it developed\n        as well as the traditions from which it broke. That tradition is a living thing. A decision of\n        this Court which radically departs from it could not long survive, while a decision which\n        builds on what has survived is likely to be sound. No formula could serve as a substitute, in\n        this area, for judgment and restraint.\"\n\nCasey, 505 U.S. at 849-50, 112 S.Ct. at 2806, (quoting Poe, 367 U.S. at 542, 81 S.Ct. at 1776\n\n(Harlan, J., dissenting on jurisdictional grounds)). The two block quotes selected by the Court from\n\nPoe are perhaps more telling for what they omitted, however. For between these two long, lofty (and\n\ntransposed) quotes in Poe, lie two telling sentences. After the above-quoted sentence, \"No formula\n\ncould serve as a substitute, in this area, for judgment and restraint[,]\" Justice Harlan continued:\n\n        It is this outlook which has led the Court continuingly to perceive distinctions in the\n        imperative character of Constitutional provisions, since that character must be discerned from\n        a particular provision's larger context. And inasmuch as this context is not one of words, but\n        of history and purposes, the full scope of the liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause\n        cannot be found in or limited by the precise terms of the specific guarantees elsewhere\n        provided in the Constitution.\n\nPoe, 367 U.S. at 543, 81 S.Ct. at 1777 (Harlan, J., dissenting on jurisdictional grounds) (emphasis\n\nadded). This omitted quote highlights Justice Harlan's approach, employed by the Casey Court, of\n\nusing history and tradition in general, not the written Consti tution, to delimit the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment. See also Griswold, 381 U.S. at 501, 85 S.Ct. at 1691 (Harlan, J., concurring) (rejecting\n\nJustice Douglas's restriction of substantive due process to the Bill of Rights and suggesting that\n\njudicial restraint may be achieved in the Fourteenth Amendment context \"only by continual insistence\n\fupon respect for the teachings of history, solid reco gnition of the basic values that underlie our\n\nsociety, and wise appreciation of the great roles that the doctrines of federalism and separation of\n\npowers have played in establishing and preserving American freedoms.\").\n\n        The Court is no longer interpreting the words of the Constitution; after Casey it is\n\ninterpreting history. Words such as \"rational continuum,\" \"substantial arbitrary impositions,\"\n\n\"purposeless restraints,\" and \"balance ... which our Nation has struck\" are code words intended to\n\nevoke emotional and rhetorical fealty, yet they have no meaning independent of that given them by\n\nfive Justices. The people's Constitution—at least as to unenumerated constitutional rights—has\n\nbecome the Court's Constitution. Those principles most conducive to the people's happiness now\n\ncome not from the people, but from Platonic guardians. Justice Black has been proven right, arguing\n\nin his dissent in Griswold against such an ambitious use of the Due Process Clause: \"For myself it\n\nwould be most irksome to be ruled by a bevy of Platonic Guardians, even if I knew how to choose\n\nthem, which I assuredly do not.\" Griswold, 381 U.S. at 526-27, 85 S.Ct. at 1705 (Black, J.,\n\ndissenting) (quoting Learned Hand, The Bill of Rights 70 (1958)).\n\n        As the Supreme Court said in Bowers v. Hardwick, \"The Court is most vulnerable and comes\n\nnearest to illegitimacy when it deals with judge-made constitutional law having little or no cognizable\n\nroots in the language or design of the Constitution.\" </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111738\"><a href=\"/opinion/111738/bowers-v-hardwick/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">186</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 194, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111738\"><a href=\"/opinion/111738/bowers-v-hardwick/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Interestingly, the Court does not even conduct such a historical review in Casey\n\nto bolster Roe 's \"doct rinal footing,\" nor does it accept or refer to the history cited in Roe as\n\ncompelling. See Casey, 505 U.S. at 849-50, 112 S.Ct. at 2806.\n\n                                                   B\n\n        In part because of the Supreme Court's ambiguity about the scope of substantive due process,\n\nit is unclear to me that the Court itself still believes that abortion is a \"fundamental right\" under the\n\nFourteenth Amendment. In the narrow context of this concurrence, I will not canvas the Supreme\n\nCourt's entire line of abortion cases. For the purposes of this opinion, it is necessary only to point\n\nout that the Court's more recent decisions indicate tepid support for Roe v. Wade. If Roe is no longer\n\nthe best interpretation of the Constitution, then our authority to strike the Louisiana statute is very\n\ftenuous.\n\n        In Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the Court in a fractured joint opinion upheld Roe 's \"central\n\nholding,\" but did not defend Roe as a sound reading of the Constitution. 505 U.S. at 860-61, 112\n\nS.Ct. at 2812. Instead, it upheld Roe out of concerns for the abstract, nonconstitutional value of\n\nstare decisis, for the institutional credibility of the Court, and because of the primacy of settled\n\nexpectations about constitutional law. Id. (\"Within the bounds of normal stare decisis analysis, then,\n\nand subject to the considerations on which it customarily turns, the stronger argument is for affirming\n\nRoe 's central holding, with whatever degree of personal reluctance any of us may have....\").\n\n        The joint opinion in Casey was correct to consider the force of precedent and the value of\n\nsettled expectations. However, I think that the Court would have been mo re in line with the\n\nConstitution had it given effect to its conclusion that Roe is wrong. Where the Constitution is the\n\nsource of a court's power, it must interpret the Constitution first and consider institutional credibility\n\nsecond. Where, for example, the Court finds that it does not have the constitutional authority to\n\nstrike a state law, its own prior opinions (especially erroneous ones) do not grant that authority, stare\n\ndecisis notwithstanding.\n\n        The Casey Court asserted that it should not overrule cases, especially cases such as Roe,\n\nlightly. It explained: \"a decision to overrule should rest on some special reason over and above the\n\nbelief that a prior case was wrongly decided.\" Casey, 505 U.S. at 864, 112 S.Ct. at 2813, (citing\n\nMitchell v.

In Bellotti II, the Supreme Court addressed the\n\nconstitutionality of a Massachusetts statute restricting minors' access to abortion. The Bellotti II\n\nCourt held that minors have the same abortion rights as women who have reached the age of\n\nmajority, and that the Massachusetts's parental consent law unduly burdened minors' exercise of that\n\nright. Bellotti II, 443 U.S. at 647, 99 S.Ct. at 3050. But the Court did not stop there. It continued,\n\nstating that the Court's interpretation of the word \"liberty\" in the Fourteenth Amendment required\n\nthat, when states seek to regulate minors' access to abortions,\n\n        every minor must have the opportunity—if she so desires—to go directly to a court without\n        first consulting or notifying her parents. If she satisfies the court that she is mature and well\n        enough informed to make intelligently the abortion decision on her own, the court must\n        authorize her to act without parental consultation or consent. If she fails to satisfy the court\n        that she is competent to make this decision independently, she must be permitted to show that\n        an abortion nevertheless would be in her best interests. If the court is persuaded that it is, the\n        court must authorize the abortion.\n\nId. at 647-48, 99 S.Ct. at 3050. The Court thus decided that a minor seeking an abortion without\n\nparental consent must be afforded a prompt hearing in court; must be allowed to have an abortion\n\nif the court decides she is mature enough to make the decision herself; and must be allowed to\n\nproceed if the court determines an abortion is in her best interests. Id. Regardless of whether that is\n\ngood policy, I am not confident that there is a principled way to reach that conclusion from the word\n\n\"liberty\" in the Fourteenth Amendment. By promulgating specific, minimum requirements for state\n\nparental consent statutes despite a complete vacuum of Constitutional authority, the Court's opinion\n\nin Bellotti II has the distinct flavor of judicial legislation.\n\n        Bellotti II addresses policy concerns with parental consent statutes, elevates those concerns\n\nto constitutional heights, then declares Massachusetts's nonconforming po licy decisions to be\n\nunconstitutional. This line of reasoning amounts to little more than a tautology. By positing a\n\ffundamental right to abortion and by classifying regulations that jurists deem unwise as an \"undue\n\nburden\" on that right, federal judges risk constitutionalizing their policy preferences regarding any\n\nof the catalogue of substantive Fourteenth Amendment rights.\n\n        As one might expect, such backward induction yields conflicting and seemingly arbitrary\n\nresults. For example, we are instructed in Bellotti II that parental consent requirements are\n\nunconstitutional, 443 U.S. at 649-50, 99 S.Ct. at 3051, yet in Casey we are told that the Constitution\n\ndoes not invalidate informed consent requirements, 505 U.S. at 887, 112 S.Ct. at 2826.

But in any event they are not driven by the Constitution.\n\n        As illustrated by Bellotti II, the due process clause has become a blank check, redeemable for\n\nwhatever rights the courts fashion. This is no rule of law, and it is certainly not constitutionalism.\n\nThe Supreme Court's abortion jurisprudence assures us that our panel has authority under the\n\nConstitution to strike portions of Louisiana's parental consent statute. But because this jurisprudence\n\nno longer derives its force from the written Constitution, I hesitate to invoke Bellotti II to strike this\n\nlaw.\n\n                                                   III\n\n        Aside from serious concerns about substantive due process, I have a pragmatic objection to\n\ncourts substituting their judgments about this type of policy question for the decisions of legislatures.\n\nAs I have asserted before, I think that the modern abortion cases are less about policy than about\n\npower.

Edwards, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"590038\"><a href=\"/opinion/590038/sojourner-t-on-behalf-of-herself-and-all-others-similarly-situated-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">974</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 31 (Garza, J., concurring specially) (quoting Casey,\n\n505 U.S. at 981, 112 S.Ct. at 2874 (Scalia, J., dissenting in part)). The last two sections have\n\noutlined my belief that the Constitution has vested the power to decide these hotly contested,\n\nnonconstitutional issues in the state legislatures. See U.S. Const. amend. IX and X. In addition to\n\fmy beliefs about the constitutional authority of Article III courts, I also think that these issues are\n\nbetter decided over time by democratic, political institutions. See generally Cass R. Sunstein,\n\nForeword: Leaving Things Undecided, 110 Harv. L.Rev. 4 (1996) (arguing for narrow judicial\n\ndecisions in cases involving constitutional and moral uncertainty).\n\n       The Supreme Court's abortion jurisprudence epitomizes a trend toward centralizing and\n\nconstitutionalizing the most controversial issues of public policy. I believe that expanding the\n\njurisdiction and power of the courts in order to speed the pace of change is unjustified. Where the\n\nConstitution does not dictate otherwise, the proper mode of political reform is through enlightened\n\ndebate, political experimentation, and change. We are a pluralistic nation with strong individualist\n\nideals. One large component of American civic virtue is public debate over issues. To be sure, this\n\nrequires patience, because self-determination is not a guarantee of correctness the first time or every\n\ntime. State legislatures will occasionally pass \"silly\" laws. See, e.g., Griswold, 381 U.S. at 527, 85\n\nS.Ct. at 1705 (Stewart, J., dissenting). Some states may be slower than others in coming to what may\n\neventually be a national consensus on an issue. But the ideal is that, through public discourse and\n\nexperimentation, states will reconsider anachronistic laws, adapt, change, and find the public policies\n\nthat work best. Where these issues are not constitutional, it demeans the ideal of democracy for the\n\ncourts to decide these issues for the people, especially under a strained interpretation of the\n\nConstitution.\n\n       Some have justified an ambitious judicial role in abortion cases by suggesting that the\n\nSupreme Court has a special calling to unite the nation in high-stakes cases in which people\n\npassionately disagree. In Casey, the Court stated that such cases carry a special \"dimension\" that\n\nplaces those opinions in a class by themselves:\n\n       Where, in the performance of its judicial duties, the Court decides a case in such a way as to\n       resolve the sort of intensely divisive controversy reflected in Roe and those rare, comparable\n       cases, its decision has a dimension that the resolution of the normal case does not carry. It\n       is the dimension present whenever the Court's interpretation of the Constitution calls the\n       contending sides of a nat ional controversy to end their national division by accepting a\n       common mandate rooted in the Constitution.\n\nCasey, 505 U.S. at 866-67, 112 S.Ct. at 2815. The Court suggested that the two cases exemplifying\n\nthis call to a common mandate were Roe v. Wade and Brown v. Board of Education. But as Justice\n\fScalia pointed out in his Casey dissent, Roe did not settle the political issue of legalized abortion. No\n\none accepted a common mandate in that case. In retrospect, it is clear that the Suprem e Court's\n\nintervention in the debate clouded the issues, inflaming those who believe that there is no\n\nconstitutional right to abortion and forcing advocates of legalized abortion to defend abortion \"rights\"\n\nunder Roe. Today we see that even many of those who believe that abortion should be legal do not\n\nsupport Roe v. Wade as faithful interpretation of the Constitution. See Casey, 505 U.S. at 860-61,\n\n112 S.Ct. at 2812 (joint opinion reluctantly upholding Roe on stare decisis grounds); see also Ruth\n\nBader Ginsburg, Some Thoughts on Autonomy and Equality in Relation to Roe v. Wade, 63 N.C.\n\nL.Rev. 375, 385-86 (1985) (criticizing the \"[h]eavy handed judicial intervention\" of the Roe court and\n\nsuggesting an alternative starting point for analysis in abortion cases).\n\n        Roe did not mark the end of t he debate or the acceptance of a common mandate, but the\n\nbeginning of a bitter national exegesis.

Plessy, like Roe, represented an attempt to read into the\n\nConstitution one view of history and social policy neither explicit nor fairly implied from the\n\nConstitutional text. \"Separate but equal\" may have been an attempt to solve a contentious issue of\n\nthe 1890s, but it was not constitutional interpretation. Plessy did not unite the nation behind the idea\n\nthat segregation was consistent with the Civil War Amendments. As in its abortion cases, the Court\n\noccasionally upheld the \"central holding\" of Plessy on stare decisis grounds, before finally overruling\n\nit in Brown I, 347 U.S. at 494-95, 74 S.Ct. at 691-92. I suggest this comparison not necessarily to\n\ndraw any moral parallel between slavery and abortion, but rather to point out that the Court's\n\ninsertion of itself as the final arbiter of the abortion debate is unlikely to prove more successful than\n\nits attempt in Plessy.\n\n        Plessy is not the only time our nation has faced a conflict between faithful interpretation and\n\nstare decisis.

The Court held that such governmental intrusion on private property rights,\n\nregardless of procedural safeguards, \"could hardly be dignified with the name of due process of law.\"\n\nId. This was the first time since Marbury v. Madison that the Court used the power of judicial review,\n\nand the first time ever t hat the Court invalidated a statute under judicial review. That a notion as\n\ncontroversial as substantive due process sprang from such a cataclysmic opinion is revealing.\n\n       Dred Scott was fashioned as an opinion to put an end to a bitter dispute in America. It took\n\none of the most contentious and personal of political issues out of the national debate. But instead\n\nof resolving controversies, Dred Scott tore the nation apart. Although Roe and its progeny have not\n\nresulted in a civil war, the peace over abortion since 1973 has been anything but civil. The last twenty\n\nyears have seen political protest over the Court's abortion jurisprudence unmatched by any other\n\npolitical issue of our day. Protest marches, clinic bombings, and fatal shootings have punctuated the\n\ndebate. Putting the lid on this pot has caused it to boil over. Regular debate, lobbying, and\n\nlegislation at the state level, as contemplated by the Constitution, may diffuse political pressure,\n\nrelieve tensions, and provide for nuanced answers to hard questions about abortion. Removing such\n\nissues from the people prevents their vetting at the local level and requires the political pressure to\n\nbe released outside the bounds of civil debate.\n\f        In Dred Scott, Plessy, and Lochner, the Court made things worse by inserting itself into, and\n\npreempting, the national debate. Although at one time these cases were also defensible on stare\n\ndecisis grounds, they are not celebrated cases in our history. By contrast, the cases in which the\n\nCourt overruled such precedents, such as Brown I and West Coast Hotel, are celebrated as\n\nconstitutional moments. It is of course easier to discern between the two types of cases in retrospect.\n\nI think that enough history has passed for us confidently to conclude that Roe belongs in the former\n\ncategory, cases in which the Court intervened to settle a national debate by way of expansive\n\nconstitutional interpretation. It remains for our Supreme Court to write the analog to West Coast\n\nHotel extricating itself from the substantive due process morass of abortion cases and returning the\n\ndebate to the people.\n\n        Deliberation about this subject, although heated, is healthy. As a nation, we have not reached\n\na consensus about when life begins; we have not finally determined the proper interplay between a\n\nmother's liberty, the interests of an unborn child, and the state's interests in protecting life. At an\n\nontological level, we the people have yet to decide whether person defines life or life defines person.\n\nAs technology allows fetal independence at an earlier and earlier age, our understanding of these\n\nquestions will not remain static. The Constitution, in all its prescience, does not answer these\n\nquestions. Such ontic questions are quintessentially the right of the people to decide. In abortion\n\ncases, law presupposes a theory of ethics and morality, which in turn presupposes deeply personal\n\nideas about being and existence. Our answers to such questions as when life begins define our ethical\n\nbeliefs, and these ethical beliefs should determine how we govern ourselves. It is a serious mistake\n\nto try to reverse this order, to make our law determine how we decide these fundamental, personal,\n\nontic issues. Abortion in this context is less a question about constitutional law, and more about who\n\nwe are as a people. I submit that this is a decision the Supreme Court cannot make. Liberty is not\n\ncoextensive with license; it therefore must have limits. Those limits may be imposed only by the\n\npeople, either in their Constitution or through their laws, not legislated by the courts. Taking these\n\nissues out of the public discourse threatens to foment hostility, stifle the search for answers, distance\n\npeople from their Constitution, and undermine the credibility of that document.\n\f                                                    IV\n\n         Bellotti II represents a type of legislating that is better left to Congress or the states. In many\n\ncases, the courts must fill in gaps in statutes, account for unforeseen circumstances, or decide difficult\n\nissues that legislators avoid. However, in this instance, Louisiana actually did exercise its legislative\n\npowers; it debated and struggled and made tough choices. Now we are nullifying Louisiana's choice,\n\nnot under the Constitution, but under Roe 's continuing authority based on stare decisis.\n\n         Therefore it is not impertinence that makes me question the Supreme Court's abortion\n\njurisprudence, but institutional modesty.        I am uncomfortable invoking the authority of the\n\nConstitution to invalidate this statute, especially under such an ambiguous mandate from the\n\nConstitution. Although the Court said in Bellotti II that Roe and the Fourteenth Amendment set\n\nminimum standards for parental consent statutes, it is unclear that the post-Casey Supreme Court still\n\nbelieves that the Constitution demands this outcome. Overturning Louisiana's legislature on such thin\n\nauthority runs dangerously close to anticonstitutional hubris. As Abraham Lincoln said of Dred\n\nScott:\n\n         The candid citizen must confess that if the policy of the government, upon vital questions\n         affecting the whole people, is to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court, the\n         instant they are made, in ordinary litigation between parties in personal actions, the people\n         will have ceased to be their own rulers, having, to that extent, practically resigned the\n         government into the hands of that eminent tribunal.\n\nAbraham Lincoln, First Inaugural Address—Final Text (Mar. 4, 1861), in 4 The Collected Works\n\nof Abraham Lincoln 262, 268 (Roy P. Basler ed., 1953) (cited in Casey, 505 U.S. at 996, 112 S.Ct.\n\nat 2882 (Scalia, J., dissenting in part)).\n\f</pre>",
