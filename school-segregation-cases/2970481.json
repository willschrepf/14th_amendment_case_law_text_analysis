Appellants Peterson Group, Inc., PGI Development, L.P.,\n\nand Wellington Yu sued appellees PLTQ Lotus Group, L.P. and Cubo Group,\n\fL.L.C. (collectively, “PLTQ”) for money due under a purchase agreement and a\n\nreal estate development agreement.          PLTQ countersued for breach of the\n\ndevelopment agreement and fraud in connection with the real estate development\n\nproject. PLTQ also argued that Peterson Group and Yu were alter egos of PGI.\n\n      The jury found for PLTQ against Peterson Group and Yu on the fraud claim.\n\nThe jury also found for PLTQ against PGI on the breach of contract claim. After\n\nthe verdict, the court found as a matter of law that Peterson Group and Yu were\n\nalter egos of PGI. As to the fraud cause of action, the court awarded damages\n\nfound by the jury, plus pre- and post-judgment interest, in favor of PLTQ and\n\nagainst Peterson Group and Yu. As to the contract claim, the court awarded\n\ndamages found by the jury, plus pre- and post-judgment interest and attorney’s\n\nfees, in favor of PLTQ and against PGI, Peterson Group, and Yu. Thus Peterson\n\nGroup and Yu were held jointly liable as alter egos for PGI’s breach of contract\n\nand for the attorney’s fees awarded based on that cause of action.\n\n      In the first two issues, the appellants challenge the trial court’s ruling that\n\nPeterson Group and Yu were alter egos of PGI and the trial court’s award of\n\nattorney’s fees against Peterson Group and Yu. In their third and fourth issues,\n\nappellants argue that PLTQ’s fraud claim was barred by the economic loss rule and\n\nthat, in the alternative, PLTQ was required to elect a remedy between fraud and\n\nbreach of contract. In their fifth issue, appellants contend that the trial court should\n\n                                           2\n\fhave granted their motion for judgment n.o.v. as to breach-of-contract damages for\n\nlost tenant rent because such damages were too speculative to have been awarded.\n\n      We conclude that the trial court erred by finding Peterson Group and Yu to\n\nbe alter egos of PGI. We further conclude that PLTQ’s fraud claim was not barred\n\nby the economic loss rule nor was PLTQ required to elect a remedy between fraud\n\nand breach of contract. Finally, we conclude that the damages awarded for lost\n\ntenant rent were not speculative.\n\n      We reverse the trial court’s judgment insofar as it awarded damages for\n\nbreach of contract against Peterson Group and Yu, including attorney’s fees, and\n\nwe affirm in all other respects.\n\n                                    Background\n\n      In the spring of 2003, Dr. Loi Nguyen, a practicing cardiologist, formed\n\nPLTQ Lotus Group, L.P. for the purpose of investing in and developing real estate.\n\nCubo Group, LLC is the general partner of PLTQ Lotus Group, and Dr. Nguyen is\n\nthe president of Cubo Group. Dr. Nguyen purchased land in Houston with the\n\nintention of building a medical center where his office would be located. He\n\npurchased the land with a loan from First Bank.          Jackie Nguyen, who is\n\nDr. Nguyen’s former wife and a real estate agent, introduced Dr. Nguyen to\n\nWellington Yu. Yu is a real estate developer, primarily developing shopping\n\n\n\n\n                                        3\n\fcenters in the Houston suburbs. Yu conducts his real-estate development work\n\nprimarily through his company, Peterson Group, Inc.\n\n      Yu persuaded Dr. Nguyen to purchase two additional acres adjoining the\n\nland he had purchased for the medical center and to develop the land instead as a\n\nshopping center. Yu arranged a construction loan from Metro Bank, which was\n\nused to satisfy the loan from First Bank and to fund the purchase of the additional\n\ntwo acres. The construction loan was also to cover the cost of developing the\n\nproperty into a shopping center, which they called the Royal Oaks Shopping\n\nCenter. Yu formed a limited partnership, PGI Development Group, L.P., for the\n\npurpose of developing the Royal Oaks Shopping Center. Peterson I Realty GP,\n\nInc. is the general partner of PGI. Yu is a limited partner of PGI, the president of\n\nPeterson I Realty GP, Inc., and the president of Peterson Group.\n\n      Shortly after the two additional acres were purchased for the Royal Oaks\n\nproject, Yu showed Dr. Nguyen some land that he was developing as a strip center\n\nnear Stonegate Commons, a residential development on the northwest side of\n\nHouston. Yu owned two acres of land there that he intended to develop, and he\n\nhad a contract to purchase an additional eight acres adjacent to the land. He\n\npersuaded Dr. Nguyen to buy six of those acres, and in August 2003, Dr. Nguyen\n\nsigned a purchase agreement, “the Stonegate contract.” Yu and Peterson Group\n\nwould later contend that Dr. Nguyen owed them $730,000 on this transaction.\n\n                                         4\n\f      By November 2003, Yu and Dr. Nguyen were proceeding with the Royal\n\nOaks Shopping Center project. On November 13, 2003, Peterson Group and\n\nPLTQ Lotus Group entered into a development agreement for Royal Oaks. This\n\none-page agreement established that Peterson Group, as the developer, would be\n\nresponsible to: (1) negotiate the purchase of the land; (2) design and engineer the\n\nfacility, including obtaining construction permits; (3) lease the shopping center;\n\n(4) construct the shopping center; (5) assist in obtaining bank financing;\n\n(6) perform accounting on the cost of the project; and (7) oversee tenant move-in\n\nand construction. PLTQ Lotus Group agreed to pay Peterson Group a developer\n\nfee of $650,000 in five installments. This contract was signed by Dr. Nguyen on a\n\nsignature line that identified him as “President” of PLTQ Lotus Group and by Yu\n\non a line that identified him as president of Peterson Group.\n\n      The next day, Yu and Dr. Nguyen signed a second development agreement\n\nfor the Royal Oaks project.     This contract was between PLTQ Lotus Group,\n\nidentified as “the ‘Client,’” and PGI, identified as “the ‘Developer.’” This five-\n\npage contract provided more detail on the duties of the developer, specifically\n\nstating that the developer would submit requests to the bank to receive funds from\n\nthe construction loan. This contract was executed on behalf of PLTQ Lotus Group\n\nby Dr. Nguyen, identified in the signature block as president of Cubo Group (the\n\ngeneral partner of PLTQ Lotus Group), and on behalf of PGI by Peterson I Realty\n\n                                          5\n\fGP, Inc. (the general partner of PGI). Yu signed for Peterson I Realty GP, Inc.,\n\nidentified as that entity’s president.\n\n      Yu began developing the Royal Oaks Shopping Center. By the summer of\n\n2004, he had become frustrated with both Dr. Nguyen’s unavailability and the\n\nRoyal Oaks project itself, which Yu felt was occupying too much of his time at the\n\nexpense of his own development projects.          In June 2004, the PLTQ-PGI\n\ndevelopment agreement was amended. The developer fee was increased to the\n\nlesser of $770,000 or 11% of the total project cost. The amendment also provided\n\nthat PLTQ would add Yu as an authorized signatory for the project’s account at\n\nMetro Bank, and it authorized Yu to pay reasonable and necessary development\n\ncosts from the account “including, without limitation, the Development Fee.” At\n\ntrial, Yu testified that he did not know why that provision was in the contract, and\n\nthat he never took advantage of it.\n\n      In July 2004, PLTQ entered into a contract with Atlantic Builder Company\n\nand an architect, Consolidated Architectural and Planning Service (“CAPS”), for\n\nconstruction of the shopping center. D. W. Tan is an architect, the president of\n\nCAPS, and the vice-president of Atlantic Builder. Tan submitted draw requests\n\ndirectly to Metro Bank to obtain money from Dr. Nguyen’s construction loan.\n\nWhen he received money from the bank, he would deliver it to Yu or his\n\nrepresentative, and Yu would give him checks for his fee and to pay the\n\n                                         6\n\fsubcontractors. Tan testified that it was his and Yu’s practice to inflate the amount\n\nof the draw requests above the actual construction costs. According to Tan, the\n\ntotal amount of money withdrawn from the construction loan was approximately\n\n$900,000 in excess of actual construction costs. Tan testified that at one point, Yu\n\nasked him to prepare a false change order to submit to the bank in order to obtain\n\nan additional $400,000 in financing. Although Tan knew the change order was\n\nfalse, he “reluctantly” prepared it anyway. Tan had no contact with Dr. Nguyen\n\nduring design and construction of the shopping center. After construction was\n\nfinished, Dr. Nguyen inquired about the use of the construction loan. Tan showed\n\nhim the accounting information he had and explained that he had submitted draws\n\nto the bank, within the amount of the bank loan, which exceeded the actual\n\nconstruction costs.\n\n      Though Dr. Nguyen would later contend that he was surprised by the\n\naccounting practices employed on this project, Yu testified that Dr. Nguyen wanted\n\nhim to take the development fee from the construction loan because he felt the\n\ndevelopment fee was part of the total cost of construction.        Dr. Nguyen also\n\ntestified that he wanted the developer’s fee included in the construction loan, but,\n\nafter signing the loan paperwork, he learned that Metro Bank would not permit\n\nthat. Because the bank did not want to include the developer’s fee in the cost of\n\nthe loan, Yu marked up the cost of construction to take the fee out of the bank loan\n\n                                         7\n\fanyway. But Yu also solicited and received payments directly from Dr. Nguyen\n\nduring the same time period.\n\n      On March 30, 2005, Yu sent Dr. Nguyen a letter on PGI letterhead\n\ninforming him of a $633,965 shortfall in funds to satisfy the construction costs. In\n\nthe letter, Yu reminded Dr. Nguyen of his financial obligations regarding the\n\nproject, stating, “An enormous amount of time and money has been spent to date in\n\nhopes of making this project a success, and you have made commitments to\n\nprospective tenants and contractors (including PGI Development Group) under\n\nvarious project-related leases and other contracts.” Dr. Nguyen wrote a note on the\n\nbottom of the letter agreeing to contribute an additional $600,000, in three\n\ninstallments: April 2005, midway through construction, and upon completion of\n\nconstruction.\n\n      The record also included copies of applications for payment submitted to\n\nMetro Bank on the project, and construction status reports with photographs. On\n\nJune 29, 2005, Dr. Nguyen and Yu both signed a document approving an\n\nadditional $400,000 in construction costs “based on Dr. Nguyen and Mr. Yu’s\n\nrequest of changes.”\n\n      By the end of 2005, the shell of the Royal Oaks Shopping Center was\n\ncompleted and ready for custom build-out by tenants who had been secured for the\n\nproperty. The tenants included restaurants, a coffee shop, and a cash-advance\n\n                                         8\n\fstorefront.   Jackie, who had been working as the property manager, was not\n\ncollecting the rent due under the leases. There were other problems. Some tenants\n\nhad financial problems, including bankruptcy, and their ability to pay the rent\n\nrequired by the leases became questionable. Construction defects became apparent\n\nas tenants readied their spaces, but rather than seeking to have the builder repair\n\nthe defects, Yu authorized the tenants to remedy the defects and charge the costs to\n\nPLTQ. To this end, Yu told Dr. Nguyen that another $1 million was required to\n\ncomplete the repairs and custom tenant build-outs.\n\n      In February 2006, Metro Bank sent Dr. Nguyen a letter informing him that\n\nhis “project costs will . . . overrun [the] loan balance by $295,391” as of the date of\n\nthe letter. The letter continued:\n\n      This is assuming that you can control your tenants’ build-out cost to\n      finish the project.\n\n      We think this is a critical situation on your project. Additional equity\n      injection is required from you to assure the project can be continued to\n      finish without interruption.\n\nBy this point, frustrated with delays, cost overruns, and lack of transparency as to\n\nhow his money was spent, Dr. Nguyen became more involved in the project. The\n\nday he received the letter from Metro Bank about the costs exceeding his loan,\n\nDr. Nguyen dismissed Jackie and sent Yu a letter addressed to “Peterson Group,\n\nInc.,” demanding an accounting of the project and seeking other information and\n\n\n\n                                          9\n\fdocumentation. In response, Yu resigned as project developer, but he demanded\n\npayment of the remaining portion of the developer’s fee.\n\n      Peterson Group and PGI sued PLTQ Lotus Group and Cubo Group\n\n(collectively, “PLTQ”) for breach of the PLTQ-PGI development agreement and\n\nbreach of the Stonegate contract. They sought attorney’s fees under Civil Practice\n\nand Remedies Code section 38.001 for both contract claims.\n\n      PLTQ answered and pleaded several affirmative defenses. PLTQ filed a\n\ncounterclaim and third-party petition against Yu and others who are not involved\n\nin this appeal. PLTQ alleged that Yu and Peterson Group were alter egos of each\n\nother. PLTQ sued Yu, Peterson Group, and PGI for fraud, specifically alleging\n\nthat Yu, on his own behalf and on behalf of Peterson Group and PGI, made\n\nmaterial misrepresentations “regarding the services he and his companies would\n\nprovide in developing the Royal Oaks Center.”              PLTQ alleged that Yu\n\nmisrepresented that he and his entities would develop the shopping center and\n\nperform the tasks enumerated in the development agreement.           PLTQ further\n\nalleged that Yu made misrepresentations as work on the shopping center\n\nprogressed, specifically in regard to monitoring the construction loan and using the\n\nfunds only for construction of the center. PLTQ alleged that Yu “intentionally\n\ntook draws against the construction loan for unauthorized expenses not related to\n\nRoyal Oaks,” and that he “knew and intended that PLTQ rely upon his\n\n                                        10\n\frepresentations of honesty and trustworthiness and PLTQ did rely upon same,”\n\ncausing it to suffer “financial damage as a result of Yu’s treachery.” PLTQ also\n\npleaded a cause of action for breach of the development agreement, saying that it\n\nset out the duties of Yu, Peterson Group, and PGI, which each failed to perform.\n\nPLTQ also sued Peterson I Realty GP, Inc., the general partner of PGI, but it later\n\ndropped this party from its pleadings. PLTQ sought a declaratory judgment that\n\nYu, Peterson Group, and PGI were all alter egos of each other.\n\n      Throughout the litigation, PLTQ raised the issue of which person or entity—\n\nPeterson Group, Yu, or PGI—had actually done the work on the Royal Oaks\n\nproject.   For example, some documents showed the involvement of Peterson\n\nGroup, such as a document prepared by a commercial broker and addressed to\n\nPeterson Group. Dr. Nguyen wrote checks both to “Peterson Group” and directly\n\nto Yu, including one to Yu dated April 4, 2005 for $100,000 with a notation\n\nreading, “Developmt Fee 2nd Draw.” Other parties, such as Tan, believed they\n\nwere working with Peterson Group. At trial, Yu explained that he was the sole\n\nemployee of Peterson Group and of PGI, and because he does not wear a uniform,\n\nwhen he is on a worksite there is no way for others to determine if he is working\n\nfor Peterson Group or for PGI. Perhaps most importantly to PLTQ, the PLTQ-PGI\n\ncontract included a provision limiting the developer’s liability solely to the PGI\n\nentity, yet PGI had no assets—not even a bank account. When asked about this at\n\n                                        11\n\ftrial, Yu said that he did not believe PGI needed a bank account: “[S]ince I do not\n\nsign on Dr. Nguyen’s checking account, I do not touch his money, I do not touch\n\nhis loan money from Metro Bank, so, only a few checks that was going to pay\n\nfrom Dr. Nguyen to myself for a development fee.”\n\n       Dr. Nguyen testified about his damages. He disagreed with Yu’s method of\n\ncalculating the developer’s fee based on the amendment providing that he earn\n\n11% of the project cost. Dr. Nguyen disagreed that items such as interest on the\n\nloan should be included in the cost that formed the basis for Yu’s 11% fee because\n\ndoing so created an incentive for delay.       Likewise Dr. Nguyen thought that\n\nincluding excessive tenant build-out costs, which were approved by Yu, created a\n\ndisincentive for managing costs because high tenant build-out costs would increase\n\nthe developer’s fee. However, Dr. Nguyen conceded that at the time he entered\n\ninto the PLTQ-PGI contract and its amendment, he understood that the developer’s\n\nfee would be based on project costs including tenant build-out costs.\n\n       Dr. Nguyen testified that he was not seeking a total refund of the developer’s\n\nfee.   He testified that Yu accomplished some of the project’s goals, and he\n\nindicated that he was satisfied with some of the tenants that Yu secured for the\n\nproject. However, Dr. Nguyen testified that he was seeking a reimbursement of\n\nthe “extra” money Yu charged. Dr. Nguyen said, “Whatever he didn’t earn he\n\nshould return to me.” Dr. Nguyen testified that he was seeking the following other\n\n                                         12\n\felements of damages in addition to the excessive developer’s fee: (1) lost rent\n\nmoney; (2) lost tenant build-out money; (3) additional cash that he was required to\n\nprovide either to satisfy bank loan requirements or project obligations; (4) the cost\n\nof employing a new contractor to repair construction defects; (5) commissions for\n\nleases on businesses that never opened or that closed shortly after opening; and\n\n(6) payment of a lien on behalf of an anticipated tenant that filed for bankruptcy.\n\nHe also testified that he borrowed against his life insurance and withdrew money\n\nfrom his retirement account to pay for project expenses, but he was unable to\n\nquantify a value of money lost by taking those actions.\n\n      The jury found that PLTQ failed to comply with the Stonegate real estate\n\ncontract, but that its failure to comply was excused because “a different\n\nperformance was accepted as full satisfaction of performance of the original\n\nobligations of the agreement” and because compliance was waived by Peterson\n\nGroup. Thus, the jury did not award Peterson Group damages on its breach of\n\ncontract claim.\n\n      The jury found that Yu and Peterson Group committed fraud against PLTQ,\n\nattributing 5% of the fraud to Yu and 95% of the fraud to Peterson Group. The\n\njury was instructed to consider only one element of damages as to fraud, which\n\nwas: “Money used without PLTQ’s knowledge or consent and not for PLTQ’s\n\n\n\n\n                                         13\n\fdirect or indirect benefit.” The jury awarded PLTQ Lotus Group $184,000 for\n\nfraud.\n\n         The jury also found that PGI failed to comply with the Royal Oaks\n\ndevelopment agreement. The question for contract damages was granulated. The\n\njury awarded PLTQ the following sums as damages for PGI’s breach of contract:\n\n(1) $158,000 for “[m]oney paid to tenants for build-outs in excess of what was\n\nagreed to under their leases or otherwise agreed to by PLTQ”; (2) $53,000 for\n\n“[m]oney PLTQ paid to tenant subcontractors as a result of workman liens or\n\nthreatened liens”; (3) $48,000 for “[t]he reasonable and necessary cost to repair\n\n[construction] work . . . at the Royal Oaks Shopping Center”; and (4) $136,021 for\n\n“[l]oss of tenant rent in the past that it would have received had the agreement been\n\nperformed.” The jury awarded no damages on the following elements of damages:\n\n(1) “[b]roker fees paid by PLTQ in excess of fees that would have been paid had\n\nthe agreement been performed”; (2) loan interest paid by PLTQ Lotus Group in\n\nexcess of interest that would have been paid had the agreement been performed;\n\n(3) loss of tenant rent in the future that it would receive had the agreement been\n\nperformed; and (4) money withdrawn from the Royal Oaks construction loan that\n\nPLTQ would not have had to pay had the agreement been performed.\n\n         After the verdict, the court ruled as a matter of law that Peterson Group and\n\nYu were alter egos of PGI. The court rendered judgment on the verdict as to the\n\n                                           14\n\ffraud cause of action in favor of PLTQ and against Peterson Group and Yu. As to\n\nthe breach of contract claim, the court rendered judgment on the verdict in favor of\n\nPLTQ and against PGI, Peterson Group, and Yu. Peterson Group, Yu, and PGI\n\nappealed.\n\n                                          Analysis\n\n    I.      Alter ego\n\n         In their first issue, the appellants argue that the trial court erred by ruling that\n\nPeterson Group and Yu were liable for breach of the development agreement\n\nbecause they were alter egos of PGI. No alter-ego question was presented to the\n\njury. Instead, the trial court granted a directed verdict that PGI was the alter ego of\n\nboth Peterson Group and Yu. It made no alter-ego findings involving PGI’s\n\ngeneral partner, Peterson I Realty GP, Inc.\n\n         Appellants argue that the alter-ego ruling was in error because the alter-ego\n\ntheory of veil-piercing simply does not apply to limited partnerships. Indeed,\n\nTexas courts have uniformly declined to apply the alter-ego theory to pierce a\n\nlimited partnership’s “veil” to impose the entity’s liabilities on a limited partner. 1\n\n\n1\n         See Seidler v.

Tex.\n      Feb. 12, 2008).\n\n      The only case we have found that suggests a contrary conclusion under\n      Texas law is Experian Information Solutions, Inc., v. Lexington Allen L.P.,\n      in which a federal magistrate judge was “not persuaded . . . that alter ego\n      liability does not apply to limited partnerships.” No. 4:10-CV-144, 2011\n      WL 1627115, at *9 (E.D. Tex. Apr. 7, 2011). The federal district court\n      accepted the magistrate judge’s recommendation to deny summary judgment\n      in the case, although the actual reasoning of the magistrate judge did not\n      depend upon a finding that veil-piercing principles apply to limited\n      partnerships. Experian Info. Solutions, Inc. v. Lexington Allen L.P.,\n      No. 4:10-CV-144, 2011 WL 1637935, at *1 (E.D. Tex. Apr. 28, 2011)\n      (adopting findings and conclusions of the magistrate judge). Instead, the\n      magistrate judge’s recommendation was premised on the Texas limited\n      partnership statute, which provides that a limited partner who participates in\n      control of the partnership’s business may be liable to third parties who\n      transact business with the limited partnership in the belief that the limited\n      partner is a general partner.

Id. § 153.302(a)(1)(E).\n\n      In contrast to general partners, limited partners in a limited partnership are\n\ngenerally not responsible for the limited partnership’s obligations unless they take\n\nsome action to accept or subject themselves to such liability. 3 Indeed, the statute\n\nexpressly provides that a limited partner “is not liable for the obligations of a\n\nlimited partnership unless” one of two circumstances applies: (1) the limited\n\npartner is also a general partner; or (2) in addition to the exercise of the limited\n\npartner’s rights and powers as a limited partner, the limited partner participates in\n\nthe control of the business. Id. § 153.102(a); see also id. § 153.003(c) (“A limited\n\npartner shall not have any obligation or duty of a general partner solely by reason\n\nof being a limited partner.”). The plain implication of the statute is that a limited\n\npartner may become liable for the obligations of the limited partnership due to the\n\nlimited partner’s participation in the “control of the business,” though that liability\n\n      piercing of limited partnerships, presumably because there is always at least\n      one general partner who has personal liability for the debts and obligations\n      of the partnership . . . .”).\n3\n      This principle is not limited by the decision in Delaney v. Fidelity Lease\n      Ltd., 526 S.W.2d 543 (Tex. 1975), noted in the dissent, which predates the\n      adoption of Chapter 153 in 2003, as well as the modern jurisprudence of the\n      Supreme Court of Texas concerning equitable veil-piercing. See generally\n      Isaminger v. Gibbs, No. 05-99-00978-CV, 2000 WL 898867, at *4 (Tex.\n      App.—Dallas July 7, 2000, pet. denied) (mem. op., not designated for\n      publication) (explaining subsequent legislative history eradicating the\n      Delaney holding).\n                                          17\n\fis limited by statute to “a person who transacts business with the limited\n\npartnership reasonably believing, based on the limited partner’s conduct, that the\n\nlimited partner is a general partner.” Id. § 153.102(b). Unlike the few courts in\n\nforeign jurisdictions which have characterized the liability that can be imposed in\n\nsuch circumstances as an equitable exercise of limited-partnership veil-piercing,4\n\nour view is that this liability is better characterized as an application of ordinary\n\npartnership principles, or, in other words, a limitation on the protection generally\n\navailable to limited partners.\n\n      Significantly, the limited partnership statute also contains an extensive list of\n\nactions which do not constitute participation in “control of the business” for\n\npurposes of third-party liability pursuant to section 153.102. As relevant to this\n\nappeal, such actions include acting as (A) a contractor for or an officer or other\n\nagent or employee of the limited partnership; (B) a contractor for or an agent or\n\nemployee of a general partner; or (C) an officer, director, or stockholder of a\n\ncorporate general partner. Id. § 153.103(1).\n\n      In defense of the trial court’s alter-ego finding, PLTQ does not rely on any\n\nof these statutory provisions to establish that Peterson Group or Yu are liable for\n\nthe obligations of the PGI limited partnership, either as general or limited partners.\n\n4\n      See Canter v. Lakewood of Voorhees, 22 A.3d 68, 70 (N.J. Super. Ct. App.\n      Div. 2011); In re Adelphia Commc’ns Corp., 376 B.R. 87, 93–94 (Bankr.\n      S.D.N.Y. 2007).\n\n                                         18\n\fInstead, PLTQ relies exclusively on common-law principles supporting the alter-\n\nego veil-piercing doctrine, as supposedly applied in Speedemissions, Inc. v. Capital\n\nC. Enterprises, Ltd., No. 01-07-00400-CV, 2008 WL 4006748 (Tex. App.—\n\nHouston [1st Dist.] Aug. 28, 2008, no pet.) (mem. op.), and Solutioneers\n\nConsulting, Ltd. v. Gulf Greyhound Partners, Ltd., 237 S.W.3d 379 (Tex. App.—\n\nHouston [14th Dist.] 2007, no pet.), for its contention that the alter-ego theory may\n\nbe applied to a limited partnership. We find both cases to be inapplicable. In\n\nSpeedemissions, a vehicle-inspection business alleged that its former employee\n\ntortiously interfered with its business relationships and misappropriated\n\nconfidential information. Speedemissions, 2008 WL 4006748, at *1. In response\n\nto a no-evidence motion for summary judgment, Speedemissions argued that\n\nCapital C Enterprises was the alter ego of its former employee. Id. at *8 & n.6.\n\nAlthough the opinion set forth the black-letter law pertaining to the alter-ego\n\ntheory and piercing the corporate veil, the case was decided on a different basis,\n\nthat there were no “triable issues of fact” to support the argument that Capital C\n\nEnterprises was the alter ego of the former Speedemissions employee. Id. at *9.\n\nSimilarly, in Solutioneers Consulting, the Fourteenth Court of Appeals recited the\n\nblack-letter law on piercing the corporate veil, and then concluded that there was\n\nno evidence to support the jury’s verdict that Solutioneers Consulting was the alter\n\nego of its owner. Solutioneers Consulting, 237 S.W.3d at 387–88. Thus, neither\n\n                                         19\n\fcase actually applied the alter-ego theory or any other veil-piercing theory to\n\nsubject a limited partner to the liability of a limited partnership.\n\n      The significance of the trial court’s alter-ego finding in this case is that it is\n\nthe basis for holding Peterson Group and Yu liable for PGI’s breach of the\n\ndevelopment agreement. But that agreement expressly limited the developer’s\n\nliability to the “assets” of the PGI entity. Moreover, the undisputed fact is that\n\nPLTQ Lotus Group’s sole contractual counterparty to that agreement was PGI\n\nitself, expressly identified in the agreement’s signature block as a limited\n\npartnership. The agreement was executed on behalf of PGI by Peterson I Realty\n\nGP, Inc., identified as PGI’s general partner, and it was signed on behalf of that\n\nentity by Yu, identified as Peterson I Realty GP’s president.\n\n      PLTQ alleged in its pleadings that Peterson Group and Yu were alter egos of\n\nPGI, a limited partnership. Although PLTQ initially sued PGI’s general partner, it\n\nlater nonsuited the general partner and chose to proceed solely against Peterson\n\nGroup, Yu, and PGI. At oral argument, counsel for PLTQ explained that because\n\nthe general partner is liable for the debts of the partnership, a judgment against PGI\n\nwould be sufficient to impose liability on Peterson I Realty GP, Inc. However, the\n\nrelief sought by PLTQ is not the imposition of liability on Peterson I Realty GP,\n\nInc.; it is, instead, seeking to impose liability on Peterson Group and Yu for the\n\nobligations of PGI.\n\n                                           20\n\f      The veil-piercing doctrine as applied to corporate alter egos has never been\n\nindiscriminately applied to impute liability to arguably responsible bystanders—it\n\nis applied to the owners and operators of the firm, including “shareholders,\n\nofficers, and directors” who otherwise would ordinarily be insulated from liability\n\nfor corporate obligations. See, e.g., Castleberry v. Branscum, 721 S.W.2d 270,\n\n271 (Tex. 1986). Or in other words, when the “fiction” of the corporate or other\n\nentity form is disregarded—when its “veil” is “pierced”—there must be some\n\nobjective basis for identifying those persons or other entities who in reality were\n\nresponsible for the actions of and the liabilities created by the disregarded entity.\n\nTo the extent the equitable doctrine could be applied to a limited partnership, it\n\nlikewise would only apply to impute liability to analogous constituents of the\n\nlimited partnership, such as the limited partners and managers responsible for\n\ncontrolling the business.5 Moreover, the application of the doctrine would be\n\nlimited to circumstances in which the limited partnership was used to perpetrate\n\nactual fraud for the direct, personal benefit of the defendant. Cf. Shook v. Walden,\n\n368 S.W.3d 604, 621 (Tex. App.—Austin 2012, pet. denied) (“claimants seeking\n\n\n\n5\n      Of course to the extent a limited partnership’s general partner is itself a\n      corporation or other liability-limiting entity—just as PGI’s general partner\n      was a corporation—then that entity itself may be subject to veil-piercing.\n      PLTQ did not seek that remedy in this case. It nonsuited its claims against\n      the general partner, and it proceeded solely on an equitable theory that\n      Peterson and Yu could be held liable as alter egos of PGI.\n                                         21\n\fto pierce the veil of an LLC must meet the same requirements as they would if the\n\nentity were a corporation”).6\n\n      Here, there are only two identifiable parties behind the “veil” of PGI’s\n\nlimited partnership structure–its general partner (Peterson I Realty GP, Inc.) and its\n\nsole limited partner (Yu). PLTQ abandoned its pleading which sought to pierce\n\nthe corporate veil of Peterson I Realty GP, Inc., and it never litigated the question\n\nof whether Peterson Group and Yu were alter egos of the general partner. Nor did\n\nPLTQ plead or prove that Peterson Group was a limited partner of PGI, such that it\n\ncould be held liable for PGI’s obligations, either pursuant to section 153.102 of the\n\nBusiness Organizations Code or by equitable veil-piercing. Finally, PLTQ has not\n\nasserted in the trial court or on appeal that Yu, as limited partner, can be held liable\n\nfor the limited partnership’s liabilities pursuant to section 153.102, and in\n\nparticular there has been no allegation or proof that PLTQ reasonably believed that\n\n\n\n6\n      Contrary to the dissent’s suggestion, application of the veil-piercing doctrine\n      in this case also should not hinge on the unsupported speculation that PGI\n      failed to comply with some regulatory formality. Adherence to corporate\n      formalities has been de-emphasized by most Texas courts conducting a veil-\n      piercing analysis ever since the legislative admonition that liabilities for\n      corporate obligations not be imposed on corporate stakeholders based upon\n      “the failure of the corporation to observe any corporate formality.” TEX.\n      BUS. ORGS. CODE § 21.223(a)(3) (West 2012); see, e.g., Howell v. Hilton\n      Hotels Corp., 84 S.W.3d 708, 714 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2002,\n      pet. denied) (“Under Business Corporation Act article 2.21, observance of\n      corporate formalities is no longer a factor that can be considered in\n      determining alter ego.”).\n                                          22\n\fYu was a general partner of PGI.7 To impose a limited partnership’s liability on its\n\nlimited partner in this case under the guise of the equitable veil-piercing doctrine\n\nwould eviscerate the statutory framework governing the limitation of liability for\n\nlimited partnerships as expressed in section 153.102(b), and thus we decline to\n\napply it in this case. Cf. Shook, 368 S.W.3d at 621 (emphasizing the importance of\n\ndeferring to legislative standards governing veil piercing of corporations). 8\n\n      We conclude that the trial court erred by finding that Peterson Group and Yu\n\nare the alter egos of PGI. We sustain the first issue, and we hold that Peterson\n\nGroup and Yu are not liable for PGI’s breach of the development contract.\n\n\n\n\n7\n      See TEX. BUS. ORGS. CODE § 153.102(b) (“If the limited partner participates\n      in the control of the business, the limited partner is liable only to a person\n      who transacts business with the limited partnership reasonably believing,\n      based on the limited partner’s conduct, that the limited partner is a general\n      partner.”). Although our dissenting colleague would hold Yu liable under\n      section 153.102(b) purely “[b]ecause of the control he exercised over the\n      activities of PGI,” apparently without regard for the substantial scope of\n      activities covered by the safe harbor of section 153.103, it is nevertheless\n      plain that mere control is not sufficient—a claimant must also demonstrate a\n      reasonable belief, based on the limited partner’s own conduct, that the\n      limited partner is a general partner.\n8\n      Even the bankruptcy court in Adelphia, which recognized a theoretical\n      possibility of equitable veil-piercing of limited partnerships under Delaware\n      law, warned that “veil piercing and other equitable remedies cannot be\n      utilized as an ‘end run’ around the proof required in Section 17–303 [the\n      Delaware counterpart to TEX. BUS. ORGS. CODE §§ 153.102–.103] to permit\n      a third party to prevail on a lesser showing.” In re Adelphia Commc’ns, 376\n      B.R. at 108.\n                                          23\n\fII.   Attorney’s fees\n\n      At trial, the parties stipulated to lump-sum attorney’s fees, which were not\n\nsegregated by cause of action, and the trial court awarded PLTQ the stipulated\n\namount of attorney’s fees. In their second issue, the appellants contend that the\n\ntrial court erred by ruling that Peterson Group and Yu were responsible for\n\nattorney’s fees. Specifically, the appellants argue that Peterson Group and Yu\n\ncannot be held liable as alter egos of PGI for attorney’s fees awarded on PLTQ’s\n\ncause of action for breach of the development agreement. Among other things,\n\nthey argue that PLTQ is not entitled to recover contractual attorney’s fees when it\n\npleaded only for statutory attorney’s fees.\n\n      First, having held that Peterson Group and Yu are not alter egos of PGI, we\n\nconclude that they cannot be held liable for the attorney’s fees awarded on PLTQ’s\n\ncause of action for breach of the PLTQ-PGI Royal Oaks development agreement.\n\n      Nevertheless, PLTQ contends that it is entitled to recover attorney’s fees\n\nfrom Peterson Group both because of a trial stipulation and under the Stonegate\n\ncontract. This contract included a provision for awarding attorney’s fees in a suit\n\nto enforce or interpret the contract:\n\n            11.15. Attorney’s Fees. If any action at law or in equity\n      becomes necessary to enforce or interpret any term, provision or\n      condition of this Contract, the prevailing party shall be entitled to\n      recover the reasonable attorney’s fees, costs, and necessary\n      disbursements (including, but not limited to, expert witness fees and\n\n                                         24\n\f       deposition costs) incurred or made by it in addition to any other relief\n       to which it may become entitled.\n\nPLTQ argues that all of appellants’ arguments are really about failure to segregate.\n\nWe disagree.      Peterson Group and Yu have advanced alternative arguments,\n\nincluding the failure to segregate and the argument that they are not liable for\n\nattorney’s fees at all.\n\n       “As a general rule, litigants in Texas are responsible for their own attorney’s\n\nfees and expenses in litigation.” Ashford Partners, Ltd. v. ECO Res., Inc., 435\n\nS.W.3d 35, 41 (Tex. 2012). Under Texas law, a court may award attorney’s fees\n\nonly when authorized by statute or by the parties’ contract. MBM Fin. Corp. v.\n\nWoodlands Operating Co., 292 S.W.3d 660, 669 (Tex. 2009). Whether a party is\n\nentitled to seek an award of attorney’s fees is a question of law that we review de\n\nnovo. Holland v. Wal–Mart Stores, Inc., 1 S.W.3d 91, 94 (Tex. 1999).\n\n       The Civil Practice and Remedies Code provides that “[a] person may\n\nrecover reasonable attorney’s fees from an individual or corporation, in addition to\n\nthe amount of a valid claim and costs, if the claim is for . . . an oral or written\n\ncontract.” TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE. ANN. § 38.001 (West Supp. 2012). To\n\nobtain an award of attorney’s fees under Section 38.001, “a party must (1) prevail\n\non a cause of action for which attorney’s fees are recoverable, and (2) recover\n\ndamages.” Green Int’l, Inc. v. Solis, 951 S.W.2d 384, 390 (Tex. 1997).\n\n\n\n                                          25\n\f      However, “[p]arties are free to contract for a fee-recovery standard either\n\nlooser or stricter than Chapter 38’s.” Intercontinental Grp. P’ship v. KB Home\n\nLone Star L.P., 295 S.W.3d 650, 653 (Tex. 2009). When parties include such a\n\nprovision in a contract, the language of the contract controls, rather than the\n\nlanguage of the statute. Id. at 654–56 (reviewing definition of “prevailing party”\n\nunder contract to determine whether plaintiff who had not recovered any actual\n\ndamages was entitled to recover attorney’s fees). Thus, a party who successfully\n\ndefends a breach of contract claim but does not recover damages might be entitled\n\nto attorney’s fees under a contractual provision even though he would not be\n\nentitled to attorney’s fees under Chapter 38. See Robbins v. Capozzi, 100 S.W.3d\n\n18, 22–23, 27 (Tex. App.—Tyler 2002, no pet.); Weng Enters., Inc. v. Embassy\n\nWorld Travel, Inc., 837 S.W.2d 217, 222–23 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.]\n\n1992, no writ); Silver Lion, Inc. v. Dolphin St., Inc., No. 01–07–00370–CV, 2010\n\nWL 2025749, at *18 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] May 20, 2010, pet. denied)\n\n(mem. op.); see also Epps v. Fowler, 351 S.W.3d 862, 868–69 (Tex. 2011)\n\n(holding that defendant is prevailing party for purposes of award of attorney’s fees\n\nwhen plaintiff nonsuits case with prejudice).       In light of this difference in\n\napplication of statutory and contractual attorney’s fees, and because a court’s\n\njudgment must conform to the pleadings, see TEX. R. CIV. P. 301, a party who\n\npleads for attorney’s fees only under Chapter 38 waives its claim for attorney’s\n\n                                        26\n\ffees under a contractual provision. See Intercontinental Grp. P’ship, 295 S.W.3d\n\nat 659.\n\n      In its live pleading at trial, PLTQ pleaded for reasonable attorney’s fees\n\nunder Chapter 38 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code. It did not plead\n\nfor attorney’s fees under the “prevailing party” provision of the Stonegate contract.\n\nPLTQ first raised this theory in a post-trial motion to amend its pleadings.\n\nAppellants opposed this motion on the grounds that it would cause them prejudice\n\nbecause PLTQ had consistently denied the existence of that contract. In response,\n\nPLTQ argued that it was sufficient that it had pleaded for attorney’s fees based on\n\nfrivolity and harassment, as opposed to the contractual provision. However, the\n\nappellate record does not include any amended PLTQ pleading actually alleging\n\nentitlement to recovery of attorney’s fees under the Stonegate contract. Moreover,\n\nalthough the jury found in favor of PLTQ on its affirmative defense, because\n\nPLTQ did not recover damages related to the Stonegate contract, it is not entitled\n\nto attorney’s fees under Chapter 38 on the basis of its favorable jury finding on the\n\nStonegate contract.   See Green Int’l, 951 S.W.2d at 390.         We hold that the\n\njudgment awarding attorney’s fees against Peterson Group and Yu cannot be\n\nsupported on the basis of the contractual attorney’s fees provision in the Stonegate\n\ncontract. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 301 (stating that judgment must conform to the\n\npleadings); Intercontinental Grp. P’ship, 295 S.W.3d at 659 (holding that party\n\n                                         27\n\fwaived its right to recover attorney’s fees under a contractual provision by\n\npleading for attorney’s fees only under Chapter 38); see also Stoner v. Thompson,\n\n578 S.W.2d 679, 682–84 (Tex. 1979) (holding that party may not be granted relief\n\nin the absence of pleadings to support that relief).\n\n       Finally, the parties’ trial stipulation as to the amount, reasonableness, and\n\nnecessity was an agreement as to what amount of attorney’s fees the court would\n\naward to the prevailing party. It was not a basis for an award of attorney’s fees.\n\nSee Ashford Partners, 401 S.W.3d at 41.\n\n       We sustain this issue, and hold that the trial court erred by rendering\n\njudgment that awarded PLTQ its attorney’s fees against Peterson Group and Yu.\n\nIII.   Economic loss rule\n\n       In their third issue appellants argue that PLTQ’s fraud claim was barred by\n\nthe economic loss rule because it arose from a breach of duties established by the\n\ncontract between PGI and PLTQ Lotus Group. Appellants thus contend that the\n\ntrial court erred by denying their motions for directed verdict and judgment\n\nnotwithstanding the verdict on the fraud claim.\n\n       A trial court may disregard a jury’s findings and grant a motion for judgment\n\nn.o.v. only when a directed verdict would have been proper. See TEX. R. CIV. P.\n\n301; Fort Bend Cnty. Drainage Dist. v. Sbrusch, 818 S.W.2d 392, 394 (Tex. 1991);\n\nsee also Prudential Ins. Co. v. Fin. Review Servs., Inc., 29 S.W.3d 74, 77 (Tex.\n\n                                          28\n\f2000).   Judgment n.o.v. should be granted when a legal principle precludes\n\nrecovery. See B & W Supply, Inc. v. Beckman, 305 S.W.3d 10, 15 (Tex. App.—\n\nHouston [1st Dist.] 2009, pet. denied).\n\n      “Although the Texas Supreme Court described the term as ‘something of a\n\nmisnomer,’ one general formulation of the economic loss rule, as applicable to this\n\ncase, is that a party may not recover in tort for purely economic losses suffered to\n\nthe subject matter of a contract.” James J. Flanagan Shipping Corp. v. Del Monte\n\nFresh Produce N.A., Inc., 403 S.W.3d 360, 365 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.]\n\n2013, no pet.) (quoting Sharyland Water Supply Corp. v. City of Alton, 354 S.W.3d\n\n407, 415, 418 (Tex. 2011)). To determine whether the economic loss rule applies,\n\nwe consider “both the source of the defendant’s duty to act (whether it arose solely\n\nout of the contract or from some common-law duty) and the nature of the remedy\n\nsought by the plaintiff.”   Formosa Plastics Corp. USA v. Presidio Eng’rs &\n\nContractors, Inc., 960 S.W.2d 41, 45 (Tex. 1998) (quoting Crawford v. Ace Sign,\n\nInc., 917 S.W.2d 12, 12 (Tex. 1996)). We look to the substance of the cause of\n\naction, not the manner in which it was pleaded, to determine the type of action that\n\nis brought. Jim Walter Homes, Inc. v. Reed, 711 S.W.2d 617, 617–18 (Tex. 1986).\n\n“The nature of the injury most often determines which duty or duties are breached.\n\nWhen the injury is only the economic loss to the subject of a contract itself, the\n\naction sounds in contract alone.” Id. at 618.\n\n                                          29\n\f      Under some circumstances, however, a party’s actions may breach duties\n\nsimultaneously in contract and in tort. See id. To maintain a separate tort cause of\n\naction, the plaintiff must show that he has “suffered an injury that is distinct,\n\nseparate, and independent from the economic losses recoverable under a breach of\n\ncontract claim.” Sterling Chems., Inc. v. Texaco Inc., 259 S.W.3d 793, 797 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2007, pet. denied) (citing D.S.A. Inc. v. Hillsboro Indep.\n\nSch. Dist., 973 S.W.2d 662, 663–64 (Tex. 1998)). Therefore, while the economic\n\nloss rule has been applied to bar negligence and products liability causes of action\n\nwhen the injury alleged was also the subject matter of a contract, see Sharyland\n\nWater Supply, 354 S.W.3d at 417–18, it has not been extended to bar recovery for\n\nfraud or fraudulent inducement. See id. at 418; Formosa Plastics, 960 S.W.2d at\n\n46; see also Flanagan Shipping, 403 S.W.3d at 365; Matlock Place Apartments,\n\nL.P. v. Druce, 369 S.W.3d 355, 378 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2012, pet. denied)\n\n(holding that economic loss rule did not bar recovery for statutory fraud).\n\n      Here, PLTQ’s fraud claim is based on material misrepresentations made by\n\nPGI, Peterson Group, and Yu. While the development agreement enumerated the\n\nvarious tasks that Yu and his entities would perform in furtherance of developing\n\nRoyal Oaks, PLTQ’s fraud claim was not based on a failure to accomplish these\n\ntasks or negligence in carrying them out. Rather, PLTQ’s fraud claim was based\n\non the separate harm it suffered as a result of Yu’s misrepresentations and acts of\n\n                                         30\n\fdishonesty which did not further the goal of developing the Royal Oaks Shopping\n\nCenter. For example, PLTQ contends that “Peterson covertly spearheaded the theft\n\nof the funds” by encouraging Atlantic Builders and Tan to submit false bank draws\n\non PLTQ’s loan account. These funds were not all expended on Royal Oaks, such\n\nthat PLTQ would obtain a benefit as contemplated by the development agreement.\n\nTo the contrary, the evidence showed that Yu orchestrated withdrawals from the\n\nconstruction loan which were then directed away from the Royal Oaks project,\n\nincluding $124,442.63 diverted to Yu’s development at Stonegate and $60,000\n\npaid to Peterson for undocumented expenses related to phantom tenants. In the\n\nfraud damages question, the jury was asked to quantify the amount of money “used\n\nwithout PLTQ’s knowledge or consent and not for PLTQ’s direct or indirect\n\nbenefit,” and in response to this question the jury found damages in the amount of\n\n$184,000.9\n\n      The jury agreed with PLTQ and found that Peterson and Yu committed\n\nfraud. Peterson and Yu argue that their actions amount only to a breach of the\n\nparties’ agreement and are not fraudulent. For its breach of contract claim, PLTQ\n\n\n9\n      Any construction loan funds spent on Royal Oaks would have been used for\n      the benefit of PLTQ, so contrary to the dissent’s reasoning, this jury finding\n      is perfectly consistent with the separate finding that no contract damages—\n      defined as damages “that resulted from PGI Development’s failure to\n      comply with the Royal Oaks Development Agreement”—resulted from\n      “[m]oney withdrawn from the Royal Oaks construction loan that PLTQ\n      would not have had to pay had the agreement been performed.”\n                                        31\n\fsought to recover sums of money paid toward the development of the Royal Oaks\n\nShopping Center that it would not have had to pay if the agreement had been\n\nperformed, such as excess tenant build-out costs, money paid to tenant\n\nsubcontractors to satisfy workman liens or avoid the imposition of liens, and the\n\nreasonable and necessary costs to repair work performed by Atlantic. In addition\n\nPLTQ sought recovery of lost rent that it alleges it would have collected had the\n\nagreement been performed. These are consequential damages arising from PGI’s\n\nfailure to perform as it was obligated under the development agreement.\n\n      However the duty not to commit fraud is different from and independent of\n\nthe duty to comply with the terms of a contract. See Formosa Plastics Corp., 960\n\nS.W.2d at 47–48. And as to its claim for fraud, PLTQ sought to recover for a\n\ncategory of damages that was distinctly different from the contract damages:\n\n“[m]oney used without [its] knowledge or consent and not for [its] direct or\n\nindirect benefit.” The nature of the fraud injury is money that PLTQ lost as a\n\nresult of Yu’s deceitful actions, not simply economic loss related to the shopping\n\ncenter itself, i.e., the subject matter of the contract. See Flanagan Shipping, 403\n\nS.W.3d at 365. Thus, the alleged fraud injury did not arise from the contract, and\n\nthe economic loss rule does not apply. See id.; Formosa Plastics, 960 S.W.2d at\n\n47; see also Sharyland Water Supply, 354 S.W.3d at 418 (noting economic losses\n\n\n\n\n                                        32\n\fare recoverable for breach of fiduciary duty). Therefore, the trial court did not err\n\nin denying appellants’ motion for judgment n.o.v. We overrule the third issue.\n\n   IV.   Election of remedies\n\n      In their fourth issue, appellants argue that if PLTQ’s fraud claim is not\n\nbarred by the economic loss rule, then PLTQ should have been required to elect a\n\nremedy as between the tort and fraud damages awarded by the jury.\n\n      A party is entitled to sue and seek damages on alternative theories, but it is\n\nnot entitled to a double recovery. Waite Hill Servs., Inc. v. World Class Metal\n\nWorks, Inc., 959 S.W.2d 182, 184 (Tex. 1998); Madison v. Williamson, 241\n\nS.W.3d 145, 158 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2007, pet. denied).             “If a\n\nplaintiff pleads alternate theories of liability, a judgment awarding damages on\n\neach alternate theory may be upheld if the theories depend on separate and distinct\n\ninjuries and if separate and distinct damages findings are made as to each theory.”\n\nMadison, 241 S.W.3d at 158; see Birchfield v. Texarkana Mem’l Hosp., 747\n\nS.W.2d 361, 367 (Tex. 1987). “Under the one-satisfaction rule, [however,] a\n\nplaintiff is entitled to only one recovery for any damages suffered because of a\n\nparticular injury.” Utts v. Short, 81 S.W.3d 822, 831 (Tex. 2002); accord Tony\n\nGullo Motors I, L.P. v. Chapa, 212 S.W.3d 299, 303 (Tex. 2006); Crown Life Ins.\n\nCo. v. Casteel, 22 S.W.3d 378, 390 (Tex. 2000); Stewart Title Guar. Co. v.\n\nSterling, 822 S.W.2d 1, 7 (Tex. 1991); Madison, 241 S.W.3d at 158. The principle\n\n                                         33\n\fapplies when “the trial court elects the remedy which affords an injured plaintiff\n\nthe most favorable relief against a single defendant when multiple theories of\n\nliability cause an indivisible injury.” Madison, 241 S.W.3d at 158–59; compare\n\nUtts, 81 S.W.3d at 831, and Sterling, 822 S.W.2d at 5, with Birchfield, 747 S.W.2d\n\nat 367, and Chapa, 212 S.W.3d at 303.\n\n        We have already explained not only that PLTQ’s fraud claim was viable but\n\nalso that it was different from and sought recovery of different damages from\n\nPLTQ’s claim for breach of contract. Because the jury awarded PLTQ separate\n\nand distinct damages for separate and distinct injuries for fraud and breach of\n\ncontract, no election of remedies is required, and the jury’s verdict awarding\n\ndamages for both may be upheld. See Madison, 241 S.W.3d at 158; Birchfield,\n\n747 S.W.2d at 367. We overrule this issue.\n\n   V.      Lost tenant rent\n\n        In their fifth issue, appellants argue that the trial court erred by not granting\n\ntheir motion for j.n.o.v. as to $136,021 of the jury’s award of contract damages\n\nbecause lost tenant rent was too speculative. The appellants do not argue that lost\n\nrents were not available as damages for breach of the development agreement, and\n\nfor purposes of this issue we assume that they were. Instead, in their motion for\n\nj.n.o.v., they argued that lost tenant rent was an inappropriately speculative\n\nmeasure of damages because Royal Oaks was a new enterprise and had no\n\n                                           34\n\festablished track record. Appellants thus contend that there was no evidence from\n\nwhich the lost profits could be estimated.\n\n      To recover damages for breach of contract, a plaintiff must show that he\n\nsuffered a pecuniary loss as a result of the breach. S. Elec. Servs., Inc. v. City of\n\nHouston, 355 S.W.3d 319, 323–24 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2011, pet.\n\ndenied).   To recover lost profit damages, a plaintiff must show the loss by\n\ncompetent evidence and with reasonable certainty. See ERI Consulting Eng’rs,\n\nInc. v. Swinnea, 318 S.W.3d 867, 876 (Tex. 2010); Tex. Instruments, Inc. v.\n\nTeletron Energy Mgmt, Inc., 877 S.W.2d 276, 279 (Tex. 1994). “Such losses must\n\nbe the natural, probable, and foreseeable consequence of the defendant’s conduct.”\n\nS. Elec. Servs., 355 S.W.3d at 324. A plaintiff may not recover breach-of-contract\n\ndamages “if those damages are remote, contingent, speculative, or conjectural.”\n\nId. at 323–24. “Thus, the absence of a causal connection between the alleged\n\nbreach and the damages sought will preclude recovery.” Id. at 324.\n\n      Both parties have briefed this issue in the trial court and in this court as one\n\npertaining to the recovery of lost profits. “Lost profits are damages for the loss of\n\nnet income to a business and, broadly speaking, reflect income from lost business\n\nactivity, less expenses that would have been attributable to that activity.” Bowen v.\n\nRobinson, 227 S.W.3d 86, 96 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2006, pet. denied)\n\n(citing Miga v. Jensen, 96 S.W.3d 207, 213 (Tex. 2002)). The complaint on appeal\n\n                                         35\n\fis that the damages awarded were speculative, and the settled case law pertaining\n\nto the award of lost profits is instructive.\n\n      “What constitutes reasonably certain evidence of lost profits is a fact\n\nintensive determination.” Holt Atherton Indus., Inc. v. Heine, 835 S.W.2d 80, 84\n\n(Tex. 1992). “As a minimum, opinions or estimates of lost profits must be based\n\non objective facts, figures, or data from which the amount of lost profits can be\n\nascertained.” Id. Lost profits cannot be based on pure speculation or wishful\n\nthinking. Tex. Instruments, 877 S.W.2d at 279. The Supreme Court of Texas has\n\nstated:\n\n      Profits which are largely speculative, as from an activity dependent on\n      uncertain or changing market conditions, or on chancy business\n      opportunities, or on promotion of untested products or entry into\n      unknown or unviable markets, or on the success of a new and\n      unproven enterprise, cannot be recovered. Factors like these and\n      others which make a business venture risky in prospect preclude\n      recovery of lost profits in retrospect. . . . The mere hope for success of\n      an untried enterprise, even when that hope is realistic, is not enough\n      for recovery of lost profits.\n\nId. at 279–80.\n\n      However, the fact that a business is new does not absolutely preclude\n\nrecovery of lost profits. See id. at 280; Hernandez v. Sovereign Cherokee Nation\n\nTejas, 343 S.W.3d 162, 174 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2011, pet. denied).               Rather,\n\n“[w]hen there are firmer reasons to expect a business to yield a profit, the\n\nenterprise is not prohibited from recovering merely because it is new.” Tex.\n\n                                               36\n\fInstruments, 877 S.W.2d at 280. Thus, in the case of an untested business seeking\n\nlost-profits damages, the inquiry should focus on the experience of the people\n\ninvolved in the enterprise, the nature of the business activity, and the relevant\n\nmarket. Id.\n\n      Under the development agreement, the developer was required to oversee\n\nleasing of the project. PLTQ contended that the tenants that Yu found for the\n\nshopping center were unable to meet their obligations and Yu’s failure to find\n\ntenants who were able to pay the rent was a breach of contract. Dr. Nguyen\n\nsecured replacement tenants, and the old and new leases were introduced into\n\nevidence at trial without objection.\n\n      PLTQ sought lost tenant rents based on the difference between the rents in\n\nthe leases secured by Yu and Peterson Group and those for the replacement\n\ntenants. There is no suggestion that the replacement leases were unprofitable or\n\nthat they resulted in increased expenses, so the difference in the rent between the\n\noriginal leases and the replacement leases corresponds to lost profit.\n\n      Although PLTQ was new to the real estate business, Yu and Peterson Group\n\nwere not. Contrary to the appellants’ arguments, the jury had the actual leases\n\nfrom the tenants that Yu secured as a basis from which it could assess lost tenant\n\nrent damages. In this case, the party responsible for overseeing the leases had\n\nexperience in the relevant market, which was not an untested business. Rather, it\n\n                                         37\n\fwas the leasing of commercial real estate in a strip mall. The relevant market\n\nincluded restaurants and businesses providing goods and services. Notably, the\n\nintroduction of the leases themselves provided evidence from which the jury could\n\nestimate lost tenant rents without speculation. Accordingly, we conclude that the\n\nlost tenant rents were not too speculative to be awarded, and we hold that the trial\n\ncourt did not err in denying the motion for judgment n.o.v. on this ground. We\n\noverrule this issue.\n\n                                   Conclusion\n\n      Solely with respect to Peterson Group and Yu, we reverse the judgment as to\n\nbreach of the development agreement, including attorney’s fees.        In all other\n\nrespects we affirm. We remand this case to the trial court for calculation of pre-\n\nand post-judgment interest and for further proceedings in accordance with this\n\nopinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                             Michael Massengale\n                                             Justice\n\nPanel consists of Justices Keyes, Higley, and Massengale.\n\nJustice Keyes, dissenting.\n\n\n\n\n                                        38\n\f",

Appellants Peterson Group, Inc., PGI Development, L.P.,\n\nand Wellington Yu sued appellees PLTQ Lotus Group, L.P. and Cubo Group,\n\fL.L.C. (collectively, “PLTQ”) for money due under a purchase agreement and a\n\nreal estate development agreement.          PLTQ countersued for breach of the\n\ndevelopment agreement and fraud in connection with the real estate development\n\nproject. PLTQ also argued that Peterson Group and Yu were alter egos of PGI.\n\n      The jury found for PLTQ against Peterson Group and Yu on the fraud claim.\n\nThe jury also found for PLTQ against PGI on the breach of contract claim. After\n\nthe verdict, the court found as a matter of law that Peterson Group and Yu were\n\nalter egos of PGI. As to the fraud cause of action, the court awarded damages\n\nfound by the jury, plus pre- and post-judgment interest, in favor of PLTQ and\n\nagainst Peterson Group and Yu. As to the contract claim, the court awarded\n\ndamages found by the jury, plus pre- and post-judgment interest and attorney’s\n\nfees, in favor of PLTQ and against PGI, Peterson Group, and Yu. Thus Peterson\n\nGroup and Yu were held jointly liable as alter egos for PGI’s breach of contract\n\nand for the attorney’s fees awarded based on that cause of action.\n\n      In the first two issues, the appellants challenge the trial court’s ruling that\n\nPeterson Group and Yu were alter egos of PGI and the trial court’s award of\n\nattorney’s fees against Peterson Group and Yu. In their third and fourth issues,\n\nappellants argue that PLTQ’s fraud claim was barred by the economic loss rule and\n\nthat, in the alternative, PLTQ was required to elect a remedy between fraud and\n\nbreach of contract. In their fifth issue, appellants contend that the trial court should\n\n                                           2\n\fhave granted their motion for judgment n.o.v. as to breach-of-contract damages for\n\nlost tenant rent because such damages were too speculative to have been awarded.\n\n      We conclude that the trial court erred by finding Peterson Group and Yu to\n\nbe alter egos of PGI. We further conclude that PLTQ’s fraud claim was not barred\n\nby the economic loss rule nor was PLTQ required to elect a remedy between fraud\n\nand breach of contract. Finally, we conclude that the damages awarded for lost\n\ntenant rent were not speculative.\n\n      We reverse the trial court’s judgment insofar as it awarded damages for\n\nbreach of contract against Peterson Group and Yu, including attorney’s fees, and\n\nwe affirm in all other respects.\n\n                                    Background\n\n      In the spring of 2003, Dr. Loi Nguyen, a practicing cardiologist, formed\n\nPLTQ Lotus Group, L.P. for the purpose of investing in and developing real estate.\n\nCubo Group, LLC is the general partner of PLTQ Lotus Group, and Dr. Nguyen is\n\nthe president of Cubo Group. Dr. Nguyen purchased land in Houston with the\n\nintention of building a medical center where his office would be located. He\n\npurchased the land with a loan from First Bank.          Jackie Nguyen, who is\n\nDr. Nguyen’s former wife and a real estate agent, introduced Dr. Nguyen to\n\nWellington Yu. Yu is a real estate developer, primarily developing shopping\n\n\n\n\n                                        3\n\fcenters in the Houston suburbs. Yu conducts his real-estate development work\n\nprimarily through his company, Peterson Group, Inc.\n\n      Yu persuaded Dr. Nguyen to purchase two additional acres adjoining the\n\nland he had purchased for the medical center and to develop the land instead as a\n\nshopping center. Yu arranged a construction loan from Metro Bank, which was\n\nused to satisfy the loan from First Bank and to fund the purchase of the additional\n\ntwo acres. The construction loan was also to cover the cost of developing the\n\nproperty into a shopping center, which they called the Royal Oaks Shopping\n\nCenter. Yu formed a limited partnership, PGI Development Group, L.P., for the\n\npurpose of developing the Royal Oaks Shopping Center. Peterson I Realty GP,\n\nInc. is the general partner of PGI. Yu is a limited partner of PGI, the president of\n\nPeterson I Realty GP, Inc., and the president of Peterson Group.\n\n      Shortly after the two additional acres were purchased for the Royal Oaks\n\nproject, Yu showed Dr. Nguyen some land that he was developing as a strip center\n\nnear Stonegate Commons, a residential development on the northwest side of\n\nHouston. Yu owned two acres of land there that he intended to develop, and he\n\nhad a contract to purchase an additional eight acres adjacent to the land. He\n\npersuaded Dr. Nguyen to buy six of those acres, and in August 2003, Dr. Nguyen\n\nsigned a purchase agreement, “the Stonegate contract.” Yu and Peterson Group\n\nwould later contend that Dr. Nguyen owed them $730,000 on this transaction.\n\n                                         4\n\f      By November 2003, Yu and Dr. Nguyen were proceeding with the Royal\n\nOaks Shopping Center project. On November 13, 2003, Peterson Group and\n\nPLTQ Lotus Group entered into a development agreement for Royal Oaks. This\n\none-page agreement established that Peterson Group, as the developer, would be\n\nresponsible to: (1) negotiate the purchase of the land; (2) design and engineer the\n\nfacility, including obtaining construction permits; (3) lease the shopping center;\n\n(4) construct the shopping center; (5) assist in obtaining bank financing;\n\n(6) perform accounting on the cost of the project; and (7) oversee tenant move-in\n\nand construction. PLTQ Lotus Group agreed to pay Peterson Group a developer\n\nfee of $650,000 in five installments. This contract was signed by Dr. Nguyen on a\n\nsignature line that identified him as “President” of PLTQ Lotus Group and by Yu\n\non a line that identified him as president of Peterson Group.\n\n      The next day, Yu and Dr. Nguyen signed a second development agreement\n\nfor the Royal Oaks project.     This contract was between PLTQ Lotus Group,\n\nidentified as “the ‘Client,’” and PGI, identified as “the ‘Developer.’” This five-\n\npage contract provided more detail on the duties of the developer, specifically\n\nstating that the developer would submit requests to the bank to receive funds from\n\nthe construction loan. This contract was executed on behalf of PLTQ Lotus Group\n\nby Dr. Nguyen, identified in the signature block as president of Cubo Group (the\n\ngeneral partner of PLTQ Lotus Group), and on behalf of PGI by Peterson I Realty\n\n                                          5\n\fGP, Inc. (the general partner of PGI). Yu signed for Peterson I Realty GP, Inc.,\n\nidentified as that entity’s president.\n\n      Yu began developing the Royal Oaks Shopping Center. By the summer of\n\n2004, he had become frustrated with both Dr. Nguyen’s unavailability and the\n\nRoyal Oaks project itself, which Yu felt was occupying too much of his time at the\n\nexpense of his own development projects.          In June 2004, the PLTQ-PGI\n\ndevelopment agreement was amended. The developer fee was increased to the\n\nlesser of $770,000 or 11% of the total project cost. The amendment also provided\n\nthat PLTQ would add Yu as an authorized signatory for the project’s account at\n\nMetro Bank, and it authorized Yu to pay reasonable and necessary development\n\ncosts from the account “including, without limitation, the Development Fee.” At\n\ntrial, Yu testified that he did not know why that provision was in the contract, and\n\nthat he never took advantage of it.\n\n      In July 2004, PLTQ entered into a contract with Atlantic Builder Company\n\nand an architect, Consolidated Architectural and Planning Service (“CAPS”), for\n\nconstruction of the shopping center. D. W. Tan is an architect, the president of\n\nCAPS, and the vice-president of Atlantic Builder. Tan submitted draw requests\n\ndirectly to Metro Bank to obtain money from Dr. Nguyen’s construction loan.\n\nWhen he received money from the bank, he would deliver it to Yu or his\n\nrepresentative, and Yu would give him checks for his fee and to pay the\n\n                                         6\n\fsubcontractors. Tan testified that it was his and Yu’s practice to inflate the amount\n\nof the draw requests above the actual construction costs. According to Tan, the\n\ntotal amount of money withdrawn from the construction loan was approximately\n\n$900,000 in excess of actual construction costs. Tan testified that at one point, Yu\n\nasked him to prepare a false change order to submit to the bank in order to obtain\n\nan additional $400,000 in financing. Although Tan knew the change order was\n\nfalse, he “reluctantly” prepared it anyway. Tan had no contact with Dr. Nguyen\n\nduring design and construction of the shopping center. After construction was\n\nfinished, Dr. Nguyen inquired about the use of the construction loan. Tan showed\n\nhim the accounting information he had and explained that he had submitted draws\n\nto the bank, within the amount of the bank loan, which exceeded the actual\n\nconstruction costs.\n\n      Though Dr. Nguyen would later contend that he was surprised by the\n\naccounting practices employed on this project, Yu testified that Dr. Nguyen wanted\n\nhim to take the development fee from the construction loan because he felt the\n\ndevelopment fee was part of the total cost of construction.        Dr. Nguyen also\n\ntestified that he wanted the developer’s fee included in the construction loan, but,\n\nafter signing the loan paperwork, he learned that Metro Bank would not permit\n\nthat. Because the bank did not want to include the developer’s fee in the cost of\n\nthe loan, Yu marked up the cost of construction to take the fee out of the bank loan\n\n                                         7\n\fanyway. But Yu also solicited and received payments directly from Dr. Nguyen\n\nduring the same time period.\n\n      On March 30, 2005, Yu sent Dr. Nguyen a letter on PGI letterhead\n\ninforming him of a $633,965 shortfall in funds to satisfy the construction costs. In\n\nthe letter, Yu reminded Dr. Nguyen of his financial obligations regarding the\n\nproject, stating, “An enormous amount of time and money has been spent to date in\n\nhopes of making this project a success, and you have made commitments to\n\nprospective tenants and contractors (including PGI Development Group) under\n\nvarious project-related leases and other contracts.” Dr. Nguyen wrote a note on the\n\nbottom of the letter agreeing to contribute an additional $600,000, in three\n\ninstallments: April 2005, midway through construction, and upon completion of\n\nconstruction.\n\n      The record also included copies of applications for payment submitted to\n\nMetro Bank on the project, and construction status reports with photographs. On\n\nJune 29, 2005, Dr. Nguyen and Yu both signed a document approving an\n\nadditional $400,000 in construction costs “based on Dr. Nguyen and Mr. Yu’s\n\nrequest of changes.”\n\n      By the end of 2005, the shell of the Royal Oaks Shopping Center was\n\ncompleted and ready for custom build-out by tenants who had been secured for the\n\nproperty. The tenants included restaurants, a coffee shop, and a cash-advance\n\n                                         8\n\fstorefront.   Jackie, who had been working as the property manager, was not\n\ncollecting the rent due under the leases. There were other problems. Some tenants\n\nhad financial problems, including bankruptcy, and their ability to pay the rent\n\nrequired by the leases became questionable. Construction defects became apparent\n\nas tenants readied their spaces, but rather than seeking to have the builder repair\n\nthe defects, Yu authorized the tenants to remedy the defects and charge the costs to\n\nPLTQ. To this end, Yu told Dr. Nguyen that another $1 million was required to\n\ncomplete the repairs and custom tenant build-outs.\n\n      In February 2006, Metro Bank sent Dr. Nguyen a letter informing him that\n\nhis “project costs will . . . overrun [the] loan balance by $295,391” as of the date of\n\nthe letter. The letter continued:\n\n      This is assuming that you can control your tenants’ build-out cost to\n      finish the project.\n\n      We think this is a critical situation on your project. Additional equity\n      injection is required from you to assure the project can be continued to\n      finish without interruption.\n\nBy this point, frustrated with delays, cost overruns, and lack of transparency as to\n\nhow his money was spent, Dr. Nguyen became more involved in the project. The\n\nday he received the letter from Metro Bank about the costs exceeding his loan,\n\nDr. Nguyen dismissed Jackie and sent Yu a letter addressed to “Peterson Group,\n\nInc.,” demanding an accounting of the project and seeking other information and\n\n\n\n                                          9\n\fdocumentation. In response, Yu resigned as project developer, but he demanded\n\npayment of the remaining portion of the developer’s fee.\n\n      Peterson Group and PGI sued PLTQ Lotus Group and Cubo Group\n\n(collectively, “PLTQ”) for breach of the PLTQ-PGI development agreement and\n\nbreach of the Stonegate contract. They sought attorney’s fees under Civil Practice\n\nand Remedies Code section 38.001 for both contract claims.\n\n      PLTQ answered and pleaded several affirmative defenses. PLTQ filed a\n\ncounterclaim and third-party petition against Yu and others who are not involved\n\nin this appeal. PLTQ alleged that Yu and Peterson Group were alter egos of each\n\nother. PLTQ sued Yu, Peterson Group, and PGI for fraud, specifically alleging\n\nthat Yu, on his own behalf and on behalf of Peterson Group and PGI, made\n\nmaterial misrepresentations “regarding the services he and his companies would\n\nprovide in developing the Royal Oaks Center.”              PLTQ alleged that Yu\n\nmisrepresented that he and his entities would develop the shopping center and\n\nperform the tasks enumerated in the development agreement.           PLTQ further\n\nalleged that Yu made misrepresentations as work on the shopping center\n\nprogressed, specifically in regard to monitoring the construction loan and using the\n\nfunds only for construction of the center. PLTQ alleged that Yu “intentionally\n\ntook draws against the construction loan for unauthorized expenses not related to\n\nRoyal Oaks,” and that he “knew and intended that PLTQ rely upon his\n\n                                        10\n\frepresentations of honesty and trustworthiness and PLTQ did rely upon same,”\n\ncausing it to suffer “financial damage as a result of Yu’s treachery.” PLTQ also\n\npleaded a cause of action for breach of the development agreement, saying that it\n\nset out the duties of Yu, Peterson Group, and PGI, which each failed to perform.\n\nPLTQ also sued Peterson I Realty GP, Inc., the general partner of PGI, but it later\n\ndropped this party from its pleadings. PLTQ sought a declaratory judgment that\n\nYu, Peterson Group, and PGI were all alter egos of each other.\n\n      Throughout the litigation, PLTQ raised the issue of which person or entity—\n\nPeterson Group, Yu, or PGI—had actually done the work on the Royal Oaks\n\nproject.   For example, some documents showed the involvement of Peterson\n\nGroup, such as a document prepared by a commercial broker and addressed to\n\nPeterson Group. Dr. Nguyen wrote checks both to “Peterson Group” and directly\n\nto Yu, including one to Yu dated April 4, 2005 for $100,000 with a notation\n\nreading, “Developmt Fee 2nd Draw.” Other parties, such as Tan, believed they\n\nwere working with Peterson Group. At trial, Yu explained that he was the sole\n\nemployee of Peterson Group and of PGI, and because he does not wear a uniform,\n\nwhen he is on a worksite there is no way for others to determine if he is working\n\nfor Peterson Group or for PGI. Perhaps most importantly to PLTQ, the PLTQ-PGI\n\ncontract included a provision limiting the developer’s liability solely to the PGI\n\nentity, yet PGI had no assets—not even a bank account. When asked about this at\n\n                                        11\n\ftrial, Yu said that he did not believe PGI needed a bank account: “[S]ince I do not\n\nsign on Dr. Nguyen’s checking account, I do not touch his money, I do not touch\n\nhis loan money from Metro Bank, so, only a few checks that was going to pay\n\nfrom Dr. Nguyen to myself for a development fee.”\n\n       Dr. Nguyen testified about his damages. He disagreed with Yu’s method of\n\ncalculating the developer’s fee based on the amendment providing that he earn\n\n11% of the project cost. Dr. Nguyen disagreed that items such as interest on the\n\nloan should be included in the cost that formed the basis for Yu’s 11% fee because\n\ndoing so created an incentive for delay.       Likewise Dr. Nguyen thought that\n\nincluding excessive tenant build-out costs, which were approved by Yu, created a\n\ndisincentive for managing costs because high tenant build-out costs would increase\n\nthe developer’s fee. However, Dr. Nguyen conceded that at the time he entered\n\ninto the PLTQ-PGI contract and its amendment, he understood that the developer’s\n\nfee would be based on project costs including tenant build-out costs.\n\n       Dr. Nguyen testified that he was not seeking a total refund of the developer’s\n\nfee.   He testified that Yu accomplished some of the project’s goals, and he\n\nindicated that he was satisfied with some of the tenants that Yu secured for the\n\nproject. However, Dr. Nguyen testified that he was seeking a reimbursement of\n\nthe “extra” money Yu charged. Dr. Nguyen said, “Whatever he didn’t earn he\n\nshould return to me.” Dr. Nguyen testified that he was seeking the following other\n\n                                         12\n\felements of damages in addition to the excessive developer’s fee: (1) lost rent\n\nmoney; (2) lost tenant build-out money; (3) additional cash that he was required to\n\nprovide either to satisfy bank loan requirements or project obligations; (4) the cost\n\nof employing a new contractor to repair construction defects; (5) commissions for\n\nleases on businesses that never opened or that closed shortly after opening; and\n\n(6) payment of a lien on behalf of an anticipated tenant that filed for bankruptcy.\n\nHe also testified that he borrowed against his life insurance and withdrew money\n\nfrom his retirement account to pay for project expenses, but he was unable to\n\nquantify a value of money lost by taking those actions.\n\n      The jury found that PLTQ failed to comply with the Stonegate real estate\n\ncontract, but that its failure to comply was excused because “a different\n\nperformance was accepted as full satisfaction of performance of the original\n\nobligations of the agreement” and because compliance was waived by Peterson\n\nGroup. Thus, the jury did not award Peterson Group damages on its breach of\n\ncontract claim.\n\n      The jury found that Yu and Peterson Group committed fraud against PLTQ,\n\nattributing 5% of the fraud to Yu and 95% of the fraud to Peterson Group. The\n\njury was instructed to consider only one element of damages as to fraud, which\n\nwas: “Money used without PLTQ’s knowledge or consent and not for PLTQ’s\n\n\n\n\n                                         13\n\fdirect or indirect benefit.” The jury awarded PLTQ Lotus Group $184,000 for\n\nfraud.\n\n         The jury also found that PGI failed to comply with the Royal Oaks\n\ndevelopment agreement. The question for contract damages was granulated. The\n\njury awarded PLTQ the following sums as damages for PGI’s breach of contract:\n\n(1) $158,000 for “[m]oney paid to tenants for build-outs in excess of what was\n\nagreed to under their leases or otherwise agreed to by PLTQ”; (2) $53,000 for\n\n“[m]oney PLTQ paid to tenant subcontractors as a result of workman liens or\n\nthreatened liens”; (3) $48,000 for “[t]he reasonable and necessary cost to repair\n\n[construction] work . . . at the Royal Oaks Shopping Center”; and (4) $136,021 for\n\n“[l]oss of tenant rent in the past that it would have received had the agreement been\n\nperformed.” The jury awarded no damages on the following elements of damages:\n\n(1) “[b]roker fees paid by PLTQ in excess of fees that would have been paid had\n\nthe agreement been performed”; (2) loan interest paid by PLTQ Lotus Group in\n\nexcess of interest that would have been paid had the agreement been performed;\n\n(3) loss of tenant rent in the future that it would receive had the agreement been\n\nperformed; and (4) money withdrawn from the Royal Oaks construction loan that\n\nPLTQ would not have had to pay had the agreement been performed.\n\n         After the verdict, the court ruled as a matter of law that Peterson Group and\n\nYu were alter egos of PGI. The court rendered judgment on the verdict as to the\n\n                                           14\n\ffraud cause of action in favor of PLTQ and against Peterson Group and Yu. As to\n\nthe breach of contract claim, the court rendered judgment on the verdict in favor of\n\nPLTQ and against PGI, Peterson Group, and Yu. Peterson Group, Yu, and PGI\n\nappealed.\n\n                                          Analysis\n\n    I.      Alter ego\n\n         In their first issue, the appellants argue that the trial court erred by ruling that\n\nPeterson Group and Yu were liable for breach of the development agreement\n\nbecause they were alter egos of PGI. No alter-ego question was presented to the\n\njury. Instead, the trial court granted a directed verdict that PGI was the alter ego of\n\nboth Peterson Group and Yu. It made no alter-ego findings involving PGI’s\n\ngeneral partner, Peterson I Realty GP, Inc.\n\n         Appellants argue that the alter-ego ruling was in error because the alter-ego\n\ntheory of veil-piercing simply does not apply to limited partnerships. Indeed,\n\nTexas courts have uniformly declined to apply the alter-ego theory to pierce a\n\nlimited partnership’s “veil” to impose the entity’s liabilities on a limited partner. 1\n\n\n1\n         See Seidler v.

Id. at *9.\n\nSimilarly, in Solutioneers Consulting, the Fourteenth Court of Appeals recited the\n\nblack-letter law on piercing the corporate veil, and then concluded that there was\n\nno evidence to support the jury’s verdict that Solutioneers Consulting was the alter\n\nego of its owner. Solutioneers Consulting, 237 S.W.3d at 387–88. Thus, neither\n\n                                         19\n\fcase actually applied the alter-ego theory or any other veil-piercing theory to\n\nsubject a limited partner to the liability of a limited partnership.\n\n      The significance of the trial court’s alter-ego finding in this case is that it is\n\nthe basis for holding Peterson Group and Yu liable for PGI’s breach of the\n\ndevelopment agreement. But that agreement expressly limited the developer’s\n\nliability to the “assets” of the PGI entity. Moreover, the undisputed fact is that\n\nPLTQ Lotus Group’s sole contractual counterparty to that agreement was PGI\n\nitself, expressly identified in the agreement’s signature block as a limited\n\npartnership. The agreement was executed on behalf of PGI by Peterson I Realty\n\nGP, Inc., identified as PGI’s general partner, and it was signed on behalf of that\n\nentity by Yu, identified as Peterson I Realty GP’s president.\n\n      PLTQ alleged in its pleadings that Peterson Group and Yu were alter egos of\n\nPGI, a limited partnership. Although PLTQ initially sued PGI’s general partner, it\n\nlater nonsuited the general partner and chose to proceed solely against Peterson\n\nGroup, Yu, and PGI. At oral argument, counsel for PLTQ explained that because\n\nthe general partner is liable for the debts of the partnership, a judgment against PGI\n\nwould be sufficient to impose liability on Peterson I Realty GP, Inc. However, the\n\nrelief sought by PLTQ is not the imposition of liability on Peterson I Realty GP,\n\nInc.; it is, instead, seeking to impose liability on Peterson Group and Yu for the\n\nobligations of PGI.\n\n                                           20\n\f      The veil-piercing doctrine as applied to corporate alter egos has never been\n\nindiscriminately applied to impute liability to arguably responsible bystanders—it\n\nis applied to the owners and operators of the firm, including “shareholders,\n\nofficers, and directors” who otherwise would ordinarily be insulated from liability\n\nfor corporate obligations.

PLTQ abandoned its pleading which sought to pierce\n\nthe corporate veil of Peterson I Realty GP, Inc., and it never litigated the question\n\nof whether Peterson Group and Yu were alter egos of the general partner. Nor did\n\nPLTQ plead or prove that Peterson Group was a limited partner of PGI, such that it\n\ncould be held liable for PGI’s obligations, either pursuant to section 153.102 of the\n\nBusiness Organizations Code or by equitable veil-piercing. Finally, PLTQ has not\n\nasserted in the trial court or on appeal that Yu, as limited partner, can be held liable\n\nfor the limited partnership’s liabilities pursuant to section 153.102, and in\n\nparticular there has been no allegation or proof that PLTQ reasonably believed that\n\n\n\n6\n      Contrary to the dissent’s suggestion, application of the veil-piercing doctrine\n      in this case also should not hinge on the unsupported speculation that PGI\n      failed to comply with some regulatory formality.

Cf. Shook, 368 S.W.3d at 621 (emphasizing the importance of\n\ndeferring to legislative standards governing veil piercing of corporations). 8\n\n      We conclude that the trial court erred by finding that Peterson Group and Yu\n\nare the alter egos of PGI. We sustain the first issue, and we hold that Peterson\n\nGroup and Yu are not liable for PGI’s breach of the development contract.\n\n\n\n\n7\n      See TEX. BUS. ORGS. CODE § 153.102(b) (“If the limited partner participates\n      in the control of the business, the limited partner is liable only to a person\n      who transacts business with the limited partnership reasonably believing,\n      based on the limited partner’s conduct, that the limited partner is a general\n      partner.”). Although our dissenting colleague would hold Yu liable under\n      section 153.102(b) purely “[b]ecause of the control he exercised over the\n      activities of PGI,” apparently without regard for the substantial scope of\n      activities covered by the safe harbor of section 153.103, it is nevertheless\n      plain that mere control is not sufficient—a claimant must also demonstrate a\n      reasonable belief, based on the limited partner’s own conduct, that the\n      limited partner is a general partner.\n8\n      Even the bankruptcy court in Adelphia, which recognized a theoretical\n      possibility of equitable veil-piercing of limited partnerships under Delaware\n      law, warned that “veil piercing and other equitable remedies cannot be\n      utilized as an ‘end run’ around the proof required in Section 17–303 [the\n      Delaware counterpart to TEX.

Attorney’s fees\n\n      At trial, the parties stipulated to lump-sum attorney’s fees, which were not\n\nsegregated by cause of action, and the trial court awarded PLTQ the stipulated\n\namount of attorney’s fees. In their second issue, the appellants contend that the\n\ntrial court erred by ruling that Peterson Group and Yu were responsible for\n\nattorney’s fees. Specifically, the appellants argue that Peterson Group and Yu\n\ncannot be held liable as alter egos of PGI for attorney’s fees awarded on PLTQ’s\n\ncause of action for breach of the development agreement. Among other things,\n\nthey argue that PLTQ is not entitled to recover contractual attorney’s fees when it\n\npleaded only for statutory attorney’s fees.\n\n      First, having held that Peterson Group and Yu are not alter egos of PGI, we\n\nconclude that they cannot be held liable for the attorney’s fees awarded on PLTQ’s\n\ncause of action for breach of the PLTQ-PGI Royal Oaks development agreement.\n\n      Nevertheless, PLTQ contends that it is entitled to recover attorney’s fees\n\nfrom Peterson Group both because of a trial stipulation and under the Stonegate\n\ncontract. This contract included a provision for awarding attorney’s fees in a suit\n\nto enforce or interpret the contract:\n\n            11.15. Attorney’s Fees. If any action at law or in equity\n      becomes necessary to enforce or interpret any term, provision or\n      condition of this Contract, the prevailing party shall be entitled to\n      recover the reasonable attorney’s fees, costs, and necessary\n      disbursements (including, but not limited to, expert witness fees and\n\n                                         24\n\f       deposition costs) incurred or made by it in addition to any other relief\n       to which it may become entitled.\n\nPLTQ argues that all of appellants’ arguments are really about failure to segregate.\n\nWe disagree.      Peterson Group and Yu have advanced alternative arguments,\n\nincluding the failure to segregate and the argument that they are not liable for\n\nattorney’s fees at all.\n\n       “As a general rule, litigants in Texas are responsible for their own attorney’s\n\nfees and expenses in litigation.” Ashford Partners, Ltd. v.

See Intercontinental Grp.

It did not plead\n\nfor attorney’s fees under the “prevailing party” provision of the Stonegate contract.\n\nPLTQ first raised this theory in a post-trial motion to amend its pleadings.\n\nAppellants opposed this motion on the grounds that it would cause them prejudice\n\nbecause PLTQ had consistently denied the existence of that contract. In response,\n\nPLTQ argued that it was sufficient that it had pleaded for attorney’s fees based on\n\nfrivolity and harassment, as opposed to the contractual provision. However, the\n\nappellate record does not include any amended PLTQ pleading actually alleging\n\nentitlement to recovery of attorney’s fees under the Stonegate contract. Moreover,\n\nalthough the jury found in favor of PLTQ on its affirmative defense, because\n\nPLTQ did not recover damages related to the Stonegate contract, it is not entitled\n\nto attorney’s fees under Chapter 38 on the basis of its favorable jury finding on the\n\nStonegate contract.

App.—Fort Worth 2012, pet. denied)\n\n(holding that economic loss rule did not bar recovery for statutory fraud).\n\n      Here, PLTQ’s fraud claim is based on material misrepresentations made by\n\nPGI, Peterson Group, and Yu. While the development agreement enumerated the\n\nvarious tasks that Yu and his entities would perform in furtherance of developing\n\nRoyal Oaks, PLTQ’s fraud claim was not based on a failure to accomplish these\n\ntasks or negligence in carrying them out. Rather, PLTQ’s fraud claim was based\n\non the separate harm it suffered as a result of Yu’s misrepresentations and acts of\n\n                                         30\n\fdishonesty which did not further the goal of developing the Royal Oaks Shopping\n\nCenter. For example, PLTQ contends that “Peterson covertly spearheaded the theft\n\nof the funds” by encouraging Atlantic Builders and Tan to submit false bank draws\n\non PLTQ’s loan account. These funds were not all expended on Royal Oaks, such\n\nthat PLTQ would obtain a benefit as contemplated by the development agreement.\n\nTo the contrary, the evidence showed that Yu orchestrated withdrawals from the\n\nconstruction loan which were then directed away from the Royal Oaks project,\n\nincluding $124,442.63 diverted to Yu’s development at Stonegate and $60,000\n\npaid to Peterson for undocumented expenses related to phantom tenants. In the\n\nfraud damages question, the jury was asked to quantify the amount of money “used\n\nwithout PLTQ’s knowledge or consent and not for PLTQ’s direct or indirect\n\nbenefit,” and in response to this question the jury found damages in the amount of\n\n$184,000.9\n\n      The jury agreed with PLTQ and found that Peterson and Yu committed\n\nfraud. Peterson and Yu argue that their actions amount only to a breach of the\n\nparties’ agreement and are not fraudulent. For its breach of contract claim, PLTQ\n\n\n9\n      Any construction loan funds spent on Royal Oaks would have been used for\n      the benefit of PLTQ, so contrary to the dissent’s reasoning, this jury finding\n      is perfectly consistent with the separate finding that no contract damages—\n      defined as damages “that resulted from PGI Development’s failure to\n      comply with the Royal Oaks Development Agreement”—resulted from\n      “[m]oney withdrawn from the Royal Oaks construction loan that PLTQ\n      would not have had to pay had the agreement been performed.”\n                                        31\n\fsought to recover sums of money paid toward the development of the Royal Oaks\n\nShopping Center that it would not have had to pay if the agreement had been\n\nperformed, such as excess tenant build-out costs, money paid to tenant\n\nsubcontractors to satisfy workman liens or avoid the imposition of liens, and the\n\nreasonable and necessary costs to repair work performed by Atlantic. In addition\n\nPLTQ sought recovery of lost rent that it alleges it would have collected had the\n\nagreement been performed. These are consequential damages arising from PGI’s\n\nfailure to perform as it was obligated under the development agreement.\n\n      However the duty not to commit fraud is different from and independent of\n\nthe duty to comply with the terms of a contract. See Formosa Plastics Corp., 960\n\nS.W.2d at 47–48. And as to its claim for fraud, PLTQ sought to recover for a\n\ncategory of damages that was distinctly different from the contract damages:\n\n“[m]oney used without [its] knowledge or consent and not for [its] direct or\n\nindirect benefit.” The nature of the fraud injury is money that PLTQ lost as a\n\nresult of Yu’s deceitful actions, not simply economic loss related to the shopping\n\ncenter itself, i.e., the subject matter of the contract. See Flanagan Shipping, 403\n\nS.W.3d at 365. Thus, the alleged fraud injury did not arise from the contract, and\n\nthe economic loss rule does not apply. See id.; Formosa Plastics, 960 S.W.2d at\n\n47; see also Sharyland Water Supply, 354 S.W.3d at 418 (noting economic losses\n\n\n\n\n                                        32\n\fare recoverable for breach of fiduciary duty). Therefore, the trial court did not err\n\nin denying appellants’ motion for judgment n.o.v. We overrule the third issue.\n\n   IV.   Election of remedies\n\n      In their fourth issue, appellants argue that if PLTQ’s fraud claim is not\n\nbarred by the economic loss rule, then PLTQ should have been required to elect a\n\nremedy as between the tort and fraud damages awarded by the jury.\n\n      A party is entitled to sue and seek damages on alternative theories, but it is\n\nnot entitled to a double recovery.

Because the jury awarded PLTQ separate\n\nand distinct damages for separate and distinct injuries for fraud and breach of\n\ncontract, no election of remedies is required, and the jury’s verdict awarding\n\ndamages for both may be upheld. See Madison, 241 S.W.3d at 158; Birchfield,\n\n747 S.W.2d at 367. We overrule this issue.\n\n   V.      Lost tenant rent\n\n        In their fifth issue, appellants argue that the trial court erred by not granting\n\ntheir motion for j.n.o.v. as to $136,021 of the jury’s award of contract damages\n\nbecause lost tenant rent was too speculative. The appellants do not argue that lost\n\nrents were not available as damages for breach of the development agreement, and\n\nfor purposes of this issue we assume that they were. Instead, in their motion for\n\nj.n.o.v., they argued that lost tenant rent was an inappropriately speculative\n\nmeasure of damages because Royal Oaks was a new enterprise and had no\n\n                                           34\n\festablished track record. Appellants thus contend that there was no evidence from\n\nwhich the lost profits could be estimated.\n\n      To recover damages for breach of contract, a plaintiff must show that he\n\nsuffered a pecuniary loss as a result of the breach.

Lost profits cannot be based on pure speculation or wishful\n\nthinking. Tex. Instruments, 877 S.W.2d at 279. The Supreme Court of Texas has\n\nstated:\n\n      Profits which are largely speculative, as from an activity dependent on\n      uncertain or changing market conditions, or on chancy business\n      opportunities, or on promotion of untested products or entry into\n      unknown or unviable markets, or on the success of a new and\n      unproven enterprise, cannot be recovered. Factors like these and\n      others which make a business venture risky in prospect preclude\n      recovery of lost profits in retrospect. . . . The mere hope for success of\n      an untried enterprise, even when that hope is realistic, is not enough\n      for recovery of lost profits.\n\nId. at 279–80.\n\n      However, the fact that a business is new does not absolutely preclude\n\nrecovery of lost profits. See id. at 280; Hernandez v.

App.—Dallas 2011, pet. denied).               Rather,\n\n“[w]hen there are firmer reasons to expect a business to yield a profit, the\n\nenterprise is not prohibited from recovering merely because it is new.” Tex.\n\n                                               36\n\fInstruments, 877 S.W.2d at 280. Thus, in the case of an untested business seeking\n\nlost-profits damages, the inquiry should focus on the experience of the people\n\ninvolved in the enterprise, the nature of the business activity, and the relevant\n\nmarket. Id.\n\n      Under the development agreement, the developer was required to oversee\n\nleasing of the project. PLTQ contended that the tenants that Yu found for the\n\nshopping center were unable to meet their obligations and Yu’s failure to find\n\ntenants who were able to pay the rent was a breach of contract. Dr. Nguyen\n\nsecured replacement tenants, and the old and new leases were introduced into\n\nevidence at trial without objection.\n\n      PLTQ sought lost tenant rents based on the difference between the rents in\n\nthe leases secured by Yu and Peterson Group and those for the replacement\n\ntenants. There is no suggestion that the replacement leases were unprofitable or\n\nthat they resulted in increased expenses, so the difference in the rent between the\n\noriginal leases and the replacement leases corresponds to lost profit.\n\n      Although PLTQ was new to the real estate business, Yu and Peterson Group\n\nwere not. Contrary to the appellants’ arguments, the jury had the actual leases\n\nfrom the tenants that Yu secured as a basis from which it could assess lost tenant\n\nrent damages. In this case, the party responsible for overseeing the leases had\n\nexperience in the relevant market, which was not an untested business. Rather, it\n\n                                         37\n\fwas the leasing of commercial real estate in a strip mall. The relevant market\n\nincluded restaurants and businesses providing goods and services. Notably, the\n\nintroduction of the leases themselves provided evidence from which the jury could\n\nestimate lost tenant rents without speculation. Accordingly, we conclude that the\n\nlost tenant rents were not too speculative to be awarded, and we hold that the trial\n\ncourt did not err in denying the motion for judgment n.o.v. on this ground. We\n\noverrule this issue.\n\n                                   Conclusion\n\n      Solely with respect to Peterson Group and Yu, we reverse the judgment as to\n\nbreach of the development agreement, including attorney’s fees.        In all other\n\nrespects we affirm. We remand this case to the trial court for calculation of pre-\n\nand post-judgment interest and for further proceedings in accordance with this\n\nopinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                             Michael Massengale\n                                             Justice\n\nPanel consists of Justices Keyes, Higley, and Massengale.\n\nJustice Keyes, dissenting.\n\n\n\n\n                                        38\n\f</pre>",
