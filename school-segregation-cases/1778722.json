We hold that adults with mental  disabilities\nhave the same general duty of care toward others as those without.   But  we\nconclude that  the  relationship  between  the  parties  and  public  policy\nconsiderations here are such that Rusk had no such duty to Creasy.\n\n\n\n\n\n            Background\n\n      In July, 1992,  Lloyd  Rusk=s  wife  admitted  Rusk  to  the  Brethren\nHealthcare  Center  (ABHC@)  because  he  suffered  from  memory  loss   and\nconfusion and Rusk=s wife was  unable  to  care  for  him.   Rusk=s  primary\ndiagnosis was Alzheimer=s disease.  Over the course of three years  at  BHC,\nRusk   experienced   periods   of   anxiousness,   confusion,    depression,\ndisorientation, and agitation.   Rusk  often  resisted  when  staff  members\nattempted to remove him from prohibited areas of the facility.   On  several\noccasions, Rusk was belligerent with both staff  and  other  residents.   In\nparticular, Rusk was often combative, agitated,  and  aggressive  and  would\nhit staff members when they tried to care for him.\n\n\n      BHC had employed Creasy as a certified nursing assistant for nearly 20\nmonths when the  incident  at  issue  occurred.   Creasy=s  responsibilities\nincluded caring for  Rusk  and  other  patients  with  Alzheimer=s  disease.\nCreasy did not have specialized training on how  to  care  for  people  with\nAlzheimer=s disease, but she did attend a  short  BHC  presentation  on  the\npathological  effects  of  Alzheimer=s.   Residents  with  Alzheimer=s   had\nbruised Creasy during the course of her work for BHC, and Creasy  knew  that\nRusk had Alzheimer=s disease.\n      On May 16, 1995, Creasy and another certified nursing assistant, Linda\nDavis, were  working  through  their  routine  of  putting  Rusk  and  other\nresidents to bed.  Creasy  knew  that  Rusk  had  been  Avery  agitated  and\ncombative that evening.@  (R. at 228.)  By Creasy=s account:\n      [Davis] was helping me put Mr. Rusk  to  bed.   She  was  holding  his\n      wrists to keep him from hitting us and I was trying to get his legs to\n      put him to bed.  He was hitting and kicking wildly.  During this time,\n      he kicked me several times in my left knee and  hip  area.   My  lower\n      back popped and I yelled out with pain from my  lower  back  and  left\n      knee.\n\n(Id.)\n\n\n\n      Creasy filed a civil negligence suit against  Rusk,  seeking  monetary\ndamages for the injuries she suffered as a result of Rusk=s  conduct.   Rusk\nmoved for summary judgment and the trial court granted his  motion.   Creasy\nappealed.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding Athat  a  person=s  mental\ncapacity, whether that person is a child  or  an  adult,  must  be  factored\n[into] the determination of whether a legal duty exists,@  Creasy  v.  Rusk,\n696 N.E.2d 442, 446 (Ind. Ct. App.  1998),  and  that  a  genuine  issue  of\nmaterial fact existed as to the level of Rusk=s mental capacity, see id.  at\n448.\n\n\n\n\n                                 Discussion\n\n\n      This case requires us to decide  two  distinct  questions  of  Indiana\ncommon law:\n\n      (1)     Whether the general duty of  care  imposed  upon  adults  with\nmental  disabilities  is  the  same  as  that  for  adults  without   mental\ndisabilities?\n\n      (2)      Whether the circumstances of Rusk=s case are  such  that  the\ngeneral duty of care imposed upon adults with mental disabilities should  be\nimposed upon him?\n\n                                      I\n\n                                      A\n\n\n      In many, if not most, jurisdictions, the general duty of care  imposed\non adults with mental disabilities is the same as that  for  adults  without\nmental disabilities.  See Restatement (Second) of Torts  '  283B  (1965).[1]\nAdults with mental disabilities are held to the same  standard  of  care  as\nthat of a reasonable person under the same circumstances without  regard  to\nthe alleged tortfeasor=s capacity to control or understand the  consequences\nof his or her actions.  See id.  We will discuss  the  Restatement  rule  in\ngreater detail in Part I-C.\n\n                                      B\n\n\n      Judge Kirsch, writing for the Court of Appeals in this case, found\nthat Indiana law does not follow the Restatement rule.  The Court of\nAppeals held Athat a person=s mental capacity, whether that person is a\nchild or an adult, must be factored [into] the determination of whether a\nlegal duty exists.@  Creasy v. Rusk, 696 N.E.2d 442, 446 (Ind. Ct. App.\n1998).[2]  We believe that the Court of Appeals accurately stated Indiana\nlaw but that the law is in need of revision.\n\n\n      With respect to children, Indiana has incorporated the essence of  the\nRestatement standard for determining the liability  of  children  for  their\nalleged tortious acts.  The Restatement standard of conduct for a  child  is\nAthat of a reasonable person  of  like  age,  intelligence,  and  experience\nunder like circumstances.@  Restatement (Second)  of  Torts  '  283A  (1965)\n(hereinafter, “Restatement rule”).   Indiana  reformulates  the  Restatement\nrule into a three-tiered analysis:\n\n      [C]hildren under the age of 7 years are conclusively  presumed  to  be\n      incapable of being contributorily negligent, from 7 to 14 a rebuttable\n      presumption exists they may be guilty thereof,  and  over  14,  absent\n      special  circumstances,  they  are  chargeable  with  exercising   the\n      standard of care of an adult.\n\nBailey v. Martz, 488 N.E.2d 716, 721 (Ind. Ct. App. 1986) (citing  Smith  v.\nDiamond,  421  N.E.2d  1172,  1177-79  (Ind.  Ct.  App.   1981)),   transfer\ndenied.[3]  In the age seven  to  fourteen  category,  Indiana  applies  the\nRestatement standard and ascertains whether the  child  exercised  the  care\nunder the circumstances of a child of like  age,  knowledge,  judgment,  and\nexperience.  See id.\n\n      Consistent with recognizing a rule that holds a child to a standard of\ncare  proportionate  to  his  or  her  capacity,  see   Baltimore   &   Ohio\nSouthwestern R.R. Co. v. Hickman, 40 Ind. App. 315, 318, 81 N.E. 1086,  1087\n(1907), Judge Kirsch observed that Indiana has also indicated a  willingness\nto consider the mental capacity of an adult with  mental  disabilities  when\ndetermining negligence liability, Creasy, 696 N.E.2d at 445.  See  generally\nKroger Co. v. Haun, 177 Ind. App. 403, 413, 379 N.E.2d 1004, 1010-11  (1978)\n(A[A]bsent extenuating circumstances such as age or mental  incompetency,  .\n. . contributory negligence may be found either where plaintiff  has  actual\nknowledge of the danger, or, in the  exercise  of  reasonable  care,  should\nhave appreciated the danger.@); Hunsberger v. Wyman, 247 Ind. 369, 373,  216\nN.E.2d 345, 348 (1966) (AIn order for an act or an  omission  to  constitute\nnegligence, a person to be charged must have knowledge or notice  that  such\nan act or omission involved danger to another. . .  .   Where  there  is  no\nknowledge, actual or constructive, of danger or  peril  on  the  part  of  a\ndefendant, he cannot be charged with negligence.@);  Riesbeck  Drug  Co.  v.\nWray, 111 Ind. App. 467, 475, 39 N.E.2d  776,  779  (1942)  (AKnowledge  and\nappreciation of peril are essential  elements  of  contributory  negligence,\nand evidence is admissible to show a plaintiff=s  mental  condition  to  aid\nthe  jury  in  determining  whether  he  understood  and   appreciated   the\ndanger.@).[4]  Judge Kirsch reasons that  these  cases  either  rely  on  or\nadopt the authority which calls for special consideration  in  applying  the\nreasonable person standard under extenuating circumstances  where  a  person\nA>unable to apprehend apparent danger and to avoid exposure to it cannot  be\nsaid to be guilty of  negligence.=@  Creasy,  696  N.E.2d  at  445  (quoting\nRiesbeck, 111 Ind. App. at 475, 39 N.E.2d at 779  (citing  in  turn  38  Am.\nJur., Negligence ' 201, at  882)).  Based on this authority,  the  Court  of\nAppeals held that the rule in Indiana is Athat a person=s  mental  capacity,\nwhether that person is a child or an adult,  must  be  factored  [into]  the\ndetermination of whether a legal duty exists.@  Creasy, 696 N.E.2d at 446.\n\n            C\n\n\n      As  briefly  noted  in  Part  I-A,  the  generally  accepted  rule  in\njurisdictions other than Indiana is that mental disability does  not  excuse\na person from liability for Aconduct which does not conform to the  standard\nof a reasonable man under like circumstances.@[5]  Restatement  (Second)  of\nTorts  ' 283B; accord Restatement (Third) of Torts ' 9(c) (Discussion  Draft\nApr. 5, 1999)  (AUnless  the  actor  is  a  child,  the  actor=s  mental  or\nemotional disability is not considered in  determining  whether  conduct  is\nnegligent.@).  People with mental disabilities are commonly held liable  for\ntheir intentional and negligent torts.  No allowance is  made  for  lack  of\nintelligence,  ignorance,  excitability,  or  proneness  to  accident.   See\nRestatement (Second) of Torts ' 283B cmt. c.\n\n      Legal scholars and authorities recognize that  it  is  Aimpossible  to\nascribe either the volition implicit in an intentional tort,  the  departure\nfrom the standard of a >reasonable= person which defines an act of  ordinary\nnegligence, or indeed any concept of >fault= at all to one who . . .  is  by\ndefinition unable to control his [or her] own actions through  any  exercise\nof reason.@  Anicet v. Gant, 580 So.2d 273, 275 (Fla. Dist. Ct.  App.  1991)\n(citations omitted).  Rather,  the  Restatement  rule  holding  people  with\nmental disabilities liable for their torts was founded  upon  public  policy\nconsiderations.\n\n      The public policy reasons most often  cited  for  holding  individuals\nwith mental disabilities to a standard  of  reasonable  care  in  negligence\nclaims include the following.\n            (1) Allocates losses between two innocent parties to the one who\n      caused or occasioned the loss.  See, e.g., Gould  v.  American  Family\n      Mut. Ins., 543 N.W.2d 282, 286 (Wis. 1996).  Under this rationale, the\n      one who experienced the loss or injury as a result of the conduct of a\n      person with a mental disability is presumed not to have assumed  risks\n      or to have been contributorily negligent with respect to the cause  of\n      the injury.  This policy is also intended to  protect  even  negligent\n      third parties from bearing  excessive  liabilities.   See  Restatement\n      (Third) of Torts ' 9 cmt. e (Discussion Draft Apr. 5, 1999).\n\n            (2) Provides incentive to  those  responsible  for  people  with\n      disabilities and interested in  their  estates  to  prevent  harm  and\n      Arestrain@ those who are potentially dangerous.  See, e.g., Gould, 543\n      N.W.2d at 287.\n\n            (3) Removes inducements for alleged tortfeasors to fake a mental\n      disability  in  order  to  escape  liability.   See,  e.g.,  id.   The\n      Restatement mentions the ease with  which  mental  disability  can  be\n      feigned  as  one  possible  basis  for  this  policy   concern.    See\n      Restatement (Second) of Torts ' 283B cmt. b(2).\n\n            (4) Avoids administrative problems involved in courts and juries\n      attempting to identify and  assess  the  significance  of  an  actor=s\n      disability.  See id. at cmts. b(1) & b(2).   As a practical matter, it\n      is arguably too difficult to account for  or  draw  any  Asatisfactory\n      line between mental deficiency and those  variations  of  temperament,\n      intellect, and emotional balance.@  Id. at cmt. b(1).\n\n            (5) Forces persons with disabilities to pay for the damage  they\n      do if they Aare to  live  in  the  world.@  Id.  at  cmt.  b(3).   The\n      Restatement adds that it is better that the assets, if any, of the one\n      with the mental deficiency be used  Ato  compensate  innocent  victims\n      than that [the assets] remain in  their  hands.@   Id.   A  discussion\n      draft for the Restatement  (Third)  of  Torts  rephrases  this  policy\n      rationale and concludes:  A[I]f a person is suffering  from  a  mental\n      disorder so serious as to make it likely that the person  will  engage\n      in substandard conduct that threatens the safety of others, there  can\n      be doubts as to whether this person should be allowed to engage in the\n      normal range of society=s activities; given  these  doubts,  there  is\n      nothing especially harsh in at least holding  the  person  responsible\n      for  the  harms  the  person  may  cause  by   substandard   conduct.@\n      Restatement (Third) of Torts ' 9 cmt. e  (Discussion  Draft  April  5,\n      1999).[6]\n\n                                      D\n\n\n      To assist in deciding  whether  Indiana  should  adopt  the  generally\naccepted rule, we turn to an examination of contemporary  public  policy  in\nIndiana as embodied in enactments of our state legislature.   See  Schornick\nv. Butler, 205 Ind. 304, 304, 185 N.E. 111, 112  (1933)  (stating  that  the\npublic  policy  of  Indiana  is  derived   from,   inter   alia,   statutory\nenactments), reh’g denied.\n      Since the 1970s,  Indiana  law  has  strongly  reflected  policies  to\ndeinstitutionalize people with disabilities  and  integrate  them  into  the\nleast restrictive environment.[7]  National policy changes have led the  way\nfor some of  Indiana=s  enactments  in  that  several  federal  acts  either\nguarantee the civil rights of people with disabilities  or  condition  state\naid upon state compliance with desegregation and  integrationist  practices.\nSee, e.g., Individuals with Disabilities Education Act,  20  U.S.C.  '  1400\net. seq. (1994) (requiring that children with disabilities  receive  a  free\nappropriate public education in the least restrictive environment in  states\nthat accept allocated funds) (originally enacted in 1975  as  the  Education\nfor All Handicapped Children Act, P.L. 94-142 (amending the state  education\ngrant program under the 1970 Education for the  Handicapped  Act,  P.L.  91-\n230; requiring states to provide a free appropriate public education to  all\nchildren  with  disabilities  in  order  to  receive  state  grant  funds));\nAmericans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C.

' 35.130(d) (1999)  (providing  that  a  public  entity\nshall administer services, programs, and activities in the  most  integrated\nsetting  appropriate  to   the   needs   of   qualified   individuals   with\ndisabilities);  Olmstead  v.  Zimring,  119  S.  Ct.   2176,   2185   (1999)\n(interpreting the Americans with Disabilities Act to find that  Aunjustified\nisolation  .  .  .  is  properly  regarded  as   discrimination   based   on\ndisability@); Fair  Housing  Act,  42  U.S.C.

For  example,\ncourts in  jurisdictions  that  apply  the  reasonable  person  standard  to\nindividuals with mental disabilities have uniformly  held  that  Alzheimer=s\npatients who have no capacity to control their conduct do not owe a duty  to\ntheir caregivers  to  refrain  from  violent  conduct  because  the  factual\ncircumstances  negate  the  policy  rationales  behind  the  presumption  of\nliability.  See Colman v. Notre Dame Convalescent Home, Inc., 968  F.  Supp.\n809 (D. Conn. 1997) (holding that while an adult  with  mental  disabilities\nis ordinarily responsible for injuries resulting from  negligence,  no  duty\narises between an institutionalized  patient  and  his  or  her  caregiver);\nGould v. American Family Mut. Ins. Co., 543 N.W.2d 282 (Wis. 1996)  (carving\nout an exception to  the  presumption  of  liability  for  institutionalized\nmentally disabled people  who  are  unable  to  control  or  appreciate  the\nconsequences of their conduct when they injure paid  caregivers  and  noting\nthat these circumstances negate the rationale  behind  the  presumption  and\nthat application of the presumption would place an  unreasonable  burden  on\npeople with  mental  disabilities  who  are  institutionalized);  Herrle  v.\nEstate of Marshall, 53 Cal.Rptr.2d 713  (Ct.  App.  1996)  (concluding  that\npublic policy precluded  imposition  of  liability  because  the  healthcare\nprovider, not the patient, is in the best position to protect  against  risk\nof injury to the service provider where the risk is  rooted  in  the  reason\nfor the treatment), review denied; Mujica v.  Turner,  582  So.2d  24  (Fla.\nDist. Ct. App. 1991) (holding nursing home patient with Alzheimer=s was  not\nliable for injury to a physical therapist), review denied; Anicet  v.

Jarvis, 575 N.E.2d at 995 (balancing three factors to  determine  whether\nan individual owes a duty to  another:  (1)  the  relationship  between  the\nparties; (2) the reasonable foreseeability of harm to  the  person  injured;\nand (3) public policy concerns).\n\n                                     B-1\n\n      Unlike the typical victim supporting the Restatement rationale, Creasy\nwas not a member of the public at large, unable to anticipate  or  safeguard\nagainst the harm she encountered.  Creasy knew of  Rusk=s  violent  history.\nShe could  have  changed  her  course  of  action  or  requested  additional\nassistance when she recognized Rusk=s state of mind on the evening when  she\nreceived  the  alleged  injury.   Rusk=s   inability   to   comprehend   the\ncircumstances of his relationship  with  Creasy  and  others  was  the  very\nreason Creasy was employed to support Rusk.  The nursing  home  and  Creasy,\nthrough the nursing home, were Aemployed to  encounter,  and  knowingly  did\nencounter, just the dangers which injured@ Creasy.  Id. at  276.   In  fact,\ncaregivers  and  their  employers  under  these  circumstances  are   better\npositioned to prevent caregiver injury and to protect  against  risks  faced\nas a result of job responsibilities.  In Indiana, the workers=  compensation\nsystem, not  the  tort  system,  exists  to  cover  such  employment-related\nlosses. To the extent that the workers= compensation  system  is  inadequate\nas  Creasy  asserts,  the  inadequacy  reflects  defects  in  the   workers=\ncompensation system and is not a ground for alternative recovery under  tort\nlaw.\n\n\n      An analogous situation arises in Indiana law under the fireman=s rule.\n  The  Afireman=s  rule  provides  that  fireman  [or  other  public  safety\nofficials] responding in emergencies are owed only the  duty  of  abstaining\nfrom positive wrongful acts.@  Heck v. Robey,  659  N.E.2d  498,  501  (Ind.\n1995); see also Sam v. Wesley, 647 N.E.2d 382, 384  (Ind.  Ct.  App.  1995).\nPublic  safety  officials  and  caregivers  such  as  Creasy  are  similarly\nsituated in that they  are  Aspecifically  hired  to  encounter  and  combat\nparticular dangers,@ and by  accepting  such  employment  assume  the  risks\nassociated with their respective occupations.[10]   Anicet,  580  So..2d  at\n276.\n\n                                     B-2\n\n      Public Policy Concerns.  The first rationale  behind  the  Restatement\nrule justifies imposing a duty on  a  defendant  with  a  mental  disability\nwhere it seems unfair to force a plaintiff who did  not  contribute  to  the\ncause of his or her injury to bear the cost of  that  injury.   This  policy\nconcern overlaps with  the  relationship  analysis  set  forth  supra.   The\nnature of Creasy and Rusk=s relationship was  such  that  Creasy  cannot  be\nApresumed not to have assumed risks . . . with respect to the cause  of  the\ninjury.@   See Rationale (1), supra, Part I-C.  Therefore, imposing  a  duty\non Rusk in this circumstance is  not  justified  by  the  first  Restatement\npolicy rationale.\n\n      The second Restatement policy  rationale  creates  an  inducement  for\nthose responsible for a person with a mental disability to prevent  harm  to\nothers.  By placing Rusk in a nursing home, we presume Rusk=s  wife  made  a\ndifficult decision based on her desire to prevent Rusk  from  being  violent\nand harming himself, herself, or others.  Without endorsing  the  incentives\nfor confinement arguably fostered by the  Restatement  rationale,  we  agree\nwith the conclusion set forth by the Wisconsin Supreme Court in  Gould  that\na family member  who  places  a  relative  in  a  long-term  care  facility,\ninstitution, nursing home, or similarly restrictive environment is  unlikely\nto  need  further  inducement  to  restrain  the  one  for  whom  they   are\nresponsible.  See Gould,  543  N.W.2d  at  287.   Mrs.  Rusk  entrusted  her\nhusband=s care, including prevention of the harm he might bring  to  others,\nto the nursing  home  staff  and  the  nursing  home.   And  as  a  business\nenterprise, the nursing home received compensation for its services.\n\n      With  respect  to  the  third  policy  rationale,  Ait  is   virtually\nimpossible to imagine circumstances under which a  person  would  feign  the\nsymptoms of mental disability and subject themselves  to  commitment  to  an\ninstitution in order to avoid some future civil liability.@  Id. ; see  also\nRationale (3), supra, Part I-C.   To  the  extent  that  such  circumstances\nexist, there is no evidence whatsoever  that  they  are  present  under  the\nfacts in this case.\n\n\n      Finally, there are no administrative difficulties in  this  case  with\nrespect  to  determining  the  degree  and  existence   of   Rusk=s   mental\ndisability.[11]  Under the relationship analysis set  forth  above  and  the\npresent policy analysis, it  is  unnecessary  to  determine  the  degree  of\nRusk=s mental disability.  We need only conclude  that  Rusk  had  a  mental\ndisability which served as the reason for his presence in the  nursing  home\nand the foundation of his relationship with Creasy.\n\n\n      We agree with Judge Friedlander, see  Creasy,  696  N.E.2d  at  450-51\n(dissenting), that there  was  no  material  question  of  fact  as  to  the\nexistence, let alone the advanced stage, of Rusk=s Alzheimer=s  disease  and\nhis inability to appreciate or  control  his  violent  behavior.   Rusk  was\nadmitted to the nursing home because he  was  confused  and  suffering  from\nmemory loss such that his wife could not care for him.  By  May  1995,  when\nCreasy was injured by Rusk, Rusk had been a resident  of  the  nursing  home\nfor three years and his condition had deteriorated.  He regularly  displayed\nbehaviors characteristic of a person with advanced Alzheimer=s disease  such\nas aggression, belligerence, and violence.  As evidence of Rusk=s  state  of\nmind, Rusk presented an affidavit from Sharon Ayres stating  that  Rusk  was\nin the advanced stage of Alzheimer=s and was therefore unable to  appreciate\nthe consequences of his actions.  The  Court  of  Appeals  rejected  Ayres=s\nstatement on the ground that nothing in the affidavit qualified Ayres as  an\nexpert witness.  We disagree.\n\n      Ayres was a licensed practical nurse employed by the nursing  home  at\nthe time Creasy was injured.  She  had  worked  for  the  nursing  home  for\napproximately nine  years.   Indiana  Evidence  Rule  702  provides  that  a\nwitness may be qualified as  an  expert  by  virtue  of  Aknowledge,  skill,\nexperience, training, or education.@  Only one characteristic  is  necessary\nto qualify an individual as an expert.  See Fleener  v.  State,  648  N.E.2d\n652, 657 (Ind. Ct. App. 1995), vacated in part on other  grounds,  aff=d  on\nall remaining grounds, 656 N.E.2d 1140 (Ind. 1995).  Therefore,  an  affiant\nmay qualify as an expert on the basis of practical  experience  alone.   See\nFowler v. Napier, 663 N.E.2d 1197, 1200 (Ind. Ct. App. 1996).  It is  within\nthe trial court=s sound discretion to decide whether a person  qualifies  as\nan expert witness and we will reverse only upon a  showing  that  the  trial\ncourt abused its discretion.  Id.\n\n\n      Ayres=s affidavit states that she is a licensed practical nurse, which\npresumes that she received the medical training  necessary  to  obtain  that\nlicense.  The affidavit also verifies that Ayres had worked for the  nursing\nhome for nine years at the time Creasy was injuredC  the  entire  time  Rusk\nhad lived there.   Ayres=s  certification,  associated  training,  practical\nexperience gained through working for the nursing home for nine  years,  and\nthree years of working with Rusk qualified her as an expert for purposes  of\nassessing Rusk=s mental state and rendering an opinion.  We find that  there\nis no genuine issue of material fact as to  Rusk=s  mental  capacity.   Rusk\nwas in the advanced stages of Alzheimer=s  and  was  unable  to  control  or\nappreciate the consequences of his actions.\n\n      In addition to the public policy concerns behind the Restatement rule,\nwe find that it would be contrary to public policy to hold Rusk  to  a  duty\nto Creasy when it would place  Atoo  great  a  burden  on  him  because  his\ndisorientation and  potential  for  violence  is  the  very  reason  he  was\ninstitutionalized and needed the aid of employed  caretakers.@   Gould,  543\nN.W.2d at 286.\n\n\n                                      C\n\n      Rusk was entitled to summary judgment because public  policy  and  the\nnature of the relationship  between  Rusk,  Creasy,  and  the  nursing  home\npreclude holding that Rusk  owed  a duty  of  care  to  Creasy  under  these\nfactual circumstances.\n\n\n\n                                 Conclusion\n\n\n      Having previously granted transfer, thereby vacating  the  opinion  of\nthe Court of Appeals pursuant  to  Ind.  Appellate  Rule  11(B)(3),  we  now\naffirm the trial court, finding that Rusk did not owe a duty to Creasy,  and\ngrant Rusk=s motion for summary judgment.\n\n      SHEPARD, C.J., and BOEHM, and RUCKER, JJ., concur.\n      DICKSON, J., concurring and dissenting.\n\n\n                                   In The\n                            INDIANA SUPREME COURT\n\n                                                   )\nCAROL CREASY,                           )\n           Defendant-Appellant,              )\n                                       )\n           v.                           )          08S02-9901-CV-074\n                                       )\nLLOYD RUSK,                       )\n           Plaintiff-Appellee.               )\n\n              ________________________________________________\n\n\n                    APPEAL FROM THE CARROLL CIRCUIT COURT\n\n                    The Honorable Joseph W.

But it concludes the\nopposite in Part II, finding as a matter of law that, because of this\ndefendant's impaired mental condition, he had no general duty of reasonable\ncare and is not responsible for the injuries he inflicted.  Thus,\nnotwithstanding its recognition that an impaired person remains legally\naccountable for injuries caused to innocent victims, the majority holds as\na matter of law that the rule announced in Part I should not apply in this\ncase primarily because of the relationship of the assailant to the victim,\nthe extent to which the victim may have assumed the risk of injury, and the\nassailant's inability to control or appreciate the consequences of his\nactions.  I disagree.\n      The majority supports its determination by analogy to the fireman's\nrule:  \"'The rule basically provides that professionals, whose occupations\nby nature expose them to particular risks, may not hold another negligent\nfor creating the situation to which they respond in their professional\ncapacity.'\"  Heck v. Robey, 659 N.E.2d 498, 503 (Ind. 1995) (quoting Koehn\nv. Devereaux, 495 N.E.2d 211, 215 (Ind. Ct. App. 1986)).  Drawing upon this\nanalogy, the majority states that caregivers such as the plaintiff are\nsimilarly situated to the public safety officials to whom the fireman's\nrule applies.  Slip op. at 17-18.  The majority suggests that the plaintiff\nassumed the risks created by caring for people with Alzheimer's disease\nwhen she chose to work in the nursing home.\n      We have, however, previously rejected such reasoning, refusing to use\na person's occupation as a basis for finding a lack of duty.  In Heck, this\nCourt rejected a similar determination by the Court of Appeals that the\nplaintiff, a paramedic, had \"impliedly assumed the risk of injury in the\nprimary sense, based upon his choice of occupation.\"  659 N.E.2d at 505.\nWe declined to extend the rationale of the fireman's rule to a paramedic—a\npaid public employee whose job was to rescue people.  We said:\n      We reject this primary assumption-of-risk terminology to the extent\n      that it suggests that a lack of duty may stem from a plaintiff's\n      incurred risk.  Under the [Comparative Fault] Act, a plaintiff may\n      relieve a defendant of what would otherwise be his or her duty to the\n      plaintiff only by an express consent.\n\n\nId. at 505.  See also id. at 502 n.3 (\"[T]he fireman's rule can no longer\nbe based upon an assumption-of-risk rationale.\").  This Court ultimately\nrefused to apply \"[a]ny rule that purports to effect an absolute defense\nbased upon incurred risk\" because it is contrary to our comparative fault\nsystem.  Id. at 505 (declining to address the continuing viability of the\nfireman's rule, but refusing to extend it to bar an action by a paramedic).\n\n      In support of its determination, the majority cites other states that\nhave refused to impose a duty based upon similar facts, but these states\nhave adopted their rules based upon assumption of risk and analogies to the\nfireman's rule.  See Gould v. American Family Mut. Ins. Co., 543 N.W.2d\n282, 287 (Wis. 1996) (\"By analogy, this court . . . relied on public policy\nconsiderations to exonerate negligent firestarters or homeowners from\nliability for injuries suffered by the firefighters . . . .\"); Herrle v.\nEstate of Marshall, 53 Cal. Rptr. 2d 713, 720 (Cal. Ct. App. 1996) (\"The\nvery justifications for the application of primary assumption of risk in\ncase of public firefighters . . . compel its application herein.\"); Anicet\nv. Gant, 580 So.2d 273, 276 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1991) (\"[T]he familiar\n'fireman's rule' presents an apt analogy. . . .  [I]ts very core is that a\nperson specifically hired to encounter and combat particular dangers is\nowed no independent tort duty by those who have created those dangers . . .\n.\").  See also Colman v. Notre Dame Convalescent Home, Inc., 968 F.Supp.\n809, 813-14 (D. Conn. 1997) (adopting the reasoning of Gould and Herrle);\nMujica v. Turner, 582 So.2d 24, 25 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1991) (rejecting\nthe plaintiff's claim based upon Anicet).\n      Considering Heck, it is difficult to reconcile the majority opinion in\nthis case with precedent—the majority, in essence, extends the fireman's\nrule by analogy to an employee of a private company whose job was not\nmerely to rescue, but to provide daily care.  See Heck, 659 N.E.2d at 505\n(citing Comparative Fault Act and refusing to apply the fireman's rule).\nAlthough Heck acknowledged that a court may determine that no duty exists\nbased upon the factors set forth in Webb v. Jarvis, 575 N.E.2d 992 (Ind.\n1991), see Heck, 659 N.E.2d at 505 n.11, we did not intend that the\nanalysis of incurred risk that we rejected in considering the fireman's\nrule would simply be re-incorporated into the Webb analysis.\n      Also in Heck, this Court expressed Indiana's public policy regarding\nthe protection of plaintiffs who are injured in the course of their\nprofessional care for others when we held that a plaintiff's assumption of\nrisk may not be inferred from his profession and may only serve as a bar to\nrecovery when he has given express consent.  659 N.E.2d at 503-05.\nAccordingly, under Indiana's public policy, neither the plaintiff's choice\nof occupation nor the defendant's use of her services supports a finding\nthat the defendant had no duty, as a matter of law.\n      I cannot agree with the majority's determination that the plaintiff's\nsuperior knowledge of the risks of her employment supports its finding that\nthe defendant owed the plaintiff no duty of care.  I disagree with the\nmajority's reliance upon a plaintiff's superior knowledge of the risk as a\nbasis for evaluating the question of duty.  If extended to other cases,\nthis rationale could subvert existing principles of responsibility fostered\nby tort law.  Under such an approach, for example, high school teachers\nmight be deprived of recourse for injuries inflicted by mentally or\nemotionally disabled high school students, or perhaps even students without\nsuch disabilities, because of the teachers' superior knowledge of the risks\npresented by such students.  Similarly, health care personnel who care for\npatients—even those without mental disabilities—could be barred from remedy\nfor injuries caused by such patients because the caregiver could be found\nto have superior knowledge of the risks of providing direct care in a\nhospital, and thus there could be no duty of care owed by the patient.  It\nis not only unfair but also extremely unwise social policy to deprive, as a\nmatter of law, such professionals of the tort remedy to which other victims\nof negligence are entitled.\n      In Douglass v. Irvin, 549 N.E.2d 368, 371 (Ind. 1990), although a\npremises liability case, this Court expressly repudiated the consideration\nof \"equal or superior knowledge\" in determining the issue of duty and\nlimited its evaluation to the issue of breach of duty.  As we noted in\nDouglass:\n      If a duty of care exists, the determination of whether a breach of\n      duty occurred is a factual question requiring an evaluation of the\n      landowner's conduct with respect to the requisite standard of care.\n      It is in this factual assessment that the issue of the landowner's and\n      the invitee's comparative knowledge becomes relevant.\n\n\nId. at 370.  This principle is equally applicable in the present case.\n      The majority correctly determined the issue of duty in Part I  of  its\nopinion, holding that a patient owes a duty of  reasonable  care  under  the\ncircumstances and that a patient with a mental disease has the same duty  of\nreasonable care.  But in Part II it then reverses itself and fails to  apply\nthis  rule  to  the  defendant,  exempting  him  from  this   principle   of\nresponsibility.  Such individualized determinations of  relative  fault  are\nnot properly matters of law for determination by courts, but  rather  issues\nof fact for determination by juries.   The  plaintiff's  incurred  risk,  if\nany, should be considered by a  jury  when  it  allocates  fault  under  the\nComparative Fault Act.  Ind. Code §§ 34-51-2-7 & 34-51-2-8.\n      Accordingly, I concur in the majority's holding in Part I that a\nperson with a mental disability owes a duty of reasonable care.  But I\ndissent to the majority's conclusion in Part II that discriminates against\ncaregivers and deprives them of fair recourse for injuries inflicted by a\nperson with advanced Alzheimer's disease.\n\n-----------------------\n      [1] See also Restatement (Third) of Torts  '  9(c)  (Discussion  Draft\nApr. 5, 1999); Johnson v.

See  Creasy,  696\nN.E.2d at 448.\n\n      [3] As the Court  of  Appeals  noted  in  Creasy,  the  United  States\nDistrict Court for the Northern District of Indiana  has  criticized  Bailey\non  the  ground  that  it  incorrectly  cited  Smith   and   in   doing   so\nmischaracterized the presumption regarding  children  between  the  ages  of\nseven and fourteen.  See Maynard v. Indiana Harbor Belt  R.R.  Co.,  997  F.\nSupp. 1128, 1134-35 (N.D.  Ind.  1998).   Nevertheless,  the  Maynard  court\nconcluded  that,  in  that  case,  a  thirteen-year-old  boy=s  ability   to\nrecognize danger and to exercise care for his own safety were  questions  of\nfact given the conflicting evidence presented  by  the  parties  in  summary\njudgment proceedings.  See id. at 1136-37.\n\n      [4] In 1983, Indiana statutorily adopted a comparative  fault  scheme,\nsubsuming the relevance of  contributory  negligence  embodied  in  some  of\nthese cases.  See Ind. Code ' 34-51-2 (1998)  (originally  enacted  as  P.L.\n317-1983, 1983 Ind. Acts 1930-33).  However, courts have continued to  apply\nprinciples of contributory negligence in the determination and balancing  of\ncomparative fault.  See, e.g., Walters v. Dean, 497 N.E.2d  247,  254  (Ind.\nCt. App. 1986); Kroger, 379 N.E.2d at 1010.\n\n      [5] Scholars trace this rule to Weaver v. Ward, 80 Eng. Rep. 284 (K.B.\n1616), an English trespass case decided in an era when strict liability\ncontrolled trespass law.  See Gould, 543 N.W.2d at 284 (citing W. Page\nKeeton et al., Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts ' 135, at 1072\n(1984)).\n\n      [6] This final reason in particular suggests  that  a  broader  policy\nconsideration supporting the generally accepted rule was an assumption  that\npersons with mental disabilities should be  institutionalized  or  confined,\nrather than Alive in the world.@  This consideration will  be  discussed  in\nthe next section of this opinion.\n\n      [7] See, e.g., Ind.

We hold that adults with mental disabilities have the same general duty of care toward others as those without. But we conclude that the relationship between the parties and public policy considerations here are such that Rusk had no such duty to Creasy.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Background</i></h2>\n<p>In July, 1992, Lloyd Rusk's wife admitted Rusk to the Brethren Healthcare Center (\"BHC\") because he suffered from memory loss and confusion and Rusk's wife was unable to care for him. Rusk's primary diagnosis was Alzheimer's disease. Over the course of three years at BHC, Rusk experienced periods of anxiousness, confusion, depression, disorientation, and agitation. Rusk often resisted when staff members attempted to remove him from prohibited areas of the facility. On several occasions, Rusk was belligerent with both staff and other residents. In particular, Rusk was often combative, agitated, and aggressive and would hit staff members when they tried to care for him.</p>\n<p>BHC had employed Creasy as a certified nursing assistant for nearly 20 months when the incident at issue occurred. Creasy's responsibilities included caring for Rusk and other patients with Alzheimer's disease. Creasy did not have specialized training on how to care for people with Alzheimer's disease, but she did attend a short BHC presentation on the pathological effects of Alzheimer's. Residents with Alzheimer's had bruised Creasy during the course of her work for BHC, and Creasy knew that Rusk had Alzheimer's disease.</p>\n<p>On May 16, 1995, Creasy and another certified nursing assistant, Linda Davis, were working through their routine of putting Rusk and other residents to bed. Creasy knew that Rusk had been \"very agitated and combative that evening.\" (R. at 228.) By Creasy's account:</p>\n<blockquote>[Davis] was helping me put Mr. Rusk to bed. She was holding his wrists to keep him from hitting us and I was trying to get his legs to put him to bed. He was hitting and kicking wildly. During this time, he kicked me several times in my left knee and hip area. My lower back popped and I yelled out with pain from my lower back and left knee.</blockquote>\n<p>(<i>Id.</i>)</p>\n<p>Creasy filed a civil negligence suit against Rusk, seeking monetary damages for the injuries she suffered as a result of Rusk's conduct. Rusk moved for summary judgment and the trial court granted his motion. Creasy appealed. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding \"that a person's mental capacity, whether that person is a child or an adult, must be factored [into] the determination of whether a legal duty exists,\" <i>Creasy v. Rusk,</i> 696 N.E.2d 442, 446 (Ind.Ct.App.1998), and that a genuine issue of material fact existed as to the level of Rusk's mental capacity, <i>see id.</i> at 448.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Discussion</i></h2>\n<p>This case requires us to decide two distinct questions of Indiana common law:</p>\n<p>(1) Whether the general duty of care imposed upon adults with mental disabilities is the same as that for adults without mental disabilities?</p>\n<p>(2) Whether the circumstances of Rusk's case are such that the general duty of care imposed upon adults with mental disabilities should be imposed upon him?</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>In many, if not most, jurisdictions, the general duty of care imposed on adults with mental disabilities is the same as that for adults without mental disabilities. <i>See</i> Restatement (Second) of Torts § 283B (1965).<sup>[1]</sup> Adults with mental disabilities <span class=\"star-pagination\">*662</span> are held to the same standard of care as that of a reasonable person under the same circumstances without regard to the alleged tortfeasor's capacity to control or understand the consequences of his or her actions. <i>See id.</i> We will discuss the Restatement rule in greater detail in Part I-C.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Judge Kirsch, writing for the Court of Appeals in this case, found that Indiana law does not follow the Restatement rule. The Court of Appeals held \"that a person's mental capacity, whether that person is a child or an adult, must be factored [into] the determination of whether a legal duty exists.\" <i>Creasy v. Rusk,</i> 696 N.E.2d 442, 446 (Ind.Ct.App.1998).<sup>[2]</sup> We believe that the Court of Appeals accurately stated Indiana law but that the law is in need of revision.</p>\n<p>With respect to children, Indiana has incorporated the essence of the Restatement standard for determining the liability of children for their alleged tortious acts. The Restatement standard of conduct for a child is \"that of a reasonable person of like age, intelligence, and experience under like circumstances.\" Restatement (Second) of Torts § 283A (1965) (hereinafter, \"Restatement rule\"). Indiana reformulates the Restatement rule into a three-tiered analysis:</p>\n<blockquote>[C]hildren under the age of 7 years are conclusively presumed to be incapable of being contributorily negligent, from 7 to 14 a rebuttable presumption exists they may be guilty thereof, and over 14, absent special circumstances, they are chargeable with exercising the standard of care of an adult.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Bailey v. Martz,</i> 488 N.E.2d 716, 721 (Ind. Ct.App.1986) (citing <i>Smith v. Diamond,</i> 421 N.E.2d 1172, 1177-79 (Ind.Ct.App. 1981)), <i>transfer denied.</i><sup>[3]</sup> In the age seven to fourteen category, Indiana applies the Restatement standard and ascertains whether the child exercised the care under the circumstances of a child of like age, knowledge, judgment, and experience. <i>See id.</i></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*663</span> Consistent with recognizing a rule that holds a child to a standard of care proportionate to his or her capacity, <i>see Baltimore &amp; Ohio Southwestern R.R. Co. v. Hickman,</i> 40 Ind.App. 315, 318, 81 N.E. 1086, 1087 (1907), Judge Kirsch observed that Indiana has also indicated a willingness to consider the mental capacity of an adult with mental disabilities when determining negligence liability, <i>Creasy,</i> 696 N.E.2d at 445. <i>See generally </i><i>Kroger Co. v. Haun,</i> 177 Ind.App. 403, 413, 379 N.E.2d 1004, 1010-11 (1978) (\"[A]bsent extenuating circumstances such as age or mental incompetency, . . . contributory negligence may be found either where plaintiff has actual knowledge of the danger, or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have appreciated the danger.\"); <i>Hunsberger v. Wyman,</i> 247 Ind. 369, 373, 216 N.E.2d 345, 348 (1966) (\"In order for an act or an omission to constitute negligence, a person to be charged must have knowledge or notice that such an act or omission involved danger to another. . . . Where there is no knowledge, actual or constructive, of danger or peril on the part of a defendant, he cannot be charged with negligence.\"); <i>Riesbeck Drug Co. v. Wray,</i> 111 Ind.App. 467, 475, 39 N.E.2d 776, 779 (1942) (\"Knowledge and appreciation of peril are essential elements of contributory negligence, and evidence is admissible to show a plaintiff's mental condition to aid the jury in determining whether he understood and appreciated the danger.\").<sup>[4]</sup> Judge Kirsch reasons that these cases either rely on or adopt the authority which calls for special consideration in applying the reasonable person standard under extenuating circumstances where a person \"`unable to apprehend apparent danger and to avoid exposure to it cannot be said to be guilty of negligence.'\" <i>Creasy,</i> 696 N.E.2d at 445 (quoting <i>Riesbeck,</i> 111 Ind. App. at 475, 39 N.E.2d at 779 (citing in turn 38 Am.Jur., <i>Negligence</i> § 201, at 882)). Based on this authority, the Court of Appeals held that the rule in Indiana is \"that a person's mental capacity, whether that person is a child or an adult, must be factored [into] the determination of whether a legal duty exists.\" <i>Creasy,</i> 696 N.E.2d at 446.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>As briefly noted in Part I-A, the generally accepted rule in jurisdictions other than Indiana is that mental disability does not excuse a person from liability for \"conduct which does not conform to the standard of a reasonable man under like circumstances.\"<sup>[5]</sup> Restatement (Second) of Torts § 283B; <i>accord</i> Restatement (Third) of Torts § 9(c) (Discussion Draft Apr. 5, 1999) (\"Unless the actor is a child, the actor's mental or emotional disability is not considered in determining whether conduct is negligent.\"). People with mental disabilities are commonly held liable for their intentional and negligent torts. No allowance is made for lack of intelligence, ignorance, excitability, or proneness to accident. <i>See</i> Restatement (Second) of Torts § 283B cmt. c.</p>\n<p>Legal scholars and authorities recognize that it is \"impossible to ascribe either the volition implicit in an intentional tort, the departure from the standard of a `reasonable' person which defines an act of ordinary negligence, or indeed any concept of `fault' at all to one who . . . is by definition <span class=\"star-pagination\">*664</span> unable to control his [or her] own actions through any exercise of reason.\" <i>Anicet v. Gant,</i> 580 So.2d 273, 275 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 1991) (citations omitted). Rather, the Restatement rule holding people with mental disabilities liable for their torts was founded upon public policy considerations.</p>\n<p>The public policy reasons most often cited for holding individuals with mental disabilities to a standard of reasonable care in negligence claims include the following.</p>\n<blockquote>(1) Allocates losses between two innocent parties to the one who caused or occasioned the loss. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Gould v. American Family Mut. Ins.,</i> 198 Wis.2d 450, 543 N.W.2d 282, 286 (1996). Under this rationale, the one who experienced the loss or injury as a result of the conduct of a person with a mental disability is presumed not to have assumed risks or to have been contributorily negligent with respect to the cause of the injury. This policy is also intended to protect even negligent third parties from bearing excessive liabilities. <i>See</i> Restatement (Third) of Torts § 9 cmt. e (Discussion Draft Apr. 5, 1999).</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(2) Provides incentive to those responsible for people with disabilities and interested in their estates to prevent harm and \"restrain\" those who are potentially dangerous. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Gould,</i> 543 N.W.2d at 287.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(3) Removes inducements for alleged tortfeasors to fake a mental disability in order to escape liability. <i>See, e.g., id.</i> The Restatement mentions the ease with which mental disability can be feigned as one possible basis for this policy concern. <i>See</i> Restatement (Second) of Torts § 283B cmt. b(2).</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(4) Avoids administrative problems involved in courts and juries attempting to identify and assess the significance of an actor's disability. <i>See id.</i> at cmts. b(1) &amp; b(2). As a practical matter, it is arguably too difficult to account for or draw any \"satisfactory line between mental deficiency and those variations of temperament, intellect, and emotional balance.\" <i>Id.</i> at cmt. b(1).</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(5) Forces persons with disabilities to pay for the damage they do if they \"are to live in the world.\" <i>Id.</i> at cmt. b(3). The Restatement adds that it is better that the assets, if any, of the one with the mental deficiency be used \"to compensate innocent victims than that [the assets] remain in their hands.\" <i>Id.</i> A discussion draft for the Restatement (Third) of Torts rephrases this policy rationale and concludes: \"[I]f a person is suffering from a mental disorder so serious as to make it likely that the person will engage in substandard conduct that threatens the safety of others, there can be doubts as to whether this person should be allowed to engage in the normal range of society's activities; given these doubts, there is nothing especially harsh in at least holding the person responsible for the harms the person may cause by substandard conduct.\" Restatement (Third) of Torts § 9 cmt. e (Discussion Draft April 5, 1999).<sup>[6]</sup></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D</h2>\n<p>To assist in deciding whether Indiana should adopt the generally accepted rule, we turn to an examination of contemporary public policy in Indiana as embodied in enactments of our state legislature. <i>See </i><i>Schornick v. Butler,</i> 205 Ind. 304, 304, 185 N.E. 111, 112 (1933) (stating that the public policy of Indiana is derived from, <i>inter alia,</i> statutory enactments), <i>reh'g denied.</i></p>\n<p>Since the 1970s, Indiana law has strongly reflected policies to deinstitutionalize people with disabilities and integrate them <span class=\"star-pagination\">*665</span> into the least restrictive environment.<sup>[7]</sup> National policy changes have led the way for some of Indiana's enactments in that several federal acts either guarantee the civil rights of people with disabilities or condition state aid upon state compliance with desegregation and integrationist practices. <i>See, e.g., Individuals with Disabilities Education Act,</i> 20 U.S.C. § 1400 <i>et seq.</i> (1994) (requiring that children with disabilities receive a free appropriate public education in the least restrictive environment in states that accept allocated funds) (originally enacted in 1975 as the <i>Education for All Handicapped Children Act,</i> P.L. 94-142 (amending the state education grant program under the 1970 <i>Education for the Handicapped Act,</i> P.L. 91-230; requiring states to provide a free appropriate public education to all children with disabilities in order to receive state grant funds)); <i>Americans with Disabilities Act,</i> 42 U.S.C. § 12132 (1994), and implementing regulation 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d) (1999) (providing that a public entity shall administer services, programs, and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities); <i>Olmstead v.</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*666</span> <i>Zimring,</i> 527 U.S. 581, 119 S.Ct. 2176, 2185, 144 L.Ed.2d 540 (1999) (interpreting the Americans with Disabilities Act to find that \"unjustified isolation . . . is properly regarded as discrimination based on disability\"); <i>Fair Housing Act,</i> 42 U.S.C. § 3604 (1994) (prohibiting discrimination based on \"handicap\" in the sale or rental of a dwelling) (originally enacted in 1968 as P.L. 90-284 to prohibit housing discrimination based on race, color, religion, or national origin; amended in 1988 by P.L. 100-430 to include protections for people with \"handicaps\").</p>\n<p>These legislative developments reflect policies consistent with those supporting the Restatement rule generally accepted outside Indiana in that they reflect a determination that people with disabilities should be treated in the same way as non-disabled persons.</p>\n<p>We pause for a moment to consider in greater detail the issue raised in footnote 6, that is, that the Restatement rule may very well have been grounded in a policy determination that persons with mental disabilities should be institutionalized or otherwise confined rather than \"live in the world.\" It is clear from our recitation of state and federal legislative and regulatory developments that contemporary public policy has rejected institutionalization and confinement for a \"strong professional consensus in favor of . . . community treatment. . . and integration into the least restrictive . . . environment.\"<sup>[8]</sup> Indeed, scholarly commentary has noted that \"new statutes and case law . . . have transformed the areas of commitment, guardianship, confidentiality, consent to treatment, and institutional conditions.\"<sup>[9]</sup> We observe that it is a matter of some irony that public policies favoring the opposite endsinstitutionalization and confinement on the one hand and community treatment and integration into the least restrictive environment on the othershould nevertheless yield the same common law rule: that the general duty of care imposed on adults with mental disabilities is the same as that for adults without mental disabilities.</p>\n<p>In balancing the considerations presented in the foregoing analysis, we reject the Court of Appeals's approach and adopt the Restatement rule. We hold that a person with mental disabilities is generally held to the same standard of care as that of a reasonable person under the same circumstances without regard to the alleged tortfeasor's capacity to control or <span class=\"star-pagination\">*667</span> understand the consequences of his or her actions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>We turn now to the question of whether the circumstances of Rusk's case are such that the general duty of care imposed upon adults with mental disabilities should be found to run from him to Creasy.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>In asking this question, we recognize that exceptions to the general rule will arise where the factual circumstances negate the factors supporting imposition of a dutyparticularly with respect to the nature of the parties' relationship and public policy considerations. For example, courts in jurisdictions that apply the reasonable person standard to individuals with mental disabilities have uniformly held that Alzheimer's patients who have no capacity to control their conduct do not owe a duty to their caregivers to refrain from violent conduct because the factual circumstances negate the policy rationales behind the presumption of liability. <i>See </i><i>Colman v. Notre Dame Convalescent Home, Inc.,</i> 968 F.Supp. 809 (D.Conn.1997) (holding that while an adult with mental disabilities is ordinarily responsible for injuries resulting from negligence, no duty arises between an institutionalized patient and his or her caregiver); <i>Gould v. American Family Mut. Ins. Co.,</i> 198 Wis.2d 450, 543 N.W.2d 282 (1996) (carving out an exception to the presumption of liability for institutionalized people with mental disabilities who are unable to control or appreciate the consequences of their conduct when they injure paid caregivers and noting that these circumstances negate the rationale behind the presumptionapplication of the presumption would place an unreasonable burden on people with mental disabilities who are institutionalized); <i>Herrle v. Estate of Marshall,</i> 45 Cal.App.4th 1761, 53 Cal.Rptr.2d 713 (Ct.App.1996) (concluding that public policy precluded imposition of liability because the healthcare provider, not the patient, is in the best position to protect against risk of injury to the service provider where the risk is rooted in the reason for the treatment), <i>review denied</i>; <i>Mujica v. Turner,</i> 582 So.2d 24 (Fla.Dist. Ct.App.1991) (holding nursing home patient with Alzheimer's was not liable for injury to a physical therapist), <i>review denied</i>; <i>Anicet v. Gant,</i> 580 So.2d 273 (Fla. Dist.Ct.App.1991) (concluding that a person who has no capacity to control his or her conduct does not owe a duty to refrain from violent conduct toward a person who is specifically employed to treat or control the patient), <i>review denied.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>We find that the relationship between Rusk and Creasy and public policy concerns dictate that Rusk owed no duty of care to Creasy. <i>See </i><i>Webb v. Jarvis,</i> 575 N.E.2d at 995 (balancing three factors to determine whether an individual owes a duty to another: (1) the relationship between the parties; (2) the reasonable foreseeability of harm to the person injured; and (3) public policy concerns).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B-1</h2>\n<p>Unlike the typical victim supporting the Restatement rationale, Creasy was not a member of the public at large, unable to anticipate or safeguard against the harm she encountered. Creasy knew of Rusk's violent history. She could have changed her course of action or requested additional assistance when she recognized Rusk's state of mind on the evening when she received the alleged injury. Rusk's inability to comprehend the circumstances of his relationship with Creasy and others was the very reason Creasy was employed to support Rusk. The nursing home and Creasy, through the nursing home, were \"employed to encounter, and knowingly did encounter, just the dangers which injured\" Creasy. <i>Id.</i> at 276. In fact, caregivers and their employers under these circumstances are better positioned to prevent caregiver injury and to protect <span class=\"star-pagination\">*668</span> against risks faced as a result of job responsibilities. In Indiana, the workers' compensation system, not the tort system, exists to cover such employment-related losses. To the extent that the workers' compensation system is inadequate as Creasy asserts, the inadequacy reflects defects in the workers' compensation system and is not a ground for alternative recovery under tort law.</p>\n<p>An analogous situation arises in Indiana law under the fireman's rule. The \"fireman's rule provides that firemen [or other public safety officials] responding in emergencies are owed only the duty of abstaining from positive wrongful acts.\" <i>Heck v. Robey,</i> 659 N.E.2d 498, 501 (Ind. 1995); <i>see also </i><i>Sam v. Wesley,</i> 647 N.E.2d 382, 384 (Ind.Ct.App.1995). Public safety officials and caregivers such as Creasy are similarly situated in that they are \"specifically hired to encounter and combat particular dangers,\" and by accepting such employment assume the risks associated with their respective occupations.<sup>[10]</sup><i>Anicet,</i> 580 So.2d at 276.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B-2</h2>\n<p><i>Public Policy Concerns.</i> The first rationale behind the Restatement rule justifies imposing a duty on a defendant with a mental disability where it seems unfair to force a plaintiff who did not contribute to the cause of his or her injury to bear the cost of that injury. This policy concern overlaps with the relationship analysis set forth <i>supra.</i> The nature of Creasy and Rusk's relationship was such that Creasy cannot be \"presumed not to have assumed risks . . . with respect to the cause of the injury.\" See Rationale (1), <i>supra,</i> Part I-C. Therefore, imposing a duty on Rusk in this circumstance is not justified by the first Restatement policy rationale.</p>\n<p>The second Restatement policy rationale creates an inducement for those responsible for a person with a mental disability to prevent harm to others. By placing Rusk in a nursing home, we presume Rusk's wife made a difficult decision based on her desire to prevent Rusk from being violent and harming himself, herself, or others. Without endorsing the incentives for confinement arguably fostered by the Restatement rationale, we agree with the conclusion set forth by the Wisconsin Supreme Court in <i>Gould</i> that a family member who places a relative in a long-term care facility, institution, nursing home, or similarly restrictive environment is unlikely to need further inducement to restrain the one for whom they are responsible. <i>See </i><i>Gould,</i> 543 N.W.2d at 287. Mrs. Rusk entrusted her husband's care, including prevention of the harm he might bring to others, to the nursing home staff and the nursing home. And as a business enterprise, the nursing home received compensation for its services.</p>\n<p>With respect to the third policy rationale, \"it is virtually impossible to imagine circumstances under which a person would feign the symptoms of mental disability and subject themselves to commitment to an institution in order to avoid some future civil liability.\" <i>Id.</i>; <i>see also</i> Rationale (3), <i>supra,</i> Part I-C. To the extent that such circumstances exist, there is no evidence whatsoever that they are present under the facts in this case.</p>\n<p>Finally, there are no administrative difficulties in this case with respect to determining the degree and existence of Rusk's mental disability.<sup>[11]</sup> Under the relationship <span class=\"star-pagination\">*669</span> analysis set forth above and the present policy analysis, it is unnecessary to determine the degree of Rusk's mental disability. We need only conclude that Rusk had a mental disability which served as the reason for his presence in the nursing home and the foundation of his relationship with Creasy.</p>\n<p>We agree with Judge Friedlander, <i>see </i><i>Creasy,</i> 696 N.E.2d at 450-51 (dissenting), that there was no material question of fact as to the existence, let alone the advanced stage, of Rusk's Alzheimer's disease and his inability to appreciate or control his violent behavior. Rusk was admitted to the nursing home because he was confused and suffering from memory loss such that his wife could not care for him. By May 1995, when Creasy was injured by Rusk, Rusk had been a resident of the nursing home for three years and his condition had deteriorated. He regularly displayed behaviors characteristic of a person with advanced Alzheimer's disease such as aggression, belligerence, and violence. As evidence of Rusk's state of mind, Rusk presented an affidavit from Sharon Ayres stating that Rusk was in the advanced stage of Alzheimer's and was therefore unable to appreciate the consequences of his actions. The Court of Appeals rejected Ayres's statement on the ground that nothing in the affidavit qualified Ayres as an expert witness. We disagree.</p>\n<p>Ayres was a licensed practical nurse employed by the nursing home at the time Creasy was injured. She had worked for the nursing home for approximately nine years. Indiana Evidence Rule 702 provides that a witness may be qualified as an expert by virtue of \"knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education.\" Only one characteristic is necessary to qualify an individual as an expert. <i>See </i><i>Fleener v. State,</i> 648 N.E.2d 652, 657 (Ind. Ct.App.1995), <i>vacated in part on other grounds, aff'd on all remaining grounds,</i> 656 N.E.2d 1140 (Ind.1995). Therefore, an affiant may qualify as an expert on the basis of practical experience alone. <i>See </i><i>Fowler v. Napier,</i> 663 N.E.2d 1197, 1200 (Ind.Ct.App.1996). It is within the trial court's sound discretion to decide whether a person qualifies as an expert witness and we will reverse only upon a showing that the trial court abused its discretion. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Ayres's affidavit states that she is a licensed practical nurse, which presumes that she received the medical training necessary to obtain that license. The affidavit also verifies that Ayres had worked for the nursing home for nine years at the time Creasy was injuredthe entire time Rusk had lived there. Ayres's certification, associated training, practical experience gained through working for the nursing home for nine years, and three years of working with Rusk qualified her as an expert for purposes of assessing Rusk's mental state and rendering an opinion. We find that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to Rusk's mental capacity. Rusk was in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's and was unable to control or appreciate the consequences of his actions.</p>\n<p>In addition to the public policy concerns behind the Restatement rule, we find that it would be contrary to public policy to hold Rusk to a duty to Creasy when it would place \"too great a burden on him because his disorientation and potential for violence is the very reason he was institutionalized and needed the aid of employed caretakers.\" <i>Gould,</i> 543 N.W.2d at 286.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*670</span> C</h2>\n<p>Rusk was entitled to summary judgment because public policy and the nature of the relationship between Rusk, Creasy, and the nursing home preclude holding that Rusk owed a duty of care to Creasy under these factual circumstances.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Conclusion</i></h2>\n<p>Having previously granted transfer, thereby vacating the opinion of the Court of Appeals pursuant to Ind. Appellate Rule 11(B)(3), we now affirm the trial court, finding that Rusk did not owe a duty to Creasy, and grant Rusk's motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p>SHEPARD, C.J., and BOEHM and RUCKER, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p>DICKSON, J., concurring and dissenting.</p>\n<p>DICKSON, Justice, concurring and dissenting</p>\n<p>I concur with Part I but dissent to Part II of the majority opinion. Citing sound legal and policy grounds, the majority holds in Part I that a person with a mental disability is generally held to an ordinary standard of legal responsibility without regard to the person's capacity to control or understand the consequences of his or her actions. But it concludes the opposite in Part II, finding as a matter of law that, because of this defendant's impaired mental condition, he had no general duty of reasonable care and is not responsible for the injuries he inflicted. Thus, notwithstanding its recognition that an impaired person remains legally accountable for injuries caused to innocent victims, the majority holds as a matter of law that the rule announced in Part I should not apply in this case primarily because of the relationship of the assailant to the victim, the extent to which the victim may have assumed the risk of injury, and the assailant's inability to control or appreciate the consequences of his actions. I disagree.</p>\n<p>The majority supports its determination by analogy to the fireman's rule: \"`The rule basically provides that professionals, whose occupations by nature expose them to particular risks, may not hold another negligent for creating the situation to which they respond in their professional capacity.'\" <i>Heck v. Robey,</i> 659 N.E.2d 498, 503 (Ind.1995) (quoting <i>Koehn v. Devereaux,</i> 495 N.E.2d 211, 215 (Ind.Ct.App. 1986)). Drawing upon this analogy, the majority states that caregivers such as the plaintiff are similarly situated to the public safety officials to whom the fireman's rule applies. 730 N.E.2d at 668. The majority suggests that the plaintiff assumed the risks created by caring for people with Alzheimer's disease when she chose to work in the nursing home.</p>\n<p>We have, however, previously rejected such reasoning, refusing to use a person's occupation as a basis for finding a lack of duty. In <i>Heck,</i> this Court rejected a similar determination by the Court of Appeals that the plaintiff, a paramedic, had \"<i>impliedly</i> assumed the risk of injury in the primary sense, based upon his choice of occupation.\" 659 N.E.2d at 505. We declined to extend the rationale of the fireman's rule to a paramedica paid public employee whose job was to rescue people. We said:</p>\n<blockquote>We reject this primary assumption-of-risk terminology to the extent that it suggests that a lack of duty may stem from a plaintiff's incurred risk. Under the [Comparative Fault] Act, a plaintiff may relieve a defendant of what would otherwise be his or her duty to the plaintiff only by an express consent.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 505. <i>See also id.</i> at 502 n. 3 (\"[T]he fireman's rule can no longer be based upon an assumption-of-risk rationale.\"). This Court ultimately refused to apply \"[a]ny rule that purports to effect an absolute defense based upon incurred risk\" because it is contrary to our comparative fault system. <i>Id.</i> at 505 (declining to address the continuing viability of the fireman's rule, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*671</span> but refusing to extend it to bar an action by a paramedic).</p>\n<p>In support of its determination, the majority cites other states that have refused to impose a duty based upon similar facts, but these states have adopted their rules based upon assumption of risk and analogies to the fireman's rule. <i>See </i><i>Gould v. American Family Mut. Ins. Co.,</i> 198 Wis.2d 450, 543 N.W.2d 282, 287 (1996) (\"By analogy, this court . . . relied on public policy considerations to exonerate negligent firestarters or homeowners from liability for injuries suffered by the firefighters.. . .\"); <i>Herrle v. Estate of Marshall,</i> 45 Cal.App.4th 1761, 53 Cal.Rptr.2d 713, 720 (Cal.Ct.App.1996) (\"The very justifications for the application of primary assumption of risk in case of public firefighters. . . compel its application herein.\"); <i>Anicet v. Gant,</i> 580 So.2d 273, 276 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1991) (\"[T]he familiar `fireman's rule' presents an apt analogy. . . . [I]ts very core is that a person specifically hired to encounter and combat particular dangers is owed no independent tort duty by those who have created those dangers. . . .\"). <i>See also </i><i>Colman v. Notre Dame Convalescent Home, Inc.,</i> 968 F.Supp. 809, 813-14 (D.Conn.1997) (adopting the reasoning of <i>Gould</i> and <i>Herrle</i>); <i>Mujica v. Turner,</i> 582 So.2d 24, 25 (Fla. Dist.Ct.App.1991) (rejecting the plaintiff's claim based upon <i>Anicet</i>).</p>\n<p>Considering <i>Heck,</i> it is difficult to reconcile the majority opinion in this case with precedentthe majority, in essence, extends the fireman's rule by analogy to an employee of a private company whose job was not merely to rescue, but to provide daily care. <i>See </i><i>Heck,</i> 659 N.E.2d at 505 (citing Comparative Fault Act and refusing to apply the fireman's rule). Although <i>Heck</i> acknowledged that a court may determine that no duty exists based upon the factors set forth in <i>Webb v. Jarvis,</i> 575 N.E.2d 992 (Ind.1991), <i>see </i><i>Heck,</i> 659 N.E.2d at 505 n. 11, we did not intend that the analysis of incurred risk that we rejected in considering the fireman's rule would simply be re-incorporated into the <i>Webb</i> analysis.</p>\n<p>Also in <i>Heck,</i> this Court expressed Indiana's public policy regarding the protection of plaintiffs who are injured in the course of their professional care for others when we held that a plaintiff's assumption of risk may not be inferred from his profession and may only serve as a bar to recovery when he has given express consent. 659 N.E.2d at 503-05. Accordingly, under Indiana's public policy, neither the plaintiff's choice of occupation nor the defendant's use of her services supports a finding that the defendant had no duty, as a matter of law.</p>\n<p>I cannot agree with the majority's determination that the plaintiff's superior knowledge of the risks of her employment supports its finding that the defendant owed the plaintiff no duty of care. I disagree with the majority's reliance upon a plaintiff's superior knowledge of the risk as a basis for evaluating the question of duty. If extended to other cases, this rationale could subvert existing principles of responsibility fostered by tort law. Under such an approach, for example, high school teachers might be deprived of recourse for injuries inflicted by mentally or emotionally disabled high school students, or perhaps even students without such disabilities, because of the teachers' superior knowledge of the risks presented by such students. Similarly, health care personnel who care for patientseven those without mental disabilitiescould be barred from remedy for injuries caused by such patients because the caregiver could be found to have superior knowledge of the risks of providing direct care in a hospital, and thus there could be no duty of care owed by the patient. It is not only unfair but also extremely unwise social policy to deprive, as a matter of law, such professionals of the tort remedy to which other victims of negligence are entitled.</p>\n<p>In <i>Douglass v. Irvin,</i> 549 N.E.2d 368, 371 (Ind.1990), although a premises liability case, this Court expressly repudiated <span class=\"star-pagination\">*672</span> the consideration of \"equal or superior knowledge\" in determining the issue of duty and limited its evaluation to the issue of breach of duty. As we noted in <i>Douglass</i>:</p>\n<blockquote>If a duty of care exists, the determination of whether a breach of duty occurred is a factual question requiring an evaluation of the landowner's conduct with respect to the requisite standard of care. It is in this factual assessment that the issue of the landowner's and the invitee's comparative knowledge becomes relevant.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 370. This principle is equally applicable in the present case.</p>\n<p>The majority correctly determined the issue of duty in Part I of its opinion, holding that a patient owes a duty of reasonable care under the circumstances and that a patient with a mental disease has the same duty of reasonable care. But in Part II it then reverses itself and fails to apply this rule to the defendant, exempting him from this principle of responsibility. Such individualized determinations of relative fault are not properly matters of law for determination by courts, but rather issues of fact for determination by juries. The plaintiff's incurred risk, if any, should be considered by a jury when it allocates fault under the Comparative Fault Act. IND.CODE §§ 34-51-2-7 &amp; 34-51-2-8.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, I concur in the majority's holding in Part I that a person with a mental disability owes a duty of reasonable care. But I dissent to the majority's conclusion in Part II that discriminates against caregivers and deprives them of fair recourse for injuries inflicted by a person with advanced Alzheimer's disease.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  <i>See also</i> Restatement (Third) of Torts § 9(c) (Discussion Draft Apr. 5, 1999); <i>Johnson v.

Ellis, <i>Tort Responsibility of Mentally Disabled Persons,</i> 1981 Am. B. Found. Res. J. 1079, 1079-80 (1981). One legal scholar has noted: \"The legislative goal of `integrating' people with disabilities into society will never be fully accomplished unless tort law reflects a view that those people have a right to live in the world. Courts should require not only that people with disabilities take precautions for their own protection, but that society acknowledge their existence and make accommodations for them.\" Adam A. Milani, <i>Living in the World: A New Look at the Disabled in the Law of Torts,</i> 48 Cath. U.L.Rev. 323, 417 (1999). Other state courts have cited integration policies as the foundation for their tort law decisions. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Vaughn v. Northwest Airlines, Inc.,</i> 558 N.W.2d 736, 744 (Minn.1997) (finding that integration policy found in legislation making public accommodations accessible to people with disabilities could be incorporated in the common law as the result of \"accumulated experience\" and as common law rules are \"carefully crafted both to reflect our traditions as a state and to address emerging societal needs\").</p>\n<p>[10]  In <i>Heck v. Robey</i><i>,</i> we concluded that the concept of incurred risk as embodied in the fireman's rule exception to the rescue doctrine was subsumed by Indiana's comparative fault scheme. <i>See</i> 659 N.E.2d at 505. However, we recognized that not every such case will go to trial: \"A defendant will prevail at summary judgment if the plaintiff expressly assumed the risks of the activity and agreed to hold the defendant harmless . . . or <i>if the defendant otherwise had no duty to the plaintiff.\" Id.</i> (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>[11]  Many legal scholars have questioned the significance of the \"administrative difficulties and judicial efficiency\" policy rationale behind the Restatement rule. They argue that our legal system regularly entrusts judges and juries as fact-finders to make difficult determinations about mental competence for a range of legal issues (e.g., guardianship, contract and testamentary capacity, criminal proceedings, contributory negligence allocations in tort claims, and commitment hearings) because fact-finders are uniquely positioned to weigh evidence, judge credibility, assess witness testimony, and apply the law thereto. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Ellis, <i>supra,</i> note 9, at 1089; Wm.

We hold that adults with mental disabilities have the same general duty of care toward others as those without. But we conclude that the relationship between the parties and public policy considerations here are such that Rusk had no such duty to Creasy.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Background</i></h2>\n<p>In July, 1992, Lloyd Rusk's wife admitted Rusk to the Brethren Healthcare Center (\"BHC\") because he suffered from memory loss and confusion and Rusk's wife was unable to care for him. Rusk's primary diagnosis was Alzheimer's disease. Over the course of three years at BHC, Rusk experienced periods of anxiousness, confusion, depression, disorientation, and agitation. Rusk often resisted when staff members attempted to remove him from prohibited areas of the facility. On several occasions, Rusk was belligerent with both staff and other residents. In particular, Rusk was often combative, agitated, and aggressive and would hit staff members when they tried to care for him.</p>\n<p>BHC had employed Creasy as a certified nursing assistant for nearly 20 months when the incident at issue occurred. Creasy's responsibilities included caring for Rusk and other patients with Alzheimer's disease. Creasy did not have specialized training on how to care for people with Alzheimer's disease, but she did attend a short BHC presentation on the pathological effects of Alzheimer's. Residents with Alzheimer's had bruised Creasy during the course of her work for BHC, and Creasy knew that Rusk had Alzheimer's disease.</p>\n<p>On May 16, 1995, Creasy and another certified nursing assistant, Linda Davis, were working through their routine of putting Rusk and other residents to bed. Creasy knew that Rusk had been \"very agitated and combative that evening.\" (R. at 228.) By Creasy's account:</p>\n<blockquote>[Davis] was helping me put Mr. Rusk to bed. She was holding his wrists to keep him from hitting us and I was trying to get his legs to put him to bed. He was hitting and kicking wildly. During this time, he kicked me several times in my left knee and hip area. My lower back popped and I yelled out with pain from my lower back and left knee.</blockquote>\n<p>(<i>Id.</i>)</p>\n<p>Creasy filed a civil negligence suit against Rusk, seeking monetary damages for the injuries she suffered as a result of Rusk's conduct.

Rather, the Restatement rule holding people with mental disabilities liable for their torts was founded upon public policy considerations.</p>\n<p>The public policy reasons most often cited for holding individuals with mental disabilities to a standard of reasonable care in negligence claims include the following.</p>\n<blockquote>(1) Allocates losses between two innocent parties to the one who caused or occasioned the loss. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Gould v. American Family Mut. Ins.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1734057\"><a href=\"/opinion/1734057/gould-v-american-family-mut-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">198</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wis. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">450</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1734057\"><a href=\"/opinion/1734057/gould-v-american-family-mut-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">282</span></a></span>, 286 (1996). Under this rationale, the one who experienced the loss or injury as a result of the conduct of a person with a mental disability is presumed not to have assumed risks or to have been contributorily negligent with respect to the cause of the injury. This policy is also intended to protect even negligent third parties from bearing excessive liabilities. <i>See</i> Restatement (Third) of Torts § 9 cmt. e (Discussion Draft Apr. 5, 1999).</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(2) Provides incentive to those responsible for people with disabilities and interested in their estates to prevent harm and \"restrain\" those who are potentially dangerous. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Gould,</i> 543 N.W.2d at 287.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(3) Removes inducements for alleged tortfeasors to fake a mental disability in order to escape liability. <i>See, e.g., id.</i> The Restatement mentions the ease with which mental disability can be feigned as one possible basis for this policy concern. <i>See</i> Restatement (Second) of Torts § 283B cmt. b(2).</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(4) Avoids administrative problems involved in courts and juries attempting to identify and assess the significance of an actor's disability. <i>See id.</i> at cmts. b(1) &amp; b(2). As a practical matter, it is arguably too difficult to account for or draw any \"satisfactory line between mental deficiency and those variations of temperament, intellect, and emotional balance.\" <i>Id.</i> at cmt. b(1).</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(5) Forces persons with disabilities to pay for the damage they do if they \"are to live in the world.\" <i>Id.</i> at cmt. b(3). The Restatement adds that it is better that the assets, if any, of the one with the mental deficiency be used \"to compensate innocent victims than that [the assets] remain in their hands.\" <i>Id.</i> A discussion draft for the Restatement (Third) of Torts rephrases this policy rationale and concludes: \"[I]f a person is suffering from a mental disorder so serious as to make it likely that the person will engage in substandard conduct that threatens the safety of others, there can be doubts as to whether this person should be allowed to engage in the normal range of society's activities; given these doubts, there is nothing especially harsh in at least holding the person responsible for the harms the person may cause by substandard conduct.\" Restatement (Third) of Torts § 9 cmt. e (Discussion Draft April 5, 1999).<sup>[6]</sup></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D</h2>\n<p>To assist in deciding whether Indiana should adopt the generally accepted rule, we turn to an examination of contemporary public policy in Indiana as embodied in enactments of our state legislature. <i>See </i><i>Schornick v.

We hold that a person with mental disabilities is generally held to the same standard of care as that of a reasonable person under the same circumstances without regard to the alleged tortfeasor's capacity to control or <span class=\"star-pagination\">*667</span> understand the consequences of his or her actions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>We turn now to the question of whether the circumstances of Rusk's case are such that the general duty of care imposed upon adults with mental disabilities should be found to run from him to Creasy.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>In asking this question, we recognize that exceptions to the general rule will arise where the factual circumstances negate the factors supporting imposition of a dutyparticularly with respect to the nature of the parties' relationship and public policy considerations. For example, courts in jurisdictions that apply the reasonable person standard to individuals with mental disabilities have uniformly held that Alzheimer's patients who have no capacity to control their conduct do not owe a duty to their caregivers to refrain from violent conduct because the factual circumstances negate the policy rationales behind the presumption of liability. <i>See </i><i>Colman v.

Jarvis,</i> 575 N.E.2d at 995 (balancing three factors to determine whether an individual owes a duty to another: (1) the relationship between the parties; (2) the reasonable foreseeability of harm to the person injured; and (3) public policy concerns).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B-1</h2>\n<p>Unlike the typical victim supporting the Restatement rationale, Creasy was not a member of the public at large, unable to anticipate or safeguard against the harm she encountered. Creasy knew of Rusk's violent history. She could have changed her course of action or requested additional assistance when she recognized Rusk's state of mind on the evening when she received the alleged injury. Rusk's inability to comprehend the circumstances of his relationship with Creasy and others was the very reason Creasy was employed to support Rusk. The nursing home and Creasy, through the nursing home, were \"employed to encounter, and knowingly did encounter, just the dangers which injured\" Creasy. <i>Id.</i> at 276. In fact, caregivers and their employers under these circumstances are better positioned to prevent caregiver injury and to protect <span class=\"star-pagination\">*668</span> against risks faced as a result of job responsibilities. In Indiana, the workers' compensation system, not the tort system, exists to cover such employment-related losses. To the extent that the workers' compensation system is inadequate as Creasy asserts, the inadequacy reflects defects in the workers' compensation system and is not a ground for alternative recovery under tort law.</p>\n<p>An analogous situation arises in Indiana law under the fireman's rule. The \"fireman's rule provides that firemen [or other public safety officials] responding in emergencies are owed only the duty of abstaining from positive wrongful acts.\" <i>Heck v. Robey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1980757\"><a href=\"/opinion/1980757/heck-v-robey/\"><span class=\"volume\">659</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">498</span></a></span>, 501 (Ind. 1995); <i>see also </i><i>Sam v.

Public safety officials and caregivers such as Creasy are similarly situated in that they are \"specifically hired to encounter and combat particular dangers,\" and by accepting such employment assume the risks associated with their respective occupations.<sup>[10]</sup><i>Anicet,</i> 580 So.2d at 276.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B-2</h2>\n<p><i>Public Policy Concerns.</i> The first rationale behind the Restatement rule justifies imposing a duty on a defendant with a mental disability where it seems unfair to force a plaintiff who did not contribute to the cause of his or her injury to bear the cost of that injury. This policy concern overlaps with the relationship analysis set forth <i>supra.</i> The nature of Creasy and Rusk's relationship was such that Creasy cannot be \"presumed not to have assumed risks . . . with respect to the cause of the injury.\" See Rationale (1), <i>supra,</i> Part I-C. Therefore, imposing a duty on Rusk in this circumstance is not justified by the first Restatement policy rationale.</p>\n<p>The second Restatement policy rationale creates an inducement for those responsible for a person with a mental disability to prevent harm to others. By placing Rusk in a nursing home, we presume Rusk's wife made a difficult decision based on her desire to prevent Rusk from being violent and harming himself, herself, or others. Without endorsing the incentives for confinement arguably fostered by the Restatement rationale, we agree with the conclusion set forth by the Wisconsin Supreme Court in <i>Gould</i> that a family member who places a relative in a long-term care facility, institution, nursing home, or similarly restrictive environment is unlikely to need further inducement to restrain the one for whom they are responsible. <i>See </i><i>Gould,</i> 543 N.W.2d at 287. Mrs. Rusk entrusted her husband's care, including prevention of the harm he might bring to others, to the nursing home staff and the nursing home. And as a business enterprise, the nursing home received compensation for its services.</p>\n<p>With respect to the third policy rationale, \"it is virtually impossible to imagine circumstances under which a person would feign the symptoms of mental disability and subject themselves to commitment to an institution in order to avoid some future civil liability.\" <i>Id.</i>; <i>see also</i> Rationale (3), <i>supra,</i> Part I-C. To the extent that such circumstances exist, there is no evidence whatsoever that they are present under the facts in this case.</p>\n<p>Finally, there are no administrative difficulties in this case with respect to determining the degree and existence of Rusk's mental disability.<sup>[11]</sup> Under the relationship <span class=\"star-pagination\">*669</span> analysis set forth above and the present policy analysis, it is unnecessary to determine the degree of Rusk's mental disability. We need only conclude that Rusk had a mental disability which served as the reason for his presence in the nursing home and the foundation of his relationship with Creasy.</p>\n<p>We agree with Judge Friedlander, <i>see </i><i>Creasy,</i> 696 N.E.2d at 450-51 (dissenting), that there was no material question of fact as to the existence, let alone the advanced stage, of Rusk's Alzheimer's disease and his inability to appreciate or control his violent behavior. Rusk was admitted to the nursing home because he was confused and suffering from memory loss such that his wife could not care for him. By May 1995, when Creasy was injured by Rusk, Rusk had been a resident of the nursing home for three years and his condition had deteriorated. He regularly displayed behaviors characteristic of a person with advanced Alzheimer's disease such as aggression, belligerence, and violence. As evidence of Rusk's state of mind, Rusk presented an affidavit from Sharon Ayres stating that Rusk was in the advanced stage of Alzheimer's and was therefore unable to appreciate the consequences of his actions. The Court of Appeals rejected Ayres's statement on the ground that nothing in the affidavit qualified Ayres as an expert witness. We disagree.</p>\n<p>Ayres was a licensed practical nurse employed by the nursing home at the time Creasy was injured. She had worked for the nursing home for approximately nine years. Indiana Evidence Rule 702 provides that a witness may be qualified as an expert by virtue of \"knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education.\" Only one characteristic is necessary to qualify an individual as an expert. <i>See </i><i>Fleener v.

Therefore, an affiant may qualify as an expert on the basis of practical experience alone. <i>See </i><i>Fowler v.

It is within the trial court's sound discretion to decide whether a person qualifies as an expert witness and we will reverse only upon a showing that the trial court abused its discretion. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Ayres's affidavit states that she is a licensed practical nurse, which presumes that she received the medical training necessary to obtain that license. The affidavit also verifies that Ayres had worked for the nursing home for nine years at the time Creasy was injuredthe entire time Rusk had lived there. Ayres's certification, associated training, practical experience gained through working for the nursing home for nine years, and three years of working with Rusk qualified her as an expert for purposes of assessing Rusk's mental state and rendering an opinion. We find that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to Rusk's mental capacity. Rusk was in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's and was unable to control or appreciate the consequences of his actions.</p>\n<p>In addition to the public policy concerns behind the Restatement rule, we find that it would be contrary to public policy to hold Rusk to a duty to Creasy when it would place \"too great a burden on him because his disorientation and potential for violence is the very reason he was institutionalized and needed the aid of employed caretakers.\" <i>Gould,</i> 543 N.W.2d at 286.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*670</span> C</h2>\n<p>Rusk was entitled to summary judgment because public policy and the nature of the relationship between Rusk, Creasy, and the nursing home preclude holding that Rusk owed a duty of care to Creasy under these factual circumstances.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Conclusion</i></h2>\n<p>Having previously granted transfer, thereby vacating the opinion of the Court of Appeals pursuant to Ind. Appellate Rule 11(B)(3), we now affirm the trial court, finding that Rusk did not owe a duty to Creasy, and grant Rusk's motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p>SHEPARD, C.J., and BOEHM and RUCKER, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p>DICKSON, J., concurring and dissenting.</p>\n<p>DICKSON, Justice, concurring and dissenting</p>\n<p>I concur with Part I but dissent to Part II of the majority opinion. Citing sound legal and policy grounds, the majority holds in Part I that a person with a mental disability is generally held to an ordinary standard of legal responsibility without regard to the person's capacity to control or understand the consequences of his or her actions. But it concludes the opposite in Part II, finding as a matter of law that, because of this defendant's impaired mental condition, he had no general duty of reasonable care and is not responsible for the injuries he inflicted. Thus, notwithstanding its recognition that an impaired person remains legally accountable for injuries caused to innocent victims, the majority holds as a matter of law that the rule announced in Part I should not apply in this case primarily because of the relationship of the assailant to the victim, the extent to which the victim may have assumed the risk of injury, and the assailant's inability to control or appreciate the consequences of his actions. I disagree.</p>\n<p>The majority supports its determination by analogy to the fireman's rule: \"`The rule basically provides that professionals, whose occupations by nature expose them to particular risks, may not hold another negligent for creating the situation to which they respond in their professional capacity.'\" <i>Heck v. Robey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1980757\"><a href=\"/opinion/1980757/heck-v-robey/\"><span class=\"volume\">659</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">498</span></a></span>, 503 (Ind.1995) (quoting <i>Koehn v.

Drawing upon this analogy, the majority states that caregivers such as the plaintiff are similarly situated to the public safety officials to whom the fireman's rule applies. 730 N.E.2d at 668. The majority suggests that the plaintiff assumed the risks created by caring for people with Alzheimer's disease when she chose to work in the nursing home.</p>\n<p>We have, however, previously rejected such reasoning, refusing to use a person's occupation as a basis for finding a lack of duty. In <i>Heck,</i> this Court rejected a similar determination by the Court of Appeals that the plaintiff, a paramedic, had \"<i>impliedly</i> assumed the risk of injury in the primary sense, based upon his choice of occupation.\" 659 N.E.2d at 505. We declined to extend the rationale of the fireman's rule to a paramedica paid public employee whose job was to rescue people. We said:</p>\n<blockquote>We reject this primary assumption-of-risk terminology to the extent that it suggests that a lack of duty may stem from a plaintiff's incurred risk. Under the [Comparative Fault] Act, a plaintiff may relieve a defendant of what would otherwise be his or her duty to the plaintiff only by an express consent.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 505. <i>See also id.</i> at 502 n. 3 (\"[T]he fireman's rule can no longer be based upon an assumption-of-risk rationale.\"). This Court ultimately refused to apply \"[a]ny rule that purports to effect an absolute defense based upon incurred risk\" because it is contrary to our comparative fault system. <i>Id.</i> at 505 (declining to address the continuing viability of the fireman's rule, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*671</span> but refusing to extend it to bar an action by a paramedic).</p>\n<p>In support of its determination, the majority cites other states that have refused to impose a duty based upon similar facts, but these states have adopted their rules based upon assumption of risk and analogies to the fireman's rule. <i>See </i><i>Gould v.

Although <i>Heck</i> acknowledged that a court may determine that no duty exists based upon the factors set forth in <i>Webb v. Jarvis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2101759\"><a href=\"/opinion/2101759/webb-v-jarvis/\"><span class=\"volume\">575</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">992</span></a></span> (Ind.1991), <i>see </i><i>Heck,</i> 659 N.E.2d at 505 n. 11, we did not intend that the analysis of incurred risk that we rejected in considering the fireman's rule would simply be re-incorporated into the <i>Webb</i> analysis.</p>\n<p>Also in <i>Heck,</i> this Court expressed Indiana's public policy regarding the protection of plaintiffs who are injured in the course of their professional care for others when we held that a plaintiff's assumption of risk may not be inferred from his profession and may only serve as a bar to recovery when he has given express consent. 659 N.E.2d at 503-05. Accordingly, under Indiana's public policy, neither the plaintiff's choice of occupation nor the defendant's use of her services supports a finding that the defendant had no duty, as a matter of law.</p>\n<p>I cannot agree with the majority's determination that the plaintiff's superior knowledge of the risks of her employment supports its finding that the defendant owed the plaintiff no duty of care. I disagree with the majority's reliance upon a plaintiff's superior knowledge of the risk as a basis for evaluating the question of duty. If extended to other cases, this rationale could subvert existing principles of responsibility fostered by tort law. Under such an approach, for example, high school teachers might be deprived of recourse for injuries inflicted by mentally or emotionally disabled high school students, or perhaps even students without such disabilities, because of the teachers' superior knowledge of the risks presented by such students. Similarly, health care personnel who care for patientseven those without mental disabilitiescould be barred from remedy for injuries caused by such patients because the caregiver could be found to have superior knowledge of the risks of providing direct care in a hospital, and thus there could be no duty of care owed by the patient. It is not only unfair but also extremely unwise social policy to deprive, as a matter of law, such professionals of the tort remedy to which other victims of negligence are entitled.</p>\n<p>In <i>Douglass v. Irvin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2230601\"><a href=\"/opinion/2230601/douglass-v-irvin/\"><span class=\"volume\">549</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">368</span></a></span>, 371 (Ind.1990), although a premises liability case, this Court expressly repudiated <span class=\"star-pagination\">*672</span> the consideration of \"equal or superior knowledge\" in determining the issue of duty and limited its evaluation to the issue of breach of duty. As we noted in <i>Douglass</i>:</p>\n<blockquote>If a duty of care exists, the determination of whether a breach of duty occurred is a factual question requiring an evaluation of the landowner's conduct with respect to the requisite standard of care. It is in this factual assessment that the issue of the landowner's and the invitee's comparative knowledge becomes relevant.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 370. This principle is equally applicable in the present case.</p>\n<p>The majority correctly determined the issue of duty in Part I of its opinion, holding that a patient owes a duty of reasonable care under the circumstances and that a patient with a mental disease has the same duty of reasonable care. But in Part II it then reverses itself and fails to apply this rule to the defendant, exempting him from this principle of responsibility. Such individualized determinations of relative fault are not properly matters of law for determination by courts, but rather issues of fact for determination by juries. The plaintiff's incurred risk, if any, should be considered by a jury when it allocates fault under the Comparative Fault Act. IND.CODE §§ 34-51-2-7 &amp; 34-51-2-8.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, I concur in the majority's holding in Part I that a person with a mental disability owes a duty of reasonable care. But I dissent to the majority's conclusion in Part II that discriminates against caregivers and deprives them of fair recourse for injuries inflicted by a person with advanced Alzheimer's disease.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  <i>See also</i> Restatement (Third) of Torts § 9(c) (Discussion Draft Apr. 5, 1999); <i>Johnson v.

Ellis, <i>Tort Responsibility of Mentally Disabled Persons,</i> 1981 Am. B. Found. Res. J. 1079, 1079-80 (1981). One legal scholar has noted: \"The legislative goal of `integrating' people with disabilities into society will never be fully accomplished unless tort law reflects a view that those people have a right to live in the world. Courts should require not only that people with disabilities take precautions for their own protection, but that society acknowledge their existence and make accommodations for them.\" Adam A. Milani, <i>Living in the World: A New Look at the Disabled in the Law of Torts,</i> 48 Cath. U.L.Rev. 323, 417 (1999). Other state courts have cited integration policies as the foundation for their tort law decisions. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Vaughn v. Northwest Airlines, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2045616\"><a href=\"/opinion/2045616/vaughn-v-northwest-airlines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">558</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">736</span></a></span>, 744 (Minn.1997) (finding that integration policy found in legislation making public accommodations accessible to people with disabilities could be incorporated in the common law as the result of \"accumulated experience\" and as common law rules are \"carefully crafted both to reflect our traditions as a state and to address emerging societal needs\").</p>\n<p>[10]  In <i>Heck v. Robey</i><i>,</i> we concluded that the concept of incurred risk as embodied in the fireman's rule exception to the rescue doctrine was subsumed by Indiana's comparative fault scheme. <i>See</i> 659 N.E.2d at 505. However, we recognized that not every such case will go to trial: \"A defendant will prevail at summary judgment if the plaintiff expressly assumed the risks of the activity and agreed to hold the defendant harmless . . . or <i>if the defendant otherwise had no duty to the plaintiff.\" Id.</i> (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>[11]  Many legal scholars have questioned the significance of the \"administrative difficulties and judicial efficiency\" policy rationale behind the Restatement rule. They argue that our legal system regularly entrusts judges and juries as fact-finders to make difficult determinations about mental competence for a range of legal issues (e.g., guardianship, contract and testamentary capacity, criminal proceedings, contributory negligence allocations in tort claims, and commitment hearings) because fact-finders are uniquely positioned to weigh evidence, judge credibility, assess witness testimony, and apply the law thereto. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Ellis, <i>supra,</i> note 9, at 1089; Wm. B. Hornblower, <i>Insanity and the Law of Negligence,</i> 5 Colum.L.Rev. 278, 283 (1905); Light, <i>supra</i> note 8, at 388 (\"Such determinations [regarding mental competence] have proceeded without undue strain on the courts.\").</p>\n\n</div>",
