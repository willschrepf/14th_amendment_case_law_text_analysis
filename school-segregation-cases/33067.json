BRADLEY SMITH\n\n                    Appeal by Permission from the Court of Appeals\n                        Chancery Court for McNairy County\n                      No. 8710    William C. Cole, Chancellor\n\n\n               No. W2011-00194-SC-R11-CV - Filed November 16, 2012\n\n\nThis appeal involves the efforts of a grandmother to obtain court-ordered visitation with her\ngranddaughter in accordance with Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-306 (2010). Shortly after the\ndeath of her daughter, the grandmother filed a petition in the Chancery Court for McNairy\nCounty seeking visitation with her granddaughter. Following a two-day hearing, the trial\ncourt denied the grandmother’s request for visitation because she had failed to prove the\nstatutory grounds necessary to permit a court to order grandparental visitation over a parent’s\nobjection. The grandmother did not appeal this decision. After the decision became final,\nthe Tennessee General Assembly amended the burden of persuasion in the grandparental\nvisitation statute by creating a new rebuttable presumption that a child whose parent dies will\nbe substantially harmed by the cessation of an existing relationship with a grandparent who\nis the parent of the deceased parent. Without alleging new facts and relying solely on the\nchange in the statutory burden of persuasion, the grandmother filed a second petition in the\ntrial court seeking visitation with her granddaughter. The trial court granted the child’s\nfather’s motion to dismiss on the ground of res judicata. The Court of Appeals affirmed the\ntrial court’s order. Jackson v. Smith, No. W2011-00194-COA-R3-CV, 2011 WL 3963589\n(Tenn. Ct. App. Sept. 9, 2011). We granted the grandmother’s application for permission to\nappeal to determine whether the intervening change in the burden of persuasion in the\ngrandparental visitation statute provided an exception to the operation of the res judicata\ndoctrine. We have determined that it does not and that, without some material change in the\nfacts, the doctrine of res judicata bars relitigation of the grandmother’s petition for\ngrandparental visitation.\n\n    Tenn. R. App. P. 11 Appeal by Permission; Judgment of the Court of Appeals\n                                     Affirmed\n\nW ILLIAM C. K OCH, J R., J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which G ARY R. W ADE, C.J.,\nJ ANICE M. H OLDER, C ORNELIA A. C LARK, and S HARON G. L EE, JJ., joined.\n\fAndrea D. Sipes, Matthew E.

Hopper, Savannah, Tennessee, for the appellee, Bradley Smith.\n\n                                                 OPINION\n\n                                                       I.\n\n       Bradley Smith and Stephanie Smith were married and made their home in Corinth,\nMississippi. In November 2006, Ms. Smith gave birth to a daughter. The child lived with\nboth parents until August 2008. From August 2008 to February 2009, the child was in the\ncustody of Ms. Smith in Burnsville, Mississippi. In February 2009, the child went to live\nwith Mr. Smith in McNairy County, Tennessee. Two months later, on April 8, 2009, Ms.\nSmith died unexpectedly. Following her daughter’s death, Jeanette Jackson, a resident of\nAlabama, requested visitation with her granddaughter on several occasions. Eventually, Mr.\nSmith declined to permit Ms. Jackson to visit her granddaughter.\n\n        On April 27, 2009, Ms. Jackson filed a petition in the Chancery Court for McNairy\nCounty seeking visitation with her granddaughter in accordance with Tennessee’s\ngrandparental visitation statute (“2009 petition”).1 At that time, the statute required\ngrandparents seeking visitation with a grandchild, despite the child’s parent’s objection, to\nprove (1) that they had a significant existing relationship with their grandchild,2 (2) that the\nchild was likely to suffer severe emotional harm or other direct and substantial harm by the\nloss of the relationship with the grandparent,3 and (3) that permitting grandparental visitation\nwould be in the child’s best interests.4\n\n      Following a two-day hearing, the trial court found that Ms. Jackson had visited her\ngranddaughter frequently before Ms. Smith’s death.5 However, on October 2, 2009, the trial\n\n\n         1\n             In 2009, the grandparental visitation statute was codified at Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-306 (Supp.\n2007).\n         2\n             Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-306(b)(1)(A).\n         3\n             Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-306(b)(1)(A), (C).\n         4\n             Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-306(c).\n         5\n        The parties have not included any portion of the record relating to the 2009 petition in this record.\nHowever, Mr. Smith has not taken issue with Ms. Jackson’s assertion that the trial court “had previously\nfound that the Petitioner had frequent visitation with the subject child for a period of not less than one (1)\n                                                                                                (continued...)\n\n                                                      -2-\n\fcourt entered an order finding that Ms. Jackson had failed to prove that the cessation of her\nrelationship with her granddaughter was likely to cause the child severe emotional harm or\npresent a danger of other direct and substantial harm to the child. Ms. Jackson did not appeal\nthis decision, and so the trial court’s October 2, 2009 order became final.\n\n       During its 2010 session, the Tennessee General Assembly amended Tenn. Code Ann.\n§ 36-6-306 to create a new “rebuttable presumption of substantial harm to the child based\nupon the cessation of the relationship between the child and grandparent” when the child’s\nparent is deceased and the grandparent seeking visitation is the parent of the deceased\nparent.6 Ms. Jackson and her lawyer played a prominent role in the General Assembly’s\nadoption of this amendment.\n\n        The new rebuttable presumption in Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-306(b)(4) took effect on\nMay 26, 2010. On July 9, 2010, Ms. Jackson filed a second petition for grandparental\nvisitation in the Chancery Court for McNairy County (“2010 petition”). This petition did not\nallege any facts regarding the child, Mr. Smith, or Ms. Jackson that had not been alleged in\nMs. Jackson’s 2009 petition. However, the petition alleged that “[t]here now exists a\nrebuttable presumption of substantial harm to the child based upon the cessation of the\nrelationship between the subject child and the Petitioner, pursuant to T.C.A. § 36-6-306, as\namended by Public Chapter 957 of the Public Acts of 2010.”\n\n       On August 9, 2010, Mr. Smith filed a motion to dismiss Ms. Jackson’s 2010 petition\non the ground that the trial court’s final disposition of her 2009 petition on the merits\nprecluded her from relitigating her grandparental visitation claim in the absence of a material\nchange in the child’s circumstances. Ms. Jackson filed a response to Mr. Smith’s motion on\nOctober 14, 2010, in which she agreed that her 2009 petition had been fully litigated and that\nthe judgment entered on October 2, 2009, was a final judgment. However, she insisted that\nTenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-306(b)(4) amounted to a substantial change in the law and,\ntherefore, that the doctrine of res judicata did not prohibit her from relitigating her request\nfor grandparental visitation based on facts that had already been fully adjudicated by the\ncourt just one year earlier.\n\n       Following a hearing, the trial court entered an order on November 8, 2010, granting\nMr. Smith’s motion to dismiss. The trial court stated that the evidence Ms. Jackson\npresented to support her 2009 petition had failed to establish a danger of substantial harm to\nher granddaughter if visitation were discontinued. While the trial court noted the 2010\n\n         5\n             (...continued)\nyear.”\n         6\n        Act of May 6, 2010, ch. 957, § 1, 2010 Tenn. Pub. Acts 482, 482 (codified at Tenn. Code Ann. §\n36-6-306(b)(4) (2010)).\n\n                                                 -3-\n\fadoption of Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-306(b)(4), it concluded that res judicata barred the 2010\npetition because Ms. Jackson did not dispute “the validity and finality” of its October 2, 2009\njudgment.\n\n       Ms. Jackson appealed the dismissal of her 2010 petition to the Court of Appeals. The\nappellate court’s September 9, 2011 opinion did not definitively decide whether the 2010\nenactment of Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-306(b)(4) required the courts to make an exception to\nthe customary operation of the doctrine of res judicata. After considering the “facts of this\ncase” and the “nature of the statutory enactment,” the court decided that “the doctrine of res\njudicata may be applied in this case.” Jackson v. Smith, No. W2011-00194-COA-R3-CV,\n2011 WL 3963589, at *8 (Tenn. Ct. App. Sept. 9, 2011). However, the court declined to\nreview the trial court’s decision that the doctrine of res judicata should be applied in this case\nbecause Ms. Jackson’s failure “to meet her burden to provide an adequate record in this case”\nprevented the court from conducting “a meaningful review of the question of whether the\nFirst Order [the order entered on October 2, 2009] was final from a technical standpoint.”\nJackson v. Smith, 2011 WL 3963589, at *11.\n\n                                               II.\n\n       As a threshold matter, we turn to the question of whether the record is sufficient to\nenable the appellate courts to determine whether the doctrine of res judicata bars Ms.\nJackson’s 2010 petition seeking visitation with her granddaughter. The Court of Appeals\ndetermined that the record is fatally deficient because it does not contain a copy of the trial\ncourt’s October 2, 2009 order. The appellate court reasoned that it could not determine\nwhether this order satisfied the “technical requirements for finality of orders” without a copy\nof the order in the record. We share the Court of Appeals’ concern regarding the parties’\nnonchalant approach to preserving an appellate record that contains a “fair, accurate and\ncomplete account of what transpired with respect to those issues that are the bases of appeal.”\nTenn. R. App. P. 24(a). However, we have determined that Ms. Jackson’s concessions\nregarding the proceedings relating to her 2009 petition and the October 2, 2009 order cure\nthese deficiencies and provide the appellate courts with a sufficient foundation for deciding\nwhether the enactment of Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-306(b)(4) saves Ms. Jackson’s 2010\npetition from the customary operation of the doctrine of res judicata.\n\n                                               A.\n\n        The doctrine of res judicata or claim preclusion bars a second suit between the same\nparties or their privies on the same claim with respect to all issues which were, or could have\nbeen, litigated in the former suit. Creech v. Addington, 281 S.W.3d 363, 376 (Tenn. 2009);\nRichardson v. Tennessee Bd. of Dentistry, 913 S.W.2d 446, 459 (Tenn. 1995) (quoting Goeke\nv. Woods, 777 S.W.2d 347, 349 (Tenn. 1989)). It is a “rule of rest,” Moulton v. Ford Motor\n\n\n                                               -4-\n\fCo., 533 S.W.2d 295, 296 (Tenn. 1976), and it promotes finality in litigation, prevents\ninconsistent or contradictory judgments, conserves judicial resources, and protects litigants\nfrom the cost and vexation of multiple lawsuits. In re Estate of Boote, 198 S.W.3d 699, 718\n(Tenn. Ct. App. 2005); Sweatt v. Tennessee Dep’t of Corr., 88 S.W.3d 567, 570 (Tenn. Ct.\nApp. 2002).\n\n        The party asserting a defense predicated on res judicata or claim preclusion must\ndemonstrate (1) that the underlying judgment was rendered by a court of competent\njurisdiction, (2) that the same parties or their privies were involved in both suits, (3) that the\nsame claim or cause of action was asserted in both suits, and (4) that the underlying judgment\nwas final and on the merits. Lien v. Couch, 993 S.W.2d 53, 56 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1998); see\nalso Lee v. Hall, 790 S.W.2d 293, 294 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1990). A trial court’s decision that\na claim is barred by the doctrine of res judicata or claim preclusion involves a question of law\nwhich will be reviewed de novo on appeal without a presumption of correctness. In re Estate\nof Boote, 198 S.W.3d at 719.\n\n       Res judicata is one of the affirmative defenses that must be included in the\ndefendant’s answer. Tenn. R. Civ. P. 8.03. However, in appropriate circumstances, it may\nbe raised in a Tenn. R. Civ. P. 12.02(6) motion. For a Tenn. R. Civ. P. 12.02(6) motion to\nbe used as a vehicle to assert an affirmative defense, the applicability of the defense must\n“clearly and unequivocally appear[ ] on the face of the complaint.” Givens v. Mullikin ex rel.\nEstate of McElwaney, 75 S.W.3d 383, 404 (Tenn. 2002) (quoting Anthony v. Tidwell, 560\nS.W.2d 908, 909 (Tenn. 1972)).7 In other words, the plaintiff’s own allegations in the\ncomplaint must show that an affirmative defense exists and that this defense legally defeats\nthe claim for relief. See Ragsdale v. Hill, 37 Tenn. App. 671, 681, 269 S.W.2d 911, 916\n(1954) (holding that a demurrer asserting res judicata was improper when the petition being\nchallenged did not mention the prior decree); see also 5B Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R.\nMiller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1357, at 713-14 (3d ed. 2004).8\n\n\n\n\n        7\n         The contrary holding in Usrey v. Lewis, 553 S.W.2d 612, 614 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1977) was not\nexpressly overruled in Anthony v. Tidwell or Givens v. Mullikin ex rel. Estate of McElwaney. We expressly\noverrule it now.\n        8\n         Many of our procedural rules have been derived from federal procedural rules. Accordingly, we\nhave often considered the federal courts’ interpretations of the federal rules when we have been called upon\nto construe our own rules. See Thomas v. Oldfield, 279 S.W.3d 259, 262 n.3 (Tenn. 2009); Cumulus Broad.,\nInc. v. Shim, 226 S.W.3d 366, 375 (Tenn. 2007). While we are not bound by the federal courts’\ninterpretations of the federal rules, see Knox Cnty. ex rel. Envtl. Termite & Pest Control, Inc. v. Arrow\nExterminators, Inc., 350 S.W.3d 511, 524 (Tenn. 2011); Webb v. Nashville Area Habitat for Humanity, Inc.,\n346 S.W.3d 422, 437 (Tenn. 2011), we may seek helpful guidance from these interpretations when we are\nconstruing and applying our own rules.\n\n                                                    -5-\n\f                                                      B.\n\n        Ms. Jackson’s 2010 petition–which is included in the appellate record–contains no\nallegations that would give rise to a res judicata defense. It does not mention or even allude\nto Ms. Jackson’s 2009 petition.9 While Mr. Smith’s motion to dismiss includes the details\nof the litigation relating to Ms. Jackson’s 2009 petition, Mr. Smith did not file copies of the\nOctober 2, 2009 order or any other portions of the record of the 2009 proceedings along with\nhis motion.10\n\n       Without more, the trial court could have denied Mr. Smith’s motion to dismiss, had\nMs. Jackson requested the court to do so. However, prior to the hearing on the motion, Ms.\nJackson filed a response that cured all the procedural shortcomings in Mr. Smith’s motion.\nIn her response, Ms. Jackson agreed (1) that her 2010 petition was the second petition for\ngrandparental visitation she had filed; (2) that the trial court had conducted a hearing\nregarding her former petition; (3) that the trial court had issued an opinion and final judgment\nwith regard to the former petition finding no evidence demonstrating that the loss of her\ngranddaughter’s relationship with Ms. Jackson would cause severe emotional harm or present\nthe danger of other direct and substantial harm to the child; and (4) that all findings of facts\nmade by the trial court in its opinion and judgment were res judicata.\n\n       Based on the concessions in Ms. Jackson’s response to the motion to dismiss and the\nstatements of her lawyer during the hearing on the motion to dismiss, the trial court found\nthat Ms. Jackson “does not dispute the validity and finality of this Court’s previous order.”\nMs. Jackson has not taken issue with this finding either in the Court of Appeals or in this\nCourt.\n\n       We respectfully disagree with the Court of Appeals’ conclusion that the record is\ninsufficient to enable the appellate courts to decide whether the doctrine of res judicata bars\nMs. Jackson’s 2010 petition seeking grandparental visitation. In light of Ms. Jackson’s\n\n\n        9\n          However, Ms. Jackson’s 2010 petition discloses a dependent and neglect action that Ms. Jackson\nfiled in the McNairy County Juvenile Court against her daughter and son-in-law.\n        10\n           A party asserting a res judicata defense may generally prove its defense with a copy of the\njudgment in the former proceeding. However, if the judgment leaves any of the elements of the defense\nuncertain, the party asserting the defense must provide additional evidence. Garrett v. Corry Foam Prods.,\nInc., 596 S.W.2d 808, 809 (Tenn. 1980). In other circumstances, the Court of Appeals has stated that parties\nasserting a res judicata defense “must generally put in evidence the record or a copy of the record of the\nformer case.” Gregory v. Gregory, 803 S.W.2d 242, 244 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1990); see also American Nat’l\nBank v. Bradford, 28 Tenn. App. 239, 250, 188 S.W.2d 971, 976 (1945). While parties asserting a res\njudicata defense may introduce a copy of the entire record of the prior proceedings to support their motion\nto dismiss, they are required to introduce only those portions of the record that are necessary to establish the\napplication of the doctrine of res judicata.\n\n                                                      -6-\n\fconcessions, the record contains ample basis for concluding: (1) that the October 2, 2009\norder was rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction; (2) that the 2009 petition and the\n2010 petition involve the same parties; (3) that the 2009 petition and the 2010 petition assert\nthe same claim; (4) that the October 2, 2009 judgment was on the merits; (5) that the October\n2, 2009 order was a final judgment; and (6) that the October 2, 2009 order was properly\nentered.\n\n                                                   III.\n\n        Ms. Jackson’s principal argument on this appeal is that the Court of Appeals erred by\nfailing to hold that the 2010 enactment of Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-306(b)(4) undermined the\npreclusive effect of the trial court’s October 2, 2009 judgment. She insists that, based solely\non the change in the law, she may file a second petition seeking grandparental visitation with\nher granddaughter, even though the material facts have not changed. We respectfully\ndisagree for two reasons.\n\n        First, the general rule, recognized throughout this nation, is that a change in the law\noccurring after a final judgment ordinarily does not create an exception to the application of\nthe doctrine of res judicata or claim preclusion. Moulton v. Ford Motor Co., 533 S.W.2d at\n297 (applying res judicata despite an intervening change in decisional law); see also\nPrecision Air Parts, Inc. v. Avco Corp., 736 F.2d 1499, 1503 (11th Cir. 1984); 18 Charles\nAlan Wright et al., Federal Practice and Procedure § 4415, at 369 (2d ed. 2002) (“18\nFederal Practice and Procedure”). Accordingly, the enactment of a new statute after the\nprevious litigation has been finally concluded will ordinarily not provide a basis for\nrelitigating the same dispute. See 18 James Wm. Moore et al., Moore’s Federal Practice §§\n131.21[2], 131.22[3] (3d ed. 2009) (“18 Moore’s Federal Practice”).\n\n        The courts have declined to recognize a broad “general fairness” exception to the\ndoctrine of res judicata when there is a subsequent change in the law. See Roche Palo Alto\nLLC v. Apotex, Inc., 531 F.3d 1372, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2008); 18 Federal Practice and\nProcedure § 4415, at 379. However, on “rare occasions,” 11 the courts have recognized\nexceptions to the preclusive effect of a prior judgment following a change in the law. For\nexample, the courts have permitted a second action based on a new statute “when a new\nstatute provides an independent basis for relief which did not exist at the time of the prior\naction.” 18 Moore’s Federal Practice § 131.22[3]; see also State ex rel. Cihlar v. Crawford,\n39 S.W.3d 172, 178 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2000) (permitting a second lawsuit after the first lawsuit\nhad been dismissed for lack of standing). Similarly, the courts have relaxed the res judicata\ndoctrine in circumstances in which a party has been deprived of a fair opportunity to litigate\n\n\n\n       11\n            See 18 Moore’s Federal Practice § 131.22[3].\n\n                                                   -7-\n\fits claim. See Kremer v. Chemical Constr. Corp., 456 U.S. 461, 481 n.22 (1982); 18 Federal\nPractice and Procedure § 4415, at 351, 365-66.\n\n        In addition, the courts have declined to apply the res judicata doctrine when a dispute\ninvolved matters of special sensitivity. Matters of special sensitivity most often arise in cases\nof developing constitutional principles and issues of broad public importance. See Parnell\nv. Rapides Parish Sch. Bd., 563 F.2d 180, 185 (5th Cir. 1977) (declining to apply res judicata\nto a reapportionment suit lest the right to vote be applied differently in different locations);\nChristian v. Jemison, 303 F.2d 52, 54-55 (5th Cir. 1962) (declining to apply res judicata to\nsuit involving segregation issue in light of the intervening change effected by Brown v.\nBoard of Educ., 347 U.S. 483 (1954)). Also included are cases of continuing conduct, which\nitself strains the typical application of res judicata, involving substantial public policy\nconcerns, such as a suit to prevent continued environmental pollution. See 18 Moore’s\nFederal Practice § 131.22[3]; 18 Federal Practice and Procedure § 4415, at 372.\n\n       None of these exceptions are applicable in this case. Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-\n306(b)(4) did not provide Ms. Jackson with new grounds for seeking visitation with her\ngranddaughter. Ms. Jackson has never claimed that she was deprived of a full and fair\nopportunity to present and litigate her request for grandparental visitation in 2009. In\naddition, while Ms. Jackson’s desire to exercise visitation with her granddaughter is of great\nimportance to her, her claim does not involve the development of constitutional principles\nwith regard to matters of broad public importance.\n\n       The second basis for declining to interpret Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-306(b)(4) to\npermit Ms. Jackson to relitigate her request for grandparental visitation is the doctrine of\nseparation of powers reflected in Article II, Sections 1 and 2 of the Constitution of\nTennessee. The power to fully and finally adjudicate cases and controversies is\nconstitutionally assigned to the judiciary of this state, and the Tennessee General Assembly\nmay not interfere with the adjudicative functions of the courts. Lynch v. City of Jellico, 205\nS.W.3d 384, 393 (Tenn. 2006) (quoting Underwood v. State, 529 S.W.2d 45, 47 (Tenn.\n1975)).\n\n        The courts must decide the cases brought before them based on the law existing at the\ntime of their decisions and on the facts presented to them. Perkins v. Scales, 2 Tenn. Cas.\n(Shannon) 235, 236-37 (1877); Tate’s Ex’rs v. Bell, 12 Tenn. (4 Yer.) 202, 206-07 (1833).\nLitigants have a vested interest in a court’s judgment once it becomes final. Accordingly,\nacts of the Tennessee General Assembly are construed to operate prospectively in order to\navoid being found to be retrospective and therefore proscribed by Article I, Section 20 of the\nConstitution of Tennessee.\n\n\n\n\n                                               -8-\n\f        A final judgment is the judiciary’s last word in a particular case. Thus, as the United\nStates Supreme Court has held, “[h]aving achieved finality, . . . a judicial decision becomes\nthe last word of the judicial department with regard to a particular case or controversy, and\nCongress may not declare by retroactive legislation that the law applicable to that very case\nwas something other than what the courts said it was.” Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514\nU.S. 211, 227 (1995). We have an obligation to interpret statutes in a way that preserves\ntheir constitutionality. Jordan v. Knox Cnty., 213 S.W.3d 751, 780-81 (Tenn. 2007).\nAccordingly, we decline to interpret Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-306(b)(4) in a way that places\nit on a collision course with Article I, Section 20.\n\n        Ms. Jackson’s 2009 petition for visitation with her granddaughter was fully and fairly\nlitigated in accordance with existing law. Ms. Jackson was given every opportunity to\nintroduce the evidence required at that time to obtain visitation with her granddaughter.\nFollowing two days of hearings, the trial court determined that Ms. Jackson had failed to\nprove that her granddaughter would suffer severe emotional harm or other direct and\nsubstantial harm if she was no longer able to visit with Ms. Jackson. This judgment became\nfinal when Ms. Jackson elected not to appeal it. Accordingly, we decline to interpret Tenn.\nCode Ann. § 36-6-306(b)(4) to permit Ms. Jackson, in the absence of new facts occurring\nafter the entry of the October 2, 2009 judgment,12 to seek visitation with her granddaughter\npursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-306.\n\n                                                    IV.\n\n\n       We affirm the trial court’s dismissal of Ms. Jackson’s 2010 petition on the ground of\nres judicata. We remand the case to the trial court for whatever further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion may be required, and we tax the costs of this appeal to Jeanette\nRea Jackson and her surety for which execution, if necessary, may issue.\n\n\n                                                          ______________________________\n                                                          WILLIAM C. KOCH, JR., JUSTICE\n\n\n\n\n        12\n           The doctrine of res judicata does not prevent courts from reconsidering a claim when “the facts\nhave changed or new facts have occurred” that have altered the parties’ legal rights and obligations. Creech\nv. Addington, 281 S.W.3d at 381 (quoting Banks v. Banks, 18 Tenn. App. 347, 350, 77 S.W.2d 74, 76\n(1934)); White v. White, 876 S.W.2d 837, 839-40 (Tenn. 1994). These new facts must have occurred after\nthe first adjudication; they do not include newly discovered evidence of facts that existed prior to the\nadjudication. Regions Fin. Corp. v. Marsh USA, Inc., 310 S.W.3d 382, 394 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2009). A change\nin the law is not, as Ms. Jackson argues, a change in the facts.\n\n                                                    -9-\n\f",

Code Ann. § 36-6-306 (2010). Shortly after the\ndeath of her daughter, the grandmother filed a petition in the Chancery Court for McNairy\nCounty seeking visitation with her granddaughter. Following a two-day hearing, the trial\ncourt denied the grandmother’s request for visitation because she had failed to prove the\nstatutory grounds necessary to permit a court to order grandparental visitation over a parent’s\nobjection. The grandmother did not appeal this decision. After the decision became final,\nthe Tennessee General Assembly amended the burden of persuasion in the grandparental\nvisitation statute by creating a new rebuttable presumption that a child whose parent dies will\nbe substantially harmed by the cessation of an existing relationship with a grandparent who\nis the parent of the deceased parent. Without alleging new facts and relying solely on the\nchange in the statutory burden of persuasion, the grandmother filed a second petition in the\ntrial court seeking visitation with her granddaughter. The trial court granted the child’s\nfather’s motion to dismiss on the ground of res judicata. The Court of Appeals affirmed the\ntrial court’s order. Jackson v.

In November 2006, Ms. Smith gave birth to a daughter. The child lived with\nboth parents until August 2008. From August 2008 to February 2009, the child was in the\ncustody of Ms. Smith in Burnsville, Mississippi. In February 2009, the child went to live\nwith Mr. Smith in McNairy County, Tennessee. Two months later, on April 8, 2009, Ms.\nSmith died unexpectedly. Following her daughter’s death, Jeanette Jackson, a resident of\nAlabama, requested visitation with her granddaughter on several occasions. Eventually, Mr.\nSmith declined to permit Ms. Jackson to visit her granddaughter.\n\n        On April 27, 2009, Ms. Jackson filed a petition in the Chancery Court for McNairy\nCounty seeking visitation with her granddaughter in accordance with Tennessee’s\ngrandparental visitation statute (“2009 petition”).1 At that time, the statute required\ngrandparents seeking visitation with a grandchild, despite the child’s parent’s objection, to\nprove (1) that they had a significant existing relationship with their grandchild,2 (2) that the\nchild was likely to suffer severe emotional harm or other direct and substantial harm by the\nloss of the relationship with the grandparent,3 and (3) that permitting grandparental visitation\nwould be in the child’s best interests.4\n\n      Following a two-day hearing, the trial court found that Ms. Jackson had visited her\ngranddaughter frequently before Ms. Smith’s death.5 However, on October 2, 2009, the trial\n\n\n         1\n             In 2009, the grandparental visitation statute was codified at Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-306 (Supp.\n2007).\n         2\n             Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-306(b)(1)(A).\n         3\n             Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-306(b)(1)(A), (C).\n         4\n             Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-306(c).\n         5\n        The parties have not included any portion of the record relating to the 2009 petition in this record.\nHowever, Mr. Smith has not taken issue with Ms. Jackson’s assertion that the trial court “had previously\nfound that the Petitioner had frequent visitation with the subject child for a period of not less than one (1)\n                                                                                                (continued...)\n\n                                                      -2-\n\fcourt entered an order finding that Ms. Jackson had failed to prove that the cessation of her\nrelationship with her granddaughter was likely to cause the child severe emotional harm or\npresent a danger of other direct and substantial harm to the child. Ms. Jackson did not appeal\nthis decision, and so the trial court’s October 2, 2009 order became final.\n\n       During its 2010 session, the Tennessee General Assembly amended Tenn. Code Ann.\n§ 36-6-306 to create a new “rebuttable presumption of substantial harm to the child based\nupon the cessation of the relationship between the child and grandparent” when the child’s\nparent is deceased and the grandparent seeking visitation is the parent of the deceased\nparent.6 Ms. Jackson and her lawyer played a prominent role in the General Assembly’s\nadoption of this amendment.\n\n        The new rebuttable presumption in Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-306(b)(4) took effect on\nMay 26, 2010. On July 9, 2010, Ms. Jackson filed a second petition for grandparental\nvisitation in the Chancery Court for McNairy County (“2010 petition”). This petition did not\nallege any facts regarding the child, Mr. Smith, or Ms. Jackson that had not been alleged in\nMs. Jackson’s 2009 petition. However, the petition alleged that “[t]here now exists a\nrebuttable presumption of substantial harm to the child based upon the cessation of the\nrelationship between the subject child and the Petitioner, pursuant to T.C.A. § 36-6-306, as\namended by Public Chapter 957 of the Public Acts of 2010.”\n\n       On August 9, 2010, Mr. Smith filed a motion to dismiss Ms. Jackson’s 2010 petition\non the ground that the trial court’s final disposition of her 2009 petition on the merits\nprecluded her from relitigating her grandparental visitation claim in the absence of a material\nchange in the child’s circumstances. Ms. Jackson filed a response to Mr. Smith’s motion on\nOctober 14, 2010, in which she agreed that her 2009 petition had been fully litigated and that\nthe judgment entered on October 2, 2009, was a final judgment. However, she insisted that\nTenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-306(b)(4) amounted to a substantial change in the law and,\ntherefore, that the doctrine of res judicata did not prohibit her from relitigating her request\nfor grandparental visitation based on facts that had already been fully adjudicated by the\ncourt just one year earlier.\n\n       Following a hearing, the trial court entered an order on November 8, 2010, granting\nMr. Smith’s motion to dismiss. The trial court stated that the evidence Ms. Jackson\npresented to support her 2009 petition had failed to establish a danger of substantial harm to\nher granddaughter if visitation were discontinued. While the trial court noted the 2010\n\n         5\n             (...continued)\nyear.”\n         6\n        Act of May 6, 2010, ch. 957, § 1, 2010 Tenn. Pub. Acts 482, 482 (codified at Tenn. Code Ann. §\n36-6-306(b)(4) (2010)).\n\n                                                 -3-\n\fadoption of Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-306(b)(4), it concluded that res judicata barred the 2010\npetition because Ms. Jackson did not dispute “the validity and finality” of its October 2, 2009\njudgment.\n\n       Ms. Jackson appealed the dismissal of her 2010 petition to the Court of Appeals. The\nappellate court’s September 9, 2011 opinion did not definitively decide whether the 2010\nenactment of Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-306(b)(4) required the courts to make an exception to\nthe customary operation of the doctrine of res judicata. After considering the “facts of this\ncase” and the “nature of the statutory enactment,” the court decided that “the doctrine of res\njudicata may be applied in this case.” Jackson v. Smith, No. W2011-00194-COA-R3-CV,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3963589</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *8 (Tenn. Ct. App. Sept. 9, 2011). However, the court declined to\nreview the trial court’s decision that the doctrine of res judicata should be applied in this case\nbecause Ms. Jackson’s failure “to meet her burden to provide an adequate record in this case”\nprevented the court from conducting “a meaningful review of the question of whether the\nFirst Order [the order entered on October 2, 2009] was final from a technical standpoint.”\nJackson v. Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3963589</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *11.\n\n                                               II.\n\n       As a threshold matter, we turn to the question of whether the record is sufficient to\nenable the appellate courts to determine whether the doctrine of res judicata bars Ms.\nJackson’s 2010 petition seeking visitation with her granddaughter. The Court of Appeals\ndetermined that the record is fatally deficient because it does not contain a copy of the trial\ncourt’s October 2, 2009 order. The appellate court reasoned that it could not determine\nwhether this order satisfied the “technical requirements for finality of orders” without a copy\nof the order in the record. We share the Court of Appeals’ concern regarding the parties’\nnonchalant approach to preserving an appellate record that contains a “fair, accurate and\ncomplete account of what transpired with respect to those issues that are the bases of appeal.”\nTenn. R. App. P. 24(a). However, we have determined that Ms. Jackson’s concessions\nregarding the proceedings relating to her 2009 petition and the October 2, 2009 order cure\nthese deficiencies and provide the appellate courts with a sufficient foundation for deciding\nwhether the enactment of Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-306(b)(4) saves Ms. Jackson’s 2010\npetition from the customary operation of the doctrine of res judicata.\n\n                                               A.\n\n        The doctrine of res judicata or claim preclusion bars a second suit between the same\nparties or their privies on the same claim with respect to all issues which were, or could have\nbeen, litigated in the former suit.

It does not mention or even allude\nto Ms. Jackson’s 2009 petition.9 While Mr. Smith’s motion to dismiss includes the details\nof the litigation relating to Ms. Jackson’s 2009 petition, Mr. Smith did not file copies of the\nOctober 2, 2009 order or any other portions of the record of the 2009 proceedings along with\nhis motion.10\n\n       Without more, the trial court could have denied Mr. Smith’s motion to dismiss, had\nMs. Jackson requested the court to do so. However, prior to the hearing on the motion, Ms.\nJackson filed a response that cured all the procedural shortcomings in Mr. Smith’s motion.\nIn her response, Ms. Jackson agreed (1) that her 2010 petition was the second petition for\ngrandparental visitation she had filed; (2) that the trial court had conducted a hearing\nregarding her former petition; (3) that the trial court had issued an opinion and final judgment\nwith regard to the former petition finding no evidence demonstrating that the loss of her\ngranddaughter’s relationship with Ms. Jackson would cause severe emotional harm or present\nthe danger of other direct and substantial harm to the child; and (4) that all findings of facts\nmade by the trial court in its opinion and judgment were res judicata.\n\n       Based on the concessions in Ms. Jackson’s response to the motion to dismiss and the\nstatements of her lawyer during the hearing on the motion to dismiss, the trial court found\nthat Ms. Jackson “does not dispute the validity and finality of this Court’s previous order.”\nMs. Jackson has not taken issue with this finding either in the Court of Appeals or in this\nCourt.\n\n       We respectfully disagree with the Court of Appeals’ conclusion that the record is\ninsufficient to enable the appellate courts to decide whether the doctrine of res judicata bars\nMs. Jackson’s 2010 petition seeking grandparental visitation. In light of Ms. Jackson’s\n\n\n        9\n          However, Ms. Jackson’s 2010 petition discloses a dependent and neglect action that Ms. Jackson\nfiled in the McNairy County Juvenile Court against her daughter and son-in-law.\n        10\n           A party asserting a res judicata defense may generally prove its defense with a copy of the\njudgment in the former proceeding. However, if the judgment leaves any of the elements of the defense\nuncertain, the party asserting the defense must provide additional evidence. Garrett v.

While parties asserting a res\njudicata defense may introduce a copy of the entire record of the prior proceedings to support their motion\nto dismiss, they are required to introduce only those portions of the record that are necessary to establish the\napplication of the doctrine of res judicata.\n\n                                                      -6-\n\fconcessions, the record contains ample basis for concluding: (1) that the October 2, 2009\norder was rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction; (2) that the 2009 petition and the\n2010 petition involve the same parties; (3) that the 2009 petition and the 2010 petition assert\nthe same claim; (4) that the October 2, 2009 judgment was on the merits; (5) that the October\n2, 2009 order was a final judgment; and (6) that the October 2, 2009 order was properly\nentered.\n\n                                                   III.\n\n        Ms. Jackson’s principal argument on this appeal is that the Court of Appeals erred by\nfailing to hold that the 2010 enactment of Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-306(b)(4) undermined the\npreclusive effect of the trial court’s October 2, 2009 judgment. She insists that, based solely\non the change in the law, she may file a second petition seeking grandparental visitation with\nher granddaughter, even though the material facts have not changed. We respectfully\ndisagree for two reasons.\n\n        First, the general rule, recognized throughout this nation, is that a change in the law\noccurring after a final judgment ordinarily does not create an exception to the application of\nthe doctrine of res judicata or claim preclusion. Moulton v. Ford Motor Co., 533 S.W.2d at\n297 (applying res judicata despite an intervening change in decisional law); see also\nPrecision Air Parts, Inc. v.

Accordingly, the enactment of a new statute after the\nprevious litigation has been finally concluded will ordinarily not provide a basis for\nrelitigating the same dispute. See 18 James Wm. Moore et al., Moore’s Federal Practice §§\n131.21[2], 131.22[3] (3d ed. 2009) (“18 Moore’s Federal Practice”).\n\n        The courts have declined to recognize a broad “general fairness” exception to the\ndoctrine of res judicata when there is a subsequent change in the law. See Roche Palo Alto\nLLC v. Apotex, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"209787\"><a href=\"/opinion/209787/roche-palo-alto-llc-v-apotex-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">531</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1372</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1380 (Fed.

However, on “rare occasions,” 11 the courts have recognized\nexceptions to the preclusive effect of a prior judgment following a change in the law. For\nexample, the courts have permitted a second action based on a new statute “when a new\nstatute provides an independent basis for relief which did not exist at the time of the prior\naction.” 18 Moore’s Federal Practice § 131.22[3]; see also State ex rel.

Matters of special sensitivity most often arise in cases\nof developing constitutional principles and issues of broad public importance. See Parnell\nv. Rapides Parish Sch.

Also included are cases of continuing conduct, which\nitself strains the typical application of res judicata, involving substantial public policy\nconcerns, such as a suit to prevent continued environmental pollution. See 18 Moore’s\nFederal Practice § 131.22[3]; 18 Federal Practice and Procedure § 4415, at 372.\n\n       None of these exceptions are applicable in this case. Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-\n306(b)(4) did not provide Ms. Jackson with new grounds for seeking visitation with her\ngranddaughter. Ms. Jackson has never claimed that she was deprived of a full and fair\nopportunity to present and litigate her request for grandparental visitation in 2009. In\naddition, while Ms. Jackson’s desire to exercise visitation with her granddaughter is of great\nimportance to her, her claim does not involve the development of constitutional principles\nwith regard to matters of broad public importance.\n\n       The second basis for declining to interpret Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-306(b)(4) to\npermit Ms. Jackson to relitigate her request for grandparental visitation is the doctrine of\nseparation of powers reflected in Article II, Sections 1 and 2 of the Constitution of\nTennessee. The power to fully and finally adjudicate cases and controversies is\nconstitutionally assigned to the judiciary of this state, and the Tennessee General Assembly\nmay not interfere with the adjudicative functions of the courts.

(4 Yer.) 202, 206-07 (1833).\nLitigants have a vested interest in a court’s judgment once it becomes final. Accordingly,\nacts of the Tennessee General Assembly are construed to operate prospectively in order to\navoid being found to be retrospective and therefore proscribed by Article I, Section 20 of the\nConstitution of Tennessee.\n\n\n\n\n                                               -8-\n\f        A final judgment is the judiciary’s last word in a particular case. Thus, as the United\nStates Supreme Court has held, “[h]aving achieved finality, . . . a judicial decision becomes\nthe last word of the judicial department with regard to a particular case or controversy, and\nCongress may not declare by retroactive legislation that the law applicable to that very case\nwas something other than what the courts said it was.” Plaut v.

Code Ann. § 36-6-306(b)(4) in a way that places\nit on a collision course with Article I, Section 20.\n\n        Ms. Jackson’s 2009 petition for visitation with her granddaughter was fully and fairly\nlitigated in accordance with existing law. Ms. Jackson was given every opportunity to\nintroduce the evidence required at that time to obtain visitation with her granddaughter.\nFollowing two days of hearings, the trial court determined that Ms. Jackson had failed to\nprove that her granddaughter would suffer severe emotional harm or other direct and\nsubstantial harm if she was no longer able to visit with Ms. Jackson. This judgment became\nfinal when Ms. Jackson elected not to appeal it. Accordingly, we decline to interpret Tenn.\nCode Ann. § 36-6-306(b)(4) to permit Ms. Jackson, in the absence of new facts occurring\nafter the entry of the October 2, 2009 judgment,12 to seek visitation with her granddaughter\npursuant to Tenn.

We remand the case to the trial court for whatever further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion may be required, and we tax the costs of this appeal to Jeanette\nRea Jackson and her surety for which execution, if necessary, may issue.\n\n\n                                                          ______________________________\n                                                          WILLIAM C.
