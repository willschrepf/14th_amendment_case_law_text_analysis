Joseph Salazar, II\r\nappeals from a summary granted in favor of prison administrators James A.\r\nCollins and Jack M. Garner.  Salazar contends in three issues that: (1) the\r\ncourt erred by granting Collins’s and Garner’s summary-judgment motion and\r\ndenying Salazar’s motion for partial summary judgment because the evidence\r\nconclusively establishes that they had a legal duty to protect him from another\r\ninmate who assaulted him (two issues); and (2) the court abused its discretion\r\nby permitting the withdrawal of deemed admissions.  We will reverse and remand.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b><span>Background</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            Salazar’s suit is based on an\r\nallegation that he was attacked with a weapon by fellow inmate Mark Basden in\r\nDecember 1992,<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[1]</span></span></span>\r\n“which resulted in a prominent scar and permanent disfigurement.”  At the time\r\nof the alleged assault, Collins was the Executive Director of the Texas\r\nDepartment of Criminal Justice, and Garner was the warden of the Hughes Unit\r\nwhere Salazar was imprisoned.  Salazar alleged in his Sixth Amended Complaint<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[2]</span></span></span>\r\nthat Collins and Garner (collectively, “Appellees”) were liable for various\r\ntheories of negligence and gross negligence because TDCJ “agents, employees,\r\nand servants” housed Salazar in the administrative segregation unit with Basden\r\neven though they knew that both were associated with competing “disruptive\r\ngroups” and because of the manner in which TDCJ “agents, employees, and\r\nservants” implemented or failed to implement administrative policies\r\npromulgated by TDCJ for security in administrative segregation units.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            Salazar filed a motion for partial\r\nsummary judgment in which he alleged that Appellees owed him a duty as a matter\r\nof law to control Basden’s conduct and that section 501.019 of the Government\r\nCode does not apply.<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[3]</span></span></span> \r\nSalazar argued in particular that they owed him a duty to control Basden’s\r\nconduct because a “special relationship” existed between Appellees and Basden and\r\nbecause they “had specific control over the security of the premises.”</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            Appellees filed a traditional\r\nsummary-judgment motion<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[4]</span></span></span> in\r\nwhich they argued that: (1) they owed no legal duty to Salazar because his\r\ninjuries were not foreseeable, the imposition of such a duty in the prison\r\ncontext would be contrary to public policy, and there was no “special\r\nrelationship” between Basden and them merely because of their status as prison\r\nadministrators; and (2) they have official immunity because inmate housing\r\nassignments are discretionary matters, they were acting in their official\r\ncapacity, and Salazar did not allege that they acted in bad faith.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            In Salazar’s First Amended Motion for\r\nPartial Summary Judgment and Responses to Defendants Motion for Summary\r\nJudgment, he abandoned his claim regarding section 501.019 of the Government\r\nCode but reiterated his duty contention on the same grounds.  In response to Appellees’\r\nsummary-judgment claims, he argued that:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>(1) they owed him a duty of reasonable care\r\nbecause of their “special relationship” with him;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>(2) they are not entitled to official immunity\r\nbecause:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>(A) prison guards admittedly failed to follow TDCJ\r\npolicy AD-03.50 (governing prisoners in administrative segregation) which\r\nrequires among other things that guards thoroughly search dayrooms and\r\nrecreational areas “prior to and after each use” and thoroughly strip-search\r\ninmates “before and after recreation or leaving the assigned cellblock,” and</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>(B) policy AD-03.50 imposes ministerial rather\r\nthan discretionary duties; and</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>(3) they are not entitled to official immunity\r\nbecause the allegations of his petition that they acted with “gross\r\nnegligence,” “reckless disregard,” and “conscious indifference” should be\r\nconstrued as allegations of bad faith.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            In support of his amended\r\nmotion/response, Salazar offered his own affidavit, Appellees’ responses to his\r\nfirst and fourth requests for admissions, his second request for admissions and\r\nproduction of documents, which Appellees had failed to answer, and his third\r\nrequest for admissions, which Appellees had also failed to answer.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            Appellees filed a response in which\r\nthey argued primarily that they had no legal duty because they had no\r\n“day-to-day control and supervision” over Basden.  However, they did not\r\nprovide additional summary-judgment evidence to support this contention.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            During a telephonic hearing on the\r\nsummary-judgment motions, the court asked Salazar to provide copies of the\r\nsigned return receipts accompanying his unanswered discovery requests, which Salazar\r\ndid by filing a “Supplemental Record” about one week after the hearing.  These\r\nreceipts demonstrate that the Attorney General’s office received Salazar’s\r\ndiscovery requests as he alleged.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            Appellees then filed a motion to\r\nstrike their deemed admissions.  They admitted that the discovery requests were\r\nreceived by the Attorney General’s office but argued that their failure to\r\nanswer was accidental and not the result of conscious indifference because the\r\ndocuments were never received by the attorney-in-charge of their case.  They\r\nalso argued that Salazar would not be prejudiced if their deemed admissions\r\nwere withdrawn.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            In a subsequent hearing, the court\r\ngranted Appellees’ motion to strike the deemed admissions, denied Salazar’s\r\namended motion for partial summary judgment, took Appellees’ summary-judgment\r\nmotion under advisement, and set the case for jury trial.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            Salazar then filed his Eighth Amended\r\nComplaint, alleging only two claims against Appellees, namely, that they are\r\nliable for ordinary negligence and gross negligence because their “agents, employees\r\nand/or servants failed to take reasonable steps to control the conduct of\r\nBasden” (the inmate who assaulted Salazar).  In connection with these claims, Salazar\r\nalleges that prison employees at the Hughes Unit failed to follow TDCJ policy\r\nAD-03.50, complaining in particular that prison guards failed to thoroughly\r\nsearch dayrooms and recreational areas “prior to and after each use” or\r\nthoroughly strip-search inmates “before and after recreation or leaving the\r\nassigned cellblock.”<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[5]</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            The trial court granted Appellees’\r\nsummary-judgment motion, holding in particular that neither Appellee “owed a\r\nlegal duty to Plaintiff Salazar” and that both Appellees “are entitled to\r\nofficial immunity.”</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b><span>Deemed Admissions</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            Salazar contends in his third issue\r\nthat the court abused its discretion by permitting Appellees to withdraw their\r\ndeemed admissions.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            A trial court has broad discretion to\r\ngrant or deny a request to withdraw deemed admissions.  <i>Wheeler v. Green</i>,\r\n157 S.W.3d 439, 443 (Tex. 2005) (per curiam).  No abuse of discretion occurs in\r\nthis regard if there is a showing of (1) good cause and (2) no undue\r\nprejudice.  <i>Id.</i> at 442 (citing <span>Tex.\r\nR. Civ</span>. P. 166a(c), 198.3).  Good cause is established by a showing that\r\nthe failure to respond to the request for admissions “was an accident or\r\nmistake, not intentional or the result of conscious indifference.”  <i>Id.</i>  “Even a slight excuse will suffice, especially when delay or prejudice to the opposing\r\nparty will not result.”  <i>Boulet v. State</i>, 189 S.W.3d 833, 836 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2006, no pet.) (quoting <i>Spiecker v. Petroff</i>, 971\r\nS.W.2d 536, 538 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1997, no pet.)).  Undue prejudice occurs when\r\npermitting the withdrawal and allowing a late response will delay the trial or\r\nsignificantly hamper the opposing party’s ability to prepare for trial.  <i>Wheeler</i>,\r\n157 S.W.3d at 443.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            Salazar served his second and third\r\nrequests for admissions in August and September of 2003 respectively. \r\nAppellees apparently did not become aware of their failure to respond until\r\nJune 2004 when Salazar filed his amended motion for partial summary judgment\r\nand response to Appellees’ summary-judgment motion.  In Appellees’ motion to\r\nstrike the deemed admissions, they stated that their failure to answer the\r\nrequests for admissions happened because these documents were inadvertently\r\nmisplaced after they were received by the Office of the Attorney General and\r\nwere never routed to the particular attorney assigned to the Salazar case.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            Appellees’ motion indicates that there\r\nwas no conscious indifference on their part and that the failure to timely\r\nrespond was due to a clerical error within the Office of the Attorney General. \r\nThus, the court did not abuse its discretion by finding good cause for the\r\nwithdrawal of the deemed admissions.  <i>See Spiecker</i>, 971 S.W.2d at\r\n541-42.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            Regarding undue prejudice, there is\r\nnothing in the record to indicate that trial was delayed or Salazar’s ability\r\nto prepare for trial was hindered by the trial court’s decision.  <i>See\r\nWheeler</i>, 157 S.W.3d at 443.  In fact, as will be seen hereinbelow, some of\r\nAppellees’ late-filed responses actually support Salazar’s contentions.  We\r\nhold that the court did not abuse its discretion by permitting the withdrawal\r\nof the deemed admissions.  Accordingly, we overrule Salazar’s third issue.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b><span>Contentions Which Will Not Be Addressed</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            Appellees address issues of vicarious\r\nliability and res judicata in their brief.  For the reasons which follow,\r\nhowever, we find that these issues were not properly raised in the\r\nsummary-judgment pleadings.  Therefore, we shall not further address them on\r\nappeal.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            A trial court cannot grant summary\r\njudgment on a ground not expressly presented in the summary judgment motion or\r\na response thereto.  <i>See Cincinnati Life Ins. Co. v. Cates</i>, 927 S.W.2d\r\n623, 625 (Tex. 1996); <i>Watson v. Dallas Indep. Sch. Dist.</i>, 135 S.W.3d 208,\r\n219 (Tex. App.—Waco 2004, no pet.).  We may consider only those grounds “the\r\nmovant actually presented to the trial court” in the motion.  <i>Id.</i>  Grounds\r\nraised in a brief filed in support of the motion or response, but not in the\r\nmotion or response itself, may not be considered by the trial court or by this\r\nCourt.  <i>McConnell v. Southside Indep. Sch. Dist.</i>, 858 S.W.2d 337, 340-41,\r\n343 (Tex. 1993); <i>Fletcher v. Edwards</i>, 26 S.W.3d 66, 74 (Tex. App.—Waco 2000, pet. denied).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            Appellees stated in their\r\nsummary-judgment motion that the motion presented two “Questions of Law”:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>A.        Whether Defendants have a duty as\r\ndescribed by Plaintiff (which forms the basis of his suit).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>B.         Whether Defendants are entitled to\r\nofficial immunity.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            Collins made passing reference in the\r\nsummary-judgment motion to his status as Executive Director of TDCJ and argued\r\ngenerally that he “has no duty for which he can be held liable” and that he\r\n“never had any personal interaction with Plaintiff or with Basden.\"  However,\r\nhe did not assert his administrative position with TDCJ as an independent\r\nground for relief, he did not cite any legal authority to support the\r\nproposition that a TDCJ administrator cannot be liable for the negligence of\r\nprison employees, and he offered no summary-judgment evidence pertinent to\r\nthese issues.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            Garner similarly alleged that he was\r\nthe prison warden during the relevant time period, that he “never had any\r\npersonal involvement with Plaintiff or Basden,” and that the “law doesn’t\r\nintend for [him] to be liable for every incident that occurs at the prison.” \r\nAs with Collins, however, Garner did not rely on his administrative position as\r\nan independent ground for relief, he did not cite any legal authority to\r\nsupport the proposition that a prison warden cannot be liable for the\r\nnegligence of prison employees, and he offered no summary-judgment evidence\r\npertinent to these issues.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            Appellees likewise refer to their\r\nadministrative positions in their brief, but again they cite no legal authority\r\nto support the proposition that a TDCJ administrator cannot be liable for the\r\nnegligence of prison employees.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            Appellees do clarify these contentions\r\nsomewhat in their appellate brief by claiming that “Salazar is basically suing\r\nGarner and Collins under a theory of <i>respondeat superior</i>,” but again\r\nthey offer no argument or authority to support any contention that Salazar\r\ncannot recover under a theory of vicarious liability.  Therefore, because\r\nAppellees did not present the issue of vicarious liability as an independent\r\nground for relief in their summary-judgment motion, we may not consider it in\r\nthis appeal.  <i>See Cincinnati Life Ins.</i>, 927 S.W.2d at 625; <i>Fletcher</i>,\r\n26 S.W.3d at 74.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            Appellees also raised the affirmative\r\ndefense of res judicata in a trial brief and refer to it again in their\r\nappellate brief.  They claim that res judicata bars Salazar’s suit because he\r\nwas within the class of inmates involved in the <i>Ruiz</i> litigation.  <i>See\r\nRuiz v. Estelle</i>, 503 F. Supp. 1265 (S.D. Tex. 1980), <i>aff’d in part and\r\nvacated in part</i>, 679 F.2d 1115 (5th Cir. 1982).  However, because Appellees\r\ndid not address res judicata in their summary judgment motion, we may not\r\nconsider it in this appeal.  <i>See Cincinnati Life Ins.</i>, 927 S.W.2d at 625;\r\n<i>Fletcher</i>, 26 S.W.3d at 74.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b><span>Special Relationship</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            Salazar contends in his first two\r\nissues respectively that the court erred by granting Appellees’\r\nsummary-judgment motion and denying Salazar’s motion for partial summary\r\njudgment because the evidence conclusively establishes that they had a legal\r\nduty to protect him from Basden.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            Appellees contend in their\r\nsummary-judgment motion that, as a matter of law, prison officials owe no duty\r\nto inmates to protect them from other inmates.  They argue in particular that:\r\n(1) the mere fact that TDCJ houses violent inmates is not enough to establish\r\nthe foreseeability necessary to impose a duty in this circumstance; (2) public\r\npolicy dictates against the imposition of such a duty in the prison context;\r\nand (3) no “special relationship” exists between prison officials and prisoners\r\nwarranting the imposition of such a duty.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            Salazar contends in his amended motion\r\nfor partial summary judgment/response to Appellees’ motion that the requisite\r\nspecial relationship does exist.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            We review a trial court’s summary\r\njudgment de novo.  <i>Provident Life &amp; Accident Ins.

and (2) the court abused its discretion\r\nby permitting the withdrawal of deemed admissions.  We will reverse and remand.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b><span>Background</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            Salazar’s suit is based on an\r\nallegation that he was attacked with a weapon by fellow inmate Mark Basden in\r\nDecember 1992,<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[1]</span></span></span>\r\n“which resulted in a prominent scar and permanent disfigurement.”  At the time\r\nof the alleged assault, Collins was the Executive Director of the Texas\r\nDepartment of Criminal Justice, and Garner was the warden of the Hughes Unit\r\nwhere Salazar was imprisoned.  Salazar alleged in his Sixth Amended Complaint<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[2]</span></span></span>\r\nthat Collins and Garner (collectively, “Appellees”) were liable for various\r\ntheories of negligence and gross negligence because TDCJ “agents, employees,\r\nand servants” housed Salazar in the administrative segregation unit with Basden\r\neven though they knew that both were associated with competing “disruptive\r\ngroups” and because of the manner in which TDCJ “agents, employees, and\r\nservants” implemented or failed to implement administrative policies\r\npromulgated by TDCJ for security in administrative segregation units.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            Salazar filed a motion for partial\r\nsummary judgment in which he alleged that Appellees owed him a duty as a matter\r\nof law to control Basden’s conduct and that section 501.019 of the Government\r\nCode does not apply.<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[3]</span></span></span> \r\nSalazar argued in particular that they owed him a duty to control Basden’s\r\nconduct because a “special relationship” existed between Appellees and Basden and\r\nbecause they “had specific control over the security of the premises.”</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            Appellees filed a traditional\r\nsummary-judgment motion<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[4]</span></span></span> in\r\nwhich they argued that: (1) they owed no legal duty to Salazar because his\r\ninjuries were not foreseeable, the imposition of such a duty in the prison\r\ncontext would be contrary to public policy, and there was no “special\r\nrelationship” between Basden and them merely because of their status as prison\r\nadministrators; and (2) they have official immunity because inmate housing\r\nassignments are discretionary matters, they were acting in their official\r\ncapacity, and Salazar did not allege that they acted in bad faith.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            In Salazar’s First Amended Motion for\r\nPartial Summary Judgment and Responses to Defendants Motion for Summary\r\nJudgment, he abandoned his claim regarding section 501.019 of the Government\r\nCode but reiterated his duty contention on the same grounds.  In response to Appellees’\r\nsummary-judgment claims, he argued that:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>(1) they owed him a duty of reasonable care\r\nbecause of their “special relationship” with him;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>(2) they are not entitled to official immunity\r\nbecause:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>(A) prison guards admittedly failed to follow TDCJ\r\npolicy AD-03.50 (governing prisoners in administrative segregation) which\r\nrequires among other things that guards thoroughly search dayrooms and\r\nrecreational areas “prior to and after each use” and thoroughly strip-search\r\ninmates “before and after recreation or leaving the assigned cellblock,” and</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>(B) policy AD-03.50 imposes ministerial rather\r\nthan discretionary duties;

<i>Chambers</i>, 883 S.W.2d at 654.  By Appellees’ own\r\nadmissions, prison employees failed to comply with these ministerial duties. \r\nThus, a genuine issue of material fact remains on the question of whether\r\nprison employees complied with these ministerial duties on the date of the\r\nalleged assault.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            Because Appellees failed to\r\nconclusively establish that Salazar seeks to hold them liable for a failure to\r\nperform discretionary duties, the court erred by granting their\r\nsummary-judgment motion insofar as the motion was premised on official\r\nimmunity.  Accordingly, we sustain Salazar’s first issue.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b><span>Conclusion</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Appellees failed to conclusively establish that\r\nBasden did not present “an unreasonable and foreseeable risk of harm” to\r\nSalazar.  They likewise failed to conclusively establish that Salazar seeks to\r\nhold them liable for a failure to perform discretionary duties.  Accordingly,\r\nthey were not entitled to summary judgment on the issues of legal duty or\r\nofficial immunity.  Thus, we reverse the judgment and remand this cause to the\r\ntrial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>FELIPE REYNA</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Justice</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Before Chief Justice\r\nGray,</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Justice\r\nVance, and</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Justice\r\nReyna</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>(Chief Justice Gray concurs in the result with a\r\nnote as follows: “I cannot join the majority’s broad sweeping statements that\r\nare unnecessary in the disposition of this appeal of a summary judgment,\r\ntherefore I join only the result.  I cannot join the judgment because it makes\r\nreference to the majority’s opinion which I cannot join.”)</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Reversed and remanded</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Opinion delivered and\r\nfiled February 27, 2008</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>[CV06]</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div><br clear=\"all\">\r\n\r\n<hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\">\r\n\r\n<div id=\"ftn1\">\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoFootnoteText\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[1]</span></span></span>\r\n<span>              Salazar’s lawsuit has been\r\npending since 1994, and there have been four prior proceedings in this Court\r\nrelated to his suit.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoFootnoteText\"><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"ftn2\">\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoFootnoteText\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[2]</span></span></span>\r\n<span>              This was Salazar’s live\r\npleading on file when Appellees filed their summary-judgment motion.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoFootnoteText\"><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"ftn3\">\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoFootnoteText\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[3]</span></span></span>\r\n<span>              Section 501.019 permits the\r\nState to deduct the cost of incarceration as a setoff against any adverse judgment\r\nrendered in an inmate’s favor.  <i>See</i> <span>Tex.\r\nGov’t Code Ann.</span> § 501.019 (Vernon 2004).</span></p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"ftn4\">\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoFootnoteText\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[4]</span></span></span>\r\n<span>              Although Appellees’ motion\r\nrefers to both subsections (c) and (i) of Rule of Civil Procedure 166a, which\r\ngovern traditional and no-evidence summary-judgment motions respectively, their\r\nmotion does not delineate in any manner between traditional and no-evidence\r\nclaims.  <i>See</i> <span>Tex.
