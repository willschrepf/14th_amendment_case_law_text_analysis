W.H.H. Beadle, addressed the crowd. He spoke of the\n\nimportance of education to the future of the state:\n\n                    The advance of every free state depends upon the broad\n             intelligence of its citizens. Because we are a state, republican in\n             form, education of all the people becomes the highest duty of the\n             state. Nothing can be so important except the struggle for the\n             very existence of the republic. The genius of the poorest must\n             have equal chance with the opportunity of the rich. The true\n             state will not disregard the welfare of the humblest orphan. Our\n             resources of farm, orchard, and mine, our soils and our water\n             supply, our rocks, our clays, must be scientifically studied and\n             mastered; our livestock, our entire productive possibilities\n             require a scientifically trained and educated people. As our\n             population doubles and crowds our area, this need increases.\n             This training should be masterly and broad and prepare as fully\n             also for all civic and social duties. Not for wage earning alone,\n             nor for money making alone, must we educate. All skill, all\n             technical training, all science, all the industries, can not\n             together, but unaided, save and develop all that human society\n             and government have in charge for our permanent welfare.\n             Technology is required for the world’s progress, but it is not all\n             the story of man’s advancement.\n\n                                            ***\n\n             The mastery of history, government, literature, philosophy; the\n             knowledge of all the world and its mutual and conflicting\n             interests, of the origin and nature of human society and “the\n             grand results of time” must be the possession of those who are to\n             lead us in the profound questions bound up in the state and\n             national and international interests.\n\n                                            ***\n\n             The great, final, single, comprehensive aim of education and of\n             the highest education is the equipment of men for moral\n             leadership. I believe that all this should be done inside the\n             state, that all scholars, all teachers and all trained citizens\n\n                                         -1-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\n              should be made by institutions within our own state. Within our\n              borders, under our laws and institutions, under the discipline of\n              our own conditions and inspired by our state pride, all this can\n              best be done. All the elements of, and inspiration for it, should\n              be thoroughly given in our common schools, from our libraries\n              and at our firesides. 1\n\nGeneral Beadle’s convictions are embedded in the language of South Dakota’s\n\nConstitution.\n\n[¶2.]         Article VIII, Section 1 of the South Dakota Constitution emphasizes\n\nthe importance of a “general and uniform system of public schools” and places the\n\nduty to establish the system on the State Legislature:\n\n              The stability of a republican form of government depending on\n              the morality and intelligence of the people, it shall be the duty of\n              the Legislature to establish and maintain a general and uniform\n              system of public schools wherein tuition shall be without charge,\n              and equally open to all; and to adopt all suitable means to secure\n              to the people the advantages and opportunities of education.\n\n(Emphasis added.) The Legislature also has the duty to fund education. Article\n\nVIII, Section 15 of the South Dakota Constitution directs the Legislature to provide\n\nthrough general and local taxation as follows:\n\n              The Legislature shall make such provision by general taxation\n              and by authorizing the school corporations to levy such\n              additional taxes as with the income from the permanent school\n              fund shall secure a thorough and efficient system of common\n              schools throughout the state.\n\n[¶3.]         Whether the Legislature has met the constitutional requirements of\n\nadequately funding education is the central question in this action. The plaintiffsa\n\ngroup of children who attend public schools in South Dakota school districts and\n\n\n\n1.      Oscar William Coursey, A Complete Biographical Sketch of General William\n        Henry Harrison Beadle 87-91 (1913).\n\n                                           -2-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\ntheir parents and natural guardiansclaim that the present system of funding\n\neducation is unconstitutional because it does not provide all children with an\n\nadequate and quality education. Specifically, the plaintiffs ask for a declaratory\n\nruling that Article VIII, Sections 1 and 15 mean (1) “that the South Dakota\n\nConstitution entitles all children to a free, adequate and quality public education,”\n\nand (2) that the present system of funding is unconstitutional because it does not\n\nprovide all children with an adequate and quality education.\n\n[¶4.]         Clearly, the language of the South Dakota Constitution guarantees\n\nevery child a free public education to provide them with “the advantages and\n\nopportunities of education.” What this means and its relationship to funding,\n\nhowever, is a trickier question. 2 To answer that question, we look at the plain\n\n\n\n2.      Defendants are the State of South Dakota, the South Dakota Department of\n        Education (SDDOE) (a subdivision of South Dakota state government), the\n        South Dakota Board of Education, and three state officials in their official\n        capacities: The Governor, M. Michael Rounds; the State Treasurer, Vernon L.\n        Larson; and the South Dakota Secretary of Education, Dr. Rick Melmer.\n        Either since the trial of this matter or the appeal to this Court, the state\n        officials named as defendants have been replaced in office by election or, in\n        Dr. Melmer’s case, through resignation and a subsequent appointment. The\n        proceedings are as follows:\n\n        In June 2006, the plaintiffs filed a complaint against the defendants in circuit\n        court for the Sixth Judicial Circuit in Hughes County, South Dakota. The\n        complaint asked the court to: a) declare that the public school finance system\n        violates the education clauses of the state constitution; b) prohibit the\n        defendants from “administering, enforcing, and/or funding” the public school\n        finance system; c) maintain judicial oversight over the legislative and\n        executive branches of state government to correct “constitutional\n        inadequacies.”\n\n        In March 2007, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject\n        matter jurisdiction on the ground that the plaintiffs’ claims were not\n        justiciable. The plaintiffs filed a motion for partial summary judgment\n                                                                     (continued . . .)\n                                             -3-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\nmeaning of the language and the intent of its drafters. See Brendtro v. Nelson, 2006\n\nS.D. 71, ¶ 34, 720 N.W.2d 670, 681-82. The drafters used key words in defining the\n\nLegislature’s duty. They required the Legislature to “establish and maintain a\n\ngeneral and uniform system of public schools, . . . adopt all suitable means to secure\n\nto the people the advantages and opportunities of education,” and provide funding to\n\n“secure a thorough and efficient system of common schools throughout the state.”\n\nS.D. Const. art. VIII, §§ 1, 15 (emphasis added). The plain and ordinary meaning of\n\nthese key words appears unchanged since 1889 when South Dakota’s Constitution\n\nwas ratified. 3 General means “[p]ertaining to, affecting, or applicable to, each and\n\nall of the members of a class, kind, or order”; uniform is “[h]aving always the same\n\n\n_____________________________\n( . . . continued)\n          asking the court to declare that education is a fundamental right under the\n          South Dakota Constitution and that Article VIII of the South Dakota\n          Constitution guarantees all South Dakota children a free, adequate and\n          quality public education. The plaintiffs also asked the court to declare\n          standards for an adequate and quality education under the South Dakota\n          Constitution.\n\n      After a hearing, the trial court denied the defendants’ motion to dismiss for\n      lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The trial court did, however, dismiss the\n      plaintiffs’ claims for any remedy beyond declaratory relief under the\n      Declaratory Judgments Act. See SDCL ch. 21-24. The court also denied the\n      plaintiffs’ motion for partial summary judgment but declared: “Article VIII of\n      the South Dakota Constitution guarantees as a constitutional right that all\n      South Dakota children are entitled to a free and adequate public education[.]”\n\n      The case was tried from September 2 through September 30, 2008. On June\n      10, 2009, the trial court entered findings of fact, conclusions of law and a\n      judgment in favor of the defendants and against the plaintiffs on all claims.\n      Plaintiffs appeal.\n\n3.     See, e.g., Campbell Cnty. Sch. Dist. v. State (Campbell Cnty. I), 907 P.2d\n      1238, 1258 (Wyo. 1995) (quoting The Century Dictionary (1889) in defining\n      “uniform,” “system,” “thorough,” and “efficient”).\n\n                                          -4-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\nform, manner, or degree”; and system is “[a]n aggregation or assemblage of objects\n\nunited by some form of regular interaction or interdependence.” Webster’s New\n\nInternational Dictionary of the English Language 1043, 2777, 2562 (2nd ed. 1937).\n\nSuitable means “suited to . . . one’s needs, wishes, or condition, the proprieties, etc.,\n\nappropriate; fitting,” and secure is “to make secure or certain; to ensure.” Id. at\n\n2522, 2263. Advantage and opportunity are similarly defined as “[a]ny condition,\n\ncircumstance, . . . or means, particularly favorable to success, or to any desired end,”\n\nor “juncture of circumstances favorable to some end.” Id. at 38, 1709. Thorough\n\nmeans “so complete as to leave nothing unaffected or wanting”; and efficient\n\nsignifies “[c]apable, competent, [and] able.” Id. at 2631, 819.\n\n[¶5.]        Thus, the plain and ordinary meaning of the language of Article VIII,\n\nSection 1 requires the Legislature to establish a general system of free public\n\nschools, each of the same form, and to employ all appropriate and fitting means to\n\nensure children in South Dakota are afforded the advantages and opportunities of\n\neducation. Additionally, Article VIII, Section 15 directs the Legislature to provide a\n\nmethod of general and local taxation that, along with income from the permanent\n\nschool fund, ensures the existence of a system of common schools throughout the\n\nstate. The school system must be complete in all respects, as well as capable,\n\ncompetent, and able.\n\n[¶6.]        We check this interpretation against the historical context and intent\n\nof the framers of the South Dakota Constitution. See Campbell Cnty I., 907 P.2d at\n\n1259. See also Doe v. Nelson, 2004 S.D. 62, ¶ 10, 680 N.W.2d 302, 306. The\n\nimportance of education to those early leaders is unmistakable.\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\n[¶7.]         As early as 1861, the organizers of the Territory of Dakota set aside\n\nland for schools.

Thus,\n\n“[z]eal for learning has characterized the South Dakotan from the earliest period.”\n\n1 Doane Robinson, History of South Dakota 470 (B.F. Bowen & Co. 1904). “From\n\nthe earliest beginning of the Dakota Territory, the [citizens] have been vitally\n\ninterested in educating their children.” 4 As described by Pattinson F. McClure,\n\nDakota Territorial Commissioner of Immigration: “No matter how recent the\n\nsettlement, how ambitious the strife for worldly possessions, the church and school\n\nare there, the site and foundations for which occupy the first cares of every new\n\ncommunity.” 5 General Beadle reflected later in his life that: “[P]eople in territorial\n\ndays . . . would have a school, if it met in a log or sod shanty or in a room in a\n\nprivate home, or in the first little church.”6\n\n\n\n\n4.

The\n              virtue, intelligence, and public happiness of a people, and all\n              that conduces to the advancement of the prosperity, wealth, and\n              power of a country, is intimately associated with, and dependent\n              upon, the development of the educational interest of the state.\n              In communities where truth, virtue, intelligence and knowledge\n              prevail, there crime is rare, and poverty almost unknown. Every\n              dollar of taxes levied for the support of schools lessens, by many\n              dollars, the taxes which would be assessed for the support of\n              prisons and poor houses. 7\n\n[¶9.]         The Territorial Legislature authorized General Beadle, who became\n\nthe Territorial Superintendent of Public Instruction in 1878, to visit the capitals of\n\nfive other states to study their laws and experiences in utilizing their public school\n\nlands. 8 Based on his observations, he was to draft constitutional provisions and\n\nstatutes to obtain the best returns from Dakota’s school lands. 9 General Beadle\n\nvisited the capitals of Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan. 10\n\nHe later issued a report recommending that:\n\n              The great body of common schools of the state should be so\n              organized as to work in harmony under one general plan, and\n\n\n7.

He was afraid that territorial school lands (totaling in the millions of\n\nacres) would be sold to land speculators at low prices to meet the short term needs\n\nof public education. 12 General Beadle and other founders were determined to\n\npreserve the school lands until their value increased so that they could be sold for\n\nhigher prices and provide maximum support for public education into the future.13\n\nGeneral Beadle’s plan was that all money from the sale of school lands (for not less\n\nthan $10 per acre) would be safely invested in a school fund to permanently endow\n\neducation. 14 Clearly, ardent support of public education motivated the founders of\n\nour state.\n\n[¶11.]         Public education and desire for permanent funding prominently took\n\ntheir place in the state’s draft constitutions. The draft constitution, prepared at the\n\nconstitutional convention in Sioux Falls in 1883, incorporated provisions that would\n\n\n\n\n11.      W.H.H.

This historical context gives insight into the intent and\n\nmeaning of the constitutional provisions. The Wyoming Supreme Court,\n\ninterpreting a similar constitutional provision, also found historical context\n\ninstructive. The court wrote:\n\n               From this history, we can conclude the framers intended the\n               education article as a mandate to the state legislature to provide\n               an education system of a character which provides [state]\n               students with a uniform opportunity to become equipped for\n               their future roles as citizens, participants in the political system,\n               and competitors both economically and intellectually.\n\nCampbell Cnty.

Other courts have interpreted educational mandates in their\n\nconstitutions comparably. 21 We believe the framers of South Dakota’s\n\nconstitutional provision intended a similar mandate to our State Legislature.\n\n\n\n20.

The constitutional language and intent of the framers guarantee\n\nthe children of South Dakota a constitutional right to an education that provides\n\nthem with the opportunity to prepare for their future roles as citizens, participants in\n\nthe political system, and competitors both economically and intellectually. The\n\nconstitutional mandate does not contemplate a system that fails to educate all\n\nchildren or leaves pockets of inadequate conditions and achievement as a result of\n\ninsufficient funding. As General Beadle so eloquently stated, “The genius of the\n\npoorest must have equal chance with the opportunity of the rich.” Coursey, supra\n\nnote 1, at 87. The question before us is whether the legislative scheme for funding\n\neducation meets the constitutional requirements.\n\n             BURDEN OF PROOF AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n[¶15.]       For the plaintiffs to prevail, they must show that the public school\n\nfunding system is unconstitutional because it fails to provide students with an\n\neducation that gives them the opportunity to prepare for their future roles as\n\ncitizens, participants in the political system, and competitors both economically and\n\nintellectually.

This does not mean that the plaintiffs have the burden of proving each fact\n         beyond a reasonable doubt, as the State argues. We find no merit in this\n         argument because it confuses the distinction between burden of production\n         and burden of persuasion. We attempted to clarify the difference in Gordon\n         v. St. Mary’s Healthcare Center:\n\n                     For many years the term ‘burden of proof’ was\n                     ambiguous because the term was used to describe\n                                                                  (continued . . .)\n                                         -12-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\n[¶17.]          In the present case, the plaintiffs have the burden of persuading the\n\nCourt beyond a reasonable doubt that the public school system fails to provide\n\nstudents with an education that gives them the opportunity to prepare for their\n\nfuture roles as citizens, participants in the political system, and competitors both\n\neconomically and intellectually, and that this failure is related to an inadequate\n\nfunding system.\n\n                                         ANALYSIS\n\nCurrent Funding Sources and Funding Formula\n\n[¶18.]          We begin with an overview of the state funding system. The two main\n\nsources of revenue for the 161 public school districts are state aid and local property\n\n_____________________________\n( . . . continued)\n                   two distinct concepts. Burden of proof was\n                   frequently used to refer to what we now call the\n                   burden of persuasion-the notion that if the evidence\n                   is evenly balanced, the party that bears the burden\n                   of persuasion must lose. But it was also used to\n                   refer to what we now call the burden of production-\n                   a party’s obligation to come forward with evidence\n                   to support its claim.\n\n                Director, Office of Workers’ Compensation Programs v.\n                Greenwich Collieries, 512 U.S. 267, 272, 114 S. Ct. 2251, 2255,\n                129 L. Ed. 2d 221, 228 (1994). “‘It is generally said that the\n                burden of production may pass from party to party as the case\n                progresses while the burden of persuasion rests throughout on\n                the party asserting the affirmative of an issue.’” Hayes v.\n                Luckey, 33 F.

See S.D. Const. art. VIII, § 15. The districts also depend on other revenue\n\nsources, such as borrowed funds through bond issues; funds from federal, state, or\n\nother political subdivisions; and funds received from fines and penalties. SDCL 13-\n\n16-1. 23\n\n[¶19.]        Prior to 1995, the Legislature funded school districts through an\n\nexpenditure driven funding formula. The more a school district spent, the more\n\nstate funding it received. The constitutionality of the formula was unsuccessfully\n\nchallenged on equal protection grounds in state circuit court in 1994. See Bezdichek\n\nv. State, 1994 S.D.C.C. 34, Hughes County Civ. No. 91-209 (S.D. 6th Jud. Cir. 1994).\n\nThe circuit court decision was not appealed. The South Dakota Legislature,\n\nhowever, revised the formula in the 1995 legislative session to take effect January\n\n1, 1997. The revised formula funded districts based on an established per student\n\nallocation (PSA), a district’s enrollment, and the amount of local property tax levied.\n\n[¶20.]        The revised formula requires a multi-step calculation starting with the\n\nlegislatively designated PSA. SDCL 13-13-10.1(4). The 1995 Legislature set the\n\nPSA at $3,350 beginning in fiscal year (FY) 1998 to be increased annually by the\n\n_____________________________\n( . . . continued)\n          evidence produced. The trial court’s findings are reviewed under a clearly\n          erroneous standard. State v. Dillon, 2010 S.D. 72, ¶ 49, 788 N.W.2d 360, 373.\n23.       School districts segregate their revenues into a number of separate fund\n          accounts including the general fund, the capital outlay fund, the special\n          education fund, and the pension fund. SDCL 13-16-2, 13-10-6. The general\n          fund is used for all of the operational costs of a school district, excluding\n          capital outlay and special education fund expenditures. SDCL 13-16-3.\n          Thus, the general fund is the source from which almost all of the school\n          district’s funding requirements must be met. Local revenue generally\n          accounts for approximately half the revenue in a school district’s general\n          fund. The remainder comes from state aid.\n                                                                          (continued . . .)\n\n                                           -14-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\nrate of inflation according to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or by 3%, whichever\n\nwas less. See 1995 S.D. Sess. Laws ch. 77, § 3. See also SDCL 13-13-10.1(3) - (4).\n\nAccordingly, the Legislature annually increased the PSA and, in some years, by\n\nmore than the inflation rate. By the time of trial, the PSA was $4,642.\n\n[¶21.]         Next, the formula establishes a school district’s “local need.” Local\n\nneed is the product of the PSA multiplied by a school district’s K-12 enrollment\n\ndetermined on a specified date in the fall. It may also include a “small school\n\nadjustment” if the enrollment is less than 600 students. SDCL 13-13-10.1(2A), (2C),\n\n(5). The small school adjustment increases the PSA by a fixed per pupil amount\n\naccording to a statutory sliding scale maximizing at $847.54. SDCL 13-13-\n\n10.1(2C). 24\n\n[¶22.]         Finally, the formula determines a school district’s “local effort,” which\n\nis the total amount of local property tax levied. The local effort is then subtracted\n\nfrom the district’s local need to arrive at the amount of state aid allocated to the\n\ndistrict. SDCL 13-13-10.1(6), -73.\n\n[¶23.]         In addition to revising the funding formula, the 1995 Legislature\n\ncapped the local property tax levy. The levy caps effectively limit the amount a\n\nschool district can raise locally. See 1995 S.D. Sess. Laws ch. 57, § 37; 1995 S.D.\n\nSess. Laws ch. 77, § 6. The 1995 Legislature originally capped levies at the\n\nfollowing amounts based upon three different classifications of local property:\n\n_____________________________\n( . . . continued)\n\n\n\n\n                                           -15-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\n$16.75 per thousand dollars of taxable valuation for non-agricultural land; $6.25 per\n\nthousand dollars of taxable valuation for agricultural land; and $10 per thousand\n\ndollars of taxable valuation for owner-occupied single family dwellings. Id. After\n\n1995, the Legislature steadily lowered these caps during every subsequent annual\n\nlegislative session. 25 By the time of trial, the following caps were in effect for taxes\n\npayable in 2009: $8.78 per thousand dollars of taxable valuation for non-\n\nagricultural land; $2.61 per thousand dollars of taxable valuation for agricultural\n\nland; and $4.10 per thousand dollars of taxable valuation for owner-occupied single\n\nfamily dwellings. 2008 S.D. Sess. Laws ch. 48, § 1.\n\n[¶24.]       The Legislature allows school districts to tax at less than the statutory\n\nmaximum levies, but the state aid formula imputes the maximum to the local\n\ndistrict in calculating its local effort. SDCL 10-12-42, 13-13-10.1(6). School districts\n\nmay also “opt out” of the maximum levies and tax at higher rates. SDCL 10-12-43.\n\nIf a school district opts out, the funds go into the school district’s general fund in\n\naddition to the funds received under the state aid formula. Id.\n\n[¶25.]       State funding based on the formula is the largest source of revenue for\n\nlocal districts. Local property taxes are usually the next major source of revenue.\n\n\n_____________________________\n( . . . continued)\n24.       The small school adjustment replaced the former “small school factor” in\n          2007. The small school factor was similarly designed to provide additional\n          assistance to smaller school districts.\n25.       See 1996 S.D. Sess. Laws ch. 69, § 5; 1997 S.D. Sess.

See S.D.\n\nConst. art. VIII, § 3. School districts also receive other funds for education-related\n\npurposes such as capital outlay and pension funds collected through local revenue\n\nand special education funds from federal, state, and local sources. A district may\n\nalso be eligible for a sparsity benefit based on enrollment, size, and distance\n\ncriteria. See SDCL 13-13-78 to -79. 26\n\nAlleged Funding System Flaws and Inadequacies\n\n[¶26.]         The plaintiffs identify problems with the school funding system that\n\nthey claim make it structurally flawed and inadequate. They claim that the system\n\nis arbitrary and irrational because funding is not based on actual costs of providing\n\nstudents with a constitutionally adequate education and does not align funding\n\nwith need.\n\n\n\n\n26.      Periodically, the Legislature has appropriated per student funds outside of\n         the state aid formula and funding for special programs such as consolidation\n         incentives, heating assistance, career and technical education grants, and\n         teacher compensation assistance. Further, the state has provided\n         technological assistance to the school districts including: internet service and\n         net management; provision of a student information management system\n         (SIMS) accessible to parents online; and maintenance and support of the\n         Dakota Digital video Network (DDN) used for distance learning. The state\n         has also provided funding assistance for: GEAR UP programs to assist\n         economically disadvantaged students; laptop computers and training for\n         teachers and technology coordinators; formative assessment tools; regional\n         agencies providing technical assistance to schools under the federal No Child\n         Left Behind Act (NCLB); online testing for student diagnostic purposes;\n         online curriculum assistance; online advanced placement courses and exam\n         review; and online access to DakotaSTEP test results measuring proficiency\n         for NCLB purposes.\n\n                                            -17-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\n[¶27.]       Other jurisdictions have found school funding systems unconstitutional\n\nbecause funding was not based on actual costs. The Montana Supreme Court in\n\nColumbia Falls Elementary School District No. 6 v. State, held that, “[u]nless\n\nfunding relates to needs such as academic standards, teacher pay, fixed costs, costs\n\nof special education, and performance standards, then the funding is not related to\n\nthe cornerstones of a quality education.” 109 P.3d 257, 262 (Mont. 2005). The\n\nWyoming Supreme Court determined that Wyoming’s school funding system was\n\nunconstitutional because the distribution formula was not based upon the actual\n\ncosts of providing a basic education package to each student. Campbell Cnty. I, 907\n\nP.2d at 1277.\n\n[¶28.]       Whether South Dakota’s funding formula is based upon actual costs is\n\nunclear. The parties offered no evidence of actual costs. Cf. Campbell Cnty. I, 907\n\nP.2d at 1251 (where the plaintiffs presented a cost study as evidence). Several\n\nwitnesses, including two legislators, testified that the funding formula only provides\n\na certain amount of funding to each school district, regardless of need. An SDDOE\n\nemployee testified that she provided data to the 1995 Legislature when the formula\n\nwas being developed. The data included general fund expenditures, the old funding\n\nformula “inclusions,” and school enrollment. The witness further indicated the\n\nformula’s original 1997 PSA derived from the costs and expenditures of all the\n\nschool districts in the 1993-94 school year increased by 3.3% per year for inflation.\n\nWe are unable to surmise from the evidence if the Legislature considered the actual\n\ncost of educating a student as part of the formula. Without evidence to the\n\ncontrary, a court must presume the Legislature exercised its power to investigate\n\n\n                                         -18-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\nand determine such facts. See State ex rel. Payne v. Reeves, 44 S.D. 568, 595, 184\n\nN.W. 993, 999-1000 (1921). See also State ex rel. Kornmann v. Larson, 81 S.D. 540,\n\n551, 138 N.W.2d 1, 7 (1965); Payne v. Jones, 47 S.D. 488, 491, 199 N.W. 472, 473\n\n(1924).\n\n[¶29.]         Even if the Legislature used historical education costs instead of actual\n\ncosts, the formula may still be valid. The Wyoming Supreme Court recognized that\n\nhistorical costs can be a starting point in State v. Campbell County School District\n\n(Campbell Cnty. II), 19 P.3d 518 (Wyo. 2001). After determining that Wyoming’s\n\nfunding formula was unconstitutional in Campbell County I, the court directed the\n\nWyoming Legislature to develop a school funding system based upon costs. 907\n\nP.2d at 1279. The Wyoming Legislature retained a consulting firm for that purpose.\n\nSee Campbell Cnty. II, 19 P.3d at 537. Rather than carrying out a study of actual\n\ncosts, however, the consulting firm determined costs based upon statewide averages\n\nof past school district expenditures and “professional judgment.” Id. The Wyoming\n\nSupreme Court held that, while this was not an ideal approach, the Wyoming\n\nLegislature had to “start somewhere” and use of past statewide average\n\nexpenditures to estimate costs was appropriate. Id. at 538. The court went on to\n\nhold, however, that “regular and timely inflation adjustments” would be essential to\n\nfunding the real costs of education. Id. at 549. 27\n\n\n\n\n27.      The Wyoming court also required a thorough review of all of the components\n         of the funding system every five years to ensure funding accurately reflected\n         actual costs school districts were paying because of market or economic\n         conditions. See Campbell Cnty. II, 19 P.3d at 549.\n\n                                           -19-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\n[¶30.]       When the 1995 South Dakota Legislature developed the current\n\nformula, it based the starting PSA for 1997 upon actual 1993-94 school district\n\nexpenditures plus a 3.3% inflation factor. The Legislature then made provision in\n\nthe new formula for continuing annual inflationary adjustments to the PSA\n\naccording to the rate of inflation under the CPI or by 3%, whichever was less. 1995\n\nS.D. Sess. Laws ch. 77, § 3. See also SDCL 13-13-10.1(3)-(4). The Legislature\n\nannually appropriated the required inflationary adjustment to the PSA for each\n\nyear the formula was in place. In some years, the Legislature appropriated a higher\n\nrate of inflation than the formula required. Based on the evidence at trial, it\n\nappears that the school funding formula was originally designed in line with\n\nhistorical cost data as regularly adjusted for inflation.\n\n[¶31.]       The plaintiffs, however, find problems with the formula’s inflation\n\nprovision. They argue it is structurally defective because, in some years, annual\n\ninflation may exceed the 3% cap in the formula. See SDCL 13-13-10.1(3)-(4). In\n\nthose years, education funding would fall behind actual costs. This argument has\n\nmerit; however, the plaintiffs have not shown that this has occurred. At the time of\n\ntrial, the Legislature had increased the PSA by more than the formula’s required\n\ninflation rate in four of the years preceding trial.\n\n[¶32.]       The plaintiffs also criticize the formula’s reliance on the CPI as a\n\nmeasure of inflation. They assert that the CPI does not capture inflationary\n\nincreases related to salaries and benefits which typically constitute at least 75% of a\n\nschool district’s operating budget. The plaintiffs presented no evidence to support\n\nthis claim, except for one legislator’s general opinion voiced in a 2007 e-mail\n\n\n                                           -20-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\nmessage to Dr. Melmer without any specifics. The CPI is a commonly used measure\n\nof inflation frequently relied upon in a number of legal contexts. See, e.g.,\n\nEnchanted World Doll Museum v. Buskohl, 398 N.W.2d 149, 150 (S.D. 1986) (CPI\n\nused as a basis for inflationary adjustments in a contract for deed); SDCL 62-4-7\n\n(increases in workers’ compensation benefits based upon the CPI); A.R.S.D.\n\n74:07:01:07 (dollar amounts for environmental financial assurance adjustable based\n\nupon the CPI). See also Campbell Cnty. II, 19 P.3d at 549 n.32 (CPI used in a school\n\nfunding case to document annual inflation rates and the erosion of purchasing\n\npower from 1995 to 2000). Absent more persuasive evidence of its inadequacy,\n\nusing the CPI as a measure of inflation does not render the funding formula\n\nunconstitutional. On this record, the plaintiffs have not shown that inflationary\n\nconditions skewed the formula or that the funding formula is unrelated to actual\n\ncosts.\n\n[¶33.]       The plaintiffs next assert that the replacement of the small school\n\nfactor with the small school adjustment in 2007 eliminated an annual inflationary\n\nincrease for smaller school districts. The small school factor and small school\n\nadjustment contemplate economies of scale; that is, smaller districts incur greater\n\ncost per student than larger districts. The small school factor utilized a schedule of\n\nmultipliers to artificially increase the enrollment of school districts with fewer than\n\n600 students. See SDCL 13-13-10.1(2). For example, school districts with fewer\n\nthan 200 students multiplied their enrollments by 1.2. SDCL 13-13-10.1(2)(a).\n\nThat product was then multiplied by the PSA, as annually adjusted for inflation, to\n\narrive at local need. SDCL 13-13-10.1(5) (Supp. 1996). The 2007 amendments\n\n\n                                          -21-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\nchanged this calculation. Enrollments are no longer artificially increased; actual\n\nenrollment figures are used instead. See SDCL 13-13-10.1(2A), -10.1(5). Smaller\n\nschool districts simply receive an additional fixed per pupil amount according to a\n\nstatutory sliding scale maximizing at $847.54 and declining as enrollments grow to\n\n600. SDCL 13-13-10.1(2C), -10.1(5). There is no provision for an annual inflation\n\nadjustment to this fixed per pupil amount. Thus, small school districts do lose the\n\nbenefit of an inflationary increase in their special adjustment every year. 28\n\n[¶34.]         Finally, the plaintiffs contend that opt outs, intended as an education\n\nenhancement mechanism, have instead become a tool of survival for many school\n\ndistricts. Since a school board’s decision to opt out can be referred (see SDCL 10-12-\n\n43), the plaintiffs claim the decision to adequately fund education defaults to a\n\nmajority vote of local taxpayers in violation of the constitution.\n\n[¶35.]         The constitution makes funding education both a state and local school\n\ndistrict responsibility. S.D. Const. art. VIII, § 15. See also Olson v. Guindon, 2009\n\nS.D. 63, 771 N.W.2d 318. It requires the Legislature to make provision “by general\n\ntaxation and by authorizing the school corporations to levy such additional taxes as\n\n\n\n28.      The State contends that, despite the loss of this inflationary increase, the\n         overall package of legislative changes to the school funding formula in 2007\n         actually benefitted smaller schools. However, the testimony was equivocal on\n         this point, the defense expert conceding, “It’s - - the formula is so complex.\n         Again, it would depend on whether they had a decline in student numbers.\n         It’s not just the dollars in the formula. There’s other pieces of it too.” We\n         agree. The formula is complex. As noted by the Wyoming Supreme Court in\n         regard to that state’s school funding formula in Campbell County I, “‘[i]f lack\n         of clarity alone were sufficient to strike these statutes down, this case would\n         be less difficult.’” 907 P.2d at 1248 (quoting Roosevelt Elem. School Dist. v.\n         Bishop, 877 P.2d 806, 809-10 (Ariz. 1994)).\n\n\n                                           -22-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\nwith income from the permanent school fund shall secure [the school system] . . . .”\n\nS.D. Const. art. VIII, § 15. Ultimately, however, the constitution imposes the duty\n\non the Legislature alone to “maintain” the school system and to devise the state and\n\nlocal tax system that will “secure” it. S.D. Const. art. VIII, §§ 1, 15. Whatever\n\nsystem the Legislature devises, therefore, must be sufficient to ensure the funding\n\nof a constitutionally adequate school system in every school district. A referendum\n\nconflicts with this constitutional requirement if it permits the voters in a district to\n\nreject taxes or levies necessary to fund a constitutionally adequate school system in\n\nthe district.\n\n[¶36.]          If an opt out is necessary to fund a constitutionally adequate school\n\nsystem, it may be problematic, especially if the opt out fails at the voting booth.\n\nBased upon the testimony provided, however, nearly all of the focus districts 29\n\nattempting opt outs ultimately were able to pass them. The exception was the Bon\n\nHomme School District which, despite the rejection of two opt out attempts in 2000-\n\n2001, continued to operate until the time of trial, continued to provide the required\n\ncurriculum, and produced academic results consistent with the other focus districts.\n\n\n\n\n29.      During discovery, the parties entered into an agreement regarding the\n         selection of “focus districts” for analyzing the education system. The focus\n         district agreement was not required by the trial court. The plaintiffs initially\n         selected eleven and the State ten focus districts. Prior to trial, the plaintiffs\n         dropped five of their focus districts and the trial court ruled any evidence on\n         those districts offered by the State was irrelevant. Thus, at trial, the\n         plaintiffs offered evidence as to their six remaining focus districts: Faith;\n         Florence; Doland; Bon Homme; Willow Lake; and Rapid City. The State\n         offered evidence as to their ten focus districts: Sanborn Central; Miller; Avon;\n         Faulkton; Hamlin; Sisseton; White River; McLaughlin; Shannon County; and\n         Flandreau.\n\n                                            -23-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\nWe find this record insufficient to demonstrate a constitutional violation in the\n\nreferral of any particular opt out.\n\nEducational Results as a Factor in Constitutional Determination\n\n[¶37.]       Even if there are flaws and inadequacies in the school funding formula\n\nand opt out provision, the plaintiffs still must show the correlation between funding\n\nlevels and a constitutionally adequate education. Thus, educational results are also\n\na factor in determining constitutionality of the system. In other words, are the\n\nstudents receiving the education required by the constitution? The plaintiffs must\n\nprove that the system fails to provide South Dakota school children with an\n\neducation that gives them the opportunity to prepare for their future roles as\n\ncitizens, participants in the political system, and competitors both economically and\n\nintellectually. The plaintiffs focus on educational resources and academic results to\n\nprove their case.\n\n\n\n\n                              Educational Resources\n\n[¶38.]       The plaintiffs concentrate on the conditions of their six focus school\n\ndistricts to support their contention of inadequate resources: Faith; Doland;\n\nFlorence; Bon Homme; Willow Lake; and Rapid City.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -24-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\n[¶39.]         Testimony as to conditions in these districts mainly came from their\n\nsuperintendents. 30 Common themes emerged: insufficient funding resources\n\nprovided by the current school funding system; a resultant inability to meet ongoing\n\nfunding obligations; and a lack of realistic options for increased funding. Due to low\n\ntax bases and rising costs for items such as insurance and fuel, the superintendents\n\ntestified their districts were running out of funds and depleting their reserves.\n\nSome districts were surviving only with the benefit of successful opt outs while still\n\nothers had been unable to pass opt outs and were facing future funding uncertainty.\n\nAccording to the superintendents, consolidation was not an option for most of their\n\ndistricts because of the distances involved and student travel times.\n\n[¶40.]         The superintendents testified that over time these declining economic\n\nconditions led to waves of budget cutbacks as well as numerous programming and\n\nstaffing cuts. Advanced, college prep, gifted, foreign language, and arts programs\n\nwere common casualties. Some of the districts cut technical and agriculture\n\nprograms even in agriculture-based areas. Out of necessity, the districts were\n\nmoving toward increased reliance on distance learning over DDN, an interactive\n\neducational video network. In the superintendents’ estimation, however, the DDN\n\nprograms met with mixed results. Extracurricular programs also faced cutbacks,\n\nconsolidation with neighboring districts, or elimination altogether. Cutbacks were\n\n\n\n\n30.      Testimony in this area concerning the Rapid City Area School District was\n         provided by a former school board member rather than the district’s\n         superintendent. Nevertheless, his testimony echoed that of the\n         superintendents’ and is incorporated in this discussion.\n\n                                          -25-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\nalso leading to more resource issues in some districts such as outdated textbooks\n\nand library books.\n\n[¶41.]       The negative impact of staffing cutbacks was another common theme\n\namong the superintendents. Because of staff cuts and understaffing, remaining\n\nteachers and administrators were forced to take on larger classes and increased\n\nworkloads with less time for individual students. At the same time, they endured\n\nstagnant or frozen salaries. Some of the superintendents testified that the cutbacks\n\ncaused morale issues and teacher burnout leading to resignations and increased\n\nturnover.\n\n[¶42.]       Teacher salaries were a consistent area of concern in these focus\n\ndistricts. The superintendents repeatedly testified that low or noncompetitive\n\nsalaries caused an inability to recruit and retain qualified teachers. They perceived\n\nthis as contributing to an overall decline in qualified applicants and to\n\ninexperienced teaching staffs.\n\n[¶43.]       Some of the superintendents testified to more unique challenges.\n\nDoland, Bon Homme, and Willow Lake maintained schools serving Hutterite\n\nColonies. Those superintendents relayed their special hardships in providing\n\nadequate services to their economically disadvantaged and low English proficiency\n\nstudents.\n\n[¶44.]       Other focus districts faced special difficulties with deteriorating or\n\ninadequate facilities. Insufficient handicap access was one common point of\n\ntestimony in this area while roof and basement leaks were another. Doland’s\n\nsuperintendent raised various safety issues, and Florence’s superintendent testified\n\n\n                                         -26-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\nto a number of maintenance and space issues and a lack of air conditioning. Willow\n\nLake’s superintendent provided similar testimony including complaints of rusty\n\nwater pipes.\n\n[¶45.]         Faith’s superintendent testified to that district’s acute facility\n\nproblems. Its 1919 school building was condemned in 2004. The district provided\n\nreplacement quarters in the form of seven modular classrooms which continued to\n\nbe utilized through the time of trial. The superintendent provided extensive\n\ntestimony on the district’s financial inability to build a new school structure and as\n\nto the unique problems posed by the modular classrooms in terms of overcrowding,\n\ncleaning, maintenance, and safety as well as their responsibility for declining\n\nstudent morale.\n\n[¶46.]         The State relies on more positive evidence of conditions in the focus\n\ndistricts. The State points to the districts’ ability to maintain healthy general fund\n\nand capital outlay reserve balances despite their fiscal issues. The State also\n\nargues that opt outs were still available in some of the districts to increase funding.\n\nMoreover, some districts were not levying at the maximum limit for general funds\n\nor capital outlay funds, including some districts that had already passed opt outs.\n\nIn addition, student populations were declining in a number of districts while\n\nproperty valuations were rising, adding some boost to local tax bases.\n\n[¶47.]         The State emphasizes the potential for consolidation as a means of\n\naddressing funding issues. Through cross-examination, the State established\n\nconsolidation was a more feasible option for some districts than initially conceded\n\nby their superintendents. This was particularly true for those districts already\n\n\n                                            -27-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\nengaged in a level of inter-district cooperation in areas such as technical education,\n\nathletics, and other extracurricular activities.\n\n[¶48.]       The State also points to evidence that some of the districts could have\n\nmore advantageously used other available funding sources. For example, some\n\ndistricts were using general funds for state retirement fund contributions instead of\n\npension funds. Use of pension funds would have left more general funds available\n\nin those districts for education purposes. Other districts were not maximizing use\n\nof their capital outlay funds. Increased capital outlay funds could have assisted not\n\nonly in addressing some of the districts’ facility issues but also in purchasing\n\nequipment, computers, software, textbooks, and library books.\n\n[¶49.]       In terms of more significant facility issues, neither Faith nor Willow\n\nLake had attempted bond issues while Florence had already had a successful bond\n\nelection. The State also asserts some districts were maintaining more facilities\n\nthan necessary. In this regard, the State argues that the districts are under no\n\nlegal obligation to maintain separate Hutterite Colony schools, that Bon Homme\n\ndoes not need four separate attendance centers within its narrow geographic\n\nconfines, and that Willow Lake need not maintain a community wellness center at\n\ndistrict expense.\n\n[¶50.]       Overall, the State disputes that conditions in the plaintiffs’ focus\n\ndistricts represent conditions in the state school districts as a whole. The State\n\nrelies, in part, on testimony from Dr. Melmer. Dr. Melmer said he visited over a\n\nhundred school districts throughout the state and did not believe the facility\n\nproblems in the focus districts were indicative of most school districts. He\n\n\n                                          -28-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\nparticularly described the trailer situation in Faith as unlike anywhere in the state\n\nand pointed out that the facilities in the focus districts varied. For example, he\n\ncharacterized Rapid City’s facilities as excellent. While acknowledging teacher\n\nshortages in key areas at the high school level, Dr. Melmer did not believe the\n\noverall situation was as severe as described in the focus district testimony. In\n\nterms of resources, Dr. Melmer testified he had not seen outdated textbooks in his\n\nvisits and described classrooms as having good technology and updated materials.\n\nIn Dr. Melmer’s opinion, the focus districts’ problems did not represent South\n\nDakota school districts overall.\n\n[¶51.]         Relying upon Dr. Melmer’s testimony and its other experts, the State\n\nargues that many school districts have been able to provide a very solid and good\n\nenvironment for teaching and learning. The districts have provided adequate and\n\nin some cases, exemplary, facilities and resources, through modern technology,\n\ndistance learning, and highly qualified teachers. 31\n\n[¶52.]         The State highlights evidence that all of the 161 school districts met\n\ntheir state imposed accreditation and curriculum standards. School districts must\n\nbe accredited (SDCL 13-13-18; A.R.S.D. 24:43:02:01); and to maintain accreditation\n\nthey must meet a number of curriculum requirements (A.R.S.D. ch. 24:43:11).\n\nSchools in South Dakota meet or exceed the minimum state required curriculum\n\n\n\n31.      In terms of teaching resources, the data reflects that: only 1.6% of all core\n         content areas are not being taught by highly qualified teachers as ranked for\n         NCLB purposes (down by 9.7% since 2003); every teacher in South Dakota\n         has a bachelor’s degree and a growing percentage have master’s degrees;\n         South Dakota teachers possess an average of fifteen years of experience and\n         only 12% at the time of trial had less than three years of experience.\n\n                                          -29-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\nand, at the time of trial, all of them offered the distinguished track curriculum\n\nconsisting of ACT recommended core classes for college bound students. On a\n\nstatewide basis, South Dakota schools also offer various career and technical\n\neducation (CTE) courses such as agriculture and natural resources,\n\nbusiness management and family and consumer science.\n\n                                   Academic Results\n\n[¶53.]         In terms of academic results, the plaintiffs cite National Assessment of\n\nEducational Progress (NAEP) and DakotaSTEP test scores. Every state in the\n\ncountry administers NAEP tests in reading and math to their fourth and eighth\n\ngrade students. The plaintiffs claim the NAEP test results show that less than half\n\nof our students are proficient in the categories tested.\n\n[¶54.]         The DakotaSTEP tests are part of South Dakota’s educational\n\nassessment and accountability system under NCLB. 32 The tests measure student\n\n\n\n32.      The plaintiffs assert meeting state imposed academic standards and\n         achievement requirements such as those under NCLB is part of the standard\n         for an adequate, basic quality education under the South Dakota\n         Constitution. However, the Legislature may impose education standards\n         beyond those required by the constitution. See Breck v. Janklow, 2001 S.D.\n         28, ¶ 9, 623 N.W.2d 449, 454 (stating the legislative power is unlimited\n         except as it is limited by the state and federal constitution) (citing Wyatt v.\n         Kundert, 375 N.W.2d 186, 190-91 (S.D. 1995)). Further, “[t]he legislature\n         cannot define the scope of a constitutional provision by subsequent\n         legislation.” Poppen v. Walker, 520 N.W.2d 238, 242 (S.D. 1994).\n         Nevertheless, education standards have clearly advanced since the writing of\n         the constitution. As early as 1931, this Court recognized: “What would have\n         been considered a good average education in 1881 would not be so considered\n         today. Standards of education have advanced, and methods of teaching have\n         changed.” State ex rel. Prchal v. Dailey, 57 S.D. 554, 234 N.W. 45, 47 (1931).\n         Because the Legislature is “‘uniquely equipped’” to evaluate and respond to\n         such issues of public policy and to make choices as to what is involved in\n         providing a basic education, compliance with state imposed academic\n                                                                       (continued . . .)\n                                             -30-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\nproficiency in reading and math according to standards approved by the United\n\nStates Department of Education and the SDDOE. The tests are given annually to\n\nstudents in grades three through eight and eleven.

The goals are\n\ndesigned to advance students who lack basic proficiency in math and reading. In\n\nparticular, the plaintiffs emphasize the poor performance of Native American\n\nstudents. The 2008 state report card showed 52% of all Native American students\n\nin the state were not proficient in math and 38% were not proficient in reading.\n\n[¶55.]         The State argues that academic results need to be viewed on a\n\nstatewide basis rather than just in the focus districts. A statewide view offers a\n\nmore positive picture. The high statewide attendance and graduation rates\n\ncompare well at a national level. The statewide DakotaSTEP results for 2008\n\nindicate that 84% of all children were proficient or advanced in reading while 76%\n\nwere proficient or advanced in math. South Dakota students score above-average\n\non ACT tests and a high percentage of high school graduates attend some form of\n\npost-secondary education. The State minimizes the poor results of the eleventh\n\ngrade DakotaSTEP tests. Witnesses surmised that eleventh graders lacked\n\nincentive to excel on the tests because it did not impact their college eligibility or\n\nother post-high school opportunities. This pattern emerged in other states also.\n\n[¶56.]         Plaintiffs emphasize deficiencies in the funding system and\n\nquestionable achievement results. The State emphasizes positive state-wide results.\n\n_____________________________\n( . . . continued)\n               Percentage of all students not proficient in math...........................68%\n               Nat.

The standards set by the SDDOE offer guidance, but are not\n\nalone determinative. Questions also loom concerning the disparity among districts\n\nand the educational opportunities they provide. Some districts are clearly\n\nstruggling and, by their own estimation, offer less than a quality education.\n\nAlthough additional funding could remove some of the inadequacies, other factors\n\nimpact the results. Even assuming the deficiencies, the weakest link in the\n\nplaintiff’s constitutional challenge is tying the funding to the results.\n\n                   Correlation Between Funding and Results\n\n[¶57.]       Of the sixteen focus school districts the parties analyzed, Hamlin\n\nSchool District had the lowest per student expenditure in general funds in FY 2007\n\nof $5,353. Yet, 87.5% of Hamlin’s students tested proficient or advanced in reading\n\nand 82.6% tested proficient or advanced in math. Assuming a correlation between\n\nfunding and results, Hamlin should have been the poorest or one of the poorer\n\nperforming focus districts in 2007. It was not. Moreover, Hamlin achieved these\n\nresults while 42% of its students qualified for free or reduced lunches, a measure of\n\nthe economically disadvantaged student population in the district.\n\n[¶58.]       Rapid City had the next lowest spending per student in FY 2007 at\n\n$5,432 per student. While its overall math scores in 2007 were poor with only\n\n66.7% of the students testing as proficient or advanced, reading scores were\n\ncompetitive with 80.4% of the students testing in the proficient or advanced\n\ncategory. Among the Rapid City students, 31.5% qualified for free or reduced\n\nlunches.\n\n\n                                          -35-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\n[¶59.]       The third lowest spending focus district in FY 2007 was the Miller\n\nSchool District at $5,598 per student. Again, assuming a correlation between\n\nfunding and results, one would expect poor performance of Miller’s students. To the\n\ncontrary, Miller’s scores were the highest of all of the focus districts with 84% of the\n\nstudents testing as proficient or advanced in math and 89.5% testing as proficient\n\nor advanced in reading. As for its economically disadvantaged population, 32.3% of\n\nthe Miller students qualified for free or reduced lunches.\n\n[¶60.]       At the other end of the spectrum, the Shannon County School District\n\nhad the highest spending of the focus districts in FY 2007 at $12,889 per student,\n\nover twice the per student spending of the Hamlin School District. Once again,\n\nassuming a correlation between funding and results, Shannon County should have\n\nbeen one of the better performing focus districts in 2007. That was not the case.\n\nOnly 32.2% of its students tested proficient or advanced in math while only 53.5% of\n\nthem tested proficient or advanced in readingthe worst results of any of the focus\n\ndistricts. Notably, 100% of the Shannon County students qualified for free or\n\nreduced lunches.\n\n[¶61.]       Like Shannon County, McLaughlin, the second highest spending focus\n\ndistrict that year, posted test results among the worst, only 50% of the students\n\ntested proficient or advanced in math and 60% tested proficient or advanced in\n\nreading. McLaughlin School District spent $10,642 per student, nearly twice the\n\nper student spending of Hamlin School District. Also like Shannon County, 100% of\n\nthe McLaughlin students qualified for free or reduced lunches.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -36-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\n[¶62.]       At trial, Dr. Melmer provided additional examples of focus district\n\nperformances where funding amounts did not correlate with student results. White\n\nRiver was the third highest spending focus district in 2007 at $9,716 per student.\n\nYet, it had some of the poorest test results in line with Shannon County’s and\n\nMcLaughlin’s. Dr. Melmer also indicated that Hamlin and Willow Lake were “side-\n\nby-side” districts, and that Hamlin spent “well below” Willow Lake while achieving\n\ntest scores “at or above” Willow Lake’s. He identified a similar pattern between the\n\nneighboring Avon and Bon Homme School Districts where spending in Avon was\n\n“quite a bit less,” yet achieved test scores similar to Bon Homme’s.\n\n[¶63.]       The State’s experts generally downplayed a results-funding\n\ncorrelation. The experts conducted statistical analyses of test scores and school\n\ndistrict funding over several years in South Dakota. One expert found no\n\ncorrelation between a district’s total expenditures and its test scores, even after\n\nadjusting for socioeconomic circumstances affecting students such as poverty,\n\nEnglish language learner status, race, and ethnicity. The expert concluded that,\n\nwhile socioeconomic circumstances had significant negative effects on achievement,\n\nschool resources, including expenditures, had no significant effect. After analyzing\n\nthe statistical information in a variety of ways, the expert concluded:\n\n             No matter how you look at the data, no matter what techniques\n             you use, the data is very strong, it’s very consistent.\n             Achievement patterns in South Dakota are being influenced\n             heavily by students’ family background characteristics and\n             school resources that we can measure, that we have measured,\n             which includes most of the resource measures that experts have\n             looked at throughout the country. Those resources do not by\n             and large have significant effects. And the one that does have a\n             significant effect is a very small effect compared to SES [i.e.\n             socioeconomic circumstances]. So very, very hard in South\n\n                                          -37-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\n             Dakota to change achievement by changing resource levels\n             according to these studies.\n\nHe had found similar results in studies he had conducted in other states.\n\n[¶64.]       Another State expert concluded that, “across grades, across\n\nachievement areas, reading and math, across years, we don’t see any relationship\n\nbetween spending per pupil and achievement in South Dakota schools.” He claimed\n\nthis observation mirrored results of thirty of the best national studies, which found\n\nthat “attempts to improve achievement just by putting more resources into the\n\nschools and the classrooms have been ineffective . . . [and] have not led to higher\n\n[student] achievement[.]”\n\n[¶65.]       As additional support for their conclusions, these experts referred to\n\nNew Jersey and Wyoming experiences where student expenditures were\n\nsignificantly increased over time without measurable improvements in student\n\nachievement. One of the experts also referred to national spending having tripled\n\nbetween 1970 and 2000 while student performance remained level.\n\n[¶66.]       Several of the witnesses agreed that poor student achievement is\n\nimpacted by factors other than funding, such as parental issues, environmental\n\nissues, attendance issues, instructional programs, and internal resource allocation.\n\nOf particular concern was how to improve the performance of economically\n\ndisadvantaged students. Although additional funding for pre-kindergarten\n\nprograms may be one way of addressing the problemas one expert advocatedmost\n\nof the experts agreed that the achievement gap for economically disadvantaged\n\nstudents exists in every state in the nation. A complex set of socioeconomic factors\n\nand experiences contributes to the achievement gap, and no other state has been\n\n                                         -38-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\nable to eliminate the gap, including those spending nearly twice the average per\n\npupil amount that South Dakota spends.\n\n[¶67.]       The testimony and evidence raises questions about the correlation\n\nbetween the level of funding and student achievement. On this record, the\n\ncorrelation between the school funding system and poor academic results is not\n\nreadily apparent. Contrast this with the evidence before the New York Court of\n\nAppeals in Campaign for Fiscal Equity, Inc. v. State of New York, where the court\n\nfound funding for the New York City schools did not meet constitutional\n\nrequirements, but emphasized the “unique combination of circumstances” that\n\npermitted the plaintiff/appellants to prevail:\n\n             New York City schools have the most student need in the state\n             and the highest local costs yet receive some of the lowest per-\n             student funding and have some of the worst results. Plaintiffs\n             in other districts who cannot demonstrate a similar combination\n             may find tougher going in the courts.\n\n801 N.E.2d 326, 350 (N.Y. 2003) (emphasis original).\n\n                                   CONCLUSION\n\n[¶68.]       We hold that the South Dakota Constitution guarantees all South\n\nDakota children a free, adequate, and quality public education which provides them\n\nwith the opportunity to prepare for their future roles as citizens, participants in the\n\npolitical system, and competitors both economically and intellectually. Here,\n\nbecause the plaintiffs are challenging the constitutionality of the state education\n\nfunding system, they have a high burden to meet. They have to overcome the\n\npresumption of constitutionality. They have to show that the state funding system\n\nis “clearly and unmistakably” unconstitutional and “there is no reasonable doubt\n\n\n                                         -39-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\nthat it violates fundamental constitutional principles.” South Dakota Ass’n, 280\n\nN.W.2d at 664-65. They have to show that the Legislature’s system of funding fails\n\nto provide children of the state with an adequate and quality education, that is, it\n\nfails to give them the opportunity to adequately prepare for their future roles as\n\ncitizens, participants in the political system, and competitors both economically and\n\nintellectually. The plaintiffs’ evidence raises serious questions about whether the\n\nstate aid formula is based on actual costs and whether local taxing procedures and\n\ncaps might have constitutional implications. The plaintiffs have also shown some\n\ngroups of students are not achieving at desired levels and that some districts\n\nstruggle to provide adequate facilities and qualified teachers. Even so, reasonable\n\ndoubt exists that the statutory funding mechanisms or level of funding are\n\nunconstitutional. We are unable to conclude that the education funding system (as\n\nit existed at the time of trial) fails to correlate to actual costs or with adequate\n\nstudent achievement to the point of declaring the system unconstitutional. We\n\naffirm the trial court. 34\n\n\n\n34.    Relying on federal justiciability analysis, the State argues this Court should\n       not address the merits of the constitutional issue in this case on the basis\n       that it poses a non-justiciable political question. See Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S.\n       186, 82 S. Ct. 691, 7 L. Ed. 2d 663 (1962). We reject this argument. The\n       Connecticut Supreme Court recently cited decisions from nine states in\n       observing that “the vast majority of jurisdictions ‘overwhelmingly’ have\n       concluded that claims that their legislatures have not fulfilled their\n       constitutional responsibilities under their education clauses are justiciable.”\n       Conn. Coal. for Justice in Educ. Funding, 990 A.2d at 225 n.24 (citing\n       decisions from Kentucky, Massachusetts, Idaho, Colorado, Indiana, Montana,\n       North Carolina, Ohio, and Texas). See also State v. Campbell Cnty. Sch. Dist.\n       (Campbell County III), 32 P.3d 325, 333-37 (Wyo. 2001) (rejecting the position\n       that school finance issues are nonjusticiable political questions). The\n       Colorado Supreme Court held school funding claims to be justiciable in\n                                                                     (continued . . .)\n                                           -40-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\n[¶69.]        KONENKAMP, ZINTER, and SEVERSON, Justices, concur.\n\n[¶70.]        GILBERTSON, Chief Justice, concurs in result.\n\n[¶71.]        WILBUR, Justice, not having been a member of the Court at the time\n\nthis action was submitted to the Court, did not participate.\n\n\n\nGILBERTSON, Chief Justice (concurring in result).\n\n[¶72.]        The Court holds today that Plaintiffs have failed to establish beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt a constitutional violation of Article VIII of the South Dakota\n\nConstitution. I agree. The meaning of Article VIII and its history do not support\n\nthe heightened legal interpretations advocated by Plaintiffs. Furthermore,\n\nPlaintiffs have not shown that the trial court’s findings of fact were clearly\n\nerroneous or conclusions of law were in error.

Part of its rationale was that “it is\n          the province and duty of the judiciary to interpret the [state constitution] and\n          say what the law is.” Id. at 372. The court declined to follow federal\n          justiciability analysis because of the broader jurisdiction bestowed on state\n          courts versus the limited jurisdiction of federal courts. Id. at 370. This Court\n          has previously asserted the same prerogative of constitutional interpretation\n          as the Colorado court and we do so here.

This is appropriate\n\nbecause in Olson v. Guindon, 2009 S.D. 63, ¶ 23, 771 N.W.2d 318, 324 (Gilbertson,\n\nC.J., concurring), the appellants conceded that “there is no Constitutional authority\n\nfor this Court to declare itself to be some kind of ‘super school board,’ that is now . . .\n\nde facto, running the education system of South Dakota.” Neither are we a “super\n\nlegislature” constitutionally empowered to make school funding decisions.

In the course of their legal argument, Plaintiffs relied heavily on such\n\nanalysis.

It is unknown why the access to the schools was limited to “white children.”\n         While it could be the racial attitudes of the time, hopefully it was because the\n         federal government had already assumed the responsibility for the education\n         of Indian children. See, e.g., Article 4 of the Treaty with Sioux - Sisseton and\n         Wahpeton Bands (1851), reprinted in 1 South Dakota Codified Laws 80;\n         Article 5 of the Treaty with the Sioux - Sisseton and Wahpeton Bands (1858),\n         reprinted in 1 South Dakota Codified Laws 84.\n\n                                           -46-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\nwas achieved.

VIII, reprinted in 21 South\n\nDakota Historical Collections 326-34 (Hipple Printing Co., 1942). 39 According to\n\nGeorge W.

Two of the few contested issues in the education debates in the 1883\n         Constitutional Convention concerned a proposal that “all able bodied children\n         between the ages of seven and fourteen be required to attend school at least 3\n         months each year.” Another proposal was that the “Legislature shall provide\n         for uniformity of text books to be used throughout the public schools of this\n         State, and there shall be no change in text books within five years from the\n         date of adoption.” Constitutional Convention of 1883 at 356. Such specific\n         proposals were rejected while the more general terms such as “thorough”\n         survived. Id. at 356-57.\n\n40.      The proposed Constitution of 1883 was overwhelmingly passed by the voters,\n         12,336 to 6,814. Kingsbury, History of Dakota Territory, supra, at 1716-17.\n         The United States Senate also passed a bill allowing formal admission of\n         South Dakota as a State. The House of Representatives, however, failed to\n         act and it died.\n\n\n                                          -47-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\n[¶81.]         More in-depth examination of the Constitutional Convention of 1885 is\n\nrequired because at that convention Gen. Beadle drafted the text of what later\n\nbecame Article VIII. This draft was initially adopted by the 1885 Convention.\n\nMemoirs of Gen. Beadle, supra, at 178, 214-15. 41 The text of the 1885 Convention\n\nwas carried forward to the 1889 Constitutional Convention 42 which became Article\n\nVIII of the South Dakota Constitution 43 in 1889. 2 South Dakota Constitutional\n\nDebates 250-60 (Huronite 1907). 44\n\n\n41.      Once again the Constitutional proposal was overwhelmingly passed by the\n         voters, 25,138 to 6,527. Kingsbury, History of Dakota Territory, supra, at\n         1751. Once again it failed to gain Congressional approval.\n\n42.      Numerous provisions of the 1885 Constitution were carried forward to the\n         1889 Constitution and ultimately became enacted as part of the South\n         Dakota Constitution. A significant concern in 1889 that cautioned against a\n         total reliance upon the 1885 text was the Congressional Enabling Act of 1889,\n         25 Statutes at Large 676, ch. 180, “which created and prescribed the powers\n         of the 1889 conventions, so often recognized as a limitation on the\n         convention’s deliberation . . . .” McDonald v. Sch. Bd. of Yankton Indep. Sch.\n         Dist. No. 1 of Yankton, 90 S.D. 599, 606 n.3, 246 N.W.2d 93, 97 n.3 (1976).\n         The Enabling Act does not control the interpretation of Article VIII.\n         However, the Enabling Act did address education by stating, “[t]hat provision\n         shall be made for the establishment and maintenance of systems of public\n         schools, which shall be open to all the children of said states, and free from\n         sectarian control.”\n\n43.      The 1889 Constitution was hardly controversial at the ballot box. It was\n         approved by the voters 70,131 to 3,267. Jon Lauck, Prairie Republic – The\n         Political Culture of the Dakota Territory 1879-1889, 128 (University of\n         Oklahoma Press 2010).\n\n44.      The trial court’s legal research concluded that the South Dakota\n         constitutional education article is distinct from nearly every other state\n         constitution, including those found in surrounding states such as Minnesota,\n         Montana, Wyoming and North Dakota. On appeal, Plaintiffs do not\n         challenge this conclusion of law. According to Gen. Beadle, he drafted Article\n         VIII based on the “ideas, suggestions and work” of the members of the\n         Committee on Education. Memoirs of Gen. Beadle, supra, at 214. He had\n                                                                      (continued . . .)\n                                            -48-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\n[¶82.]       When reviewing the journals of the three constitutional conventions,\n\nthe only source of significant debate in regards to education was the minimum price\n\nset for sale of public school lands. Looking both inside and outside the\n\nconstitutional halls at contemporary histories such as Kingsbury and the Gen.\n\nBeadle Memoirs, the issue of education was not a clash of the titans; it was rather a\n\nconsensus that public education should be free to all, at taxpayer expense, as it had\n\nbeen since 1861. Typical of the attitude of the times was a subsequent statement\n\nmade by this Court in State ex rel. Eveland v. Erickson, 44 S.D. 63, 182 N.W. 315,\n\n316 (1921). “[D]uring the whole history of our nation, religion and education have\n\nbeen recognized as the foundation pillars of American Civilization.” Id. We have\n\nheld that when construing the South Dakota Constitution, we “may also consider\n\nthe circumstances under which a constitutional provision was formed, the general\n\nsprit of the times, and the prevailing sentiment of the people.” Poppen, 520 N.W.2d\n\nat 246-47.\n\n\n\n\n_____________________________\n( . . . continued)\n          previously traveled to other Midwestern states before 1885 and was familiar\n          with their constitutional provisions on education. As draftsman of the 1885\n          education clause, he accepted the suggestions of the Committee members\n          and, one must assume, borrowed from several states with which he was\n          familiar. The text of Article VIII is the result of what he considered to be the\n          best for the proposed State of South Dakota. Id. Other provisions of the 1885\n          and 1889 Constitutions may have been copied from other states as during the\n          Constitutional Debates on the Bill of Rights, “[w]hen a comparison was made,\n          it was usually with the constitutions of California, Illinois or Iowa.” Gilbert\n          v.

A review of the 1890 Session Laws indicates only two small enactments\n\ndealing with education; one requiring the teaching of the effect of alcohol on the\n\nhuman system and a second abolishing the State Board of Education. 1890 S.D.\n\nSess. Laws chs. 82 & 83. 45 Instead, the 1890 Legislature dealt with the subject of\n\neducation as with others by enacting a statute which carried over all Territorial\n\nLaws to the State laws unless repealed or amended. 1890 S.D. Sess. Laws 254, ch.\n\n105. This theme was reinforced by this Court in the early case In re State Census, 6\n\nS.D. 540, 62 N.W. 129 (1895). Therein we noted that:\n\n               There appear to be three classes of provisions in the\n               [C]onstitution. The first class embraces constitutional\n               provisions negative and prohibitory in their character, and are\n               self-executing. All the laws, therefore, in force when the\n               constitution was adopted, in conflict with these provisions, were\n               necessarily abrogated, and laws subsequently enacted in conflict\n               therewith would necessarily be void, in so far as they conflict\n               with such provisions.\n\nId. at 130. Yet, there is no suggestion that the Territorial Laws concerning\n\neducation somehow ran afoul of Article VIII; instead they were carried forward.\n\n\n\n\n45.      Five enactments concerning the sale and lease of School and Public Lands\n         were also enacted which had nothing to do with the actual education of\n         students. See 1890 S.D. Sess. Laws chs. 136, 137, 138, 139 & 140.\n\n                                          -50-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\n[¶84.]         This view of the history of our constitutional period has stood the test\n\nof time. Jon Lauck’s recent study of the pre-constitutional period of the 1880’s\n\nunearths no major battles over the educational provision or, after statehood, any\n\nclaims of failure to comply with Article VIII. See Jon Lauck, Prairie Republic – The\n\nPolitical Culture of the Dakota Territory 1879-1889 (University of Oklahoma Press\n\n2010).\n\n[¶85.]         This history indicates that Article VIII of the South Dakota\n\nConstitution did not chart a new path previously unknown in this jurisdiction. The\n\nyear 1889 did not usher in a revolution in education. Rather, it was a continuum of\n\nthe past with similar goals of improvement. While the drafters were studious of\n\nconstitutions adopted in other states, all three proposed constitutions were “home-\n\ngrown” documents.\n\n[¶86.]         Many of those who were in leadership positions at the Constitutional\n\nConventions and spoke frequently on important subjects were to become the\n\ngovernors, legislators and judges of the new State of South Dakota. Wegleitner v.\n\nSattler, 1998 S.D. 88, ¶ 11 n.3, 582 N.W.2d 688, 692 n.3. Thus, the new state\n\nofficials were familiar with the text of Article VIII. It seems inconceivable that\n\ndelegates to the Constitutional Convention of 1889 would subsequently take their\n\nseats in the Governor’s Chairs and the Legislatures of South Dakota and promptly\n\nignore the oath they had taken to support the Constitution of the State of South\n\nDakota which they had just authored months before.46 Rather it points to a belief\n\n\n\n46.      An example of the pre- and post-statehood continuity in education appears in\n         Capital Bank of St. Paul v. School District No. 85, 6 Dakota 248, 42 N.W. 774\n                                                                     (continued . . .)\n                                           -51-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\non the part of the early South Dakota government officials that the State was in\n\ncompliance with its constitutional mandate.\n\n[¶87.]         The early history of South Dakota after statehood is also consistent\n\nwith that view. In 1905, in the Fourth Annual Review of Progress of South Dakota,\n\nthe South Dakota Historical Society declared, “All the state educational\n\ninstitutions, from the common schools to the university, as well as the private\n\nschools and colleges, are in a flourishing condition.” Fourth Annual Review of the\n\nProgress of South Dakota for 1905, 3 South Dakota Historical Collections 33 (1906).\n\nMoreover, Gen. Beadle’s 1906 Memoirs, frequently cited by Plaintiffs, evidence no\n\nthought that the State since 1889 was out of compliance with its constitutional\n\neducational obligations. Instead, a jubilant Gen. Beadle declared, “[n]ever before in\n\nits history has the [S]tate of South Dakota been so prosperous as at the present\n\ntime.” Memoirs of Gen. Beadle, supra, at 239.\n\n[¶88.]         There are no cases from this Court between 1889 to the present\n\nconcerning claims such as are now before us, that being the issue of the State’s\n\nfailure to comply with funding mandates of Article VIII. 47 However, this Court in\n\n\n_____________________________\n( . . . continued)\n          (1889), where the Dakota Territorial Supreme Court held school boards\n          possess only such powers as were expressly conferred on them by the\n          Territorial Legislature and other powers must necessarily be implied to have\n          been given them in order to carry out the purposes of their organization and\n          are incidental to the exercise of the powers expressly granted to it or\n          necessarily implied. Such legal structure and limits were applied to the\n          school districts after statehood as well. Stephens v. Jones, 24 S.D. 97, 123\n          N.W. 705, 707 (1909).\n\n47.      The State’s compliance with Article VIII was challenged under an equal\n         protection argument in Deerfield Hutterian Ass’n v. Ipswich Board of\n                                                                    (continued . . .)\n                                          -52-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\nan early case did recognize the authority of the Legislature over education including\n\nfinancial effects on taxpayers. Stephens v. Jones, 24 S.D. 97, 123 N.W. 705, 707\n\n(1909). In Stephens, we held that absent a constitutional limitation, the Legislature\n\nhad the inherent plenary power to create or alter school districts “although it may\n\nmake taxation more burdensome.” Id. Later, in State ex rel. Finger v. Weedman, 55\n\nS.D. 343, 226 N.W. 348, 364 (1929), we did have occasion to comment that Article\n\nVIII, Section 1 was a “mandate to the Legislature to provide a system of schools\n\nwherein education in ‘morality and intelligence’ shall be given to all.”\n\n[¶89.]         Plaintiffs argue that various legislative enactments over the years\n\n“expressly recognized that, for the benefit of the people of the State of South Dakota\n\nand the improvement of this and future generations of youth, it is essential that all\n\nof our youth be given the fullest opportunity to learn and develop their intellect and\n\ntheir skills to become productive and contributing members of society.” 48 This\n\nargument that subsequent legislative enactments amounted to a de facto\n\namendment of Article VIII suffers from two flaws. First, as has been previously\n\nnoted, the Constitution is the “mother law.” Poppen, 520 N.W.2d at 242. Thus, the\n\nLegislature cannot define the scope of a constitutional provision by subsequent\n\nlegislation. Id. Second, it is illogical to say that the Legislature has raised the\n\n\n_____________________________\n( . . . continued)\n          Education, 468 F. Supp. 1219 (D.S.D. 1979). It was again challenged as an\n          equal protection claim in Hughes County Sixth Circuit Court in Bezdichek v.\n          State, 1994 S.D.C.C. 34, Hughes County Civ. No. 91-209 (S.D. 6th Jud. Cir.\n          1994). Both challenges were unsuccessful.\n\n48.      SDCL 13-14-7, 13-6-2(1), 13-6-2(2), 13-6-2(3), 13-1-12.1 and 13-33-19 are\n         some of the examples cited by Plaintiffs.\n\n                                           -53-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\nconstitutional bar in education policy defining what constitutes an adequate\n\neducation by enacting various statutes to that effect and yet simultaneously is the\n\nsource of the problem by failing to create a mechanism which produces that quality\n\nof education it authorized. While the Legislature certainly has the constitutional\n\nprerogative to enact statutes which enhance the quality of an education, that is a\n\nfar cry from saying it is mandated to do so by Article VIII.\n\n[¶90.]       Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. observed that constitutional\n\nprovisions must be allowed some play “for the joints of the machine.” Green v.\n\nSiegel, Barnett & Schutz, 1996 S.D. 146, ¶ 32 n.11, 557 N.W.2d 396, 405 n.11\n\n(quoting Mo., Kan. & Tex. Ry. Co. of Tex. v. May, 194 U.S. 267, 268, 24 S. Ct. 638,\n\n639, 48 L. Ed. 2d 971 (1904)). Phrases such as “general and uniform,” “all suitable\n\nmeans,” “advantages and opportunities of education,” and “thorough and efficient\n\nsystem of common schools” invite such an approach.\n\n[¶91.]       Such words, however, are far from meaningless. At oral argument, the\n\nState suggested that the Legislature possessed the constitutional prerogative to cut\n\nits aid to the schools in half or eliminate it altogether. Such an argument is clearly\n\nat odds with the constitutional terminology adopted in 1889. See, supra, note 36. It\n\nis also not supported by the historical background as discussed herein.\n\nConstitutions are enacted to prohibit something or to authorize something. See,\n\ne.g., Apa v. Butler, 2001 S.D. 147, ¶ 36, 638 N.W.2d 57, 70. They are not drafted to\n\nbe purposeless or accomplish nothing. In re McKennan’s Estate, 25 S.D. 369, 126\n\nN.W.611, 617 (1910) (“Constitutions are supposed to be prepared with much care\n\n\n\n\n                                         -54-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\nand deliberation. It will not do to assume that such important instruments contain\n\nany idle or meaningless phrases.”).\n\n[¶92.]       Thus, if a constitution has a meaning, what is that meaning? Are we\n\nto declare that South Dakota is permanently stuck in the school system of 1889\n\nwith its country school houses, chalk slates and McGuffey Readers? Certainly not.\n\nThis Court’s balancing of the application of the scope of Article VIII and the\n\nchanging trends in education was examined in State ex rel. Prchal v. Dailey:\n\n             What would have been considered a good average education in\n             1881 would not be so considered today. Standards of education\n             have advanced, and methods of teaching have changed. But we\n             think it is elementary that the people through their Legislature\n             and the Constitution have a right to control and prescribe the\n             limits to which they will go in supplying education to the\n             children and youth of the state at public expense. Neither\n             educators nor administrative boards can expend public funds for\n             education, unless the education for which it is expended is\n             authorized by law.\n\n57 S.D. 554, 234 N.W. 45, 47 (1931).\n\n[¶93.]              While Plaintiffs mount an impressive public policy argument\n\nbased on equitable principles, this is not an equitable issue. Rather, it is an issue of\n\nconstruction of our Constitution which alone controls the resolution of this case.\n\nThere certainly is room in the drafting of Article VIII for a difference of legal\n\nopinions. However, in this Court’s sole early review of Article VIII, we stated that a\n\nstatute will be declared unconstitutional in violation of Article VIII only when we\n\nare satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that it conflicts with that article. In re\n\nState Bonds, 7 S.D. 42, 63 N.W. 223, 224 (1895). “A reasonable doubt upon the\n\n\n\n\n                                          -55-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\nquestion must be solved in favor of the legislative act, and the act sustained.” Id. 49\n\nWe have continued to follow that standard. See, e.g., Tracfone Wireless, Inc. v. S.D.\n\nDep’t of Revenue & Regulation, 2010 S.D. 6, ¶ 22, 778 N.W.2d 130, 137; Metro. Life\n\nIns. Co. v. Kinsman, 2008 S.D. 24, ¶ 18, 747 N.W.2d 653, 661. Today the Court once\n\nagain properly applies that standard of review. Thus, the words of this Court\n\nwritten shortly after statehood are appropriate:\n\n               The object to be sought is the thought of the constitution makers\n               in the use of this expression . . . . In case of doubt between\n               different constructions claimed for a constitutional or statutory\n               provision, or the meaning of a term, it is always allowable to\n               inquire what results would legitimately follow either, with a\n               view of ascertaining, if possible, whether such consequences\n               were contemplated or intended.\n\nState ex rel. McGee v. Gardner, 3 S.D. 553, 54 N.W. 606, 607 (1893). See also\n\nCummings, 495 N.W.2d at 499.\n\n[¶94.]         In conclusion, the foregoing establishes: (1) that there was no\n\nrevolution or even a significant change in education standards by the enactment of\n\nArt. VIII in 1889; (2) since 1889 there is no legal or historical basis which supports a\n\nclaim that prior to the filing of this action the State was out of compliance with Art.\n\nVIII; and (3) there is no legal or historical basis to analyze the facts of this case\n\n\n\n49.      Two members of the In re State Bonds Court had also been delegates to a\n         Constitutional Convention, and, in the case of Judge Kellam, all three\n         conventions. Green, 1996 S.D. 146, ¶ 19 n.10, 557 N.W.2d at 402 n.10;\n         McDonald, 90 S.D. 599, 246 N.W.2d at 97. The views of these constitutional\n         draftsmen have been found to be “particularly enlightening” in their\n         constitutional scholarship after they joined the South Dakota Supreme Court.\n         Green, 1996 S.D. 146, ¶ 19 n.10, 557 N.W.2d at 402 n.10. In McDonald, the\n         Court held that “the likelihood of misapprehension” by Kellam’s\n         constitutional analysis “is too remote to be seriously entertained.” 246\n         N.W.2d at 97.\n\n                                           -56-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\nunder a different standard than was done by the trial court. Thus, Article VIII sets\n\na constitutional floor for support of education from which the Legislature, not this\n\nCourt, can ascend.\n\n                                THE FACTUAL ISSUE 50\n\n[¶95.]          Plaintiffs offered evidence from six school districts called “focus\n\ndistricts,” which include the Faith, Doland, Florence, Bon Homme, Willow Lake and\n\nRapid City districts, as proof of state-wide deficiencies in funding compliance with\n\nArticle VIII.\n\n[¶96.]          Dr. Rick Melmer was formerly the South Dakota Secretary of\n\nEducation. While in that position, he testified to visiting over 100 of the 161 school\n\ndistricts in South Dakota. He concluded that the conditions claimed by Plaintiffs to\n\nexist in the six focus districts are not representative of the situation around South\n\nDakota. 51 Even if this foundational hurdle is cleared by Plaintiffs, they still have to\n\ncontend with the trial court’s extensive findings of fact. The trial court entered 433\n\ndetailed findings of fact concerning the six focus districts which cover 83 pages. In\n\nlarge part, the trial court concluded the generally negative testimony by\n\nsuperintendents and others from the focus districts was not as probative as other\n\nmore positive testimony and evidence presented. Its findings are more in\n\n\n\n50.      We base our decision on the factual record presented to the trial court and\n         not on any subsequent enactments by the Legislature.\n\n51.      Perhaps for that reason, the trial court also entered extensive findings of fact\n         on the following school districts: Sanborn Central, Miller, Avon, Faulkton\n         Area, Hamlin, Sisseton, White River, McLaughlin, Shannon County, and\n         Flandreau. The trial court found that each of these school districts was\n         providing a constitutionally adequate education.\n\n                                            -57-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\nconformity with Britton-Hecla’s Superintendent Don Kirkegaard, also a member of\n\nthe State Board of Education, who testified that, in his opinion, not a single district\n\nin the state lacked sufficient resources to prepare its students to find meaningful\n\nemployment, compete effectively in the economy, have the opportunity for higher\n\neducation, and function as capable voters and jurors. Suffice it to say that the trial\n\ncourt’s appraisal of those districts was substantially more positive than that of\n\nPlaintiffs’ witnesses. This led to a finding by the trial court that each of the focus\n\ndistricts was providing a constitutionally adequate education.\n\n[¶97.]       The Court today enters into a comparison of the factual evidence\n\nsubmitted to the trial court by the Plaintiffs and the State. The trial court in large\n\npart found the factual presentation of the State to be the most probative and\n\nentered findings of fact accordingly. Although this Court finds no “clear error” in\n\nthe trial court’s findings on this subject, the correct analysis should be whether\n\nthose findings are clearly erroneous. Action Carrier, Inc. v. United Nat’l Ins. Co.,\n\n2005 S.D. 57, ¶ 11, 697 N.W.2d 387, 391 (“The trial court’s findings of fact are\n\npresumed correct and we defer to those findings unless the evidence clearly\n\npreponderates against them.”).\n\n                            1)     Faith School District\n\n[¶98.]       The Faith School District is located in northwest South Dakota serving\n\nstudents primarily in Meade County. There were 194 students enrolled in the Faith\n\nSchool District during the 2008-2009 school year and the superintendent\n\nanticipated enrollment would continue to be stable or decline slightly. The total\n\nper-student expenditure for the school year ending in 2007 was $7,688. In 2008,\n\n\n                                          -58-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\nFaith received money under the state-funded sparsity adjustment for the third\n\nstraight fiscal year. The amount was $90,000 to $100,000. The trial court found\n\nclasses in Faith were held in a combination of modular classrooms and a\n\ngymnasium in its former school building.\n\n[¶99.] Plaintiffs rely on testimony from the superintendent of the Faith School\n\nDistrict who testified to a lack of sufficient general funds leading to cuts in staff,\n\nprograms, and services. The superintendent testified to using opt-outs and\n\nindicated consolidation was not an option. He further expressed reservations over\n\nthe effectiveness of televised instruction and concerns over limited course offerings.\n\nFinally, the superintendent expressed concern of the expansion of the duties of\n\nadministrative staff beyond their capabilities.\n\n[¶100.]      With regard to the superintendent’s testimony over funding cuts, the\n\nnecessity of opt-outs, and the impracticability of consolidation, the trial court found\n\nopt-outs were part of the funding system and that Dupree was 23 miles away and\n\nalready shared programs with Faith, making consolidation an option. It also found\n\nthe school had “state of the art technology,” offered a number of classes through\n\ninteractive television, and that the superintendent himself stressed the student\n\nbody’s “21st century skills” in a grant application. Although the superintendent\n\nshowed concern that students had failed language courses taken through televised\n\ninstruction, he conceded students could fail a live class as well and did not testify to\n\noverall failure rates.\n\n[¶101.]       The trial court found that despite the superintendent’s concerns over\n\nlimited course offerings, Faith offered all courses necessary for students to qualify\n\n\n                                           -59-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\nfor Opportunity and Regent Scholarships and that Faith actually had two Regent\n\nScholars in 2008. It also offered advanced placement courses through the internet.\n\nWith regard to technical course offerings, the trial court found the school district\n\noffered a number of rotating courses through an area services agency in subjects as\n\ndiverse as Building Trades and Health Occupations.\n\n[¶102.]      As to the superintendent’s contentions concerning expansion of the\n\nduties of administrative staff, the trial court found Faith had 197 students in its\n\nentire K-12 program. This works out to an average class size of 15 students. To\n\nadminister this system, the superintendent was assisted by an elementary principal\n\nand a guidance director and also received management support services from an\n\neducational services agency. The trial court found that the school district accepted\n\na large number of students through open enrollment, indicating that the school and\n\nits staff were not so overburdened that they could not handle the number of\n\nstudents.\n\n[¶103.]      Despite the concerns over funding issues raised by its superintendent,\n\nthe trial court found that, among other things, the Faith School District provided a\n\nconstitutionally adequate education. Plaintiffs have not shown that these findings\n\nare clearly erroneous.\n\n                           2)     Doland School District\n\n[¶104.]      The Doland School District is located in northeast South Dakota,\n\nprimarily in Spink County. The school district had 145 students enrolled in the\n\n2008-2009 school year. Its total per student expenditure for the school year ending\n\nin 2007 was $9,022. For the 2006-2007 school year, the trial court found Doland\n\n\n                                         -60-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\nhad total general fund expenditures of $1,273,364. That same year, Doland\n\nmaintained a general fund reserve balance of $644,523, approximately 50% of its\n\nannual general fund.\n\n[¶105.]      Plaintiffs rely on testimony from the superintendent of the Doland\n\nSchool District regarding struggles to meet financial obligations, the necessity of\n\nopt-outs, and the impracticability of consolidation. In terms of educational\n\nopportunity, the superintendent testified to understaffing and the necessity of\n\ncombining elementary classes. Other areas of concern for the superintendent were\n\nout-of-date textbooks, cuts in agricultural and technical courses, and understaffing\n\nin its two Hutterite colony schools.\n\n[¶106.]      Although the Doland superintendent expressed concerns over financial\n\nstruggles, he also testified Doland was not currently facing financial difficulties.\n\nDoland had opted out of the limitation on the general fund levy and the trial court\n\nfound this gave it the ability to levy for an additional $227,000 every year in\n\naddition to state aid formula money. Accordingly, the court found Doland was able\n\nto serve its student population in a constitutionally sufficient manner. The court\n\nalso found the distances between surrounding districts did not pose a barrier to\n\nconsolidation with three districts within 20 miles of Doland.\n\n[¶107.]      Regarding understaffing and combining elementary classes, the trial\n\ncourt found Doland had some classes as small as “five or so” students per grade.\n\nThus, the court found “nothing improper” about combining classes. The\n\nsuperintendent’s contentions concerning out-of-date textbooks were addressed by\n\n\n\n\n                                          -61-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\nthe general fund reserve balance and the fact the district could levy for additional\n\ncapital outlay funds for books.\n\n[¶108.]      The trial court attributed the lack of agriculture classes to evidence of\n\ndeclining student involvement in those courses over several years. As for technical\n\ncourses, the court found the district offered Family and Consumer Science, Personal\n\nFinance, Computer Training, and Occupation Prep.\n\n[¶109.]      Based upon its consideration of the foregoing funding issues, the trial\n\ncourt found Doland was not suffering from financial difficulties and that predictions\n\nof future deficiencies were too premature for consideration. It concluded that\n\nDoland was providing a constitutionally adequate education. Plaintiffs have not\n\nshown that these findings are clearly erroneous.\n\n                          3)      Florence School District\n\n[¶110.]      The Florence School District is located in northeast South Dakota,\n\nprimarily in Codington County. The trial court found the Florence School District\n\nhad 241 students enrolled for the 2007-2008 school year. For the school year ending\n\nin 2007, its total per-student expenditure was $7,229.\n\n[¶111.]      Plaintiffs reference testimony from the Florence superintendent\n\nconcerning funding difficulties, deficit spending, and lack of sufficient course\n\nofferings, extracurricular activities and administrative personnel. The\n\nsuperintendent testified he did not believe Florence was providing an adequate\n\neducational opportunity and Plaintiffs buttress that testimony on appeal with\n\nreferences to testimony to the same effect from two state board of education\n\nmembers and a state legislator.\n\n\n                                          -62-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\n[¶112.]       As for funding difficulties, the trial court found Florence had a general\n\nfund balance of over $300,000 at the time of trial and had not opted out in its tax\n\nlevies. Thus, an opt-out remained available to it. The court also held consolidation\n\nwas an option for Florence with two other school districts lying within\n\napproximately 20 miles. In that regard, the court noted Florence was already\n\ncooperating with nearby school districts in certain course offerings and sporting\n\nactivities.\n\n[¶113.]       With reference to course offerings, the trial court found Florence\n\nprovided all math and science classes required to meet distinguished track\n\ncurriculum requirements. Although concerns were expressed with televised class\n\nofferings, the acceptability of televised instruction did not equate with deficient\n\ninstruction. Specific concerns with televised physics classes were addressed by\n\nemployment of an on-site teacher who rotated with another school. As for technical\n\ncourses, Florence offered agriculture classes at its own school and also provided\n\naccess to ten different classes at a multi-district facility in nearby Watertown. The\n\nFlorence superintendent admitted the multi-district classes provided an excellent\n\nopportunity for juniors and seniors. Deficiencies in fine arts offerings appeared to\n\nbe more attributable to televised scheduling issues than lack of resources.\n\n[¶114.]       The trial court found there were 241 students with less than 20\n\nstudents per class in the elementary school and high school classes of 12 to 25\n\nstudents per grade. The superintendent was assisted in his administration of this\n\nsystem by two lead elementary teachers carrying out elementary principal duties.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -63-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\n[¶115.]      Plaintiffs also reference the testimony of two state board of education\n\nmembers and a legislator who buttressed the superintendent’s criticisms of the\n\nFlorence School District during pretrial depositions. However, during trial they\n\nequivocated in their evaluations after being presented with additional information\n\nconcerning the conditions and course offerings at the school.\n\n[¶116.]      The trial court found that, despite the above funding issues, the\n\nFlorence School District continued to maintain a “healthy” fund balance and\n\nprovided a constitutionally adequate education. Plaintiffs have not shown that\n\nthese findings are clearly erroneous.\n\n                         4)    Bon Homme School District\n\n[¶117.]      The Bon Homme School District is located in southeast South Dakota\n\nin Bon Homme County. The trial court found there were approximately 550\n\nstudents enrolled in the Bon Homme School District for the 2008-2009 school year.\n\nThe per-student expenditure for the school year ending in 2007 was $7,483.\n\n[¶118.]      Plaintiffs challenge conditions in the Bon Homme School District,\n\npointing to the superintendent’s concerns over funding difficulties and rejected opt-\n\nouts. He also testified that consolidation was not an option. The superintendent\n\nindicated Bon Homme had instituted a four-day school week and was experiencing\n\nclassroom overcrowding with teachers handling as many as 145 students in core\n\nclasses. As a result, he expressed concerns that teachers were “burning out” and\n\nmight leave. Plaintiffs sought to buttress the superintendent’s testimony with\n\ntestimony from a state legislator that the district did not have sufficient funds to\n\nmeet its expenditures.\n\n\n                                         -64-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\n[¶119.]      As for funding difficulties, the trial court found the Bon Homme\n\ndistrict received impact aid funds for its needs and made appropriate use of those\n\nfunds. It further found the district was operating four elementary schools within a\n\n15-mile radius of Tyndall and that three of those schools had very few students.\n\nOne was a school in a Hutterite colony with only three to ten students in each\n\ngrade. The other two small schools averaged only seven to eleven students per\n\ngrade. Thus, as testified to by Dr. Melmer, the trial court found the school district\n\nwas maintaining too many facilities for the size of its enrollment. It further found\n\nthat some intra-district consolidation would save transportation, maintenance, and\n\nfuel costs, particularly if one or more of the elementary schools were closed. In\n\naddition, the court found two other school districts within a 20-mile radius of\n\nTyndall provided additional consolidation options.\n\n[¶120.]      With regard to the four-day school week, the superintendent testified\n\nfunding was not the main reason for the change, though it did save some money.\n\nClassroom overcrowding occurred in a single geometry class and involved an excess\n\nof five or fewer students. The issue did not occur again in a subsequent school year\n\nand overall student enrollment was declining. The trial court found no reason to\n\nexpect overcrowding would occur again and that the issue was moot. The figure of\n\n145 students in core classes was a reference to the total number of students per\n\nteacher in some core areas, not the number of students in one class. The overall\n\nratio of students to staff was approximately 13-to-1 in 2007. Despite concerns over\n\nteachers leaving, the trial court found the average number of years of teaching\n\n\n\n\n                                         -65-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\nexperience in the district was 14.2 with over 30% of the teachers holding advanced\n\ndegrees.\n\n[¶121.]      A legislator’s testimony claimed as supporting the superintendent’s\n\nconcerns was equivocal as to overall conditions in the Bon Homme School District.\n\nWhile the legislator shared some of the superintendent’s concerns, the trial court\n\nfound that he also testified the school district was providing an excellent education.\n\nAlthough the legislator testified the school district was under-funded, he further\n\ntestified it was under-funded in the sense of overspending its resources, not that it\n\ndid not have sufficient resources. In that regard, the legislator agreed it was not\n\nadvisable for the school district to operate four attendance centers.\n\n[¶122.]      Based upon its review of the financial circumstances in the Bon\n\nHomme School District, the trial court found the district’s claims of dire conditions\n\nand that it would soon be “broke” were premature and that it was providing a\n\nconstitutionally adequate education. Plaintiffs have not shown that these findings\n\nare clearly erroneous.\n\n                         5)   Willow Lake School District\n\n[¶123.]      The Willow Lake School District is located in northeast South Dakota\n\nin Clark County. The trial court found the student body in Willow Lake was small\n\nand steadily decreasing. At the time of trial, there were 195 students, which was\n\ndown from 212 students five years earlier. The school district’s total per-student\n\nexpenditure for the school year ending in 2007 was $9,066.\n\n[¶124.]      Plaintiffs rely on testimony from the superintendent for the Willow\n\nLake School District. The superintendent testified that the district was not\n\n\n                                         -66-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\nprovided with sufficient funding resources and that consolidation was not an option.\n\nHe testified about concerns over his workload and a lack of vacation time, budget\n\ncuts and salary freezes, the necessity of opt-outs, deficiencies in course offerings,\n\nand outdated textbooks.\n\n[¶125.]       The trial court found the school district was $124,000 short in its\n\ngeneral fund. However, it also found that, while the district had opted out so that it\n\ncould levy up to $200,000 per year in general funds, it was actually levying only\n\n$100,000 to $125,000. The court found a complete levy would “go a long way”\n\ntoward overcoming the shortage. The court also found three schools in a 26-mile\n\nradius of Willow Lake that already offered sports on a cooperative basis with the\n\nschool district and would provide it with consolidation options.\n\n[¶126.]       The trial court addressed the superintendent’s claims concerning his\n\nworkload, finding that there were 195 students in the entire school district, i.e., an\n\naverage of 15 students per class, that the superintendent was assisted by a “capable\n\nhigh school principal,” and that he also received administrative assistance from an\n\neducational services agency. The superintendent also testified he was assisted by a\n\nsecretary and a business manager. Regarding budget cuts and salary freezes, the\n\ntrial court found the district lacked funds and made cuts before passing its opt-out\n\nand that it had the ability to pass an opt-out sooner and did not do so. It further\n\nfound the superintendent stated at trial that teacher salaries were competitive for a\n\nschool of its size.\n\n[¶127.]       In the area of course offerings, the trial court found that Willow Lake\n\nSchool District provided all classes the students needed to compete for Opportunity\n\n\n                                          -67-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\nand Regent Scholarships. The court found that the school district met the\n\nminimum state curriculum standards for math and also offered the requisite units\n\nto meet the distinguished criteria for the Opportunity Scholarship. The court also\n\nfound the school district offered a number of technical courses in family and\n\nconsumer science and several agriculture courses.\n\n[¶128.]      Finally, as to out-of-date textbooks, the trial court found textbooks\n\ncould be purchased with capital outlay or general funds and that the school district\n\nhad not taken advantage of its ability to raise funds to take care of this issue.\n\nBased upon testimony from Dr. Melmer, it further found Willow Lake’s out-of-date\n\ntextbooks were not representative of conditions around the state.\n\n[¶129.]      Despite the superintendent’s funding issues regarding the Willow Lake\n\nSchool District, the trial court found that the district was providing a\n\nconstitutionally adequate education. Plaintiffs have not shown that these findings\n\nare clearly erroneous.\n\n                      6)     Rapid City Area School District\n\n[¶130.]      The Rapid City Area School District (Rapid City) is located in\n\nsouthwest South Dakota in Pennington County. It is the second largest school\n\ndistrict in the state. The trial court found that Rapid City operated 15 elementary\n\nschools, five middle schools, two traditional high schools, and two alternative high\n\nschools. Total enrollment was 13,115 for the 2007-2008 school year. The total per-\n\nstudent expenditure for the school year ending in 2007 was $6,554.\n\n[¶131.]      No authorized representative of Rapid City testified at trial. Instead,\n\nPlaintiffs rely on testimony from a former school board member. Plaintiffs\n\n\n                                          -68-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\nattempted to qualify him as an expert at trial, but the trial court declined to\n\nrecognize him as such because he did not have a degree in education\n\nadministration, was not a certified teacher or administrator, and admitted he was\n\nnot an expert in education administration. Thus, the trial court declined to consider\n\nthe former board member’s testimony regarding the requirements of No Child Left\n\nBehind and the “achievement gap” in Rapid City as expert testimony. Instead, the\n\ntrial court relied upon the expert testimony of defense expert Dr. John Murphy. Dr.\n\nMurphy had reviewed Rapid City, was favorably impressed, and opined that it was\n\nproviding the opportunity for an adequate education.\n\n[¶132.]      The former board member complained of insufficient resources,\n\ndepleted budget reserves, numerous staff cuts, and the removal of vocational\n\nofferings to a local technical college. The board member made specific complaints\n\nabout cuts in the number of guidance counselors, overcrowding, and the loss of a\n\nvirtual high school program.\n\n[¶133.]      Rapid City had an excess general fund balance each year from 2001 to\n\n2008 ranging from 9.5% to 15%. At the end of fiscal year 2008, the general fund\n\nbalance was equal to 10.5% of the total Rapid City general fund budget. The former\n\nboard member testified that if budgeted sums were fully expended as contemplated\n\nby the 2008-2009 preliminary budget, Rapid City would have a general fund excess\n\nfund balance at the end of the 2008-2009 school year in the amount of $4,000,000, or\n\n5% of the total budget.\n\n[¶134.]      Although Rapid City had made a number of budget and staff cuts, the\n\ntrial court also found that from 1998 to 2004, the school district experienced a\n\n\n                                         -69-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\ndecline of about 1,000 students. The counseling staff was reduced, but the trial\n\ncourt found the state does not require a specific ratio of guidance counselors to\n\nstudents. Foreign language programs were eliminated from the middle schools, but\n\nno data was provided as to how elimination of the programs might affect later\n\nstudent performance. There was also conflicting testimony regarding the staff cuts.\n\nAlthough the former board member testified to a reduction in certified staff, Rapid\n\nCity reports to the State indicated it had hired over 60 new employees in the\n\nprevious three years and that staff had not declined. The student-to-staff ratio was\n\n16-to-1 in the 2006-2007 school year.\n\n[¶135.]      Despite program cuts, the trial court found that Rapid City had\n\nextensive course offerings reflected in a 78-page manual listing high school classes\n\nfor the 2008-2009 school year. Rapid City provided the curriculum required by the\n\nState Department of Education and provided all course requirements for\n\nOpportunity and Regent Scholarships. Contrary to the former board member’s\n\ntestimony, the trial court found evidence that Rapid City offered a comprehensive\n\nrange of courses in technical areas, including subjects such as marketing and\n\nengineering principles. Vocational offerings at a local technical college were a dual\n\ncredit opportunity in addition to those courses offered at the high schools.\n\n[¶136.]      As with the previous focus districts, the trial court found that despite\n\nits funding issues, Rapid City was providing a constitutionally adequate education.\n\nIt further found that many of the former board member’s predictions of financial\n\ndifficulties predicated upon estimates of future spending were “premature.”\n\nPlaintiffs have not shown that these findings are clearly erroneous.\n\n\n                                         -70-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\n                                       CONCLUSION\n\n[¶137.]      When one analyzes the legal issue of the meaning of Article VIII and\n\nits history, they do not support the heightened legal interpretations advocated by\n\nPlaintiffs. Whether or not one accepts the focus districts as representative of the\n\nstate’s school districts, the trial court’s findings of fact are not clearly erroneous and\n\nconclusions of law are not in error. As Plaintiffs fail on both the legal and factual\n\nissues, there is no necessity to go further into any causation issues.\n\n[¶138.]      Article VIII was drawn from the public policy and language of 1889. It\n\nmay seem today to some to be archaic and incapable of serving the state’s current\n\neducational needs and public policy goals. However, this Court is “not concerned\n\nwith the wisdom or expediency or the need” for this constitutional provision, but\n\nonly whether it limits the power of the Legislature and, if so, in what manner.\n\nPoppen, 520 N.W.2d at 242 (citing Queenside Hills Realty Co., Inc. v. Saxl, 328 U.S.\n\n80, 82, 66 S. Ct. 850, 851, 90 L. Ed. 1096 (1945)). While the meaning of words such\n\nas “a general and uniform system of public schools,” “adopt all suitable means to\n\nsecure the people the advantages and opportunities of education” and a “thorough\n\nand efficient system of schools,” may be reviewed in the context of the times as this\n\nCourt did in Dailey, the words themselves do not change. See Dailey, 57 S.D. 554,\n\n234 N.W. at 48. They set the standard in 1889 and still do today. As Justice Hugo\n\nBlack once observed concerning the issue of constitutional interpretation:\n\n             I realize that many good and able [persons] have eloquently\n             spoken and written, sometimes in rhapsodical strains, about the\n             duty of this Court to keep the Constitution in tune with the\n             times. The idea is that the Constitution must be changed from\n             time to time and that this Court is charged with a duty to make\n             those changes. For myself, I must with all deference reject that\n\n                                           -71-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\n             philosophy. The Constitution makers knew the need for change\n             and provided for it. Amendments suggested by the people’s\n             elected representatives can be submitted to the people or their\n             selected agents for ratification. That method of change was good\n             for our Fathers, and being some-what old-fashioned I must add\n             it is good enough for me.\n\nGriswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 522, 85 S. Ct. 1678, 1702, 14 L. Ed. 2d 510,\n\n537 (1965) (Black, J., dissenting).\n\n[¶139.]      The issue of education is a great and weighty one. The United States\n\nSupreme Court correctly set forth the limited function of courts in conducting a\n\nlegal review of the acts of a legislative body and the facts surrounding the adoption\n\nof a constitutional or legislative standard. See, e.g., DeCoteau v. Dist. Cnty. Ct. for\n\nthe 10th Jud. Dist., 420 U.S. 425, 449, 95 S. Ct. 1082, 1095, 43 L. Ed. 2d 300 (1975).\n\nIn light of a claim of “calamitous results” which the parties claimed could flow from\n\nthe Court’s decision, the Court observed that “these competing pleas are not for us\n\nto adjudge, for our task here is a narrow one. . . . Some might wish [our\n\nconstitutional drafters] had spoken differently, but we cannot remake history.” Id.\n\n[¶140.]      The Court holds today that Plaintiffs have failed to establish beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt a constitutional violation of Article VIII. I agree. That being the\n\ncase, our Constitution mandates that these kinds of disputed issues are to be\n\nbrought before the people’s popularly elected Legislature. That body, and not this\n\nCourt, is the appropriate forum for resolution of such issues. In so concluding,\n\nhowever, I echo the views of the United States Supreme Court in San Antonio\n\n\n\n\n                                          -72-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\nIndependent School District:\n\n             Nothing this Court holds today in any way detracts from our\n             historic dedication to public education. We are in complete\n             agreement that ‘the grave significance of education both to the\n             individual and to our society’ cannot be doubted.\n\n411 U.S. at 30, 93 S. Ct. at 1295.\n\n[¶141.]      For the above reasons, I concur in result.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -73-\n\f",

W.H.H. Beadle, addressed the crowd. He spoke of the\n\nimportance of education to the future of the state:\n\n                    The advance of every free state depends upon the broad\n             intelligence of its citizens. Because we are a state, republican in\n             form, education of all the people becomes the highest duty of the\n             state. Nothing can be so important except the struggle for the\n             very existence of the republic. The genius of the poorest must\n             have equal chance with the opportunity of the rich. The true\n             state will not disregard the welfare of the humblest orphan. Our\n             resources of farm, orchard, and mine, our soils and our water\n             supply, our rocks, our clays, must be scientifically studied and\n             mastered; our livestock, our entire productive possibilities\n             require a scientifically trained and educated people. As our\n             population doubles and crowds our area, this need increases.\n             This training should be masterly and broad and prepare as fully\n             also for all civic and social duties. Not for wage earning alone,\n             nor for money making alone, must we educate. All skill, all\n             technical training, all science, all the industries, can not\n             together, but unaided, save and develop all that human society\n             and government have in charge for our permanent welfare.\n             Technology is required for the world’s progress, but it is not all\n             the story of man’s advancement.\n\n                                            ***\n\n             The mastery of history, government, literature, philosophy; the\n             knowledge of all the world and its mutual and conflicting\n             interests, of the origin and nature of human society and “the\n             grand results of time” must be the possession of those who are to\n             lead us in the profound questions bound up in the state and\n             national and international interests.\n\n                                            ***\n\n             The great, final, single, comprehensive aim of education and of\n             the highest education is the equipment of men for moral\n             leadership. I believe that all this should be done inside the\n             state, that all scholars, all teachers and all trained citizens\n\n                                         -1-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\n              should be made by institutions within our own state. Within our\n              borders, under our laws and institutions, under the discipline of\n              our own conditions and inspired by our state pride, all this can\n              best be done. All the elements of, and inspiration for it, should\n              be thoroughly given in our common schools, from our libraries\n              and at our firesides. 1\n\nGeneral Beadle’s convictions are embedded in the language of South Dakota’s\n\nConstitution.\n\n[¶2.]         Article VIII, Section 1 of the South Dakota Constitution emphasizes\n\nthe importance of a “general and uniform system of public schools” and places the\n\nduty to establish the system on the State Legislature:\n\n              The stability of a republican form of government depending on\n              the morality and intelligence of the people, it shall be the duty of\n              the Legislature to establish and maintain a general and uniform\n              system of public schools wherein tuition shall be without charge,\n              and equally open to all; and to adopt all suitable means to secure\n              to the people the advantages and opportunities of education.\n\n(Emphasis added.) The Legislature also has the duty to fund education. Article\n\nVIII, Section 15 of the South Dakota Constitution directs the Legislature to provide\n\nthrough general and local taxation as follows:\n\n              The Legislature shall make such provision by general taxation\n              and by authorizing the school corporations to levy such\n              additional taxes as with the income from the permanent school\n              fund shall secure a thorough and efficient system of common\n              schools throughout the state.\n\n[¶3.]         Whether the Legislature has met the constitutional requirements of\n\nadequately funding education is the central question in this action.

Specifically, the plaintiffs ask for a declaratory\n\nruling that Article VIII, Sections 1 and 15 mean (1) “that the South Dakota\n\nConstitution entitles all children to a free, adequate and quality public education,”\n\nand (2) that the present system of funding is unconstitutional because it does not\n\nprovide all children with an adequate and quality education.\n\n[¶4.]         Clearly, the language of the South Dakota Constitution guarantees\n\nevery child a free public education to provide them with “the advantages and\n\nopportunities of education.” What this means and its relationship to funding,\n\nhowever, is a trickier question. 2 To answer that question, we look at the plain\n\n\n\n2.      Defendants are the State of South Dakota, the South Dakota Department of\n        Education (SDDOE) (a subdivision of South Dakota state government), the\n        South Dakota Board of Education, and three state officials in their official\n        capacities: The Governor, M. Michael Rounds; the State Treasurer, Vernon L.\n        Larson; and the South Dakota Secretary of Education, Dr. Rick Melmer.\n        Either since the trial of this matter or the appeal to this Court, the state\n        officials named as defendants have been replaced in office by election or, in\n        Dr. Melmer’s case, through resignation and a subsequent appointment. The\n        proceedings are as follows:\n\n        In June 2006, the plaintiffs filed a complaint against the defendants in circuit\n        court for the Sixth Judicial Circuit in Hughes County, South Dakota. The\n        complaint asked the court to: a) declare that the public school finance system\n        violates the education clauses of the state constitution; b) prohibit the\n        defendants from “administering, enforcing, and/or funding” the public school\n        finance system; c) maintain judicial oversight over the legislative and\n        executive branches of state government to correct “constitutional\n        inadequacies.”\n\n        In March 2007, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject\n        matter jurisdiction on the ground that the plaintiffs’ claims were not\n        justiciable. The plaintiffs filed a motion for partial summary judgment\n                                                                     (continued . . .)\n                                             -3-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\nmeaning of the language and the intent of its drafters.

The trial court did, however, dismiss the\n      plaintiffs’ claims for any remedy beyond declaratory relief under the\n      Declaratory Judgments Act. See SDCL ch. 21-24.

The\n              virtue, intelligence, and public happiness of a people, and all\n              that conduces to the advancement of the prosperity, wealth, and\n              power of a country, is intimately associated with, and dependent\n              upon, the development of the educational interest of the state.\n              In communities where truth, virtue, intelligence and knowledge\n              prevail, there crime is rare, and poverty almost unknown.

He was afraid that territorial school lands (totaling in the millions of\n\nacres) would be sold to land speculators at low prices to meet the short term needs\n\nof public education. 12 General Beadle and other founders were determined to\n\npreserve the school lands until their value increased so that they could be sold for\n\nhigher prices and provide maximum support for public education into the future.13\n\nGeneral Beadle’s plan was that all money from the sale of school lands (for not less\n\nthan $10 per acre) would be safely invested in a school fund to permanently endow\n\neducation. 14 Clearly, ardent support of public education motivated the founders of\n\nour state.\n\n[¶11.]         Public education and desire for permanent funding prominently took\n\ntheir place in the state’s draft constitutions.

The court wrote:\n\n               From this history, we can conclude the framers intended the\n               education article as a mandate to the state legislature to provide\n               an education system of a character which provides [state]\n               students with a uniform opportunity to become equipped for\n               their future roles as citizens, participants in the political system,\n               and competitors both economically and intellectually.\n\nCampbell Cnty.

The constitutional language and intent of the framers guarantee\n\nthe children of South Dakota a constitutional right to an education that provides\n\nthem with the opportunity to prepare for their future roles as citizens, participants in\n\nthe political system, and competitors both economically and intellectually. The\n\nconstitutional mandate does not contemplate a system that fails to educate all\n\nchildren or leaves pockets of inadequate conditions and achievement as a result of\n\ninsufficient funding. As General Beadle so eloquently stated, “The genius of the\n\npoorest must have equal chance with the opportunity of the rich.” Coursey, supra\n\nnote 1, at 87.

SDCL 13-\n\n16-1. 23\n\n[¶19.]        Prior to 1995, the Legislature funded school districts through an\n\nexpenditure driven funding formula. The more a school district spent, the more\n\nstate funding it received. The constitutionality of the formula was unsuccessfully\n\nchallenged on equal protection grounds in state circuit court in 1994. See Bezdichek\n\nv. State, 1994 S.D.C.C. 34, Hughes County Civ. No. 91-209 (S.D. 6th Jud. Cir. 1994).\n\nThe circuit court decision was not appealed. The South Dakota Legislature,\n\nhowever, revised the formula in the 1995 legislative session to take effect January\n\n1, 1997. The revised formula funded districts based on an established per student\n\nallocation (PSA), a district’s enrollment, and the amount of local property tax levied.\n\n[¶20.]        The revised formula requires a multi-step calculation starting with the\n\nlegislatively designated PSA. SDCL 13-13-10.1(4). The 1995 Legislature set the\n\nPSA at $3,350 beginning in fiscal year (FY) 1998 to be increased annually by the\n\n_____________________________\n( . . . continued)\n          evidence produced.

School districts segregate their revenues into a number of separate fund\n          accounts including the general fund, the capital outlay fund, the special\n          education fund, and the pension fund. SDCL 13-16-2, 13-10-6. The general\n          fund is used for all of the operational costs of a school district, excluding\n          capital outlay and special education fund expenditures. SDCL 13-16-3.\n          Thus, the general fund is the source from which almost all of the school\n          district’s funding requirements must be met. Local revenue generally\n          accounts for approximately half the revenue in a school district’s general\n          fund. The remainder comes from state aid.\n                                                                          (continued . . .)\n\n                                           -14-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\nrate of inflation according to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or by 3%, whichever\n\nwas less. See 1995 S.D. Sess. Laws ch. 77, § 3. See also SDCL 13-13-10.1(3) - (4).\n\nAccordingly, the Legislature annually increased the PSA and, in some years, by\n\nmore than the inflation rate. By the time of trial, the PSA was $4,642.\n\n[¶21.]         Next, the formula establishes a school district’s “local need.” Local\n\nneed is the product of the PSA multiplied by a school district’s K-12 enrollment\n\ndetermined on a specified date in the fall. It may also include a “small school\n\nadjustment” if the enrollment is less than 600 students. SDCL 13-13-10.1(2A), (2C),\n\n(5). The small school adjustment increases the PSA by a fixed per pupil amount\n\naccording to a statutory sliding scale maximizing at $847.54. SDCL 13-13-\n\n10.1(2C). 24\n\n[¶22.]         Finally, the formula determines a school district’s “local effort,” which\n\nis the total amount of local property tax levied. The local effort is then subtracted\n\nfrom the district’s local need to arrive at the amount of state aid allocated to the\n\ndistrict. SDCL 13-13-10.1(6), -73.\n\n[¶23.]         In addition to revising the funding formula, the 1995 Legislature\n\ncapped the local property tax levy. The levy caps effectively limit the amount a\n\nschool district can raise locally. See 1995 S.D. Sess. Laws ch. 57, § 37; 1995 S.D.\n\nSess. Laws ch. 77, § 6. The 1995 Legislature originally capped levies at the\n\nfollowing amounts based upon three different classifications of local property:\n\n_____________________________\n( . . . continued)\n\n\n\n\n                                           -15-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\n$16.75 per thousand dollars of taxable valuation for non-agricultural land; $6.25 per\n\nthousand dollars of taxable valuation for agricultural land; and $10 per thousand\n\ndollars of taxable valuation for owner-occupied single family dwellings. Id. After\n\n1995, the Legislature steadily lowered these caps during every subsequent annual\n\nlegislative session. 25 By the time of trial, the following caps were in effect for taxes\n\npayable in 2009: $8.78 per thousand dollars of taxable valuation for non-\n\nagricultural land; $2.61 per thousand dollars of taxable valuation for agricultural\n\nland; and $4.10 per thousand dollars of taxable valuation for owner-occupied single\n\nfamily dwellings. 2008 S.D. Sess. Laws ch. 48, § 1.\n\n[¶24.]       The Legislature allows school districts to tax at less than the statutory\n\nmaximum levies, but the state aid formula imputes the maximum to the local\n\ndistrict in calculating its local effort. SDCL 10-12-42, 13-13-10.1(6). School districts\n\nmay also “opt out” of the maximum levies and tax at higher rates. SDCL 10-12-43.\n\nIf a school district opts out, the funds go into the school district’s general fund in\n\naddition to the funds received under the state aid formula. Id.\n\n[¶25.]       State funding based on the formula is the largest source of revenue for\n\nlocal districts. Local property taxes are usually the next major source of revenue.\n\n\n_____________________________\n( . . . continued)\n24.       The small school adjustment replaced the former “small school factor” in\n          2007. The small school factor was similarly designed to provide additional\n          assistance to smaller school districts.\n25.       See 1996 S.D. Sess. Laws ch. 69, § 5; 1997 S.D. Sess.

See S.D.\n\nConst. art. VIII, § 3. School districts also receive other funds for education-related\n\npurposes such as capital outlay and pension funds collected through local revenue\n\nand special education funds from federal, state, and local sources. A district may\n\nalso be eligible for a sparsity benefit based on enrollment, size, and distance\n\ncriteria. See SDCL 13-13-78 to -79. 26\n\nAlleged Funding System Flaws and Inadequacies\n\n[¶26.]         The plaintiffs identify problems with the school funding system that\n\nthey claim make it structurally flawed and inadequate. They claim that the system\n\nis arbitrary and irrational because funding is not based on actual costs of providing\n\nstudents with a constitutionally adequate education and does not align funding\n\nwith need.\n\n\n\n\n26.      Periodically, the Legislature has appropriated per student funds outside of\n         the state aid formula and funding for special programs such as consolidation\n         incentives, heating assistance, career and technical education grants, and\n         teacher compensation assistance. Further, the state has provided\n         technological assistance to the school districts including: internet service and\n         net management; provision of a student information management system\n         (SIMS) accessible to parents online; and maintenance and support of the\n         Dakota Digital video Network (DDN) used for distance learning. The state\n         has also provided funding assistance for: GEAR UP programs to assist\n         economically disadvantaged students; laptop computers and training for\n         teachers and technology coordinators; formative assessment tools; regional\n         agencies providing technical assistance to schools under the federal No Child\n         Left Behind Act (NCLB); online testing for student diagnostic purposes;\n         online curriculum assistance; online advanced placement courses and exam\n         review; and online access to DakotaSTEP test results measuring proficiency\n         for NCLB purposes.\n\n                                            -17-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\n[¶27.]       Other jurisdictions have found school funding systems unconstitutional\n\nbecause funding was not based on actual costs. The Montana Supreme Court in\n\nColumbia Falls Elementary School District No. 6 v. State, held that, “[u]nless\n\nfunding relates to needs such as academic standards, teacher pay, fixed costs, costs\n\nof special education, and performance standards, then the funding is not related to\n\nthe cornerstones of a quality education.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"887349\"><a href=\"/opinion/887349/columbia-falls-elementary-school-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">257</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 262 (Mont. 2005). The\n\nWyoming Supreme Court determined that Wyoming’s school funding system was\n\nunconstitutional because the distribution formula was not based upon the actual\n\ncosts of providing a basic education package to each student. Campbell Cnty. I, 907\n\nP.2d at 1277.\n\n[¶28.]       Whether South Dakota’s funding formula is based upon actual costs is\n\nunclear. The parties offered no evidence of actual costs. Cf. Campbell Cnty. I, 907\n\nP.2d at 1251 (where the plaintiffs presented a cost study as evidence). Several\n\nwitnesses, including two legislators, testified that the funding formula only provides\n\na certain amount of funding to each school district, regardless of need. An SDDOE\n\nemployee testified that she provided data to the 1995 Legislature when the formula\n\nwas being developed. The data included general fund expenditures, the old funding\n\nformula “inclusions,” and school enrollment. The witness further indicated the\n\nformula’s original 1997 PSA derived from the costs and expenditures of all the\n\nschool districts in the 1993-94 school year increased by 3.3% per year for inflation.\n\nWe are unable to surmise from the evidence if the Legislature considered the actual\n\ncost of educating a student as part of the formula. Without evidence to the\n\ncontrary, a court must presume the Legislature exercised its power to investigate\n\n\n                                         -18-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\nand determine such facts.

The Wyoming Supreme Court recognized that\n\nhistorical costs can be a starting point in State v. Campbell County School District\n\n(Campbell Cnty. II), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2524503\"><a href=\"/opinion/2524503/state-v-campbell-county-school-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">518</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Wyo. 2001). After determining that Wyoming’s\n\nfunding formula was unconstitutional in Campbell County I, the court directed the\n\nWyoming Legislature to develop a school funding system based upon costs. 907\n\nP.2d at 1279. The Wyoming Legislature retained a consulting firm for that purpose.\n\nSee Campbell Cnty. II, 19 P.3d at 537. Rather than carrying out a study of actual\n\ncosts, however, the consulting firm determined costs based upon statewide averages\n\nof past school district expenditures and “professional judgment.” Id. The Wyoming\n\nSupreme Court held that, while this was not an ideal approach, the Wyoming\n\nLegislature had to “start somewhere” and use of past statewide average\n\nexpenditures to estimate costs was appropriate. Id. at 538. The court went on to\n\nhold, however, that “regular and timely inflation adjustments” would be essential to\n\nfunding the real costs of education. Id. at 549. 27\n\n\n\n\n27.      The Wyoming court also required a thorough review of all of the components\n         of the funding system every five years to ensure funding accurately reflected\n         actual costs school districts were paying because of market or economic\n         conditions. See Campbell Cnty. II, 19 P.3d at 549.\n\n                                           -19-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\n[¶30.]       When the 1995 South Dakota Legislature developed the current\n\nformula, it based the starting PSA for 1997 upon actual 1993-94 school district\n\nexpenditures plus a 3.3% inflation factor. The Legislature then made provision in\n\nthe new formula for continuing annual inflationary adjustments to the PSA\n\naccording to the rate of inflation under the CPI or by 3%, whichever was less. 1995\n\nS.D. Sess. Laws ch. 77, § 3. See also SDCL 13-13-10.1(3)-(4). The Legislature\n\nannually appropriated the required inflationary adjustment to the PSA for each\n\nyear the formula was in place. In some years, the Legislature appropriated a higher\n\nrate of inflation than the formula required. Based on the evidence at trial, it\n\nappears that the school funding formula was originally designed in line with\n\nhistorical cost data as regularly adjusted for inflation.\n\n[¶31.]       The plaintiffs, however, find problems with the formula’s inflation\n\nprovision. They argue it is structurally defective because, in some years, annual\n\ninflation may exceed the 3% cap in the formula. See SDCL 13-13-10.1(3)-(4). In\n\nthose years, education funding would fall behind actual costs. This argument has\n\nmerit; however, the plaintiffs have not shown that this has occurred. At the time of\n\ntrial, the Legislature had increased the PSA by more than the formula’s required\n\ninflation rate in four of the years preceding trial.\n\n[¶32.]       The plaintiffs also criticize the formula’s reliance on the CPI as a\n\nmeasure of inflation. They assert that the CPI does not capture inflationary\n\nincreases related to salaries and benefits which typically constitute at least 75% of a\n\nschool district’s operating budget. The plaintiffs presented no evidence to support\n\nthis claim, except for one legislator’s general opinion voiced in a 2007 e-mail\n\n\n                                           -20-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\nmessage to Dr. Melmer without any specifics. The CPI is a commonly used measure\n\nof inflation frequently relied upon in a number of legal contexts. See, e.g.,\n\nEnchanted World Doll Museum v. Buskohl, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">398</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">149</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 150 (S.D. 1986) (CPI\n\nused as a basis for inflationary adjustments in a contract for deed); SDCL 62-4-7\n\n(increases in workers’ compensation benefits based upon the CPI); A.R.S.D.\n\n74:07:01:07 (dollar amounts for environmental financial assurance adjustable based\n\nupon the CPI). See also Campbell Cnty. II, 19 P.3d at 549 n.32 (CPI used in a school\n\nfunding case to document annual inflation rates and the erosion of purchasing\n\npower from 1995 to 2000). Absent more persuasive evidence of its inadequacy,\n\nusing the CPI as a measure of inflation does not render the funding formula\n\nunconstitutional. On this record, the plaintiffs have not shown that inflationary\n\nconditions skewed the formula or that the funding formula is unrelated to actual\n\ncosts.\n\n[¶33.]       The plaintiffs next assert that the replacement of the small school\n\nfactor with the small school adjustment in 2007 eliminated an annual inflationary\n\nincrease for smaller school districts. The small school factor and small school\n\nadjustment contemplate economies of scale; that is, smaller districts incur greater\n\ncost per student than larger districts. The small school factor utilized a schedule of\n\nmultipliers to artificially increase the enrollment of school districts with fewer than\n\n600 students. See SDCL 13-13-10.1(2). For example, school districts with fewer\n\nthan 200 students multiplied their enrollments by 1.2. SDCL 13-13-10.1(2)(a).\n\nThat product was then multiplied by the PSA, as annually adjusted for inflation, to\n\narrive at local need. SDCL 13-13-10.1(5) (Supp. 1996). The 2007 amendments\n\n\n                                          -21-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\nchanged this calculation. Enrollments are no longer artificially increased; actual\n\nenrollment figures are used instead. See SDCL 13-13-10.1(2A), -10.1(5). Smaller\n\nschool districts simply receive an additional fixed per pupil amount according to a\n\nstatutory sliding scale maximizing at $847.54 and declining as enrollments grow to\n\n600. SDCL 13-13-10.1(2C), -10.1(5). There is no provision for an annual inflation\n\nadjustment to this fixed per pupil amount. Thus, small school districts do lose the\n\nbenefit of an inflationary increase in their special adjustment every year. 28\n\n[¶34.]         Finally, the plaintiffs contend that opt outs, intended as an education\n\nenhancement mechanism, have instead become a tool of survival for many school\n\ndistricts. Since a school board’s decision to opt out can be referred (see SDCL 10-12-\n\n43), the plaintiffs claim the decision to adequately fund education defaults to a\n\nmajority vote of local taxpayers in violation of the constitution.\n\n[¶35.]         The constitution makes funding education both a state and local school\n\ndistrict responsibility. S.D. Const. art. VIII, § 15. See also Olson v. Guindon, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">63</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"901852\"><a href=\"/opinion/901852/olson-v-guindon/\"><span class=\"volume\">771</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">318</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. It requires the Legislature to make provision “by general\n\ntaxation and by authorizing the school corporations to levy such additional taxes as\n\n\n\n28.      The State contends that, despite the loss of this inflationary increase, the\n         overall package of legislative changes to the school funding formula in 2007\n         actually benefitted smaller schools. However, the testimony was equivocal on\n         this point, the defense expert conceding, “It’s - - the formula is so complex.\n         Again, it would depend on whether they had a decline in student numbers.\n         It’s not just the dollars in the formula. There’s other pieces of it too.” We\n         agree. The formula is complex. As noted by the Wyoming Supreme Court in\n         regard to that state’s school funding formula in Campbell County I, “‘[i]f lack\n         of clarity alone were sufficient to strike these statutes down, this case would\n         be less difficult.’” 907 P.2d at 1248 (quoting Roosevelt Elem.

Const. art. VIII, § 15. Ultimately, however, the constitution imposes the duty\n\non the Legislature alone to “maintain” the school system and to devise the state and\n\nlocal tax system that will “secure” it. S.D. Const. art. VIII, §§ 1, 15. Whatever\n\nsystem the Legislature devises, therefore, must be sufficient to ensure the funding\n\nof a constitutionally adequate school system in every school district. A referendum\n\nconflicts with this constitutional requirement if it permits the voters in a district to\n\nreject taxes or levies necessary to fund a constitutionally adequate school system in\n\nthe district.\n\n[¶36.]          If an opt out is necessary to fund a constitutionally adequate school\n\nsystem, it may be problematic, especially if the opt out fails at the voting booth.\n\nBased upon the testimony provided, however, nearly all of the focus districts 29\n\nattempting opt outs ultimately were able to pass them. The exception was the Bon\n\nHomme School District which, despite the rejection of two opt out attempts in 2000-\n\n2001, continued to operate until the time of trial, continued to provide the required\n\ncurriculum, and produced academic results consistent with the other focus districts.\n\n\n\n\n29.      During discovery, the parties entered into an agreement regarding the\n         selection of “focus districts” for analyzing the education system. The focus\n         district agreement was not required by the trial court. The plaintiffs initially\n         selected eleven and the State ten focus districts. Prior to trial, the plaintiffs\n         dropped five of their focus districts and the trial court ruled any evidence on\n         those districts offered by the State was irrelevant. Thus, at trial, the\n         plaintiffs offered evidence as to their six remaining focus districts: Faith;\n         Florence; Doland; Bon Homme; Willow Lake; and Rapid City. The State\n         offered evidence as to their ten focus districts: Sanborn Central; Miller; Avon;\n         Faulkton; Hamlin; Sisseton; White River; McLaughlin; Shannon County; and\n         Flandreau.\n\n                                            -23-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\nWe find this record insufficient to demonstrate a constitutional violation in the\n\nreferral of any particular opt out.\n\nEducational Results as a Factor in Constitutional Determination\n\n[¶37.]       Even if there are flaws and inadequacies in the school funding formula\n\nand opt out provision, the plaintiffs still must show the correlation between funding\n\nlevels and a constitutionally adequate education. Thus, educational results are also\n\na factor in determining constitutionality of the system. In other words, are the\n\nstudents receiving the education required by the constitution? The plaintiffs must\n\nprove that the system fails to provide South Dakota school children with an\n\neducation that gives them the opportunity to prepare for their future roles as\n\ncitizens, participants in the political system, and competitors both economically and\n\nintellectually. The plaintiffs focus on educational resources and academic results to\n\nprove their case.\n\n\n\n\n                              Educational Resources\n\n[¶38.]       The plaintiffs concentrate on the conditions of their six focus school\n\ndistricts to support their contention of inadequate resources: Faith; Doland;\n\nFlorence; Bon Homme; Willow Lake; and Rapid City.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -24-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\n[¶39.]         Testimony as to conditions in these districts mainly came from their\n\nsuperintendents. 30 Common themes emerged: insufficient funding resources\n\nprovided by the current school funding system; a resultant inability to meet ongoing\n\nfunding obligations; and a lack of realistic options for increased funding. Due to low\n\ntax bases and rising costs for items such as insurance and fuel, the superintendents\n\ntestified their districts were running out of funds and depleting their reserves.\n\nSome districts were surviving only with the benefit of successful opt outs while still\n\nothers had been unable to pass opt outs and were facing future funding uncertainty.\n\nAccording to the superintendents, consolidation was not an option for most of their\n\ndistricts because of the distances involved and student travel times.\n\n[¶40.]         The superintendents testified that over time these declining economic\n\nconditions led to waves of budget cutbacks as well as numerous programming and\n\nstaffing cuts. Advanced, college prep, gifted, foreign language, and arts programs\n\nwere common casualties. Some of the districts cut technical and agriculture\n\nprograms even in agriculture-based areas. Out of necessity, the districts were\n\nmoving toward increased reliance on distance learning over DDN, an interactive\n\neducational video network. In the superintendents’ estimation, however, the DDN\n\nprograms met with mixed results. Extracurricular programs also faced cutbacks,\n\nconsolidation with neighboring districts, or elimination altogether. Cutbacks were\n\n\n\n\n30.      Testimony in this area concerning the Rapid City Area School District was\n         provided by a former school board member rather than the district’s\n         superintendent. Nevertheless, his testimony echoed that of the\n         superintendents’ and is incorporated in this discussion.\n\n                                          -25-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\nalso leading to more resource issues in some districts such as outdated textbooks\n\nand library books.\n\n[¶41.]       The negative impact of staffing cutbacks was another common theme\n\namong the superintendents. Because of staff cuts and understaffing, remaining\n\nteachers and administrators were forced to take on larger classes and increased\n\nworkloads with less time for individual students. At the same time, they endured\n\nstagnant or frozen salaries. Some of the superintendents testified that the cutbacks\n\ncaused morale issues and teacher burnout leading to resignations and increased\n\nturnover.\n\n[¶42.]       Teacher salaries were a consistent area of concern in these focus\n\ndistricts. The superintendents repeatedly testified that low or noncompetitive\n\nsalaries caused an inability to recruit and retain qualified teachers. They perceived\n\nthis as contributing to an overall decline in qualified applicants and to\n\ninexperienced teaching staffs.\n\n[¶43.]       Some of the superintendents testified to more unique challenges.\n\nDoland, Bon Homme, and Willow Lake maintained schools serving Hutterite\n\nColonies. Those superintendents relayed their special hardships in providing\n\nadequate services to their economically disadvantaged and low English proficiency\n\nstudents.\n\n[¶44.]       Other focus districts faced special difficulties with deteriorating or\n\ninadequate facilities. Insufficient handicap access was one common point of\n\ntestimony in this area while roof and basement leaks were another. Doland’s\n\nsuperintendent raised various safety issues, and Florence’s superintendent testified\n\n\n                                         -26-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\nto a number of maintenance and space issues and a lack of air conditioning. Willow\n\nLake’s superintendent provided similar testimony including complaints of rusty\n\nwater pipes.\n\n[¶45.]         Faith’s superintendent testified to that district’s acute facility\n\nproblems. Its 1919 school building was condemned in 2004. The district provided\n\nreplacement quarters in the form of seven modular classrooms which continued to\n\nbe utilized through the time of trial. The superintendent provided extensive\n\ntestimony on the district’s financial inability to build a new school structure and as\n\nto the unique problems posed by the modular classrooms in terms of overcrowding,\n\ncleaning, maintenance, and safety as well as their responsibility for declining\n\nstudent morale.\n\n[¶46.]         The State relies on more positive evidence of conditions in the focus\n\ndistricts. The State points to the districts’ ability to maintain healthy general fund\n\nand capital outlay reserve balances despite their fiscal issues. The State also\n\nargues that opt outs were still available in some of the districts to increase funding.\n\nMoreover, some districts were not levying at the maximum limit for general funds\n\nor capital outlay funds, including some districts that had already passed opt outs.\n\nIn addition, student populations were declining in a number of districts while\n\nproperty valuations were rising, adding some boost to local tax bases.\n\n[¶47.]         The State emphasizes the potential for consolidation as a means of\n\naddressing funding issues. Through cross-examination, the State established\n\nconsolidation was a more feasible option for some districts than initially conceded\n\nby their superintendents. This was particularly true for those districts already\n\n\n                                            -27-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\nengaged in a level of inter-district cooperation in areas such as technical education,\n\nathletics, and other extracurricular activities.\n\n[¶48.]       The State also points to evidence that some of the districts could have\n\nmore advantageously used other available funding sources. For example, some\n\ndistricts were using general funds for state retirement fund contributions instead of\n\npension funds. Use of pension funds would have left more general funds available\n\nin those districts for education purposes. Other districts were not maximizing use\n\nof their capital outlay funds. Increased capital outlay funds could have assisted not\n\nonly in addressing some of the districts’ facility issues but also in purchasing\n\nequipment, computers, software, textbooks, and library books.\n\n[¶49.]       In terms of more significant facility issues, neither Faith nor Willow\n\nLake had attempted bond issues while Florence had already had a successful bond\n\nelection. The State also asserts some districts were maintaining more facilities\n\nthan necessary. In this regard, the State argues that the districts are under no\n\nlegal obligation to maintain separate Hutterite Colony schools, that Bon Homme\n\ndoes not need four separate attendance centers within its narrow geographic\n\nconfines, and that Willow Lake need not maintain a community wellness center at\n\ndistrict expense.\n\n[¶50.]       Overall, the State disputes that conditions in the plaintiffs’ focus\n\ndistricts represent conditions in the state school districts as a whole. The State\n\nrelies, in part, on testimony from Dr. Melmer. Dr. Melmer said he visited over a\n\nhundred school districts throughout the state and did not believe the facility\n\nproblems in the focus districts were indicative of most school districts. He\n\n\n                                          -28-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\nparticularly described the trailer situation in Faith as unlike anywhere in the state\n\nand pointed out that the facilities in the focus districts varied. For example, he\n\ncharacterized Rapid City’s facilities as excellent. While acknowledging teacher\n\nshortages in key areas at the high school level, Dr. Melmer did not believe the\n\noverall situation was as severe as described in the focus district testimony. In\n\nterms of resources, Dr. Melmer testified he had not seen outdated textbooks in his\n\nvisits and described classrooms as having good technology and updated materials.\n\nIn Dr. Melmer’s opinion, the focus districts’ problems did not represent South\n\nDakota school districts overall.\n\n[¶51.]         Relying upon Dr. Melmer’s testimony and its other experts, the State\n\nargues that many school districts have been able to provide a very solid and good\n\nenvironment for teaching and learning. The districts have provided adequate and\n\nin some cases, exemplary, facilities and resources, through modern technology,\n\ndistance learning, and highly qualified teachers. 31\n\n[¶52.]         The State highlights evidence that all of the 161 school districts met\n\ntheir state imposed accreditation and curriculum standards. School districts must\n\nbe accredited (SDCL 13-13-18; A.R.S.D. 24:43:02:01); and to maintain accreditation\n\nthey must meet a number of curriculum requirements (A.R.S.D. ch. 24:43:11).\n\nSchools in South Dakota meet or exceed the minimum state required curriculum\n\n\n\n31.      In terms of teaching resources, the data reflects that: only 1.6% of all core\n         content areas are not being taught by highly qualified teachers as ranked for\n         NCLB purposes (down by 9.7% since 2003); every teacher in South Dakota\n         has a bachelor’s degree and a growing percentage have master’s degrees;\n         South Dakota teachers possess an average of fifteen years of experience and\n         only 12% at the time of trial had less than three years of experience.\n\n                                          -29-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\nand, at the time of trial, all of them offered the distinguished track curriculum\n\nconsisting of ACT recommended core classes for college bound students. On a\n\nstatewide basis, South Dakota schools also offer various career and technical\n\neducation (CTE) courses such as agriculture and natural resources,\n\nbusiness management and family and consumer science.\n\n                                   Academic Results\n\n[¶53.]         In terms of academic results, the plaintiffs cite National Assessment of\n\nEducational Progress (NAEP) and DakotaSTEP test scores. Every state in the\n\ncountry administers NAEP tests in reading and math to their fourth and eighth\n\ngrade students. The plaintiffs claim the NAEP test results show that less than half\n\nof our students are proficient in the categories tested.\n\n[¶54.]         The DakotaSTEP tests are part of South Dakota’s educational\n\nassessment and accountability system under NCLB. 32 The tests measure student\n\n\n\n32.      The plaintiffs assert meeting state imposed academic standards and\n         achievement requirements such as those under NCLB is part of the standard\n         for an adequate, basic quality education under the South Dakota\n         Constitution. However, the Legislature may impose education standards\n         beyond those required by the constitution. See Breck v.

The goals are\n\ndesigned to advance students who lack basic proficiency in math and reading. In\n\nparticular, the plaintiffs emphasize the poor performance of Native American\n\nstudents. The 2008 state report card showed 52% of all Native American students\n\nin the state were not proficient in math and 38% were not proficient in reading.\n\n[¶55.]         The State argues that academic results need to be viewed on a\n\nstatewide basis rather than just in the focus districts. A statewide view offers a\n\nmore positive picture. The high statewide attendance and graduation rates\n\ncompare well at a national level. The statewide DakotaSTEP results for 2008\n\nindicate that 84% of all children were proficient or advanced in reading while 76%\n\nwere proficient or advanced in math. South Dakota students score above-average\n\non ACT tests and a high percentage of high school graduates attend some form of\n\npost-secondary education. The State minimizes the poor results of the eleventh\n\ngrade DakotaSTEP tests. Witnesses surmised that eleventh graders lacked\n\nincentive to excel on the tests because it did not impact their college eligibility or\n\nother post-high school opportunities. This pattern emerged in other states also.\n\n[¶56.]         Plaintiffs emphasize deficiencies in the funding system and\n\nquestionable achievement results. The State emphasizes positive state-wide results.\n\n_____________________________\n( . . . continued)\n               Percentage of all students not proficient in math...........................68%\n               Nat.

The standards set by the SDDOE offer guidance, but are not\n\nalone determinative. Questions also loom concerning the disparity among districts\n\nand the educational opportunities they provide. Some districts are clearly\n\nstruggling and, by their own estimation, offer less than a quality education.\n\nAlthough additional funding could remove some of the inadequacies, other factors\n\nimpact the results. Even assuming the deficiencies, the weakest link in the\n\nplaintiff’s constitutional challenge is tying the funding to the results.\n\n                   Correlation Between Funding and Results\n\n[¶57.]       Of the sixteen focus school districts the parties analyzed, Hamlin\n\nSchool District had the lowest per student expenditure in general funds in FY 2007\n\nof $5,353. Yet, 87.5% of Hamlin’s students tested proficient or advanced in reading\n\nand 82.6% tested proficient or advanced in math. Assuming a correlation between\n\nfunding and results, Hamlin should have been the poorest or one of the poorer\n\nperforming focus districts in 2007. It was not. Moreover, Hamlin achieved these\n\nresults while 42% of its students qualified for free or reduced lunches, a measure of\n\nthe economically disadvantaged student population in the district.\n\n[¶58.]       Rapid City had the next lowest spending per student in FY 2007 at\n\n$5,432 per student. While its overall math scores in 2007 were poor with only\n\n66.7% of the students testing as proficient or advanced, reading scores were\n\ncompetitive with 80.4% of the students testing in the proficient or advanced\n\ncategory. Among the Rapid City students, 31.5% qualified for free or reduced\n\nlunches.\n\n\n                                          -35-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\n[¶59.]       The third lowest spending focus district in FY 2007 was the Miller\n\nSchool District at $5,598 per student. Again, assuming a correlation between\n\nfunding and results, one would expect poor performance of Miller’s students. To the\n\ncontrary, Miller’s scores were the highest of all of the focus districts with 84% of the\n\nstudents testing as proficient or advanced in math and 89.5% testing as proficient\n\nor advanced in reading. As for its economically disadvantaged population, 32.3% of\n\nthe Miller students qualified for free or reduced lunches.\n\n[¶60.]       At the other end of the spectrum, the Shannon County School District\n\nhad the highest spending of the focus districts in FY 2007 at $12,889 per student,\n\nover twice the per student spending of the Hamlin School District. Once again,\n\nassuming a correlation between funding and results, Shannon County should have\n\nbeen one of the better performing focus districts in 2007. That was not the case.\n\nOnly 32.2% of its students tested proficient or advanced in math while only 53.5% of\n\nthem tested proficient or advanced in readingthe worst results of any of the focus\n\ndistricts. Notably, 100% of the Shannon County students qualified for free or\n\nreduced lunches.\n\n[¶61.]       Like Shannon County, McLaughlin, the second highest spending focus\n\ndistrict that year, posted test results among the worst, only 50% of the students\n\ntested proficient or advanced in math and 60% tested proficient or advanced in\n\nreading. McLaughlin School District spent $10,642 per student, nearly twice the\n\nper student spending of Hamlin School District. Also like Shannon County, 100% of\n\nthe McLaughlin students qualified for free or reduced lunches.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -36-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\n[¶62.]       At trial, Dr. Melmer provided additional examples of focus district\n\nperformances where funding amounts did not correlate with student results. White\n\nRiver was the third highest spending focus district in 2007 at $9,716 per student.\n\nYet, it had some of the poorest test results in line with Shannon County’s and\n\nMcLaughlin’s. Dr. Melmer also indicated that Hamlin and Willow Lake were “side-\n\nby-side” districts, and that Hamlin spent “well below” Willow Lake while achieving\n\ntest scores “at or above” Willow Lake’s. He identified a similar pattern between the\n\nneighboring Avon and Bon Homme School Districts where spending in Avon was\n\n“quite a bit less,” yet achieved test scores similar to Bon Homme’s.\n\n[¶63.]       The State’s experts generally downplayed a results-funding\n\ncorrelation. The experts conducted statistical analyses of test scores and school\n\ndistrict funding over several years in South Dakota. One expert found no\n\ncorrelation between a district’s total expenditures and its test scores, even after\n\nadjusting for socioeconomic circumstances affecting students such as poverty,\n\nEnglish language learner status, race, and ethnicity. The expert concluded that,\n\nwhile socioeconomic circumstances had significant negative effects on achievement,\n\nschool resources, including expenditures, had no significant effect. After analyzing\n\nthe statistical information in a variety of ways, the expert concluded:\n\n             No matter how you look at the data, no matter what techniques\n             you use, the data is very strong, it’s very consistent.\n             Achievement patterns in South Dakota are being influenced\n             heavily by students’ family background characteristics and\n             school resources that we can measure, that we have measured,\n             which includes most of the resource measures that experts have\n             looked at throughout the country. Those resources do not by\n             and large have significant effects. And the one that does have a\n             significant effect is a very small effect compared to SES [i.e.\n             socioeconomic circumstances]. So very, very hard in South\n\n                                          -37-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\n             Dakota to change achievement by changing resource levels\n             according to these studies.\n\nHe had found similar results in studies he had conducted in other states.\n\n[¶64.]       Another State expert concluded that, “across grades, across\n\nachievement areas, reading and math, across years, we don’t see any relationship\n\nbetween spending per pupil and achievement in South Dakota schools.” He claimed\n\nthis observation mirrored results of thirty of the best national studies, which found\n\nthat “attempts to improve achievement just by putting more resources into the\n\nschools and the classrooms have been ineffective . . . [and] have not led to higher\n\n[student] achievement[.]”\n\n[¶65.]       As additional support for their conclusions, these experts referred to\n\nNew Jersey and Wyoming experiences where student expenditures were\n\nsignificantly increased over time without measurable improvements in student\n\nachievement. One of the experts also referred to national spending having tripled\n\nbetween 1970 and 2000 while student performance remained level.\n\n[¶66.]       Several of the witnesses agreed that poor student achievement is\n\nimpacted by factors other than funding, such as parental issues, environmental\n\nissues, attendance issues, instructional programs, and internal resource allocation.\n\nOf particular concern was how to improve the performance of economically\n\ndisadvantaged students. Although additional funding for pre-kindergarten\n\nprograms may be one way of addressing the problemas one expert advocatedmost\n\nof the experts agreed that the achievement gap for economically disadvantaged\n\nstudents exists in every state in the nation. A complex set of socioeconomic factors\n\nand experiences contributes to the achievement gap, and no other state has been\n\n                                         -38-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\nable to eliminate the gap, including those spending nearly twice the average per\n\npupil amount that South Dakota spends.\n\n[¶67.]       The testimony and evidence raises questions about the correlation\n\nbetween the level of funding and student achievement. On this record, the\n\ncorrelation between the school funding system and poor academic results is not\n\nreadily apparent. Contrast this with the evidence before the New York Court of\n\nAppeals in Campaign for Fiscal Equity, Inc. v. State of New York, where the court\n\nfound funding for the New York City schools did not meet constitutional\n\nrequirements, but emphasized the “unique combination of circumstances” that\n\npermitted the plaintiff/appellants to prevail:\n\n             New York City schools have the most student need in the state\n             and the highest local costs yet receive some of the lowest per-\n             student funding and have some of the worst results. Plaintiffs\n             in other districts who cannot demonstrate a similar combination\n             may find tougher going in the courts.\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">801</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">326</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 350 (N.Y. 2003) (emphasis original).\n\n                                   CONCLUSION\n\n[¶68.]       We hold that the South Dakota Constitution guarantees all South\n\nDakota children a free, adequate, and quality public education which provides them\n\nwith the opportunity to prepare for their future roles as citizens, participants in the\n\npolitical system, and competitors both economically and intellectually. Here,\n\nbecause the plaintiffs are challenging the constitutionality of the state education\n\nfunding system, they have a high burden to meet. They have to overcome the\n\npresumption of constitutionality. They have to show that the state funding system\n\nis “clearly and unmistakably” unconstitutional and “there is no reasonable doubt\n\n\n                                         -39-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\nthat it violates fundamental constitutional principles.” South Dakota Ass’n, 280\n\nN.W.2d at 664-65. They have to show that the Legislature’s system of funding fails\n\nto provide children of the state with an adequate and quality education, that is, it\n\nfails to give them the opportunity to adequately prepare for their future roles as\n\ncitizens, participants in the political system, and competitors both economically and\n\nintellectually. The plaintiffs’ evidence raises serious questions about whether the\n\nstate aid formula is based on actual costs and whether local taxing procedures and\n\ncaps might have constitutional implications. The plaintiffs have also shown some\n\ngroups of students are not achieving at desired levels and that some districts\n\nstruggle to provide adequate facilities and qualified teachers. Even so, reasonable\n\ndoubt exists that the statutory funding mechanisms or level of funding are\n\nunconstitutional. We are unable to conclude that the education funding system (as\n\nit existed at the time of trial) fails to correlate to actual costs or with adequate\n\nstudent achievement to the point of declaring the system unconstitutional. We\n\naffirm the trial court. 34\n\n\n\n34.    Relying on federal justiciability analysis, the State argues this Court should\n       not address the merits of the constitutional issue in this case on the basis\n       that it poses a non-justiciable political question.

Two of the few contested issues in the education debates in the 1883\n         Constitutional Convention concerned a proposal that “all able bodied children\n         between the ages of seven and fourteen be required to attend school at least 3\n         months each year.” Another proposal was that the “Legislature shall provide\n         for uniformity of text books to be used throughout the public schools of this\n         State, and there shall be no change in text books within five years from the\n         date of adoption.” Constitutional Convention of 1883 at 356. Such specific\n         proposals were rejected while the more general terms such as “thorough”\n         survived. Id. at 356-57.\n\n40.      The proposed Constitution of 1883 was overwhelmingly passed by the voters,\n         12,336 to 6,814.

Beadle, supra, at 178, 214-15. 41 The text of the 1885 Convention\n\nwas carried forward to the 1889 Constitutional Convention 42 which became Article\n\nVIII of the South Dakota Constitution 43 in 1889. 2 South Dakota Constitutional\n\nDebates 250-60 (Huronite 1907). 44\n\n\n41.      Once again the Constitutional proposal was overwhelmingly passed by the\n         voters, 25,138 to 6,527. Kingsbury, History of Dakota Territory, supra, at\n         1751. Once again it failed to gain Congressional approval.\n\n42.      Numerous provisions of the 1885 Constitution were carried forward to the\n         1889 Constitution and ultimately became enacted as part of the South\n         Dakota Constitution. A significant concern in 1889 that cautioned against a\n         total reliance upon the 1885 text was the Congressional Enabling Act of 1889,\n         25 Statutes at Large 676, ch. 180, “which created and prescribed the powers\n         of the 1889 conventions, so often recognized as a limitation on the\n         convention’s deliberation . . . .” McDonald v.

The 1889 Constitution was hardly controversial at the ballot box. It was\n         approved by the voters 70,131 to 3,267.

The trial court’s legal research concluded that the South Dakota\n         constitutional education article is distinct from nearly every other state\n         constitution, including those found in surrounding states such as Minnesota,\n         Montana, Wyoming and North Dakota. On appeal, Plaintiffs do not\n         challenge this conclusion of law. According to Gen. Beadle, he drafted Article\n         VIII based on the “ideas, suggestions and work” of the members of the\n         Committee on Education. Memoirs of Gen. Beadle, supra, at 214. He had\n                                                                      (continued . . .)\n                                            -48-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\n[¶82.]       When reviewing the journals of the three constitutional conventions,\n\nthe only source of significant debate in regards to education was the minimum price\n\nset for sale of public school lands. Looking both inside and outside the\n\nconstitutional halls at contemporary histories such as Kingsbury and the Gen.\n\nBeadle Memoirs, the issue of education was not a clash of the titans; it was rather a\n\nconsensus that public education should be free to all, at taxpayer expense, as it had\n\nbeen since 1861.

The text of Article VIII is the result of what he considered to be the\n          best for the proposed State of South Dakota. Id.

A review of the 1890 Session Laws indicates only two small enactments\n\ndealing with education; one requiring the teaching of the effect of alcohol on the\n\nhuman system and a second abolishing the State Board of Education. 1890 S.D.\n\nSess. Laws chs. 82 & 83. 45 Instead, the 1890 Legislature dealt with the subject of\n\neducation as with others by enacting a statute which carried over all Territorial\n\nLaws to the State laws unless repealed or amended. 1890 S.D. Sess. Laws 254, ch.\n\n105. This theme was reinforced by this Court in the early case In re State Census, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">540</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">129</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1895). Therein we noted that:\n\n               There appear to be three classes of provisions in the\n               [C]onstitution. The first class embraces constitutional\n               provisions negative and prohibitory in their character, and are\n               self-executing. All the laws, therefore, in force when the\n               constitution was adopted, in conflict with these provisions, were\n               necessarily abrogated, and laws subsequently enacted in conflict\n               therewith would necessarily be void, in so far as they conflict\n               with such provisions.\n\nId. at 130. Yet, there is no suggestion that the Territorial Laws concerning\n\neducation somehow ran afoul of Article VIII; instead they were carried forward.\n\n\n\n\n45.      Five enactments concerning the sale and lease of School and Public Lands\n         were also enacted which had nothing to do with the actual education of\n         students. See 1890 S.D. Sess. Laws chs. 136, 137, 138, 139 & 140.\n\n                                          -50-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\n[¶84.]         This view of the history of our constitutional period has stood the test\n\nof time. Jon Lauck’s recent study of the pre-constitutional period of the 1880’s\n\nunearths no major battles over the educational provision or, after statehood, any\n\nclaims of failure to comply with Article VIII. See Jon Lauck, Prairie Republic – The\n\nPolitical Culture of the Dakota Territory 1879-1889 (University of Oklahoma Press\n\n2010).\n\n[¶85.]         This history indicates that Article VIII of the South Dakota\n\nConstitution did not chart a new path previously unknown in this jurisdiction. The\n\nyear 1889 did not usher in a revolution in education. Rather, it was a continuum of\n\nthe past with similar goals of improvement. While the drafters were studious of\n\nconstitutions adopted in other states, all three proposed constitutions were “home-\n\ngrown” documents.\n\n[¶86.]         Many of those who were in leadership positions at the Constitutional\n\nConventions and spoke frequently on important subjects were to become the\n\ngovernors, legislators and judges of the new State of South Dakota.

Thus, the new state\n\nofficials were familiar with the text of Article VIII. It seems inconceivable that\n\ndelegates to the Constitutional Convention of 1889 would subsequently take their\n\nseats in the Governor’s Chairs and the Legislatures of South Dakota and promptly\n\nignore the oath they had taken to support the Constitution of the State of South\n\nDakota which they had just authored months before.46 Rather it points to a belief\n\n\n\n46.      An example of the pre- and post-statehood continuity in education appears in\n         Capital Bank of St. Paul v.

In 1905, in the Fourth Annual Review of Progress of South Dakota,\n\nthe South Dakota Historical Society declared, “All the state educational\n\ninstitutions, from the common schools to the university, as well as the private\n\nschools and colleges, are in a flourishing condition.” Fourth Annual Review of the\n\nProgress of South Dakota for 1905, 3 South Dakota Historical Collections 33 (1906).\n\nMoreover, Gen. Beadle’s 1906 Memoirs, frequently cited by Plaintiffs, evidence no\n\nthought that the State since 1889 was out of compliance with its constitutional\n\neducational obligations. Instead, a jubilant Gen. Beadle declared, “[n]ever before in\n\nits history has the [S]tate of South Dakota been so prosperous as at the present\n\ntime.” Memoirs of Gen. Beadle, supra, at 239.\n\n[¶88.]         There are no cases from this Court between 1889 to the present\n\nconcerning claims such as are now before us, that being the issue of the State’s\n\nfailure to comply with funding mandates of Article VIII. 47 However, this Court in\n\n\n_____________________________\n( . . . continued)\n          (1889), where the Dakota Territorial Supreme Court held school boards\n          possess only such powers as were expressly conferred on them by the\n          Territorial Legislature and other powers must necessarily be implied to have\n          been given them in order to carry out the purposes of their organization and\n          are incidental to the exercise of the powers expressly granted to it or\n          necessarily implied.

Standards of education\n             have advanced, and methods of teaching have changed. But we\n             think it is elementary that the people through their Legislature\n             and the Constitution have a right to control and prescribe the\n             limits to which they will go in supplying education to the\n             children and youth of the state at public expense. Neither\n             educators nor administrative boards can expend public funds for\n             education, unless the education for which it is expended is\n             authorized by law.\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">554</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">234</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 47 (1931).\n\n[¶93.]              While Plaintiffs mount an impressive public policy argument\n\nbased on equitable principles, this is not an equitable issue. Rather, it is an issue of\n\nconstruction of our Constitution which alone controls the resolution of this case.\n\nThere certainly is room in the drafting of Article VIII for a difference of legal\n\nopinions. However, in this Court’s sole early review of Article VIII, we stated that a\n\nstatute will be declared unconstitutional in violation of Article VIII only when we\n\nare satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that it conflicts with that article.

Today the Court once\n\nagain properly applies that standard of review. Thus, the words of this Court\n\nwritten shortly after statehood are appropriate:\n\n               The object to be sought is the thought of the constitution makers\n               in the use of this expression . . . . In case of doubt between\n               different constructions claimed for a constitutional or statutory\n               provision, or the meaning of a term, it is always allowable to\n               inquire what results would legitimately follow either, with a\n               view of ascertaining, if possible, whether such consequences\n               were contemplated or intended.\n\nState ex rel.

In McDonald, the\n         Court held that “the likelihood of misapprehension” by Kellam’s\n         constitutional analysis “is too remote to be seriously entertained.” 246\n         N.W.2d at 97.\n\n                                           -56-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\nunder a different standard than was done by the trial court. Thus, Article VIII sets\n\na constitutional floor for support of education from which the Legislature, not this\n\nCourt, can ascend.\n\n                                THE FACTUAL ISSUE 50\n\n[¶95.]          Plaintiffs offered evidence from six school districts called “focus\n\ndistricts,” which include the Faith, Doland, Florence, Bon Homme, Willow Lake and\n\nRapid City districts, as proof of state-wide deficiencies in funding compliance with\n\nArticle VIII.\n\n[¶96.]          Dr. Rick Melmer was formerly the South Dakota Secretary of\n\nEducation. While in that position, he testified to visiting over 100 of the 161 school\n\ndistricts in South Dakota. He concluded that the conditions claimed by Plaintiffs to\n\nexist in the six focus districts are not representative of the situation around South\n\nDakota. 51 Even if this foundational hurdle is cleared by Plaintiffs, they still have to\n\ncontend with the trial court’s extensive findings of fact. The trial court entered 433\n\ndetailed findings of fact concerning the six focus districts which cover 83 pages. In\n\nlarge part, the trial court concluded the generally negative testimony by\n\nsuperintendents and others from the focus districts was not as probative as other\n\nmore positive testimony and evidence presented. Its findings are more in\n\n\n\n50.      We base our decision on the factual record presented to the trial court and\n         not on any subsequent enactments by the Legislature.\n\n51.      Perhaps for that reason, the trial court also entered extensive findings of fact\n         on the following school districts: Sanborn Central, Miller, Avon, Faulkton\n         Area, Hamlin, Sisseton, White River, McLaughlin, Shannon County, and\n         Flandreau. The trial court found that each of these school districts was\n         providing a constitutionally adequate education.\n\n                                            -57-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\nconformity with Britton-Hecla’s Superintendent Don Kirkegaard, also a member of\n\nthe State Board of Education, who testified that, in his opinion, not a single district\n\nin the state lacked sufficient resources to prepare its students to find meaningful\n\nemployment, compete effectively in the economy, have the opportunity for higher\n\neducation, and function as capable voters and jurors. Suffice it to say that the trial\n\ncourt’s appraisal of those districts was substantially more positive than that of\n\nPlaintiffs’ witnesses. This led to a finding by the trial court that each of the focus\n\ndistricts was providing a constitutionally adequate education.\n\n[¶97.]       The Court today enters into a comparison of the factual evidence\n\nsubmitted to the trial court by the Plaintiffs and the State. The trial court in large\n\npart found the factual presentation of the State to be the most probative and\n\nentered findings of fact accordingly. Although this Court finds no “clear error” in\n\nthe trial court’s findings on this subject, the correct analysis should be whether\n\nthose findings are clearly erroneous. Action Carrier, Inc. v.

There were 194 students enrolled in the Faith\n\nSchool District during the 2008-2009 school year and the superintendent\n\nanticipated enrollment would continue to be stable or decline slightly. The total\n\nper-student expenditure for the school year ending in 2007 was $7,688. In 2008,\n\n\n                                          -58-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\nFaith received money under the state-funded sparsity adjustment for the third\n\nstraight fiscal year. The amount was $90,000 to $100,000. The trial court found\n\nclasses in Faith were held in a combination of modular classrooms and a\n\ngymnasium in its former school building.\n\n[¶99.] Plaintiffs rely on testimony from the superintendent of the Faith School\n\nDistrict who testified to a lack of sufficient general funds leading to cuts in staff,\n\nprograms, and services. The superintendent testified to using opt-outs and\n\nindicated consolidation was not an option. He further expressed reservations over\n\nthe effectiveness of televised instruction and concerns over limited course offerings.\n\nFinally, the superintendent expressed concern of the expansion of the duties of\n\nadministrative staff beyond their capabilities.\n\n[¶100.]      With regard to the superintendent’s testimony over funding cuts, the\n\nnecessity of opt-outs, and the impracticability of consolidation, the trial court found\n\nopt-outs were part of the funding system and that Dupree was 23 miles away and\n\nalready shared programs with Faith, making consolidation an option. It also found\n\nthe school had “state of the art technology,” offered a number of classes through\n\ninteractive television, and that the superintendent himself stressed the student\n\nbody’s “21st century skills” in a grant application. Although the superintendent\n\nshowed concern that students had failed language courses taken through televised\n\ninstruction, he conceded students could fail a live class as well and did not testify to\n\noverall failure rates.\n\n[¶101.]       The trial court found that despite the superintendent’s concerns over\n\nlimited course offerings, Faith offered all courses necessary for students to qualify\n\n\n                                           -59-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\nfor Opportunity and Regent Scholarships and that Faith actually had two Regent\n\nScholars in 2008. It also offered advanced placement courses through the internet.\n\nWith regard to technical course offerings, the trial court found the school district\n\noffered a number of rotating courses through an area services agency in subjects as\n\ndiverse as Building Trades and Health Occupations.\n\n[¶102.]      As to the superintendent’s contentions concerning expansion of the\n\nduties of administrative staff, the trial court found Faith had 197 students in its\n\nentire K-12 program. This works out to an average class size of 15 students. To\n\nadminister this system, the superintendent was assisted by an elementary principal\n\nand a guidance director and also received management support services from an\n\neducational services agency. The trial court found that the school district accepted\n\na large number of students through open enrollment, indicating that the school and\n\nits staff were not so overburdened that they could not handle the number of\n\nstudents.\n\n[¶103.]      Despite the concerns over funding issues raised by its superintendent,\n\nthe trial court found that, among other things, the Faith School District provided a\n\nconstitutionally adequate education. Plaintiffs have not shown that these findings\n\nare clearly erroneous.\n\n                           2)     Doland School District\n\n[¶104.]      The Doland School District is located in northeast South Dakota,\n\nprimarily in Spink County. The school district had 145 students enrolled in the\n\n2008-2009 school year. Its total per student expenditure for the school year ending\n\nin 2007 was $9,022. For the 2006-2007 school year, the trial court found Doland\n\n\n                                         -60-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\nhad total general fund expenditures of $1,273,364. That same year, Doland\n\nmaintained a general fund reserve balance of $644,523, approximately 50% of its\n\nannual general fund.\n\n[¶105.]      Plaintiffs rely on testimony from the superintendent of the Doland\n\nSchool District regarding struggles to meet financial obligations, the necessity of\n\nopt-outs, and the impracticability of consolidation. In terms of educational\n\nopportunity, the superintendent testified to understaffing and the necessity of\n\ncombining elementary classes. Other areas of concern for the superintendent were\n\nout-of-date textbooks, cuts in agricultural and technical courses, and understaffing\n\nin its two Hutterite colony schools.\n\n[¶106.]      Although the Doland superintendent expressed concerns over financial\n\nstruggles, he also testified Doland was not currently facing financial difficulties.\n\nDoland had opted out of the limitation on the general fund levy and the trial court\n\nfound this gave it the ability to levy for an additional $227,000 every year in\n\naddition to state aid formula money. Accordingly, the court found Doland was able\n\nto serve its student population in a constitutionally sufficient manner. The court\n\nalso found the distances between surrounding districts did not pose a barrier to\n\nconsolidation with three districts within 20 miles of Doland.\n\n[¶107.]      Regarding understaffing and combining elementary classes, the trial\n\ncourt found Doland had some classes as small as “five or so” students per grade.\n\nThus, the court found “nothing improper” about combining classes. The\n\nsuperintendent’s contentions concerning out-of-date textbooks were addressed by\n\n\n\n\n                                          -61-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\nthe general fund reserve balance and the fact the district could levy for additional\n\ncapital outlay funds for books.\n\n[¶108.]      The trial court attributed the lack of agriculture classes to evidence of\n\ndeclining student involvement in those courses over several years. As for technical\n\ncourses, the court found the district offered Family and Consumer Science, Personal\n\nFinance, Computer Training, and Occupation Prep.\n\n[¶109.]      Based upon its consideration of the foregoing funding issues, the trial\n\ncourt found Doland was not suffering from financial difficulties and that predictions\n\nof future deficiencies were too premature for consideration. It concluded that\n\nDoland was providing a constitutionally adequate education. Plaintiffs have not\n\nshown that these findings are clearly erroneous.\n\n                          3)      Florence School District\n\n[¶110.]      The Florence School District is located in northeast South Dakota,\n\nprimarily in Codington County. The trial court found the Florence School District\n\nhad 241 students enrolled for the 2007-2008 school year. For the school year ending\n\nin 2007, its total per-student expenditure was $7,229.\n\n[¶111.]      Plaintiffs reference testimony from the Florence superintendent\n\nconcerning funding difficulties, deficit spending, and lack of sufficient course\n\nofferings, extracurricular activities and administrative personnel. The\n\nsuperintendent testified he did not believe Florence was providing an adequate\n\neducational opportunity and Plaintiffs buttress that testimony on appeal with\n\nreferences to testimony to the same effect from two state board of education\n\nmembers and a state legislator.\n\n\n                                          -62-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\n[¶112.]       As for funding difficulties, the trial court found Florence had a general\n\nfund balance of over $300,000 at the time of trial and had not opted out in its tax\n\nlevies. Thus, an opt-out remained available to it. The court also held consolidation\n\nwas an option for Florence with two other school districts lying within\n\napproximately 20 miles. In that regard, the court noted Florence was already\n\ncooperating with nearby school districts in certain course offerings and sporting\n\nactivities.\n\n[¶113.]       With reference to course offerings, the trial court found Florence\n\nprovided all math and science classes required to meet distinguished track\n\ncurriculum requirements. Although concerns were expressed with televised class\n\nofferings, the acceptability of televised instruction did not equate with deficient\n\ninstruction. Specific concerns with televised physics classes were addressed by\n\nemployment of an on-site teacher who rotated with another school. As for technical\n\ncourses, Florence offered agriculture classes at its own school and also provided\n\naccess to ten different classes at a multi-district facility in nearby Watertown. The\n\nFlorence superintendent admitted the multi-district classes provided an excellent\n\nopportunity for juniors and seniors. Deficiencies in fine arts offerings appeared to\n\nbe more attributable to televised scheduling issues than lack of resources.\n\n[¶114.]       The trial court found there were 241 students with less than 20\n\nstudents per class in the elementary school and high school classes of 12 to 25\n\nstudents per grade. The superintendent was assisted in his administration of this\n\nsystem by two lead elementary teachers carrying out elementary principal duties.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -63-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\n[¶115.]      Plaintiffs also reference the testimony of two state board of education\n\nmembers and a legislator who buttressed the superintendent’s criticisms of the\n\nFlorence School District during pretrial depositions. However, during trial they\n\nequivocated in their evaluations after being presented with additional information\n\nconcerning the conditions and course offerings at the school.\n\n[¶116.]      The trial court found that, despite the above funding issues, the\n\nFlorence School District continued to maintain a “healthy” fund balance and\n\nprovided a constitutionally adequate education. Plaintiffs have not shown that\n\nthese findings are clearly erroneous.\n\n                         4)    Bon Homme School District\n\n[¶117.]      The Bon Homme School District is located in southeast South Dakota\n\nin Bon Homme County. The trial court found there were approximately 550\n\nstudents enrolled in the Bon Homme School District for the 2008-2009 school year.\n\nThe per-student expenditure for the school year ending in 2007 was $7,483.\n\n[¶118.]      Plaintiffs challenge conditions in the Bon Homme School District,\n\npointing to the superintendent’s concerns over funding difficulties and rejected opt-\n\nouts. He also testified that consolidation was not an option. The superintendent\n\nindicated Bon Homme had instituted a four-day school week and was experiencing\n\nclassroom overcrowding with teachers handling as many as 145 students in core\n\nclasses. As a result, he expressed concerns that teachers were “burning out” and\n\nmight leave. Plaintiffs sought to buttress the superintendent’s testimony with\n\ntestimony from a state legislator that the district did not have sufficient funds to\n\nmeet its expenditures.\n\n\n                                         -64-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\n[¶119.]      As for funding difficulties, the trial court found the Bon Homme\n\ndistrict received impact aid funds for its needs and made appropriate use of those\n\nfunds. It further found the district was operating four elementary schools within a\n\n15-mile radius of Tyndall and that three of those schools had very few students.\n\nOne was a school in a Hutterite colony with only three to ten students in each\n\ngrade. The other two small schools averaged only seven to eleven students per\n\ngrade. Thus, as testified to by Dr. Melmer, the trial court found the school district\n\nwas maintaining too many facilities for the size of its enrollment. It further found\n\nthat some intra-district consolidation would save transportation, maintenance, and\n\nfuel costs, particularly if one or more of the elementary schools were closed. In\n\naddition, the court found two other school districts within a 20-mile radius of\n\nTyndall provided additional consolidation options.\n\n[¶120.]      With regard to the four-day school week, the superintendent testified\n\nfunding was not the main reason for the change, though it did save some money.\n\nClassroom overcrowding occurred in a single geometry class and involved an excess\n\nof five or fewer students. The issue did not occur again in a subsequent school year\n\nand overall student enrollment was declining. The trial court found no reason to\n\nexpect overcrowding would occur again and that the issue was moot. The figure of\n\n145 students in core classes was a reference to the total number of students per\n\nteacher in some core areas, not the number of students in one class. The overall\n\nratio of students to staff was approximately 13-to-1 in 2007. Despite concerns over\n\nteachers leaving, the trial court found the average number of years of teaching\n\n\n\n\n                                         -65-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\nexperience in the district was 14.2 with over 30% of the teachers holding advanced\n\ndegrees.\n\n[¶121.]      A legislator’s testimony claimed as supporting the superintendent’s\n\nconcerns was equivocal as to overall conditions in the Bon Homme School District.\n\nWhile the legislator shared some of the superintendent’s concerns, the trial court\n\nfound that he also testified the school district was providing an excellent education.\n\nAlthough the legislator testified the school district was under-funded, he further\n\ntestified it was under-funded in the sense of overspending its resources, not that it\n\ndid not have sufficient resources. In that regard, the legislator agreed it was not\n\nadvisable for the school district to operate four attendance centers.\n\n[¶122.]      Based upon its review of the financial circumstances in the Bon\n\nHomme School District, the trial court found the district’s claims of dire conditions\n\nand that it would soon be “broke” were premature and that it was providing a\n\nconstitutionally adequate education. Plaintiffs have not shown that these findings\n\nare clearly erroneous.\n\n                         5)   Willow Lake School District\n\n[¶123.]      The Willow Lake School District is located in northeast South Dakota\n\nin Clark County. The trial court found the student body in Willow Lake was small\n\nand steadily decreasing. At the time of trial, there were 195 students, which was\n\ndown from 212 students five years earlier. The school district’s total per-student\n\nexpenditure for the school year ending in 2007 was $9,066.\n\n[¶124.]      Plaintiffs rely on testimony from the superintendent for the Willow\n\nLake School District. The superintendent testified that the district was not\n\n\n                                         -66-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\nprovided with sufficient funding resources and that consolidation was not an option.\n\nHe testified about concerns over his workload and a lack of vacation time, budget\n\ncuts and salary freezes, the necessity of opt-outs, deficiencies in course offerings,\n\nand outdated textbooks.\n\n[¶125.]       The trial court found the school district was $124,000 short in its\n\ngeneral fund. However, it also found that, while the district had opted out so that it\n\ncould levy up to $200,000 per year in general funds, it was actually levying only\n\n$100,000 to $125,000. The court found a complete levy would “go a long way”\n\ntoward overcoming the shortage. The court also found three schools in a 26-mile\n\nradius of Willow Lake that already offered sports on a cooperative basis with the\n\nschool district and would provide it with consolidation options.\n\n[¶126.]       The trial court addressed the superintendent’s claims concerning his\n\nworkload, finding that there were 195 students in the entire school district, i.e., an\n\naverage of 15 students per class, that the superintendent was assisted by a “capable\n\nhigh school principal,” and that he also received administrative assistance from an\n\neducational services agency. The superintendent also testified he was assisted by a\n\nsecretary and a business manager. Regarding budget cuts and salary freezes, the\n\ntrial court found the district lacked funds and made cuts before passing its opt-out\n\nand that it had the ability to pass an opt-out sooner and did not do so. It further\n\nfound the superintendent stated at trial that teacher salaries were competitive for a\n\nschool of its size.\n\n[¶127.]       In the area of course offerings, the trial court found that Willow Lake\n\nSchool District provided all classes the students needed to compete for Opportunity\n\n\n                                          -67-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\nand Regent Scholarships. The court found that the school district met the\n\nminimum state curriculum standards for math and also offered the requisite units\n\nto meet the distinguished criteria for the Opportunity Scholarship. The court also\n\nfound the school district offered a number of technical courses in family and\n\nconsumer science and several agriculture courses.\n\n[¶128.]      Finally, as to out-of-date textbooks, the trial court found textbooks\n\ncould be purchased with capital outlay or general funds and that the school district\n\nhad not taken advantage of its ability to raise funds to take care of this issue.\n\nBased upon testimony from Dr. Melmer, it further found Willow Lake’s out-of-date\n\ntextbooks were not representative of conditions around the state.\n\n[¶129.]      Despite the superintendent’s funding issues regarding the Willow Lake\n\nSchool District, the trial court found that the district was providing a\n\nconstitutionally adequate education. Plaintiffs have not shown that these findings\n\nare clearly erroneous.\n\n                      6)     Rapid City Area School District\n\n[¶130.]      The Rapid City Area School District (Rapid City) is located in\n\nsouthwest South Dakota in Pennington County. It is the second largest school\n\ndistrict in the state. The trial court found that Rapid City operated 15 elementary\n\nschools, five middle schools, two traditional high schools, and two alternative high\n\nschools. Total enrollment was 13,115 for the 2007-2008 school year. The total per-\n\nstudent expenditure for the school year ending in 2007 was $6,554.\n\n[¶131.]      No authorized representative of Rapid City testified at trial. Instead,\n\nPlaintiffs rely on testimony from a former school board member. Plaintiffs\n\n\n                                          -68-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\nattempted to qualify him as an expert at trial, but the trial court declined to\n\nrecognize him as such because he did not have a degree in education\n\nadministration, was not a certified teacher or administrator, and admitted he was\n\nnot an expert in education administration. Thus, the trial court declined to consider\n\nthe former board member’s testimony regarding the requirements of No Child Left\n\nBehind and the “achievement gap” in Rapid City as expert testimony. Instead, the\n\ntrial court relied upon the expert testimony of defense expert Dr. John Murphy. Dr.\n\nMurphy had reviewed Rapid City, was favorably impressed, and opined that it was\n\nproviding the opportunity for an adequate education.\n\n[¶132.]      The former board member complained of insufficient resources,\n\ndepleted budget reserves, numerous staff cuts, and the removal of vocational\n\nofferings to a local technical college. The board member made specific complaints\n\nabout cuts in the number of guidance counselors, overcrowding, and the loss of a\n\nvirtual high school program.\n\n[¶133.]      Rapid City had an excess general fund balance each year from 2001 to\n\n2008 ranging from 9.5% to 15%. At the end of fiscal year 2008, the general fund\n\nbalance was equal to 10.5% of the total Rapid City general fund budget. The former\n\nboard member testified that if budgeted sums were fully expended as contemplated\n\nby the 2008-2009 preliminary budget, Rapid City would have a general fund excess\n\nfund balance at the end of the 2008-2009 school year in the amount of $4,000,000, or\n\n5% of the total budget.\n\n[¶134.]      Although Rapid City had made a number of budget and staff cuts, the\n\ntrial court also found that from 1998 to 2004, the school district experienced a\n\n\n                                         -69-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\ndecline of about 1,000 students. The counseling staff was reduced, but the trial\n\ncourt found the state does not require a specific ratio of guidance counselors to\n\nstudents. Foreign language programs were eliminated from the middle schools, but\n\nno data was provided as to how elimination of the programs might affect later\n\nstudent performance. There was also conflicting testimony regarding the staff cuts.\n\nAlthough the former board member testified to a reduction in certified staff, Rapid\n\nCity reports to the State indicated it had hired over 60 new employees in the\n\nprevious three years and that staff had not declined. The student-to-staff ratio was\n\n16-to-1 in the 2006-2007 school year.\n\n[¶135.]      Despite program cuts, the trial court found that Rapid City had\n\nextensive course offerings reflected in a 78-page manual listing high school classes\n\nfor the 2008-2009 school year. Rapid City provided the curriculum required by the\n\nState Department of Education and provided all course requirements for\n\nOpportunity and Regent Scholarships. Contrary to the former board member’s\n\ntestimony, the trial court found evidence that Rapid City offered a comprehensive\n\nrange of courses in technical areas, including subjects such as marketing and\n\nengineering principles. Vocational offerings at a local technical college were a dual\n\ncredit opportunity in addition to those courses offered at the high schools.\n\n[¶136.]      As with the previous focus districts, the trial court found that despite\n\nits funding issues, Rapid City was providing a constitutionally adequate education.\n\nIt further found that many of the former board member’s predictions of financial\n\ndifficulties predicated upon estimates of future spending were “premature.”\n\nPlaintiffs have not shown that these findings are clearly erroneous.\n\n\n                                         -70-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\n                                       CONCLUSION\n\n[¶137.]      When one analyzes the legal issue of the meaning of Article VIII and\n\nits history, they do not support the heightened legal interpretations advocated by\n\nPlaintiffs. Whether or not one accepts the focus districts as representative of the\n\nstate’s school districts, the trial court’s findings of fact are not clearly erroneous and\n\nconclusions of law are not in error. As Plaintiffs fail on both the legal and factual\n\nissues, there is no necessity to go further into any causation issues.\n\n[¶138.]      Article VIII was drawn from the public policy and language of 1889. It\n\nmay seem today to some to be archaic and incapable of serving the state’s current\n\neducational needs and public policy goals. However, this Court is “not concerned\n\nwith the wisdom or expediency or the need” for this constitutional provision, but\n\nonly whether it limits the power of the Legislature and, if so, in what manner.\n\nPoppen, 520 N.W.2d at 242 (citing Queenside Hills Realty Co., Inc. v.

While the meaning of words such\n\nas “a general and uniform system of public schools,” “adopt all suitable means to\n\nsecure the people the advantages and opportunities of education” and a “thorough\n\nand efficient system of schools,” may be reviewed in the context of the times as this\n\nCourt did in Dailey, the words themselves do not change.

They set the standard in 1889 and still do today. As Justice Hugo\n\nBlack once observed concerning the issue of constitutional interpretation:\n\n             I realize that many good and able [persons] have eloquently\n             spoken and written, sometimes in rhapsodical strains, about the\n             duty of this Court to keep the Constitution in tune with the\n             times. The idea is that the Constitution must be changed from\n             time to time and that this Court is charged with a duty to make\n             those changes. For myself, I must with all deference reject that\n\n                                           -71-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\n             philosophy. The Constitution makers knew the need for change\n             and provided for it. Amendments suggested by the people’s\n             elected representatives can be submitted to the people or their\n             selected agents for ratification. That method of change was good\n             for our Fathers, and being some-what old-fashioned I must add\n             it is good enough for me.\n\nGriswold v.

The United States\n\nSupreme Court correctly set forth the limited function of courts in conducting a\n\nlegal review of the acts of a legislative body and the facts surrounding the adoption\n\nof a constitutional or legislative standard. See, e.g., DeCoteau v. Dist. Cnty. Ct. for\n\nthe 10th Jud. Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109206\"><a href=\"/opinion/109206/decoteau-v-district-county-court-for-tenth-judicial-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">420</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">425</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 449, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109206\"><a href=\"/opinion/109206/decoteau-v-district-county-court-for-tenth-judicial-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">300</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1975).\n\nIn light of a claim of “calamitous results” which the parties claimed could flow from\n\nthe Court’s decision, the Court observed that “these competing pleas are not for us\n\nto adjudge, for our task here is a narrow one. . . . Some might wish [our\n\nconstitutional drafters] had spoken differently, but we cannot remake history.” Id.\n\n[¶140.]      The Court holds today that Plaintiffs have failed to establish beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt a constitutional violation of Article VIII. I agree. That being the\n\ncase, our Constitution mandates that these kinds of disputed issues are to be\n\nbrought before the people’s popularly elected Legislature. That body, and not this\n\nCourt, is the appropriate forum for resolution of such issues. In so concluding,\n\nhowever, I echo the views of the United States Supreme Court in San Antonio\n\n\n\n\n                                          -72-\n\f#25330, #25333\n\nIndependent School District:\n\n             Nothing this Court holds today in any way detracts from our\n             historic dedication to public education. We are in complete\n             agreement that ‘the grave significance of education both to the\n             individual and to our society’ cannot be doubted.\n\n411 U.S. at 30, 93 S. Ct. at 1295.\n\n[¶141.]      For the above reasons, I concur in result.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -73-\n\f</pre>",
