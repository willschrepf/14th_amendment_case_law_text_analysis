She contends that the order should be set aside on grounds\n\n\n\n        1\n         Retired Fourteenth Court of Appeals Justice Don W ittig assigned to this Court by the Chief Justice\nof the Suprem e Court of Texas pursuant to the governm ent code. See Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 74.003\n(Vernon 2005).\n\fincluding lack of notice, lack of statutory authority, no evidence or insufficient evidence,\n\nunjust sanctions, and improper conduct by appellee, Michael Hummell. Both parties are\n\ncurrently licensed attorneys in this state, and variously accuse each other of all manner of\n\nnon-professional conduct. We reverse and remand.\n\n                                     1. Standard of Review\n\n       The imposition of an available sanction is left to the sound discretion of the trial court.\n\nLow v. Henry, 221 S.W.3d 609, 614 (Tex. 2007); Koslow’s v. Mackie, 796 S.W.2d 700, 704\n\n(Tex. 1990). An appellate court will set aside the decision only on a showing of a clear\n\nabuse of discretion. Id. The test for abuse of discretion is whether the trial court acted\n\nwithout reference to any guiding rules and principles, or equivalently, whether under all the\n\ncircumstances of the particular case, the trial court's action was arbitrary or unreasonable.\n\nDowner v. Aquamarine Operators, Inc., 701 S.W.2d 238, 241-42 (Tex. 1985).                    The\n\ncircumstances of the case include the reasons offered, and proved, or established as a\n\nmatter of law on the record. Koslow’s, 796 S.W.2d at 704. It is an abuse of discretion for\n\nthe trial court to impose sanctions when the defaulting party has inadequate notice or no\n\nnotice of the sanctions hearing. Plano Savings & Loan Ass'n v. Slavin, 721 S.W.2d 282,\n\n284 (Tex. 1986). Generally, courts should presume that pleadings and other papers are\n\nfiled in good faith. GTE Commc’n Sys. Corp. v. Tanner, 856 S.W.2d 725, 730 (Tex. 1993).\n\nThe party seeking sanctions bears the burden of overcoming this presumption of good faith.\n\nId. at 731.\n\n       Section 10.001 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code provides that a\n\nperson signing a motion or pleading certifies that “to the signatory's best knowledge,\n\n\n\n                                                2\n\finformation, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry”: (1) the motion or pleading is not\n\npresented for an improper purpose; (2) each legal contention is warranted; (3) each factual\n\ncontention is likely to have evidentiary support; and (4) each denial of a factual contention\n\nis warranted. TEX . CIV. PRAC . & REM . CODE ANN . § 10.001 (Vernon 2002). If there has been\n\na violation of section 10.001, then “[a] party may make a motion for sanctions,” or the court\n\non its own initiative may issue a show cause order. Id. § 10.002. Chapter 10 requires the\n\ncourt to provide a party subject to sanctions with notice and a reasonable opportunity to\n\nrespond to the allegations. Id. § 10.003. “A court that determines that a person has signed\n\na pleading or motion in violation of Section 10.001 may impose a sanction on the person,\n\na party represented by the person, or both.” Id. § 10.004(a). “The sanction must be limited\n\nto what is sufficient to deter repetition of the conduct or comparable conduct by others\n\nsimilarly situated.” Id. § 10.004(b). The sanction may include: “(1) a directive to the violator\n\nto perform, or refrain from performing, an act; (2) an order to pay a penalty into court; and\n\n(3) an order to pay to the other party the amount of the reasonable expenses incurred by\n\nthe other party because of the filing of the pleading or motion, including reasonable\n\nattorney's fees.” Id. § 10.004(c). If the court determines that section 10.001 has been\n\nviolated and that a sanction should be imposed, then the “court shall describe in an order\n\nimposing a sanction under this chapter the conduct the court has determined violated\n\nSection 10.001 and explain the basis for the sanction imposed.” Id. § 10.005.\n\n       Chapter 10 of the Texas Civil Practices and Remedies Code provides two ways to\n\ninitiate sanctions proceedings concerning frivolous pleadings and motions: (1) a\n\nparty-initiated motion, as authorized by section 10.002(a), describing specific conduct in\n\n\n\n                                               3\n\fviolation of section 10.001, or (2) a court-initiated motion with a show cause order from the\n\ncourt, as authorized by section 10.002(b). Here, the trial court never issued a show cause\n\norder.\n\n         Rule 13 provides for sanctions if a party files a pleading that is “groundless and\n\nbrought in bad faith or groundless and brought for the purpose of harassment.” TEX . R. CIV.\n\nP. 13. “Groundless” means no basis in law or fact and not warranted by a good faith\n\nargument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law. Id. Rule 13 requires\n\nthe trial court to hold an evidentiary hearing to make the necessary factual determinations\n\nabout the motives and credibility of the person signing the allegedly groundless petition.\n\nBisby v. Dow Chem. Co., 931 S.W.2d 18, 21 (Tex. App.–Houston [1st Dist.] 1996, no writ).\n\nIn evaluating an allegation of a rule 13 violation, “[c]ourts shall presume that pleadings,\n\nmotions, and other papers are filed in good faith.” TEX . R. CIV. P. 13. The party seeking\n\nsanctions bears the burden of overcoming the presumption of good faith in the filing of\n\npleadings. GTE Commc’n Sys. Corp., 856 S.W.2d at 731. A court may not impose\n\nsanctions under rule 13 “except for good cause, the particulars of which must be stated in\n\nthe sanction order.” Id. at 730. “A trial court's failure to specify the good cause for\n\nsanctions in a sanction order may be an abuse of discretion.” Gaspard v. Beadle, 36\n\nS.W.3d 229, 239 (Tex. App.–Houston [1st Dist.] 2001, pet. denied). A rule 13 sanction\n\norder must be supported by specific allegations of good cause. Id.\n\n         The purposes of the Rule 13 particularity requirement are to: (1) ensure that the trial\n\ncourt is held accountable and adheres to the standard of the rule; (2) require the trial court\n\nto reflect carefully on its order before imposing sanctions; (3) inform the offending party of\n\n\n\n                                                4\n\fthe particular conduct warranting sanction, for the purpose of deterring similar conduct in\n\nthe future; and (4) enable the appellate court to review the order in light of the particular\n\nfindings made by the trial court. Houtex Ready Mix Concrete & Materials v. Eagle Constr.\n\n& Envtl. Servs., L.P., 226 S.W.3d 514, 522 (Tex. App.–Houston [1st Dist.] 2006, no pet.).\n\n“In reviewing sanction orders, the appellate courts are not bound by a trial court's findings\n\nof fact and conclusions of law; rather, appellate courts must independently review the entire\n\nrecord to determine whether the trial court abused its discretion.” Am. Flood Research, Inc.\n\nv. Jones, 192 S.W.3d 581, 583 (Tex. 2006).\n\n       Under rule 13, “the signatures of attorneys or parties constitute a certificate by them\n\nthat they have read the pleading, motion, or other paper; that to the best of their knowledge,\n\ninformation, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry the instrument is not groundless and\n\nbrought in bad faith or groundless and brought for the purpose of harassment.” TEX . R. CIV.\n\nP. 13. Courts may, under rule 13, “impose sanctions against parties filing frivolous claims\n\nto deter similar conduct in the future and to compensate the aggrieved party by reimbursing\n\nthe costs incurred in responding to baseless pleadings.” Scott & White Mem'l Hosp. v.\n\nSchexnider, 940 S.W.2d 594, 596-97 (Tex. 1996).\n\n       “‘Groundless’ for purposes of this rule means no basis in law or fact and not\n\nwarranted by good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing\n\nlaw.” TEX . R. CIV. P. 13; see Hartman v. Urban, 946 S.W.2d 546, 551 (Tex. App.–Corpus\n\nChristi 1997, no writ). To determine if a pleading was groundless, that is, filed for an\n\nimproper purpose, the trial court must objectively ask whether the party and counsel made\n\na reasonable inquiry into the legal and factual basis of the claim at the time the suit was\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\ffiled. See Loeffler v. Lytle Indep. Sch. Dist., 211 S.W.3d 331, 348 (Tex. App.–San Antonio\n\n2006, pet. denied). A trial court may not base rule 13 sanctions on the legal merit of a\n\npleading or motion. Emmons v. Purser, 973 S.W.2d 696, 700 (Tex. App.–Austin 1998, no\n\npet.). The mere filing of a motion or pleading that the trial court denies does not entitle the\n\nopposing party to rule 13 sanctions. Id.\n\n       Section 9.012 of the civil practice and remedies code allows a trial court to penalize\n\na party for signing a petition that is groundless and brought in bad faith or for purposes of\n\nharassment or for other improper purposes. TEX . CIV. PRAC . & REM . CODE ANN . § 9.012\n\n(Vernon 2002).\n\n                                        2. Notice\n\n       Appellant complains appellee’s sanction motion was set without notice to appellant\n\non April 14, 2003. She further asserts the trial court issued a verbal order that no hearing\n\nwould be set without his signature. Thereafter, hearings proceeded on December 16, 2003\n\nand July 27, 2004. The final sanction order recites only its reliance upon the hearings of\n\nDecember 16, 2003, and July 27, 2004. Appellant’s allegations concerning the April 14,\n\n2003 matter are thus not material.\n\n       The record reflects that appellant’s plea to the jurisdiction was set and heard on\n\nDecember 16, 2003. After the trial court overruled appellant’s motion, appellee took the\n\nstand and proceeded to testify concerning the sanction matter. Appellant raised no\n\nobjection at that time and, in fact, cross-examined appellee. During the hearing, appellant\n\ninformed the court she was unprepared and requested an extension of time to conclude the\n\nsanction matter. Appellant stated she needed “A couple of days. . . .” The trial court\n\ngranted appellant additional time and re-set the matter. The hearing did not resume until\n\n                                              6\n\fJuly 27, 2004.\n\n        Appellee cites In re C. O. S., 988 S.W.2d 760, 466 (Tex. 1999) (discussing waivable\n\nand non-waivable rights) and Powers v. Palacios, 771 S.W.2d 716, 718 (Tex. App.–Corpus\n\nChristi 1989, writ denied) (noting that when appellants not only failed to object, but\n\nappeared, did not request a continuance, and fully participated in the hearing, any\n\ndeficiencies in service or notice were waived) (citing Sloan v. Rivers, 693 S.W.2d 782, 784\n\n(Tex. App.–Fort Worth 1985, no writ)). We agree with appellee that appellant waived any\n\nerror with regard to notice as to the date and time of the hearing. Powers, 771 S.W.2d at\n\n718.\n\n        Appellee also points out that his motion for sanctions gave notice of the hearing of\n\nDecember 16, 2003. While it is true that the motion did give notice of the hearing date\n\nitself, it relied only upon rule 13 and chapter 9 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies\n\nCode. See TEX . R. CIV. P. 13; TEX . CIV. PRAC . & REM . CODE ANN . § 9.001 (Vernon 2002).\n\nThe record does not show that appellant was provided with the required notice under\n\nchapter 10 by either the trial court or appellee. TEX . CIV. PRAC . & REM . CODE § 10.003.\n\nChapter 10 requires the court itself to give notice and an opportunity to respond to the “party\n\nwho is the subject of a motion for sanctions.” Id. §§ 10.001-.006. This was not done. Nor\n\nwas notice provided of the December 16, 2003 hearing, signed by the trial court, as required\n\nby the trial court’s own order to the parties.2 In other words, appellee failed to give notice\n\nas required by the trial court’s oral order, the trial court failed to give notice as required by\n\n\n        2\n          Because of m ultiple problem s between the parties concerning settings, the trial court instructed the\nparties that only the trial court would sign a notice for sanction hearings. This order of the trial court was\napparently ignored by appellee. The trial court itself gave no notice of the Decem ber 16, 2003 hearing under\nany of the possible bases for sanctions: chapter 9, chapter 10, or rule 13.\n\n                                                       7\n\fchapter 10, and appellee’s motion for sanctions gave no notice of any proceeding under\n\nchapter 10. Because the statutory notice requirements of chapter 10 were not met, it would\n\nbe an abuse of discretion to award sanctions on that basis. See Plano Sav. & Loan Asso.\n\nv. Slavin, 721 S.W.2d 282, 284 (Tex. 1986) (holding that party had inadequate notice of the\n\nsanctions hearing, which he was required to have).\n\n       We also note that the sanction order itself states it was based upon appellee’s\n\nmotion for sanctions. Again, that motion made no mention of chapter 10 sanctions.\n\n                                    Chapter 9 Sanctions\n\n       Notice under chapter 9, though seemingly less onerous than under chapter 10, still\n\nrequires “reasonable notice.” One salient difference on the imposition of sanctions under\n\nchapter 9 is its mandate to the trial court to afford the offending party ninety days within\n\nwhich to withdraw the offending pleading. TEX . CIV . PRAC . & REM . CODE ANN . § 9.012(c)\n\n(“the court shall, not earlier than 90 days after the date of the determination, at the trial or\n\nhearing or at a separate hearing following reasonable notice to the offending party, impose\n\nan appropriate sanction on the signatory, a represented party, or both.”)\n\n       Appellant argues, and we agree, that she was not afforded this opportunity. The\n\nsanctionable conduct was found and sanctions were awarded by the same court order of\n\nApril 21, 2005. This was the first notice to appellant that she would be sanctioned under\n\nchapter 9. While there is a letter from the court in August 2004, it neither sets forth the\n\nstatutory basis for the sanctions, nor does it grant any notice that would apprise appellant\n\nof her available remedy under chapter 9. See TEX . CIV. PRAC . & REM . CODE ANN . § 9.012(d)\n\n(court may not order an offending party to pay the incurred expenses of a party who stands\n\nin opposition to the offending pleading if, before the 90th day after the court makes a\n\n                                               8\n\fdetermination under subsection (a), the offending party withdraws the pleading or amends\n\nthe pleading to the satisfaction of the court or moves for dismissal of the pleading or the\n\noffending portion of the pleading). We also note the letter sets forth no basis upon which\n\nthe court determined the appropriate amount of the sanction.\n\n       Chapter 9 sets forth a clear two-part procedure. After determining that a pleading\n\nwas signed in violation of any one of the standards prescribed by section 9.011, “the court\n\nshall, not earlier than 90 days after the date of the determination, at the trial or hearing or\n\nat a separate hearing following reasonable notice to the offending party, impose an\n\nappropriate sanction on the signatory, a represented party, or both.” Id. § 9.012(c).\n\n       Here, the trial court determined that sanctions against appellant were appropriate\n\nand, in the same order on the same day, imposed a sanction. Because this order violates\n\nsection 9.012(c)'s requirement of a ninety-day interval between the date of determination\n\nof a violation and the imposition of a sanction, we conclude that chapter 9 cannot support\n\nthe trial court's order of sanctions. Id.; Elkins v. Stotts-Brown, 103 S.W.3d 664, 668 (Tex.\n\nApp.–Dallas 2003, no pet.).\n\n       Chapter 9 also specifically states that all determinations and orders pursuant to this\n\nchapter are solely for purposes of this chapter and shall not be the basis of any liability,\n\nsanction, or grievance other than as expressly provided in this chapter. TEX . CIV. PRAC . &\n\nREM . CODE ANN . § 9.012(g). Furthermore, the section does not apply to any proceeding to\n\nwhich section 10.004 or rule 13 applies. Id. § 9.012(h). Thus, to the extent the trial court\n\nconsidered any alleged violation under chapter 9 in awarding sanctions under rule 13, it was\n\nan abuse of discretion. See Low, 221 S.W.3d at 614.\n\n                                    Rule 13 Sanctions\n\n                                              9\n\f       We next examine whether the trial court’s sanction of $10,000 was justified under\n\nrule 13 alone. See TEX . R. CIV. P. 13. Rule 13 authorizes the imposition of the sanctions\n\nlisted in Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 215.2(b), which only provides for a monetary penalty\n\nbased on expenses, court costs, or attorney's fees. Low, 221 S.W.3d at 614. Generally,\n\na sanction cannot be excessive and should not be assessed without appropriate guidelines.\n\nId. at 620. When an appellate court reviews a sanctions order, it must perform a two-part\n\nTransAmerican analysis. See Jones, 192 S.W.3d at 585 (citing TransAmerican Natural\n\nGas Corp. v. Powell, 811 S.W.2d 913, 917 (Tex. 1991)). We should determine not only that\n\nsanctions are visited upon the true offender, but that less severe sanctions would not\n\npromote compliance. Id. Here, the first prong is arguably satisfied because the trial court\n\ndetermined that Dr. Campbell, appellant’s client, should not be sanctioned for his apparent\n\nanger and desire for retaliation against appellee. Rather, it was Campbell’s counsel’s\n\nobligation not to file the intervention for Campbell’s fees and other claims.\n\n       Rule 215.2(b), according to the supreme court, authorizes a monetary penalty based\n\non expenses, court costs, or attorney’s fees. Low, 221 S.W.3d at 614. In its order, the trial\n\ncourt found an amount of $10,000, “which represents reasonable and necessary attorney\n\nfees incurred by Hummell.” Hummell did not testify about costs or expenses. He did not\n\naddress the necessity of any attorney’s fees. He did not indicate familiarity with the usual\n\nand customary fees in or around Nueces County. He did not testify as to the amount of\n\ntime expended or by whom it was expended. In short, he did not testify about or otherwise\n\nsatisfy the Anderson factors. See Arthur Andersen & Co. v. Perry Equip. Corp., 945 S.W.2d\n\n812, 818 (Tex. 1997). Appellee only voiced a conclusory opinion on what constitutes a\n\n\n\n                                             10\n\freasonable fee: “According to reviewing the file and looking at the time, I would say\n\n$15,000.”\n\n      As a general rule, the party seeking to recover attorney's fees carries the burden of\n\nproof. Stewart Title Guaranty Co. v. Sterling, 822 S.W.2d 1, 10 (Tex. 1991) (citing, e.g.,\n\nKimbrough v. Fox, 631 S.W.2d 606, 609 (Tex. App.–Fort Worth 1982, no writ); Corpus\n\nChristi Dev. Corp. v. Carlton, 644 S.W.2d 521, 523 (Tex. App.–Corpus Christi 1982, no\n\nwrit); Bavarian Autohaus, Inc. v. Holland, 570 S.W.2d 110, 116 (Tex. Civ. App.–Houston\n\n[1st Dist.] 1978, no writ)). When a party seeks to recover attorney's fees in cases where\n\nthere are multiple defendants, and one or more of those defendants have made\n\nsettlements, a plaintiff must segregate the fees owed by the remaining defendants from\n\nthose owed by the settling defendants so that the remaining defendants are not charged\n\nfees for which they are not responsible.

The record does not independently support the necessity of\n\n$10,000 worth of sanctions. See TEX . R. APP. P. 44.1(2). The problem is amplified by the\n\nfact that sanctions were not available under chapter 9 or chapter 10, as discussed above.\n\n      Generally, a sanction cannot be excessive, nor should it be assessed without\n\nappropriate guidelines. Low, 221 S.W.3d at 620-21. The absence of an explanation of how\n\na trial court determined that amount of sanctions when those sanctions are especially\n\nsevere is inadequate. Id. Although the trial court is not required to address all of the\n\navailable factors, it should consider relevant factors in assessing the amount of the\n\nsanction. Id. Some of the factors to be considered by the trial court include:\n\n      a. the good faith or bad faith of the offender;\n\n      b. the degree of willfulness, vindictiveness, negligence, or frivolousness\n      involved in the offense;\n\n      c. the knowledge, experience, and expertise of the offender;\n\n      d. any prior history of sanctionable conduct on the part of the offender;\n\n      e. the reasonableness and necessity of the out-of-pocket expenses incurred\n      by the offended person as a result of the misconduct;\n\n      f. the nature and extent of prejudice, apart from out-of-pocket expenses,\n      suffered by the offended person as a result of the misconduct;\n\n      g. the relative culpability of client and counsel, and the impact on their\n      privileged relationship of an inquiry into that area;\n\n      h. the risk of chilling the specific type of litigation involved;\n\n      i. the impact of the sanction on the offender, including the offender's ability to\n      pay a monetary sanction;\n\n      j. the impact of the sanction on the offended party, including the offended\n      person’s need for compensation;\n\n                                              12\n\f       k. the relative magnitude of sanction necessary to achieve the goal or goals\n       of the sanction;\n\n       l. burdens on the court system attributable to the misconduct, including\n       consumption of judicial time and incurrence of juror fees and other court\n       costs;\n\n       ***\n\n       n. the degree to which the offended person’s own behavior caused the\n       expenses for which recovery is sought . . . .\n\n\nId.\n\n       In this case, the record does not indicate the trial court considered the relevant\n\nfactors, and particularly whether or not a lesser sanction would have been sufficient\n\nregarding this apparent one-time episode by counsel. See Spohn Hosp. v. Mayer, 104\n\nS.W.3d 878, 883 (Tex. 2003) (the record should contain some explanation of the\n\nappropriateness of the sanctions imposed). The record is silent regarding the consideration\n\nand effectiveness of less stringent sanctions. Finally, the severity of sanctions is also\n\nlimited by constitutional standards. TEX . CONST . art. I, § 13; Pennington v. Singleton, 606\n\nS.W.2d 682, 690 (Tex. 1980).\n\n                                      Conclusion\n\n       In sum, the stated bases for the trial court’s sanction were violations of chapters 9\n\nand 10 of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code, and rule 13. For the reasons stated\n\nabove, the record does not support either chapter 9 or chapter 10 as a valid basis for\n\nsanctions in this case. While sanctions may be available here under rule 13, both the lack\n\nof evidence for the amount of necessary attorney’s fees and the failure of the trial court to\n\ndemonstrate either the rationale for the sanction imposed or that a lesser sanction would\n\n                                             13\n\fhave sufficed, require a remand. There is no showing that less severe sanctions would not\n\npromote compliance. Jones, 192 S.W.3d at 585. Upon remand, the trial court should also\n\nconsider the conduct of appellee, including appellant’s allegations of misconduct made\n\napparently for the first time in this appeal.

Chapter 10 requires the\n\ncourt to provide a party subject to sanctions with notice and a reasonable opportunity to\n\nrespond to the allegations. Id. § 10.003. “A court that determines that a person has signed\n\na pleading or motion in violation of Section 10.001 may impose a sanction on the person,\n\na party represented by the person, or both.” Id. § 10.004(a). “The sanction must be limited\n\nto what is sufficient to deter repetition of the conduct or comparable conduct by others\n\nsimilarly situated.” Id. § 10.004(b). The sanction may include: “(1) a directive to the violator\n\nto perform, or refrain from performing, an act; (2) an order to pay a penalty into court; and\n\n(3) an order to pay to the other party the amount of the reasonable expenses incurred by\n\nthe other party because of the filing of the pleading or motion, including reasonable\n\nattorney's fees.” Id. § 10.004(c). If the court determines that section 10.001 has been\n\nviolated and that a sanction should be imposed, then the “court shall describe in an order\n\nimposing a sanction under this chapter the conduct the court has determined violated\n\nSection 10.001 and explain the basis for the sanction imposed.” Id. § 10.005.\n\n       Chapter 10 of the Texas Civil Practices and Remedies Code provides two ways to\n\ninitiate sanctions proceedings concerning frivolous pleadings and motions: (1) a\n\nparty-initiated motion, as authorized by section 10.002(a), describing specific conduct in\n\n\n\n                                               3\n\fviolation of section 10.001, or (2) a court-initiated motion with a show cause order from the\n\ncourt, as authorized by section 10.002(b). Here, the trial court never issued a show cause\n\norder.\n\n         Rule 13 provides for sanctions if a party files a pleading that is “groundless and\n\nbrought in bad faith or groundless and brought for the purpose of harassment.” TEX .

After the trial court overruled appellant’s motion, appellee took the\n\nstand and proceeded to testify concerning the sanction matter.

Because the statutory notice requirements of chapter 10 were not met, it would\n\nbe an abuse of discretion to award sanctions on that basis. See Plano Sav. & Loan Asso.\n\nv. Slavin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2402146\"><a href=\"/opinion/2402146/plano-sav-loan-assn-v-slavin/\"><span class=\"volume\">721</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">282</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 284 (Tex. 1986) (holding that party had inadequate notice of the\n\nsanctions hearing, which he was required to have).\n\n       We also note that the sanction order itself states it was based upon appellee’s\n\nmotion for sanctions. Again, that motion made no mention of chapter 10 sanctions.\n\n                                    Chapter 9 Sanctions\n\n       Notice under chapter 9, though seemingly less onerous than under chapter 10, still\n\nrequires “reasonable notice.” One salient difference on the imposition of sanctions under\n\nchapter 9 is its mandate to the trial court to afford the offending party ninety days within\n\nwhich to withdraw the offending pleading. TEX . CIV . PRAC . & REM . CODE ANN . § 9.012(c)\n\n(“the court shall, not earlier than 90 days after the date of the determination, at the trial or\n\nhearing or at a separate hearing following reasonable notice to the offending party, impose\n\nan appropriate sanction on the signatory, a represented party, or both.”)\n\n       Appellant argues, and we agree, that she was not afforded this opportunity. The\n\nsanctionable conduct was found and sanctions were awarded by the same court order of\n\nApril 21, 2005. This was the first notice to appellant that she would be sanctioned under\n\nchapter 9. While there is a letter from the court in August 2004, it neither sets forth the\n\nstatutory basis for the sanctions, nor does it grant any notice that would apprise appellant\n\nof her available remedy under chapter 9. See TEX . CIV. PRAC . & REM . CODE ANN . § 9.012(d)\n\n(court may not order an offending party to pay the incurred expenses of a party who stands\n\nin opposition to the offending pleading if, before the 90th day after the court makes a\n\n                                               8\n\fdetermination under subsection (a), the offending party withdraws the pleading or amends\n\nthe pleading to the satisfaction of the court or moves for dismissal of the pleading or the\n\noffending portion of the pleading). We also note the letter sets forth no basis upon which\n\nthe court determined the appropriate amount of the sanction.\n\n       Chapter 9 sets forth a clear two-part procedure. After determining that a pleading\n\nwas signed in violation of any one of the standards prescribed by section 9.011, “the court\n\nshall, not earlier than 90 days after the date of the determination, at the trial or hearing or\n\nat a separate hearing following reasonable notice to the offending party, impose an\n\nappropriate sanction on the signatory, a represented party, or both.” Id. § 9.012(c).\n\n       Here, the trial court determined that sanctions against appellant were appropriate\n\nand, in the same order on the same day, imposed a sanction. Because this order violates\n\nsection 9.012(c)'s requirement of a ninety-day interval between the date of determination\n\nof a violation and the imposition of a sanction, we conclude that chapter 9 cannot support\n\nthe trial court's order of sanctions. Id.; Elkins v. Stotts-Brown, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1465047\"><a href=\"/opinion/1465047/elkins-v-stotts-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">664</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 668 (Tex.\n\nApp.–Dallas 2003, no pet.).\n\n       Chapter 9 also specifically states that all determinations and orders pursuant to this\n\nchapter are solely for purposes of this chapter and shall not be the basis of any liability,\n\nsanction, or grievance other than as expressly provided in this chapter. TEX . CIV. PRAC . &\n\nREM . CODE ANN . § 9.012(g). Furthermore, the section does not apply to any proceeding to\n\nwhich section 10.004 or rule 13 applies. Id. § 9.012(h). Thus, to the extent the trial court\n\nconsidered any alleged violation under chapter 9 in awarding sanctions under rule 13, it was\n\nan abuse of discretion. See Low, 221 S.W.3d at 614.\n\n                                    Rule 13 Sanctions\n\n                                              9\n\f       We next examine whether the trial court’s sanction of $10,000 was justified under\n\nrule 13 alone. See TEX . R. CIV. P. 13. Rule 13 authorizes the imposition of the sanctions\n\nlisted in Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 215.2(b), which only provides for a monetary penalty\n\nbased on expenses, court costs, or attorney's fees. Low, 221 S.W.3d at 614. Generally,\n\na sanction cannot be excessive and should not be assessed without appropriate guidelines.\n\nId. at 620. When an appellate court reviews a sanctions order, it must perform a two-part\n\nTransAmerican analysis. See Jones, 192 S.W.3d at 585 (citing TransAmerican Natural\n\nGas Corp. v. Powell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1682240\"><a href=\"/opinion/1682240/transamerican-natural-gas-corp-v-powell/\"><span class=\"volume\">811</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">913</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 917 (Tex. 1991)). We should determine not only that\n\nsanctions are visited upon the true offender, but that less severe sanctions would not\n\npromote compliance. Id. Here, the first prong is arguably satisfied because the trial court\n\ndetermined that Dr. Campbell, appellant’s client, should not be sanctioned for his apparent\n\nanger and desire for retaliation against appellee. Rather, it was Campbell’s counsel’s\n\nobligation not to file the intervention for Campbell’s fees and other claims.\n\n       Rule 215.2(b), according to the supreme court, authorizes a monetary penalty based\n\non expenses, court costs, or attorney’s fees. Low, 221 S.W.3d at 614. In its order, the trial\n\ncourt found an amount of $10,000, “which represents reasonable and necessary attorney\n\nfees incurred by Hummell.” Hummell did not testify about costs or expenses. He did not\n\naddress the necessity of any attorney’s fees. He did not indicate familiarity with the usual\n\nand customary fees in or around Nueces County. He did not testify as to the amount of\n\ntime expended or by whom it was expended. In short, he did not testify about or otherwise\n\nsatisfy the Anderson factors. See Arthur Andersen & Co. v.

The record does not independently support the necessity of\n\n$10,000 worth of sanctions. See TEX . R. APP. P. 44.1(2). The problem is amplified by the\n\nfact that sanctions were not available under chapter 9 or chapter 10, as discussed above.\n\n      Generally, a sanction cannot be excessive, nor should it be assessed without\n\nappropriate guidelines. Low, 221 S.W.3d at 620-21. The absence of an explanation of how\n\na trial court determined that amount of sanctions when those sanctions are especially\n\nsevere is inadequate. Id. Although the trial court is not required to address all of the\n\navailable factors, it should consider relevant factors in assessing the amount of the\n\nsanction. Id. Some of the factors to be considered by the trial court include:\n\n      a. the good faith or bad faith of the offender;\n\n      b. the degree of willfulness, vindictiveness, negligence, or frivolousness\n      involved in the offense;\n\n      c. the knowledge, experience, and expertise of the offender;\n\n      d. any prior history of sanctionable conduct on the part of the offender;\n\n      e. the reasonableness and necessity of the out-of-pocket expenses incurred\n      by the offended person as a result of the misconduct;\n\n      f. the nature and extent of prejudice, apart from out-of-pocket expenses,\n      suffered by the offended person as a result of the misconduct;\n\n      g. the relative culpability of client and counsel, and the impact on their\n      privileged relationship of an inquiry into that area;\n\n      h. the risk of chilling the specific type of litigation involved;\n\n      i. the impact of the sanction on the offender, including the offender's ability to\n      pay a monetary sanction;\n\n      j. the impact of the sanction on the offended party, including the offended\n      person’s need for compensation;\n\n                                              12\n\f       k. the relative magnitude of sanction necessary to achieve the goal or goals\n       of the sanction;\n\n       l. burdens on the court system attributable to the misconduct, including\n       consumption of judicial time and incurrence of juror fees and other court\n       costs;\n\n       ***\n\n       n. the degree to which the offended person’s own behavior caused the\n       expenses for which recovery is sought . . . .\n\n\nId.\n\n       In this case, the record does not indicate the trial court considered the relevant\n\nfactors, and particularly whether or not a lesser sanction would have been sufficient\n\nregarding this apparent one-time episode by counsel. See Spohn Hosp. v.

For the reasons stated\n\nabove, the record does not support either chapter 9 or chapter 10 as a valid basis for\n\nsanctions in this case. While sanctions may be available here under rule 13, both the lack\n\nof evidence for the amount of necessary attorney’s fees and the failure of the trial court to\n\ndemonstrate either the rationale for the sanction imposed or that a lesser sanction would\n\n                                             13\n\fhave sufficed, require a remand. There is no showing that less severe sanctions would not\n\npromote compliance. Jones, 192 S.W.3d at 585. Upon remand, the trial court should also\n\nconsider the conduct of appellee, including appellant’s allegations of misconduct made\n\napparently for the first time in this appeal.
