In this case, the question presented is\n\nwhether settlement agreements between a public school and the\n\nparents of a public school student who requires special\n\neducation services are \"public records\" or exempt from\n\ndisclosure.   We conclude that the settlement agreements,\n\nregarding placement of students in out-of-district private\n\neducational institutions, are exempt from the definition of\n\n\"public records\" in G. L. c. 4, § 7, Twenty-sixth.   The\n\nagreements qualify as \"education records\" under 20 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1232g (2012 & Supp. II 2014), known as the Family Educational\n\nRights and Privacy Act (FERPA), and as such, fit within\n\nexemption (a) of the definition of \"public records,\" G. L. c. 4,\n\n§ 7, Twenty-sixth (a) (exemption [a]).   The settlement\n\nagreements also contain information that relates to specifically\n\nnamed individuals, the disclosure of which may qualify as an\n\n\"unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,\" and therefore fit\n\nwithin exemption (c), G. L. c. 4, § 7, Twenty-sixth (c)\n\f                                                                   3\n\n\n(exemption [c]).    We further conclude, however, that the\n\nsettlement agreements may be redacted to remove personally\n\nidentifiable information they contain, after which they become\n\nsubject to disclosure under G. L. c. 66, § 10, the Massachusetts\n\npublic records law.2\n\n     Background.3   The defendant Weston Public Schools (school\n\ndistrict) is obligated to provide a free and appropriate public\n\neducation to all students or school-age children with\n\n\n\n     2\n       We acknowledge the amicus briefs submitted by the\nDepartment of Elementary and Secondary Education; American Civil\nLiberties Union of Massachusetts; Massachusetts Association of\nSchool Committees, Inc.; Lyons & Rogers, LLC; and Attorney Mary\nEllen Sowyrda. We note that Attorney Sowyrda is a partner in\nthe law firm that represents the town in this case. She is the\nhead of the firm's special education group. In these\ncircumstances, her filing a separate brief, purportedly as an\namicus, to make further arguments supporting the client's\nposition, was ill-advised -- particularly as it appears from the\nrecord that Attorney Sowyrda participated in drafting the\nsettlement agreement between the plaintiff and the town, and\nalso represented the town earlier in this matter before the\nsupervisor of public records. See Aspinall v. Philip Morris\nCos., 442 Mass. 381, 385 n.8 (2004) (\"Briefs of amicus curiae\nare intended to represent the views of nonparties; they are not\nintended as vehicles for parties or their counsel to make\nadditional arguments beyond those that fit within the page\nconstraints of their briefs\"). Cf. S.M. Shapiro, K.S. Geller,\nT.S. Bishop, E.A. Hartnett, & D. Himmelfarb, Supreme Court\nPractice § 13.14 (10th ed. 2013) (discussing disclosure\nrequirements of United States Supreme Court Rule 37.6;\nsuggesting that some amicus briefs deserve \"a lesser degree of\ncredibility\").\n     3\n       In the Superior Court, judgment entered on cross motions\nfor judgment on the pleadings. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (c), 365\nMass. 754 (1974). We take the background facts from the\ncomplaint and the answer.\n\f                                                                    4\n\n\ndisabilities4 in accordance with G. L. c. 71B, § 1, and the\n\nFederal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), 20\n\nU.S.C. §§ 1400 et seq. (2012).     From time to time, the school\n\ndistrict enters into settlement agreements (agreements) with\n\nparents of students with disabilities to resolve disputes over\n\nentitlement to public funding for specific services or out-of-\n\ndistrict educational placements.    On January 17, 2012, the\n\nplaintiff, Michael Champa, a resident of the school district,\n\nsent a public records request for, as is relevant here,\n\n\"[c]opies of all agreements entered into by the [school\n\ndistrict] with parents and guardians, as part of the\n\n[individualized education program (IEP)] process,[5] in which the\n\n[school district] limited its contribution to education funding\n\nor attached conditions for it for out of district placements\"\n\n\n     4\n       The Commonwealth's special education law, G. L. c. 71B,\ndefines a \"school age child with a disability\" as \"a school age\nchild in a public or non-public school setting who, because of a\ndisability consisting of a developmental delay or any\nintellectual, sensory, neurological, emotional, communication,\nphysical, specific learning or health impairment or combination\nthereof, is unable to progress effectively in regular education\nand requires special education services . . . . The use of the\nword disability in this section shall not be used to provide a\nbasis for labeling or stigmatizing the child or defining the\nneeds of the child and shall in no way limit the services,\nprograms, and integration opportunities provided to such child.\"\nG. L. c. 71B, § 1.\n     5\n       The school district disputes that the settlement\nagreements (agreements) are part of the individual education\nprogram (IEP) process, but we have no need to resolve that\ndispute in order to decide this case.\n\f                                                                   5\n\n\nfor school years 2007-2012.   The school district's interim\n\ndirector of student services responded to the plaintiff's\n\nrequest in a letter dated January 30, 2012, stating that the\n\ninformation was not a matter of public record and that\n\n\"disclosure of the requested student records, in whole or in\n\npart, would constitute a violation of the Family Education\n\nRights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and the Massachusetts [Student]\n\nRecord Regulations.\"   The plaintiff sought review by the\n\nsupervisor of public records, who ruled that the records sought\n\nare exempt from disclosure.   The plaintiff then commenced this\n\naction in the Superior Court, seeking a declaration that the\n\nagreements were public records as well as a permanent injunction\n\nordering their disclosure.6\n\n\n     6\n       The agreements between the school district and families\nare at the heart of the dispute in this case. The record in\nfront of the motion judge appeared to have contained what the\njudge referred to in her written memorandum of decision as a\n\"sample settlement agreement,\" but the document she referenced\nis not included in the record before us (at least under that\ndescription). The record here does contain a copy of an\nagreement between the school district and the plaintiff that\nconcerns the educational programming of the plaintiff's\ndaughter. This agreement contains the daughter's name and her\nparents' names, and identifies the child as a child with special\neducation needs. Copies of IEPs prepared for the child are\nreferenced in the agreement and attached to it. The agreement\nrefers to the child's private school placement. Further, the\nagreement discusses the financial terms governing the private\nschool placement and the child's transportation to and from that\nschool. Because the record only contains one agreement, we are\nnot in a position to generalize about the types of information\nthat the agreements may contain. In support of the school\ndistrict's motion to stay pending appeal, the school district\n\f                                                                    6\n\n\n    On cross motions for judgment on the pleadings, a judge in\n\nthe Superior Court (motion judge) allowed the plaintiff's motion\n\nand denied the school district's.   The motion judge concluded\n\nthat the agreements are \"public records,\" not exempt under\n\nexemption (a), and although she recognized that certain portions\n\nof the agreements fell within the privacy exemption of exemption\n\n(c), she concluded that, with the name of the child and any\n\ndescription of the child's disability redacted, the agreements\n\nwere subject to disclosure.   The final judgment declared that\n\nthe agreements were public records, were not \"student records\"\n\nunder the Massachusetts student record regulations or \"education\n\nrecords\" under FERPA, and were not exempt from disclosure\n\npursuant to exemption (a) or exemption (c).   The school district\n\nwas ordered to provide the plaintiff with a copy of all the\n\nagreements requested after the names of the students and any\n\nmention of disability were redacted, but further provided that\n\n\n\nsubmitted affidavits of the defendant superintendent and\ndirector of student services. The affidavits aver that the\nagreements are maintained by the school district as part of an\nindividual student's temporary education record, are kept in the\nstudent's special education file, and indicate that an agreement\nmay contain information about a particular student's disability,\nprogress, and needs, including emotional disabilities so serious\nthat the student is not able to attend public school, and\ninformation about the educational services a student will\nreceive. Given the undeveloped state of the record in relation\nto the agreements, in reaching our decision on the present\nappeal, we have accepted as accurate the general descriptions of\nthe contents of the agreements provided by these affidavits.\n\f                                                                      7\n\n\nthe school district could apply to the court for clarification\n\nas to any other \"unanticipated\" personal information that\n\narguably might disclose the identity of a particular student.\n\nThe school district filed a notice of appeal.\n\n    Following the motion judge's decision allowing the\n\nplaintiff's motion for judgment on the pleadings, the school\n\ndistrict filed a motion to stay pending appeal, supported by\n\naffidavits of the superintendent and the director of student\n\nservices, which the motion judge allowed \"[d]ue to the unique\n\nnature of this case and the significance of such disclosure.\"\n\nWe transferred the case to this court on our own motion.\n\n    Discussion.     1.   Standard of review.   \"We review de novo a\n\njudge's order allowing a motion for judgment on the pleadings\n\nunder Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (c), 365 Mass. 754 (1974).\"      Merriam\n\nv. Demoulas Super Mkts., Inc., 464 Mass. 721, 726 (2013).     A\n\nmotion for judgment on the pleadings tests the legal sufficiency\n\nof the complaint.    Minaya v. Massachusetts Credit Union Share\n\nIns. Corp., 392 Mass. 904, 905 (1984).    For the purposes of a\n\nrule 12 (c) motion, all of the well-pleaded factual allegations\n\nof the nonmoving party are assumed to be true.      Id.\n\n    2.   Public records law.    General Laws c. 66, § 10, of the\n\nMassachusetts public records law (public records law) requires\n\naccess to public records in the possession of public officials.\n\nGlobe Newspaper Co. v. Boston Retirement Bd., 388 Mass. 427, 430\n\f                                                                      8\n\n\n(1983).     \"Public records\" are broadly defined, and include all\n\n\"documentary materials or data, regardless of physical form or\n\ncharacteristics, made or received by any officer or employee of\n\nany agency, executive office, department, board, commission,\n\nbureau, division or authority of the [C]ommonwealth, or of any\n\npolitical subdivision thereof.\"     G. L. c. 4, § 7, Twenty-sixth.\n\n    Due to the broad scope of the public records law, in any\n\ncourt proceeding challenging the withholding of a requested\n\ndocument, \"there shall be a presumption that the record sought\n\nis public, and the burden shall be upon the custodian to prove\n\nwith specificity the exemption which applies.\"       G. L. c. 66,\n\n§ 10 (c).    The statute's unambiguous language mandates\n\ndisclosure of requested records limited only by the definition\n\nof \"public records\" found in G. L. c. 4, § 7, Twenty-sixth.         See\n\nDaRosa v. New Bedford, 471 Mass. 446, 451 (2015).       There is no\n\ndispute that as a general matter, the town's records, including\n\nthe records of its schools, qualify as public records.      The\n\nquestion is whether the agreements are excepted from\n\nclassification as public records because they fit within one or\n\nmore of the statute's exemptions and, in particular, exemption\n\n(a) or exemption (c), or both.\n\n    a.      Exemption (a):   exemption by statute.   The definition\n\nof public records exempts materials or data that are\n\n\"specifically or by necessary implication exempted from\n\f                                                                     9\n\n\ndisclosure by statute.\"   G. L. c. 4, § 7, Twenty-sixth (a).    In\n\nMassachusetts, the disclosure of information about public school\n\nstudents is governed in part by FERPA, and the Massachusetts\n\nstudent records law, G. L. c. 71, § 34D, and its implementing\n\nregulations, 603 Code Mass. Regs. §§ 23.00 (2006).   The\n\ndisclosure of information regarding special education students\n\nsuch as the plaintiff's daughter is further governed by the\n\nIDEA, and the Massachusetts special education law, G. L. 71B.\n\nThe motion judge concluded that the agreements did not qualify\n\nas \"education records\" under FERPA or as \"student records\" under\n\n603 Code Mass. Regs. §§ 23.00, and therefore exemption (a) did\n\nnot apply.7   The motion judge interpreted or defined both\n\n\"education records\" and \"student records\" as including only\n\ndocuments directly relating to a student's academic progress,\n\nand determined that the agreements do not fit within such a\n\ndefinition.   We conclude that the definitions of these terms\n\nadopted by the judge were too narrow.\n\n\n\n\n     7\n       The parties do not appear to have brought the Individuals\nwith Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400 et\nseq. (2012), or the Massachusetts special education law, G. L.\nc. 71B, to the attention of the motion judge. In any event, the\njudge did not mention these statutes in her memorandum of\ndecision.\n\f                                                                   10\n\n\n    i.   FERPA.    FERPA8 defines \"education records\" as materials\n\nthat \"(i) contain information directly related to a student; and\n\n(ii) are maintained by an educational agency or institution or\n\nby a person acting for such agency or institution.\"    20 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1232g(a)(4)(A).    Neither FERPA nor its regulations limit the\n\ndefinition of \"education records\" to material relating to the\n\nstudent's academic progress.    Under FERPA, the term \"education\n\nrecords\" has a broad scope.    See United States v. Miami Univ.,\n\n91 F. Supp. 2d 1132, 1149 (S.D. Ohio 2000) (\"FERPA broadly\n\ndefines 'education records'\"); Belanger v. Nashua, N.H., Sch.\n\nDist., 856 F. Supp. 40, 48 (D.N.H. 1994), aff'd, 294 F.3d 797\n\n(6th Cir. 2002).    See also Commonwealth v. Buccella, 434 Mass.\n\n473, 491 (2001) (Marshall, C.J., concurring in part and\n\ndissenting in part), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 1079 (2002), quoting\n\n5 J.A. Rapp, Education Law § 13.04[4][a] (2000) (education\n\nrecords under \"broad mandate\" of FERPA intended to cover all\n\naspects of student's educational life that \"relate to academic\n\nmatters or status as a student\").\n\n\n\n\n    8\n       The statute known as the Family Education Rights and\nPrivacy Act (FERPA), 20 U.S.C. § 1232g (2012 & Supp. II 2014),\ndoes not expressly prohibit disclosure of \"education records,\"\nbut it does condition receipt of Federal funds on the\nnondisclosure of education records. This is sufficient, as a\npractical matter, to satisfy the requirement that a statute\nexempt data or information by \"necessary implication.\" G. L.\nc. 4, § 7, Twenty-sixth (a).\n\f                                                                    11\n\n\n     The agreements at issue are \"education records\" under FERPA\n\nbecause they satisfy both elements of the statutory definition.\n\nThere is no dispute that the agreements \"contain information\n\ndirectly related to a student\" -- no one disputes that they\n\ncontain the name of the student (as well as those of the\n\nstudent's parents) -- and they \"are maintained by an educational\n\nagency.\"9    In addition, the agreements may establish a student's\n\nschool placement and they appear to define, at least in part, a\n\nstudent's educational programming, two matters that fall\n\ndirectly within the ambit of academic matters and status as a\n\nstudent.    The school district maintains the agreements and keeps\n\nthe documents in the individual student's special education\n\nfile.\n\n     The fact that the agreements fall within the coverage of\n\nexemption (a) does not end the matter.     The public records law\n\nspecifically contemplates redaction of material that would be\n\nexempt, to enable the release of the remaining portions of a\n\nrecord.     G. L. c. 66, § 10 (a) (requiring disclosure of \"any\n\nsegregable portion of a record\").    See Reinstein v. Police\n\nComm'r of Boston, 378 Mass. 281, 288 n.15 (1979) (\"The 1978\n\namendment [to G. L. c. 66, § 10 (a),] requires disclosure of\n\n. . . any portion that falls within the statutory definition of\n\n     9\n       Further, the agreements do not fall within the list of\nstatutory exceptions to \"education records\" under FERPA. See 20\nU.S.C. § 1232g(a)(4)(B).\n\f                                                                  12\n\n\n'public record' after exempt portions have been deleted\").\n\nThrough its implementing regulations, FERPA provides a mechanism\n\nthat allows a school to disclose information from education\n\nrecords publicly after removal or \"de-identifi[cation]\" of all\n\npersonally identifiable information:   \"[a]n educational agency\n\nor institution, or a party that has received education records\n\nor information from education records under this part, may\n\nrelease the records or information without the consent [of\n\nparents or eligible students] required by [34 C.F.R.] § 99.30\n\nafter the removal of all personally identifiable information\n\nprovided that the educational agency or institution or other\n\nparty has made a reasonable determination that a student's\n\nidentity is not personally identifiable, whether through single\n\nor multiple releases, and taking into account other reasonably\n\navailable information.\"   34 C.F.R. § 99.31(b)(1) (2012).\n\n    \"Personally identifiable information,\" as used in FERPA,\n\nincludes, but is not limited to, the student's name; the names\n\nof the student's parents or other family members; the address of\n\nthe student or student's family; personal identifiers, such as\n\nthe student's social security number; and indirect identifiers,\n\nsuch as the student's date of birth.   34 C.F.R. § 99.3 (2012).\n\nThe definition also includes \"[o]ther information that, alone or\n\nin combination, is linked or linkable to a specific student that\n\nwould allow a reasonable person in the school community, who\n\f                                                                  13\n\n\ndoes not have personal knowledge of the relevant circumstances,\n\nto identify the student with reasonable certainty,\" and\n\n\"[i]nformation requested by a person who the educational agency\n\nor institution reasonably believes knows the identity of the\n\nstudent to whom the education record relates.\"   Id.   The\n\nanalysis to determine what redaction is necessary will be a\n\ncase-by-case determination that considers the request, the\n\nschool and the community, and the availability to the requester\n\nof other information that indirectly identifies the student.     34\n\nC.F.R. §§ 99.3, 99.31(b)(1).\n\n    ii.   Massachusetts student records law and regulations.10\n\nGeneral Laws c. 71, § 34D, provides:   \"The board of education\n\n\n    10\n       The student records statute, G. L. c. 71, § 34D, does not\nspecifically address confidentiality of student records;\nconfidentiality is dealt with in the regulations promulgated by\nthe Department of Education (department) pursuant to § 34D. See\n603 Code Mass. Regs. § 23.07 (2006). Exemption (a) refers\nspecifically to exemptions by \"statute,\" and does not mention\nregulations. The town and the plaintiff appear not to question\nthat exemption (a) may cover material that a regulation requires\nto be treated as confidential, and more particularly, they\nappear to agree that material that would constitute part of a\n\"student record\" as defined in 603 Code Mass. Regs. §§ 23.02-\n23.03 (2002) would fall within the scope of exemption (a).\nTheir disagreement is over the question whether the agreements\nqualify as \"student record[s]\" under these regulations. As\ndiscussed supra, we have concluded that exemption (a) applies in\nthis case because FERPA fits squarely within the scope of\nexemption (a) and the agreements fit within the scope of FERPA's\ndefinition of \"education records.\" Because we interpret the\ndepartment's student record regulations to treat as confidential\nthe same types of information as FERPA does, we do not need to\ndecide in the present case whether the word \"statute\" in\nexemption (a) should be interpreted to include \"regulations\" --\n\f                                                                    14\n\n\nshall adopt regulations relative to the maintenance, retention,\n\nduplication, storage and periodic destruction of student records\n\nby the public elementary and secondary schools of the\n\n[C]ommonwealth.   Such rules and regulations shall provide that a\n\nparent or guardian of any pupil shall be allowed to inspect\n\nacademic, scholastic, or any other records concerning such pupil\n\nwhich are kept or are required to be kept.\"    In compliance with\n\nthe statutory directive, the Department of Education\n\n(department) has promulgated student record regulations, 603\n\nCode Mass. Regs. §§ 23.00, directing that no third party shall\n\nhave access to information in or from a student record without\n\nthe consent of the eligible student or the parent.   603 Code\n\nMass. Regs. § 23.07(4) (2006).\n\n    The regulations define \"[s]tudent [r]ecord\" as \"the\n\n[t]ranscript and the [t]emporary [r]ecord, including all\n\ninformation . . . regardless of physical form or characteristics\n\nconcerning a student that is organized on the basis of the\n\nstudent's name or in a way that such student may be individually\n\nidentified, and that is kept by the public schools of the\n\nCommonwealth.\"    603 Code Mass. Regs. § 23.02 (2002).   It is\n\n\"limited to information relevant to the educational needs of the\n\n\n\ngenerally, or at least in this instance. Rather, we assume,\nwithout deciding, that the department's student record\nregulations fit within the meaning of \"statute\" for purposes of\nexemption (a).\n\f                                                                   15\n\n\nstudent.\"   603 Code Mass. Regs. § 23.03 (2002).   We agree with\n\nthe motion judge that the agreements do not fit within the\n\nregulation's definition of \"transcript\";11 the issue is whether\n\nthey are part of the student’s \"temporary record.\"   The\n\ntemporary record includes all information in the student record\n\nnot contained in the transcript and is generally defined as\n\n\"information clearly . . . of importance to the educational\n\nprocess.\"   603 Code Mass. Regs. § 23.02.12\n\n     The record before us, limited as it is, indicates that an\n\nagreement is likely to contain information regarding a student's\n\ndisability, progress, and needs -- information that is\n\n     11\n       The transcript \"shall contain administrative records that\nconstitute the minimum data necessary to reflect the student's\neducational progress and to operate the educational system.\nThese data shall be limited to the name, address, and phone\nnumber of the student; his/her birth date; name, address, and\nphone number of the parent or guardian; course titles, grades\n(or the equivalent when grades are not applicable), course\ncredit, highest grade level completed, and the year completed.\"\n603 Code Mass. Regs. § 23.02. Independent of this regulation,\nthe plaintiff appears to agree that insofar as the agreements\ncontain the student's name and the parents' or guardians' names,\nthis information should be redacted before the agreements are\ndisclosed.\n     12\n       The regulation further provides that \"[s]uch information\nmay include standardized test results, class rank (when\napplicable), extracurricular activities, and evaluations by\nteachers, counselors, and other school staff.\" 603 Code Mass.\nRegs. § 23.02. This is the language on which the motion judge\nrelied to conclude that the temporary record, and thus the\nstudent record, pertains to a student's academic progress. Our\nreading of the pertinent regulations as a whole, however,\npersuades us that the \"temporary record\" has a broader scope\nthan purely a measurement of academic progress.\n\f                                                                    16\n\n\nunquestionably of importance to the student's \"educational\n\nprocess,\" see 603 Code Mass. Regs. § 23.02, and \"educational\n\nneeds.\"    603 Code Mass. Regs. § 23.03.   The agreement,\n\ntherefore, qualifies as part of the student's temporary record,\n\nand therefore as part of his or her \"student record.\"       However,\n\nlike FERPA, the Massachusetts student records law and\n\nregulations protect student records only as they pertain to\n\ncertain information -- not entire documents.     See 603 Code Mass.\n\nRegs. §§ 23.02 (defining student record and temporary record as\n\n\"all information . . . concerning a student\"), § 23.07(4) (third\n\nparties shall not have access to \"information in or from a\n\nstudent record\" [emphasis added]).     Accordingly, under the\n\npublic records law, any \"segregable portion\" of the record must\n\nbe disclosed, if with the redaction it independently is a public\n\nrecord.    G. L. c. 66, § 10 (a).\n\n    iii.    Special education law.13   The agreements by definition\n\nconcern special education programs for the students to whom the\n\nagreements relate.    Both the Federal IDEA and the Massachusetts\n\nspecial education law, G. L. c. 71B, contain provisions\n\nprotecting the confidentiality of the educational records of\n\nstudents with disabilities who receive special education\n\n    13\n       As mentioned, the applicability of the Federal IDEA and\nG. L. c. 71B apparently was not raised as an issue before the\nmotion judge. See note 7, supra. We briefly consider the\nstatutes here because they appear to be directly relevant.\n\f                                                                  17\n\n\nservices.    The IDEA adopts the confidentiality standards in\n\nFERPA and incorporates FERPA's definition of \"education\n\nrecords,\" see 20 U.S.C. 1417(c),14 but its implementing\n\nregulations introduce additional procedural protections to\n\nsafeguard the confidentiality of personally identifiable\n\ninformation for students with disabilities.    See 34 C.F.R.\n\n§§ 300.561, 300.572, 300.573 (2002).    And G. L. c. 71B, § 3,\n\nunlike G. L. c. 71, § 34D, contains explicit provisions about\n\nconfidentiality of information concerning students with\n\ndisabilities.15\n\n     Nothing in these statutes suggests that records relating to\n\nstudents are confidential once all personally identifiable\n\n     14\n       \"The Secretary shall take appropriate action, in\naccordance with [FERPA], to ensure the protection of the\nconfidentiality of any personally identifiable data,\ninformation, and records collected or maintained by the\nSecretary and by State educational agencies and local\neducational agencies pursuant to this subchapter.\" 20 U.S.C.\n§ 1417(c). See 34 C.F.R. §§ 300.610, 300.611 (2006).\n     15\n          General Laws c. 71B, § 3, provides, in relevant part:\n\n     \"The written record and clinical history from both the\n     evaluation provided by the school committee and independent\n     evaluation, if any, shall be made available to the parents,\n     guardians, or persons with custody of the child. Separate\n     instructions, limited to the information required for\n     adequate care of the child, shall be distributed only to\n     those persons directly concerned with the care of the\n     child. Otherwise said records shall be confidential.\"\n\nFurther, \"[e]valuations and assessments of children and special\neducation programs shall remain confidential and be used solely\nfor the administration of special education in the\n[C]ommonwealth.\"\n\f                                                                      18\n\n\ninformation is removed.    Rather, what is confidential is certain\n\ninformation, again indicating that redaction of such information\n\nmay render the particular document a public record that must be\n\ndisclosed on request under the public records law.\n\n    b.   Exemption (c):    privacy exemption.   The statutory\n\ndefinition of public records also exempts materials or data that\n\nare \"personnel and medical files or information; also any other\n\nmaterials or data relating to a specifically named individual,\n\nthe disclosure of which may constitute an unwarranted invasion\n\nof personal privacy.\"     G. L. c. 4, § 7, Twenty-sixth (c).    The\n\ninquiry under the privacy exemption \"requires that the\n\nseriousness of any invasion of privacy be balanced against the\n\npublic right to know.\"    Attorney Gen. v. Assistant Comm'r of the\n\nReal Prop. Dep't of Boston, 380 Mass. 623, 625 (1980).     \"Where\n\nthe public interest in obtaining information substantially\n\noutweighs the seriousness of any invasion of privacy, the\n\nprivate interest in preventing disclosure must yield to the\n\npublic interest\" (citation omitted).    Attorney Gen. v. Collector\n\nof Lynn, 377 Mass. 151, 156 (1979).\n\n    In identifying the existence of privacy interests, we\n\nconsider, in part, whether disclosure would result in personal\n\nembarrassment to an individual of normal sensibilities, whether\n\nthe materials sought contain intimate details of a highly\n\npersonal nature, and whether the same information is available\n\f                                                                  19\n\n\nfrom other sources.   Matter of a Subpoena Duces Tecum, 445 Mass.\n\n685, 688 (2006), quoting Globe Newspaper Co. v. Police Comm'r of\n\nBoston, 419 Mass. 852, 858 (1995).   See, e.g., Collector of\n\nLynn, 377 Mass. at 157 (public disclosure of lists of tax\n\ndelinquents results in personal embarrassment, but disclosure\n\ndoes not amount to intimate details that are highly personal in\n\nnature; disclosure required).\n\n     The agreements may contain information that amounts to an\n\nunwarranted invasion of the student's personal privacy.     As\n\npreviously discussed, the agreements may link the name of the\n\nindividual student (and his or her family) to information about\n\nthe services and programming the child will receive and\n\ninformation about the child's disability, progress, and needs.\n\nFurther, the agreements are likely to identify the out-of-\n\ndistrict school, which may indirectly identify the child's\n\ndisability.   This type of information is highly personal, and\n\ndisclosure may result in embarrassment and potentially lead to\n\nstigma,16 bringing it within the scope of exemption (c).\n\n     Nonetheless, like exemption (a), exemption (c) does not\n\ncover, and thereby authorizes withholding, information that does\n\n\n     16\n       When it enacted G. L. c. 71B, in 1972, the Legislature\nstated, \"The General Court . . . finds that past methods of\nlabeling and defining the needs of children have had a\nstigmatizing effect.\" St. 1972, c. 766, § 1. Currently, c. 71B\ncalls for a flexible definition of disability \"so as to minimize\nthe possibility of stigmatization.\" G. L. c. 71B, § 2.\n\f                                                                     20\n\n\nnot permit the identification of an individual.      Globe Newspaper\n\nCo. v. Boston Retirement Bd., 388 Mass. at 438.      As with\n\nexemption (a), the pertinent inquiry is whether the deletion of\n\nparticular identifying information from the documents sought\n\nplaces the documents outside the exemption.    Id.    In assessing\n\nwhether the documents contain identifying information, the\n\ninquiry must be considered \"not only from the viewpoint of the\n\npublic, but also from the vantage of those who [are familiar\n\nwith the individual].\"   Department of the Air Force v. Rose, 425\n\nU.S. 352, 380 (1976).    The agreements here, although they\n\ncontain identifying information, also include information that\n\ndoes not appear to invade the reasonable privacy interests of\n\nstudents or their families.   Notably, once personally\n\nidentifiable information is redacted, the financial terms of\n\nsuch agreements, which necessarily reflect the use of public\n\nmonies, partially or fully, to pay for out-of-district\n\nplacements, do not constitute an unwarranted invasion of\n\npersonal privacy; indeed, the public has a right to know the\n\nfinancial terms of these agreements.   See Collector of Lynn, 377\n\nMass. at 158.17   As is true with exemption (a), once the\n\n\n     17\n       The school district argues that the line item in its\nbudget that identifies the amount the district spends on out-of-\nschool placements is sufficient to serve the purpose for which\nthe plaintiff appears to want disclosure of the agreements, and\ntherefore public access to the agreements is not necessary.\nThis argument fails. The school district does not meet its\n\f                                                                   21\n\n\nappropriate redactions of personally identifiable information\n\nare made, the agreements will no longer fit within the scope of\n\nexemption (c) and must be disclosed.\n\n     c.   Confidentiality clause.   Finally, the school district\n\ncontends that the inclusion of a confidentiality clause in each\n\nof the agreements (other than the plaintiff's agreement) further\n\nprohibits their disclosure.18   The school district is incorrect.\n\nAlthough the agreement may have served as a private settlement\n\nof a dispute between the school district and one of the families\n\nliving in the school district, the fact that the school district\n\nand the family contractually agreed to keep the settlement\n\nprivate cannot, by itself, trump the public records law and the\n\nschool district's obligation to comply with the law's\n\n\n\n\nobligations with respect to the public records law by pointing\nout that the requester may be able to obtain some of the\ninformation from another source. Cf. Attorney Gen. v. Collector\nof Lynn, 377 Mass. 151, 157 (1979) (tax delinquent records did\nnot fit within exemption [c] but were subject to disclosure as\npublic records; court noted, \"the seriousness of any invasion of\nprivacy resulting from disclosure of the records of real estate\ntax delinquents is reduced since substantially the same\ninformation is available from other sources\"). Cf. also Bougas\nv. Chief of Police of Lexington, 371 Mass. 59, 64 (1976) (where\ndocuments do not fit within one of public records law\nexemptions, they are accessible by \"'any person' whether\nintimately involved with the subject matter of the records he\nseeks or merely motivated by idle curiosity\").\n     18\n       According to the affidavit of the superintendent filed in\nsupport of the school district's motion to stay, all of the\nagreements contain confidentiality provisions except the\nagreement regarding the plaintiff's daughter.\n\f                                                                     22\n\n\nrequirements.19    Cf. Ackerly v. Ley, 420 F.2d 1336, 1339 n.3\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1969) (discussing Federal Freedom of Information Act\n\n[FOIA], 5 U.S.C. § 552 [2012]:    \"It will obviously not be enough\n\nfor the agency to assert simply that it received the file under\n\na pledge of confidentiality to the one who supplied it.\n\nUndertakings of that nature can not, in and of themselves,\n\noverride the [FOIA]\").    Cf. also Hechler v. Casey, 175 W. Va.\n\n434, 444 (1985) (\"an agreement as to confidentiality between the\n\npublic body and the supplier of the information may not override\n\nthe [FOIA].   See Ackerly[, supra]\").\n\n     Conclusion.    The final judgment in this case was entered on\n\ncross motions for judgment on the pleadings.     We have concluded\n\nthat both exemption (a) and exemption (c) to the definition of\n\npublic records in G. L. c. 4, § 7, Twenty-sixth, apply to the\n\nagreements, but that personally identifying information in the\n\nagreements is subject to redaction, and when the agreements are\n\nproperly redacted, they must be disclosed.     The facts are too\n\nundeveloped in the record before us to make a determination\n\nregarding the necessary and appropriate redactions of personally\n\nidentifying information to be made; a remand of this case to the\n\n\n\n     19\n       This is not to say that every contractual agreement\nbetween a municipality or other public agency and a private\nparty that contains a confidentiality clause is subject to\ndisclosure as a public record; one of the statutory exemptions\nunder G. L. c. 4, § 7, Twenty-sixth, may apply to the agreement.\n\f                                                                  23\n\n\nSuperior Court is necessary to permit this to be accomplished.\n\nSee Georgiou v. Commissioner of the Dep't of Indus. Accs., 67\n\nMass. App. Ct. 428, 437-438 (2006).20   The judgment of the\n\nSuperior Court is vacated, and the case is remanded for further\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                   So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n     20\n       It would be appropriate for the school district to\npropose redactions and, if there is a dispute, for the judge to\nrule on the disputed redactions before the entry of judgment,\nrather than through the vehicle of a postjudgment motion for\nclarification.\n\f",

In this case, the question presented is\n\nwhether settlement agreements between a public school and the\n\nparents of a public school student who requires special\n\neducation services are \"public records\" or exempt from\n\ndisclosure.   We conclude that the settlement agreements,\n\nregarding placement of students in out-of-district private\n\neducational institutions, are exempt from the definition of\n\n\"public records\" in G. L. c. 4, § 7, Twenty-sixth.   The\n\nagreements qualify as \"education records\" under 20 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1232g (2012 & Supp. II 2014), known as the Family Educational\n\nRights and Privacy Act (FERPA), and as such, fit within\n\nexemption (a) of the definition of \"public records,\" G. L. c. 4,\n\n§ 7, Twenty-sixth (a) (exemption [a]).   The settlement\n\nagreements also contain information that relates to specifically\n\nnamed individuals, the disclosure of which may qualify as an\n\n\"unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,\" and therefore fit\n\nwithin exemption (c), G. L. c. 4, § 7, Twenty-sixth (c)\n\f                                                                   3\n\n\n(exemption [c]).    We further conclude, however, that the\n\nsettlement agreements may be redacted to remove personally\n\nidentifiable information they contain, after which they become\n\nsubject to disclosure under G. L. c. 66, § 10, the Massachusetts\n\npublic records law.2\n\n     Background.3   The defendant Weston Public Schools (school\n\ndistrict) is obligated to provide a free and appropriate public\n\neducation to all students or school-age children with\n\n\n\n     2\n       We acknowledge the amicus briefs submitted by the\nDepartment of Elementary and Secondary Education; American Civil\nLiberties Union of Massachusetts; Massachusetts Association of\nSchool Committees, Inc.; Lyons & Rogers, LLC; and Attorney Mary\nEllen Sowyrda. We note that Attorney Sowyrda is a partner in\nthe law firm that represents the town in this case. She is the\nhead of the firm's special education group. In these\ncircumstances, her filing a separate brief, purportedly as an\namicus, to make further arguments supporting the client's\nposition, was ill-advised -- particularly as it appears from the\nrecord that Attorney Sowyrda participated in drafting the\nsettlement agreement between the plaintiff and the town, and\nalso represented the town earlier in this matter before the\nsupervisor of public records.

From time to time, the school\n\ndistrict enters into settlement agreements (agreements) with\n\nparents of students with disabilities to resolve disputes over\n\nentitlement to public funding for specific services or out-of-\n\ndistrict educational placements.    On January 17, 2012, the\n\nplaintiff, Michael Champa, a resident of the school district,\n\nsent a public records request for, as is relevant here,\n\n\"[c]opies of all agreements entered into by the [school\n\ndistrict] with parents and guardians, as part of the\n\n[individualized education program (IEP)] process,[5] in which the\n\n[school district] limited its contribution to education funding\n\nor attached conditions for it for out of district placements\"\n\n\n     4\n       The Commonwealth's special education law, G. L. c. 71B,\ndefines a \"school age child with a disability\" as \"a school age\nchild in a public or non-public school setting who, because of a\ndisability consisting of a developmental delay or any\nintellectual, sensory, neurological, emotional, communication,\nphysical, specific learning or health impairment or combination\nthereof, is unable to progress effectively in regular education\nand requires special education services . . . . The use of the\nword disability in this section shall not be used to provide a\nbasis for labeling or stigmatizing the child or defining the\nneeds of the child and shall in no way limit the services,\nprograms, and integration opportunities provided to such child.\"\nG. L. c. 71B, § 1.\n     5\n       The school district disputes that the settlement\nagreements (agreements) are part of the individual education\nprogram (IEP) process, but we have no need to resolve that\ndispute in order to decide this case.\n\f                                                                   5\n\n\nfor school years 2007-2012.   The school district's interim\n\ndirector of student services responded to the plaintiff's\n\nrequest in a letter dated January 30, 2012, stating that the\n\ninformation was not a matter of public record and that\n\n\"disclosure of the requested student records, in whole or in\n\npart, would constitute a violation of the Family Education\n\nRights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and the Massachusetts [Student]\n\nRecord Regulations.\"   The plaintiff sought review by the\n\nsupervisor of public records, who ruled that the records sought\n\nare exempt from disclosure.   The plaintiff then commenced this\n\naction in the Superior Court, seeking a declaration that the\n\nagreements were public records as well as a permanent injunction\n\nordering their disclosure.6\n\n\n     6\n       The agreements between the school district and families\nare at the heart of the dispute in this case. The record in\nfront of the motion judge appeared to have contained what the\njudge referred to in her written memorandum of decision as a\n\"sample settlement agreement,\" but the document she referenced\nis not included in the record before us (at least under that\ndescription). The record here does contain a copy of an\nagreement between the school district and the plaintiff that\nconcerns the educational programming of the plaintiff's\ndaughter. This agreement contains the daughter's name and her\nparents' names, and identifies the child as a child with special\neducation needs. Copies of IEPs prepared for the child are\nreferenced in the agreement and attached to it. The agreement\nrefers to the child's private school placement. Further, the\nagreement discusses the financial terms governing the private\nschool placement and the child's transportation to and from that\nschool. Because the record only contains one agreement, we are\nnot in a position to generalize about the types of information\nthat the agreements may contain. In support of the school\ndistrict's motion to stay pending appeal, the school district\n\f                                                                    6\n\n\n    On cross motions for judgment on the pleadings, a judge in\n\nthe Superior Court (motion judge) allowed the plaintiff's motion\n\nand denied the school district's.   The motion judge concluded\n\nthat the agreements are \"public records,\" not exempt under\n\nexemption (a), and although she recognized that certain portions\n\nof the agreements fell within the privacy exemption of exemption\n\n(c), she concluded that, with the name of the child and any\n\ndescription of the child's disability redacted, the agreements\n\nwere subject to disclosure.   The final judgment declared that\n\nthe agreements were public records, were not \"student records\"\n\nunder the Massachusetts student record regulations or \"education\n\nrecords\" under FERPA, and were not exempt from disclosure\n\npursuant to exemption (a) or exemption (c).   The school district\n\nwas ordered to provide the plaintiff with a copy of all the\n\nagreements requested after the names of the students and any\n\nmention of disability were redacted, but further provided that\n\n\n\nsubmitted affidavits of the defendant superintendent and\ndirector of student services. The affidavits aver that the\nagreements are maintained by the school district as part of an\nindividual student's temporary education record, are kept in the\nstudent's special education file, and indicate that an agreement\nmay contain information about a particular student's disability,\nprogress, and needs, including emotional disabilities so serious\nthat the student is not able to attend public school, and\ninformation about the educational services a student will\nreceive. Given the undeveloped state of the record in relation\nto the agreements, in reaching our decision on the present\nappeal, we have accepted as accurate the general descriptions of\nthe contents of the agreements provided by these affidavits.\n\f                                                                      7\n\n\nthe school district could apply to the court for clarification\n\nas to any other \"unanticipated\" personal information that\n\narguably might disclose the identity of a particular student.\n\nThe school district filed a notice of appeal.\n\n    Following the motion judge's decision allowing the\n\nplaintiff's motion for judgment on the pleadings, the school\n\ndistrict filed a motion to stay pending appeal, supported by\n\naffidavits of the superintendent and the director of student\n\nservices, which the motion judge allowed \"[d]ue to the unique\n\nnature of this case and the significance of such disclosure.\"\n\nWe transferred the case to this court on our own motion.\n\n    Discussion.     1.

L. c. 4, § 7, Twenty-sixth.\n\n    Due to the broad scope of the public records law, in any\n\ncourt proceeding challenging the withholding of a requested\n\ndocument, \"there shall be a presumption that the record sought\n\nis public, and the burden shall be upon the custodian to prove\n\nwith specificity the exemption which applies.\"       G.

There is no\n\ndispute that as a general matter, the town's records, including\n\nthe records of its schools, qualify as public records.      The\n\nquestion is whether the agreements are excepted from\n\nclassification as public records because they fit within one or\n\nmore of the statute's exemptions and, in particular, exemption\n\n(a) or exemption (c), or both.\n\n    a.      Exemption (a):   exemption by statute.   The definition\n\nof public records exempts materials or data that are\n\n\"specifically or by necessary implication exempted from\n\f                                                                     9\n\n\ndisclosure by statute.\"   G. L. c. 4, § 7, Twenty-sixth (a).    In\n\nMassachusetts, the disclosure of information about public school\n\nstudents is governed in part by FERPA, and the Massachusetts\n\nstudent records law, G. L. c. 71, § 34D, and its implementing\n\nregulations, 603 Code Mass. Regs. §§ 23.00 (2006).   The\n\ndisclosure of information regarding special education students\n\nsuch as the plaintiff's daughter is further governed by the\n\nIDEA, and the Massachusetts special education law, G. L. 71B.\n\nThe motion judge concluded that the agreements did not qualify\n\nas \"education records\" under FERPA or as \"student records\" under\n\n603 Code Mass. Regs. §§ 23.00, and therefore exemption (a) did\n\nnot apply.7   The motion judge interpreted or defined both\n\n\"education records\" and \"student records\" as including only\n\ndocuments directly relating to a student's academic progress,\n\nand determined that the agreements do not fit within such a\n\ndefinition.   We conclude that the definitions of these terms\n\nadopted by the judge were too narrow.\n\n\n\n\n     7\n       The parties do not appear to have brought the Individuals\nwith Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400 et\nseq. (2012), or the Massachusetts special education law, G. L.\nc. 71B, to the attention of the motion judge. In any event, the\njudge did not mention these statutes in her memorandum of\ndecision.\n\f                                                                   10\n\n\n    i.   FERPA.

Neither FERPA nor its regulations limit the\n\ndefinition of \"education records\" to material relating to the\n\nstudent's academic progress.

This is sufficient, as a\npractical matter, to satisfy the requirement that a statute\nexempt data or information by \"necessary implication.\" G. L.\nc. 4, § 7, Twenty-sixth (a).\n\f                                                                    11\n\n\n     The agreements at issue are \"education records\" under FERPA\n\nbecause they satisfy both elements of the statutory definition.\n\nThere is no dispute that the agreements \"contain information\n\ndirectly related to a student\" -- no one disputes that they\n\ncontain the name of the student (as well as those of the\n\nstudent's parents) -- and they \"are maintained by an educational\n\nagency.\"9    In addition, the agreements may establish a student's\n\nschool placement and they appear to define, at least in part, a\n\nstudent's educational programming, two matters that fall\n\ndirectly within the ambit of academic matters and status as a\n\nstudent.    The school district maintains the agreements and keeps\n\nthe documents in the individual student's special education\n\nfile.\n\n     The fact that the agreements fall within the coverage of\n\nexemption (a) does not end the matter.     The public records law\n\nspecifically contemplates redaction of material that would be\n\nexempt, to enable the release of the remaining portions of a\n\nrecord.     G.

The\n\nanalysis to determine what redaction is necessary will be a\n\ncase-by-case determination that considers the request, the\n\nschool and the community, and the availability to the requester\n\nof other information that indirectly identifies the student.     34\n\nC.F.R. §§ 99.3, 99.31(b)(1).\n\n    ii.   Massachusetts student records law and regulations.10\n\nGeneral Laws c. 71, § 34D, provides:   \"The board of education\n\n\n    10\n       The student records statute, G. L. c. 71, § 34D, does not\nspecifically address confidentiality of student records;\nconfidentiality is dealt with in the regulations promulgated by\nthe Department of Education (department) pursuant to § 34D. See\n603 Code Mass. Regs. § 23.07 (2006). Exemption (a) refers\nspecifically to exemptions by \"statute,\" and does not mention\nregulations. The town and the plaintiff appear not to question\nthat exemption (a) may cover material that a regulation requires\nto be treated as confidential, and more particularly, they\nappear to agree that material that would constitute part of a\n\"student record\" as defined in 603 Code Mass. Regs. §§ 23.02-\n23.03 (2002) would fall within the scope of exemption (a).\nTheir disagreement is over the question whether the agreements\nqualify as \"student record[s]\" under these regulations. As\ndiscussed supra, we have concluded that exemption (a) applies in\nthis case because FERPA fits squarely within the scope of\nexemption (a) and the agreements fit within the scope of FERPA's\ndefinition of \"education records.\" Because we interpret the\ndepartment's student record regulations to treat as confidential\nthe same types of information as FERPA does, we do not need to\ndecide in the present case whether the word \"statute\" in\nexemption (a) should be interpreted to include \"regulations\" --\n\f                                                                    14\n\n\nshall adopt regulations relative to the maintenance, retention,\n\nduplication, storage and periodic destruction of student records\n\nby the public elementary and secondary schools of the\n\n[C]ommonwealth.   Such rules and regulations shall provide that a\n\nparent or guardian of any pupil shall be allowed to inspect\n\nacademic, scholastic, or any other records concerning such pupil\n\nwhich are kept or are required to be kept.\"    In compliance with\n\nthe statutory directive, the Department of Education\n\n(department) has promulgated student record regulations, 603\n\nCode Mass. Regs. §§ 23.00, directing that no third party shall\n\nhave access to information in or from a student record without\n\nthe consent of the eligible student or the parent.   603 Code\n\nMass. Regs. § 23.07(4) (2006).\n\n    The regulations define \"[s]tudent [r]ecord\" as \"the\n\n[t]ranscript and the [t]emporary [r]ecord, including all\n\ninformation . . . regardless of physical form or characteristics\n\nconcerning a student that is organized on the basis of the\n\nstudent's name or in a way that such student may be individually\n\nidentified, and that is kept by the public schools of the\n\nCommonwealth.\"    603 Code Mass. Regs. § 23.02 (2002).   It is\n\n\"limited to information relevant to the educational needs of the\n\n\n\ngenerally, or at least in this instance. Rather, we assume,\nwithout deciding, that the department's student record\nregulations fit within the meaning of \"statute\" for purposes of\nexemption (a).\n\f                                                                   15\n\n\nstudent.\"   603 Code Mass. Regs. § 23.03 (2002).   We agree with\n\nthe motion judge that the agreements do not fit within the\n\nregulation's definition of \"transcript\";11 the issue is whether\n\nthey are part of the student’s \"temporary record.\"   The\n\ntemporary record includes all information in the student record\n\nnot contained in the transcript and is generally defined as\n\n\"information clearly . . . of importance to the educational\n\nprocess.\"   603 Code Mass. Regs. § 23.02.12\n\n     The record before us, limited as it is, indicates that an\n\nagreement is likely to contain information regarding a student's\n\ndisability, progress, and needs -- information that is\n\n     11\n       The transcript \"shall contain administrative records that\nconstitute the minimum data necessary to reflect the student's\neducational progress and to operate the educational system.\nThese data shall be limited to the name, address, and phone\nnumber of the student; his/her birth date; name, address, and\nphone number of the parent or guardian; course titles, grades\n(or the equivalent when grades are not applicable), course\ncredit, highest grade level completed, and the year completed.\"\n603 Code Mass. Regs. § 23.02. Independent of this regulation,\nthe plaintiff appears to agree that insofar as the agreements\ncontain the student's name and the parents' or guardians' names,\nthis information should be redacted before the agreements are\ndisclosed.\n     12\n       The regulation further provides that \"[s]uch information\nmay include standardized test results, class rank (when\napplicable), extracurricular activities, and evaluations by\nteachers, counselors, and other school staff.\" 603 Code Mass.\nRegs. § 23.02. This is the language on which the motion judge\nrelied to conclude that the temporary record, and thus the\nstudent record, pertains to a student's academic progress. Our\nreading of the pertinent regulations as a whole, however,\npersuades us that the \"temporary record\" has a broader scope\nthan purely a measurement of academic progress.\n\f                                                                    16\n\n\nunquestionably of importance to the student's \"educational\n\nprocess,\" see 603 Code Mass. Regs. § 23.02, and \"educational\n\nneeds.\"    603 Code Mass. Regs. § 23.03.   The agreement,\n\ntherefore, qualifies as part of the student's temporary record,\n\nand therefore as part of his or her \"student record.\"       However,\n\nlike FERPA, the Massachusetts student records law and\n\nregulations protect student records only as they pertain to\n\ncertain information -- not entire documents.     See 603 Code Mass.\n\nRegs. §§ 23.02 (defining student record and temporary record as\n\n\"all information . . . concerning a student\"), § 23.07(4) (third\n\nparties shall not have access to \"information in or from a\n\nstudent record\" [emphasis added]).     Accordingly, under the\n\npublic records law, any \"segregable portion\" of the record must\n\nbe disclosed, if with the redaction it independently is a public\n\nrecord.    G. L. c. 66, § 10 (a).\n\n    iii.    Special education law.13   The agreements by definition\n\nconcern special education programs for the students to whom the\n\nagreements relate.    Both the Federal IDEA and the Massachusetts\n\nspecial education law, G. L. c. 71B, contain provisions\n\nprotecting the confidentiality of the educational records of\n\nstudents with disabilities who receive special education\n\n    13\n       As mentioned, the applicability of the Federal IDEA and\nG. L. c. 71B apparently was not raised as an issue before the\nmotion judge. See note 7, supra. We briefly consider the\nstatutes here because they appear to be directly relevant.\n\f                                                                  17\n\n\nservices.    The IDEA adopts the confidentiality standards in\n\nFERPA and incorporates FERPA's definition of \"education\n\nrecords,\" see 20 U.S.C. 1417(c),14 but its implementing\n\nregulations introduce additional procedural protections to\n\nsafeguard the confidentiality of personally identifiable\n\ninformation for students with disabilities.    See 34 C.F.R.\n\n§§ 300.561, 300.572, 300.573 (2002).    And G. L. c. 71B, § 3,\n\nunlike G. L. c. 71, § 34D, contains explicit provisions about\n\nconfidentiality of information concerning students with\n\ndisabilities.15\n\n     Nothing in these statutes suggests that records relating to\n\nstudents are confidential once all personally identifiable\n\n     14\n       \"The Secretary shall take appropriate action, in\naccordance with [FERPA], to ensure the protection of the\nconfidentiality of any personally identifiable data,\ninformation, and records collected or maintained by the\nSecretary and by State educational agencies and local\neducational agencies pursuant to this subchapter.\" 20 U.S.C.\n§ 1417(c). See 34 C.F.R. §§ 300.610, 300.611 (2006).\n     15\n          General Laws c. 71B, § 3, provides, in relevant part:\n\n     \"The written record and clinical history from both the\n     evaluation provided by the school committee and independent\n     evaluation, if any, shall be made available to the parents,\n     guardians, or persons with custody of the child. Separate\n     instructions, limited to the information required for\n     adequate care of the child, shall be distributed only to\n     those persons directly concerned with the care of the\n     child. Otherwise said records shall be confidential.\"\n\nFurther, \"[e]valuations and assessments of children and special\neducation programs shall remain confidential and be used solely\nfor the administration of special education in the\n[C]ommonwealth.\"\n\f                                                                      18\n\n\ninformation is removed.    Rather, what is confidential is certain\n\ninformation, again indicating that redaction of such information\n\nmay render the particular document a public record that must be\n\ndisclosed on request under the public records law.\n\n    b.   Exemption (c):    privacy exemption.   The statutory\n\ndefinition of public records also exempts materials or data that\n\nare \"personnel and medical files or information; also any other\n\nmaterials or data relating to a specifically named individual,\n\nthe disclosure of which may constitute an unwarranted invasion\n\nof personal privacy.\"     G. L. c. 4, § 7, Twenty-sixth (c).    The\n\ninquiry under the privacy exemption \"requires that the\n\nseriousness of any invasion of privacy be balanced against the\n\npublic right to know.\"    Attorney Gen. v.

As\n\npreviously discussed, the agreements may link the name of the\n\nindividual student (and his or her family) to information about\n\nthe services and programming the child will receive and\n\ninformation about the child's disability, progress, and needs.\n\nFurther, the agreements are likely to identify the out-of-\n\ndistrict school, which may indirectly identify the child's\n\ndisability.   This type of information is highly personal, and\n\ndisclosure may result in embarrassment and potentially lead to\n\nstigma,16 bringing it within the scope of exemption (c).\n\n     Nonetheless, like exemption (a), exemption (c) does not\n\ncover, and thereby authorizes withholding, information that does\n\n\n     16\n       When it enacted G.

Currently, c. 71B\ncalls for a flexible definition of disability \"so as to minimize\nthe possibility of stigmatization.\" G. L. c. 71B, § 2.\n\f                                                                     20\n\n\nnot permit the identification of an individual.      Globe Newspaper\n\nCo. v. Boston Retirement Bd., 388 Mass. at 438.      As with\n\nexemption (a), the pertinent inquiry is whether the deletion of\n\nparticular identifying information from the documents sought\n\nplaces the documents outside the exemption.    Id.    In assessing\n\nwhether the documents contain identifying information, the\n\ninquiry must be considered \"not only from the viewpoint of the\n\npublic, but also from the vantage of those who [are familiar\n\nwith the individual].\"   Department of the Air Force v.

The agreements here, although they\n\ncontain identifying information, also include information that\n\ndoes not appear to invade the reasonable privacy interests of\n\nstudents or their families.   Notably, once personally\n\nidentifiable information is redacted, the financial terms of\n\nsuch agreements, which necessarily reflect the use of public\n\nmonies, partially or fully, to pay for out-of-district\n\nplacements, do not constitute an unwarranted invasion of\n\npersonal privacy; indeed, the public has a right to know the\n\nfinancial terms of these agreements.   See Collector of Lynn, 377\n\nMass. at 158.17   As is true with exemption (a), once the\n\n\n     17\n       The school district argues that the line item in its\nbudget that identifies the amount the district spends on out-of-\nschool placements is sufficient to serve the purpose for which\nthe plaintiff appears to want disclosure of the agreements, and\ntherefore public access to the agreements is not necessary.\nThis argument fails. The school district does not meet its\n\f                                                                   21\n\n\nappropriate redactions of personally identifiable information\n\nare made, the agreements will no longer fit within the scope of\n\nexemption (c) and must be disclosed.\n\n     c.   Confidentiality clause.   Finally, the school district\n\ncontends that the inclusion of a confidentiality clause in each\n\nof the agreements (other than the plaintiff's agreement) further\n\nprohibits their disclosure.18   The school district is incorrect.\n\nAlthough the agreement may have served as a private settlement\n\nof a dispute between the school district and one of the families\n\nliving in the school district, the fact that the school district\n\nand the family contractually agreed to keep the settlement\n\nprivate cannot, by itself, trump the public records law and the\n\nschool district's obligation to comply with the law's\n\n\n\n\nobligations with respect to the public records law by pointing\nout that the requester may be able to obtain some of the\ninformation from another source.

We have concluded\n\nthat both exemption (a) and exemption (c) to the definition of\n\npublic records in G. L. c. 4, § 7, Twenty-sixth, apply to the\n\nagreements, but that personally identifying information in the\n\nagreements is subject to redaction, and when the agreements are\n\nproperly redacted, they must be disclosed.     The facts are too\n\nundeveloped in the record before us to make a determination\n\nregarding the necessary and appropriate redactions of personally\n\nidentifying information to be made; a remand of this case to the\n\n\n\n     19\n       This is not to say that every contractual agreement\nbetween a municipality or other public agency and a private\nparty that contains a confidentiality clause is subject to\ndisclosure as a public record; one of the statutory exemptions\nunder G. L. c. 4, § 7, Twenty-sixth, may apply to the agreement.\n\f                                                                  23\n\n\nSuperior Court is necessary to permit this to be accomplished.\n\nSee Georgiou v.
