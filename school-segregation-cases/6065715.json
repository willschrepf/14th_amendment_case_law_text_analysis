Ogle.\n\nMandy M. Hancock, Knoxville, Tennessee, for the appellee, Julie D. Duff.\n\n                                       OPINION\n\n                       FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n      Jimmy D. Ogle (“Husband”) and Julie D. Duff (“Wife”) were married on April 30,\n2006. After five and one-half years, Husband filed for divorce on the grounds of\ninappropriate marital conduct and irreconcilable differences. Wife filed an answer and\n\fcounter-complaint for divorce based on the same grounds. At the time of trial, Husband\nwas fifty-eight years old and Wife was forty-five years old. Wife worked for the Lenoir\nCity Schools as a school teacher. Husband was a self-employed surveyor. This was the\nsecond marriage for both parties, and Wife had two minor children from her previous\nmarriage.\n\n       Throughout the entirety of the marriage, the parties maintained separate accounts\nfor their earnings. At trial, Wife testified that she deposited her earnings into her separate\nbank account. Husband identified six separate bank accounts he used during the\nmarriage: (1) business account, (2) line of credit, (3) personal checking, (4) farm\naccount, (5) Duff-Turner account, and (6) savings account. He testified that he usually\ndeposited his earnings into the business account but occasionally deposited his earnings\ninto the line of credit account. During the marriage, Wife wrote Husband several checks\nfrom her separate account to pay for utilities and other household expenses. After\nHusband received these checks, he would deposit the funds into one of his several\naccounts and often transferred the money between the various accounts.\n\n       At the time of the marriage, Husband held three individual retirement accounts\n(“IRAs”): (1) Fidelity account (“Fidelity Primary IRA”) with a value of $118,412.39, (2)\nState Farm account ending in -3452 with a value of $3,373.75, and (3) State Farm\naccount ending in -3833 with a value of $4,568.42. On August 22, 2012, Husband rolled\nthe entire $4,011.60 balance of the State Farm account ending in -3452 into the Fidelity\nPrimary IRA account. The Fidelity Primary IRA account was valued at $181,628.32 at\nthe time of divorce.\n\n       Prior to the marriage, Husband owned a lakeside residence referred to as “the\nTanasi Shores property.” Early in the marriage, Husband purchased a 50-acre lot and a\nseparate 5.5 acre lot in White County. On July 14, 2009, Husband created the Jimmy D.\nOgle Revocable Trust (“Trust”) as both settlor and trustee. Husband transferred the\nTanasi Shores and White County properties into the Trust. Wife signed warranty deeds\nfor these properties whereby she conveyed all marital interest she had in the properties to\nHusband as trustee of the Trust. In the Trust, Husband designated Wife and her children\nas beneficiaries of the Trust and named Wife as successor trustee. Contemporaneously\nwith creation of the Trust, Husband executed a Last Will and Testament that directed that\nall other assets be placed in the Trust upon his death. After creation of the Trust,\nHusband, as trustee, purchased what is referred to as the Duff-Turner property. The trust\nagreement contains no provision regarding Wife’s marital interest in property acquired\nfollowing creation of the Trust.\n\n       On July 17, 2012, Husband filed a motion requesting that the trial court determine\nwhat effect the Trust had on the classification of marital property. Husband argued that\nthe Trust was created pursuant to a postnuptial agreement between the parties. The trial\ncourt found there was not sufficient mutual assent between Husband and Wife to form an\n\n                                            -2-\n\fenforceable postnuptial agreement. The trial court, therefore, divested the Trust of titles\nto all properties transferred into the Trust and revested the titles in the names of the\nparties as they existed prior to creation of the Trust. The trial court entered an order and\njudgment on November 3, 2014 granting the parties a divorce on stipulated grounds\npursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-4-1291 and reserved the issue of dividing the marital\nestate. Following trial on the issue of property division, the trial court entered a final\norder on June 1, 2016 dividing the marital estate into equal shares between both parties.\n\n       Husband has now perfected this appeal and raises the following issues: (1)\nwhether the trial court erred in divesting the Trust of all assets and refusing to enforce the\nvalid postnuptial agreement; (2) whether the trial court erred in classifying the increase in\nvalue of Husband’s separate property on Lot 28 Tanasi Shores and the increase in value\nof the Fidelity Primary IRA as marital property; and (3) whether the trial court erred in\ndividing the marital estate into equal shares in light of the short duration of the marriage.\n\n                                          STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n       We review a trial court’s findings of fact de novo with a presumption of\ncorrectness unless the evidence preponderates otherwise. TENN. R. APP. P. 13(d); Church\nv. Church, 346 S.W.3d 474, 481 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2010). A trial court’s conclusions of\nlaw are reviewed de novo with no presumption of correctness. Whaley v. Perkins, 197\nS.W.3d 665, 670 (Tenn. 2006). Because a trial court is in a position to observe a\nwitness’s demeanor as he or she testifies, a trial court is “accorded significant deference\nin resolving factual disputes when the credibility of the witnesses is of paramount\nimportance.” Davis v. Davis, 223 S.W.3d 233, 238 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2006) (citing Wells v.\nTenn. Bd. of Regents, 9 S.W.3d 779, 783 (Tenn. 1999)). We will not re-evaluate a trial\ncourt’s credibility determinations “‘absent clear and convincing evidence to the\ncontrary.’” Id. (quoting Wells, 9 S.W.3d at 783).\n\n                                                 ANALYSIS\n\n                                    Jimmy D. Ogle Revocable Trust\n\n       Husband first takes issue with the trial court divesting the Trust of all assets and\nrevesting titles to those assets in the names of the parties as they existed prior to creation\n\n1\n    Tennessee Code Annotated section 36-4-129 provides as follows:\n          (a) In all actions for divorce from the bonds of matrimony or legal separation the parties\n          may stipulate as to grounds and/or defenses.\n          (b) The court may, upon stipulation to or proof of any ground of divorce pursuant to § 36-\n          4-101, grant a divorce to the party who was less at fault or, if either or both parties are\n          entitled to a divorce or if a divorce is to be granted on the grounds of irreconcilable\n          differences, declare the parties to be divorced, rather than awarding a divorce to either\n          party alone.\n                                                     -3-\n\fof the Trust. Husband argues that the trust documents and accompanying warranty deeds\nconstitute a valid postnuptial agreement and the trial court erred by refusing to evaluate\nthese documents in light of the factors set forth in Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-3-501.2\n\n       Spouses or prospective spouses may enter into various types of agreements,\nincluding antenuptial agreements, reconciliation agreements, and postnuptial agreements.\nBratton v. Bratton, 136 S.W.3d 595, 599 (Tenn. 2004). Prospective spouses execute\nantenuptial agreements “in contemplation of marriage,” whereas reconciliation\nagreements and postnuptial agreements are entered into by spouses after marriage. Id.\nSpouses execute reconciliation agreements after a separation or the filing of a complaint\nfor divorce. See Atkins v. Atkins, 105 S.W.3d 591, 594 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2002) (stating\nthat “[a] reconciliation agreement . . . is executed following a separation during a\nmarriage.”); Minor v. Minor, 863 S.W.2d 51, 53 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1993) (involving a\nhusband and wife who executed a reconciliation agreement after being separated and\ncontemplating divorce); Gilley v. Gilley, 778 S.W.2d 862, 863 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1989)\n(involving a husband and wife who entered into a reconciliation agreement after the wife\nfiled for divorce). Postnuptial agreements, on the other hand, “are entered into before\nmarital problems arise.” Bratton, 136 S.W.3d at 599. Because postnuptial agreements\nare similar in nature to reconciliation agreements and antenuptial agreements, courts\ngenerally apply the same principles in interpreting them. In re Estate of Wiseman, 889\nS.W.2d 215, 217 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1994); see also Bratton, 136 S.W.3d at 600. “That is to\nsay, [postnuptial agreements] should be interpreted and enforced as any other contract.”\nBratton, 136 S.W.3d at 600.\n\n       Contract interpretation presents a question of law. Atkins, 105 S.W.3d at 594.\nConsequently, we review the trial court’s judgment de novo with no presumption of\ncorrectness. Id. A tenet of contract law is that contracts “can be express, implied,\nwritten, or oral[.]” Thompson v. Hensley, 136 S.W.3d 925, 929-30 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2003)\n(citing Klosterman Dev. Corp. v. Outlaw Aircraft Sales, Inc., 102 S.W.3d 621, 635\n(Tenn. Ct. App. 2002)). Valid, enforceable contracts require a meeting of the minds,\nadequate consideration, and sufficient definiteness to be enforced. Ace Design Grp., Inc.\nv. Greater Christ Temple Church, Inc., No. M2016-00089-COA-R3-CV, 2016 WL\n7166408, at *7 (Tenn. Ct. App. Dec. 8, 2016). We have explained the meeting of the\nminds requirement as follows:\n\n2\n    Tennessee Code Annotated section 36-3-501 provides:\n          Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, except as provided in § 36-3-502, any\n          antenuptial or prenuptial agreement entered into by spouses concerning property owned\n          by either spouse before the marriage that is the subject of such agreement shall be\n          binding upon any court having jurisdiction over such spouses and/or such agreement if\n          such agreement is determined, in the discretion of such court, to have been entered into\n          by such spouses freely, knowledgeably and in good faith and without exertion of duress\n          or undue influence upon either spouse. The terms of such agreement shall be enforceable\n          by all remedies available for enforcement of contract terms.\n                                                   -4-\n\f           “Under general principles of contract law, a contract must result from a\n           meeting of the minds of the parties in mutual assent to the terms.” Sweeten\n           v. Trade Envelopes, Inc., 938 S.W.2d 383, 386 (Tenn. 1996) (citation\n           omitted). “[T]he meeting of the minds . . . [is] to be determined . . . not\n           alone from the words used, but also the situation, acts, and the conduct of\n           the parties, and the attendant circumstances.” [Moody Realty Co., Inc. v.]\n           Huestis, 237 S.W.3d [666, 675 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2007)]. “Courts determine\n           mutuality of assent by assessing the parties’ manifestations according to an\n           objective standard.” Id. at 674.\n\nIn re Estate of Josephson, No. M2011-01792-COA-R3-CV, 2012 WL 3984613, at *2\n(Tenn. Ct. App. Sept. 11, 2012). Thus, there must be mutual assent to a contract in order\nfor the contracting parties to have a meeting of the minds. See Ace Design Group, Inc.,\n2016 WL 7166408, at *7. If there is insufficient mutual assent, no contract exists.\nWofford v. M.J. Edwards & Sons Funeral Home, Inc., 490 S.W.3d 800, 810 (Tenn. Ct.\nApp. 2015) (citing Allstate Ins. Co. v. Tarrant, 363 S.W.3d 508, 528 (Tenn. 2012)).\n\n       The trial court determined that no valid postnuptial agreement existed in this case\nbecause the court found “there was insufficient mutual assent between the parties” to\nform an oral contract. In making its determination, the trial court considered the\ntranscript of an oral conversation between the parties. At some time after the marriage,\nbut before executing the trust documents, Husband and Wife discussed the creation of the\nTrust. Wife recorded this conversation and introduced a transcript of the recording as an\nexhibit at the hearing on Husband’s motion. At the beginning of the transcript, the\nparties were discussing issues of distrust with each other and agreeing they intended to\nremain married. The discussion then turned to creation of the Trust to protect Husband’s\npersonal assets from potential lawsuits connected to his land survey business and to\nbequeath all Trust properties to Wife and her children in the event of Husband’s death, if\nshe survived him. The transcript does not indicate, however, that the parties discussed\nseparation or divorce issues related to the division of the real properties transferred into\nthe Trust.3\n\n       In addition to the transcript of the parties’ conversation, both parties testified at the\nhearing on Husband’s motion regarding the effect of the Trust on the classification of the\nproperty at issue. The record on appeal contains no transcript from the motion hearing.\nHowever, the record does contain a transcript from the trial on the issue of property\ndivision where both parties testified regarding the circumstances surrounding the creation\nof the Trust. Husband testified that the Trust was created “to protect [his] assets in case\nof a divorce.” He further testified that he did not present Wife with a postnuptial\nagreement because he did not think “she would have signed a post-nuptial agreement just\ngiving away any rights afterwards.” Wife testified that she signed the trust agreement\n\n3\n    Several sections of the transcript indicate that the recording was inaudible.\n                                                       -5-\n\fand accompanying warranty deeds but did not know that she was conveying any marital\ninterest she might have had in the real properties. Wife further testified that had she\nknown she was conveying such interest, she would not have signed the documents.\nAccording to Wife, she signed the documents because she “took [Husband] at his word”\nand believed the Trust was created to protect Husband’s personal assets from potential\nlawsuits from third parties. An examination of the transcript of the recorded conversation\nin conjunction with the testimony of the parties shows that the parties held different\nunderstandings about the purpose of the Trust. Thus, there was insufficient mutual assent\nfor the parties to have a meeting of the minds. We conclude, therefore, that the trial court\nappropriately determined that there was not an enforceable oral postnuptial agreement.\n\n        Husband argues that the trust documents and accompanying warranty deeds\nconstitute a written postnuptial agreement and the trial court erred by not considering\nthese documents for what they state in clear and unambiguous terms and in accordance\nwith Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-3-501. We disagree. Wife signed the warranty deeds for the\nTanasi Shores and White County properties. The warranty deeds contain the following\nprovision after the description of each parcel of real property: “JULIE R. DUFF-OGLE\nexecutes this Warranty Deed to convey all marital interest she may hold in the above\ndescribed property.” Wife testified that she was unaware that the warranty deeds\ncontained this provision. As Husband correctly asserts, “[i]t is a bedrock principle of\ncontract law that an individual who signs a contract is presumed to have read the contract\nand is bound by its contents.” 84 Lumber Co. v. Smith, 356 S.W.3d 380, 383 (Tenn.\n2011). When a court interprets a contract, however, “the court must attempt to ascertain\nand give effect to the intention of the parties.” Simonton v. Huff, 60 S.W.3d 820, 825\n(Tenn. Ct. App. 2000). When a court attempts to determine the parties’ intention, a court\nmust:\n\n       [E]xamine the language of the contract, giving each word its usual, natural,\n       and ordinary meaning. Additionally, the court may consider the situation\n       of the parties, the business to which the contract relates, the subject matter\n       of the contract, the circumstances surrounding the transaction, and the\n       construction placed on the contract by the parties in carrying out its terms.\n\nId. (citations omitted) (emphasis added). The parties must also have a meeting of the\nminds. See Id. at 825-26.\n\n       In order for an enforceable written postnuptial agreement to exist in the current\ncase, Husband and Wife must have had a meeting of the minds regarding creation of the\nTrust as a postnuptial agreement. The trust documents neither reference a postnuptial\nagreement nor do they discuss divorce and separation issues pertaining to the division of\nthe real properties transferred into the Trust. The trust agreement appoints Husband as\nthe sole trustee and grants him the power to pay himself, or pay for his benefit, “as much\nof the net income and principal from the Trust as [he] shall request.” Husband also has\n\n                                           -6-\n\fthe power, as trustee, to dispose of, by sale or other means, any properties transferred into\nthe Trust. Thus, there is no guarantee that any assets would remain in the Trust until\nHusband’s death because he could have, as the trial court found, “done away with all\nassets of the Trust and attempted to take possession of the Trust property or proceeds and\ntransferred them to himself in his individual capacity.” The record does not reflect that\nthe parties discussed or considered this possibility before Husband created the Trust. In\nlight of these facts and the parties’ differing views of the purpose of the Trust discussed\nabove, there was insufficient mutual assent to form a contract.\n\n        After a thorough examination of the record, we conclude that there was no\nmeeting of the minds to form an enforceable oral or written postnuptial agreement and\nthe trial court did not err by divesting the Trust of all assets and revesting titles in the\nnames of the parties as they existed prior to Husband’s creation of the Trust. Because the\ntrust documents and warranty deeds fail to meet the requirements of an enforceable\ncontract, we do not find it necessary to examine them in light of Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-3-\n501.\n\n                               Classification of the Marital Property\n\n       We turn now to the trial court’s classification of the increase in value of two assets\nas marital property. Husband asserts that the trial court erred by classifying the increase\nin value of the Lot 28 Tanasi Shores property and the increase in value of the Fidelity\nPrimary IRA account as marital property.\n\n        Before dividing a marital estate, a trial court must identify all property interests at\nissue and classify each property interest as either separate or marital property. Summer v.\nSummer, 296 S.W.3d 57, 60 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2008). Classification of the property\ninterests is an essential step because only marital property is subject to division in a\ndivorce action. Id.; see also Smith v. Smith, 93 S.W.3d 871, 876 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2002).\nTennessee Code Annotated section 36-4-121(b)(2) defines separate property, in pertinent\npart, as follows:\n\n       (A) All real and personal property owned by a spouse before marriage,\n       including, but not limited to, assets held in individual retirement accounts\n       (IRAs) . . . ;\n\n       (B) Property acquired in exchange for property acquired before the\n       marriage;\n\n       (C) Income from and appreciation of property owned by a spouse before\n       marriage except when characterized as marital property under subdivision\n       (b)(1).\n\n\n                                             -7-\n\fMarital property, by contrast, is defined, in pertinent part, as follows:\n\n        (A) [A]ll real and personal property, both tangible and intangible, acquired\n        by either or both spouses during the course of the marriage up to the date of\n        the final divorce hearing and owned by either or both spouses as of the date\n        of filing of a complaint for divorce . . . .\n\n        (B)(i) [I]ncome from, and any increase in value during the marriage of,\n        property determined to be separate property in accordance with subdivision\n        (b)(2) if each party substantially contributed to its preservation and\n        appreciation;\n\n        (ii) [T]he value of vested and unvested pension, vested and unvested stock\n        option rights, retirement and other fringe benefit rights accrued as a result\n        of employment during the marriage[.]\n\nTenn. Code Ann. § 36-4-121(b)(1).\n\n       Classification determinations present questions of fact. Woodward v. Woodward,\n240 S.W.3d 825, 828 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2007). Accordingly, a trial court’s classification of\nproperty as either separate or marital will not be disturbed unless it is not supported by a\npreponderance of the evidence. Id.\n\n        A. Lot 28 Tanasi Shores\n\n        Husband purchased Lot 28 in the Tanasi Shores subdivision on November 6, 1996,\nbefore he married Wife. Thereafter, he built a home on the property. At the time of the\nmarriage, there were no debts encumbering the property. The parties treated the property\nas their marital residence throughout the marriage. The trial court classified the marital\nresidence as Husband’s separate property and assigned it a value of $739,400 as of May\n1, 2006.4 The trial court classified the increase in value of the property, which the court\nvalued at $125,250, as marital property because Wife made intangible contributions of\nlabor and tangible financial contributions that “substantially contributed to the\npreservation and appreciation of the marital home.” The trial court awarded the Tanasi\nShores property to Husband and awarded Wife $94,106.29 as her equitable division share\nof the increase in value of the property.\n\n\n\n4\n  At trial, Husband’s expert testified that the Tanasi Shores property was valued at $835,000 as of May 1,\n2006. Wife presented tax assessment records valuing the property at $643,800 for 2005-2008. “When\nvaluation evidence is conflicting, the court may place a value on the property that is within the range of\nthe values represented by all the relevant valuation evidence.” Owens v. Owens, 241 S.W.3d 478, 486\n(Tenn. Ct. App. 2007).\n                                                  -8-\n\f       If property classified as separate property increases in value during the marriage\nand “each party substantially contributed to its preservation and appreciation,” the\nappreciation will be considered marital property.             Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-4-\n121(b)(1)(B)(i); Keyt v. Keyt, 244 S.W.3d 321, 328-29 (Tenn. 2007). The Supreme Court\nhas stated the following in regard to the contributions of a non-owner spouse:\n\n        While these contributions may be either “direct” or “indirect,” Tenn. Code\n        Ann. § 36-4-121(b)(1)(D), they must satisfy two requirements. McFarland\n        v. McFarland, No. M2005-01260-COA-R3-CV, 2007 WL 2254576, at *6\n        (Tenn. Ct. App. Aug. 6, 2007). First, the contributions must be “real and\n        significant.” Id.; Brown [v. Brown], 913 S.W.2d [163, 167 (Tenn. Ct. App.\n        1994)]. “Second, there must be some link between the spouses’\n        contributions and the appreciation in the value of the separate property.”\n        McFarland, 2007 WL 2254576, at *6; Langschmidt [v. Langschmidt], 81\n        S.W.3d [741,746 (Tenn. 2003)]. Whether a spouse made a “substantial\n        contribution” to the preservation and appreciation of separate property is a\n        question of fact. Sherrill v. Sherrill, 831 S.W.2d 293, 295 (Tenn. Ct. App.\n        1992).\n\nKeyt, 244 S.W.3d at 329.\n\n       In the current case, Husband testified that improvements were made to the marital\nresidence, such as adding walls and flooring in the basement and new flooring in the\nmaster bathroom. Wife testified that she gave Husband $55,635.92, the net proceeds she\nreceived from the sale of her premarital property, to pay for the improvements to the\nmarital residence. Husband testified that Wife gave him the $55,635.92 as repayment for\nexpenditures Husband made to Wife’s premarital property for Wife’s benefit prior to the\nsale thereof. The trial court, however, found “Husband’s entire testimony concerning all\nmonetary matters existing prior [to] and during the marriage to be highly suspect and\nlacking in credibility” and considered the $55,635.92 as a financial contribution made by\nWife towards the preservation and appreciation of the marital home. The record contains\nno evidence, other than Husband’s testimony, that an agreement existed between the\nparties for Wife to repay Husband for expenditures he made on her behalf pending sale of\nher premarital property. Furthermore, evidence in the record does not contradict the trial\ncourt’s assessment of Husband’s credibility.5 We, therefore, defer to the trial court’s\nassessment of Husband’s credibility and will consider the $55,635.92 as Wife’s financial\n\n5\n  In addition to evidence regarding the marital residence, Husband testified that he sold his separate real\nproperty located in Sevier County, Tennessee on August 18, 2008, and used the $35,268.41 in proceeds\nfrom this sale to fund the purchase of property for the Trust, referred to as the Duff-Turner property on\nDecember 2, 2010. However, bank account statements introduced at trial reveal that Husband had\ndepleted these funds prior to purchasing the Duff-Turner property. Additionally, Husband claimed that\nWife did not contribute to the purchase of a jet ski the parties acquired during the marriage. Wife\nintroduced bank statements showing she paid $3,062.69 towards the jet ski.\n                                                   -9-\n\fcontribution towards improvements to the marital home. In light of this financial\ncontribution by Wife, we conclude that the evidence preponderates in favor of the trial\ncourt’s finding that Wife substantially contributed to the preservation and appreciation of\nthe marital residence. The trial court’s classification of the appreciation in value of Lot\n28 Tanasi Shores as marital property is affirmed.\n\n       B. Fidelity Primary IRA\n\n        Husband created three IRAs prior to the marriage. One of these IRAs was the\nFidelity Primary IRA. At the time of the marriage, the Fidelity Primary IRA contained\n$118,412.39. The account had a value of $181,628.30 at the time of trial. The trial court\nclassified the entire appreciation value of $63,215.91 as marital property and awarded the\nfull amount to Husband. On appeal, Husband argues that the trial court erred by\nclassifying the increase in value of the Fidelity Primary IRA as marital property because\nno contributions were made to the IRA during the marriage and Wife did not\nsubstantially contribute to the preservation and appreciation of the Fidelity Primary IRA.\n\n       In support of his argument, Husband relies on the case Langschmidt v.\nLangschmidt, 81 S.W.3d 741 (Tenn. 2002). In Langschmidt, the husband had two\npremarital IRAs. Id. at 743. The husband made no contributions to the premarital IRAs\nduring the marriage. Id. The trial court determined that, “according to the language of\nTenn. Code Ann. § 36-4-121(b)(1)(B), any appreciation in value of the parties’ IRAs\nduring the marriage was marital property subject to equitable division.” Id. at 744. On\nappeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court’s classification of the appreciation in\nvalue of Husband’s separate IRAs as marital property because the court concluded the\nhusband’s IRAs constituted retirement benefits within the meaning of Tenn. Code Ann.\n§ 36-4-121(b)(1)(B). Id. The Supreme Court reversed the trial court’s classification of\nthe appreciation of the IRAs as marital property. Id. at 751. The Supreme Court began\nits examination of the issue by stating that “[r]etirement benefits accrued during the\nmarriage clearly are marital property under Tennessee law.” Id. at 749 (citing Tenn.\nCode Ann. § 36-4-121(b)(1)(B); Gragg v. Gragg, 12 S.W.3d 412 (Tenn. 2000); Cohen v.\nCohen, 937 S.W.2d 823 (Tenn. 1996)). The Court determined, however, that the\npremarital IRAs at issue “were not retirement benefits under Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-4-\n121(b)(1)(B)” because they did not “represent deferred compensation during the\nmarriage” due to the fact that the IRAs were funded with the husband’s premarital\nearnings. Id. at 749. Because the husband owned these IRAs prior to the marriage and\nfunded them with premarital assets, the court concluded that they were the husband’s\nseparate property. Id. at 750.\n\n       According to the Court in Langschmidt, both parties must have “‘substantially\ncontributed to [the IRAs’] preservation and appreciation’” in order to classify the IRAs’\nappreciation in value during the marriage as marital property. Id. (quoting Tenn. Code\nAnn. § 36-4-121(b)(1)(B), -121(b)(2)(C)). The Court required some nexus between the\n\n                                           - 10 -\n\fwife’s marital contributions and the appreciation in value of the husband’s separate\nproperty in order to find that the wife made a substantial contribution. Id. The\nLangschmidt Court concluded that the appreciation in value of the IRAs was the\nhusband’s separate property because the record failed to show that the wife substantially\ncontributed to the appreciation and preservation of the IRAs due to a lack of connection\nbetween her marital contributions and the appreciation. Id.\n\n        In the current case, as in Langschmidt, Husband owned the Fidelity Primary IRA\nprior to the marriage and funded it with premarital assets. Therefore, the Fidelity Primary\nIRA was Husband’s separate property under Tenn. Code. Ann. § 36-4-121(b)(2)(A).\nUnder the reasoning of Langschmidt, the appreciation in value of the Fidelity Primary\nIRA would become marital property if Wife substantially contributed to its preservation\nand appreciation. The record before us fails to support such a conclusion. Wife testified\nthat she had no involvement with the management of the Fidelity Primary IRA.\nExamination of the record shows that Wife’s involvement with the Fidelity Primary IRA\nwas limited to Husband showing Wife the account statements to inform her of how the\naccount’s balance fluctuated due to market factors. The record contains no evidence\nestablishing a nexus between Wife’s marital contributions to household expenses and the\nappreciation in value of the Fidelity Primary IRA. Thus, we conclude Wife did not\nsubstantially contribute to the preservation and appreciation of Husband’s separate\nproperty.\n\n       Although the appreciation in value of the Fidelity Primary IRA did not become\nmarital property due to Wife’s substantial contributions, it may have become marital\nproperty under the doctrine of commingling if Husband contributed marital funds to the\naccount during the marriage. With regard to the doctrine of commingling, the\nLangschmidt Court adopted the following principles: “‘[S]eparate property becomes\nmartial property [by commingling] if inextricably mingled with marital property or with\nthe separate property of the other spouse. If the separate property continues to be\nsegregated or can be traced into its product, commingling does not occur . . . .”\nLangschmidt, 81 S.W.3d at 747 (quoting 2 Homer H. Clark, THE LAW OF DOMESTIC\nRELATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES § 16.2 at 185 (2d ed. 1987)).\n\n       In this case, the trial court classified the appreciation in value of the Fidelity\nPrimary IRA as marital property because the court found that Husband contributed to the\naccount during the marriage. The record, however, does not support such a conclusion.\nThe record contains a check written by Husband on February 5, 2007 to Fidelity\nInvestments for $5,000 and a corresponding deposit slip for the Fidelity Primary IRA.\nHusband wrote the check from his business account, which the trial court classified as\nmarital property. Husband argued at trial, and on appeal, that the check was deposited\ninto the Fidelity Primary IRA by mistake and the funds were re-routed to his Fidelity\n\n\n\n                                          - 11 -\n\fSEP-IRA.6 The record also contains a check written by Husband from his business\naccount for $5,000 on March 27, 2007 and a corresponding deposit slip for the Fidelity\nSEP-IRA. Additionally, the record includes account statements for both the Fidelity\nPrimary IRA and the SEP-IRA for the year 2007. The account statement for the Fidelity\nPrimary IRA shows that no contributions were made to the account for that year. The\naccount statement for the SEP-IRA, by contrast, shows that Husband contributed $10,000\nto that account in 2007. Thus, evidence in the record shows that the check written on\nFebruary 7, 2007 was not a contribution to the Fidelity Primary IRA, but rather a\ncontribution to the SEP-IRA. Examination of the record shows that the only contribution\nHusband made to the Fidelity Primary IRA during the marriage was when he rolled his\npremarital State Farm IRA into the Fidelity Primary IRA. The record contains no\nevidence that Husband contributed to the State Farm IRA prior to rolling it over into the\nFidelity Primary IRA. Thus, Husband did not commingle separate and marital funds with\nregard to the Fidelity Primary IRA.\n\n        We conclude that the trial court erred when it classified the appreciation in value\nof the Fidelity Primary IRA as marital property. Accordingly, some adjustments must be\nmade to the trial court’s division of the marital estate. The trial court awarded each party\nfifty percent of all marital property. The trial court valued the appreciation of the marital\nresidence at $125,250 and awarded Wife $94,106.29 as her equitable share of the\nappreciation. She received more than fifty percent of the increase in value of the marital\nresidence because the trial court awarded Husband the entire $63,215.91 increase in value\nof the Fidelity Primary IRA. Therefore, Wife’s interest in the appreciation of the Tanasi\nShores property should be reduced to $62,625.00 (a fifty percent share of $125,250).\n\n                                    Equitable Distribution of Marital Assets\n\n       Husband next takes issue with the trial court’s division of the marital estate.\nHusband argues that the trial court erred by dividing the marital estate equally between\nthe parties because the trial court failed to give proper weight to what Husband considers\nthe most important factors in this case: the relatively short duration of the marriage and\neach spouse’s contribution to the accumulation of assets during the marriage.\n\n       After a trial court has classified the parties’ marital property, the court must\nequitably divide the marital assets. Fox v. Fox, No. M2004-02616-COA-R3-CV, 2006\nWL 2535407, at *7 (Tenn. Ct. App. Sept. 1, 2006). An equitable division does not\nrequire that each party receive an equal share of the marital estate or that both parties\nreceive a share of each marital asset. Id. The factors enumerated in Tenn. Code Ann.\n§ 36-4-121(c) guide a trial court in determining how to equitably divide marital property.\nA trial court does not merely apply these factors in a mechanical fashion when dividing\nmarital assets. Id. at *8. On the contrary, a trial court considers and weighs “the most\n\n6\n    Husband created the SEP-IRA during the marriage. The trial court classified it as marital property.\n                                                    - 12 -\n\frelevant factors in light of the unique facts of the case.” Batson v. Batson, 769 S.W.2d\n849, 859 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1988). A trial court, therefore, is granted considerable\ndiscretion in how it decides to equitably divide marital property. Fox, 2006 WL\n2535407, at *8. We will defer to the trial court’s decision concerning property division\nunless the decision is not consistent with the factors found in Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-4-\n121(c) or the evidence preponderates otherwise. Brown, 913 S.W.2d at 168.\n\n       One of the factors a trial court is permitted to consider is “[t]he duration of the\nmarriage[.]” Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-4-121(c)(1). If a case involves a marriage of short\nduration, “it is appropriate to divide the property in a way that, as nearly as possible,\nplaces the parties in the same position they would have been in had the marriage never\ntaken place.” Batson, 769 S.W.2d at 859. In such cases, it is important for a court to\nconsider the contributions made by each spouse “to the accumulation of assets during the\nmarriage[.]” Id. Additionally, a marriage of short duration diminishes the significance\nand value of the non-monetary contributions made by a spouse, and “claims by one\nspouse to another spouse’s separate property are minimal at best.” Id.\n\n       Husband argues that the trial court should have restored the parties to the position\nthey were in prior to the marriage because this was a marriage of short duration. In\nsupport of his argument, Husband relies on the case Lewis v. Frances, No. M1998-\n00946-COA-R3-CV, 2001 WL 219662 (Tenn. Ct. App. Mar. 7, 2001). Lewis involved a\nshort-term marriage between parties who entered the marriage with a large discrepancy in\nassets. Lewis, 2001 WL 219662, at *1. The wife filed a petition for divorce after twenty-\nthree months of marriage. Id. She had a pre-marital estate that was approximately fifty\ntimes greater than that of the husband. Id. The parties filed separate tax returns and\nmaintained separate financial accounts throughout the marriage. Id. Moreover, the\nparties never owned any property jointly. Id. The evidence established that an agreement\nexisted between the parties to keep their assets segregated. Id. at *9. The husband\nargued that the wife’s separate property had been converted into marital property under\nthe doctrine of commingling and that he should have received an equal share of the\nmarital estate. Id. at *1, *8. The Lewis court determined that no commingling occurred.\nId. at *9. The court also determined that the husband made few contributions to the\nmarriage, either monetary or non-monetary. Id. at *3. As a result, the Lewis court\nconcluded “that the parties should, in large measure, be restored to their pre-marriage\nfinancial condition.” Id.at *10.\n\n          Husband argues that the current case is similar to Lewis because it also involves\na short-term marriage and a disparity in premarital assets. See Stewart v. Stewart, No.\n02A01-9106-CH-119, 1992 WL 70927, at *4 (Tenn. Ct. App. Apr. 10, 1992) (implicitly\nfinding that a marriage of almost nine years constituted a marriage of short duration).\nThis case, however, is distinguishable from Lewis. At trial, Husband testified that he\nentered the marriage with approximately $1,300,000 in assets. Husband also provided a\nlist of his premarital assets and their estimated values. Examination of the evidence\n\n                                          - 13 -\n\fshows that Wife entered the marriage with approximately $100,000 in assets. This\ndisparity in assets falls far short of the disparity found in Lewis. Moreover, Husband\ntestified on cross-examination that he entered the marriage with a $33,000 debt he owed\nthe Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”). Husband further testified that he satisfied this debt\nduring the marriage. Our examination of the record shows that, when Husband listed his\npremarital assets and their values he failed to account for the debt owed to the IRS. In\naddition, the document Husband introduced at trial detailing his claimed premarital assets\nlists $95,000 in cash as a premarital asset. He testified that he inherited this money from\nhis father and kept it in a safe located in the marital home. Husband provided no\nevidence of the existence of this $95,000 other than the list of premarital assets he\nprepared and his testimony, which the trial court did not find credible. Thus, the\nevidence in the record fails to substantiate Husband’s claim that he entered the marriage\nwith $1,300,000 in assets.\n\n         Husband further argues that the current case is similar to Lewis because the\nparties maintained separate financial accounts. In Lewis, “the uncontroverted evidence”\nestablished the existence of an agreement between the parties, both prior to and during\nthe marriage, that their assets would remain separate. Id. at *9. In the current case, the\nparties dispute the reason they maintained separate financial accounts. At trial, Husband\ntestified that the parties maintained separate accounts because they agreed that Wife’s\nearnings would be her property and Husband’s earnings would be his property. Wife, on\nthe other hand, testified that the parties maintained separate accounts because Husband\nowed the IRS $33,000 at the time of the marriage. The trial court found Wife’s testimony\nmore credible than that of Husband. Thus, the trial court classified the parties’ earnings\nduring the marriage as marital property. In addition, the record in this case, unlike the\nrecord in Lewis, contains evidence that Husband commingled his separate funds with\nmarital funds. During the marriage, Wife wrote Husband several checks from her\nseparate account to assist in paying household bills. Husband testified that he would\ndeposit these checks into one of his accounts and often transferred the money among his\nvarious accounts. Therefore, Husband, unlike the wife in Lewis, inextricably mingled\nseparate funds he received from Wife with marital earnings.\n\n         The current case is further distinguishable from Lewis because each spouse made\nsubstantial monetary contributions to the marriage. In Lewis, the wife paid almost all of\nthe household expenses. Id. at *3. The husband only contributed $1,090 toward\nhousehold expenses. Id. The current case, however, contains evidence showing that both\nparties made substantial monetary contributions. At trial, the parties introduced tax\nreturns for the years 2006 through 2011. Based on these tax returns, the trial court found\nthat the total reported gross income of the parties from the time of their marriage through\nthe date of their separation was as follows: $222,310 contributed by Wife and $366,103\ncontributed by Husband. The trial court found that Wife’s claimed gross income\nconstituted thirty-eight percent of the parties’ combined income and Husband’s claimed\ngross income constituted sixty-two percent. Husband argues that the trial court “assigned\n\n                                          - 14 -\n\fan incorrect value to Husband’s gross income for each year,” which resulted in the trial\ncourt deciding “to assign each party an equal share of all marital property.” For example,\nthe trial court found that Husband’s 2007 income was $99,411. According to Husband,\nhis gross income for 2007 was $128,619.\n\n       Examination of the record shows that the trial court determined Husband’s income\nbased on the number Husband reported on his Schedule C tax form for each of the years.\nLine seven on the 2007 Schedule C tax form shows Husband’s gross income was\n$128,619. However, this is Husband’s income prior to deductions for additional business\nexpenses. Part II of the 2007 Schedule C shows that Husband deducted $29,208 in\nadditional business expenses. After calculating these deductions, Husband’s income for\n2007 was $99,411. Husband reported the post-deduction income on line twelve of the\nparties’ 2007 joint tax return as his business income and paid taxes based on that claimed\nincome rather than on the gross income. Examination of the tax returns shows that\nHusband claimed the post-deduction income for each year from 2006 through 2011.\nWife argues that if Husband paid the additional business expenses he claimed on each\nSchedule C tax form, that money would not have been available for use by the parties for\nthe marriage. We agree. Thus, we conclude that the trial court did not err in calculating\nHusband’s claimed gross income based on the post-deduction value. The evidence\npreponderates in favor of a finding that Wife contributed thirty-eight percent to the\nparties’ combined income and Husband contributed sixty-two percent.\n\n       The record also contains evidence showing that Wife made substantial financial\ncontributions to household expenses. Credit card bills and bank account statements show\nthat Wife paid for groceries, utilities, and medical and dental insurance for both parties.\nAdditionally, she gave Husband the $55,635.92 net proceeds from the sale of her\npremarital residence to be used toward additions and improvements to the marital\nresidence.\n\n       In light of Wife’s substantial financial contributions during the marriage, we\nconclude that the trial court did not err in dividing all marital property in equal shares to\nboth parties even though the marriage was of short duration.\n\n                                          Attorney Fees\n\n       Wife seeks an award of attorney fees and costs for this appeal. Litigants are\ngenerally required to pay their own attorney fees unless a statute or contract provision\nprovides otherwise. John Kohl & Co., P.C. v. Dearborn & Ewing, 977 S.W.2d 528, 534\n(Tenn. 1998). An award of attorney fees is appropriate in a domestic relations case in the\nfollowing circumstances: “(1) awards to economically disadvantaged spouses as\nadditional spousal support in divorce proceedings; (2) awards to spouses who must return\nto court to enforce child support obligations; and (3) awards to spouses seeking to enforce\nan MDA when the MDA contains a provision for attorney’s fees.” Elliott v. Elliott, 149\n\n                                           - 15 -\n\fS.W.3d 77, 88 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2004) (footnotes excluded). When an appellate court\nconsiders a request for appellate attorney fees, the court considers “the requesting party’s\nability to pay, the requesting party’s success on appeal, whether the appeal was taken in\ngood faith, and any other relevant equitable factors.” Culbertson v. Culbertson, 455\nS.W.3d 107, 158 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2014) (citing Moran v. Willensky, 339 S.W.3d 651, 666\n(Tenn. Ct. App. 2010)). A decision to award attorney fees on appeal is within the\n“‘sound discretion’” of the appellate court. Id. (quoting Moran, 339 S.W.3d at 666).\nWife has offered no legal argument regarding why she is entitled to an award of attorney\nfees for this appeal. Accordingly, we respectfully decline to award Wife her appellate\nattorney fees.\n\n                                       CONCLUSION\n\n       The judgment of the trial court is affirmed as modified herein. This case is\nremanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Costs of\nthis appeal shall be taxed to the appellant, Jimmy D. Ogle, and execution may issue if\nnecessary.\n\n\n                                                    ________________________________\n                                                    ANDY D.

Wife filed a counter-complaint for a divorce.\nThe trial court granted the parties a divorce based on stipulated grounds, classified the\nparties’ assets as separate or marital, and divided the marital estate. Husband appealed,\narguing that the trial court erred in (1) divesting a revocable trust of all assets and\nrefusing to enforce a valid postnuptial agreement associated with the revocable trust; (2)\nclassifying the increase in value of the marital residence as marital property; (3)\nclassifying the increase in value of Husband’s premarital IRA as marital property; and (4)\ndividing the marital estate equally between the parties given the short duration of the\nmarriage. We affirm as modified and deny Wife’s request for an award of attorney fees\non appeal.\n\n  Tenn. R.

Ogle.\n\nMandy M. Hancock, Knoxville, Tennessee, for the appellee, Julie D. Duff.\n\n                                       OPINION\n\n                       FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n      Jimmy D. Ogle (“Husband”) and Julie D. Duff (“Wife”) were married on April 30,\n2006. After five and one-half years, Husband filed for divorce on the grounds of\ninappropriate marital conduct and irreconcilable differences. Wife filed an answer and\n\fcounter-complaint for divorce based on the same grounds. At the time of trial, Husband\nwas fifty-eight years old and Wife was forty-five years old. Wife worked for the Lenoir\nCity Schools as a school teacher. Husband was a self-employed surveyor. This was the\nsecond marriage for both parties, and Wife had two minor children from her previous\nmarriage.\n\n       Throughout the entirety of the marriage, the parties maintained separate accounts\nfor their earnings. At trial, Wife testified that she deposited her earnings into her separate\nbank account. Husband identified six separate bank accounts he used during the\nmarriage: (1) business account, (2) line of credit, (3) personal checking, (4) farm\naccount, (5) Duff-Turner account, and (6) savings account. He testified that he usually\ndeposited his earnings into the business account but occasionally deposited his earnings\ninto the line of credit account. During the marriage, Wife wrote Husband several checks\nfrom her separate account to pay for utilities and other household expenses. After\nHusband received these checks, he would deposit the funds into one of his several\naccounts and often transferred the money between the various accounts.\n\n       At the time of the marriage, Husband held three individual retirement accounts\n(“IRAs”): (1) Fidelity account (“Fidelity Primary IRA”) with a value of $118,412.39, (2)\nState Farm account ending in -3452 with a value of $3,373.75, and (3) State Farm\naccount ending in -3833 with a value of $4,568.42. On August 22, 2012, Husband rolled\nthe entire $4,011.60 balance of the State Farm account ending in -3452 into the Fidelity\nPrimary IRA account. The Fidelity Primary IRA account was valued at $181,628.32 at\nthe time of divorce.\n\n       Prior to the marriage, Husband owned a lakeside residence referred to as “the\nTanasi Shores property.” Early in the marriage, Husband purchased a 50-acre lot and a\nseparate 5.5 acre lot in White County. On July 14, 2009, Husband created the Jimmy D.\nOgle Revocable Trust (“Trust”) as both settlor and trustee. Husband transferred the\nTanasi Shores and White County properties into the Trust. Wife signed warranty deeds\nfor these properties whereby she conveyed all marital interest she had in the properties to\nHusband as trustee of the Trust. In the Trust, Husband designated Wife and her children\nas beneficiaries of the Trust and named Wife as successor trustee. Contemporaneously\nwith creation of the Trust, Husband executed a Last Will and Testament that directed that\nall other assets be placed in the Trust upon his death. After creation of the Trust,\nHusband, as trustee, purchased what is referred to as the Duff-Turner property. The trust\nagreement contains no provision regarding Wife’s marital interest in property acquired\nfollowing creation of the Trust.\n\n       On July 17, 2012, Husband filed a motion requesting that the trial court determine\nwhat effect the Trust had on the classification of marital property. Husband argued that\nthe Trust was created pursuant to a postnuptial agreement between the parties. The trial\ncourt found there was not sufficient mutual assent between Husband and Wife to form an\n\n                                            -2-\n\fenforceable postnuptial agreement. The trial court, therefore, divested the Trust of titles\nto all properties transferred into the Trust and revested the titles in the names of the\nparties as they existed prior to creation of the Trust. The trial court entered an order and\njudgment on November 3, 2014 granting the parties a divorce on stipulated grounds\npursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-4-1291 and reserved the issue of dividing the marital\nestate. Following trial on the issue of property division, the trial court entered a final\norder on June 1, 2016 dividing the marital estate into equal shares between both parties.\n\n       Husband has now perfected this appeal and raises the following issues: (1)\nwhether the trial court erred in divesting the Trust of all assets and refusing to enforce the\nvalid postnuptial agreement; (2) whether the trial court erred in classifying the increase in\nvalue of Husband’s separate property on Lot 28 Tanasi Shores and the increase in value\nof the Fidelity Primary IRA as marital property; and (3) whether the trial court erred in\ndividing the marital estate into equal shares in light of the short duration of the marriage.\n\n                                          STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n       We review a trial court’s findings of fact de novo with a presumption of\ncorrectness unless the evidence preponderates otherwise.

In making its determination, the trial court considered the\ntranscript of an oral conversation between the parties. At some time after the marriage,\nbut before executing the trust documents, Husband and Wife discussed the creation of the\nTrust. Wife recorded this conversation and introduced a transcript of the recording as an\nexhibit at the hearing on Husband’s motion. At the beginning of the transcript, the\nparties were discussing issues of distrust with each other and agreeing they intended to\nremain married. The discussion then turned to creation of the Trust to protect Husband’s\npersonal assets from potential lawsuits connected to his land survey business and to\nbequeath all Trust properties to Wife and her children in the event of Husband’s death, if\nshe survived him. The transcript does not indicate, however, that the parties discussed\nseparation or divorce issues related to the division of the real properties transferred into\nthe Trust.3\n\n       In addition to the transcript of the parties’ conversation, both parties testified at the\nhearing on Husband’s motion regarding the effect of the Trust on the classification of the\nproperty at issue. The record on appeal contains no transcript from the motion hearing.\nHowever, the record does contain a transcript from the trial on the issue of property\ndivision where both parties testified regarding the circumstances surrounding the creation\nof the Trust. Husband testified that the Trust was created “to protect [his] assets in case\nof a divorce.” He further testified that he did not present Wife with a postnuptial\nagreement because he did not think “she would have signed a post-nuptial agreement just\ngiving away any rights afterwards.” Wife testified that she signed the trust agreement\n\n3\n    Several sections of the transcript indicate that the recording was inaudible.\n                                                       -5-\n\fand accompanying warranty deeds but did not know that she was conveying any marital\ninterest she might have had in the real properties. Wife further testified that had she\nknown she was conveying such interest, she would not have signed the documents.\nAccording to Wife, she signed the documents because she “took [Husband] at his word”\nand believed the Trust was created to protect Husband’s personal assets from potential\nlawsuits from third parties. An examination of the transcript of the recorded conversation\nin conjunction with the testimony of the parties shows that the parties held different\nunderstandings about the purpose of the Trust. Thus, there was insufficient mutual assent\nfor the parties to have a meeting of the minds. We conclude, therefore, that the trial court\nappropriately determined that there was not an enforceable oral postnuptial agreement.\n\n        Husband argues that the trust documents and accompanying warranty deeds\nconstitute a written postnuptial agreement and the trial court erred by not considering\nthese documents for what they state in clear and unambiguous terms and in accordance\nwith Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-3-501. We disagree. Wife signed the warranty deeds for the\nTanasi Shores and White County properties. The warranty deeds contain the following\nprovision after the description of each parcel of real property: “JULIE R. DUFF-OGLE\nexecutes this Warranty Deed to convey all marital interest she may hold in the above\ndescribed property.” Wife testified that she was unaware that the warranty deeds\ncontained this provision. As Husband correctly asserts, “[i]t is a bedrock principle of\ncontract law that an individual who signs a contract is presumed to have read the contract\nand is bound by its contents.” 84 Lumber Co. v. Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1043989\"><a href=\"/opinion/1043989/84-lumber-co-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">356</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">380</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 383 (Tenn.\n2011). When a court interprets a contract, however, “the court must attempt to ascertain\nand give effect to the intention of the parties.” Simonton v. Huff, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1074241\"><a href=\"/opinion/1074241/simonton-v-huff/\"><span class=\"volume\">60</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">820</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 825\n(Tenn. Ct. App. 2000). When a court attempts to determine the parties’ intention, a court\nmust:\n\n       [E]xamine the language of the contract, giving each word its usual, natural,\n       and ordinary meaning. Additionally, the court may consider the situation\n       of the parties, the business to which the contract relates, the subject matter\n       of the contract, the circumstances surrounding the transaction, and the\n       construction placed on the contract by the parties in carrying out its terms.\n\nId. (citations omitted) (emphasis added). The parties must also have a meeting of the\nminds. See Id. at 825-26.\n\n       In order for an enforceable written postnuptial agreement to exist in the current\ncase, Husband and Wife must have had a meeting of the minds regarding creation of the\nTrust as a postnuptial agreement. The trust documents neither reference a postnuptial\nagreement nor do they discuss divorce and separation issues pertaining to the division of\nthe real properties transferred into the Trust. The trust agreement appoints Husband as\nthe sole trustee and grants him the power to pay himself, or pay for his benefit, “as much\nof the net income and principal from the Trust as [he] shall request.” Husband also has\n\n                                           -6-\n\fthe power, as trustee, to dispose of, by sale or other means, any properties transferred into\nthe Trust. Thus, there is no guarantee that any assets would remain in the Trust until\nHusband’s death because he could have, as the trial court found, “done away with all\nassets of the Trust and attempted to take possession of the Trust property or proceeds and\ntransferred them to himself in his individual capacity.” The record does not reflect that\nthe parties discussed or considered this possibility before Husband created the Trust. In\nlight of these facts and the parties’ differing views of the purpose of the Trust discussed\nabove, there was insufficient mutual assent to form a contract.\n\n        After a thorough examination of the record, we conclude that there was no\nmeeting of the minds to form an enforceable oral or written postnuptial agreement and\nthe trial court did not err by divesting the Trust of all assets and revesting titles in the\nnames of the parties as they existed prior to Husband’s creation of the Trust. Because the\ntrust documents and warranty deeds fail to meet the requirements of an enforceable\ncontract, we do not find it necessary to examine them in light of Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-3-\n501.\n\n                               Classification of the Marital Property\n\n       We turn now to the trial court’s classification of the increase in value of two assets\nas marital property. Husband asserts that the trial court erred by classifying the increase\nin value of the Lot 28 Tanasi Shores property and the increase in value of the Fidelity\nPrimary IRA account as marital property.\n\n        Before dividing a marital estate, a trial court must identify all property interests at\nissue and classify each property interest as either separate or marital property.

Id.\n\n        A. Lot 28 Tanasi Shores\n\n        Husband purchased Lot 28 in the Tanasi Shores subdivision on November 6, 1996,\nbefore he married Wife. Thereafter, he built a home on the property. At the time of the\nmarriage, there were no debts encumbering the property. The parties treated the property\nas their marital residence throughout the marriage. The trial court classified the marital\nresidence as Husband’s separate property and assigned it a value of $739,400 as of May\n1, 2006.4 The trial court classified the increase in value of the property, which the court\nvalued at $125,250, as marital property because Wife made intangible contributions of\nlabor and tangible financial contributions that “substantially contributed to the\npreservation and appreciation of the marital home.” The trial court awarded the Tanasi\nShores property to Husband and awarded Wife $94,106.29 as her equitable division share\nof the increase in value of the property.\n\n\n\n4\n  At trial, Husband’s expert testified that the Tanasi Shores property was valued at $835,000 as of May 1,\n2006. Wife presented tax assessment records valuing the property at $643,800 for 2005-2008. “When\nvaluation evidence is conflicting, the court may place a value on the property that is within the range of\nthe values represented by all the relevant valuation evidence.” Owens v.

Ct. App.\n        1992).\n\nKeyt, 244 S.W.3d at 329.\n\n       In the current case, Husband testified that improvements were made to the marital\nresidence, such as adding walls and flooring in the basement and new flooring in the\nmaster bathroom. Wife testified that she gave Husband $55,635.92, the net proceeds she\nreceived from the sale of her premarital property, to pay for the improvements to the\nmarital residence. Husband testified that Wife gave him the $55,635.92 as repayment for\nexpenditures Husband made to Wife’s premarital property for Wife’s benefit prior to the\nsale thereof. The trial court, however, found “Husband’s entire testimony concerning all\nmonetary matters existing prior [to] and during the marriage to be highly suspect and\nlacking in credibility” and considered the $55,635.92 as a financial contribution made by\nWife towards the preservation and appreciation of the marital home. The record contains\nno evidence, other than Husband’s testimony, that an agreement existed between the\nparties for Wife to repay Husband for expenditures he made on her behalf pending sale of\nher premarital property. Furthermore, evidence in the record does not contradict the trial\ncourt’s assessment of Husband’s credibility.5 We, therefore, defer to the trial court’s\nassessment of Husband’s credibility and will consider the $55,635.92 as Wife’s financial\n\n5\n  In addition to evidence regarding the marital residence, Husband testified that he sold his separate real\nproperty located in Sevier County, Tennessee on August 18, 2008, and used the $35,268.41 in proceeds\nfrom this sale to fund the purchase of property for the Trust, referred to as the Duff-Turner property on\nDecember 2, 2010. However, bank account statements introduced at trial reveal that Husband had\ndepleted these funds prior to purchasing the Duff-Turner property. Additionally, Husband claimed that\nWife did not contribute to the purchase of a jet ski the parties acquired during the marriage. Wife\nintroduced bank statements showing she paid $3,062.69 towards the jet ski.\n                                                   -9-\n\fcontribution towards improvements to the marital home. In light of this financial\ncontribution by Wife, we conclude that the evidence preponderates in favor of the trial\ncourt’s finding that Wife substantially contributed to the preservation and appreciation of\nthe marital residence. The trial court’s classification of the appreciation in value of Lot\n28 Tanasi Shores as marital property is affirmed.\n\n       B. Fidelity Primary IRA\n\n        Husband created three IRAs prior to the marriage. One of these IRAs was the\nFidelity Primary IRA. At the time of the marriage, the Fidelity Primary IRA contained\n$118,412.39. The account had a value of $181,628.30 at the time of trial. The trial court\nclassified the entire appreciation value of $63,215.91 as marital property and awarded the\nfull amount to Husband. On appeal, Husband argues that the trial court erred by\nclassifying the increase in value of the Fidelity Primary IRA as marital property because\nno contributions were made to the IRA during the marriage and Wife did not\nsubstantially contribute to the preservation and appreciation of the Fidelity Primary IRA.\n\n       In support of his argument, Husband relies on the case Langschmidt v.\nLangschmidt, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1377348\"><a href=\"/opinion/1377348/langschmidt-v-langschmidt/\"><span class=\"volume\">81</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">741</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tenn. 2002). In Langschmidt, the husband had two\npremarital IRAs. Id. at 743. The husband made no contributions to the premarital IRAs\nduring the marriage. Id. The trial court determined that, “according to the language of\nTenn. Code Ann. § 36-4-121(b)(1)(B), any appreciation in value of the parties’ IRAs\nduring the marriage was marital property subject to equitable division.” Id. at 744. On\nappeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court’s classification of the appreciation in\nvalue of Husband’s separate IRAs as marital property because the court concluded the\nhusband’s IRAs constituted retirement benefits within the meaning of Tenn. Code Ann.\n§ 36-4-121(b)(1)(B). Id. The Supreme Court reversed the trial court’s classification of\nthe appreciation of the IRAs as marital property. Id. at 751. The Supreme Court began\nits examination of the issue by stating that “[r]etirement benefits accrued during the\nmarriage clearly are marital property under Tennessee law.” Id. at 749 (citing Tenn.\nCode Ann. § 36-4-121(b)(1)(B); Gragg v. Gragg, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1060652\"><a href=\"/opinion/1060652/gragg-v-gragg/\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">412</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tenn. 2000); Cohen v.\nCohen, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1743474\"><a href=\"/opinion/1743474/cohen-v-cohen/\"><span class=\"volume\">937</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">823</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tenn. 1996)). The Court determined, however, that the\npremarital IRAs at issue “were not retirement benefits under Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-4-\n121(b)(1)(B)” because they did not “represent deferred compensation during the\nmarriage” due to the fact that the IRAs were funded with the husband’s premarital\nearnings. Id. at 749. Because the husband owned these IRAs prior to the marriage and\nfunded them with premarital assets, the court concluded that they were the husband’s\nseparate property. Id. at 750.\n\n       According to the Court in Langschmidt, both parties must have “‘substantially\ncontributed to [the IRAs’] preservation and appreciation’” in order to classify the IRAs’\nappreciation in value during the marriage as marital property. Id. (quoting Tenn. Code\nAnn. § 36-4-121(b)(1)(B), -121(b)(2)(C)). The Court required some nexus between the\n\n                                           - 10 -\n\fwife’s marital contributions and the appreciation in value of the husband’s separate\nproperty in order to find that the wife made a substantial contribution. Id. The\nLangschmidt Court concluded that the appreciation in value of the IRAs was the\nhusband’s separate property because the record failed to show that the wife substantially\ncontributed to the appreciation and preservation of the IRAs due to a lack of connection\nbetween her marital contributions and the appreciation. Id.\n\n        In the current case, as in Langschmidt, Husband owned the Fidelity Primary IRA\nprior to the marriage and funded it with premarital assets. Therefore, the Fidelity Primary\nIRA was Husband’s separate property under Tenn. Code. Ann. § 36-4-121(b)(2)(A).\nUnder the reasoning of Langschmidt, the appreciation in value of the Fidelity Primary\nIRA would become marital property if Wife substantially contributed to its preservation\nand appreciation. The record before us fails to support such a conclusion. Wife testified\nthat she had no involvement with the management of the Fidelity Primary IRA.\nExamination of the record shows that Wife’s involvement with the Fidelity Primary IRA\nwas limited to Husband showing Wife the account statements to inform her of how the\naccount’s balance fluctuated due to market factors. The record contains no evidence\nestablishing a nexus between Wife’s marital contributions to household expenses and the\nappreciation in value of the Fidelity Primary IRA. Thus, we conclude Wife did not\nsubstantially contribute to the preservation and appreciation of Husband’s separate\nproperty.\n\n       Although the appreciation in value of the Fidelity Primary IRA did not become\nmarital property due to Wife’s substantial contributions, it may have become marital\nproperty under the doctrine of commingling if Husband contributed marital funds to the\naccount during the marriage. With regard to the doctrine of commingling, the\nLangschmidt Court adopted the following principles: “‘[S]eparate property becomes\nmartial property [by commingling] if inextricably mingled with marital property or with\nthe separate property of the other spouse. If the separate property continues to be\nsegregated or can be traced into its product, commingling does not occur . . . .”\nLangschmidt, 81 S.W.3d at 747 (quoting 2 Homer H. Clark, THE LAW OF DOMESTIC\nRELATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES § 16.2 at 185 (2d ed. 1987)).\n\n       In this case, the trial court classified the appreciation in value of the Fidelity\nPrimary IRA as marital property because the court found that Husband contributed to the\naccount during the marriage. The record, however, does not support such a conclusion.\nThe record contains a check written by Husband on February 5, 2007 to Fidelity\nInvestments for $5,000 and a corresponding deposit slip for the Fidelity Primary IRA.\nHusband wrote the check from his business account, which the trial court classified as\nmarital property. Husband argued at trial, and on appeal, that the check was deposited\ninto the Fidelity Primary IRA by mistake and the funds were re-routed to his Fidelity\n\n\n\n                                          - 11 -\n\fSEP-IRA.6 The record also contains a check written by Husband from his business\naccount for $5,000 on March 27, 2007 and a corresponding deposit slip for the Fidelity\nSEP-IRA. Additionally, the record includes account statements for both the Fidelity\nPrimary IRA and the SEP-IRA for the year 2007. The account statement for the Fidelity\nPrimary IRA shows that no contributions were made to the account for that year. The\naccount statement for the SEP-IRA, by contrast, shows that Husband contributed $10,000\nto that account in 2007. Thus, evidence in the record shows that the check written on\nFebruary 7, 2007 was not a contribution to the Fidelity Primary IRA, but rather a\ncontribution to the SEP-IRA. Examination of the record shows that the only contribution\nHusband made to the Fidelity Primary IRA during the marriage was when he rolled his\npremarital State Farm IRA into the Fidelity Primary IRA. The record contains no\nevidence that Husband contributed to the State Farm IRA prior to rolling it over into the\nFidelity Primary IRA. Thus, Husband did not commingle separate and marital funds with\nregard to the Fidelity Primary IRA.\n\n        We conclude that the trial court erred when it classified the appreciation in value\nof the Fidelity Primary IRA as marital property. Accordingly, some adjustments must be\nmade to the trial court’s division of the marital estate. The trial court awarded each party\nfifty percent of all marital property. The trial court valued the appreciation of the marital\nresidence at $125,250 and awarded Wife $94,106.29 as her equitable share of the\nappreciation. She received more than fifty percent of the increase in value of the marital\nresidence because the trial court awarded Husband the entire $63,215.91 increase in value\nof the Fidelity Primary IRA. Therefore, Wife’s interest in the appreciation of the Tanasi\nShores property should be reduced to $62,625.00 (a fifty percent share of $125,250).\n\n                                    Equitable Distribution of Marital Assets\n\n       Husband next takes issue with the trial court’s division of the marital estate.\nHusband argues that the trial court erred by dividing the marital estate equally between\nthe parties because the trial court failed to give proper weight to what Husband considers\nthe most important factors in this case: the relatively short duration of the marriage and\neach spouse’s contribution to the accumulation of assets during the marriage.\n\n       After a trial court has classified the parties’ marital property, the court must\nequitably divide the marital assets. Fox v. Fox, No. M2004-02616-COA-R3-CV, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2535407</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *7 (Tenn.

Code Ann.\n§ 36-4-121(c) guide a trial court in determining how to equitably divide marital property.\nA trial court does not merely apply these factors in a mechanical fashion when dividing\nmarital assets.

We will defer to the trial court’s decision concerning property division\nunless the decision is not consistent with the factors found in Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-4-\n121(c) or the evidence preponderates otherwise. Brown, 913 S.W.2d at 168.\n\n       One of the factors a trial court is permitted to consider is “[t]he duration of the\nmarriage[.]” Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-4-121(c)(1). If a case involves a marriage of short\nduration, “it is appropriate to divide the property in a way that, as nearly as possible,\nplaces the parties in the same position they would have been in had the marriage never\ntaken place.” Batson, 769 S.W.2d at 859. In such cases, it is important for a court to\nconsider the contributions made by each spouse “to the accumulation of assets during the\nmarriage[.]” Id. Additionally, a marriage of short duration diminishes the significance\nand value of the non-monetary contributions made by a spouse, and “claims by one\nspouse to another spouse’s separate property are minimal at best.” Id.\n\n       Husband argues that the trial court should have restored the parties to the position\nthey were in prior to the marriage because this was a marriage of short duration. In\nsupport of his argument, Husband relies on the case Lewis v. Frances, No. M1998-\n00946-COA-R3-CV, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2001</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">219662</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tenn. Ct. App. Mar. 7, 2001). Lewis involved a\nshort-term marriage between parties who entered the marriage with a large discrepancy in\nassets. Lewis, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2001</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">219662</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *1. The wife filed a petition for divorce after twenty-\nthree months of marriage. Id. She had a pre-marital estate that was approximately fifty\ntimes greater than that of the husband. Id. The parties filed separate tax returns and\nmaintained separate financial accounts throughout the marriage. Id. Moreover, the\nparties never owned any property jointly. Id. The evidence established that an agreement\nexisted between the parties to keep their assets segregated. Id. at *9. The husband\nargued that the wife’s separate property had been converted into marital property under\nthe doctrine of commingling and that he should have received an equal share of the\nmarital estate. Id. at *1, *8. The Lewis court determined that no commingling occurred.\nId. at *9. The court also determined that the husband made few contributions to the\nmarriage, either monetary or non-monetary. Id. at *3. As a result, the Lewis court\nconcluded “that the parties should, in large measure, be restored to their pre-marriage\nfinancial condition.” Id.at *10.\n\n          Husband argues that the current case is similar to Lewis because it also involves\na short-term marriage and a disparity in premarital assets. See Stewart v. Stewart, No.\n02A01-9106-CH-119, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1992</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">70927</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *4 (Tenn. Ct. App. Apr. 10, 1992) (implicitly\nfinding that a marriage of almost nine years constituted a marriage of short duration).\nThis case, however, is distinguishable from Lewis. At trial, Husband testified that he\nentered the marriage with approximately $1,300,000 in assets. Husband also provided a\nlist of his premarital assets and their estimated values. Examination of the evidence\n\n                                          - 13 -\n\fshows that Wife entered the marriage with approximately $100,000 in assets. This\ndisparity in assets falls far short of the disparity found in Lewis. Moreover, Husband\ntestified on cross-examination that he entered the marriage with a $33,000 debt he owed\nthe Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”). Husband further testified that he satisfied this debt\nduring the marriage. Our examination of the record shows that, when Husband listed his\npremarital assets and their values he failed to account for the debt owed to the IRS. In\naddition, the document Husband introduced at trial detailing his claimed premarital assets\nlists $95,000 in cash as a premarital asset. He testified that he inherited this money from\nhis father and kept it in a safe located in the marital home. Husband provided no\nevidence of the existence of this $95,000 other than the list of premarital assets he\nprepared and his testimony, which the trial court did not find credible. Thus, the\nevidence in the record fails to substantiate Husband’s claim that he entered the marriage\nwith $1,300,000 in assets.\n\n         Husband further argues that the current case is similar to Lewis because the\nparties maintained separate financial accounts. In Lewis, “the uncontroverted evidence”\nestablished the existence of an agreement between the parties, both prior to and during\nthe marriage, that their assets would remain separate. Id. at *9. In the current case, the\nparties dispute the reason they maintained separate financial accounts. At trial, Husband\ntestified that the parties maintained separate accounts because they agreed that Wife’s\nearnings would be her property and Husband’s earnings would be his property. Wife, on\nthe other hand, testified that the parties maintained separate accounts because Husband\nowed the IRS $33,000 at the time of the marriage. The trial court found Wife’s testimony\nmore credible than that of Husband. Thus, the trial court classified the parties’ earnings\nduring the marriage as marital property. In addition, the record in this case, unlike the\nrecord in Lewis, contains evidence that Husband commingled his separate funds with\nmarital funds. During the marriage, Wife wrote Husband several checks from her\nseparate account to assist in paying household bills. Husband testified that he would\ndeposit these checks into one of his accounts and often transferred the money among his\nvarious accounts. Therefore, Husband, unlike the wife in Lewis, inextricably mingled\nseparate funds he received from Wife with marital earnings.\n\n         The current case is further distinguishable from Lewis because each spouse made\nsubstantial monetary contributions to the marriage. In Lewis, the wife paid almost all of\nthe household expenses. Id. at *3. The husband only contributed $1,090 toward\nhousehold expenses. Id. The current case, however, contains evidence showing that both\nparties made substantial monetary contributions. At trial, the parties introduced tax\nreturns for the years 2006 through 2011. Based on these tax returns, the trial court found\nthat the total reported gross income of the parties from the time of their marriage through\nthe date of their separation was as follows: $222,310 contributed by Wife and $366,103\ncontributed by Husband. The trial court found that Wife’s claimed gross income\nconstituted thirty-eight percent of the parties’ combined income and Husband’s claimed\ngross income constituted sixty-two percent. Husband argues that the trial court “assigned\n\n                                          - 14 -\n\fan incorrect value to Husband’s gross income for each year,” which resulted in the trial\ncourt deciding “to assign each party an equal share of all marital property.” For example,\nthe trial court found that Husband’s 2007 income was $99,411. According to Husband,\nhis gross income for 2007 was $128,619.\n\n       Examination of the record shows that the trial court determined Husband’s income\nbased on the number Husband reported on his Schedule C tax form for each of the years.\nLine seven on the 2007 Schedule C tax form shows Husband’s gross income was\n$128,619. However, this is Husband’s income prior to deductions for additional business\nexpenses. Part II of the 2007 Schedule C shows that Husband deducted $29,208 in\nadditional business expenses. After calculating these deductions, Husband’s income for\n2007 was $99,411. Husband reported the post-deduction income on line twelve of the\nparties’ 2007 joint tax return as his business income and paid taxes based on that claimed\nincome rather than on the gross income. Examination of the tax returns shows that\nHusband claimed the post-deduction income for each year from 2006 through 2011.\nWife argues that if Husband paid the additional business expenses he claimed on each\nSchedule C tax form, that money would not have been available for use by the parties for\nthe marriage. We agree. Thus, we conclude that the trial court did not err in calculating\nHusband’s claimed gross income based on the post-deduction value. The evidence\npreponderates in favor of a finding that Wife contributed thirty-eight percent to the\nparties’ combined income and Husband contributed sixty-two percent.\n\n       The record also contains evidence showing that Wife made substantial financial\ncontributions to household expenses. Credit card bills and bank account statements show\nthat Wife paid for groceries, utilities, and medical and dental insurance for both parties.\nAdditionally, she gave Husband the $55,635.92 net proceeds from the sale of her\npremarital residence to be used toward additions and improvements to the marital\nresidence.\n\n       In light of Wife’s substantial financial contributions during the marriage, we\nconclude that the trial court did not err in dividing all marital property in equal shares to\nboth parties even though the marriage was of short duration.\n\n                                          Attorney Fees\n\n       Wife seeks an award of attorney fees and costs for this appeal. Litigants are\ngenerally required to pay their own attorney fees unless a statute or contract provision\nprovides otherwise. John Kohl & Co., P.C. v. Dearborn & Ewing, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1060821\"><a href=\"/opinion/1060821/john-kohl-co-pc-v-dearborn-ewing/\"><span class=\"volume\">977</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">528</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 534\n(Tenn. 1998). An award of attorney fees is appropriate in a domestic relations case in the\nfollowing circumstances: “(1) awards to economically disadvantaged spouses as\nadditional spousal support in divorce proceedings; (2) awards to spouses who must return\nto court to enforce child support obligations; and (3) awards to spouses seeking to enforce\nan MDA when the MDA contains a provision for attorney’s fees.” Elliott v. Elliott, 149\n\n                                           - 15 -\n\fS.W.3d 77, 88 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2004) (footnotes excluded). When an appellate court\nconsiders a request for appellate attorney fees, the court considers “the requesting party’s\nability to pay, the requesting party’s success on appeal, whether the appeal was taken in\ngood faith, and any other relevant equitable factors.” Culbertson v. Culbertson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">455</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">107</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 158 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2014) (citing Moran v. Willensky, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2538039\"><a href=\"/opinion/2538039/moran-v-willensky/\"><span class=\"volume\">339</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">651</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 666\n(Tenn. Ct. App. 2010)). A decision to award attorney fees on appeal is within the\n“‘sound discretion’” of the appellate court. Id. (quoting Moran, 339 S.W.3d at 666).\nWife has offered no legal argument regarding why she is entitled to an award of attorney\nfees for this appeal. Accordingly, we respectfully decline to award Wife her appellate\nattorney fees.\n\n                                       CONCLUSION\n\n       The judgment of the trial court is affirmed as modified herein. This case is\nremanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Costs of\nthis appeal shall be taxed to the appellant, Jimmy D. Ogle, and execution may issue if\nnecessary.\n\n\n                                                    ________________________________\n                                                    ANDY D.

Husband appealed, arguing that the trial court erred in (1) divesting a revocable trust of all assets and refusing to enforce a valid postnuptial agreement associated with the revocable trust (2) classifying the increase in value of the marital residence as marital property (3) classifying the increase in value of Husband's premarital IRA as marital property and (4) dividing the marital estate equally between the parties given the short duration of the marriage.
