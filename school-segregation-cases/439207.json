For the reasons\n\nexpressed below, we affirm the decision of the district court.\n\n      I. Factual and Procedural Background.\n\n      There are thirty-seven departments within the executive branch of\n\nthe State of Iowa. Each exercises its own hiring authority.              The State\n\nemploys a merit hiring system, which establishes “a system of human\n\nresource administration based on merit principles and scientific methods\n\nto   govern     the   appointment,        compensation,     promotion,    welfare,\n\ndevelopment, transfer, layoff, removal, and discipline of its civil\n\nemployees, and other incidents of state employment.”                    Iowa Code\n\n§ 8A.411(1).     The Code further directs that “[a]ll appointments and\n\npromotions to positions covered by the state merit system shall be made\n\nsolely on the basis of merit and fitness, to be ascertained by\n\nexaminations or other appropriate screening methods.” Id. § 8A.411(3).\n\n      The      Iowa   Department     of    Administrative    Services    (DAS)   is\n\nresponsible for ensuring that hiring decisions are made in accordance\n\nwith the merit system. See id. § 8A.104(12) (“The director [of DAS] shall\n\n. . . [e]xamine and develop best practices for the efficient operation of\n\ngovernment and encourage state agencies to adopt and implement these\n\npractices.”). DAS is tasked with providing rules for the departments to\n\nfollow. See id. § 8A.413(1) (DAS adopts rules for the administration of\n\nthe merit employment system).              DAS collects statewide data and\n\f                                         4\n\nmonitors compliance.       In order to comply with the stated goals of the\n\nmerit system, DAS has a wide range of options, including retaining\n\nindependent consultants.1 Upon request, DAS assigns personnel officers\nas human resource advisors to various departments to assist with\n\nemployment functions, such as providing materials and training, helping\n\ndevelop screening tools, and assisting with hiring.\n\n       Applicants to executive branch positions, as well as current\n\nemployees applying for promotions, submit applications to DAS, either\n\nonline or by hard copy.           DAS maintains electronic data on every\n\napplicant and application in their database, the BrassRing.2 The district\n\ncourt summarized the hiring system as employing three separate\n\ndecision-making steps: (1) “DAS receives applications for merit-covered\n\njob posting, screens those applications for basic eligibility of the job\n\nclassification, and refers eligible applicants to the hiring department”\n\n(emphasis omitted) (referral); (2) “the hiring department screens the\n\nreferred applicants for the job-title specific requirements, determines\n\nwhich candidates to interview” (interview selection); and (3) “the hiring\n\ndepartment interviews the selected candidates and decides which\n\ncandidate to offer the job” (hire or promotion).\n       Although all departments follow the general practices of the merit\n\nsystem, their practices in the hiring process vary. These varied practices\n\ninclude: using a second résumé screen, requiring candidates to more\n\n\n       1Violation  of the human-resources subchapter of Iowa Code chapter 8A or DAS’s\nregulations is a simple misdemeanor. Iowa Code § 8A.458. Further, “[t]he director may\ninstitute and maintain any action or proceeding at law or in equity that the director\nconsiders necessary or appropriate to secure compliance with this subchapter and the\nrules and orders under this subchapter.” Id. § 8A.453(1).\n       2DAS converted to the BrassRing system between 2004 and 2006. Before this,\n\nthe State used the AS-400 system.\n\f                                        5\n\nfully explain how their experiences qualify them for a specific job\n\nfunction, or requiring a typing test.       Each department maintains data\n\nrelating to each applicant, which is stored in paper hiring files, unlike the\n\nDAS data system, which is electronic. Each paper hiring file contains a\n\nBrassRing registration number so a correlation between a specific job\n\nposting and the applicant’s performance on the screening devices and/or\n\ninterview records can be correlated.\n\n      In this case, fourteen3 African-American plaintiffs brought a\n\nlawsuit under both Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended,\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e–2000e-17 (2006), and the Iowa Civil Rights Act of\n\n1965, as amended, Iowa Code chapter 216.\n\n      In their petition, the plaintiffs alleged that the State of Iowa,\n\nincluding the thirty-seven different executive branch departments,\n\nengaged in practices that resulted in a failure to maintain a diverse,\n\nnondiscriminatory workplace through its merit employment system. The\n\nplaintiffs contend that because of the State’s failure to enforce extant\n\nstatutory and regulatory policies, a disproportionate number of African\n\nAmericans were denied an equal opportunity for employment.                  They\n\nclaim this was the natural unintended consequences of the State’s failure\n\nto follow rules designed to ensure equal opportunity in the workplace\n\nand was not done intentionally or with malice.\n\n      Further, the plaintiffs alleged that in May of 2006 they provided\n\nthe State of Iowa with a document entitled “Initial Evidentiary Report,”\n\nalleging systemic racial bias and a pattern of retaliation by top managers\n\nand officials of the State of Iowa. The plaintiffs further alleged that the\n\n      3The  plaintiffs’ lawsuit was filed in October 2007 and subsequently amended\nthree times, adding nine additional plaintiffs, for a total of twenty-three named\nplaintiffs.\n\f                                     6\n\nState hired a consultant to study employment practices in late 2006 or\n\nearly 2007 who produced a report known as the CPS Report.                 The\n\nplaintiffs alleged that the Initial Evidentiary Report and the CPS Report\n\nput the State on notice that the hiring practices of the State imposed\n\nbarriers to equal employment opportunities for African Americans.\n\n      On September 28, 2010, on stipulation of the parties, the district\n\ncourt ordered certification of the case as a class action.         The class\n\ndefinition and class claim were:\n\n      CLASS DEFINITION: All African American applicants or\n      employees who sought appointment to or held a merit-\n      system position with an Executive Branch agency (not\n      including Board of Regents) at any point from July 1, 2003\n      through [date of Court’s decision regarding liability].\n      CLASS CLAIM: Disparate Impact or Adverse Impact\n      discrimination with respect to hiring and promotion\n      decisions and/or unequal terms and conditions of\n      employment associated with those decisions under Title VII\n      and the Iowa Civil Rights Act arising from subjective,\n      discretionary decision-making permitted by the State’s\n      abdication of statutory or regulatory responsibilities and\n      obligations and/or failure to follow its own policies.\n\n      The case came to trial on September 12, 2011.             The plaintiffs\n\noffered evidence relating to the efforts of the State to document its\n\nemployment practices, expert testimony by a statistical expert, labor\neconomist Mark Killingsworth, social science testimony from psychology\n\nprofessors Anthony Greenwald and Cheryl Kaiser, testimony from DAS\n\nrepresentatives and personnel, and anecdotal testimony from various\n\nplaintiffs related to their experience with state government.\n\n      In support of the plaintiffs’ claims, Killingsworth testified that\n\nbased on his statistical work employing conventional and probit\n\f                                          7\n\nregression analysis4 statistical procedures, African Americans were\n\ntreated differently and more disadvantageously than whites with respect\n\nto the referral of applications by DAS for interviews, with respect to the\n\nselection for interviews by various agencies and departments, and with\n\nrespect to ultimate hiring. Further, he opined that once hired, African\n\nAmericans have lower salaries within a given job title or are hired for job\n\ntitles that pay less than others, and were treated differently in\n\nperformance evaluations. In making his calculations, Killingsworth only\n\nanalyzed applicants who had been deemed by DAS to meet the minimum\n\nqualifications for the job classification and had been referred to\n\ndepartments. He approached the data from a variety of perspectives, as\n\nhis analytical models could include or exclude different variables.\n\nRegarding the separability of the elements in the hiring process,\n\nKillingsworth testified:\n\n       [I]t’s not that it’s incapable of being separated, but I think\n       there are very serious questions about whether it can\n       reliably be separated, which is a different story.\n       Mechanically, one could certainly separate it. And I know\n       [this] because [the State’s] experts have done [it.]\n\n       The    plaintiffs   offered   social    science    evidence    through     two\n\npsychology     professors:     Anthony        Greenwald     and    Cheryl     Kaiser.\n\nGreenwald’s field of study is implicit social cognition, a phrase which he\n\nintroduced in a coauthored article in 1995.              According to Greenwood,\n\nimplicit bias, also known as hidden or unconscious bias, is a person’s\n\n\n       4The  district court described the difference between conventional and probit\nregression analysis as follows:\n       a [conventional] regression analysis seeks to predict or forecast how a\n       dependent variable might change based upon changes in one or more\n       independent variables. The probit analysis differs primarily in that the\n       dependent value in that context may only have one of two values.\n\f                                     8\n\nautomatic preference for one race over another. He asserted that it was\n\npossible that implicit bias affected Iowa decision-makers in this case,\n\nalthough he did not review any of the hiring files, nor any specific\n\nemployment decisions relating to any class members. He could not rule\n\nout other race-neutral causes for the statistical imbalance in the State’s\n\nhiring system. In his opinion, even in the best case scenario, bias could\n\nstill unconsciously invade the State’s hiring process.\n\n      Kaiser studies stereotyping and prejudice and their effects on\n\ndecision-making. She testified that she viewed implicit bias as pervasive\n\nand believed all people fall within a spectrum with explicit bias on one\n\nend and limited implicit bias on the other. She opined that training and\n\naccountability, including recordkeeping, are means of reducing implicit\n\nbias and, if used more extensively by the State, would have a positive\n\neffect on reducing the implicit bias in the State system.\n\n      Additionally, several class members, referring to documents\n\nrelating to their applications for hire or promotion, testified at trial and\n\noffered examples in which, they claim, the hiring system did not function\n\nas intended.    These examples included: a qualified African-American\n\napplicant who was not referred to a department by DAS, due to DAS\n\nincorrectly reporting the applicant was not qualified; in some cases,\n\nrésumés of African Americans were marked to highlight spelling and\n\ngrammatical errors; and some hiring files contained African-Americans’\n\nrésumés, but not the screening devices used to score or evaluate them.\n\n      The plaintiffs buttressed the testimony of their witnesses with the\n\nCPS Report, a review of the State’s hiring practices commissioned by the\n\nState, prepared by human resources consultants in response to\n\nexpressed concerns about racial discrimination in state employment.\n\nThe CPS Report found, among other things, that during fiscal years\n\f                                       9\n\n2004–2006,      qualified   minority   applicants   were   interviewed   less\n\nfrequently than qualified white applicants (13.46% for minorities and\n\n20.24% for whites), figures which the authors noted “may support the\n\nperception of discriminatory hiring practices.” Further, the report noted\n\nthat while African Americans constituted six percent of the total qualified\n\npool, they represented no more than 2.8% of the total hires for fiscal\n\nyears 2004–2006.        By comparison, whites represented eighty-eight\n\npercent of the qualified applicants and ninety-one percent of the total\n\nhires.      The CPS Report noted that the statistical difference in\n\nemployment appeared to arise from the process between the referral step\n\nand the interview step (African Americans were reduced from 5.95%\n\nreferred to 3.47% interviewed of the total applicant pool for fiscal years\n\n2004–2006 combined) and the process between the interview step and\n\nthe hire decision (African Americans were reduced to 2.82% while whites\n\nincreased to 91.52%).        According to the CPS Report, “The actual\n\npersonnel decisions may create a rebuttable inference of adverse impact.”\n\nIt recommended that DAS “institute a policy of regular and systematic\n\noversight . . . to ensure compliance with [required] policies and\n\nprocedures.”     The CPS Report cautioned, however, that because the\n\nState’s application tracking system (the BrassRing) did not track\n\nindividual people, but rather applications, it was difficult to identify with\n\nany certainty the exact makeup of the applicant pool or the actual\n\nnumber of applicants.\n\n         The State offered evidence related to the decision-making process\n\nin state government. It also offered the testimony of economist Robert\n\nMiller, who was tasked by the State with analyzing Killingsworth’s\n\nfindings and examining the employment outcomes in Iowa state\n\ngovernment to determine if African Americans were systemically\n\f                                          10\n\ndisadvantaged. Miller found Killingsworth’s reports to be incomplete and\n\nhis conclusions not well-founded. He testified that, in his opinion, there\n\nwas   no    statistically   significant    evidence   of   system    wide   racial\n\ndiscrimination in the merit employment system in the State of Iowa.\n\nMiller also testified that it was possible for the plaintiffs to break down\n\nthe aggregate analysis into more discrete consideration of employment\n\ndecisions by department or by other classifications.\n\n      On April 17, 2012, the district court filed a detailed and thoughtful\n\nfifty-six page decision in favor of the State. The district court first noted\n\nthat with regard to the plaintiffs’ first theory, even assuming that “the\n\ncomponents of the decision-making process in this case are not capable\n\nof being separated, [the] Plaintiffs have failed to provide legal authority\n\nfor concluding that ‘abdication of statutory or regulatory responsibilities\n\nand obligations and/or failure to follow its own policies’ is a particular\n\nemployment practice.” Next, in regards to the plaintiffs’ second theory,\n\nthe court found the plaintiffs had not carried their burden of\n\n“demonstrating the inseparability of the employment system components\n\nfor analytical purposes.” The court concluded “[t]he former theory fail[ed]\n\nas a matter of law; the latter as a matter of fact.”\n\n      Alternatively, looking to the plaintiffs’ statistical and implicit bias\n\nevidence, the district court noted that the plaintiffs failed to prove the\n\ncausation element of their disparate impact claim.                  The plaintiffs\n\nappealed.\n\n      II. Standard of Review.\n\n      In this appeal of a trial to the court, the standard of review on all\n\nissues is for correction of errors at law and for findings of fact not\n\nsupported by substantial evidence. Iowa R. App. P. 6.907; Falczynski v.\n\nAmoco Oil Co., 533 N.W.2d 226, 230 (Iowa 1995).                     “Evidence is\n\f                                    11\n\nsubstantial for purposes of sustaining a finding of fact when a\n\nreasonable mind would accept it as adequate to reach a conclusion.”\n\nFalczynski, 533 N.W.2d at 230. We view the substantiality of evidence in\n\nthe light most favorable to upholding the trial court’s judgment.       Id.;\n\nFuller v. Iowa Dep’t of Human Servs., 576 N.W.2d 324, 328 (Iowa 1998).\n\n      Reversal is required when an error of law or fact materially affects\n\nother findings or rulings. See Falczynski, 533 N.W.2d at 230. “[W]hen\n\nthe trial court following a bench trial has denied recovery because a\n\nparty failed to sustain its burden of proof on an issue, we will not\n\ninterfere with the trial court’s judgment unless we find the party has\n\ncarried its burden as a matter of law.” Id.; see Vincent v. Four M Paper\n\nCorp., 589 N.W.2d 55, 62 (Iowa 1999). “We will conclude a party has\n\ncarried such a burden only when evidence is so overwhelming that only\n\none reasonable inference on each critical fact issue can be drawn.”\n\nFalczynski, 533 N.W.2d at 230. We are not bound by the trial court’s\n\napplication of legal principles or its conclusions of law.      Fuller, 576\n\nN.W.2d at 328. “When the trial court has applied erroneous rules of law\n\nwhich materially affected its decision, we will reverse.” Falczynski, 533\n\nN.W.2d at 230.\n\n     III. Overview of Legal Framework Established by Modern State\nand Federal Civil Rights Acts.\n\n      A. Context of State and Federal Legislation. The issues raised\n\nin this case cannot be approached without consideration of the larger\n\ncontext in which they arise. The legacy of slavery and Jim Crow may be\n\nin the past, but their effects cast a shadow into the present. Specifically,\n\nAfrican Americans continue to be underrepresented in many categories\n\nof employment. While the days of “Whites Only Need Apply” signage are\n\nfortunately long passed, institutional barriers to equality of economic\n\f                                    12\n\nopportunity remain intractable.     See Susan Sturm, Second Generation\n\nEmployment Discrimination: A Structural Approach, 101 Colum. L. Rev.\n\n458, 459–60 (2001) (“Smoking guns—the sign on the door that ‘Irish\n\nneed not apply’ or the rejection explained by the comment that ‘this is no\n\njob for a woman’—are largely things of the past. . . .        Cognitive bias,\n\nstructures of decision making, and patterns of interaction have replaced\n\ndeliberate racism and sexism as the frontier of much continued\n\ninequality.”); see also generally Melissa Hart, Subjective Decisionmaking\n\nand Unconscious Discrimination, 56 Ala. L. Rev. 741 (2005); Audrey J.\n\nLee, Note, Unconscious Bias Theory in Employment Discrimination\n\nLitigation, 40 Harv. C.R.-C.L. L. Rev. 481 (2005). The remedies afforded\n\nunder civil rights legislation disparate impact analysis are a critical\n\ncomponent in eliminating barriers or headwinds faced by African\n\nAmericans in the employment marketplace.\n\n      The purposes of both the Iowa Civil Rights Act and the Federal\n\nCivil Rights Act are designed to address these ongoing problems. The\n\nUnited States Supreme Court has declared that the primary purpose of\n\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is “ ‘to assure equality of\n\nemployment    opportunities   and    to   eliminate   those   discriminatory\n\npractices and devices which have fostered racially stratified job\n\nenvironments to the disadvantage of minority citizens.’ ”       Int’l Bhd. of\n\nTeamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 348, 97 S. Ct. 1843, 1861, 52\n\nL. Ed. 2d 396, 423 (1977) (quoting McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411\n\nU.S. 792, 800, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 1823, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668, 676 (1973)); see\n\nConnecticut v. Teal, 457 U.S. 440, 448–49, 102 S. Ct. 2525, 2531–32, 73\n\nL. Ed. 2d 130, 137–38 (1982) (explaining Title VII’s purposes). Similarly,\n\nthe Iowa Civil Rights Act was enacted “in an effort to establish parity in\n\f                                    13\n\nthe workplace and market opportunity for all.” Vivian v. Madison, 601\n\nN.W.2d 872, 873 (Iowa 1999).\n\n      B. Historical Development of Disparate Impact. There are two\n\ndistinct theories of liability under civil rights laws for discrimination in\n\nemployment, namely, cases involving disparate treatment and cases\n\ninvolving disparate impact. See Int’l Bhd. of Teamsters, 431 U.S. at 335\n\nn.15, 97 S. Ct. at 1854 n.15, 52 L. Ed. 2d at 415 n.15. In a disparate\n\ntreatment case, the plaintiff bears the burden of showing he or she has\n\nbeen harmed by discriminatory animus of the employer. See id. at 357,\n\n97 S. Ct. at 1866, 52 L. Ed. 2d at 429. Proving discriminatory animus is\n\noften a difficult task as it involves probing the subjective motivations of\n\nthe decision-maker.   Although cases of blatant racism still exist, most\n\ndiscrimination is more subtle and difficult to demonstrate.\n\n      In the alternative, however, a civil rights claim may be brought\n\nbased on disparate impact. In a disparate impact case, what matters is\n\nnot the subjective motivation of the employer, but the effects of an\n\nemployment practice. See Teal, 457 U.S. at 447 n.8, 102 S. Ct. at 2531\n\nn.8, 73 L. Ed. 2d at 137 n.8 (“Experts familiar with the subject now\n\ngenerally describe the problem in terms of ‘systems’ and ‘effects’ rather\n\nthan simply intentional wrongs.” (Internal citations omitted.)); Int’l Bhd.\n\nof Teamsters, 431 U.S. at 335 n.15, 97 S. Ct. at 1854 n.15, 52 L. Ed. 2d\n\nat 415 n.15 (“Proof of discriminatory motive . . . is not required under a\n\ndisparate-impact theory.”); Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 432,\n\n91 S. Ct. 849, 854, 28 L. Ed. 2d 158, 165 (1971) (noting “good intent or\n\nabsence   of   discriminatory   intent   does   not   redeem   employment\n\nprocedures or testing mechanisms that operate as ‘built-in headwinds’\n\nfor minority groups and are unrelated to measuring job capability”).\n\f                                     14\n\n      It is sometimes asserted that disparate impact analysis of civil\n\nrights claims is outside the “core” of civil rights statutes and represents a\n\nnovel legal development. See Stewart J. Schwab & Steven L. Willburn,\n\nReasonable Accommodation of Workplace Disabilities, 44 Wm. & Mary L.\n\nRev. 1197, 1201 (2003) (characterizing disparate impact cases as “non-\n\ncore cases of discrimination under Title VII”).       But this is at least\n\nsomewhat misleading.      Concern about institutional barriers to equal\n\nopportunity in employment predated civil rights statutes and can be seen\n\nat the beginning of the modern civil rights movement.         For example,\n\nPresident Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8802 in June of 1941, which\n\nprohibited discrimination by race by private employers engaged in\n\ngovernment contracting and created a Fair Employment Practices\n\nCommission which monitored broad trends, pushed and cajoled\n\nemployers in the war industries, and assessed the bottom line in terms of\n\noverall progress.   See Susan D. Carle, How Myth-Busting About the\n\nHistorical Goals of Civil Rights Activism Can Illuminate Future Paths, 7\n\nStan. J. C.R. & C.L. 167, 172–73 (2011); see also Exec. Order No. 8802,\n\n6 Fed. Reg. 3109 (June 25, 1941).         Disparate impact claims may be\n\ncomplex and complicated, but they are not disfavored.\n\n      C. Treatment of Disparate Impact Analysis Under Title VII of\n\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964 by the United States Supreme Court.\n\n      1. Introduction. Although federal law is not controlling on state\n\nlaw questions, we begin substantive discussion of disparate impact\n\nanalysis with an overview of cases of the United States Supreme Court.\n\nThe reason for this is simple: in a series of disparate impact cases, the\n\nSupreme Court has developed doctrine in both majority and dissenting\n\nopinions in considerable detail. Further, one of the claims in this case\n\nwas brought under federal law. On the federal law claim, of course, the\n\f                                    15\n\ndecisions of the United States Supreme Court constitute binding\n\nauthority which we must faithfully apply in our interpretation of federal\n\nlaw.   With respect to the state law claim, the reasoning of the United\n\nStates Supreme Court opinions, and the dissenting opinions, may well be\n\npersuasive, although it is certainly not binding upon us.      As a result,\n\nunderstanding the range of interpretive options for state courts in\n\ninterpreting state law can be enhanced by analysis of majority and\n\ndissenting opinions of the United States Supreme Court.\n\n       2. Griggs: A unanimous court’s broad construction of the Federal\n\nCivil Rights Act. The first decision of the United States Supreme Court\n\nwhich considered a case based on disparate impact was Griggs, 401 U.S.\n\nat 424, 91 S. Ct. at 849, 28 L. Ed. 2d at 158. In Griggs, the Supreme\n\nCourt considered a class action alleging that the requirement of a high\n\nschool education or passing a standardized general intelligence test as a\n\ncondition of employment violated the Federal Civil Rights Act. Id. at 425–\n\n26, 91 S. Ct. at 851, 28 L. Ed. 2d at 161. In Griggs, the plaintiff asserted\n\nthat neither “standard [was] shown to be significantly related to job\n\nperformance,” that both standards operated to disqualify African\n\nAmericans at a substantially higher rate than white applicants, and that\n\nthe jobs in question had been previously filled by whites only as a result\n\nof long-standing practice. Id. at 426, 91 S. Ct. at 851, 28 L. Ed. 2d at\n\n161.\n\n       A unanimous Supreme Court found for the plaintiffs. As noted by\n\nChief Justice Burger, “[P]ractices, procedures, or tests neutral on their\n\nface, and even neutral in terms of intent, cannot be maintained if they\n\noperate to ‘freeze’ the status quo of prior discriminatory employment\n\npractices.” Id. at 430, 91 S. Ct. at 853, 28 L. Ed. 2d at 163. In much\n\nquoted language, Chief Justice Burger noted that the Federal Civil Rights\n\f                                    16\n\nAct “proscribes not only overt discrimination but also practices that are\n\nfair in form, but discriminatory in operation.” Id. at 431, 91 S. Ct. at\n\n853, 28 L. Ed. 2d at 164. Further, the Chief Justice noted that “good\n\nintent or absence of discriminatory intent does not redeem employment\n\nprocedures or testing mechanisms that operate as ‘built-in headwinds’\n\nfor minority groups and are unrelated to measuring job capability.” Id.\n\nat 432, 91 S. Ct. at 854, 28 L. Ed. 2d at 165. Again, the Chief Justice\n\nnoted that “Congress directed the thrust of [the Federal Civil Rights Act]\n\nto   the   consequences   of   employment     practices,   not   simply   the\n\nmotivation.” Id. (emphasis omitted).\n\n      Griggs clearly established that a civil rights claim could be based\n\non   disparate   impact   without   proving   discriminatory     animus    or\n\nmotivation in cases involving objective standardized tests or employment\n\ncriteria. See id. at 436, 91 S. Ct. at 856, 28 L. Ed. 2d at 167. But what\n\nabout a claim that the exercise of subjective discretion of supervisory\n\nemployees has produced illegal discrimination?\n\n      3.   Watson: The court divided.    The first United States Supreme\n\nCourt case to consider a federal civil rights claim based upon a subjective\n\ndecision-making process was Watson v. Fort Worth Bank & Trust, 487\n\nU.S. 977, 108 S. Ct. 2777, 101 L. Ed. 2d 827 (1988). In that case, an\n\nAfrican American employee of a bank alleged that she had been rejected\n\nin favor of white applicants for four supervisory positions at the bank.\n\nId. at 982, 108 S. Ct. at 2782, 101 L. Ed. 2d at 837.        In Watson, all\n\nparticipating members of the Supreme Court held that a claim could be\n\nbrought based upon the exercise of subjective discretion, but the court\n\nsplit sharply on the contours and scope of such a disparate impact\n\nclaim. Compare id. at 991–99, 108 S. Ct. at 2787–91, 101 L. Ed. 2d at\n\n843–48 (plurality opinion), with id. at 1000–11, 108 S. Ct. at 2792–98,\n\f                                      17\n\n101 L. Ed. 2d at 849–56 (Blackmun, J., concurring in part and\n\nconcurring in judgment).\n\n      Speaking for four members of the Court, Justice O’Connor laid out\n\nthe stark alternatives presented by the parties.              According to the\n\nplaintiffs, if disparate impact analysis were confined to objective tests, an\n\nemployer would be able to simply substitute subjective criteria having\n\nsubstantially identical effects. Id. at 989, 108 S. Ct. at 2786, 101 L. Ed.\n\n2d at 841 (plurality opinion). If so, Griggs would be a dead letter. Id. On\n\nthe other hand, according to the defendants, recognizing a claim of\n\ndisparate impact in a subjective selection process would make the claims\n\nso impossibly difficult to defend that employers would be forced to adopt\n\nnumerical quotas in order to avoid liability.         Id. at 989, 108 S. Ct. at\n\n2786, 101 L. Ed. 2d at 842.\n\n      Justice O’Connor seemed to agree with the arguments of both\n\nparties. In section IIB of her opinion, which was joined by all members of\n\nthe Court, she recognized that Griggs “could largely be nullified if\n\ndisparate impact analysis were applied only to standardized selection\n\npractices.”   Id. She further wrote that disparate impact analysis is in\n\nprinciple “no less applicable to subjective employment criteria than to\n\nobjective or standardized tests.” Id. at 990, 108 S. Ct. at 2786, 101 L.\n\nEd. 2d at 842.        In addition, Justice O’Connor observed that while an\n\nemployer’s policy of leaving promotion decisions to unchecked discretion\n\nof   lower    level   supervisors   should   itself   raise   no   inference   of\n\ndiscriminatory conduct, it does not follow that “supervisors to whom this\n\ndiscretion is delegated always act without discriminatory intent.” Id. In\n\naddition, in an observation of particular interest in this case, Justice\n\nO’Connor noted that even without overt discriminatory intent, “the\n\f                                          18\n\nproblem of subconscious stereotypes and prejudices would remain.” Id.\n\nat 990, 108 S. Ct. at 2787, 101 L. Ed. 2d at 842.\n\n       Justice O’Connor then turned to the employer’s concern in parts\n\nIIC and IID of her opinion. Now writing for only four members of the\n\nCourt, she pivoted to express concerns about the use of “bare statistics”\n\nin a subjective decision-making case that an employer could rebut only\n\nupon a showing of “business necessity” or “job relatedness.” Id. at 991–\n\n93, 108 S. Ct. at 2787–88, 101 L. Ed. 2d at 843–44 (citations and\n\ninternal quotation marks omitted).                She expressed concern that\n\nemployers would find it difficult to validate subjective selection criteria\n\nand impossible to defend and, as a result, would engage in a\n\nsurreptitious quota system. Id. at 992–93, 108 S. Ct. at 2787–88, 101 L.\n\nEd. 2d at 843–44. She observed that it would be “completely unrealistic\n\nto assume that unlawful discrimination is the sole cause of people failing\n\nto gravitate to jobs and employers in accord with the laws of chance.” Id.\n\nat 992, 108 S. Ct. at 2787, 101 L. Ed. 2d at 843. She further noted that\n\n“[i]t would be equally unrealistic to suppose that employers can\n\neliminate, or discover . . ., the myriad of innocent causes that may lead\n\nto statistical imbalances” in the workplace. Id.\n\n       To avoid impossible defenses and surreptitious quotas, Justice\n\nO’Conner went well beyond the question posed in the petition for writ of\n\ncertiorari5 to undertake what she called a “fresh and somewhat closer\n\n\n       5The  question posed in the Petition for Writ of Certiorari was: “Is the racially\nadverse impact of an employer’s practice of simply committing employment decisions to\nthe unchecked discretion of a white supervisory corps subject to the test of Griggs v.\nDuke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424 [91 S. Ct. 849, 28 L. Ed. 2d 158] (1971)?” 487 U.S. at\n1011, 108 S. Ct. at 2797, 101 L. Ed. 2d at 856 (Stevens, J., concurring). Justice\nStevens, in a separate opinion concurring with the judgment, considered it unwise for\nthe court to engage in a “fresh” interpretation of prior cases in light of the narrow\nquestion presented. See id. at 1011, 108 S. Ct. at 2797–98, 101 L. Ed. 2d at 856.\n\f                                     19\n\nexamination” of the evidentiary standards that apply in disparate impact\n\ncases. Id. at 994, 108 S. Ct. at 2788, 101 L. Ed. 2d at 844. She began\n\nby emphasizing that a plaintiff must identify a “specific employment\n\npractice” that is challenged. Id. at 994, 108 S. Ct. at 2788, 101 L. Ed. 2d\n\nat 845. She then turned to causation. Id. at 994–95, 108 S. Ct. at 2789,\n\n101 L. Ed. 2d at 845. She emphasized that statistical disparities must\n\nbe “sufficiently substantial that they raise . . . an inference of causation.”\n\nId. at 995, 108 S. Ct. at 2789, 101 L. Ed. 2d at 845.          In a footnote,\n\nJustice O’Connor noted that lower courts have sometimes looked to the\n\nEEOC’s Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures and\n\nadopted an enforcement rule that an inference of discrimination could\n\nnot be drawn unless members of a particular race, sex or ethic group are\n\nselected at a rate less than four-fifths of the group with the highest\n\nselection rating. Id. at 995 n.3, 108 S. Ct. at 2789 n.3, 101 L. Ed. 2d at\n\n845 n.3.   Justice O’Connor noted that this method “has not provided\n\nmore than a rule of thumb for the courts.” Id.\n\n      Justice O’Connor next cautioned that courts should not assume\n\n“that plaintiffs’ statistical evidence is reliable.” Id. at 996, 108 S. Ct. at\n\n2790, 101 L. Ed. 2d at 846. According to Justice O’Connor, weaknesses\n\ncan include small or incomplete data sets, inadequate statistical\n\ntechniques, and applicant pools “containing individuals lacking minimal\n\nqualifications.” Id. at 996–97, 108 S. Ct. at 2790, 101 L. Ed. 2d at 846.\n\nJustice O’Connor thus stressed that in disparate impact cases,\n\nemployers have the opportunity to attack the quality of the plaintiff’s\n\nstatistical evidence and the inferences that may be drawn from it. Id. at\n\n996–97, 108 S. Ct. at 2790, 101 L. Ed. 2d at 846–47.\n\n      Justice O’Connor next turned to the nature of the business\n\nnecessity defense. Id. at 997–98, 108 S. Ct. at 2790–91, 101 L. Ed. 2d at\n\f                                     20\n\n847.    Although Griggs stated that the burden of showing business\n\nnecessity rested with the defendant, Justice O’Connor wrote that the\n\nburden of proving discrimination always rests with the plaintiff at all\n\ntimes. Id. at 997, 108 S. Ct. at 2790, 101 L. Ed. 2d at 847. According to\n\nJustice O’Connor, the plaintiff now had the burden of showing other\n\ntests or selection devices would serve the employer’s legitimate interest.\n\nId. at 998, 108 S. Ct. at 2790, 101 L. Ed. 2d at 847.\n\n       Justice Blackmun, joined by two colleagues, took exception to\n\nJustice O’Connor’s notion that the burden of proof and production in\n\ndisparate impact cases remained with the plaintiff on the business\n\nnecessity defense. Id. at 1002–03, 108 S. Ct. at 2793, 101 L. Ed. 2d at\n\n850 (Blackmun, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment).\n\nJustice Blackmun maintained that in disparate impact cases, a prima\n\nfacie case is established by showing a significant statistical disparity. Id.\n\nat 1004, 108 S. Ct. at 2794, 101 L. Ed. 2d at 851. Once an employment\n\npractice is shown to have discriminatory consequences, according to\n\nJustice Blackmun, an employer can escape liability only if it persuades\n\nthe court that the selection process has “a manifest relationship to the\n\nemployment in question.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). Even if\n\nsuch a relationship is present, according to Justice Blackmun, the\n\nplaintiff may show that “other selection processes that have a lesser\n\ndiscriminatory effect could also serve . . . the employer’s [legitimate]\n\nbusiness needs.” Id. at 1005–06, 108 S. Ct. at 2795, 101 L. Ed. 2d at\n\n852.\n\n       Justice Blackmun was also concerned about language in Justice\n\nO’Connor’s opinion suggesting that “[i]n the context of subjective or\n\ndiscretionary employment decisions, the employer will often find it easier\n\nthan in the case of standardized tests to produce evidence of a manifest\n\f                                    21\n\nrelationship to the employment in question.” Id. at 1006, 108 S. Ct. at\n\n2795, 101 L. Ed. 2d at 853 (internal quotation marks omitted). Justice\n\nBlackmun asserted that “[a]llowing an employer to escape liability simply\n\nby articulating vague, inoffensive-sounding subjective criteria would [do\n\na disservice to the federal statute]’s goal of eradicating discrimination in\n\nemployment.” Id. at 1009, 108 S. Ct. at 2797, 101 L. Ed. 2d at 855.\n\n      In sum, the Watson opinions clearly stood for the proposition that\n\ndisparate impact could, at least in some circumstances, apply to\n\nsubjective employer decision-making. An evenly divided court, however,\n\nhad different visions of the scope and contour of disparate impact\n\nanalysis on subjective decision-making.     The plurality, joining Justice\n\nO’Connor, was prepared to modify the burdens of proof in order to\n\nenhance the ability of an employer to defend disparate impact claims\n\narising from subjective decision-making, while Justice Blackmun feared\n\nthe modification of law proposed by Justice O’Connor would provide an\n\nescape hatch for employers from potential liability.\n\n      4. Wards Cove: Narrow construction prevails. A year after Watson\n\nwas decided, the Supreme Court decided Wards Cove Packing Co. v.\n\nAtonio, 490 U.S. 642, 109 S. Ct. 2115, 104 L. Ed. 2d 733 (1989),\n\nsuperseded by statute on other grounds, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e–2(k), as\n\nrecognized in Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. __, 131 S. Ct.\n\n2541, 180 L. Ed. 2d 374 (2011). In that case, Justice Kennedy, who did\n\nnot participate in Watson, tipped the balance. In Wards Cove, Justice\n\nKennedy joined an opinion by Justice White which essentially converted\n\nthe approach of the plurality opinion of Justice O’Connor in Watson into\n\na majority opinion in Wards Cove.\n\n      Wards Cove dealt with employment practices of two companies\n\nthat operated salmon canneries in remote areas of Alaska during the\n\f                                   22\n\nsalmon runs in the summer months. Id. at 646, 109 S. Ct. at 2119, 104\n\nL. Ed. 2d at 744. Jobs at the canneries fell into two general categories,\n\n“cannery jobs” and “noncannery jobs.” Id. at 647, 109 S. Ct. at 2119,\n\n104 L. Ed. 2d at 745.     Most cannery jobs were nonskilled positions,\n\nwhile, conversely, most noncannery jobs were classified as skilled\n\npositions. Id. The cannery jobs were filed predominantly by nonwhites,\n\nwhile the noncannery jobs were filled predominantly with white workers.\n\nId. at 647, 109 S. Ct. at 2119–20, 104 L. Ed. 2d at 745. The canneries\n\noperated separate dormitories and separate mess halls for the cannery\n\nand noncannery workers. Id. at 647, 109 S. Ct. at 2120, 104 L. Ed. 2d\n\nat 745.    The district court found in favor of the defendants on all\n\ndisparate impact claims, and a panel of the Court of Appeals for the\n\nNinth Circuit affirmed, but an en banc hearing of the Ninth Circuit held\n\nthat “[o]nce the plaintiff . . . has shown disparate impact caused by\n\nspecific, identifiable employment practices or criteria, the burden shifts\n\nto the employer.” Id. at 648, 109 S. Ct. at 2120, 104 L. Ed. 2d at 746\n\n(internal citations omitted). On remand to the original panel, the court\n\nheld that the plaintiffs had made out a prima facie case of disparate\n\nimpact in hiring for both skilled and unskilled noncannery positions and\n\nremanded the case to the district court to determine if the employer\n\ncould meet its burden of showing business necessity. Id. at 649, 109 S.\n\nCt. at 2120, 104 L. Ed. 2d at 746. Because the case raised issues upon\n\nwhich the Court was evenly divided in Watson, the Supreme Court\n\ngranted certiorari. Id. at 649–50, 109 S. Ct. at 2121, 104 L. Ed. 2d at\n\n747.\n\n       As previously mentioned, the majority opinion by Justice White in\n\nWards Cove basically converted Justice O’Connor’s plurality opinion in\n\nWatson into a majority opinion. Compare Watson, 487 U.S. at 982–1000,\n\f                                    23\n\n108 S. Ct. at 2782–92, 101 L. Ed. 2d at 837–48 (plurality opinion), with\n\nWards Cove, 490 U.S. at 645–61, 109 S. Ct. at 2118–27, 104 L. Ed. 2d at\n\n744–54.    The conversion of Justice O’Connor’s views from plurality\n\nopinion to precedent drew a sharp rejoinder from the minority. Justice\n\nBlackmun, ruing the outcome, declared that “a bare majority of the\n\nCourt takes three major strides backwards in the battle against race\n\ndiscrimination.” Wards Cove, 490 U.S. at 661, 109 S. Ct. at 2127, 104 L.\n\nEd. 2d at 754 (Blackmun, J., dissenting). He questioned “whether the\n\nmajority still believes that race discrimination—or, more accurately, race\n\ndiscrimination against nonwhites—is a problem in our society, or even\n\nremembers that it ever was.” Id. at 662, 109 S. Ct. at 2127, 104 L. Ed.\n\n2d at 755. Justice Stevens’ dissent emphasized the role of federal courts\n\nand agencies in promoting the national goal of “eliminating barriers that\n\ndefine economic opportunity not by aptitude and ability but by race,\n\ncolor, national origin, and other traits that are easily identified but\n\nutterly irrelevant to one’s qualification for a particular job.” Id. at 662–\n\n63, 109 S. Ct. at 2128, 104 L. Ed. 2d at 755 (Stevens, J., dissenting).\n\nAccording to Justice Stevens, “The changes the majority makes today,\n\ntipping the scales in favor of employers, are not faithful to [established\n\ndisparate impact] principles.” Id. at 673, 109 S. Ct. at 2133, 104 L. Ed.\n\n2d at 762.   Even for an often divided Supreme Court, the holdings in\n\nWards Cove can only be characterized as bitterly contested.\n\n      It should be emphasized that nothing in the language of Title VII\n\ncompelled the result in Wards Cove or the position of the dissents.\n\nInstead, as one commentator has noted, the battle over proper\n\ninterpretation   of   open-ended    language   of   Title   VII   was   over\n\nunderstandings about “whether discrimination is still happening” in the\n\nmodern workplace, about “how it manifests itself,” and about how society\n\f                                     24\n\nshould address such concerns. See Sandra F. Sperino, Revitalizing State\n\nEmployment Discrimination Law, 20 Geo. Mason L. Rev. 545, 546 (2013)\n\n[hereinafter Sperino, Revitalizing]. It seems fair to say that the majority\n\non the Supreme Court saw racial discrimination in employment as\n\nprimarily a relic of the past that does not require broad remedial\n\nmeasures, while the minority saw racial discrimination more like an\n\nintractable and enduring part of the American landscape.\n\n      5.     The Civil Rights Act of 1991: Congress reacts to narrow\n\nconstruction by the Supreme Court.        Because it was decided over two\n\ndecades ago, it is easy to forget the controversy that Wards Cove\n\nengendered.    Civil rights advocates were outraged by the decision and\n\nother decisions of what seemed to be an increasingly hostile Supreme\n\nCourt.     The decision in Wards Cove was compared to the 1883 Civil\n\nRights Cases and was said to foretell the end of the Second\n\nReconstruction that commenced with Brown v. Board of Education, 347\n\nU.S. 483, 74 S. Ct. 686, 98 L. Ed. 873 (1954), and the passage of the\n\nCivil Rights Act of 1964.     See Robert Belton, The Dismantling of the\n\nGriggs Disparate Impact Theory and the Future of Title VII: The Need for a\n\nThird Reconstruction, 8 Yale L. & Pol’y Rev. 223, 247–49 (1990).\n\n      In response, Congress passed legislation overruling Wards Cove\n\nand other 1989 Supreme Court rulings in the Civil Rights Act of 1990.\n\nS. 2104, 101st Cong. (1990); see 136 Cong. Rec. S991–01 (1990)\n\n(statement of Sen. Kennedy) (“In the past year, however, the Supreme\n\nCourt has issued a series of rulings that mark an abrupt and\n\nunfortunate departure from its historic vigilance in protecting civil rights.\n\n...   The Civil Rights Act of 1990 is intended to overturn these Court\n\ndecisions and restore and strengthen these basic laws.”); see also\n\nPhilip S.

President Bush, however, vetoed the measure.\n\n136 Cong. Rec. S16,562 (1990) (recording President Bush’s veto).

The most important of these\n      Supreme Court decisions was Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio, 490 U.S.\n      642 (1989). . . . Other important cases included: Patterson v. McLean\n      Credit Union, [491 U.S. 164, 188, 109 S. Ct. 2363, 2379, 105 L. Ed. 2d\n      132, 158 (1989)] (holding that discrimination in the performance of\n      employment contracts is not prohibited explicitly under existing federal\n      law); Lorance v. AT&T Technologies, Inc., [490 U.S. 900, 911, 109 S. Ct.\n      2261, 2268, 104 L.

See\n\nRunkel, 35 Wm. & Mary L. Rev. at 1198. In the end, after an intense\n\nperiod of diplomacy between warring factions, Congress passed the Civil\n\nRights Act of 1991. Pub. L. No. 102-166, 105 Stat. 1071 (1991) (codified\n\nat 42 U.S.C. § 2000e to 2000e-16 (Supp. III 1991)).     According to the\n\nstatute, the purpose of the Act was “to codify the concepts of ‘business\nnecessity’ and ‘job related’ enunciated by the Supreme Court in Griggs v.\n\nDuke Power Co., . . . and in other Supreme Court decisions prior to\n\nWards Cove Packing Co.” and to “respond to recent decisions of the\n\nSupreme Court by expanding the scope of relevant civil rights statutes in\n\norder to provide adequate protection to victims of discrimination.”   Id.\n\n§ 3(2), (4). The Act also addressed the Wards Cove ruling regarding the\n\ngeneral requirement of identification of particular employment practices.\n\nId. § 105(a) (codified at 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)(1)).    While Congress\n\ngenerally required that a plaintiff identify particular employment\n\npractices that cause disparate impact, Congress also provided that the\n\ndecision-making process could be challenged as a whole under certain\n\ncircumstances. Specifically, Congress provided:\n\f                                      27\n      With respect to demonstrating that a particular employment\n      practice causes a disparate impact . . . the complaining party\n      shall demonstrate that each particular challenged\n      employment practice causes a disparate impact, except that\n      if the complaining party can demonstrate to the court that\n      the elements of a respondent’s decisionmaking process are\n      not capable of separation for analysis, the decisionmaking\n      process may be analyzed as one employment practice.\n\nId. § 105(a) (codified at 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)(1)(B)(i)).\n\n      The language in the Civil Rights Act of 1991 did not include the\n\nspecific language regarding record keeping that was present in the\n\nunsuccessful Civil Rights Act of 1990, but the general language used in\n\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1991 to establish an exception to the identification\n\nof particular employment practices was stated in terms broad enough to\n\ncover situations where an employer fails to keep records.\n\n      6. Wal-Mart: Sharp divisions again.        The last significant United\n\nStates Supreme Court case regarding disparate impact is Wal-Mart\n\nStores. In this case, the Supreme Court considered a nationwide class\n\naction brought by female employees on behalf of some 1.5 million current\n\nand former female employees of Wal-Mart stores. Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at\n\n___, 131 S. Ct. at 2547, 180 L. Ed. 2d at 385. The employees claimed\n\nthat local Wal-Mart managers exercised their discretion over pay and\n\npromotions disproportionately in favor of men, causing an unlawful\n\ndisparate impact under the Federal Civil Rights Act.          Id.   The district\n\ncourt certified the class and the Ninth Circuit affirmed. Id. at ___, 131 S.\n\nCt. at 2549, 180 L. Ed. 2d at 388.\n\n      On appeal, a bare majority of the Supreme Court reversed. In an\n\nopinion written by Justice Scalia, the majority held that the class should\n\nnot have been certified under the applicable federal rules. Id. at ___, 131\n\nS. Ct. at 2556–57, 180 L. Ed. 2d at 395–96.            The class certification\n\nquestion, however, was intertwined with the merits of the case. Id. at\n\f                                    28\n\n___, 131 S. Ct. at 2552, 180 L. Ed. 2d at 391. Justice Scalia stressed\n\nthat allowing discretion by local managers is the opposite of a uniform\n\npattern or practice that would provide commonality needed for a class\n\naction.   Id. at ___, 131 S. Ct. at 2554, 180 L. Ed. 2d at 392. Justice\n\nScalia noted that “[i]n a company of Wal-Mart’s size and geographic\n\nscope, it is quite unbelievable that all managers would exercise their\n\ndiscretion in a common way without some common direction.” Id. at ___,\n\n131 S. Ct. at 2555, 180 L. Ed. 2d at 393. Justice Scalia rejected the\n\n“social framework analysis” as not offering a sufficient basis for finding\n\ncommonality across the class. Id. at ___, 131 S. Ct. at 2554–55, 180 L.\n\nEd. 2d at 393.      According to Justice Scalia, “Other than the bare\n\nexistence of delegated discretion, respondents have identified no ‘specific\n\nemployment practice’—much less one that ties all their 1.5 million claims\n\ntogether.”   Id. at ___, 131 S. Ct. at 2555–56, 180 L. Ed. 2d at 394.\n\nAccording to Justice Scalia, “Merely showing that Wal-Mart’s policy of\n\ndiscretion has produced an overall sex-based disparity does not suffice.”\n\nId. at ___, 131 S. Ct. at 2556, 180 L. Ed. 2d at 394.\n\n      Justice Ginsburg dissented in part and was joined by Justices\n\nBreyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan. Id. at ___, 131 S. Ct. at 2561, 180 L. Ed.\n\n2d at 400 (Ginsburg, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).\n\nJustice Ginsburg adopted the framework embraced in the Civil Rights\n\nAct of 1991, but applied that framework in a fashion different than the\n\nmajority. According to Justice Ginsburg, the district court had identified\n\n“systems for . . . promoting in-store employees that were sufficiently\n\nsimilar across regions and stores to conclude that the manner in which\n\nthese systems affect the class raises issues that are common to all class\n\nmembers.” Id. at ___, 131 S. Ct. at 2563, 180 L. Ed. 2d at 402 (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted). Justice Ginsburg wrote that “[t]he practice of\n\f                                     29\n\ndelegating to supervisors large discretion to make personnel decisions,\n\nuncontrolled by formal standards, has long been known to have the\n\npotential to produce disparate effects.” Id. at ___, 131 S. Ct. at 2564, 180\n\nL. Ed. 2d at 403.     Citing Watson and Wards Cove, Justice Ginsburg\n\nstressed that “[a]ware of ‘the problem of subconscious stereotypes and\n\nprejudices,’ we held that the ‘employer’s undisciplined system of\n\nsubjective decisionmaking’ was an ‘employment practice’ that ‘may be\n\nanalyzed under the disparate impact approach.’ ” Id. at ___, 131 S. Ct. at\n\n2565, 180 L. Ed. 2d at 404 (quoting Watson, 487 U.S. at 990–91, 108 S.\n\nCt. at 2777, 101 L. Ed. 2d at 842–43). Justice Ginsburg noted that the\n\nplaintiffs had offered statistical evidence that showed, after controlling\n\nfor factors including “job performance, length of time with the company,\n\nand the store where an employee worked,” there was a sufficient\n\nstatistical basis to give rise to an inference of discrimination. Id. at ___,\n\n131 S. Ct. at 2564, 180 L. Ed. 2d at 403.\n\n      D.     Treatment of Disparate Impact Analysis Under the Iowa\n\nCivil Rights Act. We have had only a few occasions to consider cases\n\nunder the Iowa Civil Rights Act when disparate impact claims were\n\npresented.     See, e.g., Hy-Vee Food Stores, Inc. v. Iowa Civil Rights\n\nComm’n, 453 N.W.2d 512, 517–19 (1990); Wilson-Sinclair Co. v. Griggs,\n\n211 N.W.2d 133, 140–41 (Iowa 1973). In those cases, the parties did not\n\nargue that state law should be interpreted differently than federal law.\n\nNonetheless, it is generally true that “Iowa courts have traditionally\n\nlooked to federal law for guidance in interpreting” the Iowa Civil Rights\n\nAct. Pecenka v. Fareway Stores, Inc., 672 N.W.2d 800, 803 (Iowa 2003).\n\nWe are, however, “not bound by federal law, despite consistent utilization\n\nof the federal analytical framework.”     Id. (citing Hulme v. Barrett, 449\n\nN.W.2d 629, 631 (Iowa 1989)).\n\f                                   30\n\n      We have not, however, explicitly adopted under state law either the\n\nteaching of Wards Cove or Wal-Mart. It is true that in Hy-Vee, we cited\n\nWards Cove in describing the differences between discriminatory\n\ntreatment and discriminatory impact cases. See Hy-Vee, 453 N.W.2d at\n\n518–19. We did not, however, adopt the holdings in Wards Cove lock,\n\nstock, and barrel, and in no case has a party asked us to consider the\n\nmerits of the minority opinion in Wards Cove or some other approach\n\nunder the Iowa Civil Rights Act.     In Hy-Vee, there was no question\n\nregarding the presence of a particular discriminatory practice, namely,\n\nthe sexual segregation of stocker and checker positions. See id. at 520.\n\n      Similarly, with respect to Wal-Mart, we have had no occasion to\n\nconsider whether the majority or minority opinion in this 5–4 decision\n\nhas the most persuasive power. We thus have a number of interpretive\n\noptions under the Iowa Civil Rights Act. Do we follow the majority or the\n\nminority in Wards Cove or Wal-Mart? Or, do we follow a third path?\n\n      While Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1991 in response to\n\nWards Cove, no similar amendment has been made to the Iowa Civil\n\nRights Act.    The fact that Congress enacted a legislative change in\n\nresponse to a binding majority opinion of the United States Supreme\n\nCourt does not have persuasive force in the interpretation of the Iowa\n\nCivil Rights Act. We have not adopted the principles of Wards Cove in\n\nthe construction of the Iowa Civil Rights Act and are not bound to do so.\n\nCongressional reaction to a specific case decided by the United States\n\nSupreme Court does not shed light on the meaning of state law when\n\nthere has been no comparable narrow state court precedent to stimulate\n\na legislative override.\n\n      E. Academic Literature on Disparate Impact in the Setting of\n\nSubjective Decision-Making.      There is a body of literature grappling\n\f                                     31\n\nwith disparate impact theory in the context of subjective decision-\n\nmaking.     In a ground breaking article in 1993, David Benjamin\n\nOppenheimer suggested that negligence theory might be a basis for\n\ndisparate impact theory.     See David Benjamin Oppenheimer, Negligent\n\nDiscrimination, 141 U. Pa. L. Rev. 899, 899 (1993) (examining\n\n“psychological and sociological data on racism [to] demonstrate why\n\ndiscrimination is more closely analogous to negligent conduct than it is\n\nto intentional conduct”). This article has spawned significant offspring in\n\nthe literature.    See generally, e.g., Elizabeth Tippett, Robbing a Barren\n\nVault: The Implications of Dukes v. Wal-Mart for Cases Challenging\n\nSubjective Employment Practices, 29 Hofstra Lab. & Emp. L.J. 433\n\n(2012).\n\n      There is reason to believe that at least some members of the United\n\nStates Supreme Court might be interested in negligence theory in the\n\ncontext of subjective decision-making. At oral argument in the Wal-Mart\n\nmatter, Justice Kennedy and Justice Roberts asked questions about\n\nwhether the plaintiff was advancing a “notice theory,” namely, that an\n\nemployer aware of the discriminatory impact of its subjective practices\n\nmay be liable under the Federal Civil Rights Act. See Deborah M. Weiss,\n\nA Grudging Defense of Wal-Mart v. Dukes, 24 Yale J.L. & Feminism 119,\n\n123 (2012).       The plaintiffs’ lawyer apparently walked away from the\n\ntheory.   See id. at 123, 167–68 (advocating a notice liability approach\n\nwhen an employer is aware of problems and does not fashion an\n\nappropriate remedy).\n\n      IV. Discussion of Specific Employment Practice and Incapable\nof Separation for Analysis Issues.\n\n      A. Positions of the Parties.\n\f                                        32\n\n       1. The plaintiffs.    The plaintiffs generally claim that the district\n\ncourt erred in finding that the plaintiffs failed to show that the State’s job\n\nselection process was not capable of separation for analysis. According\n\nto the plaintiffs, the primary issue on appeal is “whether Defendants’\n\ncommon hiring and promotion system permitted [the Plaintiffs] to\n\nperform statistical analysis of [selection methods or protection practices]\n\nor elements of decision-making.”\n\n       In support of their argument, the plaintiffs claim that the\n\ndefendants failed to properly record the use or lack of use of any specific\n\nemployment practices applied by any of the thirty-seven executive\n\nbranch departments, thus making a statistical analysis of any separate\n\nelement impossible. The plaintiffs challenge both the lack of aggregate\n\ndata   maintained    by     DAS   and   the    underlying   documentation    in\n\ndepartment hiring files.\n\n       The plaintiffs point out that DAS is responsible for the oversight of\n\nmerit and affirmative action in employment.            Yet, according to the\n\nplaintiffs, the information maintained by DAS did not contain data\n\nsufficient to allow analysis of specific employment practices.              The\n\nplaintiffs note that the district court correctly found that “DAS retains no\n\ndata, computerized or otherwise, that allows one to see how a certain\n\nperson was screened and/or scored as compared to another applicant by\n\na department.”      Thus, the information maintained by DAS was not\n\ncapable of separation for analysis because you could not compare the\n\ntreatment of one applicant to another in any objective way, a necessary\n\nfoundation in aggregate statistical analysis.\n\n       The plaintiffs then turn to the underlying, hard copy records\n\nmaintained by the departments.               The plaintiffs note that under\n\napplicable administrative regulations, agencies are required to\n\f                                     33\n      keep records as required by the director . . . [which] shall, at\n      a minimum, include tracking of the composition of applicant\n      groups, their movement through steps in the hiring\n      processes, and the impact of personnel actions on various\n      group members when records are not otherwise available in\n      centralized information systems.\n\nIowa Admin. Code r. 11—68.2(3).\n\n      Yet, the plaintiffs assert that the record shows that the underlying\n\ndepartment records are inadequate for three reasons. First, many of the\n\nunderlying employment files simply have missing documents. Second,\n\nmany of the underlying files reveal that the agencies did not create\n\ndocuments in the first place showing why employees were chosen or not\n\nchosen after having been screened by DAS and being minimally qualified\n\nfor the position. Finally, the plaintiffs assert that the agencies did not\n\napply common standards when scoring systems were used to evaluate\n\napplicants.\n\n      In support of their claim that the departmental records were\n\ninadequate to allow separation for analysis by a specific employment\n\npractice, the plaintiffs cite two types of evidence in the record. First, the\n\nplaintiffs point to admissions in the record by state employees or agents.\n\nWhen consultant CPS conducted a review of state hiring practices for the\n\nState in 2007, it noted that files it reviewed “were not complete and did\n\nnot indicate why some applicants were interviewed and others were not.”\n\nCPS declared that its studies confirmed that the selection of persons for\n\ninterviews from DAS lists of minimally qualified applicants created “a\n\nrebuttable inference of adverse impact” but noted that inconsistencies in\n\nthe State’s records within the same department prevented a more\n\ndetailed analysis.   When DAS attempted to do an employment audit\n\npursuant to Executive Order No. 4, DAS officials indicated that they\n\nfound more lack of documentation than CPS.          See Exec. Order No. 4\n\f                                       34\n\n(2007),    available        at   http://www.statelibraryofiowa.org/services/\n\ncollections/law-library/govexecorders/copy_of_execordculver.       Further,\n\nwhile Executive Order No. 4, among other things, required agencies to\n\nassess the impact of screening methods on employee groups in the\n\nselection process, see id., a DAS official, when asked if DAS was\n\nincapable of complying with Executive Order No. 4, responded, “Right.\n\nWe needed to do more.” Ultimately, DAS abandoned its effort to conduct\n\nan audit in compliance with Executive Order No. 4.\n\n      Second, the plaintiffs analyzed the 667 hiring files produced by the\n\nState in discovery.     The plaintiffs assert that an analysis of the files\n\nreveals that fifty percent did not include résumé review screening\n\ndevices, over one in ten did not include interview questions, nearly one in\n\nfive did not include interview notes, and over twenty-five percent did not\n\ninclude an interview scoring matrix.\n\n      The plaintiffs recognize that the aggregate data can be divided into\n\nsmaller parts. The plaintiffs concede that it is possible to sort the data\n\nby Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) job category, by year, and by\n\nstep in the hiring process. But the plaintiffs maintain that such division\n\nof the data into smaller units does not anchor the statistical analysis in\n\nspecific employment practices, but simply lessens the size of the sample\n\nfor statistical analysis.\n\n      In other words, stacking documents by year does not help focus on\n\nan employment practice nor does stacking documents by EEO job\n\ncategory or step in the hiring process. The main effect of such slicing\n\nand dicing is to lessen the size of the sample, thereby reducing the power\n\nof aggregate statistical analysis without achieving any increase in focus.\n\n      In short, the plaintiffs claim they did the best they could with the\n\navailable data and that the aggregate analysis of disparate impact was\n\f                                    35\n\n“as specific as the choices the employer permitted.”        Based on the\n\naggregate data, they point out that the racial disparity in the hiring of\n\napplicants deemed qualified for the job by DAS was statistically\n\nsignificant and that the likelihood of the result occurring in a race-\n\nneutral environment was as much as two billion to one, depending on\n\nthe data set used. Further, the plaintiffs assert that the record showed\n\nthat African Americans would have a forty percent better chance of being\n\nhired or promoted if they were white.\n\n      The plaintiffs point to Port Authority Police Asian Jade Society v.\n\nPort Authority, in support of their argument.      681 F. Supp. 2d 456\n\n(S.D.N.Y. 2010).   In that case, the district court held that because an\n\nemployer failed to maintain records, “the role of each step cannot be\n\ndetermined, [and] the steps cannot be examined separately to discover\n\nwhether a particular step causes a disparate impact.” Id. at 464. The\n\nplaintiffs further connect the disparate impact shown by their statistics\n\nwith the lack of accountability in the State’s personnel system.      They\n\npoint out that their experts testified that accountability is an important\n\naspect of integrated employment standards working to prevent biased or\n\ninvalid decision-making.\n\n      Finally, in addition to lack of record keeping, the plaintiffs note\n\nthat the subjective manner in which the State makes its personnel\n\ndecisions prevents separation for analysis of more specific personnel\n\npractices. See Watson, 487 U.S. at 989–90, 108 S. Ct. at 2786, 101 L.\n\nEd. 2d at 841–42.    The plaintiffs cite Watson for the proposition that\n\nwhere an employment system combines objective and subjective\n\nfeatures, it should be considered subjective in nature because of the\n\nripple effect of subjective practices. See id. According to the plaintiffs,\n\f                                    36\n\nunder Watson, subjective features can be analyzed as one practice under\n\ndisparate impact analysis.\n\n      In support of its assertion that decision-making processes that\n\ncombine objective and subjective decision-making should be considered\n\nas one employment practice under federal law, the plaintiffs cite Stender\n\nv. Lucky Stores, Inc., 803 F. Supp. 259, 335–36 (N.D. Cal. 1992) and\n\nMcClain v. Lufkin Industries, Inc., 187 F.R.D. 267, 275 (E.D. Tex. 1999).\n\n      In Stender, the district court considered a class action brought by\n\nAfrican American and female employees working in the approximately\n\n150 to 185 retail stores within Lucky’s Northern California Food Division.\n\n803 F. Supp. at 266, 267. The Stender court declared that the plaintiff\n\nneed not identify a particular employment practice “[w]here the system of\n\npromotion is pervaded by a lack of uniform criteria, criteria that are\n\nsubjective as well as variable, discretionary placements and promotions,\n\nthe failure to follow set procedures and the absence of written policies or\n\njustifications for promotional decisions.” Id. at 335.\n\n      In support of its opinion, the Stender court cited Allen v. Seidman,\n\n881 F.2d 375 (7th Cir. 1989).        Stender, 803 F. Supp. at 335.          In\n\nSeidman, the court considered a Title VII challenge brought by black\n\nbank examiners employed by the FDIC. 881 F.2d at 378. The plaintiffs\n\nchallenged a program evaluation test, which only thirty-nine percent of\n\nthe African American candidates passed compared to eighty-four percent\n\nof the white candidates. Id. No regression analysis was performed. Id.\n\nat 380. Judge Posner wrote that the statistics alone, without any further\n\nproof, established a prima facie case. Id. He noted that where “there has\n\nbeen a full trial, the issue of prima facie case drops out, and the question\n\nbecomes whether the judge is persuaded that the test or other challenged\n\f                                     37\n\npractice is discriminatory because it has a disparate impact unjustified\n\nby the defendant’s legitimate business needs.” Id. at 379.\n\n       In Lufkin, the district court considered the issue of class\n\ncertification in a case where African Americans sued an employer on a\n\ndisparate impact theory.       Lufkin, 187 F.R.D. at 272.         Candidly\n\ncharacterizing the law as “complex and convoluted,” the district court\n\ncanvassed the law on disparate impact claims. Id. at 271, 272–75. With\n\nrespect to the identification of employment practices, the district\n\nrecognized that under the Civil Rights Act of 1991, a plaintiff was\n\nrequired to demonstrate that “ ‘each particular challenged employment\n\npractice causes a disparate impact’ ” except where an employer’s\n\ndecision-making process is “ ‘not capable of separation for analysis.’ ” Id.\n\nat 272 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)(1)(B)(i)). The Lufkin court noted\n\nthat under Lufkin’s employment process, “[a] broad array of . . .\n\nemployment practices rest on . . . subjective decision making” both in\n\ncentral administration and within each division of the company. Id. at\n\n273.   As in this case, applicants are channeled through a centralized\n\nhuman resources department where candidates who meet the objective\n\nminimum criteria for jobs are forwarded to management employees for\n\napproval unguided by any objective standards. See id. The district court\n\nfurther noted that “[t]he pervasive subjective decision-making process\n\ninteracts with other facially neutral employment conditions to the\n\ndisadvantage of African-Americans” through a ripple effect. Id. at 274.\n\nConcluding “Lufkin’s subjective employment practices [were] inextricably\n\nintertwined,” the district court held that elements of the respondent’s\n\ndecision-making process were not capable of separation of analysis for\n\npurposes of class certification. Id. at 275.\n\f                                     38\n\n      2. The State.    The State begins its discussion by asserting that\n\nwhether the State’s decision-making process is capable for separation for\n\nanalysis is a question of fact. The State asserts that the plaintiffs’ claim\n\nthat the decision-making process was not capable of separation fails\n\nbecause the plaintiffs never attempted to make such an analysis and\n\nbecause they received voluminous amounts of data and hiring files.\n\n      The State claims that the evidence demonstrates that the plaintiffs\n\nnever tried to identify and analyze any particular employment practice or\n\ndecision-making process.      For example, the State suggests that the\n\nplaintiffs did not attempt to analyze hard documents in the departments\n\nbecause they were not in a convenient digital format. In any event, the\n\nState maintains that it provided substantial information in digital form in\n\nthe BrassRing system, and the Human Resource Information System\n\n(HRIS) data system, which were maintained by DAS. In short, the State\n\nclaims that the plaintiffs were not forced to engage in system-wide\n\nanalysis because the decision-making process was not capable of\n\nseparation for analysis, but instead simply chose to engage in a system-\n\nwide challenge.\n\n      The State emphasized that the plaintiffs had the affirmative burden\n\nof showing that the process was capable of separation for analysis. The\n\nState emphasizes the factual nature of the inquiry.       The State further\n\nclaims that at trial the plaintiffs did not offer testimony that the decision-\n\nmaking process was not capable of separation for analysis. The State\n\nasserts that the plaintiffs never tried to analyze separate practices or\n\nprocesses, but simply preferred to proceed on a system-wide basis. The\n\nState highlights the staggering amount of information that was presented\n\nto the plaintiffs in the BrassRing files and in the HRIS data system. The\n\f                                     39\n\nState notes that Killingworth engaged in analysis of the data by EEO\n\ncategory, by year, and by step in the hiring process.\n\n      B. Analysis of Specific Employment Practice and Incapable of\n\nSeparation for Analysis Under Title VII, as Amended by the Civil\n\nRights Act of 1991. Under the Civil Rights Act of 1991, a plaintiff in a\n\ndisparate impact case must identify a “particular employment practice”\n\nbeing challenged or, in the alternative, demonstrate why an employer’s\n\ndecision-making process is “not capable of separation for analysis.” 42\n\nU.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)(1)(B)(i).   The district court held that the plaintiffs\n\nfailed to show that the State’s hiring practice was not capable of\n\nseparation for analysis.\n\n      On appeal, the plaintiffs do not claim they identified a particular\n\nemployment practice.       Instead, the plaintiffs contend that the record\n\ndemonstrates that because of the poor record keeping of the State, and\n\nbecause of the use of subjective criteria in the various departments, it\n\nwas impossible to engage in a more focused analysis of the hiring\n\npractices of the State beyond what it presented in the case. Although the\n\nplaintiffs’ evidence shows notice to the State of potential disparate impact\n\narising out of its employment processes, the plaintiffs, like the plaintiffs\n\nin Wal-Mart, did not pursue a notice/negligence-type theory.\n\n      A few preliminary matters should be discussed.       First, the mere\n\nfact that the class involves a number of departments and different\n\npositions over a period of years by one employer does not necessarily\n\ndemonstrate that the State’s decision-making process is capable of\n\nseparation for analysis. To the extent relevant, the class in this case is\n\nmuch more compact than in Wal-Mart, where 1.5 million employees were\n\nlocated in 3400 stores in all fifty states. See id. at ___, 131 S. Ct. at\n\n2557, 180 L. Ed. 2d at 395.            Many lower federal courts have\n\f                                          40\n\ndistinguished Wal-Mart on the ground that the classes being challenged\n\nwere more compact.7\n\n         Nor does the fact that the State flooded the plaintiffs with\n\ncomputerized data and documents decide the case. There is no question\n\nthat the State databases provided to the plaintiffs contain thousands and\n\nthousands of bits of data.          Conclusory statements by witnesses and\n\nlawyers regarding the nature of the information presented yield little\n\nvalue.     And, the mere fact that a trial lasted seventeen days does not\n\nmean there must be substantial evidence supporting key findings of fact.\n\n         We must put the conclusory rhetoric aside and consider, first,\n\nwhat does it mean for an employer’s decision-making to be incapable of\n\nseparation for analysis? Then, once we understand the meaning of the\n\nstatutory phrase, we must examine the record to determine if the\n\nplaintiffs have met their burden in this case.\n\n         On the issue of what is meant by a decision-making process that is\n\nincapable of separation for analysis, the parties provide us with little\n\nguidance. No one disputes that the plaintiffs bear the burden of proof on\n\nthe issue. But what does it mean to be “incapable” of “separation” for\n\n“analysis”?\n\n         We begin with a review of the three key statutory words: incapable,\n\nseparation, and analysis.          None are statutorily defined.            The word\n\nincapable generally refers to something that cannot be done.                        See\n\n\n         7See,\n             e.g., Meyer v. U.S. Tennis Ass’n, No. 11 Civ. 6268, 2013 WL 7045237, at *7\n(S.D.N.Y Dec. 6, 2013) (distinguishing nationwide class in Wal-Mart from narrow class\nof hundreds of U.S. Open umpires); McReynolds v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith,\nInc., 372 F.3d 482, 488 (7th Cir. 2012) (noting claim was limited to about 700 brokers,\na far cry from Wal-Mart’s class of 1.5 million); Ellis v. Costco Wholesale Corp., Nos. C–\n04–3341 EMC, 2012 WL 4371817, at *15 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 25, 2012) (noting that the\nproposed class was 700, which was much smaller than the 1.5 million employees\nsought to be certified in Wal-Mart).\n\f                                    41\n\nMerriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary 585 (10th ed. 2002). Separation\n\nhas several different but related meanings, including “a point, line, or\n\nmeans of division,” or “an intervening space.”    Id. at 1064 (“separate”\n\nused as a verb means to set or keep apart, to remove from a mixture or\n\nto isolate).   In the context of disparate impact, we believe the term\n\nanalysis must mean statistical analysis.\n\n      While an understanding of these three statutory terms is helpful,\n\nwe still need to probe the statutory context. What kind of separation is\n\nsufficient? Separated or isolated from what? In context, it seems clear\n\nthat what must be separated out for analysis from the employers\n\ndecision-making process is particular employment practices, as the\n\nseparation of particular employment practices is what the statute\n\nordinarily requires.    The plaintiffs must show they cannot spin out\n\nseparate employment practices from the larger whole that are capable of\n\nstatistical analysis.\n\n      Given these statutory terms and their common sense definitions, it\n\nseems that a decision-making process may be incapable of separation for\n\nanalysis under at least three circumstances.       First, the substantive\n\nfeatures of the decision-making process itself may be such that the\n\ndecision-making process is incapable of separation for analysis into\n\nspecific employment practices. That is the teaching of Stender. See 803\n\nF. Supp. at 335 (finding employee’s “subjective and ambiguous decision-\n\nmaking processes” incapable of separation for analysis). For instance, a\n\nwholly subjective process, even if decentralized, would be incapable of\n\nseparation because of a lack of objective criteria.       See Ronald D.\n\nRotunda, The Civil Rights Act of 1991: A Brief Introductory Analysis of the\n\nCongressional Response to Judicial Interpretation, 68 Notre Dame L. Rev.\n\f                                      42\n\n923, 934 (1993) (noting that “hiring processes are often complicated,\n\nwith ill-defined or ill-followed guidelines”).\n\n      Second, even well-defined employment practices may be so\n\nintertwined as not capable of meaningful analysis separately. The classic\n\nexample is Dothard v. Rawlinson, 433 U.S. 321, 97 S. Ct. 2720, 53 L. Ed.\n\n2d 786 (1977).        In Dothard, height and weight requirements for\n\ncorrectional counselor positions in the Alabama state penitentiary\n\nsystem, if considered separately, had relatively mild adverse impacts on\n\nwomen, but when considered in combination, the adverse impact\n\nsignificantly increased. 433 U.S. at 329–30, 97 S. Ct. at 2727, 53 L. Ed.\n\n2d at 797. If the various employment practices cannot be isolated and\n\nconsidered independently, they are not capable of separate analysis.\n\n      Third, the failure of the employer to keep adequate records can\n\nmake an employment decision incapable of separation for analysis. See\n\nPort Auth. Police Asian Jade Soc., 681 F. Supp. 2d at 464. It is true that\n\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1991 did not contain the more specific language of\n\nthe proposed Civil Rights Act of 1990 (which, as noted above, provided\n\nthat a lack of records could excuse the particularity requirement), but\n\nthe adoption of the more general language of the Civil Rights Act of 1991\n\nis certainly broad enough to encompass such an approach and plainly\n\ndoes not preclude it.     If, for example, the various departments of an\n\nemployer do not maintain records of interview criteria, including the\n\nmanner in which the interview is scored, and the scores awarded by the\n\nemployer based on the interview, it is difficult to see how a plaintiff could\n\nengage in separate analysis of disparate impact. A contrary result would\n\nbe an incentive for employers to refuse to keep adequate records of their\n\nemployment processes.         Thus, an employer who declines to keep\n\nemployment records from which particular employment practices are\n\f                                      43\n\ncapable of separation for analysis may face a lawsuit based on system-\n\nas-a-whole-disparate impact.\n\n      Although the point is not always clear, the plaintiffs on appeal in\n\nthis case do not make an argument based solely upon one of the above\n\nscenarios. Instead, the plaintiffs offered a hybrid argument, based upon\n\na combination of the above factors.           The plaintiffs argue that a\n\ncombination of (1) ill-defined subjective practices, (2) intertwined\n\nelements of decision-making, and (3) lack of adequate record keeping by\n\nthe employer prevented them from identifying specific employment\n\npractices for purposes of disparate impact analysis.\n\n      Based on the above discussion, some of the analysis of the district\n\ncourt on the separation issue appears off the mark. For example, the\n\ndistrict court declared that the analysis of employment practice or\n\nprocess is focused on the “job specific” level. But this is not necessarily\n\ntrue. A plaintiff is not required to focus on a job specific level if it can be\n\nshown that any potential job specific employment practices are not\n\ncapable of separation for analysis.         Indeed, such a contention is\n\nantithetical to system-as-a-whole attacks that are permitted under the\n\nstatutory exception in 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)(1)(B)(i).      Thus, the mere\n\nfact that the data could be broken down by EEO-4 categories, for\n\ninstance, does not mean the plaintiff cannot proceed on a system-as-a-\n\nwhole theory.\n\n      Similarly, there is language in the district court ruling suggesting\n\nthat the existence of separate departments within an employer prevented\n\nthe plaintiffs from proceeding on a decision-making-as-a-whole theory.\n\nThe mere fact that there are departments within an employer, however,\n\ndoes not in itself mean that a plaintiff cannot show that the decision-\n\nmaking process is not capable of separation for analysis. If the plaintiff\n\f                                       44\n\ncan demonstrate, for instance, that the departments do not operate\n\nunder separate and identifiable employment practices, or that the\n\nrecords are so deficient the alleged department practices cannot be\n\nseparately analyzed, then the plaintiff may be able to proceed on a\n\ndecision-making process as a whole theory.\n\n         In short, the fact that the plaintiffs were provided with lots of data\n\nthat can mechanically be sliced and diced in numerous ways proves\n\nnothing; massive data can always be divided into countless different\n\npiles.    But the key question is not whether the massive data can be\n\ndivided up into piles, the question is whether the plaintiffs demonstrated\n\nany resulting piles that might be formed do not reveal particular\n\nemployment practices that are capable of separation for statistical\n\nanalysis.\n\n         Consider the following hypothetical.    Suppose a class of African\n\nAmericans challenged a state merit system of thirty-seven departments\n\nwhich hired thousands of persons over a ten-year period over many EEO\n\ncategories of jobs.     Suppose further that the State admitted that the\n\nhiring decisions were made at the unfettered discretion of individual\n\nmanagers in each department. Assuming no other facts, the plaintiffs\n\nwould be entitled to bring their class action under Title VII because there\n\nwould be no identifiable particular employment practices that were\n\ncapable of separate [statistical] analysis.\n\n         Take the above hypothetical and add the fact that the State\n\nprovided the plaintiff with a number of databases with hundreds of\n\nthousands of data points.          Suppose further that these documents\n\nincluded numerous job résumés, many miscellaneous descriptions of the\n\njob positions, dates the interviews were conducted, and the names of\n\f                                     45\n\nmanagers who made the decisions. Would this barrage of data mean the\n\nplaintiff was barred from proceeding on a system-as-a-whole basis?\n\n      The answer might be no. Even if the data contains thousands or\n\neven millions of bits of information, the plaintiff may show the data does\n\nnot provide a basis for a plaintiff to identify particular employment\n\npractices in an employer’s decision-making process that are subject to\n\nseparate [statistical] analysis.    In short, the amount of information\n\nproduced is irrelevant. It is the quality of the information that is key.\n\n      Let us now change the hypothetical somewhat.          Assume further\n\nthat the data dump in fact contained more substantive information on\n\nthe decision-making process.       Suppose the data was a collection of\n\nimperfect individual employment files, many of which contained specific\n\njob related criteria, or matrices for scoring interviewees and the scoring\n\nresulting from such interviews, and other significant material on the\n\nhiring process. Now, under this modified hypothetical, could the plaintiff\n\nidentify specific employment practices that could be subject to separate\n\n[statistical] analysis?\n\n      Nonetheless, the above discussion does not mean the plaintiffs\n\nmust prevail. Under Wards Cove and Wal-Mart, the plaintiffs still must\n\nshow there were not specific employment practices within the universe of\n\nthe state merit employment system with sufficient aggregate numbers\n\nthat they could be separated out for meaningful statistical analysis. See\n\nWal-Mart, 564 U.S. at ___, 131 S. Ct. at 2555–56, 180 L. Ed. 2d at 394;\n\nWards Cove, 490 U.S. at 656, 109 S. Ct. at 2124, 104 L. Ed. 2d at 751.\n\nIn order to prevail, the plaintiffs would have to show that the vast\n\nuniverse of job selection could not be divided into smaller, better defined\n\nsubsets of specific employment practices with sufficient decision points\n\nto be capable of statistical analysis.\n\f                                    46\n\n      The district court seems to have found that the plaintiffs may have\n\ninadvertently done just that.    The plaintiffs’ expert Mark Killingsworth\n\ntestified he could statistically analyze the disparate impact at what the\n\nparties called step two of the analysis, namely, at the stage where DAS\n\ncleared minimally qualified applicants and passed them onto the\n\nindividual departments for selection for an interview. But, we doubt step\n\ntwo is an employment practice “capable of separation for analysis.” All\n\nemployment processes have chronological or procedural steps, but these\n\nare not the equivalent of an employment practice with sufficient\n\ndefinition that is subject to statistical analysis. Further, Killingsworth\n\ntestified step two could not really be separated from step three, the final\n\ndecision-making step in the process. The district court did not make a\n\nspecific finding regarding whether step two could be separated or isolated\n\nfrom step three.\n\n      Nonetheless, as the district court pointed out, the plaintiffs have a\n\nfurther problem. While the parties utilized central databases maintained\n\nby DAS for what the district court accurately called “slicing and dicing” of\n\nthe statistical data, the databases may have been inadequate to engage\n\nin analysis of specific employment policies for disparate impact by\n\ndepartment or other nonsystem-wide approaches.              Even so, the\n\ndepartments themselves maintained hard file copies of employment\n\nrecords that may have included more information than was available on\n\nthe database.      The question arises whether the plaintiffs adequately\n\nproved this information could not have been utilized to separate out\n\nemployment practices by the various departments or agencies that would\n\nbe capable of separation for analysis.     While the plaintiffs claim the\n\nhiring data in the hard files was incomplete, the question remains\n\f                                       47\n\nwhether there was sufficient information in the hiring files to construct a\n\nmeaningful database to analyze specific employment practices.\n\n        The district court made findings related to the underlying\n\ndocuments. It declared that “the hiring files themselves permit a focused\n\nview of the different screening devices and practices in the referral,\n\ninterview, or hiring of applicants for any given job between the\n\ndepartments.” Further, the district court stated that “one can focus on\n\nany number of discrete employment decisions made as individual,\n\nseparate, discrete employment practices” and provided examples,\n\nincluding a “second résumé screen” and a “spelling and grammar\n\nscreen.”\n\n        Read in a fashion to support the district court’s verdict, these\n\nfindings demonstrate the district court found that employment practices\n\ncould    be   extracted   from   the   underlying   documentary    files   and\n\nstatistically analyzed in a meaningful way.          There is, however, no\n\nrequirement the defendants prove that employment practices are capable\n\nof separation for meaningful statistical analysis. The precise legal issue\n\nis whether the plaintiffs met their burden in showing that the particular\n\nemployment practices could not be separated and analyzed from the\n\ndocumentary files maintained by the State.          See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-\n\n2(k)(l)(B)(i). In short, at least under the theory of the case as litigated by\n\nthe parties, the plaintiffs have the burden of proving the negative.\n\n        We conclude the district court correctly resolved the issue\n\nadversely to the plaintiffs and that such a finding is supported by\n\nsubstantial evidence in the record.         Killingsworth did not review the\n\nunderlying documentary files and offered no testimony indicating specific\n\nemployment practices could not be extracted from the underlying files for\n\nstatistical analysis notwithstanding the flaws in some of the files. The\n\f                                     48\n\nState’s expert, Miller, suggested the underlying documents were capable\n\nof separation for analysis. Dr. Greenwald characterized the hiring files\n\nas “a gold mine that hasn’t been analyzed.”              While it is true the\n\nunderlying files were often incomplete and flawed, that does not\n\nnecessarily mean employment practices could not be identified and\n\nstatistically analyzed in a meaningful way.\n\n      The bottom line, on the record before us, is that while the plaintiffs\n\ndemonstrated the recordkeeping was sometimes incomplete, the district\n\ncourt on the record before it could conclude that the plaintiffs failed to\n\nshow the negative, namely, that employment practices could not be\n\nextracted from the underlying documents and analyzed in a statistically\n\nsignificant manner. On this issue, the district court got it right. As a\n\nresult, under applicable federal law, the State was entitled to summary\n\njudgment on the record developed in the district court on the plaintiffs’\n\nclaim under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\n      V. Discussion of Specific Employment Practice and Incapable\nof Separation Analysis Under the Iowa Civil Rights Act.\n      We now turn to the question of whether the defendant was entitled\n\nto summary judgment under the Iowa Civil Rights Act. See Iowa Code\n\n§ 216.6.   Although it is often said that state civil rights acts were\n\npatterned after the Federal Civil Rights Act, in fact more than twenty\n\nstate civil rights acts predated the Federal Act. See Arthur E. Bonfield,\n\nState Civil Rights Statutes: Some Proposals, 49 Iowa L. Rev. 1067, 1107 &\n\nn.140 (1964) (listing states).   In an important article advocating the\n\npassage of the Iowa Civil Rights Act, Bonfield relied extensively on state\n\nmodels in proposing legislative action in Iowa.             See id. at 1082\n\n(discussing states’ antidiscriminatory laws). Thus, though the Iowa Civil\n\nRights Act was enacted in the year following the enactment of the Federal\n\f                                     49\n\nCivil Rights Act, the Iowa Civil Rights Act draws on substantial state as\n\nwell as federal legislative precedent.    See id. at 1095–1123 (reviewing\n\nstates’ antidiscrimination laws and proposing statutes for Iowa).\n\n      The substantive provisions of the Iowa Civil Rights Act and Title VII\n\nof the Civil Rights Act of 1964 are often similar though not identical.\n\nWith respect to discrimination in employment, the Iowa Civil Rights Act\n\nprovides that “[i]t shall be an unfair or discriminatory practice for any\n\n. . . [p]erson to refuse to hire” or “otherwise discriminate in employment\n\nagainst any applicant for employment or any employee because of . . .\n\nrace.” Iowa Code § 216.6(1)(a). The parallel provision under the Federal\n\nCivil Rights Act provides that “[i]t shall be an unlawful employment\n\npractice for an employer . . . to fail or refuse to hire . . . or otherwise\n\ndiscriminate against any individual because of . . . race.”       42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2000e-2(a)(1).\n\n      There are, however, differences between the state and federal acts.\n\nFor instance, the Iowa legislature has declared that the Iowa Civil Rights\n\nAct “shall be construed broadly to effectuate its purposes.” Iowa Code\n\n§ 216.18(1). There is no similar language in the Federal Civil Rights Act\n\nand, indeed, the case can be made that the recent cases of the United\n\nStates Supreme Court, particularly Wards Cove and Wal-Mart, tend to\n\nconstrue the federal counterpart narrowly.        Other state courts have\n\ninterpreted similar legislative directions to mean that the remedies\n\nafforded by the state civil rights statues require the “widest constitutional\n\napplication.” Fair Emp’t Practices Comm’n v. Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke’s\n\nMed. Ctr., 354 N.E.2d 596, 600 (Ill. App. Ct. 1976); see also Frieler v.\n\nCarlson Mktg. Grp., Inc., 751 N.W.2d 558, 571–73 (Minn. 2008) (reviewing\n\nvarious courts’ interpretations of the term “supervisor” and concluding\n\nfor purposes of sexual harassment claim under state law, the court\n\f                                      50\n\nwould adopt a broader view because state law required “liberal\n\nconstruction of its terms”); Genaro v. Cent. Transp., Inc., 703 N.E.2d 782,\n\n785 (Ohio 1999) (citing language that the state chapter “shall be\n\nconstrued liberally for the accomplishment of its purposes” in departing\n\nfrom federal precedent (internal quotation marks omitted)).        An Iowa\n\ncourt faced with competing legal interpretations of the Iowa Civil Rights\n\nAct must keep in mind the legislative direction of broadly interpreting the\n\nAct when choosing among plausible legal alternatives. Any state court\n\ndecision that adopts a narrow construction of Title VII by the United\n\nStates Supreme Court without confronting the requirement in Iowa law\n\nthat the Iowa Civil Rights Act be interpreted broadly misses an essential\n\ndifference in state and federal civil rights laws.\n\n      Even where language in a state civil rights statute is parallel to the\n\nFederal Civil Rights Act, a state court is under no obligation to follow\n\nfederal precedent. As noted by the Vermont Supreme Court, federal civil\n\nrights decisions may be persuasive, but they are not the only sources of\n\npersuasive authority on the interpretation of state civil rights statutes.\n\nLavalley v. E.B. & A.C. Whiting Co., 692 A.2d 367, 369 (Vt. 1997).\n\nFederal court decisions under the Federal Civil Rights Act are not\n\nbinding on state courts, which are free to consider other persuasive\n\nauthority and come to independent conclusions. See, e.g., Brown v. F.L.\n\nRoberts & Co., 896 N.E.2d 1279, 1285 (Mass. 2008) (noting the court\n\n“frequently” does not follow the reasoning of federal precedent in\n\ninterpreting the state civil rights statute (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted)); Elezovic v. Ford Motor Co., 697 N.W.2d 851, 859 (Mich. 2005)\n\n(finding supervisor liable for sexual harassment under Michigan civil\n\nrights statute, noting that “we are not compelled to follow . . . federal\n\ninterpretations” (internal quotation marks omitted)); Frieler, 751 N.W.2d\n\f                                         51\n\nat 571–73 (considering varying interpretations of the term supervisor for\n\nclaims of sexual harassment); Grimwood v. Univ. of Puget Sound, Inc.,\n\n753 P.2d 517, 520 (Wash. 1988) (noting that “[w]hile these federal cases\n\nare a source of guidance, we bear in mind that they are not binding and\n\nthat we are free to adopt those theories and rationale which best further\n\nthe purposes and mandates of our state statute”); Goodyear Tire &\n\nRubber Co. v. Dep’t of Indus., 273 N.W.2d 786, 791 (Wis. Ct. App. 1978)\n\n(noting Wisconsin courts “must construe Wisconsin statutes as it\n\nbelieved the Wisconsin legislature intended, regardless of how Congress\n\nmay have intended comparable statutes”); cf. State v. Baldon, 829\n\nN.W.2d 785, 811–16 (Iowa 2013) (Appel, J., concurring specially) (noting,\n\ninter alia, that state constitutional provisions need not be interpreted\n\nuniformly with federal case law under parallel federal constitutional\n\nprovisions). See generally Alex B. Long, “If the Train Should Jump the\n\nTrack . . .”: Divergent Interpretations of State and Federal Employment\n\nDiscrimination Statutes, 40 Ga. L. Rev. 469, 482–83 (2006) (finding\n\nparallel between independent state constitutional interpretation and\n\nindependent      state     court    interpretation    of   state      employment\n\ndiscrimination statutes).\n\n      Recognition of the independent character of state civil rights\n\nstatutes is particularly important when Congress passes legislation\n\ndesigned to overcome decisions of the United States Supreme Court\n\nnarrowly interpreting civil rights statutes. For instance, when the United\n\nStates Supreme Court held in General Electric Co. v. Gilbert that\n\ndiscrimination based on pregnancy was not sex discrimination, Congress\n\noverrode the decision. 429 U.S. 125, 138–39, 97 S. Ct. 401, 409–10, 50\n\nL.   Ed.   2d   343,     356   (1976),   superseded   by   statute,    Pregnancy\n\nDiscrimination Act of 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-555, 92 Stat. 2076, as\n\f                                          52\n\nrecognized in Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 463 U.S. 85, 103 S. Ct, 2890,\n\n77 L. Ed. 2d 490 (1983). After the United States Supreme Court decided\n\nWards Cove, Congress enacted legislation in response to the decision.\n\nSee 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k). Congress recently overrode the restrictive\n\nUnited States Supreme Court cases of Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., 527\n\nU.S. 471, 119 S. Ct. 2139, 144 L. Ed. 2d 450 (1999), and Toyota Motor\n\nManufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184, 122 S. Ct. 681,\n\n151 L. Ed. 2d 615 (2002), through the ADA Amendments Act of 2008,\n\nPub. L. No. 110-325, § 2(b)(2)–(5), 122 Stat 3553 (2008).                      Similarly,\n\nCongress acted in response to Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. by\n\nenacting curative legislation. 550 U.S. 618, 127 S. Ct. 2162, 167 L. Ed.\n\n2d 982 (2007), superseded by statute, Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of\n\n2009, Pub. L. No. 111-2, 123 Stat. 5. The frequent narrow construction\n\nof civil rights laws by the United States Supreme Court, followed by\n\ncongressional intervention, has been cited as a ground for decreased\n\ndeference to United States Supreme Court decisions by state courts. See\n\nSperino, Revitalizing, 20 Geo. Mason L. Rev. at 564–68 (“To the extent\n\nthat the development of the federal [employment discrimination]\n\nframeworks depends on references to statutory languages and its\n\nhistorical   development     over    time,      reading     the     state    statutes   in\n\naccordance with these federal frameworks is highly suspect.”); Sandra F.\n\nSperino,     Diminishing     Deference:        Learning     Lessons         from   Recent\n\nCongressional    Rejection    of    the   Supreme         Court’s    Interpretation     of\n\nDiscrimination Statutes, 33 Rutgers L. Rec. 40, 42–43 (2009) (arguing\n\nthat “repeated Congressional rejection of [the Supreme Court’s narrow\n\ninterpretations of civil rights statutes] suggest[s] that state regimes\n\nshould not be so beholden to what may likely be faulty interpretation on\n\nthe part of the Supreme Court”).\n\f                                       53\n\n      The failure of the Iowa legislature to enact similar curative\n\nlegislation, however, is of no particular moment when there has been no\n\nsimilar narrow judicial construction of the Iowa Civil Rights Act by this\n\ncourt. Federal cases are not binding on questions of state law and thus\n\nthere is no need to override them through state legislative action.     As\n\nnoted by the Vermont Supreme Court, a state legislature is not required\n\nto “react to every federal decision interpreting Title VII or risk that its\n\ninaction will be interpreted as an endorsement of the federal decision.”\n\nLavalley, 692 A.2d at 370.\n\n      The above principles are consistent with our caselaw.            For\n\nexample, in Hubbard v. State, we noted that\n\n      [a]lthough decisions and interpretations of federal courts\n      may be illustrative and instructive to state courts in\n      construing statutes patterned after those enacted by\n      Congress and entitled to great weight in determining\n      construction to be given the same phrase in subsequently\n      enacted state statutes, they are neither conclusive nor\n      compulsory, especially when it appears earlier statutes\n      substantially similar have also been enacted in other states.\n\n163 N.W.2d 904, 909 (Iowa 1969) (emphasis added). Here, the Iowa Civil\n\nRights Act was enacted only one year after the Federal Act and thus\n\nthere was little preexisting caselaw that would be entitled to “great\n\nweight” under Hubbard.       See id.    Further, at the time the Iowa Civil\n\nRights Act was passed, there were also state statutory counterparts,\n\nwhich may provide helpful precedents. See id. (“Where the language has\n\nbeen borrowed from the statutes of a sister state we would go for light to\n\nthe construing decisions . . . of that state.”).\n\n      Consistent with Hubbard, we look to federal caselaw, and the\n\ncaselaw of other states under their state civil rights statutes, for\n\npersuasive guidance. For example, in Pecenka, we noted that we may\n\nlook to federal interpretations in construing the Iowa Civil Rights Act but\n\f                                    54\n\nare not bound by them.      672 N.W.2d at 803.     And, in holding that a\n\nsupervisor may be personally liable for harassment under section\n\n216.6(1) of the Iowa Civil Rights Act, we favorably cited a New York case\n\nconstruing state law. See Vivian, 601 N.W.2d at 877–78.\n\n      The bottom line is that the Iowa Civil Rights Act is a source of law\n\nindependent of the Federal Civil Rights Act. In construing the Act, we\n\nmay look to federal and state court precedent, none of which are binding,\n\nbut which may persuade us in the interpretation of the Iowa statute. In\n\nmaking choices under the Iowa Civil Rights Act, we must be mindful of\n\nthe legislative direction that the Act be broadly interpreted to effectuate\n\nits purposes. See Iowa Code § 216.18(1).\n\n      The plaintiffs in their brief, however, do not explicitly invite us to\n\ninterpret the Iowa Civil Rights Act in a fashion different than Title VII of\n\nthe Federal Civil Rights Act.      The plaintiffs declare that “generally\n\nspeaking,” the same burden-shifting approach is applied under the Iowa\n\nCivil Rights Act as is applied under Title VII of the Federal Civil Rights\n\nAct. But the plaintiffs go even further. They seem to take the view that\n\nthe criteria established in the Civil Rights Act of 1991 also apply under\n\nthe Iowa Civil Rights Act even though there was no comparable statutory\n\namendment. Plaintiffs simply state that under “the law,” a plaintiff must\n\nidentify a specific employment practice or show that the decision-making\n\nprocess is not capable of separate analysis. Thus, the plaintiffs do not\n\nappear to make the substantive argument that Iowa law should embark\n\non a different path than reflected in Wards Cove and the subsequent\n\namendments to Title VII adopted by Congress or from Wal-Mart.\n\n      We thus must confront a question of preservation.          A narrow\n\nprivate law approach would suggest that we narrowly decide only the\n\nquestions advanced by the parties.          See Melvin Aron Eisenberg,\n\f                                     55\n\nParticipation, Responsiveness, and the Consultative Process: An Essay for\n\nLon Fuller, 92 Harv. L. Rev. 410, 413 (1978) (advocating strong\n\nresponsiveness to the parties arguments “insofar as the parties\n\ncontemplate that the court will settle their dispute on the basis of the\n\nissues as the parties see them”).    On the other hand, in dealing with\n\npublic law questions, the court has a responsibility for the development\n\nof law generally and cannot allow the advocacy of private parties to\n\ndictate legal development. See generally Abram Chayes, The Role of the\n\nJudge in Public Law Litigation, 89 Harv. L. Rev. 1281 (1976).            The\n\npreservation question was explored at some depth in the context of\n\ncommon law development in Feld v. Borkowski, 790 N.W.2d 72, 82–86\n\n(Iowa 2010) (Appel, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).\n\n      In the constitutional context, we have stated when a party raises\n\nboth federal and state constitutional claims, but does not establish a\n\ndifferent   substantive   standard   between    the   state   and     federal\n\nconstitutions, we assume the federal standard applies, but reserve the\n\nright to apply that standard in a fashion different from federal courts.\n\nSee State v. Edouard, ___ N.W.2d ___ (Iowa 2014) (Appel, J., concurring\n\nspecially). Using this approach, we have reserved for another day some\n\nvery important constitutional issues under the Iowa Constitution that,\n\ninstead of being decided earlier, remain very much alive today. See, e.g.,\n\nKing v. State, 818 N.W.2d 1, 47 n.52 (Iowa 2012) (Appel, J., dissenting)\n\n(reserving question of whether article IX, division 1, section 12 of the\n\nIowa Constitution provides enforceable rights to a public education);\n\nState v. Lowe, 812 N.W.2d 554, 593 n.23 (Iowa 2012) (Appel, J.,\n\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part) (reserving the question of\n\nwhether Iowa should abandon the multifactor Schneckloth v. Bustamonte\n\ntest in the search and seizure context in favor of a requiring knowing and\n\f                                          56\n\nvoluntary consent); State v. Iowa Dist. Ct., 801 N.W.2d 513, 518 n.2\n\n(Iowa 2011) (reserving question of whether participation in sex offender\n\ntreatment program requiring offender to admit past crimes violated due\n\nprocess under the state constitution); State v. Effler, 769 N.W.2d 880,\n\n890, 895–97 (Iowa 2009) (Appel, J., concurring specially) (reserving the\n\nimportant question of whether we should reject the majority view\n\nexpressed in Davis v. United States, 512 U.S. 452, 114 S. Ct. 2350, 129\n\nL. Ed. 2d 362 (1994), in favor of the dissenting position). We could adopt\n\na similar approach on an issue of statutory construction of a parallel\n\nstatute.\n\n       In this case, the plaintiffs structured the litigation and advanced\n\narguments solely based upon federal law standards. Had the plaintiffs\n\nadvanced an argument under state law departing from the federal\n\nprecedent, for example, that a particular employment practice is not a\n\nrequirement under the Iowa Civil Rights Act8—a different factual record\n\nmight have been developed at trial.               Specifically, the State did not\n\nattempt to present a defense based upon business necessity, and the\n\nState’s response to the plaintiffs’ damage claim was quite limited. If, for\n\nexample, the State knew the plaintiff was relying upon a different theory\nof law, it might have affected the factual development at trial.                 Under\n\nthese circumstances, we decline to address arguments that were not\n\nadvanced by the plaintiffs at trial.\n\n\n\n\n        8“Also troubling is the Court’s apparent redefinition of the employees’ burden of\n\nproof in a disparate-impact case.” Wards Cove, 490 U.S. at 672, 109 S. Ct. at 2133,\n104 L. Ed. 2d at 761 (Stevens, J., dissenting). “No prima facie case will be made, it\ndeclares, unless the employees isolat[e] and identif[y] the specific employment practices\nthat are allegedly responsible for any observed statistical disparities.” Id. (internal\nquotation marks omitted). “This additional proof requirement is unwarranted.” Id.\n\f                                    57\n\n      Nonetheless, even when the parties have not argued for different\n\nsubstantive principles, we still may apply the principles advocated by the\n\nparties in a fashion different than the federal courts. See Edouard, ___\n\nN.W.2d at ___ (Appel, J., concurring specially). Yet, we find no basis to\n\ndo so in this case. Under the framework presented to the district court,\n\nwhich for the purposes of this case we adopt, the plaintiffs failed to show\n\nthat the underlying documents did not provide sufficient information to\n\nallow employment practices to be separated for meaningful statistical\n\nanalysis.   As a result, given the posture of this case, we affirm the\n\ndecision of the district court under the Iowa Civil Rights Act.\n\n      VI. Conclusion.\n\n      For the above reason, the district court judgment is affirmed.\n\n      AFFIRMED.\n\n      All justices concur except Waterman, Mansfield, and Zager, JJ.,\n\nwho concur specially.\n\f                                        58\n                                                    #12–0913, Pippen v. State\n\nWATERMAN, Justice (concurring specially).\n\n         I respectfully concur in the result only. I am unable to join the\n\nmajority opinion’s affirmance of the district court’s thorough, well-\n\nreasoned decision on the merits in favor of defendants. See Pippen v.\n\nState, No. 05771 LACL107038, 2012 WL 1388902 (Iowa Dist. Ct.\n\nApril 17, 2012),      available    at        http://www.iowaappeals.com/wp-\n\ncontent/uploads/2012/05/Pippen-Ruling.pdf. The majority’s discussion\n\nof the law includes dicta unnecessary to its holding. For example, the\n\nmajority gratuitously undermines our court’s long-standing practice of\n\nrelying on federal decisions to interpret equivalent provisions of the Iowa\n\nCivil Rights Act. Yet, the majority’s analysis of the dispositive issue is\n\ncursory.     Given the importance of this case, I offer a more complete\n\nanalysis of the grounds to affirm the judgment and respond to the dicta\n\nto help guide cases to follow.\n\n         Plaintiffs are a certified class of over 5000 members defined as\n\n“[a]ll   African   American    applicants     and   employees     who   sought\n\nappointment to or held a merit-system position with an Executive\n\nBranch agency (not including Board of Regents) at any point from July 1,\n\n2003, through April 17, 2012.”       They brought disparate impact racial\n\ndiscrimination claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and\n\nthe Iowa Civil Rights Act of 1965 (ICRA).         These civil rights laws were\n\nenacted to eliminate discriminatory practices, provide remedies for\n\ndiscrimination,     and   allow    equal     opportunities   in   employment.\n\nDefendants are the State of Iowa and its thirty-seven executive branch\n\ndepartments. There are over 700 types of employment positions within\n\nthe executive branch.         During the relevant period, nearly 500,000\n\napplications were submitted by 100,000 applicants for 20,000 openings.\n\f                                        59\n\nApproximately 2000 supervisors within the executive branch have\n\nauthority in the hiring process. Plaintiffs sought to prove at trial that the\n\nState’s     overall   hiring   system   during   the   relevant    time   period\n\ndiscriminated on the basis of race.\n\n      Disparate impact law generally requires plaintiffs to prove a\n\nparticular employment practice caused a disparate impact. The majority\n\nfails to discuss the purpose of this proof requirement, which is to enable\n\nthe district court to fashion a remedy correcting the discriminatory\n\npractice without affecting other practices that are not discriminatory.\n\nCongress enacted a narrow exception to this general requirement.\n\nSpecifically, plaintiffs do not have to prove a particular employment\n\npractice had a discriminatory impact if they prove the State’s hiring\n\nprocess was incapable of “separation for analysis.”               See 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2000e-2(k)(1)(B)(i) (2006). In that event, the law relieves them of the\n\nburden of attributing the discrimination to a particular employment\n\npractice. Here, the plaintiffs sought to proceed under that exception.\n\n      Following a month-long bench trial, the district court found the\n\nState’s employment decision-making process was capable of separation\n\nfor analysis. For the reasons explained below, I conclude the “capable of\n\nseparation” finding is supported by substantial evidence and is\n\ndispositive.     I therefore agree the district court judgment must be\n\naffirmed.\n\n      I. Additional Background Facts and Proceedings.\n\n      As required under our standard of review in our appellate role, we\n\nreview the trial evidence in the light most favorable to the judgment.\n\nFalczynski v. Amoco Oil Co., 533 N.W.2d 226, 230 (Iowa 1995).              I will\n\nelaborate on the expert testimony discussed by the majority opinion.\n\f                                          60\n\n       As the majority notes, plaintiffs presented testimony from three\n\nexpert witnesses.        Anthony Greenwald and Cheryl Kaiser testified\n\nregarding the social science of implicit-bias stereotyping and how implicit\n\nbiases affect decision-making. Kaiser explained the difference between\n\nexplicit and implicit bias: explicit bias is “conscious, deliberate,\n\ncontrolled animosity,” whereas implicit bias is due to unconscious\n\nnegative associations—stereotypes—that people have developed over\n\ntime.9 Implicit-bias theory helps explain how statistical disparities can\n\nresult without intentional discrimination: individuals act on implicit\n\nbiases without recognizing they are doing so.                  Greenwald testified\n\nunconscious bias leads to discrimination particularly in subjective\n\ndecision-making and that most test groups demonstrate a seventy\n\npercent unconscious preference for whites over blacks.10                  And, as is\n\ncustomary in a disparate impact case, the plaintiffs presented testimony\n\n       9Research into the process of socialization and development of social\n\n       norms [has] led to an understanding that the development of\n       stereotypes—and consequent biases and prejudices—is not a function of\n       an aberrational mind, but instead an outcome of normal cognitive\n       processes associated with simplifying and storing information of\n       overwhelming quantity and complexity that people encounter daily.\nMelissa Hart, Subjective Decisionmaking and Unconscious Discrimination, 56 Ala. L. Rev.\n741, 746 (2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). Implicit-bias research and its\napplication to legal theories has been thoroughly reviewed in legal scholarship. See\nJerry Kang, Trojan Horses of Race, 118 Harv. L. Rev. 1489, 1515 & n.122 (2005)\n(providing summary of employment-related implicit-bias studies, including experiment\nwhere résumés with “white names” received fifty percent more callbacks than résumés\nwith “black names”); see also Judge Mark W.

For example, in\n\n2005, nine percent of African-American applicants were interviewed, as\n\ncompared to twenty percent of white applicants. That same year, 1.8% of\n\nAfrican-American applicants were hired, as compared to 4.2% of white\n\napplicants. Overall, his analysis showed that a minimally qualified white\n\nperson had a forty percent greater chance of being hired than a\n\nminimally qualified African American.                  Splitting his analysis by\n\ndepartment, Killingsworth testified there was a statistically significant\n\ndisparity between the percentage of African-American applicants hired\n\nand the percentage of white applicants hired in many of the departments,\n\nthough not all. Killingsworth further testified that, once hired, white and\n\nAfrican-American employees were treated differently in performance\n\n\n       11Notably, the CPS study mentioned by the majority did not perform regression\nanalyses that excluded other possible variables that could account for the differences it\nreported. After pointing out the disparity between referrals and interviews, CPS\nacknowledged, “There could be . . . very legitimate reasons why the percentage of\nAfrican Americans is reduced so dramatically between referral and interview” and\nacknowledged that “the team was unable to determine a definitive reason(s) for these\noutcomes.”\n       12Both  Killingsworth and the State’s expert, Robert Miller, used applications—as\nopposed to applicants—as their unit of analysis. As the CPS study noted, it is difficult\nto identify the exact makeup of the applicant pool or the actual number of applicants\nbecause the State’s tracking system did not track individual people, but rather\napplications. Both the State’s and plaintiffs’ experts acknowledged African-American\napplicants applied on average for 1.6 more jobs than white applicants. In short, both\nparties agreed that African-American applicants, on average, followed a strategy of\ncasting a wider State job search net than white applicants.\n\f                                          62\n\nevaluations. Killingsworth did not connect his findings to any particular\n\nState practice.13\n\n       Robert Miller, another labor economist and the State’s statistical\n\nexpert, also performed regression analyses. With regard to wages and\n\npromotion, he found no statistically significant differences between races\n\nafter taking into account experience and the pay grade of the job for\n\nwhich the individual applied. He criticized Killingsworth’s regressions as\n\ninadequate because they failed to adjust for these other factors.\n\n       With regard to hiring, Miller subdivided his work into the three\n\nsteps that the State followed to get to its actual hire.                Thus, unlike\n\nKillingsworth, who considered only steps two and three and combined\n\nthem, Miller separately considered steps one, two, and three.                   At step\n\nthree, i.e., what occurs after the applicant is granted an in-person\n\ninterview, Miller found no statistically significant difference between\n\nwhites and blacks in their success in being hired.\n\n       At step one, Miller found no statistically significant difference\n\nbetween white and black applicants in getting a referral.                    On a per\n\napplication basis, though, African Americans were less successful than\n\nwhites in getting a referral. However, the data also showed that African-\n\nAmerican applicants, on average, filed more applications than whites\n\n(approximately 5.9 versus 4.3 per applicant over a multiyear period—a\n\nthirty-eight percent difference).\n\n       At step two—referral to interview—Miller’s findings were more\n\nnuanced.       On the whole, he found that African Americans were\n\n\n       13Killingsworth  acknowledged that he looked only at “[t]he total result,” not any\nparticular employment practice other than “hiring” as a whole. He did not offer any\nopinions that the disparities he observed were the result of subjective as opposed to\nobjective hiring practices.\n\f                                         63\n\nstatistically less likely to receive a department job interview after their\n\napplication was referred by DAS. Probing more deeply, he found this was\n\nonly true for about one-third of State departments. It was not true for\n\nthe remaining two-thirds of departments. As Miller explained,\n\n      The overall conclusion with respect to step two is that a\n      common factor could not or does not appear to be operating\n      across all the departments in the same way, because our\n      results show that there are clear departmental differences.\n\nFor the specific jobs that the thirteen named plaintiffs had applied for,\n\nMiller found that African Americans were not statistically less likely to\n\nget interviews than whites.\n\n      The plaintiffs reviewed paper hiring files produced by the State for\n\n667 separate positions that were filled. Based on the examples in the\n\nrecord, these files contained items such as applicant résumés, score\n\nsheets for résumé reviews, score sheets for interviews, and letters asking\n\nfor authority (and justifying the decision) to hire the successful applicant.\n\nFor instance, for the position of workforce advisor in the unemployment\n\ninsurance service center, Iowa Workforce Development used a résumé\n\nreview worksheet that awarded a maximum of fifty-nine points. There\n\nwere a maximum of twenty points potentially available for education, ten\npoints   potentially   available   for    unemployment   insurance    claims\n\nexperience, fourteen points potentially available for possessing various\n\ncomputer skills, five points available for being a veteran (or ten for being\n\na disabled veteran), and five points available for “ability to follow resume\n\nand cover letter submission directions.” These files were not provided to\n\nor reviewed by Killingsworth. As Killingsworth put it, “I don’t have any\n\naccess or haven’t had any hiring files.”\n\f                                    64\n\n      Miller testified that the data were “absolutely” capable of\n\nseparation for analysis, and in fact, he separated them to the extent\n\nnoted.\n\n      II. Analysis.\n\n      On appeal, plaintiffs do not argue that the State’s failure to follow\n\nits own equal-employment-opportunity policies constituted a discrete\n\nemployment practice.     Instead, plaintiffs challenge the district court’s\n\ndetermination that the State’s overall hiring process was capable of\n\nseparation for analysis. Plaintiffs argue the hiring process could not be\n\nanalyzed in terms of separate practices. Plaintiffs also assert on appeal\n\nthat the district court erred in determining they failed to prove causation.\n\nBecause the district court correctly decided the dispositive separation\n\nissue, we need not reach the causation issue. I will provide an overview\n\nof the governing law to place the separation issue into context.\n\n      A. Disparate Impact Law. Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act’s\n\n“central statutory purposes [are] eradicating discrimination throughout\n\nthe economy and making persons whole for injuries suffered through\n\npast discrimination.” Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 421,\n\n95 S. Ct. 2362, 2373, 45 L. Ed. 2d 280, 299 (1975). To that end, Title VII\n\nseeks “to eliminate those discriminatory practices and devices which\n\nhave fostered racially stratified job environments to the disadvantage of\n\nminority citizens.” McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 800,\n\n93 S. Ct. 1817, 1823, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668, 676 (1973).        “The ICRA was\n\nmodeled after Title VII” and enacted to serve the same purposes: it “was\n\npassed in 1965 in an effort to establish parity in the workplace and\n\nmarket opportunity for all.”   Vivian v. Madison, 601 N.W.2d 872, 873\n\n(Iowa 1999).\n\f                                     65\n\n        Title VII and the ICRA each provide two principal ways to prove\n\nemployment discrimination: disparate impact and disparate treatment.\n\nHy-Vee Food Stores, Inc. v. Iowa Civil Rights Comm’n, 453 N.W.2d 512,\n\n516 (Iowa 1990). The fundamental difference between the two theories is\n\nthat “the disparate treatment theory focuses on the employer’s\n\nmotivation; the disparate impact theory focuses on the consequences of\n\nthe employer’s conduct.” Id. Disparate treatment requires a plaintiff to\n\nprove intentional discrimination. Id.\n\n        Disparate impact, the theory plaintiffs presented at trial, presents\n\nan avenue for addressing inequalities in the absence of intentional\n\ndiscrimination.    In a disparate impact case, what matters is not the\n\nsubjective motivation of the employer, but the effects of an employment\n\npractice. Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 432, 91 S. Ct. 849,\n\n854, 28 L. Ed. 2d 158, 165 (1971). Disparate impact prohibits employer\n\npractices “that are facially neutral in their treatment of different groups\n\nbut that in fact fall more harshly on one group than another.” Int’l Bhd.\n\nof Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 335 n.15, 97 S. Ct. 1843,\n\n1854 n.15, 52 L. Ed. 2d 396, 415 n.15 (1977). Meant to remove barriers\n\nto employment or promotion that are unrelated to job performance, the\n\nfocus of disparate impact theory is on fairness in operation—not fairness\n\nin form. Griggs, 401 U.S. at 431, 91 S. Ct. at 853, 28 L. Ed. 2d at 164\n\n(commenting that “equality of opportunity merely in the sense of the\n\nfabled offer of milk to the stork and the fox” is insufficient under Title\n\nVII).\n\n        A three-step burden-shifting framework applies to disparate impact\n\nclaims. In the first stage, to establish a prima facie case, a plaintiff must\n\nshow that the employer “ ‘uses a particular employment practice that\n\ncauses a disparate impact’ on one of the prohibited bases.” Lewis v. City\n\f                                         66\n\nof Chicago, 560 U.S. 205, 212, 130 S. Ct. 2191, 2197, 176 L. Ed. 2d 967,\n\n974 (2010) (emphasis omitted) (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)(1)(A)(i)).\n\n“Identifying a specific practice is not a trivial burden . . . .” Meacham v.\n\nKnolls Atomic Power Lab., 554 U.S. 84, 101, 128 S. Ct. 2395, 2406, 171\n\nL. Ed. 2d 283, 296 (2008). Second, if the plaintiff makes this prima facie\n\nshowing, the burden shifts to the employer to prove that the challenged\n\nemployment practice reflects a business necessity.           See 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2000e-2(k)(1)(A)(i).    Third, the plaintiff may rebut the employer’s\n\nbusiness-necessity       evidence   by    demonstrating   there   are   “other\n\nreasonable alternatives that would have less adverse impact,” Hy-Vee,\n\n453 N.W.2d at 518, and the defendant “refuses to adopt such alternative\n\nemployment practice,” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)(1)(A)(ii).       Only the first\n\nstage is at issue in this appeal because the district court held that\n\nplaintiffs failed to prove their prima facie case.\n\n      The identification of a particular employment practice in the first\n\nstage helps the court ascertain and remedy the cause of racial\n\ndisparities. Proof focused on a particular employment practice enables\n\nthe relevant comparison between “qualified persons in the labor market\n\nand the persons holding at-issue jobs.”         Wards Cove Packing Co. v.\n\nAtonio, 490 U.S. 642, 650, 109 S. Ct. 2115, 2121, 104 L. Ed. 2d 733,\n\n747 (1989), superseded by statute on other grounds, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-\n\n2(k), as recognized in Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. ___, 131\n\nS. Ct. 2541, 180 L. Ed. 2d 374 (2011).\n\n      The United States Supreme Court cautioned that using overbroad\n\nstatistics to prove a disparate impact claim “would result in employers\n\nbeing potentially liable for ‘the myriad of innocent causes that may lead\n\nto statistical imbalances in the composition of their work forces.’ ” Id. at\n\n657, 109 S. Ct. at 2125, 104 L. Ed. 2d at 751–52 (quoting Watson v.\n\f                                      67\n\nFort Worth Bank & Trust, 487 U.S. 977, 992, 108 S. Ct. 2777, 2787, 101\n\nL. Ed. 2d 827, 843 (1988)).         “Title VII guarantees [individuals] the\n\nopportunity to compete equally with white workers on the basis of job-\n\nrelated criteria,” but does not guarantee equal outcomes. Connecticut v.\n\nTeal, 457 U.S. 440, 451, 102 S. Ct. 2525, 2532–33, 73 L. Ed. 2d 130,\n\n139 (1982). As the Wards Cove Court explained, if plaintiffs are allowed\n\nto use aggregated statistics alone to prove disparate impact, it is difficult\n\nfor the Court to determine if the racial composition of hires is at odds\n\nwith the relevant qualified labor market. 490 U.S. at 650–52, 109 S. Ct.\n\nat 2121–22, 104 L. Ed. 2d at 747–48.\n\n      Wards    Cove   highlighted     that   racial   disparities   revealed   in\n\naggregated statistics at times could be justified by a closer examination\n\nof the qualified labor pool.    Similarly, disparities shown by statistics\n\naggregated at the departmental level may be explained by the specific\n\nemployment practices of a given department. See Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at\n\n___, 131 S. Ct. at 2555, 180 L. Ed. 2d at 394 (“[I]nformation about\n\ndisparities at the regional and national level does not establish the\n\nexistence of disparities at individual stores, let alone raise the inference\n\nthat a company-wide policy of discrimination is implemented by\n\ndiscretionary decisions at the store and district level.”              (Internal\n\nquotation marks omitted.)).\n\n      The particularity requirement allows the court to fashion an\n\nappropriate remedy: if a particular employer practice is identified as\n\ncausing discriminatory impact, the court can order the employer to\n\ncorrect it. Title VII “arm[s] the courts with full equitable powers” in order\n\nto address violations. Albemarle, 422 U.S. at 418, 95 S. Ct. at 2372, 45\n\nL. Ed. 2d at 297.     A court must be able to determine the cause of\n\ndiscrimination to effectively exercise these equitable powers.           As the\n\f                                     68\n\nUnited States Supreme Court has long recognized, the usefulness of\n\nstatistics “depends on all of the surrounding facts and circumstances.”\n\nInt’l Bhd. of Teamsters, 431 U.S. at 340, 97 S. Ct. at 1856–57, 52\n\nL. Ed. 2d at 418.   It is vital to determine the particular employment\n\npractice causing the disparate impact in order to fix the problem.\n\n      For example, the record shows that African Americans actually\n\ncomprise a higher percentage of the State executive branch workforce\n\nthan they do in the Iowa workforce as a whole. Yet, it would be wrong to\n\nconclude from that overall number that the State is not discriminating on\n\nthe basis of race. One has to focus on actual employment practices.\n\n      While   Congress   generally   required   that   a   plaintiff   identify\n\nparticular employment practices that cause disparate impact, Congress\n\nalso provided that the decision-making process could be challenged as a\n\nwhole under certain circumstances. Specifically, Congress provided:\n\n      With respect to demonstrating that a particular employment\n      practice causes a disparate impact . . . the complaining party\n      shall demonstrate that each particular challenged\n      employment practice causes a disparate impact, except that\n      if the complaining party can demonstrate to the court that\n      the elements of a respondent’s decisionmaking process are\n      not capable of separation for analysis, the decisionmaking\n      process may be analyzed as one employment practice.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)(1)(B)(i).   This law codifies an exception to the\n\nrequirement that a plaintiff identify a particular employment practice,\n\nthereby ensuring that employers cannot avoid liability for disparate\n\nimpact simply by making it difficult for a plaintiff to separately analyze\n\nthe decision-making elements. See Griffin v. Carlin, 755 F.2d 1516, 1525\n\n(11th Cir. 1985).   This statutory exception balances the concern that\n\nemployers could evade liability against the need for particularity by\n\nrequiring the plaintiff to first demonstrate the employer’s process is\n\nincapable of separation. As the majority acknowledges, the burden was\n\f                                          69\n\non plaintiffs to prove the State’s decision-making process is incapable of\n\nseparation for analysis before proceeding to attack the process as a\n\nwhole. See Grant v. Metro. Gov’t of Nashville, 446 F. App’x 737, 740 (6th\n\nCir. 2011).\n\n       The ICRA does not have a counterpart to the 1991 congressional\n\namendment.14 Plaintiffs do not argue here—and did not argue below—\n\nthat their burden to establish a prima facie case under the ICRA was\n\nlower than their burden under Title VII. I will therefore focus on federal\n\nlaw and on the question of whether the State’s employment practices\n\nwere “not capable of separation for purposes of analysis.” But, first, I\n\nmust respond to dicta in the majority opinion that misleads by omission\n\nand thereby unfairly disparages, sub silentio, our long-standing practice,\n\nfollowed in numerous decisions of this court, of relying on federal\n\ndecisions to interpret equivalent provisions in the ICRA. The majority, in\n\na discussion unrelated to its holding, distances itself from federal\n\ndecisions.\n\n       The majority, relying on Hubbard v. State, 163 N.W.2d 904, 909\n\n(Iowa 1969), suggests federal interpretations of Title VII are only useful if\n\nthose interpretations preceded the enactment of the Iowa statute.                      I\n\ndisagree. Hubbard was decided a half century ago and interpreted the\n\nIowa Tort Claims Act (ITCA), not the ICRA.                 See id. at 905.       Since\n\n        14An act of Congress amending Title VII does not amend the ICRA. The ICRA\n\nrequires the plaintiff to prove a specific employment practice caused the disparate\nimpact. Hy-Vee, 453 N.W.2d at 518. The Iowa legislature has not amended the ICRA to\nadd a provision in response to our decision in Hy-Vee or the congressional amendment\nto Title VII over twenty-three years ago. I would not read such an exception into the\nICRA in the guise of judicial interpretation. See Ackelson v. Manley Toy Direct, L.L.C.,\n832 N.W.2d 678, 689 (Iowa 2013) (declining to reinterpret the ICRA to allow punitive\ndamages in light of precedent disallowing punitive damages and legislative\nacquiescence). Whether to create such an exception in the ICRA is a policy choice to be\nmade by the legislature.\n\f                                    70\n\nHubbard, our court has repeatedly relied on subsequent federal\n\ninterpretations of the Federal Tort Claims Act to construe the ITCA. See\n\nWalker v. State, 801 N.W.2d 548, 569 (Iowa 2011) (Mansfield, J.,\n\ndissenting) (collecting Iowa opinions that rely on federal cases decided\n\nafter the ITCA’s enactment).    Indeed, our court has cited Hubbard as\n\nsupport for the proposition that “[i]nterpretations of the federal act are\n\ninstructive”—without limiting that observation to cases decided before\n\nthe enactment of the ITCA. Annear v. State, 419 N.W.2d 377, 379 (Iowa\n\n1988); see also Meier v. Sulhoff, 360 N.W.2d 722, 728 (Iowa 1985)\n\n(McCormick, J., dissenting) (citing Hubbard and stating “[b]ecause [the\n\nIowa Occupational Safety and Health Act] is based on the federal model,\n\nthe federal court interpretations constitute persuasive authority for\n\ngiving a similar interpretation to our statute”); Adam v. Mount Pleasant\n\nBank & Trust Co., 340 N.W.2d 251, 252 (Iowa 1983) (“Because our\n\nstatute is based on the federal Tort Claims Act, we assume our\n\nlegislature intended it to have the same meaning as the federal statute.\n\nHubbard, 163 N.W.2d at 911. Federal decisions interpreting the federal\n\nact are therefore entitled to great weight. Id. at 909.”). In any event, our\n\ncourt, before today, has never relied on Hubbard to interpret the ICRA.\n\n      The Iowa bench and bar has long understood federal authorities\n\nprovide guidance to interpret the ICRA. This lends predictability to an\n\nimportant area of the law, particularly when the legislature has long\n\nacquiesced in our interpretations of the ICRA based on federal\n\ninterpretations of the counterpart federal statutory language. See\n\nAckelson v. Manley Toy Direct, L.L.C., 832 N.W.2d 678, 688–89 (Iowa\n\n2013) (discussing legislative acquiescence).    Remarkably, the majority\n\nfails to acknowledge that our court decided many cases by relying on\n\nfederal interpretations of equivalent statutory language in the civil rights\n\f                                    71\n\nacts.

Does Substantial Evidence Support the District Court’s\n\nFinding that the State’s Decision-Making Process Was Capable of\n\nSeparation for Analysis?          The district court specifically found the\n\nState’s decision-making process was capable of separation for analysis. I\n\nagree with the majority that this is a question of fact. See, e.g., McClain\n\nv. Lufkin Indus., Inc., 519 F.3d 264, 278 (5th Cir. 2008). We are bound\n\n      15The  same majority has ignored an even longer line of cases adhering to our\ncourt’s long-standing practice of relying on federal decisions under the Fourth\nAmendment when interpreting the nearly identical search-and-seizure provision in the\nIowa Constitution. See State v. Short, ___ N.W.2d ___, ___ (2014) (Waterman, J.,\ndissenting).\n\f                                    73\n\nby the district court’s factual finding if it is supported by substantial\n\nevidence. Schlitzer, 641 N.W.2d at 529. Plaintiffs argue on appeal there\n\nwas no substantial evidence supporting this finding and that their\n\nevidence proved as a matter of law that the State’s decision-making\n\nprocess was incapable of separation for analysis. I disagree.\n\n      Plaintiffs assert that the State’s record-keeping practices precluded\n\nseparate analysis of the decision-making process because (1) subjective\n\nassessments pervaded the decision-making process; (2) subjective\n\nassessments have a “ripple effect,” whereby the discriminatory impact\n\naccumulates as applicants move through the hiring process; and (3) the\n\nState did not retain some records regarding applicant evaluations.\n\n      The district court rejected all three theories based on the factual\n\nrecord developed at trial. To put the district court’s dispositive factual\n\nfinding into its legal context, I construe the operative statutory language.\n\nThe phrase “each particular challenged employment practice” in 42\n\nU.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)(1)(B)(i) indicates that a particular employment\n\npractice is distinct from a decision-making process.            A particular\n\nemployment practice is considered an element within the larger decision-\n\nmaking process. Congress’s choice to use the singular form, combined\n\nwith the words “particular” and “each” demonstrates that the challenged\n\npractice must be individually identified. “This syntax would be strange if\n\na plaintiff could bundle a number of discrete steps of a multi-phase\n\nhiring process together, based on a common characteristic.”         Davis v.\n\nCintas Corp., 717 F.3d 476,496, 497 (6th Cir. 2013) (holding plaintiff “did\n\nnot identify a ‘particular employment practice’ within the meaning of Title\n\nVII by pointing to all of the subjective elements in the [employer’s hiring\n\nsystem]”).\n\f                                    74\n\n      I first consider plaintiffs’ contentions regarding subjective decision-\n\nmaking.     How subjective decision-making plays into hiring and\n\npromotion depends on the type of job and the process used to fill it.\n\nThus, subjective conduct may serve as the “particular employment\n\npractice” underlying a disparate impact claim if plaintiffs can prove that\n\nthe conduct operates uniformly throughout an employer’s decision-\n\nmaking process to cause a disparate impact. For example, in Davis, the\n\nSixth Circuit rejected plaintiff’s argument that the defendant’s decision-\n\nmaking process was incapable of separation when “not all of the system’s\n\nsubjective elements are the same.” Id. at 497. The court noted “[e]ach\n\ndifferent interview . . . has a specific interview guide, and different\n\nmanagers conduct interviews at different stages of the process.”          Id.\n\nLikewise, in Bennett v. Nucor Corp., the Eighth Circuit concluded “this is\n\nnot a case where the components of the employer’s selection process\n\nwere incapable of separation.” 656 F.3d 802, 817 (8th Cir. 2011). The\n\ncourt pointed to the fact that the employer’s “five departments used a\n\nvariety of measures to evaluate candidates for promotion, including\n\nobjective criteria like experience, training, disciplinary history, and test\n\nscores, and subjective criteria such as interview performance and the\n\nopinion of the candidate’s current supervisor.” Id. at 817–18; see also\n\nGrant, 446 F. App’x at 740 (“The problem, however, is that Plaintiffs\n\nmake no effort to isolate any of these [decision-making] practices or to\n\nexamine their individual effects on the promotions process.”).\n\n      Chin v. Port Authority is a good example of a subjective process that\n\nwas incapable of separation for purposes of analysis.        685 F.3d 135,\n\n154–55 (2d Cir. 2012). In that case, the plaintiffs had passed exams and\n\nhad been placed on eligibility lists for promotions to sergeant but had not\n\nreceived promotions.    Id. at 142–43.     The plaintiffs proved that the\n\f                                      75\n\ndecisions as to whom would be promoted from the eligible list were based\n\non essentially subjective recommendations by commanding officers and\n\nsubjective final decisions by the superintendent.       Id. at 154–55.     The\n\nprocess was entirely discretionary, and the final decision rested with one\n\nperson—the superintendent. See id.\n\n      Wal-Mart, filed shortly before this case went to trial, is instructive.\n\nThere, the Supreme Court decertified a nationwide class of 1.5 million\n\ncurrent     and   former   employees       of   Wal-Mart   alleging   gender\n\ndiscrimination. Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at ___, ___, 131 S. Ct. at 2547, 2561,\n\n180 L. Ed. 2d at 385, 400.      Pay and promotion decisions at Wal-Mart\n\nwere generally committed to local managers’ broad, subjective discretion.\n\nId. at ___, 131 S. Ct. at 2547, 180 L. Ed. 2d at 385. However, plaintiffs\n\nalleged that a strong and uniform corporate culture led that discretion to\n\nbe exercised, even subconsciously, against the hiring and advancement\n\nof women. Id. at ___, 131 S. Ct. at 2548, 180 L. Ed. 2d at 386. Yet, the\n\nCourt held “[r]espondents [did] not identif[y] a common mode of\n\nexercising discretion that pervades the entire company.” Id. at ___, 131\n\nS. Ct. at 2554–55, 180 L. Ed. 2d at 393.        The district court observed\n\nWal-Mart “highlights both the need to identify a particular employment\n\npractice,   the   pertinence   of   discretionary   decisionmaking    in   the\n\nemployment process, and the interconnection with statistical proof.”\n\n      The district court here found that “[t]he State’s system has both\n\nobjective and subjective components” which are “not so confused . . . as\n\nto prevent Plaintiffs from honing in on one particular employment\n\npractice.” This finding is supported by the record. For example, the DAS\n\nscreen that occurred at step one, the résumé score sheets that were part\n\nof step two in some departments, the second résumé screens and\n\nspelling and grammar screens that were part of step two in some\n\f                                     76\n\ndepartments, and the interview score sheets that were part of step three\n\nin some departments were objective components that could have been\n\nseparately analyzed. This was not a purely subjective process.\n\n      Furthermore, while there undoubtedly was subjectivity and—as\n\nthe plaintiffs credibly demonstrated—implicit bias in multiple State\n\nhiring decisions during the relevant time period, this case is a far cry\n\nfrom Chin, in which the decision-making process ultimately came down\n\nto a single individual’s discretion. By contrast here, the State’s hiring\n\ndecisions were in the hands of numerous department managers.           The\n\nState of Iowa Executive Branch employs a far more diverse range of job\n\ncategories than any of the defendants in the cases in which subjective\n\ndecision-making has served as a basis for attacking the decision-making\n\nprocess as a whole.    Those working for the State include corrections\n\nofficers, parole officers, registered nurses, food service workers, power\n\nplant engineers, state troopers, and DOT road-maintenance crew\n\nmembers, to name a few.      As noted by the district court, “The State\n\nsystem can be dissected into numerous decision-making stages among\n\nnumerous independent agencies of the executive branch,” and there is\n\n“inconsistency in results among the numerous agencies.” Miller showed\n\nthat, at step two, African Americans had a lower statistical likelihood of\n\ngetting an interview in some departments but not in others.          These\n\noutcomes could be due to either objective or subjective considerations,\n\nbut either way they do not suggest the existence of a common practice\n\n(even a subjective one) that would justify class-wide relief. See Wal-Mart,\n\n564 U.S. at ___, 131 S. Ct. at 2555–56, 180 L. Ed. 2d at 393 (noting that\n\ndiscretion when exercised by different managers in different ways is not\n\nin itself an employment practice).\n\f                                        77\n\n      No witness affirmatively testified the process was incapable of\n\nseparation for analysis.       To the contrary, the State’s expert, Miller,\n\n“emphatically” testified that the State’s hiring system was capable of\n\nseparation for analysis.        Plaintiffs on appeal do not challenge the\n\nadmissibility of Miller’s testimony.         His testimony alone constitutes\n\nsubstantial     evidence     supporting      the   district    court’s      finding.\n\nFurthermore, Miller actually did separate the process into the three steps\n\nfor purposes of his analysis.\n\n      Additionally, plaintiffs’ own experts testified that the State’s\n\ndecision-making process could be separated for analysis.             The district\n\ncourt noted that Greenwald conceded the State’s employment process\n\ncould be separated to individually analyze each step of the process and\n\ncommented “that one ‘could determine whether or not there was bias at\n\neach one of the independent stages of the hiring process.’ ”                 Kaiser\n\ndiscussed how written résumés and in-person interviews can trigger\n\nimplicit   racial   biases   differently.    The   State’s    statistical   expert,\n\nKillingsworth, utilized a regression analysis to evaluate the State’s hiring\n\nprocess using data from different stages of the process and different\n\ndepartments. The district court summarized:\n\n             Dr. Killingsworth was capable of separating data for\n      the referral stage, the interview stage, and the hiring stage\n      for African Americans as compared to whites over a period of\n      years.    His work permits a fact finder to analyze the\n      departments of the executive branch in each of those years\n      at each of those stages. This charting of State data allows a\n      fact finder to compare the various departments and draw\n      important conclusions as to how the individual departments\n      compare to each other at the various stages. While he\n      elected not to begin his analysis at the application stage, the\n      data available would permit this. And it could be used to\n      track applicant flow from that first stage to the hiring of one\n      applicant for the specific job opening in any given\n      department—including the progress of each applicant\n      through the various stages and examining the particular\n      screening-devices used.\n\f                                    78\n\nFurther, Killingsworth “could limit his models by new applicants or\n\nincumbent State employees, initial pay, and performance evaluations.”\n\nHowever, he did not correlate any of his findings to a particular screening\n\ndevice.\n\n      Significantly, Miller performed separate statistical analyses by\n\ndepartment on the three steps in the hiring process. In fact, as I discuss\n\nbelow, the NAACP relies on that analysis in pursuing an alternative\n\nargument for reversal.    Furthermore, Killingsworth, as quoted above,\n\nagreed with Miller that the three steps could be separated for purposes of\n\nanalysis.   Additionally, in four pages of findings on separability, the\n\ndistrict court repeatedly referred to expert testimony that indicated the\n\nstages of the process could be separated.\n\n      This does not foreclose the possibility of further separation, as the\n\ndistrict court found. For example, the record revealed other employment\n\npractices with potentially discriminatory effects such as résumé screens\n\ncould have been isolated and separately analyzed. But, in any event, the\n\nrecord supports the district court’s finding that the plaintiffs did not\n\nmeet their burden. Plaintiffs did not even attempt to challenge an actual\n\nemployment practice and simply argued that the “total result” (to use\n\nKillingsworth’s phrase) was discriminatory.\n\n      In response to plaintiffs’ “ripple effect” argument, the district court\n\nfound “the fact that one errant practice compounds a problem at a later\n\nstage of the process does not prevent investigation of either the earlier or\n\nlater separate stage or practice.”       I agree.   Though the use of a\n\ndiscriminatory criterion at one stage may impact applicants throughout a\n\ndecision-making process, such a “ripple effect” does not preclude\n\nseparate analysis. In some cases, subjective and objective criteria may\n\nbe so intertwined as to prevent separation. See McClain v. Lufkin Indus.,\n\f                                       79\n\nInc., 187 F.R.D. 267, 275 (E.D. Tex. 1999) (finding an employer’s actions\n\ninseparable for analysis when “[t]he disparate impacts begin on the day\n\none is hired and are potentially magnified each time one’s career . . .\n\nintersects a subjective decision-making process”).           But, plaintiffs here\n\nhave not proven this is such a case.           The very point of regression\n\nanalysis is to allow isolation of particular elements and determine\n\nwhether there is a “ripple effect.”\n\n         Finally, substantial evidence supports the district court’s finding\n\nthat the plaintiffs failed to show the condition of the paper files precluded\n\nseparate analysis of specific employment practices within the State’s\n\nhiring    process.     Killingsworth   never   looked   at    the   hiring   files.\n\nSignificantly, as the majority notes, the district court found “the hiring\n\nfiles themselves permit a focused view of the different screening-devices\n\nand practices in referral, interview or hiring of applicants for any given\n\njob between the departments.”          Plaintiffs make much of the missing\n\ndocuments from the files, but eighty-six percent of the files included\n\ninterview questions, eighty-one percent had interview notes, and seventy-\n\nthree percent provided an interview scoring matrix. Half of the files had\n\nreference checks.      Eighty-four percent of the files also contained an\n\nindividual’s application, résumé, and cover letter.            As the majority\n\nrecognizes, Greenwald commented, “The hiring files of the State are a\n\ngold mine that hasn’t been analyzed.”          There is no evidence that the\n\nplaintiffs took even one of the objective standards the State employed\n\nand tried to determine whether it had a disparate impact using the\n\navailable records.\n\n         Plaintiffs argue that the sample sizes would get smaller and\n\nstatistical reliability would decline as one tries to analyze the effect of a\n\npractice that was only employed in certain areas at certain times. This\n\f                                    80\n\nmay be correct, but does not excuse the failure to try. The statute does\n\nnot permit courts to aggregate a collection of different hiring practices\n\nacross different times and departments just to increase the size of the\n\nsample.\n\n      The only case plaintiffs cite in support of their argument that a\n\nlack of records can prevent separate analysis is the district court opinion\n\nin Chin.   Notably, the Second Circuit on appeal relied on a different\n\nrationale from the district court—i.e., that the process was basically\n\nentirely subjective and the final decision rested with one person. Chin,\n\n685 F.3d at 154–55. Stepping back and looking at Chin with the benefit\n\nof both opinions, the lack of records and the subjectivity of the process\n\nappear to be two sides of the same coin: No one documented why\n\nsomeone received a promotion because there was nothing to document.\n\nPort Auth. Police Asian Jade Soc. of N.Y. & N.J. Inc. v. Port Auth., 681\n\nF. Supp. 2d 456, 460–61, 464–65 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (finding the decision-\n\nmaking process could not be separated “both because records do not\n\nexist for every step and because the causal role of each step is called into\n\ndoubt by the records that do exist”). Here, by contrast, it is undeniable\n\nthat the records were incomplete, but equally irrefutable that no one who\n\ntried to analyze the records was unable to do so. As the district court\n\nfound,\n\n      [t]he State’s data—its recordkeeping—while not perfect, was\n      sufficient for both Dr. Killingsworth and Dr. Miller to\n      conduct their analyses. The presence in the record of their\n      models and opinions dispels the argument that the State’s\n      recordkeeping is such that it precludes anything but a\n      “systemic employment practice.”\n\nI conclude substantial evidence supports the district court’s findings\n\nregarding the State’s record keeping.\n\f                                    81\n\n      I reiterate the importance of separately analyzing the different\n\nprocesses used by the various departments.         In some departments,\n\nAfrican-American applicants fared better than white applicants at certain\n\nstages; in others they fared worse, even much worse. This suggests that\n\nthe different screening processes used by the departments may have had\n\ndifferent impacts on applicant success. As the district court noted, these\n\n“[v]arying outcomes between the departments and stages of the process\n\ninvite[] localized scrutiny.”\n\n      For example, based on the record in this case, I have concerns\n\nabout the various résumé screening devices used by State departments\n\nat the step-two level. It is certainly possible that inappropriate screening\n\ndevices may have been used in some of the departments in which Miller\n\nfound a statistically significant disparity between blacks and whites at\n\nstep two. But, it is just a possibility and not an aspect of the case that\n\nthe plaintiffs chose to pursue.\n\n      Here, the district court observed that “the hiring files themselves\n\npermit a focused view of the different screening-devices and practices in\n\nreferral, interview or hiring of applicants for any given job between the\n\ndepartments.” For example, as the court pointed out, DAS has a system-\n\nwide applicant screening manual, and an analysis could have been\n\nperformed based on the manner in which DAS instructs managers on the\n\nuse of the manual.\n\n      The district court went on to comment that “one can focus on any\n\nnumber of discrete employment decisions made as individual, separable,\n\nidentifiable particular employment practices” and then gave two more\n\nexamples:\n\n            One example of the separability of the process is the\n      ‘second résumé screen’ that had been utilized by some\n      departments. It was a particular employment practice that\n\f                                       82\n      was evaluated, determined to be inappropriate, and curtailed\n      at the suggestion of DAS. Similar refinement of the hiring\n      process by focusing on the inappropriate use of ‘spelling and\n      grammar screening’ is another example of DAS having\n      addressed a particular employment practice. The record\n      reflects not only the ability to focus on these particular\n      employment practices but when and which separate\n      agencies responded to the suggested changes by DAS.\n\n      The foregoing has shown why I am confident the court reached the\n\nright conclusion.    The district court methodically went through the\n\nrecord, focused appropriately on the testimony of statistical experts for\n\neach side, and identified various employment practices that could have\n\nbeen separately analyzed, including the three steps in the employment\n\npractice (separately analyzed by Miller) and more specific practices within\n\nthose steps.\n\n      For all these reasons, I conclude substantial evidence supports the\n\ndistrict court’s finding that the plaintiffs failed to show the State’s\n\nemployment practices are not capable of separation for purposes of\n\nanalysis. I close with three observations.\n\n      First, it is significant that the NAACP, in a well-argued amicus\n\nbrief, relies on some of the same data that plaintiffs dismiss as\n\ninadequate. Thus, the NAACP asserts that Miller’s findings show there\n\nwas an adverse impact at step two in eight departments that employed\n\napproximately fifty-eight percent of the State workforce. On that basis, it\n\nasks us to reverse the district court.\n\n      In my view, the NAACP’s brief raises serious questions as to\n\nwhether the State committed unlawful discrimination. The problem with\n\nthis argument is that it is not the case the plaintiffs elected to pursue.\n\nFor instance, we do not know what practices were followed in those eight\n\ndepartments    during    step   two.        This   seems   like   a   relatively\n\nstraightforward inquiry that could have been pursued in discovery. We\n\f                                    83\n\nalso do not know which representative plaintiffs—if any—applied for jobs\n\nwith those departments.     And, the remedies sought by the plaintiffs\n\nwould apply not only to those departments but to the State as a whole.\n\n      Instead of narrowing their focus, plaintiffs brought a class action\n\nalleging a common pattern of discrimination by the entire state executive\n\nbranch of government. Having brought such a large case, it was then up\n\nto the plaintiffs to undertake the considerable work required to prove it.\n\nUnder the prevailing law, this included analysis of specific hiring\n\npractices and their impact. Plaintiffs did not meet their burden.\n      Second, I do not downplay what this case has shown.             Even\naccording to Miller, it appears African Americans on the whole were\ndisadvantaged in getting job interviews from some agencies, including\nsome large departments like the department of human services and the\ndepartment of transportation. This conclusion, from a defense expert, is\ndisturbing although inconclusive.        The district court, in my view\ncorrectly, questioned why “given all this data held by the State, it did not\non a regular basis review it, as did these experts, with an eye toward\nmeasuring impact.”\n      Third, it bears emphasis that the defeat of this class action does\nnot bar a person who believes he or she was a victim of discrimination\nfrom bringing an individual lawsuit on his or her own against the State\nfor new acts of discrimination. What is clear here is that plaintiffs failed\nto prove, because they ultimately did not try to prove, that the State of\nIowa engaged in specific employment practices that had discriminatory\neffects against African-American job applicants and that would allow for\nclass-wide relief.\n      For the foregoing reasons, I agree the district court’s judgment\nmust be affirmed.\n      Mansfield and Zager, JJ., join this special concurrence.\n\f",

For the reasons\n\nexpressed below, we affirm the decision of the district court.\n\n      I. Factual and Procedural Background.\n\n      There are thirty-seven departments within the executive branch of\n\nthe State of Iowa. Each exercises its own hiring authority.              The State\n\nemploys a merit hiring system, which establishes “a system of human\n\nresource administration based on merit principles and scientific methods\n\nto   govern     the   appointment,        compensation,     promotion,    welfare,\n\ndevelopment, transfer, layoff, removal, and discipline of its civil\n\nemployees, and other incidents of state employment.”                    Iowa Code\n\n§ 8A.411(1).     The Code further directs that “[a]ll appointments and\n\npromotions to positions covered by the state merit system shall be made\n\nsolely on the basis of merit and fitness, to be ascertained by\n\nexaminations or other appropriate screening methods.” Id. § 8A.411(3).\n\n      The      Iowa   Department     of    Administrative    Services    (DAS)   is\n\nresponsible for ensuring that hiring decisions are made in accordance\n\nwith the merit system. See id. § 8A.104(12) (“The director [of DAS] shall\n\n. . . [e]xamine and develop best practices for the efficient operation of\n\ngovernment and encourage state agencies to adopt and implement these\n\npractices.”). DAS is tasked with providing rules for the departments to\n\nfollow. See id. § 8A.413(1) (DAS adopts rules for the administration of\n\nthe merit employment system).              DAS collects statewide data and\n\f                                         4\n\nmonitors compliance.       In order to comply with the stated goals of the\n\nmerit system, DAS has a wide range of options, including retaining\n\nindependent consultants.1 Upon request, DAS assigns personnel officers\nas human resource advisors to various departments to assist with\n\nemployment functions, such as providing materials and training, helping\n\ndevelop screening tools, and assisting with hiring.\n\n       Applicants to executive branch positions, as well as current\n\nemployees applying for promotions, submit applications to DAS, either\n\nonline or by hard copy.           DAS maintains electronic data on every\n\napplicant and application in their database, the BrassRing.2 The district\n\ncourt summarized the hiring system as employing three separate\n\ndecision-making steps: (1) “DAS receives applications for merit-covered\n\njob posting, screens those applications for basic eligibility of the job\n\nclassification, and refers eligible applicants to the hiring department”\n\n(emphasis omitted) (referral); (2) “the hiring department screens the\n\nreferred applicants for the job-title specific requirements, determines\n\nwhich candidates to interview” (interview selection); and (3) “the hiring\n\ndepartment interviews the selected candidates and decides which\n\ncandidate to offer the job” (hire or promotion).\n       Although all departments follow the general practices of the merit\n\nsystem, their practices in the hiring process vary. These varied practices\n\ninclude: using a second résumé screen, requiring candidates to more\n\n\n       1Violation  of the human-resources subchapter of Iowa Code chapter 8A or DAS’s\nregulations is a simple misdemeanor. Iowa Code § 8A.458. Further, “[t]he director may\ninstitute and maintain any action or proceeding at law or in equity that the director\nconsiders necessary or appropriate to secure compliance with this subchapter and the\nrules and orders under this subchapter.” Id. § 8A.453(1).\n       2DAS converted to the BrassRing system between 2004 and 2006. Before this,\n\nthe State used the AS-400 system.\n\f                                        5\n\nfully explain how their experiences qualify them for a specific job\n\nfunction, or requiring a typing test.       Each department maintains data\n\nrelating to each applicant, which is stored in paper hiring files, unlike the\n\nDAS data system, which is electronic. Each paper hiring file contains a\n\nBrassRing registration number so a correlation between a specific job\n\nposting and the applicant’s performance on the screening devices and/or\n\ninterview records can be correlated.\n\n      In this case, fourteen3 African-American plaintiffs brought a\n\nlawsuit under both Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended,\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e–2000e-17 (2006), and the Iowa Civil Rights Act of\n\n1965, as amended, Iowa Code chapter 216.\n\n      In their petition, the plaintiffs alleged that the State of Iowa,\n\nincluding the thirty-seven different executive branch departments,\n\nengaged in practices that resulted in a failure to maintain a diverse,\n\nnondiscriminatory workplace through its merit employment system. The\n\nplaintiffs contend that because of the State’s failure to enforce extant\n\nstatutory and regulatory policies, a disproportionate number of African\n\nAmericans were denied an equal opportunity for employment.                  They\n\nclaim this was the natural unintended consequences of the State’s failure\n\nto follow rules designed to ensure equal opportunity in the workplace\n\nand was not done intentionally or with malice.\n\n      Further, the plaintiffs alleged that in May of 2006 they provided\n\nthe State of Iowa with a document entitled “Initial Evidentiary Report,”\n\nalleging systemic racial bias and a pattern of retaliation by top managers\n\nand officials of the State of Iowa. The plaintiffs further alleged that the\n\n      3The  plaintiffs’ lawsuit was filed in October 2007 and subsequently amended\nthree times, adding nine additional plaintiffs, for a total of twenty-three named\nplaintiffs.\n\f                                     6\n\nState hired a consultant to study employment practices in late 2006 or\n\nearly 2007 who produced a report known as the CPS Report.                 The\n\nplaintiffs alleged that the Initial Evidentiary Report and the CPS Report\n\nput the State on notice that the hiring practices of the State imposed\n\nbarriers to equal employment opportunities for African Americans.\n\n      On September 28, 2010, on stipulation of the parties, the district\n\ncourt ordered certification of the case as a class action.         The class\n\ndefinition and class claim were:\n\n      CLASS DEFINITION: All African American applicants or\n      employees who sought appointment to or held a merit-\n      system position with an Executive Branch agency (not\n      including Board of Regents) at any point from July 1, 2003\n      through [date of Court’s decision regarding liability].\n      CLASS CLAIM: Disparate Impact or Adverse Impact\n      discrimination with respect to hiring and promotion\n      decisions and/or unequal terms and conditions of\n      employment associated with those decisions under Title VII\n      and the Iowa Civil Rights Act arising from subjective,\n      discretionary decision-making permitted by the State’s\n      abdication of statutory or regulatory responsibilities and\n      obligations and/or failure to follow its own policies.\n\n      The case came to trial on September 12, 2011.             The plaintiffs\n\noffered evidence relating to the efforts of the State to document its\n\nemployment practices, expert testimony by a statistical expert, labor\neconomist Mark Killingsworth, social science testimony from psychology\n\nprofessors Anthony Greenwald and Cheryl Kaiser, testimony from DAS\n\nrepresentatives and personnel, and anecdotal testimony from various\n\nplaintiffs related to their experience with state government.\n\n      In support of the plaintiffs’ claims, Killingsworth testified that\n\nbased on his statistical work employing conventional and probit\n\f                                          7\n\nregression analysis4 statistical procedures, African Americans were\n\ntreated differently and more disadvantageously than whites with respect\n\nto the referral of applications by DAS for interviews, with respect to the\n\nselection for interviews by various agencies and departments, and with\n\nrespect to ultimate hiring. Further, he opined that once hired, African\n\nAmericans have lower salaries within a given job title or are hired for job\n\ntitles that pay less than others, and were treated differently in\n\nperformance evaluations. In making his calculations, Killingsworth only\n\nanalyzed applicants who had been deemed by DAS to meet the minimum\n\nqualifications for the job classification and had been referred to\n\ndepartments. He approached the data from a variety of perspectives, as\n\nhis analytical models could include or exclude different variables.\n\nRegarding the separability of the elements in the hiring process,\n\nKillingsworth testified:\n\n       [I]t’s not that it’s incapable of being separated, but I think\n       there are very serious questions about whether it can\n       reliably be separated, which is a different story.\n       Mechanically, one could certainly separate it. And I know\n       [this] because [the State’s] experts have done [it.]\n\n       The    plaintiffs   offered   social    science    evidence    through     two\n\npsychology     professors:     Anthony        Greenwald     and    Cheryl     Kaiser.\n\nGreenwald’s field of study is implicit social cognition, a phrase which he\n\nintroduced in a coauthored article in 1995.              According to Greenwood,\n\nimplicit bias, also known as hidden or unconscious bias, is a person’s\n\n\n       4The  district court described the difference between conventional and probit\nregression analysis as follows:\n       a [conventional] regression analysis seeks to predict or forecast how a\n       dependent variable might change based upon changes in one or more\n       independent variables. The probit analysis differs primarily in that the\n       dependent value in that context may only have one of two values.\n\f                                     8\n\nautomatic preference for one race over another. He asserted that it was\n\npossible that implicit bias affected Iowa decision-makers in this case,\n\nalthough he did not review any of the hiring files, nor any specific\n\nemployment decisions relating to any class members. He could not rule\n\nout other race-neutral causes for the statistical imbalance in the State’s\n\nhiring system. In his opinion, even in the best case scenario, bias could\n\nstill unconsciously invade the State’s hiring process.\n\n      Kaiser studies stereotyping and prejudice and their effects on\n\ndecision-making. She testified that she viewed implicit bias as pervasive\n\nand believed all people fall within a spectrum with explicit bias on one\n\nend and limited implicit bias on the other. She opined that training and\n\naccountability, including recordkeeping, are means of reducing implicit\n\nbias and, if used more extensively by the State, would have a positive\n\neffect on reducing the implicit bias in the State system.\n\n      Additionally, several class members, referring to documents\n\nrelating to their applications for hire or promotion, testified at trial and\n\noffered examples in which, they claim, the hiring system did not function\n\nas intended.    These examples included: a qualified African-American\n\napplicant who was not referred to a department by DAS, due to DAS\n\nincorrectly reporting the applicant was not qualified; in some cases,\n\nrésumés of African Americans were marked to highlight spelling and\n\ngrammatical errors; and some hiring files contained African-Americans’\n\nrésumés, but not the screening devices used to score or evaluate them.\n\n      The plaintiffs buttressed the testimony of their witnesses with the\n\nCPS Report, a review of the State’s hiring practices commissioned by the\n\nState, prepared by human resources consultants in response to\n\nexpressed concerns about racial discrimination in state employment.\n\nThe CPS Report found, among other things, that during fiscal years\n\f                                       9\n\n2004–2006,      qualified   minority   applicants   were   interviewed   less\n\nfrequently than qualified white applicants (13.46% for minorities and\n\n20.24% for whites), figures which the authors noted “may support the\n\nperception of discriminatory hiring practices.” Further, the report noted\n\nthat while African Americans constituted six percent of the total qualified\n\npool, they represented no more than 2.8% of the total hires for fiscal\n\nyears 2004–2006.        By comparison, whites represented eighty-eight\n\npercent of the qualified applicants and ninety-one percent of the total\n\nhires.      The CPS Report noted that the statistical difference in\n\nemployment appeared to arise from the process between the referral step\n\nand the interview step (African Americans were reduced from 5.95%\n\nreferred to 3.47% interviewed of the total applicant pool for fiscal years\n\n2004–2006 combined) and the process between the interview step and\n\nthe hire decision (African Americans were reduced to 2.82% while whites\n\nincreased to 91.52%).        According to the CPS Report, “The actual\n\npersonnel decisions may create a rebuttable inference of adverse impact.”\n\nIt recommended that DAS “institute a policy of regular and systematic\n\noversight . . . to ensure compliance with [required] policies and\n\nprocedures.”     The CPS Report cautioned, however, that because the\n\nState’s application tracking system (the BrassRing) did not track\n\nindividual people, but rather applications, it was difficult to identify with\n\nany certainty the exact makeup of the applicant pool or the actual\n\nnumber of applicants.\n\n         The State offered evidence related to the decision-making process\n\nin state government. It also offered the testimony of economist Robert\n\nMiller, who was tasked by the State with analyzing Killingsworth’s\n\nfindings and examining the employment outcomes in Iowa state\n\ngovernment to determine if African Americans were systemically\n\f                                          10\n\ndisadvantaged. Miller found Killingsworth’s reports to be incomplete and\n\nhis conclusions not well-founded. He testified that, in his opinion, there\n\nwas   no    statistically   significant    evidence   of   system    wide   racial\n\ndiscrimination in the merit employment system in the State of Iowa.\n\nMiller also testified that it was possible for the plaintiffs to break down\n\nthe aggregate analysis into more discrete consideration of employment\n\ndecisions by department or by other classifications.\n\n      On April 17, 2012, the district court filed a detailed and thoughtful\n\nfifty-six page decision in favor of the State. The district court first noted\n\nthat with regard to the plaintiffs’ first theory, even assuming that “the\n\ncomponents of the decision-making process in this case are not capable\n\nof being separated, [the] Plaintiffs have failed to provide legal authority\n\nfor concluding that ‘abdication of statutory or regulatory responsibilities\n\nand obligations and/or failure to follow its own policies’ is a particular\n\nemployment practice.” Next, in regards to the plaintiffs’ second theory,\n\nthe court found the plaintiffs had not carried their burden of\n\n“demonstrating the inseparability of the employment system components\n\nfor analytical purposes.” The court concluded “[t]he former theory fail[ed]\n\nas a matter of law; the latter as a matter of fact.”\n\n      Alternatively, looking to the plaintiffs’ statistical and implicit bias\n\nevidence, the district court noted that the plaintiffs failed to prove the\n\ncausation element of their disparate impact claim.                  The plaintiffs\n\nappealed.\n\n      II.

Overview of Legal Framework Established by Modern State\nand Federal Civil Rights Acts.\n\n      A. Context of State and Federal Legislation. The issues raised\n\nin this case cannot be approached without consideration of the larger\n\ncontext in which they arise. The legacy of slavery and Jim Crow may be\n\nin the past, but their effects cast a shadow into the present. Specifically,\n\nAfrican Americans continue to be underrepresented in many categories\n\nof employment. While the days of “Whites Only Need Apply” signage are\n\nfortunately long passed, institutional barriers to equality of economic\n\f                                    12\n\nopportunity remain intractable.

Historical Development of Disparate Impact. There are two\n\ndistinct theories of liability under civil rights laws for discrimination in\n\nemployment, namely, cases involving disparate treatment and cases\n\ninvolving disparate impact. See Int’l Bhd. of Teamsters, 431 U.S. at 335\n\nn.15, 97 S. Ct. at 1854 n.15, 52 L. Ed. 2d at 415 n.15. In a disparate\n\ntreatment case, the plaintiff bears the burden of showing he or she has\n\nbeen harmed by discriminatory animus of the employer. See id. at 357,\n\n97 S. Ct. at 1866, 52 L. Ed. 2d at 429. Proving discriminatory animus is\n\noften a difficult task as it involves probing the subjective motivations of\n\nthe decision-maker.   Although cases of blatant racism still exist, most\n\ndiscrimination is more subtle and difficult to demonstrate.\n\n      In the alternative, however, a civil rights claim may be brought\n\nbased on disparate impact. In a disparate impact case, what matters is\n\nnot the subjective motivation of the employer, but the effects of an\n\nemployment practice. See Teal, 457 U.S. at 447 n.8, 102 S. Ct. at 2531\n\nn.8, 73 L.

See Stewart J. Schwab & Steven L. Willburn,\n\nReasonable Accommodation of Workplace Disabilities, 44 Wm. & Mary L.\n\nRev. 1197, 1201 (2003) (characterizing disparate impact cases as “non-\n\ncore cases of discrimination under Title VII”).       But this is at least\n\nsomewhat misleading.      Concern about institutional barriers to equal\n\nopportunity in employment predated civil rights statutes and can be seen\n\nat the beginning of the modern civil rights movement.         For example,\n\nPresident Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8802 in June of 1941, which\n\nprohibited discrimination by race by private employers engaged in\n\ngovernment contracting and created a Fair Employment Practices\n\nCommission which monitored broad trends, pushed and cajoled\n\nemployers in the war industries, and assessed the bottom line in terms of\n\noverall progress.   See Susan D. Carle, How Myth-Busting About the\n\nHistorical Goals of Civil Rights Activism Can Illuminate Future Paths, 7\n\nStan. J. C.R. & C.L. 167, 172–73 (2011); see also Exec. Order No. 8802,\n\n6 Fed. Reg. 3109 (June 25, 1941).         Disparate impact claims may be\n\ncomplex and complicated, but they are not disfavored.\n\n      C. Treatment of Disparate Impact Analysis Under Title VII of\n\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964 by the United States Supreme Court.\n\n      1. Introduction. Although federal law is not controlling on state\n\nlaw questions, we begin substantive discussion of disparate impact\n\nanalysis with an overview of cases of the United States Supreme Court.\n\nThe reason for this is simple: in a series of disparate impact cases, the\n\nSupreme Court has developed doctrine in both majority and dissenting\n\nopinions in considerable detail. Further, one of the claims in this case\n\nwas brought under federal law. On the federal law claim, of course, the\n\f                                    15\n\ndecisions of the United States Supreme Court constitute binding\n\nauthority which we must faithfully apply in our interpretation of federal\n\nlaw.   With respect to the state law claim, the reasoning of the United\n\nStates Supreme Court opinions, and the dissenting opinions, may well be\n\npersuasive, although it is certainly not binding upon us.      As a result,\n\nunderstanding the range of interpretive options for state courts in\n\ninterpreting state law can be enhanced by analysis of majority and\n\ndissenting opinions of the United States Supreme Court.\n\n       2. Griggs: A unanimous court’s broad construction of the Federal\n\nCivil Rights Act. The first decision of the United States Supreme Court\n\nwhich considered a case based on disparate impact was Griggs, 401 U.S.\n\nat 424, 91 S. Ct. at 849, 28 L. Ed. 2d at 158. In Griggs, the Supreme\n\nCourt considered a class action alleging that the requirement of a high\n\nschool education or passing a standardized general intelligence test as a\n\ncondition of employment violated the Federal Civil Rights Act. Id. at 425–\n\n26, 91 S. Ct. at 851, 28 L. Ed. 2d at 161. In Griggs, the plaintiff asserted\n\nthat neither “standard [was] shown to be significantly related to job\n\nperformance,” that both standards operated to disqualify African\n\nAmericans at a substantially higher rate than white applicants, and that\n\nthe jobs in question had been previously filled by whites only as a result\n\nof long-standing practice. Id. at 426, 91 S. Ct. at 851, 28 L. Ed. 2d at\n\n161.\n\n       A unanimous Supreme Court found for the plaintiffs. As noted by\n\nChief Justice Burger, “[P]ractices, procedures, or tests neutral on their\n\nface, and even neutral in terms of intent, cannot be maintained if they\n\noperate to ‘freeze’ the status quo of prior discriminatory employment\n\npractices.” Id. at 430, 91 S. Ct. at 853, 28 L. Ed. 2d at 163. In much\n\nquoted language, Chief Justice Burger noted that the Federal Civil Rights\n\f                                    16\n\nAct “proscribes not only overt discrimination but also practices that are\n\nfair in form, but discriminatory in operation.” Id. at 431, 91 S. Ct. at\n\n853, 28 L. Ed. 2d at 164. Further, the Chief Justice noted that “good\n\nintent or absence of discriminatory intent does not redeem employment\n\nprocedures or testing mechanisms that operate as ‘built-in headwinds’\n\nfor minority groups and are unrelated to measuring job capability.” Id.\n\nat 432, 91 S. Ct. at 854, 28 L. Ed. 2d at 165. Again, the Chief Justice\n\nnoted that “Congress directed the thrust of [the Federal Civil Rights Act]\n\nto   the   consequences   of   employment     practices,   not   simply   the\n\nmotivation.” Id. (emphasis omitted).\n\n      Griggs clearly established that a civil rights claim could be based\n\non   disparate   impact   without   proving   discriminatory     animus    or\n\nmotivation in cases involving objective standardized tests or employment\n\ncriteria. See id. at 436, 91 S. Ct. at 856, 28 L. Ed. 2d at 167. But what\n\nabout a claim that the exercise of subjective discretion of supervisory\n\nemployees has produced illegal discrimination?\n\n      3.   Watson: The court divided.    The first United States Supreme\n\nCourt case to consider a federal civil rights claim based upon a subjective\n\ndecision-making process was Watson v.

In Watson, all\n\nparticipating members of the Supreme Court held that a claim could be\n\nbrought based upon the exercise of subjective discretion, but the court\n\nsplit sharply on the contours and scope of such a disparate impact\n\nclaim.

According to the\n\nplaintiffs, if disparate impact analysis were confined to objective tests, an\n\nemployer would be able to simply substitute subjective criteria having\n\nsubstantially identical effects.

On\n\nthe other hand, according to the defendants, recognizing a claim of\n\ndisparate impact in a subjective selection process would make the claims\n\nso impossibly difficult to defend that employers would be forced to adopt\n\nnumerical quotas in order to avoid liability.         Id. at 989, 108 S. Ct. at\n\n2786, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 842.\n\n      Justice O’Connor seemed to agree with the arguments of both\n\nparties. In section IIB of her opinion, which was joined by all members of\n\nthe Court, she recognized that Griggs “could largely be nullified if\n\ndisparate impact analysis were applied only to standardized selection\n\npractices.”   Id. She further wrote that disparate impact analysis is in\n\nprinciple “no less applicable to subjective employment criteria than to\n\nobjective or standardized tests.” Id. at 990, 108 S. Ct. at 2786, 101 L.\n\nEd. 2d at 842.        In addition, Justice O’Connor observed that while an\n\nemployer’s policy of leaving promotion decisions to unchecked discretion\n\nof   lower    level   supervisors   should   itself   raise   no   inference   of\n\ndiscriminatory conduct, it does not follow that “supervisors to whom this\n\ndiscretion is delegated always act without discriminatory intent.” Id. In\n\naddition, in an observation of particular interest in this case, Justice\n\nO’Connor noted that even without overt discriminatory intent, “the\n\f                                          18\n\nproblem of subconscious stereotypes and prejudices would remain.” Id.\n\nat 990, 108 S.

Now writing for only four members of the\n\nCourt, she pivoted to express concerns about the use of “bare statistics”\n\nin a subjective decision-making case that an employer could rebut only\n\nupon a showing of “business necessity” or “job relatedness.” Id. at 991–\n\n93, 108 S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 843–44 (citations and\n\ninternal quotation marks omitted).                She expressed concern that\n\nemployers would find it difficult to validate subjective selection criteria\n\nand impossible to defend and, as a result, would engage in a\n\nsurreptitious quota system. Id. at 992–93, 108 S. Ct. at 2787–88, 101 L.\n\nEd. 2d at 843–44. She observed that it would be “completely unrealistic\n\nto assume that unlawful discrimination is the sole cause of people failing\n\nto gravitate to jobs and employers in accord with the laws of chance.” Id.\n\nat 992, 108 S. Ct. at 2787, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 843. She further noted that\n\n“[i]t would be equally unrealistic to suppose that employers can\n\neliminate, or discover . . ., the myriad of innocent causes that may lead\n\nto statistical imbalances” in the workplace.

In a footnote,\n\nJustice O’Connor noted that lower courts have sometimes looked to the\n\nEEOC’s Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures and\n\nadopted an enforcement rule that an inference of discrimination could\n\nnot be drawn unless members of a particular race, sex or ethic group are\n\nselected at a rate less than four-fifths of the group with the highest\n\nselection rating.

Even if\n\nsuch a relationship is present, according to Justice Blackmun, the\n\nplaintiff may show that “other selection processes that have a lesser\n\ndiscriminatory effect could also serve . . . the employer’s [legitimate]\n\nbusiness needs.” Id. at 1005–06, 108 S.

An evenly divided court, however,\n\nhad different visions of the scope and contour of disparate impact\n\nanalysis on subjective decision-making.     The plurality, joining Justice\n\nO’Connor, was prepared to modify the burdens of proof in order to\n\nenhance the ability of an employer to defend disparate impact claims\n\narising from subjective decision-making, while Justice Blackmun feared\n\nthe modification of law proposed by Justice O’Connor would provide an\n\nescape hatch for employers from potential liability.\n\n      4.

Even for an often divided Supreme Court, the holdings in\n\nWards Cove can only be characterized as bitterly contested.\n\n      It should be emphasized that nothing in the language of Title VII\n\ncompelled the result in Wards Cove or the position of the dissents.\n\nInstead, as one commentator has noted, the battle over proper\n\ninterpretation   of   open-ended    language   of   Title   VII   was   over\n\nunderstandings about “whether discrimination is still happening” in the\n\nmodern workplace, about “how it manifests itself,” and about how society\n\f                                     24\n\nshould address such concerns. See Sandra F. Sperino, Revitalizing State\n\nEmployment Discrimination Law, 20 Geo. Mason L. Rev. 545, 546 (2013)\n\n[hereinafter Sperino, Revitalizing]. It seems fair to say that the majority\n\non the Supreme Court saw racial discrimination in employment as\n\nprimarily a relic of the past that does not require broad remedial\n\nmeasures, while the minority saw racial discrimination more like an\n\nintractable and enduring part of the American landscape.\n\n      5.     The Civil Rights Act of 1991: Congress reacts to narrow\n\nconstruction by the Supreme Court.        Because it was decided over two\n\ndecades ago, it is easy to forget the controversy that Wards Cove\n\nengendered.    Civil rights advocates were outraged by the decision and\n\nother decisions of what seemed to be an increasingly hostile Supreme\n\nCourt.     The decision in Wards Cove was compared to the 1883 Civil\n\nRights Cases and was said to foretell the end of the Second\n\nReconstruction that commenced with Brown v.

See\n\nRunkel, 35 Wm. & Mary L. Rev. at 1198. In the end, after an intense\n\nperiod of diplomacy between warring factions, Congress passed the Civil\n\nRights Act of 1991. Pub. L.

According to the\n\nstatute, the purpose of the Act was “to codify the concepts of ‘business\nnecessity’ and ‘job related’ enunciated by the Supreme Court in Griggs v.\n\nDuke Power Co., . . . and in other Supreme Court decisions prior to\n\nWards Cove Packing Co.” and to “respond to recent decisions of the\n\nSupreme Court by expanding the scope of relevant civil rights statutes in\n\norder to provide adequate protection to victims of discrimination.”   Id.\n\n§ 3(2), (4). The Act also addressed the Wards Cove ruling regarding the\n\ngeneral requirement of identification of particular employment practices.\n\nId. § 105(a) (codified at 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)(1)).    While Congress\n\ngenerally required that a plaintiff identify particular employment\n\npractices that cause disparate impact, Congress also provided that the\n\ndecision-making process could be challenged as a whole under certain\n\ncircumstances. Specifically, Congress provided:\n\f                                      27\n      With respect to demonstrating that a particular employment\n      practice causes a disparate impact . . . the complaining party\n      shall demonstrate that each particular challenged\n      employment practice causes a disparate impact, except that\n      if the complaining party can demonstrate to the court that\n      the elements of a respondent’s decisionmaking process are\n      not capable of separation for analysis, the decisionmaking\n      process may be analyzed as one employment practice.\n\nId. § 105(a) (codified at 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)(1)(B)(i)).\n\n      The language in the Civil Rights Act of 1991 did not include the\n\nspecific language regarding record keeping that was present in the\n\nunsuccessful Civil Rights Act of 1990, but the general language used in\n\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1991 to establish an exception to the identification\n\nof particular employment practices was stated in terms broad enough to\n\ncover situations where an employer fails to keep records.\n\n      6. Wal-Mart: Sharp divisions again.        The last significant United\n\nStates Supreme Court case regarding disparate impact is Wal-Mart\n\nStores. In this case, the Supreme Court considered a nationwide class\n\naction brought by female employees on behalf of some 1.5 million current\n\nand former female employees of Wal-Mart stores.

In those cases, the parties did not\n\nargue that state law should be interpreted differently than federal law.\n\nNonetheless, it is generally true that “Iowa courts have traditionally\n\nlooked to federal law for guidance in interpreting” the Iowa Civil Rights\n\nAct. Pecenka v. Fareway Stores, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2179214\"><a href=\"/opinion/2179214/pecenka-v-fareway-stores-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">672</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">800</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 803 (Iowa 2003).\n\nWe are, however, “not bound by federal law, despite consistent utilization\n\nof the federal analytical framework.”     Id.

It is true that in Hy-Vee, we cited\n\nWards Cove in describing the differences between discriminatory\n\ntreatment and discriminatory impact cases. See Hy-Vee, 453 N.W.2d at\n\n518–19. We did not, however, adopt the holdings in Wards Cove lock,\n\nstock, and barrel, and in no case has a party asked us to consider the\n\nmerits of the minority opinion in Wards Cove or some other approach\n\nunder the Iowa Civil Rights Act.     In Hy-Vee, there was no question\n\nregarding the presence of a particular discriminatory practice, namely,\n\nthe sexual segregation of stocker and checker positions. See id. at 520.\n\n      Similarly, with respect to Wal-Mart, we have had no occasion to\n\nconsider whether the majority or minority opinion in this 5–4 decision\n\nhas the most persuasive power. We thus have a number of interpretive\n\noptions under the Iowa Civil Rights Act. Do we follow the majority or the\n\nminority in Wards Cove or Wal-Mart? Or, do we follow a third path?\n\n      While Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1991 in response to\n\nWards Cove, no similar amendment has been made to the Iowa Civil\n\nRights Act.    The fact that Congress enacted a legislative change in\n\nresponse to a binding majority opinion of the United States Supreme\n\nCourt does not have persuasive force in the interpretation of the Iowa\n\nCivil Rights Act. We have not adopted the principles of Wards Cove in\n\nthe construction of the Iowa Civil Rights Act and are not bound to do so.\n\nCongressional reaction to a specific case decided by the United States\n\nSupreme Court does not shed light on the meaning of state law when\n\nthere has been no comparable narrow state court precedent to stimulate\n\na legislative override.\n\n      E. Academic Literature on Disparate Impact in the Setting of\n\nSubjective Decision-Making.      There is a body of literature grappling\n\f                                     31\n\nwith disparate impact theory in the context of subjective decision-\n\nmaking.     In a ground breaking article in 1993, David Benjamin\n\nOppenheimer suggested that negligence theory might be a basis for\n\ndisparate impact theory.     See David Benjamin Oppenheimer, Negligent\n\nDiscrimination, 141 U. Pa. L. Rev. 899, 899 (1993) (examining\n\n“psychological and sociological data on racism [to] demonstrate why\n\ndiscrimination is more closely analogous to negligent conduct than it is\n\nto intentional conduct”). This article has spawned significant offspring in\n\nthe literature.    See generally, e.g., Elizabeth Tippett, Robbing a Barren\n\nVault: The Implications of Dukes v. Wal-Mart for Cases Challenging\n\nSubjective Employment Practices, 29 Hofstra Lab. & Emp. L.J. 433\n\n(2012).\n\n      There is reason to believe that at least some members of the United\n\nStates Supreme Court might be interested in negligence theory in the\n\ncontext of subjective decision-making. At oral argument in the Wal-Mart\n\nmatter, Justice Kennedy and Justice Roberts asked questions about\n\nwhether the plaintiff was advancing a “notice theory,” namely, that an\n\nemployer aware of the discriminatory impact of its subjective practices\n\nmay be liable under the Federal Civil Rights Act. See Deborah M. Weiss,\n\nA Grudging Defense of Wal-Mart v. Dukes, 24 Yale J.L. & Feminism 119,\n\n123 (2012).       The plaintiffs’ lawyer apparently walked away from the\n\ntheory.   See id. at 123, 167–68 (advocating a notice liability approach\n\nwhen an employer is aware of problems and does not fashion an\n\nappropriate remedy).\n\n      IV. Discussion of Specific Employment Practice and Incapable\nof Separation for Analysis Issues.\n\n      A. Positions of the Parties.\n\f                                        32\n\n       1. The plaintiffs.    The plaintiffs generally claim that the district\n\ncourt erred in finding that the plaintiffs failed to show that the State’s job\n\nselection process was not capable of separation for analysis. According\n\nto the plaintiffs, the primary issue on appeal is “whether Defendants’\n\ncommon hiring and promotion system permitted [the Plaintiffs] to\n\nperform statistical analysis of [selection methods or protection practices]\n\nor elements of decision-making.”\n\n       In support of their argument, the plaintiffs claim that the\n\ndefendants failed to properly record the use or lack of use of any specific\n\nemployment practices applied by any of the thirty-seven executive\n\nbranch departments, thus making a statistical analysis of any separate\n\nelement impossible. The plaintiffs challenge both the lack of aggregate\n\ndata   maintained    by     DAS   and   the    underlying   documentation    in\n\ndepartment hiring files.\n\n       The plaintiffs point out that DAS is responsible for the oversight of\n\nmerit and affirmative action in employment.            Yet, according to the\n\nplaintiffs, the information maintained by DAS did not contain data\n\nsufficient to allow analysis of specific employment practices.              The\n\nplaintiffs note that the district court correctly found that “DAS retains no\n\ndata, computerized or otherwise, that allows one to see how a certain\n\nperson was screened and/or scored as compared to another applicant by\n\na department.”      Thus, the information maintained by DAS was not\n\ncapable of separation for analysis because you could not compare the\n\ntreatment of one applicant to another in any objective way, a necessary\n\nfoundation in aggregate statistical analysis.\n\n       The plaintiffs then turn to the underlying, hard copy records\n\nmaintained by the departments.               The plaintiffs note that under\n\napplicable administrative regulations, agencies are required to\n\f                                     33\n      keep records as required by the director . . . [which] shall, at\n      a minimum, include tracking of the composition of applicant\n      groups, their movement through steps in the hiring\n      processes, and the impact of personnel actions on various\n      group members when records are not otherwise available in\n      centralized information systems.\n\nIowa Admin. Code r. 11—68.2(3).\n\n      Yet, the plaintiffs assert that the record shows that the underlying\n\ndepartment records are inadequate for three reasons. First, many of the\n\nunderlying employment files simply have missing documents. Second,\n\nmany of the underlying files reveal that the agencies did not create\n\ndocuments in the first place showing why employees were chosen or not\n\nchosen after having been screened by DAS and being minimally qualified\n\nfor the position. Finally, the plaintiffs assert that the agencies did not\n\napply common standards when scoring systems were used to evaluate\n\napplicants.\n\n      In support of their claim that the departmental records were\n\ninadequate to allow separation for analysis by a specific employment\n\npractice, the plaintiffs cite two types of evidence in the record. First, the\n\nplaintiffs point to admissions in the record by state employees or agents.\n\nWhen consultant CPS conducted a review of state hiring practices for the\n\nState in 2007, it noted that files it reviewed “were not complete and did\n\nnot indicate why some applicants were interviewed and others were not.”\n\nCPS declared that its studies confirmed that the selection of persons for\n\ninterviews from DAS lists of minimally qualified applicants created “a\n\nrebuttable inference of adverse impact” but noted that inconsistencies in\n\nthe State’s records within the same department prevented a more\n\ndetailed analysis.   When DAS attempted to do an employment audit\n\npursuant to Executive Order No. 4, DAS officials indicated that they\n\nfound more lack of documentation than CPS.          See Exec. Order No. 4\n\f                                       34\n\n(2007),    available        at   http://www.statelibraryofiowa.org/services/\n\ncollections/law-library/govexecorders/copy_of_execordculver.       Further,\n\nwhile Executive Order No. 4, among other things, required agencies to\n\nassess the impact of screening methods on employee groups in the\n\nselection process, see id., a DAS official, when asked if DAS was\n\nincapable of complying with Executive Order No. 4, responded, “Right.\n\nWe needed to do more.” Ultimately, DAS abandoned its effort to conduct\n\nan audit in compliance with Executive Order No. 4.\n\n      Second, the plaintiffs analyzed the 667 hiring files produced by the\n\nState in discovery.     The plaintiffs assert that an analysis of the files\n\nreveals that fifty percent did not include résumé review screening\n\ndevices, over one in ten did not include interview questions, nearly one in\n\nfive did not include interview notes, and over twenty-five percent did not\n\ninclude an interview scoring matrix.\n\n      The plaintiffs recognize that the aggregate data can be divided into\n\nsmaller parts. The plaintiffs concede that it is possible to sort the data\n\nby Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) job category, by year, and by\n\nstep in the hiring process. But the plaintiffs maintain that such division\n\nof the data into smaller units does not anchor the statistical analysis in\n\nspecific employment practices, but simply lessens the size of the sample\n\nfor statistical analysis.\n\n      In other words, stacking documents by year does not help focus on\n\nan employment practice nor does stacking documents by EEO job\n\ncategory or step in the hiring process. The main effect of such slicing\n\nand dicing is to lessen the size of the sample, thereby reducing the power\n\nof aggregate statistical analysis without achieving any increase in focus.\n\n      In short, the plaintiffs claim they did the best they could with the\n\navailable data and that the aggregate analysis of disparate impact was\n\f                                    35\n\n“as specific as the choices the employer permitted.”        Based on the\n\naggregate data, they point out that the racial disparity in the hiring of\n\napplicants deemed qualified for the job by DAS was statistically\n\nsignificant and that the likelihood of the result occurring in a race-\n\nneutral environment was as much as two billion to one, depending on\n\nthe data set used. Further, the plaintiffs assert that the record showed\n\nthat African Americans would have a forty percent better chance of being\n\nhired or promoted if they were white.\n\n      The plaintiffs point to Port Authority Police Asian Jade Society v.\n\nPort Authority, in support of their argument.      </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2528046\"><a href=\"/opinion/2528046/asian-jade-society-v-port-authority/\"><span class=\"volume\">681</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">456</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(S.D.N.Y. 2010).   In that case, the district court held that because an\n\nemployer failed to maintain records, “the role of each step cannot be\n\ndetermined, [and] the steps cannot be examined separately to discover\n\nwhether a particular step causes a disparate impact.” Id. at 464. The\n\nplaintiffs further connect the disparate impact shown by their statistics\n\nwith the lack of accountability in the State’s personnel system.      They\n\npoint out that their experts testified that accountability is an important\n\naspect of integrated employment standards working to prevent biased or\n\ninvalid decision-making.\n\n      Finally, in addition to lack of record keeping, the plaintiffs note\n\nthat the subjective manner in which the State makes its personnel\n\ndecisions prevents separation for analysis of more specific personnel\n\npractices. See Watson, 487 U.S. at 989–90, 108 S. Ct. at 2786, 101 L.\n\nEd. 2d at 841–42.    The plaintiffs cite Watson for the proposition that\n\nwhere an employment system combines objective and subjective\n\nfeatures, it should be considered subjective in nature because of the\n\nripple effect of subjective practices. See id. According to the plaintiffs,\n\f                                    36\n\nunder Watson, subjective features can be analyzed as one practice under\n\ndisparate impact analysis.\n\n      In support of its assertion that decision-making processes that\n\ncombine objective and subjective decision-making should be considered\n\nas one employment practice under federal law, the plaintiffs cite Stender\n\nv. Lucky Stores, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2133110\"><a href=\"/opinion/2133110/stender-v-lucky-stores-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">803</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Tex. 1999).\n\n      In Stender, the district court considered a class action brought by\n\nAfrican American and female employees working in the approximately\n\n150 to 185 retail stores within Lucky’s Northern California Food Division.\n\n803 F. Supp. at 266, 267. The Stender court declared that the plaintiff\n\nneed not identify a particular employment practice “[w]here the system of\n\npromotion is pervaded by a lack of uniform criteria, criteria that are\n\nsubjective as well as variable, discretionary placements and promotions,\n\nthe failure to follow set procedures and the absence of written policies or\n\njustifications for promotional decisions.” Id. at 335.\n\n      In support of its opinion, the Stender court cited Allen v. Seidman,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"527039\"><a href=\"/opinion/527039/50-fair-emplpraccas-607-51-empl-prac-dec-p-39260-agee-allen-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">881</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">375</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th Cir. 1989).        Stender, 803 F. Supp. at 335.          In\n\nSeidman, the court considered a Title VII challenge brought by black\n\nbank examiners employed by the FDIC. 881 F.2d at 378. The plaintiffs\n\nchallenged a program evaluation test, which only thirty-nine percent of\n\nthe African American candidates passed compared to eighty-four percent\n\nof the white candidates. Id. No regression analysis was performed. Id.\n\nat 380. Judge Posner wrote that the statistics alone, without any further\n\nproof, established a prima facie case. Id. He noted that where “there has\n\nbeen a full trial, the issue of prima facie case drops out, and the question\n\nbecomes whether the judge is persuaded that the test or other challenged\n\f                                     37\n\npractice is discriminatory because it has a disparate impact unjustified\n\nby the defendant’s legitimate business needs.” Id. at 379.\n\n       In Lufkin, the district court considered the issue of class\n\ncertification in a case where African Americans sued an employer on a\n\ndisparate impact theory.       Lufkin, 187 F.R.D. at 272.         Candidly\n\ncharacterizing the law as “complex and convoluted,” the district court\n\ncanvassed the law on disparate impact claims. Id. at 271, 272–75. With\n\nrespect to the identification of employment practices, the district\n\nrecognized that under the Civil Rights Act of 1991, a plaintiff was\n\nrequired to demonstrate that “ ‘each particular challenged employment\n\npractice causes a disparate impact’ ” except where an employer’s\n\ndecision-making process is “ ‘not capable of separation for analysis.’ ” Id.\n\nat 272 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)(1)(B)(i)). The Lufkin court noted\n\nthat under Lufkin’s employment process, “[a] broad array of . . .\n\nemployment practices rest on . . . subjective decision making” both in\n\ncentral administration and within each division of the company. Id. at\n\n273.   As in this case, applicants are channeled through a centralized\n\nhuman resources department where candidates who meet the objective\n\nminimum criteria for jobs are forwarded to management employees for\n\napproval unguided by any objective standards. See id. The district court\n\nfurther noted that “[t]he pervasive subjective decision-making process\n\ninteracts with other facially neutral employment conditions to the\n\ndisadvantage of African-Americans” through a ripple effect. Id. at 274.\n\nConcluding “Lufkin’s subjective employment practices [were] inextricably\n\nintertwined,” the district court held that elements of the respondent’s\n\ndecision-making process were not capable of separation of analysis for\n\npurposes of class certification. Id. at 275.\n\f                                     38\n\n      2. The State.    The State begins its discussion by asserting that\n\nwhether the State’s decision-making process is capable for separation for\n\nanalysis is a question of fact. The State asserts that the plaintiffs’ claim\n\nthat the decision-making process was not capable of separation fails\n\nbecause the plaintiffs never attempted to make such an analysis and\n\nbecause they received voluminous amounts of data and hiring files.\n\n      The State claims that the evidence demonstrates that the plaintiffs\n\nnever tried to identify and analyze any particular employment practice or\n\ndecision-making process.      For example, the State suggests that the\n\nplaintiffs did not attempt to analyze hard documents in the departments\n\nbecause they were not in a convenient digital format. In any event, the\n\nState maintains that it provided substantial information in digital form in\n\nthe BrassRing system, and the Human Resource Information System\n\n(HRIS) data system, which were maintained by DAS. In short, the State\n\nclaims that the plaintiffs were not forced to engage in system-wide\n\nanalysis because the decision-making process was not capable of\n\nseparation for analysis, but instead simply chose to engage in a system-\n\nwide challenge.\n\n      The State emphasized that the plaintiffs had the affirmative burden\n\nof showing that the process was capable of separation for analysis. The\n\nState emphasizes the factual nature of the inquiry.       The State further\n\nclaims that at trial the plaintiffs did not offer testimony that the decision-\n\nmaking process was not capable of separation for analysis. The State\n\nasserts that the plaintiffs never tried to analyze separate practices or\n\nprocesses, but simply preferred to proceed on a system-wide basis. The\n\nState highlights the staggering amount of information that was presented\n\nto the plaintiffs in the BrassRing files and in the HRIS data system. The\n\f                                     39\n\nState notes that Killingworth engaged in analysis of the data by EEO\n\ncategory, by year, and by step in the hiring process.\n\n      B. Analysis of Specific Employment Practice and Incapable of\n\nSeparation for Analysis Under Title VII, as Amended by the Civil\n\nRights Act of 1991. Under the Civil Rights Act of 1991, a plaintiff in a\n\ndisparate impact case must identify a “particular employment practice”\n\nbeing challenged or, in the alternative, demonstrate why an employer’s\n\ndecision-making process is “not capable of separation for analysis.” 42\n\nU.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)(1)(B)(i).   The district court held that the plaintiffs\n\nfailed to show that the State’s hiring practice was not capable of\n\nseparation for analysis.\n\n      On appeal, the plaintiffs do not claim they identified a particular\n\nemployment practice.       Instead, the plaintiffs contend that the record\n\ndemonstrates that because of the poor record keeping of the State, and\n\nbecause of the use of subjective criteria in the various departments, it\n\nwas impossible to engage in a more focused analysis of the hiring\n\npractices of the State beyond what it presented in the case. Although the\n\nplaintiffs’ evidence shows notice to the State of potential disparate impact\n\narising out of its employment processes, the plaintiffs, like the plaintiffs\n\nin Wal-Mart, did not pursue a notice/negligence-type theory.\n\n      A few preliminary matters should be discussed.       First, the mere\n\nfact that the class involves a number of departments and different\n\npositions over a period of years by one employer does not necessarily\n\ndemonstrate that the State’s decision-making process is capable of\n\nseparation for analysis. To the extent relevant, the class in this case is\n\nmuch more compact than in Wal-Mart, where 1.5 million employees were\n\nlocated in 3400 stores in all fifty states. See id. at ___, 131 S. Ct. at\n\n2557, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">180</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 395.            Many lower federal courts have\n\f                                          40\n\ndistinguished Wal-Mart on the ground that the classes being challenged\n\nwere more compact.7\n\n         Nor does the fact that the State flooded the plaintiffs with\n\ncomputerized data and documents decide the case. There is no question\n\nthat the State databases provided to the plaintiffs contain thousands and\n\nthousands of bits of data.          Conclusory statements by witnesses and\n\nlawyers regarding the nature of the information presented yield little\n\nvalue.     And, the mere fact that a trial lasted seventeen days does not\n\nmean there must be substantial evidence supporting key findings of fact.\n\n         We must put the conclusory rhetoric aside and consider, first,\n\nwhat does it mean for an employer’s decision-making to be incapable of\n\nseparation for analysis? Then, once we understand the meaning of the\n\nstatutory phrase, we must examine the record to determine if the\n\nplaintiffs have met their burden in this case.\n\n         On the issue of what is meant by a decision-making process that is\n\nincapable of separation for analysis, the parties provide us with little\n\nguidance. No one disputes that the plaintiffs bear the burden of proof on\n\nthe issue. But what does it mean to be “incapable” of “separation” for\n\n“analysis”?\n\n         We begin with a review of the three key statutory words: incapable,\n\nseparation, and analysis.          None are statutorily defined.            The word\n\nincapable generally refers to something that cannot be done.                        See\n\n\n         7See,\n             e.g., Meyer v.

Separation\n\nhas several different but related meanings, including “a point, line, or\n\nmeans of division,” or “an intervening space.”    Id. at 1064 (“separate”\n\nused as a verb means to set or keep apart, to remove from a mixture or\n\nto isolate).   In the context of disparate impact, we believe the term\n\nanalysis must mean statistical analysis.\n\n      While an understanding of these three statutory terms is helpful,\n\nwe still need to probe the statutory context. What kind of separation is\n\nsufficient? Separated or isolated from what? In context, it seems clear\n\nthat what must be separated out for analysis from the employers\n\ndecision-making process is particular employment practices, as the\n\nseparation of particular employment practices is what the statute\n\nordinarily requires.    The plaintiffs must show they cannot spin out\n\nseparate employment practices from the larger whole that are capable of\n\nstatistical analysis.\n\n      Given these statutory terms and their common sense definitions, it\n\nseems that a decision-making process may be incapable of separation for\n\nanalysis under at least three circumstances.       First, the substantive\n\nfeatures of the decision-making process itself may be such that the\n\ndecision-making process is incapable of separation for analysis into\n\nspecific employment practices. That is the teaching of Stender. See 803\n\nF. Supp. at 335 (finding employee’s “subjective and ambiguous decision-\n\nmaking processes” incapable of separation for analysis). For instance, a\n\nwholly subjective process, even if decentralized, would be incapable of\n\nseparation because of a lack of objective criteria.       See Ronald D.\n\nRotunda, The Civil Rights Act of 1991: A Brief Introductory Analysis of the\n\nCongressional Response to Judicial Interpretation, 68 Notre Dame L. Rev.\n\f                                      42\n\n923, 934 (1993) (noting that “hiring processes are often complicated,\n\nwith ill-defined or ill-followed guidelines”).\n\n      Second, even well-defined employment practices may be so\n\nintertwined as not capable of meaningful analysis separately. The classic\n\nexample is Dothard v. Rawlinson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109725\"><a href=\"/opinion/109725/dothard-v-rawlinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">321</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109725\"><a href=\"/opinion/109725/dothard-v-rawlinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

If the various employment practices cannot be isolated and\n\nconsidered independently, they are not capable of separate analysis.\n\n      Third, the failure of the employer to keep adequate records can\n\nmake an employment decision incapable of separation for analysis. See\n\nPort Auth. Police Asian Jade Soc., 681 F. Supp. 2d at 464. It is true that\n\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1991 did not contain the more specific language of\n\nthe proposed Civil Rights Act of 1990 (which, as noted above, provided\n\nthat a lack of records could excuse the particularity requirement), but\n\nthe adoption of the more general language of the Civil Rights Act of 1991\n\nis certainly broad enough to encompass such an approach and plainly\n\ndoes not preclude it.     If, for example, the various departments of an\n\nemployer do not maintain records of interview criteria, including the\n\nmanner in which the interview is scored, and the scores awarded by the\n\nemployer based on the interview, it is difficult to see how a plaintiff could\n\nengage in separate analysis of disparate impact. A contrary result would\n\nbe an incentive for employers to refuse to keep adequate records of their\n\nemployment processes.         Thus, an employer who declines to keep\n\nemployment records from which particular employment practices are\n\f                                      43\n\ncapable of separation for analysis may face a lawsuit based on system-\n\nas-a-whole-disparate impact.\n\n      Although the point is not always clear, the plaintiffs on appeal in\n\nthis case do not make an argument based solely upon one of the above\n\nscenarios. Instead, the plaintiffs offered a hybrid argument, based upon\n\na combination of the above factors.           The plaintiffs argue that a\n\ncombination of (1) ill-defined subjective practices, (2) intertwined\n\nelements of decision-making, and (3) lack of adequate record keeping by\n\nthe employer prevented them from identifying specific employment\n\npractices for purposes of disparate impact analysis.\n\n      Based on the above discussion, some of the analysis of the district\n\ncourt on the separation issue appears off the mark. For example, the\n\ndistrict court declared that the analysis of employment practice or\n\nprocess is focused on the “job specific” level. But this is not necessarily\n\ntrue. A plaintiff is not required to focus on a job specific level if it can be\n\nshown that any potential job specific employment practices are not\n\ncapable of separation for analysis.         Indeed, such a contention is\n\nantithetical to system-as-a-whole attacks that are permitted under the\n\nstatutory exception in 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)(1)(B)(i).      Thus, the mere\n\nfact that the data could be broken down by EEO-4 categories, for\n\ninstance, does not mean the plaintiff cannot proceed on a system-as-a-\n\nwhole theory.\n\n      Similarly, there is language in the district court ruling suggesting\n\nthat the existence of separate departments within an employer prevented\n\nthe plaintiffs from proceeding on a decision-making-as-a-whole theory.\n\nThe mere fact that there are departments within an employer, however,\n\ndoes not in itself mean that a plaintiff cannot show that the decision-\n\nmaking process is not capable of separation for analysis. If the plaintiff\n\f                                       44\n\ncan demonstrate, for instance, that the departments do not operate\n\nunder separate and identifiable employment practices, or that the\n\nrecords are so deficient the alleged department practices cannot be\n\nseparately analyzed, then the plaintiff may be able to proceed on a\n\ndecision-making process as a whole theory.\n\n         In short, the fact that the plaintiffs were provided with lots of data\n\nthat can mechanically be sliced and diced in numerous ways proves\n\nnothing; massive data can always be divided into countless different\n\npiles.    But the key question is not whether the massive data can be\n\ndivided up into piles, the question is whether the plaintiffs demonstrated\n\nany resulting piles that might be formed do not reveal particular\n\nemployment practices that are capable of separation for statistical\n\nanalysis.\n\n         Consider the following hypothetical.    Suppose a class of African\n\nAmericans challenged a state merit system of thirty-seven departments\n\nwhich hired thousands of persons over a ten-year period over many EEO\n\ncategories of jobs.     Suppose further that the State admitted that the\n\nhiring decisions were made at the unfettered discretion of individual\n\nmanagers in each department. Assuming no other facts, the plaintiffs\n\nwould be entitled to bring their class action under Title VII because there\n\nwould be no identifiable particular employment practices that were\n\ncapable of separate [statistical] analysis.\n\n         Take the above hypothetical and add the fact that the State\n\nprovided the plaintiff with a number of databases with hundreds of\n\nthousands of data points.          Suppose further that these documents\n\nincluded numerous job résumés, many miscellaneous descriptions of the\n\njob positions, dates the interviews were conducted, and the names of\n\f                                     45\n\nmanagers who made the decisions. Would this barrage of data mean the\n\nplaintiff was barred from proceeding on a system-as-a-whole basis?\n\n      The answer might be no. Even if the data contains thousands or\n\neven millions of bits of information, the plaintiff may show the data does\n\nnot provide a basis for a plaintiff to identify particular employment\n\npractices in an employer’s decision-making process that are subject to\n\nseparate [statistical] analysis.    In short, the amount of information\n\nproduced is irrelevant. It is the quality of the information that is key.\n\n      Let us now change the hypothetical somewhat.          Assume further\n\nthat the data dump in fact contained more substantive information on\n\nthe decision-making process.       Suppose the data was a collection of\n\nimperfect individual employment files, many of which contained specific\n\njob related criteria, or matrices for scoring interviewees and the scoring\n\nresulting from such interviews, and other significant material on the\n\nhiring process. Now, under this modified hypothetical, could the plaintiff\n\nidentify specific employment practices that could be subject to separate\n\n[statistical] analysis?\n\n      Nonetheless, the above discussion does not mean the plaintiffs\n\nmust prevail. Under Wards Cove and Wal-Mart, the plaintiffs still must\n\nshow there were not specific employment practices within the universe of\n\nthe state merit employment system with sufficient aggregate numbers\n\nthat they could be separated out for meaningful statistical analysis. See\n\nWal-Mart, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"219509\"><a href=\"/opinion/219509/bullcoming-v-new-mexico/\"><span class=\"volume\">564</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\"></span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">at ___, 131 S.

The plaintiffs’ expert Mark Killingsworth\n\ntestified he could statistically analyze the disparate impact at what the\n\nparties called step two of the analysis, namely, at the stage where DAS\n\ncleared minimally qualified applicants and passed them onto the\n\nindividual departments for selection for an interview. But, we doubt step\n\ntwo is an employment practice “capable of separation for analysis.” All\n\nemployment processes have chronological or procedural steps, but these\n\nare not the equivalent of an employment practice with sufficient\n\ndefinition that is subject to statistical analysis. Further, Killingsworth\n\ntestified step two could not really be separated from step three, the final\n\ndecision-making step in the process. The district court did not make a\n\nspecific finding regarding whether step two could be separated or isolated\n\nfrom step three.\n\n      Nonetheless, as the district court pointed out, the plaintiffs have a\n\nfurther problem. While the parties utilized central databases maintained\n\nby DAS for what the district court accurately called “slicing and dicing” of\n\nthe statistical data, the databases may have been inadequate to engage\n\nin analysis of specific employment policies for disparate impact by\n\ndepartment or other nonsystem-wide approaches.              Even so, the\n\ndepartments themselves maintained hard file copies of employment\n\nrecords that may have included more information than was available on\n\nthe database.      The question arises whether the plaintiffs adequately\n\nproved this information could not have been utilized to separate out\n\nemployment practices by the various departments or agencies that would\n\nbe capable of separation for analysis.     While the plaintiffs claim the\n\nhiring data in the hard files was incomplete, the question remains\n\f                                       47\n\nwhether there was sufficient information in the hiring files to construct a\n\nmeaningful database to analyze specific employment practices.\n\n        The district court made findings related to the underlying\n\ndocuments. It declared that “the hiring files themselves permit a focused\n\nview of the different screening devices and practices in the referral,\n\ninterview, or hiring of applicants for any given job between the\n\ndepartments.” Further, the district court stated that “one can focus on\n\nany number of discrete employment decisions made as individual,\n\nseparate, discrete employment practices” and provided examples,\n\nincluding a “second résumé screen” and a “spelling and grammar\n\nscreen.”\n\n        Read in a fashion to support the district court’s verdict, these\n\nfindings demonstrate the district court found that employment practices\n\ncould    be   extracted   from   the   underlying   documentary    files   and\n\nstatistically analyzed in a meaningful way.          There is, however, no\n\nrequirement the defendants prove that employment practices are capable\n\nof separation for meaningful statistical analysis. The precise legal issue\n\nis whether the plaintiffs met their burden in showing that the particular\n\nemployment practices could not be separated and analyzed from the\n\ndocumentary files maintained by the State.          See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-\n\n2(k)(l)(B)(i). In short, at least under the theory of the case as litigated by\n\nthe parties, the plaintiffs have the burden of proving the negative.\n\n        We conclude the district court correctly resolved the issue\n\nadversely to the plaintiffs and that such a finding is supported by\n\nsubstantial evidence in the record.         Killingsworth did not review the\n\nunderlying documentary files and offered no testimony indicating specific\n\nemployment practices could not be extracted from the underlying files for\n\nstatistical analysis notwithstanding the flaws in some of the files. The\n\f                                     48\n\nState’s expert, Miller, suggested the underlying documents were capable\n\nof separation for analysis. Dr. Greenwald characterized the hiring files\n\nas “a gold mine that hasn’t been analyzed.”              While it is true the\n\nunderlying files were often incomplete and flawed, that does not\n\nnecessarily mean employment practices could not be identified and\n\nstatistically analyzed in a meaningful way.\n\n      The bottom line, on the record before us, is that while the plaintiffs\n\ndemonstrated the recordkeeping was sometimes incomplete, the district\n\ncourt on the record before it could conclude that the plaintiffs failed to\n\nshow the negative, namely, that employment practices could not be\n\nextracted from the underlying documents and analyzed in a statistically\n\nsignificant manner. On this issue, the district court got it right. As a\n\nresult, under applicable federal law, the State was entitled to summary\n\njudgment on the record developed in the district court on the plaintiffs’\n\nclaim under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\n      V. Discussion of Specific Employment Practice and Incapable\nof Separation Analysis Under the Iowa Civil Rights Act.\n      We now turn to the question of whether the defendant was entitled\n\nto summary judgment under the Iowa Civil Rights Act. See Iowa Code\n\n§ 216.6.   Although it is often said that state civil rights acts were\n\npatterned after the Federal Civil Rights Act, in fact more than twenty\n\nstate civil rights acts predated the Federal Act. See Arthur E. Bonfield,\n\nState Civil Rights Statutes: Some Proposals, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Iowa</span> <span class=\"page\">L</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Rev. 1067, 1107 &\n\nn.140 (1964) (listing states).   In an important article advocating the\n\npassage of the Iowa Civil Rights Act, Bonfield relied extensively on state\n\nmodels in proposing legislative action in Iowa.             See id. at 1082\n\n(discussing states’ antidiscriminatory laws). Thus, though the Iowa Civil\n\nRights Act was enacted in the year following the enactment of the Federal\n\f                                     49\n\nCivil Rights Act, the Iowa Civil Rights Act draws on substantial state as\n\nwell as federal legislative precedent.    See id. at 1095–1123 (reviewing\n\nstates’ antidiscrimination laws and proposing statutes for Iowa).\n\n      The substantive provisions of the Iowa Civil Rights Act and Title VII\n\nof the Civil Rights Act of 1964 are often similar though not identical.\n\nWith respect to discrimination in employment, the Iowa Civil Rights Act\n\nprovides that “[i]t shall be an unfair or discriminatory practice for any\n\n. . . [p]erson to refuse to hire” or “otherwise discriminate in employment\n\nagainst any applicant for employment or any employee because of . . .\n\nrace.” Iowa Code § 216.6(1)(a). The parallel provision under the Federal\n\nCivil Rights Act provides that “[i]t shall be an unlawful employment\n\npractice for an employer . . . to fail or refuse to hire . . . or otherwise\n\ndiscriminate against any individual because of . . . race.”       42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2000e-2(a)(1).\n\n      There are, however, differences between the state and federal acts.\n\nFor instance, the Iowa legislature has declared that the Iowa Civil Rights\n\nAct “shall be construed broadly to effectuate its purposes.” Iowa Code\n\n§ 216.18(1). There is no similar language in the Federal Civil Rights Act\n\nand, indeed, the case can be made that the recent cases of the United\n\nStates Supreme Court, particularly Wards Cove and Wal-Mart, tend to\n\nconstrue the federal counterpart narrowly.        Other state courts have\n\ninterpreted similar legislative directions to mean that the remedies\n\nafforded by the state civil rights statues require the “widest constitutional\n\napplication.” Fair Emp’t Practices Comm’n v.

The frequent narrow construction\n\nof civil rights laws by the United States Supreme Court, followed by\n\ncongressional intervention, has been cited as a ground for decreased\n\ndeference to United States Supreme Court decisions by state courts. See\n\nSperino, Revitalizing, 20 Geo. Mason L. Rev. at 564–68 (“To the extent\n\nthat the development of the federal [employment discrimination]\n\nframeworks depends on references to statutory languages and its\n\nhistorical   development     over    time,      reading     the     state    statutes   in\n\naccordance with these federal frameworks is highly suspect.”); Sandra F.\n\nSperino,     Diminishing     Deference:        Learning     Lessons         from   Recent\n\nCongressional    Rejection    of    the   Supreme         Court’s    Interpretation     of\n\nDiscrimination Statutes, 33 Rutgers L. Rec. 40, 42–43 (2009) (arguing\n\nthat “repeated Congressional rejection of [the Supreme Court’s narrow\n\ninterpretations of civil rights statutes] suggest[s] that state regimes\n\nshould not be so beholden to what may likely be faulty interpretation on\n\nthe part of the Supreme Court”).\n\f                                       53\n\n      The failure of the Iowa legislature to enact similar curative\n\nlegislation, however, is of no particular moment when there has been no\n\nsimilar narrow judicial construction of the Iowa Civil Rights Act by this\n\ncourt. Federal cases are not binding on questions of state law and thus\n\nthere is no need to override them through state legislative action.     As\n\nnoted by the Vermont Supreme Court, a state legislature is not required\n\nto “react to every federal decision interpreting Title VII or risk that its\n\ninaction will be interpreted as an endorsement of the federal decision.”\n\nLavalley, 692 A.2d at 370.\n\n      The above principles are consistent with our caselaw.            For\n\nexample, in Hubbard v. State, we noted that\n\n      [a]lthough decisions and interpretations of federal courts\n      may be illustrative and instructive to state courts in\n      construing statutes patterned after those enacted by\n      Congress and entitled to great weight in determining\n      construction to be given the same phrase in subsequently\n      enacted state statutes, they are neither conclusive nor\n      compulsory, especially when it appears earlier statutes\n      substantially similar have also been enacted in other states.\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2010928\"><a href=\"/opinion/2010928/hubbard-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">163</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">904</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 909 (Iowa 1969) (emphasis added). Here, the Iowa Civil\n\nRights Act was enacted only one year after the Federal Act and thus\n\nthere was little preexisting caselaw that would be entitled to “great\n\nweight” under Hubbard.       See id.    Further, at the time the Iowa Civil\n\nRights Act was passed, there were also state statutory counterparts,\n\nwhich may provide helpful precedents. See id. (“Where the language has\n\nbeen borrowed from the statutes of a sister state we would go for light to\n\nthe construing decisions . . . of that state.”).\n\n      Consistent with Hubbard, we look to federal caselaw, and the\n\ncaselaw of other states under their state civil rights statutes, for\n\npersuasive guidance. For example, in Pecenka, we noted that we may\n\nlook to federal interpretations in construing the Iowa Civil Rights Act but\n\f                                    54\n\nare not bound by them.      672 N.W.2d at 803.     And, in holding that a\n\nsupervisor may be personally liable for harassment under section\n\n216.6(1) of the Iowa Civil Rights Act, we favorably cited a New York case\n\nconstruing state law. See Vivian, 601 N.W.2d at 877–78.\n\n      The bottom line is that the Iowa Civil Rights Act is a source of law\n\nindependent of the Federal Civil Rights Act. In construing the Act, we\n\nmay look to federal and state court precedent, none of which are binding,\n\nbut which may persuade us in the interpretation of the Iowa statute. In\n\nmaking choices under the Iowa Civil Rights Act, we must be mindful of\n\nthe legislative direction that the Act be broadly interpreted to effectuate\n\nits purposes. See Iowa Code § 216.18(1).\n\n      The plaintiffs in their brief, however, do not explicitly invite us to\n\ninterpret the Iowa Civil Rights Act in a fashion different than Title VII of\n\nthe Federal Civil Rights Act.      The plaintiffs declare that “generally\n\nspeaking,” the same burden-shifting approach is applied under the Iowa\n\nCivil Rights Act as is applied under Title VII of the Federal Civil Rights\n\nAct. But the plaintiffs go even further. They seem to take the view that\n\nthe criteria established in the Civil Rights Act of 1991 also apply under\n\nthe Iowa Civil Rights Act even though there was no comparable statutory\n\namendment. Plaintiffs simply state that under “the law,” a plaintiff must\n\nidentify a specific employment practice or show that the decision-making\n\nprocess is not capable of separate analysis. Thus, the plaintiffs do not\n\nappear to make the substantive argument that Iowa law should embark\n\non a different path than reflected in Wards Cove and the subsequent\n\namendments to Title VII adopted by Congress or from Wal-Mart.\n\n      We thus must confront a question of preservation.          A narrow\n\nprivate law approach would suggest that we narrowly decide only the\n\nquestions advanced by the parties.          See Melvin Aron Eisenberg,\n\f                                     55\n\nParticipation, Responsiveness, and the Consultative Process: An Essay for\n\nLon Fuller, 92 Harv. L.

On the other hand, in dealing with\n\npublic law questions, the court has a responsibility for the development\n\nof law generally and cannot allow the advocacy of private parties to\n\ndictate legal development. See generally Abram Chayes, The Role of the\n\nJudge in Public Law Litigation, 89 Harv. L. Rev. 1281 (1976).

We could adopt\n\na similar approach on an issue of statutory construction of a parallel\n\nstatute.\n\n       In this case, the plaintiffs structured the litigation and advanced\n\narguments solely based upon federal law standards. Had the plaintiffs\n\nadvanced an argument under state law departing from the federal\n\nprecedent, for example, that a particular employment practice is not a\n\nrequirement under the Iowa Civil Rights Act8—a different factual record\n\nmight have been developed at trial.               Specifically, the State did not\n\nattempt to present a defense based upon business necessity, and the\n\nState’s response to the plaintiffs’ damage claim was quite limited.

The majority’s discussion\n\nof the law includes dicta unnecessary to its holding. For example, the\n\nmajority gratuitously undermines our court’s long-standing practice of\n\nrelying on federal decisions to interpret equivalent provisions of the Iowa\n\nCivil Rights Act. Yet, the majority’s analysis of the dispositive issue is\n\ncursory.     Given the importance of this case, I offer a more complete\n\nanalysis of the grounds to affirm the judgment and respond to the dicta\n\nto help guide cases to follow.\n\n         Plaintiffs are a certified class of over 5000 members defined as\n\n“[a]ll   African   American    applicants     and   employees     who   sought\n\nappointment to or held a merit-system position with an Executive\n\nBranch agency (not including Board of Regents) at any point from July 1,\n\n2003, through April 17, 2012.”       They brought disparate impact racial\n\ndiscrimination claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and\n\nthe Iowa Civil Rights Act of 1965 (ICRA).         These civil rights laws were\n\nenacted to eliminate discriminatory practices, provide remedies for\n\ndiscrimination,     and   allow    equal     opportunities   in   employment.\n\nDefendants are the State of Iowa and its thirty-seven executive branch\n\ndepartments. There are over 700 types of employment positions within\n\nthe executive branch.         During the relevant period, nearly 500,000\n\napplications were submitted by 100,000 applicants for 20,000 openings.\n\f                                        59\n\nApproximately 2000 supervisors within the executive branch have\n\nauthority in the hiring process. Plaintiffs sought to prove at trial that the\n\nState’s     overall   hiring   system   during   the   relevant    time   period\n\ndiscriminated on the basis of race.\n\n      Disparate impact law generally requires plaintiffs to prove a\n\nparticular employment practice caused a disparate impact. The majority\n\nfails to discuss the purpose of this proof requirement, which is to enable\n\nthe district court to fashion a remedy correcting the discriminatory\n\npractice without affecting other practices that are not discriminatory.\n\nCongress enacted a narrow exception to this general requirement.\n\nSpecifically, plaintiffs do not have to prove a particular employment\n\npractice had a discriminatory impact if they prove the State’s hiring\n\nprocess was incapable of “separation for analysis.”               See 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2000e-2(k)(1)(B)(i) (2006). In that event, the law relieves them of the\n\nburden of attributing the discrimination to a particular employment\n\npractice. Here, the plaintiffs sought to proceed under that exception.\n\n      Following a month-long bench trial, the district court found the\n\nState’s employment decision-making process was capable of separation\n\nfor analysis. For the reasons explained below, I conclude the “capable of\n\nseparation” finding is supported by substantial evidence and is\n\ndispositive.     I therefore agree the district court judgment must be\n\naffirmed.\n\n      I.

Rev. 2035 (2011) (discussing\nimplications of implicit bias for police–citizen interactions and Fourth Amendment\njurisprudence, and proposing “debiasing strategies” for police departments).\n       10Notably,Greenwald is an inventor of the Implicit Association Test, a widely\nused method of measuring implicit bias.             See Project Implicit, About Us,\nhttps://www.projectimplicit.net/about.html (last visited July 10, 2014).\n\f                                          61\n\nfrom    a   statistical   expert,    labor     economist     Mark     Killingsworth.11\n\n       Killingsworth chose to limit his analysis to applications referred by\n\nDAS to the departments (thus effectively excluding applicants who did\n\nnot satisfy minimum qualifications from his review).12                 Killingsworth’s\n\nsystem-wide review for the years 2004 through 2008 showed that\n\nAfrican-American applicants were statistically less likely than white\n\napplicants to be interviewed and hired in every year.                For example, in\n\n2005, nine percent of African-American applicants were interviewed, as\n\ncompared to twenty percent of white applicants. That same year, 1.8% of\n\nAfrican-American applicants were hired, as compared to 4.2% of white\n\napplicants. Overall, his analysis showed that a minimally qualified white\n\nperson had a forty percent greater chance of being hired than a\n\nminimally qualified African American.                  Splitting his analysis by\n\ndepartment, Killingsworth testified there was a statistically significant\n\ndisparity between the percentage of African-American applicants hired\n\nand the percentage of white applicants hired in many of the departments,\n\nthough not all. Killingsworth further testified that, once hired, white and\n\nAfrican-American employees were treated differently in performance\n\n\n       11Notably, the CPS study mentioned by the majority did not perform regression\nanalyses that excluded other possible variables that could account for the differences it\nreported. After pointing out the disparity between referrals and interviews, CPS\nacknowledged, “There could be . . . very legitimate reasons why the percentage of\nAfrican Americans is reduced so dramatically between referral and interview” and\nacknowledged that “the team was unable to determine a definitive reason(s) for these\noutcomes.”\n       12Both  Killingsworth and the State’s expert, Robert Miller, used applications—as\nopposed to applicants—as their unit of analysis. As the CPS study noted, it is difficult\nto identify the exact makeup of the applicant pool or the actual number of applicants\nbecause the State’s tracking system did not track individual people, but rather\napplications. Both the State’s and plaintiffs’ experts acknowledged African-American\napplicants applied on average for 1.6 more jobs than white applicants. In short, both\nparties agreed that African-American applicants, on average, followed a strategy of\ncasting a wider State job search net than white applicants.\n\f                                          62\n\nevaluations. Killingsworth did not connect his findings to any particular\n\nState practice.13\n\n       Robert Miller, another labor economist and the State’s statistical\n\nexpert, also performed regression analyses. With regard to wages and\n\npromotion, he found no statistically significant differences between races\n\nafter taking into account experience and the pay grade of the job for\n\nwhich the individual applied. He criticized Killingsworth’s regressions as\n\ninadequate because they failed to adjust for these other factors.\n\n       With regard to hiring, Miller subdivided his work into the three\n\nsteps that the State followed to get to its actual hire.                Thus, unlike\n\nKillingsworth, who considered only steps two and three and combined\n\nthem, Miller separately considered steps one, two, and three.                   At step\n\nthree, i.e., what occurs after the applicant is granted an in-person\n\ninterview, Miller found no statistically significant difference between\n\nwhites and blacks in their success in being hired.\n\n       At step one, Miller found no statistically significant difference\n\nbetween white and black applicants in getting a referral.                    On a per\n\napplication basis, though, African Americans were less successful than\n\nwhites in getting a referral. However, the data also showed that African-\n\nAmerican applicants, on average, filed more applications than whites\n\n(approximately 5.9 versus 4.3 per applicant over a multiyear period—a\n\nthirty-eight percent difference).\n\n       At step two—referral to interview—Miller’s findings were more\n\nnuanced.       On the whole, he found that African Americans were\n\n\n       13Killingsworth  acknowledged that he looked only at “[t]he total result,” not any\nparticular employment practice other than “hiring” as a whole. He did not offer any\nopinions that the disparities he observed were the result of subjective as opposed to\nobjective hiring practices.\n\f                                         63\n\nstatistically less likely to receive a department job interview after their\n\napplication was referred by DAS. Probing more deeply, he found this was\n\nonly true for about one-third of State departments. It was not true for\n\nthe remaining two-thirds of departments. As Miller explained,\n\n      The overall conclusion with respect to step two is that a\n      common factor could not or does not appear to be operating\n      across all the departments in the same way, because our\n      results show that there are clear departmental differences.\n\nFor the specific jobs that the thirteen named plaintiffs had applied for,\n\nMiller found that African Americans were not statistically less likely to\n\nget interviews than whites.\n\n      The plaintiffs reviewed paper hiring files produced by the State for\n\n667 separate positions that were filled. Based on the examples in the\n\nrecord, these files contained items such as applicant résumés, score\n\nsheets for résumé reviews, score sheets for interviews, and letters asking\n\nfor authority (and justifying the decision) to hire the successful applicant.\n\nFor instance, for the position of workforce advisor in the unemployment\n\ninsurance service center, Iowa Workforce Development used a résumé\n\nreview worksheet that awarded a maximum of fifty-nine points. There\n\nwere a maximum of twenty points potentially available for education, ten\npoints   potentially   available   for    unemployment   insurance    claims\n\nexperience, fourteen points potentially available for possessing various\n\ncomputer skills, five points available for being a veteran (or ten for being\n\na disabled veteran), and five points available for “ability to follow resume\n\nand cover letter submission directions.” These files were not provided to\n\nor reviewed by Killingsworth. As Killingsworth put it, “I don’t have any\n\naccess or haven’t had any hiring files.”\n\f                                    64\n\n      Miller testified that the data were “absolutely” capable of\n\nseparation for analysis, and in fact, he separated them to the extent\n\nnoted.\n\n      II. Analysis.\n\n      On appeal, plaintiffs do not argue that the State’s failure to follow\n\nits own equal-employment-opportunity policies constituted a discrete\n\nemployment practice.     Instead, plaintiffs challenge the district court’s\n\ndetermination that the State’s overall hiring process was capable of\n\nseparation for analysis. Plaintiffs argue the hiring process could not be\n\nanalyzed in terms of separate practices. Plaintiffs also assert on appeal\n\nthat the district court erred in determining they failed to prove causation.\n\nBecause the district court correctly decided the dispositive separation\n\nissue, we need not reach the causation issue. I will provide an overview\n\nof the governing law to place the separation issue into context.\n\n      A. Disparate Impact Law.

The fundamental difference between the two theories is\n\nthat “the disparate treatment theory focuses on the employer’s\n\nmotivation; the disparate impact theory focuses on the consequences of\n\nthe employer’s conduct.” Id. Disparate treatment requires a plaintiff to\n\nprove intentional discrimination. Id.\n\n        Disparate impact, the theory plaintiffs presented at trial, presents\n\nan avenue for addressing inequalities in the absence of intentional\n\ndiscrimination.

Second, if the plaintiff makes this prima facie\n\nshowing, the burden shifts to the employer to prove that the challenged\n\nemployment practice reflects a business necessity.           See 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2000e-2(k)(1)(A)(i).    Third, the plaintiff may rebut the employer’s\n\nbusiness-necessity       evidence   by    demonstrating   there   are   “other\n\nreasonable alternatives that would have less adverse impact,” Hy-Vee,\n\n453 N.W.2d at 518, and the defendant “refuses to adopt such alternative\n\nemployment practice,” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)(1)(A)(ii).

It is vital to determine the particular employment\n\npractice causing the disparate impact in order to fix the problem.\n\n      For example, the record shows that African Americans actually\n\ncomprise a higher percentage of the State executive branch workforce\n\nthan they do in the Iowa workforce as a whole. Yet, it would be wrong to\n\nconclude from that overall number that the State is not discriminating on\n\nthe basis of race. One has to focus on actual employment practices.\n\n      While   Congress   generally   required   that   a   plaintiff   identify\n\nparticular employment practices that cause disparate impact, Congress\n\nalso provided that the decision-making process could be challenged as a\n\nwhole under certain circumstances. Specifically, Congress provided:\n\n      With respect to demonstrating that a particular employment\n      practice causes a disparate impact . . . the complaining party\n      shall demonstrate that each particular challenged\n      employment practice causes a disparate impact, except that\n      if the complaining party can demonstrate to the court that\n      the elements of a respondent’s decisionmaking process are\n      not capable of separation for analysis, the decisionmaking\n      process may be analyzed as one employment practice.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)(1)(B)(i).   This law codifies an exception to the\n\nrequirement that a plaintiff identify a particular employment practice,\n\nthereby ensuring that employers cannot avoid liability for disparate\n\nimpact simply by making it difficult for a plaintiff to separately analyze\n\nthe decision-making elements. See Griffin v. Carlin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"448953\"><a href=\"/opinion/448953/ernest-l-griffin-cross-appellees-v-carl-carlin-postmaster-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">755</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1516</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1525\n\n(11th Cir. 1985).   This statutory exception balances the concern that\n\nemployers could evade liability against the need for particularity by\n\nrequiring the plaintiff to first demonstrate the employer’s process is\n\nincapable of separation. As the majority acknowledges, the burden was\n\f                                          69\n\non plaintiffs to prove the State’s decision-making process is incapable of\n\nseparation for analysis before proceeding to attack the process as a\n\nwhole. See Grant v. Metro. Gov’t of Nashville, 446 F.

I will therefore focus on federal\n\nlaw and on the question of whether the State’s employment practices\n\nwere “not capable of separation for purposes of analysis.” But, first, I\n\nmust respond to dicta in the majority opinion that misleads by omission\n\nand thereby unfairly disparages, sub silentio, our long-standing practice,\n\nfollowed in numerous decisions of this court, of relying on federal\n\ndecisions to interpret equivalent provisions in the ICRA.

The district court specifically found the\n\nState’s decision-making process was capable of separation for analysis. I\n\nagree with the majority that this is a question of fact. See, e.g., McClain\n\nv.

See State v. Short, ___ N.W.2d ___, ___ (2014) (Waterman, J.,\ndissenting).\n\f                                    73\n\nby the district court’s factual finding if it is supported by substantial\n\nevidence. Schlitzer, 641 N.W.2d at 529. Plaintiffs argue on appeal there\n\nwas no substantial evidence supporting this finding and that their\n\nevidence proved as a matter of law that the State’s decision-making\n\nprocess was incapable of separation for analysis. I disagree.\n\n      Plaintiffs assert that the State’s record-keeping practices precluded\n\nseparate analysis of the decision-making process because (1) subjective\n\nassessments pervaded the decision-making process; (2) subjective\n\nassessments have a “ripple effect,” whereby the discriminatory impact\n\naccumulates as applicants move through the hiring process; and (3) the\n\nState did not retain some records regarding applicant evaluations.\n\n      The district court rejected all three theories based on the factual\n\nrecord developed at trial. To put the district court’s dispositive factual\n\nfinding into its legal context, I construe the operative statutory language.\n\nThe phrase “each particular challenged employment practice” in 42\n\nU.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)(1)(B)(i) indicates that a particular employment\n\npractice is distinct from a decision-making process.            A particular\n\nemployment practice is considered an element within the larger decision-\n\nmaking process. Congress’s choice to use the singular form, combined\n\nwith the words “particular” and “each” demonstrates that the challenged\n\npractice must be individually identified. “This syntax would be strange if\n\na plaintiff could bundle a number of discrete steps of a multi-phase\n\nhiring process together, based on a common characteristic.”         Davis v.\n\nCintas Corp., 717 F.3d 476,496, 497 (6th Cir. 2013) (holding plaintiff “did\n\nnot identify a ‘particular employment practice’ within the meaning of Title\n\nVII by pointing to all of the subjective elements in the [employer’s hiring\n\nsystem]”).\n\f                                    74\n\n      I first consider plaintiffs’ contentions regarding subjective decision-\n\nmaking.     How subjective decision-making plays into hiring and\n\npromotion depends on the type of job and the process used to fill it.\n\nThus, subjective conduct may serve as the “particular employment\n\npractice” underlying a disparate impact claim if plaintiffs can prove that\n\nthe conduct operates uniformly throughout an employer’s decision-\n\nmaking process to cause a disparate impact. For example, in Davis, the\n\nSixth Circuit rejected plaintiff’s argument that the defendant’s decision-\n\nmaking process was incapable of separation when “not all of the system’s\n\nsubjective elements are the same.” Id. at 497. The court noted “[e]ach\n\ndifferent interview . . . has a specific interview guide, and different\n\nmanagers conduct interviews at different stages of the process.”          Id.\n\nLikewise, in Bennett v. Nucor Corp., the Eighth Circuit concluded “this is\n\nnot a case where the components of the employer’s selection process\n\nwere incapable of separation.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"614046\"><a href=\"/opinion/614046/bennett-v-nucor-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">656</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">802</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 817 (8th Cir. 2011). The\n\ncourt pointed to the fact that the employer’s “five departments used a\n\nvariety of measures to evaluate candidates for promotion, including\n\nobjective criteria like experience, training, disciplinary history, and test\n\nscores, and subjective criteria such as interview performance and the\n\nopinion of the candidate’s current supervisor.” Id. at 817–18; see also\n\nGrant, 446 F. App’x at 740 (“The problem, however, is that Plaintiffs\n\nmake no effort to isolate any of these [decision-making] practices or to\n\nexamine their individual effects on the promotions process.”).\n\n      Chin v. Port Authority is a good example of a subjective process that\n\nwas incapable of separation for purposes of analysis.        </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">685</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">135</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n154–55 (2d Cir. 2012).

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 393.        The district court observed\n\nWal-Mart “highlights both the need to identify a particular employment\n\npractice,   the   pertinence   of   discretionary   decisionmaking    in   the\n\nemployment process, and the interconnection with statistical proof.”\n\n      The district court here found that “[t]he State’s system has both\n\nobjective and subjective components” which are “not so confused . . . as\n\nto prevent Plaintiffs from honing in on one particular employment\n\npractice.” This finding is supported by the record. For example, the DAS\n\nscreen that occurred at step one, the résumé score sheets that were part\n\nof step two in some departments, the second résumé screens and\n\nspelling and grammar screens that were part of step two in some\n\f                                     76\n\ndepartments, and the interview score sheets that were part of step three\n\nin some departments were objective components that could have been\n\nseparately analyzed. This was not a purely subjective process.\n\n      Furthermore, while there undoubtedly was subjectivity and—as\n\nthe plaintiffs credibly demonstrated—implicit bias in multiple State\n\nhiring decisions during the relevant time period, this case is a far cry\n\nfrom Chin, in which the decision-making process ultimately came down\n\nto a single individual’s discretion. By contrast here, the State’s hiring\n\ndecisions were in the hands of numerous department managers.           The\n\nState of Iowa Executive Branch employs a far more diverse range of job\n\ncategories than any of the defendants in the cases in which subjective\n\ndecision-making has served as a basis for attacking the decision-making\n\nprocess as a whole.    Those working for the State include corrections\n\nofficers, parole officers, registered nurses, food service workers, power\n\nplant engineers, state troopers, and DOT road-maintenance crew\n\nmembers, to name a few.      As noted by the district court, “The State\n\nsystem can be dissected into numerous decision-making stages among\n\nnumerous independent agencies of the executive branch,” and there is\n\n“inconsistency in results among the numerous agencies.” Miller showed\n\nthat, at step two, African Americans had a lower statistical likelihood of\n\ngetting an interview in some departments but not in others.          These\n\noutcomes could be due to either objective or subjective considerations,\n\nbut either way they do not suggest the existence of a common practice\n\n(even a subjective one) that would justify class-wide relief.

To the contrary, the State’s expert, Miller,\n\n“emphatically” testified that the State’s hiring system was capable of\n\nseparation for analysis.        Plaintiffs on appeal do not challenge the\n\nadmissibility of Miller’s testimony.         His testimony alone constitutes\n\nsubstantial     evidence     supporting      the   district    court’s      finding.\n\nFurthermore, Miller actually did separate the process into the three steps\n\nfor purposes of his analysis.\n\n      Additionally, plaintiffs’ own experts testified that the State’s\n\ndecision-making process could be separated for analysis.             The district\n\ncourt noted that Greenwald conceded the State’s employment process\n\ncould be separated to individually analyze each step of the process and\n\ncommented “that one ‘could determine whether or not there was bias at\n\neach one of the independent stages of the hiring process.’ ”                 Kaiser\n\ndiscussed how written résumés and in-person interviews can trigger\n\nimplicit   racial   biases   differently.    The   State’s    statistical   expert,\n\nKillingsworth, utilized a regression analysis to evaluate the State’s hiring\n\nprocess using data from different stages of the process and different\n\ndepartments. The district court summarized:\n\n             Dr. Killingsworth was capable of separating data for\n      the referral stage, the interview stage, and the hiring stage\n      for African Americans as compared to whites over a period of\n      years.    His work permits a fact finder to analyze the\n      departments of the executive branch in each of those years\n      at each of those stages. This charting of State data allows a\n      fact finder to compare the various departments and draw\n      important conclusions as to how the individual departments\n      compare to each other at the various stages. While he\n      elected not to begin his analysis at the application stage, the\n      data available would permit this. And it could be used to\n      track applicant flow from that first stage to the hiring of one\n      applicant for the specific job opening in any given\n      department—including the progress of each applicant\n      through the various stages and examining the particular\n      screening-devices used.\n\f                                    78\n\nFurther, Killingsworth “could limit his models by new applicants or\n\nincumbent State employees, initial pay, and performance evaluations.”\n\nHowever, he did not correlate any of his findings to a particular screening\n\ndevice.\n\n      Significantly, Miller performed separate statistical analyses by\n\ndepartment on the three steps in the hiring process. In fact, as I discuss\n\nbelow, the NAACP relies on that analysis in pursuing an alternative\n\nargument for reversal.    Furthermore, Killingsworth, as quoted above,\n\nagreed with Miller that the three steps could be separated for purposes of\n\nanalysis.   Additionally, in four pages of findings on separability, the\n\ndistrict court repeatedly referred to expert testimony that indicated the\n\nstages of the process could be separated.\n\n      This does not foreclose the possibility of further separation, as the\n\ndistrict court found. For example, the record revealed other employment\n\npractices with potentially discriminatory effects such as résumé screens\n\ncould have been isolated and separately analyzed. But, in any event, the\n\nrecord supports the district court’s finding that the plaintiffs did not\n\nmeet their burden. Plaintiffs did not even attempt to challenge an actual\n\nemployment practice and simply argued that the “total result” (to use\n\nKillingsworth’s phrase) was discriminatory.\n\n      In response to plaintiffs’ “ripple effect” argument, the district court\n\nfound “the fact that one errant practice compounds a problem at a later\n\nstage of the process does not prevent investigation of either the earlier or\n\nlater separate stage or practice.”       I agree.   Though the use of a\n\ndiscriminatory criterion at one stage may impact applicants throughout a\n\ndecision-making process, such a “ripple effect” does not preclude\n\nseparate analysis. In some cases, subjective and objective criteria may\n\nbe so intertwined as to prevent separation. See McClain v. Lufkin Indus.,\n\f                                       79\n\nInc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">187</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">267</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 275 (E.D. Tex. 1999) (finding an employer’s actions\n\ninseparable for analysis when “[t]he disparate impacts begin on the day\n\none is hired and are potentially magnified each time one’s career . . .\n\nintersects a subjective decision-making process”).           But, plaintiffs here\n\nhave not proven this is such a case.           The very point of regression\n\nanalysis is to allow isolation of particular elements and determine\n\nwhether there is a “ripple effect.”\n\n         Finally, substantial evidence supports the district court’s finding\n\nthat the plaintiffs failed to show the condition of the paper files precluded\n\nseparate analysis of specific employment practices within the State’s\n\nhiring    process.     Killingsworth   never   looked   at    the   hiring   files.\n\nSignificantly, as the majority notes, the district court found “the hiring\n\nfiles themselves permit a focused view of the different screening-devices\n\nand practices in referral, interview or hiring of applicants for any given\n\njob between the departments.”          Plaintiffs make much of the missing\n\ndocuments from the files, but eighty-six percent of the files included\n\ninterview questions, eighty-one percent had interview notes, and seventy-\n\nthree percent provided an interview scoring matrix. Half of the files had\n\nreference checks.      Eighty-four percent of the files also contained an\n\nindividual’s application, résumé, and cover letter.            As the majority\n\nrecognizes, Greenwald commented, “The hiring files of the State are a\n\ngold mine that hasn’t been analyzed.”          There is no evidence that the\n\nplaintiffs took even one of the objective standards the State employed\n\nand tried to determine whether it had a disparate impact using the\n\navailable records.\n\n         Plaintiffs argue that the sample sizes would get smaller and\n\nstatistical reliability would decline as one tries to analyze the effect of a\n\npractice that was only employed in certain areas at certain times. This\n\f                                    80\n\nmay be correct, but does not excuse the failure to try. The statute does\n\nnot permit courts to aggregate a collection of different hiring practices\n\nacross different times and departments just to increase the size of the\n\nsample.\n\n      The only case plaintiffs cite in support of their argument that a\n\nlack of records can prevent separate analysis is the district court opinion\n\nin Chin.   Notably, the Second Circuit on appeal relied on a different\n\nrationale from the district court—i.e., that the process was basically\n\nentirely subjective and the final decision rested with one person. Chin,\n\n685 F.3d at 154–55. Stepping back and looking at Chin with the benefit\n\nof both opinions, the lack of records and the subjectivity of the process\n\nappear to be two sides of the same coin: No one documented why\n\nsomeone received a promotion because there was nothing to document.\n\nPort Auth.

Here, by contrast, it is undeniable\n\nthat the records were incomplete, but equally irrefutable that no one who\n\ntried to analyze the records was unable to do so. As the district court\n\nfound,\n\n      [t]he State’s data—its recordkeeping—while not perfect, was\n      sufficient for both Dr. Killingsworth and Dr. Miller to\n      conduct their analyses. The presence in the record of their\n      models and opinions dispels the argument that the State’s\n      recordkeeping is such that it precludes anything but a\n      “systemic employment practice.”\n\nI conclude substantial evidence supports the district court’s findings\n\nregarding the State’s record keeping.\n\f                                    81\n\n      I reiterate the importance of separately analyzing the different\n\nprocesses used by the various departments.         In some departments,\n\nAfrican-American applicants fared better than white applicants at certain\n\nstages; in others they fared worse, even much worse. This suggests that\n\nthe different screening processes used by the departments may have had\n\ndifferent impacts on applicant success. As the district court noted, these\n\n“[v]arying outcomes between the departments and stages of the process\n\ninvite[] localized scrutiny.”\n\n      For example, based on the record in this case, I have concerns\n\nabout the various résumé screening devices used by State departments\n\nat the step-two level. It is certainly possible that inappropriate screening\n\ndevices may have been used in some of the departments in which Miller\n\nfound a statistically significant disparity between blacks and whites at\n\nstep two. But, it is just a possibility and not an aspect of the case that\n\nthe plaintiffs chose to pursue.\n\n      Here, the district court observed that “the hiring files themselves\n\npermit a focused view of the different screening-devices and practices in\n\nreferral, interview or hiring of applicants for any given job between the\n\ndepartments.” For example, as the court pointed out, DAS has a system-\n\nwide applicant screening manual, and an analysis could have been\n\nperformed based on the manner in which DAS instructs managers on the\n\nuse of the manual.\n\n      The district court went on to comment that “one can focus on any\n\nnumber of discrete employment decisions made as individual, separable,\n\nidentifiable particular employment practices” and then gave two more\n\nexamples:\n\n            One example of the separability of the process is the\n      ‘second résumé screen’ that had been utilized by some\n      departments. It was a particular employment practice that\n\f                                       82\n      was evaluated, determined to be inappropriate, and curtailed\n      at the suggestion of DAS. Similar refinement of the hiring\n      process by focusing on the inappropriate use of ‘spelling and\n      grammar screening’ is another example of DAS having\n      addressed a particular employment practice. The record\n      reflects not only the ability to focus on these particular\n      employment practices but when and which separate\n      agencies responded to the suggested changes by DAS.\n\n      The foregoing has shown why I am confident the court reached the\n\nright conclusion.    The district court methodically went through the\n\nrecord, focused appropriately on the testimony of statistical experts for\n\neach side, and identified various employment practices that could have\n\nbeen separately analyzed, including the three steps in the employment\n\npractice (separately analyzed by Miller) and more specific practices within\n\nthose steps.\n\n      For all these reasons, I conclude substantial evidence supports the\n\ndistrict court’s finding that the plaintiffs failed to show the State’s\n\nemployment practices are not capable of separation for purposes of\n\nanalysis. I close with three observations.\n\n      First, it is significant that the NAACP, in a well-argued amicus\n\nbrief, relies on some of the same data that plaintiffs dismiss as\n\ninadequate. Thus, the NAACP asserts that Miller’s findings show there\n\nwas an adverse impact at step two in eight departments that employed\n\napproximately fifty-eight percent of the State workforce. On that basis, it\n\nasks us to reverse the district court.\n\n      In my view, the NAACP’s brief raises serious questions as to\n\nwhether the State committed unlawful discrimination. The problem with\n\nthis argument is that it is not the case the plaintiffs elected to pursue.\n\nFor instance, we do not know what practices were followed in those eight\n\ndepartments    during    step   two.        This   seems   like   a   relatively\n\nstraightforward inquiry that could have been pursued in discovery. We\n\f                                    83\n\nalso do not know which representative plaintiffs—if any—applied for jobs\n\nwith those departments.     And, the remedies sought by the plaintiffs\n\nwould apply not only to those departments but to the State as a whole.\n\n      Instead of narrowing their focus, plaintiffs brought a class action\n\nalleging a common pattern of discrimination by the entire state executive\n\nbranch of government. Having brought such a large case, it was then up\n\nto the plaintiffs to undertake the considerable work required to prove it.\n\nUnder the prevailing law, this included analysis of specific hiring\n\npractices and their impact. Plaintiffs did not meet their burden.\n      Second, I do not downplay what this case has shown.             Even\naccording to Miller, it appears African Americans on the whole were\ndisadvantaged in getting job interviews from some agencies, including\nsome large departments like the department of human services and the\ndepartment of transportation. This conclusion, from a defense expert, is\ndisturbing although inconclusive.        The district court, in my view\ncorrectly, questioned why “given all this data held by the State, it did not\non a regular basis review it, as did these experts, with an eye toward\nmeasuring impact.”\n      Third, it bears emphasis that the defeat of this class action does\nnot bar a person who believes he or she was a victim of discrimination\nfrom bringing an individual lawsuit on his or her own against the State\nfor new acts of discrimination. What is clear here is that plaintiffs failed\nto prove, because they ultimately did not try to prove, that the State of\nIowa engaged in specific employment practices that had discriminatory\neffects against African-American job applicants and that would allow for\nclass-wide relief.\n      For the foregoing reasons, I agree the district court’s judgment\nmust be affirmed.\n      Mansfield and Zager, JJ., join this special concurrence.\n\f</pre>",
