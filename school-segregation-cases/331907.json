Hooks, Respondents-Appellees.\n\n                                 May 14, 1997.\n\nAppeal from the United States District Court for the Western\nDistrict of Louisiana.\n\nBefore KING and HIGGINBOTHAM, Circuit Judges, and KAZEN,1 District\nJudge.\n\n     KAZEN, District Judge:\n\n                                   Background\n\n     Claudious W. Channer (\"Channer\"), a pro se appellant, was\n\nscheduled to complete a federal prison sentence at the Federal\n\nCorrectional Institution at Oakdale, Louisiana (\"Oakdale\"), on\n\nMarch 2, 1994.     At his request, the Bureau of Prisons recalculated\n\nhis release date to January 29, 1994, to reflect jail-time credits.\n\nChanner was released into INS custody on January 31, 1994 pursuant\n\nto an Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\") detainer.                 He\n\nwas classified as an aggravated felon and held at Oakdale in \"no\n\nbond\" status.      Channer conceded his deportability and sought to be\n\ndeported   prior    to   March    2,   1994,   the   date   on   which   he   had\n\noriginally been scheduled to complete his federal sentence.                    He\n\n\n    1\n     District Judge of the Southern District of Texas, sitting by\ndesignation.\n\n                                        1\n\fwaived    his    right   of    appeal    and    received     a   final    order    of\n\ndeportation on March 2, 1994.           On March 23, 1994, however, before\n\nChanner   could     be   deported,      Connecticut       officials     executed   a\n\ndetainer against him and took him into their custody to serve a\n\ntwenty-year state sentence for armed robbery.                    During Channer's\n\ndetention at Oakdale, both as a federal prisoner and as an INS\n\ndetainee, he worked in the Food Services Department from 4:30 a.m.\n\nto 12:30 p.m.      each day.\n\n     Channer      brought      an   action     in   the   Western      District    of\n\nLouisiana, Lake Charles Division, against Keith Hall, the warden at\n\nOakdale during Channer's detention, and other federal officials and\n\nemployees (\"Appellees\").            In an amended complaint filed in March\n\n1994 and in later filings, Channer alleged that Appellees failed\n\nexpeditiously to deport him as allegedly required by the former 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1252.      He also alleged that the Appellees reduced him to\n\ninvoluntary servitude in violation of the Thirteenth Amendment to\n\nthe U.S. Constitution by compelling him to work in the Food\n\nServices Department while he was an INS detainee.                         He sought\n\ninjunctive and monetary relief.\n\n     Appellees filed a motion to dismiss or, in the alternative,\n\nfor summary judgment in which they raised the defense of qualified\n\nimmunity.       After    the   magistrate      judge   issued    his     report   and\n\nrecommendations, Channer filed a motion to compel discovery on the\n\nThirteenth Amendment issue.            Appellees filed no summary judgment\n\nevidence.       In separate orders, the district court granted their\n\nmotion for summary judgment on all causes of action.                  The court did\n\n\n                                         2\n\fnot rule on the motion to compel discovery.\n\n     Channer raises four issues on appeal, only two of which merit\n\nany discussion.       First, he appeals the district court's order\n\ndismissing his claim for damages arising out of the INS's failure\n\nexpeditiously to deport him pursuant to a since-repealed version of\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1252.2      Second, he appeals the order granting summary\n\njudgment in favor of Appellees on his Thirteenth Amendment claim\n\nfor damages. Appellees again raise the qualified immunity defense,\n\nwhich the magistrate judge and district court did not reach.       We\n\naffirm.\n\n                        INS's Failure to Deport\n\n     While this appeal was pending, the Illegal Immigration Reform\n\nand Immigrant Responsibility Act (\"IIRIRA\"), §§ 305-306, Pub.L. No.\n\n104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 (Sept. 30, 1996), was enacted.           This\n\nstatute repealed 8 U.S.C. § 1252.      The new provision which governs\n\nthe detention and removal of aliens ordered removed, 8 U.S.C.A. §\n\n1231(h) (Supp.1997), provides that \"[n]othing in this section shall\n\nbe construed to create any substantive or procedural right or\n\nbenefit that is legally enforceable by any party against the United\n\nStates or its agencies or officers or any other person.\"          The\n\neffective date of this provision was April 1, 1997.         IIRIRA, §\n\n309(a).       Because, as discussed below, Channer fails to state a\n\n\n          2\n          As the magistrate judge observed in his report and\nrecommendations, it appears that Channer's desire to have his\ndeportation expedited was fueled, at least in part, by his desire\nto avoid serving his twenty-year Connecticut sentence. Connecticut\nofficials apparently were unaware that his sentence had been\nrecalculated to reflect jail-time credits.\n\n                                   3\n\fclaim under the repealed version of § 1252, we need not reach the\n\nissue of     whether    the    1996    amendments    to   the     Immigration    and\n\nNationality Act (\"INA\") apply retroactively to his case.\n\n     Channer brings claims under the former 8 U.S.C. § 1252(c) and\n\n§ 1252(i).     The INA formerly provided that an alien who was not\n\ndeported   within      six    months    of    receiving     a    final   order    of\n\ndeportation was to be released subject to supervision.                   8 U.S.C. §\n\n1252(c) (1994) (repealed 1996).              The former 8 U.S.C. § 1252(i)\n\nprovided that \"[i]n the case of an alien who is convicted of an\n\noffense which makes the alien subject to deportation, the Attorney\n\nGeneral shall begin any deportation proceeding as expeditiously as\n\npossible after the date of the conviction.\"                 8 U.S.C. § 1252(i)\n\n(1994) (repealed 1996).\n\n     The INA also provided, however, that \"[a]n alien sentenced to\n\nimprisonment shall not be deported until such imprisonment has been\n\nterminated by the release of the alien from confinement.\" 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1252(h) (1994) (repealed 1996).            When Channer was released to INS\n\ncustody after completing his federal prison sentence, he had not\n\nyet begun to serve his Connecticut prison sentence for armed\n\nrobbery.      While    no     court   appears   to   have       addressed   factual\n\ncircumstances similar to Channer's case, we conclude that, had the\n\nINS \"expeditiously\" deported him before he began serving his\n\nConnecticut sentence, it would have violated § 1252(h).\n\n      Moreover, Channer has no implied private cause of action for\n\ndamages for the INS's failure to expedite his deportation.                      In a\n\nsimilar case, we held that an alien lacks standing under the\n\n\n                                         4\n\fMandamus and Venue Act (\"Mandamus Act\"), 28 U.S.C. § 1361, or the\n\nAdministrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"), 5 U.S.C. §§ 500-706, to\n\ncompel the INS to commence deportation proceedings pursuant to\n\nsection 1252(i).     Giddings v. Chandler, 979 F.2d 1104, 1110 (5th\n\nCir.1992).    As stated in Giddings,\n\n     while § 1252(i) imposes a duty on the Attorney General to\n     begin proceedings once an alien is deemed deportable because\n     of a conviction, that statute also grants the Attorney General\n     discretion to proceed \"as expeditiously as possible.\" ... We\n     read § 1252(i) as imposing a duty on the Attorney General to\n     deport criminal aliens, but we stop short of concluding that\n     this creates a duty owed to the alien.\n\nGiddings,    979   F.2d   at   1109-10       (quoting   8   U.S.C.   §   1252(i)).\n\nNeither the language nor the legislative history of this section\n\nsuggests that Congress intended to create a private right of action\n\nfor aliens, and no circuit has recognized a private right of action\n\nunder section 1252(i). See, e.g., Urbina-Mauricio v. INS, 989 F.2d\n\n1085, 1088 (9th Cir.1993).        We decline to recognize such a right.\n\nDismissal of Channer's INA claim was proper.\n\n                           Thirteenth Amendment\n\n                           A. Standard of Review\n\n     We review the granting of summary judgment de novo, examining\n\nthe evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmovant.                    The\n\nmoving party will prevail if he has demonstrated that there is no\n\ngenuine issue of material fact and that he is entitled to judgment\n\nas a matter of law.            Hale v. Townley, 45 F.3d 914, 917 (5th\n\nCir.1995).    Furthermore, we must decide whether Channer has stated\n\na claim for a violation of a constitutional right before reaching\n\nthe issue of qualified immunity.             Doe v. Rains County Indep. Sch.\n\n\n                                         5\n\fDist., 66 F.3d 1402, 1404 (5th Cir.1995).3\n\n                             B. Analysis\n\n        The Thirteenth Amendment states:\n\n     Section 1. Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except\n     as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been\n     duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any\n     place subject to their jurisdiction.\n\n     Section 2. Congress shall have power to enforce this article\n     by appropriate legislation.\n\nChanner alleges that, by forcing him to work from 4:30 a.m.     to\n\n12:30 p.m.      every day in Oakdale's Food Services Department,\n\nAppellees subjected him to involuntary servitude4 in contravention\n\nof the Thirteenth Amendment's first section.5     We will assume,\n\n        3\n       Channer also appeals the dismissal of his claim under the\n13th Amendment for damages against the INS. No Bivens remedy is\navailable against a federal agency, FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U.S. 471,\n482-86, 114 S.Ct. 996, 1004-06, 127 L.Ed.2d 308 (1994), and there\nis no indication that Channer pursued a Federal Tort Claims Act\nclaim.\n            4\n         The Amendment's exception, which permits involuntary\nservitude as punishment for a crime for which the party has been\nduly convicted, would be inapplicable after Channer completed his\ncriminal sentence and became an INS detainee.      While it is not\nclear from the record that all of Channer's evidence on involuntary\nservitude relates to his period of INS detention, Appellees do not\naddress this issue. For summary judgment purposes, therefore, we\ntreat this evidence as relating to the period in which he was\ndetained by the INS.\n    5\n      Section two \"clothe[s] \"Congress with power to pass all laws\nnecessary and proper for abolishing all badges and incidents of\nslavery in the United States.' \" Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., 392\nU.S. 409, 439, 88 S.Ct. 2186, 2203, 20 L.Ed.2d 1189 (1968) (quoting\nThe Civil Rights Cases, 109 U.S. 3, 20, 3 S.Ct. 18, 27-28, 27 L.Ed.\n835 (1883)) (emphasis omitted). Appellees contend that there is no\ndirect private right of action under the Amendment because Congress\nacting under § 2 is the creator and definer of 13th Amendment\nrights.   While it is true that suits attacking the \"badges and\nincidents of slavery\" must be based on a statute enacted under § 2,\nsuits attacking compulsory labor arise directly under prohibition\nof § 1, which is \"undoubtedly self-executing without any ancillary\n\n                                  6\n\farguendo, that the Thirteenth Amendment directly gives rise to a\n\ncause of action for damages under the analysis articulated in\n\nBivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of the Federal Bureau of\n\nNarcotics, 403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971) and\n\nits progeny.   We proceed to the question whether the actions about\n\nwhich Channer complains constitute involuntary servitude.\n\n     Our inquiry begins with United States v. Kozminski, 487 U.S.\n\n931, 108 S.Ct. 2751, 101 L.Ed.2d 788 (1988).     In that case, the\n\nSupreme Court held that\n\n     the term \"involuntary servitude\" necessarily means a condition\n     of servitude in which the victim is forced to work for the\n     defendant by the use or threat of physical restraint or\n     physical injury, or by the use or threat of coercion through\n     law or the legal process.\n\nId. at 952, 108 S.Ct. at 2765 (emphasis added). Kozminski involved\n\na criminal prosecution, but we effectively extended its definition\n\nof involuntary servitude to civil suits.   See Watson v. Graves, 909\n\nF.2d 1549 (5th Cir.1990).6 In Watson, inmates who had participated\n\n\nlegislation\" and \"[b]y its own unaided force and effect ...\nabolished slavery, and established universal freedom.\" The Civil\nRights Cases, 109 U.S. at 20, 3 S.Ct. at 28. The cases upon which\nAppellees rely are § 2 \"badges and incidents\" cases and are thus\ninapplicable to Channer's claim.         See, e.g., Griffin v.\nBreckenridge, 403 U.S. 88, 91 S.Ct. 1790, 29 L.Ed.2d 338 (1971)\n(suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3) arising out of racially motivated\nassault and battery); Holland v. Board of Trustees of Univ. Dist.\nColum., 794 F.Supp. 420, 424 (D.D.C.1992) (holding that\ndiscrimination-based \"badges and incidents\" suit must be brought\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1981, not directly under 13th Amendment).\n      6\n       We did not cite Kozminski in Watson.     Instead, Watson's\ndefinition of involuntary servitude relied on two pre-Kozminski\ncases which held that psychological and private-sector economic\ncoercion did not constitute involuntary servitude. See Flood v.\nKuhn, 316 F.Supp. 271, 281 (S.D.N.Y.1970), aff'd, 443 F.2d 264 (2d\nCir.1971), aff'd on other grounds, 407 U.S. 258, 92 S.Ct. 2099, 32\nL.Ed.2d 728 (1972); United States v. Shackney, 333 F.2d 475, 486\n\n                                 7\n\fin a work-release program sued local law enforcement officials for\n\nsubjecting them to involuntary servitude.       We recognized that the\n\ninmates, despite their status as convicted criminals, retained\n\ntheir civil right not be subjected to involuntary servitude because\n\nthey had not been sentenced to hard labor.      See id. at 1551, 1552.\n\n\"Involuntary servitude\" was defined as\n\n      an action by the master causing the servant to have, or         to\n      believe he has, no way to avoid continued service               or\n      confinement. When the employee has a choice, even though        it\n      is a painful one, there is no involuntary servitude.             A\n      showing of compulsion is thus a prerequisite to proof           of\n      involuntary servitude.\n\nId.   at   1552.   (citations   omitted)   (internal   quotation    marks\n\nomitted).\n\n      Applying this rule, we held that the inmates failed to prove\n\ncompulsion.    Rather, they had volunteered to work outside the jail\n\nunder a local policy that gave them \"trusty\" status, and the\n\n      choice of whether to work outside of the jail for twenty\n      dollars a day or remain inside the jail and earn nothing may\n      have indeed been \"painful\" and quite possibly illegal under\n      state law, but the evidence shows that neither [inmate] was\n      forced to work or continued to work against his will.\n\nId. at 1552-53;     see also Brooks v. George County, Miss., 84 F.3d\n\n157, 163 (5th Cir.1996) (holding that pretrial detainee's choice\n\nbetween periodically working outside jail in trusty status and\n\nremaining     in   jail   all   day,    while   \"painful,\"    was    not\n\nunconstitutionally coercive);      Franklin v. Kyle, 66 F.3d 323 (5th\n\nCir.1995) (unpublished opinion) (holding that forcing prisoner to\n\nchoose between working in prison industries program or risking loss\n\n\n\n(2d Cir.1964).     These cases are consistent with Kozminski.\n\n                                    8\n\fof   good-time    credits    was   painful,         but   not     unconstitutionally\n\ncoercive).\n\n      Channer argues that he was intimidated and threatened with\n\nsolitary confinement if he failed to work.                   Because, however, he\n\npresented    no   evidence   that    he       or   any    other    inmate    had    been\n\nsubjected    to   solitary    confinement          for    refusing    to    work,   the\n\ndistrict court found that he had not proved compulsion.                       It also\n\nfound that his labor was not forced because he had been paid for\n\nthe work he performed while an INS detainee.\n\n      Channer, however, presented evidence of a policy at Oakdale to\n\nplace any inmate who refused to report to work, both criminal and\n\nINS detainees, in a so-called \"Segregation Unit.\" He cited the\n\nOakdale rule book that \"[l]ate sleepers who are unable to maintain\n\ntheir rooms or unable to arrive to work on time are subject to\n\ndisciplinary action.\"        R. at 250.            He included the affidavit of\n\nRichard Haye, also an INS detainee at the time of Channer's\n\ndetention by the INS, who described a specific incident in which\n\nHaye observed Channer being threatened with detention in the\n\nsegregation unit if he refused to return to the dish room to work.\n\nR. at 248.        Haye also averred that all inmates at Oakdale,\n\nincluding himself and other INS detainees, were forced to work.                      R.\n\nat 248-49.   Assuming without deciding that segregated detention is\n\na form of legal punishment, we find that there would be at least\n\nsome evidence that Channer's services were compelled by the use of\n\n\n\n\n                                          9\n\flegal coercion.7\n\n      There are, however, two judicially-created exceptions to the\n\nprohibition of involuntary servitude.    Kozminski, 487 U.S. at 943,\n\n108 S.Ct. at 2760.   First, the government may compel its citizens,\n\nby threat of criminal sanction, to perform certain civic duties.\n\nSee, e.g., Hurtado v. United States, 410 U.S. 578, 589 n. 11, 93\n\nS.Ct. 1157, 1164 n. 11, 35 L.Ed.2d 508 (1973) (jury service);\n\nSelective Draft Law Cases, 245 U.S. 366, 390, 38 S.Ct. 159, 165, 62\n\nL.Ed. 349 (1918) (military service).        Second, the Thirteenth\n\nAmendment \"was intended to cover those forms of compulsory labor\n\nakin to African slavery which, in practical operation, would tend\n\nto produce like undesirable results,\" Butler v. Perry, 240 U.S.\n\n328, 332-33, 36 S.Ct. 258, 259-60, 60 L.Ed. 672 (1916).      It \"was\n\nnot intended to apply to \"exceptional' cases well established in\n\nthe common law at the time of the Thirteenth Amendment,\" such as\n\nlaws preventing desertion by sailors.    Kozminski, 487 U.S. at 944,\n\n108 S.Ct. at 2760-61 (quoting Robertson v. Baldwin, 165 U.S. 275,\n\n282, 17 S.Ct. 326, 329, 41 L.Ed. 715 (1897)).\n\n      Several courts have held that compelling individuals who are\n\ninvoluntarily   confined   in   mental   institutions   to   perform\n\nhousekeeping tasks does not violate the Thirteenth Amendment.     In\n\nBayh v. Sonnenburg, 573 N.E.2d 398, 412 (Ind.1991), the plaintiffs\n\n      7\n       Channer's services were not necessarily voluntary merely\nbecause he was paid for his labors. While receiving payment for\nservices is relevant to determining voluntariness, we cannot\nresolve that factual question against Channer on this record.\n\"Compensation for service may cause consent, but unless it does it\nis no justification for forced labor.\" Heflin v. Sanford, 142 F.2d\n798, 799 (5th Cir.1944).\n\n                                 10\n\fwere mental hospital patients who performed a variety of work\n\nactivities while hospitalized, such as fixing meals, scrubbing\n\ndishes, doing the laundry, and cleaning the building.           The Indiana\n\nSupreme   Court   held   that   such    labor   fit   within   the   Thirteen\n\nAmendment's \"civic duty\" exception. Id. at 410-11. Similarly, the\n\nSecond Circuit has held that inmates in mental hospitals can be\n\nrequired to perform housekeeping chores. Jobson v. Henne, 355 F.2d\n\n129, 131-32 (2d Cir.1966).       Like the mental hospital patients in\n\nthose cases, Channer performed a housekeeping chore, i.e., working\n\nin Oakdale's Food Services Department.          We hold that the federal\n\ngovernment is entitled to require a communal contribution by an INS\n\ndetainee in the form of housekeeping tasks, and that Channer's\n\nkitchen service, for which he was paid, did not violate the\n\nThirteenth Amendment's prohibition of involuntary servitude.8\n\n     For reasons stated, the judgment of the district court is\n\nAFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n     8\n      Because we hold that Channer's Thirteenth Amendment rights\nwere not violated, we do not reach the issue of qualified immunity.\nWe also find no merit to Channer's complaint with respect to the\nmotion to compel discovery and the alleged untimely objections to\nthe magistrate judge's report.\n\n                                       11\n\f",

Channer (\"Channer\"), a pro se appellant, was scheduled to complete a federal prison sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution at Oakdale, Louisiana (\"Oakdale\"), on March 2, 1994.  At his request, the Bureau of Prisons recalculated his release date to January 29, 1994, to reflect jail-time credits.  Channer was released into INS custody on January 31, 1994 pursuant to an Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\") detainer.  He was classified as an aggravated felon and held at Oakdale in \"no bond\" status.  Channer conceded his deportability and sought to be deported prior to March 2, 1994, the date on which he had originally been scheduled to complete his federal sentence.  He waived his right of appeal and received a final order of deportation on March 2, 1994.  On March 23, 1994, however, before Channer could be deported, Connecticut officials executed a detainer against him and took him into their custody to serve a twenty-year state sentence for armed robbery.  During Channer's detention at Oakdale, both as a federal prisoner and as an INS detainee, he worked in the Food Services Department from 4:30 a.m.  to 12:30 p.m.  each day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Channer brought an action in the Western District of Louisiana, Lake Charles Division, against Keith Hall, the warden at Oakdale during Channer's detention, and other federal officials and employees (\"Appellees\").  In an amended complaint filed in March 1994 and in later filings, Channer alleged that Appellees failed expeditiously to deport him as allegedly required by the former 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252.  He also alleged that the Appellees reduced him to involuntary servitude in violation of the Thirteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution by compelling him to work in the Food Services Department while he was an INS detainee.  He sought injunctive and monetary relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellees filed a motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, for summary judgment in which they raised the defense of qualified immunity.  After the magistrate judge issued his report and recommendations, Channer filed a motion to compel discovery on the Thirteenth Amendment issue.  Appellees filed no summary judgment evidence.  In separate orders, the district court granted their motion for summary judgment on all causes of action.  The court did not rule on the motion to compel discovery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Channer raises four issues on appeal, only two of which merit any discussion.  First, he appeals the district court's order dismissing his claim for damages arising out of the INS's failure expeditiously to deport him pursuant to a since-repealed version of 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Second, he appeals the order granting summary judgment in favor of Appellees on his Thirteenth Amendment claim for damages.  Appellees again raise the qualified immunity defense, which the magistrate judge and district court did not reach.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>INS's Failure to Deport</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While this appeal was pending, the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (\"IIRIRA\"), &#167;&#167; 305-306, Pub.L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 (Sept. 30, 1996), was enacted.  This statute repealed 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252.  The new provision which governs the detention and removal of aliens ordered removed, 8 U.S.C.A. &#167; 1231(h) (Supp.1997), provides that \"[n]othing in this section shall be construed to create any substantive or procedural right or benefit that is legally enforceable by any party against the United States or its agencies or officers or any other person.\"   The effective date of this provision was April 1, 1997.  IIRIRA, &#167; 309(a).  Because, as discussed below, Channer fails to state a claim under the repealed version of &#167; 1252, we need not reach the issue of whether the 1996 amendments to the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\") apply retroactively to his case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Channer brings claims under the former 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(c) and &#167; 1252(i).  The INA formerly provided that an alien who was not deported within six months of receiving a final order of deportation was to be released subject to supervision.  8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(c) (1994) (repealed 1996).  The former 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(i) provided that \"[i]n the case of an alien who is convicted of an offense which makes the alien subject to deportation, the Attorney General shall begin any deportation proceeding as expeditiously as possible after the date of the conviction.\"  8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(i) (1994) (repealed 1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The INA also provided, however, that \"[a]n alien sentenced to imprisonment shall not be deported until such imprisonment has been terminated by the release of the alien from confinement.\"  8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(h) (1994) (repealed 1996).  When Channer was released to INS custody after completing his federal prison sentence, he had not yet begun to serve his Connecticut prison sentence for armed robbery.  While no court appears to have addressed factual circumstances similar to Channer's case, we conclude that, had the INS \"expeditiously\" deported him before he began serving his Connecticut sentence, it would have violated &#167; 1252(h).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, Channer has no implied private cause of action for damages for the INS's failure to expedite his deportation.  In a similar case, we held that an alien lacks standing under the Mandamus and Venue Act (\"Mandamus Act\"), 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1361, or the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"), 5 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 500-706, to compel the INS to commence deportation proceedings pursuant to section 1252(i).  Giddings v. Chandler, 979 F.2d 1104, 1110 (5th Cir.1992).  As stated in Giddings,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>while &#167; 1252(i) imposes a duty on the Attorney General to begin proceedings once an alien is deemed deportable because of a conviction, that statute also grants the Attorney General discretion to proceed \"as expeditiously as possible.\"  ...  We read &#167; 1252(i) as imposing a duty on the Attorney General to deport criminal aliens, but we stop short of concluding that this creates a duty owed to the alien.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Giddings, 979 F.2d at 1109-10 (quoting 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(i)).  Neither the language nor the legislative history of this section suggests that Congress intended to create a private right of action for aliens, and no circuit has recognized a private right of action under section 1252(i).  See, e.g., Urbina-Mauricio v. INS, 989 F.2d 1085, 1088 (9th Cir.1993).  We decline to recognize such a right.  Dismissal of Channer's INA claim was proper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Thirteenth Amendment</p>\n    <p>A. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the granting of summary judgment de novo, examining the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmovant.  The moving party will prevail if he has demonstrated that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  Hale v. Townley, 45 F.3d 914, 917 (5th Cir.1995).  Furthermore, we must decide whether Channer has stated a claim for a violation of a constitutional right before reaching the issue of qualified immunity.  Doe v. Rains County Indep.  Sch. Dist., 66 F.3d 1402, 1404 (5th Cir.1995).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>B.

Six Unknown Named Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971) and its progeny.  We proceed to the question whether the actions about which Channer complains constitute involuntary servitude.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our inquiry begins with United States v. Kozminski, 487 U.S. 931, 108 S.Ct. 2751, 101 L.Ed.2d 788 (1988).  In that case, the Supreme Court held that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>the term \"involuntary servitude\" necessarily means a condition of servitude in which the victim is forced to work for the defendant by the use or threat of physical restraint or physical injury, or by the use or threat of coercion through law or the legal process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 952, 108 S.Ct. at 2765 (emphasis added).  Kozminski involved a criminal prosecution, but we effectively extended its definition of involuntary servitude to civil suits.  See Watson v. Graves, 909 F.2d 1549 (5th Cir.1990).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  In Watson, inmates who had participated in a work-release program sued local law enforcement officials for subjecting them to involuntary servitude.  We recognized that the inmates, despite their status as convicted criminals, retained their civil right not be subjected to involuntary servitude because they had not been sentenced to hard labor.  See id. at 1551, 1552.  \"Involuntary servitude\" was defined as</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>an action by the master causing the servant to have, or to believe he has, no way to avoid continued service or confinement.  When the employee has a choice, even though it is a painful one, there is no involuntary servitude.  A showing of compulsion is thus a prerequisite to proof of involuntary servitude.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 1552.

Rather, they had volunteered to work outside the jail under a local policy that gave them \"trusty\" status, and the</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>choice of whether to work outside of the jail for twenty dollars a day or remain inside the jail and earn nothing may have indeed been \"painful\" and quite possibly illegal under state law, but the evidence shows that neither [inmate] was forced to work or continued to work against his will.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 1552-53;  see also Brooks v. George County, Miss., 84 F.3d 157, 163 (5th Cir.1996) (holding that pretrial detainee's choice between periodically working outside jail in trusty status and remaining in jail all day, while \"painful,\" was not unconstitutionally coercive);  Franklin v. Kyle, 66 F.3d 323 (5th Cir.1995) (unpublished opinion) (holding that forcing prisoner to choose between working in prison industries program or risking loss of good-time credits was painful, but not unconstitutionally coercive).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Channer argues that he was intimidated and threatened with solitary confinement if he failed to work.  Because, however, he presented no evidence that he or any other inmate had been subjected to solitary confinement for refusing to work, the district court found that he had not proved compulsion.  It also found that his labor was not forced because he had been paid for the work he performed while an INS detainee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Channer, however, presented evidence of a policy at Oakdale to place any inmate who refused to report to work, both criminal and INS detainees, in a so-called \"Segregation Unit.\"  He cited the Oakdale rule book that \"[l]ate sleepers who are unable to maintain their rooms or unable to arrive to work on time are subject to disciplinary action.\"   R. at 250.  He included the affidavit of Richard Haye, also an INS detainee at the time of Channer's detention by the INS, who described a specific incident in which Haye observed Channer being threatened with detention in the segregation unit if he refused to return to the dish room to work.  R. at 248.  Haye also averred that all inmates at Oakdale, including himself and other INS detainees, were forced to work.  R. at 248-49.  Assuming without deciding that segregated detention is a form of legal punishment, we find that there would be at least some evidence that Channer's services were compelled by the use of legal coercion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are, however, two judicially-created exceptions to the prohibition of involuntary servitude.  Kozminski, 487 U.S. at 943, 108 S.Ct. at 2760.   First, the government may compel its citizens, by threat of criminal sanction, to perform certain civic duties.  See, e.g., Hurtado v. United States, 410 U.S. 578, 589 n. 11, 93 S.Ct. 1157, 1164 n. 11, 35 L.Ed.2d 508 (1973) (jury service);  Selective Draft Law Cases, 245 U.S. 366, 390, 38 S.Ct. 159, 165, 62 L.Ed. 349 (1918) (military service).  Second, the Thirteenth Amendment \"was intended to cover those forms of compulsory labor akin to African slavery which, in practical operation, would tend to produce like undesirable results,\" Butler v. Perry, 240 U.S. 328, 332-33, 36 S.Ct. 258, 259-60, 60 L.Ed. 672 (1916).  It \"was not intended to apply to 'exceptional' cases well established in the common law at the time of the Thirteenth Amendment,\" such as laws preventing desertion by sailors.  Kozminski, 487 U.S. at 944, 108 S.Ct. at 2760-61 (quoting Robertson v. Baldwin, 165 U.S. 275, 282, 17 S.Ct. 326, 329, 41 L.Ed. 715 (1897)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several courts have held that compelling individuals who are involuntarily confined in mental institutions to perform housekeeping tasks does not violate the Thirteenth Amendment.  In Bayh v. Sonnenburg, 573 N.E.2d 398, 412 (Ind.1991), the plaintiffs were mental hospital patients who performed a variety of work activities while hospitalized, such as fixing meals, scrubbing dishes, doing the laundry, and cleaning the building.  The Indiana Supreme Court held that such labor fit within the Thirteen Amendment's \"civic duty\" exception.  Id. at 410-11.   Similarly, the Second Circuit has held that inmates in mental hospitals can be required to perform housekeeping chores.  Jobson v. Henne, 355 F.2d 129, 131-32 (2d Cir.1966).  Like the mental hospital patients in those cases, Channer performed a housekeeping chore, i.e., working in Oakdale's Food Services Department.  We hold that the federal government is entitled to require a communal contribution by an INS detainee in the form of housekeeping tasks, and that Channer's kitchen service, for which he was paid, did not violate the Thirteenth Amendment's prohibition of involuntary servitude.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For reasons stated, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> District Judge of the Southern District of Texas, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> As the magistrate judge observed in his report and recommendations, it appears that Channer's desire to have his deportation expedited was fueled, at least in part, by his desire to avoid serving his twenty-year Connecticut sentence.  Connecticut officials apparently were unaware that his sentence had been recalculated to reflect jail-time credits</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Channer also appeals the dismissal of his claim under the 13th Amendment for damages against the INS. No Bivens remedy is available against a federal agency, FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U.S. 471, 482-86, 114 S.Ct. 996, 1004-06, 127 L.Ed.2d 308 (1994), and there is no indication that Channer pursued a Federal Tort Claims Act claim</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The Amendment's exception, which permits involuntary servitude as punishment for a crime for which the party has been duly convicted, would be inapplicable after Channer completed his criminal sentence and became an INS detainee.  While it is not clear from the record that all of Channer's evidence on involuntary servitude relates to his period of INS detention, Appellees do not address this issue.  For summary judgment purposes, therefore, we treat this evidence as relating to the period in which he was detained by the INS</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Section two \"clothe[s] 'Congress with power to pass all laws necessary and proper for abolishing all badges and incidents of slavery in the United States.' \"  Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., 392 U.S. 409, 439, 88 S.Ct. 2186, 2203, 20 L.Ed.2d 1189 (1968) (quoting The Civil Rights Cases, 109 U.S. 3, 20, 3 S.Ct. 18, 27-28, 27 L.Ed. 835 (1883)) (emphasis omitted).  Appellees contend that there is no direct private right of action under the Amendment because Congress acting under &#167; 2 is the creator and definer of 13th Amendment rights.  While it is true that suits attacking the \"badges and incidents of slavery\" must be based on a statute enacted under &#167; 2, suits attacking compulsory labor arise directly under prohibition of &#167; 1, which is \"undoubtedly self-executing without any ancillary legislation\" and \"[b]y its own unaided force and effect ... abolished slavery, and established universal freedom.\"  The Civil Rights Cases, 109 U.S. at 20, 3 S.Ct. at 28.   The cases upon which Appellees rely are &#167; 2 \"badges and incidents\" cases and are thus inapplicable to Channer's claim.  See, e.g., Griffin v. Breckenridge, 403 U.S. 88, 91 S.Ct. 1790, 29 L.Ed.2d 338 (1971) (suit under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1985(3) arising out of racially motivated assault and battery);  Holland v. Board of Trustees of Univ.

Channer (\"Channer\"), a pro se appellant, was scheduled to complete a federal prison sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution at Oakdale, Louisiana (\"Oakdale\"), on March 2, 1994.  At his request, the Bureau of Prisons recalculated his release date to January 29, 1994, to reflect jail-time credits.  Channer was released into INS custody on January 31, 1994 pursuant to an Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\") detainer.  He was classified as an aggravated felon and held at Oakdale in \"no bond\" status.  Channer conceded his deportability and sought to be deported prior to March 2, 1994, the date on which he had originally been scheduled to complete his federal sentence.  He waived his right of appeal and received a final order of deportation on March 2, 1994.  On March 23, 1994, however, before Channer could be deported, Connecticut officials executed a detainer against him and took him into their custody to serve a twenty-year state sentence for armed robbery.  During Channer's detention at Oakdale, both as a federal prisoner and as an INS detainee, he worked in the Food Services Department from 4:30 a.m.  to 12:30 p.m.  each day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Channer brought an action in the Western District of Louisiana, Lake Charles Division, against Keith Hall, the warden at Oakdale during Channer's detention, and other federal officials and employees (\"Appellees\").  In an amended complaint filed in March 1994 and in later filings, Channer alleged that Appellees failed expeditiously to deport him as allegedly required by the former 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252.  He also alleged that the Appellees reduced him to involuntary servitude in violation of the Thirteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution by compelling him to work in the Food Services Department while he was an INS detainee.  He sought injunctive and monetary relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellees filed a motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, for summary judgment in which they raised the defense of qualified immunity.  After the magistrate judge issued his report and recommendations, Channer filed a motion to compel discovery on the Thirteenth Amendment issue.  Appellees filed no summary judgment evidence.  In separate orders, the district court granted their motion for summary judgment on all causes of action.  The court did not rule on the motion to compel discovery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Channer raises four issues on appeal, only two of which merit any discussion.  First, he appeals the district court's order dismissing his claim for damages arising out of the INS's failure expeditiously to deport him pursuant to a since-repealed version of 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Second, he appeals the order granting summary judgment in favor of Appellees on his Thirteenth Amendment claim for damages.  Appellees again raise the qualified immunity defense, which the magistrate judge and district court did not reach.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>INS's Failure to Deport</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While this appeal was pending, the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (\"IIRIRA\"), &#167;&#167; 305-306, Pub.L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 (Sept. 30, 1996), was enacted.  This statute repealed 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252.  The new provision which governs the detention and removal of aliens ordered removed, 8 U.S.C.A. &#167; 1231(h) (Supp.1997), provides that \"[n]othing in this section shall be construed to create any substantive or procedural right or benefit that is legally enforceable by any party against the United States or its agencies or officers or any other person.\"   The effective date of this provision was April 1, 1997.  IIRIRA, &#167; 309(a).  Because, as discussed below, Channer fails to state a claim under the repealed version of &#167; 1252, we need not reach the issue of whether the 1996 amendments to the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\") apply retroactively to his case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Channer brings claims under the former 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(c) and &#167; 1252(i).  The INA formerly provided that an alien who was not deported within six months of receiving a final order of deportation was to be released subject to supervision.  8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(c) (1994) (repealed 1996).  The former 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(i) provided that \"[i]n the case of an alien who is convicted of an offense which makes the alien subject to deportation, the Attorney General shall begin any deportation proceeding as expeditiously as possible after the date of the conviction.\"  8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(i) (1994) (repealed 1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The INA also provided, however, that \"[a]n alien sentenced to imprisonment shall not be deported until such imprisonment has been terminated by the release of the alien from confinement.\"  8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(h) (1994) (repealed 1996).  When Channer was released to INS custody after completing his federal prison sentence, he had not yet begun to serve his Connecticut prison sentence for armed robbery.  While no court appears to have addressed factual circumstances similar to Channer's case, we conclude that, had the INS \"expeditiously\" deported him before he began serving his Connecticut sentence, it would have violated &#167; 1252(h).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, Channer has no implied private cause of action for damages for the INS's failure to expedite his deportation.  In a similar case, we held that an alien lacks standing under the Mandamus and Venue Act (\"Mandamus Act\"), 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1361, or the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"), 5 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 500-706, to compel the INS to commence deportation proceedings pursuant to section 1252(i).

We read &#167; 1252(i) as imposing a duty on the Attorney General to deport criminal aliens, but we stop short of concluding that this creates a duty owed to the alien.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Giddings, 979 F.2d at 1109-10 (quoting 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(i)).  Neither the language nor the legislative history of this section suggests that Congress intended to create a private right of action for aliens, and no circuit has recognized a private right of action under section 1252(i).  See, e.g., Urbina-Mauricio v. INS, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"603581\"><a href=\"/opinion/603581/antonio-urbina-mauricio-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">989</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1085</span></a></span>, 1088 (9th Cir.1993).

In Bayh v.

The Indiana Supreme Court held that such labor fit within the Thirteen Amendment's \"civic duty\" exception.  Id. at 410-11.   Similarly, the Second Circuit has held that inmates in mental hospitals can be required to perform housekeeping chores.  Jobson v. Henne, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"270321\"><a href=\"/opinion/270321/warren-jobson-v-frank-r-henne-edward-d-stevenson-murray-bergman-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">355</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">129</span></a></span>, 131-32 (2d Cir.1966).  Like the mental hospital patients in those cases, Channer performed a housekeeping chore, i.e., working in Oakdale's Food Services Department.  We hold that the federal government is entitled to require a communal contribution by an INS detainee in the form of housekeeping tasks, and that Channer's kitchen service, for which he was paid, did not violate the Thirteenth Amendment's prohibition of involuntary servitude.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For reasons stated, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> District Judge of the Southern District of Texas, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> As the magistrate judge observed in his report and recommendations, it appears that Channer's desire to have his deportation expedited was fueled, at least in part, by his desire to avoid serving his twenty-year Connecticut sentence.

Appellees contend that there is no direct private right of action under the Amendment because Congress acting under &#167; 2 is the creator and definer of 13th Amendment rights.  While it is true that suits attacking the \"badges and incidents of slavery\" must be based on a statute enacted under &#167; 2, suits attacking compulsory labor arise directly under prohibition of &#167; 1, which is \"undoubtedly self-executing without any ancillary legislation\" and \"[b]y its own unaided force and effect ... abolished slavery, and established universal freedom.\"  The Civil Rights Cases, 109 U.S. at 20, 3 S.Ct. at 28.   The cases upon which Appellees rely are &#167; 2 \"badges and incidents\" cases and are thus inapplicable to Channer's claim.  See, e.g., Griffin v.
