In this bitterly-fought civil\n\nrights case, the district court awarded substantial attorneys'\n\nfees and ancillary expenses to a consortium of plaintiffs — the\n\nGay Officers Action League (GOAL), Carroll Hunter, Thomas Jeans,\n\nand Dr. Rosalina Ramos Padró (collectively, the plaintiffs)1 —\n\nagainst the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.         The Commonwealth\n\nappeals.   Concluding, as we do, that the district court acted\n\nwithin its discretion in determining that the plaintiffs were\n\nprevailing parties with respect to a discrete claim in the\n\nunderlying litigation, we affirm the finding that they were\n\nentitled to a fee award.   Withal, we reduce the amount by nearly\n\n$40,000.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n           On June 19, 1995, the plaintiffs sued the Commonwealth\n\nfor damages and equitable relief.2      Invoking 42 U.S.C. § 1983,\n\nthey alleged, inter alia, that the Commonwealth violated their\n\n\n\n     1GOAL is a nonprofit organization comprising police officers\ndedicated to protecting the rights of gays and lesbians. Hunter\nand Jeans are members of GOAL and, at the times relevant hereto,\nwere GOAL's principal officers.       Ramos Padró is a lesbian\nactivist resident in Puerto Rico.\n     2\n     The plaintiffs named the superintendent and several members\nof the Puerto Rico Police Department (PRPD) as additional\ndefendants.   Since the presence of these defendants is of\nmarginal relevance for purposes of this appeal, we treat the\nCommonwealth as if it were the sole defendant.\n\n                               -2-\n\fconstitutional rights by (1) forbidding them from participating\n\nin an impromptu rally, (2) subjecting them to excessive force,\n\n(3)   conducting   an   unlawful   search     of   a     gay   bar,    and   (4)\n\nillegally videotaping a \"Gay Pride\" parade.             Following a year of\n\nprocedural   wrangling    and    increasingly      acrimonious        discovery\n\ndisputes, the plaintiffs amended their complaint to include,\n\namong other things, a claim that Regulation 29 — a police\n\ndepartment regulation which made \"associat[ing] with . . .\n\nhomosexuals\"   violative    of   the   code   of       conduct   and   exposed\n\nviolators to official discipline — impugned the plaintiffs'\n\nFirst Amendment rights.\n\n          In due course, the district court (a) granted summary\n\njudgment in the Commonwealth's favor as to all claims anent the\n\nrally, the use of force, the search, and the videotaping; (b)\n\nleft for trial certain (subsequently settled) claims against\n\nindividual   officers;    and    (c)   entered     a    judgment      declaring\n\nRegulation 29 unconstitutional.          The last ruling is the focal\n\npoint of this appeal.\n\n          The Commonwealth did not take the court's repudiation\n\nof Regulation 29 lightly.        It filed a detailed motion to alter\n\nor amend the judgment.     The district court stood firm.               At that\n\npoint, the Commonwealth, instead of throwing in the towel,\n\ndecided to rewrite Regulation 29.           The revised regulation no\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\flonger singled out homosexuals in haec verba, but, rather, paved\n\nthe way for disciplinary action against officers who \"relate to\n\nor    associate    with    persons       of   dubious      reputation\"      (a    group\n\ndefined to include \"anyone who engages in conduct that departs\n\nfrom the community's moral standards\").\n\n           After the parties filed extensive briefs, the court\n\nrejected   the     revised       regulation      as   an   exercise    in    \"crafty\n\ndrafting\" and a thinly-veiled effort to do by indirection what\n\nthe court had prohibited the PRPD from doing directly.                                 To\n\ninsure    against    any       future    evasions,      the   court    permanently\n\nenjoined the Commonwealth from punishing any police officer for\n\nassociating with homosexuals.\n\n           Still unrepentant, the Commonwealth moved to vacate the\n\ninjunction.       After briefing and argument, the court demurred.\n\nThis resolved the matter, as the Commonwealth chose not to\n\nappeal.     The     district      court's       decision    on   the   merits      thus\n\nripened into a final judgment.\n\n           The plaintiffs thereafter petitioned for $209,122.67\n\nin attorneys' fees and $21,294.92 in expenses.                   They accompanied\n\nthe    application        with    their       attorneys'      sworn    statements,\n\ninformation       concerning       the    attorneys'        credentials,         and    a\n\nrecasted    version       of   the   attorneys'       contemporaneous        billing\n\nrecords (which separated the work related to the extirpation of\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\fRegulation 29 from other work performed).                    The Commonwealth\n\nfiled an opposition.\n\n             Taking up the question, the district court first ruled\n\nthat   the    plaintiffs         were    prevailing     parties.       It   next\n\nscrutinized       each   attorney's      hours   and,   notwithstanding        the\n\nlawyers' assurances that they had eliminated all time spent on\n\nunrelated issues, subtracted some additional hours.                    The court\n\nthen adjusted the attorneys' customary billing rates to reflect\n\nlocal stipends for comparably qualified counsel and trimmed (or\n\nin some instances disallowed) various expense items.                    When all\n\nwas said and done, the court determined that the plaintiffs\n\ndeserved legal fees in the amount of $202,733.86, allocated as\n\nfollows:\n\n             1.   Attorney Judith Berkan — 93.1325 hours at $240 per\n\nhour   and    1.112      hours   at     $265   per   hour,   for   a   total   of\n\n$22,646.48.\n\n             2.   Attorney Suzanne B. Goldberg — 416.75 hours at $240\n\nper hour, for a total of $100,020.\n\n             3.   Attorney Ruth E. Harlow — 123.45 hours at $240 per\n\nhour, for a total of $29,628.\n\n             4.   Attorney Colleen M. Meenan — 224.175 hours at $225\n\nper hour, for a total of $50,439.38.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\fThe court also awarded the plaintiffs a total of $13,787.40 in\n\nexpenses.     This appeal followed.\n\n            We divide our ensuing discussion into three segments,\n\none dealing with the standard of appellate review, the second\n\nwith the plaintiffs' eligibility for a fee award, and the third\n\nwith the dollars involved.\n\nII.    THE STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n            In appeals involving the Fees Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1988,\n\na reviewing court customarily defers to the trial judge, whose\n\nintimate    knowledge      of   the    nuances       of    the   underlying     case\n\nuniquely positions him to construct a condign award.                    See Coutin\n\nv. Young & Rubicam, Inc., 124 F.3d 331, 336 (1st Cir. 1997);\n\nLipsett     v.   Blanco,    975       F.2d    934,    937    (1st    Cir.    1992).\n\nAccordingly,      our   review        here    is     for    manifest    abuse    of\n\ndiscretion.      E.g., Foley v. City of Lowell, 948 F.2d 10, 18 (1st\n\nCir.   1991).      Apart    from      mistakes       of    law   —   which   always\n\nconstitute abuses of a court's discretion, see United States v.\n\nSnyder, 136 F.3d 65, 67 (1st Cir. 1998) — we will set aside a\n\nfee award only if it clearly appears that the trial court\n\nignored a factor deserving significant weight, relied upon an\n\nimproper factor, or evaluated all the proper factors (and no\n\nimproper ones), but made a serious mistake in weighing them.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fSee Foster v. Mydas Assoc., Inc., 943 F.2d 139, 143 (1st Cir.\n\n1991).\n\nIII.     THE FACT OF THE AWARD\n\n            The Commonwealth's attack on the fact of the award\n\nhinges on its contention that the plaintiffs were not prevailing\n\nparties in the underlying litigation (and, thus, not entitled to\n\nrecoup fees and expenses at all).        The district court rejected\n\nthis contention, and so do we.\n\n            Under   the   so-called    \"American    Rule,\"     litigants\n\ngenerally pay their own way.          Alyeska Pipeline Serv. Co. v.\n\nWilderness Soc'y, 421 U.S. 240, 247 (1975).        Sometimes, however,\n\nCongress provides otherwise.      The Fees Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1988,\n\nconstitutes such a proviso.      In regard to cases brought under\n\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the Fees Act\n\nstates in pertinent part that \"the court, in its discretion, may\n\nallow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a\n\nreasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs.\"             42 U.S.C. §\n\n1988(b).     Although this fee-shifting provision is couched in\n\npermissive terminology, awards in favor of prevailing civil\n\nrights plaintiffs are virtually obligatory.         See Stanton v. S.\n\nBerkshire Reg'l Sch. Dist., 197 F.3d 574, 576 (1st Cir. 1999)\n\n(explaining that the Supreme Court has interpreted section 1988\n\nto require fees in favor of prevailing civil rights plaintiffs\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\f\"save for rare cases\"); Casa Marie Hogar Geriatrico, Inc. v.\n\nRivera-Santos, 38 F.3d 615, 618 (1st Cir. 1994) (noting that\n\nprevailing civil rights plaintiffs are presumptively entitled to\n\nfee awards); see also Blanchard v. Bergeron, 489 U.S. 87, 89 n.1\n\n(1989).   The threshold question, then, is whether the plaintiffs\n\nare prevailing parties within the purview of the Fees Act.\n\n            Typically, achieving prevailing party status requires\n\na plaintiff to show that he succeeded on an important issue in\n\nthe case, thereby gaining at least some of the benefit he sought\n\nin bringing suit.          Hensley v.      Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 433\n\n(1983); Nadeau v.      Helgemoe, 581 F.2d 275, 278-79 (1st Cir.\n\n1978).    Put another way, \"a plaintiff 'prevails' when actual\n\nrelief on the merits of his claim materially alters the legal\n\nrelationship between the parties by modifying the defendant's\n\nbehavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff.\"               Farrar\n\nv.   Hobby,   506   U.S.   103,   111-12     (1992);   accord   Tex.    State\n\nTeachers Ass'n v. Garland Indep. Sch. Dist., 489 U.S. 782, 791-\n\n92 (1989).\n\n            In this case, the plaintiffs \"prevailed\" in the sense\n\nthat they secured declaratory and injunctive relief in their\n\nfacial challenge to the constitutionality of Regulation 29.               But\n\nobtaining     equitable     relief   does     not   automatically      confer\n\nprevailing party status for purposes of the Fees Act.               See Tex.\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fState Teachers, 489 U.S. at 792-93; Rhodes v. Stewart, 488 U.S.\n\n1, 3-4 (1988) (per curiam).       An inquiring court always must make\n\na qualitative inquiry into the import of the relief obtained,\n\nand the Commonwealth posits that the relief obtained here was so\n\ntrivial that the plaintiffs cannot be deemed prevailing parties.\n\n           Insofar   as    this   argument     attempts       to   bundle   the\n\nplaintiffs' Regulation 29 claim with their other (generally\n\nunsuccessful) claims, it lacks force.                \"[T]he degree of the\n\nplaintiff's    success    in   relation   to   the    other    goals   of   the\n\nlawsuit is a factor critical to the determination of the size of\n\na reasonable fee, not to eligibility for a fee award at all.\"\n\nTex. State Teachers, 489 U.S. at 790 (emphasis omitted).                Since\n\nthe plaintiffs' effort to nullify Regulation 29 constituted a\n\ndiscrete claim within a larger case, our focus must not be on\n\nwho won more claims, but on how the parties fared with respect\n\nto the Regulation 29 claim.       If the plaintiffs' success on that\n\ndiscrete   claim   represented     a   meaningful      victory,      they   are\n\nprevailing parties.       Id. at 789-92; Hensley, 461 U.S. at 434-35.\n\nIf, however, the plaintiffs' success on that claim was \"purely\n\ntechnical or    de minimis,\" a court would be well within its\n\nrights to deny prevailing party status.              Tex. State Teachers,\n\n489 U.S. at 792 (dictum).         \"Of itself, the moral satisfaction\n\nthat results from any favorable statement of law cannot bestow\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\fprevailing party status.\"          Farrar, 506 U.S. at 112 (citation and\n\ninternal quotation marks omitted).\n\n              Turning to this analysis, the Commonwealth asseverates\n\nthat the plaintiffs are not prevailing parties with respect to\n\ntheir      Regulation     29   claim    because       the   regulation      was    an\n\nanachronism which the PRPD never enforced and, in fact, had\n\nintended to scrap long before the plaintiffs sought a judicial\n\nanodyne.      This asseveration rests on the premise that winning an\n\ninjunction against the enforcement of a moribund statute or\n\nregulation ordinarily is not enough to transform a plaintiff\n\ninto a prevailing party.         See id.       We agree with that premise as\n\nan abstract statement of the law, but it has no application here\n\nfor at least two reasons.\n\n              First,    the    PRPD     never        publicly     repudiated      the\n\nregulation before the plaintiffs challenged it, and the record\n\ncontains      evidence,    credited      by    the    district    court,    of    its\n\nchilling effect on First Amendment rights.3                     Thus, even if the\n\nPRPD harbored an unexpressed intention not to enforce Regulation\n\n29,    neither    gay   officers       nor    gay    civilians    who    wished    to\n\nassociate with police officers would have had any way to know of\n\nthat       intention.     By   convincing           the   court   to    strike    the\n\n\n       3\n     For example, GOAL members testified that they felt obliged\nto arrange clandestine meetings with gay PRPD officers out of\nconcern for the officers' careers.\n\n                                        -10-\n\fregulation down, therefore, the plaintiffs at the very least\n\ndispelled a pall that burdened associational rights.                   Cf. NAACP\n\nv.    Ala.    ex    rel.    Patterson,    357       U.S.   449,   461-62   (1958)\n\n(discussing         government    activity          that    unconstitutionally\n\ndiscouraged individuals or groups from exercising freedom of\n\nassociation).        Viewed from that perspective, the plaintiffs'\n\ndecision to litigate the validity of Regulation 29, and the\n\nresults      that   they    obtained     in   that    endeavor,     accomplished\n\nsomething worthwhile.\n\n             Second — and perhaps more salient — the record does not\n\nsupport the Commonwealth's self-serving protestation that, even\n\nbefore the plaintiffs sued, Regulation 29 was a dead letter.\n\nFrom the moment that the plaintiffs called the constitutionality\n\nof Regulation 29 into question, the Commonwealth vigorously\n\ndefended it.        Instead of disowning the regulation or announcing\n\nthat it had outlived its usefulness, the Commonwealth stridently\n\nopposed the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment.                    When the\n\ncourt deemed the regulation unconstitutional, the Commonwealth\n\ndid not acquiesce, but, rather, fought tooth and nail to reverse\n\nthat decision.        Even after the court declined to alter or amend\n\nthe   declaration      of    invalidity,      the    Commonwealth    refused   to\n\nabandon the regulation, preferring to tinker with its text in a\n\nbenighted attempt to evade the thrust of the court's ruling.\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\f            It is trite, but true, that actions often speak louder\n\nthan words.           So it is here.             The Commonwealth's course of\n\nconduct     convincingly          contradicts            its     current    claim       that\n\nRegulation       29   was   an    anachronism            which    the    PRPD    long    had\n\nintended to rescind.\n\n            To sum up, the question of whether or not obtaining\n\nequitable     relief        is     sufficiently            meaningful       to    warrant\n\nprevailing party status is case-specific.                        In this instance, the\n\nrecord    amply       supports         the   district          court's     finding      that\n\nRegulation 29 was extant when the plaintiffs took up the cudgels\n\nagainst it.      Consequently, striking the regulation down achieved\n\none of the plaintiffs' preeminent goals.\n\n            If more were needed — and we do not believe that it is\n\n— the Fees Act was intended to encourage citizens to vindicate\n\nrights    that    concern        the    public      as    a    whole.      See   City     of\n\nRiverside v. Rivera, 477 U.S. 561, 574-75 (1986).                           This suit is\n\na paradigmatic example of the kind of case that Congress had in\n\nmind when it enacted section 1988.                       See Aubin v. Fudala, 782\n\nF.2d 287, 290-91 (1st Cir. 1986) (explaining that declaratory\n\njudgments can further the policies behind the Fees Act).                                 The\n\ncourt's declaration that Regulation 29 was unconstitutional\n\nclearly benefitted both the plaintiffs and the public as a\n\n\n\n\n                                             -12-\n\fwhole.     Writing off the plaintiffs' victory as de minimis would\n\nignore that reality.\n\n            We   will    not   paint    the    lily.    While    many    of   the\n\nplaintiffs'      other    claims       failed,    the   nisi     prius    court\n\nconclusively determined that Regulation 29 violated their First\n\nAmendment rights.        That decision settled a significant issue\n\nwhose     resolution    benefitted     the    plaintiffs   and   the     public.\n\nGiven this predicate, the district court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in concluding that the plaintiffs were prevailing\n\nparties for purposes of the discrete Regulation 29 claim.                  A fee\n\naward therefore was due.\n\nIV.     THE AMOUNT OF THE AWARD\n\n            The second wave of the Commonwealth's offensive targets\n\nthe amount of the fee award.4                 Even if the plaintiffs are\n\nprevailing parties, the Commonwealth says, the award should be\n\nreduced because, among other things, it is disproportionately\n\nlarge;     the   plaintiffs     failed    to     produce   adequate      records\n\ndocumenting their attorneys' time; the case was staffed too\n\ndensely; and the court was overly generous in its treatment of\n\n\n\n\n      4\n     On appeal, the Commonwealth does not challenge the expenses\nawarded by the district court. Consequently, we deem any such\nchallenge waived. See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17\n(1st Cir. 1990).\n\n                                       -13-\n\foverlapping issues.          We turn first to the anatomy of the award,\n\nand then examine the Commonwealth's contentions.\n\n                        A.   The Anatomy of the Award.\n\n            Under most federal fee-shifting statutes, including the\n\nFees Act, the trial judge must determine \"the number of hours\n\nreasonably expended on the litigation multiplied by a reasonable\n\nhourly rate.\"      Hensley, 461 U.S. at 433.           In implementing this\n\nlodestar approach, the judge calculates the time counsel spent\n\non the case, subtracts duplicative, unproductive, or excessive\n\nhours,    and    then    applies   prevailing   rates    in   the   community\n\n(taking    into    account      the   qualifications,     experience,      and\n\nspecialized competence of the attorneys involved).              Lipsett, 975\n\nF.2d at 937; United States v. Metro. Dist. Comm'n, 847 F.2d 12,\n\n15-17 (1st Cir. 1988); Grendel's Den, Inc. v. Larkin, 749 F.2d\n\n945, 950-51 (1st Cir. 1984).\n\n            In     fashioning         fee    awards,      the       attorneys'\n\ncontemporaneous billing records constitute the usual starting\n\npoint, but the court's discretion is by no means shackled by\n\nthose records.          For example, it is the court's prerogative\n\n(indeed, its duty) to winnow out excessive hours, time spent\n\ntilting at windmills, and the like.             Coutin, 124 F.3d at 337.\n\nBy the same token, the court may take guidance from, but is not\n\n\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\fbound by, an attorney's standard billing rate.                 See Brewster v.\n\nDukakis, 3 F.3d 488, 492-93 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n              Chief Judge Laffitte followed this procedure.                    He\n\nstarted with the time compilations submitted by the plaintiffs'\n\nlawyers.       Despite    the    attorneys'     representations      that     the\n\ncompilations only included time spent in connection with their\n\nefforts to prove the infirmity of Regulation 29, the court\n\nsharply reduced the number of hours claimed for researching this\n\nissue prior to June 19, 1995 (the date on which the plaintiffs\n\nfiled   the    original    complaint     that    contained     no   mention    of\n\nRegulation 29).5        Turning to the other side of the grid, the\n\ncourt ratcheted some of the billing rates downward to correspond\n\nmore closely with local standards.            See Adcock-Ladd v. Sec'y of\n\nTreas.,    227   F.3d     343,   350   (6th     Cir.   2000)   (holding     that\n\nreasonable hourly rates should be set by reference to rates in\n\nthe court's vicinage rather than in the lawyer's region of\n\norigin).      The court then multiplied the adjusted hours by the\n\nadjusted rates to ascertain fees attributable to the work of\n\n\n    5 The court did, however, find that the work done by the\nattorneys on standing was interconnected with the Regulation 29\nissue, and included the time spent researching that issue. The\nCommonwealth does not seriously challenge this finding and, in\nall events, the finding seems unassailable. See Aubin, 782 F.2d\nat 291 (explaining that plaintiffs are entitled not only to fees\nfor work done on winning claims but also for work done on other\nclaims involving \"a common core of facts\" or \"related legal\ntheories\") (quoting Hensley, 461 U.S. at 435).\n\n                                       -15-\n\feach of the four attorneys, aggregating those four figures to\n\narrive at the amount of the award.\n\n                  B.    The Commonwealth's Rejoinder.\n\n           We address the Commonwealth's main arguments seriatim.\n\nIts other points are insufficiently developed, patently wrong,\n\nor both.   We reject them without editorial comment.\n\n           1.     Proportionality.               We need not tarry over the\n\nCommonwealth's assertion that the award is disproportionate to\n\nthe degree of the plaintiffs' success.                     While degree of success\n\nis critical in determining the amount of a fee award, Tex. State\n\nTeachers, 489 U.S. at 790, proportionality is no longer an issue\n\nonce the prevailing party has separated the wheat from the chaff\n\n(i.e.,   isolated      the   time    spent       on    her   successful   claim    or\n\nclaims).    See     Hensley,        461    U.S.       at   434-35.    Because     the\n\nplaintiffs here have limited their fee petition to the solitary\n\nclaim on which they prevailed completely, proportionality is no\n\nlonger critical.6       See City of Riverside, 477 U.S. at 574.                   The\n\nreal question is to what extent the method of calculation, the\n\n\n\n\n    6This is not to say that proportionality may not, in some\ncircumstances, bear upon the amount of an award. E.g., Farrar,\n506 U.S. at 113-16. Here, however, we already have determined\nthat the plaintiffs won a total and significant victory vis-à-\nvis Regulation 29.    See supra Part III.   Proportionality is\ntherefore not a material issue at this stage of the case.\n\n                                          -16-\n\fclaimed      hours    and   rates,    and       the    associated      documentation\n\nproject a reasonable fee.\n\n             2. Time Records.        The Commonwealth next complains that\n\nthe   very    basis    of   the    lower    court's       calculation        is   faulty\n\nbecause the plaintiffs neglected to produce contemporaneous time\n\nrecords.        Without     drawing       our     attention       to   any    specific\n\ndeficiencies in the records presented, the Commonwealth argues\n\nthat the lower court erroneously accepted \"shorthand summary\n\ncompilations.\"\n\n             The facts are these.                The plaintiffs provided the\n\ndistrict court with four accounts — one for each lawyer — that\n\nsynthesized, excerpted, and reproduced entries from the lawyers'\n\noriginal time sheets.           The plaintiffs followed this praxis in an\n\napparent effort both to segregate time spent on unsuccessful,\n\nunrelated claims and to create a more intelligible format for\n\njudicial consideration of their requests.\n\n             The     district     court    welcomed       these    submissions       and\n\nelected not to require the plaintiffs to produce the original\n\ntime sheets.         We discern no error.              Our cases make clear that\n\nprevailing      parties     who    intend        to    seek   counsel    fee      awards\n\nordinarily must ensure that contemporaneous time records are\n\nkept in reasonable detail.                E.g., Lipsett, 975 F.2d at 938;\n\nGrendel's Den, 749 F.2d at 952.                       These precedents warn that\n\n\n                                          -17-\n\ffailure to do so may have deleterious consequences (such as the\n\nslashing or disallowance of an award).                             Lipsett, 975 F.2d at\n\n938;    Grendel's       Den,       749   F.2d    at    952.         Here,    however,      the\n\nplaintiffs       satisfied         that    obligation:              each     of    the    four\n\nattorneys       filed        an     affidavit         attesting           that    she     kept\n\ncontemporaneous time records.                 The fact that counsel, in helping\n\nto prepare the fee application, transcribed the notations on\n\ntheir    time     sheets          verbatim      and,        for    ease     in    reference,\n\nincorporated       the       transcriptions            in     compilations,         did    not\n\ncompromise the integrity of their billing records.                                After all,\n\nthe compilations simplified matters and enabled the lower court\n\nmore easily to assess the merits of the parties' conflicting\n\ncontentions.            If        the    Commonwealth             doubted    whether       the\n\ncompilations faithfully tracked the time sheets, it could have\n\nfiled a discovery request for the original records.                                     Having\n\neschewed that course, it cannot now be heard to complain that\n\nthe judge, who expressed satisfaction with the accuracy and\n\nadequacy of the plaintiffs' proffer, did not demand to see the\n\nraw data.\n\n            3.    Overstaffing.           The Commonwealth maintains that the\n\nplaintiffs overstaffed the litigation, drawing on a battery of\n\nlawyers when one would have sufficed.                              Such a claim brings\n\n\n\n\n                                             -18-\n\fcertain general rules into play.                 We briefly rehearse those\n\nrules.\n\n             On the one hand, awards under the Fees Act are not\n\nintended \"to serve as full employment or continuing education\n\nprograms for lawyers and paralegals.\"                Lipsett, 975 F.2d at 938.\n\nIn that spirit, a court should not hesitate to discount hours if\n\nit sees signs that a prevailing party has overstaffed a case.\n\nSee Hart v. Bourque, 798 F.2d 519, 523 (1st Cir. 1986).                  On the\n\nother hand, courts must be careful not to throw out the baby\n\nwith the bath water.       Given the complexity of modern litigation,\n\nthe deployment of multiple attorneys is sometimes an eminently\n\nreasonable tactic.        Consequently, the mere fact that more than\n\none lawyer toils on the same general task does not necessarily\n\nconstitute excessive staffing.              Rodriguez-Hernandez v. Miranda-\n\nVelez, 132 F.3d 848, 860 (1st Cir. 1998).               Effective preparation\n\nand     presentation      of   a   case      often     involve   the   kind    of\n\ncollaboration      that    only    occurs      when    several   attorneys    are\n\nworking on a single issue.            Id.\n\n             The Commonwealth argues that the central legal question\n\nhere — the constitutionality of Regulation 29 — was pedestrian,\n\nand   that   the   engagement      of    multiple      counsel   therefore    was\n\nunwarranted.       But it is too much of a stretch to say that the\n\nFirst    Amendment     issue   here     was,    in    the   Commonwealth's    pat\n\n\n                                        -19-\n\fphrase,       \"simple   and   straightforward.\"      The     Commonwealth's\n\nconclusion seems particularly dubious when one factors into the\n\nmix the ancillary issue of standing (a knotty problem, on these\n\nfacts).       See supra note 5.\n\n              The ferocity of the Commonwealth's defense likewise\n\nundermines its assertion that the plaintiffs did not need to\n\ncall up the reserves in order to litigate the Regulation 29\n\nissue.        Although the Commonwealth now claims that it never\n\nparticularly cared about the fate of the supposedly unused\n\nregulation, it certainly did not display any such indifference\n\nin the district court.        To the contrary, it mounted a Stalingrad\n\ndefense of Regulation 29, battling from rock to rock and tree to\n\ntree.     After setting such a militant tone and forcing the\n\nplaintiffs to respond in kind, it seems disingenuous for the\n\nCommonwealth to castigate the plaintiffs for putting too many\n\ntroops into the field.         Cf. City of Riverside, 477 U.S. at 581\n\nn.11 (\"The government cannot litigate tenaciously and then be\n\nheard    to    complain   about   the   time   necessarily   spent   by   the\n\nplaintiff in response.\") (citation and internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).\n\n              Even so, we remain skeptical about the use of four\n\nattorneys to litigate a single claim — particularly a claim that\n\ndid not necessitate a trial.            Where tag teams of attorneys are\n\n\n                                    -20-\n\finvolved, fee applications should be scrutinized with especial\n\ncare.    Moreover, the level of scrutiny should increase in direct\n\nproportion to the number of lawyers employed.                      Despite these\n\nconcerns, however, three things make us reluctant to interfere\n\nwith the trial court's considered judgment in the peculiar\n\ncircumstances of this case.\n\n           First, the trial judge had the best coign of vantage.\n\nHe was uniquely positioned to weigh the parties' staffing needs,\n\nassess the reasonableness of their handling of the case, and\n\nevaluate the quality and relevance of the services rendered.\n\nSecond, the judge explained his reasoning for allowing fees for\n\nmultiple attorneys in meticulous detail.                  Third, the attorneys'\n\nproffer    to     the    district   court    persuasively        described    their\n\ndivision     of      responsibility      and    their     need    for   teamwork.\n\nConsidering these and other factors, we conclude — although the\n\nquestion is close — that the court below did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion      in      determining   that     it   was    reasonable    for    the\n\nplaintiffs      to    have   entrusted    the    Regulation      29   claim    to   a\n\nquartet of attorneys.\n\n           4.      Overlapping Issues.          When a plaintiff prevails on\n\nsome, but not all, of multiple claims, a fee reduction may be in\n\norder.    Hensley, 461 U.S. at 434-35; Coutin, 124 F.3d at 339-40.\n\nIn such a situation, the court must filter out the time spent on\n\n\n                                      -21-\n\funsuccessful claims and award the prevailing party fees related\n\nsolely to time spent litigating the winning claim(s).7           Hensley,\n\n461 U.S. at 435.         On appeal, the Commonwealth assails the\n\ndistrict court's handling of the time spent by the various\n\nattorneys on overlapping matters, i.e., issues involving both\n\nRegulation 29 and other claims on which the plaintiffs did not\n\ntriumph.    The Commonwealth's most powerful argument highlights\n\na patent inconsistency in the trial court's otherwise exemplary\n\nrescript.    We trace the origins of this inconsistency.\n\n            In this case, the plaintiffs, mindful of the Hensley\n\nCourt's    directive    that    \"[c]ounsel   for   the   prevailing   party\n\nshould make a good-faith effort to exclude from a fee request\n\nhours that are excessive, redundant, or otherwise unnecessary,\"\n\n461 U.S. at 434, limited their application to time spent on\n\ntheir one winning claim, allocating to that quest a portion of\n\nthe hours spent on overlapping matters.             In scrutinizing the\n\nplaintiffs' submissions, the district court noted the way in\n\nwhich their attorneys had handled the vexing problem of how to\n\naccount    for   time   spent   on   overlapping    claims.    The    court\n\n\n\n    7Of course, a prevailing party sometimes can avoid this sort\nof reconstructive surgery by a showing that the work done on\nunsuccessful claims was inextricably intertwined with the work\ndone on successful claims.    See Lipsett, 975 F.2d at 940-41;\nAubin, 782 F.2d at 291. Here, however, the plaintiffs do not\nargue interconnectedness.\n\n                                     -22-\n\fcommended the methodology employed, declared that twenty-five\n\npercent    of        the    overlapping      time   constituted      a   reasonable\n\nallocation for the Regulation 29 claim, and proceeded to fashion\n\nthe fee award (with other changes, as described supra).\n\n               The     fly      in    the   ointment    is    that   the    court's\n\ncomputations did not track its statements:                      while the court\n\nawarded only twenty-five percent of the \"overlapping\" hours\n\nspent     by    two        of   the    attorneys    (Berkan    and   Meenan),    it\n\ninadvertently awarded eighty percent of the \"overlapping\" time\n\nspent by the other two lawyers (Harlow and Goldberg).                       Because\n\nthe court, to that extent, abandoned sub silentio its announced\n\ntwenty-five percent formula, we think that a correction should\n\nbe made.\n\n               We have several options at this point.                We could, of\n\ncourse, remand for a new calculation.                  E.g., Coutin, 124 F.3d at\n\n342.    But remand is not obligatory, e.g., Lipsett, 975 F.2d at\n\n943, and the court below was clear as to what it intended.\n\nBecause the record is sufficiently explicit that we can perform\n\nthe necessary calculations and implement the district court's\n\nstated plan, it would be wasteful to remand and invite a new\n\nround of litigation.                  Cf. Hensley, 461 U.S. at 437 (warning\n\ncourts against turning fee applications into major satellite\n\nlitigation).          Thus, we forgo a remand and reduce Harlow's and\n\n\n                                            -23-\n\fGoldberg's hours to include only twenty-five percent of the time\n\nspent by each of them on overlapping matters.\n\n          The majority of Harlow's allowed time — 116.5 hours —\n\nfell into this category.          She included eighty percent of this\n\ntime in her calculations.           The district court adopted this\n\nfigure.   We enforce the court's twenty-five percent limitation\n\nby trimming that number from 93.2 hours to 29.125 hours.                  The\n\nnet effect of this reduction is to decrease the overall award in\n\nregard to Harlow's services from $29,628 to $14,250.\n\n          We follow the same approach vis-à-vis Goldberg.                 She\n\nspent 183.75 hours on overlapping matters, and included 147 of\n\nthose hours in her materials.          The court adopted that figure.\n\nWe   enforce    the   court's     twenty-five      percent   limitation    by\n\nlowering that number to 45.9375 hours.             The net effect of this\n\nreduction is to shrink the overall award in regard to Goldberg's\n\nservices from $100,020 to $75,765.\n\nV.   CONCLUSION\n\n          To recapitulate, the district court labored over the\n\nunderlying     litigation   for    nearly   five    years.    At   the   fee-\n\nshifting stage, the court issued a twenty-page opinion in which\n\nit supportably determined that the plaintiffs had prevailed on\n\na significant aspect of their case.             In the same opinion, the\n\ncourt closely evaluated each attorney's submission under the\n\n\n                                    -24-\n\fappropriate legal standards.                For the most part, the court's\n\nreasoning is unimpugnable.           We therefore affirm the award, save\n\nonly for a reduction to reflect accurately the court's sensible\n\n(but not fully implemented) determination that the plaintiffs\n\nshould recover for no more than twenty-five percent of the time\n\nthat their attorneys spent on overlapping matters.\n\n             We need go no further.           Although the fee award, even\n\nas we have pared it, seems quite generous, its size is dictated\n\nin   large   part     by    the   tenacity    with    which     the   Commonwealth\n\ndefended Regulation 29.              Cf. Galicians 6:7 (observing that\n\n\"whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap\").                     Under the\n\ncircumstances, we scarcely can criticize the district court for\n\ndetermining, in effect, that the plaintiffs were justified in\n\nfighting fire with fire.\n\n             The     fee    award    is     reduced    from      $202,733.86    to\n\n$163,100.86        and,    as   modified,    the   award   is    affirmed.     The\n\nexpense award in the amount of $13,787.40 is likewise affirmed.\n\nInterest shall accrue on these sums as provided by 28 U.S.C. §\n\n1961.   No fees or costs shall be awarded for services rendered\n\nin connection with this appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -25-\n\f",

The Commonwealth appeals. Concluding, as we do, that the district court acted within its discretion in determining that the plaintiffs were prevailing parties with respect to a discrete claim in the underlying litigation, we affirm the finding that they were entitled to a fee award. Withal, we reduce the amount by nearly $40,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 19, 1995, the plaintiffs sued the Commonwealth for damages and equitable relief.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Invoking 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1983, they alleged, inter alia, that the Commonwealth violated their constitutional rights by (1) forbidding them from participating in an impromptu rally, (2) subjecting them to excessive force, (3) conducting an unlawful search of a gay bar, and (4) illegally videotaping a \"Gay Pride\" parade. Following a year of procedural wrangling and increasingly acrimonious discovery disputes, the plaintiffs amended their complaint to include, among other things, a claim that Regulation 29 - a police department regulation which made \"associat[ing] with . . . homosexuals\" violative of the code of conduct and exposed violators to official discipline - impugned the plaintiffs' First Amendment rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, the district court (a) granted summary judgment in the Commonwealth's favor as to all claims anent the rally, the use of force, the search, and the videotaping; (b) left for trial certain (subsequently settled) claims against individual officers; and (c) entered a judgment declaring Regulation 29 unconstitutional. The last ruling is the focal point of this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commonwealth did not take the court's repudiation of Regulation 29 lightly. It filed a detailed motion to alter or amend the judgment. The district court stood firm. At that point, the Commonwealth, instead of throwing in the towel, decided to rewrite Regulation 29. The revised regulation no longer singled out homosexuals in haec verba, but, rather, paved the way for disciplinary action against officers who \"relate to or associate with persons of dubious reputation\" (a group defined to include \"anyone who engages in conduct that departs from the community's moral standards\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the parties filed extensive briefs, the court rejected the revised regulation as an exercise in \"crafty drafting\" and a thinly- veiled effort to do by indirection what the court had prohibited the PRPD from doing directly. To insure against any future evasions, the court permanently enjoined the Commonwealth from punishing any police officer for associating with homosexuals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still unrepentant, the Commonwealth moved to vacate the injunction. After briefing and argument, the court demurred. This resolved the matter, as the Commonwealth chose not to appeal. The district court's decision on the merits thus ripened into a final judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs thereafter petitioned for $209,122.67 in attorneys' fees and $21,294.92 in expenses. They accompanied the application with their attorneys' sworn statements, information concerning the attorneys' credentials, and a recasted version of the attorneys' contemporaneous billing records (which separated the work related to the extirpation of Regulation 29 from other work performed). The Commonwealth filed an opposition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taking up the question, the district court first ruled that the plaintiffs were prevailing parties. It next scrutinized each attorney's hours and, notwithstanding the lawyers' assurances that they had eliminated all time spent on unrelated issues, subtracted some additional hours. The court then adjusted the attorneys' customary billing rates to reflect local stipends for comparably qualified counsel and trimmed (or in some instances disallowed) various expense items. When all was said and done, the court determined that the plaintiffs deserved legal fees in the amount of $202,733.86, allocated as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Attorney Judith Berkan - 93.1325 hours at $240 per hour and 1.112 hours at $265 per hour, for a total of $22,646.48.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Attorney Suzanne B. Goldberg - 416.75 hours at $240 per hour, for a total of $100,020.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Attorney Ruth E. Harlow - 123.45 hours at $240 per hour, for a total of $29,628.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. Attorney Colleen M. Meenan - 224.175 hours at $225 per hour, for a total of $50,439.38.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court also awarded the plaintiffs a total of $13,787.40 in expenses. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We divide our ensuing discussion into three segments, one dealing with the standard of appellate review, the second with the plaintiffs' eligibility for a fee award, and the third with the dollars involved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. THE STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In appeals involving the Fees Act, 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1988, a reviewing court customarily defers to the trial judge, whose intimate knowledge of the nuances of the underlying case uniquely positions him to construct a condign award. See Coutin v. Young &amp; Rubicam, Inc., 124 F.3d 331, 336 (1st Cir. 1997); Lipsett v. Blanco, 975 F.2d 934, 937 (1st Cir. 1992). Accordingly, our review here is for manifest abuse of discretion. E.g., Foley v. City of Lowell, 948 F.2d 10, 18 (1st Cir. 1991). Apart from mistakes of law - which always constitute abuses of a court's discretion, see United States v. Snyder, 136 F.3d 65, 67 (1st Cir. 1998) - we will set aside a fee award only if it clearly appears that the trial court ignored a factor deserving significant weight, relied upon an improper factor, or evaluated all the proper factors (and no improper ones), but made a serious mistake in weighing them. See Foster v. Mydas Assoc., Inc., 943 F.2d 139, 143 (1st Cir. 1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. THE FACT OF THE AWARD</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commonwealth's attack on the fact of the award hinges on its contention that the plaintiffs were not prevailing parties in the underlying litigation (and, thus, not entitled to recoup fees and expenses at all). The district court rejected this contention, and so do we.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the so-called \"American Rule,\" litigants generally pay their own way. Alyeska Pipeline Serv. Co. v. Wilderness Soc'y, 421 U.S. 240, 247 (1975). Sometimes, however, Congress provides otherwise. The Fees Act, 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1988, constitutes such a proviso. In regard to cases brought under the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1983, the Fees Act states in pertinent part that \"the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1988(b). Although this fee-shifting provision is couched in permissive terminology, awards in favor of prevailing civil rights plaintiffs are virtually obligatory. See Stanton v. S. Berkshire Reg'l Sch. Dist., 197 F.3d 574, 576 (1st Cir. 1999) (explaining that the Supreme Court has interpreted section 1988 to require fees in favor of prevailing civil rights plaintiffs \"save for rare cases\"); Casa Marie Hogar Geriatrico, Inc. v. Rivera-Santos, 38 F.3d 615, 618 (1st Cir. 1994) (noting that prevailing civil rights plaintiffs are presumptively entitled to fee awards); see also Blanchard v. Bergeron, 489 U.S. 87, 89 n.1 (1989). The threshold question, then, is whether the plaintiffs are prevailing parties within the purview of the Fees Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Typically, achieving prevailing party status requires a plaintiff to show that he succeeded on an important issue in the case, thereby gaining at least some of the benefit he sought in bringing suit. Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 433 (1983); Nadeau v. Helgemoe, 581 F.2d 275, 278-79 (1st Cir. 1978). Put another way, \"a plaintiff 'prevails' when actual relief on the merits of his claim materially alters the legal relationship between the parties by modifying the defendant's behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff.\" Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S. 103, 111-12 (1992); accord Tex. State Teachers Ass'n v. Garland Indep. Sch. Dist., 489 U.S. 782, 791-92 (1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the plaintiffs \"prevailed\" in the sense that they secured declaratory and injunctive relief in their facial challenge to the constitutionality of Regulation 29. But obtaining equitable relief does not automatically confer prevailing party status for purposes of the Fees Act. See Tex. State Teachers, 489 U.S. at 792-93; Rhodes v. Stewart, 488 U.S. 1, 3-4 (1988) (per curiam). An inquiring court always must make a qualitative inquiry into the import of the relief obtained, and the Commonwealth posits that the relief obtained here was so trivial that the plaintiffs cannot be deemed prevailing parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Insofar as this argument attempts to bundle the plaintiffs' Regulation 29 claim with their other (generally unsuccessful) claims, it lacks force. \"[T]he degree of the plaintiff's success in relation to the other goals of the lawsuit is a factor critical to the determination of the size of a reasonable fee, not to eligibility for a fee award at all.\" Tex. State Teachers, 489 U.S. at 790 (emphasis omitted). Since the plaintiffs' effort to nullify Regulation 29 constituted a discrete claim within a larger case, our focus must not be on who won more claims, but on how the parties fared with respect to the Regulation 29 claim. If the plaintiffs' success on that discrete claim represented a meaningful victory, they are prevailing parties. Id. at 789-92; Hensley, 461 U.S. at 434-35. If, however, the plaintiffs' success on that claim was \"purely technical or de minimis,\" a court would be well within its rights to deny prevailing party status. Tex. State Teachers, 489 U.S. at 792 (dictum). \"Of itself, the moral satisfaction that results from any favorable statement of law cannot bestow prevailing party status.\" Farrar, 506 U.S. at 112 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to this analysis, the Commonwealth asseverates that the plaintiffs are not prevailing parties with respect to their Regulation 29 claim because the regulation was an anachronism which the PRPD never enforced and, in fact, had intended to scrap long before the plaintiffs sought a judicial anodyne. This asseveration rests on the premise that winning an injunction against the enforcement of a moribund statute or regulation ordinarily is not enough to transform a plaintiff into a prevailing party. See id. We agree with that premise as an abstract statement of the law, but it has no application here for at least two reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the PRPD never publicly repudiated the regulation before the plaintiffs challenged it, and the record contains evidence, credited by the district court, of its chilling effect on First Amendment rights.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Thus, even if the PRPD harbored an unexpressed intention not to enforce Regulation 29, neither gay officers nor gay civilians who wished to associate with police officers would have had any way to know of that intention. By convincing the court to strike the regulation down, therefore, the plaintiffs at the very least dispelled a pall that burdened associational rights. Cf. NAACP v. Ala. ex rel. Patterson, 357 U.S. 449, 461-62 (1958) (discussing government activity that unconstitutionally discouraged individuals or groups from exercising freedom of association). Viewed from that perspective, the plaintiffs' decision to litigate the validity of Regulation 29, and the results that they obtained in that endeavor, accomplished something worthwhile.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second - and perhaps more salient - the record does not support the Commonwealth's self-serving protestation that, even before the plaintiffs sued, Regulation 29 was a dead letter. From the moment that the plaintiffs called the constitutionality of Regulation 29 into question, the Commonwealth vigorously defended it. Instead of disowning the regulation or announcing that it had outlived its usefulness, the Commonwealth stridently opposed the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment. When the court deemed the regulation unconstitutional, the Commonwealth did not acquiesce, but, rather, fought tooth and nail to reverse that decision. Even after the court declined to alter or amend the declaration of invalidity, the Commonwealth refused to abandon the regulation, preferring to tinker with its text in a benighted attempt to evade the thrust of the court's ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is trite, but true, that actions often speak louder than words. So it is here. The Commonwealth's course of conduct convincingly contradicts its current claim that Regulation 29 was an anachronism which the PRPD long had intended to rescind.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, the question of whether or not obtaining equitable relief is sufficiently meaningful to warrant prevailing party status is case-specific. In this instance, the record amply supports the district court's finding that Regulation 29 was extant when the plaintiffs took up the cudgels against it. Consequently, striking the regulation down achieved one of the plaintiffs' preeminent goals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If more were needed - and we do not believe that it is - the Fees Act was intended to encourage citizens to vindicate rights that concern the public as a whole. See City of Riverside v. Rivera, 477 U.S. 561, 574-75 (1986). This suit is a paradigmatic example of the kind of case that Congress had in mind when it enacted section 1988. See Aubin v. Fudala, 782 F.2d 287, 290-91 (1st Cir. 1986) (explaining that declaratory judgments can further the policies behind the Fees Act). The court's declaration that Regulation 29 was unconstitutional clearly benefitted both the plaintiffs and the public as a whole. Writing off the plaintiffs' victory as de minimis would ignore that reality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will not paint the lily. While many of the plaintiffs' other claims failed, the nisi prius court conclusively determined that Regulation 29 violated their First Amendment rights. That decision settled a significant issue whose resolution benefitted the plaintiffs and the public. Given this predicate, the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the plaintiffs were prevailing parties for purposes of the discrete Regulation 29 claim. A fee award therefore was due.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. THE AMOUNT OF THE AWARD</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second wave of the Commonwealth's offensive targets the amount of the fee award.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Even if the plaintiffs are prevailing parties, the Commonwealth says, the award should be reduced because, among other things, it is disproportionately large; the plaintiffs failed to produce adequate records documenting their attorneys' time; the case was staffed too densely; and the court was overly generous in its treatment of overlapping issues. We turn first to the anatomy of the award, and then examine the Commonwealth's contentions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. The Anatomy of the Award.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under most federal fee-shifting statutes, including the Fees Act, the trial judge must determine \"the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate.\" Hensley, 461 U.S. at 433. In implementing this lodestar approach, the judge calculates the time counsel spent on the case, subtracts duplicative, unproductive, or excessive hours, and then applies prevailing rates in the community (taking into account the qualifications, experience, and specialized competence of the attorneys involved). Lipsett, 975 F.2d at 937; United States v. Metro. Dist. Comm'n, 847 F.2d 12, 15-17 (1st Cir. 1988); Grendel's Den, Inc. v. Larkin, 749 F.2d 945, 950-51 (1st Cir. 1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fashioning fee awards, the attorneys' contemporaneous billing records constitute the usual starting point, but the court's discretion is by no means shackled by those records. For example, it is the court's prerogative (indeed, its duty) to winnow out excessive hours, time spent tilting at windmills, and the like. Coutin, 124 F.3d at 337. By the same token, the court may take guidance from, but is not bound by, an attorney's standard billing rate. See Brewster v. Dukakis, 3 F.3d 488, 492-93 (1st Cir. 1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chief Judge Laffitte followed this procedure. He started with the time compilations submitted by the plaintiffs' lawyers. Despite the attorneys' representations that the compilations only included time spent in connection with their efforts to prove the infirmity of Regulation 29, the court sharply reduced the number of hours claimed for researching this issue prior to June 19, 1995 (the date on which the plaintiffs filed the original complaint that contained no mention of Regulation 29).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Turning to the other side of the grid, the court ratcheted some of the billing rates downward to correspond more closely with local standards. See Adcock-Ladd v. Sec'y of Treas., 227 F.3d 343, 350 (6th Cir. 2000) (holding that reasonable hourly rates should be set by reference to rates in the court's vicinage rather than in the lawyer's region of origin). The court then multiplied the adjusted hours by the adjusted rates to ascertain fees attributable to the work of each of the four attorneys, aggregating those four figures to arrive at the amount of the award.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. The Commonwealth's Rejoinder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We address the Commonwealth's main arguments seriatim. Its other points are insufficiently developed, patently wrong, or both. We reject them without editorial comment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Proportionality. We need not tarry over the Commonwealth's assertion that the award is disproportionate to the degree of the plaintiffs' success. While degree of success is critical in determining the amount of a fee award, Tex. State Teachers, 489 U.S. at 790, proportionality is no longer an issue once the prevailing party has separated the wheat from the chaff (i.e., isolated the time spent on her successful claim or claims). See Hensley, 461 U.S. at 434-35. Because the plaintiffs here have limited their fee petition to the solitary claim on which they prevailed completely, proportionality is no longer critical.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> See City of Riverside, 477 U.S. at 574. The real question is to what extent the method of calculation, the claimed hours and rates, and the associated documentation project a reasonable fee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Time Records. The Commonwealth next complains that the very basis of the lower court's calculation is faulty because the plaintiffs neglected to produce contemporaneous time records. Without drawing our attention to any specific deficiencies in the records presented, the Commonwealth argues that the lower court erroneously accepted \"shorthand summary compilations.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts are these. The plaintiffs provided the district court with four accounts - one for each lawyer - that synthesized, excerpted, and reproduced entries from the lawyers' original time sheets. The plaintiffs followed this praxis in an apparent effort both to segregate time spent on unsuccessful, unrelated claims and to create a more intelligible format for judicial consideration of their requests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court welcomed these submissions and elected not to require the plaintiffs to produce the original time sheets. We discern no error. Our cases make clear that prevailing parties who intend to seek counsel fee awards ordinarily must ensure that contemporaneous time records are kept in reasonable detail. E.g., Lipsett, 975 F.2d at 938; Grendel's Den, 749 F.2d at 952. These precedents warn that failure to do so may have deleterious consequences (such as the slashing or disallowance of an award). Lipsett, 975 F.2d at 938; Grendel's Den, 749 F.2d at 952. Here, however, the plaintiffs satisfied that obligation: each of the four attorneys filed an affidavit attesting that she kept contemporaneous time records. The fact that counsel, in helping to prepare the fee application, transcribed the notations on their time sheets verbatim and, for ease in reference, incorporated the transcriptions in compilations, did not compromise the integrity of their billing records. After all, the compilations simplified matters and enabled the lower court more easily to assess the merits of the parties' conflicting contentions. If the Commonwealth doubted whether the compilations faithfully tracked the time sheets, it could have filed a discovery request for the original records. Having eschewed that course, it cannot now be heard to complain that the judge, who expressed satisfaction with the accuracy and adequacy of the plaintiffs' proffer, did not demand to see the raw data.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Overstaffing. The Commonwealth maintains that the plaintiffs overstaffed the litigation, drawing on a battery of lawyers when one would have sufficed. Such a claim brings certain general rules into play. We briefly rehearse those rules.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the one hand, awards under the Fees Act are not intended \"to serve as full employment or continuing education programs for lawyers and paralegals.\" Lipsett, 975 F.2d at 938. In that spirit, a court should not hesitate to discount hours if it sees signs that a prevailing party has overstaffed a case. See Hart v. Bourque, 798 F.2d 519, 523 (1st Cir. 1986). On the other hand, courts must be careful not to throw out the baby with the bath water. Given the complexity of modern litigation, the deployment of multiple attorneys is sometimes an eminently reasonable tactic. Consequently, the mere fact that more than one lawyer toils on the same general task does not necessarily constitute excessive staffing. Rodriguez-Hernandez v. Miranda-Velez, 132 F.3d 848, 860 (1st Cir. 1998). Effective preparation and presentation of a case often involve the kind of collaboration that only occurs when several attorneys are working on a single issue. Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commonwealth argues that the central legal question here - the constitutionality of Regulation 29 - was pedestrian, and that the engagement of multiple counsel therefore was unwarranted. But it is too much of a stretch to say that the First Amendment issue here was, in the Commonwealth's pat phrase, \"simple and straightforward.\" The Commonwealth's conclusion seems particularly dubious when one factors into the mix the ancillary issue of standing (a knotty problem, on these facts). See supra note 5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ferocity of the Commonwealth's defense likewise undermines its assertion that the plaintiffs did not need to call up the reserves in order to litigate the Regulation 29 issue. Although the Commonwealth now claims that it never particularly cared about the fate of the supposedly unused regulation, it certainly did not display any such indifference in the district court. To the contrary, it mounted a Stalingrad defense of Regulation 29, battling from rock to rock and tree to tree. After setting such a militant tone and forcing the plaintiffs to respond in kind, it seems disingenuous for the Commonwealth to castigate the plaintiffs for putting too many troops into the field. Cf. City of Riverside, 477 U.S. at 581 n.11 (\"The government cannot litigate tenaciously and then be heard to complain about the time necessarily spent by the plaintiff in response.\") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even so, we remain skeptical about the use of four attorneys to litigate a single claim - particularly a claim that did not necessitate a trial. Where tag teams of attorneys are involved, fee applications should be scrutinized with especial care. Moreover, the level of scrutiny should increase in direct proportion to the number of lawyers employed. Despite these concerns, however, three things make us reluctant to interfere with the trial court's considered judgment in the peculiar circumstances of this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the trial judge had the best coign of vantage. He was uniquely positioned to weigh the parties' staffing needs, assess the reasonableness of their handling of the case, and evaluate the quality and relevance of the services rendered. Second, the judge explained his reasoning for allowing fees for multiple attorneys in meticulous detail. Third, the attorneys' proffer to the district court persuasively described their division of responsibility and their need for teamwork. Considering these and other factors, we conclude - although the question is close - that the court below did not abuse its discretion in determining that it was reasonable for the plaintiffs to have entrusted the Regulation 29 claim to a quartet of attorneys.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. Overlapping Issues. When a plaintiff prevails on some, but not all, of multiple claims, a fee reduction may be in order. Hensley, 461 U.S. at 434-35; Coutin, 124 F.3d at 339-40. In such a situation, the court must filter out the time spent on unsuccessful claims and award the prevailing party fees related solely to time spent litigating the winning claim(s).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Hensley, 461 U.S. at 435. On appeal, the Commonwealth assails the district court's handling of the time spent by the various attorneys on overlapping matters, i.e., issues involving both Regulation 29 and other claims on which the plaintiffs did not triumph. The Commonwealth's most powerful argument highlights a patent inconsistency in the trial court's otherwise exemplary rescript. We trace the origins of this inconsistency.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the plaintiffs, mindful of the Hensley Court's directive that \"[c]counsel for the prevailing party should make a good-faith effort to exclude from a fee request hours that are excessive, redundant, or otherwise unnecessary,\" 461 U.S. at 434, limited their application to time spent on their one winning claim, allocating to that quest a portion of the hours spent on overlapping matters. In scrutinizing the plaintiffs' submissions, the district court noted the way in which their attorneys had handled the vexing problem of how to account for time spent on overlapping claims. The court commended the methodology employed, declared that twenty-five percent of the overlapping time constituted a reasonable allocation for the Regulation 29 claim, and proceeded to fashion the fee award (with other changes, as described supra).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fly in the ointment is that the court's computations did not track its statements: while the court awarded only twenty-five percent of the \"overlapping\" hours spent by two of the attorneys (Berkan and Meenan), it inadvertently awarded eighty percent of the \"overlapping\" time spent by the other two lawyers (Harlow and Goldberg). Because the court, to that extent, abandoned sub silentio its announced twenty-five percent formula, we think that a correction should be made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have several options at this point. We could, of course, remand for a new calculation. E.g., Coutin, 124 F.3d at 342. But remand is not obligatory, e.g., Lipsett, 975 F.2d at 943, and the court below was clear as to what it intended. Because the record is sufficiently explicit that we can perform the necessary calculations and implement the district court's stated plan, it would be wasteful to remand and invite a new round of litigation. Cf. Hensley, 461 U.S. at 437 (warning courts against turning fee applications into major satellite litigation). Thus, we forgo a remand and reduce Harlow's and Goldberg's hours to include only twenty-five percent of the time spent by each of them on overlapping matters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority of Harlow's allowed time - 116.5 hours - fell into this category. She included eighty percent of this time in her calculations. The district court adopted this figure. We enforce the court's twenty-five percent limitation by trimming that number from 93.2 hours to 29.125 hours. The net effect of this reduction is to decrease the overall award in regard to Harlow's services from $29,628 to $14,250.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We follow the same approach vis-a-vis Goldberg. She spent 183.75 hours on overlapping matters, and included 147 of those hours in her materials. The court adopted that figure. We enforce the court's twenty-five percent limitation by lowering that number to 45.9375 hours. The net effect of this reduction is to shrink the overall award in regard to Goldberg's services from $100,020 to $75,765.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To recapitulate, the district court labored over the underlying litigation for nearly five years. At the fee-shifting stage, the court issued a twenty-page opinion in which it supportably determined that the plaintiffs had prevailed on a significant aspect of their case. In the same opinion, the court closely evaluated each attorney's submission under the appropriate legal standards. For the most part, the court's reasoning is unimpugnable. We therefore affirm the award, save only for a reduction to reflect accurately the court's sensible (but not fully implemented) determination that the plaintiffs should recover for no more than twenty-five percent of the time that their attorneys spent on overlapping matters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. Although the fee award, even as we have pared it, seems quite generous, its size is dictated in large part by the tenacity with which the Commonwealth defended Regulation 29. Cf. Galicians 6:7 (observing that \"whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap\"). Under the circumstances, we scarcely can criticize the district court for determining, in effect, that the plaintiffs were justified in fighting fire with fire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fee award is reduced from $202,733.86 to $163,100.86 and, as modified, the award is affirmed. The expense award in the amount of $13,787.40 is likewise affirmed. Interest shall accrue on these sums as provided by 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1961. No fees or costs shall be awarded for services rendered in connection with this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> GOAL is a nonprofit organization comprising police officers dedicated to protecting the rights of gays and lesbians.

The Commonwealth does not seriously challenge this finding and, in all events, the finding seems unassailable. See Aubin, 782 F.2d at 291 (explaining that plaintiffs are entitled not only to fees for work done on winning claims but also for work done on other claims involving \"a common core of facts\" or \"related legal theories\") (quoting Hensley, 461 U.S. at 435).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> This is not to say that proportionality may not, in some circumstances, bear upon the amount of an award. E.g., Farrar, 506 U.S. at 113-16. Here, however, we already have determined that the plaintiffs won a total and significant victory vis-aa-vis Regulation 29. See supra Part III. Proportionality is therefore not a material issue at this stage of the case.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Of course, a prevailing party sometimes can avoid this sort of reconstructive surgery by a showing that the work done on unsuccessful claims was inextricably intertwined with the work done on successful claims.

The Commonwealth appeals. Concluding, as we do, that the district court acted within its discretion in determining that the plaintiffs were prevailing parties with respect to a discrete claim in the underlying litigation, we affirm the finding that they were entitled to a fee award. Withal, we reduce the amount by nearly $40,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 19, 1995, the plaintiffs sued the Commonwealth for damages and equitable relief.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Invoking 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1983, they alleged, inter alia, that the Commonwealth violated their constitutional rights by (1) forbidding them from participating in an impromptu rally, (2) subjecting them to excessive force, (3) conducting an unlawful search of a gay bar, and (4) illegally videotaping a \"Gay Pride\" parade. Following a year of procedural wrangling and increasingly acrimonious discovery disputes, the plaintiffs amended their complaint to include, among other things, a claim that Regulation 29 - a police department regulation which made \"associat[ing] with . . . homosexuals\" violative of the code of conduct and exposed violators to official discipline - impugned the plaintiffs' First Amendment rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, the district court (a) granted summary judgment in the Commonwealth's favor as to all claims anent the rally, the use of force, the search, and the videotaping; (b) left for trial certain (subsequently settled) claims against individual officers; and (c) entered a judgment declaring Regulation 29 unconstitutional. The last ruling is the focal point of this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commonwealth did not take the court's repudiation of Regulation 29 lightly. It filed a detailed motion to alter or amend the judgment. The district court stood firm. At that point, the Commonwealth, instead of throwing in the towel, decided to rewrite Regulation 29. The revised regulation no longer singled out homosexuals in haec verba, but, rather, paved the way for disciplinary action against officers who \"relate to or associate with persons of dubious reputation\" (a group defined to include \"anyone who engages in conduct that departs from the community's moral standards\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the parties filed extensive briefs, the court rejected the revised regulation as an exercise in \"crafty drafting\" and a thinly- veiled effort to do by indirection what the court had prohibited the PRPD from doing directly. To insure against any future evasions, the court permanently enjoined the Commonwealth from punishing any police officer for associating with homosexuals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still unrepentant, the Commonwealth moved to vacate the injunction. After briefing and argument, the court demurred. This resolved the matter, as the Commonwealth chose not to appeal. The district court's decision on the merits thus ripened into a final judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs thereafter petitioned for $209,122.67 in attorneys' fees and $21,294.92 in expenses. They accompanied the application with their attorneys' sworn statements, information concerning the attorneys' credentials, and a recasted version of the attorneys' contemporaneous billing records (which separated the work related to the extirpation of Regulation 29 from other work performed). The Commonwealth filed an opposition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taking up the question, the district court first ruled that the plaintiffs were prevailing parties. It next scrutinized each attorney's hours and, notwithstanding the lawyers' assurances that they had eliminated all time spent on unrelated issues, subtracted some additional hours. The court then adjusted the attorneys' customary billing rates to reflect local stipends for comparably qualified counsel and trimmed (or in some instances disallowed) various expense items. When all was said and done, the court determined that the plaintiffs deserved legal fees in the amount of $202,733.86, allocated as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.

THE STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In appeals involving the Fees Act, 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1988, a reviewing court customarily defers to the trial judge, whose intimate knowledge of the nuances of the underlying case uniquely positions him to construct a condign award. See Coutin v. Young &amp; Rubicam, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"746216\"><a href=\"/opinion/746216/74-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1463-72-empl-prac-dec-p-45260-denise/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">331</span></a></span>, 336 (1st Cir. 1997); Lipsett v.

Accordingly, our review here is for manifest abuse of discretion. E.g., Foley v. City of Lowell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"571252\"><a href=\"/opinion/571252/michael-j-foley-v-city-of-lowell-massachusetts-michael-j-foley-v-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">948</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span>, 18 (1st Cir. 1991). Apart from mistakes of law - which always constitute abuses of a court's discretion, see United States v. Snyder, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197800\"><a href=\"/opinion/197800/united-states-v-snyder/\"><span class=\"volume\">136</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">65</span></a></span>, 67 (1st Cir. 1998) - we will set aside a fee award only if it clearly appears that the trial court ignored a factor deserving significant weight, relied upon an improper factor, or evaluated all the proper factors (and no improper ones), but made a serious mistake in weighing them. See Foster v. Mydas Assoc., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"567592\"><a href=\"/opinion/567592/darcy-foster-v-mydas-associates-inc-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">943</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">139</span></a></span>, 143 (1st Cir. 1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. THE FACT OF THE AWARD</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commonwealth's attack on the fact of the award hinges on its contention that the plaintiffs were not prevailing parties in the underlying litigation (and, thus, not entitled to recoup fees and expenses at all). The district court rejected this contention, and so do we.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the so-called \"American Rule,\" litigants generally pay their own way. Alyeska Pipeline Serv. Co. v. Wilderness Soc'y, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109246\"><a href=\"/opinion/109246/alyeska-pipeline-service-co-v-wilderness-society/\"><span class=\"volume\">421</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">240</span></a></span>, 247 (1975). Sometimes, however, Congress provides otherwise. The Fees Act, 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1988, constitutes such a proviso. In regard to cases brought under the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1983, the Fees Act states in pertinent part that \"the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1988(b). Although this fee-shifting provision is couched in permissive terminology, awards in favor of prevailing civil rights plaintiffs are virtually obligatory. See Stanton v. S. Berkshire Reg'l Sch.

But obtaining equitable relief does not automatically confer prevailing party status for purposes of the Fees Act. See Tex. State Teachers, 489 U.S. at 792-93; Rhodes v.

An inquiring court always must make a qualitative inquiry into the import of the relief obtained, and the Commonwealth posits that the relief obtained here was so trivial that the plaintiffs cannot be deemed prevailing parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Insofar as this argument attempts to bundle the plaintiffs' Regulation 29 claim with their other (generally unsuccessful) claims, it lacks force. \"[T]he degree of the plaintiff's success in relation to the other goals of the lawsuit is a factor critical to the determination of the size of a reasonable fee, not to eligibility for a fee award at all.\" Tex. State Teachers, 489 U.S. at 790 (emphasis omitted). Since the plaintiffs' effort to nullify Regulation 29 constituted a discrete claim within a larger case, our focus must not be on who won more claims, but on how the parties fared with respect to the Regulation 29 claim. If the plaintiffs' success on that discrete claim represented a meaningful victory, they are prevailing parties. Id. at 789-92; Hensley, 461 U.S. at 434-35. If, however, the plaintiffs' success on that claim was \"purely technical or de minimis,\" a court would be well within its rights to deny prevailing party status. Tex. State Teachers, 489 U.S. at 792 (dictum). \"Of itself, the moral satisfaction that results from any favorable statement of law cannot bestow prevailing party status.\" Farrar, 506 U.S. at 112 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to this analysis, the Commonwealth asseverates that the plaintiffs are not prevailing parties with respect to their Regulation 29 claim because the regulation was an anachronism which the PRPD never enforced and, in fact, had intended to scrap long before the plaintiffs sought a judicial anodyne. This asseveration rests on the premise that winning an injunction against the enforcement of a moribund statute or regulation ordinarily is not enough to transform a plaintiff into a prevailing party. See id. We agree with that premise as an abstract statement of the law, but it has no application here for at least two reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the PRPD never publicly repudiated the regulation before the plaintiffs challenged it, and the record contains evidence, credited by the district court, of its chilling effect on First Amendment rights.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Thus, even if the PRPD harbored an unexpressed intention not to enforce Regulation 29, neither gay officers nor gay civilians who wished to associate with police officers would have had any way to know of that intention. By convincing the court to strike the regulation down, therefore, the plaintiffs at the very least dispelled a pall that burdened associational rights. Cf. NAACP v. Ala. ex rel. Patterson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105746\"><a href=\"/opinion/105746/naacp-v-alabama-ex-rel-patterson/\"><span class=\"volume\">357</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">449</span></a></span>, 461-62 (1958) (discussing government activity that unconstitutionally discouraged individuals or groups from exercising freedom of association). Viewed from that perspective, the plaintiffs' decision to litigate the validity of Regulation 29, and the results that they obtained in that endeavor, accomplished something worthwhile.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second - and perhaps more salient - the record does not support the Commonwealth's self-serving protestation that, even before the plaintiffs sued, Regulation 29 was a dead letter. From the moment that the plaintiffs called the constitutionality of Regulation 29 into question, the Commonwealth vigorously defended it. Instead of disowning the regulation or announcing that it had outlived its usefulness, the Commonwealth stridently opposed the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment. When the court deemed the regulation unconstitutional, the Commonwealth did not acquiesce, but, rather, fought tooth and nail to reverse that decision. Even after the court declined to alter or amend the declaration of invalidity, the Commonwealth refused to abandon the regulation, preferring to tinker with its text in a benighted attempt to evade the thrust of the court's ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is trite, but true, that actions often speak louder than words. So it is here. The Commonwealth's course of conduct convincingly contradicts its current claim that Regulation 29 was an anachronism which the PRPD long had intended to rescind.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, the question of whether or not obtaining equitable relief is sufficiently meaningful to warrant prevailing party status is case-specific. In this instance, the record amply supports the district court's finding that Regulation 29 was extant when the plaintiffs took up the cudgels against it. Consequently, striking the regulation down achieved one of the plaintiffs' preeminent goals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If more were needed - and we do not believe that it is - the Fees Act was intended to encourage citizens to vindicate rights that concern the public as a whole. See City of Riverside v. Rivera, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111730\"><a href=\"/opinion/111730/riverside-v-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">561</span></a></span>, 574-75 (1986). This suit is a paradigmatic example of the kind of case that Congress had in mind when it enacted section 1988. See Aubin v. Fudala, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"463722\"><a href=\"/opinion/463722/lionel-aubin-v-stanley-fudala/\"><span class=\"volume\">782</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">287</span></a></span>, 290-91 (1st Cir. 1986) (explaining that declaratory judgments can further the policies behind the Fees Act). The court's declaration that Regulation 29 was unconstitutional clearly benefitted both the plaintiffs and the public as a whole. Writing off the plaintiffs' victory as de minimis would ignore that reality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will not paint the lily. While many of the plaintiffs' other claims failed, the nisi prius court conclusively determined that Regulation 29 violated their First Amendment rights. That decision settled a significant issue whose resolution benefitted the plaintiffs and the public. Given this predicate, the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the plaintiffs were prevailing parties for purposes of the discrete Regulation 29 claim. A fee award therefore was due.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV.

In implementing this lodestar approach, the judge calculates the time counsel spent on the case, subtracts duplicative, unproductive, or excessive hours, and then applies prevailing rates in the community (taking into account the qualifications, experience, and specialized competence of the attorneys involved).

For example, it is the court's prerogative (indeed, its duty) to winnow out excessive hours, time spent tilting at windmills, and the like. Coutin, 124 F.3d at 337. By the same token, the court may take guidance from, but is not bound by, an attorney's standard billing rate. See Brewster v. Dukakis, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194891\"><a href=\"/opinion/194891/brewster-v-dukakis/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">488</span></a></span>, 492-93 (1st Cir. 1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chief Judge Laffitte followed this procedure. He started with the time compilations submitted by the plaintiffs' lawyers. Despite the attorneys' representations that the compilations only included time spent in connection with their efforts to prove the infirmity of Regulation 29, the court sharply reduced the number of hours claimed for researching this issue prior to June 19, 1995 (the date on which the plaintiffs filed the original complaint that contained no mention of Regulation 29).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Turning to the other side of the grid, the court ratcheted some of the billing rates downward to correspond more closely with local standards.

The court then multiplied the adjusted hours by the adjusted rates to ascertain fees attributable to the work of each of the four attorneys, aggregating those four figures to arrive at the amount of the award.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. The Commonwealth's Rejoinder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We address the Commonwealth's main arguments seriatim.

We reject them without editorial comment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Proportionality. We need not tarry over the Commonwealth's assertion that the award is disproportionate to the degree of the plaintiffs' success. While degree of success is critical in determining the amount of a fee award, Tex. State Teachers, 489 U.S. at 790, proportionality is no longer an issue once the prevailing party has separated the wheat from the chaff (i.e., isolated the time spent on her successful claim or claims). See Hensley, 461 U.S. at 434-35. Because the plaintiffs here have limited their fee petition to the solitary claim on which they prevailed completely, proportionality is no longer critical.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> See City of Riverside, 477 U.S. at 574. The real question is to what extent the method of calculation, the claimed hours and rates, and the associated documentation project a reasonable fee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Time Records. The Commonwealth next complains that the very basis of the lower court's calculation is faulty because the plaintiffs neglected to produce contemporaneous time records. Without drawing our attention to any specific deficiencies in the records presented, the Commonwealth argues that the lower court erroneously accepted \"shorthand summary compilations.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts are these. The plaintiffs provided the district court with four accounts - one for each lawyer - that synthesized, excerpted, and reproduced entries from the lawyers' original time sheets. The plaintiffs followed this praxis in an apparent effort both to segregate time spent on unsuccessful, unrelated claims and to create a more intelligible format for judicial consideration of their requests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court welcomed these submissions and elected not to require the plaintiffs to produce the original time sheets. We discern no error. Our cases make clear that prevailing parties who intend to seek counsel fee awards ordinarily must ensure that contemporaneous time records are kept in reasonable detail. E.g., Lipsett, 975 F.2d at 938; Grendel's Den, 749 F.2d at 952. These precedents warn that failure to do so may have deleterious consequences (such as the slashing or disallowance of an award). Lipsett, 975 F.2d at 938; Grendel's Den, 749 F.2d at 952. Here, however, the plaintiffs satisfied that obligation: each of the four attorneys filed an affidavit attesting that she kept contemporaneous time records. The fact that counsel, in helping to prepare the fee application, transcribed the notations on their time sheets verbatim and, for ease in reference, incorporated the transcriptions in compilations, did not compromise the integrity of their billing records. After all, the compilations simplified matters and enabled the lower court more easily to assess the merits of the parties' conflicting contentions. If the Commonwealth doubted whether the compilations faithfully tracked the time sheets, it could have filed a discovery request for the original records. Having eschewed that course, it cannot now be heard to complain that the judge, who expressed satisfaction with the accuracy and adequacy of the plaintiffs' proffer, did not demand to see the raw data.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Overstaffing. The Commonwealth maintains that the plaintiffs overstaffed the litigation, drawing on a battery of lawyers when one would have sufficed. Such a claim brings certain general rules into play. We briefly rehearse those rules.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the one hand, awards under the Fees Act are not intended \"to serve as full employment or continuing education programs for lawyers and paralegals.\" Lipsett, 975 F.2d at 938. In that spirit, a court should not hesitate to discount hours if it sees signs that a prevailing party has overstaffed a case. See Hart v. Bourque, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"474816\"><a href=\"/opinion/474816/jean-hart-as-administratrix-of-the-estate-of-levi-hart-v-richard-w/\"><span class=\"volume\">798</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">519</span></a></span>, 523 (1st Cir. 1986). On the other hand, courts must be careful not to throw out the baby with the bath water. Given the complexity of modern litigation, the deployment of multiple attorneys is sometimes an eminently reasonable tactic. Consequently, the mere fact that more than one lawyer toils on the same general task does not necessarily constitute excessive staffing. Rodriguez-Hernandez v. Miranda-Velez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"749865\"><a href=\"/opinion/749865/75-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1228-73-empl-prac-dec-p-45317-48-fed-r/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">848</span></a></span>, 860 (1st Cir. 1998). Effective preparation and presentation of a case often involve the kind of collaboration that only occurs when several attorneys are working on a single issue. Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commonwealth argues that the central legal question here - the constitutionality of Regulation 29 - was pedestrian, and that the engagement of multiple counsel therefore was unwarranted. But it is too much of a stretch to say that the First Amendment issue here was, in the Commonwealth's pat phrase, \"simple and straightforward.\" The Commonwealth's conclusion seems particularly dubious when one factors into the mix the ancillary issue of standing (a knotty problem, on these facts). See supra note 5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ferocity of the Commonwealth's defense likewise undermines its assertion that the plaintiffs did not need to call up the reserves in order to litigate the Regulation 29 issue. Although the Commonwealth now claims that it never particularly cared about the fate of the supposedly unused regulation, it certainly did not display any such indifference in the district court. To the contrary, it mounted a Stalingrad defense of Regulation 29, battling from rock to rock and tree to tree. After setting such a militant tone and forcing the plaintiffs to respond in kind, it seems disingenuous for the Commonwealth to castigate the plaintiffs for putting too many troops into the field. Cf. City of Riverside, 477 U.S. at 581 n.11 (\"The government cannot litigate tenaciously and then be heard to complain about the time necessarily spent by the plaintiff in response.\") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even so, we remain skeptical about the use of four attorneys to litigate a single claim - particularly a claim that did not necessitate a trial. Where tag teams of attorneys are involved, fee applications should be scrutinized with especial care. Moreover, the level of scrutiny should increase in direct proportion to the number of lawyers employed. Despite these concerns, however, three things make us reluctant to interfere with the trial court's considered judgment in the peculiar circumstances of this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the trial judge had the best coign of vantage. He was uniquely positioned to weigh the parties' staffing needs, assess the reasonableness of their handling of the case, and evaluate the quality and relevance of the services rendered. Second, the judge explained his reasoning for allowing fees for multiple attorneys in meticulous detail. Third, the attorneys' proffer to the district court persuasively described their division of responsibility and their need for teamwork. Considering these and other factors, we conclude - although the question is close - that the court below did not abuse its discretion in determining that it was reasonable for the plaintiffs to have entrusted the Regulation 29 claim to a quartet of attorneys.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. Overlapping Issues. When a plaintiff prevails on some, but not all, of multiple claims, a fee reduction may be in order. Hensley, 461 U.S. at 434-35; Coutin, 124 F.3d at 339-40. In such a situation, the court must filter out the time spent on unsuccessful claims and award the prevailing party fees related solely to time spent litigating the winning claim(s).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Hensley, 461 U.S. at 435. On appeal, the Commonwealth assails the district court's handling of the time spent by the various attorneys on overlapping matters, i.e., issues involving both Regulation 29 and other claims on which the plaintiffs did not triumph. The Commonwealth's most powerful argument highlights a patent inconsistency in the trial court's otherwise exemplary rescript. We trace the origins of this inconsistency.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the plaintiffs, mindful of the Hensley Court's directive that \"[c]counsel for the prevailing party should make a good-faith effort to exclude from a fee request hours that are excessive, redundant, or otherwise unnecessary,\" 461 U.S. at 434, limited their application to time spent on their one winning claim, allocating to that quest a portion of the hours spent on overlapping matters. In scrutinizing the plaintiffs' submissions, the district court noted the way in which their attorneys had handled the vexing problem of how to account for time spent on overlapping claims. The court commended the methodology employed, declared that twenty-five percent of the overlapping time constituted a reasonable allocation for the Regulation 29 claim, and proceeded to fashion the fee award (with other changes, as described supra).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fly in the ointment is that the court's computations did not track its statements: while the court awarded only twenty-five percent of the \"overlapping\" hours spent by two of the attorneys (Berkan and Meenan), it inadvertently awarded eighty percent of the \"overlapping\" time spent by the other two lawyers (Harlow and Goldberg). Because the court, to that extent, abandoned sub silentio its announced twenty-five percent formula, we think that a correction should be made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have several options at this point. We could, of course, remand for a new calculation. E.g., Coutin, 124 F.3d at 342. But remand is not obligatory, e.g., Lipsett, 975 F.2d at 943, and the court below was clear as to what it intended. Because the record is sufficiently explicit that we can perform the necessary calculations and implement the district court's stated plan, it would be wasteful to remand and invite a new round of litigation. Cf. Hensley, 461 U.S. at 437 (warning courts against turning fee applications into major satellite litigation). Thus, we forgo a remand and reduce Harlow's and Goldberg's hours to include only twenty-five percent of the time spent by each of them on overlapping matters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority of Harlow's allowed time - 116.5 hours - fell into this category. She included eighty percent of this time in her calculations. The district court adopted this figure. We enforce the court's twenty-five percent limitation by trimming that number from 93.2 hours to 29.125 hours. The net effect of this reduction is to decrease the overall award in regard to Harlow's services from $29,628 to $14,250.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We follow the same approach vis-a-vis Goldberg. She spent 183.75 hours on overlapping matters, and included 147 of those hours in her materials. The court adopted that figure. We enforce the court's twenty-five percent limitation by lowering that number to 45.9375 hours. The net effect of this reduction is to shrink the overall award in regard to Goldberg's services from $100,020 to $75,765.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To recapitulate, the district court labored over the underlying litigation for nearly five years. At the fee-shifting stage, the court issued a twenty-page opinion in which it supportably determined that the plaintiffs had prevailed on a significant aspect of their case. In the same opinion, the court closely evaluated each attorney's submission under the appropriate legal standards. For the most part, the court's reasoning is unimpugnable. We therefore affirm the award, save only for a reduction to reflect accurately the court's sensible (but not fully implemented) determination that the plaintiffs should recover for no more than twenty-five percent of the time that their attorneys spent on overlapping matters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. Although the fee award, even as we have pared it, seems quite generous, its size is dictated in large part by the tenacity with which the Commonwealth defended Regulation 29. Cf. Galicians 6:7 (observing that \"whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap\"). Under the circumstances, we scarcely can criticize the district court for determining, in effect, that the plaintiffs were justified in fighting fire with fire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fee award is reduced from $202,733.86 to $163,100.86 and, as modified, the award is affirmed. The expense award in the amount of $13,787.40 is likewise affirmed. Interest shall accrue on these sums as provided by 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1961. No fees or costs shall be awarded for services rendered in connection with this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> GOAL is a nonprofit organization comprising police officers dedicated to protecting the rights of gays and lesbians. Hunter and Jeans are members of GOAL and, at the times relevant hereto, were GOAL's principal officers. Ramos Padroo is a lesbian activist resident in Puerto Rico.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The plaintiffs named the superintendent and several members of the Puerto Rico Police Department (PRPD) as additional defendants. Since the presence of these defendants is of marginal relevance for purposes of this appeal, we treat the Commonwealth as if it were the sole defendant.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> For example, GOAL members testified that they felt obliged to arrange clandestine meetings with gay PRPD officers out of concern for the officers' careers.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> On appeal, the Commonwealth does not challenge the expenses awarded by the district court. Consequently, we deem any such challenge waived. See United States v. Zannino, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> The court did, however, find that the work done by the attorneys on standing was interconnected with the Regulation 29 issue, and included the time spent researching that issue. The Commonwealth does not seriously challenge this finding and, in all events, the finding seems unassailable. See Aubin, 782 F.2d at 291 (explaining that plaintiffs are entitled not only to fees for work done on winning claims but also for work done on other claims involving \"a common core of facts\" or \"related legal theories\") (quoting Hensley, 461 U.S. at 435).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> This is not to say that proportionality may not, in some circumstances, bear upon the amount of an award. E.g., Farrar, 506 U.S. at 113-16. Here, however, we already have determined that the plaintiffs won a total and significant victory vis-aa-vis Regulation 29. See supra Part III. Proportionality is therefore not a material issue at this stage of the case.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Of course, a prevailing party sometimes can avoid this sort of reconstructive surgery by a showing that the work done on unsuccessful claims was inextricably intertwined with the work done on successful claims. See Lipsett, 975 F.2d at 940-41; Aubin, 782 F.2d at 291. Here, however, the plaintiffs do not argue interconnectedness.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
