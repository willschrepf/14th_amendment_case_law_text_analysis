BRAXTON\n                               OPINION\n\nWILKINSON, Circuit Judge:\n\n   DeMarcus M. Brown, an inmate incarcerated at Red Onion State\nPrison in Pound, Virginia, was found guilty at a prison disciplinary\nhearing of assaulting a fellow inmate, Johnnie Lee Beavers. The offi-\ncer in charge of the hearing denied Brown’s request to call Beavers\nas a witness, but allowed Brown to submit Beavers’ written statement\nin lieu of live testimony. Brown claims that his inability to present\nBeavers as a live witness denied him due process of law, but we dis-\nagree. Prison officials have the discretion, indeed the duty, to protect\nthe inmates committed to their care. Among other concerns, prison\nauthorities justifiably feared reprisal against Beavers in the event that\nhis testimony was not as Brown hoped, and they were not constitu-\ntionally required to expose Beavers to the threat of a second beating.\nWe therefore affirm the judgment.\n\n                                    I.\n\n   The State of Virginia classifies its correctional facilities at six dif-\nferent levels. Level 1 correctional units provide dormitory-style living\nfor minimum-security inmates convicted of relatively minor offenses.\nBy contrast, Level 5 and 6 prisons house maximum-security inmates\nconvicted of much more serious offenses. Red Onion State Prison,\nwhere Brown and Beavers are incarcerated, is Virginia’s only Level\n6 facility. It provides maximum-security celled living for inmates who\nhave severe behavioral problems; who are serving extremely long\nsentences; or who present escape risks.\n\n   On September 9, 2000, Beavers had completed his duties as an\ninmate recreation worker and was returning to his cell. When Correc-\ntional Officer Samie Fleming opened Beavers’ cell door, Brown fol-\nlowed Beavers inside. Fleming heard slapping and hollering from\ninside the cell, so he closed the cell door and reported an emergency\non the cell intercom. Lieutenant James Robinson, Sergeants Gregory\nDeel and Dwight Moore, and several other correctional officers\nresponded immediately to Fleming’s call. According to Lieutenant\nRobinson, he saw Brown and Beavers fighting on the bottom bunk of\nthe cell. When Brown and Beavers ignored repeated orders to stop\n\f                         BROWN v. BRAXTON                            3\nfighting, the officers entered the cell and separated the pair. Both\nBrown and Beavers were then examined by the prison’s medical staff.\n\n   According to Lieutenant Robinson’s Incident Report, signed and\ndated the day of the fight, the prison nurses who examined Beavers\nfound that his left back tooth had been chipped during the altercation\nand his left wrist had been cut. Beavers also told the nurses, \"I was\nhit with an adapter.\" As for Brown, he sustained a bite mark on his\nright forearm and a few small cuts and abrasions. Brown was later\nplaced in administrative detention, while Lieutenant Kelly Chris\ninvestigated the altercation.\n\n   On September 18, 2000, Brown was served with a copy of Lieuten-\nant Chris’s Disciplinary Offense Report, which stated that Brown was\nbeing charged with aggravated assault. Upon being served, Brown\nrequested that Beavers appear as a witness on his behalf. Then on\nSeptember 22, Beavers submitted to prison officials a written state-\nment that said simply: \"At no time did inmate D. Brown assault me\nwith his adapter or in any other way.\"\n\n   On September 25, 2000, Inmate Hearing Officer Brett Edmonds\nconducted a disciplinary hearing on Brown’s assault charge. Lieuten-\nant Chris testified about Fleming’s report of the fight, as well as the\nnurses’ report on Beavers’ injuries and Beavers’ statement to the\nnurses that he had been hit with an adapter. Chris also testified that\nduring his investigation he had interviewed Beavers. According to\nChris, Beavers said that he and Brown had argued prior to the fight,\nand that later Brown had run into Beavers’ cell and attacked Beavers\nwith an adapter wrapped in a sock. As Chris had noted in his Disci-\nplinary Offense Report, an adapter with Brown’s name and inmate\nnumber was found in Beavers’ cell following the fight. Finally, Chris\ntestified that he had also interviewed Brown, who said that he was in\nBeavers’ cell with the permission of Beavers’ cellmate to watch tele-\nvision. However, Brown denied making such statements to Chris (and\nBeavers’ cellmate denied knowing Brown, much less giving him per-\nmission to watch his television).\n\n   Edmonds then gave Brown an opportunity to present evidence in\nhis defense. Brown requested that Beavers be called as a live witness,\nbut Edmonds denied Brown’s request. Edmonds then read Beavers’\n\f4                        BROWN v. BRAXTON\nwritten statement into the record. Accordingly, Brown argued that he\nshould not be found guilty of assault since Beavers himself denied\nbeing assaulted in any way. When Edmonds asked Brown whether he\nhad anything else to present, Brown said no; he presented no other\nwitnesses or arguments.\n\n   Edmonds proceeded to find Brown guilty of aggravated assault,\nsentencing him to the loss of 180 days of good conduct time. Accord-\ning to Edmonds’ written findings, (1) Brown had been identified by\nOfficer Fleming as the inmate who had entered Beavers’ cell; (2)\nBeavers had sustained injuries consistent with fighting; (3) Beavers\nhad stated to nurses immediately following the fight that he was\nattacked with an adapter; (4) Brown’s adapter was found in Beavers’\ncell after the fight; and (5) when Beavers was subsequently inter-\nviewed by Lieutenant Chris, Beavers confirmed that Brown had\nassaulted him with an adapter.\n\n   Brown presented a host of claims in a state habeas petition to the\nSupreme Court of Virginia. That court dismissed his petition on\nNovember 8, 2001. Brown then reiterated his claims in a habeas peti-\ntion filed in the United States District Court for the Western District\nof Virginia, which also dismissed Brown’s petition on March 19,\n2003. We issued a certificate of appealability on October 24, 2003 to\nconsider whether Brown’s right to due process was violated by\nEdmonds’ refusal to call Beavers as a witness.\n\n                                  II.\n\n   Brown challenges the constitutionality of Virginia Department of\nCorrections Division Operating Procedure (\"DOP\") 861.14(B)(1).\nBrown alleges that Edmonds relied on DOP 861.14(B)(1) in denying\nhis request to call Beavers as a witness. DOP 861.14(B)(1) provides\nthat in all disciplinary hearings for certain types of charged offenses\n\n    [t]he IHO [Inmate Hearing Officer] shall examine each wit-\n    ness’ statement for relevance and repetitiveness. A witness’\n    written statement shall not be used in lieu of the witness’\n    testimony at a Disciplinary Hearing, except at Level 5 and\n    6 institutions and segregation units; the statement from an\n    inmate witness is sufficient. Staff witnesses requested by the\n\f                           BROWN v. BRAXTON                             5\n     inmate should appear at the Disciplinary Hearing at Level\n     5 and 6 institutions and in segregation units.\n\n   DOP 861.14(B)(1) thus regulates the use of witness testimony in\ndisciplinary hearings, and it draws distinctions based upon the type of\ninstitution at which the accused inmate is housed, the type of witness\nsought by the accused inmate, and the type of testimony to be offered\nby the witness. Specifically, DOP 861.14(B)(1) allows inmates at all\nVirginia correctional institutions an unqualified right to call staff wit-\nnesses at disciplinary hearings. However, only inmates at Level 1, 2,\n3 and 4 facilities are guaranteed the right to call willing fellow\ninmates as live witnesses. Prisoners at Level 5 and 6 facilities who\nwish to present testimony from their fellow inmates may be required\nto submit written statements in lieu of live testimony.\n\n                                   A.\n\n   An analysis of the constitutionality of DOP 861.14(B)(1) must\nbegin with the Supreme Court’s seminal case on the due process\nrights of prisoners, Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539 (1974). In\nWolff, the Supreme Court considered how prison disciplinary hearings\nmust be structured in order to comport with the demands of the Due\nProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court was clear\nthat inmates retain rights under the Due Process Clause, but that their\nrights are \"subject to restrictions imposed by the nature of the regime\nto which they have been lawfully committed.\" Wolff, 418 U.S. at 556.\nPrison disciplinary hearings, unlike criminal prosecutions or parole\nrevocation hearings, \"take place in a closed, tightly controlled envi-\nronment peopled by those who have chosen to violate the criminal\nlaw. . . .\" Id. at 561. In many prisons, the inmates can be dangerous\nto each other, and they are confined to a setting that is often rife with\ntension between inmates, guards, and prison officials. Id. at 561-62.\nAs the Court recognized, \"[i]t is against this background that disci-\nplinary proceedings must be structured by prison authorities; and it is\nagainst this background that we must make our constitutional judg-\nments. . . .\" Id. at 562.\n\n   In defining the balance between inmates’ due process interests and\nprison authorities’ penological needs, the Wolff Court drew some firm\nlines. On the one hand, inmates are entitled to advance written notice\n\f6                         BROWN v. BRAXTON\nof the claimed violation, as well as a written statement concerning the\nevidence relied upon and the reasons for the disciplinary action taken.\nId. at 563. On the other hand, inmates are not entitled to confront the\nwitnesses against them, nor are they guaranteed the right to retained\nor appointed counsel. Id. at 567-70; see also Baxter v. Palmigiano,\n425 U.S. 308, 315-22 (1976) (discussing limited range of inmate\nrights in prison disciplinary proceedings).\n\n   But with regard to an inmate’s right to present evidence in his\ndefense, the Court took a more nuanced view. An inmate facing disci-\nplinary proceedings has the qualified right \"to call witnesses and pre-\nsent documentary evidence in his defense when permitting him to do\nso will not be unduly hazardous to institutional safety or correctional\ngoals.\" Wolff, 418 U.S. at 566. The purpose of the qualification was\nmanifest: \"Prison officials must have the necessary discretion to keep\nthe hearing within reasonable limits and to refuse to call witnesses\nthat may create a risk of reprisal or undermine authority, as well as\nto limit access to other inmates to collect statements or to compile\nother documentary evidence.\" Id. Thus after Wolff, it was clearly\nestablished that prison officials had the discretion to deny witness\nrequests, where legitimate penological interests justified excluding a\nwitness.\n\n   Wolff did leave open an important question that has divided the cir-\ncuits: whether prison officials had to consider witness requests on a\ncase-by-case basis, or whether they could formulate regulations\ndesigned to deal with such requests categorically. Compare Ramer v.\nKerby, 936 F.2d 1102, 1104 (10th Cir. 1991) (Wolff demands an \"in-\ndividualized determination\" whether to grant an inmate’s witness\nrequest); King v. Wells, 760 F.2d 89, 93 (6th Cir. 1985) (\"Wolff\nrequires that officials make an individualized decision on the facts of\neach case. . . .\"); Dalton v. Hutto, 713 F.2d 75, 78 (4th Cir. 1983)\n(Wolff deems \"per se proscriptions against the calling of certain cate-\ngories of witnesses\" violative of due process); Bartholomew v. Wat-\nson, 665 F.2d 915, 918 (9th Cir. 1982) (Wolff demands \"a case-by-\ncase analysis of the potential hazards\" of calling a particular witness),\nwith Whitlock v. Johnson, 153 F.3d 380, 386-87 (7th Cir. 1998) (rec-\nognizing room for generalized rules that exclude certain types of wit-\nnesses); McGuinness v. Dubois, 75 F.3d 794, 799-800 & n.7 (1st Cir.\n1996) (questioning the case-by-case requirement); Powell v.\n\f                          BROWN v. BRAXTON                            7\nCoughlin, 953 F.2d 744, 749 (2d Cir. 1991) (upholding policy against\ncalling prison mental health clinicians in inmates’ presence).* How-\never, we need not revisit that debate here, because Wolff establishes\nbeyond doubt all that is necessary to resolve this case: hearing offi-\ncers like Edmonds may decide that legitimate penological interests\njustify the denial of an individual inmate’s witness request, and their\ndecisions are not to be lightly second-guessed by courts far removed\nfrom the demands of prison administration.\n\n                                  B.\n\n   The parties dispute whether Inmate Hearing Officer Edmonds\napplied DOP 861.14(B)(1) as a categorical rule against live testimony\nby inmate witnesses at Level 5 and 6 facilities. However, the district\ncourt reviewed the tapes of Brown’s disciplinary hearing and found\nas a factual matter that Edmonds had individually considered Brown’s\nrequest. In all events, it is clear that Edmonds acted under the author-\nity of the regulation in declining to call Beavers in person. The simple\nquestion before us is whether we should defer to his decision. For at\nleast three reasons, we conclude that we must.\n\n                                   1.\n\n   Initially, DOP 861.14(B)(1) serves legitimate penological interests.\nThe regulation is designed above all to prevent inmates from force-\nfully coercing testimony out of their fellow prisoners. Simply put, it\nprotects inmates’ safety. \"Retaliation is much more than a theoretical\npossibility\" for inmates who are called as witnesses in disciplinary\nhearings, Wolff, 418 U.S. at 562; it is a \"very real danger[ ],\" Ponte\n\n   *In Ponte v. Real, 471 U.S. 491, 496 (1985), the Supreme Court inti-\nmated that broader policies designed to deal with witness requests might\nbe constitutionally permissible. Accordingly, in Ponte’s wake, there has\nbeen a growing recognition that prisons may develop witness request\npolicies for sensible reasons. See, e.g., Whitlock, 153 F.3d at 387\n(explaining how Ponte \"allow[ed] for the possibility that some [blanket]\npolicies, if sensitively designed and administered, could be constitu-\ntional\"); Powell, 953 F.2d at 749 (same). In view of the grounds for our\ndecision here, we need not address the continuing viability of our deci-\nsion in Dalton in the face of Ponte and its progeny.\n\f8                          BROWN v. BRAXTON\nv. Real, 471 U.S. 491, 495 (1985). As the Supreme Court has recog-\nnized, prisoners are \"subject to the unwritten code that exhorts\ninmates not to inform on a fellow prisoner,\" and they are vulnerable\nshould they elect to violate that code. Wolff, 418 U.S. at 562. Cer-\ntainly inmate witnesses do not always testify under threat of coercion.\nYet the broader concern of reprisal necessitates protection for inmate\nwitnesses, especially at prisons like Red Onion that are filled with the\nState’s most hardened criminals. Virginia has rightly sought to dimin-\nish the risk to maximum security inmates’ safety by allowing them to\ntestify in writing.\n\n   The regulation also attempts to reduce the shuffling of inmates\ninside maximum security prisons. Disciplinary hearings have placed\na serious administrative burden on prisons, whose caseloads can\nrequire standing disciplinary boards that convene daily to hear hun-\ndreds of cases a week. See, e.g., Whitlock v. Johnson, 153 F.3d 380,\n389 (7th Cir. 1998). In this context, it is truer than ever that \"the unre-\nstricted right to call witnesses from the prison population carries obvi-\nous potential for disruption and for interference with the swift\npunishment that in individual cases may be essential to carrying out\nthe correctional program of the institution.\" Wolff, 418 U.S. at 566.\nAgain, DOP 861.14(B)(1) quite reasonably attempts to minimize the\nsubstantial disruption and administrative burden that would flow from\nan unrestricted right to live witness testimony.\n\n                                    2.\n\n   Secondly, the State has tailored its regulation to meet its penologi-\ncal concerns. The twin dangers of retaliation and disruption are pres-\nent to some degree whenever inmates are allowed to call their fellow\nprisoners as witnesses in disciplinary proceedings. Yet the Virginia\nDepartment of Corrections has not sought to limit live testimony from\nall kinds of witnesses, nor has it sought even to limit live testimony\nfrom inmate witnesses at all kinds of facilities.\n\n   Rather, the State has simply vested prison officials like Edmonds\nwith the discretion to decide whether some relatively few inmates —\nthose inmates held at maximum security facilities — should testify in\nperson or in writing. For while both oral and written testimony pre-\nsent some danger of retaliation and disruption, the face-to-face, con-\n\f                          BROWN v. BRAXTON                            9\nfrontational nature of oral testimony creates more serious difficulties\nfor prison officials. In sum, the State has tailored its regulation to\nmeet its most pressing needs by placing limits on the live testimony\nof its most dangerous inmates — those inmates who pose the severest\nthreat to personal and institutional safety. The bounds that prison\nauthorities have placed on live witness testimony thus represent a sen-\nsible \"mutual accommodation between institutional needs and objec-\ntives and the provisions of the Constitution. . . .\" Wolff, 418 U.S. at\n556.\n\n   Indeed, it is the moderateness of Virginia’s regulation that sets it\napart from other witness request policies. For example, in Dalton v.\nHutto, 713 F.2d 75, 77-78 (4th Cir. 1983), this court invalidated a\nVirginia prison guideline — in fact, a less artfully crafted predecessor\nto DOP 861.14(B)(1) — that denied all inmates the right to call any\nwitness who would not appear voluntarily. Pursuant to Guideline No.\n861, two corrections officers had refused to testify at prisoner James\nDalton’s disciplinary hearing as Dalton had requested. Dalton, 713\nF.2d at 76. The court concluded that for an inmate’s due process right\nto be meaningful, prison officials could not stand idly by while any\nwitness refused to testify for any reason or even no reason at all. Id.\nat 78.\n\n   However, the differences between DOP 861.14(B)(1) and the\nguideline at issue in Dalton are stark. Unlike DOP 861.14(B)(1),\nGuideline No. 861 made no provision for the submission of written\nstatements in lieu of live testimony. Thus Dalton and the prison tribu-\nnal were wholly without the benefit of Dalton’s desired testimony.\nSee id. at 77. Guideline No. 861 also made no attempt to distinguish\nbetween inmate, staff, and outside witnesses. In fact, in Dalton it was\ntwo corrections officers who were refusing to testify — witnesses\nwho would be compelled to testify under DOP 861.14(B)(1), which\naccords inmates at all Virginia correctional institutions an unqualified\nright to call staff witnesses at disciplinary hearings.\n\n   In short, Dalton’s right to call witnesses was essentially eviscer-\nated, which Wolff does not permit; but Brown’s right to call witnesses\nwas instead qualified, which Wolff expressly sanctions. The distinc-\ntion is crucial, because the majority of regulations invalidated by our\nsister circuits have been absolute prohibitions on the calling of wit-\n\f10                         BROWN v. BRAXTON\nnesses or certain categories of witnesses. Those regulations have\napplied system-wide to all disciplinary hearings, and they have\nresulted in the loss of testimony altogether. See, e.g., Whitlock v.\nJohnson, 153 F.3d 380, 388 (7th Cir. 1998) (invalidating \"policy of\ndenying virtually all requests for live witnesses\"); Mitchell v. Dupnik,\n75 F.3d 517, 525 (9th Cir. 1996) (invalidating \"a blanket policy of\nprohibiting inmates from calling any witnesses under any circum-\nstances to testify at disciplinary hearings\"); Forbes v. Trigg, 976 F.2d\n308, 318 (7th Cir. 1992) (invalidating policy that allowed inmates and\nstaff members to refuse to testify at disciplinary hearings); King v.\nWells, 760 F.2d 89, 93 (6th Cir. 1985) (invalidating prison’s \"policy\nof not permitting witness testimony under any circumstances\").\n\n   Virginia’s policy suffers no similar infirmity. In truth, it is difficult\nto imagine how Virginia could draft a narrower regulation: DOP\n861.14(B)(1) permits prison officials to limit only a type of testimony\n(live testimony) from a type of witness (an inmate witness) at a type\nof facility (a Level 5 or 6 prison). If any regulation dealing with wit-\nness requests at prison disciplinary hearings is to survive constitu-\ntional scrutiny — and Ponte suggests some do — surely it is this one.\nInvalidating DOP 861.14(B)(1) would preclude virtually any policy\nthat dealt with inmates’ witness requests, encasing disciplinary pro-\nceedings in the sort of \"inflexible constitutional straitjacket\" that the\nSupreme Court has condemned. Wolff, 418 U.S. at 563. It makes\nsense to treat inmate witnesses differently from other types of wit-\nnesses, and maximum security inmate witnesses differently still.\n\n                                    3.\n\n   Thirdly, the reasonableness of Virginia’s regulation could hardly\nbe clearer than in its application to the present case. Numerous offi-\ncers witnessed the fight between Brown and Beavers; both were\ntreated for their injuries; physical evidence at the scene substantiated\nthe officers’ account; and Beavers himself initially said that he had\nbeen attacked by Brown. Why then would Beavers change his story?\nAs the district court found, Edmonds believed that Beavers feared\nwhat would happen to him in the event that he did not recant. After\nall, Beavers had already been assaulted once. Had he informed on\nBrown, either in his written statement or in live testimony at the hear-\ning, it was not difficult for him to imagine how Brown would repay\n\f                           BROWN v. BRAXTON                            11\nhis forthrightness. Granted, Beavers may well have altered his testi-\nmony for reasons other than the risk of retaliation, but that makes it\nno less reasonable for Edmonds to have taken the risk seriously. If\nWolff and Ponte teach anything, it is that the dictates of due process\ndo not require prison officials to turn a blind eye to the stubborn reali-\nties of prison life.\n\n   Moreover, Brown made no attempt at his disciplinary hearing to\nexplain the value of calling Beavers as a live witness. Beavers’ single\nsentence — \"At no time did inmate D. Brown assault me with his\nadapter or in any other way\" — was the sum and substance of his tes-\ntimony. This was not a complicated disciplinary hearing: either\nBrown had assaulted Beavers, or he had not. Edmonds read Beavers’\nstatement into the record at the hearing and was well aware that Bea-\nvers denied the assault, just as he was well aware of the ample evi-\ndence that Beavers’ statement was a post hoc falsification.\n\n   While Brown asserts that Beavers would have testified at greater\nlength than his brief, one-sentence written statement, Brown never\nspecifies what else Beavers would have said. Thus even if Edmonds\nsomehow erred in not calling Beavers as a live witness, Brown has\nnot demonstrated that he was harmed by Beavers’ testifying in writing\nrather than in person. See, e.g., Piggie v. Cotton, 344 F.3d 674, 678\n(7th Cir. 2003) (holding potential due process violation harmless\nwhere accused inmate could not explain how witness’ live testimony\nwould have helped him); McGuinness v. Dubois, 75 F.3d 794, 800\n(1st Cir. 1996) (holding lack of live testimony harmless where inmate\nwas able to present defense, supported by witness affidavits); Powell\nv. Coughlin, 953 F.2d 744, 751 (2d Cir. 1991) (holding denial of\ninmate’s witness request for her psychiatrist harmless, in part because\npsychiatrist’s notes were admitted instead).\n\n   In fact, as the district court noted, Brown was likely helped — not\nharmed — by Beavers’ absence. Had Beavers testified in person, he\nwould have had to explain his statement to nurses, \"I was hit with an\nadapter,\" as well as his similar statement to Lieutenant Chris that he\nhad been assaulted by Brown. Surely Beavers would have been asked\nto account for the flat contradictions in his earlier oral statements and\nhis subsequent written testimony. And then Beavers would have been\nplaced squarely on the hot seat that Edmonds was attempting to\n\f12                         BROWN v. BRAXTON\navoid: Beavers could have struggled to explain how he was injured\nin a fight that never occurred, or he could have informed on Brown\nand tempted whatever fate befalls jailhouse snitches. No matter Bea-\nvers’ choice, his testimony could not possibly have added anything to\nBrown’s defense.\n\n                                    III.\n\n   As if Brown’s task were not sufficiently Sisyphean, he asks that we\ngainsay Edmonds’ decision within the context of the Antiterrorism\nand Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214.\nUnder AEDPA, we may grant Brown habeas corpus relief only if the\nSupreme Court of Virginia’s dismissal of Brown’s petition was \"con-\ntrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly estab-\nlished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United\nStates.\" 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1) (2000). Yet the Supreme Court’s case\nlaw in this area dictates precisely the opposite result from that urged\nby Brown.\n\n   Again and again, the Supreme Court has cautioned that we should\nbe hesitant to substitute our judgments for those of prison administra-\ntors. See Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472, 482 (1995) (\"[F]ederal\ncourts ought to afford appropriate deference and flexibility to state\nofficials trying to manage a volatile environment.\"); Ponte, 471 U.S.\nat 499 (\"Given [Wolff’s] significant limitations on an inmate’s right\nto call witnesses, and given our further observation in Wolff that ‘[w]e\nshould not be too ready to exercise oversight and put aside the judg-\nment of prison administrators,’ it may be that a constitutional chal-\nlenge to a disciplinary hearing . . . will rarely, if ever, be successful.\")\n(citation omitted); Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners’ Labor Union,\nInc., 433 U.S. 119, 126 (1977) (\"Because the realities of running a\npenal institution are complex and difficult, we have also recognized\nthe wide-ranging deference to be accorded the decisions of prison\nadministrators.\"); Wolff, 418 U.S. at 566-67 (\"[Prison officials] must\nhave the necessary discretion [to limit the calling of witnesses] with-\nout being subject to unduly crippling constitutional impediments.\").\nHere, Inmate Hearing Officer Edmonds considered the merits of\nBrown’s witness request, but concluded that legitimate penological\ninterests warranted denying the request. Perhaps chief among those\ninterests, Edmonds acted to protect one of the inmates whose safety\n\f                         BROWN v. BRAXTON                         13\nwas entrusted to his care. We cannot say that his effort ran afoul of\nthe constraints of due process. The judgment of the district court is\ntherefore\n\n                                                        AFFIRMED.\n\f",

BRAXTON\n                               OPINION\n\nWILKINSON, Circuit Judge:\n\n   DeMarcus M. Brown, an inmate incarcerated at Red Onion State\nPrison in Pound, Virginia, was found guilty at a prison disciplinary\nhearing of assaulting a fellow inmate, Johnnie Lee Beavers. The offi-\ncer in charge of the hearing denied Brown’s request to call Beavers\nas a witness, but allowed Brown to submit Beavers’ written statement\nin lieu of live testimony. Brown claims that his inability to present\nBeavers as a live witness denied him due process of law, but we dis-\nagree. Prison officials have the discretion, indeed the duty, to protect\nthe inmates committed to their care. Among other concerns, prison\nauthorities justifiably feared reprisal against Beavers in the event that\nhis testimony was not as Brown hoped, and they were not constitu-\ntionally required to expose Beavers to the threat of a second beating.\nWe therefore affirm the judgment.\n\n                                    I.\n\n   The State of Virginia classifies its correctional facilities at six dif-\nferent levels. Level 1 correctional units provide dormitory-style living\nfor minimum-security inmates convicted of relatively minor offenses.\nBy contrast, Level 5 and 6 prisons house maximum-security inmates\nconvicted of much more serious offenses. Red Onion State Prison,\nwhere Brown and Beavers are incarcerated, is Virginia’s only Level\n6 facility. It provides maximum-security celled living for inmates who\nhave severe behavioral problems; who are serving extremely long\nsentences; or who present escape risks.\n\n   On September 9, 2000, Beavers had completed his duties as an\ninmate recreation worker and was returning to his cell. When Correc-\ntional Officer Samie Fleming opened Beavers’ cell door, Brown fol-\nlowed Beavers inside. Fleming heard slapping and hollering from\ninside the cell, so he closed the cell door and reported an emergency\non the cell intercom. Lieutenant James Robinson, Sergeants Gregory\nDeel and Dwight Moore, and several other correctional officers\nresponded immediately to Fleming’s call. According to Lieutenant\nRobinson, he saw Brown and Beavers fighting on the bottom bunk of\nthe cell. When Brown and Beavers ignored repeated orders to stop\n\f                         BROWN v. BRAXTON                            3\nfighting, the officers entered the cell and separated the pair. Both\nBrown and Beavers were then examined by the prison’s medical staff.\n\n   According to Lieutenant Robinson’s Incident Report, signed and\ndated the day of the fight, the prison nurses who examined Beavers\nfound that his left back tooth had been chipped during the altercation\nand his left wrist had been cut. Beavers also told the nurses, \"I was\nhit with an adapter.\" As for Brown, he sustained a bite mark on his\nright forearm and a few small cuts and abrasions. Brown was later\nplaced in administrative detention, while Lieutenant Kelly Chris\ninvestigated the altercation.\n\n   On September 18, 2000, Brown was served with a copy of Lieuten-\nant Chris’s Disciplinary Offense Report, which stated that Brown was\nbeing charged with aggravated assault. Upon being served, Brown\nrequested that Beavers appear as a witness on his behalf. Then on\nSeptember 22, Beavers submitted to prison officials a written state-\nment that said simply: \"At no time did inmate D. Brown assault me\nwith his adapter or in any other way.\"\n\n   On September 25, 2000, Inmate Hearing Officer Brett Edmonds\nconducted a disciplinary hearing on Brown’s assault charge. Lieuten-\nant Chris testified about Fleming’s report of the fight, as well as the\nnurses’ report on Beavers’ injuries and Beavers’ statement to the\nnurses that he had been hit with an adapter. Chris also testified that\nduring his investigation he had interviewed Beavers. According to\nChris, Beavers said that he and Brown had argued prior to the fight,\nand that later Brown had run into Beavers’ cell and attacked Beavers\nwith an adapter wrapped in a sock. As Chris had noted in his Disci-\nplinary Offense Report, an adapter with Brown’s name and inmate\nnumber was found in Beavers’ cell following the fight. Finally, Chris\ntestified that he had also interviewed Brown, who said that he was in\nBeavers’ cell with the permission of Beavers’ cellmate to watch tele-\nvision. However, Brown denied making such statements to Chris (and\nBeavers’ cellmate denied knowing Brown, much less giving him per-\nmission to watch his television).\n\n   Edmonds then gave Brown an opportunity to present evidence in\nhis defense. Brown requested that Beavers be called as a live witness,\nbut Edmonds denied Brown’s request. Edmonds then read Beavers’\n\f4                        BROWN v. BRAXTON\nwritten statement into the record. Accordingly, Brown argued that he\nshould not be found guilty of assault since Beavers himself denied\nbeing assaulted in any way. When Edmonds asked Brown whether he\nhad anything else to present, Brown said no; he presented no other\nwitnesses or arguments.\n\n   Edmonds proceeded to find Brown guilty of aggravated assault,\nsentencing him to the loss of 180 days of good conduct time. Accord-\ning to Edmonds’ written findings, (1) Brown had been identified by\nOfficer Fleming as the inmate who had entered Beavers’ cell; (2)\nBeavers had sustained injuries consistent with fighting; (3) Beavers\nhad stated to nurses immediately following the fight that he was\nattacked with an adapter; (4) Brown’s adapter was found in Beavers’\ncell after the fight; and (5) when Beavers was subsequently inter-\nviewed by Lieutenant Chris, Beavers confirmed that Brown had\nassaulted him with an adapter.\n\n   Brown presented a host of claims in a state habeas petition to the\nSupreme Court of Virginia. That court dismissed his petition on\nNovember 8, 2001. Brown then reiterated his claims in a habeas peti-\ntion filed in the United States District Court for the Western District\nof Virginia, which also dismissed Brown’s petition on March 19,\n2003. We issued a certificate of appealability on October 24, 2003 to\nconsider whether Brown’s right to due process was violated by\nEdmonds’ refusal to call Beavers as a witness.\n\n                                  II.\n\n   Brown challenges the constitutionality of Virginia Department of\nCorrections Division Operating Procedure (\"DOP\") 861.14(B)(1).\nBrown alleges that Edmonds relied on DOP 861.14(B)(1) in denying\nhis request to call Beavers as a witness. DOP 861.14(B)(1) provides\nthat in all disciplinary hearings for certain types of charged offenses\n\n    [t]he IHO [Inmate Hearing Officer] shall examine each wit-\n    ness’ statement for relevance and repetitiveness. A witness’\n    written statement shall not be used in lieu of the witness’\n    testimony at a Disciplinary Hearing, except at Level 5 and\n    6 institutions and segregation units; the statement from an\n    inmate witness is sufficient. Staff witnesses requested by the\n\f                           BROWN v. BRAXTON                             5\n     inmate should appear at the Disciplinary Hearing at Level\n     5 and 6 institutions and in segregation units.\n\n   DOP 861.14(B)(1) thus regulates the use of witness testimony in\ndisciplinary hearings, and it draws distinctions based upon the type of\ninstitution at which the accused inmate is housed, the type of witness\nsought by the accused inmate, and the type of testimony to be offered\nby the witness. Specifically, DOP 861.14(B)(1) allows inmates at all\nVirginia correctional institutions an unqualified right to call staff wit-\nnesses at disciplinary hearings. However, only inmates at Level 1, 2,\n3 and 4 facilities are guaranteed the right to call willing fellow\ninmates as live witnesses. Prisoners at Level 5 and 6 facilities who\nwish to present testimony from their fellow inmates may be required\nto submit written statements in lieu of live testimony.\n\n                                   A.\n\n   An analysis of the constitutionality of DOP 861.14(B)(1) must\nbegin with the Supreme Court’s seminal case on the due process\nrights of prisoners, Wolff v. McDonnell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109097\"><a href=\"/opinion/109097/wolff-v-mcdonnell/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">539</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1974). In\nWolff, the Supreme Court considered how prison disciplinary hearings\nmust be structured in order to comport with the demands of the Due\nProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court was clear\nthat inmates retain rights under the Due Process Clause, but that their\nrights are \"subject to restrictions imposed by the nature of the regime\nto which they have been lawfully committed.\" Wolff, 418 U.S. at 556.\nPrison disciplinary hearings, unlike criminal prosecutions or parole\nrevocation hearings, \"take place in a closed, tightly controlled envi-\nronment peopled by those who have chosen to violate the criminal\nlaw. . . .\" Id. at 561. In many prisons, the inmates can be dangerous\nto each other, and they are confined to a setting that is often rife with\ntension between inmates, guards, and prison officials. Id. at 561-62.\nAs the Court recognized, \"[i]t is against this background that disci-\nplinary proceedings must be structured by prison authorities; and it is\nagainst this background that we must make our constitutional judg-\nments. . . .\" Id. at 562.\n\n   In defining the balance between inmates’ due process interests and\nprison authorities’ penological needs, the Wolff Court drew some firm\nlines. On the one hand, inmates are entitled to advance written notice\n\f6                         BROWN v. BRAXTON\nof the claimed violation, as well as a written statement concerning the\nevidence relied upon and the reasons for the disciplinary action taken.\nId. at 563. On the other hand, inmates are not entitled to confront the\nwitnesses against them, nor are they guaranteed the right to retained\nor appointed counsel. Id. at 567-70; see also Baxter v. Palmigiano,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109429\"><a href=\"/opinion/109429/baxter-v-palmigiano/\"><span class=\"volume\">425</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">308</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 315-22 (1976) (discussing limited range of inmate\nrights in prison disciplinary proceedings).\n\n   But with regard to an inmate’s right to present evidence in his\ndefense, the Court took a more nuanced view. An inmate facing disci-\nplinary proceedings has the qualified right \"to call witnesses and pre-\nsent documentary evidence in his defense when permitting him to do\nso will not be unduly hazardous to institutional safety or correctional\ngoals.\" Wolff, 418 U.S. at 566. The purpose of the qualification was\nmanifest: \"Prison officials must have the necessary discretion to keep\nthe hearing within reasonable limits and to refuse to call witnesses\nthat may create a risk of reprisal or undermine authority, as well as\nto limit access to other inmates to collect statements or to compile\nother documentary evidence.\" Id. Thus after Wolff, it was clearly\nestablished that prison officials had the discretion to deny witness\nrequests, where legitimate penological interests justified excluding a\nwitness.\n\n   Wolff did leave open an important question that has divided the cir-\ncuits: whether prison officials had to consider witness requests on a\ncase-by-case basis, or whether they could formulate regulations\ndesigned to deal with such requests categorically.

However, the district\ncourt reviewed the tapes of Brown’s disciplinary hearing and found\nas a factual matter that Edmonds had individually considered Brown’s\nrequest. In all events, it is clear that Edmonds acted under the author-\nity of the regulation in declining to call Beavers in person. The simple\nquestion before us is whether we should defer to his decision. For at\nleast three reasons, we conclude that we must.\n\n                                   1.\n\n   Initially, DOP 861.14(B)(1) serves legitimate penological interests.\nThe regulation is designed above all to prevent inmates from force-\nfully coercing testimony out of their fellow prisoners. Simply put, it\nprotects inmates’ safety. \"Retaliation is much more than a theoretical\npossibility\" for inmates who are called as witnesses in disciplinary\nhearings, Wolff, 418 U.S. at 562; it is a \"very real danger[ ],\" Ponte\n\n   *In Ponte v. Real, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111430\"><a href=\"/opinion/111430/ponte-v-real/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">491</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 496 (1985), the Supreme Court inti-\nmated that broader policies designed to deal with witness requests might\nbe constitutionally permissible. Accordingly, in Ponte’s wake, there has\nbeen a growing recognition that prisons may develop witness request\npolicies for sensible reasons. See, e.g., Whitlock, 153 F.3d at 387\n(explaining how Ponte \"allow[ed] for the possibility that some [blanket]\npolicies, if sensitively designed and administered, could be constitu-\ntional\"); Powell, 953 F.2d at 749 (same). In view of the grounds for our\ndecision here, we need not address the continuing viability of our deci-\nsion in Dalton in the face of Ponte and its progeny.\n\f8                          BROWN v. BRAXTON\nv. Real, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111430\"><a href=\"/opinion/111430/ponte-v-real/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">491</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 495 (1985). As the Supreme Court has recog-\nnized, prisoners are \"subject to the unwritten code that exhorts\ninmates not to inform on a fellow prisoner,\" and they are vulnerable\nshould they elect to violate that code. Wolff, 418 U.S. at 562. Cer-\ntainly inmate witnesses do not always testify under threat of coercion.\nYet the broader concern of reprisal necessitates protection for inmate\nwitnesses, especially at prisons like Red Onion that are filled with the\nState’s most hardened criminals. Virginia has rightly sought to dimin-\nish the risk to maximum security inmates’ safety by allowing them to\ntestify in writing.\n\n   The regulation also attempts to reduce the shuffling of inmates\ninside maximum security prisons. Disciplinary hearings have placed\na serious administrative burden on prisons, whose caseloads can\nrequire standing disciplinary boards that convene daily to hear hun-\ndreds of cases a week. See, e.g., Whitlock v. Johnson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"757327\"><a href=\"/opinion/757327/herbert-whitlock-stanley-wrice-and-bennie-lopez-v-adrienne-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">153</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">380</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n389 (7th Cir. 1998). In this context, it is truer than ever that \"the unre-\nstricted right to call witnesses from the prison population carries obvi-\nous potential for disruption and for interference with the swift\npunishment that in individual cases may be essential to carrying out\nthe correctional program of the institution.\" Wolff, 418 U.S. at 566.\nAgain, DOP 861.14(B)(1) quite reasonably attempts to minimize the\nsubstantial disruption and administrative burden that would flow from\nan unrestricted right to live witness testimony.\n\n                                    2.\n\n   Secondly, the State has tailored its regulation to meet its penologi-\ncal concerns. The twin dangers of retaliation and disruption are pres-\nent to some degree whenever inmates are allowed to call their fellow\nprisoners as witnesses in disciplinary proceedings. Yet the Virginia\nDepartment of Corrections has not sought to limit live testimony from\nall kinds of witnesses, nor has it sought even to limit live testimony\nfrom inmate witnesses at all kinds of facilities.\n\n   Rather, the State has simply vested prison officials like Edmonds\nwith the discretion to decide whether some relatively few inmates —\nthose inmates held at maximum security facilities — should testify in\nperson or in writing. For while both oral and written testimony pre-\nsent some danger of retaliation and disruption, the face-to-face, con-\n\f                          BROWN v. BRAXTON                            9\nfrontational nature of oral testimony creates more serious difficulties\nfor prison officials. In sum, the State has tailored its regulation to\nmeet its most pressing needs by placing limits on the live testimony\nof its most dangerous inmates — those inmates who pose the severest\nthreat to personal and institutional safety. The bounds that prison\nauthorities have placed on live witness testimony thus represent a sen-\nsible \"mutual accommodation between institutional needs and objec-\ntives and the provisions of the Constitution. . . .\" Wolff, 418 U.S. at\n556.\n\n   Indeed, it is the moderateness of Virginia’s regulation that sets it\napart from other witness request policies. For example, in Dalton v.\nHutto, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"422055\"><a href=\"/opinion/422055/james-roscoe-dalton-v-td-hutto-gene-johnson-major-san-fillipio-capt/\"><span class=\"volume\">713</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">75</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 77-78 (4th Cir. 1983), this court invalidated a\nVirginia prison guideline — in fact, a less artfully crafted predecessor\nto DOP 861.14(B)(1) — that denied all inmates the right to call any\nwitness who would not appear voluntarily. Pursuant to Guideline No.\n861, two corrections officers had refused to testify at prisoner James\nDalton’s disciplinary hearing as Dalton had requested. Dalton, 713\nF.2d at 76. The court concluded that for an inmate’s due process right\nto be meaningful, prison officials could not stand idly by while any\nwitness refused to testify for any reason or even no reason at all. Id.\nat 78.\n\n   However, the differences between DOP 861.14(B)(1) and the\nguideline at issue in Dalton are stark. Unlike DOP 861.14(B)(1),\nGuideline No. 861 made no provision for the submission of written\nstatements in lieu of live testimony. Thus Dalton and the prison tribu-\nnal were wholly without the benefit of Dalton’s desired testimony.\nSee id. at 77. Guideline No. 861 also made no attempt to distinguish\nbetween inmate, staff, and outside witnesses. In fact, in Dalton it was\ntwo corrections officers who were refusing to testify — witnesses\nwho would be compelled to testify under DOP 861.14(B)(1), which\naccords inmates at all Virginia correctional institutions an unqualified\nright to call staff witnesses at disciplinary hearings.\n\n   In short, Dalton’s right to call witnesses was essentially eviscer-\nated, which Wolff does not permit; but Brown’s right to call witnesses\nwas instead qualified, which Wolff expressly sanctions. The distinc-\ntion is crucial, because the majority of regulations invalidated by our\nsister circuits have been absolute prohibitions on the calling of wit-\n\f10                         BROWN v. BRAXTON\nnesses or certain categories of witnesses. Those regulations have\napplied system-wide to all disciplinary hearings, and they have\nresulted in the loss of testimony altogether. See, e.g., Whitlock v.\nJohnson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"757327\"><a href=\"/opinion/757327/herbert-whitlock-stanley-wrice-and-bennie-lopez-v-adrienne-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">153</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">380</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 388 (7th Cir. 1998) (invalidating \"policy of\ndenying virtually all requests for live witnesses\"); Mitchell v.

In truth, it is difficult\nto imagine how Virginia could draft a narrower regulation: DOP\n861.14(B)(1) permits prison officials to limit only a type of testimony\n(live testimony) from a type of witness (an inmate witness) at a type\nof facility (a Level 5 or 6 prison). If any regulation dealing with wit-\nness requests at prison disciplinary hearings is to survive constitu-\ntional scrutiny — and Ponte suggests some do — surely it is this one.\nInvalidating DOP 861.14(B)(1) would preclude virtually any policy\nthat dealt with inmates’ witness requests, encasing disciplinary pro-\nceedings in the sort of \"inflexible constitutional straitjacket\" that the\nSupreme Court has condemned. Wolff, 418 U.S. at 563. It makes\nsense to treat inmate witnesses differently from other types of wit-\nnesses, and maximum security inmate witnesses differently still.\n\n                                    3.\n\n   Thirdly, the reasonableness of Virginia’s regulation could hardly\nbe clearer than in its application to the present case. Numerous offi-\ncers witnessed the fight between Brown and Beavers; both were\ntreated for their injuries; physical evidence at the scene substantiated\nthe officers’ account; and Beavers himself initially said that he had\nbeen attacked by Brown. Why then would Beavers change his story?\nAs the district court found, Edmonds believed that Beavers feared\nwhat would happen to him in the event that he did not recant. After\nall, Beavers had already been assaulted once. Had he informed on\nBrown, either in his written statement or in live testimony at the hear-\ning, it was not difficult for him to imagine how Brown would repay\n\f                           BROWN v. BRAXTON                            11\nhis forthrightness. Granted, Beavers may well have altered his testi-\nmony for reasons other than the risk of retaliation, but that makes it\nno less reasonable for Edmonds to have taken the risk seriously. If\nWolff and Ponte teach anything, it is that the dictates of due process\ndo not require prison officials to turn a blind eye to the stubborn reali-\nties of prison life.\n\n   Moreover, Brown made no attempt at his disciplinary hearing to\nexplain the value of calling Beavers as a live witness. Beavers’ single\nsentence — \"At no time did inmate D. Brown assault me with his\nadapter or in any other way\" — was the sum and substance of his tes-\ntimony. This was not a complicated disciplinary hearing: either\nBrown had assaulted Beavers, or he had not. Edmonds read Beavers’\nstatement into the record at the hearing and was well aware that Bea-\nvers denied the assault, just as he was well aware of the ample evi-\ndence that Beavers’ statement was a post hoc falsification.\n\n   While Brown asserts that Beavers would have testified at greater\nlength than his brief, one-sentence written statement, Brown never\nspecifies what else Beavers would have said. Thus even if Edmonds\nsomehow erred in not calling Beavers as a live witness, Brown has\nnot demonstrated that he was harmed by Beavers’ testifying in writing\nrather than in person. See, e.g., Piggie v. Cotton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783644\"><a href=\"/opinion/783644/clyde-piggie-v-zettie-cotton/\"><span class=\"volume\">344</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">674</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 678\n(7th Cir. 2003) (holding potential due process violation harmless\nwhere accused inmate could not explain how witness’ live testimony\nwould have helped him); McGuinness v. Dubois, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196569\"><a href=\"/opinion/196569/mcguiness-v-dubois/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">794</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 800\n(1st Cir. 1996) (holding lack of live testimony harmless where inmate\nwas able to present defense, supported by witness affidavits); Powell\nv. Coughlin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"575829\"><a href=\"/opinion/575829/elizabeth-powell-dalree-mapp-katherine-purrington-althea-mcdaniels-paula/\"><span class=\"volume\">953</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">744</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 751 (2d Cir. 1991) (holding denial of\ninmate’s witness request for her psychiatrist harmless, in part because\npsychiatrist’s notes were admitted instead).\n\n   In fact, as the district court noted, Brown was likely helped — not\nharmed — by Beavers’ absence. Had Beavers testified in person, he\nwould have had to explain his statement to nurses, \"I was hit with an\nadapter,\" as well as his similar statement to Lieutenant Chris that he\nhad been assaulted by Brown. Surely Beavers would have been asked\nto account for the flat contradictions in his earlier oral statements and\nhis subsequent written testimony. And then Beavers would have been\nplaced squarely on the hot seat that Edmonds was attempting to\n\f12                         BROWN v. BRAXTON\navoid: Beavers could have struggled to explain how he was injured\nin a fight that never occurred, or he could have informed on Brown\nand tempted whatever fate befalls jailhouse snitches. No matter Bea-\nvers’ choice, his testimony could not possibly have added anything to\nBrown’s defense.\n\n                                    III.\n\n   As if Brown’s task were not sufficiently Sisyphean, he asks that we\ngainsay Edmonds’ decision within the context of the Antiterrorism\nand Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214.\nUnder AEDPA, we may grant Brown habeas corpus relief only if the\nSupreme Court of Virginia’s dismissal of Brown’s petition was \"con-\ntrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly estab-\nlished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United\nStates.\" 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1) (2000). Yet the Supreme Court’s case\nlaw in this area dictates precisely the opposite result from that urged\nby Brown.\n\n   Again and again, the Supreme Court has cautioned that we should\nbe hesitant to substitute our judgments for those of prison administra-\ntors. See Sandin v. Conner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117957\"><a href=\"/opinion/117957/sandin-v-conner/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 482 (1995) (\"[F]ederal\ncourts ought to afford appropriate deference and flexibility to state\nofficials trying to manage a volatile environment.\"); Ponte, 471 U.S.\nat 499 (\"Given [Wolff’s] significant limitations on an inmate’s right\nto call witnesses, and given our further observation in Wolff that ‘[w]e\nshould not be too ready to exercise oversight and put aside the judg-\nment of prison administrators,’ it may be that a constitutional chal-\nlenge to a disciplinary hearing . . . will rarely, if ever, be successful.\")\n(citation omitted); Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners’ Labor Union,\nInc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109718\"><a href=\"/opinion/109718/jones-v-north-carolina-prisoners-labor-union-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">119</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 126 (1977) (\"Because the realities of running a\npenal institution are complex and difficult, we have also recognized\nthe wide-ranging deference to be accorded the decisions of prison\nadministrators.\"); Wolff, 418 U.S. at 566-67 (\"[Prison officials] must\nhave the necessary discretion [to limit the calling of witnesses] with-\nout being subject to unduly crippling constitutional impediments.\").\nHere, Inmate Hearing Officer Edmonds considered the merits of\nBrown’s witness request, but concluded that legitimate penological\ninterests warranted denying the request. Perhaps chief among those\ninterests, Edmonds acted to protect one of the inmates whose safety\n\f                         BROWN v. BRAXTON                         13\nwas entrusted to his care. We cannot say that his effort ran afoul of\nthe constraints of due process. The judgment of the district court is\ntherefore\n\n                                                        AFFIRMED.\n\f</pre>",
