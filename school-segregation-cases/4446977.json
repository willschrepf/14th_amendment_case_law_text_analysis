On January 6, 2012, Plaintiff filed suit against Defendants\n\nRobert Vaughn and Nicky Emsoff for assault, battery, conspiracy, excessive force, bystander\n\nliability, and violations ofthe Texas Constitution and U.S. Constitution. On December 11, 2014,\n\nthe Amarillo Court of Appeals reversed the trial court judgment dismissing Plaintiff's suit pursuant\n\nto Chapter 14 of the Texas Civil Practice & Remedies Code, and remanded the case. See Jackson\n\nv. Vaughn, 07-13-00022-CV, 2014 WL 6999333, at *6 (Tex. App.-Amarillo Dec. 11, 2014, no.\n\npet. h.). The Court of Appeals held that Plaintiff's pleadings sufficiently alleged a Section 1983\n\nexcessive force claim and a bystander claim. !d. On April24, 2015, Defendants Peter Honesto and\n\nJames Nail filed their original answer, and on April27, 2015, Defendants Honesto and Nail, along\n\nwith David Guzman, who was answering for the first time, filed an amended answer. 1\n\n\n\n1\n The counsel for defendants was not made aware until February 4, 2015 that Defendants Honesto, Nail, and\nGuzman had potentially been served back in November 2012.\n\n\n                                                        1\n\f                                     Arguments and Authorities\n\n    A. Vexatious Litigant Statutes\n\n        Chapter 11 of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code contains provisions addressing\n\nvexatious litigants-persons who abuse the legal system by filing numerous, frivolous lawsuits.\n\nSee Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code§§ 11.001-11.104. This chapter provides that on or before the\n\nninetieth day after the defendant files an original answer or makes a special appearance, the\n\ndefendant may move for an order declaring that the plaintiff a vexatious litigant and requiring the\n\nplaintiff to furnish security in order to proceed with 1'1is case. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code §\n\n11.051. Additionally, the court may declare this litigant vexatious on its own motion after notice\n\nand hearing. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code§ 11.202(a); In re Douglas, 333 S.W.3d 273,287 (Tex.\n\nApp.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2010, no pet.).\n\n        On the filing of a motion under§ 11.051, the litigation is stayed until after the motion's\n\ndisposition. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 11.052. If, after hearing the evidence on the motion,\n\nthe Court grants the motion, it \"shall order the plaintiff to furnish security for the benefit of the\n\nmoving defendant\" to be paid by a date determined by the Court. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code§\n\n11.055 (emphasis added). If the plaintiff fails to pay the security within the court's deadline, the\n\ncourt \"shall dismiss [the] litigation.\" Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code§ 11.056 (emphasis added). If\n\nthe plaintiffs suit is subsequently dismissed on the mL ·its, Section 11.057 states that the \"moving\n\ndefendant has recourse to the security ... in an amount determined by the Court.\"\n\n    B. Criteria for Finding a Litigant Vexatious\n\n        Under Section 11.054, a court may find a plaintiff vexatious if the defendant shows that\n\nthere is not a \"reasonable probability\" that the plaintiff will prevail in the present suit. Second, the\n\ndefendant must meet one of three additional requirements. This prong of the vexatious litigant\n\n\n\n                                                   2\n\fanalysis is satisfied by Plaintiffs pro se litigation history. Over the past seven years, Plaintiff has\n\n\"commenced, prosecuted, or maintained at least five litigations as a pro se litigant ... that have\n\nbeen: (A) finally determined adversely to the Plaintiff; (B) permitted to remain pending for at least\n\ntwo years without [proceeding] to trial or hearing; or (C) determined ... to be frivolous or\n\ngroundless.\" See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code§ 11.054(1).\n\n    C. Effect of Declaring Plaintiff to be Vexatious\n\n        Because Offender Reidie James Jackson fits the statutory definition of a vexatious litigant,\n\nthis court should require him \"to furnish security for the benefit of the moving defendant\" and\n\n\"dismiss [this suit if he] does not furnish the security within the time set by the order.\" Tex. Civ.\n\nPrac. & Rem. Code § 11.055-56. If his suit is subsequently dismissed on the merits, Section 11.057\n\nrequires that Defendants \"have recourse to the security ... in an amount determined by the Court.\"\n\n    D. Notice of Stay of Proceedings\n\n        Upon the filing of this motion, the present \"litiJation is stayed and the moving defendant\n\nis not required to plead\" until10 days after the motion is denied or 10 days after the Plaintiff has\n\nfurnished security in accordance with the Court's order. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code§ 11.052.\n\n    E. No Reasonable Probability of Success on the Merits.\n\n        Before finding a plaintiff a vexatious litigant, the defendant must show that \"there is not a\n\nreasonable probability that the plaintiff will prevail in the litigation against the defendant.\" See\n\nTex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 11.054. \"Undertaking [this] inquiry implicitly requires the trial\n\ncourt to preliminarily accept the factual assertions as true and assess whether they comprise a\n\nviable cause of action.\" Lagaite v.

App.-Fort Worth July 19,2007, pet. denied).\n\nThe Amarillo Court of Appeals held that \"[t]aking Jackson's plead facts as true ... his pleadings\n\nsufficiently allege a section 1983 excessive force claim and a bystander claim.\" Jackson, 2014 WL\n\n6999333 at *5. However, Plaintiffs claims are not likely to succeed on the merits.\n\n        1. There is no reasonable probability that Plaintiff will prevail on his excessive use\n            of force claim.\n\n        There is not a reasonable probability that Plaim:iff will succeed on his use of force claim.\n\nThe constitutional standard for an excessive use of force is \"whether force was applied in a good\n\nfaith effort to maintain or restore discipline or maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of\n\ncausing harm.\" Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U.S. 1, 6 (1992) (internal quotations omitted). The Court\n\nin Hudson also noted that the Eighth Amendment's prohibition       o~ cruel   and unusual punishment\n\n\"necessarily excludes from constitutional recognition de minimis uses of physical force, provided\n\nthat the use of force is not of a sort repugnant to the conscience of mankind.\" !d. at 10 (internal\n\nquotations omitted); see also Siglar v. Hightower, 112 F.3d 191, 193 (5th Cir. 1997). Plaintiffs\n\nclaims of excessive use of force must fail if Defendants acted with even an arguable effort to\n\nmaintain or restore discipline. See Whitley v. Albers, 475 U.S. 312, 321-22 (1986) (\"Prison\n\nadministrators ... should be accorded wide-ranging ueference in the adoption and execution of\n\npolicies and practices that in their judgment are needed to preserve internal order and discipline\n\nand to maintain institutional security.\") (internal quotations omitted).\n\n        The Supreme Court in Hudson provides the five factors that a Plaintiff must prove to\n\nsupport his excessive use of force claim. Hudson, 503 U.S. at 7. The Hudson factors include: (1)\n\nthe extent of the injury suffered; (2) the need for the application of force; (3) the relationship\n\nbetween the need and the amount of force used; (4) the threat reasonably perceived by the\n\nresponsible officials; and (5) any efforts made to temper the severity of a forceful response. Id. at\n\n\n                                                  4\n\f7; Baldwin v. Stalder, 137 F.3d 836, 839 (5th Cir. 1998); Hudson v. McMillian, 962 F.2d 522, 523\n\n(5th Cir. 1992). \"The amount of force that is constitutionally permissible ... must be judged by\n\nthe context in which that force is deployed.\" Ikerd v. Blair, 101 F.3d 430, 434 (5th Cir. 1996). It\n\nshould be noted that not every push or shove, even if it may seem unnecessary in the peace of a\n\njudge's chambers, violates a prisoner's constitutional rights. Johnson v. Glick, 481 F .2d 1028, 1033\n\n(2nd Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. John v. Johnson, 414 U.S. 1033 (1973)). Plaintiff cannot satisfy\n\nthe five Hudson   8     that he must prove in order to support his use of force claim.\n\n        First, Plaintiff has not shown an injury. In Brown v. Lippard, the Fifth Circuit considered\n\nthe effect of the first Hudson factor, relating to the injuries suffered. 472 F.3d 384, 386-387 (5th\n\nCir. 2006). The Fifth Circuit held in that case that injuries are insufficient to support an\n\nexcessive force claim where there is no physical injury, or where the injury is extremely minor,\n\nsuch as a bruise caused by having one's ear twisted. Id. at 387. Additionally, civil rights plaintiffs\n\nmust allege an actual injury caused by the defendants' actions. Wilkins v. Gaddy, 559 U.S. 34, 1178\n\n(2010) (\"An inmate who complains of a push or shove that causes no discernible injury almost\n\ncertainly fails to ~ate a valid excessive force clai~'); see also Memphis Community School\n\nDistrictv. Stachura, 477 U.S. 299,308 (1986) (for a§ 1983 claim to b~iabl~the plaintiffmust\n\nallege an injury). This is true in cases alleging excessive use of force. See, e.g., Jackson v.\n\nCulbertson, 984 F.2d 699, 700 (5th Cir. 1993) (excessive force claim for spraying with a fire hose\n\nfrivolous where prisoner suffered no injury); Siglar v. Hightower, 112 F.3d 191, 193 (5th Cir.\n\n1997) (sore, bruised ear which required no medical care and healed in a few days would not support\n\ncivil rights claim for excessive force). Ultimately, where the objective factors of an inmate's\n\nmedical record show no evidence of any injuries consistent with the inmate's allegations, the court\n\nmay conclude that the allegations are implausible. See Wilburn v. Shane, 193 F.3d 517, 1999 WL\n\n\n\n                                                  5\n\f706141 (5th Cir. 1999), citing Wesson v. Oglesby, 910 F.2d 278,281-82 (5th Cir. 1990).\n\n        In Williams, an offender accused an officer of using excessive force in violation of his\n\nEighth Amendment rights. Williams v. Thompson, No. 5:11-cv-68, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25302,\n\nat *2-3 (E.D. Tex. Feb. 27, 2012). More specifically, the offender alleged that the officer hit him\n\nover the head with a flashlight so hard that he was knocked unconscious. Id. at *6. The medical\n\nrecords, however, did not show that the offender had a bruise, knot, or any injury associated with\n\nhis allegation of excessive force. Id. The Court held, that since the objective medical records did\n\nnot show that the offender suffered an injury, his claims were dismissed in line with the Supreme\n\nCourt's holding in Wilkins. Id. at *7.\n\n        Plaintiff has not suffered an injury or provided proof of an injury outside of his conclusory\n\nself-serving statements. See, e.g., Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint at 14 (\"Every [sic] since\n\nthe incident Plaintiff has been having progressively blurred vision, his real tooth along with his\n\ntemporary dental plate suffered chips and breakage.\"), Plaintiff's Third Amended Complaint at 6\n\n(\"Plaintiff was permanently injured.\"). Moreover, a review of the relevant portions of the medical\n\nreport contained in the Use of Force Report indicate that at the time of the event Plaintiff\n\ncomplained of back injury, yet upon examination no injuries were found. Exhibit A at 4-6.\n\nAdditionally, the medical records for the relevant time period do not show that the Plaintiff\n\nsubmitted any sick call requests or saw a clinician for his alleged injuries. Exhibit B at 7. Given\n\nthat Plaintiff did not suffer any injuries or has not presented credible evidence of his injuries, there\n\nis no reasonable probability that Plaintiffwill prevail in his excessive use of force claim.\n\n        The next Hudson factor discussed is the need for the application of force. In his second\n\namended complaint, Plaintiff states that he committed several defiant acts that caused force to be\n\nused: he refused the initial preparation and transport; '1e refused to relinquish the handcuffs and\n\n\n\n                                                   6\n\f                      follow commands of the officers; and he placed his mattress in front of the entrance of his cell\n                                                                                                                                             ,(-!\n\n                      door in order to obstruct the officers' path. Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint at pages 10-12;              ·9·tK\n                                                                                                                                 ,J '-' ,·\n                                                                                                                             ,~rs ,tfY\n                      see also Exhibit A at 2-4. These acts of defiance are what initiated the use of force and were         1' /\n\n\n                      ~in          order to regain compliance and the safe transport of the Plaintiff.\n\n                              The third Hudson factor discussed relates to the relationship between the need and the\n\n                      amount of force used. The officers involved used the minimum amount of force necessary to\n\n\n\n              /                                                                                          ----\n                      control Plaintiff in response to Plaintiffs acts of misconduct and defiance. Plaintiff refused to\n\n          ~ ~ iJ- relinquish his hand restraints when instructed by the officers and he used his mattress as a physical\n   xy};(\\~r\n                  4\n\n\n\n      rf'' _, ~       deterrent to promote his non-compliance. In such a case, force was necessary to regain control of\n·~0\"-..j-+\n.r'                   Plaintiff.\n\n                              The final two Hudson factors deal with the threat perceived and the efforts made to temper\n\n                      the severity of the response. As admitted by the Plaintiff, he refused to comply with several orders\n\n                      from the officers for transport and even used his bed as a barrier between himself and the officers.\n\n                      Given that the officers' line of sight was presumably obstructed and Plaintiff continuously refused\n\n                      to comply with orders to be searched and have hand restraints applied, force was reasonable,\n\n                      necessary, and administered in a manner to effectuate safe transport of the Plaintiff despite his\n\n                      non-compliance.\n\n                              When viewed in its totality, the evidence presented fails to support Plaintiffs alleged\n\n                      violations to his Eighth Amendment rights; therefore, Plaintiff is not reasonably likely to succeed\n\n                      on his excessive use of force claim.\n\n                              2. There is no reasonable probability that Plaintiff will prevail on his bystander\n                                 liability claim.\n\n                              Plaintiff alleges that Defendants Vaughn and Emsoff were deliberately indifferent to the\n\n                      use of force and deliberately allowed excessive force to occur. Plaintiff's Fourth Amended\n\n\n                                                                       7\n\fComplaint at 4. Plaintiff never contends that Defendants Vaughn and Emsoff actually participated\n\nin the use of force. Bystander liability exists only when an officer \"(1) knows that a fellow officer\n\nis violating an individual's constitutional rights; (2) has a reasonable opportunity to prevent the\n\nharm; and (3) chooses not to act.\" Kitchen v. Dallas County, Tex., 759 F.3d 468, 480 (5th Cir.\n\n2014). The plaintiff must be able to allege and prove \"another officer's use of excessive force\" in\n\norder to establish a (ause of actio~ under bystander liability. I d. Additionally, even if an officer is\n\npresent during the relevant events, the plaintiff must show that the officer \"had a reasonable\n\nopportunity to realize the excessive nature of the force and to intervene to stop it.\" Hale v. Townley,\n\n45 F.3d 914,919 (5th Cir. 1995).\n\n        For reasons discussed the previous section, there is no reasonable probability that Plaintiff\n\nwill succeed on the merits of his excessive use of fcrce claim. Thus, because a constitutional\n\nviolation is an essential underlying element of bystander liability, there is also no reasonable\n\nprobability that Plaintiff will succeed on his bystander liability claim.\n\n        3. Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity.\n\n        Defendants were employed by TDCJ at all times relevant to the allegations in Plaintiffs\n\npetitions. Defendants asserted their entitlement to qualified immunity in their answers and are\n\nentitled to the protections afforded   b~   that affirmative defense. The Amarillo Court of Appeals\n\nheld that it was error to dismiss the original proceedings based on \"the sufficiency of Jackson's\n\npleadings vis-a-vis the official immunity claim of Vaughn and Emsoff.\" Jackson, 2014 WL\n\n6999333 at *9. However, because Defendants Honesto, Nail, and Guzman did not answer prior to\n\nthe case being appealed to the Amarillo Court of Ap1,eals, they have never argued the issue of\n\nqualified immunity as it applies to them. Additionally, because the bystander liability claim was\n\nnever explicitly plead or briefed on appeal nor was it addressed in the Court's original Findings of\n\n\n\n                                                   8\n\f       Fact and Conclusions of Law, Defendants Emsoff and Vaughn have not yet addressed the issue of\n\n       qualified immunity as it pertains to Plaintiff's bystander liability claim.\n\n               In order to overcome a defendant's entitlement to qualified immunity, a plaintiff must\n\n       satisfy a three-part test. Kipps v. Callier, 197 F.3d 765, 768 (5th Cir. 1999) (citing Morris v.\n\n       Dearborne, 181 F.3d 657, 665 (5th Cir. 1999)). First, the plaintiff must allege the deprivation of a\n\n       constitutional right. Wilson v. Layne, 526 U.S. 603,603 (1999); see also Morris v. Dearborne, 181\n\n       F.3d 657,665 (5th Cir. 1999). Second, the plaintiffmust allege the violation of a right that was\n\n 1..   clearly established at the time of the alleged violation. Wilson, 526 U.S. at 603. Finally, the plaintiff\n\n-d     \\§'ust producif competent summary judgment evidence which demonstrates that the violation\n\n       occurred or at least gives rise to a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the defendant actually\n\n       engaged in the conduct that violated the clearly established right. Kipps, 197 F.3d at 768. If the\n\n       plaintiff meets this burden, then the court must decide whether the conduct was nonetheless\n\n       \"objectively reasonable.\" Eugene v. AliefiSD, 65 F.3d 1299, 1305 (5th Cir. 1995). A plaintiff fails\n\n       to satisfy either of these requirements with conclusory allegations of wrongdoing. Geter v.\n\n       Fortenberry, 849 F.2d 1550, 1553 (5th Cir. 1988).\n\n               As detailed above, Plaintiff's claims are substantively deficient and he has: 1) Plaintiff has\n\n       not suffered, a physical injury as required by Hudson; 2) Plaintiff's excessive use of force claim\n\n       against Defendants fails to withstand constitutional scrutiny when analyzed under the factors\n\n       delineated in Hudson and Wilkins; and 3) Plaintiff's bystander liability claims fails because there\n\n       was no underlying constitutional violation of Plaintiff's rights of which Defendants Emsoff and\n\n       Vaughn were aware. For these reasons, the Defendants' entitlement to qualified immunity is\n\n       preserved and therefore, Plaintiff has no reasonable probability of success on his claims.\n\n              As shown above, Plaintiff's claims fail constitu·:ional scrutiny. Therefore, the Plaintiffhas\n\n\n\n                                                         9\n\fnot cleared the first hurdle of the qualified immunity analysis. However, even if the Court could\n\nfind that there was a violation of the Plaintiffs constitutional rights, it must still determine whether\n\nthe Defendants' actions were objectively unreasonable in light of the law as it existed at the time\n\nthe conduct occurred and in light of the information that the defendant possessed. Assuming\n\narguendo that Defendants violated Plaintiffs constitutional rights, their actions were objectively\n\nreasonable. For this independent reason, Defendants arlo! entitled to qualified immunity.\n\n          Foremost, as supported by the attached evidence, Plaintiff has not suffered an injury within\n\nthe framework of the constitution that would incite its protection. Furthermore, Plaintiff himself\n\nadmitted that he was committed several defiant acts, which lead to the need for an extraction team.\n\nTherefore, any force, if used, was reasonably applied in an effort to regain compliance.\n\n          In total, the Plaintiff has offered only conclusory allegations which are not sufficient to\n\nshow a reasonable probability of success on the merits of his claims. Defendants have also\n\nprovided evidence that shows that there is not a reasonable probability that Plaintiff will prevail in\n\nthe litigation. Thus, Defendants have met the first prong of the test to determine whether Plaintiff\n\nis a vexatious litigant.\n\n    F. Plaintiff's Previous Litigation\n\n         In the past seven years, Plaintiff has filed more than five litigations and appeals, proceeding\n\npro se, which have been finally determined adversely against him or dismissed as groundless or\n\nfrivolous. 2 The following six suits have been dismissed as groundless or frivolous: (1) Jackson v.\n\nDarryl Glenn, 2:14-cv-0036 (N.D. Amarillo Division) was dismissed on July 2, 2014 as frivolous\n\nand for failure to state a claim (See Exhibit C); (2) Jackson v. John Adams, et al., 2:10-cv-0261\n\n\n2 While Plaintiff has already been declared\n                                               vexatious by the 25lst District Court in Potter County on June 26, 2013\nand is now subject to a prefiling order (See Exhibit I), this prefiling order does not apply to the current litigation since\nit was filed prior to the prefiling order being signed.\n\n\n\n                                                            10\n\f(N.D. Amarillo Division) was dismissed on June 15, 2011 as frivolous and for failure to state a\n\nclaim (See Exhibit D at 6); (3) Jackson v. Rick Thaler, et al., No. 25,403 (278th District Court of\n\nWalker County) was dismissed on August 2, 2011 as frivolous (See Exhibit E, Memorandum\n\nOpinion from the Appeal in the Tenth Court of Appeals at 1-2); (4) Jackson v. Boland, et al., No.\n\n2:12-cv-0212 (N.D. Amarillo Division) was partially dismissed against Defendant G. David as\n\nfrivolous and for failure to state a claim on January 14, 2013 (See Exhibit F); (5) Jackson v. Mark\n\nW Stiles Unit, et al., No. E-0189936 (172nd District Court of Jefferson County) was dismissed on\n\nJanuary 6, 2012 as frivolous (See Exhibit G); (6) Jackson v. State of Texas, No. 11-E-0255-C\n\n(130th District Court of Matagorda County, Texas) was dismissed on April21, 2011 as having no\n\narguable basis in law (See Exhibit H).\n\n       Thus, Plaintiff clearly fits the statutory definition of a vexatious litigant for this suit as well.\n\nTherefore, the Court should order him to furnish security and his case should be dismissed if this\n\nsecurity is not timely paid.\n\n                                              Conclusion\n\n       Because Plaintiff does not have a reasonable probability of prevailing on his claims and\n\nbecause Plaintiff has commenced at least five lawsuits prose in the seven-year period immediately\n\npreceding the date of this motion, the Court, after notice and a hearing, should order plaintiff to\n\nprovide security to defendant to cover reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the\n\nlitigation, including costs and attorney fees.

He was housed in the Western Regional Medical Facility, AS-1. The\n    offender had no property at this unit. Warden Tucker was contacted and authorized the use of a\n    move team to place the offender on the chain bus by force if necessary. Chemical agents were\n    not authorized since the chain bus operator will not allow offenders on the bus who have been\n    exposed to chemical agents. A move team was assembled consisting of Officers: 1) Nail vest 9,\n    Ortega vest 12, Guzman vest 8. A. Martinez vest 13, Honesto vest 5 and Officer Mayne\n    operating the video camera. Sgt. Villegas briefed the camera and mistakenly stated chemical\n    agents were authorized. Staff went to the cell. Sgt. Villegas ordered Offender Jackson to submit\n    to a strip search and the application of hand restraints or chemical agents and/or the move team\n    would be used (although chemical agents would not be used). Offender Jackson refused and\n    stated he was not leaving until he had his property. Nurse Reese attempted verbal intervention\n    without success. Sgt. Villegas again repeated his orders and warnings. The offender did not\n    comply and placed a mattress in front of himself. Sgt. Villegas opened the cell door, the team\n    entered the eel} and Offender Jackson pushed team members past him. Team members were able\n    to grab Offender Jackson and force him to the floor.\"~er a brief struggle team members were\n ,- able ~y hand and leg restraints. Once restraints h1d been applied Offender Jackson stopped\n··. resisting. Team members placea Offender Jackson in a sitting position, released the hand\n    restraints and reapplied them in front of his body. Team members released the leg restraints and\n    applied a chain. The lockbox and box was applied. Offender Jackson then refused to stand and\n    walk stating his leg was broken. Team members lifted Offender Jackson and placed him on a\n    gurney. Offender Jackson was then transported to the sally port. Arriving at the chain bus he\n    refused to stand and walk. Team members lifted Offender Jackson. carried him onto the bus and\n     placed him in a seat. The interior door was secured. The team exited the bus. The offender stated\n     his back and neck were injured. Nurse Reese visually assessed the offender and noted no visual\n     injury. Sgt. Villegas then took photos through the caged door. Sgt. Villegas then read the\n     offender participant statement and Offender Jackson stated he wanted to make a written\n     statement. Sgt. Villegas then concluded the use of force and the video camera was turned off.\n\n  FINDINGS: This use of force underwent a Fact-Finding Inquiry because the offender alleged he\n  was kicked and kneed in the head. Secondly, this action could not be confirmed or dismissed*\n  since the video camera wasnot on wide angle and could not be fully seen when viewing the\n  video tape.\n\n  Move team members were interviewed regarding their specific roles in this incident. All denied\n  the offender was struck or kneed during this use of force and did not see any other move team\n  member accomplish this action. Based on the offender's behavior during this incident and a lack\n  of evidence to support his account of the action's takert by staff, I do not feel any further action is\n  necessary with respect to this particular finding.\n\n  After the video camera was first turned on, Sgt. Villegas had Officer Mayne check the camera to\n  ensure it was on wide angle. During her manipulation of the camera's settings, which were\n  correct before she began to make readjustments, she zoomed the lens without returning it to the\n  wide angle setting, which significantly detracted from completely viewing the action taken\n\n\n                                                                                                   jackson0002\n                                                                                                                 I\n\fI find no action to intentionally conceal what took place\n                                                             with this offender regarding the use of\nthe video camera. I do however feel Officer Mayne shoul\n                                                             d undergo remedial training in the use\nof the video camera however, to lessen the likelihoa ·1 of\n                                                           this finding recurring.

Inmate\n\nLANDRUM did not pay the filing fee nor did he submit an application to proceed in forma\n\npauperis.

The response period\n\nhas expired, and no response has been received. It appears inmate LANDRUM has abandoned\n\nthis cause and his claims should be dismissed for failure to prosecute.\n\f        Case 2:10-cv-00261-J-BB Document 9 Filed 06/15/11                   Page 2 of 6 PageiD 74\n\n\n\n                     On May 9, 20 11, an Order to Cure Deficiencies by Amended Complaint and\n                                                                                               Findings,\n   Conclusions and Recommendation issued in the instant cause, informing plainti\n                                                                                 ff       JACKSON of\n   the deficiencies in his original complaint and ordering him to cure by filing\n                                                                                    an amended\n   complaint or to file objections to the Findings, ConClusions and Recommenda\n                                                                              tion.\n                 Plaintiff filed his Amended Complaint on May 20, 2011.\n\n                 By his Amended Complaint, plaintiff JACKSON alleges he has been prosec\n                                                                                       uted for acts\n  which constitute crimes under Texas state law, but that these prosecutions\n                                                                                  have been handled by\n  defendants through the disciplinary process of the Text1S prison system.

See TEx. Civ. PRAc. & REM. CODE ANN. § 14.003(a)(2) (West 2002). In\n\nseven issues, appellant, Reidie James Jackson, complains about\n\n                                                                See id. We affirm.l\n\n\n\n\n      1   All pending motions are dismissed as moot.\n\f                                             I.      BACKGROUND\n\n         Jackson is currently incarcerated at the Clements Unit in the Institutional\n\nDivision of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice in Amarillo, Texas. On December\n\n 13,2010, Jackson filed his original petition alleging a claim for false imprisonment based\n\n upon his assertion that he was incarcerated seventy-one days in excess of his 333-day\n\ncriminal sentence. 2 He sought $110,000 in monetary damages and any other relief\n\nnecessary to \"resolve the controversy.\" Thereafter, appellees, Rick Thaler and the Texas\n\nDepartment of Criminal Justice, filed an original answer, asserting immunity and\n\nnumerous affirmative defenses, and a jury demand.3 The Texas Attorney General filed\n\nan amicus curiae brief recommending that Jackson's claim be dismissed for failure to\n\ncomply with chapter 14. See id.\n\n\n\n                                       II.        STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n         Inmate litigation is governed by the procedural rules set forth in chapter 14 of the\n\ncivil practice and remedies code. See id. §§ 14.001-.014 (West 2002 & Supp. 2011); see also\n\nMcBride v. Tex. Bd. of Pardons & Paroles, No. 13-05-559-CV, 2008 Tex. App. LEXIS 1290, at\n\n*6 (Tex. App.-Corpus Christi Feb. 21, 2008, pet. denied) (mem. op.).                           The Texas\n\nLegislature enacted chapter 14 to control the flood of lawsuits filed in state courts by\n\n\n\n         2 Apparently, at some point, Jackson was released from prison, though the precise date is unclear\nbased on this record. His complaint pertains to a June 9, 1999 conviction for possession of a controlled\nsubstance, which resulted in a three-year prison sentence with 333 days of time credited. In any event, he\nis currently incarcerated based upon a separate criminal off-o nse.\n\n        3 In one of his numerous motions filed in the trial court. Jackson identified Thaler as the Director\nof the Texas Department of Criminal Justice.\n\nJackson v. Thaler                                                                                    Page2\n\f                                                                                                   ~--=\n\n\n\n\nprison inmates, which consume valuable judicial resources with seemingly little\n\n offsetting benefit. Hickson v. Moya, 926 S.W.2d 397, 399 (Tex. App.-Waco 1996, no\n\n writ). This Court has noted:\n\n         Prisoners have everything to gain and little to lose by filing frivolous suits.\n         It costs them almost nothing; time is of JlO consequence to a prisoner;\n         threats of sanctions are virtually meaningless; and the prisoner can look\n         forward to a day trip to the courthouse. Thus, the temptation to file a\n         frivolous suit is strong. Such suits, however, waste valuable resources\n         and subject the state and its prison officials to the burden of unwarranted\n         litigation, preventing claims with merit from being heard expeditiously.\n\nId. (internal citations omitted) (citing Spellman v. Sweeney, 819 S.W.2d 206, 209 (Tex.\n\nApp.-Waco 1991, no writ)).\n\n        Generally, the dismissal of inmate litigation under chapter 14 is reviewed for\n\nabuse of discretion. Brewer v. Simental, 268 S.W.3d 763, 767 (Tex. App.-Waco 2008, no\n\npet.). \"To establish an abuse of discretion, an appellant must show the trial court's\n\nactions were arbitrary or unreasonable in light of all the circumstances. The standard is\n\nclarified by asking whether the trial court acted without reference to any guiding rules\n\nor principles.\" Spurlock v. Schroedter, 88 S.W.3d 733,735-36 (Tex. App.-Corpus Christi\n\n2002, pet. denied) (internal citations omitted). We may not substitute our judgment for\n\nthat of the trial court with respect to the resolution of factual issues or matters\n\ncommitted to the trial court's discretion. See In re Spooner, 333 S.W.3d 759, 763 (Tex.\n\nApp.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2010, orig. proceeding); see also Downer v. Aquamarine\n\nOperators, Inc., 701 S.W.2d 238, 242 (Tex. 1985). The judgment of the trial court will be\n\naffirmed if that judgment can be upheld on any reasonable theory supported by the\n\nevidence. Ex parte E.E.H., 869 S.W.2d 496, 497-98 (Tex. App.-Houston [1st Dist.]l993,\n\nJackson v. Thaler                                                                          Page3\n\fwrit denied); Harris County Dist. Attorney's Office v. Burns, 825 S.W.2d 198, 200 (Tex.\n\nApp.-Houston (14th Dist.] 1992, writ denied). And, we consider only the evidence\n\nmost favorable to the judgment, and if there is some evidence to support the judgment,\n\nwe will affirm. State v. Knight, 813 S.W.2d 210, 211 (Tex. App.-Houston [14th Dist.]\n\n1991, no writ).\n\n        The trial court has broad discretion to dismiss an inmate's claim as frivolous.\n\nSchroedter, 88 S.W.3d at 736. In fact, section 14.003 authorizes the trial court to dismiss\n\nan inmate's claim, either before or after service , .f process, if the claim is found to be\n\nfrivolous or malicious. TEX. Civ. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN.§ 14.003(a)(2). To determine\n\nwhether a claim is frivolous, the trial court may consider if: (1) the claim's realistic\n\nchance of ultimate success is slight; (2) the claim has no arguable basis in law or fact; (3)\n\nit is clear that the party cannot prove facts in support of the claim; or (4) the claim is\n\nsubstantially similar to a previous claim filed by the inmate because the claim arises\n\nfrom the same operative facts. Id. § 14.003(b); see Schroedter, 88 S.W.3d at 736.\n\n        Furthermore, the trial court is not required to conduct a hearing before\n\ndismissing a case pursuant to chapter 14. See TEX. Civ.       PRAC. &   REM. CODE ANN.§\n\n14.003(c). Instead, the question of whether to hold a hearing is committed to the trial\n\ncourt's discretion. See id.; see also McCray v. Mulde·, No. 12-10-00349-CV, 2011 Tex. App.\n\nLEXIS 5884, at *10 (Tex. App.-Tyler July 29, 2011, no pet.) (mem. op.) (citing Hamilton\n\nv. Pechacek, 319 S.W.3d 801, 810 (Tex. App.-Fort Worth 2010, no pet.)). Thus, in this\n\ncase, the trial court was not required to provide Jackson with an opportunity to respond\n\nbefore dismissing his claim under section 14.003. See, e.g., Geiger v. Garcia, No. 10-07-\n\nJackson v. Thaler                                                                     Page4\n\f 00404-CV, 2009 Tex. App. LEXIS 7885, at *3 (Te.c App.-Waco Oct. 7, 2009, no pet.)\n\n (citing Gowan v. Tex. Dep't of Criminal Justice, 99 S.W.3d 319,323 (Tex. App.-Texarkana\n\n2003, no pet.)).\n\n                             III.    THE TRIAL COURT'S ORDER OF DISMISSAL\n\n         In his seven issues, Jackson contends that: (1) the trial court erred in dismissing\n\nhis lawsuit because he has a First Amendment right to file suit and because the\n\ndismissal denied him due process; (2) the trial court violated Texas Rule of Civil\n\nProcedure 308 by failing to enforce an order signed on February 9, 20114; (3) the trial\n\ncourt erred by not allowing him to prosecute his claim against the defendants\n\n\n         4   Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 308 provides that:\n\n         The court shall cause its judgments and decrees to be carried into execution; and where\n         the judgment is for personal property, and it is shown by the pleadings and evidence and\n         the verdict, if any, that such property has an especial value to the plaintiff, the court may\n         award a special writ for the seizure and delivery of such property to the plaintiff; and in\n         such case may enforce its judgment by attachment, fine[,} and imprisonment.\n\nTEX. R. Civ. P. 308.\n\n         In the February 9, 2011 order of which Jackson complains, the trial court ordered that the Texas\nAttorney General's Office file an amicus curiae brief within sixty days of receipt of the order. Jackson\nappears to argue that the filing of the amicus curiae brief was not timely ffied. We do not find this\nargument to be meritorious, especially considering the Attorney General's Office ffied its amicus curiae\nbrief on February 28,2011, less than thirty days after the trial court signed its order.\n\n          And, to the extent that Jackson argues that the Attorney General's Office is not authorized to\nrepresent Thaler, we point out that article IV, section 22 of the Texas Constitution provides that the\nAttorney General \"shall represent the State in all suits and pleas in the Supreme Court of the State in\nwhich the State may be a party ... and perform such other duties as may be required by law.\" TEX.\nCONST. art. IV,§ 21; see Brady v. Brooks, 99 Tex. 366,89 S.W. 1052, 1055 (1905). In addition, sections 101.103\nand 104.004 of the civil practice and rem~dies code authorize the Attorney General's Office to defend\npublic servants. See TEX. Civ. PRAC. & REM. CoDE ANN. § 101.103 (West 2011) (stating that the Attorney\nGeneral's Office shall defend each action brought under the Texas Tort Claims Act 1/against a\ngovernmental unit that has authority and jurisdiction coc :tensive with the geographical limits of this\nstate\"); see id. § 104.004 (West 2011) (requiring the Attorney General's Office to defend a public servant\nagainst a suit for damages based upon actions within the scope of the public servant's employment). We\ntherefore find this argument lacking an arguable basis in law as well.\n\n\nJackson v. Thaler                                                                                        PageS\n\fseparately; (4) the trial court was biased and refused him a fair trial; (5) Thaler did not\n\n obey the trial court's orders-in particular, the February 9, 2011 order-and thereby\n\nprejudiced Jackson's case; (6) the trial court erred in dismissing his lawsuit without\n\nnotice and a hearing; and (7) the trial court erred in relying on chapter 14 to analyze his\n\nlawsuit.\n\n         When the trial court dismisses a claim without conducting a fact hearing, which\n\nis the case here, the issue on appeal is whether the claim had an arguable basis in law.\n\nSee Spurlock v. Johnson, 94 S.W.3d 655,658 (Tex. App.-San Antonio 2002, no pet.) (citing\n\nMartin v. Tex. Bd. of Criminal Justice, 60 S.W.3d 226,229 {Tex. App.-Corpu s Christi 2001,\n\nno pet.); Sawyer v. Tex. Dep't of Criminal Justice, 983 S.W.2d 310, 311 (Tex. App.-\n\nHouston [1st Dist.] 1998, pet. denied)). Based on our review of the record, including all\n\nof the briefs and responses he has filed in this Court, we conclude that Jackson's false-\n\nimprisonmen t claim has no arguable basis in law. See TEx. Ov.                      PRAC. & REM. CODE\n\nANN.    § 14.003(b)(2); see also Brewer, 268 S.W.3d at 767; Spurlock, 94 S.W.3d at 658;\n\nSchroedter, 88 S.W.3d at 736. This is true for many reasons, which we will now explain.\n\n        First, the crux of Jackson's underlying lawsuit is that he was wrongfully\n\nincarcerated for a period beyond his judicially-imposed sentence. 5 The United States\n\nSupreme Court has stated that \"Congress has determined that habeas corpus is the\n\n\n        sIn his original petition, Jackson did not reference title 42, section 1983 of the United States Code.\nSee 42 U.S.C. § 1983; see also Spurlock v. Johnson, 94 S.W.3d 655, 658 (Tex. App.-San Antonio 2002, no pet.)\n(\"To determine whether a trial court has properly determined that there is no arguable basis in law for a\nclaim, 'we examine the types of relief and causes of action appellant pleaded in his petition to determine\nwhether, as a matter of law, the petition stated a cause of action that would authorize relief.~~~ (quoting\nJackson v. Tex. Dep't of Criminal Justice-Inst. Div., 28 S.W.3d 811, 813 (Tex. App.-Corpus Christi 2000, pet.\ndenied))).\n\n\nJackson v. Thaler                                                                                     Page6\n\f appropr iate remedy for state prisoners attacking the validity of the fact or length of\n\n their confinement, and that specific determination must override the general terms of\n\n [section] 1983.\" Prieser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475, 490, 93 S. Ct. 1827, 1836, 36 L. Ed. 2d\n\n 439 (1973). Later, in Heck v. Humphrey, the United States Supreme Court clarified that\n\n \"the hoary principle that civil tort actions are not appropriate vehicles for challenging\n\n the validity of outstan ding criminal judgments applies to [section] 1983 damage s\n\n actions that necessarily require the plaintiff to prove the unlawfulness of his conviction\n\n or confinement ....\" 512 U.S. 477, 486, 114 S. O·. 2364, 2372, 129 L. Ed. 2d 383 (1994).\n\n Therefore, because Jackson challenges the validity of the fact and duratio n of his\n\n confinement, the proper remedy is a habeas corpus petition in the federal court. See\n                                                                                      ·\n Heck, 512 U.S. at 486, 114 S. Ct. at 2372; see also Prieser, 411 U.S. at 490,93 S. Ct. at 1836.\n\n         Next, Jackson fails to identify a basis in law for his claim of money damages;\n\n instead, he simply asserts, without explaining, that he should be paid $110,000 in\n\n money damage s for the alleged false imprisonment. Though he cites to the Texas Penal\n\nCode, Texas Constitution, and other avenues for redress, Jackson cannot bring a private\n\ncause of action under these provisions. See TEX. Ov. PRAc. & REM. CODE ANN. § 103.001\n\n(West Supp. 2011) (providing that a person is entitled to compensation if, among other\n\nthings, he served time in prison and has received a full pardon on the basis of innocence\n\nor has been granted relief in accordance with a writ of habeas corpus -none of which\n\napply here); Smith v.

JACKSON 'S REQUESTS FOR FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUS IONS OF LAW\n\n         While we recognize that we are required to review and evaluate pro se pleading s\n\n with liberality and patience, we are also required to apply the same standard s\n\n applicable to pleading s drafted by lawyers. See f.oster v. Williams, 74 S.W.3d 200, 202\n\n(Tex. App.-Texarkana 2002, pet. denied). In light of that, Jackson also appears to argue\n\n\n         6 On appeal, Jackson asserts that Thaler's actions were ultra vires;\n                                                                                  however, in his original\npetition, Jackson did not allege that Thaler acted outside the scope of his employment such that his\nactions were ultra vires. See Franka v. Velasquez, 332 S.W.3d 367, 369 (Tex. 2011) (stating that \"all\n[common-law] tort theories alleged against a governmental unit ... are assumed to be 'under [the Tort\nOaims Act]' for purposes of section 101.106.\" (citing Mission Consol. Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Garcia, 253 S.W.3d\n653, 659 (Tex. 2008))). In addition,\n\n        [i]t is fundamental that a suit against a state official is merely another way of pleading an\n        action against the entity of which [the official] is an agent. A suit against a state official in\n        his official capacity is not a suit against the official personally, for the real party in interest\n        is the entity. Such a suit actually seeks to impose liability against the governmental unit\n        rather than on the individual specifically named and is, in all respects other than\n        name ... a suit against the entity.\n\nId. at 382 n.68 (internal citations & quotations omitted).\n\nJackson v.

See TEX.\n\n R. Crv. P. 297.\n\n         Texas courts have held that, when a trial court renders judgme nt or dismisses a\n\n cause without hearing any evidence, findings of fact are not appropriate.

Jackson filed an unsworn declaration of inability to pay costs with the petition,\n       therefore, TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE, Chapter 14, relating to Inmate Litigation, applies.\n               Chapter 14 authorizes a trial court to dismiss an inmate's claim as frivolous, before\n       or after service of process, if it finds \"(1) the claim's realistic chance of ultimate success is\n       slight; (2) the claim has no arguable basis in law or in fact; (3) it is clear that the party cannot\n       prove facts in support of the claim; or (4) the clair. l is substantially similar to a previous\n       claim filed by the inmate because the claim arises from the same operative facts.\" TEX. CIV.\n       PRA(::. &REM. CODE §14.003(b).\n               The court has determined that the is case may be decided without hearing and\n       therefore accepts Plajntifr s allegations as true. 1 Jackson's claim under Section 1, Article 17,\n       Texas Constitution2 alleges that his property was taken under a search warrant issued on\n       Deputy Keith Sullivan's affidavit. He alleges the affidavit supporting the warrant stated, \"the\n       [confidential informant] advised [Sullivan] that.. .. \" Jackson infers from this that Sullivan's\n       affidavit was not made based on information within Sullivan's personal knowledge, but\n       instead within the confidential informant's personal knowledge. Jackson concludes the\n       search warrant and subsequent search were legally defective.\n\n\n                      Perales v.

On January 6, 2012, Plaintiff filed suit against Defendants\n\nRobert Vaughn and Nicky Emsoff for assault, battery, conspiracy, excessive force, bystander\n\nliability, and violations ofthe Texas Constitution and U.S. Constitution. On December 11, 2014,\n\nthe Amarillo Court of Appeals reversed the trial court judgment dismissing Plaintiff's suit pursuant\n\nto Chapter 14 of the Texas Civil Practice & Remedies Code, and remanded the case. See Jackson\n\nv. Vaughn, 07-13-00022-CV, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2014</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">6999333</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *6 (Tex. App.-Amarillo Dec. 11, 2014, no.\n\npet. h.). The Court of Appeals held that Plaintiff's pleadings sufficiently alleged a Section 1983\n\nexcessive force claim and a bystander claim. !d. On April24, 2015, Defendants Peter Honesto and\n\nJames Nail filed their original answer, and on April27, 2015, Defendants Honesto and Nail, along\n\nwith David Guzman, who was answering for the first time, filed an amended answer. 1\n\n\n\n1\n The counsel for defendants was not made aware until February 4, 2015 that Defendants Honesto, Nail, and\nGuzman had potentially been served back in November 2012.\n\n\n                                                        1\n\f                                     Arguments and Authorities\n\n    A. Vexatious Litigant Statutes\n\n        Chapter 11 of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code contains provisions addressing\n\nvexatious litigants-persons who abuse the legal system by filing numerous, frivolous lawsuits.\n\nSee Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code§§ 11.001-11.104. This chapter provides that on or before the\n\nninetieth day after the defendant files an original answer or makes a special appearance, the\n\ndefendant may move for an order declaring that the plaintiff a vexatious litigant and requiring the\n\nplaintiff to furnish security in order to proceed with 1'1is case. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code §\n\n11.051. Additionally, the court may declare this litigant vexatious on its own motion after notice\n\nand hearing. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code§ 11.202(a); In re Douglas, 333 S.W.3d 273,287 (Tex.\n\nApp.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2010, no pet.).\n\n        On the filing of a motion under§ 11.051, the litigation is stayed until after the motion's\n\ndisposition. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 11.052. If, after hearing the evidence on the motion,\n\nthe Court grants the motion, it \"shall order the plaintiff to furnish security for the benefit of the\n\nmoving defendant\" to be paid by a date determined by the Court. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code§\n\n11.055 (emphasis added). If the plaintiff fails to pay the security within the court's deadline, the\n\ncourt \"shall dismiss [the] litigation.\" Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code§ 11.056 (emphasis added). If\n\nthe plaintiffs suit is subsequently dismissed on the mL ·its, Section 11.057 states that the \"moving\n\ndefendant has recourse to the security ... in an amount determined by the Court.\"\n\n    B. Criteria for Finding a Litigant Vexatious\n\n        Under Section 11.054, a court may find a plaintiff vexatious if the defendant shows that\n\nthere is not a \"reasonable probability\" that the plaintiff will prevail in the present suit. Second, the\n\ndefendant must meet one of three additional requirements. This prong of the vexatious litigant\n\n\n\n                                                   2\n\fanalysis is satisfied by Plaintiffs pro se litigation history. Over the past seven years, Plaintiff has\n\n\"commenced, prosecuted, or maintained at least five litigations as a pro se litigant ... that have\n\nbeen: (A) finally determined adversely to the Plaintiff; (B) permitted to remain pending for at least\n\ntwo years without [proceeding] to trial or hearing; or (C) determined ... to be frivolous or\n\ngroundless.\" See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code§ 11.054(1).\n\n    C. Effect of Declaring Plaintiff to be Vexatious\n\n        Because Offender Reidie James Jackson fits the statutory definition of a vexatious litigant,\n\nthis court should require him \"to furnish security for the benefit of the moving defendant\" and\n\n\"dismiss [this suit if he] does not furnish the security within the time set by the order.\" Tex. Civ.\n\nPrac. & Rem. Code § 11.055-56. If his suit is subsequently dismissed on the merits, Section 11.057\n\nrequires that Defendants \"have recourse to the security ... in an amount determined by the Court.\"\n\n    D. Notice of Stay of Proceedings\n\n        Upon the filing of this motion, the present \"litiJation is stayed and the moving defendant\n\nis not required to plead\" until10 days after the motion is denied or 10 days after the Plaintiff has\n\nfurnished security in accordance with the Court's order. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code§ 11.052.\n\n    E. No Reasonable Probability of Success on the Merits.\n\n        Before finding a plaintiff a vexatious litigant, the defendant must show that \"there is not a\n\nreasonable probability that the plaintiff will prevail in the litigation against the defendant.\" See\n\nTex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 11.054. \"Undertaking [this] inquiry implicitly requires the trial\n\ncourt to preliminarily accept the factual assertions as true and assess whether they comprise a\n\nviable cause of action.\" Lagaite v.

The Court\n\nin Hudson also noted that the Eighth Amendment's prohibition       o~ cruel   and unusual punishment\n\n\"necessarily excludes from constitutional recognition de minimis uses of physical force, provided\n\nthat the use of force is not of a sort repugnant to the conscience of mankind.\" !d. at 10 (internal\n\nquotations omitted); see also Siglar v.

Hudson, 503 U.S. at 7. The Hudson factors include: (1)\n\nthe extent of the injury suffered; (2) the need for the application of force; (3) the relationship\n\nbetween the need and the amount of force used; (4) the threat reasonably perceived by the\n\nresponsible officials; and (5) any efforts made to temper the severity of a forceful response.

Plaintiff cannot satisfy\n\nthe five Hudson   8     that he must prove in order to support his use of force claim.\n\n        First, Plaintiff has not shown an injury. In Brown v.

The Fifth Circuit held in that case that injuries are insufficient to support an\n\nexcessive force claim where there is no physical injury, or where the injury is extremely minor,\n\nsuch as a bruise caused by having one's ear twisted. Id. at 387. Additionally, civil rights plaintiffs\n\nmust allege an actual injury caused by the defendants' actions. Wilkins v.

Oglesby, 910 F.2d 278,281-82 (5th Cir. 1990).\n\n        In Williams, an offender accused an officer of using excessive force in violation of his\n\nEighth Amendment rights. Williams v. Thompson, No. 5:11-cv-68, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S. Dist. LEXIS</span> <span class=\"page\">25302</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\nat *2-3 (E.D. Tex. Feb. 27, 2012). More specifically, the offender alleged that the officer hit him\n\nover the head with a flashlight so hard that he was knocked unconscious. Id. at *6. The medical\n\nrecords, however, did not show that the offender had a bruise, knot, or any injury associated with\n\nhis allegation of excessive force. Id. The Court held, that since the objective medical records did\n\nnot show that the offender suffered an injury, his claims were dismissed in line with the Supreme\n\nCourt's holding in Wilkins. Id. at *7.\n\n        Plaintiff has not suffered an injury or provided proof of an injury outside of his conclusory\n\nself-serving statements. See, e.g., Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint at 14 (\"Every [sic] since\n\nthe incident Plaintiff has been having progressively blurred vision, his real tooth along with his\n\ntemporary dental plate suffered chips and breakage.\"), Plaintiff's Third Amended Complaint at 6\n\n(\"Plaintiff was permanently injured.\"). Moreover, a review of the relevant portions of the medical\n\nreport contained in the Use of Force Report indicate that at the time of the event Plaintiff\n\ncomplained of back injury, yet upon examination no injuries were found. Exhibit A at 4-6.\n\nAdditionally, the medical records for the relevant time period do not show that the Plaintiff\n\nsubmitted any sick call requests or saw a clinician for his alleged injuries. Exhibit B at 7. Given\n\nthat Plaintiff did not suffer any injuries or has not presented credible evidence of his injuries, there\n\nis no reasonable probability that Plaintiffwill prevail in his excessive use of force claim.\n\n        The next Hudson factor discussed is the need for the application of force. In his second\n\namended complaint, Plaintiff states that he committed several defiant acts that caused force to be\n\nused: he refused the initial preparation and transport; '1e refused to relinquish the handcuffs and\n\n\n\n                                                   6\n\f                      follow commands of the officers; and he placed his mattress in front of the entrance of his cell\n                                                                                                                                             ,(-!\n\n                      door in order to obstruct the officers' path. Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint at pages 10-12;              ·9·tK\n                                                                                                                                 ,J '-' ,·\n                                                                                                                             ,~rs ,tfY\n                      see also Exhibit A at 2-4. These acts of defiance are what initiated the use of force and were         1' /\n\n\n                      ~in          order to regain compliance and the safe transport of the Plaintiff.\n\n                              The third Hudson factor discussed relates to the relationship between the need and the\n\n                      amount of force used. The officers involved used the minimum amount of force necessary to\n\n\n\n              /                                                                                          ----\n                      control Plaintiff in response to Plaintiffs acts of misconduct and defiance. Plaintiff refused to\n\n          ~ ~ iJ- relinquish his hand restraints when instructed by the officers and he used his mattress as a physical\n   xy};(\\~r\n                  4\n\n\n\n      rf'' _, ~       deterrent to promote his non-compliance. In such a case, force was necessary to regain control of\n·~0\"-..j-+\n.r'                   Plaintiff.\n\n                              The final two Hudson factors deal with the threat perceived and the efforts made to temper\n\n                      the severity of the response. As admitted by the Plaintiff, he refused to comply with several orders\n\n                      from the officers for transport and even used his bed as a barrier between himself and the officers.\n\n                      Given that the officers' line of sight was presumably obstructed and Plaintiff continuously refused\n\n                      to comply with orders to be searched and have hand restraints applied, force was reasonable,\n\n                      necessary, and administered in a manner to effectuate safe transport of the Plaintiff despite his\n\n                      non-compliance.\n\n                              When viewed in its totality, the evidence presented fails to support Plaintiffs alleged\n\n                      violations to his Eighth Amendment rights; therefore, Plaintiff is not reasonably likely to succeed\n\n                      on his excessive use of force claim.\n\n                              2. There is no reasonable probability that Plaintiff will prevail on his bystander\n                                 liability claim.\n\n                              Plaintiff alleges that Defendants Vaughn and Emsoff were deliberately indifferent to the\n\n                      use of force and deliberately allowed excessive force to occur. Plaintiff's Fourth Amended\n\n\n                                                                       7\n\fComplaint at 4. Plaintiff never contends that Defendants Vaughn and Emsoff actually participated\n\nin the use of force. Bystander liability exists only when an officer \"(1) knows that a fellow officer\n\nis violating an individual's constitutional rights; (2) has a reasonable opportunity to prevent the\n\nharm; and (3) chooses not to act.\" Kitchen v. Dallas County, Tex., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">759</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">468</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 480 (5th Cir.\n\n2014). The plaintiff must be able to allege and prove \"another officer's use of excessive force\" in\n\norder to establish a (ause of actio~ under bystander liability. I d. Additionally, even if an officer is\n\npresent during the relevant events, the plaintiff must show that the officer \"had a reasonable\n\nopportunity to realize the excessive nature of the force and to intervene to stop it.\" Hale v. Townley,\n\n45 F.3d 914,919 (5th Cir. 1995).\n\n        For reasons discussed the previous section, there is no reasonable probability that Plaintiff\n\nwill succeed on the merits of his excessive use of fcrce claim. Thus, because a constitutional\n\nviolation is an essential underlying element of bystander liability, there is also no reasonable\n\nprobability that Plaintiff will succeed on his bystander liability claim.\n\n        3. Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity.\n\n        Defendants were employed by TDCJ at all times relevant to the allegations in Plaintiffs\n\npetitions. Defendants asserted their entitlement to qualified immunity in their answers and are\n\nentitled to the protections afforded   b~   that affirmative defense. The Amarillo Court of Appeals\n\nheld that it was error to dismiss the original proceedings based on \"the sufficiency of Jackson's\n\npleadings vis-a-vis the official immunity claim of Vaughn and Emsoff.\" Jackson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2014</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">6999333</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at *9. However, because Defendants Honesto, Nail, and Guzman did not answer prior to\n\nthe case being appealed to the Amarillo Court of Ap1,eals, they have never argued the issue of\n\nqualified immunity as it applies to them. Additionally, because the bystander liability claim was\n\nnever explicitly plead or briefed on appeal nor was it addressed in the Court's original Findings of\n\n\n\n                                                   8\n\f       Fact and Conclusions of Law, Defendants Emsoff and Vaughn have not yet addressed the issue of\n\n       qualified immunity as it pertains to Plaintiff's bystander liability claim.\n\n               In order to overcome a defendant's entitlement to qualified immunity, a plaintiff must\n\n       satisfy a three-part test. Kipps v. Callier, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766890\"><a href=\"/opinion/766890/rexford-kipps-carol-kipps-and-kyle-kipps-v-james-caillier-ray-authement/\"><span class=\"volume\">197</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">765</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 768 (5th Cir. 1999) (citing Morris v.\n\n       Dearborne, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"18053\"><a href=\"/opinion/18053/morris-v-dearborne/\"><span class=\"volume\">181</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">657</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 665 (5th Cir. 1999)). First, the plaintiff must allege the deprivation of a\n\n       constitutional right. Wilson v. Layne, 526 U.S. 603,603 (1999); see also Morris v. Dearborne, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"18053\"><a href=\"/opinion/18053/morris-v-dearborne/\"><span class=\"volume\">181</span>\n\n       <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">657</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,665 (5th Cir. 1999). Second, the plaintiffmust allege the violation of a right that was\n\n 1..   clearly established at the time of the alleged violation. Wilson, 526 U.S. at 603. Finally, the plaintiff\n\n-d     \\§'ust producif competent summary judgment evidence which demonstrates that the violation\n\n       occurred or at least gives rise to a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the defendant actually\n\n       engaged in the conduct that violated the clearly established right. Kipps, 197 F.3d at 768. If the\n\n       plaintiff meets this burden, then the court must decide whether the conduct was nonetheless\n\n       \"objectively reasonable.\" Eugene v. AliefiSD, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"704007\"><a href=\"/opinion/704007/beryl-eugene-v-alief-independent-school-district-paula-conley-and-rf/\"><span class=\"volume\">65</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1299</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1305 (5th Cir. 1995). A plaintiff fails\n\n       to satisfy either of these requirements with conclusory allegations of wrongdoing. Geter v.\n\n       Fortenberry, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"508144\"><a href=\"/opinion/508144/lenell-geter-v-james-fortenberry-henry-wade-randall-isenberg-county-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">849</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1550</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1553 (5th Cir. 1988).\n\n               As detailed above, Plaintiff's claims are substantively deficient and he has: 1) Plaintiff has\n\n       not suffered, a physical injury as required by Hudson; 2) Plaintiff's excessive use of force claim\n\n       against Defendants fails to withstand constitutional scrutiny when analyzed under the factors\n\n       delineated in Hudson and Wilkins; and 3) Plaintiff's bystander liability claims fails because there\n\n       was no underlying constitutional violation of Plaintiff's rights of which Defendants Emsoff and\n\n       Vaughn were aware. For these reasons, the Defendants' entitlement to qualified immunity is\n\n       preserved and therefore, Plaintiff has no reasonable probability of success on his claims.\n\n              As shown above, Plaintiff's claims fail constitu·:ional scrutiny. Therefore, the Plaintiffhas\n\n\n\n                                                         9\n\fnot cleared the first hurdle of the qualified immunity analysis. However, even if the Court could\n\nfind that there was a violation of the Plaintiffs constitutional rights, it must still determine whether\n\nthe Defendants' actions were objectively unreasonable in light of the law as it existed at the time\n\nthe conduct occurred and in light of the information that the defendant possessed. Assuming\n\narguendo that Defendants violated Plaintiffs constitutional rights, their actions were objectively\n\nreasonable. For this independent reason, Defendants arlo! entitled to qualified immunity.\n\n          Foremost, as supported by the attached evidence, Plaintiff has not suffered an injury within\n\nthe framework of the constitution that would incite its protection. Furthermore, Plaintiff himself\n\nadmitted that he was committed several defiant acts, which lead to the need for an extraction team.\n\nTherefore, any force, if used, was reasonably applied in an effort to regain compliance.\n\n          In total, the Plaintiff has offered only conclusory allegations which are not sufficient to\n\nshow a reasonable probability of success on the merits of his claims. Defendants have also\n\nprovided evidence that shows that there is not a reasonable probability that Plaintiff will prevail in\n\nthe litigation. Thus, Defendants have met the first prong of the test to determine whether Plaintiff\n\nis a vexatious litigant.\n\n    F. Plaintiff's Previous Litigation\n\n         In the past seven years, Plaintiff has filed more than five litigations and appeals, proceeding\n\npro se, which have been finally determined adversely against him or dismissed as groundless or\n\nfrivolous. 2 The following six suits have been dismissed as groundless or frivolous: (1) Jackson v.\n\nDarryl Glenn, 2:14-cv-0036 (N.D. Amarillo Division) was dismissed on July 2, 2014 as frivolous\n\nand for failure to state a claim (See Exhibit C); (2) Jackson v. John Adams, et al., 2:10-cv-0261\n\n\n2 While Plaintiff has already been declared\n                                               vexatious by the 25lst District Court in Potter County on June 26, 2013\nand is now subject to a prefiling order (See Exhibit I), this prefiling order does not apply to the current litigation since\nit was filed prior to the prefiling order being signed.\n\n\n\n                                                            10\n\f(N.D. Amarillo Division) was dismissed on June 15, 2011 as frivolous and for failure to state a\n\nclaim (See Exhibit D at 6); (3) Jackson v. Rick Thaler, et al., No. 25,403 (278th District Court of\n\nWalker County) was dismissed on August 2, 2011 as frivolous (See Exhibit E, Memorandum\n\nOpinion from the Appeal in the Tenth Court of Appeals at 1-2); (4) Jackson v. Boland, et al., No.\n\n2:12-cv-0212 (N.D. Amarillo Division) was partially dismissed against Defendant G. David as\n\nfrivolous and for failure to state a claim on January 14, 2013 (See Exhibit F); (5) Jackson v. Mark\n\nW Stiles Unit, et al., No. E-0189936 (172nd District Court of Jefferson County) was dismissed on\n\nJanuary 6, 2012 as frivolous (See Exhibit G); (6) Jackson v. State of Texas, No. 11-E-0255-C\n\n(130th District Court of Matagorda County, Texas) was dismissed on April21, 2011 as having no\n\narguable basis in law (See Exhibit H).\n\n       Thus, Plaintiff clearly fits the statutory definition of a vexatious litigant for this suit as well.\n\nTherefore, the Court should order him to furnish security and his case should be dismissed if this\n\nsecurity is not timely paid.\n\n                                              Conclusion\n\n       Because Plaintiff does not have a reasonable probability of prevailing on his claims and\n\nbecause Plaintiff has commenced at least five lawsuits prose in the seven-year period immediately\n\npreceding the date of this motion, the Court, after notice and a hearing, should order plaintiff to\n\nprovide security to defendant to cover reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the\n\nlitigation, including costs and attorney fees.

He was housed in the Western Regional Medical Facility, AS-1. The\n    offender had no property at this unit. Warden Tucker was contacted and authorized the use of a\n    move team to place the offender on the chain bus by force if necessary. Chemical agents were\n    not authorized since the chain bus operator will not allow offenders on the bus who have been\n    exposed to chemical agents. A move team was assembled consisting of Officers: 1) Nail vest 9,\n    Ortega vest 12, Guzman vest 8. A. Martinez vest 13, Honesto vest 5 and Officer Mayne\n    operating the video camera. Sgt. Villegas briefed the camera and mistakenly stated chemical\n    agents were authorized. Staff went to the cell. Sgt. Villegas ordered Offender Jackson to submit\n    to a strip search and the application of hand restraints or chemical agents and/or the move team\n    would be used (although chemical agents would not be used). Offender Jackson refused and\n    stated he was not leaving until he had his property. Nurse Reese attempted verbal intervention\n    without success. Sgt. Villegas again repeated his orders and warnings. The offender did not\n    comply and placed a mattress in front of himself. Sgt. Villegas opened the cell door, the team\n    entered the eel} and Offender Jackson pushed team members past him. Team members were able\n    to grab Offender Jackson and force him to the floor.\"~er a brief struggle team members were\n ,- able ~y hand and leg restraints. Once restraints h1d been applied Offender Jackson stopped\n··. resisting. Team members placea Offender Jackson in a sitting position, released the hand\n    restraints and reapplied them in front of his body. Team members released the leg restraints and\n    applied a chain. The lockbox and box was applied. Offender Jackson then refused to stand and\n    walk stating his leg was broken. Team members lifted Offender Jackson and placed him on a\n    gurney. Offender Jackson was then transported to the sally port. Arriving at the chain bus he\n    refused to stand and walk. Team members lifted Offender Jackson. carried him onto the bus and\n     placed him in a seat. The interior door was secured. The team exited the bus. The offender stated\n     his back and neck were injured. Nurse Reese visually assessed the offender and noted no visual\n     injury. Sgt. Villegas then took photos through the caged door. Sgt. Villegas then read the\n     offender participant statement and Offender Jackson stated he wanted to make a written\n     statement. Sgt. Villegas then concluded the use of force and the video camera was turned off.\n\n  FINDINGS: This use of force underwent a Fact-Finding Inquiry because the offender alleged he\n  was kicked and kneed in the head. Secondly, this action could not be confirmed or dismissed*\n  since the video camera wasnot on wide angle and could not be fully seen when viewing the\n  video tape.\n\n  Move team members were interviewed regarding their specific roles in this incident. All denied\n  the offender was struck or kneed during this use of force and did not see any other move team\n  member accomplish this action. Based on the offender's behavior during this incident and a lack\n  of evidence to support his account of the action's takert by staff, I do not feel any further action is\n  necessary with respect to this particular finding.\n\n  After the video camera was first turned on, Sgt. Villegas had Officer Mayne check the camera to\n  ensure it was on wide angle. During her manipulation of the camera's settings, which were\n  correct before she began to make readjustments, she zoomed the lens without returning it to the\n  wide angle setting, which significantly detracted from completely viewing the action taken\n\n\n                                                                                                   jackson0002\n                                                                                                                 I\n\fI find no action to intentionally conceal what took place\n                                                             with this offender regarding the use of\nthe video camera.

Inmate\n\nLANDRUM did not pay the filing fee nor did he submit an application to proceed in forma\n\npauperis.

The response period\n\nhas expired, and no response has been received. It appears inmate LANDRUM has abandoned\n\nthis cause and his claims should be dismissed for failure to prosecute.\n\f        Case 2:10-cv-00261-J-BB Document 9 Filed 06/15/11                   Page 2 of 6 PageiD 74\n\n\n\n                     On May 9, 20 11, an Order to Cure Deficiencies by Amended Complaint and\n                                                                                               Findings,\n   Conclusions and Recommendation issued in the instant cause, informing plainti\n                                                                                 ff       JACKSON of\n   the deficiencies in his original complaint and ordering him to cure by filing\n                                                                                    an amended\n   complaint or to file objections to the Findings, ConClusions and Recommenda\n                                                                              tion.\n                 Plaintiff filed his Amended Complaint on May 20, 2011.\n\n                 By his Amended Complaint, plaintiff JACKSON alleges he has been prosec\n                                                                                       uted for acts\n  which constitute crimes under Texas state law, but that these prosecutions\n                                                                                  have been handled by\n  defendants through the disciplinary process of the Text1S prison system.

See TEx. Civ. PRAc. & REM. CODE ANN. § 14.003(a)(2) (West 2002). In\n\nseven issues, appellant, Reidie James Jackson, complains about\n\n                                                                See id.

BACKGROUND\n\n         Jackson is currently incarcerated at the Clements Unit in the Institutional\n\nDivision of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice in Amarillo, Texas. On December\n\n 13,2010, Jackson filed his original petition alleging a claim for false imprisonment based\n\n upon his assertion that he was incarcerated seventy-one days in excess of his 333-day\n\ncriminal sentence. 2 He sought $110,000 in monetary damages and any other relief\n\nnecessary to \"resolve the controversy.\" Thereafter, appellees, Rick Thaler and the Texas\n\nDepartment of Criminal Justice, filed an original answer, asserting immunity and\n\nnumerous affirmative defenses, and a jury demand.3 The Texas Attorney General filed\n\nan amicus curiae brief recommending that Jackson's claim be dismissed for failure to\n\ncomply with chapter 14. See id.\n\n\n\n                                       II.        STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n         Inmate litigation is governed by the procedural rules set forth in chapter 14 of the\n\ncivil practice and remedies code. See id. §§ 14.001-.014 (West 2002 & Supp. 2011); see also\n\nMcBride v. Tex. Bd. of Pardons & Paroles, No. 13-05-559-CV, 2008 Tex. App. LEXIS 1290, at\n\n*6 (Tex. App.-Corpus Christi Feb. 21, 2008, pet. denied) (mem. op.).                           The Texas\n\nLegislature enacted chapter 14 to control the flood of lawsuits filed in state courts by\n\n\n\n         2 Apparently, at some point, Jackson was released from prison, though the precise date is unclear\nbased on this record. His complaint pertains to a June 9, 1999 conviction for possession of a controlled\nsubstance, which resulted in a three-year prison sentence with 333 days of time credited. In any event, he\nis currently incarcerated based upon a separate criminal off-o nse.\n\n        3 In one of his numerous motions filed in the trial court. Jackson identified Thaler as the Director\nof the Texas Department of Criminal Justice.\n\nJackson v. Thaler                                                                                    Page2\n\f                                                                                                   ~--=\n\n\n\n\nprison inmates, which consume valuable judicial resources with seemingly little\n\n offsetting benefit.

App.-Waco 1996, no\n\n writ). This Court has noted:\n\n         Prisoners have everything to gain and little to lose by filing frivolous suits.\n         It costs them almost nothing; time is of JlO consequence to a prisoner;\n         threats of sanctions are virtually meaningless; and the prisoner can look\n         forward to a day trip to the courthouse. Thus, the temptation to file a\n         frivolous suit is strong. Such suits, however, waste valuable resources\n         and subject the state and its prison officials to the burden of unwarranted\n         litigation, preventing claims with merit from being heard expeditiously.\n\nId.

App.-Houston [14th Dist.]\n\n1991, no writ).\n\n        The trial court has broad discretion to dismiss an inmate's claim as frivolous.\n\nSchroedter, 88 S.W.3d at 736. In fact, section 14.003 authorizes the trial court to dismiss\n\nan inmate's claim, either before or after service , .f process, if the claim is found to be\n\nfrivolous or malicious. TEX. Civ. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN.§ 14.003(a)(2). To determine\n\nwhether a claim is frivolous, the trial court may consider if: (1) the claim's realistic\n\nchance of ultimate success is slight; (2) the claim has no arguable basis in law or fact; (3)\n\nit is clear that the party cannot prove facts in support of the claim; or (4) the claim is\n\nsubstantially similar to a previous claim filed by the inmate because the claim arises\n\nfrom the same operative facts. Id. § 14.003(b); see Schroedter, 88 S.W.3d at 736.\n\n        Furthermore, the trial court is not required to conduct a hearing before\n\ndismissing a case pursuant to chapter 14. See TEX. Civ.       PRAC. &   REM. CODE ANN.§\n\n14.003(c). Instead, the question of whether to hold a hearing is committed to the trial\n\ncourt's discretion. See id.; see also McCray v.

THE TRIAL COURT'S ORDER OF DISMISSAL\n\n         In his seven issues, Jackson contends that: (1) the trial court erred in dismissing\n\nhis lawsuit because he has a First Amendment right to file suit and because the\n\ndismissal denied him due process; (2) the trial court violated Texas Rule of Civil\n\nProcedure 308 by failing to enforce an order signed on February 9, 20114; (3) the trial\n\ncourt erred by not allowing him to prosecute his claim against the defendants\n\n\n         4   Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 308 provides that:\n\n         The court shall cause its judgments and decrees to be carried into execution; and where\n         the judgment is for personal property, and it is shown by the pleadings and evidence and\n         the verdict, if any, that such property has an especial value to the plaintiff, the court may\n         award a special writ for the seizure and delivery of such property to the plaintiff; and in\n         such case may enforce its judgment by attachment, fine[,} and imprisonment.\n\nTEX. R. Civ. P. 308.\n\n         In the February 9, 2011 order of which Jackson complains, the trial court ordered that the Texas\nAttorney General's Office file an amicus curiae brief within sixty days of receipt of the order. Jackson\nappears to argue that the filing of the amicus curiae brief was not timely ffied. We do not find this\nargument to be meritorious, especially considering the Attorney General's Office ffied its amicus curiae\nbrief on February 28,2011, less than thirty days after the trial court signed its order.\n\n          And, to the extent that Jackson argues that the Attorney General's Office is not authorized to\nrepresent Thaler, we point out that article IV, section 22 of the Texas Constitution provides that the\nAttorney General \"shall represent the State in all suits and pleas in the Supreme Court of the State in\nwhich the State may be a party ... and perform such other duties as may be required by law.\" TEX.\nCONST. art. IV,§ 21; see Brady v. Brooks, 99 Tex. 366,89 S.W. 1052, 1055 (1905). In addition, sections 101.103\nand 104.004 of the civil practice and rem~dies code authorize the Attorney General's Office to defend\npublic servants. See TEX. Civ. PRAC. & REM.

CODE, Chapter 14, relating to Inmate Litigation, applies.\n               Chapter 14 authorizes a trial court to dismiss an inmate's claim as frivolous, before\n       or after service of process, if it finds \"(1) the claim's realistic chance of ultimate success is\n       slight; (2) the claim has no arguable basis in law or in fact; (3) it is clear that the party cannot\n       prove facts in support of the claim; or (4) the clair. l is substantially similar to a previous\n       claim filed by the inmate because the claim arises from the same operative facts.\" TEX. CIV.\n       PRA(::. &REM. CODE §14.003(b).\n               The court has determined that the is case may be decided without hearing and\n       therefore accepts Plajntifr s allegations as true. 1 Jackson's claim under Section 1, Article 17,\n       Texas Constitution2 alleges that his property was taken under a search warrant issued on\n       Deputy Keith Sullivan's affidavit. He alleges the affidavit supporting the warrant stated, \"the\n       [confidential informant] advised [Sullivan] that.. .. \" Jackson infers from this that Sullivan's\n       affidavit was not made based on information within Sullivan's personal knowledge, but\n       instead within the confidential informant's personal knowledge. Jackson concludes the\n       search warrant and subsequent search were legally defective.\n\n\n                      Perales v.
