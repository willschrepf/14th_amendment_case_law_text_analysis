Melograne and Walter V. \"Bo\" Cross conspired to\nfix hundreds of cases in the Court of Common Pleas of\nAllegheny County, Pennsylvania. After a trial in the District\nCourt, a jury convicted them of conspiring to commit mail\nfraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. SS 371 and 1341,1 and\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. Section 371 (the general conspiracy statute) prohibits conspiring with\none or more other persons to commit any offense against or to defraud\nthe United States or one of its agencies, if one of the conspirators does\nan act in furtherance of the conspiracy. Section 1341 prohibits using the\nmail to execute or attempt to execute a fraudulent scheme. For\nsimplicity, we use \"S 1341\" as shorthand for \"conspiracy to commit mail\nfraud.\"\n\n                                 2\n\n\nconspiring to violate Pennsylvania citizens’ right to a fair\nand impartial trial in violation of 18 U.S.C. S 241.2 They\nappealed, and in United States v. Cross, 128 F.3d 145 (3d\nCir. 1997) (Cross I), we affirmed theirS 241 convictions but\nreversed their S 1341 convictions.\n\nIn their current appeals, Cross and Melograne argue that\ntheir appellate counsel in Cross I was ineffective for failing\nto argue that United States v. Pelullo, 14 F.3d 881 (3d Cir.\n1994), required us to set aside their S 241 convictions on\n\"prejudicial spillover\" grounds if we reversed their S 1341\nconvictions. Without deciding whether their counsel acted\nreasonably in eschewing the Pelullo argument, we hold that\ntheir ineffective assistance of counsel claim fails to satisfy\nthe prejudice prong of Strickland v. Washington , 466 U.S.\n668 (1984), because it is not reasonably probable that the\nPelullo argument would have succeeded had it been raised.\n\nI. Background\n\nThe Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas (\"the Court\nof Common Pleas\") is a court of general trial jurisdiction.\nThe Statutory Appeals Division of that Court (the\"Statutory\nAppeals Court\") conducts de novo hearings in appeals from\n\fthe decisions of the minor judiciary in cases involving\nsummary criminal offenses and motor vehicle and\nmunicipal ordinance violations. The minor judiciary is\ncomprised of fifty-five elected district justices as well as\nappointed magistrates within the City of Pittsburgh. Jules\nMelograne was a district justice in the Court of Common\nPleas. Cross was the supervisor of the Statutory Appeals\nCourt. Cross’s duties included determining whether\ndefendants, attorneys, and witnesses (who were generally\npolice officers) were present when a hearing was to begin,\nmanaging the order in which hearings were held, handling\nrequests for postponements, and signing pay vouchers for\npolice officers who testified. Nunzio Melograne, Jules’s\nbrother, was the \"tipstaff \" for Judge Raymond Scheib of the\nStatutory Appeals Court. Nunzio Melograne’s duties\nincluded serving as an aide to Judge Scheib, keeping the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. Section 241 proscribes conspiring to injure a person in the exercise of,\nor because he exercised, a federal right or privilege.\n\n                                3\n\n\nStatutory Appeals Court’s calendar, maintaining and\norganizing case files, calling cases, swearing in witnesses,\nand performing other clerical tasks.\n\nFrom December 1990 through July 1993, Cross and the\nMelogranes used \"their authority and access to the decision\nmaker\"--Judge Scheib--to dictate the results in several\nhundred Statutory Appeals Court hearings.3 Cross I, 128\nF.3d at 146. They fixed cases in various ways. For instance,\nCross often produced not-guilty verdicts by asking police\nofficer witnesses to leave court before testifying, or by\ncalling the cases in which they were to testify before they\narrived. Id. Often Cross requested during a hearing that\nJudge Scheib take the case \"c.a.v.\" (curia advisari vult, a\nLatin phrase meaning colloquially under advisement); Cross\nand Nunzio Melograne would then meet with the Judge in\nhis chambers after the hearing, and a not-guilty verdict\nwould ensue minutes later. Id. at 146-47. In exchange for\nfixing cases, Cross and the Melogranes received various\ngifts and favors from the beneficiaries, such as tickets to\nPittsburgh Steelers games, fruit baskets, and jackets.\n\nAlthough most of the results they engineered were\nfavorable to defendants, Cross and the Melogranes 4 also\nensured that many defendants were found guilty. If they\ndesired a guilty verdict in a particular case, they would\nsimply tell the Judge to find the defendant guilty. In one\ntypical example, a defendant was found guilty after Cross\ninstructed the Judge to \"find this sucker guilty.\" Id. at 147.\nSome clearly innocent defendants were found guilty as a\nresult. For example, Cross and the Melogranes got the\nJudge to find one defendant guilty even though the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. As a jury convicted Cross and the Melogranes on both counts, we view\nthe evidence presented at trial in the light most favorable to the\n\fGovernment. United States v. Scott, 223 F.3d 208, 209 n.1 (3d Cir.\n2000); United States v. Davis, 183 F.3d 231, 238 (3d Cir. 1999).\n\n4. Because a participant in a conspiracy is liable for the reasonably\nforeseeable acts of his coconspirators in furtherance of the conspiracy\n(e.g., Pinkerton v. United States, 328 U.S. 640, 647 (1946); United States\nv. Lopez, 271 F.3d 472, 480 (3d Cir. 2001)), for convenience we will often\nuse \"they\" or \"Cross and the Melogranes\" as the subject when referring\nto acts by Cross or one of the Melogranes in furtherance of the S 241\nconspiracy.\n\n                                  4\n\n\nprosecutor wanted to withdraw the charge, as the evidence\ndid not show a violation. Id.\n\nIn November 1994 a federal grand jury in the Western\nDistrict of Pennsylvania indicted Cross and the Melogranes.5\nCount I alleged that the three violated S 1341 by conspiring\n\"to deprive the citizens of Allegheny County of their\nintangible right to honest services of government\nemployees, furthered by the use of the United States mail.\"6\nThe factual allegations underlying Count I--which were\ndivided into three sections--related to Cross and the\nMelogranes fixing cases both for and against defendants,\nand mailing notices of the dispositions to the parties. The\nfirst section of Count I alleged that they caused 243 cases\nto be dismissed by starting hearings before police officers\narrived to testify or by asking the officers to leave before\nthey testified. The second section alleged that Cross and\nthe Melogranes used their influence over Judge Scheib to\ncause twenty-eight defendants to be found guilty. The third\nsection alleged that they obtained favorable dispositions for\n200 defendants. Count II, which pertained only to the \"to\nbe found guilty\" cases (the second section of Count I),\nalleged that Cross and the Melogranes violated S 241 by\nconspiring to deprive twenty-eight Pennsylvania residents of\ntheir right to a fair and impartial trial.7\n\nBefore trial, Cross and the Melogranes moved under\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 14 to sever Counts I\nand II.8 The District Court denied their motion. It explained\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5. According to the FBI’s lead investigator and the Assistant United\nStates Attorney who prosecuted the case, the Government did not have\nenough evidence to indict Judge Scheib.\n\n6. Count I also   alleged that the defendants conspired to defraud the\nCommonwealth by   depriving it of fines, but the Government did not\nobject when the   District Court submitted the S 1341 count \"to the jury\nas a conspiracy   with the single objective of depriving citizens of the\nhonest services   of the defendants.\" Cross I , 128 F.3d at 147 n.1.\n\n7. The indictment also charged Jules Melograne with ten counts of mail\nfraud. These counts, which are not pertinent here, were severed\npursuant to the defendants’ pretrial motion and were later dismissed.\n\n8. Rule 14 provides in relevant part that a district court may order\n\fseparate trials if it appears that joinder will prejudice a defendant.\n\n                                5\n\n\nthat because \"[t]he criminal acts of one co-conspirator in\nfurtherance of the conspiracy are imputed to all other\nmembers of the conspiracy,\" \"the acts of all the alleged\nconspirators would be admissible even in severed trials.\"\nUnited States v. Cross, Crim. No. 94-233, slip op. at 8 (W.D.\nPa. Aug. 3, 1995). Further, it found that \"the conduct\ncharged is distinct as to each conspiracy,\" and that \"[w]ith\nsuch distinct evidence, the jury will be able to separate the\nevidence.\" Id. The Court rejected the defendants’ claim that\nthey might want to testify as to Count I, but not Count II,\nbecause they \"failed to specify what testimony they wish to\ngive on one count or their reasons for not wishing to testify\non the other.\" Id.\n\nThe jury trial of Cross and the Melogranes lasted three\nmonths. The evidence on both counts was overwhelming.\nThe Government introduced tapes of more than fifty\nconversations, intercepted by FBI surveillance, in which the\nconspirators discussed their plans to fix various cases.\nEach juror heard the tapes and received transcripts of the\nconversations. In addition, the Government presented\ntestimony by FBI Special Agent John Fiore (who\ninvestigated the case-fixing scheme), Suzanne Petrocelly\n(the courtroom clerk), and Catherine Stowe (the Assistant\nDistrict Attorney who prosecuted most of the cases in the\nStatutory Appeals Court). The latter two had cooperated\nwith the FBI’s investigation by keeping informal records of\nthe cases that Cross and the Melogranes fixed. Further, the\nGovernment introduced a notebook in which Nunzio\nMelograne recorded most of the cases that the conspirators\nplanned to fix, including twenty-five of the to-be-found-\nguilty cases. The Government also introduced evidence that\nCross put a star, check mark, or \"c.a.v.\" notation next to a\ncase on his trial calendar to designate the result. Cross I,\n128 F.3d at 147.\n\nThe evidence with respect to the to-be-found-guilty cases\nwas especially powerful. The Government presented either\na statement by one of the conspirators or an entry in\nNunzio Melograne’s notebook to prove each of these counts.\nNunzio Melograne’s notebook demonstrated that Cross and\nthe Melogranes often got defendants found guilty to please\npolice officers and other friends. For instance, one\n\n                                6\n\n\ndefendant was found guilty because an entry in the\nnotebook stated: \"[G]uilty, hard time, Officer M.A. Scott.\"\nAnother entry in the notebook lists two case numbers and\nsays that \"Officer Smith\" wanted the defendants in those\ncases found guilty. Still another defendant was found guilty\nafter Nunzio Melograne wrote in his notebook: \"Hesse,\nguilty, Jules, Hargrove,\" and Jules called Nunzio the\nmorning of the hearing and said, \"[S]tick it in their rear\n\fends. They are bastards.\" On other occasions, Cross and\nthe Melogranes got defendants found guilty because they\ndid not like them or their lawyers. For example, in one to-\nbe-found-guilty case, Cross said to Nunzio Melograne about\nthe defendant’s attorney, \"Screw him. He’s not our friend.\"\n\nMoreover, Cross and the Melogranes boasted of their\nability to get defendants found guilty. The Government\nplayed for the jury a conversation with a local police chief,\ntaped by the FBI, in which Jules Melograne promised to\nmake sure that a defendant was found guilty and bragged\nabout his influence (via his brother Nunzio) over Judge\nScheib:\n\n       I’ll get a’hold [sic] of my brother at home, and uh, if it\n       hasn’t gone out yet . . . make sure there was a\n       conviction on that. I, I told the guys, anytime they want\n       a, you know, conviction . . . . I make a phone call down\n       there, and my brother tells the judge, you know. . ..\n\n       . . . .\n\n       But my brother knows all that stuff inside and out, uh,\n       he’s the judge’s tipstaff. And like I always said, you\n       know, if you wanna--ya know . . . [,] somebody give ya\n       a hard time, some bullshit, yeah, then, uh, you alert\n       my brother down there, baboom, that’s it.\n\nThe jury convicted Cross and the Melogranes on both\ncounts. On direct appeal, their counsel argued that their\nS 241 convictions should be reversed because no decided\ncase had specifically held that S 241 prohibits orchestrating\nguilty verdicts, and that their S 1341 convictions should be\nreversed because the mailed notifications occurred after the\ncompletion of the fraudulent scheme. In Cross I we\nunanimously affirmed their S 241 convictions. The evidence\nintroduced at trial showed that \"Cross and the Melogranes\n\n                                7\n\n\nagreed to use their best efforts to cause the judge in the ‘to\nbe found guilty’ cases to consider factors other than the\nmerits of the case and to find against the defendant.\" 128\nF.3d at 148. Because preexisting law made it clear that\n\"people are entitled to fair adjudication of their guilt before\nan impartial tribunal,\" Cross and the Melogranes had\n\" ‘reasonable warning’ \" that their conduct hindered the\nexercise of constitutional rights, and thus were liable under\nS 241. Id. at 148-50 (quoting United States v. Lanier, 520\nU.S. 259, 269 (1997)).\n\nHowever, we reversed their S 1341 convictions. Because\nthe law required mailing notices of dispositions, and\nbecause in each case any deprivation of public employees’\nhonest services was complete before the notice was mailed,\nthe mailings \"were not in furtherance of the alleged\nconspiracy.\" Id. at 150. We remanded to the District Court\nfor resentencing. Id. at 152.\n\fCross and the Melogranes filed a petition for rehearing en\nbanc, in which they raised for the first time their Pelullo\nargument (i.e., that the evidence introduced to prove the\nS 1341 count was so prejudicial that they are entitled to a\nnew trial on the S 241 count). After we unanimously denied\ntheir petition and the Supreme Court denied certiorari,\nCross v. United States, 523 U.S. 1076 (1998), they moved in\nthe District Court for a new trial under Pelullo in lieu of\nresentencing. The Court denied their motion, finding that\nthey were not prejudiced by any \"spillover\" evidence\nbecause \"[m]uch of the evidence offered to prove [the S 1341\ncount] would have been admissible in a separate trial on\n[the S 241 count].\" United States v. Cross, Crim. No. 94-\n233, slip op. at 1 (W.D. Pa. June 17, 1998) (mem. order).\nThe Court resentenced Cross and Jules Melograne to\ntwenty-seven months in prison followed by two years of\nsupervised release.9\n\nCross and the Melogranes appealed, invoking Pelullo. We\nagain affirmed without dissent, refusing to reach the Pelullo\nissue because they did not raise it on direct appeal. United\nStates v. Cross (Cross II), Nos. 98-3370 & 98-3371, slip op.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n9. Nunzio Melograne had become too ill to be resentenced, and died after\nCross II (referred to in the paragraph immediately below).\n\n                                8\n\n\nat 3 (3d Cir. Mar. 17, 1999) (unpublished table decision).\nCross and Jules Melograne obtained new counsel and\npetitioned under 28 U.S.C. S 2255, alleging that their\noriginal counsel was ineffective for failing to raise Pelullo on\ndirect appeal. The District Court denied relief. Upon Cross\nand Jules Melograne’s application, the Court granted\ncertificates of appealability enabling them to appeal its\nrejection of their ineffective assistance claim. Cross and\nJules Melograne timely appealed.10\n\nII. Standard of Review\n\nWe review the District Court’s decision de novo because\nboth the performance and prejudice prongs of ineffective\nassistance of counsel claims present mixed questions of law\nand fact. Duncan v. Morton, 256 F.3d 189, 200 (3d Cir.\n2001).\n\nIII. Discussion\n\nA. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel Standard\n\nDue process entitles a criminal defendant to the effective\nassistance of counsel on his first appeal as of right. Evitts\nv. Lucey, 469 U.S. 387, 396 (1985).11 The two-prong\nstandard of Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984),\napplies to a defendant’s claim that his appellate counsel\nwas ineffective. Smith v. Robbins, 528 U.S. 259, 285 (2000);\nSmith v. Murray, 477 U.S. 527, 535-36 (1986); U.S. v.\nMannino, 212 F.3d 835, 840 n.4 (3d Cir. 2000) (citations\n\fomitted).12 First, the defendant\"must show that counsel’s\nrepresentation fell below an objective standard of\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n10. The District Court had jurisdiction over the prosecution under 18\nU.S.C. S 3231 and over Appellants’ motion to vacate their sentences\nunder 28 U.S.C. S 2255. We have jurisdiction to review the order denying\nAppellants’ motion under 28 U.S.C. SS 1291 and 2253.\n11. Evitts involved the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause,\n469 U.S. at 388-89, but the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause\nguarantees federal-court defendants an identical right to effective\nassistance of appellate counsel. E.g., United States v. Baker, 256 F.3d\n855, 859-60 & n.2 (9th Cir. 2001).\n12. Although Strickland relied on the Sixth Amendment, which \"does not\napply to appellate proceedings,\" Martinez v. Court of Appeal, 528 U.S.\n152, 161 (2000), it is well-settled that its framework governs claims of\nineffective assistance of appellate counsel. Smith, 528 U.S. at 285\n(stating, in a case decided after Martinez, that Strickland applies to such\nclaims); Mannino, 212 F.3d at 840 n.4 (same).\n\n                                9\n\n\nreasonableness.\" Strickland, 466 U.S. at 688. Second, he\nmust show that there is \"a reasonable probability\"--\"a\nprobability sufficient to undermine confidence in the\noutcome,\" but less than a preponderance of the evidence--\nthat his appeal would have prevailed had counsel’s\nperformance satisfied constitutional requirements. Id. at\n694-95.\n\nBecause failure to satisfy either prong defeats an\nineffective assistance claim, and because it is preferable to\navoid passing judgment on counsel’s performance when\npossible, see id. at 697-98, we begin with the prejudice\nprong. This requires us to determine whether there is a\nreasonable probability that we would have set aside Cross\nand Melograne’s convictions on the S 241 count if their\nappellate counsel had invoked Pelullo. Before making this\ndetermination, we examine Pelullo in some detail.\n\nB. Pelullo\n\nIn Pelullo, the defendant was convicted on forty-nine of\nfifty-four counts of wire fraud, 18 U.S.C. S 1343, and one\ncount of violating the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt\nOrganization Act (\"RICO\"), 18 U.S.C. S 1962, for using a\npublicly held corporation and its affiliates (which he\ncontrolled) to defraud a savings and loan institution and\nthe shareholders of the corporation’s affiliates. Pelullo, 14\nF.3d at 885. On his first appeal, we affirmed his wire fraud\nconviction on one count (\"Count 54\"), but reversed his\nconviction on the other counts (including the RICO count)\nbecause the District Court erroneously admitted\"bank\nrecords and summaries thereof \" that did not qualify under\nany exception to the hearsay rules. Id. We remanded the\ncase for retrial.\n\nAt the second trial, the District Court held that, under\nthe doctrine of collateral estoppel, the judgment of\n\fconviction against the defendant on Count 54 established\nthe facts underlying that count. Id. at 889. Further, the\nCourt allowed the Government to introduce evidence of\nthose facts, including testimony by an alleged Mafia\nunderboss who said that he had extensive dealings with the\ndefendant and portrayed the defendant \"as an associate of\nthe Mafia family.\" Id. at 897, 899.\n\n                                10\n\n\nAfter the defendant was convicted on all counts, he again\nappealed. Id. at 885. We held that the District Court’s\ncollateral estoppel ruling violated the defendant’s Sixth\nAmendment right to a jury trial. Id. at 889-97. Because the\ncollateral estoppel ruling prevented the defendant from\ncontesting the facts underlying Count 54, and because\nthose facts constituted the sole predicate act for the RICO\ncount, we reversed the defendant’s RICO conviction. Id. We\nthen considered whether the evidence pertaining to Count\n54 had a spillover effect \" ‘sufficiently prejudicial to call for\nreversal’ \" of the defendant’s conviction on the forty-eight\nother wire fraud counts. Id. at 897-98 (quoting United\nStates v. Ivic, 700 F.2d 51, 65 (2d Cir. 1983)). To assess the\nspillover effect, we considered four factors. Id. at 898.\n\nFirst, we looked at \"whether the charges are intertwined\nwith each other.\" Id. (citing United States v. Berkery, 889\nF.2d 1281, 1285 (3d Cir. 1989)).13 We reasoned that Count\n54 was \"sufficiently similar to\" the forty-eight wire fraud\ncounts \"to create substantial confusion on the part of the\njury.\" Id. Not only were they all wire fraud counts, but they\nalso alleged \"similar fraud consisting of similar conduct,\nsuch as falsification of corporate documents and diversion\nof corporate funds for personal use,\" and \"described\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n13. In Berkery, the defendant was accused of conspiring to possess and\ndistribute P2P (phenyl-2-propanone, a controlled substance used to\nproduce methamphetamine) and of the substantive offenses of\npossessing and distributing P2P. Berkery, 889 F.2d at 1282. He claimed\nentrapment on the conspiracy count. Id. Because the prevailing law\nrequired a defendant to admit all elements of the counts as to which he\nclaimed entrapment before he could receive a jury instruction on\nentrapment, the defendant admitted all elements of the conspiracy\ncount. Id. After he was convicted on both the conspiracy and substantive\ncounts, but before we ruled on his appeal, the Supreme Court held in\nMathews v. United States, 485 U.S. 58 (1988), that a defendant is\nentitled to a jury instruction on entrapment even if he denies one or\nmore elements of the crime. In light of Mathews , we reversed the\ndefendant’s conspiracy conviction. Berkery, 889 F.2d at 1285. We also\nreversed his conviction on the substantive counts because they were\n\"closely intertwined\" with the conspiracy count and we could \"readily\nsee\" that the jury might have used his admission of guilt on the\nconspiracy count to convict him on the substantive counts. Id. at 1285-\n86.\n\n                                11\n\fsimilar, if not identical, methods used in the alleged\nfrauds.\" Id. In addition, the counts were framed in\n\"identical language.\" Id. The \"similarities of the counts\" led\nus to conclude that \"the risk of jury confusion is\nsignificant.\" Id.\n\nSecond, we examined \"whether the evidence for the\ndifferent counts was sufficiently distinct to support the\nverdict on other separate counts,\" explaining that \"[i]f the\nevidence was distinct, it is likely that there was no\nprejudicial spillover effect.\" Id. (citing United States v.\nBrown, 583 F.2d 659, 669 (3d Cir. 1978)). We determined\nthat \"the jury may well have been confused because much\nof the evidence on all counts was similar, e.g. , wire transfer\ndocuments, bank records, and corporate documents.\" Id.\nMoreover, any confusion was exacerbated by the similarity\nof the charges and the nearly identical language used to\nframe them in the indictment. Id.\n\nThird, we ascertained \"whether substantially all the\nevidence introduced to support the invalid conviction would\nhave been admissible to prove other counts, and whether\nthe elimination of the count on which the defendant was\ninvalidly convicted would have significantly changed the\nstrategy of the trial.\" Id. (citing Ivic, 700 F.2d at 65). We\ndetermined that \"the evidence the government introduced to\nreprove Count 54 in the second trial was not admissible to\nprove the other 48 wire fraud counts,\" so \"elimination of the\nRICO count would have significantly changed trial\nstrategy.\" Id. at 899.\n\nFinally, we examined \"the charges, the language that the\ngovernment used, and the evidence introduced during the\ntrial to see whether they [were] ‘of the sort to arouse a\njury’ \" or \"branded [the defendant] with some terms with\n‘decidedly pejorative connotation.’ \" Id. (quoting Ivic, 700\nF.2d at 65). Of the four factors, this one most clearly\nhighlighted the damage done by the evidence related to\nCount 54. Because the District Court allowed the\nGovernment to introduce the evidence supporting Count\n54, the defendant \"was not only branded as a convicted\nfelon and a racketeer by the government, but also portrayed\nas a person associated with the Mafia.\" Id. The Mafia\nunderboss \"testified to extensive dealings with\" the\n\n                                12\n\n\ndefendant and to \"the friendly relationship between\" the\ndefendant and \"the alleged boss of the Philadelphia Mafia.\"\nId.\n\nEven worse, while at the defendant’s first trial he denied\nhaving Mafia ties and testified that he had never even met\nthe underboss, the District Court’s collateral estoppel ruling\nprevented him from contesting the underboss’s devastating\ntestimony. He could not cross-examine the underboss or\ncontradict his testimony because \"the jury would be\ncharged that any testimony of [the defendant] contradicting\n[the underboss] was false as a matter of law by reason of\n\fcollateral estoppel.\" Id. We had \"little doubt\" that the\nMafia’s reputation influenced the jury, especially since the\nfacts underlying Count 54 were \"reproved thoroughly and\ndramatically,\" whereas the other retried counts were proved\nby mundane evidence such as bank records and corporate\ndocuments. Id. Thus we ordered a new trial on the forty-\neight wire fraud counts. Id. at 900.\n\nAs we explain below, Pelullo’s four factors devolve into\ntwo inquiries: (1) whether the jury heard evidence that\nwould have been inadmissible at a trial limited to the\nremaining valid count (i.e., \"spillover\" evidence); and (2) if\nthere was any spillover evidence, whether it was prejudicial\n(i.e., whether it affected adversely the verdict on the\nremaining count). Considered conversely, we have the\nshorthand label \"prejudicial spillover.\"14\n\nAs a backdrop, it is crucial to understand when\nprejudicial spillover may occur. When a defendant is\nconvicted on two counts involving different offenses at a\nsingle trial and an appellate court reverses his conviction\non one of them, prejudicial spillover can occur only if the\nevidence introduced to support the reversed count would\nhave been inadmissible at a trial on the remaining count.\nSee United States v. Eufrasio, 935 F.2d 553, 571 (3d Cir.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n14. Sometimes courts refer to prejudicial spillover as \"retroactive\nmisjoinder.\" See, e.g., United States v. Aldrich, 169 F.3d 526, 528 (8th\nCir. 1999); United States v. Gabriel, 125 F.3d 89, 105 (2d Cir. 1997). We\nbelieve that description can be misleading. Even if joinder was proper (as\nit was in Pelullo, for instance), prejudicial spillover from the evidence\nsupporting a reversed count can require reversing a remaining count.\n\n                                13\n\n\n1991) (stating that a defendant was not prejudiced by the\ndenial of his motion to sever RICO from non-RICO counts\nwhere \"the same evidence\" was admissible to prove both\nsets of counts); United States v. Edwards, 303 F.3d 606,\n640 (5th Cir. 2002) (holding that defendants alleging\nprejudicial spillover from fraud counts dismissed by district\ncourt after jury verdict \"must show\" that\"otherwise\ninadmissible evidence was admitted to prove the invalid\nfraud claims\"); United States v. Aldrich, 169 F.3d 526, 528\n(8th Cir. 1999) (examining as a threshold question whether\nevidence presented on reversed counts was admissible to\nprove remaining count). If the evidence to prove the\noverturned count would have been admissible to prove the\nremaining valid count, the defendant was not prejudiced,\nand there is no need to consider whether the evidence\ninfluenced the outcome. See United States v. Prosperi, 201\nF.3d 1335, 1345-46 (11th Cir. 2001) (stating that\nprejudicial spillover cannot occur where the evidence was\nadmissible to prove the remaining valid count); United\nStates v. Gore, 154 F.3d 34, 49 (2d Cir. 1998) (finding no\nprejudicial spillover where the ostensible prejudice to the\nappellant resulted from evidence that was admissible on\none of the remaining counts); United States v. Rooney, 37\n\fF.3d 847, 855 (2d Cir.   1994) (\"Courts have concluded that\nwhere the reversed and   remaining counts arise out of\nsimilar facts, and the   evidence introduced would have been\nadmissible as to both,   the defendant has suffered no\nprejudice.\").\n\nIn practice, therefore, prejudicial spillover analysis under\nPelullo begins by asking whether any of the evidence used\nto prove the reversed count would have been inadmissible\nto prove the remaining count (i.e., whether there was any\nspillover of inadmissible evidence). If the answer is \"no,\"\nthen our analysis ends, as the reversed count cannot have\nprejudiced the defendant.\n\nBut if the answer is \"yes,\" then we must consider\nwhether the verdict on the remaining count was affected\nadversely by the evidence that would have been\ninadmissible at a trial limited to that count. See 28 U.S.C.\nS 2111 (\"On the hearing of any appeal . . . the court shall\ngive judgment after an examination of the record without\n\n                                  14\n\n\nregard to errors or defects which do not affect the\nsubstantial rights of the parties.\"); Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(a)\n(\"Any error, defect, irregularity or variance which does not\naffect substantial rights shall be disregarded.\"); Rooney, 37\nF.3d at 856 (\"It is only in those cases in which evidence is\nintroduced on the invalidated count that would otherwise\nbe inadmissible on the remaining counts, and this evidence\nis presented in such a manner that tends to indicate that\nthe jury probably utilized this evidence in reaching a verdict\non the remaining counts, that spillover prejudice is likely to\noccur.\") (emphasis in original). In other words, we must\nconsider, as we do in all contexts involving non-\nconstitutional trial errors, whether the \"error\" was harmless\n--whether it is \"highly probable\" that it did not prejudice\nthe outcome. E.g., United States v. Tyler, 281 F.3d 84, 101\nn.26 (3d Cir. 2002); United States v. Mathis, 264 F.3d 321,\n342 (3d Cir. 2001); United States v. Helbling , 209 F.3d 226,\n241 (3d Cir. 2000); United States v. Gibbs, 190 F.3d 188,\n213 n.16 (3d Cir. 1999); United States v. Mastrangelo, 172\nF.3d 288, 297 (3d Cir. 1999); United States v. Ellis, 156\nF.3d 493, 497 n.5 (3d Cir. 1998).\n\nIn Pelullo we subsumed our harmless error analysis into\nthe four factors, each of which examined, in different ways,\nwhether the evidence introduced to prove Count 54 might\nhave affected adversely the jury’s verdict on the remaining\nwire fraud counts. It was obvious (and thus did not require\ndirect discussion) that the evidence pertaining to Count 54,\nnone of which was admissible to prove the remaining\ncounts, see 14 F.3d at 899, had prejudiced the defendant.\nIt was readily apparent that spillover evidence likely\nconfused the jury because it was intertwined with the\nevidence supporting the remaining counts. It was similarly\nobvious that the Mafia underboss’s testimony probably\ncolored both the defendant’s trial strategy and ultimately\nthe jury’s verdict on the remaining counts. Accordingly, we\n\fdid not explicitly apply harmless error analysis as a\nsequential step in our analysis. But in cases where the\nprejudicial spillover effect is not so obvious, our precedents\ninstruct that we do so. See, e.g., United States v. Murray,\n103 F.3d 310, 319 (3d Cir. 1997); United States v. Quintero,\n\n                                15\n\n\n38 F.3d 1317, 1331 (3d Cir. 1994); United States v.\nGrayson, 795 F.2d 278, 290 (3d Cir. 1986).15\n\nTo summarize, Pelullo requires us to conduct two\ndistinct, sequential inquiries. First, was there a spillover of\nevidence from the reversed count that would have been\ninadmissible at a trial limited to the remaining count?\nSecond, if there was any spillover, is it highly probable that\nit did not prejudice the jury’s verdict on the remaining\ncount, i.e., was the error harmless?16 With this\nunderstanding, we now proceed to analyze Appellants’\nclaims.\n\nC. Is it reasonably probable that the Pelullo argument\n       would have prevailed?\n\n1. Rule 404\n\nAppellants contend that the evidence pertaining to the\nfavorable disposition cases in the invalidated S 1341\nconviction could not have been introduced for a proper\npurpose if their trial had been limited to the S 241 count.\nThey insist that this evidence would have been inadmissible\ncharacter evidence under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(a)17\nbecause it could only have suggested that their fixing cases\nin defendants’ favor made them more likely to have fixed\ncases against defendants. In the alternative, they claim that\nthis evidence would have been excluded under Federal Rule\nof Evidence 403 because its prejudicial effect would have\nsubstantially outweighed its probative value. Contrary to\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n15. Other circuit courts similarly consider harm to the remaining counts\nwhen another count is invalidated. See, e.g. , Prosperi, 201 F.3d at 1346;\nUnited States v. Wapnick, 60 F.3d 948, 954 (2d Cir. 1995); Rooney, 37\nF.3d at 856.\n16. We conduct an analogous inquiry when reviewing the denial of a\nseverance motion, though the appellant bears the burden of proof in that\ncontext. See United States v. Eufrasio, 935 F.2d 553, 568 (3d Cir. 1991)\n(\"Although a trial judge may have abused her discretion in denying a\nRule 14 severance motion, we need reverse a conviction only if the\nappellant shows specifically that the denial caused trial prejudice.\").\n\n17. Rule 404(a) provides, with exceptions not relevant here, that\n\"[e]vidence of a person’s character or a trait of character is not\nadmissible for the purpose of proving action in conformity therewith on\na particular occasion.\" Fed. R. Evid. 404(a).\n\n                                16\n\fAppellants’ arguments, and in sharp contrast to Pelullo, all\nof the evidence introduced to prove the S 1341 count would\nhave been admissible to prove the S 241 count, though (as\nwe discuss below) much of it would have been excluded as\ncumulative under Rule 403.\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 404(b) provides that \"[e]vidence\nof other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove\nthe character of a person in order to show action in\nconformity therewith,\" but, unless inadmissible under\nanother Rule, is \"admissible for other purposes, such as\nproof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan,\nknowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\"18\nThe Government argues that we need not apply Rule 404(b)\nbecause the evidence relating to the favorable disposition\ncases was \"intrinsic\" to a single case-fixing scheme that\nincluded the to-be-found-guilty cases.\n\nRule 404(b) \"does not extend to evidence of acts which\nare ‘intrinsic’ to the charged offense.\" Fed. R. Evid. 404(b)\nadvisory committee’s note (citing United States v. Williams,\n900 F.2d 823 (5th Cir. 1990)). The distinction between\nintrinsic and extrinsic (i.e., \"other acts\" or \"other crimes\")\nevidence is often fuzzy. One leading treatise calls the\ndistinction \"at best one of degree rather than of kind.\" 1\nStephen A. Saltzburg et al., Federal Rules of Evidence\nManual 397 (7th ed. 1998). Unfortunately, as the D.C.\nCircuit has explained, most circuit courts view evidence as\nintrinsic if it is \"inextricably intertwined\" with the charged\noffense (a definition that elucidates little) or if it \"completes\nthe story\" of the charged offense (a definition so broad that\nit renders Rule 404(b) meaningless). United States v. Bowie,\n232 F.3d 923, 927-29 (D.C. Cir. 2000); see also id. at 929\n(stating that \"it cannot be that all evidence tending to prove\nthe crime is part of the crime\" because that would make\nRule 404(b) \"a nullity\").\n\nThese are some of the pedagogical problems with\nunderstanding intrinsic evidence. But what does it mean in\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n18. Rule 404(b) also requires the Government to give the defendant\n\"reasonable notice\" when it plans to introduce evidence of uncharged\nmisconduct, but Appellants do not suggest that this provision is relevant\nto our analysis.\n\n                                17\n\n\npractice? For our Court, acts are intrinsic when they\ndirectly prove the charged conspiracy. See Gibbs , 190 F.3d\nat 217-18. Thus we need not proceed further in this thicket\nbecause it is clear that Appellants’ involvement in fixing\ncases in defendants’ favor is not part of the S 241\nconspiracy.19\n\nThus, contrary to the Government’s contention, Rule\n404(b) applies here. Appellants’ acts pertaining to the\nfavorable disposition cases do not directly prove their\nconspiracy to violate Pennsylvania citizens’ right to a fair\n\fand impartial hearing in the to-be-found-guilty cases, and\nthus by any definition are not intrinsic to theS 241 offense.\nIn a trial limited to the S 241 count, Appellants would be\ncharged only with conspiring to engineer guilty verdicts, not\nwith conspiring to fix cases generally. While the evidence\npertaining to the favorable disposition cases helps prove\nAppellants’ broader conspiracy to fix cases, it does not\ndirectly prove that Appellants conspired to get defendants\nfound guilty. Therefore, we must consider whether the\nevidence relating to the favorable disposition cases would\nhave been admissible to prove the S 241 count under Rule\n404(b).\n\nTo satisfy Rule 404(b), evidence of other acts must (1)\nhave a proper evidentiary purpose, (2) be relevant under\nRule 402, (3) satisfy Rule 403 (i.e., not be substantially\nmore prejudicial than probative), and (4) be accompanied\nby a limiting instruction, when requested pursuant to\nFederal Rule of Evidence 105,20 that instructs the jury not\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n19. Accordingly, we express no view on whether\"other acts\" evidence\nthat does not directly prove an element of the charged offense may be\n\"intrinsic\" (and thus exempt from Rule 404(b)) if the other acts were\n\"inextricably intertwined\" with the events underlying the charge, so that\nthe evidence is necessary for the jury to understand how the offense\noccurred or to comprehend crucial testimony. See, e.g., United States v.\nBadru, 97 F.3d 1471, 1474 (D.C. Cir. 1996); United States v. Record, 873\nF.2d 1363, 1372 n.5 (10th Cir. 1989); United States v. Richardson, 764\nF.2d 1514, 1521-22 (11th Cir. 1985); United States v. Weeks, 716 F.2d\n830, 832 (11th Cir. 1983) (per curiam).\n\n20. Rule 105 provides: \"When   evidence which is admissible as to one\nparty or for one purpose but   not admissible as to another party or for\nanother purpose is admitted,   the court, upon request, shall restrict the\nevidence to its proper scope   and instruct the jury accordingly.\" Fed. R.\nEvid. 105.\n\n                                  18\n\n\nto use the evidence for an improper purpose.21 See United\nStates v. Butch, 256 F.3d 171, 175 (3d Cir. 2001); United\nStates v. Mastrangelo, 172 F.3d 288, 294-95 (3d Cir. 1999).\n\"Other acts\" evidence satisfies the first two requirements if\nit is \"probative of a material issue other than character.\"\nHuddleston v. United States, 485 U.S. 681, 685 (1988). In\nother words, there must be an articulable chain of\ninferences, \" ‘no link of which may be the inference that the\ndefendant has the propensity to commit the crime\ncharged,’ \" connecting the evidence to a material fact.\nBecker v. Arco Chem. Co., 207 F.3d 176, 191 (3d Cir. 2000)\n(quoting United States v. Morley, 199 F.3d 129, 133 (3d Cir.\n1999)); see also United States v. Echeverri, 854 F.2d 638,\n644 (3d Cir. 1988) (stating that the \"chain of logic must\ninclude no link involving an inference that a bad person is\ndisposed to do bad acts\"). Appellants insist that the only\npossible relevance to the S 241 count of the evidence\nrelating to the favorable disposition cases was to suggest\ntheir inclination to fix cases, an obviously impermissible\n\fpurpose under Rule 404(a). We disagree.\n\nIn the face of the overwhelming evidence against them,\nCross and the Melogranes attempted to shift the blame to\nJudge Scheib. Their main defenses were (1) that they had\nno opportunity to dictate how cases were resolved because\nJudge Scheib decided every case independently, and (2)\nthat they performed their various court-related\nresponsibilities in good faith and did not intend to influence\ncases’ outcomes. The evidence pertaining to the favorable\ndisposition cases eviscerated both of these defenses.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n21. In the current context, however, it makes little sense to give\nsignificant weight in our analysis of admissibility (as distinct from our\nharmless error analysis) to the absence of a limiting instruction (even if\nit had been requested), since the District Court did not know ex ante\nthat the evidence should be analyzed as if Cross and the Melogranes\nwere charged only with violating S 241. Along similar lines, while\nordinarily a trial judge should require a party offering \"other acts\"\nevidence to articulate clearly the chain of inferences leading from that\nevidence to a material fact, and should explain on the record why (s)he\nadmitted or excluded that evidence, see Murray , 103 F.3d at 316, the\nDistrict Court here could not have been expected to do so with respect\nto evidence that was central to the jointly triedS 1341 count.\n\n                                19\n\n\nFirst, the evidence indicated that, contrary to their\nprotestations at trial, Cross and the Melogranes had an\nopportunity to control Judge Scheib’s decisions. For\ninstance, the evidence that Judge Scheib reached the\ndecisions preordained (or, at the very least, foreshadowed)\nin Nunzio Melograne’s notebook or in the conversations\nintercepted by the FBI showed that they decided, or\ninfluenced Judge Scheib to decide, many cases. Indeed,\nthat Cross and the Melogranes fixed numerous cases in\ndefendants’ favor suggested that they could routinely obtain\nwhatever result they desired, and discredited their\ncontention that Judge Scheib was not subject to their\ninfluence. Their ability to dictate cases’ outcomes showed\nthat they had the opportunity to get defendants found\nguilty, which aided the Government’s allegation that they\nconspired to do so. Cf. Echeverri, 854 F.2d at 644 (holding\nthat testimony that the defendant traveled to Miami to pick\nup five kilograms of cocaine, one year before the alleged\nconspiracy to distribute cocaine began, was admissible\nunder Rule 404(b) because his \"access to a source\" made\nhim more likely to have \"initiated the charged conspiracy\").\n\nSecond, the evidence showed that Cross and the\nMelogranes intended to control cases’ outcomes, and thus\nrefuted their defense of good faith. \"In order to admit\nevidence under the ‘intent’ component of Rule 404(b), intent\nmust be an element of the crime charged and the evidence\noffered must cast light upon the defendant’s intent to\ncommit the crime.\" United States v. Himelwright, 42 F.3d\n777, 782 (3d Cir. 1994). To convict Appellants on the S 241\ncount, the Government had to show that they had a specific\n\fintent to interfere with their victims’ right to a fair and\nimpartial hearing. See United States v. Coleman , 811 F.2d\n804, 808 (3d Cir. 1987) (stating that S 241 is a specific\nintent offense).\n\nCross and the Melogranes hotly disputed that they\nintended to get defendants found guilty, insisting they\nparticipated unwittingly in Judge Scheib’s misconduct.\nIndeed, they spent so much effort straining to convince the\njury that they acted in good faith that the prosecutor was\nforced to emphasize during his closing argument that\"[t]he\nissue in this case is not Judge Scheib’s culpability but the\n\n                                20\n\n\ndefendants’ culpability.\" In addition, the District Court\ninstructed the jury that \"the defendants contend that they\nacted in good faith,\" and that they could not be convicted\non the S 241 count unless the Government proved \"intent to\nviolate civil rights beyond a reasonable doubt,\" which\n\"would negate the defense of good faith.\"\n\nThe evidence that Cross and the Melogranes fixed cases\nin defendants’ favor refuted their claims of good faith. If\nthey were acting in good faith, they would not have asked\npolice officers to leave before testifying. Nor would they\nhave accepted gifts and favors in exchange for engineering\nrequested outcomes. This evidence relating to the favorable\ndisposition cases showed that, rather than acting in good\nfaith, Cross and the Melogranes intentionally fixed those\ncases, which suggested that they intended to fix the to-be-\nfound-guilty cases as well. Cf., e.g., United States v.\nConsole, 13 F.3d 641, 658-59 (3d Cir. 1993) (holding that\nevidence that defendants submitted fraudulent medical bills\non other occasions was admissible to show that they knew\nthat the bills at issue in the case were fraudulent and that\nthey intended to defraud insurance companies by\nsubmitting them); United States v. Dise, 763 F.2d 586, 592-\n93 (3d Cir. 1985) (holding that where the defendant, who\nwas charged with physically abusing severely mentally\nretarded patients in violation of 18 U.S.C. S 242, insisted\nthat he was motivated by safety concerns, evidence that he\nmade the patients ingest cigarette butts and kicked them in\nthe buttocks was admissible to prove his intent to harm\nthem); see also Huddleston, 485 U.S. at 691 (explaining\nthat where defendant charged with selling and possessing\nstolen videotapes denied knowing the tapes were stolen,\nevidence that he bought stolen televisions from the person\nwho sold him the videotapes was admissible to show that\nhe knew the tapes were stolen). Similarly, trial evidence\nshowed that Cross and the Melogranes did not\ninadvertently get defendants found guilty. See Fed. R. Evid.\n404(b) (stating that \"other acts\" evidence is admissible to\nshow \"absence of mistake or accident\"); United States v.\nVega, 285 F.3d 256, 262 (3d Cir. 2002) (holding that\nevidence of the defendant’s involvement in a prior drug\nconspiracy was admissible to prove \"that he did not\nunwittingly participate\" in the charged conspiracy).\n\f                                21\n\n\nIn addition to demonstrating that Cross and the\nMelogranes had the opportunity and intent to violateS 241\nby interfering with Pennsylvania citizens’ right to a fair and\nimpartial hearing, the evidence relating to the favorable\ndisposition cases helped explain their motives in getting\ncertain defendants found guilty. The existence of an\noverarching scheme can provide circumstantial evidence of\na defendant’s guilt by explaining his motive in committing\nthe alleged offense. See, e.g., J & R Ice Cream Corp. v.\nCalifornia Smoothie Licensing Corp., 31 F.3d 1259, 1268-69\n(3d Cir. 1994); Government of the Virgin Islands v. Pinney,\n967 F.2d 912, 916 (3d Cir. 1992); 1 John W. Strong et al.,\nMcCormick on Evidence S 190, at 661 (5th ed. 1999). This is\nespecially important when the charged offense requires\nspecific intent, see Strong et al., supra, at 665 & n.36,\nwhich (as noted) S 241 does, see Coleman , 811 F.2d at 808.\n\nCross and the Melogranes engineered favorable\ndispositions for defendants in exchange for various gifts\nand favors. One of their primary methods of obtaining a\nfavorable disposition was to inform a police officer that he\ncould leave before the case in which he was to testify was\ncalled. To ensure the officers’ continued cooperation in their\nscheme, Cross and the Melogranes needed to reward them.\nAs Nunzio Melograne’s notebook attests, they got certain\ndefendants found guilty to please police officers with whom\nthey were collaborating. The evidence of the gifts and\nfavors, and of the officers told to leave court before\ntestifying, was important to enable the jury to understand\nwhy they wanted to curry favor with the police, and thus\nwas probative of their motive in fixing cases against\ndefendants whom police officers did not like.\n\nIn sum, each piece of evidence relating to the favorable\ndisposition cases would have been admissible to prove the\nS 241 count under Rule 404(b) because each was\"probative\nof a material issue other than character.\"22 Huddleston, 485\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n22. Jules Melograne contends that he would have   testified if charged\nonly with violating S 241, as he would not have   had to explain his\ninvolvement in the favorable disposition cases.   But since the evidence\nrelating to those cases was admissible to prove   theS 241 count, this\nargument is unavailing.\n\n                                22\n\n\nU.S. at 686. To be admitted, however, the evidence needed\nto satisfy the requirements of Rule 403, to which we now\nturn.\n\n2. Rule 403\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 403 provides that \"evidence may\nbe excluded if its probative value is substantially\noutweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of\n\fthe issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of\nundue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of\ncumulative evidence.\" It creates a presumption of\nadmissibility. United States v. Universal Rehabilitation Serv.\n(PA), Inc., 205 F.3d 657, 664 (3d Cir. 2000) (en banc)\n(citations omitted). Evidence cannot be excluded under Rule\n403 merely because its unfairly prejudicial effect is greater\nthan its probative value. Rather, evidence can be kept out\nonly if its unfairly prejudicial effect \"substantially\noutweigh[s]\" its probative value. Fed. R. Evid. 403. As one\nexample, when evidence is highly probative, even a large\nrisk of unfair prejudice may be tolerable.\n\nAppellants insist that the evidence relating to the\nfavorable disposition cases was inflammatory, confusing,\nand cumulative with respect to the S 241 count, and thus\nwould have been excluded under Rule 403. Specifically,\nthey claim the evidence under S 1341 that they asked police\nofficers to leave without testifying, and that they received\ngifts and favors for fixing cases, was unfairly prejudicial\nbecause it led the jury to want to punish them irrespective\nof their guilt on the S 241 count. In addition, they argue\nthat the sheer volume of the evidence introduced to prove\nthe S 1341 count created an unacceptable risk of confusing\nthe jury, and that it unduly delayed the trial, wasted time,\nand was cumulative.\n\nThe evidence in the S 1341 phase of the case that Cross\nand the Melogranes asked police officers to leave before\ntestifying, and that they received gifts and favors for fixing\ncases, was not substantially more prejudicial than\nprobative.23 Rule 404(b) evidence is especially probative\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n23. Appellants’ briefs seem to suggest that evidence threatens \"unfair\nprejudice\" if it is merely undesirable from the defendant’s perspective.\n\n                                23\n\n\nwhen the charged offense involves a conspiracy. E.g., United\nStates v. Mathis, 216 F.3d 18, 26 (D.C. Cir.), cert. denied,\n531 U.S. 972 (2000); United States v. Manner, 887 F.2d\n317, 322 (D.C. Cir. 1989); United States v. Merkt, 794 F.2d\n950, 963 (5th Cir. 1986); United States v. Sampol, 636 F.2d\n621, 659 n.23 (D.C. Cir. 1980).24 For this reason, the\nGovernment has broad latitude to use \"other acts\" evidence\nto prove a conspiracy.25 See Mathis, 216 F.3d at 26.\n\nThe evidence that Cross and the Melogranes asked police\nofficers to leave prior to testifying, and accepted gifts and\nfavors in exchange for arranging favorable dispositions, was\nvery important because it undercut their main defense--\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nHowever, such a sweeping definition would include\"[a]ny evidence\nsuggesting guilt.\" United States v. Blyden , 964 F.2d 1375, 1378 (3d Cir.\n1992). Instead, \"unfair prejudice\" means \"an undue tendency to suggest\ndecision on an improper basis, commonly, though not necessarily, an\nemotional one.\" Fed. R. Evid. 403 advisory committee’s note. Thus our\n\f\"focus must be on unfairness in the sense that the proponent would\nsecure an advantage that results from the likelihood the evidence would\npersuade by illegitimate means.\" Blyden, 964 F.2d at 1378 (emphasis\nadded).\n\n24. See also Mathis, 216 F.3d at 26 (\"In a conspiracy prosecution, the\ngovernment is usually allowed considerable leeway in offering evidence of\nother offenses ‘to inform the jury of the background of the conspiracy\ncharged, . . . and to help explain to the jury how the illegal relationship\nbetween the participants in the crime developed.’ \") (footnote omitted)\n(quoting United States v. Williams, 205 F.3d 23, 33-34 (2d Cir. 2000));\nUnited States v. Escobar-de Jesus, 187 F.3d 148, 169 (1st Cir. 1999) (\"In\na conspiracy case, evidence of other bad acts . . . can be admitted to\nexplain the background, formation, and development of the illegal\nrelationship, and, more specifically, to help the jury understand the\nbasis for the co-conspirators’ relationship of mutual trust.\") (citations\nomitted).\n\n25. The Fifth Circuit goes further, reasoning that because \"Rule 404(b)\nevidence is particularly probative where the government has charged\nconspiracy,\" and because \"[i]n the context of a conspiracy case, the mere\nentry of a not guilty plea sufficiently raises the issue of intent to justify\nthe admissibility of extrinsic offense evidence,\" Rule 403 justifies\nexcluding the evidence \"[o]nly when the defendant affirmatively takes the\nissue of intent out of the case.\" United States v. Gordon, 780 F.2d 1165,\n1174 (5th Cir. 1986) (citations omitted).\n\n                                24\n\n\nthat they acted in good faith. Moreover, this evidence was\nimportant to enable the jury to understand their motives in\nfixing some of the to-be-found-guilty cases to please police\nofficers, whose cooperation was essential to their overall\nscheme of controlling case outcomes and obtaining a quid\npro quo (gifts and favors). This evidence was thus highly\nprobative of their intent and motive.\n\nOn the other side of the balance, the evidence that Cross\nand Melograne instructed police officers to leave before\ntestifying likely angered the jury, as the officers ended up\ngetting paid, at taxpayers’ expense, for not testifying. And\nthe evidence that they received various gifts and favors for\neffecting favorable decisions likely made the jury more\ninclined to want to punish them. But these potentially\nprejudicial aspects of the evidence do not render that\nevidence inadmissible under Rule 403, as they fall far short\nof substantially outweighing their significant probative\nvalue.26 \"Rule 403 does not provide a shield for defendants\nwho engage in outrageous acts, permitting only the crimes\nof Caspar Milquetoasts to be described fully to a jury. It\ndoes not generally require the government to sanitize its\ncase, to deflate its witnesses’ testimony, or to tell its story\nin a monotone.\" United States v. Gartmon, 146 F.3d 1015,\n1021 (D.C. Cir. 1998). We cannot agree with Appellants’\nargument that highly probative evidence of their intent and\nmotive would have been kept out under Rule 403 merely\nbecause the evidence posed some risk of unfair prejudice.27\n_________________________________________________________________\n\f26. Indeed, courts have admitted far more prejudicial evidence when its\nprobative value is significant. E.g., United States v. LeMay, 260 F.3d\n1018, 1027-29 (9th Cir. 2001) (evidence that the defendant, who was\naccused of molesting his two young nephews, had previously molested\nother young relatives under similar circumstances was properly admitted\nunder Rule 403 because it bolstered the victims’ credibility and\ncorroborated their testimony); United States v. Gartmon, 146 F.3d 1015,\n1021 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (evidence that defendant inserted a gun into his\ngirlfriend’s vagina in an attempt to coerce her into continuing to help\nhim commit fraud was correctly admitted under Rule 403 because it\ndemonstrated the defendant’s intent and controlling role in the scheme,\neven though it \"may have dramatically injured[his] cause\").\n\n27. Jules Melograne argues that because he participated in only two of\nthe to-be-found-guilty cases, the evidence relating to the favorable\n\n                                25\n\n\nWe also cannot accept Appellants’ contention that the\nprobative value of the evidence relating to the favorable\ndisposition cases was substantially outweighed by the\nextent to which it confused or misled the jury. The District\nCourt rejected essentially the same argument when it\ndenied the pretrial severance motion. It explained that \"the\nconduct charged is distinct as to each conspiracy regarding\nthe courts affected, the nature of the conduct, and the\ndefendants involved,\" and that \"[t]here is nothing that\nmakes it appear that a reasonable jury will not be able to\ncompartmentalize the evidence against each defendant,\ndespite the large number of overt acts alleged in Count I.\"\nNot only was the evidence on both counts straightforward\nand easy for jurors to \"compartmentalize,\" but the\nGovernment’s presentation of its case also alleviated\nwhatever slight risk of confusion may have existed. The\nGovernment divided its case into four parts, devoting one\npart to background information about how the Statutory\nAppeals Court operated and about the roles of Cross and\nNunzio Melograne, and the other three to prongs (a), (b),\nand (c) of the indictment (i.e., two parts to the favorable\ndisposition cases, and one part to the to-be-found-guilty\ncases). Before each of the parts which corresponded to a\nprong of the indictment, Special Agent Fiore testified and\nexplained to the jury that the Government was moving on\nto a new portion of its case. Because the evidence was so\nneatly segmented, the jury was unlikely to have been\nconfused about which evidence pertained to which count.\n\nDespite all this, although no individual piece of the\nevidence was substantially more prejudicial than probative\nwith respect to the S 241 count, and although none of it\nposed a threat of confusing the jury that substantially\n_________________________________________________________________\n\ndisposition cases was particularly damaging to him. This argument is a\nred herring. Conspirators are responsible for their co-conspirators’\nreasonably foreseeable acts in furtherance of the conspiracy, e.g.,\nPinkerton, 328 U.S. at 647; Lopez, 271 F.3d at 480, so Jules Melograne\nis just as responsible for the to-be-found-guilty cases in which he did not\nparticipate as for those in which he did. Hence there is no reason why\n\fthe evidence relating to the favorable disposition cases was more\ndamaging to him than to his co-conspirators.\n\n                                26\n\n\noutweighed its probative value, much of it would have been\nexcluded as cumulative in a trial limited to theS 241 count.\nSee Fed. R. Evid. 403 (providing that relevant evidence\n\"may be excluded if its probative value is substantially\noutweighed by . . . considerations of undue delay, waste of\ntime, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence\").\n\"Evidence is ‘cumulative’ when it adds very little to the\nprobative force of the other evidence in the case, so that if\nit were admitted its contribution to the determination of\ntruth would be outweighed by its contribution to the length\nof trial, with all the potential for confusion, as well as\nprejudice to other litigants, who must wait longer for their\ntrial, that a long trial creates.\" United States v. Williams, 81\nF.3d 1434, 1443 (7th Cir. 1996). In a trial on theS 241\ncount, there would have been no reason to admit evidence\nof every overt act alleged with respect to the S 1341 count.\nOnce sufficient evidence was introduced to inform the jury\nthat Cross and the Melogranes asked police officers to leave\nbefore testifying so that cases would be dismissed and that\ntheir scheme led to their receiving various gifts and favors,\nthe District Court would not have admitted more evidence\non these points. Therefore, although each individual piece\nof evidence relating to the favorable disposition cases had\nsignificant probative value with respect to the to-be-found-\nguilty cases, much of that evidence would have been\nexcluded as cumulative under Rule 403 in a trial limited to\nthe S 241 count. But whether this requires us to reverse\nAppellants’ S 241 convictions depends on whether it is\nhighly probable that the cumulative evidence did not\ncontribute to the jury’s verdict.\n\n3. Harmless error analysis\n\nAs with other non-constitutional trial errors, the\nimproper admission of evidence does not require reversing\na conviction if it is \"highly probable that the error did not\ncontribute to the judgment.\" United States v. Tyler, 281\nF.3d 84, 101 n.26 (3d Cir. 2002). When errors of\nconstitutional magnitude are raised on direct appeal, we\n\"must be able to declare a belief that [the error] was\nharmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\" Chapman v.\nCalifornia, 386 U.S. 18, 24 (1967). Under the\"highly\nprobable\" standard, however, \"[t]here is no need to disprove\n\n                                27\n\n\n‘every reasonable possibility of prejudice.’ \" United States v.\nCopple, 24 F.3d 535, 546 (3d Cir. 1994) (quoting United\nStates v. Simon, 995 F.2d 1236, 1244 (3d Cir. 1993)); see\nalso United States v. Mathis, 264 F.3d 321, 342 (3d Cir.\n2001), cert. denied, 122 S. Ct. 1211 (2002); United States v.\nSokolow, 91 F.3d 396, 407 (3d Cir. 1996); United States v.\nGrayson, 795 F.2d 278, 290 (3d Cir. 1986). While the\n\fGovernment bears the burden of showing that the error\nwas harmless, United States v. Adams, 252 F.3d 276, 281\n(3d Cir. 2001), we can affirm for any reason supported by\nthe record. Tyler, 281 F.3d at 101 n.26; Mathis, 264 F.3d\nat 342-43; see also Nicini v. Morra, 212 F.3d 798, 805 (3d\nCir. 2000) (en banc); Alexander Hamilton Life Ins. Co. of Am.\nv. Gov’t of Virgin Islands, 757 F.2d 534, 547-48 (3d Cir.\n1985).\n\nEven if the cumulative evidence prejudiced Appellants to\nsome extent by distracting the jury or by emphasizing\nevents that could have aroused the jury’s passions, we can\nconfidently say that it is \"highly probable\" that the\nsuperfluous evidence made no difference in the ultimate\nverdict of the jury. The evidence supporting theS 241 count\nwas overwhelming. The Government presented either a\nstatement by one of the conspirators or a \"guilty\" entry in\nNunzio Melograne’s notebook to prove each of the to-be-\nfound-guilty cases. Special Agent Fiore testified that the\ndefendants whom the notebook designated to be found\n\"guilty\" were in fact found guilty. Assistant District Attorney\nStowe and Petrocelly, the courtroom clerk, also testified\nthat Cross and the Melogranes got defendants found guilty.\nThe incriminating evidence that came from Appellants’ own\nmouths--the majority of which was admitted in tape-\nrecorded form--was especially damaging. Indeed,\nAppellants’ statements can only be described as shocking.\nFor instance, in a conversation taped by the FBI, Jules\nMelograne bragged to a local police chief about how easily\nhe could get defendants found guilty: \"I told the guys,\nanytime they want a, you know, conviction . . . . I make a\nphone call down there, and my brother tells the judge, you\nknow.\" He added, \"[S]omebody give ya a hard time, some\nbullshit, yeah, then, uh, you alert my brother down there,\nbaboom, that’s it.\" Similarly incriminating statements by\nCross were presented, such as his telling the Judge to \"find\n\n                                28\n\n\nthis sucker guilty\" when a particular defendant was to be\nfound guilty, and his responding to one to-be-found-guilty\nrequest by saying about the defendant, \"[W]e’ll burn her\nass.\" Cross I, 128 F.3d at 147.\n\nBecause the evidence supporting the S 241 count was so\npowerful, it is highly unlikely that the cumulative evidence\nrelating to the favorable disposition cases contributed to the\njudgment. The jury would have gained essentially the same\nknowledge from hearing testimony about a limited number\nof such cases as it gained from hearing the more extensive\ntestimony at the trial. Further, we seriously doubt that the\ncumulative evidence could have affected the outcome in\nlight of the devastating evidence supporting theS 241\ncount. In contrast to Pelullo, where the testimony regarding\nthe defendant’s Mafia ties was admissible only as to the\nreversed count, the most inflammatory evidence presented\nat Cross and Melograne’s trial was that pertaining to the\nremaining count, which was proved largely by Appellants’\ncolorfully worded admissions. And unlike the defendant in\n\fPelullo, Appellants were not collaterally estopped from\nchallenging the evidence to which they now object.\n\nMoreover, as the District Court recognized when it\nrejected Appellants’ severance motion, this is not a case\nwhere the \"evidence pertaining to each count was not, and\nprobably could not have been, segregated at the trial and in\nthe minds of the jurors.\" United States v. De Cavalcante,\n440 F.2d 1264, 1276 (3d Cir. 1971).28 The evidence on each\ncount was sufficiently straightforward and distinct that the\njury was unlikely to have been confused by the evidence\nrelating to the favorable dispositions. In clear contrast to\nPelullo, 14 F.3d at 898, where both the reversed and the\nremaining counts alleged the same offense (wire fraud) and\nthe problem was compounded by the complicated evidence\nof financial transactions and bank records in that case,\nAppellants were convicted of two very different offenses.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n28. Likewise, the District Court’s reasoning in ruling on the severance\nmotion, along with the other factors discussed above with respect to the\ncumulative evidence, convinces us that it is highly probable that the\njury’s verdict was not affected by the lack of limiting instructions\naccompanying the evidence relating to the favorable disposition cases.\n\n                                29\n\n\nFurther, the District Court admonished the jury that it was\nnot to convict Cross and the Melogranes on one of the\ncharged offenses merely because it found them guilty of the\nother, and \" ‘juries are presumed to follow their\ninstructions.’ \" Zafiro v. United States , 506 U.S. 534, 541\n(1993) (quoting Richardson v. Marsh, 481 U.S. 200, 211\n(1987)).\n\nFinally, we cannot accept Appellants’ arguments that\ntheir respective trial strategies would be significantly\ndifferent in a trial limited to the S 241 count. Both Cross\nand Melograne insist that they would have called Judge\nScheib as a witness had they not been charged with\nviolating S 1341. They claim that he could have given\nexculpatory testimony on the to-be-found-guilty cases, but\nthat they did not put him on the stand because of the\ndamaging testimony he would have given on the favorable\ndisposition cases. This argument is not plausible. As the\nGovernment points out, Judge Scheib would surely have\ninvoked his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-\nincrimination. The Government had evidence of Judge\nScheib’s involvement in fixing cases, but not enough to\nindict him. It is inconceivable that he would have risked\ngiving the Government the additional evidence it needed.\n\nConclusion\n\nUnder Pelullo, an appellate court’s decision to reverse one\ncount requires it to reverse the remaining count(s) only if\n(1) some of the evidence introduced to support the reversed\ncount would have been inadmissible at a trial on the\nremaining count(s), and (2) the error is not harmless. While\n\fmuch of the evidence supporting Cross and Melograne’s\nS 1341 convictions would have been excluded as cumulative\nin a trial on the S 241 count, it is highly probable that this\nevidence did not contribute to the jury’s finding that they\nviolated S 241 by conspiring to deprive Pennsylvania\ncitizens of their right to a fair and impartial trial. Because\nthe prejudicial spillover, if any, was harmless error, it is not\nreasonably probable that the Pelullo argument would have\nprevailed on direct appeal had it been raised. Thus\n\n                                30\n\n\nappellate counsel was not constitutionally ineffective, and\nthe District Court’s denial of S 2255 relief is affirmed.\n\nA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n\n                                31\n\f",

Background\n\nThe Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas (\"the Court\nof Common Pleas\") is a court of general trial jurisdiction.\nThe Statutory Appeals Division of that Court (the\"Statutory\nAppeals Court\") conducts de novo hearings in appeals from\n\fthe decisions of the minor judiciary in cases involving\nsummary criminal offenses and motor vehicle and\nmunicipal ordinance violations. The minor judiciary is\ncomprised of fifty-five elected district justices as well as\nappointed magistrates within the City of Pittsburgh. Jules\nMelograne was a district justice in the Court of Common\nPleas. Cross was the supervisor of the Statutory Appeals\nCourt. Cross’s duties included determining whether\ndefendants, attorneys, and witnesses (who were generally\npolice officers) were present when a hearing was to begin,\nmanaging the order in which hearings were held, handling\nrequests for postponements, and signing pay vouchers for\npolice officers who testified. Nunzio Melograne, Jules’s\nbrother, was the \"tipstaff \" for Judge Raymond Scheib of the\nStatutory Appeals Court. Nunzio Melograne’s duties\nincluded serving as an aide to Judge Scheib, keeping the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. Section 241 proscribes conspiring to injure a person in the exercise of,\nor because he exercised, a federal right or privilege.\n\n                                3\n\n\nStatutory Appeals Court’s calendar, maintaining and\norganizing case files, calling cases, swearing in witnesses,\nand performing other clerical tasks.\n\nFrom December 1990 through July 1993, Cross and the\nMelogranes used \"their authority and access to the decision\nmaker\"--Judge Scheib--to dictate the results in several\nhundred Statutory Appeals Court hearings.3 Cross I, 128\nF.3d at 146. They fixed cases in various ways. For instance,\nCross often produced not-guilty verdicts by asking police\nofficer witnesses to leave court before testifying, or by\ncalling the cases in which they were to testify before they\narrived. Id. Often Cross requested during a hearing that\nJudge Scheib take the case \"c.a.v.\" (curia advisari vult, a\nLatin phrase meaning colloquially under advisement); Cross\nand Nunzio Melograne would then meet with the Judge in\nhis chambers after the hearing, and a not-guilty verdict\nwould ensue minutes later. Id. at 146-47. In exchange for\nfixing cases, Cross and the Melogranes received various\ngifts and favors from the beneficiaries, such as tickets to\nPittsburgh Steelers games, fruit baskets, and jackets.\n\nAlthough most of the results they engineered were\nfavorable to defendants, Cross and the Melogranes 4 also\nensured that many defendants were found guilty. If they\ndesired a guilty verdict in a particular case, they would\nsimply tell the Judge to find the defendant guilty. In one\ntypical example, a defendant was found guilty after Cross\ninstructed the Judge to \"find this sucker guilty.\" Id. at 147.\nSome clearly innocent defendants were found guilty as a\nresult. For example, Cross and the Melogranes got the\nJudge to find one defendant guilty even though the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3.

Id.\n\nIn November 1994 a federal grand jury in the Western\nDistrict of Pennsylvania indicted Cross and the Melogranes.5\nCount I alleged that the three violated S 1341 by conspiring\n\"to deprive the citizens of Allegheny County of their\nintangible right to honest services of government\nemployees, furthered by the use of the United States mail.\"6\nThe factual allegations underlying Count I--which were\ndivided into three sections--related to Cross and the\nMelogranes fixing cases both for and against defendants,\nand mailing notices of the dispositions to the parties. The\nfirst section of Count I alleged that they caused 243 cases\nto be dismissed by starting hearings before police officers\narrived to testify or by asking the officers to leave before\nthey testified. The second section alleged that Cross and\nthe Melogranes used their influence over Judge Scheib to\ncause twenty-eight defendants to be found guilty. The third\nsection alleged that they obtained favorable dispositions for\n200 defendants. Count II, which pertained only to the \"to\nbe found guilty\" cases (the second section of Count I),\nalleged that Cross and the Melogranes violated S 241 by\nconspiring to deprive twenty-eight Pennsylvania residents of\ntheir right to a fair and impartial trial.7\n\nBefore trial, Cross and the Melogranes moved under\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 14 to sever Counts I\nand II.8 The District Court denied their motion. It explained\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5. According to the FBI’s lead investigator and the Assistant United\nStates Attorney who prosecuted the case, the Government did not have\nenough evidence to indict Judge Scheib.\n\n6. Count I also   alleged that the defendants conspired to defraud the\nCommonwealth by   depriving it of fines, but the Government did not\nobject when the   District Court submitted the S 1341 count \"to the jury\nas a conspiracy   with the single objective of depriving citizens of the\nhonest services   of the defendants.\" Cross I , 128 F.3d at 147 n.1.\n\n7. The indictment also charged Jules Melograne with ten counts of mail\nfraud. These counts, which are not pertinent here, were severed\npursuant to the defendants’ pretrial motion and were later dismissed.\n\n8. Rule 14 provides in relevant part that a district court may order\n\fseparate trials if it appears that joinder will prejudice a defendant.\n\n                                5\n\n\nthat because \"[t]he criminal acts of one co-conspirator in\nfurtherance of the conspiracy are imputed to all other\nmembers of the conspiracy,\" \"the acts of all the alleged\nconspirators would be admissible even in severed trials.\"\nUnited States v. Cross, Crim. No. 94-233, slip op. at 8 (W.D.\nPa. Aug. 3, 1995). Further, it found that \"the conduct\ncharged is distinct as to each conspiracy,\" and that \"[w]ith\nsuch distinct evidence, the jury will be able to separate the\nevidence.\" Id. The Court rejected the defendants’ claim that\nthey might want to testify as to Count I, but not Count II,\nbecause they \"failed to specify what testimony they wish to\ngive on one count or their reasons for not wishing to testify\non the other.\" Id.\n\nThe jury trial of Cross and the Melogranes lasted three\nmonths. The evidence on both counts was overwhelming.\nThe Government introduced tapes of more than fifty\nconversations, intercepted by FBI surveillance, in which the\nconspirators discussed their plans to fix various cases.\nEach juror heard the tapes and received transcripts of the\nconversations. In addition, the Government presented\ntestimony by FBI Special Agent John Fiore (who\ninvestigated the case-fixing scheme), Suzanne Petrocelly\n(the courtroom clerk), and Catherine Stowe (the Assistant\nDistrict Attorney who prosecuted most of the cases in the\nStatutory Appeals Court). The latter two had cooperated\nwith the FBI’s investigation by keeping informal records of\nthe cases that Cross and the Melogranes fixed. Further, the\nGovernment introduced a notebook in which Nunzio\nMelograne recorded most of the cases that the conspirators\nplanned to fix, including twenty-five of the to-be-found-\nguilty cases. The Government also introduced evidence that\nCross put a star, check mark, or \"c.a.v.\" notation next to a\ncase on his trial calendar to designate the result. Cross I,\n128 F.3d at 147.\n\nThe evidence with respect to the to-be-found-guilty cases\nwas especially powerful. The Government presented either\na statement by one of the conspirators or an entry in\nNunzio Melograne’s notebook to prove each of these counts.\nNunzio Melograne’s notebook demonstrated that Cross and\nthe Melogranes often got defendants found guilty to please\npolice officers and other friends. For instance, one\n\n                                6\n\n\ndefendant was found guilty because an entry in the\nnotebook stated: \"[G]uilty, hard time, Officer M.A. Scott.\"\nAnother entry in the notebook lists two case numbers and\nsays that \"Officer Smith\" wanted the defendants in those\ncases found guilty. Still another defendant was found guilty\nafter Nunzio Melograne wrote in his notebook: \"Hesse,\nguilty, Jules, Hargrove,\" and Jules called Nunzio the\nmorning of the hearing and said, \"[S]tick it in their rear\n\fends. They are bastards.\" On other occasions, Cross and\nthe Melogranes got defendants found guilty because they\ndid not like them or their lawyers. For example, in one to-\nbe-found-guilty case, Cross said to Nunzio Melograne about\nthe defendant’s attorney, \"Screw him. He’s not our friend.\"\n\nMoreover, Cross and the Melogranes boasted of their\nability to get defendants found guilty. The Government\nplayed for the jury a conversation with a local police chief,\ntaped by the FBI, in which Jules Melograne promised to\nmake sure that a defendant was found guilty and bragged\nabout his influence (via his brother Nunzio) over Judge\nScheib:\n\n       I’ll get a’hold [sic] of my brother at home, and uh, if it\n       hasn’t gone out yet . . . make sure there was a\n       conviction on that. I, I told the guys, anytime they want\n       a, you know, conviction . . . . I make a phone call down\n       there, and my brother tells the judge, you know. . ..\n\n       . . . .\n\n       But my brother knows all that stuff inside and out, uh,\n       he’s the judge’s tipstaff. And like I always said, you\n       know, if you wanna--ya know . . . [,] somebody give ya\n       a hard time, some bullshit, yeah, then, uh, you alert\n       my brother down there, baboom, that’s it.\n\nThe jury convicted Cross and the Melogranes on both\ncounts. On direct appeal, their counsel argued that their\nS 241 convictions should be reversed because no decided\ncase had specifically held that S 241 prohibits orchestrating\nguilty verdicts, and that their S 1341 convictions should be\nreversed because the mailed notifications occurred after the\ncompletion of the fraudulent scheme. In Cross I we\nunanimously affirmed their S 241 convictions. The evidence\nintroduced at trial showed that \"Cross and the Melogranes\n\n                                7\n\n\nagreed to use their best efforts to cause the judge in the ‘to\nbe found guilty’ cases to consider factors other than the\nmerits of the case and to find against the defendant.\" 128\nF.3d at 148. Because preexisting law made it clear that\n\"people are entitled to fair adjudication of their guilt before\nan impartial tribunal,\" Cross and the Melogranes had\n\" ‘reasonable warning’ \" that their conduct hindered the\nexercise of constitutional rights, and thus were liable under\nS 241. Id. at 148-50 (quoting United States v. Lanier, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118098\"><a href=\"/opinion/118098/united-states-v-lanier/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">259</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 269 (1997)).\n\nHowever, we reversed their S 1341 convictions. Because\nthe law required mailing notices of dispositions, and\nbecause in each case any deprivation of public employees’\nhonest services was complete before the notice was mailed,\nthe mailings \"were not in furtherance of the alleged\nconspiracy.\" Id. at 150. We remanded to the District Court\nfor resentencing. Id. at 152.\n\fCross and the Melogranes filed a petition for rehearing en\nbanc, in which they raised for the first time their Pelullo\nargument (i.e., that the evidence introduced to prove the\nS 1341 count was so prejudicial that they are entitled to a\nnew trial on the S 241 count).

United States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1076</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1998), they moved in\nthe District Court for a new trial under Pelullo in lieu of\nresentencing. The Court denied their motion, finding that\nthey were not prejudiced by any \"spillover\" evidence\nbecause \"[m]uch of the evidence offered to prove [the S 1341\ncount] would have been admissible in a separate trial on\n[the S 241 count].\" United States v. Cross, Crim. No. 94-\n233, slip op. at 1 (W.D. Pa. June 17, 1998) (mem. order).\nThe Court resentenced Cross and Jules Melograne to\ntwenty-seven months in prison followed by two years of\nsupervised release.9\n\nCross and the Melogranes appealed, invoking Pelullo. We\nagain affirmed without dissent, refusing to reach the Pelullo\nissue because they did not raise it on direct appeal. United\nStates v. Cross (Cross II), Nos. 98-3370 & 98-3371, slip op.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n9. Nunzio Melograne had become too ill to be resentenced, and died after\nCross II (referred to in the paragraph immediately below).\n\n                                8\n\n\nat 3 (3d Cir.

Upon Cross\nand Jules Melograne’s application, the Court granted\ncertificates of appealability enabling them to appeal its\nrejection of their ineffective assistance claim. Cross and\nJules Melograne timely appealed.10\n\nII.

We have jurisdiction to review the order denying\nAppellants’ motion under 28 U.S.C. SS 1291 and 2253.\n11. Evitts involved the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause,\n469 U.S. at 388-89, but the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause\nguarantees federal-court defendants an identical right to effective\nassistance of appellate counsel.

Although Strickland relied on the Sixth Amendment, which \"does not\napply to appellate proceedings,\" Martinez v.

Smith, 528 U.S. at 285\n(stating, in a case decided after Martinez, that Strickland applies to such\nclaims); Mannino, 212 F.3d at 840 n.4 (same).\n\n                                9\n\n\nreasonableness.\" Strickland, 466 U.S. at 688. Second, he\nmust show that there is \"a reasonable probability\"--\"a\nprobability sufficient to undermine confidence in the\noutcome,\" but less than a preponderance of the evidence--\nthat his appeal would have prevailed had counsel’s\nperformance satisfied constitutional requirements. Id. at\n694-95.\n\nBecause failure to satisfy either prong defeats an\nineffective assistance claim, and because it is preferable to\navoid passing judgment on counsel’s performance when\npossible, see id. at 697-98, we begin with the prejudice\nprong. This requires us to determine whether there is a\nreasonable probability that we would have set aside Cross\nand Melograne’s convictions on the S 241 count if their\nappellate counsel had invoked Pelullo. Before making this\ndetermination, we examine Pelullo in some detail.\n\nB. Pelullo\n\nIn Pelullo, the defendant was convicted on forty-nine of\nfifty-four counts of wire fraud, 18 U.S.C. S 1343, and one\ncount of violating the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt\nOrganization Act (\"RICO\"), 18 U.S.C. S 1962, for using a\npublicly held corporation and its affiliates (which he\ncontrolled) to defraud a savings and loan institution and\nthe shareholders of the corporation’s affiliates. Pelullo, 14\nF.3d at 885. On his first appeal, we affirmed his wire fraud\nconviction on one count (\"Count 54\"), but reversed his\nconviction on the other counts (including the RICO count)\nbecause the District Court erroneously admitted\"bank\nrecords and summaries thereof \" that did not qualify under\nany exception to the hearsay rules. Id. We remanded the\ncase for retrial.\n\nAt the second trial, the District Court held that, under\nthe doctrine of collateral estoppel, the judgment of\n\fconviction against the defendant on Count 54 established\nthe facts underlying that count. Id. at 889. Further, the\nCourt allowed the Government to introduce evidence of\nthose facts, including testimony by an alleged Mafia\nunderboss who said that he had extensive dealings with the\ndefendant and portrayed the defendant \"as an associate of\nthe Mafia family.\" Id. at 897, 899.\n\n                                10\n\n\nAfter the defendant was convicted on all counts, he again\nappealed. Id. at 885. We held that the District Court’s\ncollateral estoppel ruling violated the defendant’s Sixth\nAmendment right to a jury trial. Id. at 889-97. Because the\ncollateral estoppel ruling prevented the defendant from\ncontesting the facts underlying Count 54, and because\nthose facts constituted the sole predicate act for the RICO\ncount, we reversed the defendant’s RICO conviction. Id. We\nthen considered whether the evidence pertaining to Count\n54 had a spillover effect \" ‘sufficiently prejudicial to call for\nreversal’ \" of the defendant’s conviction on the forty-eight\nother wire fraud counts. Id. at 897-98 (quoting United\nStates v. Ivic, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"414335\"><a href=\"/opinion/414335/united-states-v-franjo-ivic-nedjelko-sovulj-ivan-cale-and-stipe-ivkosic/\"><span class=\"volume\">700</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">51</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 65 (2d Cir. 1983)). To assess the\nspillover effect, we considered four factors. Id. at 898.\n\nFirst, we looked at \"whether the charges are intertwined\nwith each other.\" Id. (citing United States v. Berkery, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"532534\"><a href=\"/opinion/532534/united-states-v-berkery-john/\"><span class=\"volume\">889</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1281</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1285 (3d Cir. 1989)).13 We reasoned that Count\n54 was \"sufficiently similar to\" the forty-eight wire fraud\ncounts \"to create substantial confusion on the part of the\njury.\" Id. Not only were they all wire fraud counts, but they\nalso alleged \"similar fraud consisting of similar conduct,\nsuch as falsification of corporate documents and diversion\nof corporate funds for personal use,\" and \"described\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n13. In Berkery, the defendant was accused of conspiring to possess and\ndistribute P2P (phenyl-2-propanone, a controlled substance used to\nproduce methamphetamine) and of the substantive offenses of\npossessing and distributing P2P. Berkery, 889 F.2d at 1282. He claimed\nentrapment on the conspiracy count. Id. Because the prevailing law\nrequired a defendant to admit all elements of the counts as to which he\nclaimed entrapment before he could receive a jury instruction on\nentrapment, the defendant admitted all elements of the conspiracy\ncount. Id. After he was convicted on both the conspiracy and substantive\ncounts, but before we ruled on his appeal, the Supreme Court held in\nMathews v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112012\"><a href=\"/opinion/112012/mathews-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">58</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1988), that a defendant is\nentitled to a jury instruction on entrapment even if he denies one or\nmore elements of the crime. In light of Mathews , we reversed the\ndefendant’s conspiracy conviction. Berkery, 889 F.2d at 1285. We also\nreversed his conviction on the substantive counts because they were\n\"closely intertwined\" with the conspiracy count and we could \"readily\nsee\" that the jury might have used his admission of guilt on the\nconspiracy count to convict him on the substantive counts. Id. at 1285-\n86.\n\n                                11\n\fsimilar, if not identical, methods used in the alleged\nfrauds.\" Id. In addition, the counts were framed in\n\"identical language.\" Id. The \"similarities of the counts\" led\nus to conclude that \"the risk of jury confusion is\nsignificant.\" Id.\n\nSecond, we examined \"whether the evidence for the\ndifferent counts was sufficiently distinct to support the\nverdict on other separate counts,\" explaining that \"[i]f the\nevidence was distinct, it is likely that there was no\nprejudicial spillover effect.\" Id. (citing United States v.\nBrown, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"359631\"><a href=\"/opinion/359631/united-states-v-francis-harry-brown-aka-harry-brown-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">583</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">659</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 669 (3d Cir. 1978)). We determined\nthat \"the jury may well have been confused because much\nof the evidence on all counts was similar, e.g. , wire transfer\ndocuments, bank records, and corporate documents.\" Id.\nMoreover, any confusion was exacerbated by the similarity\nof the charges and the nearly identical language used to\nframe them in the indictment. Id.\n\nThird, we ascertained \"whether substantially all the\nevidence introduced to support the invalid conviction would\nhave been admissible to prove other counts, and whether\nthe elimination of the count on which the defendant was\ninvalidly convicted would have significantly changed the\nstrategy of the trial.\" Id. (citing Ivic, 700 F.2d at 65). We\ndetermined that \"the evidence the government introduced to\nreprove Count 54 in the second trial was not admissible to\nprove the other 48 wire fraud counts,\" so \"elimination of the\nRICO count would have significantly changed trial\nstrategy.\" Id. at 899.\n\nFinally, we examined \"the charges, the language that the\ngovernment used, and the evidence introduced during the\ntrial to see whether they [were] ‘of the sort to arouse a\njury’ \" or \"branded [the defendant] with some terms with\n‘decidedly pejorative connotation.’ \" Id. (quoting Ivic, 700\nF.2d at 65). Of the four factors, this one most clearly\nhighlighted the damage done by the evidence related to\nCount 54. Because the District Court allowed the\nGovernment to introduce the evidence supporting Count\n54, the defendant \"was not only branded as a convicted\nfelon and a racketeer by the government, but also portrayed\nas a person associated with the Mafia.\" Id. The Mafia\nunderboss \"testified to extensive dealings with\" the\n\n                                12\n\n\ndefendant and to \"the friendly relationship between\" the\ndefendant and \"the alleged boss of the Philadelphia Mafia.\"\nId.\n\nEven worse, while at the defendant’s first trial he denied\nhaving Mafia ties and testified that he had never even met\nthe underboss, the District Court’s collateral estoppel ruling\nprevented him from contesting the underboss’s devastating\ntestimony. He could not cross-examine the underboss or\ncontradict his testimony because \"the jury would be\ncharged that any testimony of [the defendant] contradicting\n[the underboss] was false as a matter of law by reason of\n\fcollateral estoppel.\" Id. We had \"little doubt\" that the\nMafia’s reputation influenced the jury, especially since the\nfacts underlying Count 54 were \"reproved thoroughly and\ndramatically,\" whereas the other retried counts were proved\nby mundane evidence such as bank records and corporate\ndocuments. Id. Thus we ordered a new trial on the forty-\neight wire fraud counts. Id. at 900.\n\nAs we explain below, Pelullo’s four factors devolve into\ntwo inquiries: (1) whether the jury heard evidence that\nwould have been inadmissible at a trial limited to the\nremaining valid count (i.e., \"spillover\" evidence); and (2) if\nthere was any spillover evidence, whether it was prejudicial\n(i.e., whether it affected adversely the verdict on the\nremaining count). Considered conversely, we have the\nshorthand label \"prejudicial spillover.\"14\n\nAs a backdrop, it is crucial to understand when\nprejudicial spillover may occur. When a defendant is\nconvicted on two counts involving different offenses at a\nsingle trial and an appellate court reverses his conviction\non one of them, prejudicial spillover can occur only if the\nevidence introduced to support the reversed count would\nhave been inadmissible at a trial on the remaining count.\nSee United States v.

It was obvious (and thus did not require\ndirect discussion) that the evidence pertaining to Count 54,\nnone of which was admissible to prove the remaining\ncounts, see 14 F.3d at 899, had prejudiced the defendant.\nIt was readily apparent that spillover evidence likely\nconfused the jury because it was intertwined with the\nevidence supporting the remaining counts. It was similarly\nobvious that the Mafia underboss’s testimony probably\ncolored both the defendant’s trial strategy and ultimately\nthe jury’s verdict on the remaining counts. Accordingly, we\n\fdid not explicitly apply harmless error analysis as a\nsequential step in our analysis. But in cases where the\nprejudicial spillover effect is not so obvious, our precedents\ninstruct that we do so. See, e.g., United States v.

First, was there a spillover of\nevidence from the reversed count that would have been\ninadmissible at a trial limited to the remaining count?\nSecond, if there was any spillover, is it highly probable that\nit did not prejudice the jury’s verdict on the remaining\ncount, i.e., was the error harmless?16 With this\nunderstanding, we now proceed to analyze Appellants’\nclaims.\n\nC. Is it reasonably probable that the Pelullo argument\n       would have prevailed?\n\n1. Rule 404\n\nAppellants contend that the evidence pertaining to the\nfavorable disposition cases in the invalidated S 1341\nconviction could not have been introduced for a proper\npurpose if their trial had been limited to the S 241 count.\nThey insist that this evidence would have been inadmissible\ncharacter evidence under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(a)17\nbecause it could only have suggested that their fixing cases\nin defendants’ favor made them more likely to have fixed\ncases against defendants. In the alternative, they claim that\nthis evidence would have been excluded under Federal Rule\nof Evidence 403 because its prejudicial effect would have\nsubstantially outweighed its probative value. Contrary to\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n15. Other circuit courts similarly consider harm to the remaining counts\nwhen another count is invalidated.

Rule 404(a) provides, with exceptions not relevant here, that\n\"[e]vidence of a person’s character or a trait of character is not\nadmissible for the purpose of proving action in conformity therewith on\na particular occasion.\" Fed. R.

The distinction between\nintrinsic and extrinsic (i.e., \"other acts\" or \"other crimes\")\nevidence is often fuzzy.

Unfortunately, as the D.C.\nCircuit has explained, most circuit courts view evidence as\nintrinsic if it is \"inextricably intertwined\" with the charged\noffense (a definition that elucidates little) or if it \"completes\nthe story\" of the charged offense (a definition so broad that\nit renders Rule 404(b) meaningless).

Cir. 2000); see also id. at 929\n(stating that \"it cannot be that all evidence tending to prove\nthe crime is part of the crime\" because that would make\nRule 404(b) \"a nullity\").\n\nThese are some of the pedagogical problems with\nunderstanding intrinsic evidence. But what does it mean in\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n18. Rule 404(b) also requires the Government to give the defendant\n\"reasonable notice\" when it plans to introduce evidence of uncharged\nmisconduct, but Appellants do not suggest that this provision is relevant\nto our analysis.\n\n                                17\n\n\npractice? For our Court, acts are intrinsic when they\ndirectly prove the charged conspiracy. See Gibbs , 190 F.3d\nat 217-18. Thus we need not proceed further in this thicket\nbecause it is clear that Appellants’ involvement in fixing\ncases in defendants’ favor is not part of the S 241\nconspiracy.19\n\nThus, contrary to the Government’s contention, Rule\n404(b) applies here. Appellants’ acts pertaining to the\nfavorable disposition cases do not directly prove their\nconspiracy to violate Pennsylvania citizens’ right to a fair\n\fand impartial hearing in the to-be-found-guilty cases, and\nthus by any definition are not intrinsic to theS 241 offense.\nIn a trial limited to the S 241 count, Appellants would be\ncharged only with conspiring to engineer guilty verdicts, not\nwith conspiring to fix cases generally. While the evidence\npertaining to the favorable disposition cases helps prove\nAppellants’ broader conspiracy to fix cases, it does not\ndirectly prove that Appellants conspired to get defendants\nfound guilty. Therefore, we must consider whether the\nevidence relating to the favorable disposition cases would\nhave been admissible to prove the S 241 count under Rule\n404(b).\n\nTo satisfy Rule 404(b), evidence of other acts must (1)\nhave a proper evidentiary purpose, (2) be relevant under\nRule 402, (3) satisfy Rule 403 (i.e., not be substantially\nmore prejudicial than probative), and (4) be accompanied\nby a limiting instruction, when requested pursuant to\nFederal Rule of Evidence 105,20 that instructs the jury not\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n19. Accordingly, we express no view on whether\"other acts\" evidence\nthat does not directly prove an element of the charged offense may be\n\"intrinsic\" (and thus exempt from Rule 404(b)) if the other acts were\n\"inextricably intertwined\" with the events underlying the charge, so that\nthe evidence is necessary for the jury to understand how the offense\noccurred or to comprehend crucial testimony.

Appellants insist that the only\npossible relevance to the S 241 count of the evidence\nrelating to the favorable disposition cases was to suggest\ntheir inclination to fix cases, an obviously impermissible\n\fpurpose under Rule 404(a). We disagree.\n\nIn the face of the overwhelming evidence against them,\nCross and the Melogranes attempted to shift the blame to\nJudge Scheib. Their main defenses were (1) that they had\nno opportunity to dictate how cases were resolved because\nJudge Scheib decided every case independently, and (2)\nthat they performed their various court-related\nresponsibilities in good faith and did not intend to influence\ncases’ outcomes. The evidence pertaining to the favorable\ndisposition cases eviscerated both of these defenses.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n21. In the current context, however, it makes little sense to give\nsignificant weight in our analysis of admissibility (as distinct from our\nharmless error analysis) to the absence of a limiting instruction (even if\nit had been requested), since the District Court did not know ex ante\nthat the evidence should be analyzed as if Cross and the Melogranes\nwere charged only with violating S 241. Along similar lines, while\nordinarily a trial judge should require a party offering \"other acts\"\nevidence to articulate clearly the chain of inferences leading from that\nevidence to a material fact, and should explain on the record why (s)he\nadmitted or excluded that evidence, see Murray , 103 F.3d at 316, the\nDistrict Court here could not have been expected to do so with respect\nto evidence that was central to the jointly triedS 1341 count.\n\n                                19\n\n\nFirst, the evidence indicated that, contrary to their\nprotestations at trial, Cross and the Melogranes had an\nopportunity to control Judge Scheib’s decisions. For\ninstance, the evidence that Judge Scheib reached the\ndecisions preordained (or, at the very least, foreshadowed)\nin Nunzio Melograne’s notebook or in the conversations\nintercepted by the FBI showed that they decided, or\ninfluenced Judge Scheib to decide, many cases. Indeed,\nthat Cross and the Melogranes fixed numerous cases in\ndefendants’ favor suggested that they could routinely obtain\nwhatever result they desired, and discredited their\ncontention that Judge Scheib was not subject to their\ninfluence. Their ability to dictate cases’ outcomes showed\nthat they had the opportunity to get defendants found\nguilty, which aided the Government’s allegation that they\nconspired to do so. Cf. Echeverri, 854 F.2d at 644 (holding\nthat testimony that the defendant traveled to Miami to pick\nup five kilograms of cocaine, one year before the alleged\nconspiracy to distribute cocaine began, was admissible\nunder Rule 404(b) because his \"access to a source\" made\nhim more likely to have \"initiated the charged conspiracy\").\n\nSecond, the evidence showed that Cross and the\nMelogranes intended to control cases’ outcomes, and thus\nrefuted their defense of good faith. \"In order to admit\nevidence under the ‘intent’ component of Rule 404(b), intent\nmust be an element of the crime charged and the evidence\noffered must cast light upon the defendant’s intent to\ncommit the crime.\" United States v.

This is\nespecially important when the charged offense requires\nspecific intent, see Strong et al., supra, at 665 & n.36,\nwhich (as noted) S 241 does, see Coleman , 811 F.2d at 808.\n\nCross and the Melogranes engineered favorable\ndispositions for defendants in exchange for various gifts\nand favors. One of their primary methods of obtaining a\nfavorable disposition was to inform a police officer that he\ncould leave before the case in which he was to testify was\ncalled. To ensure the officers’ continued cooperation in their\nscheme, Cross and the Melogranes needed to reward them.\nAs Nunzio Melograne’s notebook attests, they got certain\ndefendants found guilty to please police officers with whom\nthey were collaborating. The evidence of the gifts and\nfavors, and of the officers told to leave court before\ntestifying, was important to enable the jury to understand\nwhy they wanted to curry favor with the police, and thus\nwas probative of their motive in fixing cases against\ndefendants whom police officers did not like.\n\nIn sum, each piece of evidence relating to the favorable\ndisposition cases would have been admissible to prove the\nS 241 count under Rule 404(b) because each was\"probative\nof a material issue other than character.\"22 Huddleston, 485\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n22. Jules Melograne contends that he would have   testified if charged\nonly with violating S 241, as he would not have   had to explain his\ninvolvement in the favorable disposition cases.   But since the evidence\nrelating to those cases was admissible to prove   theS 241 count, this\nargument is unavailing.\n\n                                22\n\n\nU.S. at 686. To be admitted, however, the evidence needed\nto satisfy the requirements of Rule 403, to which we now\nturn.\n\n2. Rule 403\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 403 provides that \"evidence may\nbe excluded if its probative value is substantially\noutweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of\n\fthe issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of\nundue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of\ncumulative evidence.\" It creates a presumption of\nadmissibility.

Evidence cannot be excluded under Rule\n403 merely because its unfairly prejudicial effect is greater\nthan its probative value. Rather, evidence can be kept out\nonly if its unfairly prejudicial effect \"substantially\noutweigh[s]\" its probative value. Fed. R. Evid. 403. As one\nexample, when evidence is highly probative, even a large\nrisk of unfair prejudice may be tolerable.\n\nAppellants insist that the evidence relating to the\nfavorable disposition cases was inflammatory, confusing,\nand cumulative with respect to the S 241 count, and thus\nwould have been excluded under Rule 403. Specifically,\nthey claim the evidence under S 1341 that they asked police\nofficers to leave without testifying, and that they received\ngifts and favors for fixing cases, was unfairly prejudicial\nbecause it led the jury to want to punish them irrespective\nof their guilt on the S 241 count. In addition, they argue\nthat the sheer volume of the evidence introduced to prove\nthe S 1341 count created an unacceptable risk of confusing\nthe jury, and that it unduly delayed the trial, wasted time,\nand was cumulative.\n\nThe evidence in the S 1341 phase of the case that Cross\nand the Melogranes asked police officers to leave before\ntestifying, and that they received gifts and favors for fixing\ncases, was not substantially more prejudicial than\nprobative.23 Rule 404(b) evidence is especially probative\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n23.

This evidence was thus highly\nprobative of their intent and motive.\n\nOn the other side of the balance, the evidence that Cross\nand Melograne instructed police officers to leave before\ntestifying likely angered the jury, as the officers ended up\ngetting paid, at taxpayers’ expense, for not testifying. And\nthe evidence that they received various gifts and favors for\neffecting favorable decisions likely made the jury more\ninclined to want to punish them. But these potentially\nprejudicial aspects of the evidence do not render that\nevidence inadmissible under Rule 403, as they fall far short\nof substantially outweighing their significant probative\nvalue.26 \"Rule 403 does not provide a shield for defendants\nwho engage in outrageous acts, permitting only the crimes\nof Caspar Milquetoasts to be described fully to a jury.

The District\nCourt rejected essentially the same argument when it\ndenied the pretrial severance motion. It explained that \"the\nconduct charged is distinct as to each conspiracy regarding\nthe courts affected, the nature of the conduct, and the\ndefendants involved,\" and that \"[t]here is nothing that\nmakes it appear that a reasonable jury will not be able to\ncompartmentalize the evidence against each defendant,\ndespite the large number of overt acts alleged in Count I.\"\nNot only was the evidence on both counts straightforward\nand easy for jurors to \"compartmentalize,\" but the\nGovernment’s presentation of its case also alleviated\nwhatever slight risk of confusion may have existed. The\nGovernment divided its case into four parts, devoting one\npart to background information about how the Statutory\nAppeals Court operated and about the roles of Cross and\nNunzio Melograne, and the other three to prongs (a), (b),\nand (c) of the indictment (i.e., two parts to the favorable\ndisposition cases, and one part to the to-be-found-guilty\ncases). Before each of the parts which corresponded to a\nprong of the indictment, Special Agent Fiore testified and\nexplained to the jury that the Government was moving on\nto a new portion of its case. Because the evidence was so\nneatly segmented, the jury was unlikely to have been\nconfused about which evidence pertained to which count.\n\nDespite all this, although no individual piece of the\nevidence was substantially more prejudicial than probative\nwith respect to the S 241 count, and although none of it\nposed a threat of confusing the jury that substantially\n_________________________________________________________________\n\ndisposition cases was particularly damaging to him. This argument is a\nred herring. Conspirators are responsible for their co-conspirators’\nreasonably foreseeable acts in furtherance of the conspiracy, e.g.,\nPinkerton, 328 U.S. at 647; Lopez, 271 F.3d at 480, so Jules Melograne\nis just as responsible for the to-be-found-guilty cases in which he did not\nparticipate as for those in which he did. Hence there is no reason why\n\fthe evidence relating to the favorable disposition cases was more\ndamaging to him than to his co-conspirators.\n\n                                26\n\n\noutweighed its probative value, much of it would have been\nexcluded as cumulative in a trial limited to theS 241 count.\nSee Fed.

The evidence supporting theS 241 count\nwas overwhelming. The Government presented either a\nstatement by one of the conspirators or a \"guilty\" entry in\nNunzio Melograne’s notebook to prove each of the to-be-\nfound-guilty cases. Special Agent Fiore testified that the\ndefendants whom the notebook designated to be found\n\"guilty\" were in fact found guilty. Assistant District Attorney\nStowe and Petrocelly, the courtroom clerk, also testified\nthat Cross and the Melogranes got defendants found guilty.\nThe incriminating evidence that came from Appellants’ own\nmouths--the majority of which was admitted in tape-\nrecorded form--was especially damaging. Indeed,\nAppellants’ statements can only be described as shocking.\nFor instance, in a conversation taped by the FBI, Jules\nMelograne bragged to a local police chief about how easily\nhe could get defendants found guilty: \"I told the guys,\nanytime they want a, you know, conviction . . . . I make a\nphone call down there, and my brother tells the judge, you\nknow.\" He added, \"[S]omebody give ya a hard time, some\nbullshit, yeah, then, uh, you alert my brother down there,\nbaboom, that’s it.\" Similarly incriminating statements by\nCross were presented, such as his telling the Judge to \"find\n\n                                28\n\n\nthis sucker guilty\" when a particular defendant was to be\nfound guilty, and his responding to one to-be-found-guilty\nrequest by saying about the defendant, \"[W]e’ll burn her\nass.\" Cross I, 128 F.3d at 147.\n\nBecause the evidence supporting the S 241 count was so\npowerful, it is highly unlikely that the cumulative evidence\nrelating to the favorable disposition cases contributed to the\njudgment. The jury would have gained essentially the same\nknowledge from hearing testimony about a limited number\nof such cases as it gained from hearing the more extensive\ntestimony at the trial. Further, we seriously doubt that the\ncumulative evidence could have affected the outcome in\nlight of the devastating evidence supporting theS 241\ncount. In contrast to Pelullo, where the testimony regarding\nthe defendant’s Mafia ties was admissible only as to the\nreversed count, the most inflammatory evidence presented\nat Cross and Melograne’s trial was that pertaining to the\nremaining count, which was proved largely by Appellants’\ncolorfully worded admissions. And unlike the defendant in\n\fPelullo, Appellants were not collaterally estopped from\nchallenging the evidence to which they now object.\n\nMoreover, as the District Court recognized when it\nrejected Appellants’ severance motion, this is not a case\nwhere the \"evidence pertaining to each count was not, and\nprobably could not have been, segregated at the trial and in\nthe minds of the jurors.\" United States v. De Cavalcante,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"295985\"><a href=\"/opinion/295985/united-states-v-samuel-rizzo-de-cavalcante-in-no-19310-gaetano-dominick/\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1264</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1276 (3d Cir. 1971).28 The evidence on each\ncount was sufficiently straightforward and distinct that the\njury was unlikely to have been confused by the evidence\nrelating to the favorable dispositions. In clear contrast to\nPelullo, 14 F.3d at 898, where both the reversed and the\nremaining counts alleged the same offense (wire fraud) and\nthe problem was compounded by the complicated evidence\nof financial transactions and bank records in that case,\nAppellants were convicted of two very different offenses.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n28. Likewise, the District Court’s reasoning in ruling on the severance\nmotion, along with the other factors discussed above with respect to the\ncumulative evidence, convinces us that it is highly probable that the\njury’s verdict was not affected by the lack of limiting instructions\naccompanying the evidence relating to the favorable disposition cases.\n\n                                29\n\n\nFurther, the District Court admonished the jury that it was\nnot to convict Cross and the Melogranes on one of the\ncharged offenses merely because it found them guilty of the\nother, and \" ‘juries are presumed to follow their\ninstructions.’ \" Zafiro v. United States , </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112812\"><a href=\"/opinion/112812/zafiro-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">506</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">534</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 541\n(1993) (quoting Richardson v. Marsh, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111865\"><a href=\"/opinion/111865/richardson-v-marsh/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 211\n(1987)).\n\nFinally, we cannot accept Appellants’ arguments that\ntheir respective trial strategies would be significantly\ndifferent in a trial limited to the S 241 count. Both Cross\nand Melograne insist that they would have called Judge\nScheib as a witness had they not been charged with\nviolating S 1341. They claim that he could have given\nexculpatory testimony on the to-be-found-guilty cases, but\nthat they did not put him on the stand because of the\ndamaging testimony he would have given on the favorable\ndisposition cases. This argument is not plausible. As the\nGovernment points out, Judge Scheib would surely have\ninvoked his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-\nincrimination. The Government had evidence of Judge\nScheib’s involvement in fixing cases, but not enough to\nindict him. It is inconceivable that he would have risked\ngiving the Government the additional evidence it needed.\n\nConclusion\n\nUnder Pelullo, an appellate court’s decision to reverse one\ncount requires it to reverse the remaining count(s) only if\n(1) some of the evidence introduced to support the reversed\ncount would have been inadmissible at a trial on the\nremaining count(s), and (2) the error is not harmless. While\n\fmuch of the evidence supporting Cross and Melograne’s\nS 1341 convictions would have been excluded as cumulative\nin a trial on the S 241 count, it is highly probable that this\nevidence did not contribute to the jury’s finding that they\nviolated S 241 by conspiring to deprive Pennsylvania\ncitizens of their right to a fair and impartial trial. Because\nthe prejudicial spillover, if any, was harmless error, it is not\nreasonably probable that the Pelullo argument would have\nprevailed on direct appeal had it been raised. Thus\n\n                                30\n\n\nappellate counsel was not constitutionally ineffective, and\nthe District Court’s denial of S 2255 relief is affirmed.\n\nA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n\n                                31\n\f</pre>",
