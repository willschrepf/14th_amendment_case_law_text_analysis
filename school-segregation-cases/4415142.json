In order to receive federal housing\nfunds, the City of Chicago must certify that it is in compliance\nwith a number of federal requirements related to reducing the\ncity’s racial segregation. Albert C. Hanna’s suit against the\nCity alleges that it violated the False Claims Act because its\npolicies—in particular, “aldermanic privilege” and strategic\nzoning of relatively wealthy neighborhoods—have actually\n\f2                                                  No. 15-3305\n\nincreased segregation, making its certifications false. But, as\nthe district court properly recognized, Hanna has not alleged\nthe circumstances of the purported fraud with sufficient par-\nticularity to satisfy Federal Rule of Procedure 9(b). We there-\nfore affirm its judgment.\n                               I\n    Chicago is, by its own admission, a “highly segregated\ncity” and has been for more than 50 years. CITY OF CHICAGO,\n2010–2014 CONSOLIDATED PLAN 19 (2010). Whites predomi-\nnately live on the North, Northwest, Southwest and far South\nSides, while African-Americans live mostly on the West and\nSouth Sides. Id. at 20. (We omit details about other racial or\nethnic groups, of which there are many, because they are not\ncentral to this case.) This geographic distribution “has re-\nmained fundamentally constant” since the 1980 census. Id.\n    Hanna is a long-time resident of Chicago’s Lincoln Park\nneighborhood. For more than half a century, his professional\nand personal activities have included real estate develop-\nment, real estate financing, civic affairs, and philanthropy in\nChicago. He has “a particular concern for providing afforda-\nble housing in quality neighborhoods,” and so filed his origi-\nnal qui tam complaint in 2011. The United States declined to\nintervene in 2013. We evaluate the allegations in his amended\ncomplaint; we assume the truth of these allegations for pre-\nsent purposes. Tricontinental Indus., Ltd. v. Pricewaterhouse-\nCoopers, LLP, 475 F.3d 824, 833 (7th Cir. 2007).\n    Hanna alleges that during the six years before he filed this\nsuit, the City knowingly made false claims and certifications\nto the U.S. government. One such representation was that it\nhad complied—and would comply—with certain civil rights\n\fNo. 15-3305                                                   3\n\nrequirements. It did this in order to receive more than $1 bil-\nlion in funds from federal programs administered by the U.S.\nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).\nThose requirements arise under several laws. Hanna alleges\nthat the City “was required … to certify that it [would] admin-\nister each grant in compliance with Title VI, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d,\net seq. and implementing regulations at 24 C.F.R. Part 1,” “the\nFair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3601, et seq., and its implement-\ning regulations at 24 C.F.R. Part 100,” and “42 U.S.C.\n§§ 608(e)(5), 5304(b)(2), and 12705(b)(15) and applicable HUD\nregulations.” Finally, he asserts that “[a]s defined by HUD\nand by caselaw, the … obligation [affirmatively to pursue fair\nhousing] requires the City to conduct ‘[a] comprehensive re-\nview of [its] laws, regulations, and administrative policies,\nprocedures and practices[, and a]n assessment of conditions,\nboth public and private, affecting fair housing choice for all\nprotected classes.” He has not, however, given any further de-\ntails about which specific statutory and regulatory provisions\nthe City violated, what those provisions said, or how exactly\nthe City’s conduct violated them.\n   Hanna separates Chicago’s neighborhoods into two cate-\ngories: those with “lower poverty rates, good community ser-\nvices and commercial amenities, job opportunities, safe\nneighborhoods and good schools” he calls “areas of oppor-\ntunity”; those lacking those attributes he labels “low-oppor-\ntunity areas.” The City knew, Hanna says, which neighbor-\nhoods were typified by segregated living patterns (more than\n75% minority population) and which were typified by high\npoverty rates (more than 40% of population with incomes be-\nlow the federal poverty line). The City also knew that there\n\f4                                                   No. 15-3305\n\nwas predictable overlap between these categories: the desira-\nble areas had larger White populations and smaller African-\nAmerican and Latino populations than Chicago in general.\n    Hanna asserts that despite its knowledge of these facts and\nits obligation to take affirmative steps to secure fair housing,\nthe City knowingly administered its affordable housing and\nfunding programs, along with its zoning and land use laws,\nwith the purpose and effect of locating affordable, multifam-\nily rental housing units in the less desirable areas and discour-\naging their location in the better neighborhoods. Doing so\nperpetuated and intensified the already-existing racial and\nethnic segregation of Chicago’s neighborhoods.\n    The City allegedly enacted these goals through two poli-\ncies: “aldermanic privilege” and disproportionately down-\nzoning advantaged neighborhoods—that is, rezoning areas\nsuitable for multifamily development so as to prevent or limit\nnew construction of such projects. Chicago is divided into 50\nwards, each of which elects an alderman to sit on the city\ncouncil. Under “aldermanic privilege,” the City grants each\nalderman the “full authority to determine whether and where\naffordable, multifamily rental housing will be built and reno-\nvated in the ward.” According to Hanna, aldermen in the de-\nsirable, largely White areas used their authority to prevent\nsuch housing from being built in their wards.\n    Through these devices, the City directed hundreds of mil-\nlions of dollars in federal funds for affordable housing pri-\nmarily into racially or ethnically segregated, low-income ar-\neas. In the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, when a majority of the pro-\njects built with these funds were not controlled by the City,\nroughly half of the affordable, multifamily rental housing was\n\fNo. 15-3305                                                   5\n\nlocated in areas that were already well-to-do. In the 1990s, af-\nter the Chicago City Council began administering the funds,\nthat percentage declined to only ten percent. During the six\nyears covered by Hanna’s complaint, the City approved fund-\ning of more than 2,600 housing units in 35 developments for\nlow- and moderate-income families and children. Seven per-\ncent of those units were located in wealthier areas; 93% were\nlocated in low-income areas.\n    The complaint also contends that the City grants aldermen\ncontrol over zoning, land use, building codes, and decisions\nabout affordable housing funding and location within their\nwards. Aldermen in primarily White, higher-income neigh-\nborhoods use this authority to “downzone” areas suitable for\nmultifamily development so that this use would be prohibited\nor limited. The City’s 2004 Zoning Ordinance also downzoned\nmany advantaged areas, thus preventing the building of af-\nfordable, multifamily housing unless the alderman person-\nally intervenes to rezone parcels for such use.\n    According to the Mayor’s Zoning Reform Commission,\nthe 2004 Zoning Ordinance’s stated purpose was to “reinforce\n… established patterns” and to “preserve neighborhood char-\nacter.” But Hanna contends that this rationale was a\nsmokescreen: the true purpose and effect was to limit devel-\nopment of affordable, multifamily housing units—and there-\nfore opportunities for African-American and Latino fami-\nlies—in predominantly White neighborhoods. The City also\ndownzoned or applied landmark status to more than 5,200\nacres of private, residentially zoned land. (The City’s Historic\nPreservation Ordinance severely limits redevelopment of lo-\ncations designated as “landmarks.”) Nearly two-thirds of that\nterritory was within desirable areas. Meanwhile, the City did\n\f6                                                  No. 15-3305\n\nnot analyze or disclose in its five-year “Consolidated Plans”\n(submitted to HUD in 2004 and 2010) how its zoning and land\nuse practices affect fair housing options for African-American\nand Latino families.\n    Hanna sued the City under the False Claims Act (FCA),\n31 U.S.C. § 3729(a)(1)(A) and (B), alleging that the City had\nfalsely certified compliance with its civil rights obligations\nwhile perpetuating policies and practices that increased resi-\ndential segregation. Based on these certifications, it submitted\nclaims that yielded millions of dollars in funds from federal\nprograms, and thus defrauded the U.S. government. The City\nmoved under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) to dis-\nmiss the complaint for failure to state a claim. The district\ncourt initially dismissed the complaint without prejudice,\nfinding that Hanna had not pleaded the alleged fraud with\nsufficient specificity, and granted Hanna leave to amend.\nHanna filed an amended complaint, which the City once\nagain moved to dismiss. The district court granted the City’s\nmotion, this time with prejudice, and Hanna appealed.\n                               II\n    We review the district court’s decision to grant the City’s\nmotion to dismiss de novo. Tricontinental, 475 F.3d at 833. In\nrelevant part, the FCA imposes liability on any person who\n“knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or\nfraudulent claim for payment or approval” or “knowingly\nmakes, uses, or causes to be made or used, a false record or\nstatement material to a false or fraudulent claim.” 31 U.S.C.\n§ 3729(1)(A), (B). To prove an FCA claim, Hanna must show\n(1) that the defendant made a statement in order to receive\nmoney from the government; (2) that the statement was false;\nand (3) that the defendant knew the statement was false. U.S.\n\fNo. 15-3305                                                     7\n\nex rel. Yannacopoulos v. Gen. Dynamics, 652 F.3d 818, 822 (7th\nCir. 2011).\n    Because it is an anti-fraud statute, claims under the FCA\nare “subject to the heightened pleading requirements of Rule\n9(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.” U.S. ex rel. Gross\nv. AIDS Research Alliance-Chicago, 415 F.3d 601, 604 (7th Cir.\n2005) (internal citation omitted). This means that the plaintiff\nmust “state with particularity the circumstances constituting\nfraud or mistake.” FED. R. CIV. P. 9(b). To meet this standard,\nthe plaintiff must allege “the who, what, when, where, and\nhow: the first paragraph of any newspaper story.” DiLeo v.\nErnst & Young, 901 F.2d 624, 627 (7th Cir. 1990). That includes\n“the identity of the person making the misrepresentation, the\ntime, place, and content of the misrepresentation, and the\nmethod by which the misrepresentation was communicated\nto the plaintiff.” U.S. ex rel. Grenadyor v. Ukrainian Vill. Phar-\nmacy, Inc., 772 F.3d 1102, 1106 (7th Cir. 2014) (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted), cert. denied, 136 S. Ct. 49 (2015).\n    Before addressing the merits, we need to say a word about\nwhat exactly is before us for review. Hanna’s briefs on appeal\nset out a number of the statutes and regulations with which\nthe City allegedly falsely certified compliance—his pleadings,\nhowever, did not. Hanna argues that the statutes and regula-\ntions provided in his briefs to this court may be considered\nalong with his pleadings because a “plaintiff need not put all\nof the essential facts in the complaint” but instead “may add\nthem by affidavit or brief—even a brief on appeal.” Hrubec v.\nNat’l R.R. Passenger Corp., 981 F.2d 962, 963–64 (7th Cir. 1992).\n  This is true for pleading under Rule 8, which applies to\nmost pleadings and requires only a “short and plain state-\nment of the claim showing that pleader is entitled to relief.”\n\f8                                                     No. 15-3305\n\nFED. R. CIV. P. 8. Rule 8 requires notice pleading, not fact plead-\ning. Swanson v. Citibank, N.A., 614 F.3d 400, 404 (7th Cir. 2010).\nThe party defending the adequacy of a complaint may point\nto facts in a brief or affidavit “in order to show that there is a\nstate of facts within the scope of the complaint that if proved\n(a matter for trial) would entitle him to judgment.” Early v.\nBankers Life & Cas. Co., 959 F.2d 75, 79 (7th Cir. 1992). Nothing\nin Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 (2007), or Ashcroft\nv. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 (2009), changed that rule; those cases\nsimply emphasized that the pleadings must present a plausi-\nble claim for relief.\n    Rule 9(b), however, is an exception to the notice pleading\nregime. Fraud and mistake must be pleaded with particular-\nity; the pleader is not free to hold back and add facts via affi-\ndavit or brief. Indeed, the purpose of Rule 9(b) is to “force the\nplaintiff to do more than the usual investigation before filing\nhis complaint.” Ackerman v. Nw. Mut. Life Ins. Co., 172 F.3d 467,\n469 (7th Cir. 1999). We thus evaluate Hanna’s allegations only\nas they appear in his complaint.\n    On to the merits. The City argues that Hanna’s complaint\ndoes not satisfy Rule 9(b) because it gives no information\nabout which regulatory provisions Hanna thinks the City vi-\nolated; it does not even draw a link between the statutes\nHanna is now citing and any particular alleged false certifica-\ntion. The City has a point. Where the allegedly false certifica-\ntion relates to a failure to comply with certain statutory and\nregulatory provisions, the plaintiff should be able to tell the\nCity which ones it flouted, and how and when. If the particu-\nlarity requirement is meant to ensure more thorough investi-\ngation before filing, it is not too much to ask that one aspect\nof that investigation include the specific provisions of law\n\fNo. 15-3305                                                        9\n\nwhose violation made the certification of compliance false.\nMoreover, if, as in this case, a defendant is presented only\nwith an undifferentiated raft of statutory and regulatory pro-\nvisions, it will be nearly impossible for the defendant to pre-\npare a defense. And the district court will find it quite diffi-\ncult, on a motion to dismiss, to determine whether the defend-\nant actually falsely certified compliance with any specific pro-\nvision.\n     Note that we are not saying that plaintiffs in Hanna’s po-\nsition must list the City’s promises with any more particular-\nity than that with which the City made them. Unlike the\nNinth, Sixth, and Second Circuits, we have never demanded\nthat a plaintiff explain in her complaint why the claim was\nfalse. See Cooper v. Pickett, 137 F.3d 616, 625 (9th Cir. 1997);\nFrank v. Dana Corp., 547 F.3d 564, 570 (6th Cir. 2008); Rombach\nv. Chang, 355 F.3d 164, 170 (2d Cir. 2004). Although we men-\ntioned in U.S. ex rel. Garst v. Lockheed-Martin Corp. that the dis-\ntrict court instructed the plaintiff to state why the claims were\nfraudulent, our opinion does not hold that it was necessary to\ndo so under Rule 9(b). See 328 F.3d 374, 376 (7th Cir. 2003).\nSimilarly, Gensler v. Strabala, describes the Rule 9(b) standard\nsomewhat informally as “what [the defendant] said and why\nit is false.” 764 F.3d 735, 737 (7th Cir. 2014). But neither of these\ncases marked a break with past precedent. Gross is inapposite;\nit dealt with whether the plaintiff had sufficiently alleged that\nthe defendant’s allegedly false statement was meant to “coax\na payment of money from the government.” 415 F.3d at 604.\n    Hanna’s particularity problems do not end with his failure\nto be specific about which statutes or regulations that the City\nviolated. He also does not allege the “time, place, … and the\nmethod by which the misrepresentation was communicated\n\f10                                                    No. 15-3305\n\nto the plaintiff.” Grenadyor, 772 F.3d at 1106. Beyond the fact\nthat the certifications were made yearly, “typically in Decem-\nber,” Hanna says nothing more about timing. Nor does he al-\nlege the place, either the physical location or the specific doc-\numents.\n     Finally, he does not indicate how the allegedly false certi-\nfication was communicated to him. Although Hanna may\nhave been able to plead facts about the relevant documents on\ninformation and belief if he had shown they were “not acces-\nsible” to him and provided “the grounds for his suspicions,”\nPirelli Armstrong Tire Corp. Retiree Med. Benefits Trust v.\nWalgreen Co., 631 F.3d 436, 443 (7th Cir. 2011), he did neither.\nIn fact, the documents in question are probably publicly ac-\ncessible. This may be the real problem with Hanna’s case: the\nFCA is meant to encourage whistleblowing by insiders, and\nHanna seems to have no insider knowledge. See Cause of Ac-\ntion v. Chicago Transit Auth., 815 F.3d 267, 273 (7th Cir. 2016)\n(noting that Congress in enacting the FCA sought “the golden\nmean between adequate incentives for whistle-blowing insid-\ners with genuinely valuable information and discouragement\nof opportunistic plaintiffs who have no significant infor-\nmation to contribute of their own” (quoting U.S. ex rel. Spring-\nfield Terminal Ry. Co. v. Quinn, 14 F.3d 645, 649 (D.C. Cir. 1994)).\nFor a variety of reasons, therefore, Hanna’s complaint was\nproperly dismissed.\n                                III\n     We AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.\n\f",

Part 1,” “the\nFair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3601, et seq., and its implement-\ning regulations at 24 C.F.R. Part 100,” and “42 U.S.C.\n§§ 608(e)(5), 5304(b)(2), and 12705(b)(15) and applicable HUD\nregulations.” Finally, he asserts that “[a]s defined by HUD\nand by caselaw, the … obligation [affirmatively to pursue fair\nhousing] requires the City to conduct ‘[a] comprehensive re-\nview of [its] laws, regulations, and administrative policies,\nprocedures and practices[, and a]n assessment of conditions,\nboth public and private, affecting fair housing choice for all\nprotected classes.” He has not, however, given any further de-\ntails about which specific statutory and regulatory provisions\nthe City violated, what those provisions said, or how exactly\nthe City’s conduct violated them.\n   Hanna separates Chicago’s neighborhoods into two cate-\ngories: those with “lower poverty rates, good community ser-\nvices and commercial amenities, job opportunities, safe\nneighborhoods and good schools” he calls “areas of oppor-\ntunity”; those lacking those attributes he labels “low-oppor-\ntunity areas.” The City knew, Hanna says, which neighbor-\nhoods were typified by segregated living patterns (more than\n75% minority population) and which were typified by high\npoverty rates (more than 40% of population with incomes be-\nlow the federal poverty line). The City also knew that there\n\f4                                                   No. 15-3305\n\nwas predictable overlap between these categories: the desira-\nble areas had larger White populations and smaller African-\nAmerican and Latino populations than Chicago in general.\n    Hanna asserts that despite its knowledge of these facts and\nits obligation to take affirmative steps to secure fair housing,\nthe City knowingly administered its affordable housing and\nfunding programs, along with its zoning and land use laws,\nwith the purpose and effect of locating affordable, multifam-\nily rental housing units in the less desirable areas and discour-\naging their location in the better neighborhoods. Doing so\nperpetuated and intensified the already-existing racial and\nethnic segregation of Chicago’s neighborhoods.\n    The City allegedly enacted these goals through two poli-\ncies: “aldermanic privilege” and disproportionately down-\nzoning advantaged neighborhoods—that is, rezoning areas\nsuitable for multifamily development so as to prevent or limit\nnew construction of such projects. Chicago is divided into 50\nwards, each of which elects an alderman to sit on the city\ncouncil. Under “aldermanic privilege,” the City grants each\nalderman the “full authority to determine whether and where\naffordable, multifamily rental housing will be built and reno-\nvated in the ward.” According to Hanna, aldermen in the de-\nsirable, largely White areas used their authority to prevent\nsuch housing from being built in their wards.\n    Through these devices, the City directed hundreds of mil-\nlions of dollars in federal funds for affordable housing pri-\nmarily into racially or ethnically segregated, low-income ar-\neas. In the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, when a majority of the pro-\njects built with these funds were not controlled by the City,\nroughly half of the affordable, multifamily rental housing was\n\fNo. 15-3305                                                   5\n\nlocated in areas that were already well-to-do. In the 1990s, af-\nter the Chicago City Council began administering the funds,\nthat percentage declined to only ten percent. During the six\nyears covered by Hanna’s complaint, the City approved fund-\ning of more than 2,600 housing units in 35 developments for\nlow- and moderate-income families and children. Seven per-\ncent of those units were located in wealthier areas; 93% were\nlocated in low-income areas.\n    The complaint also contends that the City grants aldermen\ncontrol over zoning, land use, building codes, and decisions\nabout affordable housing funding and location within their\nwards. Aldermen in primarily White, higher-income neigh-\nborhoods use this authority to “downzone” areas suitable for\nmultifamily development so that this use would be prohibited\nor limited. The City’s 2004 Zoning Ordinance also downzoned\nmany advantaged areas, thus preventing the building of af-\nfordable, multifamily housing unless the alderman person-\nally intervenes to rezone parcels for such use.\n    According to the Mayor’s Zoning Reform Commission,\nthe 2004 Zoning Ordinance’s stated purpose was to “reinforce\n… established patterns” and to “preserve neighborhood char-\nacter.” But Hanna contends that this rationale was a\nsmokescreen: the true purpose and effect was to limit devel-\nopment of affordable, multifamily housing units—and there-\nfore opportunities for African-American and Latino fami-\nlies—in predominantly White neighborhoods. The City also\ndownzoned or applied landmark status to more than 5,200\nacres of private, residentially zoned land. (The City’s Historic\nPreservation Ordinance severely limits redevelopment of lo-\ncations designated as “landmarks.”) Nearly two-thirds of that\nterritory was within desirable areas. Meanwhile, the City did\n\f6                                                  No. 15-3305\n\nnot analyze or disclose in its five-year “Consolidated Plans”\n(submitted to HUD in 2004 and 2010) how its zoning and land\nuse practices affect fair housing options for African-American\nand Latino families.\n    Hanna sued the City under the False Claims Act (FCA),\n31 U.S.C. § 3729(a)(1)(A) and (B), alleging that the City had\nfalsely certified compliance with its civil rights obligations\nwhile perpetuating policies and practices that increased resi-\ndential segregation. Based on these certifications, it submitted\nclaims that yielded millions of dollars in funds from federal\nprograms, and thus defrauded the U.S. government. The City\nmoved under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) to dis-\nmiss the complaint for failure to state a claim. The district\ncourt initially dismissed the complaint without prejudice,\nfinding that Hanna had not pleaded the alleged fraud with\nsufficient specificity, and granted Hanna leave to amend.\nHanna filed an amended complaint, which the City once\nagain moved to dismiss. The district court granted the City’s\nmotion, this time with prejudice, and Hanna appealed.\n                               II\n    We review the district court’s decision to grant the City’s\nmotion to dismiss de novo. Tricontinental, 475 F.3d at 833. In\nrelevant part, the FCA imposes liability on any person who\n“knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or\nfraudulent claim for payment or approval” or “knowingly\nmakes, uses, or causes to be made or used, a false record or\nstatement material to a false or fraudulent claim.” 31 U.S.C.\n§ 3729(1)(A), (B). To prove an FCA claim, Hanna must show\n(1) that the defendant made a statement in order to receive\nmoney from the government; (2) that the statement was false;\nand (3) that the defendant knew the statement was false.

Hanna’s briefs on appeal\nset out a number of the statutes and regulations with which\nthe City allegedly falsely certified compliance—his pleadings,\nhowever, did not. Hanna argues that the statutes and regula-\ntions provided in his briefs to this court may be considered\nalong with his pleadings because a “plaintiff need not put all\nof the essential facts in the complaint” but instead “may add\nthem by affidavit or brief—even a brief on appeal.” Hrubec v.\nNat’l R.R.

Fraud and mistake must be pleaded with particular-\nity; the pleader is not free to hold back and add facts via affi-\ndavit or brief. Indeed, the purpose of Rule 9(b) is to “force the\nplaintiff to do more than the usual investigation before filing\nhis complaint.” Ackerman v. Nw. Mut. Life Ins.

We thus evaluate Hanna’s allegations only\nas they appear in his complaint.\n    On to the merits. The City argues that Hanna’s complaint\ndoes not satisfy Rule 9(b) because it gives no information\nabout which regulatory provisions Hanna thinks the City vi-\nolated; it does not even draw a link between the statutes\nHanna is now citing and any particular alleged false certifica-\ntion. The City has a point. Where the allegedly false certifica-\ntion relates to a failure to comply with certain statutory and\nregulatory provisions, the plaintiff should be able to tell the\nCity which ones it flouted, and how and when. If the particu-\nlarity requirement is meant to ensure more thorough investi-\ngation before filing, it is not too much to ask that one aspect\nof that investigation include the specific provisions of law\n\fNo. 15-3305                                                        9\n\nwhose violation made the certification of compliance false.\nMoreover, if, as in this case, a defendant is presented only\nwith an undifferentiated raft of statutory and regulatory pro-\nvisions, it will be nearly impossible for the defendant to pre-\npare a defense. And the district court will find it quite diffi-\ncult, on a motion to dismiss, to determine whether the defend-\nant actually falsely certified compliance with any specific pro-\nvision.\n     Note that we are not saying that plaintiffs in Hanna’s po-\nsition must list the City’s promises with any more particular-\nity than that with which the City made them. Unlike the\nNinth, Sixth, and Second Circuits, we have never demanded\nthat a plaintiff explain in her complaint why the claim was\nfalse. See Cooper v.

Although we men-\ntioned in U.S. ex rel. Garst v.

But neither of these\ncases marked a break with past precedent. Gross is inapposite;\nit dealt with whether the plaintiff had sufficiently alleged that\nthe defendant’s allegedly false statement was meant to “coax\na payment of money from the government.” 415 F.3d at 604.\n    Hanna’s particularity problems do not end with his failure\nto be specific about which statutes or regulations that the City\nviolated. He also does not allege the “time, place, … and the\nmethod by which the misrepresentation was communicated\n\f10                                                    No. 15-3305\n\nto the plaintiff.” Grenadyor, 772 F.3d at 1106. Beyond the fact\nthat the certifications were made yearly, “typically in Decem-\nber,” Hanna says nothing more about timing. Nor does he al-\nlege the place, either the physical location or the specific doc-\numents.\n     Finally, he does not indicate how the allegedly false certi-\nfication was communicated to him. Although Hanna may\nhave been able to plead facts about the relevant documents on\ninformation and belief if he had shown they were “not acces-\nsible” to him and provided “the grounds for his suspicions,”\nPirelli Armstrong Tire Corp.
