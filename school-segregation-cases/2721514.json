The jury awarded damages,\r\nand the court rendered judgment and, in a later hearing, awarded appellees attorney's fees.  APD\r\nappeals the trial court's judgment.  We will reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand for\r\na new trial.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><center><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAustin police officers typically serve as patrol officers or in specialized assignments. \r\nAlthough specialized assignments entail some of the same duties as patrol duty, they often have a\r\nspecific focus and include assignments to the warrants divisions, D.A.R.E. (Drug Abuse Resistance\r\nEducation) unit, canine unit, traffic unit, motorcycle unit, horse-mounted unit, narcotics unit, and\r\ncriminal intelligence unit.  Whether an officer serves as a patrol officer or in a specialized\r\nassignment, he or she has identical rank, pay classifications, job benefits, and promotional\r\nopportunities.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn 1979, APD adopted the first of several policies governing how an officer could\r\napply for a specialized assignment, the criteria for serving in a specialized assignment, how long an\r\nofficer could hold such an assignment before being required to rotate back to patrol duty, and how\r\nlong an officer had to serve on patrol duty before becoming eligible to apply for another specialized\r\nassignment.  The initial APD policy allowed an officer to serve for three years in a specialized\r\nassignment but required officers to return to patrol duty for twelve months before becoming eligible\r\nfor another specialized assignment.  Later that year, APD amended the policy by granting the APD\r\ndivision commander discretion to retain senior officers in a specialized assignment beyond the three\r\nyear period based on job performance. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn 1990, APD again amended its specialized assignment policy, allowing an officer\r\nto apply for an extension of a specialized assignment when a transfer would not be in the best interest\r\nof the department.  The 1990 amendments also implemented an annual review of officer\r\nperformance, after which a reviewing commander had discretion to reassign an officer in a\r\nspecialized assignment to patrol or retain the officer in the special assignment.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBy the mid-1990s, extensions of police officers' specialized assignments were\r\nfrequent; consequently, officers were holding their respective assignments longer, resulting in fewer\r\nopportunities for other officers to rotate into specialized assignments.  In 1993, Assistant Chief Ray\r\nSanders requested a committee be formed to modify APD's specialized assignment policy.  Sanders\r\nappointed Commander Cecil Huff as chairman of the committee and indicated that he wanted the\r\ncommittee to ensure that the selection process for specialized assignments was fair and to review the\r\nappeals process for officers who were not selected.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe committee produced a draft of a new policy but could not reach a consensus on\r\nhow long an officer could stay in a specialized assignment before being required to transfer. </span>\r\nDissatisfied with the draft because it contained no such time limits, Sanders met with the committee\r\nto discuss the policy; still, it reached no consensus on time limits.  Finally, Huff formed a second\r\ncommittee comprised of different members.  The second committee produced another draft<span>.  APD\r\nexecutive staff considered the second committee's recommendations and created General Order 712\r\n(\"Policy 712\").  Policy 712 imposed a five year cap on specialized assignments, removed any\r\ndiscretion which might extend an officer's assignment beyond five years, and established a rotation\r\npolicy requiring officers who had served in a specialized assignment to return to patrol duty for at\r\nleast three years before serving in another specialized assignment.  The policy provided that the most\r\ntenured personnel would be rotated first.  Policy 712 took effect in February 1994.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAfter APD adopted Policy 712, twenty-two plaintiffs brought suit claiming age\r\ndiscrimination.  Eight plaintiffs were non suited, and an additional plaintiff was dismissed by\r\nagreement.  When the trial commenced, the thirteen remaining plaintiffs proceeded on their claim\r\nof direct and intentional age discrimination resulting from APD's adoption of Policy 712.  They\r\nfurther asserted at trial that the assignment and transfer policy in effect constituted a seniority system. \r\nTwo of the thirteen plaintiffs also asserted retaliation claims.  The plaintiffs alleged that the transfer\r\npolicy had a disparate impact on them but did not pursue that claim at trial.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA jury found for all thirteen plaintiffs on the theory of age discrimination and against\r\nthe two plaintiffs who alleged retaliation.  At the conclusion of the jury trial, the trial court held a\r\nhearing, received evidence, and awarded attorney's fees to the prevailing parties.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAPD appeals the trial court's judgment, contending that appellees failed to prove an\r\nessential element of their claim entitling them to judgment, arguing that there is legally or factually\r\ninsufficient evidence to support the jury's finding that the adoption of Policy 712 constituted\r\nintentional age discrimination, and asserting that the award of damages and attorney's fees was\r\nimproper.</span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><center><strong>DISCUSSION</strong></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn its first issue, APD argues that the district court erred by rendering judgment for\r\nappellees because they failed to obtain a jury finding that they suffered any \"adverse employment\r\naction\" at the hands of APD, focusing on appellees' complaints of unwanted transfers under Policy\r\n712.  APD objected to the omission of this element at trial, preserving the issue for appeal, and\r\nrequests that we reverse and render judgment on behalf of APD.  APD relies upon the <em>McDonnell\r\nDouglas</em> method of proof in support of its position.  <em>See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411\r\nU.S. 792 (1973).  In the alternative, APD requests that we remand the cause for a new trial on the\r\nbasis that, even if found, evidence that the policy required transfer and lateral rotation is legally and\r\nfactually insufficient to prove that the officers suffered any adverse employment action through\r\napplication of the policy.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><strong><em>Standards of Review</em></strong></span><span><em></em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe review a district court's submission of controlling issues <em>de novo</em>. <em> Continental\r\nCas.

It awarded each plaintiff monetary compensation for the discrimination. \r\n Appellants do not expressly challenge the finding that Policy 712 was a seniority system. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe must decide whether, in addition, the officers were also required to prove that\r\nthey suffered an \"adverse employment action\"--in other words, whether application of the policy\r\nconstituted an employment practice materially adverse to them that caused them injury.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><strong><em></em></strong></span><span><strong><em>Relevant Statutes</em></strong></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn asserting their age discrimination claims, appellees alleged violations of the Texas\r\nCommission on Human Rights Act (\"the Act\").<sup> (1)</sup></span><span>  Tex.

In a disparate treatment case,\r\nan employer treats some people less favorably than others based upon a prohibited trait. \r\n<em>International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. United States</em>, 431 U.S. 324, 335-36 n.15 (1977).  In a\r\ndisparate impact case, an employer may be liable where a facially neutral practice has a\r\ndisproportionate impact on a protected group.  <em>Griggs v. Duke Power Co.</em>, 401 U.S. 424, 428, 432-33\r\n(1971).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA plaintiff who sues an employer under either the federal or Texas statutes can prove\r\ndiscrimination by different methods of proof.  Courts recognize two types of employment\r\ndiscrimination cases.  <em>Quantum</em>, 47 S.W.3d at 476.  The first is the \"pretext\" case, demonstrated by\r\nindirect or inferential proof, in which the plaintiff's ultimate goal is to show that the employer's\r\nstated reason for its adverse action against the employee was a pretext for discrimination. <em> Id</em>.; <em>Texas\r\nDep't of Community Affairs v. Burdine</em>, 450 U.S. 248, 256 (1981); <em>McDonnell Douglas</em>, 411 U.S.\r\nat 802-05.  The second type of case is the \"mixed-motive\" case, in which the plaintiff can show by\r\ndirect evidence the employer's discriminatory animus in making the employment decision with\r\nrespect to the employee. <em> Quantum</em>, 47 S.W.3d at 476.  Once shown, the employer must then prove\r\nthat it would have made the same decision for legitimate reasons even without the discriminatory\r\nmotive.  <em>Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins</em>, 490 U.S. 228, 244-45 (1989).  How a case is classified\r\ndepends upon whether there is direct evidence of an illegitimate criterion.  <em>Quantum, </em>47 S.W.3d at\r\n476.  In either event, the case arises from an employment decision or practice adversely affecting the\r\nemployee. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDiscrimination can be shown indirectly through circumstantial evidence by following\r\nthe \"pretext\" method of proof.  <em>See McDonnell Douglas</em>,<em> </em>411 U.S. at 802-05.  In <em>McDonnell\r\nDouglas,</em> the United States Supreme Court set out the order and allocation of proof to be followed\r\nin a pretext case.  <em>Quantum,</em> 47 S.W.3d at 477.  The burden shifting framework requires a plaintiff\r\nto establish a <em>prima facie</em> case of discrimination by showing that he or she was: (1) within the\r\nprotected age group; (2) adversely affected or suffered an adverse employment action; and (3)\r\nsimilarly situated non-protected class members were not treated similarly.  <em>McDonnell Douglas</em>, 411\r\nU.S. at 801-03; <em>see also Jaso</em>, 6 S.W.3d at 328.  Once the plaintiff makes a <em>prima facie</em> showing of\r\ndiscrimination, the burden of production shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate,\r\nnondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action.  <em>McDonnell Douglas</em>, 411 U.S. at 802. \r\nIf the employer meets this burden, the plaintiff bears the burden of persuasion to show that the\r\nemployer's proffered reasons are a mere pretext for discrimination.  <em>Id.</em>  The method of proof set\r\nforth in <em>McDonnell Douglas</em> ensures that the \"plaintiff has his day in court despite the unavailability\r\nof direct evidence.\"  <em>Mooney v. Aramco Services Co</em>., 54 F.3d 1207, 1216 (5th Cir. 1995) (quoting\r\n<em>Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston</em>, 469 U.S. 111, 121 (1985)).  The burden of persuasion\r\nremains with the plaintiff.<strong><em> </em></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe <em>prima facie</em> case method established in <em>McDonnell Douglas</em> was never intended\r\nto be rigid, mechanized, or ritualistic.  It is merely a sensible, orderly way to evaluate the evidence\r\nin light of common experience as it bears on the critical question of discrimination.  <em>United States\r\nPostal  Serv. Bd. of Governors v. Aikens</em>, 460 U.S. 711, 715 (1982) (citing <em>Furnco Constr. Corp. v.\r\nWaters</em>, 438 U.S. 567, 577 (1978)).  Establishing a <em>prima facie</em> case creates a rebuttable presumption\r\nthat the employer unlawfully discriminated against the employee. In rebuttal, the employer must\r\nproduce admissible evidence of a legitimate reason for the employment decision.  When the\r\ndefendant fails to persuade the trial court to dismiss the action or render judgment for lack of a <em>prima\r\nfacie</em> case, and responds with proof of the employer's reasons for the decision, the presumption has\r\nbeen rebutted and drops from the case.  At that point, whether the plaintiff made a <em>prima facie</em> case\r\nof discrimination is no longer relevant.  <em>Id</em>.; <em>see also Walther v. Lone Star Gas Co.</em>, 952 F.2d 119,\r\n122 (5th Cir. 1992).  When the defendant has done everything that would be required had the\r\nplaintiff properly made out a <em>prima facie</em> case, whether the plaintiff actually did so is no longer\r\nrelevant.  <em>Aikens</em>, 460 U.S. at 715.  The trier of fact should proceed directly to the ultimate issue of\r\nwhether the defendant intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff; an affirmative finding will\r\nbe reviewed on appeal on the basis of whether the plaintiff produced sufficient evidence for the jury\r\nto find discrimination had occurred.  The question of whether a plaintiff made out a <em>prima facie</em> case\r\nof discrimination has no place in the jury room.  <em>See Walther</em>, 952 F.2d at 126-27.</span><span></span><span><strong><em></em></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIf, on the other hand, a plaintiff produces direct evidence of discrimination, the\r\n<em>McDonnell Douglas</em> framework of proof does not apply.  <em>See Thurston</em>, 469 U.S. at 119.  When an\r\nemployee presents direct evidence of discrimination against the employee, but the employer asserts\r\nthat the same adverse employment decision would have been made regardless of discrimination, the\r\n<em>Price Waterhouse</em> mixed-motive theory applies. <em> Mooney</em>, 54 F.3d at 1216; <em>see also Price\r\nWaterhouse</em>, 490 U.S. at 244-45 (\"[O]nce a plaintiff in a Title VII case shows that gender played a\r\nmotivating part in an employment decision, the defendant may avoid a finding of liability only by\r\nproving that it would have made the same decision even if it had not allowed gender to play such a\r\nrole.\").  Unlike <em>McDonnell Douglas</em>, which simply involves a shifting of the burden of production,\r\n<em>Price Waterhouse</em> involves shifting the burden of persuasion to the defendant.  <em>Mooney</em>, 54 F.3d at\r\n1216-17.  In other words, under <em>Price Waterhouse</em>, once a plaintiff presents direct evidence of\r\ndiscrimination, the burden of proof shifts to the employer to show the same employment decision\r\nwould have been made regardless of the discriminatory animus.<sup> (2)</sup>  <em>Id.</em> at 1217; <em>see also</em> Michael J.\r\nZimmer, <em>Chaos or Coherence: Individual Disparate Treatment Discrimination and the ADEA</em>, 51\r\nMercer L. Rev. 693, 695 (2000).  If the employer fails to carry this burden, the plaintiff prevails.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tPrior case law and the <em>Price Waterhouse</em> opinion make clear that the mixed-motives\r\nand pretext methods require different elements of proof.  The fundamental prerequisite to the mixed-motives instruction is the presentation of direct evidence of discrimination.  <em>Mooney</em>, 54 F.3d at\r\n1217.  In <em>Price Waterhouse</em>, the plaintiff's candidacy for partnership was put on hold, and she\r\nbrought a Title VII sex-discrimination action.  <em>Price Waterhouse</em>, 490 U.S. at 233.  The plaintiff\r\nproduced evidence in the form of various partners' statements that she was \"macho,\"\r\n\"overcompensated for being a woman,\" and should \"take a course at charm school\" and \"walk more\r\nfemininely, talk more femininely, dress more femininely, wear make-up, have her hair styled, and\r\nwear jewelry.\"  <em>Id.</em> at 235.  Without expressly defining \"direct evidence,\"<sup> (3)</sup></span><span> a majority of the Court\r\nheld that this evidence was sufficient to shift the burden of persuasion to Price Waterhouse to prove\r\nthat it would have made the same employment decision regardless of the plaintiff's gender.  <em>See id.</em>\r\nat 244-45; <em>id.</em> at 261 (White, J., concurring); <em>id.</em> at 279 (O'Connor, J., concurring).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has expressly defined \"direct\r\nevidence\" as \"evidence which, if believed, proves the fact [of discriminatory animus] without\r\ninference or presumption.\"  <em>See Mooney</em>, 54 F.3d at 1217 (citing <em>Brown v. East Miss. Elec. Power\r\nAss'n</em>, 989 F.2d 858 (5th Cir. 1993)).  In <em>Mooney</em>, employees brought a class action against their\r\nemployer alleging unlawful termination in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. \r\n<em>Id. </em>at 1211.  The plaintiffs produced evidence of allegedly discriminatory statements made by their\r\nsupervisors:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Thim's supervisor said he wanted to replace Thim with a \"younger and cheaper\"\r\nengineer.  Olson's supervisor said it \"must have been your age.\"  Williams's\r\nsupervisor declared that plaintiff would have a \"good case of age discrimination.\" \r\nMooney heard Dan Christy--the man who recommended his discharge--tell a\r\nyounger engineer that Aramco was \"going to get rid of the older employees with the\r\nhigher salaries.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><em>Id. </em>at 1218.  The Fifth Circuit ultimately concluded that these statements failed to constitute <em>Price\r\nWaterhouse</em> direct evidence because the plaintiffs had failed to show that \"the employer <em>actually\r\nrelied on</em> [the forbidden factor] in making its decision.\"  <em>Id.</em> (quoting <em>Langley v. Jackson State Univ.</em>,\r\n14 F.3d 1070, 1075 (5th Cir. 1994)).  The court reasoned that two of the statements were \"primarily\r\nindicative of a desire to save money by employing persons at lower pay,\" while the other two\r\nstatements \"merely constitute[d] speculation as to possible discrimination in the termination of Trial\r\nPlaintiffs.\"  <em>Id.</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tObviously, not all comments reflecting a discriminatory attitude constitute direct\r\nevidence.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit has distinguished</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>comments which demonstrate a \"discriminatory animus in the decisional process\" or\r\nthose uttered by individuals closely involved in employment decisions, from \"stray\r\nremarks in the workplace,\" \"statements by nondecisionmakers,\" or \"statements by\r\ndecisionmakers unrelated to the decisional process.\"  While evidence of the former\r\ntype of remark might be sufficient to entitle a plaintiff to a <em>Price Waterhouse</em>\r\ninstruction, we reject the latter as insufficient.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><em>Radabaugh v. Zip Feed Mills, Inc.</em>, 997 F.2d 444, 448-49 (8th Cir. 1993); <em>see also</em> <em>Jaso</em>, 6 S.W.3d\r\nat 330-31 (\"Mere stray marks, without more, are insufficient to establish a claim of age\r\ndiscrimination.\"); Jeff Morneau, <em>Too Good, Too Bad: \"Overqualified\" Older Workers</em>, 22 W. New\r\nEng. L. Rev. 45, 54-57 (2000).  \"The clearest example of 'direct evidence' of discrimination would\r\nbe 'evidence that can be interpreted as an acknowledgment of discriminatory intent by the defendant\r\nor its agents.'\"  <em>Glover-Dorsey v. University of Tex. Med. Branch</em>, 147 F. Supp. 2d 656, 662 (S.D.\r\nTex. 2001) (quoting <em>Troup v. May Dept. Stores Co.</em>, 20 F.3d 734, 736 (7th Cir. 1994)).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThere are, as might be expected, few reported cases of direct evidence discrimination,\r\nand fewer yet involving a seniority system.  Appellees direct us to the <em>TWA </em>case, which involved a\r\nfacially discriminatory system, unlike the one at issue here.  <em>See Trans World Airlines, Inc. v.\r\nThurston</em>, 469 U.S. 111 (1985).  They rely particularly on <em>Lorance</em>, involving the limitations period\r\nfor a facially neutral but allegedly intentionally discriminatory seniority system which, upon\r\nadoption, immediately had a negative disparate impact on the female employees because it\r\nunfavorably altered their contractual seniority rights.   <em>See Lorance v. AT&amp;T Technologies, Inc.</em>, 490\r\nU.S. 900 (1989).  Policy 712 did not immediately affect appellees' seniority rights in that manner,\r\nand appellees did not proceed on a disparate impact theory.  Our research reveals no case exactly on\r\npoint.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><strong><em>Direct or Indirect Evidence?</em></strong></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tTo classify the cause before us, we must first decide whether appellees introduced\r\ndirect evidence of age discrimination.  Appellees point to statements by Assistant Police Chiefs Ray\r\nSanders and Reuben Lopez as direct evidence of discriminatory animus.  In response to inquiries\r\nabout why time limits on specialized assignments were necessary, Sanders answered, \"We need to\r\nmove some of these older officers out and give these younger guys a chance at these jobs\"; \"We want\r\nto get you old guys out of there and get some young guys in\"; and \"We're trying to get rid of you old\r\nguys.\"  Lopez commented that the time limits were necessary in order \"to have some new blood\" in\r\nspecialized assignments.  Because these statements by one closely involved in decision making go\r\ndirectly to the adoption of the policy, they are proof of discriminatory animus without inference or\r\npresumption.  <em>See Mooney</em>, 54 F.3d at 1217.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant argues, as it did at trial, that any comments about \"young\" or \"old\" officers\r\nrefer to the time or experience an officer has in a position, not to an officer's chronological age. \r\nEven assuming such references sometimes carry that connotation, the statements themselves do not\r\nreveal such an alternative meaning, and the jury found otherwise.  Unlike the statements in the\r\n<em>Mooney</em> case, which indicate that the declarant is primarily concerned with saving money, these\r\nstatements indicate that \"older\" officers are being moved in order to be replaced by \"younger\"\r\nofficers.  Age is the <em>only</em> factor articulated in response to the officers' inquiries about the reason for\r\ntime limits on specialized assignments; therefore, the statements suggest that \"the employer <em>actually\r\nrelied on</em> [the officers' age] in making its decision.\"  <em>See id.</em> at 1218.  Furthermore, Sanders's and\r\nLopez's statements are not speculative; they identify the reason for the time limits with certainty. \r\n<em>See id.</em> at 1218-19.  In addition, these statements were made by Assistant Police Chiefs, or\r\n\"individuals closely involved in employment decisions\" for the APD, and are therefore \"sufficient\r\nto entitle a plaintiff to a <em>Price Waterhouse</em> instruction.\"  <em>See Zip Feed Mills</em>, 997 F.2d at 448-49. \r\nFinally, these statements clearly \"can be interpreted as an acknowledgment of discriminatory intent\r\nby the defendant or its agents.\" <em> See Glover-Dorsey</em>, 147 F. Supp. 2d at 662.  We conclude that\r\nSanders's and Lopez's statements reflect direct evidence<sup> (4)</sup> that APD actually relied on the officers'\r\nage in making the decision to adopt Policy 712 and impose time limits on specialized assignments.<sup> (5)</sup> <strong><em></em></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><strong><em>Adverse Employment Action</em></strong></span><span><em></em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant contends that any evidence of discriminatory intent is merely indirect and\r\nthat, in any event, a jury finding of an adverse employment action is a required element of an\r\nemployment discrimination cause of action.  APD contends that without this finding, we must render\r\njudgment in its behalf or at least reverse for a new trial.  At the same time, APD admits that\r\nsometimes the adverse action is a \"given,\" in which case no finding is required despite its being a\r\nrequired element.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn response, appellees argue that, because they proved their case by direct evidence\r\nof discrimination, they were not required to present a <em>prima facie</em> case and thus were not required\r\nto prove they suffered an adverse employment action.  In effect, they contend that the adoption of\r\nthe policy alone constituted adequate proof of their injury, and thus they did not have an obligation\r\nto prove anything other than that an unlawful policy was adopted, without further proof of how it\r\nharmed them.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tEstablishing an unlawful employment practice is, of course, the entire point of the\r\nplaintiff's suit, regardless of whether it is a pretext or mixed-motive case.  <em>See Quantum</em>, 47 S.W.3d\r\nat 478.  The factual inquiry is whether the defendant intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff. \r\n<em>See Aikens</em>, 460 U.S. at 715; <em>see also</em> <em>Burdine</em>, 450 U.S. at 253.  Even so, the discrimination must\r\nbe directed against the complaining employee.  The crucial issue involves whether the employer used\r\nage as a determinative factor in making an employment decision involving a particular employee or\r\ngroup of employees.  <em>See Woodhouse v. Magnolia Hosp.</em>, 92 F.3d 248, 252-53 (5th Cir. 1996).  The\r\ncourt should instruct the jury to consider the ultimate question of whether the defendant made the\r\ndecision because of the plaintiff's age.  <em>Id</em>. at 257.  When a case has been fully tried on the merits,\r\nthe adequacy of the showing at any stage of the <em>McDonnell Douglas</em> framework is unimportant;\r\nrather, the reviewing court may proceed directly to the ultimate question to determine whether there\r\nwas sufficient evidence from which a reasonable trier of fact could have concluded that age\r\ndiscrimination occurred.  <em>See id</em>. at 252-53; <em>see also Walther</em>, 952 F.2d at 122-23.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDirect evidence of discriminatory intent, however, does not end the inquiry.  The\r\nTexas Supreme Court has stated that the Act \"requires an employment discrimination plaintiff to\r\nshow that discrimination was a motivating factor in an adverse employment decision,\" regardless\r\nof whether the case is classified as a mixed-motive or pretext case.  <em>Quantum</em>, 47 S.W.3d at 482. \r\nAnd the fact that appellees' complaint goes to adoption of a policy found to be a seniority system\r\ndoes not lessen their burden.   Section 21.051 of the labor code states circumstances in which an\r\nemployer has committed an unlawful employment practice; under the statute, the practice must be\r\ndirected against the employee.  Tex. Lab. Code Ann. § 21.051.  Section 21.125(a) explicitly\r\ndescribes what a complainant must show in order to prevail.  <em>Id</em>. § 21.125(a).  Section 21.127\r\nconfirms that a finding of intentional discrimination is required with respect to a seniority system\r\nand sets out the three events which trigger accrual of the cause of action relating to adoption of a\r\ndiscriminatory seniority system.  <em>Id</em>. § 21.127.  By whatever method the plaintiffs proceed, however,\r\nthey must establish that the employer made an employment decision adverse to the employees for\r\na prohibited reason.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAssuming the officers presented their case by means of direct evidence and proved\r\nthat the APD adopted a seniority system in order to discriminate, they must still prove that the policy\r\nadversely affected them, that is, that Policy 712 had a discriminatory effect on them.  The United\r\nStates Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has addressed similar issues in pretext cases, but the\r\nunderlying principles apply to a mixed-motive case, as well. Just as in any case, the court's task is\r\nto determine the injuries caused by discrimination that require judicial relief.  <em>Armstrong v. Turner\r\nIndus., Inc.</em>, 141 F.3d 554, 560 (5th Cir. 1998).  In other words, regardless of the discriminatory\r\npractice asserted, the employee must prove that the unlawful practice caused the employee injury.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn the majority of employment discrimination cases, the asserted injury is an obvious\r\nadverse employment action, such as a hiring or firing decision, resulting from discrimination based\r\nupon a prohibited trait, such as race or age.  <em>Id</em>.  Because this case does not involve an obvious\r\nultimate adverse decision, the injury, if any, is less clear; the characterization of Policy 712 as a\r\nseniority system further complicates what plaintiffs must prove.  Appellees argue that violation of\r\nthe statute alone--that is, the mere adoption of a policy with discriminatory intent--constitutes the\r\ncompensable injury.  Although the argument is appealing, we cannot agree.  Damages must be based\r\non something more than an abstract violation of a statute.  The policy is not discriminatory on its\r\nface, as in <em>TWA</em>, nor does it produce an immediate negative effect on the officers' contractual\r\nseniority rights, as in <em>Lorance</em>.  A plaintiff must suffer and prove some cognizable, compensable\r\ninjury in fact, of which the violation is a legal and proximate cause.  Thus, even though the policy\r\nmay have been adopted for an unlawful reason, appellees failed to prove how application of the\r\npolicy discriminated against them and caused them injury that would entitle them to compensation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn <em>Tyler</em>, the court found that plaintiff Price did not produce evidence of an adverse\r\nemployment action to support the jury's ruling in his favor.  <em>Tyler v. Union Oil Co.</em>, 304 F.3d 379,\r\n395-96 (5th Cir. 2002).  In response to the employer's complaint that Price failed to prove he\r\nsuffered an adverse employment action, Price argued that the <em>prima facie</em> method of proof was no\r\nlonger relevant once the case went to the jury.  <em>Id</em>. at 393-94.  In deciding the matter, the court stated\r\nthat cases supporting Price's proposition relate to elements proving discrimination, not injury.  <em>Id</em>.\r\n(citing <em>Aikens</em>, 460 U.S. at 713-14; <em>Russell v. McKinney Hosp. Venture</em>, 235 F.3d 219, 224 (5th Cir.\r\n2001)).  The court held that a plaintiff who proves discrimination must still prove injury in order to\r\nrecover damages.  <em>Id</em>.; <em>see also Armstrong</em>, 141 F.3d at 560 (to recover damages, plaintiff must prove\r\ncognizable injury).  The plaintiffs here recovered damages because the APD adopted a\r\ndiscriminatory policy.  To sustain the damage award, the plaintiffs were required to show that they\r\nsuffered a cognizable injury caused by the adoption of the seniority system. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe policy and the evidence reflect that Policy 712 required the officers to be\r\ntransferred from specialized assignments to patrol duty under specified terms.  Even on appeal,\r\nappellees do not point out any other negative effect on their terms, conditions, or privileges of\r\nemployment; nor do they show how the resulting classification deprived them of any employment\r\nopportunity.  In fact, several of the officers who prevailed were never actually transferred, although\r\nthey may remain subject to transfer.  It is undisputed that all officers have the same rank, pay\r\nclassification, job benefits, and promotional opportunities regardless of their assignment.  The\r\nofficers argue that adoption of the policy for an unlawful reason in itself was an adequate showing\r\nof injury and that they need not prove further adverse impact.  They point out that they presented\r\nevidence that the policy caused them unwanted transfers, unwelcome rotations, and resulted in\r\nlimitations on preferred assignments.  They described their personal suffering as a result of the\r\nadoption of the policy, arguing that damages were properly awarded them for inconvenience and loss\r\nof enjoyment of life.</span><span>  They did not seek to show that the policy had a disparate impact on them or\r\nresulted in their disparate treatment. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span> \tAlthough a lateral transfer may under certain circumstances give rise to an\r\nemployment discrimination action, as a general proposition an employer's policy of job assignment\r\nis not compensable.<sup> (6)</sup>  As appellant concedes, in some cases an apparently lateral transfer may in\r\nactuality result in an adverse employment situation amounting to, for example, a demotion.  <em>See\r\nSharp v. City of Houston</em>, 164 F.3d 923, 933 (5th Cir. 1999) (transfer of officer from elite unit to\r\nseverely worse unit held to be adverse under section 1983 claim).  Generally, lateral transfers and\r\nrotations promoting reasonable business purposes do not rise to a level of an adverse action without\r\na further showing of harm.  <em>See Serna v. City of San Antonio</em>, 244 F.3d 479, 482-83 (5th Cir. 2001)\r\n(in whistle-blower case, transfer without cut in pay or benefits may be adverse action but plaintiff\r\nmust show transfer caused plaintiff serious, objective, tangible harm).  Although we recognize that\r\nthese cases do not involve seniority systems, similar principles apply. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFor purposes of this appeal, we hold that the evidence proffered by the appellees\r\nconstituted direct evidence of intent to discriminate with respect to adoption of Policy 712. \r\nNevertheless, we hold that even in the face of direct evidence of an intent to discriminate, the\r\nofficers must prove that the employment decision in fact caused the officers to suffer a\r\ndiscriminatory adverse employment action.  This they failed to do.  Ordinarily, failure to submit a\r\nnecessary issue would require reversal.  In this instance, in light of these unique<span> </span>facts, and the\r\nabsence of controlling law, we believe the interest of justice requires a new trial. <span><em> </em></span></span><span><em>See </em>Tex. R. App.<span>\r\n</span>P. 43.3(b).  Appellant expressly invites this relief in the alternative.<sup> (7)</sup></span><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBecause no case has expressly required a finding of injury under similar facts, in the\r\ninterest of justice we reverse the cause and remand the matter for a new trial.  In light of our\r\ndisposition, we need not address appellant's remaining points of error. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><strong><em><center></center></em>CONCLUSION</strong></span><span>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellees proffered direct evidence of APD's discriminatory animus; nevertheless,\r\nthey were required to prove that Policy 712 discriminated against them and caused them to suffer\r\nan adverse employment action.  Because we hold that under these unique facts the inquiry should\r\nhave been made, we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand for new trial.<strong><em></em></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t\t__________________________________________</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t\tMarilyn Aboussie, Chief Justice</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Before Chief Justice Aboussie, Justices B.A. Smith and Patterson</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Reversed and Remanded</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Filed:   December 19, 2002</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Publish</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.        Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5221k, now codified in Chapter 21 of the Texas Labor Code.\r\n</p><p>2.        Under <em>Price Waterhouse</em>, the employer's successful showing relieved the employer of liability. \r\nBoth the federal and state statutes now provide that the employer's showing that the employment\r\ndecision would have been made in any event only limits the employee's remedies but not the\r\nemployer's liability.\r\n</p><p>3.        In her <em>Price Waterhouse</em> concurrence, Justice O'Connor concludes that in order to shift the\r\nburden of persuasion to the employer, \"the plaintiff must produce evidence sufficient to show that\r\nan illegitimate criterion was a substantial factor in the particular employment decision such that a\r\nreasonable factfinder could draw an inference that the decision was made 'because of' the plaintiff's\r\nprotected status.\"  <em>Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins</em>, 490 U.S. 228, 278 (1989) <span>(O'Connor, J.,\r\nconcurring).\r\n<p>4.        Even if Sanders's and Lopez's statements do not constitute direct evidence of discrimination,\r\nbecause the case was fully tried on the merits we do not believe that fact to be controlling.  </p></span><span>The\r\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit instructs that after an employment discrimination\r\ncase has been tried on the merits, the proper inquiry is whether the judgment is supported by\r\nsufficient evidence.  <em>See Patterson v. P.H.P. Healthcare Corp.</em>, 90 F.3d 927, 933 (5th Cir. 1996);\r\n<em>Haun v. Ideal Indus., Inc.</em>, 81 F.3d 541, 546 (5th Cir. 1996) (\"On appeal of a jury's verdict of age\r\ndiscrimination, we need not address the sufficiency of [the plaintiff's] prima facie case, but proceed\r\nto determine whether there was sufficient evidence upon which a jury could find that discrimination\r\noccurred.\").\r\n<p>5.        We note that appellees' ability to produce direct evidence of discriminatory animus did not\r\nresult in an automatic judgment in their favor; the existence of direct evidence only shifted the\r\nburdens of production and persuasion to APD to show that it would have made the same\r\nemployment decision regardless of appellees' age.  <em>See </em></p></span><span><em>Price Waterhouse</em>, 490 U.S. at 244-45.</span><span>  The\r\njury failed to find that APD would have done so.\r\n<p>6.        We note that when asked in Question No. 2 whether as to the two officers asserting a retaliation\r\nclaim a lateral transfer was an adverse employment action, the jury answered in the negative. \r\n</p><p>7.        Appellant argues in the alternative that, had the jury found the required element, the record\r\ncontains legally and factually insufficient evidence to support a finding in appellees' favor. \r\nReviewing the evidence under the proper standards of review, we hold that had the issue been asked\r\nthe record contains some evidence of injury and therefore we cannot say that the evidence is legally\r\ninsufficient to prove the fact.  Without repeating the evidence set out herein, however, we hold that\r\nthe evidence in the record is so weak as to make the judgment clearly wrong and therefore factually\r\ninsufficient to prove the policy caused the officers to experience adverse harm, requiring a remand.\r\n</p></span></p>\r\n</div>",

We will reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand for\r\na new trial.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><center><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAustin police officers typically serve as patrol officers or in specialized assignments. \r\nAlthough specialized assignments entail some of the same duties as patrol duty, they often have a\r\nspecific focus and include assignments to the warrants divisions, D.A.R.E. (Drug Abuse Resistance\r\nEducation) unit, canine unit, traffic unit, motorcycle unit, horse-mounted unit, narcotics unit, and\r\ncriminal intelligence unit.  Whether an officer serves as a patrol officer or in a specialized\r\nassignment, he or she has identical rank, pay classifications, job benefits, and promotional\r\nopportunities.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn 1979, APD adopted the first of several policies governing how an officer could\r\napply for a specialized assignment, the criteria for serving in a specialized assignment, how long an\r\nofficer could hold such an assignment before being required to rotate back to patrol duty, and how\r\nlong an officer had to serve on patrol duty before becoming eligible to apply for another specialized\r\nassignment.  The initial APD policy allowed an officer to serve for three years in a specialized\r\nassignment but required officers to return to patrol duty for twelve months before becoming eligible\r\nfor another specialized assignment.  Later that year, APD amended the policy by granting the APD\r\ndivision commander discretion to retain senior officers in a specialized assignment beyond the three\r\nyear period based on job performance. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn 1990, APD again amended its specialized assignment policy, allowing an officer\r\nto apply for an extension of a specialized assignment when a transfer would not be in the best interest\r\nof the department.  The 1990 amendments also implemented an annual review of officer\r\nperformance, after which a reviewing commander had discretion to reassign an officer in a\r\nspecialized assignment to patrol or retain the officer in the special assignment.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBy the mid-1990s, extensions of police officers' specialized assignments were\r\nfrequent; consequently, officers were holding their respective assignments longer, resulting in fewer\r\nopportunities for other officers to rotate into specialized assignments.  In 1993, Assistant Chief Ray\r\nSanders requested a committee be formed to modify APD's specialized assignment policy.  Sanders\r\nappointed Commander Cecil Huff as chairman of the committee and indicated that he wanted the\r\ncommittee to ensure that the selection process for specialized assignments was fair and to review the\r\nappeals process for officers who were not selected.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe committee produced a draft of a new policy but could not reach a consensus on\r\nhow long an officer could stay in a specialized assignment before being required to transfer. </span>\r\nDissatisfied with the draft because it contained no such time limits, Sanders met with the committee\r\nto discuss the policy; still, it reached no consensus on time limits.  Finally, Huff formed a second\r\ncommittee comprised of different members.  The second committee produced another draft<span>.  APD\r\nexecutive staff considered the second committee's recommendations and created General Order 712\r\n(\"Policy 712\").  Policy 712 imposed a five year cap on specialized assignments, removed any\r\ndiscretion which might extend an officer's assignment beyond five years, and established a rotation\r\npolicy requiring officers who had served in a specialized assignment to return to patrol duty for at\r\nleast three years before serving in another specialized assignment.  The policy provided that the most\r\ntenured personnel would be rotated first.  Policy 712 took effect in February 1994.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAfter APD adopted Policy 712, twenty-two plaintiffs brought suit claiming age\r\ndiscrimination.  Eight plaintiffs were non suited, and an additional plaintiff was dismissed by\r\nagreement.  When the trial commenced, the thirteen remaining plaintiffs proceeded on their claim\r\nof direct and intentional age discrimination resulting from APD's adoption of Policy 712.  They\r\nfurther asserted at trial that the assignment and transfer policy in effect constituted a seniority system. \r\nTwo of the thirteen plaintiffs also asserted retaliation claims.  The plaintiffs alleged that the transfer\r\npolicy had a disparate impact on them but did not pursue that claim at trial.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA jury found for all thirteen plaintiffs on the theory of age discrimination and against\r\nthe two plaintiffs who alleged retaliation.  At the conclusion of the jury trial, the trial court held a\r\nhearing, received evidence, and awarded attorney's fees to the prevailing parties.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAPD appeals the trial court's judgment, contending that appellees failed to prove an\r\nessential element of their claim entitling them to judgment, arguing that there is legally or factually\r\ninsufficient evidence to support the jury's finding that the adoption of Policy 712 constituted\r\nintentional age discrimination, and asserting that the award of damages and attorney's fees was\r\nimproper.</span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><center><strong>DISCUSSION</strong></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn its first issue, APD argues that the district court erred by rendering judgment for\r\nappellees because they failed to obtain a jury finding that they suffered any \"adverse employment\r\naction\" at the hands of APD, focusing on appellees' complaints of unwanted transfers under Policy\r\n712.  APD objected to the omission of this element at trial, preserving the issue for appeal, and\r\nrequests that we reverse and render judgment on behalf of APD.  APD relies upon the <em>McDonnell\r\nDouglas</em> method of proof in support of its position.  <em>See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">792</span></a></span> (1973).  In the alternative, APD requests that we remand the cause for a new trial on the\r\nbasis that, even if found, evidence that the policy required transfer and lateral rotation is legally and\r\nfactually insufficient to prove that the officers suffered any adverse employment action through\r\napplication of the policy.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><strong><em>Standards of Review</em></strong></span><span><em></em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe review a district court's submission of controlling issues <em>de novo</em>. <em> Continental\r\nCas.

Courts recognize two types of employment\r\ndiscrimination cases.  <em>Quantum</em>, 47 S.W.3d at 476.  The first is the \"pretext\" case, demonstrated by\r\nindirect or inferential proof, in which the plaintiff's ultimate goal is to show that the employer's\r\nstated reason for its adverse action against the employee was a pretext for discrimination. <em> Id</em>.; <em>Texas\r\nDep't of Community Affairs v.

The second type of case is the \"mixed-motive\" case, in which the plaintiff can show by\r\ndirect evidence the employer's discriminatory animus in making the employment decision with\r\nrespect to the employee. <em> Quantum</em>, 47 S.W.3d at 476.  Once shown, the employer must then prove\r\nthat it would have made the same decision for legitimate reasons even without the discriminatory\r\nmotive.  <em>Price Waterhouse v.

How a case is classified\r\ndepends upon whether there is direct evidence of an illegitimate criterion.  <em>Quantum, </em>47 S.W.3d at\r\n476.  In either event, the case arises from an employment decision or practice adversely affecting the\r\nemployee. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDiscrimination can be shown indirectly through circumstantial evidence by following\r\nthe \"pretext\" method of proof.  <em>See McDonnell Douglas</em>,<em> </em>411 U.S. at 802-05.  In <em>McDonnell\r\nDouglas,</em> the United States Supreme Court set out the order and allocation of proof to be followed\r\nin a pretext case.  <em>Quantum,</em> 47 S.W.3d at 477.  The burden shifting framework requires a plaintiff\r\nto establish a <em>prima facie</em> case of discrimination by showing that he or she was: (1) within the\r\nprotected age group; (2) adversely affected or suffered an adverse employment action; and (3)\r\nsimilarly situated non-protected class members were not treated similarly.  <em>McDonnell Douglas</em>, 411\r\nU.S. at 801-03; <em>see also Jaso</em>, 6 S.W.3d at 328.  Once the plaintiff makes a <em>prima facie</em> showing of\r\ndiscrimination, the burden of production shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate,\r\nnondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action.  <em>McDonnell Douglas</em>, 411 U.S. at 802. \r\nIf the employer meets this burden, the plaintiff bears the burden of persuasion to show that the\r\nemployer's proffered reasons are a mere pretext for discrimination.  <em>Id.</em>  The method of proof set\r\nforth in <em>McDonnell Douglas</em> ensures that the \"plaintiff has his day in court despite the unavailability\r\nof direct evidence.\"  <em>Mooney v.

Establishing a <em>prima facie</em> case creates a rebuttable presumption\r\nthat the employer unlawfully discriminated against the employee. In rebuttal, the employer must\r\nproduce admissible evidence of a legitimate reason for the employment decision.  When the\r\ndefendant fails to persuade the trial court to dismiss the action or render judgment for lack of a <em>prima\r\nfacie</em> case, and responds with proof of the employer's reasons for the decision, the presumption has\r\nbeen rebutted and drops from the case.  At that point, whether the plaintiff made a <em>prima facie</em> case\r\nof discrimination is no longer relevant.  <em>Id</em>.; <em>see also Walther v. Lone Star Gas Co.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"574349\"><a href=\"/opinion/574349/59-fair-emplpraccas-bna-848-58-empl-prac-dec-p-41258-melvin/\"><span class=\"volume\">952</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">119</span></a></span>,\r\n122 (5th Cir. 1992).  When the defendant has done everything that would be required had the\r\nplaintiff properly made out a <em>prima facie</em> case, whether the plaintiff actually did so is no longer\r\nrelevant.  <em>Aikens</em>, 460 U.S. at 715.  The trier of fact should proceed directly to the ultimate issue of\r\nwhether the defendant intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff; an affirmative finding will\r\nbe reviewed on appeal on the basis of whether the plaintiff produced sufficient evidence for the jury\r\nto find discrimination had occurred.  The question of whether a plaintiff made out a <em>prima facie</em> case\r\nof discrimination has no place in the jury room.  <em>See Walther</em>, 952 F.2d at 126-27.</span><span></span><span><strong><em></em></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIf, on the other hand, a plaintiff produces direct evidence of discrimination, the\r\n<em>McDonnell Douglas</em> framework of proof does not apply.  <em>See Thurston</em>, 469 U.S. at 119.  When an\r\nemployee presents direct evidence of discrimination against the employee, but the employer asserts\r\nthat the same adverse employment decision would have been made regardless of discrimination, the\r\n<em>Price Waterhouse</em> mixed-motive theory applies. <em> Mooney</em>, 54 F.3d at 1216; <em>see also Price\r\nWaterhouse</em>, 490 U.S. at 244-45 (\"[O]nce a plaintiff in a Title VII case shows that gender played a\r\nmotivating part in an employment decision, the defendant may avoid a finding of liability only by\r\nproving that it would have made the same decision even if it had not allowed gender to play such a\r\nrole.\").  Unlike <em>McDonnell Douglas</em>, which simply involves a shifting of the burden of production,\r\n<em>Price Waterhouse</em> involves shifting the burden of persuasion to the defendant.  <em>Mooney</em>, 54 F.3d at\r\n1216-17.  In other words, under <em>Price Waterhouse</em>, once a plaintiff presents direct evidence of\r\ndiscrimination, the burden of proof shifts to the employer to show the same employment decision\r\nwould have been made regardless of the discriminatory animus.<sup> (2)</sup>  <em>Id.</em> at 1217; <em>see also</em> Michael J.\r\nZimmer, <em>Chaos or Coherence: Individual Disparate Treatment Discrimination and the ADEA</em>, 51\r\nMercer L. Rev. 693, 695 (2000).  If the employer fails to carry this burden, the plaintiff prevails.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tPrior case law and the <em>Price Waterhouse</em> opinion make clear that the mixed-motives\r\nand pretext methods require different elements of proof.  The fundamental prerequisite to the mixed-motives instruction is the presentation of direct evidence of discrimination.  <em>Mooney</em>, 54 F.3d at\r\n1217.  In <em>Price Waterhouse</em>, the plaintiff's candidacy for partnership was put on hold, and she\r\nbrought a Title VII sex-discrimination action.  <em>Price Waterhouse</em>, 490 U.S. at 233.  The plaintiff\r\nproduced evidence in the form of various partners' statements that she was \"macho,\"\r\n\"overcompensated for being a woman,\" and should \"take a course at charm school\" and \"walk more\r\nfemininely, talk more femininely, dress more femininely, wear make-up, have her hair styled, and\r\nwear jewelry.\"  <em>Id.</em> at 235.  Without expressly defining \"direct evidence,\"<sup> (3)</sup></span><span> a majority of the Court\r\nheld that this evidence was sufficient to shift the burden of persuasion to Price Waterhouse to prove\r\nthat it would have made the same employment decision regardless of the plaintiff's gender.  <em>See id.</em>\r\nat 244-45; <em>id.</em> at 261 (White, J., concurring); <em>id.</em> at 279 (O'Connor, J., concurring).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has expressly defined \"direct\r\nevidence\" as \"evidence which, if believed, proves the fact [of discriminatory animus] without\r\ninference or presumption.\"  <em>See Mooney</em>, 54 F.3d at 1217 (citing <em>Brown v.

In <em>Mooney</em>, employees brought a class action against their\r\nemployer alleging unlawful termination in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. \r\n<em>Id. </em>at 1211.  The plaintiffs produced evidence of allegedly discriminatory statements made by their\r\nsupervisors:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Thim's supervisor said he wanted to replace Thim with a \"younger and cheaper\"\r\nengineer.  Olson's supervisor said it \"must have been your age.\"  Williams's\r\nsupervisor declared that plaintiff would have a \"good case of age discrimination.\" \r\nMooney heard Dan Christy--the man who recommended his discharge--tell a\r\nyounger engineer that Aramco was \"going to get rid of the older employees with the\r\nhigher salaries.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><em>Id. </em>at 1218.  The Fifth Circuit ultimately concluded that these statements failed to constitute <em>Price\r\nWaterhouse</em> direct evidence because the plaintiffs had failed to show that \"the employer <em>actually\r\nrelied on</em> [the forbidden factor] in making its decision.\"  <em>Id.</em> (quoting <em>Langley v. Jackson State Univ.</em>,\r\n<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"661487\"><a href=\"/opinion/661487/dr-bettye-r-langley-v-jackson-state-university-and-dr-herman-smith-in/\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1070</span></a></span>, 1075 (5th Cir. 1994)).  The court reasoned that two of the statements were \"primarily\r\nindicative of a desire to save money by employing persons at lower pay,\" while the other two\r\nstatements \"merely constitute[d] speculation as to possible discrimination in the termination of Trial\r\nPlaintiffs.\"  <em>Id.</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tObviously, not all comments reflecting a discriminatory attitude constitute direct\r\nevidence.

Appellees direct us to the <em>TWA </em>case, which involved a\r\nfacially discriminatory system, unlike the one at issue here.  <em>See Trans World Airlines, Inc. v.\r\nThurston</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111290\"><a href=\"/opinion/111290/trans-world-airlines-inc-v-thurston/\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">111</span></a></span> (1985).  They rely particularly on <em>Lorance</em>, involving the limitations period\r\nfor a facially neutral but allegedly intentionally discriminatory seniority system which, upon\r\nadoption, immediately had a negative disparate impact on the female employees because it\r\nunfavorably altered their contractual seniority rights.   <em>See Lorance v. AT&amp;T Technologies, Inc.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112282\"><a href=\"/opinion/112282/lorance-v-att-technologies-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">900</span></a></span> (1989).  Policy 712 did not immediately affect appellees' seniority rights in that manner,\r\nand appellees did not proceed on a disparate impact theory.  Our research reveals no case exactly on\r\npoint.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><strong><em>Direct or Indirect Evidence?</em></strong></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tTo classify the cause before us, we must first decide whether appellees introduced\r\ndirect evidence of age discrimination.  Appellees point to statements by Assistant Police Chiefs Ray\r\nSanders and Reuben Lopez as direct evidence of discriminatory animus.  In response to inquiries\r\nabout why time limits on specialized assignments were necessary, Sanders answered, \"We need to\r\nmove some of these older officers out and give these younger guys a chance at these jobs\"; \"We want\r\nto get you old guys out of there and get some young guys in\"; and \"We're trying to get rid of you old\r\nguys.\"  Lopez commented that the time limits were necessary in order \"to have some new blood\" in\r\nspecialized assignments.  Because these statements by one closely involved in decision making go\r\ndirectly to the adoption of the policy, they are proof of discriminatory animus without inference or\r\npresumption.  <em>See Mooney</em>, 54 F.3d at 1217.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant argues, as it did at trial, that any comments about \"young\" or \"old\" officers\r\nrefer to the time or experience an officer has in a position, not to an officer's chronological age. \r\nEven assuming such references sometimes carry that connotation, the statements themselves do not\r\nreveal such an alternative meaning, and the jury found otherwise.  Unlike the statements in the\r\n<em>Mooney</em> case, which indicate that the declarant is primarily concerned with saving money, these\r\nstatements indicate that \"older\" officers are being moved in order to be replaced by \"younger\"\r\nofficers.  Age is the <em>only</em> factor articulated in response to the officers' inquiries about the reason for\r\ntime limits on specialized assignments; therefore, the statements suggest that \"the employer <em>actually\r\nrelied on</em> [the officers' age] in making its decision.\"  <em>See id.</em> at 1218.  Furthermore, Sanders's and\r\nLopez's statements are not speculative; they identify the reason for the time limits with certainty. \r\n<em>See id.</em> at 1218-19.  In addition, these statements were made by Assistant Police Chiefs, or\r\n\"individuals closely involved in employment decisions\" for the APD, and are therefore \"sufficient\r\nto entitle a plaintiff to a <em>Price Waterhouse</em> instruction.\"  <em>See Zip Feed Mills</em>, 997 F.2d at 448-49. \r\nFinally, these statements clearly \"can be interpreted as an acknowledgment of discriminatory intent\r\nby the defendant or its agents.\" <em> See Glover-Dorsey</em>, 147 F. Supp. 2d at 662.  We conclude that\r\nSanders's and Lopez's statements reflect direct evidence<sup> (4)</sup> that APD actually relied on the officers'\r\nage in making the decision to adopt Policy 712 and impose time limits on specialized assignments.<sup> (5)</sup> <strong><em></em></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><strong><em>Adverse Employment Action</em></strong></span><span><em></em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant contends that any evidence of discriminatory intent is merely indirect and\r\nthat, in any event, a jury finding of an adverse employment action is a required element of an\r\nemployment discrimination cause of action.  APD contends that without this finding, we must render\r\njudgment in its behalf or at least reverse for a new trial.  At the same time, APD admits that\r\nsometimes the adverse action is a \"given,\" in which case no finding is required despite its being a\r\nrequired element.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn response, appellees argue that, because they proved their case by direct evidence\r\nof discrimination, they were not required to present a <em>prima facie</em> case and thus were not required\r\nto prove they suffered an adverse employment action.  In effect, they contend that the adoption of\r\nthe policy alone constituted adequate proof of their injury, and thus they did not have an obligation\r\nto prove anything other than that an unlawful policy was adopted, without further proof of how it\r\nharmed them.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tEstablishing an unlawful employment practice is, of course, the entire point of the\r\nplaintiff's suit, regardless of whether it is a pretext or mixed-motive case.  <em>See Quantum</em>, 47 S.W.3d\r\nat 478.  The factual inquiry is whether the defendant intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff. \r\n<em>See Aikens</em>, 460 U.S. at 715; <em>see also</em> <em>Burdine</em>, 450 U.S. at 253.  Even so, the discrimination must\r\nbe directed against the complaining employee.  The crucial issue involves whether the employer used\r\nage as a determinative factor in making an employment decision involving a particular employee or\r\ngroup of employees.  <em>See Woodhouse v. Magnolia Hosp.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"723943\"><a href=\"/opinion/723943/71-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1804-68-empl-prac-dec-p-44266-peggy/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">248</span></a></span>, 252-53 (5th Cir. 1996).  The\r\ncourt should instruct the jury to consider the ultimate question of whether the defendant made the\r\ndecision because of the plaintiff's age.  <em>Id</em>. at 257.  When a case has been fully tried on the merits,\r\nthe adequacy of the showing at any stage of the <em>McDonnell Douglas</em> framework is unimportant;\r\nrather, the reviewing court may proceed directly to the ultimate question to determine whether there\r\nwas sufficient evidence from which a reasonable trier of fact could have concluded that age\r\ndiscrimination occurred.  <em>See id</em>. at 252-53; <em>see also Walther</em>, 952 F.2d at 122-23.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDirect evidence of discriminatory intent, however, does not end the inquiry.  The\r\nTexas Supreme Court has stated that the Act \"requires an employment discrimination plaintiff to\r\nshow that discrimination was a motivating factor in an adverse employment decision,\" regardless\r\nof whether the case is classified as a mixed-motive or pretext case.  <em>Quantum</em>, 47 S.W.3d at 482. \r\nAnd the fact that appellees' complaint goes to adoption of a policy found to be a seniority system\r\ndoes not lessen their burden.   Section 21.051 of the labor code states circumstances in which an\r\nemployer has committed an unlawful employment practice; under the statute, the practice must be\r\ndirected against the employee.  Tex. Lab. Code Ann. § 21.051.  Section 21.125(a) explicitly\r\ndescribes what a complainant must show in order to prevail.  <em>Id</em>. § 21.125(a).  Section 21.127\r\nconfirms that a finding of intentional discrimination is required with respect to a seniority system\r\nand sets out the three events which trigger accrual of the cause of action relating to adoption of a\r\ndiscriminatory seniority system.  <em>Id</em>. § 21.127.  By whatever method the plaintiffs proceed, however,\r\nthey must establish that the employer made an employment decision adverse to the employees for\r\na prohibited reason.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAssuming the officers presented their case by means of direct evidence and proved\r\nthat the APD adopted a seniority system in order to discriminate, they must still prove that the policy\r\nadversely affected them, that is, that Policy 712 had a discriminatory effect on them.  The United\r\nStates Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has addressed similar issues in pretext cases, but the\r\nunderlying principles apply to a mixed-motive case, as well. Just as in any case, the court's task is\r\nto determine the injuries caused by discrimination that require judicial relief.  <em>Armstrong v. Turner\r\nIndus., Inc.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"753006\"><a href=\"/opinion/753006/jeff-armstrong-v-turner-industries-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">141</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">554</span></a></span>, 560 (5th Cir. 1998).  In other words, regardless of the discriminatory\r\npractice asserted, the employee must prove that the unlawful practice caused the employee injury.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn the majority of employment discrimination cases, the asserted injury is an obvious\r\nadverse employment action, such as a hiring or firing decision, resulting from discrimination based\r\nupon a prohibited trait, such as race or age.  <em>Id</em>.  Because this case does not involve an obvious\r\nultimate adverse decision, the injury, if any, is less clear; the characterization of Policy 712 as a\r\nseniority system further complicates what plaintiffs must prove.  Appellees argue that violation of\r\nthe statute alone--that is, the mere adoption of a policy with discriminatory intent--constitutes the\r\ncompensable injury.  Although the argument is appealing, we cannot agree.  Damages must be based\r\non something more than an abstract violation of a statute.  The policy is not discriminatory on its\r\nface, as in <em>TWA</em>, nor does it produce an immediate negative effect on the officers' contractual\r\nseniority rights, as in <em>Lorance</em>.  A plaintiff must suffer and prove some cognizable, compensable\r\ninjury in fact, of which the violation is a legal and proximate cause.  Thus, even though the policy\r\nmay have been adopted for an unlawful reason, appellees failed to prove how application of the\r\npolicy discriminated against them and caused them injury that would entitle them to compensation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn <em>Tyler</em>, the court found that plaintiff Price did not produce evidence of an adverse\r\nemployment action to support the jury's ruling in his favor.  <em>Tyler v. Union Oil Co.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"779197\"><a href=\"/opinion/779197/donald-ray-tyler-donald-r-powers-m-leon-earles-thomas-l-hough-david/\"><span class=\"volume\">304</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">379</span></a></span>,\r\n395-96 (5th Cir. 2002).  In response to the employer's complaint that Price failed to prove he\r\nsuffered an adverse employment action, Price argued that the <em>prima facie</em> method of proof was no\r\nlonger relevant once the case went to the jury.  <em>Id</em>. at 393-94.  In deciding the matter, the court stated\r\nthat cases supporting Price's proposition relate to elements proving discrimination, not injury.  <em>Id</em>.\r\n(citing <em>Aikens</em>, 460 U.S. at 713-14; <em>Russell v. McKinney Hosp. Venture</em>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">235</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">219</span></span>, 224 (5th Cir.\r\n2001)).  The court held that a plaintiff who proves discrimination must still prove injury in order to\r\nrecover damages.  <em>Id</em>.; <em>see also Armstrong</em>, 141 F.3d at 560 (to recover damages, plaintiff must prove\r\ncognizable injury).  The plaintiffs here recovered damages because the APD adopted a\r\ndiscriminatory policy.  To sustain the damage award, the plaintiffs were required to show that they\r\nsuffered a cognizable injury caused by the adoption of the seniority system. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe policy and the evidence reflect that Policy 712 required the officers to be\r\ntransferred from specialized assignments to patrol duty under specified terms.  Even on appeal,\r\nappellees do not point out any other negative effect on their terms, conditions, or privileges of\r\nemployment; nor do they show how the resulting classification deprived them of any employment\r\nopportunity.  In fact, several of the officers who prevailed were never actually transferred, although\r\nthey may remain subject to transfer.  It is undisputed that all officers have the same rank, pay\r\nclassification, job benefits, and promotional opportunities regardless of their assignment.  The\r\nofficers argue that adoption of the policy for an unlawful reason in itself was an adequate showing\r\nof injury and that they need not prove further adverse impact.  They point out that they presented\r\nevidence that the policy caused them unwanted transfers, unwelcome rotations, and resulted in\r\nlimitations on preferred assignments.  They described their personal suffering as a result of the\r\nadoption of the policy, arguing that damages were properly awarded them for inconvenience and loss\r\nof enjoyment of life.</span><span>  They did not seek to show that the policy had a disparate impact on them or\r\nresulted in their disparate treatment. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span> \tAlthough a lateral transfer may under certain circumstances give rise to an\r\nemployment discrimination action, as a general proposition an employer's policy of job assignment\r\nis not compensable.<sup> (6)</sup>  As appellant concedes, in some cases an apparently lateral transfer may in\r\nactuality result in an adverse employment situation amounting to, for example, a demotion.  <em>See\r\nSharp v. City of Houston</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"760485\"><a href=\"/opinion/760485/78-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1779-74-empl-prac-dec-p-45704-patrice/\"><span class=\"volume\">164</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">923</span></a></span>, 933 (5th Cir. 1999) (transfer of officer from elite unit to\r\nseverely worse unit held to be adverse under section 1983 claim).  Generally, lateral transfers and\r\nrotations promoting reasonable business purposes do not rise to a level of an adverse action without\r\na further showing of harm.  <em>See Serna v. City of San Antonio</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772573\"><a href=\"/opinion/772573/onofre-serna-v-the-city-of-san-antonio-al-philippus/\"><span class=\"volume\">244</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">479</span></a></span>, 482-83 (5th Cir. 2001)\r\n(in whistle-blower case, transfer without cut in pay or benefits may be adverse action but plaintiff\r\nmust show transfer caused plaintiff serious, objective, tangible harm).  Although we recognize that\r\nthese cases do not involve seniority systems, similar principles apply. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFor purposes of this appeal, we hold that the evidence proffered by the appellees\r\nconstituted direct evidence of intent to discriminate with respect to adoption of Policy 712. \r\nNevertheless, we hold that even in the face of direct evidence of an intent to discriminate, the\r\nofficers must prove that the employment decision in fact caused the officers to suffer a\r\ndiscriminatory adverse employment action.  This they failed to do.  Ordinarily, failure to submit a\r\nnecessary issue would require reversal.  In this instance, in light of these unique<span> </span>facts, and the\r\nabsence of controlling law, we believe the interest of justice requires a new trial. <span><em> </em></span></span><span><em>See </em>Tex.

Under <em>Price Waterhouse</em>, the employer's successful showing relieved the employer of liability. \r\nBoth the federal and state statutes now provide that the employer's showing that the employment\r\ndecision would have been made in any event only limits the employee's remedies but not the\r\nemployer's liability.\r\n</p><p>3.        In her <em>Price Waterhouse</em> concurrence, Justice O'Connor concludes that in order to shift the\r\nburden of persuasion to the employer, \"the plaintiff must produce evidence sufficient to show that\r\nan illegitimate criterion was a substantial factor in the particular employment decision such that a\r\nreasonable factfinder could draw an inference that the decision was made 'because of' the plaintiff's\r\nprotected status.\"  <em>Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112252\"><a href=\"/opinion/112252/price-waterhouse-v-hopkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">228</span></a></span>, 278 (1989) <span>(O'Connor, J.,\r\nconcurring).\r\n<p>4.        Even if Sanders's and Lopez's statements do not constitute direct evidence of discrimination,\r\nbecause the case was fully tried on the merits we do not believe that fact to be controlling.  </p></span><span>The\r\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit instructs that after an employment discrimination\r\ncase has been tried on the merits, the proper inquiry is whether the judgment is supported by\r\nsufficient evidence.  <em>See Patterson v. P.H.P. Healthcare Corp.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"722555\"><a href=\"/opinion/722555/donna-patterson-nicholas-brown-and-michael-l-adams-v-php-healthcare/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">927</span></a></span>, 933 (5th Cir. 1996);\r\n<em>Haun v. Ideal Indus., Inc.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"716635\"><a href=\"/opinion/716635/70-fair-emplpraccas-bna-923-44-fed-r-evid-serv-414-philip-j/\"><span class=\"volume\">81</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">541</span></a></span>, 546 (5th Cir. 1996) (\"On appeal of a jury's verdict of age\r\ndiscrimination, we need not address the sufficiency of [the plaintiff's] prima facie case, but proceed\r\nto determine whether there was sufficient evidence upon which a jury could find that discrimination\r\noccurred.\").\r\n<p>5.        We note that appellees' ability to produce direct evidence of discriminatory animus did not\r\nresult in an automatic judgment in their favor; the existence of direct evidence only shifted the\r\nburdens of production and persuasion to APD to show that it would have made the same\r\nemployment decision regardless of appellees' age.  <em>See </em></p></span><span><em>Price Waterhouse</em>, 490 U.S. at 244-45.</span><span>  The\r\njury failed to find that APD would have done so.\r\n<p>6.        We note that when asked in Question No. 2 whether as to the two officers asserting a retaliation\r\nclaim a lateral transfer was an adverse employment action, the jury answered in the negative. \r\n</p><p>7.        Appellant argues in the alternative that, had the jury found the required element, the record\r\ncontains legally and factually insufficient evidence to support a finding in appellees' favor. \r\nReviewing the evidence under the proper standards of review, we hold that had the issue been asked\r\nthe record contains some evidence of injury and therefore we cannot say that the evidence is legally\r\ninsufficient to prove the fact.  Without repeating the evidence set out herein, however, we hold that\r\nthe evidence in the record is so weak as to make the judgment clearly wrong and therefore factually\r\ninsufficient to prove the policy caused the officers to experience adverse harm, requiring a remand.\r\n</p></span></p>\r\n</div>",
