Acts    1985, 69th Leg.,   1st C.S.,    ch. 1, at\n                   3777.     Sections 2 and 3 of Ehe act amended sections 26.04, 26.06, and\n                 . 26.07 of the Tax Code, which set forth the requirements                  for the\n                   effective     ad valorem tax rate calculation,       for the content of the\n                   notice of the public meetings held prior to the adoption of the tax\n                   rate, and for the tax rate rollback petition         and election   procedures,\n                   respectively,     with which taxing units must comply.       You ask us three\n                   questions      regarding  the effect      of   the act and its       amendatory\n                   provisions.\n\n                          Section 26.04 of the Tax Code sets forth the method by which the\n                   so-called     “effective    tax’rate”     is calculated     by each taxing unit prior\n                   to the adoption of its ad valorem tax rate.                  The “effective     tax rate”\n                   is that tax rate which, when imposed upon the property that was taxed.\n                   last    year    but using this          year’s     appraised   values,     will   produce\n                   approximately the amount of revenue that was produced last year.                      See\n    5\n                   Tex. Const. art. VIII,            section    21; Attorney General Opinion MW-m\n                   (1982).     Section 26.05 of the Tax Code provides that, if a taxing unit\n                   adopts a tax rate that exceeds the effective                   tax rate by more than\n                   three percent,         the taxing unit must hold a public hearing on the\n                   proposed increase and publish a specified               public notice of the meeting\n                   prior to Its being held.            See Tax Code 126.06.         Section    26.07 of the\n                   Tax Code permits qualifiedxters                 of the taxing unit by petition          to\n                   require that a tax rate rollback             election    be held if the adopted rate\n                   exceeds     the effective        rate by more than eight percent.                  If the\n                   election     is successful,       the adopted rate is reduced to “a rate that\n                   exceeds the rate calculated             by section      26.04 of this code by only\n                   eight percent .I’ Tax Code 526.07(a).\n\n\n\n\n                                                         p. 2900\n\fRonorable   Bevil   B.

Section 26.04(e)  was\namended by the act to include among the Items of information         that the\ntaxing unit is required to publicize        in connection with the calcula-\ntion of its effective     tax rate\n\n            a schedule       of the unit’s    expenses in providing\n            services    required by the Indigent Health Care and\n            Treatment    Act . . . showing the amount of required\n            expense which will be paid in the next year from\n            property     tax   revenues,   the amount of required\n            expense paid in the preceding year from property\n            tax     revenues,      and   the    amounts   of    state\n            reimbursement,      if any, received     or expected for\n            either year.\n\nTax Code 926.04(e)     (4).\n\n       Section   26.06 was amended by the addition       of subsection   (f).\nvhich lists the items of information        that the published notices    for\nthe ad valorem tax rate increase and for the vote on the adoption of\nthe tax rate must contain       for those   taxing units   that offer  health\nservices    as required by the act.     Each notice is required to specify\nexplicitly     the percentage  of the tax rate increase which is attri-\nbutable to the costs of providing        the required indigent health care\nservices.     Each such notice  must contain the following:\n\n            (Percentage of increase over the tax rate required\n            to levy amount needed for Indigent     health care\n            services)  percent of the increase will be used to\n            pay’for   services required by the Texas Legisla-\n            ture in the Indigent Health Care and Treatment\n            Act. . . .\n\nTax Code 126,06(f).\n\n      Finally. section 26.07 was amended by the addition  of subsection\n(h) . It is with this section that you are concerned.    Section 26.07.\nas amended, provides the folloving in pertinent part:\n\n            Sec.    26.07.

In that opinion, the question posed was:\n\n             tIln    an instance     in which there         has been a\n             successful   tax rate rollback     election    and In which\n             the    adopted    rate    includes     a    rate   increase\n             attributable    to the additional       costs incurred by\n             providing     the   indigent     health     care   services\n             required by the act, whether the rate increase for\n             providing    those health      fare    services    is   also\n             rolled back.\n\nWe set out the amendments to each section       of the Tax Code                     and\ndiscussed   the legislative  history of the portions  of the bill                    at\nissue.    We then concluded:\n\n             It is clear from a reading of the act that the\n             provisions     amending the Tax Code, taken together.\n             were meant to isolate        that portion of the tax rate\n             increase     attributable      to providing      the services\n             required by the act.

It  is clear from an even\ncursory reading of the amendments to the .Tax Code that Hardln County\nis not merely “entitled”   to include in its adopted tax rate for 1986\nan increase in tax rate attributable       to the additional    costs incurred\nby the county of complying with the Indigent Health Care and Treatment\nAct; the county is required to do so.           And it is equally clear that\nany such 1986 percentage rate increase           would not be subject     to a\nrollback   if a successful election    were held pursuant to section 26.07\nof the Tax Code.

You ask us three\n                   questions      regarding  the effect      of   the act and its       amendatory\n                   provisions.\n\n                          Section 26.04 of the Tax Code sets forth the method by which the\n                   so-called     “effective    tax’rate”     is calculated     by each taxing unit prior\n                   to the adoption of its ad valorem tax rate.                  The “effective     tax rate”\n                   is that tax rate which, when imposed upon the property that was taxed.\n                   last    year    but using this          year’s     appraised   values,     will   produce\n                   approximately the amount of revenue that was produced last year.

See Tax Code 126.06.         Section    26.07 of the\n                   Tax Code permits qualifiedxters                 of the taxing unit by petition          to\n                   require that a tax rate rollback             election    be held if the adopted rate\n                   exceeds     the effective        rate by more than eight percent.                  If the\n                   election     is successful,       the adopted rate is reduced to “a rate that\n                   exceeds the rate calculated             by section      26.04 of this code by only\n                   eight percent .I’ Tax Code 526.07(a).\n\n\n\n\n                                                         p. 2900\n\fRonorable   Bevil   B.

In that opinion, the question posed was:\n\n             tIln    an instance     in which there         has been a\n             successful   tax rate rollback     election    and In which\n             the    adopted    rate    includes     a    rate   increase\n             attributable    to the additional       costs incurred by\n             providing     the   indigent     health     care   services\n             required by the act, whether the rate increase for\n             providing    those health      fare    services    is   also\n             rolled back.\n\nWe set out the amendments to each section       of the Tax Code                     and\ndiscussed   the legislative  history of the portions  of the bill                    at\nissue.    We then concluded:\n\n             It is clear from a reading of the act that the\n             provisions     amending the Tax Code, taken together.\n             were meant to isolate        that portion of the tax rate\n             increase     attributable      to providing      the services\n             required by the act.

It  is clear from an even\ncursory reading of the amendments to the .Tax Code that Hardln County\nis not merely “entitled”   to include in its adopted tax rate for 1986\nan increase in tax rate attributable       to the additional    costs incurred\nby the county of complying with the Indigent Health Care and Treatment\nAct; the county is required to do so.           And it is equally clear that\nany such 1986 percentage rate increase           would not be subject     to a\nrollback   if a successful election    were held pursuant to section 26.07\nof the Tax Code. The rollback       limitations    applicable  to health care\ntaxation   apply only “in the first      year after    the effective   date of\n[the act],” 1985.
