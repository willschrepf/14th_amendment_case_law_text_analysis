Manna sought relief under the Land Use Petition Act (LUPA),\n\nchapter 36.70C RCW, and the superior court ordered Kittitas County (the County) to\n\ngrant the rezone. Manna additionally sued the County for a claimed violation of\n\nRCW 64.40.020 and 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and for tortious interference with a business\n\nexpectancy/tortious delay. The court dismissed Manna's lawsuit on summary judgment\n\nand awarded the County attorney fees. Manna appeals.\n\n       We affirm the summary judgment order based upon our conclusions that\n\n(1) Manna's application for rezoning was not an \"application for a permit\" for purposes\n\nof a cause of action under RCW 64.40.020; (2) Manna had no federally protected\n\nproperty interest in its application for rezoning for purposes of a claim under 42 U.S.c.\n\n§ 1983; and (3) Manna produced no evidence of a contractual relationship or business\n\nexpectancy necessary to sustain its claims for tortious interference with a business\n\nexpectancy or tortious delay. We vacate the attorney fee award, however, and remand to\n\nthe superior court with instructions to award the County its attorney fees attributable\n\nsolely to the RCW 64.40.020 claim.\n\n                                          FACTS\n\n       In October 2006, Manna submitted to Kittitas County its application for a site-\n\nspecific rezone from \"Forest and Range 20\" (FR-20) to \"Rural 3\" (R-3) of its 100.31\n\n\n                                             2\n\n\fNo. 30539~2-II1\nManna Funding v. Kittitas County\n\n\nacres of land lying north of the City of Roslyn and east of State Route 903. The land had\n\nbeen zoned FR-20 in 1992. The requested rezone would allow a reduction in lot sizes\n\nfrom 20 acres to 3 acres per residential unit. Manna made clear in its application that it\n\nwas currently seeking only a zoning reclassification. that no specific development\n\nactivities were currently proposed, and that any future development would comply with\n\nthe County's development regulations existing at the time ofthe application. A State\n\nEnvironmental Policy Act (SEPA), chapter 43.21C RCW, mitigated determination of\n\nnonsignificance was issued by County staff in December 2006.\n\n       After open record proceedings that included public testimony for and against\n\nManna's proposal, the County's Planning Commission adopted findings of fact and a\n\nrecommendation that the Board deny the rezone. The Board did so by Resolution 2007­\n\n53 that was entered on May 15,2007. The Board found that Manna failed to prove the\n\nrezone would contribute to the health, safety, and welfare of the surrounding zone, but did\n\nnot elaborate on that finding. The Board also determined that Manna's proposal failed to\n\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\n\fNo.30539-2-II1\nManna Funding v. Kittitas County\n\n\nmeet several necessary criteria for a rezone under Kittitas County Code (KCC)\n\n17.98.020(7).2 The Board's findings reflected concerns that questionable property access\n\nand steep slope hindering fire safety impacted the public health, safety, and welfare; that\n\nthe rezone would not have merit or value for the County or sub-area; that the steep slope\n\nmade the property unsuitable for reasonable development in general conformance with R­\n\n3 zoning standards; and, that the proposed rezone would be materially detrimental to the\n\nnearby urban forest zone and possibly to the historic city of Roslyn. The Board gave no\n\nother supporting details or reasons for its findings.\n\n\n\n       2 The  criteria in KCC 17.98.020(7) are:\n          a. \t The proposed amendment is compatible with the comprehensive plan.\n          b. \t The proposed amendment bears a substantial relation to the public health,\n               safety or welfare.\n          c. \t The proposed amendment has merit and value for Kittitas County or a sub­\n               area of the county.\n          d. \t The proposed amendment is appropriate because of changed circumstances\n               or because of a need for additional property in the proposed zone or because\n               the proposed zone is appropriate for reasonable development of the subject\n               property.\n          e. \t The subject property is suitable for development in general conformance\n               with zoning standards for the proposed zone.\n          f. \t The proposed amendment will not be materially detrimental to the use of\n               properties in the immediate vicinity of the subject property.\n          g. \t The proposed changes in use ofthe subject property shall not adversely\n               impact irrigation water deliveries to other properties.\n          h. \t The proposed amendment is in full compliance with chapter 17.13 KCC,\n               Transfer of Development Rights.\nSubsection h was added by Ordinance 2010-006 in 2010 and is not applicable in this case.\n\n                                              4\n\n\fNo. 30539-2-III\nManna Funding v. Kittitas County\n\n\n       On June 5,2007, Manna filed a LUPA petition requesting the superior court to\n\noverturn Resolution 2007-53. The petition also incorporated a complaint for damages\n\nunder RCW 64.40.020 and 42 U.S.C. § 1983. After determining that the Board failed to\n\nadequately review the record and make meaningful findings of fact from which its\n\nconclusions could be drawn, the superior court reversed the Board's decision, vacated\n\nResolution 2007-53, and remanded the matter for new hearings before the Planning\n\nCommission and Board. The court specifically instructed the Board to conduct on-the­\n\nrecord discussions to illuminate its decision-making, and to make detailed findings of fact\n\nto support its conclusions. The court elaborated:\n\n      Any finding of fact and conclusion of law set forth in the resolution should\n      reflect just what the Board has reviewed in determihing its findings.\n      Moreover, the findings should be based upon the evidence presented, not on\n      conclusions that the applicant did not meet rezone criteria. For instance, if\n      the Board were to make an ultimate finding that access was questionable, it\n      should make particular findings based upon the record to demonstrate why\n      the access was questionable .... Similarly, making a bald finding that the\n      petitioners did not meet their burden of proof to demonstrate the rezone\n      positively affected the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the\n      county, without making findings of fact as to why the Board concludes it\n      did not meet the burden does not help the court in its judicial review of the\n      proceedings.\n\nClerk's Papers (CP) at 534 n.18.\n\n      After a new public hearing and findings by the Planning Commission, the Board\n\nentered Resolution 2008-104 on June 17,2008, again denying Manna's application. The\n\n                                            5\n\n\fNo. 30539-2-III\nManna Funding v. Kittitas County\n\n\nBoard found Manna failed to show that the proposed R-3 zoning would contribute to the\n\nhealth. safety, and welfare of the surrounding zone. The Board further found with respect\n\nto the KCC rezone criteria that (1) Manna's proposed amendment \"would not change\n\naccess to the property\" and therefore bears no relation to the health, safety, and welfare,\n\n(2) Manna failed to prove the rezone had merit and value for Kittitas County or a sub-area\n\nof the County, (3) \"there is no warranted change in circumstances ... [and] further ... the\n\nanalysis in the record is not sufficient to determine there is a need for additional property\n\nin the proposed zone,\" and (4) \"information in the record regarding the commercial forest\n\nzone to the north and the Urban Forest Zone to the south would make a Rural-3 zone\n\ndetrimental to the existing zones.\" CP at 790.\n\n       On July 8,2008, Manna filed a second LUPA petition, seeking to overturn\n\nResolution 2008-104. The petition likewise included a complaint for damages under\n\nRCW 64.40.020 and 42 U.S.C. § 1983. In a memorandum decision issued on February 5,\n\n2009, the court observed that the Board failed to heed its instructions to include detailed\n\nfindings to explain the reasons for its decision, and that its findings were again too\n\nconclusory for review. The court ruled that substantial evidence conclusively established\n\nManna had met its burden on all of the KCC rezoning criteria, and that the R-3 zone\n\ncomports with the comprehensive plan and implements its goals and policies relating to\n\n\n                                              6\n\n\fNo.30539-2-II1\nManna Funding v, Kittitas County\n\n\nrural lands. Consequently, the rezone bears a substantial relationship to the public\n           3\nwelfare. The court thus reversed the Board's decision, vacated Resolution 2008-104,\n\nand remanded the matter to the Board with instructions to approve Manna's requested\n\nrezone,4 The County did not appeal. On February 18,2009, the Board entered an\n\nordinance approving Manna's requested R-3 zone change.\n\n       Manna subsequently filed an amended complaint on August 11, 2011, adding .\n\nclaims for tortious interference with a business expectancy and tortious delay, Manna\n\nfiled a motion for partial summary judgment as to RCW 64.40.020 liability of the County\n\nfor claimed arbitrary and unlawful delay by the Board, while reserving damages issues for\n\ndiscovery and a trial. The County filed a cross motion for summary judgment to dismiss\n\nManna's entire lawsuit on grounds of absence of standing, limitations, ripeness, and\n\n\n\n       3   The court cited to Henderson v, Kittitas County, 124 Wn, App. 747,100 P.3d 842\n(2004) (rezone that furthers the goals of the county's comprehensive plan bears a\nsubstantial relationship to the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare) .\n       . 4 While not expressed in its written findings, the Board's limited discussions on the\nrecord revealed continued concern about access to the property due to steepness/safety\nissues, and perceived lack of merit or value to the County because Manna had no project\npending and it was only speculative whether the assessed value of the property may\nincrease. The court rejected these considerations in its memorandum decision. The court\nruled there was no basis for a finding of no relationship to the health, safety, and welfare\nof the County because road access/engineering issues are not proper considerations for\nzoning approval. but pertain only to specific development/permitting requirements. The\ncourt also found Manna provided evidence that the rezone would eventually add to the\nCounty's tax base. thus demonstrating merit and value for the County.\n\n                                              7\n\fNo. 30539-2-II1\nManna Funding v. Kittitas County\n\n\nfailure to satisfY the elements of its various claims. The court denied Manna's motion\n\nand granted the County's motion. The court awarded the County $21,496.50 in attorney\n\nfees as prevailing party under RCW 64.40.020. Manna appeals.\n\n                                        ANALYSIS\n\n       This court reviews an order of summary judgment de novo. Hisle v. Todd Pac.\n\nShipyards Corp., 151 Wn.2d 853, 860, 93 P.3d 108 (2004). Summary judgment is\n\nappropriate when there is \"no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving\n\nparty is entitled to a judgment as a matter oflaw.\" CR 56(c). \"A material fact is of such\n\na nature that it affects the outcome of the litigation.\" Ruffv. County ofKing, 125 Wn.2d\n\n697,703,887 P.2d 886 (1995). We consider the facts and inferences from the facts in the\n\nlight most favorable to the nonmoving party. Jones v. Allstate Ins. Co., 146 Wn.2d 291,\n\n300, 45 P.3d 1068 (2002).\n\n       A defendant moving for summary judgment may meet the initial burden by\n\npointing out the absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case. Young v.\n\nKey Pharms., Inc., 112 Wn.2d 216, 225 n.l, 770 P.2d 182 (1989) (quoting Celotex Corp.\n\nv. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317,325,106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986)). \"If the moving\n\nparty is a defendant and meets the initial showing, then the inquiry shifts to the party with\n\nthe burden of proof at trial, the plaintiff.\" Id. at 225 (footnote omitted). The facts set\n\n\n\n                                              8\n\n\fNo.30539-2-III\nManna Funding v. Kittitas County\n\n\nforth must be specific, detailed, and not speculative or conclusory. Sanders v. Woods.\n\n121 Wn. App. 593, 600, 89 P.3d 312 (2004). If, at this point, the plaintiff'\"fails to make\n\na showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case,\n\nand on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial', then the trial court should\n\ngrant the motion.\" Young, 112 Wn.2d at 225 (quoting Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322).\n\n       Damages Claim under RCW 64.40.020. The issue is whether a site-specific rezone\n\napplication is an \"application for a permit\" for purposes of a cause of action under chapter\n\n64.40 RCW.\n\n       RCW 64.40.020(1) provides in pertinent part:\n\n       Owners of a property interest who have filed an application for a permit\n       have an action for damages to obtain relief from acts ofan agency which\n       are arbitrary, capricious, unlawful, or exceed lawful authority.\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n\n       The definitions section in RCW 64.40.010 includes the following:\n\n              (2) \"Permit\" means any governmental approval required by law\n       before an owner of a property interest may improve, sell, transfer, or\n       otherwise put real property to use.\n\n               (5) \"Regulation\" means any ordinance, resolution, or other rule or\n        regulation adopted pursuant to the authority provided by state law. which\n        imposes or alters restrictions, limitations, or conditions on the use of real\n      . property.\n               (6) \"Act\" means a final decision by an agency which places\n        requirements, limitations, or conditions upon the use of real property in\n\n                                              9\n\fNo.30539-2-III\nManna Funding v. Kittitas County\n\n\n       excess of those allowed by applicable regulations in effect on the date an\n       application for a permit is filed.\n\n       Manna broadly contends that Resolutions 2007-53 and 2008-104 were \"acts\" on an\n\n\"application for a penni!\" for purposes of RCW 64.40.020( 1) because they were final\n\ndecisions by the County that placed limitations upon the use of Manna's real property.\n\nManna then argues that a site-specific rezone application plainly falls within the\n\ndefinition of \"permit\" because it is a \"governmental approval required by law\" before an\n\nowner of a property interest may \"put real property to use.\" Manna reasons that a site-\n\nspecific rezone application involves quasi-judicial decisionmaking, thus subjecting an\n\nagency to liability under RCW 64.40.020. Lutheran Day Care v. Snohomish County, 119\n\nWn.2d 91,103-05,111,829 P.2d 746 (1992). This is in contrast to area-wide rezones,\n\nwhich are legislative in nature and subject to a different review procedure under the\n\nGrowth Management Act, chapter 36.70A RCW. Woods v. Kittitas County, 162 Wn.2d\n\n597,608, 174 P.3d 25 (2007). The definition of \"project permit\" under LUPA 5 is\n\n\n\n       5 RCW 36.70C.020(2) provides in pertinent part: \n\n       \"Land use decision\" means a final determination by a local jurisdiction's body or \n\n       officer with the highest level of authority to make the determination, including \n\n       those with authority to hear appeals. on: \n\n              (a) An application for a project permit or other governmental approval\n       required by law before real property may be improved, developed, modified, sold,\n       transferred, or used, but ... excluding applications for legislative approvals such\n       as area-wide rezones and annexations.\n\n                                             10 \n\n\fNo.30539-2-II1\nManna Funding v. Kittitas County\n\n\nvirtually identical to the definition of \"permit\" under RCW 64.40.010(2), as shown by\n\ncase law establishing that a site-specific rezone is a '\"project permit application\" subject to\n\nLUPA review. Wenatchee Sportsmen Ass 'n v. Chelan County, 141 Wn.2d 169, 181 n.2, 4\n\nP.3d 123 (2000); Woods, 162 Wn.2d at 608. Manna thus reasons that to hold that a site-\n\nspecific rezone meets the definition of \"permit\" under L UPA but not the virtually\n\nidentical definition in RCW 64.40.010(2) would defy plain meaning. And consistent with\n\nthis reasoning, the term \"permit\" for purposes of a cause of action under RCW 64.40.020\n\nis not strictly limited to building permits, grading permits and the like, but pertains to a\n\nbroad range of approval and decisions affecting use of property-including rezone\n\ndecisions.\n\n       The County contends that RCW 64.40.020(1), by its clear terms, allows recovery\n\nof damages only to a property owner who has applied for a permit to develop the\n\nproperty. Since Manna's application was strictly for a rezone, it lacks standing to bring a\n\nclaim under RCW 64.40.020(1). Westway Constr., Inc. v. Benton County, 136 Wn. App.\n\n859, 866, 151 P .3d 1005 (2006).\n\n       No Washington case is cited or found that addresses whether a site-specific rezone\n\napplication is an \"application for a permit\" under RCW 64.40.020( 1). Statutory\n\ninterpretation is a question of law reviewed de novo. W. Telepage, Inc. v. City o/Tacoma\n\n\n                                              11 \n\n\fNo.30539-2-III\nManna Funding v.

While\n\nManna does have the standing of an interested property owner under RCW 64.40.020(1),\n\nthe dispositive question is whether it also has the permit applicant status necessary to sue\n\nunder the statute.\n\n       RCW 64.40.020(1) is also clear that a \"permit\" applicant's cause of action for\n\ndamages is \"to obtain relief from acts of an agency.\" (Emphasis added.) A county is an\n\nagency for purposes of the statute. RCW 64.40.010(1); Lutheran Day Care, 119 Wn.2d\n\nat 101. Under RCW 64.40.010(6), an \"act\" is defined as that which places \"requirements,\n\nlimitations, or conditions upon the use of real property in excess ofthose allowed by\n\napplicable regulations in effect on the date an application for a permit is filed. \"\n\n(Emphasis added.) Manna does not address the above-italicized language.

The bill originated as H.B. 1006 and became Substitute H.B. 1006. Viewing\n\nlegislative history, the bill file includes a document entitled \"Bill Analysis\" for the House\n\nCommittee on Local Government. The document explains the bill's intended scope:\n\n       Acts of a public entity which are subject to a lawsuit under the bill include\n       requirements or conditions placed upon land that are in excess of the zoning·\n       and other restrictions upon the use of the land in effect at the time an\n       application fora \"permit[\"J is made.

Kittitas County\n\n\n       More pointedly, the House Committee file and Senate Committee file also each\n\ninclude a \"Discussion of Issues\" document that contains the following question and\n\nanswer:\n\n       3.     Will HB 1006 create a cause of action if an application for a zone\n              change is denied?\n       [Answer] No. HB 1006 does not apply to zone changes. It only creates a cause of\n       action when the allowable use under applicable regulations is denied or restricted\n       without just cause.\n\nDiscussion of Issues, H.B. 1006, 47th Leg., Reg. Sess., at 1 (Wash. 1982) (on file with\n\nWash. State Archives).\n\n       In addition, a bill summary from the Washington Association.ofRealtors\n\ncontained in the Senate Committee file sheds further light on the object of legislative\n\nremedy-government attempts to \"downzone\" property following receipt of permit\n\napplications. The Realtors summary explains that a typical example of the problem was a\n\ndeveloper who filed a legal action claiming an arbitrary and capricious decision by the\n\ncounty for approving his plat, but with one-third less lots than allowed by zoning. Two\n\nyears later, the court overturned the lower density so the plat was finally approved as\n\n\nJOURNAL,   47th Leg., Reg. Sess., at 1449 (Wash. 1982). Senator Hemstad responded:\n'\" What it is doing is providing to a party with a grievance for arbitrary, capricious, or\nunlawful conduct by local officials in failure on a timely basis to authorize the\ndevelopment of the property to recover damages for that period of time in which the\nproperty was improperly withheld from development.'\" Id.\n\n                                              15 \n\n\fNo. 30539-2-II1\nManna Funding v. Kittitas County\n\n\noriginally requested with full density, but current law (pre-chapter 64.40 RCW) did not\n\ngive the property owner any damages relief. Wash. Ass'n of Realtors, No.1 Priority for\n\n1982, Substitute H.B. 1006, Section 8 (Wash. Feb. 12, 1982) (located in Senate\n\nCommittee on Judiciary file on H.B. 1006) (on file with Wash. State Archives).\n\n      Manna's situation is just the opposite because its application was to upzone its\n\nproperty from FR-20 to R-3. The County did not impose restrictions of less than one\n\nresidence for every 20 acres when it denied Manna's requested R-3 rezone. This helps\n\nfurther illustrate why the County's resolutions denying the rezone were not \"acts\" as\n\ndefined in RCW 64.40.010(6) because its challenged decisions did not place any hew\n\nrequirements, limitations, or conditions upon the use of real property in excess of those\n\nallowed Manna under then-current FR-20 zoning. Critically, Manna's application was\n\nstrictly for a rezone only and not for any type of development permit.\n\n       We conclude that when the plain language of the statute pertaining to \"acts\" of an\n\nagency for which an \"applicant\" may sue is viewed in light of the legislative history, an\n\napplication, such as Manna's, that solely requests the rezoning o/property is not an\n\n\"application for a permit\" under RCW 64.40.020(1). See Westmark Dev. Corp. v. City 0/\n\nBurien, 140 Wn. App. 540, 548, 166 P.3d 813 (2007) (purpose of chapter 64.40 RCW is\n\nto '\" provide a swift remedy for property damage caused by   govern~ental   agency\n\n\n                                            16\n\fNo. 30539-2-II1\nManna Funding v.

City o/Seattle, 122 Wn.2d 814,825,863 P.2d 1336 (1993)).\n\n       While Manna correctly argues that a court determining legislative intent may also\n\nlook to other statutes dealing with the same subject matter, see e.g., Harmon, 134 Wn.2d\n\nat 530, such inquiry is not relevant here. Manna's analogy to RCW 36.70C.020(2)(a) and\n\ncase authority from Wenatchee Sportsmen and Woods that a site-specific rezone is a\n\n\"project pennit application\" under LUPA is not controlling. Those cases did not involve\n\na claim under RCW 64.40.020. And Manna was able to receive its available remedy\n\nunder LUPA when the court ordered the County to approve the rezone and the County did\n\nso by ordinance. See RCW 36.70C.030(1)(c) (distinguishing land use petition from trial\n\non claims for monetary damages and compensation).\n\n       We affirm the trial court's summary judgment dismissal of Manna's\n\nRCW 64.40.020 claim on the sole basis that Manna did not file an \"application for a\n\npermit\" giving rise to a cause of action for any \"act\" of the County under the statute.

Until that time, its constitutionally protected property\n\ninterest was under existing FR-20 zoning for which no violation is claimed and nothing\n\nwas lost. Manna cites no authority that there is a federally protected property interest\n\nunder § 1983 in obtaining a decision on a mere application to rezone (\"upzone\") property.\n\nMoreover, the County promptly issued the rezone ordinance within two weeks of the trial\n\ncourt's order.\n\n       Accordingly, we uphold the trial court's summary judgment dismissal of Manna's\n\n§ 1983 claim on the basis there is no evidence that the County deprived Manna of a\n\nfederally protected property right. Manna's failure of proof on this essential element\n\nrenders immaterial the facts relating to ripeness issues and to Manna's claim that the\n\nBoard denied it substantive due process by acting in arbitrary or invidious and irrational\n\nfashion in passing on its rezone application.

City ofSeattle, 112\n\nWn.2d 794, 805, 774 P.2d 1158 (1989); Westmark Dev. Corp., 140 Wn. App. at 560.\n\nCiting to Westmark. Manna applies these five elements to both its tortious interference\n\nand tortious delay claims.

Kittitas County\n\n\nRESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS § 766B,        cmt. c (1979). \"All that is needed is a\n\nrelationship between parties contemplating a contract, with at least a reasonable\n\nexpectation of fruition. And this relationship must be known, or reasonably apparent, to\n\nthe interferor.\" Scymanski v. Dufault, 80 Wn.2d 77,84-85,491 P.2d 1050 (1971).\n\n       Manna contends that summary judgment dismissal was improper because it\n\nestablished a prima facie case on all five elements: (1) the business expectancy was the\n\nrezone approval once Manna met all of the KCC 17.98.020(7) criteria; (2) Kittitas County\n\nhad full knowledge of the relationship with Manna through its rezone application and first\n\nLUPA petition; (3) if not after Resolution 2007-53. then certainly after Resolution 2008­\n\n104, the County had intentionally interfered with Manna's expectation of a lawful rezone\n\ndecision; (4) the County had absolutely no legitimate purpose or interest in twice issuing\n\nunlawful and virtually unreviewable decisions that lacked any support in the record; and\n\n(5) Manna incurred delay damages from the County's action in an amount to be proven\n\nthrough pretrial discovery. We find no error.\n\n       Manna made clear in its rezone application that it was currently seeking only a\n\nzoning reclassification and that no specific development activities were currently\n\nproposed. Manna identified no prospective business relationship with any party and it\n\nrepeatedly insisted in both its application and contemporaneous environmental checklist\n\n\n                                            23 \n\n\fNo.30539-2-II1\nManna Funding v. Kittitas County\n\n\nthat the rezone was unrelated to any development project. Manna's manager, Tiffany\n\nDoty, verified these facts in her deposition testimony submitted with the County's\n\nsummary judgment motion. She testified Manna was only seeking rezone approval to\n\nallow for future creation of three-acre lots, and that between the time of the first rezone\n\ndenial in May 2007 and the rezone approval in February 2009, Manna had no written\n\ncontract or agreement of any kind with any developer. Thus, no agreement or business\n\nrelationship was terminated or severed because of the Board's denial of the rezone. Ms.\n\nDoty also said that although Manna had stayed in touch with some potential investors and\n\ndevelopers prior to the rezone denial, nothing occurred with respect to the property after\n\nthe rezone was approved. Manna had not applied for a subdivision of its property into\n\nthree-acre lots, nor did it apply for any building or development permits on the property.\n\nManna provided no contrary evidence in its response to the County's summary judgment\n\nmotion.\n\n       Thus, as argued by the County, Manna failed to produce evidence of the first two\n\nelements-existence (and knowledge by the County) of a valid contractual relationship or\n\nbusiness expectancy with which the County could interfere or delay. This renders all\n\nother facts immaterial with respect to the additional elements requiring the County's\n\nintentional interference, improper purpose or improper means. and proximate causation of\n\n\n                                             24 \n\n\fNo.30539-2-II1\nManna Funding v. Kittitas County\n\n\ndamages (of which Manna shows none in any event). Young, 112 Wn.2d at 225; Boyce,\n\n71 Wn. App. at 665.\n\n      The case Manna primarily relies on, Pleas v. City ofSeattle, is distinguishable.\n\nThere, the City was held liable for intentional interference with developer Parkridge's\n\nbusiness expectancy because it acted with an improper purpose (political motives and\n\nfavoritism to a neighborhood group)~ and by improper means (arbitrary delay) in refusing\n\nto grant necessary environmental and building permits for a high-rise apartment project\n\nthat was allowed under existing zoning regulations. Pleas, 112 Wn.2d at 796. Part of the\n\ndelay was also attributable to the city council granting an opposing neighborhood group's\n\n\"downzone\" application (filed after Parkridge applied for permits) that the court ruled\n\nwas \"unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious and therefore void.\" Id. at 797. Due to the\n\ndelays, Parkridge incurred ascertainable damages for lost profits, Joss of favorable\n\nfinancing, increased construction costs due to inflation, and the costs of an environmental\n\nimpact statement discarded by the City. Jd. at 799.\n\n       Here, in contrast to Pleas where the developer applied for specific project permits\n\nallowed under existing zoning, Manna only applied for a rezone to possibly facilitate\n\nfuture, but unspecified, development plans. Unlike the developer in Pleas who incurred\n\nactual damages, Manna did not identify any business expectancy of pecuniary value-no\n\n\n                                            25 \n\n\fNo. 30539-2-III\nManna Funding v. Kittitas County\n\n\nbusiness relationship, contract, or development project. All the County knew was that\n\nManna wanted it to approve a rezone. On these facts, only after Manna received its R-3\n\nrezone in February 2009 could it stand in similar shoes to the developer in Pleas. But the\n\nBoard acted expeditiously-within two weeks of the court's order-to enact the\n\nordinance granting Manna's rezone. Since there was no identified contract, permit, or\n\ncontemplated development activity (either pre- or post-ordinance), the County did nothing\n\nto interfere with or delay any business expectancy.\n\n       Manna's other cited interference with a business expectancy cases are likewise\n\ndistinguishable because they involved delay of identified projects. Westmark Dev. Corp.,\n\n140 Wn. App. at 558-63 (city interfered with business expectancy by acting with\n\nimproper purpose in singling out developer's apartment project and using improper means\n\nby unreasonably delaying original permit decision); City ofSeattle v. Blume, 134 Wn.2d\n\n243,947 P.2d 223 (1997) (city delayed processing of developer's master use permit for\n\noffice building/research facility designed in accord with current zoning regulations). Two\n\nother cases cited by Manna are inapposite because they are not interference with\n\nbusiness expectancy cases. Wilson, 122 Wn.2d at 823 (claim under RCW 64.40.020):\n\nCal([as v. Dep '1 ofConstr. & Land Use, 129 Wn. App. 579, 120 P.3d 110 (2005) (claims\n\nunder 42 U.S.c. § 1983 and RCW 64.40.020).\n\n\n                                            26\n\fNo. 30539-2-III\nManna Funding v. Kittitas County\n\n\n       We conclude that the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment\n\ndismissal of Manna's tortious interference and tortious delay claims.\n\n       Attorney Fees. Attorney fees may be awarded when authorized by a contract, a\n\nstatute, or a recognized ground in equity. Fisher Props., Inc. v. Arden-Mayfair, Inc., 106\n\nWn.2d 826. 849-50. 726 P.2d 8 (1986). RCW 64.40.020(2) provides: \"The prevailing\n\nparty in an action brought pursuant to this chapter may be entitled to reasonable costs and\n\nattorney's fees.\"\n\n       After prevailing on summary judgment, the County filed a motion and\n\naccompanying affidavit of counsel (with billing time sheets) requesting an award of\n\n$21,496.50 in attorney fees and $1,665.99 in costs. The County's lawyer did not attempt\n\nto segregate fees attributable solely to the RCW 64.40.020 claim. Manna argued that the\n\nCounty was required to do so and that any fee award must be limited to those the County\n\ncould actually demonstrate were related to the RCW 64.40.020 claim. The County's\n\nlav.ryer disagreed but suggested if fee segregation were appropriate, perhaps 10 percent to\n\n20 percent of the time billed would fall outside of the RCW 64.40.020 claim.\n\n       The trial court's order awarding attorney fees states in its entirety: \n\n\n       Kittitas County, as the prevailing party under RCW 64.40.020, is awarded \n\n       judgment for $21,496.50 in attorney fees. The request for costs is denied \n\n       because the costs requested do not qualify as court costs. \n\n\n\n                                              27\n\fNo. 30539-2-III\nManna Funding v. Kittitas County\n\n\nCP at 1531.\n\n       Manna again contends the trial court erred in failing to require the County to\n\nsegregate its fees attributable only to the RCW 64.40.020 claim. We agree.\n\n       \"If attorney fees are recoverable for only some of a party's claims, the award must\n\nproperly reflect a segregation of the time spent on issues for which fees are authorized\n\nfrom time spent on other issues.\" Mayer v. City o.fSeattle, 102 Wn. App. 66,      79~80,    10\n\nP.3d 408 (2000); accord Dice v. City ofMontesano, 131 Wn. App. 675,690, 128 P.3d\n\n1253 (2006). A court is not, however, required \"to artificially segregate time ... where\n\nthe claims all relate to the same fact pattern, but allege.different bases for recovery.\"\n\nEthridge v. Hwang, 105 Wn. App. 447, 461, 20 P.3d 958 (2001) (citing Blair v. Wash.\n\nState Univ., 108 Wn.2d 558, 572, 740 P.2d 1379 (1987)). The party claiming an award of\n\nattorney fees has the burden of segregating its lawyer's time. Loeffelholz v. Citizens for\n\nLeaders With Ethics & Accountability Now, 119 Wn. App. 665, 690, 82 P.3d 1199\n\n(2004).\n\n       Although our review of an attorney fee award is for abuse of discretion, the trial\n\ncourt must nevertheless calculate the fees using the lodestar method of analysis, and it\n\nmust enter findings of fact and conclusions of law supporting its decision to award fees.\n\nMahler v. Szucs, 135 Wn.2d 398, 434-35, 957 P.2d 632 (1998). Such a record is\n\n\n                                              28\n\fNo. 30539-2-III\nManna Funding v. Kittitas County\n\n\nnecessary for an appellate court to review the award. Bentzen v. Demmons, 68 Wn. App.\n\n339,350,842 P.2d 1015 (1993). When a trial court fails to create the appropriate record,\n\nthe remedy is to remand for entry of proper findings and conclusions. Mahler, 135 Wn.2d\n\nat 435.\n\n          Such is the case here. The court did not enter any findings. Nor did it require the\n\nCounty to segregate out its lawyer's time unrelated to the RCW 64.40.020 claim. We\n\nobserve that while the County's billing entries are typically general in nature, some\n\nentries do specifY work on non-RCW 64.40.020 claims.\n\n          Consistent with the above-cited cases, we vacate the attorney fee award and\n\nremand for the superior court to determine the appropriate amount of attorney fees to be\n\nawarded to the County as prevailing party under RCW 64.40.020.\n\n          Holding. The summary judgment order dismissing Manna's lawsuit is affirmed.\n\nThe attorney fee award is vacated and remanded consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    Kulik, J.\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\n\n\nI4orsmo, C.J.\n\n                                               29\n\f",

All are collectively referred\nto by the parties as Manna.\n\fNo. 30539-2-II1\nManna Funding v. Kittitas County\n\n\nacreage near Roslyn. Manna sought relief under the Land Use Petition Act (LUPA),\n\nchapter 36.70C RCW, and the superior court ordered Kittitas County (the County) to\n\ngrant the rezone. Manna additionally sued the County for a claimed violation of\n\nRCW 64.40.020 and 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and for tortious interference with a business\n\nexpectancy/tortious delay. The court dismissed Manna's lawsuit on summary judgment\n\nand awarded the County attorney fees. Manna appeals.\n\n       We affirm the summary judgment order based upon our conclusions that\n\n(1) Manna's application for rezoning was not an \"application for a permit\" for purposes\n\nof a cause of action under RCW 64.40.020; (2) Manna had no federally protected\n\nproperty interest in its application for rezoning for purposes of a claim under 42 U.S.c.\n\n§ 1983; and (3) Manna produced no evidence of a contractual relationship or business\n\nexpectancy necessary to sustain its claims for tortious interference with a business\n\nexpectancy or tortious delay. We vacate the attorney fee award, however, and remand to\n\nthe superior court with instructions to award the County its attorney fees attributable\n\nsolely to the RCW 64.40.020 claim.\n\n                                          FACTS\n\n       In October 2006, Manna submitted to Kittitas County its application for a site-\n\nspecific rezone from \"Forest and Range 20\" (FR-20) to \"Rural 3\" (R-3) of its 100.31\n\n\n                                             2\n\n\fNo. 30539~2-II1\nManna Funding v. Kittitas County\n\n\nacres of land lying north of the City of Roslyn and east of State Route 903. The land had\n\nbeen zoned FR-20 in 1992. The requested rezone would allow a reduction in lot sizes\n\nfrom 20 acres to 3 acres per residential unit. Manna made clear in its application that it\n\nwas currently seeking only a zoning reclassification. that no specific development\n\nactivities were currently proposed, and that any future development would comply with\n\nthe County's development regulations existing at the time ofthe application. A State\n\nEnvironmental Policy Act (SEPA), chapter 43.21C RCW, mitigated determination of\n\nnonsignificance was issued by County staff in December 2006.\n\n       After open record proceedings that included public testimony for and against\n\nManna's proposal, the County's Planning Commission adopted findings of fact and a\n\nrecommendation that the Board deny the rezone. The Board did so by Resolution 2007­\n\n53 that was entered on May 15,2007. The Board found that Manna failed to prove the\n\nrezone would contribute to the health, safety, and welfare of the surrounding zone, but did\n\nnot elaborate on that finding.

Kittitas County\n\n\nmeet several necessary criteria for a rezone under Kittitas County Code (KCC)\n\n17.98.020(7).2 The Board's findings reflected concerns that questionable property access\n\nand steep slope hindering fire safety impacted the public health, safety, and welfare; that\n\nthe rezone would not have merit or value for the County or sub-area; that the steep slope\n\nmade the property unsuitable for reasonable development in general conformance with R­\n\n3 zoning standards; and, that the proposed rezone would be materially detrimental to the\n\nnearby urban forest zone and possibly to the historic city of Roslyn. The Board gave no\n\nother supporting details or reasons for its findings.\n\n\n\n       2 The  criteria in KCC 17.98.020(7) are:\n          a. \t The proposed amendment is compatible with the comprehensive plan.\n          b. \t The proposed amendment bears a substantial relation to the public health,\n               safety or welfare.\n          c. \t The proposed amendment has merit and value for Kittitas County or a sub­\n               area of the county.\n          d. \t The proposed amendment is appropriate because of changed circumstances\n               or because of a need for additional property in the proposed zone or because\n               the proposed zone is appropriate for reasonable development of the subject\n               property.\n          e. \t The subject property is suitable for development in general conformance\n               with zoning standards for the proposed zone.\n          f. \t The proposed amendment will not be materially detrimental to the use of\n               properties in the immediate vicinity of the subject property.\n          g. \t The proposed changes in use ofthe subject property shall not adversely\n               impact irrigation water deliveries to other properties.\n          h. \t The proposed amendment is in full compliance with chapter 17.13 KCC,\n               Transfer of Development Rights.\nSubsection h was added by Ordinance 2010-006 in 2010 and is not applicable in this case.\n\n                                              4\n\n\fNo. 30539-2-III\nManna Funding v. Kittitas County\n\n\n       On June 5,2007, Manna filed a LUPA petition requesting the superior court to\n\noverturn Resolution 2007-53. The petition also incorporated a complaint for damages\n\nunder RCW 64.40.020 and 42 U.S.C. § 1983. After determining that the Board failed to\n\nadequately review the record and make meaningful findings of fact from which its\n\nconclusions could be drawn, the superior court reversed the Board's decision, vacated\n\nResolution 2007-53, and remanded the matter for new hearings before the Planning\n\nCommission and Board. The court specifically instructed the Board to conduct on-the­\n\nrecord discussions to illuminate its decision-making, and to make detailed findings of fact\n\nto support its conclusions. The court elaborated:\n\n      Any finding of fact and conclusion of law set forth in the resolution should\n      reflect just what the Board has reviewed in determihing its findings.\n      Moreover, the findings should be based upon the evidence presented, not on\n      conclusions that the applicant did not meet rezone criteria. For instance, if\n      the Board were to make an ultimate finding that access was questionable, it\n      should make particular findings based upon the record to demonstrate why\n      the access was questionable .... Similarly, making a bald finding that the\n      petitioners did not meet their burden of proof to demonstrate the rezone\n      positively affected the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the\n      county, without making findings of fact as to why the Board concludes it\n      did not meet the burden does not help the court in its judicial review of the\n      proceedings.\n\nClerk's Papers (CP) at 534 n.18.\n\n      After a new public hearing and findings by the Planning Commission, the Board\n\nentered Resolution 2008-104 on June 17,2008, again denying Manna's application. The\n\n                                            5\n\n\fNo. 30539-2-III\nManna Funding v. Kittitas County\n\n\nBoard found Manna failed to show that the proposed R-3 zoning would contribute to the\n\nhealth. safety, and welfare of the surrounding zone. The Board further found with respect\n\nto the KCC rezone criteria that (1) Manna's proposed amendment \"would not change\n\naccess to the property\" and therefore bears no relation to the health, safety, and welfare,\n\n(2) Manna failed to prove the rezone had merit and value for Kittitas County or a sub-area\n\nof the County, (3) \"there is no warranted change in circumstances ... [and] further ... the\n\nanalysis in the record is not sufficient to determine there is a need for additional property\n\nin the proposed zone,\" and (4) \"information in the record regarding the commercial forest\n\nzone to the north and the Urban Forest Zone to the south would make a Rural-3 zone\n\ndetrimental to the existing zones.\" CP at 790.\n\n       On July 8,2008, Manna filed a second LUPA petition, seeking to overturn\n\nResolution 2008-104. The petition likewise included a complaint for damages under\n\nRCW 64.40.020 and 42 U.S.C. § 1983. In a memorandum decision issued on February 5,\n\n2009, the court observed that the Board failed to heed its instructions to include detailed\n\nfindings to explain the reasons for its decision, and that its findings were again too\n\nconclusory for review. The court ruled that substantial evidence conclusively established\n\nManna had met its burden on all of the KCC rezoning criteria, and that the R-3 zone\n\ncomports with the comprehensive plan and implements its goals and policies relating to\n\n\n                                              6\n\n\fNo.30539-2-II1\nManna Funding v, Kittitas County\n\n\nrural lands. Consequently, the rezone bears a substantial relationship to the public\n           3\nwelfare. The court thus reversed the Board's decision, vacated Resolution 2008-104,\n\nand remanded the matter to the Board with instructions to approve Manna's requested\n\nrezone,4 The County did not appeal. On February 18,2009, the Board entered an\n\nordinance approving Manna's requested R-3 zone change.\n\n       Manna subsequently filed an amended complaint on August 11, 2011, adding .\n\nclaims for tortious interference with a business expectancy and tortious delay, Manna\n\nfiled a motion for partial summary judgment as to RCW 64.40.020 liability of the County\n\nfor claimed arbitrary and unlawful delay by the Board, while reserving damages issues for\n\ndiscovery and a trial. The County filed a cross motion for summary judgment to dismiss\n\nManna's entire lawsuit on grounds of absence of standing, limitations, ripeness, and\n\n\n\n       3   The court cited to Henderson v, Kittitas County, 124 Wn, App. 747,100 P.3d 842\n(2004) (rezone that furthers the goals of the county's comprehensive plan bears a\nsubstantial relationship to the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare) .\n       . 4 While not expressed in its written findings, the Board's limited discussions on the\nrecord revealed continued concern about access to the property due to steepness/safety\nissues, and perceived lack of merit or value to the County because Manna had no project\npending and it was only speculative whether the assessed value of the property may\nincrease. The court rejected these considerations in its memorandum decision. The court\nruled there was no basis for a finding of no relationship to the health, safety, and welfare\nof the County because road access/engineering issues are not proper considerations for\nzoning approval. but pertain only to specific development/permitting requirements. The\ncourt also found Manna provided evidence that the rezone would eventually add to the\nCounty's tax base. thus demonstrating merit and value for the County.\n\n                                              7\n\fNo. 30539-2-II1\nManna Funding v.

Manna thus reasons that to hold that a site-\n\nspecific rezone meets the definition of \"permit\" under L UPA but not the virtually\n\nidentical definition in RCW 64.40.010(2) would defy plain meaning. And consistent with\n\nthis reasoning, the term \"permit\" for purposes of a cause of action under RCW 64.40.020\n\nis not strictly limited to building permits, grading permits and the like, but pertains to a\n\nbroad range of approval and decisions affecting use of property-including rezone\n\ndecisions.\n\n       The County contends that RCW 64.40.020(1), by its clear terms, allows recovery\n\nof damages only to a property owner who has applied for a permit to develop the\n\nproperty.

Viewing\n\nlegislative history, the bill file includes a document entitled \"Bill Analysis\" for the House\n\nCommittee on Local Government. The document explains the bill's intended scope:\n\n       Acts of a public entity which are subject to a lawsuit under the bill include\n       requirements or conditions placed upon land that are in excess of the zoning·\n       and other restrictions upon the use of the land in effect at the time an\n       application fora \"permit[\"J is made. A \"permit\" is defined as governmental\n       approval required by law before a property owner may improve, sell or\n       otherwise use property.\n\nHOUSE COMM. ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT, H.B. ANALYSIS on H.B. 1006, at 2, 47th\n\nLeg., Reg. Sess. (Wash. Jan. 25,1982) (on file with Wash. State Archives); see\n\nalso HOUSE COMM. ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT, SUMMARY on H.B. 1006 (\"Act\" is\n\ndefined as when public entity imposes conditions or limitations which are more\n\nstringent than those contained in adopted regulations) (on file with Wash.

State Archives).6\n\n\n\n       6  The Senate Journal contains another pertinent point of inquiry about the bill's\nintent. Senator Metcalf queried: \", Senator Hemstad, this does, then, make it substantially\neasier to develop property? This is a development bill, this is a real estate development\nbill or is it, make it more difficult or more easy to develop propertyT \" 1 SENATE\n\n                                             14\n\fNo. 30539~2-III\nManna Funding v. Kittitas County\n\n\n       More pointedly, the House Committee file and Senate Committee file also each\n\ninclude a \"Discussion of Issues\" document that contains the following question and\n\nanswer:\n\n       3.     Will HB 1006 create a cause of action if an application for a zone\n              change is denied?\n       [Answer] No. HB 1006 does not apply to zone changes. It only creates a cause of\n       action when the allowable use under applicable regulations is denied or restricted\n       without just cause.\n\nDiscussion of Issues, H.B. 1006, 47th Leg., Reg. Sess., at 1 (Wash. 1982) (on file with\n\nWash. State Archives).\n\n       In addition, a bill summary from the Washington Association.ofRealtors\n\ncontained in the Senate Committee file sheds further light on the object of legislative\n\nremedy-government attempts to \"downzone\" property following receipt of permit\n\napplications. The Realtors summary explains that a typical example of the problem was a\n\ndeveloper who filed a legal action claiming an arbitrary and capricious decision by the\n\ncounty for approving his plat, but with one-third less lots than allowed by zoning. Two\n\nyears later, the court overturned the lower density so the plat was finally approved as\n\n\nJOURNAL,   47th Leg., Reg. Sess., at 1449 (Wash. 1982). Senator Hemstad responded:\n'\" What it is doing is providing to a party with a grievance for arbitrary, capricious, or\nunlawful conduct by local officials in failure on a timely basis to authorize the\ndevelopment of the property to recover damages for that period of time in which the\nproperty was improperly withheld from development.'\" Id.\n\n                                              15 \n\n\fNo. 30539-2-II1\nManna Funding v. Kittitas County\n\n\noriginally requested with full density, but current law (pre-chapter 64.40 RCW) did not\n\ngive the property owner any damages relief. Wash. Ass'n of Realtors, No.1 Priority for\n\n1982, Substitute H.B. 1006, Section 8 (Wash. Feb. 12, 1982) (located in Senate\n\nCommittee on Judiciary file on H.B. 1006) (on file with Wash. State Archives).\n\n      Manna's situation is just the opposite because its application was to upzone its\n\nproperty from FR-20 to R-3. The County did not impose restrictions of less than one\n\nresidence for every 20 acres when it denied Manna's requested R-3 rezone. This helps\n\nfurther illustrate why the County's resolutions denying the rezone were not \"acts\" as\n\ndefined in RCW 64.40.010(6) because its challenged decisions did not place any hew\n\nrequirements, limitations, or conditions upon the use of real property in excess of those\n\nallowed Manna under then-current FR-20 zoning. Critically, Manna's application was\n\nstrictly for a rezone only and not for any type of development permit.\n\n       We conclude that when the plain language of the statute pertaining to \"acts\" of an\n\nagency for which an \"applicant\" may sue is viewed in light of the legislative history, an\n\napplication, such as Manna's, that solely requests the rezoning o/property is not an\n\n\"application for a permit\" under RCW 64.40.020(1).

Until that time, its constitutionally protected property\n\ninterest was under existing FR-20 zoning for which no violation is claimed and nothing\n\nwas lost. Manna cites no authority that there is a federally protected property interest\n\nunder § 1983 in obtaining a decision on a mere application to rezone (\"upzone\") property.\n\nMoreover, the County promptly issued the rezone ordinance within two weeks of the trial\n\ncourt's order.\n\n       Accordingly, we uphold the trial court's summary judgment dismissal of Manna's\n\n§ 1983 claim on the basis there is no evidence that the County deprived Manna of a\n\nfederally protected property right. Manna's failure of proof on this essential element\n\nrenders immaterial the facts relating to ripeness issues and to Manna's claim that the\n\nBoard denied it substantive due process by acting in arbitrary or invidious and irrational\n\nfashion in passing on its rezone application.

Thus, no agreement or business\n\nrelationship was terminated or severed because of the Board's denial of the rezone. Ms.\n\nDoty also said that although Manna had stayed in touch with some potential investors and\n\ndevelopers prior to the rezone denial, nothing occurred with respect to the property after\n\nthe rezone was approved. Manna had not applied for a subdivision of its property into\n\nthree-acre lots, nor did it apply for any building or development permits on the property.\n\nManna provided no contrary evidence in its response to the County's summary judgment\n\nmotion.\n\n       Thus, as argued by the County, Manna failed to produce evidence of the first two\n\nelements-existence (and knowledge by the County) of a valid contractual relationship or\n\nbusiness expectancy with which the County could interfere or delay. This renders all\n\nother facts immaterial with respect to the additional elements requiring the County's\n\nintentional interference, improper purpose or improper means. and proximate causation of\n\n\n                                             24 \n\n\fNo.30539-2-II1\nManna Funding v. Kittitas County\n\n\ndamages (of which Manna shows none in any event). Young, 112 Wn.2d at 225; Boyce,\n\n71 Wn. App. at 665.\n\n      The case Manna primarily relies on, Pleas v. City ofSeattle, is distinguishable.\n\nThere, the City was held liable for intentional interference with developer Parkridge's\n\nbusiness expectancy because it acted with an improper purpose (political motives and\n\nfavoritism to a neighborhood group)~ and by improper means (arbitrary delay) in refusing\n\nto grant necessary environmental and building permits for a high-rise apartment project\n\nthat was allowed under existing zoning regulations. Pleas, 112 Wn.2d at 796. Part of the\n\ndelay was also attributable to the city council granting an opposing neighborhood group's\n\n\"downzone\" application (filed after Parkridge applied for permits) that the court ruled\n\nwas \"unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious and therefore void.\" Id. at 797. Due to the\n\ndelays, Parkridge incurred ascertainable damages for lost profits, Joss of favorable\n\nfinancing, increased construction costs due to inflation, and the costs of an environmental\n\nimpact statement discarded by the City. Jd. at 799.\n\n       Here, in contrast to Pleas where the developer applied for specific project permits\n\nallowed under existing zoning, Manna only applied for a rezone to possibly facilitate\n\nfuture, but unspecified, development plans. Unlike the developer in Pleas who incurred\n\nactual damages, Manna did not identify any business expectancy of pecuniary value-no\n\n\n                                            25 \n\n\fNo. 30539-2-III\nManna Funding v. Kittitas County\n\n\nbusiness relationship, contract, or development project. All the County knew was that\n\nManna wanted it to approve a rezone. On these facts, only after Manna received its R-3\n\nrezone in February 2009 could it stand in similar shoes to the developer in Pleas. But the\n\nBoard acted expeditiously-within two weeks of the court's order-to enact the\n\nordinance granting Manna's rezone. Since there was no identified contract, permit, or\n\ncontemplated development activity (either pre- or post-ordinance), the County did nothing\n\nto interfere with or delay any business expectancy.\n\n       Manna's other cited interference with a business expectancy cases are likewise\n\ndistinguishable because they involved delay of identified projects. Westmark Dev. Corp.,\n\n140 Wn. App. at 558-63 (city interfered with business expectancy by acting with\n\nimproper purpose in singling out developer's apartment project and using improper means\n\nby unreasonably delaying original permit decision); City ofSeattle v. Blume, 134 Wn.2d\n\n243,947 P.2d 223 (1997) (city delayed processing of developer's master use permit for\n\noffice building/research facility designed in accord with current zoning regulations). Two\n\nother cases cited by Manna are inapposite because they are not interference with\n\nbusiness expectancy cases. Wilson, 122 Wn.2d at 823 (claim under RCW 64.40.020):\n\nCal([as v.

The County's lawyer did not attempt\n\nto segregate fees attributable solely to the RCW 64.40.020 claim. Manna argued that the\n\nCounty was required to do so and that any fee award must be limited to those the County\n\ncould actually demonstrate were related to the RCW 64.40.020 claim. The County's\n\nlav.ryer disagreed but suggested if fee segregation were appropriate, perhaps 10 percent to\n\n20 percent of the time billed would fall outside of the RCW 64.40.020 claim.\n\n       The trial court's order awarding attorney fees states in its entirety: \n\n\n       Kittitas County, as the prevailing party under RCW 64.40.020, is awarded \n\n       judgment for $21,496.50 in attorney fees.
