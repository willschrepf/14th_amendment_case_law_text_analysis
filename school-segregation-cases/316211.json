We address Defendants’ other claims of error in a\ncontemporaneously filed Memorandum Disposition. We\naffirm.\n\n     FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\nI.   Lunde Electric Company Pension Plan\n\n  Until 2005, when it ceased operations, Lunde Electric\nCompany (Lunde Electric or the Company) of Seattle, Wash-\nington, was in the business of maritime electrical repair. Sig-\nmund Eriksen (Sigmund) served as Lunde Electric’s\nChairman, and his son Raymond Eriksen (Raymond) was\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer.\n\n   Sigmund purchased Lunde Electric in 1975. In 1979, the\nCompany established the Lunde Electric Co., Inc., Profit\nSharing Plan (the Plan) to provide retirement benefits for its\nunion employees. Sigmund and Raymond served as the Plan’s\ntrustees. Initially, Lunde Electric was the sole financial con-\ntributor to the Plan, and the Plan’s assets were held in a bro-\nkerage account at a local bank (the Plan Account). From 1979\nuntil the mid-1990s, Earl Sommerfeld served as the Plan’s\nbookkeeper. In 1999, Earl’s son, Brad Sommerfeld, assumed\nthose responsibilities.\n\n   The Plan was amended in 1984 and 1991 (the 1991 Plan).\nThe government and Defendants sharply disagree as to\nwhether the Plan was subsequently amended. According to\nthe government, the Plan was again amended in 1995 and\nthen restated in 2002. Defendants contend that there is no evi-\ndence of either event.\n\f                   UNITED STATES v. ERIKSEN                3303\n  A.   The 1995 Amendment and 2002 Restatement\n\n   According to the government, Article IV of the Plan, titled\n“Contribution and Allocation,” was amended in 1995 to add\na 401(k) feature (the 1995 Amendment). The 1995 Amend-\nment replaced contributions made exclusively by the Com-\npany with a system whereby Plan investors—called\n“Participants”—contributed a percentage of their paychecks\n—called “elective deferrals”—into the Plan. Lunde would\nthen “match” fifty percent of each Participant’s elective defer-\nral with an employer contribution. Funds in the Plan Account\nwere pooled and administered by the Eriksens.\n\n   According to the government, when the Eriksens added the\n401(k) feature, they did not redraft the 1991 Plan; instead,\nonly Article IV of the 1991 Plan was amended. As evidence\nof this change, the government introduced two versions of the\n1991 Plan. In the first version, which the government prof-\nfered as the original 1991 Plan, Article IV refers only to dis-\ncretionary “Employer’s Contribution[s]”: “For each Plan\nYear, the Employer shall contribute to the Plan such amount\nas shall be determined by the Employer.” However, in the\nsecond document, Article IV sets forth procedures for a “Par-\nticipant’s Salary Reduction Election.” Article 4.2 of that doc-\nument provides, inter alia, that “[e]ach Participant may elect\nto defer his Compensation which would have been received\nin the Plan Year, but for the deferral election, by up to 10\n[percent].” In addition to the documentary evidence, the gov-\nernment presented testimony that the Plan was amended in\n1995. For instance, the Plan’s stockbroker testified that new\n“trust certification papers” were filed with the Plan’s broker-\nage firm in 1995.\n\n   On January 1, 2002, the Plan was restated and a new docu-\nment titled “Lunde Electric Company, Inc. 401(k) Profit Shar-\ning Plan” became operative (the 2002 Restatement). Although\nthe date of the Plan’s effectiveness was not written in one\nspace provided in the document, several documents signed\n\f3304              UNITED STATES v. ERIKSEN\nand dated by Sigmund and Raymond contained information\nabout the 2002 Restatement’s effective date. These included\na “Consent to Corporate Authorization,” which “RESOLVED\nthat the form amended 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan and Trust\neffective January 1, 2002, presented to this meeting is hereby\napproved and adopted.” Additionally, the 2002 Restatement\nincluded a “Supplemental Participation Agreement” dated\nJanuary 1, 2002, and signed by Raymond as “Participating\nEmployer” and by both Raymond and Sigmund as Trustees.\nThis document also referred to a 401(k) plan.\n\n  B.   Missing Remittances to the Plan Account\n\n   In 1999, Lunde Electric began experiencing financial diffi-\nculties and was unable to pay its operating expenses with rev-\nenues. The government alleged that, as a result of these\nfinancial problems, the Eriksens caused the Company to stop\nremitting elective deferrals to the Plan.\n\n   Brad Sommerfeld regularly reviewed the Trust’s brokerage\nstatements as part of his responsibilities as Plan accountant.\nThose statements reflected deposits into and withdrawals\nfrom the Plan Account. Sommerfeld noticed that regular\ndeposits into the Plan Account were no longer made after\nOctober 1999. Indeed, the only deposit made to the Plan\nAccount for the 2000 Plan Year was for $10,000, on Decem-\nber 27, 2000. Although money continued to be withheld from\nParticipants’ paychecks, no deposits were made into the Plan\nAccount in 2001, in 2002, or from January through March\n2003.\n\n   From 1999 to 2002, Lunde Electric employed three differ-\nent bookkeepers—Cynthia Halcomb (mid-1990s to 1999),\nBrad Mansker (May 2000 to December 2000), and Toni Wun-\nsch (December 2000 to 2003). Both Halcomb and Mansker\ntestified that they would meet with the Eriksens on a regular\nbasis to decide which bills to pay. According to Mansker,\nwithin a few months of his starting work at the Company, he\n\f                    UNITED STATES v. ERIKSEN                  3305\nlearned that elective deferrals were not being remitted to the\nPlan. Mansker testified that he raised the issue of the out-\nstanding liability on several occasions, but that the Eriksens\ndid not direct the Company to make payments to the Plan dur-\ning his tenure. Moreover, starting in 1999, employees’ elec-\ntive deferrals were shown as “Receivables” on the Plan’s\nbalance sheet and reflected as a liability on Lunde Electric’s\nbooks. From 1999 to December 2002, the Plan Account’s\nReceivables grew from $35,156.62 to $97,374.68. By 2003,\nthe Receivables had increased to $103,606; from 1999 to\n2003, the Receivables ballooned from 1.47 % of the Plan’s\nassets to 15.01%.\n\n   On December 5, 2001, the Eriksens participated in a con-\nference call with attorney Ronald Braley. Defendants asked\nBraley about the consequences of not funding 401(k) trust\naccounts. Braley informed the Eriksens that they could be per-\nsonally liable as fiduciaries and, in his own words, informed\nthem “that while the Department of Labor usually does not\ntake a keen interest in plans with fewer than 100, if an\nemployee knew about it and complained to the Department of\nLabor, that an investigation may open up and they would have\na more serious issue.” During the conference call, Braley\nemphasized that the Eriksens had to pay the unfunded liability\n“as soon as possible.” Thereafter, Braley memorialized the\nconversation in an email he transmitted to the Eriksens. That\nemail reads, in part: “Apparently, for the past year and one\nhalf, they have failed to contribute to the 401(k) . . . Plan after\ntaking elective deferrals from employees.”\n\n  On May 2, 2002, Brad Sommerfeld wrote to bookkeeper\nToni Wunsch concerning the Company’s accounting:\n\n    As you know the Company is significantly behind in\n    depositing its 401K contributions. This is a huge\n    problem because most of the money comes from\n    employees’ paychecks and the Officers of the Com-\n    pany and Trustees of the Plan have a fiduciary\n\f3306               UNITED STATES v. ERIKSEN\n    responsibility to deposit these funds timely (deposits\n    are due monthly). This is possibly the worst liability\n    to fall behind on in terms of legal and tax problems.\n\nSommerfeld testified that he also had a conversation with Sig-\nmund about the Plan’s delinquency and that Sigmund stated,\n“We’re doing the best we can.”\n\n  C.   Lunde Electric’s Tax Filings\n\n   After 1995, Lunde Electric began providing yearly “Partici-\npant’s Valuation Reports” to employees enrolled in the 401(k)\nPlan. These reports purported to show each Participant’s\nassets in the Plan and contributions made for the prior Plan\nYear. The Valuation Reports were prepared by Brad Sommer-\nfeld and signed by Raymond. Until 1999, a Statement of Net\nAssets, which detailed the total Plan assets, was also delivered\nto each Participant. After the 1999 Plan Year, Lunde Electric\nceased providing Statements of Net Assets when it delivered\ncopies of Valuation Reports to Participants. Nevertheless,\nSommerfeld continued to prepare Statements of Net Assets\nfor those years, which he provided to the Eriksens.\n\n   Lunde Electric filed certain documents with the Internal\nRevenue Service (IRS), including a Form 5500, in connection\nwith its operation of the Plan. Form 5500, titled, “Annual\nReturn/Report of Employee Benefit Plan,” details contribu-\ntions made to an ERISA fund. Brad Sommerfeld prepared the\nForm 5500 each year, and either Raymond or Sigmund, as\nPlan administrators, signed the document before submitting it\nto the IRS.\n\n   Among other questions, Form 5500 asks: “Was there a fail-\nure to transmit to the plan any participant contributions within\nthe time period described in 29 [Code of Federal Regulations\n(C.F.R.)] 2510.3-102?” The reference to the Code of Federal\nRegulations is to an ERISA regulation titled “Definition of\n\f                   UNITED STATES v. ERIKSEN                    3307\n‘plan assets’—participant contributions” (the Plan Asset Reg-\nulation), which provides:\n\n    (a)(1) General rule. For purposes of subtitle A and\n    parts 1 and 4 of subtitle B of title I of ERISA and\n    section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code only (but\n    without any implication for and may not be relied\n    upon to bar criminal prosecutions under 18 U.S.C.\n    664), the assets of the plan include amounts (other\n    than union dues) that a participant or beneficiary\n    pays to an employer, or amounts that a participant\n    has withheld from his wages by an employer, for\n    contribution or repayment of a participant loan to the\n    plan, as of the earliest date on which such contribu-\n    tions or repayments can reasonably be segregated\n    from the employer’s general assets.\n\n    ....\n\n    (b) Maximum time period for pension benefit plans.\n\n    (1) . . . [I]n no event shall the date determined pursu-\n    ant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section occur later\n    than the 15th business day of the month following\n    the month in which the participant contribution or\n    participant loan repayment amounts are received by\n    the employer (in the case of amounts that a partici-\n    pant or beneficiary pays to an employer) or the 15th\n    business day of the month following the month in\n    which such amounts would otherwise have been\n    payable to the participant in cash (in the case of\n    amounts withheld by an employer from a partici-\n    pant’s wages).\n\n29 C.F.R. § 2510.3-102(a)(1), (b)(1). For the 1999, 2000, and\n2001 tax years, the Form 5500s filed by Lunde Electric indi-\ncated that all Participant contributions had been transmitted.\n\f3308                UNITED STATES v. ERIKSEN\nSommerfeld testified that this was not true and that he had fal-\nsified the three forms because:\n\n      The answer yes is a flag to the Internal Revenue Ser-\n      vice that the plan is delinquent or behind on their\n      contributions. And that may—or would result in\n      either an IRS audit or a Department of Labor investi-\n      gation. And I was afraid that I would be blamed for\n      blowing the whistle or causing either one of those\n      actions to take place and cause harm to the company.\n\n  D.    Department of Labor Investigation and Indictment\n\n   In early 2003, bookkeeper Wunsch discussed her concerns\nabout the 401(k) Plan with the Eriksens. Thereafter, Wunsch\ncontacted the Department of Labor (DOL) and met with an\ninvestigator. In March 2003, the DOL issued a grand jury sub-\npoena to Lunde Electric. After the April 2003 subpoena was\nserved, Lunde Electric resumed remitting elective deferrals to\nthe Plan. By October 2004, Lunde Electric had lowered its\noutstanding obligations to the Plan from approximately\n$105,000 to $1,000. When Lunde Electric ceased operations\nin April 2005, all Plan Participants received their full 401(k)\ndistribution.\n\n   In 2008, based on the events detailed supra, Sigmund and\nRaymond were indicted on one count of Conspiracy to\nEmbezzle $70,120.55 from an ERISA Employee Plan, in vio-\nlation of 18 U.S.C. § 371 (Count 1); seventeen counts of\nEmbezzlement or Conversion from an ERISA Employee Ben-\nefit Plan, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 664 and 2 (Counts 2-\n18), and three counts of Making False or Misleading State-\nments in an ERISA Benefit Plan Document that Federal Law\nRequires to be Kept, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1027 and 2\n(Counts 19-21).\n\nII.    Trial and Sentencing\n\n  The Eriksens’ jury trial commenced on October 5, 2009.\nRaymond testified that he did not play a role in preparing any\n\f                   UNITED STATES v. ERIKSEN               3309\nof the Plan’s documents and that he did not remember signing\nthe 1995 Amendment establishing the 401(k). According to\nRaymond, neither he nor Sigmund was involved in the prepa-\nration or review of the Valuation Reports, the Form 5500s, or\nthe Plan’s Statements of Net Assets. Raymond testified that\nhe was unaware that employee elective deferrals were not\nbeing forwarded to the Plan Account in 1999, 2000, and 2001.\nHowever, Raymond acknowledged making personal contribu-\ntions to the 401(k) starting in October 1999.\n\n   At trial, the Eriksens presented the testimony of William\nWhitman, an expert witness on ERISA issues. Although\nWhitman testified that there are no “hard deadlines” for when\nan employer must contribute the employer portion of a 401(k)\nplan, he did not testify about when an employer must remit\nemployee contributions. According to Whitman, an amend-\nment to an ERISA plan must be “in writing” and executed by\na corporate officer and the plan’s trustees.\n\n   The jury returned identical verdicts for both Defendants,\nconvicting them on Counts 17 and 18, for failing to remit\nelective deferrals from December 2002 and March 2003 pay-\nchecks. The jury also convicted Defendants on Count 21,\nwhich concerned making a false statement in the 2001 Valua-\ntion Report. The jury deadlocked on Counts 9 through 16 and\n20 and acquitted Defendants on Counts 1 through 8 and 19.\nDefendants moved for judgments of acquittal, which the dis-\ntrict court denied in an order dated November 4, 2009.\n\n   The district court sentenced both Defendants to two years\nof probation, a $20,000 fine, 240 hours of community service,\nand the mandatory special assessment of $300. Defendants\ntimely appeal.\n\n                       DISCUSSION\n\n  Defendants seek to overturn the jury’s verdict on the\ngrounds that there was insufficient evidence of criminal intent\n\f3310                UNITED STATES v. ERIKSEN\nor that Lunde Electric established the 401(k) Plan, and that\nthe government improperly referred to the Plan Asset Regula-\ntion at trial. We are not persuaded.\n\nI.    Embezzlement or Conversion of the Elective Deferrals\n\n     A.   Scope of the Offense\n\n  [1] Defendants were convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 664 for\nembezzling or converting the Plan’s assets in December 2002\nand March 2003. Section 664 provides:\n\n      Any person who embezzles, steals, or unlawfully\n      and willfully abstracts or converts to his own use or\n      to the use of another, any of the moneys, funds,\n      securities, premiums, credits, property, or other\n      assets of any employee welfare benefit plan or\n      employee pension benefit plan, or of any fund con-\n      nected therewith, shall be fined under this title, or\n      imprisoned not more than five years, or both.\n\n      As used in this section, the term “any employee wel-\n      fare benefit plan or employee pension benefit plan”\n      means any employee benefit plan subject to any pro-\n      vision of title I of the Employee Retirement Income\n      Security Act of 1974.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 664. We have held that the operative terms “em-\nbezzles” and “converts” are to be given their common-law\nmeanings. United States v. Andreen, 628 F.2d 1236, 1241 (9th\nCir. 1980); Woxberg v. United States, 329 F.2d 284, 290 (9th\nCir. 1964). Thus, “[e]mbezzlement is the fraudulent appropri-\nation of property by a person to whom such property has been\nentrusted, or into whose hands it has lawfully come.” Wox-\nberg, 329 F.2d at 290; see also Andreen, 628 F.2d at 1241\n(citing United States v. Dupee, 569 F.2d 1061, 1064 (9th Cir.\n1978)). Conversion “encompasses the use of property, placed\nin one’s custody for a limited purpose, in an unauthorized\n\f                   UNITED STATES v. ERIKSEN                  3311\nmanner or to an unauthorized extent.” Andreen, 628 F.2d at\n1241 (citing Morissette v. United States, 342 U.S. 246, 272\n(1952)).\n\n   We have also recognized that § 664 does more than recapit-\nulate common-law offenses. Because § 664 and other\npension-protection laws, see, e.g., 29 U.S.C. § 501(c) (prohib-\niting embezzlement from a labor organization fund), are\naimed at “preserv[ing] welfare and pension funds for the pro-\ntection of those entitled to their benefits,” we have held that\n§ 664 imposes liability for a broad class of “unauthorized”\nacts willfully committed by those in a fiduciary or advisory\ncapacity. See Andreen, 628 F.2d at 1241, 1242 (examining the\nlegislative history of 29 U.S.C. § 501, 18 U.S.C. § 664). As\nthen-Judge Kennedy explained:\n\n    The essence of the crime is theft and in the context\n    of union funds or pension plans the offense includes\n    a taking or appropriation that is unauthorized, if\n    accomplished with specific criminal intent. In this\n    respect lack of authorization may be shown if the\n    diversion is substantially inconsistent with the fidu-\n    ciary purposes and objectives of the union funds or\n    pension plan, as set forth by statutes, bylaws, char-\n    ters, or trust documents which govern uses of the\n    funds in question. Whatever imprecision attends this\n    definition is remedied substantially by the require-\n    ment of scienter, which is an essential element of the\n    crime. The act to be criminal must be willful, which\n    means an act done with a fraudulent intent or a bad\n    purpose or an evil motive.\n\nId. at 1241 (emphasis added) (citation omitted).\n\n   [2] We have consistently declined invitations to engraft\nadditional elements onto, or create affirmative defenses for,\n§ 664 violations. In Andreen, we rejected the “participant ben-\nefit” theory by holding that so long as a fiduciary used plan\n\f3312               UNITED STATES v. ERIKSEN\nassets in an unauthorized manner, the “lack of benefit to the\n[plan beneficiaries] is not an element of the offense required\nto be shown as part of the prosecution’s case.” Id. at 1242.\nLikewise, “the conferring of any benefit in such a case is not\na defense, except insofar as it may bear upon the defendant’s\nstate of mind in committing the acts in question.” Id. at\n1242-43. We thus rejected the appeal of an attorney who had\nassisted the trustees of a pension plan in drafting an unautho-\nrized compensation plan that rewarded the trustees for merely\nexecuting their fiduciary duties. Id. at 1245-46. We reasoned\nthat the attorney’s attendance at trustee meetings where the\ncompensation plan was discussed, coupled with his knowl-\nedge that the “plan was unauthorized,” was sufficient to show\nthat he aided and abetted a violation of § 664. Id. at 1246.\n\n   In United States v. Ford, a companion case to Andreen, we\naffirmed the convictions of the trustees whom Andreen had\nassisted. 632 F.2d 1354 (9th Cir. 1980), overruled on other\ngrounds, as recognized in United States v. Miller, 874 F.2d\n1255, 1268 (9th Cir. 1989). In reviewing a sufficiency-of-the-\nevidence challenge, we highlighted repeatedly certain circum-\nstantial facts that showed the trustees’ awareness that their\nbehavior was not authorized by the trusts’ beneficiaries—\nprimarily that the trustees were offering themselves benefits\nfrom the trust at a lower cost than was available to beneficia-\nries. Id. at 1366, 1367 n.12, 1368.\n\n   In two related appeals, United States v. Mett, 178 F.3d 1058\n(9th Cir. 1999), and United States v. Wiseman, 274 F.3d 1235\n(9th Cir. 2001), we again disavowed a participant-benefit\ndefense and further held that ERISA-plan fiduciaries could\nnot be implicitly authorized to use assets in a manner that\njeopardizes their availability for the beneficiaries. Mett, 178\nF.3d at 1067-68. Mett and Wiseman were separate appeals of\nthe same underlying prosecution against two executives of an\nart gallery who withdrew $1.6 million from a pension plan to\nfinance their floundering enterprise. Id. at 1060-61. Mett, the\ngallery’s president, and Wiseman, the vice-president, served\n\f                    UNITED STATES v. ERIKSEN                  3313\nas the trustees of two pension benefit plans. Id. at 1060. After\nbeing indicted for felony art fraud, their gallery “fell on hard\ntimes,” and the trustees withdrew money from pension plans\nand deposited it into the company’s general operating account\nwithout informing the employees-beneficiaries. Id. at\n1060-61. While Mett and Wiseman admitted making the with-\ndrawals, they sought to avoid liability by characterizing their\nappropriations as implicitly authorized “loans” necessary for\nthe business to survive. Id. at 1060. This implied authorization\nwas founded on the premise that, because the gallery would\nhave had to be closed and the employee-beneficiaries “would\notherwise have been laid off and faced with unemployment,”\nid., the acts were not criminal.\n\n   We rejected the “implied authorization” defense based on\na fiduciary’s purported intention to serve the “broader” inter-\nests of employee welfare. Id. at 1067. Because ERISA funds\nare protected so that they will be “available at retirement”—\nand are therefore subject to numerous non-alienation\nrestrictions—we observed that an “authorization” argument\nwas illogical. After all, if the beneficiaries themselves are not\nat liberty to dispose of the funds for a purpose other than\nretirement, they could not lawfully authorize someone else to\ndo it for them. Id. at 1068 (“[I]t is little different from arguing\nthat complete strangers ‘authorized’ the illicit transactions.”).\n\n   [3] Following retrial in light of other errors, the Mett\ndefendants returned to us in United States v. Wiseman, claim-\ning that the district court had committed new errors by not\ngiving a mistake-of-law instruction or an instruction that the\ngovernment had to show the defendants were not “borrowing”\nfrom the pension. 274 F.3d at 1241. We rejected both conten-\ntions. With respect to the mistake-of-law argument, we held\nthat, although “ ‘the defendant must knowingly act wrong-\nfully to deprive another of property,’ there is no requirement\nthat the defendant also know his conduct was illegal.” Id. at\n1240 (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted). We\nlikewise rejected the gallery executives’ “borrowing”-from-\n\f3314                UNITED STATES v. ERIKSEN\nthe-pension-fund defense. Id. at 1241. We stated that evidence\nof borrowing, or for that matter evidence of intent to repay,\nis relevant to criminal intent, but that “[i]ntent to repay gener-\nally is not a defense to embezzlement . . . [or] conversion.”\nId. (citing United States v. Ross, 206 F.3d 896, 899 (9th Cir.\n2000)); see also United States v. Thordarson, 646 F.2d 1323,\n1335 n.22 (9th Cir. 1981).\n\n  B.   Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n   The jury convicted Defendants of two § 664 crimes: Counts\n17 and 18. Count 17 concerned $1,192.40 of employee elec-\ntive deferrals withheld in December 2002. Count 18 involved\n$1,000.40 in deferrals from March 2003. The district court\ngave the same jury instruction for both of these counts, requir-\ning proof beyond a reasonable doubt that:\n\n    First, the Lunde Electric Company 401(k) Plan was\n    established or maintained as an employee pension\n    benefit plan subject to Title I of the [ERISA]; and\n\n    Second, the defendant either:\n\n         (a) embezzled or stole funds of the plan; or\n\n         (b) unlawfully and willfully abstracted or\n         converted funds of the plan to his own use\n         or the use of another[.]\n\nThe district court defined “embezzled,” “stole,” “converted,”\nand “abstracted.”\n\n   Defendants contend that there was insufficient evidence to\nsupport these elements. “Evidence is sufficient for conviction\nif, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the\nprosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the\nessential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.”\n\f                   UNITED STATES v. ERIKSEN                 3315\nUnited States v. Bush, 626 F.3d 527, 533 (9th Cir. 2010)\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n   In a mid-trial motion for a directed verdict, Defendants\nasserted that the government had not established the existence\nof the Plan and thus claimed that any deferrals withheld were\nactually discretionary employer contributions. This argument\nwas not renewed in Defendants’ post-trial Fed. R. Crim. P. 29\nmotion. Defendants also assert that the failure to remit elec-\ntive deferrals within the time frame established by the DOL’s\nPlan Asset Regulation, 29 C.F.R. § 2510.3-102(b)(1), is not\ntantamount to embezzlement or conversion and that the gov-\nernment’s references to the Plan Asset Regulation were preju-\ndicial. Because Defendants’ Rule 29 motion regarding Counts\n17 and 18 was limited to an argument about mens rea, our\nreview is for plain error. United States v. Alvarez-Valenzuela,\n231 F.3d 1198, 1200-01 (9th Cir. 2000) (“[W]e interpret Rule\n29(a) to suggest that failure to renew the motion at the end of\ntrial does not mean that it has been waived, but only that a\nhigher standard of review is to be imposed. [We] may review\nan unrenewed motion for judgment of acquittal, but only to\nprevent a manifest miscarriage of justice, or for plain error.”).\n\n    1.   Establishment of the Lunde Electric 401(k) Plan\n\n   Defendants assert that there was insufficient proof that the\nPlan contained a 401(k) feature. They argue that all ERISA\nplans contain an amendment procedure and that “[t]hese . . .\nprocedures, once set forth in a benefit plan, constrain the\nemployer from amending the plan by other means.” Winter-\nrowd v. Am. Gen. Annuity Ins. Co., 321 F.3d 933, 937 (9th\nCir. 2003) (citing Curtiss-Wright Corp. v. Schoonejongen,\n514 U.S. 73, 85 (1995)). According to Defendants’ theory, the\ngovernment had to introduce a properly executed version of\nthe 1995 Amendment. Because the government does not have\nsuch a document, Defendants argue, the elective deferrals\nwere actually discretionary “employer contributions” that do\nnot become “Plan Assets” until they are remitted to the Plan.\n\f3316               UNITED STATES v. ERIKSEN\n   Defendants’ argument regarding the validity of the 1995\nAmendment is a red herring. Defendants were convicted only\nfor their failure to remit deferrals after the 2002 Restatement.\nEven though the Form 5500s submitted to the IRS by Lunde\nElectric, the testimony of Brad Sommerfeld, and the email by\nattorney Braley all indicated that the 401(k) Plan existed\nbefore 2002, because Counts 17 and 18 concerned conduct\nthat occurred after the 2002 Plan Restatement, we need only\nconsider that document. The Eriksens do not dispute that the\n1991 Plan was governed by Title I of ERISA, but contend that\nthe evidence did not allow the conclusion that the Plan was\nthereafter amended or restated.\n\n   [4] “Generally, whether a plan is subject to Title I of\nERISA is an issue of fact to be decided by the jury, guided\nby applicable legal principles.” United States v. Wofford, 560\nF.3d 341, 347 (5th Cir. 2009) (citing United States v. Hel-\nbling, 209 F.3d 226, 239 (3d Cir. 2000)). The amendment\nprocedures for any ERISA benefit plan must be specified by\nthe employer and identify the persons with the “authority to\namend.” Winterrowd, 321 F.3d at 937 (citing 29 U.S.C.\n§ 1102(b)(3)). Here, the 1991 Plan, at Section 10.6, specified\nthat amending the Plan “shall only be by the written action of\neach and every Participating Employer and with the consent\nof the Trustee where such consent is necessary.” To show\nsuch an amendment occurred by at least 2002, the government\nintroduced a written copy of the 2002 Restatement, which\nincluded a 401(k) provision and was signed by Raymond as\n“Employer” and “Trustee” and by Sigmund as “Trustee.” The\ngovernment also introduced addenda referring to the effective\ndate of the Restatement as January 1, 2002, as well as a “Con-\nsent to Corporate Action” by Lunde Electric that approved the\n“amended 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan . . . effective January 1,\n2002.” Any of these documents alone was competent evi-\ndence to allow the jury to conclude that the Plan had been\nrestated in 2002 with a 401(k) plan. Accordingly, there was\nsufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that the 1991 Plan\n\f                   UNITED STATES v. ERIKSEN                 3317\nhad been restated before the Eriksens retained their employ-\nees’ elective deferrals in the Company’s general account.\n\n    2.   Embezzlement, Conversion, or Unauthorized Use\n         of Funds\n\n   The second element of § 664 requires the jury to find that\na defendant willfully embezzled, converted, or misappropri-\nated the funds of a pension plan. Andreen, 628 F.2d at 1241.\nDefendants concede that the funds were not remitted to the\nPlan Account before the DOL investigation. However, they\ncontend that their keeping elective deferrals for longer than\nfifteen days—a deadline specified in the Plan Asset\nRegulation—is not tantamount to embezzlement or conver-\nsion. According to Defendants, the government, by referenc-\ning the Plan Asset Regulation, misled the jury into concluding\notherwise. In support of their argument, Defendants ask us to\nconsider the holdings of United States v. Christo, 614 F.2d\n486 (5th Cir. 1980), and United States v. Wolf, 820 F.2d 1499\n(9th Cir. 1987).\n\n  Although both Christo and Wolf address the dangers of\n“bootstrapping” a civil violation into a criminal one, neither\ncase concerns § 664 crimes, nor do their holdings apply here.\nBoth Christo and Wolf concerned prosecutions against bank\nexecutives for misapplication of bank funds, in violation of 18\nU.S.C. § 656. Wolf, 820 F.2d at 1501; Christo, 614 F.2d at\n489.\n\n   In Christo, the misapplication charge was based on a bank\nofficer’s repeatedly overdrawing his checking account. At the\ntime, 12 U.S.C. § 375a prohibited a bank from extending a\nloan of more than $5,000 to one of its officers. Christo, 614\nF.2d at 488 n.2, 490. The trial court quoted § 375a to the jury\nand further instructed the jury that it could consider violations\nof § 375a in connection with the criminal misapplication\ncharges. Id. at 491. The Fifth Circuit reversed the defendant’s\nmisapplication conviction, observing:\n\f3318               UNITED STATES v. ERIKSEN\n    A conviction, resulting from the government’s\n    attempt to bootstrap a series of checking account\n    overdrafts, a civil regulatory violation, into an equal\n    amount of misapplication felonies, cannot be\n    allowed to stand. The government’s evidence and\n    argument concerning violations of § 375a imper-\n    missibly infected the very purpose for which the trial\n    was being conducted . . . .\n\nId. at 492.\n\n   In Wolf, we relied on Christo to reverse convictions against\na bank executive for misapplying bank funds and making\nfalse entries in a bank record. The executive had, among other\nacts, failed to disclose required information about the benefi-\nciaries of his bank loans. Wolf, 820 F.2d at 1503. We faulted\nthe government for basing its misapplication charges on a\ncivil banking regulation that imposes a duty on bank employ-\nees to inform the bank’s board of directors about the purpose\nof a loan. During Wolf’s trial, the government’s expert wit-\nness testified that the defendant’s failure to disclose he was a\nbeneficiary of some of the loans he disbursed violated Federal\nReserve Regulation O (12 C.F.R. § 215). We held that the ref-\nerences to the Regulation were impermissible:\n\n    Unlike references to [other civil violations which\n    occurred during the trial], the references to Regula-\n    tion O cannot be dismissed as being simply back-\n    ground information. The references were a key part\n    of the government’s case on the misapplication and\n    false entry counts. . . .\n\n       To supply the missing element of the false entry\n    and misapplication charges, the government turned\n    to Regulation O. Through its expert witness the gov-\n    ernment established that Regulation O imposed a\n    duty on [the defendant] to inform the bank’s direc-\n    tors that he had an interest in the loans . . . . In sum,\n\f                    UNITED STATES v. ERIKSEN                 3319\n    the government used Regulation O to supply a cru-\n    cial element of the misapplication and false entry\n    charges.\n\nId. at 1505 (emphasis added). Thus, under the logic of Christo\nand Wolf, it is impermissible to use the violation of a civil\nstatute to ipso facto “supply a crucial element” of a criminal\noffense.\n\n   [5] Contrary to Christo and Wolf, the Plan Asset Regula-\ntion played an inconsequential or, more likely, no role in\nDefendants’ convictions. Importantly, the Plan Asset Regula-\ntion does not create a reporting or other affirmative obligation\non an employer nor does it prohibit certain behaviors under\nthreat of civil sanction; rather, the regulation simply defines\n“plan asset”: “the assets of the plan include amounts . . . that\na participant or beneficiary pays to an employer.” 29 C.F.R.\n§ 2510.3-102(a)(1) (emphasis added). While one could selec-\ntively excerpt and rewrite portions of the regulation to create\nthe appearance that it requires employers to remit their elec-\ntive deferrals, the regulation does not create any such obliga-\ntion. Indeed, the obligation not to use other people’s money\nfor purposes they have not authorized is traceable more fairly\nto antiquity than to the Plan Asset Regulation. Thus, contrary\nto the facts in Wolf, none of the elements of Counts 17 or 18\nwas established at trial, or could be established, by bootstrap-\nping a violation of the regulation. Unlike in Christo, the regu-\nlation did not mislead the jury in its deliberations, as it was\nnot even a factor for the jurors’ consideration.\n\n   [6] The government did not contend that it was Defen-\ndants’ failure to remit deferrals within fifteen days that consti-\ntuted their crime. Rather, it was the fact that employee\ncontributions were never remitted from January 1, 2002, until\nthe DOL became involved, but were, instead, used to pay\nbusiness expenses, as recounted by Brad Sommerfeld and oth-\ners, that formed the factual and legal basis for the govern-\nment’s case. Conversion is a simple offense that\n\f3320               UNITED STATES v. ERIKSEN\n“encompasses the use of property, placed in one’s custody for\na limited purpose, in an unauthorized manner or to an unau-\nthorized extent.” Andreen, 628 F.2d at 1241. When Defen-\ndants commingled their employees’ contributions with the\nCompany’s assets to prop up their failing business, they inten-\ntionally used their employee’s assets for an unauthorized pur-\npose. Moreover, they sent Participants account statements\nshowing 401(k) balances which were, in fact, non-existent.\nDefendants’ acts were “substantially inconsistent with the\nfiduciary purposes and objectives of the union funds or pen-\nsion plan, as set forth by statutes, bylaws, charters, or trust\ndocuments which govern uses of the funds in question.” Id.\nAs fiduciaries of the money given to them by their employees,\nDefendants were entrusted with custody of their employees’\nmoney for the sole purpose of remitting it to the 401(k) Plan;\nthe Defendants’ decision to deviate, be it to bet on horse races\nor pay other bills, is the wilful criminal misappropriation pun-\nished by § 664.\n\n   [7] Finally, Defendants’ argument regarding the absence of\nintent is undercut by the evidence that both Defendants were\nalerted repeatedly about their obligation to remit the deferrals.\nMoreover, the government showed that Defendants hid their\nactions from employees by, for instance, withholding State-\nments of Net Assets in yearly investor reports.\n\n  [8] Accordingly, there was sufficient evidence to support\nDefendants’ convictions on Counts 17 and 18.\n\nII.    False or Misleading Statements in a Required ERISA\n       Document\n\n   Defendants also challenge their convictions under 18\nU.S.C. § 1027 for Making False or Misleading Statements in\nan ERISA Benefit Plan Document that Federal Law Requires\nto be Kept (Count 21). Count 21 concerned false statements\nin the 2001 Valuation Reports. Specifically, the government\nshowed that the Valuation Reports, under the heading “Addi-\n\f                   UNITED STATES v. ERIKSEN                3321\ntions During Year,” indicated that both employee deferrals\nand employer contributions had been made to the Partici-\npants’ accounts. According to the government’s expert wit-\nness, these reports were not accurate “[b]ecause these\nvaluation reports show that . . . money had been placed into\nthe trust. It shows that the contributions . . . had been placed\ninto the trust and into investments so those monies can grow,\nwhich is in fact not the case.”\n\n  Defendants argue that this misstatement in the Valuation\nReports is not material and, nevertheless, the Valuation\nReports were not “required” under the ERISA. Because\nDefendants raised these arguments to the district court, our\nreview is de novo. See United States v. Sarault, 840 F.2d\n1479, 1482 (9th Cir. 1988).\n\n   [9] We have held that § 1027 prohibits: (1) “any know-\ningly made false statements or representations of fact, [and]\ncertain knowingly concealed, covered-up, or undisclosed\nfacts”; (2) “in a document required by ERISA” to be either\npublished by an employee welfare benefit plan or employee\npension benefit plan, kept as part of the records of such a\nplan, or certified to the administrator of a plan. Sarault, 840\nF.2d at 1482.\n\n   [10] Contrary to Defendants’ contention, materiality is not\na prerequisite for, or an element of, a false statement convic-\ntion. See 18 U.S.C. § 1027 (“Whoever . . . makes any false\nstatement or representation of fact” (emphasis added));\nSarault, 840 F.2d at 1485 (explaining that Section 1027 pro-\nhibits “any knowingly made false statements or representa-\ntions of fact”); see also United States v. Nolan, 136 F.3d 265,\n271 (2d Cir. 1998) (“Materiality is not an element of a § 1027\nviolation.”). Even if it were an element of the offense, the\nValuation Reports statement that money had been added dur-\ning the Plan Year, when it in fact it had been used by the\nCompany under Defendants’ direction, was undoubtedly\nmaterial information that Participants would have desired to\n\f3322               UNITED STATES v. ERIKSEN\nknow. For instance, had an employee attempted to cash out\nhis 401(k) account at the end of 2001, he would have received\nfar less than what was indicated in the Valuation Reports\nreceived from Defendants.\n\n   [11] Turning to the central question of whether the Valua-\ntion Reports were required by the ERISA, we begin by exam-\nining the Act’s record-retention requirements:\n\n    Every person . . . shall maintain records on the mat-\n    ters of which disclosure is required which will pro-\n    vide in sufficient detail the necessary basic\n    information and data from which the documents thus\n    required may be verified, explained, or clarified, and\n    checked for accuracy and completeness, and shall\n    include vouchers, worksheets, receipts, and applica-\n    ble resolutions . . . .\n\n29 U.S.C. § 1027. In Sarault, we cast a broad net concerning\nwhat is “required” by this statute. There, we reviewed the\nconviction of an attorney who made false representations\nabout the solvency of an insurance company in a letter he sent\nto fund trustees who were seeking insurance coverage. 840\nF.2d at 1481-82. The letter represented that the insurance\ncompany was secured by $20 million in “reserves,” which\nwere actually fraudulent certificates of deposit. Id. at 1481.\nFollowing his conviction for making a false statement under\n§ 1027, the defendant argued that only “financial records such\nas receipts and premium statements” were required by the\nERISA. Id. at 1483. Drawing from a predecessor statute to the\nERISA, we observed that Congress intended for “a broad\nrange of documentation [to] be maintained under 29 U.S.C.\n§ 1027.” Id. at 1484. This range included the attorney’s letter\nbecause the trustees used it to complete other forms required\nby the ERISA, including IRS Form 5500. See 29 U.S.C.\n§ 1024(a)(2)(A); United States v. Harris, 185 F.3d 999,\n1003-04 (9th Cir. 1999). Thus, it was undoubtedly a docu-\nment that provided “ ‘in sufficient detail the necessary basic\n\f                   UNITED STATES v. ERIKSEN               3323\ninformation’ ” to allow another ERISA form to be “verif[ied],\nexplain[ed], clarif[ied], and check[ed] for accuracy and com-\npleteness.” Id. at 1483-84 (quoting 29 U.S.C. § 1027).\n\n   [12] Like the letter in Sarault, the Valuation Reports could\nbe used, and indeed were used, by Defendants to complete the\nannual Form 5500. As noted supra, Form 5500 asks whether\nthe company transmitted all Participant deferrals to the trust\naccount. Answering this question required aggregating each\nParticipant’s contributions, as memorialized in the Valuation\nReports, and then comparing that amount to the deposits to\nthe Plan’s brokerage account. Indeed, it was precisely this\ncomparison that alerted Brad Sommerfeld that certain monies\nwere not being remitted. Although Lunde Electric was not\nobligated to provide the Valuation Reports to investors unless\ndemanded, Sommerfeld still completed them, used them to\nprepare the Form 5500, and then mailed them to Participants.\nThe evidence showed that neither Defendant was ignorant of\nthe misstatements in these reports. Raymond, as Trustee,\nsigned these reports before they were sent to Participants. See\nWiseman, 274 F.3d at 1243 (“Key evidence of [the defen-\ndant’s] involvement in the embezzlement is his endorsement\n. . . of the checks drawn from the benefit plan accounts\n. . . .”). Likewise, Sigmund was present at the various times\nwhen attorney Braley and others told Defendants to deposit\nthe deferrals and, according to Lunde Electric’s several\naccountants, Sigmund was intimately involved in the Compa-\nny’s decisions about which bills should be paid with its dwin-\ndling cash revenues.\n\n   [13] Defendants’ post-hoc rationalizations—in particular\nthat, because Participants were ultimately repaid, these mis-\nstatements should be excused—ignores the language of\n§ 1027. As we observed in Harris, “[a]ll a person has to do\nin order to comply [with § 1027] is fill out truthfully the\n[Form 5500].” 185 F.3d at 1004. Defendants would have us\nadopt a holding that undermines a clear purpose of the\nERISA, which, as we detailed in Sarault, “was the need to\n\f3324              UNITED STATES v. ERIKSEN\nhave more information available to plan beneficiaries so they\ncan enforce their own rights.” 840 F.2d at 1484. While Defen-\ndants, upon the DOL’s launching of its investigation, may\nhave experienced a change of heart and repaid the Plan\nAccount, their initial decision to mislead their own employees\nabout the solvency of their retirement plans by filing false\naccount statements and false Form 5500s are the behaviors\ntargeted by § 1027. Ultimately, the ERISA’s goals of honest\ndisclosure and investor protection would be greatly under-\nmined if Defendants escaped liability for providing patently\nfalse account statements to Plan Participants.\n\n  [14] Accordingly, we hold there was sufficient evidence to\nsupport Defendants’ convictions on Count 21.\n\n                      CONCLUSION\n\n  For the foregoing reasons, Defendants’ convictions and\nsentences are AFFIRMED.\n\f",

We address Defendants’ other claims of error in a\ncontemporaneously filed Memorandum Disposition. We\naffirm.\n\n     FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\nI.   Lunde Electric Company Pension Plan\n\n  Until 2005, when it ceased operations, Lunde Electric\nCompany (Lunde Electric or the Company) of Seattle, Wash-\nington, was in the business of maritime electrical repair. Sig-\nmund Eriksen (Sigmund) served as Lunde Electric’s\nChairman, and his son Raymond Eriksen (Raymond) was\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer.\n\n   Sigmund purchased Lunde Electric in 1975. In 1979, the\nCompany established the Lunde Electric Co., Inc., Profit\nSharing Plan (the Plan) to provide retirement benefits for its\nunion employees. Sigmund and Raymond served as the Plan’s\ntrustees. Initially, Lunde Electric was the sole financial con-\ntributor to the Plan, and the Plan’s assets were held in a bro-\nkerage account at a local bank (the Plan Account). From 1979\nuntil the mid-1990s, Earl Sommerfeld served as the Plan’s\nbookkeeper. In 1999, Earl’s son, Brad Sommerfeld, assumed\nthose responsibilities.\n\n   The Plan was amended in 1984 and 1991 (the 1991 Plan).\nThe government and Defendants sharply disagree as to\nwhether the Plan was subsequently amended. According to\nthe government, the Plan was again amended in 1995 and\nthen restated in 2002. Defendants contend that there is no evi-\ndence of either event.\n\f                   UNITED STATES v. ERIKSEN                3303\n  A.   The 1995 Amendment and 2002 Restatement\n\n   According to the government, Article IV of the Plan, titled\n“Contribution and Allocation,” was amended in 1995 to add\na 401(k) feature (the 1995 Amendment). The 1995 Amend-\nment replaced contributions made exclusively by the Com-\npany with a system whereby Plan investors—called\n“Participants”—contributed a percentage of their paychecks\n—called “elective deferrals”—into the Plan. Lunde would\nthen “match” fifty percent of each Participant’s elective defer-\nral with an employer contribution. Funds in the Plan Account\nwere pooled and administered by the Eriksens.\n\n   According to the government, when the Eriksens added the\n401(k) feature, they did not redraft the 1991 Plan; instead,\nonly Article IV of the 1991 Plan was amended. As evidence\nof this change, the government introduced two versions of the\n1991 Plan. In the first version, which the government prof-\nfered as the original 1991 Plan, Article IV refers only to dis-\ncretionary “Employer’s Contribution[s]”: “For each Plan\nYear, the Employer shall contribute to the Plan such amount\nas shall be determined by the Employer.” However, in the\nsecond document, Article IV sets forth procedures for a “Par-\nticipant’s Salary Reduction Election.” Article 4.2 of that doc-\nument provides, inter alia, that “[e]ach Participant may elect\nto defer his Compensation which would have been received\nin the Plan Year, but for the deferral election, by up to 10\n[percent].” In addition to the documentary evidence, the gov-\nernment presented testimony that the Plan was amended in\n1995. For instance, the Plan’s stockbroker testified that new\n“trust certification papers” were filed with the Plan’s broker-\nage firm in 1995.\n\n   On January 1, 2002, the Plan was restated and a new docu-\nment titled “Lunde Electric Company, Inc. 401(k) Profit Shar-\ning Plan” became operative (the 2002 Restatement). Although\nthe date of the Plan’s effectiveness was not written in one\nspace provided in the document, several documents signed\n\f3304              UNITED STATES v. ERIKSEN\nand dated by Sigmund and Raymond contained information\nabout the 2002 Restatement’s effective date. These included\na “Consent to Corporate Authorization,” which “RESOLVED\nthat the form amended 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan and Trust\neffective January 1, 2002, presented to this meeting is hereby\napproved and adopted.” Additionally, the 2002 Restatement\nincluded a “Supplemental Participation Agreement” dated\nJanuary 1, 2002, and signed by Raymond as “Participating\nEmployer” and by both Raymond and Sigmund as Trustees.\nThis document also referred to a 401(k) plan.\n\n  B.   Missing Remittances to the Plan Account\n\n   In 1999, Lunde Electric began experiencing financial diffi-\nculties and was unable to pay its operating expenses with rev-\nenues. The government alleged that, as a result of these\nfinancial problems, the Eriksens caused the Company to stop\nremitting elective deferrals to the Plan.\n\n   Brad Sommerfeld regularly reviewed the Trust’s brokerage\nstatements as part of his responsibilities as Plan accountant.\nThose statements reflected deposits into and withdrawals\nfrom the Plan Account. Sommerfeld noticed that regular\ndeposits into the Plan Account were no longer made after\nOctober 1999. Indeed, the only deposit made to the Plan\nAccount for the 2000 Plan Year was for $10,000, on Decem-\nber 27, 2000. Although money continued to be withheld from\nParticipants’ paychecks, no deposits were made into the Plan\nAccount in 2001, in 2002, or from January through March\n2003.\n\n   From 1999 to 2002, Lunde Electric employed three differ-\nent bookkeepers—Cynthia Halcomb (mid-1990s to 1999),\nBrad Mansker (May 2000 to December 2000), and Toni Wun-\nsch (December 2000 to 2003). Both Halcomb and Mansker\ntestified that they would meet with the Eriksens on a regular\nbasis to decide which bills to pay. According to Mansker,\nwithin a few months of his starting work at the Company, he\n\f                    UNITED STATES v. ERIKSEN                  3305\nlearned that elective deferrals were not being remitted to the\nPlan. Mansker testified that he raised the issue of the out-\nstanding liability on several occasions, but that the Eriksens\ndid not direct the Company to make payments to the Plan dur-\ning his tenure. Moreover, starting in 1999, employees’ elec-\ntive deferrals were shown as “Receivables” on the Plan’s\nbalance sheet and reflected as a liability on Lunde Electric’s\nbooks. From 1999 to December 2002, the Plan Account’s\nReceivables grew from $35,156.62 to $97,374.68. By 2003,\nthe Receivables had increased to $103,606; from 1999 to\n2003, the Receivables ballooned from 1.47 % of the Plan’s\nassets to 15.01%.\n\n   On December 5, 2001, the Eriksens participated in a con-\nference call with attorney Ronald Braley. Defendants asked\nBraley about the consequences of not funding 401(k) trust\naccounts. Braley informed the Eriksens that they could be per-\nsonally liable as fiduciaries and, in his own words, informed\nthem “that while the Department of Labor usually does not\ntake a keen interest in plans with fewer than 100, if an\nemployee knew about it and complained to the Department of\nLabor, that an investigation may open up and they would have\na more serious issue.” During the conference call, Braley\nemphasized that the Eriksens had to pay the unfunded liability\n“as soon as possible.” Thereafter, Braley memorialized the\nconversation in an email he transmitted to the Eriksens. That\nemail reads, in part: “Apparently, for the past year and one\nhalf, they have failed to contribute to the 401(k) . . . Plan after\ntaking elective deferrals from employees.”\n\n  On May 2, 2002, Brad Sommerfeld wrote to bookkeeper\nToni Wunsch concerning the Company’s accounting:\n\n    As you know the Company is significantly behind in\n    depositing its 401K contributions. This is a huge\n    problem because most of the money comes from\n    employees’ paychecks and the Officers of the Com-\n    pany and Trustees of the Plan have a fiduciary\n\f3306               UNITED STATES v. ERIKSEN\n    responsibility to deposit these funds timely (deposits\n    are due monthly). This is possibly the worst liability\n    to fall behind on in terms of legal and tax problems.\n\nSommerfeld testified that he also had a conversation with Sig-\nmund about the Plan’s delinquency and that Sigmund stated,\n“We’re doing the best we can.”\n\n  C.   Lunde Electric’s Tax Filings\n\n   After 1995, Lunde Electric began providing yearly “Partici-\npant’s Valuation Reports” to employees enrolled in the 401(k)\nPlan. These reports purported to show each Participant’s\nassets in the Plan and contributions made for the prior Plan\nYear. The Valuation Reports were prepared by Brad Sommer-\nfeld and signed by Raymond. Until 1999, a Statement of Net\nAssets, which detailed the total Plan assets, was also delivered\nto each Participant. After the 1999 Plan Year, Lunde Electric\nceased providing Statements of Net Assets when it delivered\ncopies of Valuation Reports to Participants. Nevertheless,\nSommerfeld continued to prepare Statements of Net Assets\nfor those years, which he provided to the Eriksens.\n\n   Lunde Electric filed certain documents with the Internal\nRevenue Service (IRS), including a Form 5500, in connection\nwith its operation of the Plan. Form 5500, titled, “Annual\nReturn/Report of Employee Benefit Plan,” details contribu-\ntions made to an ERISA fund. Brad Sommerfeld prepared the\nForm 5500 each year, and either Raymond or Sigmund, as\nPlan administrators, signed the document before submitting it\nto the IRS.\n\n   Among other questions, Form 5500 asks: “Was there a fail-\nure to transmit to the plan any participant contributions within\nthe time period described in 29 [Code of Federal Regulations\n(C.F.R.)] 2510.3-102?” The reference to the Code of Federal\nRegulations is to an ERISA regulation titled “Definition of\n\f                   UNITED STATES v. ERIKSEN                    3307\n‘plan assets’—participant contributions” (the Plan Asset Reg-\nulation), which provides:\n\n    (a)(1) General rule. For purposes of subtitle A and\n    parts 1 and 4 of subtitle B of title I of ERISA and\n    section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code only (but\n    without any implication for and may not be relied\n    upon to bar criminal prosecutions under 18 U.S.C.\n    664), the assets of the plan include amounts (other\n    than union dues) that a participant or beneficiary\n    pays to an employer, or amounts that a participant\n    has withheld from his wages by an employer, for\n    contribution or repayment of a participant loan to the\n    plan, as of the earliest date on which such contribu-\n    tions or repayments can reasonably be segregated\n    from the employer’s general assets.\n\n    ....\n\n    (b) Maximum time period for pension benefit plans.\n\n    (1) . . . [I]n no event shall the date determined pursu-\n    ant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section occur later\n    than the 15th business day of the month following\n    the month in which the participant contribution or\n    participant loan repayment amounts are received by\n    the employer (in the case of amounts that a partici-\n    pant or beneficiary pays to an employer) or the 15th\n    business day of the month following the month in\n    which such amounts would otherwise have been\n    payable to the participant in cash (in the case of\n    amounts withheld by an employer from a partici-\n    pant’s wages).\n\n29 C.F.R. § 2510.3-102(a)(1), (b)(1). For the 1999, 2000, and\n2001 tax years, the Form 5500s filed by Lunde Electric indi-\ncated that all Participant contributions had been transmitted.\n\f3308                UNITED STATES v. ERIKSEN\nSommerfeld testified that this was not true and that he had fal-\nsified the three forms because:\n\n      The answer yes is a flag to the Internal Revenue Ser-\n      vice that the plan is delinquent or behind on their\n      contributions. And that may—or would result in\n      either an IRS audit or a Department of Labor investi-\n      gation. And I was afraid that I would be blamed for\n      blowing the whistle or causing either one of those\n      actions to take place and cause harm to the company.\n\n  D.    Department of Labor Investigation and Indictment\n\n   In early 2003, bookkeeper Wunsch discussed her concerns\nabout the 401(k) Plan with the Eriksens. Thereafter, Wunsch\ncontacted the Department of Labor (DOL) and met with an\ninvestigator. In March 2003, the DOL issued a grand jury sub-\npoena to Lunde Electric. After the April 2003 subpoena was\nserved, Lunde Electric resumed remitting elective deferrals to\nthe Plan. By October 2004, Lunde Electric had lowered its\noutstanding obligations to the Plan from approximately\n$105,000 to $1,000. When Lunde Electric ceased operations\nin April 2005, all Plan Participants received their full 401(k)\ndistribution.\n\n   In 2008, based on the events detailed supra, Sigmund and\nRaymond were indicted on one count of Conspiracy to\nEmbezzle $70,120.55 from an ERISA Employee Plan, in vio-\nlation of 18 U.S.C. § 371 (Count 1); seventeen counts of\nEmbezzlement or Conversion from an ERISA Employee Ben-\nefit Plan, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 664 and 2 (Counts 2-\n18), and three counts of Making False or Misleading State-\nments in an ERISA Benefit Plan Document that Federal Law\nRequires to be Kept, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1027 and 2\n(Counts 19-21).\n\nII.    Trial and Sentencing\n\n  The Eriksens’ jury trial commenced on October 5, 2009.\nRaymond testified that he did not play a role in preparing any\n\f                   UNITED STATES v. ERIKSEN               3309\nof the Plan’s documents and that he did not remember signing\nthe 1995 Amendment establishing the 401(k). According to\nRaymond, neither he nor Sigmund was involved in the prepa-\nration or review of the Valuation Reports, the Form 5500s, or\nthe Plan’s Statements of Net Assets. Raymond testified that\nhe was unaware that employee elective deferrals were not\nbeing forwarded to the Plan Account in 1999, 2000, and 2001.\nHowever, Raymond acknowledged making personal contribu-\ntions to the 401(k) starting in October 1999.\n\n   At trial, the Eriksens presented the testimony of William\nWhitman, an expert witness on ERISA issues. Although\nWhitman testified that there are no “hard deadlines” for when\nan employer must contribute the employer portion of a 401(k)\nplan, he did not testify about when an employer must remit\nemployee contributions. According to Whitman, an amend-\nment to an ERISA plan must be “in writing” and executed by\na corporate officer and the plan’s trustees.\n\n   The jury returned identical verdicts for both Defendants,\nconvicting them on Counts 17 and 18, for failing to remit\nelective deferrals from December 2002 and March 2003 pay-\nchecks. The jury also convicted Defendants on Count 21,\nwhich concerned making a false statement in the 2001 Valua-\ntion Report. The jury deadlocked on Counts 9 through 16 and\n20 and acquitted Defendants on Counts 1 through 8 and 19.\nDefendants moved for judgments of acquittal, which the dis-\ntrict court denied in an order dated November 4, 2009.\n\n   The district court sentenced both Defendants to two years\nof probation, a $20,000 fine, 240 hours of community service,\nand the mandatory special assessment of $300. Defendants\ntimely appeal.\n\n                       DISCUSSION\n\n  Defendants seek to overturn the jury’s verdict on the\ngrounds that there was insufficient evidence of criminal intent\n\f3310                UNITED STATES v. ERIKSEN\nor that Lunde Electric established the 401(k) Plan, and that\nthe government improperly referred to the Plan Asset Regula-\ntion at trial. We are not persuaded.\n\nI.    Embezzlement or Conversion of the Elective Deferrals\n\n     A.   Scope of the Offense\n\n  [1] Defendants were convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 664 for\nembezzling or converting the Plan’s assets in December 2002\nand March 2003. Section 664 provides:\n\n      Any person who embezzles, steals, or unlawfully\n      and willfully abstracts or converts to his own use or\n      to the use of another, any of the moneys, funds,\n      securities, premiums, credits, property, or other\n      assets of any employee welfare benefit plan or\n      employee pension benefit plan, or of any fund con-\n      nected therewith, shall be fined under this title, or\n      imprisoned not more than five years, or both.\n\n      As used in this section, the term “any employee wel-\n      fare benefit plan or employee pension benefit plan”\n      means any employee benefit plan subject to any pro-\n      vision of title I of the Employee Retirement Income\n      Security Act of 1974.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 664. We have held that the operative terms “em-\nbezzles” and “converts” are to be given their common-law\nmeanings. United States v. Andreen, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"381455\"><a href=\"/opinion/381455/united-states-v-robert-andreen/\"><span class=\"volume\">628</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1236</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1241 (9th\nCir. 1980); Woxberg v.

Thus, “[e]mbezzlement is the fraudulent appropri-\nation of property by a person to whom such property has been\nentrusted, or into whose hands it has lawfully come.” Wox-\nberg, 329 F.2d at 290; see also Andreen, 628 F.2d at 1241\n(citing United States v. Dupee, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"352629\"><a href=\"/opinion/352629/united-states-v-lawrence-d-dupee/\"><span class=\"volume\">569</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1061</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1064 (9th Cir.\n1978)). Conversion “encompasses the use of property, placed\nin one’s custody for a limited purpose, in an unauthorized\n\f                   UNITED STATES v. ERIKSEN                  3311\nmanner or to an unauthorized extent.” Andreen, 628 F.2d at\n1241 (citing Morissette v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104952\"><a href=\"/opinion/104952/morissette-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">342</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">246</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 272\n(1952)).\n\n   We have also recognized that § 664 does more than recapit-\nulate common-law offenses. Because § 664 and other\npension-protection laws, see, e.g., 29 U.S.C. § 501(c) (prohib-\niting embezzlement from a labor organization fund), are\naimed at “preserv[ing] welfare and pension funds for the pro-\ntection of those entitled to their benefits,” we have held that\n§ 664 imposes liability for a broad class of “unauthorized”\nacts willfully committed by those in a fiduciary or advisory\ncapacity. See Andreen, 628 F.2d at 1241, 1242 (examining the\nlegislative history of 29 U.S.C. § 501, 18 U.S.C. § 664). As\nthen-Judge Kennedy explained:\n\n    The essence of the crime is theft and in the context\n    of union funds or pension plans the offense includes\n    a taking or appropriation that is unauthorized, if\n    accomplished with specific criminal intent. In this\n    respect lack of authorization may be shown if the\n    diversion is substantially inconsistent with the fidu-\n    ciary purposes and objectives of the union funds or\n    pension plan, as set forth by statutes, bylaws, char-\n    ters, or trust documents which govern uses of the\n    funds in question. Whatever imprecision attends this\n    definition is remedied substantially by the require-\n    ment of scienter, which is an essential element of the\n    crime. The act to be criminal must be willful, which\n    means an act done with a fraudulent intent or a bad\n    purpose or an evil motive.\n\nId. at 1241 (emphasis added) (citation omitted).\n\n   [2] We have consistently declined invitations to engraft\nadditional elements onto, or create affirmative defenses for,\n§ 664 violations. In Andreen, we rejected the “participant ben-\nefit” theory by holding that so long as a fiduciary used plan\n\f3312               UNITED STATES v. ERIKSEN\nassets in an unauthorized manner, the “lack of benefit to the\n[plan beneficiaries] is not an element of the offense required\nto be shown as part of the prosecution’s case.” Id. at 1242.\nLikewise, “the conferring of any benefit in such a case is not\na defense, except insofar as it may bear upon the defendant’s\nstate of mind in committing the acts in question.” Id. at\n1242-43. We thus rejected the appeal of an attorney who had\nassisted the trustees of a pension plan in drafting an unautho-\nrized compensation plan that rewarded the trustees for merely\nexecuting their fiduciary duties. Id. at 1245-46. We reasoned\nthat the attorney’s attendance at trustee meetings where the\ncompensation plan was discussed, coupled with his knowl-\nedge that the “plan was unauthorized,” was sufficient to show\nthat he aided and abetted a violation of § 664. Id. at 1246.\n\n   In United States v.

Mett and Wiseman were separate appeals of\nthe same underlying prosecution against two executives of an\nart gallery who withdrew $1.6 million from a pension plan to\nfinance their floundering enterprise.

ERIKSEN                  3313\nas the trustees of two pension benefit plans. Id. at 1060. After\nbeing indicted for felony art fraud, their gallery “fell on hard\ntimes,” and the trustees withdrew money from pension plans\nand deposited it into the company’s general operating account\nwithout informing the employees-beneficiaries. Id. at\n1060-61. While Mett and Wiseman admitted making the with-\ndrawals, they sought to avoid liability by characterizing their\nappropriations as implicitly authorized “loans” necessary for\nthe business to survive. Id. at 1060. This implied authorization\nwas founded on the premise that, because the gallery would\nhave had to be closed and the employee-beneficiaries “would\notherwise have been laid off and faced with unemployment,”\nid., the acts were not criminal.\n\n   We rejected the “implied authorization” defense based on\na fiduciary’s purported intention to serve the “broader” inter-\nests of employee welfare. Id. at 1067. Because ERISA funds\nare protected so that they will be “available at retirement”—\nand are therefore subject to numerous non-alienation\nrestrictions—we observed that an “authorization” argument\nwas illogical. After all, if the beneficiaries themselves are not\nat liberty to dispose of the funds for a purpose other than\nretirement, they could not lawfully authorize someone else to\ndo it for them.

Count 18 involved\n$1,000.40 in deferrals from March 2003.

According to Defendants’ theory, the\ngovernment had to introduce a properly executed version of\nthe 1995 Amendment. Because the government does not have\nsuch a document, Defendants argue, the elective deferrals\nwere actually discretionary “employer contributions” that do\nnot become “Plan Assets” until they are remitted to the Plan.\n\f3316               UNITED STATES v. ERIKSEN\n   Defendants’ argument regarding the validity of the 1995\nAmendment is a red herring. Defendants were convicted only\nfor their failure to remit deferrals after the 2002 Restatement.\nEven though the Form 5500s submitted to the IRS by Lunde\nElectric, the testimony of Brad Sommerfeld, and the email by\nattorney Braley all indicated that the 401(k) Plan existed\nbefore 2002, because Counts 17 and 18 concerned conduct\nthat occurred after the 2002 Plan Restatement, we need only\nconsider that document. The Eriksens do not dispute that the\n1991 Plan was governed by Title I of ERISA, but contend that\nthe evidence did not allow the conclusion that the Plan was\nthereafter amended or restated.\n\n   [4] “Generally, whether a plan is subject to Title I of\nERISA is an issue of fact to be decided by the jury, guided\nby applicable legal principles.” United States v.

The amendment\nprocedures for any ERISA benefit plan must be specified by\nthe employer and identify the persons with the “authority to\namend.” Winterrowd, 321 F.3d at 937 (citing 29 U.S.C.\n§ 1102(b)(3)). Here, the 1991 Plan, at Section 10.6, specified\nthat amending the Plan “shall only be by the written action of\neach and every Participating Employer and with the consent\nof the Trustee where such consent is necessary.” To show\nsuch an amendment occurred by at least 2002, the government\nintroduced a written copy of the 2002 Restatement, which\nincluded a 401(k) provision and was signed by Raymond as\n“Employer” and “Trustee” and by Sigmund as “Trustee.” The\ngovernment also introduced addenda referring to the effective\ndate of the Restatement as January 1, 2002, as well as a “Con-\nsent to Corporate Action” by Lunde Electric that approved the\n“amended 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan . . . effective January 1,\n2002.” Any of these documents alone was competent evi-\ndence to allow the jury to conclude that the Plan had been\nrestated in 2002 with a 401(k) plan. Accordingly, there was\nsufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that the 1991 Plan\n\f                   UNITED STATES v. ERIKSEN                 3317\nhad been restated before the Eriksens retained their employ-\nees’ elective deferrals in the Company’s general account.\n\n    2.   Embezzlement, Conversion, or Unauthorized Use\n         of Funds\n\n   The second element of § 664 requires the jury to find that\na defendant willfully embezzled, converted, or misappropri-\nated the funds of a pension plan. Andreen, 628 F.2d at 1241.\nDefendants concede that the funds were not remitted to the\nPlan Account before the DOL investigation. However, they\ncontend that their keeping elective deferrals for longer than\nfifteen days—a deadline specified in the Plan Asset\nRegulation—is not tantamount to embezzlement or conver-\nsion. According to Defendants, the government, by referenc-\ning the Plan Asset Regulation, misled the jury into concluding\notherwise. In support of their argument, Defendants ask us to\nconsider the holdings of United States v. Christo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"374078\"><a href=\"/opinion/374078/united-states-v-john-christo-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">614</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">486</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Cir. 1980), and United States v.

Wolf, 820 F.2d at 1501; Christo, 614 F.2d at\n489.\n\n   In Christo, the misapplication charge was based on a bank\nofficer’s repeatedly overdrawing his checking account. At the\ntime, 12 U.S.C. § 375a prohibited a bank from extending a\nloan of more than $5,000 to one of its officers. Christo, 614\nF.2d at 488 n.2, 490. The trial court quoted § 375a to the jury\nand further instructed the jury that it could consider violations\nof § 375a in connection with the criminal misapplication\ncharges. Id. at 491. The Fifth Circuit reversed the defendant’s\nmisapplication conviction, observing:\n\f3318               UNITED STATES v. ERIKSEN\n    A conviction, resulting from the government’s\n    attempt to bootstrap a series of checking account\n    overdrafts, a civil regulatory violation, into an equal\n    amount of misapplication felonies, cannot be\n    allowed to stand. The government’s evidence and\n    argument concerning violations of § 375a imper-\n    missibly infected the very purpose for which the trial\n    was being conducted . . . .\n\nId. at 492.\n\n   In Wolf, we relied on Christo to reverse convictions against\na bank executive for misapplying bank funds and making\nfalse entries in a bank record. The executive had, among other\nacts, failed to disclose required information about the benefi-\nciaries of his bank loans. Wolf, 820 F.2d at 1503. We faulted\nthe government for basing its misapplication charges on a\ncivil banking regulation that imposes a duty on bank employ-\nees to inform the bank’s board of directors about the purpose\nof a loan. During Wolf’s trial, the government’s expert wit-\nness testified that the defendant’s failure to disclose he was a\nbeneficiary of some of the loans he disbursed violated Federal\nReserve Regulation O (12 C.F.R. § 215). We held that the ref-\nerences to the Regulation were impermissible:\n\n    Unlike references to [other civil violations which\n    occurred during the trial], the references to Regula-\n    tion O cannot be dismissed as being simply back-\n    ground information. The references were a key part\n    of the government’s case on the misapplication and\n    false entry counts. . . .\n\n       To supply the missing element of the false entry\n    and misapplication charges, the government turned\n    to Regulation O. Through its expert witness the gov-\n    ernment established that Regulation O imposed a\n    duty on [the defendant] to inform the bank’s direc-\n    tors that he had an interest in the loans . . . . In sum,\n\f                    UNITED STATES v. ERIKSEN                 3319\n    the government used Regulation O to supply a cru-\n    cial element of the misapplication and false entry\n    charges.\n\nId. at 1505 (emphasis added). Thus, under the logic of Christo\nand Wolf, it is impermissible to use the violation of a civil\nstatute to ipso facto “supply a crucial element” of a criminal\noffense.\n\n   [5] Contrary to Christo and Wolf, the Plan Asset Regula-\ntion played an inconsequential or, more likely, no role in\nDefendants’ convictions. Importantly, the Plan Asset Regula-\ntion does not create a reporting or other affirmative obligation\non an employer nor does it prohibit certain behaviors under\nthreat of civil sanction; rather, the regulation simply defines\n“plan asset”: “the assets of the plan include amounts . . . that\na participant or beneficiary pays to an employer.” 29 C.F.R.\n§ 2510.3-102(a)(1) (emphasis added). While one could selec-\ntively excerpt and rewrite portions of the regulation to create\nthe appearance that it requires employers to remit their elec-\ntive deferrals, the regulation does not create any such obliga-\ntion. Indeed, the obligation not to use other people’s money\nfor purposes they have not authorized is traceable more fairly\nto antiquity than to the Plan Asset Regulation. Thus, contrary\nto the facts in Wolf, none of the elements of Counts 17 or 18\nwas established at trial, or could be established, by bootstrap-\nping a violation of the regulation. Unlike in Christo, the regu-\nlation did not mislead the jury in its deliberations, as it was\nnot even a factor for the jurors’ consideration.\n\n   [6] The government did not contend that it was Defen-\ndants’ failure to remit deferrals within fifteen days that consti-\ntuted their crime. Rather, it was the fact that employee\ncontributions were never remitted from January 1, 2002, until\nthe DOL became involved, but were, instead, used to pay\nbusiness expenses, as recounted by Brad Sommerfeld and oth-\ners, that formed the factual and legal basis for the govern-\nment’s case. Conversion is a simple offense that\n\f3320               UNITED STATES v. ERIKSEN\n“encompasses the use of property, placed in one’s custody for\na limited purpose, in an unauthorized manner or to an unau-\nthorized extent.” Andreen, 628 F.2d at 1241. When Defen-\ndants commingled their employees’ contributions with the\nCompany’s assets to prop up their failing business, they inten-\ntionally used their employee’s assets for an unauthorized pur-\npose. Moreover, they sent Participants account statements\nshowing 401(k) balances which were, in fact, non-existent.\nDefendants’ acts were “substantially inconsistent with the\nfiduciary purposes and objectives of the union funds or pen-\nsion plan, as set forth by statutes, bylaws, charters, or trust\ndocuments which govern uses of the funds in question.” Id.\nAs fiduciaries of the money given to them by their employees,\nDefendants were entrusted with custody of their employees’\nmoney for the sole purpose of remitting it to the 401(k) Plan;\nthe Defendants’ decision to deviate, be it to bet on horse races\nor pay other bills, is the wilful criminal misappropriation pun-\nished by § 664.\n\n   [7] Finally, Defendants’ argument regarding the absence of\nintent is undercut by the evidence that both Defendants were\nalerted repeatedly about their obligation to remit the deferrals.\nMoreover, the government showed that Defendants hid their\nactions from employees by, for instance, withholding State-\nments of Net Assets in yearly investor reports.\n\n  [8] Accordingly, there was sufficient evidence to support\nDefendants’ convictions on Counts 17 and 18.\n\nII.    False or Misleading Statements in a Required ERISA\n       Document\n\n   Defendants also challenge their convictions under 18\nU.S.C. § 1027 for Making False or Misleading Statements in\nan ERISA Benefit Plan Document that Federal Law Requires\nto be Kept (Count 21). Count 21 concerned false statements\nin the 2001 Valuation Reports. Specifically, the government\nshowed that the Valuation Reports, under the heading “Addi-\n\f                   UNITED STATES v. ERIKSEN                3321\ntions During Year,” indicated that both employee deferrals\nand employer contributions had been made to the Partici-\npants’ accounts. According to the government’s expert wit-\nness, these reports were not accurate “[b]ecause these\nvaluation reports show that . . . money had been placed into\nthe trust. It shows that the contributions . . . had been placed\ninto the trust and into investments so those monies can grow,\nwhich is in fact not the case.”\n\n  Defendants argue that this misstatement in the Valuation\nReports is not material and, nevertheless, the Valuation\nReports were not “required” under the ERISA. Because\nDefendants raised these arguments to the district court, our\nreview is de novo. See United States v. Sarault, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"502469\"><a href=\"/opinion/502469/9-employee-benefits-ca-1872-24-fed-r-evid-serv-1176-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">840</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1479</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1482 (9th Cir. 1988).\n\n   [9] We have held that § 1027 prohibits: (1) “any know-\ningly made false statements or representations of fact, [and]\ncertain knowingly concealed, covered-up, or undisclosed\nfacts”; (2) “in a document required by ERISA” to be either\npublished by an employee welfare benefit plan or employee\npension benefit plan, kept as part of the records of such a\nplan, or certified to the administrator of a plan. Sarault, 840\nF.2d at 1482.\n\n   [10] Contrary to Defendants’ contention, materiality is not\na prerequisite for, or an element of, a false statement convic-\ntion. See 18 U.S.C. § 1027 (“Whoever . . . makes any false\nstatement or representation of fact” (emphasis added));\nSarault, 840 F.2d at 1485 (explaining that Section 1027 pro-\nhibits “any knowingly made false statements or representa-\ntions of fact”); see also United States v. Nolan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"751624\"><a href=\"/opinion/751624/united-states-v-barbara-nolan-and-nhg-pension-associates-inc-august/\"><span class=\"volume\">136</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">265</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n271 (2d Cir. 1998) (“Materiality is not an element of a § 1027\nviolation.”). Even if it were an element of the offense, the\nValuation Reports statement that money had been added dur-\ning the Plan Year, when it in fact it had been used by the\nCompany under Defendants’ direction, was undoubtedly\nmaterial information that Participants would have desired to\n\f3322               UNITED STATES v. ERIKSEN\nknow. For instance, had an employee attempted to cash out\nhis 401(k) account at the end of 2001, he would have received\nfar less than what was indicated in the Valuation Reports\nreceived from Defendants.\n\n   [11] Turning to the central question of whether the Valua-\ntion Reports were required by the ERISA, we begin by exam-\nining the Act’s record-retention requirements:\n\n    Every person . . . shall maintain records on the mat-\n    ters of which disclosure is required which will pro-\n    vide in sufficient detail the necessary basic\n    information and data from which the documents thus\n    required may be verified, explained, or clarified, and\n    checked for accuracy and completeness, and shall\n    include vouchers, worksheets, receipts, and applica-\n    ble resolutions . . . .\n\n29 U.S.C. § 1027. In Sarault, we cast a broad net concerning\nwhat is “required” by this statute. There, we reviewed the\nconviction of an attorney who made false representations\nabout the solvency of an insurance company in a letter he sent\nto fund trustees who were seeking insurance coverage. 840\nF.2d at 1481-82. The letter represented that the insurance\ncompany was secured by $20 million in “reserves,” which\nwere actually fraudulent certificates of deposit. Id. at 1481.\nFollowing his conviction for making a false statement under\n§ 1027, the defendant argued that only “financial records such\nas receipts and premium statements” were required by the\nERISA. Id. at 1483. Drawing from a predecessor statute to the\nERISA, we observed that Congress intended for “a broad\nrange of documentation [to] be maintained under 29 U.S.C.\n§ 1027.” Id. at 1484. This range included the attorney’s letter\nbecause the trustees used it to complete other forms required\nby the ERISA, including IRS Form 5500. See 29 U.S.C.\n§ 1024(a)(2)(A); United States v. Harris, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765439\"><a href=\"/opinion/765439/united-states-v-michael-harris/\"><span class=\"volume\">185</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">999</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1003-04 (9th Cir. 1999). Thus, it was undoubtedly a docu-\nment that provided “ ‘in sufficient detail the necessary basic\n\f                   UNITED STATES v. ERIKSEN               3323\ninformation’ ” to allow another ERISA form to be “verif[ied],\nexplain[ed], clarif[ied], and check[ed] for accuracy and com-\npleteness.” Id. at 1483-84 (quoting 29 U.S.C. § 1027).\n\n   [12] Like the letter in Sarault, the Valuation Reports could\nbe used, and indeed were used, by Defendants to complete the\nannual Form 5500. As noted supra, Form 5500 asks whether\nthe company transmitted all Participant deferrals to the trust\naccount. Answering this question required aggregating each\nParticipant’s contributions, as memorialized in the Valuation\nReports, and then comparing that amount to the deposits to\nthe Plan’s brokerage account. Indeed, it was precisely this\ncomparison that alerted Brad Sommerfeld that certain monies\nwere not being remitted. Although Lunde Electric was not\nobligated to provide the Valuation Reports to investors unless\ndemanded, Sommerfeld still completed them, used them to\nprepare the Form 5500, and then mailed them to Participants.\nThe evidence showed that neither Defendant was ignorant of\nthe misstatements in these reports. Raymond, as Trustee,\nsigned these reports before they were sent to Participants. See\nWiseman, 274 F.3d at 1243 (“Key evidence of [the defen-\ndant’s] involvement in the embezzlement is his endorsement\n. . . of the checks drawn from the benefit plan accounts\n. . . .”). Likewise, Sigmund was present at the various times\nwhen attorney Braley and others told Defendants to deposit\nthe deferrals and, according to Lunde Electric’s several\naccountants, Sigmund was intimately involved in the Compa-\nny’s decisions about which bills should be paid with its dwin-\ndling cash revenues.\n\n   [13] Defendants’ post-hoc rationalizations—in particular\nthat, because Participants were ultimately repaid, these mis-\nstatements should be excused—ignores the language of\n§ 1027. As we observed in Harris, “[a]ll a person has to do\nin order to comply [with § 1027] is fill out truthfully the\n[Form 5500].” 185 F.3d at 1004. Defendants would have us\nadopt a holding that undermines a clear purpose of the\nERISA, which, as we detailed in Sarault, “was the need to\n\f3324              UNITED STATES v. ERIKSEN\nhave more information available to plan beneficiaries so they\ncan enforce their own rights.” 840 F.2d at 1484. While Defen-\ndants, upon the DOL’s launching of its investigation, may\nhave experienced a change of heart and repaid the Plan\nAccount, their initial decision to mislead their own employees\nabout the solvency of their retirement plans by filing false\naccount statements and false Form 5500s are the behaviors\ntargeted by § 1027. Ultimately, the ERISA’s goals of honest\ndisclosure and investor protection would be greatly under-\nmined if Defendants escaped liability for providing patently\nfalse account statements to Plan Participants.\n\n  [14] Accordingly, we hold there was sufficient evidence to\nsupport Defendants’ convictions on Count 21.\n\n                      CONCLUSION\n\n  For the foregoing reasons, Defendants’ convictions and\nsentences are AFFIRMED.\n\f</pre>",
