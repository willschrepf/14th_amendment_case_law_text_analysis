Our review is guided by the\nprinciples articulated in the Supreme Court’s recent decisions\nregarding affirmative action in higher education, Grutter v.\n\f14660        PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\nBollinger, 539 U.S. 306 (2003), and Gratz v.

We\nconclude that the District has a compelling interest in securing\nthe educational and social benefits of racial (and ethnic)\ndiversity, and in ameliorating racial isolation or concentration\nin its high schools by ensuring that its assignments do not\nsimply replicate Seattle’s segregated housing patterns.1 We\nalso conclude that the District’s Plan is narrowly tailored to\nmeet the District’s compelling interests.\n\n                           I. Background2\n\n  A. Seattle Public Schools: A Historical Perspective\n\n   Seattle’s historical struggle with the problem of racial isola-\ntion in its public school system provides the context for the\nDistrict’s implementation of the current challenged assign-\nment plan. Seattle is a diverse community. Approximately 70\npercent of its residents are white, and 30 percent are non-\nwhite. Seattle public school enrollment breaks down nearly\ninversely, with approximately 40 percent white and 60 per-\ncent nonwhite students. A majority of the District’s white stu-\ndents live in neighborhoods north of downtown, the\nhistorically more affluent part of the city. A majority of the\ncity’s nonwhite students, including approximately 84 percent\nof all African-American students, 74 percent of all Asian-\nAmerican students, 65 percent of all Latino students and 51\n   1\n     The terms “racial diversity,” “racial concentration” and “racial isola-\ntion” have been used by the District to encompass racial and ethnic diver-\nsity, concentration and isolation. For the purposes of this opinion, we\nadopt this shorthand.\n   2\n     We draw the following restatement of facts largely from the district\ncourt opinion, see Parents Involved in Cmty. Schs. v. Seattle Sch. Dist. No.\n1, 137 F. Supp. 2d 1224 (W.D. Wash. 2001) (“Parents I”), and the Wash-\nington Supreme Court Opinion, see Parents Involved in Cmty. Schs. v.\nSeattle Sch. Dist. No. 1, 72 P.3d 151 (Wash. 2003) (“Parents IV”).\n\f            PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.                14661\npercent of all Native-American students, live south of down-\ntown.\n\n   The District operates 10 four-year public high schools.\nFour are located north of downtown — Ballard, Ingraham,\nNathan Hale and Roosevelt; five are located south of down-\ntown — Chief Sealth, Cleveland, Franklin, Garfield and Rai-\nnier Beach; one is located west of downtown — West Seattle.\nFor over 40 years, the District has made efforts to attain and\nmaintain desegregated schools and avoid the racial isolation\nor concentration that would ensue if school assignments repli-\ncated Seattle’s segregated housing patterns. Since the 1960s,\nwhile courts around the country ordered intransigent school\ndistricts to desegregate, Seattle’s School Board voluntarily\nexplored measures designed to end de facto segregation in the\nschools and provide all of the District’s students with access\nto diverse and equal educational opportunities.\n\n  In the late 1950s and early 1960s, school assignments were\nmade strictly on the basis of neighborhood.3 In 1962, Garfield\nHigh School reported 64 percent minority enrollment and it\naccommodated 75 percent of all African-American students.\nMeanwhile, the eight high schools serving other major areas\nof the city remained more than 95 percent white.\n\n   The District responded to this imbalance, and racial ten-\nsions in the de facto segregated schools, in various ways. In\nthe early 1960s, the District first experimented with small-\nscale exchange programs in which handfuls of students\nswitched high schools for five-week periods. In 1963, expand-\ning on this concept, the District implemented a “Voluntary\n  3\n    The history that follows comes principally from two documents in the\ndistrict court record. One is a report entitled, “The History of Desegrega-\ntion in Seattle Public Schools, 1954-1981,” which was prepared by the\nDistrict’s desegregation planners. The other is the “Findings and Conclu-\nsions” adopted by the Board in support of the current assignment plan.\n(They are cited as History of Desegregation and Findings and Conclu-\nsions, respectively.)\n\f14662      PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\nRacial Transfer” program through which a student could\ntransfer to any school with available space if the transfer\nwould improve the racial balance at the receiving school. In\nthe 1970s, the District increased its efforts again, this time\nadopting a desegregation plan in the middle schools that\nrequested volunteers to transfer between minority- and\nmajority-dominated neighborhood schools and called for\nmandatory transfers when the number of volunteers was\ninsufficient, though this portion of the plan was never imple-\nmented. The District also took steps to desegregate Garfield\nHigh School by changing its educational program, improving\nits facilities and eliminating “special transfers” that had previ-\nously allowed white students to leave Garfield. Finally, for\nthe 1977-78 school year, the District instituted a magnet-\nschool program. According to the District’s history:\n      While it appeared evident that the addition of magnet\n      programs would not in itself desegregate the Seattle\n      schools, there was supportive evidence that volun-\n      tary strategies, magnet and non-magnet, could be\n      significant components of a more comprehensive\n      desegregation plan.\nHistory of Desegregation at 32.\n   By the 1977-78 school year, segregation had increased:\nFranklin was 78 percent minority, Rainier Beach 58 percent,\nCleveland 76 percent and Garfield 65 percent. Other high\nschools ranged from 9 percent to 23 percent minority enroll-\nment.\n   In the spring of 1977, the Seattle branch of the National\nAssociation for the Advancement of Colored People\n(“NAACP”) filed a complaint with the United States Depart-\nment of Education’s Office of Civil Rights, alleging that Seat-\ntle’s School Board had acted to further racial segregation in\nthe city’s schools. Several other organizations, principally the\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union (“ACLU”), formally threat-\nened to file additional actions if the District failed to adopt a\nmandatory desegregation plan. When the District agreed to\n\f            PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.              14663\ndevelop such a plan, the Office of Civil Rights concomitantly\nagreed to delay its investigation, and the ACLU agreed to\ndelay filing a lawsuit.\n   During the summer of 1977, the District and community\nrepresentatives reviewed five model plans. Ultimately, the\nDistrict incorporated elements of each model into its final\ndesegregation plan, adopted in December 1977 and known as\nthe “Seattle Plan.” The Seattle Plan divided the district into\nzones, within which majority-dominated elementary schools\nwere paired with minority-dominated elementary schools to\nachieve desegregation. Mandatory high school assignments\nwere linked to elementary school assignments, although vari-\nous voluntary transfer options were available. With the Seattle\nPlan,\n      Seattle became the first major city to adopt a com-\n      prehensive desegregation program voluntarily with-\n      out a court order. By doing so the District\n      maintained local control over its desegregation plan\n      and was able to adopt and implement a plan which\n      in the eyes of the District best met the needs of Seat-\n      tle students and the Seattle School District.\nHistory of Desegregation at 36-37. Opponents of the Seattle\nPlan immediately passed a state initiative to block its imple-\nmentation, but the Supreme Court ultimately declared the ini-\ntiative unconstitutional. Washington v. Seattle Sch. Dist. No.\n1, 458 U.S. 457, 470 (1982).\n   The Seattle Plan furthered the District’s school desegrega-\ntion goals, but its operation was unsatisfactory in other ways.4\nIn 1988, a decade after its implementation, the District aban-\ndoned the Seattle Plan and adopted a new plan that it referred\nto as “controlled choice.” Under the controlled choice plan,\nschools were grouped into clusters that met state and district\n  4\n    For example, the Seattle Plan was confusing, required mandatory bus-\ning of nonwhite students in disproportionate numbers, made facilities and\nenrollment planning difficult and contributed to “white flight” from the\ncity schools.

SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\ndesegregation guidelines, and families were permitted to rank\nschools within the relevant cluster, increasing the predictabil-\nity of assignments. Because of Seattle’s housing patterns, the\nDistrict’s planners explained that “it was impossible to fash-\nion clusters in a geographically contiguous manner”; some\ncluster schools were near students’ homes, but others were in\n“racially and culturally different neighborhoods.” Findings\nand Conclusions at 30-31. Although roughly 70 percent of\nstudents received their first choices, the controlled choice plan\nstill resulted in mandatory busing for 16 percent of the Dis-\ntrict’s students.\n   In 1994, the Board directed District staff to devise a new\nplan for all grade levels to simplify assignments, reduce costs\nand increase community satisfaction, among other things. The\nguiding factors were to be choice, diversity and predictability.\nStaff developed four basic options, including the then-existing\ncontrolled choice plan, a regional choice plan, a neighborhood\nassignment plan with a provision for voluntary, integration-\npositive transfers and an open choice plan.\n   Board members testified that they considered all the\noptions as they related to the District’s educational goals —\nwith special emphasis, at the secondary school level, on the\ngoals of choice and racial diversity. Neighborhood and\nregional plans were viewed as unduly limiting student choice,\non which the District placed high value because student\nchoice was seen to increase parental involvement in the\nschools and promote improvements in quality through a mar-\nketplace model. The District sought to maintain its commit-\nment to racially integrated education by establishing diversity\ngoals while moving away from the rigid desegregation guide-\nlines and mandatory assignments prevalent in the 1970s and\n1980s.\n   The Board adopted the current open choice plan (the\n“Plan”) for the 1998-99 school year. Under the Plan, students\nentering the ninth grade may select any high school in the\nDistrict. They are assigned, where possible, to the school they\nlist as their first choice. If too many students choose the same\n\f             PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.                14665\nschool as their first choice, resulting in “oversubscription,”\nthe District assigns students to each oversubscribed school\nbased on a series of tiebreakers. If a student is not admitted\nto his or her first choice school as a result of the tiebreakers,\nthe District tries to assign the student to his or her second\nchoice school, and so on. Students not assigned to one of their\nchosen schools are assigned to the closest school with space\navailable; students who list more choices are less likely to\nreceive one of these “mandatory” assignments. The most\nrecent version of the Plan, which the School Board reviews\nannually, is for the 2001-02 school year and is the subject of\nthis litigation.\n   B. The Plan\n   The District has sought to make each of its 10 high schools\nunique, with programs that respond to the continually chang-\ning needs of students and their parents. Indeed, the District\nimplemented the Plan as part of a comprehensive effort to\nimprove and equalize the attractiveness of all the high\nschools, including adoption of a weighted funding formula, a\nfacilities plan and a new teacher contract that would make\nteacher transfers easier. Nevertheless, the high schools vary\nwidely in desirability. Three of the northern schools — Bal-\nlard, Nathan Hale and Roosevelt — and two of the southern\nschools — Garfield and Franklin — are highly desirable and\noversubscribed, meaning that more students wish to attend\nthose schools than capacity allows.5 The magnitude of the\n  5\n   The current popularity of Ballard High School is illustrative of the con-\nstantly changing dynamic of Seattle’s public high schools. In the fall of\n1999, Ballard moved to a new facility under the leadership of a new prin-\ncipal. Prior to the move, Ballard was not oversubscribed; now it is one of\nthe most popular high schools in Seattle.\n   Similarly, the popularity and demographics of Nathan Hale High School\nchanged significantly when it acquired a new principal who instituted a\nnumber of academic innovations, including joining the “Coalition of\nEssential Schools” and instituting a “Ninth Grade Academy” and “Tenth\nGrade Integrated Studies Program.” Prior to 1998, Nathan Hale, a north\narea high school, was not oversubscribed, and the student body was pre-\ndominantly nonwhite. Starting in 1998, the high school began to have a\nwaitlist, and more white students, who had previously passed on Nathan\nHale, wanted to go there. As a result, the number of nonwhite students\ndeclined dramatically between 1995 and 2000.\n\f14666       PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\noversubscription is noteworthy: For the academic year 2000-\n01, approximately 82 percent of students selected one of the\noversubscribed schools as their first choice, while only about\n18 percent picked one of the undersubscribed high schools as\ntheir first choice. Only when oversubscription occurs does the\nDistrict become involved in the assignment process.\n   If a high school is oversubscribed, all students applying for\nninth grade are admitted according to a series of four tie-\nbreakers, applied in the following order: First, students who\nhave a sibling attending that school are admitted. In any given\noversubscribed school, the sibling tiebreaker accounts for\nsomewhere between 15 to 20 percent of the admissions to the\nninth grade class.\n   Second, if an oversubscribed high school is racially imbal-\nanced — meaning that the racial make up of its student body\ndiffers by more than 15 percent from the racial make up of the\nstudents of the Seattle public schools as a whole — and if the\nsibling preference does not bring the oversubscribed high\nschool within plus or minus 15 percent of the District’s demo-\ngraphics, the race-based tiebreaker is “triggered” and the race\nof the applying student is considered. (For the purposes of the\nrace-based tiebreaker, a student is deemed to be of the race\nspecified in his or her registration materials.) Thus, if a school\nhas more than 75 percent nonwhite students (i.e., more than\n15 percent above the overall 60 percent nonwhite student pop-\nulation) and less than 25 percent white students, or when it\nhas less than 45 percent nonwhite students (i.e., more than 15\npercent below the overall 60 percent nonwhite student popula-\ntion) and more than 55 percent white students, the school is\nconsidered racially imbalanced.\n   Originally, schools that deviated by more than 10 percent\nwere deemed racially imbalanced. For the 2001-02 school\nyear, however, the triggering number was increased to 15 per-\ncent, softening the effect of the tiebreaker.6 For that year, the\n  6\n   Although the record reflects the general effects of the tiebreaker in\n2001-02, it does not include the specific number of students affected by\n\f            PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.              14667\nrace-based tiebreaker was used in assigning entering ninth\ngrade students only to three oversubscribed schools — Bal-\nlard, Franklin and Nathan Hale. Accordingly, in seven of the\n10 public high schools in 2001-02, race was not relevant in\nmaking admissions decisions.\n   The race-based tiebreaker is applied to both white and non-\nwhite students. For example, in the 2000-01 school year —\nwhen the trigger point was still plus or minus 10 percent —\n89 more white students were assigned to Franklin than would\nhave been assigned absent the tiebreaker, 107 more nonwhite\nstudents were assigned to Ballard than would have been\nassigned absent the tiebreaker, 82 more nonwhite students\nwere assigned to Roosevelt than would have been assigned\nabsent the tiebreaker and 27 more nonwhite students were\nassigned to Nathan Hale than would have been assigned\nabsent the tiebreaker.7 These assignments accounted for about\n10 percent of admissions to Seattle’s high schools as a whole.\nThat is, of the approximately 3,000 incoming students enter-\ning Seattle high schools in the 2000-01 school year, approxi-\nmately 300 were assigned to an oversubscribed high school\nbased on the race-based tiebreaker.\n\n   In addition to changing the trigger point for the 2001-02\nschool year to plus or minus 15 percent, the District also\ndeveloped a “thermostat,” whereby the tiebreaker is applied to\nthe entering ninth grade student population only until it comes\nwithin the 15 percent plus or minus variance. Once that point\n\nthe tiebreaker in the three oversubscribed schools where the tiebreaker\napplied. The record, however, does include these numbers for the 2000-01\nschool year. Although the tiebreaker operated differently in 2000-01, and\napplied to four schools rather than three, the 2000-01 numbers illustrate\nthe general operation of the tiebreaker.\n   7\n     The Board’s decision to change the trigger point for use of the tie-\nbreaker from plus or minus 10 percent to plus or minus 15 percent, how-\never, had the effect of rendering Roosevelt High School neutral for\ndesegregation purposes. Thus, the tiebreaker did not factor into assign-\nments to Roosevelt High School in the 2001-02 school year.\n\f14668      PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\nis reached, the District “turns-off” the race-based tiebreaker,\nand there is no further consideration of a student’s race in the\nassignment process. The tiebreaker does not apply, and race\nis not considered, for students entering a high school after the\nninth grade (e.g., by transfer).\n\n   As demonstrated in the chart below, the District estimates\nthat without the race-based tiebreaker, the nonwhite popula-\ntions of the 2000-01 ninth grade class at Franklin would have\nbeen 79.2 percent, at Hale 30.5 percent, at Ballard 33 percent\nand at Roosevelt 41.1 percent. Using the race-based tie-\nbreaker, the actual nonwhite populations of the ninth grade\nclasses at the same schools respectively were 59.5 percent,\n40.6 percent, 54.2 percent and 55.3 percent.\n\n          2000-01 DIFFERENCE IN PERCENTAGES OF\n           NONWHITE STUDENTS IN NINTH GRADE\n             WITH AND WITHOUT TIEBREAKER\n\n\n\n    SCHOOL         WITHOUT           WITH           PERCENT\n                  TIEBREAKER      TIEBREAKER       Difference\n\n    FRANKLIN          79.2            59.5            −19.7\n\n NATHAN HALE          30.5            40.6            +10.1\n\n    BALLARD           33.0            54.2            +21.2\n\n   ROOSEVELT          41.1            55.3            +14.2\n\n\n   In the third tiebreaker, students are admitted according to\ndistance from the student’s home to the high school.

In any given\noversubscribed school, the distance-based tiebreaker accounts\nfor between 70 to 75 percent of admissions to the ninth grade.\n\n  In the fourth tiebreaker, a lottery is used to allocate the\nremaining seats. Because the distance tiebreaker serves to\n\f             PARENTS INVOLVED v.

Procedural History\n\n   Parents Involved in Community Schools (“Parents”), a\ngroup of parents whose children were not, or might not be,\nassigned to the high schools of their choice under the Plan,\nclaimed that the District’s use of the race-based tiebreaker for\nhigh school admissions is illegal under the Washington Civil\nRights Act (“Initiative 200”),8 the Equal Protection Clause of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment9 and Title VI of the Civil Rights\nAct of 1964.10\n\n   Both Parents and the District moved for summary judgment\non all claims.

Strict Scrutiny\n\n   [1] We review racial classifications under the strict scrutiny\nstandard, which requires that the policy in question be nar-\nrowly tailored to achieve a compelling state interest. See\nJohnson v. California, 125 S. Ct. 1141, 1146 (2005); Grutter,\n539 U.S. at 326; Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515\nU.S. 200, 226-27 (1995).12 The strict scrutiny standard is not\n  11\n      We review the district court’s resolution of cross-motions for sum-\nmary judgment de novo. United States v. City of Tacoma, 332 F.3d 574,\n578 (9th Cir. 2003).\n   12\n      Judge Kozinski’s concurrence makes a powerful case for adopting a\nless stringent standard of review here because the Plan does not attempt\n\f             PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.                  14671\n“strict in theory, but fatal in fact.” Adarand, 515 U.S. at 237\n(internal quotation marks omitted). “Although all governmen-\ntal uses of race are subject to strict scrutiny, not all are invali-\ndated by it.” Grutter, 539 U.S. at 326-27. We employ strict\n\nto “benefit[ ] or burden[ ] any particular group;” therefore it “carries none\nof the baggage the Supreme Court has found objectionable” in earlier\nequal protection cases. Kozinski, J., concurring, infra at 14712 and 14716.\nRecognizing the importance of context in the Supreme Court’s equal pro-\ntection jurisprudence, Judge Kozinski proposes “robust and realistic”\nrational basis rather than strict scrutiny review. Id. at 4. Cf. Coalition for\nEconomic Equity v. Wilson, 122 F.3d 692, 708 n.16 (9th Cir. 1997) (“We\nhave recognized . . . that ‘stacked deck’ programs trench on Fourteenth\nAmendment values in ways that ‘reshuffle’ programs do not. Unlike racial\npreference programs, school desegregation programs are not inherently\ninvidious, do not work wholly to the benefit of certain members of one\ngroup and correspondingly to the harm of certain members of another\ngroup, and do not deprive citizens of rights.”) (internal quotation marks,\nalterations and citations omitted).\n   Nonetheless, the Supreme Court in Johnson v. California, 125 S. Ct.\n1141 (2005), rejected the argument that a California Department of Cor-\nrections (“CDC”) policy in which all inmates were segregated by race\nshould be subjected to relaxed scrutiny because the policy “neither bene-\nfits nor burdens one group or individual more than any other group or\nindividual.” Id. at 1147 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also id. at\n1146 (noting that all racial classifications “raise special fears that they are\nmotivated by an invidious purpose” and that “[a]bsent searching judicial\ninquiry into the justification for such race-based measures, there is simply\nno way of determining . . . what classifications are in fact motivated by\nillegitimate notions of racial inferiority or simple racial politics” (internal\nquotation marks and citation omitted)). As Judge Kozinski aptly notes,\nJohnson is not entirely analogous to the instant case because the CDC seg-\nregated inmates on the basis of race, whereas the District’s use of race is\naimed at achieving the opposite result — attaining and maintaining inte-\ngrated schools. Kozinski, J., concurring, infra. at 14712. Nevertheless, like\nthe First and Sixth Circuits — the only other circuits to rule, post-Grutter\nand Gratz, on the constitutionality of a voluntary plan designed to achieve\nthe benefits of racial diversity in the public secondary school setting — we\nconclude that the Plan must be reviewed under strict scrutiny. See Comfort\nv. Lynn School Committee, 418 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2005) (en banc);\nMcFarland v. Jefferson County Public Schools, 416 F.3d 513, 514 (6th\nCir. 2005) (per curiam).\n\f14672      PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\nscrutiny to “smoke out” impermissible uses of race by ensur-\ning that the government is pursuing a goal important enough\nto warrant use of a highly suspect tool. Id. at 327 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). This heightened standard of review\nprovides a framework for carefully examining the importance\nand the sincerity of the reasons advanced by the governmental\ndecisionmaker for the use of race in that particular context.\nSmith v. Univ. of Washington, 392 F.3d 367, 372 (9th Cir.\n2004). In evaluating the District’s Plan under strict scrutiny,\nwe also bear in mind the Court’s directive that “[c]ontext mat-\nters when reviewing race-based governmental action under\nthe Equal Protection Clause.” Grutter, 539 U.S. at 326.\n\n  B. Compelling State Interest\n\n   Under strict scrutiny, a government action will not survive\nunless motivated by a “compelling state interest.” See id. at\n325, 327. Because strict scrutiny requires us to evaluate the\n“fit” between the government’s means and its ends, Wygant\nv. Jackson Bd. of Educ., 476 U.S. 267, 280 n.6 (1986), it is\ncritical to identify precisely the governmental interests — the\nends — to which the government’s use of race must fit. See\nUnited States v. Paradise, 480 U.S. 149, 171 (1987) (stating\nthat, in order to determine whether an order was narrowly tai-\nlored, “we must examine the purposes the order was intended\nto serve”).\n\n   [2] Although the Supreme Court has never decided a case\ninvolving the consideration of race in a voluntarily imposed\nschool assignment plan intended to promote racially and eth-\nnically diverse secondary schools, its decisions regarding\nselective admissions to institutions of higher learning demon-\nstrate that one compelling reason for considering race is to\nachieve the educational benefits of diversity. The compelling\ninterest that the Court recognized in Grutter was the promo-\ntion of the specific educational and societal benefits that flow\nfrom diversity. See Grutter, 539 U.S. at 330 (noting that the\nlaw school’s concept of critical mass must be “defined by ref-\n\f             PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.                   14673\nerence to the educational benefits that diversity is designed to\nproduce”). In evaluating the relevance of diversity to higher\neducation, the Court focused principally on two benefits that\na diverse student body provides: (1) the learning advantages\nof having diverse viewpoints represented in the “robust\nexchange of ideas” that is critical to the mission of higher\neducation, id. at 329-30; and (2) the greater societal legiti-\nmacy that institutions of higher learning enjoy by cultivating\na group of national leaders who are representative of our\ncountry’s diversity, id. at 332-33. The Court also mentioned\nthe role of diversity in challenging stereotypes. Id. at 330,\n333. The Court largely deferred to the law school’s educa-\ntional judgment not only in determining that diversity would\nproduce these benefits, but also in determining that these ben-\nefits were critical to the school’s educational mission. Id. at\n328-33.13\n\n   Against this background, we consider the specific interests\nthat the District’s Plan seeks to advance. These interests are\narticulated in the “Board Statement Reaffirming Diversity\nRationale” as:\n\n     Diversity in the classroom increases the likelihood\n     that students will discuss racial or ethnic issues and\n     be more likely to socialize with people of different\n   13\n      The Court also heeded the judgment of amici curiae — including edu-\ncators, business leaders and the military — that the educational benefits\nthat flow from diversity constitute a compelling interest. Grutter, 539 U.S.\nat 330 (“The Law School’s claim of a compelling interest is further bol-\nstered by its amici, who point to the educational benefits that flow from\nstudent body diversity.”); see also id. (“These benefits are not theoretical\nbut real, as major American businesses have made clear that the skills\nneeded in today’s increasingly global marketplace can only be developed\nthrough exposure to widely diverse people, cultures, ideas, and view-\npoints.”); id. at 331 (“[H]igh-ranking retired officers and civilian leaders\nof the United States military assert that, ‘[b]ased on [their] decades of\nexperience,’ a ‘highly qualified, racially diverse officer corps . . . is essen-\ntial to the military’s ability to fulfill its principle mission to provide\nnational security.’ ”).\n\f14674      PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\n    races. Diversity is thus a valuable resource for teach-\n    ing students to become citizens in a multi-racial/\n    multi-ethnic world.\n\n    Providing students the opportunity to attend schools\n    with diverse student enrollment also has inherent\n    educational value from the standpoint of education’s\n    role in a democratic society . . . . Diversity brings\n    different viewpoints and experiences to classroom\n    discussions and thereby enhances the educational\n    process. It also fosters racial and cultural understand-\n    ing, which is particularly important in a racially and\n    culturally diverse society such as ours.\n\n    The District’s commitment to the diversity of its\n    schools and to the ability to voluntarily avoid\n    racially concentrating enrollment patterns also helps\n    ensure that all students have access to those schools,\n    faculties, course offerings, and resources that will\n    enable them to reach their full potential.\n\n    Based on the foregoing rationale, the Seattle School\n    District’s commitment is that no student should be\n    required to attend a racially concentrated school. The\n    District is also committed to providing students with\n    the opportunity to voluntarily choose to attend a\n    school to promote integration. The District provides\n    these opportunities for students to attend a racially\n    and ethnically diverse school, and to assist in the\n    voluntary integration of a school, because it believes\n    that providing a diverse learning environment is edu-\n    cationally beneficial for all students.\n\n   The District’s interests fit into two broad categories: (1) the\nDistrict seeks the affirmative educational and social benefits\nthat flow from racial diversity; and (2) the District seeks to\navoid the harms resulting from racially concentrated or iso-\nlated schools.\n\f             PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.                14675\n  1. Educational and Social Benefits that Flow from\n  Diversity\n\n   [3] The District has established that racial diversity pro-\nduces a number of compelling educational and social benefits\nin secondary education. First, the District presented expert\ntestimony that in racially diverse schools, “both white and\nminority students experienced improved critical thinking\nskills — the ability to both understand and challenge views\nwhich are different from their own.”\n\n   [4] Second, the District demonstrated the socialization and\ncitizenship advantages of racially diverse schools. School\nofficials, relying on their experience as teachers and adminis-\ntrators, and the District’s expert all explained these benefits\non the record. According to the District’s expert, the social\nscience research “clearly and consistently shows that, for both\nwhite and minority students, a diverse educational experience\nresults in improvement in race-relations, the reduction of prej-\nudicial attitudes, and the achievement of a more . . . inclusive\nexperience for all citizens . . . . The research further shows\nthat only a desegregated and diverse school can offer such\nopportunities and benefits. The research further supports the\nproposition that these benefits are long lasting.” (Emphasis\nadded.) Even Parents’ expert conceded that “[t]here is general\nagreement by both experts and the general public that integra-\ntion is a desirable policy goal mainly for the social benefit of\nincreased information and understanding about the cultural\nand social differences among various racial and ethnic\ngroups.”14 That is, diversity encourages students not only to\nthink critically but also democratically.\n   14\n      Academic research has shown that intergroup contact reduces preju-\ndice and supports the values of citizenship. See Derek Black, Comment,\nThe Case for the New Compelling Government Interest: Improving Educa-\ntional Outcomes, 80 N.C. L. Rev. 923, 951-52 (2002) (collecting academic\nresearch demonstrating that interpersonal interaction in desegregated\nschools reduces racial prejudice and stereotypes, improving students’ citi-\nzenship values and their ability to succeed in a racially diverse society in\ntheir adult lives).\n\f14676        PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\n   Third, the District’s expert noted that “research shows that\na[ ] desegregated educational experience opens opportunity\nnetworks in areas of higher education and employment . . .\n[and] strongly shows that graduates of desegregated high\nschools are more likely to live in integrated communities than\nthose who do not, and are more likely to have cross-race\nfriendships later in life.”15\n\n   The District’s interests in the educational and social bene-\nfits of diversity are similar to those of a law school as articu-\nlated in Grutter. The contextual differences between public\nhigh schools and universities, however, make the District’s\ninterests compelling in a similar but also significantly differ-\nent manner. See Grutter, 539 U.S. at 330 (noting that the\ncompelling state interest in diversity is judged in relation to\nthe educational benefits that it seeks to produce).\n\n   [5] The Supreme Court in Grutter noted the importance of\nhigher education in “preparing students for work and citizen-\nship.” 539 U.S. at 331. For a number of reasons, public sec-\nondary schools have an equal if not more important role in\nthis preparation. First, underlying the history of desegregation\nin this country is a legal regime that recognizes the principle\nthat public secondary education serves a unique and vital\nsocialization function in our democratic society. As the Court\nexplained in Plyler v. Doe, “[w]e have recognized the public\nschools as a most vital civic institution for the preservation of\n   15\n      The District’s compelling interests in diversity have been endorsed by\nCongress. In the Magnet Schools Assistance Act, Congress found that “It\nis in the best interests of the United States — (A) to continue the Federal\nGovernment’s support of local educational agencies that are voluntarily\nseeking to foster meaningful interaction among students of different racial\nand ethnic backgrounds, beginning at the earliest stages of such students’\neducation; (B) to ensure that all students have equitable access to a high\nquality education that will prepare all students to function well in a tech-\nnologically oriented and a highly competitive economy comprised of peo-\nple from many different racial and ethnic backgrounds.” 20 U.S.C.\n§ 7231(a)(4) (emphasis added).\n\f            PARENTS INVOLVED v.

Dist. No. 403 v. Fraser, 478\nU.S. 675, 683 (1986) (stating that the inculcation of civic val-\nues is “truly the work of the schools”) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)); Plyler, 457 U.S. at 221-23 (noting that pub-\nlic education perpetuates the political system and the eco-\nnomic and social advancement of citizens and that “education\nhas a fundamental role in maintaining the fabric of our soci-\nety”); Ambach v. Norwick, 441 U.S. 68, 76-77 (1979) (observ-\ning that public schools transmit to children “the values on\nwhich our society rests,” including “fundamental values nec-\nessary to the maintenance of a democratic political system”);\nBrown v. Bd. of Educ., 347 U.S. 483, 493 (1954)\n(“[Education] is required in the performance of our most basic\npublic responsibilities . . . . It is the very foundation of good\ncitizenship. Today it is a principal instrument in awakening\nthe child to cultural values, in preparing him for later profes-\nsional training, and in helping him to adjust normally to his\nenvironment.”). Under Washington law, such civic training is\nmandated by the state constitution: “Our constitution is\nunique in placing paramount value on education for citizen-\nship.” Parents IV, 72 P.3d at 158.\n\n   [6] Second, although one hopes that all students who gradu-\nate from Seattle’s public schools would have the opportunity\nto attend institutions of higher learning if they so desire, a\nsubstantial number of Seattle’s public high school graduates\ndo not attend college.16 For these students, their public high\nschool educational experience will be their sole opportunity to\nreap the benefits of a diverse learning environment. We reject\nthe notion that only those students who leave high school and\n  16\n     According to the Seattle Times’ School Guide submitted by Parents,\nfor the year 2000, on average 34 percent of Seattle’s high school graduates\nattend four-year colleges after graduation and 38.2 percent attend two-year\ncolleges, although percentages vary from high school to high school.\n\f14678      PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\nenter the elite world of higher education should garner the\nbenefits that flow from learning in a diverse classroom.\nIndeed, it would be a perverse reading of the Equal Protection\nClause that would allow a university, educating a relatively\nsmall percentage of the population, to use race when choosing\nits student body but not allow a public school district, educat-\ning all children attending its schools, to consider a student’s\nrace in order to ensure that the high schools within the district\nattain and maintain diverse student bodies.\n\n   [7] Third, the public school context involves students who,\nbecause they are younger and more impressionable, are more\namenable to the benefits of diversity. See Comfort, 418 F.3d\nat 15-16 (“In fact, there is significant evidence in the record\nthat the benefits of a racially diverse school are more compel-\nling at younger ages.”); Comfort v. Lynn School Committee,\n283 F. Supp. 2d 328, 356 (D. Mass. 2003) (noting expert testi-\nmony describing racial stereotyping as a “ ‘habit of mind’ that\nis difficult to break once it forms” and explaining that “[i]t is\nmore difficult to teach racial tolerance to college-age students;\nthe time to do it is when the students are still young, before\nthey are locked into racialized thinking”); see also Goodwin\nLiu, Brown, Bollinger, and Beyond, 47 How. L.J. 705, 755\n(2004) (“[I]f ‘diminishing the force of [racial] stereotypes’ is\na compelling pedagogical interest in elite higher education, it\ncan only be more so in elementary and secondary schools —\nfor the very premise of Grutter’s diversity rationale is that\nstudents enter higher education having had too few opportuni-\nties in early grades to study and learn alongside peers from\nother racial groups.”) (citing Grutter, 539 U.S. at 333)\n(emphasis added)).\n\n   The dissent insists that racial diversity in a public high\nschool is not a compelling interest, arguing that Grutter\nendorsed a law school’s compelling interest in diversity only\nin some broader or more holistic sense. Bea, J., dissenting,\ninfra. at 14726-27. To attain this broader interest, the dissent\ncontends, the District may only consider race along with other\n\f           PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.        14679\nattributes such as socioeconomic status, ability to speak multi-\nple languages or extracurricular talents. We read Grutter,\nhowever, to recognize that racial diversity, not some proxy for\nit, is valuable in and of itself. 539 U.S. at 330 (discussing the\n“substantial” benefits that flow from a racially diverse student\nbody and citing several sources that detail the impact of racial\ndiversity in the educational environment).\n\n  [8] In short, the District has demonstrated that it has a com-\npelling interest in the educational and social benefits of racial\ndiversity similar to those articulated by the Supreme Court in\nGrutter as well as the additional compelling educational and\nsocial benefits of such diversity unique to the public second-\nary school context.\n\n  2. Avoiding the Harms Resulting               from    Racially\n  Concentrated or Isolated Schools\n\n   [9] The District’s interest in achieving the affirmative bene-\nfits of a racially diverse educational environment has a flip\nside: avoiding racially concentrated or isolated schools. In\nparticular, the District is concerned with making the educa-\ntional benefits of a diverse learning environment available to\nall its students and ensuring that “no student should be\nrequired to attend a racially concentrated school.” See “Board\nStatement Reaffirming Diversity Rationale,” quoted supra p.\n14674. Research regarding desegregation has found that\nracially concentrated or isolated schools are characterized by\nmuch higher levels of poverty, lower average test scores,\nlower levels of student achievement, with less-qualified teach-\ners and fewer advanced courses — “[w]ith few exceptions,\nseparate schools are still unequal schools.” See Erica Franken-\nberg et al., A Multiracial Society with Segregated Schools:\nAre We Losing the Dream? 11 (The Civil Rights Project, Har-\nvard Univ. Jan. 2003), at http://www.civilrightsproject.\nharvard.edu/research/reseg03/AreWeLosingtheDream.pdf)\n(hereinafter “Civil Rights Project”) (last visited October 11,\n\f14680        PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\n2005) (cited in Grutter, 539 U.S. at 345 (Ginsburg, J., concur-\nring)).\n\n   [10] In Seattle, the threat of having to attend a racially con-\ncentrated or isolated school is not a theoretical or imagined prob-\nlem.17 As the district court found, the District “established that\nhousing patterns in Seattle continue to be racially concentrat-\ned,” and would result in racially concentrated or isolated\nschools if school assignments were based solely on a stu-\ndent’s neighborhood or proximity to a particular high school.\nParents I, 137 F. Supp. 2d at 1235. Accordingly, the District’s\nPlan strives to ensure that patterns of residential segregation\nare not replicated in the District’s school assignments. Cf.\nComfort, 418 F.3d at 29 (“The problem is that in Lynn, as in\nmany other cities, minorities and whites often live in different\nneighborhoods. Lynn’s aim is to preserve local schools as an\noption without having the housing pattern of de facto segrega-\ntion projected into the school system.”) (Boudin, C.J., concur-\nring). Although Parents make much of the fact that “Seattle\nhas never operated a segregated school system,” and allege\nthat “this is not a school desegregation case,” each court to\nreview the matter has concluded that because of Seattle’s\nhousing patterns, high schools in Seattle would be highly seg-\nregated absent race conscious measures. See Parents I, 137 F.\nSupp. 2d at 1237; Parents II, 285 F.3d at 1239-40; Parents\nIII, 294 F.3d at 1088; Parents IV, 72 P.3d at 153.\n\n   [11] The district court found that, “[t]he circumstances that\ngave rise to the court-approved school assignment policies of\nthe 1970s [e.g., Seattle’s segregated housing patterns] con-\ntinue to be as compelling today as they were in the days of the\n  17\n     The prospect of children across the nation being required to attend\nracially concentrated or isolated schools is a crisis that school boards, dis-\ntricts, teachers and parents confront daily.

See\nComfort, 418 F.3d at 14 (holding that the “negative conse-\nquences of racial isolation that Lynn seeks to avoid and the\nbenefits of diversity that it hopes to achieve” constituted com-\npelling interests); Brewer v.

Dist.,\n212 F.3d 738, 752 (2d Cir. 2000) (holding that “a compelling\ninterest can be found in a program that has as its object the\nreduction of racial isolation and what appears to be de facto\nsegregation”), superseded on other grounds as stated in Zer-\nvos v. Verizon N.Y., Inc., 252 F.3d 163, 171 n.7 (2d Cir.\n2001); Parent Ass’n of Andrew Jackson High Sch. v.

SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\nschool districts have a compelling interest in ameliorating\nreal, identifiable de facto racial segregation.\n\n   [12] The dissent, however, contends first that the District is\nnot “desegregating” but rather is engaged in racial balancing.\nBea, J., dissenting, infra. at 14718. Further, for the dissent,\nsegregation requires a state actor intentionally to separate the\nraces; and in the absence of such offensive state conduct, the\nSupreme Court cases detailing the remedies for Fourteenth\nAmendment violations are of no relevance. Bea, J., dissent-\ning, infra. at 14738-39, n.17. Thus, without a court finding of\nde jure segregation the elected school board members of the\nDistrict may not take voluntary, affirmative steps towards cre-\nating a racially diverse student body. We disagree. The fact\nthat de jure segregation is particularly offensive to our Consti-\ntution does not diminish the real harms of separation of the\nraces by other means. “Segregation of white and colored chil-\ndren in public schools has a detrimental effect upon the col-\nored children. The impact is greater when it has the sanction\nof law. . . .” Brown v. Bd. of Educ., 347 U.S. 483, 494 (1954)\n(emphasis added). The benefits that flow from integration (or\ndesegregation) exist whether or not a state actor was responsi-\nble for the earlier racial isolation. Brown’s statement that “in\nthe field of public education . . . [s]eparate educational facili-\nties are inherently unequal” retains its validity today. Id. at\n495. The District is entitled to seek the benefits of racial inte-\ngration and avoid the harms of segregation even in the\nabsence of a court order deeming it a violator of the U.S. Con-\nstitution.\n\n   [13] Support for this conclusion comes from statements in\nthe Supreme Court’s school desegregation cases, which\nrepeatedly refer to the voluntary integration of schools as\nsound educational policy within the discretion of local school\nofficials.19 See Swann v.

SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\n  C. Narrow Tailoring\n\n   We must next determine whether the District’s use of the\nrace-based tiebreaker is narrowly tailored to achieve its com-\npelling interests. See Grutter, 539 U.S. at 333. The narrow\ntailoring inquiry is intended to “ ‘smoke out’ illegitimate uses\nof race” by ensuring that the government’s classification is\nclosely fitted to the compelling goals that it seeks to achieve.\nRichmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 493 (1989).\nHere, our analysis is framed by the Court’s narrow tailoring\nanalysis in Grutter and Gratz, which, though informed by\nconsiderations specific to the higher education context, sub-\nstantially guides our inquiry. See Grutter, 539 U.S. at 334\n(stating that the narrow tailoring inquiry is context-specific\nand must be “calibrated to fit the distinct issues raised” in a\ngiven case, taking “relevant differences into account”) (inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted).\n\n  In Gratz, the Court held unconstitutional the University of\nMichigan’s undergraduate admissions program, which auto-\nmatically assigned 20 points on the admissions scale to an\napplicant from an underrepresented racial or ethnic minority\ngroup. 539 U.S. at 255, 272. In Grutter, by contrast, the Court\nupheld the University of Michigan Law School’s admissions\npolicy, which took race into account as one of several vari-\nables in an individual’s application. 539 U.S. at 315-16, 340.\nThe law school’s policy also attempted to ensure that a “criti-\ncal mass” of underrepresented minority students would be\nadmitted in order to realize the benefits of a diverse student\nbody.20 Id. at 316.\n\n   [15] In its analysis, the Court identified five hallmarks of\n  20\n     The Court explained that “critical mass” was defined by the law\nschool as “meaningful numbers” or “meaningful representation,” or “a\nnumber that encourages underrepresented minority students to participate\nin the classroom and not feel isolated.” Grutter, 539 U.S. at 318 (internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n\f           PARENTS INVOLVED v.

Smith v. Univ. of\nWashington, 392 F.3d 367, 373 (9th Cir. 2004); Comfort, 418\nF.3d at 17 (characterizing Grutter as outlining a “four-part\nnarrow tailoring inquiry”).\n\n   Hallmarks two through five are applicable here despite sig-\nnificant differences between the competitive admissions plans\nat issue in Gratz and Grutter and the District’s high school\nassignment Plan. The first hallmark, however, is less relevant\nto our analysis because of the contextual differences between\ninstitutions of higher learning and public high schools.\n\n  1. Individualized, Holistic Consideration of Applicants\n\n  a. An applicant’s qualifications\n\n   In the context of university admissions, where applicants\ncompete for a limited number of spaces in a class, the Court\nin Grutter and Gratz focused its inquiry on the role race may\nplay in judging an applicant’s qualifications. The Court’s\nunderlying concern was that the “admissions policy is flexible\nenough to consider all pertinent elements of diversity in light\nof the particular qualifications of each applicant, and to place\nthem on the same footing for consideration, although not nec-\nessarily according them the same weight.” Grutter, 539 U.S.\nat 337 (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted);\nsee Adarand, 515 U.S. at 211 (“The injury in cases of this\nkind is that a discriminatory classification prevent[s] the\nplaintiff from competing on an equal footing.”) (emphasis\nadded) (internal quotation marks omitted). The focus on fair\ncompetition is due, in part, to the stigma that may attach if\nsome individuals are viewed as unable to achieve success\nwithout special protection. See Regents of Univ. of Cal. v.\n\f14686        PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\nBakke, 438 U.S. 265, 298 (1978) (Powell, J., concurring)\n(“preferential programs may only reinforce common stereo-\ntypes holding that certain groups are unable to achieve suc-\ncess without special protection based on a factor having no\nrelationship to individual worth”); Croson, 488 U.S. at 493\n(“Classifications based on race carry a danger of stigmatic\nharm. Unless they are strictly reserved for remedial settings,\nthey may in fact promote notions of racial inferiority and lead\nto a politics of racial hostility.”).\n\n   In Grutter and Gratz, in order to prevent race from being\nused as a mechanical proxy for an applicant’s qualifications,\nthe Court required individualized, holistic consideration of\neach applicant across a broad range of factors (of which race\nmay be but one). Grutter, 539 U.S. at 336-37; see Gratz, 539\nU.S. at 272 (holding that the undergraduate admissions policy\nwas not narrowly tailored because the “automatic distribution\nof 20 points has the effect of making ‘the factor of race . . .\ndecisive’ for virtually every minimally qualified underrepre-\nsented minority applicant”) (emphasis added). This focus on\nan applicant’s qualifications — whether these qualifications\nare such things as an applicant’s test scores, grades, artistic or\nathletic ability, musical talent or life experience — is not\napplicable when there is no competition or consideration of\nqualifications at issue.\n\n   [16] All of Seattle’s high school students must and will be\nplaced in a Seattle public school.21 Students’ relative qualifi-\ncations are irrelevant because regardless of their academic\nachievement, sports or artistic ability, musical talent or life\n  21\n     Parents do not claim that their children have a right to attend a particu-\nlar school, nor could they. See Bustop Inc., 439 U.S. at 1383 (rejecting any\nlegally protected right to have children attend their nearest school). In any\ncase, under the current Plan, all students can attend a school close to their\nhome. Because there are multiple schools in the north and south of Seattle,\nstudents for whom proximity is a priority may elect as their first choice\none of the schools in their residential area that is not oversubscribed and\nbe guaranteed an assignment to that school.\n\f               PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.             14687\nexperience, any student who wants to attend Seattle’s public\nhigh schools is entitled to an assignment; no assignment to\nany of the District’s high schools is tethered to a student’s\nqualifications. Thus, no stigma results from any particular\nschool assignment.22 Accordingly, the dangers that are present\nin the university context — of substituting racial preference\nfor qualification-based competition — are absent here. See\nComfort, 418 F.3d at 18 (“Because transfers under the Lynn\nPlan are not tied to merit, the Plan’s use of race does not risk\nimposing stigmatic harm by fueling the stereotype that ‘cer-\ntain groups are unable to achieve success without special pro-\ntection.’ ”) (quoting Bakke, 438 U.S. at 298).\n\n  b. Differences in compelling interests\n\n   The Court’s requirement of individualized, holistic review\nin Grutter is also more relevant to the compelling interest\nadvanced by the law school (“the robust exchange of ideas”\nfostered by viewpoint diversity) than it is to the District’s\n(racial diversity and avoiding racially concentrated or isolated\nschools). See Grutter, 539 U.S. at 337. The Court noted that\nthe law school did not “limit in any way . . . the broad range\nof qualities and experiences that may be considered valuable\ncontributions to student body diversity.” Id. at 338. To this\nend, the law school’s policy made clear that “[t]here are many\npossible bases for diversity admissions, and provide[d] exam-\nples of admittees who have lived or traveled widely abroad,\nare fluent in several languages, have overcome personal\n  22\n    In Bakke, Justice Powell noted:\n       Respondent’s position is wholly dissimilar to that of a pupil\n       bused from his neighborhood school to a comparable school in\n       another neighborhood in compliance with a desegregation decree.\n       Petitioner did not arrange for respondent to attend a different\n       medical school in order to desegregate Davis Medical School;\n       instead, it denied him admission and may have deprived him alto-\n       gether of a medical education.\n438 U.S. at 301 n.39.\n\f14688        PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\nadversity and family hardship, have exceptional records of\nextensive community service, and had successful careers in\nother fields.” Id. (internal quotation marks and citations omit-\nted). These multiple bases for diversity ensure the “classroom\ndiscussion is livelier, more spirited, and simply more enlight-\nening and interesting when the students have the greatest pos-\nsible variety of backgrounds.” Id. at 330 (internal citations\nomitted).\n\n   Although the District’s Plan, like the plan in Grutter, is\ndesigned to achieve the educational and social benefits of\ndiversity, including bringing “different viewpoints and experi-\nences to classroom discussions,” see “Statement Reaffirming\nDiversity Rationale,” viewpoint diversity in the law school\nand high school contexts serves different albeit overlapping\nends. In the law school setting, viewpoint diversity fosters the\n“robust exchange of ideas.” Grutter, 539 U.S. at 324; see\nComfort, 418 F.3d at 16 (“[L]ively classroom discussion is a\nmore central form of learning in law schools (which prefer the\nSocratic method) than in a K-12 setting.”). In the high school\ncontext, viewpoint diversity fosters racial and civic understand-\ning.23 For example, Eric Benson, the principal of Nathan Hale\nHigh School, one of the District’s most popular schools, testi-\nfied that as a result of racial diversity in the classroom, “stu-\ndents of different races and backgrounds tend to have\nsignificant interactions both in class, and outside of class.\nWhen I came to Nathan Hale, there were racial tensions in the\n   23\n      The dissent believes that “the educational benefits from diversity, if\nany, are much greater at the higher educational level because such benefits\nare greatly magnified by the learning that takes place outside the class-\nroom . . . .” Bea, J., dissenting, infra. at 14737. This belittles the substan-\ntial role of high school classroom discussions in contributing to the\neducational development of our young citizens. “The [high school] class-\nroom is peculiarly the marketplace of ideas. The Nation’s future depends\nupon leaders trained through wide exposure to that robust exchange of\nideas which discovers truth out of a multitude of tongues.” Tinker v. Des\nMoines Independent Community Sch. Dist., 393 U.S. 503, 512 (1969)\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\f           PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.        14689\nschool, reflected in fighting and disciplinary problems. These\nkind of problems have, to a large extent, disappeared.”\n\n   In addition, the law school takes other diversity factors,\nbesides race and ethnicity, into consideration in order to\nachieve its other compelling interest — cultivating a group of\nnational leaders. For example, extensive travel, fluency in for-\neign languages, extensive community service and successful\ncareers in other fields demonstrate that a candidate is some-\nhow exceptional or out of the ordinary. cf. Gratz, 539 U.S. at\n273 (disapproving of the undergraduate admissions plan, in\npart, because of its failure to consider whether an applicant\nwas extraordinary and noting that “[e]ven if [a] student[’s]\n‘extraordinary artistic talent’ rivaled that of Monet or Picasso,\nthe applicant would receive, at most, five points” as opposed\nto the automatic 20 points given to an applicant from an\nunderrepresented minority). In contrast, the District is\nrequired to educate all high school age children, both the\naverage and the extraordinary, regardless of individual leader-\nship potential.\n\n   [17] The District also has a second compelling interest that\nis absent from the university context — ensuring that its\nschool assignments do not replicate Seattle’s segregated hous-\ning patterns. The holistic review necessary to achieve view-\npoint diversity in the university context, across a broad range\nof factors (of which race may be but one), is not germane to\nthe District’s compelling interest in preventing racial concen-\ntration or racial isolation. Because race itself is the relevant\nconsideration when attempting to ameliorate de facto segrega-\ntion, the District’s tiebreaker must necessarily focus on the\nrace of its students. See Comfort, 418 F.3d at 18 (holding that\nwhen racial diversity is the compelling interest — “[t]he only\nrelevant criterion, then, is a student’s race; individualized con-\nsideration beyond that is irrelevant to the compelling inter-\nest”); Brewer v. W. Irondequoit Cent. Sch. Dist., 212 F.3d at\n752 (“If reducing racial isolation is — standing alone — a\nconstitutionally permissible goal, . . . then there is no more\n\f14690        PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\neffective means of achieving that goal than to base decisions\non race.”). We therefore conclude that if a noncompetitive,\nvoluntary student assignment plan is otherwise narrowly tai-\nlored, a district need not consider each student in a individual-\nized, holistic manner.24\n\n   The dissent insists that absent such individualized consider-\nation, the District’s plan cannot serve a compelling interest\nand is not narrowly tailored to protect individuals from group\nclassifications by race. Bea, J., dissenting, infra. at 14740.\nThis is a flawed reading of the Fourteenth Amendment.25 The\nDistrict’s compelling interest is to avoid the harms of racial\nisolation for all students in the Seattle school district. As we\nhave explained, to accomplish that objective the District may\nlook to the racial consequences of honoring the preferred\nchoices of individual students (and their parents). It is true\nthat for some students their first choice of school, based on\ngeographical proximity, will be denied because other stu-\ndents’ choices are granted in order to advance the overall\ninterest in maintaining racially diverse school enrollments.\nThe Fourteenth Amendment in this context does not preclude\nthe District from honoring racial diversity at the expense of\n  24\n      The dissent calculates that individualized consideration would be\nadministratively feasible because only 300 students would need to be con-\nsidered holistically. Though it is true that 300 students were subject to the\nrace-based tiebreaker, it does not follow that only those 300 would require\nindividualized consideration. Under the dissent’s view of the way the Dis-\ntrict should operate, all 3,000 students would have to be subject to holistic\nconsideration to determine their proper school assignment. Whether or not\nthis is administratively feasible is not clear in the record, but we believe\nit is ultimately irrelevant because individualized consideration is not\nrequired in the context presented here.\n   25\n      Reliance on group characteristics is not necessarily constitutionally\ninfirm under Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence. See, e.g., Kimel v.\nFlorida Bd. of Regents, 528 U.S. 62, 84 (2000) (“Under the Fourteenth\nAmendment, a State may rely on age as a proxy for other qualities, abili-\nties, or characteristics that are relevant to the State’s legitimate interests.\nThe Constitution does not preclude reliance on such generalizations. That\nage proves to be an inaccurate proxy in any individual case is irrelevant.”)\n\f             PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.                14691\ngeographical proximity. We must not forget that “race unfor-\ntunately still matters,” Grutter, 539 U.S. at 333, and it is race\nthat is the relevant consideration here.\n\n   In sum, the contextual differences between public high\nschools and selective institutions of higher learning make the\nfirst of the Grutter hallmarks ill-suited for our narrow tailor-\ning inquiry.26 The remaining hallmarks, however, are relevant\nand control our analysis.\n\n  2. Absence of Quotas\n\n   In Grutter, the Court approved the law school’s plan, in\npart, because it did not institute a quota, whereby a fixed\nnumber of slots are reserved exclusively for minority groups,\nthereby insulating members of those groups from competition\nwith other candidates.27 539 U.S. at 335. Although the law\n  26\n      The dissent’s alternative proposals to achieve the District’s interests\nin diversity illustrate the difficulty of individualized consideration in the\nhigh school context. For example, the dissent offers socioeconomic status\nas a more narrowly tailored and acceptable form of diversifying the Dis-\ntrict’s schools. However, socioeconomic status does nothing more than\nsubstitute a number from a family’s tax return for race. There is no holis-\ntic, individualized consideration under such an approach.\n   27\n      Much like the rationale underlying the Court’s requirement of individ-\nualized, holistic review, the rationale underlying the Court’s prohibition of\nquotas does not apply to the race-based tiebreaker. In paradigmatic affir-\nmative action settings — employment and admissions to institutions of\nhigher learning — the Court disapproves of quotas because they are\nviewed as insulating minority candidates from competition with nonmi-\nnority candidates for scarce government resources usually awarded on the\nbasis of an applicant’s qualifications — jobs, promotions or places in a\nlaw school class. See Bakke, 438 U.S. at 317 (opinion of Powell, J.). This\nis objectionable because no “matter how strong their qualifications,” non-\nminority candidates are never afforded the chance to compete with appli-\ncants from the preferred groups for the set-aside. Id. at 319. Because\nnoncompetitive assignment to Seattle’s public high schools is not based on\na student’s relative qualifications, the dangers that are presented by a\nquota — of substituting racial preference for qualification-based competi-\ntion — are absent here.\n\f14692        PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\nschool’s plan did not seek to admit a set number or percentage\nof minority students, during the height of the admission’s sea-\nson, the law school would consult “daily reports” that kept\ntrack of the racial composition of the incoming class. Id. at\n318. The Court held that this attention to numbers did not\ntransform the law school plan into a quota, but instead dem-\nonstrated that the law school sought to enroll a critical mass\nof minority students in order “to realize the educational bene-\nfits of a diverse student body.” Id. Similarly, we conclude that\nthe District’s 15 percent plus or minus variance is not a quota\nbecause it does not reserve a fixed number of slots for stu-\ndents based on their race, but instead it seeks to enroll a criti-\ncal mass of white and nonwhite students in its oversubscribed\nschools in order to realize its compelling interests.28\n\n  a. No fixed number of slots\n\n   The District’s race-based tiebreaker does not set aside a\nfixed number of slots for nonwhite or white students in any\nof the District’s schools. The tiebreaker is used only so long\nas there are members of the underrepresented race in the\napplicant pool for a particular oversubscribed school. If the\nnumber of students of that race who have applied to that\nschool is exhausted, no further action is taken, even if the 15\npercent variance has not been satisfied. That is, if the appli-\ncant pool has been exhausted, no students are required or\nrecruited to attend a particular high school in order to bring\nit within the 15 percent plus or minus range for that year.\n  28\n     Although the dissent contends that the “tiebreaker aims for a rigid,\npredetermined ratio of white and nonwhite students,” we believe it is more\nappropriately viewed as a “permissible goal.” Such a goal “requires only\na good faith effort . . . to come within a range demarcated by the goal\nitself.” Grutter, 539 U.S at 334 (internal quotation marks and citation\nomitted). The tiebreaker’s broad, 30% range and the District’s willingness\nto turn off the use of the tiebreaker after the ninth grade are consistent with\na goal as opposed to a rigid ratio.\n\f             PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.                14693\n   Moreover, the number of white and nonwhite students in\nthe high schools is flexible and varies from school to school\nand from year to year.29 This variance in the number of non-\nwhite and white students throughout the District’s high\nschools is because, under the Plan, assignments are based on\nstudents’ and parents’ preferences.30 The tiebreakers come\ninto play in the assignment process only when a school is\noversubscribed. As Morgan Lewis, the Manager of Enroll-\nment Planning, Technical Support and Demographics, testi-\nfied, “If all the parents . . . don’t pick [a] school in a massive\nnumber, then everyone gets in. And so it’s . . . a case where\nthe choice patterns, the oversubscription . . . [is] the reason\nthe [tiebreaker] kicks in . . . . Everything happens when more\npeople want the seats. And why they want the seats some-\ntimes we don’t know.”\n\n  b. Critical mass\n\n   Within this flexible system, where parental and student\nchoices drive the assignments to particular schools, the Dis-\ntrict seeks to enroll and maintain a relatively stable critical\nmass of white and nonwhite students in each of its oversub-\nscribed high schools in order to achieve its compelling inter-\nest in racial diversity and to prevent the assignments from\n  29\n      Notably, the District’s percentage of white and nonwhite enrollment\nis significantly more varied than the percentage of underrepresented\nminorities admitted to the University of Michigan’s Law School, which\nremained relatively consistent. From 1995 to 1998, the percentage of\nminority students enrolled in the law school was 13.5 percent, 13.8 per-\ncent, 13.6 percent and 13.8 percent. Grutter, 539 U.S. at 389-90 (Ken-\nnedy, J., dissenting). In contrast, the District’s percentage of white and\nnonwhite enrollment encompasses a wide range. For example, for the\n2000-01 school year, the percentage of nonwhite students in the ninth\ngrade classes of the four oversubscribed public high schools after the\nracial tiebreaker was applied, varied from 54.2 percent at Ballard, to 59.5\npercent at Franklin, to 40.6 percent at Nathan Hale to 55.3 percent at Roo-\nsevelt.\n   30\n      Slightly more than 80 percent of all entering ninth grade students were\nassigned to their first choice school.\n\f14694       PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\nreplicating Seattle’s segregated housing patterns. Faced with\nthe question of what constituted a critical mass of students in\nthis particular context, the District determined that a critical\nmass was best achieved by adopting the 15 percent plus or\nminus variance tied to demographics of students in the Seattle\npublic schools. Thus, when an oversubscribed high school has\nmore than 75 percent nonwhite students (i.e., more than 15\npercent above the overall 60 percent nonwhite student popula-\ntion) and less than 25 percent white students, or when it has\nless than 45 percent nonwhite students (i.e., more than 15 per-\ncent below the overall 60 percent nonwhite student popula-\ntion) and more than 55 percent white students, the school is\nconsidered racially concentrated or isolated, meaning that it\nlacks a critical mass of students needed “to realize the educa-\ntional benefits of a diverse student body.”\n\n   Parents attack the District’s use of the 15 percent plus or\nminus variance tied to the District’s school population demo-\ngraphics because they believe that the District cannot use race\nat all in its assignment process. We have rejected this argu-\nment, however, applying Grutter and Gratz. See supra Part\nII.B. Alternatively, Parents contend that the District’s goal of\nenrolling between 75 and 45 percent nonwhite students and\nbetween 25 and 55 percent white students in its oversub-\nscribed schools establishes a quota, not a critical mass. They\nnote that the critical mass sought by the law school in Grutter\nwas smaller, consisting of between 12 and 20 percent of\nunderrepresented minority students in each law school class.\n\n   Parents’ argument, however, ignores Grutter’s admonition\nthat the narrow tailoring inquiry be context-specific. First, like\nthe District’s enrollment goals, which are tied to the demo-\ngraphics of the Seattle schools’ total student population, the\nlaw school’s goal of enrolling between 12 to 20 percent of\nunderrepresented minorities in a given year was tied to the\ndemographics of its applicant pool.31 Second, in tying the use\n  31\n    For example, in 1995, 662 (approximately 16 percent) of the 4147 law\nschool applicants were underrepresented minorities; in 1996, 559 (approx-\n\f            PARENTS INVOLVED v.

As the District’s expert testified,\n\n     Most of the cases I’ve participated in . . . generally\n     worked with numbers that reflect the racial composi-\n     tion of the school district but, at the same time,\n     tr[ied] to allow the district sufficient flexibility so\n     that it would not have to regularly and repeatedly\n     move students on a short-term basis simply to main-\n     tain some specific number. That’s why we see\n     ranges of plus or minus 15 percent in most cases of\n     school desegregation.\n\nEven Parents’ expert testified that school districts throughout\nthe country determine whether a district is sufficiently deseg-\nregated by looking to the “population of the district” in ques-\ntion. See also Comfort, 418 F.3d at 21 (holding that a\n“transfer policy conditioned on district demographics (+/- 10-\n15%)” was not a quota because it “reflects the defendants’\nefforts to obtain the benefits of diversity in a stable learning\nenvironment”); Belk v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ,\n233 F.3d 232, 287-88 (4th Cir. 2000) (Traxler, J., dissenting)\n(citing to a book written by David J. Armor, Parents’ expert,\nForced Justice: School Desegregation and the Law 160\n(1995), which observed that over 70 percent of the school dis-\ntricts with desegregation plans use a variance of plus or minus\n15 percent or greater); cf. 34 C.F.R. § 280.4(b) (defining “mi-\nnority group isolation” as a “condition in which minority\ngroup children constitute more than 50 percent of the enroll-\nment of [a] school”). Given this empirically and time-tested\n\nimately 15 percent) of the 3677 law school applicants were underrepre-\nsented minorities; in 1997, 520 (approximately 15 percent) of the 3429\nlaw school applicants were underrepresented minorities.

SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\nnotion of critical mass in the public high school desegregation\ncontext, it would make little sense to force the District to uti-\nlize the same percentages that constituted a critical mass in\nthe elite law school context to determine what constitutes a\ncritical mass for Seattle public high schools. See Grutter, 539\nU.S. at 336 (“[S]ome attention to numbers, without more,\ndoes not transform a flexible admissions system into a rigid\nquota.”) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\n\n   [18] Accordingly, we conclude that the District’s 15 per-\ncent plus or minus trigger point tied to the demographics of\nthe Seattle school population is not a quota. It is a context-\nspecific, flexible measurement of racial diversity designed to\nattain and maintain a critical mass of white and nonwhite stu-\ndents in Seattle’s public high schools.\n\n  3. Necessity of the Plan and Race-Neutral Alternatives\n\n   Narrow tailoring also requires us to consider the necessity\nof the race-based plan or policy in question and whether there\nare equally effective, race-neutral alternatives.\n\n  a. Necessity of the Plan\n\n   The District argues that the compelling interests that it\nseeks are directly served by the race-based tiebreaker. The tie-\nbreaker allows the District to balance students’ and parents’\nchoices among high schools with its broader compelling inter-\nests — achieving the educational and social benefits of diver-\nsity and the benefits specific to the secondary school context,\nand discouraging a return to enrollment patterns based on\nSeattle’s racially segregated housing pattern.\n\n    i. Need for race-based tiebreaker\n\n   When the District moved from its controlled choice plan to\nthe current Plan, see supra Part I.A, it predicted that families\nwould tend to choose schools close to their homes. Indeed,\n\f             PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.                14697\nthis feature was seen as a positive way to increase parental\ninvolvement. However, unfettered choice — especially with\ntiebreakers based on neighborhood or distance from a school\n— created the risk that Seattle’s high school enrollment\nwould again do no more than reflect its segregated housing\npatterns. See supra Part II.C.2.\n\n   It is this de facto residential segregation across a white/\nnonwhite axis that the District has battled historically and that\nit seeks to ameliorate by making the integration tiebreaker a\npart of its open choice Plan.32 The District, mindful of both\nSeattle’s history and future, appropriately places its focus\nhere. In the 2001-02 school year, the integration tiebreaker\noperated in three high schools (that is, three high schools were\noversubscribed and deviated by more than 15 percent from\nthe ratio of white to nonwhite students district-wide). The\nintegration tiebreaker served to alter the imbalance in the\nschools in which it operated in a minimally intrusive manner.\nThe tiebreaker, therefore, successfully achieved the District’s\ncompelling interests.\n\n       ii. White/Nonwhite distinction\n\n   Parents argue that the District paints with too broad a brush\nby distinguishing only between white and nonwhite students,\nwithout taking into account the diversity within the “non-\nwhite” group. However, the District’s choice to increase\ndiversity along the white/nonwhite axis is rooted in Seattle’s\nhistory and current reality of de facto segregation resulting\nfrom Seattle’s segregated housing patterns. The white/\nnonwhite distinction is narrowly tailored to prioritize move-\n  32\n    Although we characterize it as de facto residential segregation, we are\nmindful of Justice Marshall’s dissent in Board of Education v. Dowell,\n“The . . . conclusion that the racial identity of the northeast quadrant now\nsubsists because of ‘personal preference[s]’ pays insufficient attention to\nthe roles of the State, local officials, and the Board in creating what are\nnow self-perpetuating patterns of residential segregation.” 498 U.S. 237,\n263 (1991) (internal citation omitted).\n\f14698       PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\nment of students from the north of the city to the south of the\ncity and vice versa. This white/nonwhite focus is also consis-\ntent with the history of public school desegregation measures\nthroughout the country, as reflected in a current federal regu-\nlation defining “[m]inority group isolation” as “a condition in\nwhich minority group children constitute more than 50 per-\ncent of the enrollment of the school,” without distinguishing\namong the various categories included within the definition of\n“minority group.” 34 C.F.R. § 280.4(b); see Grutter, 539 U.S.\nat 316 (noting that the law school sought to enroll a critical\nmass of “minority students,” a category that included African\nAmericans, Hispanics and Native Americans); Comfort, 418\nF.3d at 22 (“By increasing diversity along the white/nonwhite\naxis, the Plan reduced racial tensions and produced positive\neducational benefits. Narrow tailoring does not require that\nLynn ensure diversity among every racial and ethnic sub-\ngroup as well.”) (emphasis added).\n\n  b. Race-neutral alternatives\n\n   In Grutter, the Court explained that narrow tailoring “re-\nquire[s] serious, good faith consideration of workable race-\nneutral alternatives that will achieve the diversity the univer-\nsity seeks.” 539 U.S. at 339 (emphasis added). On the other\nhand, “[n]arrow tailoring does not require exhaustion of every\nconceivable race-neutral alternative.” Id. Furthermore, the\nCourt made clear that the university was not required to adopt\nrace-neutral measures that would have forced it to sacrifice\nother educational values central to its mission. Id. at 340.\nImplicit in the Court’s analysis was a measure of deference\ntoward the university’s identification of those values.33 See id.\n  33\n     The Supreme Court repeatedly has shown deference to school officials\nat the intersection between constitutional protections and educational pol-\nicy. See generally Wendy Parker, Connecting the Dots: Grutter, School\nDesegregation, and Federalism, 45 Wm. & Mary L. Rev. 1691 (2004).\nThe theme of local control over public education has animated Supreme\nCourt jurisprudence. See, e.g., Brown, 349 U.S. at 299 (directing local\n\f             PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.                 14699\nat 328, 340. Here, the record reflects that the District reason-\nably concluded that a race-neutral alternative would not meet\nits goals.\n\n     i. Using poverty as an alternative measure of diversity\n\n   The record demonstrates that the School Board considered\nusing a poverty tiebreaker in place of the race-based tie-\nbreaker. It concluded, however, that this proxy device would\nnot achieve its compelling interest in achieving racial diver-\nsity, and had other adverse effects. Although there was no for-\nmal study of the proposal by District staff, Board members’\ntestimony revealed two legitimate reasons why the Board\nrejected the use of poverty to reach its goal of racial diversity.\nFirst, the Board concluded that it is insulting to minorities and\noften inaccurate to assume that poverty correlates with minor-\nity status. Second, for the group of students for whom poverty\nwould correlate with minority status, the implementation\nwould have been thwarted by high school students’ under-\n\nschool officials, with court oversight, to devise remedies for segregation\nin the light of “varied local school problems”); Milliken v. Bradley, 418\nU.S. 717, 741-42 (1974) (“No single tradition in public education is more\ndeeply rooted than local control over the operation of schools; local auton-\nomy has long been thought essential both to the maintenance of commu-\nnity concern and support for public schools and to quality of the\neducational process.”); Freeman, 503 U.S. at 490 (“As we have long\nobserved, ‘local autonomy of school districts is a vital national tradi-\ntion.’ ” (quoting Dayton Bd. of Educ. v. Brinkman, 433 U.S. 406, 410\n(1977)); see also Bethel Sch. Dist. v. Fraser, 478 U.S. 675, 683 (1986)\n(“The determination of what manner of speech in the classroom or in the\nschool assembly is inappropriate properly rests with the school board.”);\nLavine v. Blaine School District, 257 F.3d 981, 988 (9th Cir. 2001) (“In\nthe school context, we have granted educators substantial deference as to\nwhat speech is appropriate.”) (citing and quoting Hazelwood Sch. Dist. v.\nKuhlmeier, 484 U.S. 260, 267 (1988)). These Supreme Court decisions\nsuggest that secondary schools occupy a unique position in our constitu-\ntional tradition. For this reason, we afford deference to the District’s judg-\nment similar to that which Grutter afforded the university. See Grutter,\n539 U.S. at 328-29.\n\f14700     PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\nstandable reluctance to reveal their socioeconomic status to\ntheir peers.\n\n   Because racial diversity is a compelling interest, the Dis-\ntrict may permissibly seek it if it does so in a narrowly tai-\nlored manner. We do not require the District to conceal its\ncompelling interest of achieving racial diversity and avoiding\nracial concentration or isolation through the use of “some\nclumsier proxy device” such as poverty. See Comfort, 418\nF.3d at 29 (Boudin, C.J., concurring).\n\n    ii. The Urban League plan\n\n   Parents also assert that the District should have more for-\nmally considered an Urban League proposal, which did not\neliminate the integration tiebreaker but merely considered it\nafter other factors. The Urban League plan was a comprehen-\nsive plan seeking to enhance the quality of education in Seat-\ntle’s schools by focusing on educational organization, teacher\nquality, parent-teacher interaction, raising curricular stan-\ndards, substantially broadening the availability of specialized\nand magnet programs (which could attract a broader cross-\nsection of students to undersubscribed schools) and support-\ning extra-curricular development. The plan proposed decreas-\ning the School District’s reliance on race in the assignment\nprocess by pairing neighborhoods with particular schools and\ncreating a type of neighborhood/regional school model. Under\nthe Urban League plan, preference initially would be given to\nstudents choosing a school in their paired region, and the\nexisting racial tiebreaker would be demoted from second to\nthird in the process of resolving any remaining oversubscrip-\ntion. The plan also suggested adding an eleventh high school.\n\n   Board members testified that they rejected the plan because\nof the high value the District places on parental and student\nchoice. Moreover, given Seattle’s segregated housing pat-\nterns, by prioritizing a neighborhood/regional school model\nwhere students are assigned to schools close to their homes,\n\f           PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.        14701\nthe Urban League plan did not sufficiently ensure the achieve-\nment of the District’s compelling interests in racial diversity\nand avoidance of racial concentration or isolation. As one\nmember of the School Board testified, “[it] would become\nControlled Choice all over again. That’s basically what Con-\ntrolled Choice was, [ ] a regional plan; it controlled your\noptions by using regions or geography.” It was therefore per-\nmissible for the District to reject a plan that neither comported\nwith its priorities nor achieved its compelling interests.\n\n    iii. Lottery\n\n   Parents additionally contend in this court that the District\nshould have considered using a lottery to assign students to\nthe oversubscribed high schools. As an initial matter, we note\nthat Parents did not argue before the district court that a lot-\ntery was a workable race-neutral alternative that would\nachieve the Districts’ compelling interests. Parents now argue\non appeal, however, that a lottery would achieve the District’s\ncompelling interests without having to resort to the race-based\ntiebreaker. They ask us to assume that because approximately\n82 percent of all students want to attend one of Seattle’s over-\nsubscribed schools, the makeup of this 82 percent, as well as\nthat of the applicant pool for each school, mirrors the demo-\ngraphics of the District (60 percent white and 40 percent non-\nwhite). Employing this assumption, Parents also ask us to\nassume that a random lottery drawing from this pool would\nproduce a student body in each of the oversubscribed schools\nthat falls within the District’s 15 percent plus or minus vari-\nance. These assumptions, however, are not supported —\nindeed, are undercut — by the factual record. For example,\nSuperintendent Olchefske explained that District patterns\nindicate that more people choose schools close to home. That\nwould mean that the pool of applicants would be skewed in\nfavor of the demographic of the surrounding residential area.\nThat is, the applicant pool for the north area oversubscribed\nhigh schools would have a higher concentration of white stu-\ndents and the applicant pool for the south area oversubscribed\n\f14702      PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\nhigh school would have a higher concentration of nonwhite\nstudents. Thus, random sampling from such a racially skewed\npool would produce a racially skewed student body. As one\nBoard member testified, a lottery was not a viable alternative\nbecause “[i]f applicants are overwhelmingly majority and you\nhave a lottery, then your lottery — the pool of your lottery\nkids are going to be overwhelmingly majority. We have a\ndiversity goal.”\n\n   Although the District has the burden of demonstrating that\nits Plan is narrowly tailored, see Gratz, 539 U.S. at 270, it\nneed not “exhaust[ ] every conceivable race-neutral alterna-\ntive.” Grutter, 539 U.S. at 339. Parents’ belated and bald\nassertion that a lottery could achieve the District’s compelling\ninterests, without any evidence to support their claim, fails to\ndemonstrate that a lottery is a viable race-neutral alternative.\nSee id. at 340 (dismissing the race-neutral alternative of “per-\ncentage plans,” advocated by the United States in an amicus\nbrief, because the “United States [did] not . . . explain how\nsuch plans could work for graduate and professional\nschools”); Comfort, 418 F.3d at 23 (noting that Lynn rejected\nthe use of a lottery in place of the race-based tiebreaker and\nholding that “Lynn must keep abreast of possible alternatives\nas they develop . . . but it need not prove the impracticability\nof every conceivable model for racial integration”) (internal\ncitation omitted).\n\n  c. The District’s use of race\n\n   The dissent posits variables the District could use instead\nof race, for example, embracing the San Francisco school dis-\ntrict’s approach as a possible model for integration that would\nmeet the dissent’s criteria. Bea, J., dissenting, infra. at 14750-\n51, n.24. Perhaps San Francisco has experienced success\n(however that school district defines it) in its multi-variable\nplan — the details and evaluations of which are not in the\nrecord. The District is free to consider the San Francisco\nmodel when it engages in the annual review of its own Plan.\n\f           PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.       14703\nHowever, even assuming that San Francisco’s plan is work-\ning, that does not mean that it must be used by other cities in\nother states. Much can be gained from the various states\nemploying locally appropriate means to achieve desirable\nends. In our system, where states are considered laboratories\nto be used to experiment with myriad approaches to resolving\nsocial problems, we certainly should not punish one school\ndistrict for not adopting the approach of another. Justice Bran-\ndeis said it well,\n\n    There must be power in the States and the Nation to\n    remould, through experimentation, our economic\n    practices and institutions to meet changing social\n    and economic needs . . . . To stay experimentation in\n    things social and economic is a grave responsibility.\n    Denial of the right to experiment may be fraught\n    with serious consequences to the Nation. It is one of\n    the happy incidents of the federal system that a sin-\n    gle courageous State may, if its citizens choose,\n    serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and eco-\n    nomic experiments without risk to the rest of the\n    country.\n\nNew State Ice Co. v. Liebmann, 285 U.S. 262, 311 (1932)\n(Brandeis, J., dissenting).\n\n   [19] In sum, the District made a good faith effort to con-\nsider feasible race-neutral alternatives and permissibly\nrejected them in favor of a system involving a sibling prefer-\nence, a race-based tiebreaker and a proximity preference.\nOver the long history of the District’s efforts to achieve\ndesegregated schools, it has experimented with many alterna-\ntives, including magnet and other special-interest programs,\nwhich it continues to employ, and race-conscious districting.\nBut when a racially diverse school system is the goal (or\nracial concentration or isolation is the problem), there is no\nmore effective means than a consideration of race to achieve\nthe solution. Even Parents’ expert conceded that, “if you don’t\n\f14704        PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\nconsider race, it may not be possible to offer an integrated\noption to students. . . . [I]f you want to guarantee it you have\nto consider race.” As Superintendent Olchefske stated, “when\ndiversity, meaning racial diversity, is part of the educational\nenvironment we wanted to create, I think our view was you\ntook that issue head on and used — you used race as part of\nthe structures you developed.” The logic is self-evident:\nWhen racial diversity is a principal element of the school dis-\ntrict’s compelling interest, then a narrowly tailored plan may\nexplicitly take race into account.34 Cf. Hunter v. Regents of\nUniv. of Cal., 190 F.3d 1061, 1067 (9th Cir. 1999) (upholding\nas narrowly tailored the admissions policy of an elementary\nschool — operated as a research laboratory — that explicitly\nconsidered race in pursuit of a racially balanced research sam-\nple).\n\n  4. Undue Harm\n\n   A narrowly tailored plan ensures that no member of any\nracial group is unduly harmed. Grutter, 539 U.S. at 341. Par-\nents argue that every student who is denied his or her choice\nof schools because of the integration tiebreaker suffers a con-\nstitutionally significant burden. We agree with the Supreme\nCourt of Washington, however, in its assessment that the Dis-\ntrict’s Plan imposes a minimal burden that is shared equally\nby all of the District’s students. Parents IV, 72 P.3d at 159-60\n(noting that the burden of not being allowed to attend one’s\npreferred school is shared by all students equally). As that\ncourt noted, it is well established that “there [is] no right\nunder Washington law to attend a local school or the school\nof the student’s choice.” Id. at 159.35 Indeed, public schools,\n  34\n      The dissent urges, “The way to end discrimination is to stop discrimi-\nnating by race.” Bea, J., dissenting, infra. at 14762. More properly stated,\nthe way to end segregation is to stop separation of the races. The Seattle\nschool district is attempting to do precisely that.\n   35\n      Subject to federal statutory and constitutional requirements, structur-\ning public education has long been within the control of the states as part\nof their traditional police powers. See Barbier v. Connolly, 113 U.S. 27,\n31-32 (1884) (describing the states’ traditional police powers).\n\f             PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.                14705\nunlike universities, have a tradition of compulsory assign-\nment. See Bazemore v. Friday, 478 U.S. 385, 408 (1986)\n(White, J., concurring) (noting that “school boards customar-\nily have the power to create school attendance areas and oth-\nerwise designate the school that particular students may\nattend”). When an applicant’s qualifications are not under\nconsideration at all, there is no notion that one student is enti-\ntled to a place at any particular school. See Comfort, 418 F.3d\nat 20 (“The denial of a transfer under the [District’s] Plan is\n. . . markedly different from the denial of a spot at a unique\nor selective educational institution.”).\n\n   Moreover, it is undisputed that the race-based tiebreaker\ndoes not uniformly benefit one race or group to the detriment\nof another. At some schools, white students are given prefer-\nence over nonwhite students, and, at other schools, nonwhite\nstudents are given preference over white students. For exam-\nple, in the 2000-01 school year, 89 more white students were\nassigned to Franklin, one of Seattle’s most popular schools,\nthan would have been assigned absent the tiebreaker; 107\nmore nonwhite students were assigned to Ballard, another of\nSeattle’s most popular schools, than would have been\nassigned absent the tiebreaker; 27 more nonwhite students\nwere assigned to Nathan Hale than would have been assigned\nabsent the tiebreaker; and 82 more nonwhite students were\nassigned to Roosevelt than would have been absent the tie-\nbreaker.36\n\n   [20] In sum, because (1) the District is entitled to assign all\nstudents to any of its schools, (2) no student is entitled to\nattend any specific school and (3) the tiebreaker does not uni-\nformly benefit any race or group of individuals to the detri-\n  36\n    As detailed earlier, the Board’s decision to change the trigger point for\nuse of the tiebreaker from plus or minus 10 percent to plus or minus 15\npercent had the effect of rendering Roosevelt High School neutral for\ndesegregation purposes. Thus, the tiebreaker did not factor into assign-\nments to Roosevelt High School in the 2001-02 school year.\n\f14706        PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\nment of another, the tiebreaker does not unduly harm any\nstudents in the District.\n\n  5. Sunset Provision\n\n   [21] A narrowly tailored plan must be limited not only in\nscope, but also in time. Grutter, 539 U.S. at 342. The Court\nheld in Grutter that this durational requirement can be met by\n“periodic reviews to determine whether racial preferences are\nstill necessary to achieve student body diversity.” Id. The Dis-\ntrict’s Plan includes such reviews. It revisits the Plan annually\nand has demonstrated its ability to be responsive to parents’\nand students’ choice patterns and to the concerns of its con-\nstituents. For example, in 2000, when a higher than normal\nnumber of students selected the same schools, the Board\nresponded by increasing the race-based trigger from 10 per-\ncent to a 15 percent deviation from the school population,\nadopting the thermostat that turns off the tiebreaker as soon\nas the school has come within the 15 percent plus or minus\ntrigger point and by using the tiebreaker solely for the incom-\ning ninth grade class.\n\n   [22] With respect to the dissent’s concern for a “logical end\npoint,” Bea, J., dissenting, infra. at 14755, like Justice\nO’Connor this court shares in the hope that “25 years from\nnow, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary\nto further the interest approved today.” Grutter, 539 U.S. at\n343. We expect that the District will continue to review its\nPlan, and we presume, as did the Court in Grutter, that school\nofficials will demonstrate a good faith commitment to moni-\ntoring the continued need for the race-based tiebreaker and\nterminating its use when that need ends.37 See 539 U.S. at 343.\n  37\n    It is worth noting that plans like the District’s may actually contribute\nto achieving the Court’s vision in Grutter that racial preferences will no\nlonger be necessary in 25 years — or even sooner. As Justice Ginsburg\nobserved, “As lower school education in minority communities improves,\nan increase in the number of [highly qualified and competitive] students\nmay be anticipated.” Grutter, 539 U.S. at 346 (Ginsburg, J., concurring).\n\f          PARENTS INVOLVED v.

Conclusion\n\n  [23] For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the Plan\nadopted by the Seattle School District for high school assign-\nments is constitutional and the use of the race-based tie-\nbreaker is narrowly tailored to achieve the District’s\ncompelling interests.

Given the exacting standard they are\nattempting to apply, I cannot say that either is clearly wrong.\nBut there is something unreal about their efforts to apply the\nteachings of prior Supreme Court cases, all decided in very\ndifferent contexts, to the plan at issue here. I hear the thud of\nsquare pegs being pounded into round holes. Ultimately, nei-\nther analysis seems entirely persuasive.\n\n   I start as did our eminent colleague Chief Judge Boudin of\nthe First Circuit, in commenting on a highly-analogous plan\nadopted by the city of Lynn, Massachusetts:\n\n    [The] plan at issue in this case is fundamentally dif-\n    ferent from almost anything that the Supreme Court\n    has previously addressed. It is not, like old-fashioned\n    racial discrimination laws, aimed at oppressing\n    blacks, e.g., Brown v. Bd. of Educ., 347 U.S. 483\n    (1954); Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U.S. 303\n\f           PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.        14711\n    (1880); nor, like modern affirmative action, does it\n    seek to give one racial group an edge over another\n    (either to remedy past discrimination or for other\n    purposes). E.g., Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena,\n    515 U.S. 200 (1995). By contrast to Johnson v. Cali-\n    fornia, 125 S. Ct. 1141 (2005), the plan does not seg-\n    regate persons by race. See also Loving v. Virginia,\n    388 U.S. 1 (1967). Nor does it involve racial quotas.\n    E.g., Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U.S.\n    265 (1978).\n\nComfort v. Lynn Sch. Comm., 418 F.3d 1, 27 (1st Cir. 2005)\n(Boudin, C.J., concurring).\n\n   These are meaningful differences. When the government\nseeks to use racial classifications to oppress blacks or other\nminorities, no conceivable justification will be sufficiently\ncompelling. See, e.g., Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 374\n(1886). Similarly, when lawyers use peremptory challenges to\nexclude jurors of a particular race, thereby denying them the\nright to participate in government service, they must justify\ntheir challenges based on objective, non-racial considerations;\njustifications based on race will be rejected out of hand, no\nmatter how compelling they might seem. See Batson v. Ken-\ntucky, 476 U.S. 79, 85-88 (1986). When government seeks to\nsegregate the races, as in Johnson, the courts will look with\ngreat skepticism at the justifications offered in support of such\nprograms, and will reject them when they reflect assumptions\nabout the conduct of individuals based on their race or skin\ncolor. See Johnson, 125 S. Ct. at 1154 (Stevens, J., dissenting)\n(concluding that California’s policy of racially segregating\ninmates “supports the suspicion that the policy is based on\nracial stereotypes and outmoded fears about the dangers of\nracial integration”). When the government engages in racial\ngerrymandering, it not only keeps the races apart, but exacer-\nbates racial tensions by making race a proxy for political\npower. See Shaw v. Reno, 509 U.S. 630, 648 (1993) (“When\na district obviously is created solely to effectuate the per-\n\f14712      PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\nceived common interests of one racial group, elected officials\nare more likely to believe that their primary obligation is to\nrepresent only the members of that group, rather than their\nconstituency as a whole.”). Programs seeking to help minori-\nties by giving them preferences in contracting, see, e.g., Ada-\nrand, and education, see, e.g., Bakke, benign though they may\nbe in their motivations, pit the races against each other, and\ncast doubts on the ability of minorities to compete with the\nmajority on an equal footing.\n\n   The Seattle plan suffers none of these defects. It certainly\nis not meant to oppress minorities, nor does it have that effect.\nNo race is turned away from government service or services.\nThe plan does not segregate the races; to the contrary, it seeks\nto promote integration. There is no attempt to give members\nof particular races political power based on skin color. There\nis no competition between the races, and no race is given a\npreference over another. That a student is denied the school\nof his choice may be disappointing, but it carries no racial\nstigma and says nothing at all about that individual’s aptitude\nor ability. The program does use race as a criterion, but only\nto ensure that the population of each public school roughly\nreflects the city’s racial composition.\n\n   Because the Seattle plan carries none of the baggage the\nSupreme Court has found objectionable in cases where it has\napplied strict scrutiny and narrow tailoring, I would consider\nthe plan under a rational basis standard of review. By rational\nbasis, I don’t mean the standard applied to economic regula-\ntions, where courts shut their eyes to reality or even invent\njustifications for upholding government programs, see, e.g.,\nWilliamson v. Lee Optical of Okla., Inc., 348 U.S. 483 (1955),\nbut robust and realistic rational basis review, see, e.g., City of\nCleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., Inc., 473 U.S. 432 (1985),\nwhere courts consider the actual reasons for the plan in light\nof the real-world circumstances that gave rise to it.\n\n   Under this standard, I have no trouble finding the Seattle\nplan constitutional. Through their elected officials, the people\n\f           PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.        14713\nof Seattle have adopted a plan that emphasizes school choice,\nyet tempers such choice somewhat in order to ensure that the\nschools reflect the city’s population. Such stirring of the melt-\ning pot strikes me as eminently sensible.\n\n   The record shows, and common experience tells us, that\nstudents tend to select the schools closest to their homes,\nwhich means that schools will reflect the composition of the\nneighborhood where they are located. Neighborhoods, how-\never, do not reflect the racial composition of the city as a\nwhole. In Seattle, “as in many other cities, minorities and\nwhites often live in different neighborhoods.” Comfort, 418\nF.3d at 29 (Boudin, C.J., concurring). To the extent that stu-\ndents gravitate to the schools near their homes, the schools\nwill have the same racial composition as the neighborhood.\nThis means that student patterns of interacting primarily with\nmembers of their own race that are first developed by living\nin racially isolated neighborhoods will be continued and exac-\nerbated by the school experience.\n\n   It is difficult to deny the importance of teaching children,\nduring their formative years, how to deal respectfully and col-\nlegially with peers of different races. Whether one would call\nthis a compelling interest or merely a highly rational one\nstrikes me as little more than semantics. The reality is that\nattitudes and patterns of interaction are developed early in life\nand, in a multicultural and diverse society such as ours, there\nis great value in developing the ability to interact successfully\nwith individuals who are very different from oneself. It is\nimportant for the individual student, to be sure, but it is also\nvitally important for us as a society.\n\n   It may be true, as the dissent suggests, that students are\ninfluenced far more by their experiences in the home, church\nand social clubs they attend outside of school. But this does\nnot negate the fact that time spent in school and on school-\nrelated activities, which may take up as much as half of a stu-\ndent’s waking hours, nevertheless has a significant impact on\n\f14714      PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\nthat student’s development. The school environment forces\nstudents both to compete and cooperate in the classroom, as\nwell as during extracurricular activities ranging from football\nto forensics. Schoolmates often become friends, rivals and\nromantic partners; learning to deal with individuals of differ-\nent races in these various capacities cannot help but foster the\nlive-and-let-live spirit that is the essence of the American\nexperience. I believe this is a rational objective for an educa-\ntional system—every bit as rational as teaching the three Rs,\nadvanced chemistry or driver’s education. Schools, after all,\ndon’t simply prepare students for further education, though\nthey certainly can and should do that; good schools prepare\nstudents for life, by instilling skills and attitudes that will\nserve them long after their first year of college.\n\n   To borrow Judge Boudin’s words once again, the plan here\nis “far from the original evils at which the Fourteenth Amend-\nment was addressed. . . . This is not a case in which, against\nthe background of core principles, all doubts should be\nresolved against constitutionality.” Comfort, 418 F.3d at 29\n(Boudin, C.J., concurring). I am acutely mindful of the\nSupreme Court’s strong admonition only last Term that any\nand all racial classifications must be adjudged under the strict\nscrutiny standard of review. See Johnson, 125 S. Ct. at 1146\n(citing cases). But the Supreme Court’s opinions are necessar-\nily forged by the cases presented to it; where the case at hand\ndiffers in material respects from those the Supreme Court has\npreviously decided, I would hope that those seemingly cate-\ngorical pronouncements will not be applied without consider-\nation of whether they make sense beyond the circumstances\nthat occasioned them.\n\n   When the Supreme Court does review the Seattle plan, or\none like it, I hope the justices will give serious thought to\nbypassing strict—and almost always deadly—scrutiny, and\nadopt something more akin to rational basis review. Not only\ndoes a plan that promotes the mixing of races deserve support\nrather than suspicion and hostility from the judiciary, but\n\f           PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.       14715\nthere is much to be said for returning primacy on matters of\neducational policy to local officials. Long past is the day\nwhen losing an election or a legislative vote on a hotly con-\ntested issue was considered the end of the matter—at least\nuntil the next election when the voters might “throw the ras-\ncals out.” Too often nowadays, an election or a vote is a mere\nprecursor to litigation, with the outcome of the dispute not\nknown until judges decide the case many years later.\n\n   Whatever else the strict scrutiny standard of review may\ndo, it most certainly encourages resort to the courts and often\ndelays implementation of a program for years. The more com-\nplex and exacting the standard of review, the more uncertain\nthe outcome, and the greater are the incentives for the parties\nto bloat the record with depositions, expert reports, exhibits,\ndocuments and various other materials they hope will catch\nthe eye of the judges who ultimately decide the issue. This is\na perfectly fine example, the litigation having taken over five\nyears so far, generating 11 published opinions from the 24\njudges who have considered the matter in the federal and state\ncourts. In the meantime, the plan was put on hold, and at least\none class has entered and will have completed its entire high\nschool career without ever being affected by it.\n\n   While it’s tempting to adopt rules of law that give us the\nultimate say on hotly contested political questions, we should\nkeep in mind that we are not infallible, nor are we the reposi-\ntory of ultimate wisdom. Elected officials, who are much\ncloser to ground zero than we are—and whose political power\nebbs and flows with the approval of the voters—understand\nthe realities of the situation far better than we can, no matter\nhow many depositions and expert reports we may read in the\nquiet of our chambers. It therefore behooves us to approach\nissues such as those presented here with a healthy dose of\nmodesty about our ability to understand the past or predict the\nfuture. It should make us chary about use of the strict scrutiny\nstandard of review, which proclaims us the ultimate arbiters\nof the issue and gives those who oppose the policy in question\n\f14716       PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\nevery incentive to turn litigation, to paraphrase Clausewitz,\ninto a continuation of politics by other means.\n\n   To resort to Chief Judge Boudin’s words one last time, “we\nare faced with a local experiment, pursuing plausible goals by\nnovel means that are not squarely condemned by past\nSupreme Court precedent. The problems that the . . . plan\naddresses are real, and time is more likely than court hearings\nto tell us whether the solution is a good one . . . .” Comfort,\n418 F.3d at 29 (Boudin, C.J., concurring). I share Judge\nBoudin’s preference for resolving such difficult issues by trial\nand error in the real world, rather than by experts jousting in\nthe courtroom. When it comes to a plan such as this—a plan\nthat gives the American melting pot a healthy stir without\nbenefitting or burdening any particular group—I would leave\nthe decision to those much closer to the affected community,\nwho have the power to reverse or modify the policy should it\nprove unworkable. It is on this basis that I would affirm the\njudgment of the district court.\n\n\n\nBEA, Circuit Judge, with whom Circuit Judges KLEINFELD,\nTALLMAN and CALLAHAN join dissenting:\n\n  I respectfully dissent.\n\n   At the outset, it is important to note what this case is not\nabout. The idea that children will gain social, civic, and per-\nhaps educational skills by attending schools with a proportion\nof students of other ethnicities and races, which proportion\nreflects the world in which they will move, is a notion\ngrounded in common sense. It may be generally, if not univer-\nsally, accepted.1 But that is not the issue here. The issue here\nis whether this idea may be imposed by government coercion,\nrather than societal conviction; whether students and their par-\n  1\n   For a dissenting view, see infra pp. 14731-33.\n\f             PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.                 14717\nents may choose, or whether their government may choose for\nthem.2\n\n   In the Seattle School District (“District”), some schools are\noversubscribed and in higher demand than others, so the Dis-\ntrict uses a tiebreaker to assign some ninth-grade students, and\nnot others, to those schools. The tiebreaker operates solely on\nthe basis of the student’s race. In fact, rather than differentiat-\ning between African-American, Asian-American, Latino,\nNative American, or Caucasian students, the tiebreaker classi-\nfies students only as “white” or “nonwhite.”3 The District\nseeks a racially balanced student body of 40% white, 60%\nnonwhite children; the tiebreaker excludes white or nonwhite\nstudents from an oversubscribed school if their admission will\nnot further that preferred ratio.\n\n   Notwithstanding the majority’s fervent defense of that plan,\nthe District is engaged in simple racial balancing, which the\nEqual Protection Clause forbids. The majority can arrive at\nthe opposite conclusion only by applying a watered-down\n  2\n     Because of our country’s struggle with racial division and the injustices\nof compelled government de jure segregation, we must be especially\nsuspicious of any compulsive government program based upon race, even\nwhen such a program is supposedly beneficial. Good intentions cannot\ninsulate the government’s use of race from the commands of the Equal\nProtection Clause; history is rife with examples of well-intentioned gov-\nernment programs which later caused grievous harm to society and indi-\nviduals. See Adarand Constructors v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200, 226 (1995)\n(“More than good motives should be required when government seeks to\nallocate its resources by way of an explicit racial classification system.”);\nOlmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438, 479 (1928) (Brandeis, J., dissent-\ning) (“Experience should teach us to be most on our guard to protect lib-\nerty when the Government’s purposes are beneficent. . . . The greatest\ndangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well-\nmeaning but without understanding.”).\n   3\n     This makes all the more puzzling the majority’s assertion that “that the\nDistrict has a compelling interest in securing the educational and social\nbenefits of racial (and ethnic) diversity.” Majority op. 14660 (emphasis\nadded). There simply is no ethnic tiebreaker.\n\f14718        PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\nstandard of review—improperly labeled “strict scrutiny”—\nwhich contains none of the attributes common to our most\nstringent standard of review. I respectfully disagree with the\nmajority’s gentle endorsement of the racial tiebreaker and\nwould instead hold the District violates the Equal Protection\nClause whenever it excludes a student from a school solely on\nthe basis of race.\n\n                                     I.\n\n   As an introductory note, I call attention to the majority’s\nfrequent misuse of the terms “segregation,” “segregated\nschools,” and “segregated housing patterns.” See, e.g., Major-\nity op. at 14660, 14661. As a perfectly understandable rhetori-\ncal ploy, the majority continually uses those charged terms\nwhen there has been no such segregation in the Seattle\nschools in any textual or legal sense.4 Throughout the desegre-\ngation cases, the U.S. Supreme Court stated that only the\nremediation of de jure segregation justified the use of racial\nclassifications. Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. 467, 494 (1992).\n“[T]he differentiating factor between de jure segregation and\nso-called de facto segregation . . . is purpose or intent to seg-\nregate.” Keyes v. School Dist. No. 1, 413 U.S. 189, 208 (1973)\n(emphasis in original); see Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg\nBd. of Educ., 402 U.S. 1, 17 (1971) (“ ‘Desegregation’ means\nthe assignment of students to public schools and within such\nschools without regard to their race, color, religion, or\nnational origin, but ‘desegregation’ shall not mean the assign-\nment of students to public schools in order to overcome racial\nimbalance.”) (emphasis added).\n\n  “Segregate” is a transitive verb. It requires an actor to do\nan act which effects segregation. See OXFORD ENGLISH DICTIO-\n  4\n   Remediation of de jure segregation is not at issue here; the parties con-\ncede the District’s schools have never been de jure segregated. No one\neven suggests that Seattle’s housing market has ever been affected by de\njure segregation.\n\f            PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.             14719\nNARY  (2d ed. 1989) (“segregate, v. 1. a. trans.: To separate (a\nperson, a body or class of persons) from the general body, or\nfrom some particular class; to set apart, isolate, seclude”).5\nInstead of de jure segregation, what the majority describes is\nracial imbalance in the District’s schools and Seattle’s resi-\ndential makeup.\n\n   Of course, it is much easier to argue for measures to end\n“segregation” than for measures to avoid “racial imbalance.”\nEspecially is this so in view of the U.S. Supreme Court’s fre-\nquent pronouncements that “racial balancing” violates the\nEqual Protection Clause. See Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S.\n306, 330 (2003) (“[O]utright racial balancing . . . is patently\nunconstitutional.”); Freeman, 503 U.S. at 494 (“Racial bal-\nance is not to be achieved for its own sake.”); Regents of the\nUniv. of Calif. v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 307 (1978) (Powell,\nJ.) (“If petitioner’s purpose is to assure within its student body\nsome specified percentage of a particular group merely\nbecause of its race or ethnic origin, such a preferential pur-\npose must be rejected not as insubstantial but as facially\ninvalid. Preferring members of any one group for no reason\nother than race or ethnic origin is discrimination for its own\nsake. This the Constitution forbids.”).\n\n  It should be remembered by the reader of the majority opin-\nion that one can no more “segregate” without a person\nactively doing the segregation than one can separate an egg\nwithout a cook.\n\n   Like Judge Boudin,6 in his concurring opinion Judge Koz-\ninski tries to distinguish past Supreme Court cases involving\nracial discrimination by focusing on the effects of the discrim-\nination, rather than the fact of the discrimination.\n  5\n     Indeed, the term “de facto segregation” is somewhat of an oxymoron.\nThat is perhaps why the Supreme Court preceded the term with the quali-\nfier “so-called.” See Keyes, 413 U.S. at 208.\n   6\n     See Comfort v. Lynn Sch. Comm., 418 F.3d 1, 27 (1st Cir. 2005)\n(Boudin, C.J., concurring).\n\f14720        PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\n   This creates for them two categories different from the\neffects of the Seattle plan: (1) the effects of other race dis-\ncrimination plans were much worse than Seattle’s and (2) the\neffects were visited on certain races.\n\n   But the difference reflected in these two categories are\nirrelevant. “[T]here is no de minimis exception to the Equal\nProtection Clause. Race discrimination is never a ‘trifle.’ ”\nMonterey Mechanical Co. v. Wilson, 125 F.3d 702, 712 (9th\nCir. 1997). Second, the Fourteenth Amendment protects indi-\nvidual rights, not the rights of certain races or groups.\n\n  Further, that a “plan does not segregate persons by race”7\ndoes not justify it in refusing school admission to a qualified\nscholar because he does not belong to a particular race. There\nwas no segregation by race at Cal Davis medical school, when\nBakke was improperly refused admission. See Bakke, 438\nU.S. 265.\n\n   Also, it is quite accurate to say the Seattle plan does not\n“involve racial quotas.”8 The numerical quota is the percent-\nage by which the school in question’s racial composition dif-\nfers from the school district’s target.9 Not calling it a quota,\ndoes not make it something other. “A rose by any other name\n. . . etc.”\n\n   Perhaps the Supreme Court will adopt a “rational relation”\nbasis for review of race-based discrimination by government,\nbased on the concurrence’s view of what is “realistic” or what\nare “real-world circumstances.”10 As indicated above, how-\n  7\n     Id.\n  8\n     Concurrence at 14710-11 (citing Comfort, 418 F.3d at 27 (Boudin,\nC.J., concurring).\n   9\n     See infra pp. 14745-48 (discussion of why the racial tiebreaker used by\nSeattle is a quota).\n   10\n      What is “the reality” or “realistic” or “real-world” is usually a rhetori-\ncal tool for dressing up one’s own view as objective and impartial, and\ntherefore, more presentable.\n\f            PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.             14721\never, it certainly has given no such indication.11 But if it does,\none doubts that it will do so based on a “melting pot” meta-\nphor.\n\n   Up to now, the American “melting pot” has been made up\nof people voluntarily coming to this country from different\nlands, putting aside their differences and embracing our com-\nmon values. To date it has not meant people who are told\nwhether they are white or non-white, and where to go to\nschool based on their race.\n\n   The suggestion that local political forces should decide\nwhen to employ racial discrimination in the allocation of gov-\nernmental resources is certainly nothing new in American his-\ntory. Such “local option” discrimination was adopted in the\nMissouri Compromise of 1820, which established the Mason-\nDixon line, and the Compromise of 1850. But since then, the\nCivil War, the post-war Amendments to the Constitution and\nBrown v. Bd. of Ed. of Topeka, Shawnee County, Kan., 347\nU.S. 483 (1954) have made racial discrimination a matter of\nnational concern and national governance.\n\n  As noted in the opening lines of this dissenting opinion, it\ncertainly is rational to believe that racial balancing in schools\nachieves better racial socialization and, as a result, better citi-\nzens. The issue is not that, but whether what is rational can\nbe achieved by compulsory racial discrimination by the State.\n\n                                  II.\n\n   I agree with the majority that the District’s use of the racial\ntiebreaker is a racial classification, and all racial classifica-\ntions are subject to “strict scrutiny” review under the Equal\nProtection Clause. See Majority op. at 14672. Yet the majority\n  11\n    See e.g. Adarand, 515 U.S. at 224, Gratz v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 244,\n270 (2003), Johnson v. California, 125 S.Ct. 1141, 1146 (2005). On this\npoint, the majority agrees. See Majority op. pp. 14670-71 n.12.\n\f14722      PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\nconceives of strict scrutiny as some type of relaxed, deferen-\ntial standard of review. I view it differently.\n\n   “No State shall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdic-\ntion the equal protection of the laws.” U.S. Const., amend.\nXIV, § 1. The right to equal protection is an individual one,\nand so where federal or state governments classify a person\naccording to race—“a group classification long recognized as\nin most circumstances irrelevant and therefore prohibited”—\nwe review such state action under the most “detailed judicial\ninquiry”—that is, under strict scrutiny. Grutter, 539 U.S. at\n326; see Miller v. Johnson, 515 U.S. 900, 911 (1995) (“At the\nheart of the Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection lies\nthe simple command that the Government must treat citizens\nas individuals, not as simply components of a racial, religious,\nsexual or national class.)” (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n   The right to equal protection is held equally among all indi-\nviduals. “[A]ll racial classifications reviewable under the\nEqual Protection Clause must be strictly scrutinized.” Ada-\nrand, 515 U.S. at 224 (1995) (emphasis added). Strict scrutiny\napplies regardless whether the racial classifications are invidi-\nous or benign and “is not dependent on the race of those bur-\ndened or benefited by a particular classification.” Gratz, 539\nU.S. at 270; see Johnson, 125 S. Ct. at 1146 (“We have\ninsisted on strict scrutiny in every context, even for so-called\n‘benign’ racial classifications, such as race-conscious univer-\nsity admissions policies, race-based preferences in govern-\nment contracts, and race-based districting intended to improve\nminority representation.”) (internal citations omitted). We\nrequire such a demanding inquiry “to ‘smoke out’ illegitimate\nuses of race by assuring that the legislative body is pursuing\na goal important enough to warrant use of a highly suspect\ntool.” Adarand, 515 U.S. at 226.\n\n   The right to equal protection provides a liberty; it repre-\nsents freedom from government coercion based upon racial\nclassifications. See Miller, 515 U.S. at 904 (the Equal Protec-\n\f           PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.        14723\ntion Clause’s “central mandate is racial neutrality in govern-\nmental decisionmaking”). Thus, under strict scrutiny, all\nracial classifications by the government, regardless of pur-\nported motivation, are “inherently suspect,” Adarand, 515\nU.S. at 223, and “presumptively invalid,” Shaw v. Reno, 509\nU.S. 630, 643-44 (1993). They are permissible only where the\ngovernment proves their use is “narrowly tailored to further\ncompelling governmental interests.” Grutter, 539 U.S. at 326.\n\n   It follows, then, that the government carries the burden of\nproving that its use of racial classifications satisfies strict\nscrutiny. Johnson, 125 S. Ct. at 1146 n.1 (“We put the burden\non state actors to demonstrate that their race-based policies\nare justified.”); Gratz, 539 U.S. at 270; W. States Paving Co.,\nInc. v. Wash. State Dep’t of Transp., 407 F.3d 983, 990 (9th\nCir. 2005) (“The burden of justifying different treatment by\nethnicity . . . is always on the government.”) (quoting Monte-\nrey Mech. Co. v. Wilson, 125 F.3d 702, 713 (9th Cir. 1997).\n\n   Despite this formidable standard of review, the majority\ndoes not hesitate to endorse the District’s use of the racial tie-\nbreaker. Rather than recognizing the protections of the indi-\nvidual against governmental racial classifications, the\nmajority instead endorses a rigid racial governmental group-\ning of high school students for the purpose of attaining racial\nbalance in the schools. For the reasons expressed below, I do\nnot share in the majority’s confidence that such a plan is con-\nstitutionally permissible.\n\n                               III.\n\n   I consider first whether the District has asserted a “compel-\nling governmental interest,” the first element of the strict scru-\ntiny test. The District contends it has a valid compelling\ngovernmental interest in using racial balancing to achieve “the\neducational and social benefits of racial . . . diversity” within\nits high schools and avoid “racially concentrated” schools.\nThe District argues its interest will enhance student discussion\n\f14724      PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\nof racial issues in high school and will foster cross-racial\nsocialization and understanding, both in school and later in\nthe students’ lives.\n\n   The U.S. Supreme Court has “declined to define compel-\nling interest or to tell [the lower courts] how to apply that\nterm.” Hunter v. Regents of the Univ. of Calif., 190 F.3d 1061,\n1070 n.9 (9th Cir. 1999) (Beezer, J., dissenting); Mark R. Kil-\nlenbeck, Pushing Things Up to Their First Principles: Reflec-\ntions on the Values of Affirmative Action, 87 Calif. L. Rev.\n1299, 1349 (1999) (the definition of a compelling interest “is\nadmittedly imprecise. The Supreme Court has never offered\na workable definition of the term . . . and is unlikely ever to\ndo so, preferring to approach matters on a case-by-case\nbasis”).\n\n   The majority is correct in noting the U.S. Supreme Court\nhas never endorsed “racial balancing” as a “compelling inter-\nest.” Indeed, throughout the history of strict scrutiny, the\nSupreme Court has rejected as invalid all such asserted com-\npelling interests, save for two exceptions. With respect, the\nmajority errs in creating a third.\n\n                              A.\n\n   The Court has endorsed two race-based compelling govern-\nmental interests in the public education context. First, the\nCourt has allowed racial classifications to remedy past racial\nimbalances in schools resulting from past de jure segregation.\nFreeman, 503 U.S. at 494. Second, the Court has allowed\nundergraduate and graduate universities to consider race as\npart of an overall, flexible assessment of an individual’s char-\nacteristics to attain student body diversity.

See Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U.S. 899,\n\f             PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.                14725\n909-12 (1996) (rejecting racial classifications to “alleviate the\neffects of societal discrimination” in the absence of findings\nof past discrimination, and to promote minority representation\nin Congress); Richmond v.

A crucial guiding point here—and\none elided entirely by the majority—is the Court’s consistent\nreiteration that “outright racial balancing . . . is patently\nunconstitutional.” See, e.g., Grutter, 539 U.S. at 330.\n\n   Thus, we face a landscape littered with rejected asserted\n“compelling interests” requiring race-based determinations,\nbut with two exceptions still standing. The first exception is\ninapplicable here because the Seattle schools have never been\nde jure segregated. See Freeman, 503 U.S. at 494.\n\n   The second exception is also inapplicable, albeit not so\ndirectly acknowledged. At oral argument, the District con-\nceded that it is not asserting the Grutter “diversity” interest;\nthe majority recognizes this in stating the District’s asserted\ninterest is “significantly different” in some ways from the\ninterest asserted in Grutter.

The very differences between the Grutter “diversi-\nty” interest and the District’s asserted interest illustrate why\nthe latter violates the Equal Protection Clause as opposed to\nthe former. The Grutter “diversity” interest focuses upon the\nindividual, of which race plays a part, but not the whole. The\nDistrict’s asserted interest, however, focuses only upon race,\nrunning afoul of equal protection’s focus upon the individual.\n\n                                     B.\n\n  In Grutter and Gratz, the Court made clear that the valid\ncompelling interest in “diversity” does not translate into a\n\n   Indeed, “context” does matter; context always matters in the application\nof general rules of law to varied factual settings. See Gomillion v. Light-\nfoot, 364 U.S. 339, 343-44 (1960) (“Particularly in dealing with claims\nunder broad provisions of the Constitution, which derive content by an\ninterpretive process of inclusion and exclusion, it is imperative that gener-\nalizations, based on and qualified by the concrete situations that gave rise\nto them, must not be applied out of context in disregard of variant control-\nling facts.”). In Grutter, the “context” was a public law school’s race-\nconscious, individualized consideration of applicants for purposes of\nadmissions, designed to achieve diversity. Here, the context is different;\nwe consider a rigid racial tiebreaker, which considers only race, designed\nto avoid racial imbalance in the schools. And so, as we do for all cases,\nwe look to general principles of law and apply them through the correct\nstandard of review, cognizant of the different results reached in other cases\nbecause of different facts and the “context” in which the cases arose. But\nwhat must be remembered is that a different “context” does not change the\ngeneral rules of law, nor does a different “context” change the applicable\nstandard of review (at least for government-imposed racial classifications).\n   Yes, “context” matters, but the mention of “context” should not be a tal-\nisman to banish further enquiry. The “context” of the Michigan Law\nSchool is different from the District’s schools. But the difference is in the\nage of the students, their number and the obligation of the District to admit\nall students. Does that change the fact that some students are sent to cer-\ntain schools solely because of their races? How does “context” change\nthat? Let us not succumb to the use of an abstraction (“context”) to invoke\n“sensitivity” to “nuances,” thus to attempt to change the bald fact of selec-\ntion based on race.\n\f             PARENTS INVOLVED v.

Rather, the diversity that furthers a compelling\n       state interest encompasses a far broader array of\n       qualifications and characteristics of which racial or\n       ethnic origin is but a single though important ele-\n       ment.\n\nGrutter, 539 U.S. at 324-25 (emphasis added); see Gratz, 539\nU.S. at 272-73 (“[T]he critical criteria [in a permissible race-\nconscious admissions program] are often individual qualities\nor experiences not dependent upon race but sometimes associ-\nated with it.”).\n\n   The Grutter “diversity” interest focuses upon the individ-\nual, which can include the applicant’s race, but also includes\nother factors, such as the applicant’s family background, her\nparent’s educational history, whether she is fluent in other\nlanguages, whether she has overcome adversity or hardship,\nor whether she has unique athletic or artistic talents. See 539\nU.S. at 338. Such a focus is consistent with the Equal Protec-\ntion Clause, which protects the individual, not groups.\n\n   But here, the District’s operation of the racial tiebreaker\ndoes not consider the applicant as an individual. To the con-\ntrary, the racial tiebreaker considers only whether the student\nis white or nonwhite. While the Grutter “diversity” interest\npursues genuine diversity in the student body (of which race\nis only a single “plus” factor), the District pursues an interest\nwhich considers only racial diversity, i.e., a predefined group-\ning of races in the District’s schools.13 Such an interest is not\n  13\n    The majority fails to recognize this distinction.

See id. at 330 (stating\na government institution’s interest “to assure within its stu-\ndent body some specified percentage of a particular group\nmerely because of its race . . . would amount to outright racial\nbalancing, which is patently unconstitutional”).\n\n   Grutter emphasized the dangers resulting from lack of an\nindividualized consideration of each applicant. Observing that\nthe Michigan Law School sought an unquantified “critical\nmass” of minority students to avoid only token representation,\nrather than some defined balance, id. at 330, the Court rea-\nsoned the law school’s individualized focus on students form-\ning that “critical mass” would avoid perpetuating the\nstereotype that all “minority students always . . . express some\ncharacteristic minority viewpoint on any issue,” id. at 333.\n\n   But here, the District’s concept of racial diversity is a pre-\ndetermined, defined ratio of white and nonwhite children. The\nracial tiebreaker works to exclude white students from schools\nthat have a 50-55% white student body (depending on the tie-\nbreaker trigger used in a particular year), and works to\nexclude nonwhite students from schools with a 70-75% non-\nwhite student body (depending on the tiebreaker trigger used).\nThus, the District’s concept of racial diversity does not permit\n\nmajority reasons high schools “have an equal if not more important role”\nin preparing students for work and citizenship, and concludes “it would be\na perverse reading of the Equal Protection Clause that would allow a uni-\nversity, educating a relatively small percentage of the population, to use\nrace when choosing its student body but not allow a public school district,\neducating all children attending its schools, to consider a student’s race in\norder to ensure that the high schools within the district attain and maintain\ndiverse student bodies.” Majority op. at 14676, 14678. Yet Grutter did not\nallow universities to consider race in admissions to achieve racial balanc-\ning. The whole point of Grutter and Gratz was that universities may con-\nsider race, but only as part of the overall individual. I see nothing perverse\nin recognizing the Equal Protection Clause to be the protector of the indi-\nvidual, whether he be among the few at an elite law school, or among the\nmany in a public high school.\n\f             PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.                 14729\na school with a student body that is too white, or a school with\na student body that is too nonwhite.\n\n   The District argues its concept of racial diversity is neces-\nsary to foster classroom discussion and cross-racial socializa-\ntion. That argument, however, is based on the stereotype that\nall white children express traditional white viewpoints and\nexhibit traditional white mannerisms; all nonwhite children\nexpress opposite nonwhite viewpoints and exhibit nonwhite\nmannerisms, and thereby white and nonwhite children will\nbetter understand each other. Yet there is nothing in the racial\ntiebreaker to ensure such viewpoints and mannerisms are rep-\nresented within the preferred student body ratio. As noted in\nGrutter, the only way to achieve diverse viewpoints and man-\nnerisms is to look at the individual student. White children\nhave different viewpoints and backgrounds than other white\nchildren; the same goes for nonwhite children; and some\nwhite children have the same viewpoints and backgrounds as\nsome nonwhite children. The assumption that there is a differ-\nence between individuals just because there is a difference in\ntheir skin color is a stereotype in itself, nothing more.14\n\n   The District also claims it must use the racial tiebreaker to\navoid racially imbalanced schools, which may result in\nschools with large white or nonwhite student bodies and in\nwhich the supposed benefits from the District’s concept of\nracial diversity will not occur. This theory, however, presents\nanother racial stereotype, which assumes there is something\nwrong with a school that has a heavy nonwhite student body\npopulation, or something better about a school that has a\nheavy white student body population. See Missouri v. Jenkins,\n515 U.S. 70, 122 (1995) (Thomas, J., concurring) (“After all,\n  14\n    Again, there is nothing illegal in freely choosing to believe in this ste-\nreotype and to act upon it as a private citizen in sending one’s child to a\nparticular school. The case changes when such racial stereotype is\naccepted by the state, and is the basis for the imposition of racial discrimi-\nnation.\n\f14730        PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\nif separation itself is a harm, and if integration therefore is the\nonly way that blacks can receive a proper education, then\nthere must be something inferior about blacks. Under this the-\nory, segregation injures blacks because blacks, when left on\ntheir own, cannot achieve. To my way of thinking, that con-\nclusion is the result of a jurisprudence based upon a theory of\nblack inferiority.”).\n\n   Besides the District’s reliance on racial stereotypes, there is\ngood reason categorically to forbid racial balancing. The pro-\ncess of classifying children in groups of color, rather than\nviewing them as individuals, encourages “notions of racial\ninferiority” in both white and nonwhite children and incites\nracial hostility. See Grutter, 539 U.S. at 328. Indeed, those\nrisks are particularly great here because of the blunt nature of\nthe racial tiebreaker. The District’s racial grouping of stu-\ndents, either as white or nonwhite, assumes that each minority\nstudent is the same, regardless whether he is African-\nAmerican, Asian-American, Latino, or Native American; the\nonly difference noted by the District is that the minority stu-\ndent is not white.15 The District thus “conceives of racial\ndiversity in simplistic terms as a dichotomy between white\nand nonwhite, as if to say all nonwhites are interchangeable.”\nParents Involved in Cmty.

That generalization declines to note a particularly\noverbearing facet of the racial tiebreaker. Although the District encourages\nthe students’ parents to identify the race of their student in the registration\nmaterials, if a parent or student chooses to follow the example of Tiger\nWoods and refuses to identify his or her race, the District then engages in\na visual inspection of the student or parent and will decide the child’s\ncolor notwithstanding the parent’s or student’s choice.\n\f           PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.        14731\n   Unlike a voluntary decision by parents to expose their chil-\ndren to individuals of different races or background, the Dis-\ntrict classifies each student by skin color and excludes certain\nstudents from particular schools—solely on the basis of race\n—to ensure those schools remain racially balanced. Even if\nwell-intentioned, the District’s use of racial classifications in\nsuch a stark and compulsory fashion risks perpetuating the\nsame racial divisions which have plagued this country since\nits founding:\n\n    Race is perhaps the worst imaginable category\n    around which to organize group competition and\n    social relations more generally. At the risk of bela-\n    boring the obvious, racial categories in law have\n    played an utterly pernicious and destructive role\n    throughout human history. This incontrovertible fact\n    should arouse wonder . . . at the hubris of those who\n    imagine that we can distinguish clearly enough\n    between invidious and benign race discrimination to\n    engrave this distinction into our constitutional order.\n    Vast human experience mocks this comforting illu-\n    sion, as does the fact that most Americans, including\n    many minorities, think racial preferences are invidi-\n    ous, not benign. Whether benignly intended or not,\n    using the category of race—which affirmative action\n    proponents oddly depict as socially constructed and\n    primordial and immutable—to distribute advantage\n    and disadvantage tends to ossify the fluid, forward-\n    looking political identities that a robust democratic\n    spirit inspires and requires.\n\nPeter H. Schuck, Affirmative Action: Past, Present, and\nFuture, 20 Yale L. & Pol’y Rev. 1, 92-93 (2002).\n\n   We should not minimize these shadows that are cast over\nthe supposed benefits of the District’s asserted interest. The\nDistrict’s stark racial classifications not only offend intrinsic\nnotions of individuality, they even suggest principles opposite\n\f14732      PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\nto what the District claims to seek. Although the District con-\ntends it uses the racial tiebreaker for good, i.e., to foster cross-\nracial socialization and understanding, the District’s concept\nof racial diversity also suggests other principles which many\nmay find objectionable, especially when taught to children:\n\n    While a public law preference does express a certain\n    kind of compassion for and commitment to the pre-\n    ferred groups, other signals dominate its message -\n    among them, that American society thinks it just to\n    group people by race and ethnicity, to treat those\n    groups monolithically, and to allocate precious\n    resources and opportunities accordingly; that it holds\n    equal treatment and individual merit as secondary,\n    dispensable ideals; that the preferred groups cannot\n    succeed without special public favors; that such\n    favors do not stigmatize them in the minds of fair-\n    minded others; that those who oppose preferences\n    thereby oppose the aspirations of the preferred\n    groups; and that society can assuage old injustices by\n    creating new ones. When public law says such\n    things, it speaks falsely, holds out vain promises, and\n    brings itself into disrepute.\n\nId. at 87-88.\n\n   The District’s asserted interest may be supported by noble\ngoals. But the stereotypes on which it is based, and the risks\nthat it presents, make that interest far from compelling.\n\n                                C.\n\n   The sociological evidence presented by the District, relied\nupon strongly by the majority, does not change my view. The\nmajority discusses much of the evidence that supports the\nDistrict’s position that racially balanced schools foster cross-\nracial socialization and understanding in school and later in\nthe students’ lives. Majority op. at 14675-76. Yet the majority\n\f           PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.        14733\nputs aside the other evidence suggesting there is no definitive\nagreement as to the beneficial effects of racial balance in K-\n12 schools, that the benefits attributed to racially balanced\nschools are often weak, and that any benefits do not always\nhave a direct correlation to racial balance. Yet again, a private\ncitizen is free to accept one body of opinion and reject another\nin deciding to send his child to a particular school. Is the state\nsimilarly privileged when required to determine that its\nclaimed goal is a “compelling interest”? One would think that\nto be “compelling” there would be no room for doubt of the\nneed for the measure. That is certainly not the case here.\n\n   For example, a source provided by the District states that\n“family background has a significantly stronger effect on stu-\ndent achievement than any other single school factor or con-\nstellation of school factors, including school racial and ethnic\ncomposition.” [SER 182.] Another source presented by the\nDistrict states that court-ordered desegregation (i.e., a court-\nordered breakup of a de jure segregated student body)\nresulted in only minimal benefits:\n\n    [R]esearch suggests that desegregation has had some\n    positive effect on the reading skills of African Amer-\n    ican youngsters. The effect is not large, nor does it\n    occur in all situations, but a modest measurable\n    effect does seem apparent. Such is not the case with\n    mathematical skills, which seem generally unaf-\n    fected by desegregation. Second, there is some evi-\n    dence that desegregation may help to break what can\n    be thought of as a generational cycle of segregation\n    and racial isolation. Although research on this topic\n    is scant and often marred by unavoidable flaws, evi-\n    dence has begun to accumulate that desegregation\n    may favorably influence such adult outcomes as col-\n    lege graduation, income, and employment patterns.\n    The measured effects are often weak . . . .\n\n[SER 205, 207-208.]\n\f14734        PARENTS INVOLVED v.

Virtually\nall of the reviewers determined that few, if any, firm conclusions about the\nimpact of desegregation on intergroup relations could be drawn. The\nreluctance of reviewers to draw conclusions about the benefits of school\ndesegregation for race relations or self-esteem only reinforces our conclu-\nsion that the psychological harm theory of de facto segregation and the\nsocial benefit theory of desegregation are clearly wrong, at least when\napplied to desegregation as a racial balance policy.’ ”).\n\f           PARENTS INVOLVED v.

Other studies sug-\ngest that where racial classifications are a means of achieving\nracial balance, academic achievement by minorities is hin-\ndered, and racial tensions are riled:\n\n    In a culture that ardently affirms the principles of\n    individual freedom, merit, and equality of opportu-\n    nity, [the] demoralization and anger [precipitated by\n    being victim to government-imposed racial classifi-\n    cations] must be counted as a very large social cost.\n    It is no less a cost because it is borne by whites, and\n    often less privileged whites at that. If these princi-\n    ples make it unfair to impose this cost, the fact that\n    the unfairness is spread across a large group of peo-\n    ple may not make it any more palatable. In fact, dif-\n    fusing the unfairness in this way will simply increase\n    the number of people who feel themselves\n    aggrieved.\n\nSchuck, supra, at 69.\n\n   But despite the inconsistencies in the sociological evidence\nand the vivid risks of the District’s asserted interest, the\nmajority implicitly defers to the District’s position. Grutter\ntook a similar approach, emphasizing that its endorsement of\nthe “diversity” interest relied in large part upon deference to\nthe educational judgment of the Michigan Law School. 539\nU.S. at 330.\n\n  Yet perhaps to steal a line from the majority, the “context”\nhere is different. We are not faced with a university’s “aca-\ndemic freedom,” which arises from “a constitutional dimen-\n\f14736      PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\nsion, grounded in the First Amendment, of educational\nautonomy,” and which includes the freedom to select its stu-\ndent body. Id. We instead consider a public high school’s\nadmissions plan which admits or excludes students from par-\nticular schools solely on the basis of their race. For several\nreasons, we should not defer to such a plan.\n\n   First, other than for race-conscious university admissions\nbased on holistic diversity, deference to a government actor\nis inconsistent with strict scrutiny. See Johnson, 125 S. Ct. at\n1146 n.1 (stating generally that “deference [by the courts in\napplying strict scrutiny] is fundamentally at odds with our\nequal protection jurisprudence”); id. at 1150 (stating the\nSupreme Court has “refused to defer to state officials’ judg-\nments on race . . . where those officials traditionally exercise\nsubstantial discretion.”). In Grutter, the Court deferred to the\nMichigan Law School’s “diversity” interest because of the\nlaw school’s “academic freedom”—grounded in the First\nAmendment and including the law school’s freedom to select\nits own student body—and the law school’s asserted need for\ndiversity to achieve a “robust exchange of ideas” within its\nclassrooms, a vital part of the law school’s mission. 539 U.S.\nat 330.\n\n   None of those same issues are implicated here. The “aca-\ndemic freedom” of a university allows it “to determine for\nitself on academic grounds who may teach, what may be\ntaught, how it shall be taught, and who may be admitted to\nstudy.” Bakke, 438 U.S. at 312 (Powell, J.). High schools do\nnot have such similar freedoms. They cannot determine who\nmay teach, at least when that determination is based upon\nracial grounds. See Wygant, 476 U.S. at 274-76. They also\ncannot determine who may be admitted to study; when the\ngovernment chooses to provide public education in secondary\nschools, it “must be made available to all on equal terms.” See\nPlyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 221-23 (1982). Further, there is\nno comparable line of U.S. Supreme Court cases affording\nhigh schools the special “[A]cademic freedom[s]” granted to\n\f           PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.        14737\nuniversities by the First Amendment. See United States v.\nFordice, 505 U.S. 717, 728-29 (1992) (“a state university sys-\ntem is quite different in very relevant respects from primary\nand secondary schools.”); Jay P. Lechner, Learning From\nExperience: Why Racial Diversity Cannot Be a Legally Com-\npelling Interest in Elementary and Secondary Education, 32\nSW. U. L. Rev. 201, 215 (2003) (stating the Supreme Court\n“has been less deferential to the discretion of elementary or\nsecondary school officials in Equal Protection cases, in part\nbecause the Court has viewed school desegregation as serving\nsocial rather than educational goals. The Court has acknowl-\nedged that even the most important, delicate, and highly dis-\ncretionary functions of state educators are subject to the limits\nof the Bill of Rights and subordinate to the Constitutional\nfreedoms of the individual. Moreover, the educational bene-\nfits from diversity, if any, are much greater at the higher edu-\ncational level because such benefits are greatly magnified by\nthe learning that takes place outside the classroom—in dormi-\ntories, social settings, and extracurricular activities—as stu-\ndents must learn to live and work with persons of other races\nand ethnic backgrounds.”) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n   Moreover, there is a crucial difference between the “robust\nexchange of ideas” theory referenced in Grutter and the Dis-\ntrict’s claim that its interest “brings different viewpoints and\nexperiences to classroom discussions and thereby enhances\nthe educational process.” [ER 237.] The District applies the\nracial tiebreaker only to entering ninth-grade students. [ER\n253, 308.] It is self-evident that classroom discussion plays a\nsignificantly more vital role in universities with their typical\ndialectic or Socratic teaching method, than in ninth-grade\nhigh school courses with their typical didactic or rote teaching\nmethod.\n\n   Last, the District’s claim that its asserted interest helps to\nfoster cross-racial socialization and understanding later in the\nstudents’ lives is a sociological judgment outside the expertise\nof the District’s educators. Those external benefits are diffuse,\n\f14738        PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\nmanifest long after students leave the classroom, and cannot\nbe measured with skills possessed uniquely by educators.\nUnlike Grutter, which deferred to the Law School on the\nbasis that diversity in the classroom was vital to its educa-\ntional mission during the three-year law school curriculum,\nhere, the District’s asserted interest depends upon benefits\nonly loosely linked to the District’s educational mission and\nto take effect years after its schooling of the children, or\nentirely outside the expertise of its educators. Here, high\nschool administrators and teachers are predicting what sociol-\nogists will find years later.\n\n   Strict scrutiny cannot remain strict if we defer to judgments\nnot even within the particular expertise or observation of the\nparty being scrutinized. Hence, deference is not due to the\nDistrict regarding the benefits the District contends are attrib-\nutable to its claimed interest.17\n  17\n     The majority states that Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of\nEduc., 402 U.S. 1 (1971), supports the proposition that the District has\nbroad discretion to engage in racial balancing as an “educational policy.”\nIn Swann, the Supreme Court stated: “School authorities are traditionally\ncharged with broad power to formulate and implement educational policy\nand might well conclude, for example, that in order to prepare students to\nlive in a pluralistic society each school should have a prescribed ratio of\nNegro to white students reflecting the proportion for the district as a\nwhole. To do this as an educational policy is within the broad discretion-\nary powers of school authorities; absent a finding of a constitutional viola-\ntion, however, that would not be within the authority of a federal court.”\nId. at 16; see also North Carolina State Bd. of Educ. v. Swann, 402 U.S.\n43, 45 (1971) (same, citing Swann, 402 U.S. at 16).\n   Swann’s passage seems to provide powerful language for the majority’s\nposition, but alas, the majority takes the passage out of context. Swann\nconsidered the remedies available to a federal court to combat past de jure\nsegregation. The Court never considered whether a school district could\nuse racial classifications to achieve racial balance absent de jure segrega-\ntion. Indeed, the Court stated: “We are concerned in these cases with the\nelimination of the discrimination inherent in the dual school systems, not\nwith myriad factors of human existence which can cause discrimination in\na multitude of ways on racial, religious, or ethnic grounds. . . . Our objec-\n\f             PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.                 14739\n   In the absence of deference to the District’s sociological\nevidence, the faults of the District’s asserted interest come\ninto sharper focus. It has none of the saving graces present in\nthe Grutter holistic diversity interest. It perpetuates racial ste-\nreotypes and risks fomenting racial hostility. Last, the District\nenforces the interest through government compulsion in the\nstarkest black and white terms, espousing the principle that\nrace trumps the individual.\n\n   The sociological evidence presented by the District sug-\ngests that some benefits will accrue from racial balancing. To\nme, evidence of some benefits does not satisfy the District’s\nburden of proving a compelling governmental interest, espe-\ncially in light of the Supreme Court’s frequent pronounce-\nments that racial balancing itself is unconstitutional. Thus,\nviewed under the lens of strict scrutiny, and without the defer-\nence invoked in Grutter, the District’s interest is simply not\na compelling governmental interest. Hence, I would hold that\nthe District’s operation of the racial tiebreaker is an impermis-\nsible racial classification and violates the Equal Protection\nClause.\n\ntive in dealing with the issues presented by these cases is to see that school\nauthorities exclude no pupil of a racial minority from any school, directly\nor indirectly, on account of race; it does not and cannot embrace all the\nproblems of racial prejudice, even when those problems contribute to dis-\nproportionate racial concentrations in some schools.” Id. at 22-23\n(emphasis added).\n   Swann was also decided decades before the Court resolved the issue of\nthe level of scrutiny to apply to “benign” racial classifications, vis-a-vis\n“invidious” racial classifications. Thus, Swann’s dictum cannot shelter the\nDistrict’s use of the racial tiebreaker from the searching inquiry required\nby strict scrutiny.\n   The majority similarly errs in relying on Washington v. Seattle Sch.\nDist. No. 1, 458 U.S. 457 (1982). There, the Court also specifically stated\nit did not reach the issue of the constitutionality of “race-conscious student\nassignments for the purpose of achieving integration, even absent a find-\ning of prior de jure segregation.” Id. at 472 n.15.\n\f14740      PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\n                              IV.\n\n   Even if the District’s asserted interest were a compelling\ngovernmental interest, the means used by the District must\nstill be narrowly tailored to serve that interest. See Grutter,\n539 U.S. at 333. For argument’s sake, I here assume, without\nconceding, the District has asserted a valid compelling gov-\nernmental interest in using racial balancing to achieve “the\neducational and social benefits of racial . . . diversity” within\nits high schools and to avoid “racially concentrated” schools.\nYet even under that assumption, the District’s use of the racial\ntiebreaker is not narrowly tailored to serve that interest.\n\n   The majority notes that Grutter set forth “five hallmarks of\na narrowly tailored affirmative action plan: (1) individualized\nconsideration of applicants; (2) the absence of quotas; (3)\nserious, good-faith consideration of race-neutral alternatives\nto the affirmative action program; (4) that no member of any\nracial group was unduly harmed; and (5) that the program had\na sunset provision or some other end point.” Majority op. at\n14684-85. I agree with that general formulation. Yet the\nmajority’s application of those factors again evinces an\nimproper deference to the District; such deference is ill suited\nfor the searching inquiry needed under the narrow-tailoring\nprong of strict scrutiny. See Johnson, 125 S. Ct. at 1146 n.1.\nI consider below whether the District’s use of the racial tie-\nbreaker is narrowly tailored to its asserted interest, and con-\nclude that racial tiebreaker is not narrowly tailored.\n\n                               A.\n\n   The first narrow-tailoring factor requires the District to\nengage in an individualized consideration of each applicant’s\ncharacteristics and qualifications. See Grutter, 539 U.S. at\n337. The importance of this factor is self-evident; individual-\nized consideration serves the primary purpose of the Equal\nProtection Clause, which protects the individual from group\nclassifications, especially those by race. See id. at 326.\n\f             PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.         14741\n   Yet the majority concludes that individualized consider-\nation of each applicant is irrelevant here “because of the con-\ntextual differences between institutions of higher learning and\npublic high schools.” Majority op. at 14685. I could not dis-\nagree more.18 By removing consideration of the individual\nfrom the narrow tailoring analysis, the majority threatens to\nread the Equal Protection Clause out of the Constitution. It is\nthe very nature of equal protection to require individualized\nconsideration when the government uses racial classifications:\n“the Fourteenth Amendment “protects persons, not groups.”\nGrutter, 539 U.S. at 326 (quoting Adarand, 515 U.S. at 227)\n(emphasis in original). Grutter emphasized the importance of\nthe individualized consideration of each applicant: in the con-\ntext of a race-conscious university admissions program, such\nconsideration\n\n       must remain flexible enough to ensure that each\n       applicant is evaluated as an individual and not in a\n       way that makes an applicant’s race or ethnicity the\n       defining feature of his or her application. The impor-\n       tance of this individualized consideration in the con-\n       text of a race-conscious admissions program is\n       paramount.\n\nId. at 337 (emphasis added). The differences between univer-\nsity and secondary education do not justify denial of individu-\nalized equal protection of the law to secondary school\nstudents.\n\n   Individualized consideration of an applicant does not\nrequire an admissions program to be oblivious to race; the\nprogram may consider race, but in doing so, it must remain\n“flexible enough to consider all pertinent elements of diver-\nsity in light of the particular qualifications of each applicant,\nand to place them on the same footing for consideration,\n  18\n    See supra pp. 14670-71 n.12 (explaining why the talismanic use of\n“context” can not alter the fact of racial discrimination).\n\f14742      PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\nalthough not necessarily according them the same weight.” Id.\nat 334. There can be “no policy, either de jure or de facto, of\nautomatic acceptance or rejection based on any single ‘soft’\nvariable . . . [such as the awarding of] mechanical, predeter-\nmined diversity ‘bonuses’ based on race or ethnicity.” Id. at\n337.\n\n   Here, the racial tiebreaker works to admit or exclude high\nschool students from certain oversubscribed schools solely on\nthe basis of their skin color. No other consideration affects the\noperation of the racial tiebreaker; when it operates, it operates\nto admit or exclude either a white or nonwhite student,\ndepending upon how the admission will affect the preferred\nbalance at the oversubscribed school. Such a program is pre-\ncisely what Grutter warned against, and what Gratz held\nunconstitutional: a mechanical, predetermined policy “of\nautomatic acceptance or rejection based on a[ ] single ‘soft’\nvariable,” that being the student’s skin color. See id.\n\n   The racial tiebreaker’s overbroad classification of students\nas “white” or “nonwhite” also runs counter to the required\nindividualized consideration of each applicant. The District\ndoes not even consider the student’s actual race. Instead, the\nDistrict presumably places all Caucasian students into the\n“white” category, and then places all African-American,\nLatino, Asian-American, Pacific Islander and Native Ameri-\ncans into the “nonwhite” category. This puts aside the catego-\nrization of any individuals whose skin color does not correlate\ndirectly with the classifications. Although parents and stu-\ndents may identify their particular group on the registration\nmaterials, if they do not, the District will make the racial iden-\ntification itself through visual inspection of the parent or stu-\ndent. Thus, a fair-skinned minority may wind up in the\n“white” category, or a darker-skinned Caucasian may wind up\nin the “nonwhite” category.\n\n  Courts have often recognized that the inclusion of all\nminorities within a “nonwhite” classification suggests the\n\f           PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.        14743\noperation of a racial classification is not narrowly tailored.\nSee Wygant, 476 U.S. at 284 n.13 (noting the “definition of\nminority to include blacks, Orientals, American Indians, and\npersons of Spanish descent further illustrates the undifferenti-\nated nature of the plan”); Monterey Mech. Co., 125 F.3d at\n714 (noting the inclusion of all minority races within a broad\n“minority” category serves as a “red flag[ ] signaling that the\nstatute is not, as the Equal Protection Clause requires, nar-\nrowly tailored”). At the very least, a narrowly tailored pro-\ngram would require an individualized focus which would\nseparate the student according to his or her correct race, rather\nthan as a process of simple pigmental matching.\n\n   The majority concludes, however, that individualized con-\nsideration of each applicant is unnecessary because the Dis-\ntrict does not exclude any student from a public education by\noperation of the racial tiebreaker. The majority reasons that\nbecause all students are entitled to a public education in one\nof the District’s schools, there is no competition in the District\nfor admission to any of those schools, and thus no racial\nstigma could attach when a student is excluded from admis-\nsion to one of the schools on the basis of his race. Majority\nop. at 14685-87.\n\n   Yet the majority offers no explanation why, in the 2000-01\nschool year, 82% of the students selected one of the oversub-\nscribed schools (i.e., the schools subject to the racial tie-\nbreaker) as their first choice, while only 18% picked one of\nthe undersubscribed schools as their first choice. Majority op.\nat 14665-66. Clearly, the students’ and their parents’ “market”\nappraise some of the schools as providing a better education\nthan the others. Even the District’s superintendent confirmed\nthat the students’ parents considered some of the schools to be\nof higher quality. [ER 534.]\n\n   It is common sense that some public schools are better than\nothers. Parents often move into areas offering better school\ndistricts, and ubiquitous research guides compare the quality\n\f14744       PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\nof public schools according to standardized test scores, pro-\ngram offerings, and the sort. It may be that soothing, if self-\ninterested, bureaucratic voices sing a lullaby of equal educa-\ntional quality in the District’s schools. But the facts show that\nparents and children have voted with their feet in choosing\nsome schools rather than others. The verdict of that “market”\nmakes a hash out of such assurances by the District.\n\n   Thus, the District’s operation of the racial tiebreaker in\nreality does limit access to a governmental benefit among cer-\ntain students. The District insulates applicants belonging to\ncertain racial groups from competition for admission to those\nschools perceived to be of higher quality. A narrowly tailored\nrace-conscious admissions program “cannot insulate each cat-\negory of applicants with certain desired [racial] qualifications\nfrom competition with all other applicants.” Grutter, 539 U.S.\nat 334. The racial tiebreaker fails that test.\n\n  Yet the majority insist that because the District seeks to\navoid racially concentrated schools, “the District’s tiebreaker\nmust necessarily focus on the race of its students.” Majority\nop. at 14689. Again, the majority misses the crucial protection\nprovided by the Equal Protection Clause. The District’s\nnarrow-tailoring obligation does not prohibit it from consider-\ning race; it just cannot consider only race. The constitutional\nguarantee of equal protection requires the District to focus\nupon the individual’s whole make up, rather than just a\ngroup’s skin color; this protects each student’s right to equal\nprotection under the law. See Grutter, 539 U.S. at 326.\n\n   The counter-argument, of course, is that administrative\ninconveniences would prohibit the District from examining\neach student’s file for individual characteristics, of which race\nmay be a part. To the contrary, the record shows such an\neffort is certainly feasible.\n\n  First, thirteen- or fourteen-year-old students19 are not so\n  19\n    As noted, the District applies the racial tiebreaker only to entering\nninth-grade students (presumably around thirteen to fourteen years old).\n\f            PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.              14745\nyoung that they have not yet developed unique traits to set\nthemselves apart from other students and add greater diversity\nto the student body. The students’s race is a factor in assess-\ning the student as an individual, but the student may also\nspeak English as a second language, come from a different\nsocioeconomic stratum than other students, have overcome\nadversity, be a talented baseball player, musician, or have par-\nticipated in community service.\n\n   Second, as noted by the majority, in the 2000-01 school\nyear, approximately 3,000 students entered the District’s high\nschools as ninth graders. Ten percent of those students were\nsubject to the racial tiebreaker. Majority op. at 14667. Thus,\nunder an individualized approach, the District would have had\nto examine only three hundred applications to determine who\nto admit to the oversubscribed schools. Instead, the District\ngrouped those three hundred students into white and nonwhite\ncategories and allowed a computer to select their assignment\nbased solely upon their race.20\n\n   Thus, rather than providing an individualized consideration\nof applicants, the District is engaged in a “de jure [policy] of\nautomatic acceptance or rejection based on a[ ] single ‘soft’\nvariable.” See Grutter, 539 U.S. at 337. Such inflexibility\nshows the racial tiebreaker is not “narrowly tailored to any\ngoal, except perhaps outright racial balancing.” See Croson,\n488 U.S. at 507 (plurality).\n\n                                   B.\n\n  The second narrow-tailoring factor prohibits the use of quo-\n  20\n     Three hundred applications seem like only a minor administrative\nchallenge, but the Supreme Court’s admonition bears repeating nonethe-\nless: “[T]he fact that the implementation of a program capable of provid-\ning individualized consideration might present administrative challenges\ndoes not render constitutional an otherwise problematic system.” Grutter,\n539 U.S. at 275.\n\f14746       PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\ntas based upon race. Grutter, 539 U.S. at 334. A quota is\ndefined as “a program in which a certain fixed number or pro-\nportion of opportunities are reserved exclusively for certain\nminority groups. Quotas impose a fixed number or percentage\nwhich must be attained, or which cannot be exceeded.” Id. at\n335 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\n\n   Here, when a District school is oversubscribed and “inte-\ngration positive”—i.e., the white or nonwhite student body of\nthe school deviates by plus or minus 10% or 15% (depending\non the school year)21 of the preferred 40% white/60% non-\nwhite ratio—the District uses the racial tiebreaker to admit\nstudents whose presence will move the overall student body\ncloser to the preferred ratio. Using the 2000-2001 school year\nas an example, the District would employ the racial tiebreaker\nto exclude white students and admit nonwhite students where\nthe white student body population exceeded 50%. The District\nwould also employ the racial tiebreaker to exclude nonwhite\nstudents and admit white students where the nonwhite student\nbody population in a particular school exceeded 70%.\n\n   By its nature, the tiebreaker aims for a rigid, predetermined\nratio of white and nonwhite students, and thus operates to\nreach “a fixed number or percentage.” (emphasis supplied).\nGratz specifically rejected such a plan as not narrowly tai-\nlored. See 539 U.S. at 270 (“[T]he University’s policy, which\nautomatically distributes [20%] . . . of the points needed to\nguarantee admission, to every single ‘underrepresented\nminority’ applicant solely because of race, is not narrowly tai-\nlored . . . .”); id. at 271-72 (“The only consideration that\naccompanies this distribution of points is a factual review of\nan application to determine whether an individual is a mem-\nber of one of these minority groups.”).\n  21\n    In 2000-01, the District used a 10% deviation trigger, but increased\nthe trigger to 15% for the 2001-02 school year.\n\f             PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.                 14747\n   Yet the majority argues no quota exists here because the\nracial tiebreaker “does not set aside a fixed number of slots\nfor nonwhite or white students,” nor is the 10 or 15% variance\nalways satisfied (generally because there are insufficient num-\nbers of white or nonwhite students needed to balance the\nschool). Majority op. at 14692.22 With respect, the majority\nmisses the point. A quota does not become less of a quota\nbecause there are an insufficient number of whites or non-\nwhites to fill the preselected spots. The District created a\nquota when it established the predetermined, preferred ratio of\nwhite and nonwhite students. In Bakke, the medical school\nargued that it did not operate a quota in its admissions system\nbecause it did not always fill the preselected seats; thus, its\nadmissions system only had a “goal.” Justice Powell rejected\nthat argument, stating that regardless of whether the preselec-\nted seats were a “quota” or a “goal,” such a\n\n       semantic distinction is beside the point: The special\n       admissions program is undeniably a classification\n       based on race and ethnic background. To the extent\n       that there existed a pool of at least minimally quali-\n       fied minority applicants to fill the 16 special admis-\n       sions seats, white applicants could compete only for\n       84 seats in the entering class, rather than the 100\n       open to minority applicants. Whether this limitation\n       is described as a quota or a goal, it is a line drawn\n       on the basis of race and ethnic status.\n  22\n     Although the majority concludes a quota does not exist here, it also\nconcludes “the rationale underlying the . . . prohibition of quotas does not\napply” here. Majority op. at 14691 n.27. The majority reasons that because\nthere is no competition in assignment to the District’s schools, the dangers\npresented by a quota—i.e., insulating applicants from competition on the\nbasis of race—are absent here. Majority op. at 14691 n.27. But saying it\ndoes not make it so, whether it is said by the District or by the majority.\nAs explained above, there is clearly a “market” for higher quality schools\nin the District, and there is competition for the schools the parents and stu-\ndents view to be the better schools.\n\f14748      PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\nBakke, 438 U.S. at 289 (Powell, J.).\n\n   The majority makes a further attempt to avoid Grutter’s\nadmonition against quotas by attempting to classify the Dis-\ntrict’s predetermined ratio as a “critical mass.” The District’s\npreferred ratio could not be further from the definition of a\n“critical mass.” Grutter recognized that a “critical mass” had\nno quantified definition; instead, it was generally referred to\nas “meaningful numbers” or “meaningful representation” of\nminorities. 539 U.S. at 318. The Court expressly stated that a\n“critical mass” was not a means “simply to assure within its\nstudent body some specified percentage of a particular group\nmerely because of its race or ethnic origin.” Id. at 329 (inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted).\n\n   But unlike the unquantified “critical mass” from Grutter,\nthe District’s preferred ratio is firmly set at 40% white, 60%\nnonwhite. When the 15% deviation trigger is used with the\nracial tiebreaker, the District seeks to enroll between 75% and\n45% nonwhite students and 25% to 55% of white students.\nThe District’s admissions plan clearly seeks to assure a speci-\nfied percentage of white or nonwhite students in its schools;\nrather than seeking a “critical mass,” the District instead seeks\nracial balance. Thus, the District’s operation of the racial tie-\nbreaker fails this factor as well.\n\n                               C.\n\n  The third narrow-tailoring factor requires the District to\nhave engaged in a “serious, good-faith consideration of work-\nable race-neutral alternatives.” See id. at 339. The majority\nconcludes the District made such an effort. Majority op. at\n14698. For several reasons, I disagree.\n\n   First, the District’s superintendent flatly admitted the Dis-\ntrict did not engage in a serious, good-faith consideration of\nrace-neutral alternatives. When asked whether the District\n“g[a]ve any serious consideration to the adoption of a plan for\n\f             PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.                14749\nthe assignment of high school students that did not use racial\nbalancing as a factor or goal,” the District’s superintendent\nstated: “I think the general answer to that question is no . . .\nI don’t remember a significant body of work being done. I\nmean it’s possible informally ideas were floated here or there,\nbut I don’t remember any significant staff work being done.”\n[ER 521.]\n\n   The record supports this concession. The District never\nasked its demographer to conduct any analysis regarding the\neffect of using a race-neutral lottery. [ER 483.] The District\nalso never asked its demographer to conduct any analysis\nregarding a diversity program with non-racial indicia such as\na student’s eligibility for free lunch or the students’s socio-\neconomic background.23 [ER 481-82.]\n   23\n      The majority makes the conclusory statement that the District’s\n“white/nonwhite distinction is narrowly tailored to prioritize movement of\nstudents from the north of the city to the south of the city and vice versa”\nas an effort to combat Seattle’s racially imbalanced residential patterns.\nMajority op. at 14697-98. Yet the District’s attempt to balance students\nfrom north Seattle and south Seattle strongly suggests a less-restrictive,\nrace-neutral approach to achieve such balancing: socioeconomic balanc-\ning. As the majority notes, the northern Seattle area contains a majority of\n“white” students and is “historically more affluent.” Majority op. at\n14660. This would mean the southern Seattle area is less affluent. Thus,\nmoving more affluent students south, and less affluent students north,\ncould possibly provide a more diverse student body. At the very least, seri-\nous consideration would have been warranted into this race-neutral alter-\nnative. See Levine, supra, at 536 (noting the key element to successfully\nintegrating students of different backgrounds and race is not racial bal-\nance, but “economic integration”).\n  Yet the majority accepts the District’s rejection of the use of socioeco-\nnomic factors, reasoning that “[a]lthough there was no formal study of the\nproposal by District staff, Board members’ testimony revealed two legiti-\nmate reasons” for rejecting the socioeconomic alternative: (1) “it is insult-\ning to minorities and often inaccurate to assume that poverty correlates\nwith minority status;” and (2) students would be reluctant to reveal their\nsocioeconomic status to their peers. Majority op. at 14699-700. Such anal-\nysis seems far from the “serious, good-faith consideration of workable\n\f14750        PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\n   Also, in 2000, the Urban League of Metropolitan Seattle\npresented a high school assignment plan to the District. The\nplan proposed that each neighborhood region in Seattle would\nhave a designated high school. Students would still be able to\napply to any high school in Seattle, but when oversubscription\noccurred, students living in the designated “reference area”\nwould first be assigned to their regional high school ahead of\nthose who did not. To avoid racial concentration in the\nschools, the plan proposed “merit-based academic, avoca-\ntional and vocational magnet programs.” These programs\n“will help each school address racial diversity issues by\nencouraging students to travel outside of their communities to\nparticipate in a specific magnet program.”24\n\nrace-neutral alternatives” demanded by Grutter. See 539 U.S. at 339. First,\nwithout formal studies (or indeed any earnest consideration of the alterna-\ntives), we have no way of knowing whether the District actually seriously\nconsidered, and rejected for valid reasons, less-restrictive race-neutral\nalternatives. In Croson, the Court emphasized the importance of a satisfac-\ntory record to determine whether race-neutral alternatives were consid-\nered. See Croson, 488 U.S. at 498-511 (plurality) (detailing the\ngovernment actor’s failure to document the basis for its use of a racial\nquota and stressing the need to do so). Second, the majority’s insistence\nthat the District’s consideration of poverty would be “insulting” ignores\nthe demeaning—and indeed, constitutionally objectionable—effect of\nplacing persons into groups solely by their skin color for the purpose of\nreceiving or being denied a governmental benefit. See Loving v. Virginia,\n388 U.S. 1, 11 (1967) (“[T]his Court has consistently repudiated distinc-\ntions between citizens solely because of their ancestry as being odious to\na free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equali-\nty.”). Even if a sole focus on poverty might be insulting to some minori-\nties, socioeconomic considerations need not inquire only into poverty\nstatus; eligibility for free lunch, the parents’ levels of education, or\nwhether English is a second language for the child are also relevant deter-\nminations in evaluating diversity. Third, there is no reason students would\nhave to reveal their socioeconomic status to their peers; the District could,\nof course, keep such information confidential.\n   24\n      Similar race-neutral alternatives are common throughout the United\nStates. For example, the San Francisco, California public school district\nemploys a program focused on enhancing diversity in the classrooms. The\n\f             PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.                14751\n   Despite the majority’s assertion, the record suggests the\nDistrict did not seriously consider this plan. The District did\nnot ask its demographer to conduct any analysis as to the\neffect or workability of the plan [ER 504]; one District board\nmember stated the District “didn’t deal with” the plan [ER\n514]; another board member stated the District didn’t consider\nthe plan [ER 643]; and last, another board member stated he\nrefused to read the proposal because he would “rather play\nwith my bass lunker fishing game.” [ER 573.]\n\n   Of course, “[n]arrow tailoring does not require exhaustion\nof every conceivable race-neutral alternative,” Grutter, 539\nU.S. at 339, but it does require an earnest, good-faith consid-\neration of the alternatives. Here, the District made no such\nattempt, and thus the District’s use of the racial tiebreaker\nfails this narrow-tailoring factor.25\n\nprogram allows students to choose any school within the district. When a\nschool is oversubscribed, the program first assigns students with siblings\nto the same school, and then accommodates students with specialized\nlearning needs. After that, the “Diversity Index” handles further assign-\nments. “Under the Diversity Index process, the school district calculates\na numerical profile of all student applicants. The current Diversity Index\nis composed of six binary factors: socioeconomic status, academic\nachievement status, mother’s educational background, language status,\nacademic performance index, and home language.” David I. Levine, Pub-\nlic School Assignment Methods after Grutter and Gratz: The View from\nSan Francisco, 30 Hastings Const. L.Q. 511, 528-31 (2003). Notably, the\nSan Francisco system “does not use race as an express criterion for school\nassignments” and thus avoids the sharp focus of strict scrutiny. Id. at 531.\n   25\n      In assessing whether the District seriously considered race-neutral\nalternatives, the majority applies deference to the District’s consideration\n(or lack thereof) and rejection of the various alternatives. Majority op. at\n14698-99 n.33. With respect, the majority errs in two respects. First, as\npreviously noted, deference to local officials’ use of race is generally\nbarred in the application of strict scrutiny. See Johnson, 125 S. Ct. at 1146\nn.1. Second, if the majority is attempting to apply the deference invoked\nin Grutter, the Court there applied deference in determining whether the\nLaw School asserted a compelling governmental interest, not whether the\n\f14752        PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\n                                     D.\n\n   The fourth narrow-tailoring factor requires that the Dis-\ntrict’s use of the racial tiebreaker “must not unduly burden\nindividuals who are not members of the favored racial and\nethnic groups.” See Grutter, 539 U.S. at 341. The majority\nadjusts this test slightly to consider “any racial group,” rather\nthan just members of the disfavored group. Majority op. at\n14684. Because the racial tiebreaker disadvantages both white\nand nonwhite children, I agree that the modification is valid.\nBut unlike the majority, I conclude the District’s operation of\nthe racial tiebreaker fails this factor as well.\n\n   The racial tiebreaker unduly burdens thirteen- and fourteen-\nyear-old school children by (1) depriving them of their choice\nof school, and (2) imposing on them tedious cross-town com-\nmutes, solely upon the basis of their race.\n\n   First, as recognized above, the “good” schools in Seattle\nare a limited government benefit. Thus, the racial tiebreaker\nburdens white or nonwhite students, and often deprives them\nof the opportunity to enroll at what are considered the better\nschools, solely on the basis of race.\n\n  Second, the children of plaintiff members Jill Kurfurst and\nWinnie Bachwitz were denied admission to Ballard High\nSchool based on their race and instead were forced to attend\nIngraham, a school on the other side of Seattle from their\nhome. To attend that school, the two white students faced a\n\nmeans used to achieve that interest were narrowly tailored. See 539 U.S.\nat 328 (“The Law School’s educational judgment that such diversity is\nessential to its educational mission is one to which we defer.”).\n   The pattern now established by the majority seems suspicious. Out of\nfive narrow-tailoring factors, the majority has concluded two are inappli-\ncable, and now a third is entitled to deference. I find it difficult to under-\nstand how such analysis could truly be considered strict scrutiny as to the\nnarrowing requirement.\n\f          PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.       14753\ndaily multi-bus round-trip commute of over four hours. The\nparents instead enrolled their children in private schools.\nThose children were not only deprived of the school of their\nchoice, they were effectively denied a public education\n(surely at much lower cost than private tuition), based on\nnothing but their race.\n\n   A look at the operation of the tiebreaker provides further\nevidence of the injury the District inflicts on both white and\nnonwhite students. As noted by the majority, in the 2000-01\nschool year, 89 more white students were assigned to Franklin\nthan would have occurred absent the tiebreaker; 107 more\nnonwhite students were admitted to Ballard; 82 more non-\nwhite students were admitted to Roosevelt; and Twenty-seven\nmore nonwhite students were admitted to Nathan Hale.\nMajority op. at 14667. To place the racial tiebreaker into\nproper perspective, in the 2000-01 school year, 89 nonwhite,\nminority students were denied admission to Franklin, and had\nto attend what to them was a less desirable school, solely\nbecause of their skin color. One hundred-seven white students\nwere denied admission to Ballard, and had to attend what to\nthem was a less desirable school, solely because of their skin\ncolor. Eighty-two white students were denied admission to\nRoosevelt, and had to attend what to them was a less desirable\nschool, solely because of their skin color. Twenty-seven white\nstudents were denied admission to Nathan Hale, and had to\nattend what to them was a less desirable school, solely\nbecause of their skin color.\n\n   Yet the majority discounts the burdens imposed by the\nracial tiebreaker, concluding that (1) the “minimal burden” of\nthe tiebreaker is shared equally among white and nonwhite\nstudents; (2) no student is entitled to attend any specific\nschool in any event; and (3) the tiebreaker does not uniformly\nbenefit one race over the other because the tiebreaker operates\nagainst both whites and nonwhites. Majority op. at 14706-07.\nRegarding the first point, the U.S. Supreme Court has long\nrejected the notion that a racial classification which burdens\n\f14754      PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\nraces equally is any less objectionable under the Equal Protec-\ntion Clause. In Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1 (1967), the U.S.\nSupreme Court held a Virginia statute criminalizing interra-\ncial marriages was unconstitutional under the Equal Protec-\ntion Clause. Id. at 12. The Court rejected the state’s argument\nthat the miscegenation statute did not discriminate on the\nbasis of race because it “punish[ed] equally both the white\nand the Negro participants in an interracial marriage.” Id. at\n8. The Court reasoned: “In the case at bar . . . we deal with\nstatutes containing racial classifications, and the fact of equal\napplication does not immunize the statute from the very heavy\nburden of justification which the Fourteenth Amendment has\ntraditionally required of state statutes drawn according to\nrace.” Id. at 9. Hence, it is irrelevant whether the racial tie-\nbreaker disadvantages both races equally.\n\n   Second, I think I have already disposed of the majority’s\nargument that no student is entitled to attend any specific Dis-\ntrict school. The students and parents clearly value some of\nthe District’s schools above the others, and limiting access to\nthose higher quality schools on the basis of race is just the\nsame as any other preferential racial classification.\n\n   Third, I agree the tiebreaker does not uniformly benefit one\nrace over the other and can exclude both white and nonwhite\nstudents from the preferred schools. Yet that does not lessen\nthe injury of being subject to a racial classification. Equal pro-\ntection is an individual right, and whenever the District tells\none student, whether white or nonwhite, he or she cannot\nattend a particular school on the basis of race, that action\nworks an injury of constitutional proportion. See Adarand,\n515 U.S. at 230 (“[A]ny individual suffers an injury when he\nor she is disadvantaged by the government because of his or\nher race, whatever that race may be.”); Monterey Mech. Co.,\n125 F.3d at 712 (“Race discrimination is never a ‘trifle.’ ”).\n\n   The District’s use of the racial tiebreaker thus unduly bur-\ndens members of the disfavored class, and the tiebreaker fails\nthis narrow-tailoring factor as well.\n\f           PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.        14755\n                               E.\n\n   The fifth and final narrow-tailoring factor requires the Dis-\ntrict’s use of the racial tiebreaker to “be limited in time,” and\n“have a logical end point.” See Grutter, 539 U.S. at 342. A\nworkable “sunset” provision within any government-operated\nracial classification is vital:\n\n    [A] core purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment was\n    to do away with all governmentally imposed dis-\n    crimination based on race. . . . The requirement that\n    all race-conscious admissions programs have a ter-\n    mination point assures all citizens that the deviation\n    from the norm of equal treatment of all racial and\n    ethnic groups is a temporary matter, a measure taken\n    in the service of the goal of equality itself.\n\nId. at 341-42 (internal quotation marks and alterations omit-\nted).\n\n   Citing Grutter, the majority contends the racial tiebreaker\nsatisfies this factor because “this durational requirement can\nbe met by periodic reviews to determine whether racial pref-\nerences are still necessary to achieve student body diversity,”\nand the District engages in such periodic reviews. Majority\nop. at 14706. Yet citing Grutter in full shows that “the dura-\ntional requirement can be met by sunset provisions in race-\nconscious admissions policies and periodic reviews to deter-\nmine whether racial preferences are still necessary to achieve\nstudent body diversity.” 539 U.S. at 342 (emphasis added).\nPeriodic reviews are not enough; there must be some “dura-\ntional requirement,” some “logical end point,” to the racial\nclassifications.\n\n   The District argued the end point is in the “thermostat” to\nthe tiebreaker, in which the District ceases to use the racial\ntiebreaker at any school for the year once its use had brought\nthe school into racial balance. Yet it is undisputed that the\n\f14756       PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\nDistrict has never been segregated by law; the racial imbal-\nance in its schools results from Seattle’s racially imbalanced\nhousing patterns. If Seattle’s children were simply assigned to\nthe high schools nearest their homes, those schools suppos-\nedly would tend to reflect such imbalance.\n\n   Because there is no reason—much less evidence—to con-\nclude Seattle’s housing patterns will change, or that the Dis-\ntrict’s student assignment program will affect such patterns, I\nmust respectfully disagree that such a provision satisfies the\n“sunset provision” requirement enunciated in Grutter. Pre-\nsumably, where the District employs the racial tiebreaker, the\nschools will become racially balanced, that is 40% white,\n60% nonwhite (plus or minus a few percentage points,\ndepending on the particular percentage deviation triggering\nthe tiebreaker that year). Pursuant to the “thermostat,” the\nDistrict would then stop using the racial tiebreaker. But\nbecause Seattle’s residential makeup is racially imbalanced26\n(and remains so despite the use of the racial tiebreaker),\nassignment to the oversubscribed schools would then occur\nonly with use of (1) the sibling tiebreaker; and (2) the distance\ntiebreaker. Assuming that not every student also has a sibling\nattending one of the District’s schools, the schools will inevi-\ntably become racially imbalanced again because of the\nracially imbalanced residential makeup, thus rendering the\nthermostat useless as a “sunset provision.”\n\n   One could argue, then, that this result supports the need for\nuse of the racial tiebreaker. Not necessarily so. If the racial\nimbalance in the schools is caused not by the students, but by\nthe choices of the parents as to where to live, then why not\nput the onus of remedying that imbalance on the parents\nrather than the students? Seattle’s city council could create\n  26\n    About 70% of the residents of Seattle, Washington are white, and 30%\nof the residents are nonwhite. Sixty-six percent of white students live in\nthe northern part of Seattle, while 75% of nonwhite students live in the\nsouthern part of Seattle.\n\f          PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.       14757\n“incentives” for whites to move into nonwhite areas, and for\nnonwhites to move into white areas. And if incentives do not\naccomplish the task, well, why not use compulsion, as the\nDistrict does to high school children? The city council could\ntake measures to prevent new persons taking up residence in\nSeattle from living in areas where their presence might other-\nwise alter the sought-after racial balance. This would protect\nthe racial balance within the schools and squarely put the bur-\nden of remedying the racial imbalance upon the parents,\nrather than the students.\n\n   Of course, less political resistance can be expected from\nchoosing students for social engineering experiments in racial\nbalancing, than in telling everyone—including voters—into\nwhich neighborhood they can move. Further, regulation of\nresidence by race might run afoul of Shelley v. Kraemer, 334\nU.S. 1 (1948), although it is difficult to distinguish why the\n“compelling interest” of socialization among the races could\nnot as easily be pressed in housing regulation as it is in\nschooling regulation.\n\n  The simple truth is that some people choose to live near\nmembers of their own ethnic or racial group.\n\n    There is no denying that American blacks often live\n    in their own residential enclaves, especially in our\n    big cities. But the same is true of whites and of every\n    other racial and ethnic group—Jews, Chinese, Cam-\n    bodians, Cubans, Arabs. Such racial and ethnic clus-\n    tering means that a third of non-Asian minorities\n    attend schools that are less than 10-percent white.\n    And even though whites constitute just over 60 per-\n    cent of the nation’s schoolchildren, the average\n    white student goes to a school that is 80-percent\n    white.\n\n       But why should we expect identical proportions of\n    blacks and whites to live in each and every neighbor-\n\f14758        PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\n       hood? People like to live near others with whom\n       they identify, and the schools mirror their choices.\n       When asked about their residential preferences, only\n       about 5 percent of blacks said they wished to live on\n       an entirely or almost entirely white block. The vast\n       majority preferred neighborhoods that were half or\n       more than half African-American—in other words,\n       neighborhoods in which the black concentration was\n       “disproportionately” high. According to the 2000\n       census, this happens to correspond closely to the\n       actual distribution of black city-dwellers.\n\n          In a complex, heterogenous society, it is only nat-\n       ural that people should sort themselves out in urban\n       space along lines of race as well as of religion and\n       social class. This pattern was firmly established in\n       the U.S. by the European immigrants who landed in\n       the cities of the North in the 19th and early 20th cen-\n       turies. The sociologists who studied these settle-\n       ments recognized the important social functions\n       served by “Little Italies” and “Poletowns.\n\nAbigail Thernstrom27 & Stephan Thernstrom, Have We Over-\ncome?, Commentary, Nov. 2004, at 51-52.28\n\n   Of course, the continuing racial imbalance in some residen-\ntial areas is in significant part a byproduct of past efforts to\n  27\n      Mrs. Thernstrom is presently the Vice Chair of the U.S. Commission\non Civil Rights.\n   28\n      Further evidence that such self-selection results is submitted by this\nyear’s Nobel Laureate, Thomas C. Schelling, by application of game the-\nory in chapter four of his book Micromotives and Macrobehavior (1978).\nSchelling employs an exercise using coins to demonstrate how an inte-\ngrated neighborhood can become largely segregated as long as each resi-\ndent desires at least one third of his or her neighbors to be of his or her\nrace. When one person moves to get a preferred set of neighbors, it causes\na chain reaction which settles down only when the neighborhood is effec-\ntively segregated.\n\f          PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.      14759\nexclude minority groups from predominately white areas. Yet\nas racial tolerance and enforcement of civil rights laws have\nincreased, neighborhoods are becoming more racially bal-\nanced. Id. In 1960, 15% of African-Americans lived in sub-\nurbs. In 2004, 36% live in suburbs. Id. African-Americans\naccount for 9% of the total suburban population, “surprisingly\nclose to proportionality for a group that constitutes only 12\npercent of the American population.” Id. Moreover, from\n1960 to 2000, the proportions of African-Americans living in\ncensus tracts that were over 80% black fell from 47% to under\n30%. Id. During that same period, the proportion residing in\ncensus tracts that were over 50% black fell from 70% to 50%.\nId. Most importantly, this balancing takes place without any\ngovernment coercion, except perhaps by the enforcement of\nfair housing laws which prevent racial discrimination such as\nCalifornia’s Unruh Civil Rights Act, Cal. Civ. Code § 51\n(West 2001).\n\n    No one who understands what makes America great\n    can quarrel with ethnic pride. At home, on the week-\n    end, in the family and the neighborhood, Jews will\n    be Jews, Italians Italian - and there is no reason\n    blacks should be any different. Religion and ethnic-\n    ity are essential parts of our lives, and government\n    should not curtail how we express them in the pri-\n    vate sphere. But when it comes to public life, even\n    the benevolent color coding of recent decades has\n    proved a recipe for alienation and resentment. Soci-\n    ety need not be color-blind or color-less, but the law\n    cannot work unless it is color-neutral, and the gov-\n    ernment should not be in the business of abetting or\n    paying for the cultivation of group identity.\n\nSchuck, supra, at 88 (quoting Tamar Jacoby, Someone Else’s\nHouse: America’s Unfinished Struggle for Integration 541\n(1998)) (internal alteration omitted).\n\n  The racial imbalance in Seattle’s schools results not from\nde jure segregation nor from any invidious exclusion of non-\n\f14760        PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\nwhite minorities from the schools. Instead, it results from\nracially imbalanced residential housing patterns, an issue\nwhich the District does not even contend it can alter. Hence,\nthe method chosen by the District to impose racially balanced\nschools is fatally flawed. Because it does not respond to the\nracial imbalances in Seattle’s residential makeup, and instead\nonly attempts to fix it within the schools, there will be no sun-\nset to the use of the racial tiebreaker. See Grutter, 539 U.S.\nat 343 (“It would be a sad day indeed were America to\nbecome a quota-ridden society, with each identifiable minor-\nity assigned proportional representation in every desirable\nwalk of life. But that is not the rationale for programs of pref-\nerential treatment; the acid test of their justification will be\ntheir efficacy in eliminating the need for any racial or ethnic\npreferences at all.”). Thus, the District’s operation of the\nracial tiebreaker fails this factor as well.\n\n                                    V.\n\n  As pointed out in the majority opinion, other courts have\nconcluded that a school district’s use of a racial tiebreaker in\nsearch of racial balance in the student body passes muster\nunder the Equal Protection Clause.29 I respectfully disagree.\nThe District’s use of the racial tiebreaker to achieve racial bal-\nance in its high schools infringes upon each student’s right to\n   29\n      Cf.

We are not different because of our\nskin color; we are different because each one of us is unique.\nThat uniqueness incorporates our opinions, our background,\nour religion (or lack thereof), our thought, and our color.\nGrutter attempted to strike a balance between the individual\nprotections of equal protection and being conscious of race\neven when looking at the individual. The District’s use of the\nracial tiebreaker, however, attempts no such balance; it\ninstead classifies each ninth-grade student solely by race.\nBecause of that, I must conclude such a program violates the\nEqual Protection Clause.\n\n   The majority’s decision risks unfortunate repercussions. On\nthe short-term, the specter of “white flight” (a recurring issue\nin the aftermath of the elimination of de jure desegregation)\nmanifests itself here. The racial balancing of students will\nrequire busing and long-distance transportation to schools\noutside of some students’ neighborhoods. Parental involve-\nment in those distant schools (such as with the PTA) will\nundoubtedly decrease. Parents who can afford private educa-\ntion (such as those in the more affluent northern part of Seat-\ntle) may very well choose to pull their children from the\nDistrict schools and enroll them elsewhere, much like the\nKurfurst and Bachwitz children. On the long-term, such an\nexodus could result in a decreased tax base and public support\nfor the District schools and may result in the exact opposite\nthe District hopes to achieve—a loss of white students from\ntheir school campuses.\n\n   One of the greatest stains upon the history of our country\nis our struggle with race discrimination. Perhaps that stain\nwould not be so deep had we chosen a different approach to\nour equal protection jurisprudence, an approach often-quoted:\n\n    Our Constitution is color-blind, and neither knows\n    nor tolerates classes among citizens. In respect of\n    civil rights, all citizens are equal before the law. The\n\f14762      PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\n    humblest is the peer of the most powerful. The law\n    regards man as man, and takes no account of his sur-\n    roundings or of his color when his civil rights as\n    guaranteed by the supreme law of the land are\n    involved.\n\nPlessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537, 559 (1896) (Harlan, J., dis-\nsenting).\n\n  Or, as more recently said by the late Justice Stanley Mosk\nof the California Supreme Court:\n\n    Racism will never disappear by employing devices\n    of classifying people and of thus measuring their\n    rights. Rather, wrote Professor Van Alstyne, ‘one\n    gets beyond racism by getting beyond it now: by a\n    complete, resolute, and credible commitment [n]ever\n    to tolerate in one’s own life or in the life or practices\n    of one’s government the differential treatment of\n    other human beings by race. Indeed, that is the great\n    lesson for government itself to teach: in all we do in\n    life, whatever we do in life, to treat any person less\n    well than another or to favor any more than another\n    for being black or white or brown or red, is wrong.\n    Let that be our fundamental law and we shall have\n    a Constitution universally worth expounding.’\n\nPrice v.

Background2\n\n  A. Seattle Public Schools: A Historical Perspective\n\n   Seattle’s historical struggle with the problem of racial isola-\ntion in its public school system provides the context for the\nDistrict’s implementation of the current challenged assign-\nment plan. Seattle is a diverse community. Approximately 70\npercent of its residents are white, and 30 percent are non-\nwhite. Seattle public school enrollment breaks down nearly\ninversely, with approximately 40 percent white and 60 per-\ncent nonwhite students. A majority of the District’s white stu-\ndents live in neighborhoods north of downtown, the\nhistorically more affluent part of the city. A majority of the\ncity’s nonwhite students, including approximately 84 percent\nof all African-American students, 74 percent of all Asian-\nAmerican students, 65 percent of all Latino students and 51\n   1\n     The terms “racial diversity,” “racial concentration” and “racial isola-\ntion” have been used by the District to encompass racial and ethnic diver-\nsity, concentration and isolation. For the purposes of this opinion, we\nadopt this shorthand.\n   2\n     We draw the following restatement of facts largely from the district\ncourt opinion, see Parents Involved in Cmty. Schs. v.

SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.                14661\npercent of all Native-American students, live south of down-\ntown.\n\n   The District operates 10 four-year public high schools.\nFour are located north of downtown — Ballard, Ingraham,\nNathan Hale and Roosevelt; five are located south of down-\ntown — Chief Sealth, Cleveland, Franklin, Garfield and Rai-\nnier Beach; one is located west of downtown — West Seattle.\nFor over 40 years, the District has made efforts to attain and\nmaintain desegregated schools and avoid the racial isolation\nor concentration that would ensue if school assignments repli-\ncated Seattle’s segregated housing patterns. Since the 1960s,\nwhile courts around the country ordered intransigent school\ndistricts to desegregate, Seattle’s School Board voluntarily\nexplored measures designed to end de facto segregation in the\nschools and provide all of the District’s students with access\nto diverse and equal educational opportunities.\n\n  In the late 1950s and early 1960s, school assignments were\nmade strictly on the basis of neighborhood.3 In 1962, Garfield\nHigh School reported 64 percent minority enrollment and it\naccommodated 75 percent of all African-American students.\nMeanwhile, the eight high schools serving other major areas\nof the city remained more than 95 percent white.\n\n   The District responded to this imbalance, and racial ten-\nsions in the de facto segregated schools, in various ways. In\nthe early 1960s, the District first experimented with small-\nscale exchange programs in which handfuls of students\nswitched high schools for five-week periods. In 1963, expand-\ning on this concept, the District implemented a “Voluntary\n  3\n    The history that follows comes principally from two documents in the\ndistrict court record. One is a report entitled, “The History of Desegrega-\ntion in Seattle Public Schools, 1954-1981,” which was prepared by the\nDistrict’s desegregation planners. The other is the “Findings and Conclu-\nsions” adopted by the Board in support of the current assignment plan.\n(They are cited as History of Desegregation and Findings and Conclu-\nsions, respectively.)\n\f14662      PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\nRacial Transfer” program through which a student could\ntransfer to any school with available space if the transfer\nwould improve the racial balance at the receiving school. In\nthe 1970s, the District increased its efforts again, this time\nadopting a desegregation plan in the middle schools that\nrequested volunteers to transfer between minority- and\nmajority-dominated neighborhood schools and called for\nmandatory transfers when the number of volunteers was\ninsufficient, though this portion of the plan was never imple-\nmented. The District also took steps to desegregate Garfield\nHigh School by changing its educational program, improving\nits facilities and eliminating “special transfers” that had previ-\nously allowed white students to leave Garfield. Finally, for\nthe 1977-78 school year, the District instituted a magnet-\nschool program. According to the District’s history:\n      While it appeared evident that the addition of magnet\n      programs would not in itself desegregate the Seattle\n      schools, there was supportive evidence that volun-\n      tary strategies, magnet and non-magnet, could be\n      significant components of a more comprehensive\n      desegregation plan.\nHistory of Desegregation at 32.\n   By the 1977-78 school year, segregation had increased:\nFranklin was 78 percent minority, Rainier Beach 58 percent,\nCleveland 76 percent and Garfield 65 percent. Other high\nschools ranged from 9 percent to 23 percent minority enroll-\nment.\n   In the spring of 1977, the Seattle branch of the National\nAssociation for the Advancement of Colored People\n(“NAACP”) filed a complaint with the United States Depart-\nment of Education’s Office of Civil Rights, alleging that Seat-\ntle’s School Board had acted to further racial segregation in\nthe city’s schools. Several other organizations, principally the\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union (“ACLU”), formally threat-\nened to file additional actions if the District failed to adopt a\nmandatory desegregation plan. When the District agreed to\n\f            PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.              14663\ndevelop such a plan, the Office of Civil Rights concomitantly\nagreed to delay its investigation, and the ACLU agreed to\ndelay filing a lawsuit.\n   During the summer of 1977, the District and community\nrepresentatives reviewed five model plans. Ultimately, the\nDistrict incorporated elements of each model into its final\ndesegregation plan, adopted in December 1977 and known as\nthe “Seattle Plan.” The Seattle Plan divided the district into\nzones, within which majority-dominated elementary schools\nwere paired with minority-dominated elementary schools to\nachieve desegregation. Mandatory high school assignments\nwere linked to elementary school assignments, although vari-\nous voluntary transfer options were available. With the Seattle\nPlan,\n      Seattle became the first major city to adopt a com-\n      prehensive desegregation program voluntarily with-\n      out a court order. By doing so the District\n      maintained local control over its desegregation plan\n      and was able to adopt and implement a plan which\n      in the eyes of the District best met the needs of Seat-\n      tle students and the Seattle School District.\nHistory of Desegregation at 36-37. Opponents of the Seattle\nPlan immediately passed a state initiative to block its imple-\nmentation, but the Supreme Court ultimately declared the ini-\ntiative unconstitutional. Washington v.

Because of Seattle’s housing patterns, the\nDistrict’s planners explained that “it was impossible to fash-\nion clusters in a geographically contiguous manner”; some\ncluster schools were near students’ homes, but others were in\n“racially and culturally different neighborhoods.” Findings\nand Conclusions at 30-31. Although roughly 70 percent of\nstudents received their first choices, the controlled choice plan\nstill resulted in mandatory busing for 16 percent of the Dis-\ntrict’s students.\n   In 1994, the Board directed District staff to devise a new\nplan for all grade levels to simplify assignments, reduce costs\nand increase community satisfaction, among other things. The\nguiding factors were to be choice, diversity and predictability.\nStaff developed four basic options, including the then-existing\ncontrolled choice plan, a regional choice plan, a neighborhood\nassignment plan with a provision for voluntary, integration-\npositive transfers and an open choice plan.\n   Board members testified that they considered all the\noptions as they related to the District’s educational goals —\nwith special emphasis, at the secondary school level, on the\ngoals of choice and racial diversity. Neighborhood and\nregional plans were viewed as unduly limiting student choice,\non which the District placed high value because student\nchoice was seen to increase parental involvement in the\nschools and promote improvements in quality through a mar-\nketplace model. The District sought to maintain its commit-\nment to racially integrated education by establishing diversity\ngoals while moving away from the rigid desegregation guide-\nlines and mandatory assignments prevalent in the 1970s and\n1980s.\n   The Board adopted the current open choice plan (the\n“Plan”) for the 1998-99 school year. Under the Plan, students\nentering the ninth grade may select any high school in the\nDistrict. They are assigned, where possible, to the school they\nlist as their first choice. If too many students choose the same\n\f             PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.                14665\nschool as their first choice, resulting in “oversubscription,”\nthe District assigns students to each oversubscribed school\nbased on a series of tiebreakers. If a student is not admitted\nto his or her first choice school as a result of the tiebreakers,\nthe District tries to assign the student to his or her second\nchoice school, and so on. Students not assigned to one of their\nchosen schools are assigned to the closest school with space\navailable; students who list more choices are less likely to\nreceive one of these “mandatory” assignments. The most\nrecent version of the Plan, which the School Board reviews\nannually, is for the 2001-02 school year and is the subject of\nthis litigation.\n   B. The Plan\n   The District has sought to make each of its 10 high schools\nunique, with programs that respond to the continually chang-\ning needs of students and their parents. Indeed, the District\nimplemented the Plan as part of a comprehensive effort to\nimprove and equalize the attractiveness of all the high\nschools, including adoption of a weighted funding formula, a\nfacilities plan and a new teacher contract that would make\nteacher transfers easier. Nevertheless, the high schools vary\nwidely in desirability. Three of the northern schools — Bal-\nlard, Nathan Hale and Roosevelt — and two of the southern\nschools — Garfield and Franklin — are highly desirable and\noversubscribed, meaning that more students wish to attend\nthose schools than capacity allows.5 The magnitude of the\n  5\n   The current popularity of Ballard High School is illustrative of the con-\nstantly changing dynamic of Seattle’s public high schools. In the fall of\n1999, Ballard moved to a new facility under the leadership of a new prin-\ncipal. Prior to the move, Ballard was not oversubscribed; now it is one of\nthe most popular high schools in Seattle.\n   Similarly, the popularity and demographics of Nathan Hale High School\nchanged significantly when it acquired a new principal who instituted a\nnumber of academic innovations, including joining the “Coalition of\nEssential Schools” and instituting a “Ninth Grade Academy” and “Tenth\nGrade Integrated Studies Program.” Prior to 1998, Nathan Hale, a north\narea high school, was not oversubscribed, and the student body was pre-\ndominantly nonwhite. Starting in 1998, the high school began to have a\nwaitlist, and more white students, who had previously passed on Nathan\nHale, wanted to go there. As a result, the number of nonwhite students\ndeclined dramatically between 1995 and 2000.\n\f14666       PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\noversubscription is noteworthy: For the academic year 2000-\n01, approximately 82 percent of students selected one of the\noversubscribed schools as their first choice, while only about\n18 percent picked one of the undersubscribed high schools as\ntheir first choice. Only when oversubscription occurs does the\nDistrict become involved in the assignment process.\n   If a high school is oversubscribed, all students applying for\nninth grade are admitted according to a series of four tie-\nbreakers, applied in the following order: First, students who\nhave a sibling attending that school are admitted. In any given\noversubscribed school, the sibling tiebreaker accounts for\nsomewhere between 15 to 20 percent of the admissions to the\nninth grade class.\n   Second, if an oversubscribed high school is racially imbal-\nanced — meaning that the racial make up of its student body\ndiffers by more than 15 percent from the racial make up of the\nstudents of the Seattle public schools as a whole — and if the\nsibling preference does not bring the oversubscribed high\nschool within plus or minus 15 percent of the District’s demo-\ngraphics, the race-based tiebreaker is “triggered” and the race\nof the applying student is considered. (For the purposes of the\nrace-based tiebreaker, a student is deemed to be of the race\nspecified in his or her registration materials.) Thus, if a school\nhas more than 75 percent nonwhite students (i.e., more than\n15 percent above the overall 60 percent nonwhite student pop-\nulation) and less than 25 percent white students, or when it\nhas less than 45 percent nonwhite students (i.e., more than 15\npercent below the overall 60 percent nonwhite student popula-\ntion) and more than 55 percent white students, the school is\nconsidered racially imbalanced.\n   Originally, schools that deviated by more than 10 percent\nwere deemed racially imbalanced. For the 2001-02 school\nyear, however, the triggering number was increased to 15 per-\ncent, softening the effect of the tiebreaker.6 For that year, the\n  6\n   Although the record reflects the general effects of the tiebreaker in\n2001-02, it does not include the specific number of students affected by\n\f            PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.              14667\nrace-based tiebreaker was used in assigning entering ninth\ngrade students only to three oversubscribed schools — Bal-\nlard, Franklin and Nathan Hale. Accordingly, in seven of the\n10 public high schools in 2001-02, race was not relevant in\nmaking admissions decisions.\n   The race-based tiebreaker is applied to both white and non-\nwhite students. For example, in the 2000-01 school year —\nwhen the trigger point was still plus or minus 10 percent —\n89 more white students were assigned to Franklin than would\nhave been assigned absent the tiebreaker, 107 more nonwhite\nstudents were assigned to Ballard than would have been\nassigned absent the tiebreaker, 82 more nonwhite students\nwere assigned to Roosevelt than would have been assigned\nabsent the tiebreaker and 27 more nonwhite students were\nassigned to Nathan Hale than would have been assigned\nabsent the tiebreaker.7 These assignments accounted for about\n10 percent of admissions to Seattle’s high schools as a whole.\nThat is, of the approximately 3,000 incoming students enter-\ning Seattle high schools in the 2000-01 school year, approxi-\nmately 300 were assigned to an oversubscribed high school\nbased on the race-based tiebreaker.\n\n   In addition to changing the trigger point for the 2001-02\nschool year to plus or minus 15 percent, the District also\ndeveloped a “thermostat,” whereby the tiebreaker is applied to\nthe entering ninth grade student population only until it comes\nwithin the 15 percent plus or minus variance. Once that point\n\nthe tiebreaker in the three oversubscribed schools where the tiebreaker\napplied. The record, however, does include these numbers for the 2000-01\nschool year. Although the tiebreaker operated differently in 2000-01, and\napplied to four schools rather than three, the 2000-01 numbers illustrate\nthe general operation of the tiebreaker.\n   7\n     The Board’s decision to change the trigger point for use of the tie-\nbreaker from plus or minus 10 percent to plus or minus 15 percent, how-\never, had the effect of rendering Roosevelt High School neutral for\ndesegregation purposes. Thus, the tiebreaker did not factor into assign-\nments to Roosevelt High School in the 2001-02 school year.\n\f14668      PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\nis reached, the District “turns-off” the race-based tiebreaker,\nand there is no further consideration of a student’s race in the\nassignment process. The tiebreaker does not apply, and race\nis not considered, for students entering a high school after the\nninth grade (e.g., by transfer).\n\n   As demonstrated in the chart below, the District estimates\nthat without the race-based tiebreaker, the nonwhite popula-\ntions of the 2000-01 ninth grade class at Franklin would have\nbeen 79.2 percent, at Hale 30.5 percent, at Ballard 33 percent\nand at Roosevelt 41.1 percent. Using the race-based tie-\nbreaker, the actual nonwhite populations of the ninth grade\nclasses at the same schools respectively were 59.5 percent,\n40.6 percent, 54.2 percent and 55.3 percent.\n\n          2000-01 DIFFERENCE IN PERCENTAGES OF\n           NONWHITE STUDENTS IN NINTH GRADE\n             WITH AND WITHOUT TIEBREAKER\n\n\n\n    SCHOOL         WITHOUT           WITH           PERCENT\n                  TIEBREAKER      TIEBREAKER       Difference\n\n    FRANKLIN          79.2            59.5            −19.7\n\n NATHAN HALE          30.5            40.6            +10.1\n\n    BALLARD           33.0            54.2            +21.2\n\n   ROOSEVELT          41.1            55.3            +14.2\n\n\n   In the third tiebreaker, students are admitted according to\ndistance from the student’s home to the high school. Distance\nbetween home and school is calculated within 1/100 of a mile,\nwith the closest students being admitted first. In any given\noversubscribed school, the distance-based tiebreaker accounts\nfor between 70 to 75 percent of admissions to the ninth grade.\n\n  In the fourth tiebreaker, a lottery is used to allocate the\nremaining seats. Because the distance tiebreaker serves to\n\f             PARENTS INVOLVED v.

Procedural History\n\n   Parents Involved in Community Schools (“Parents”), a\ngroup of parents whose children were not, or might not be,\nassigned to the high schools of their choice under the Plan,\nclaimed that the District’s use of the race-based tiebreaker for\nhigh school admissions is illegal under the Washington Civil\nRights Act (“Initiative 200”),8 the Equal Protection Clause of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment9 and Title VI of the Civil Rights\nAct of 1964.10\n\n   Both Parents and the District moved for summary judgment\non all claims.

The compelling\ninterest that the Court recognized in Grutter was the promo-\ntion of the specific educational and societal benefits that flow\nfrom diversity. See Grutter, 539 U.S. at 330 (noting that the\nlaw school’s concept of critical mass must be “defined by ref-\n\f             PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.                   14673\nerence to the educational benefits that diversity is designed to\nproduce”). In evaluating the relevance of diversity to higher\neducation, the Court focused principally on two benefits that\na diverse student body provides: (1) the learning advantages\nof having diverse viewpoints represented in the “robust\nexchange of ideas” that is critical to the mission of higher\neducation, id. at 329-30; and (2) the greater societal legiti-\nmacy that institutions of higher learning enjoy by cultivating\na group of national leaders who are representative of our\ncountry’s diversity, id. at 332-33. The Court also mentioned\nthe role of diversity in challenging stereotypes. Id. at 330,\n333. The Court largely deferred to the law school’s educa-\ntional judgment not only in determining that diversity would\nproduce these benefits, but also in determining that these ben-\nefits were critical to the school’s educational mission. Id. at\n328-33.13\n\n   Against this background, we consider the specific interests\nthat the District’s Plan seeks to advance. These interests are\narticulated in the “Board Statement Reaffirming Diversity\nRationale” as:\n\n     Diversity in the classroom increases the likelihood\n     that students will discuss racial or ethnic issues and\n     be more likely to socialize with people of different\n   13\n      The Court also heeded the judgment of amici curiae — including edu-\ncators, business leaders and the military — that the educational benefits\nthat flow from diversity constitute a compelling interest. Grutter, 539 U.S.\nat 330 (“The Law School’s claim of a compelling interest is further bol-\nstered by its amici, who point to the educational benefits that flow from\nstudent body diversity.”); see also id. (“These benefits are not theoretical\nbut real, as major American businesses have made clear that the skills\nneeded in today’s increasingly global marketplace can only be developed\nthrough exposure to widely diverse people, cultures, ideas, and view-\npoints.”); id. at 331 (“[H]igh-ranking retired officers and civilian leaders\nof the United States military assert that, ‘[b]ased on [their] decades of\nexperience,’ a ‘highly qualified, racially diverse officer corps . . . is essen-\ntial to the military’s ability to fulfill its principle mission to provide\nnational security.’ ”).\n\f14674      PARENTS INVOLVED v.

Diversity is thus a valuable resource for teach-\n    ing students to become citizens in a multi-racial/\n    multi-ethnic world.\n\n    Providing students the opportunity to attend schools\n    with diverse student enrollment also has inherent\n    educational value from the standpoint of education’s\n    role in a democratic society . . . . Diversity brings\n    different viewpoints and experiences to classroom\n    discussions and thereby enhances the educational\n    process. It also fosters racial and cultural understand-\n    ing, which is particularly important in a racially and\n    culturally diverse society such as ours.\n\n    The District’s commitment to the diversity of its\n    schools and to the ability to voluntarily avoid\n    racially concentrating enrollment patterns also helps\n    ensure that all students have access to those schools,\n    faculties, course offerings, and resources that will\n    enable them to reach their full potential.\n\n    Based on the foregoing rationale, the Seattle School\n    District’s commitment is that no student should be\n    required to attend a racially concentrated school. The\n    District is also committed to providing students with\n    the opportunity to voluntarily choose to attend a\n    school to promote integration. The District provides\n    these opportunities for students to attend a racially\n    and ethnically diverse school, and to assist in the\n    voluntary integration of a school, because it believes\n    that providing a diverse learning environment is edu-\n    cationally beneficial for all students.\n\n   The District’s interests fit into two broad categories: (1) the\nDistrict seeks the affirmative educational and social benefits\nthat flow from racial diversity; and (2) the District seeks to\navoid the harms resulting from racially concentrated or iso-\nlated schools.\n\f             PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.                14675\n  1. Educational and Social Benefits that Flow from\n  Diversity\n\n   [3] The District has established that racial diversity pro-\nduces a number of compelling educational and social benefits\nin secondary education. First, the District presented expert\ntestimony that in racially diverse schools, “both white and\nminority students experienced improved critical thinking\nskills — the ability to both understand and challenge views\nwhich are different from their own.”\n\n   [4] Second, the District demonstrated the socialization and\ncitizenship advantages of racially diverse schools. School\nofficials, relying on their experience as teachers and adminis-\ntrators, and the District’s expert all explained these benefits\non the record. According to the District’s expert, the social\nscience research “clearly and consistently shows that, for both\nwhite and minority students, a diverse educational experience\nresults in improvement in race-relations, the reduction of prej-\nudicial attitudes, and the achievement of a more . . . inclusive\nexperience for all citizens . . . . The research further shows\nthat only a desegregated and diverse school can offer such\nopportunities and benefits. The research further supports the\nproposition that these benefits are long lasting.” (Emphasis\nadded.) Even Parents’ expert conceded that “[t]here is general\nagreement by both experts and the general public that integra-\ntion is a desirable policy goal mainly for the social benefit of\nincreased information and understanding about the cultural\nand social differences among various racial and ethnic\ngroups.”14 That is, diversity encourages students not only to\nthink critically but also democratically.\n   14\n      Academic research has shown that intergroup contact reduces preju-\ndice and supports the values of citizenship. See Derek Black, Comment,\nThe Case for the New Compelling Government Interest: Improving Educa-\ntional Outcomes, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.C.</span> <span class=\"page\">L</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Rev. 923, 951-52 (2002) (collecting academic\nresearch demonstrating that interpersonal interaction in desegregated\nschools reduces racial prejudice and stereotypes, improving students’ citi-\nzenship values and their ability to succeed in a racially diverse society in\ntheir adult lives).\n\f14676        PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\n   Third, the District’s expert noted that “research shows that\na[ ] desegregated educational experience opens opportunity\nnetworks in areas of higher education and employment . . .\n[and] strongly shows that graduates of desegregated high\nschools are more likely to live in integrated communities than\nthose who do not, and are more likely to have cross-race\nfriendships later in life.”15\n\n   The District’s interests in the educational and social bene-\nfits of diversity are similar to those of a law school as articu-\nlated in Grutter. The contextual differences between public\nhigh schools and universities, however, make the District’s\ninterests compelling in a similar but also significantly differ-\nent manner. See Grutter, 539 U.S. at 330 (noting that the\ncompelling state interest in diversity is judged in relation to\nthe educational benefits that it seeks to produce).\n\n   [5] The Supreme Court in Grutter noted the importance of\nhigher education in “preparing students for work and citizen-\nship.” 539 U.S. at 331. For a number of reasons, public sec-\nondary schools have an equal if not more important role in\nthis preparation. First, underlying the history of desegregation\nin this country is a legal regime that recognizes the principle\nthat public secondary education serves a unique and vital\nsocialization function in our democratic society. As the Court\nexplained in Plyler v. Doe, “[w]e have recognized the public\nschools as a most vital civic institution for the preservation of\n   15\n      The District’s compelling interests in diversity have been endorsed by\nCongress. In the Magnet Schools Assistance Act, Congress found that “It\nis in the best interests of the United States — (A) to continue the Federal\nGovernment’s support of local educational agencies that are voluntarily\nseeking to foster meaningful interaction among students of different racial\nand ethnic backgrounds, beginning at the earliest stages of such students’\neducation; (B) to ensure that all students have equitable access to a high\nquality education that will prepare all students to function well in a tech-\nnologically oriented and a highly competitive economy comprised of peo-\nple from many different racial and ethnic backgrounds.” 20 U.S.C.\n§ 7231(a)(4) (emphasis added).\n\f            PARENTS INVOLVED v.

Bea, J., dissenting,\ninfra. at 14726-27. To attain this broader interest, the dissent\ncontends, the District may only consider race along with other\n\f           PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.        14679\nattributes such as socioeconomic status, ability to speak multi-\nple languages or extracurricular talents.

Avoiding the Harms Resulting               from    Racially\n  Concentrated or Isolated Schools\n\n   [9] The District’s interest in achieving the affirmative bene-\nfits of a racially diverse educational environment has a flip\nside: avoiding racially concentrated or isolated schools. In\nparticular, the District is concerned with making the educa-\ntional benefits of a diverse learning environment available to\nall its students and ensuring that “no student should be\nrequired to attend a racially concentrated school.” See “Board\nStatement Reaffirming Diversity Rationale,” quoted supra p.\n14674. Research regarding desegregation has found that\nracially concentrated or isolated schools are characterized by\nmuch higher levels of poverty, lower average test scores,\nlower levels of student achievement, with less-qualified teach-\ners and fewer advanced courses — “[w]ith few exceptions,\nseparate schools are still unequal schools.” See Erica Franken-\nberg et al., A Multiracial Society with Segregated Schools:\nAre We Losing the Dream? 11 (The Civil Rights Project, Har-\nvard Univ. Jan. 2003), at http://www.civilrightsproject.\nharvard.edu/research/reseg03/AreWeLosingtheDream.pdf)\n(hereinafter “Civil Rights Project”) (last visited October 11,\n\f14680        PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\n2005) (cited in Grutter, 539 U.S. at 345 (Ginsburg, J., concur-\nring)).\n\n   [10] In Seattle, the threat of having to attend a racially con-\ncentrated or isolated school is not a theoretical or imagined prob-\nlem.17 As the district court found, the District “established that\nhousing patterns in Seattle continue to be racially concentrat-\ned,” and would result in racially concentrated or isolated\nschools if school assignments were based solely on a stu-\ndent’s neighborhood or proximity to a particular high school.\nParents I, 137 F. Supp. 2d at 1235. Accordingly, the District’s\nPlan strives to ensure that patterns of residential segregation\nare not replicated in the District’s school assignments. Cf.\nComfort, 418 F.3d at 29 (“The problem is that in Lynn, as in\nmany other cities, minorities and whites often live in different\nneighborhoods. Lynn’s aim is to preserve local schools as an\noption without having the housing pattern of de facto segrega-\ntion projected into the school system.”) (Boudin, C.J., concur-\nring). Although Parents make much of the fact that “Seattle\nhas never operated a segregated school system,” and allege\nthat “this is not a school desegregation case,” each court to\nreview the matter has concluded that because of Seattle’s\nhousing patterns, high schools in Seattle would be highly seg-\nregated absent race conscious measures. See Parents I, 137 F.\nSupp. 2d at 1237; Parents II, 285 F.3d at 1239-40; Parents\nIII, 294 F.3d at 1088; Parents IV, 72 P.3d at 153.\n\n   [11] The district court found that, “[t]he circumstances that\ngave rise to the court-approved school assignment policies of\nthe 1970s [e.g., Seattle’s segregated housing patterns] con-\ntinue to be as compelling today as they were in the days of the\n  17\n     The prospect of children across the nation being required to attend\nracially concentrated or isolated schools is a crisis that school boards, dis-\ntricts, teachers and parents confront daily.

See Grutter, 539 U.S. at 334\n(stating that the narrow tailoring inquiry is context-specific\nand must be “calibrated to fit the distinct issues raised” in a\ngiven case, taking “relevant differences into account”) (inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted).\n\n  In Gratz, the Court held unconstitutional the University of\nMichigan’s undergraduate admissions program, which auto-\nmatically assigned 20 points on the admissions scale to an\napplicant from an underrepresented racial or ethnic minority\ngroup. 539 U.S. at 255, 272.

Individualized, Holistic Consideration of Applicants\n\n  a. An applicant’s qualifications\n\n   In the context of university admissions, where applicants\ncompete for a limited number of spaces in a class, the Court\nin Grutter and Gratz focused its inquiry on the role race may\nplay in judging an applicant’s qualifications. The Court’s\nunderlying concern was that the “admissions policy is flexible\nenough to consider all pertinent elements of diversity in light\nof the particular qualifications of each applicant, and to place\nthem on the same footing for consideration, although not nec-\nessarily according them the same weight.” Grutter, 539 U.S.\nat 337 (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted);\nsee Adarand, 515 U.S. at 211 (“The injury in cases of this\nkind is that a discriminatory classification prevent[s] the\nplaintiff from competing on an equal footing.”) (emphasis\nadded) (internal quotation marks omitted). The focus on fair\ncompetition is due, in part, to the stigma that may attach if\nsome individuals are viewed as unable to achieve success\nwithout special protection. See Regents of Univ. of Cal. v.\n\f14686        PARENTS INVOLVED v.

Unless they are strictly reserved for remedial settings,\nthey may in fact promote notions of racial inferiority and lead\nto a politics of racial hostility.”).\n\n   In Grutter and Gratz, in order to prevent race from being\nused as a mechanical proxy for an applicant’s qualifications,\nthe Court required individualized, holistic consideration of\neach applicant across a broad range of factors (of which race\nmay be but one). Grutter, 539 U.S. at 336-37; see Gratz, 539\nU.S. at 272 (holding that the undergraduate admissions policy\nwas not narrowly tailored because the “automatic distribution\nof 20 points has the effect of making ‘the factor of race . . .\ndecisive’ for virtually every minimally qualified underrepre-\nsented minority applicant”) (emphasis added). This focus on\nan applicant’s qualifications — whether these qualifications\nare such things as an applicant’s test scores, grades, artistic or\nathletic ability, musical talent or life experience — is not\napplicable when there is no competition or consideration of\nqualifications at issue.\n\n   [16] All of Seattle’s high school students must and will be\nplaced in a Seattle public school.21 Students’ relative qualifi-\ncations are irrelevant because regardless of their academic\nachievement, sports or artistic ability, musical talent or life\n  21\n     Parents do not claim that their children have a right to attend a particu-\nlar school, nor could they. See Bustop Inc., 439 U.S. at 1383 (rejecting any\nlegally protected right to have children attend their nearest school). In any\ncase, under the current Plan, all students can attend a school close to their\nhome. Because there are multiple schools in the north and south of Seattle,\nstudents for whom proximity is a priority may elect as their first choice\none of the schools in their residential area that is not oversubscribed and\nbe guaranteed an assignment to that school.\n\f               PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.             14687\nexperience, any student who wants to attend Seattle’s public\nhigh schools is entitled to an assignment; no assignment to\nany of the District’s high schools is tethered to a student’s\nqualifications. Thus, no stigma results from any particular\nschool assignment.22 Accordingly, the dangers that are present\nin the university context — of substituting racial preference\nfor qualification-based competition — are absent here. See\nComfort, 418 F.3d at 18 (“Because transfers under the Lynn\nPlan are not tied to merit, the Plan’s use of race does not risk\nimposing stigmatic harm by fueling the stereotype that ‘cer-\ntain groups are unable to achieve success without special pro-\ntection.’ ”) (quoting Bakke, 438 U.S. at 298).\n\n  b. Differences in compelling interests\n\n   The Court’s requirement of individualized, holistic review\nin Grutter is also more relevant to the compelling interest\nadvanced by the law school (“the robust exchange of ideas”\nfostered by viewpoint diversity) than it is to the District’s\n(racial diversity and avoiding racially concentrated or isolated\nschools). See Grutter, 539 U.S. at 337. The Court noted that\nthe law school did not “limit in any way . . . the broad range\nof qualities and experiences that may be considered valuable\ncontributions to student body diversity.” Id. at 338. To this\nend, the law school’s policy made clear that “[t]here are many\npossible bases for diversity admissions, and provide[d] exam-\nples of admittees who have lived or traveled widely abroad,\nare fluent in several languages, have overcome personal\n  22\n    In Bakke, Justice Powell noted:\n       Respondent’s position is wholly dissimilar to that of a pupil\n       bused from his neighborhood school to a comparable school in\n       another neighborhood in compliance with a desegregation decree.\n       Petitioner did not arrange for respondent to attend a different\n       medical school in order to desegregate Davis Medical School;\n       instead, it denied him admission and may have deprived him alto-\n       gether of a medical education.\n438 U.S. at 301 n.39.\n\f14688        PARENTS INVOLVED v.

(internal quotation marks and citations omit-\nted). These multiple bases for diversity ensure the “classroom\ndiscussion is livelier, more spirited, and simply more enlight-\nening and interesting when the students have the greatest pos-\nsible variety of backgrounds.” Id. at 330 (internal citations\nomitted).\n\n   Although the District’s Plan, like the plan in Grutter, is\ndesigned to achieve the educational and social benefits of\ndiversity, including bringing “different viewpoints and experi-\nences to classroom discussions,” see “Statement Reaffirming\nDiversity Rationale,” viewpoint diversity in the law school\nand high school contexts serves different albeit overlapping\nends. In the law school setting, viewpoint diversity fosters the\n“robust exchange of ideas.” Grutter, 539 U.S. at 324; see\nComfort, 418 F.3d at 16 (“[L]ively classroom discussion is a\nmore central form of learning in law schools (which prefer the\nSocratic method) than in a K-12 setting.”). In the high school\ncontext, viewpoint diversity fosters racial and civic understand-\ning.23 For example, Eric Benson, the principal of Nathan Hale\nHigh School, one of the District’s most popular schools, testi-\nfied that as a result of racial diversity in the classroom, “stu-\ndents of different races and backgrounds tend to have\nsignificant interactions both in class, and outside of class.\nWhen I came to Nathan Hale, there were racial tensions in the\n   23\n      The dissent believes that “the educational benefits from diversity, if\nany, are much greater at the higher educational level because such benefits\nare greatly magnified by the learning that takes place outside the class-\nroom . . . .” Bea, J., dissenting, infra. at 14737. This belittles the substan-\ntial role of high school classroom discussions in contributing to the\neducational development of our young citizens. “The [high school] class-\nroom is peculiarly the marketplace of ideas. The Nation’s future depends\nupon leaders trained through wide exposure to that robust exchange of\nideas which discovers truth out of a multitude of tongues.” Tinker v.

These\nkind of problems have, to a large extent, disappeared.”\n\n   In addition, the law school takes other diversity factors,\nbesides race and ethnicity, into consideration in order to\nachieve its other compelling interest — cultivating a group of\nnational leaders. For example, extensive travel, fluency in for-\neign languages, extensive community service and successful\ncareers in other fields demonstrate that a candidate is some-\nhow exceptional or out of the ordinary. cf. Gratz, 539 U.S. at\n273 (disapproving of the undergraduate admissions plan, in\npart, because of its failure to consider whether an applicant\nwas extraordinary and noting that “[e]ven if [a] student[’s]\n‘extraordinary artistic talent’ rivaled that of Monet or Picasso,\nthe applicant would receive, at most, five points” as opposed\nto the automatic 20 points given to an applicant from an\nunderrepresented minority). In contrast, the District is\nrequired to educate all high school age children, both the\naverage and the extraordinary, regardless of individual leader-\nship potential.\n\n   [17] The District also has a second compelling interest that\nis absent from the university context — ensuring that its\nschool assignments do not replicate Seattle’s segregated hous-\ning patterns. The holistic review necessary to achieve view-\npoint diversity in the university context, across a broad range\nof factors (of which race may be but one), is not germane to\nthe District’s compelling interest in preventing racial concen-\ntration or racial isolation. Because race itself is the relevant\nconsideration when attempting to ameliorate de facto segrega-\ntion, the District’s tiebreaker must necessarily focus on the\nrace of its students. See Comfort, 418 F.3d at 18 (holding that\nwhen racial diversity is the compelling interest — “[t]he only\nrelevant criterion, then, is a student’s race; individualized con-\nsideration beyond that is irrelevant to the compelling inter-\nest”); Brewer v. W. Irondequoit Cent. Sch. Dist., 212 F.3d at\n752 (“If reducing racial isolation is — standing alone — a\nconstitutionally permissible goal, . . . then there is no more\n\f14690        PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\neffective means of achieving that goal than to base decisions\non race.”). We therefore conclude that if a noncompetitive,\nvoluntary student assignment plan is otherwise narrowly tai-\nlored, a district need not consider each student in a individual-\nized, holistic manner.24\n\n   The dissent insists that absent such individualized consider-\nation, the District’s plan cannot serve a compelling interest\nand is not narrowly tailored to protect individuals from group\nclassifications by race. Bea, J., dissenting, infra. at 14740.\nThis is a flawed reading of the Fourteenth Amendment.25 The\nDistrict’s compelling interest is to avoid the harms of racial\nisolation for all students in the Seattle school district. As we\nhave explained, to accomplish that objective the District may\nlook to the racial consequences of honoring the preferred\nchoices of individual students (and their parents). It is true\nthat for some students their first choice of school, based on\ngeographical proximity, will be denied because other stu-\ndents’ choices are granted in order to advance the overall\ninterest in maintaining racially diverse school enrollments.\nThe Fourteenth Amendment in this context does not preclude\nthe District from honoring racial diversity at the expense of\n  24\n      The dissent calculates that individualized consideration would be\nadministratively feasible because only 300 students would need to be con-\nsidered holistically. Though it is true that 300 students were subject to the\nrace-based tiebreaker, it does not follow that only those 300 would require\nindividualized consideration. Under the dissent’s view of the way the Dis-\ntrict should operate, all 3,000 students would have to be subject to holistic\nconsideration to determine their proper school assignment. Whether or not\nthis is administratively feasible is not clear in the record, but we believe\nit is ultimately irrelevant because individualized consideration is not\nrequired in the context presented here.\n   25\n      Reliance on group characteristics is not necessarily constitutionally\ninfirm under Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence. See, e.g., Kimel v.\nFlorida Bd. of Regents, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118323\"><a href=\"/opinion/118323/kimel-v-florida-bd-of-regents/\"><span class=\"volume\">528</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">62</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 84 (2000) (“Under the Fourteenth\nAmendment, a State may rely on age as a proxy for other qualities, abili-\nties, or characteristics that are relevant to the State’s legitimate interests.\nThe Constitution does not preclude reliance on such generalizations.

We must not forget that “race unfor-\ntunately still matters,” Grutter, 539 U.S. at 333, and it is race\nthat is the relevant consideration here.\n\n   In sum, the contextual differences between public high\nschools and selective institutions of higher learning make the\nfirst of the Grutter hallmarks ill-suited for our narrow tailor-\ning inquiry.26 The remaining hallmarks, however, are relevant\nand control our analysis.\n\n  2. Absence of Quotas\n\n   In Grutter, the Court approved the law school’s plan, in\npart, because it did not institute a quota, whereby a fixed\nnumber of slots are reserved exclusively for minority groups,\nthereby insulating members of those groups from competition\nwith other candidates.27 539 U.S. at 335. Although the law\n  26\n      The dissent’s alternative proposals to achieve the District’s interests\nin diversity illustrate the difficulty of individualized consideration in the\nhigh school context. For example, the dissent offers socioeconomic status\nas a more narrowly tailored and acceptable form of diversifying the Dis-\ntrict’s schools. However, socioeconomic status does nothing more than\nsubstitute a number from a family’s tax return for race. There is no holis-\ntic, individualized consideration under such an approach.\n   27\n      Much like the rationale underlying the Court’s requirement of individ-\nualized, holistic review, the rationale underlying the Court’s prohibition of\nquotas does not apply to the race-based tiebreaker. In paradigmatic affir-\nmative action settings — employment and admissions to institutions of\nhigher learning — the Court disapproves of quotas because they are\nviewed as insulating minority candidates from competition with nonmi-\nnority candidates for scarce government resources usually awarded on the\nbasis of an applicant’s qualifications — jobs, promotions or places in a\nlaw school class. See Bakke, 438 U.S. at 317 (opinion of Powell, J.). This\nis objectionable because no “matter how strong their qualifications,” non-\nminority candidates are never afforded the chance to compete with appli-\ncants from the preferred groups for the set-aside. Id. at 319. Because\nnoncompetitive assignment to Seattle’s public high schools is not based on\na student’s relative qualifications, the dangers that are presented by a\nquota — of substituting racial preference for qualification-based competi-\ntion — are absent here.\n\f14692        PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\nschool’s plan did not seek to admit a set number or percentage\nof minority students, during the height of the admission’s sea-\nson, the law school would consult “daily reports” that kept\ntrack of the racial composition of the incoming class. Id. at\n318. The Court held that this attention to numbers did not\ntransform the law school plan into a quota, but instead dem-\nonstrated that the law school sought to enroll a critical mass\nof minority students in order “to realize the educational bene-\nfits of a diverse student body.” Id. Similarly, we conclude that\nthe District’s 15 percent plus or minus variance is not a quota\nbecause it does not reserve a fixed number of slots for stu-\ndents based on their race, but instead it seeks to enroll a criti-\ncal mass of white and nonwhite students in its oversubscribed\nschools in order to realize its compelling interests.28\n\n  a. No fixed number of slots\n\n   The District’s race-based tiebreaker does not set aside a\nfixed number of slots for nonwhite or white students in any\nof the District’s schools. The tiebreaker is used only so long\nas there are members of the underrepresented race in the\napplicant pool for a particular oversubscribed school. If the\nnumber of students of that race who have applied to that\nschool is exhausted, no further action is taken, even if the 15\npercent variance has not been satisfied. That is, if the appli-\ncant pool has been exhausted, no students are required or\nrecruited to attend a particular high school in order to bring\nit within the 15 percent plus or minus range for that year.\n  28\n     Although the dissent contends that the “tiebreaker aims for a rigid,\npredetermined ratio of white and nonwhite students,” we believe it is more\nappropriately viewed as a “permissible goal.” Such a goal “requires only\na good faith effort . . . to come within a range demarcated by the goal\nitself.” Grutter, 539 U.S at 334 (internal quotation marks and citation\nomitted). The tiebreaker’s broad, 30% range and the District’s willingness\nto turn off the use of the tiebreaker after the ninth grade are consistent with\na goal as opposed to a rigid ratio.\n\f             PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.                14693\n   Moreover, the number of white and nonwhite students in\nthe high schools is flexible and varies from school to school\nand from year to year.29 This variance in the number of non-\nwhite and white students throughout the District’s high\nschools is because, under the Plan, assignments are based on\nstudents’ and parents’ preferences.30 The tiebreakers come\ninto play in the assignment process only when a school is\noversubscribed. As Morgan Lewis, the Manager of Enroll-\nment Planning, Technical Support and Demographics, testi-\nfied, “If all the parents . . . don’t pick [a] school in a massive\nnumber, then everyone gets in. And so it’s . . . a case where\nthe choice patterns, the oversubscription . . . [is] the reason\nthe [tiebreaker] kicks in . . . . Everything happens when more\npeople want the seats. And why they want the seats some-\ntimes we don’t know.”\n\n  b. Critical mass\n\n   Within this flexible system, where parental and student\nchoices drive the assignments to particular schools, the Dis-\ntrict seeks to enroll and maintain a relatively stable critical\nmass of white and nonwhite students in each of its oversub-\nscribed high schools in order to achieve its compelling inter-\nest in racial diversity and to prevent the assignments from\n  29\n      Notably, the District’s percentage of white and nonwhite enrollment\nis significantly more varied than the percentage of underrepresented\nminorities admitted to the University of Michigan’s Law School, which\nremained relatively consistent. From 1995 to 1998, the percentage of\nminority students enrolled in the law school was 13.5 percent, 13.8 per-\ncent, 13.6 percent and 13.8 percent. Grutter, 539 U.S. at 389-90 (Ken-\nnedy, J., dissenting). In contrast, the District’s percentage of white and\nnonwhite enrollment encompasses a wide range. For example, for the\n2000-01 school year, the percentage of nonwhite students in the ninth\ngrade classes of the four oversubscribed public high schools after the\nracial tiebreaker was applied, varied from 54.2 percent at Ballard, to 59.5\npercent at Franklin, to 40.6 percent at Nathan Hale to 55.3 percent at Roo-\nsevelt.\n   30\n      Slightly more than 80 percent of all entering ninth grade students were\nassigned to their first choice school.\n\f14694       PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\nreplicating Seattle’s segregated housing patterns. Faced with\nthe question of what constituted a critical mass of students in\nthis particular context, the District determined that a critical\nmass was best achieved by adopting the 15 percent plus or\nminus variance tied to demographics of students in the Seattle\npublic schools. Thus, when an oversubscribed high school has\nmore than 75 percent nonwhite students (i.e., more than 15\npercent above the overall 60 percent nonwhite student popula-\ntion) and less than 25 percent white students, or when it has\nless than 45 percent nonwhite students (i.e., more than 15 per-\ncent below the overall 60 percent nonwhite student popula-\ntion) and more than 55 percent white students, the school is\nconsidered racially concentrated or isolated, meaning that it\nlacks a critical mass of students needed “to realize the educa-\ntional benefits of a diverse student body.”\n\n   Parents attack the District’s use of the 15 percent plus or\nminus variance tied to the District’s school population demo-\ngraphics because they believe that the District cannot use race\nat all in its assignment process. We have rejected this argu-\nment, however, applying Grutter and Gratz. See supra Part\nII.B. Alternatively, Parents contend that the District’s goal of\nenrolling between 75 and 45 percent nonwhite students and\nbetween 25 and 55 percent white students in its oversub-\nscribed schools establishes a quota, not a critical mass. They\nnote that the critical mass sought by the law school in Grutter\nwas smaller, consisting of between 12 and 20 percent of\nunderrepresented minority students in each law school class.\n\n   Parents’ argument, however, ignores Grutter’s admonition\nthat the narrow tailoring inquiry be context-specific. First, like\nthe District’s enrollment goals, which are tied to the demo-\ngraphics of the Seattle schools’ total student population, the\nlaw school’s goal of enrolling between 12 to 20 percent of\nunderrepresented minorities in a given year was tied to the\ndemographics of its applicant pool.31 Second, in tying the use\n  31\n    For example, in 1995, 662 (approximately 16 percent) of the 4147 law\nschool applicants were underrepresented minorities; in 1996, 559 (approx-\n\f            PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.             14695\nof the tiebreaker to the District’s demographics with a 15 per-\ncent plus or minus trigger point, the District adopted a com-\nmon benchmark in the context of voluntary and court-ordered\nschool desegregation plans. As the District’s expert testified,\n\n     Most of the cases I’ve participated in . . . generally\n     worked with numbers that reflect the racial composi-\n     tion of the school district but, at the same time,\n     tr[ied] to allow the district sufficient flexibility so\n     that it would not have to regularly and repeatedly\n     move students on a short-term basis simply to main-\n     tain some specific number. That’s why we see\n     ranges of plus or minus 15 percent in most cases of\n     school desegregation.\n\nEven Parents’ expert testified that school districts throughout\nthe country determine whether a district is sufficiently deseg-\nregated by looking to the “population of the district” in ques-\ntion. See also Comfort, 418 F.3d at 21 (holding that a\n“transfer policy conditioned on district demographics (+/- 10-\n15%)” was not a quota because it “reflects the defendants’\nefforts to obtain the benefits of diversity in a stable learning\nenvironment”); Belk v.

It is a context-\nspecific, flexible measurement of racial diversity designed to\nattain and maintain a critical mass of white and nonwhite stu-\ndents in Seattle’s public high schools.\n\n  3. Necessity of the Plan and Race-Neutral Alternatives\n\n   Narrow tailoring also requires us to consider the necessity\nof the race-based plan or policy in question and whether there\nare equally effective, race-neutral alternatives.\n\n  a. Necessity of the Plan\n\n   The District argues that the compelling interests that it\nseeks are directly served by the race-based tiebreaker. The tie-\nbreaker allows the District to balance students’ and parents’\nchoices among high schools with its broader compelling inter-\nests — achieving the educational and social benefits of diver-\nsity and the benefits specific to the secondary school context,\nand discouraging a return to enrollment patterns based on\nSeattle’s racially segregated housing pattern.\n\n    i. Need for race-based tiebreaker\n\n   When the District moved from its controlled choice plan to\nthe current Plan, see supra Part I.A, it predicted that families\nwould tend to choose schools close to their homes. Indeed,\n\f             PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.                14697\nthis feature was seen as a positive way to increase parental\ninvolvement. However, unfettered choice — especially with\ntiebreakers based on neighborhood or distance from a school\n— created the risk that Seattle’s high school enrollment\nwould again do no more than reflect its segregated housing\npatterns. See supra Part II.C.2.\n\n   It is this de facto residential segregation across a white/\nnonwhite axis that the District has battled historically and that\nit seeks to ameliorate by making the integration tiebreaker a\npart of its open choice Plan.32 The District, mindful of both\nSeattle’s history and future, appropriately places its focus\nhere. In the 2001-02 school year, the integration tiebreaker\noperated in three high schools (that is, three high schools were\noversubscribed and deviated by more than 15 percent from\nthe ratio of white to nonwhite students district-wide). The\nintegration tiebreaker served to alter the imbalance in the\nschools in which it operated in a minimally intrusive manner.\nThe tiebreaker, therefore, successfully achieved the District’s\ncompelling interests.\n\n       ii. White/Nonwhite distinction\n\n   Parents argue that the District paints with too broad a brush\nby distinguishing only between white and nonwhite students,\nwithout taking into account the diversity within the “non-\nwhite” group. However, the District’s choice to increase\ndiversity along the white/nonwhite axis is rooted in Seattle’s\nhistory and current reality of de facto segregation resulting\nfrom Seattle’s segregated housing patterns. The white/\nnonwhite distinction is narrowly tailored to prioritize move-\n  32\n    Although we characterize it as de facto residential segregation, we are\nmindful of Justice Marshall’s dissent in Board of Education v. Dowell,\n“The . . . conclusion that the racial identity of the northeast quadrant now\nsubsists because of ‘personal preference[s]’ pays insufficient attention to\nthe roles of the State, local officials, and the Board in creating what are\nnow self-perpetuating patterns of residential segregation.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112520\"><a href=\"/opinion/112520/board-of-ed-of-oklahoma-city-public-schools-v-dowell/\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">237</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n263 (1991) (internal citation omitted).\n\f14698       PARENTS INVOLVED v.

This white/nonwhite focus is also consis-\ntent with the history of public school desegregation measures\nthroughout the country, as reflected in a current federal regu-\nlation defining “[m]inority group isolation” as “a condition in\nwhich minority group children constitute more than 50 per-\ncent of the enrollment of the school,” without distinguishing\namong the various categories included within the definition of\n“minority group.” 34 C.F.R. § 280.4(b); see Grutter, 539 U.S.\nat 316 (noting that the law school sought to enroll a critical\nmass of “minority students,” a category that included African\nAmericans, Hispanics and Native Americans); Comfort, 418\nF.3d at 22 (“By increasing diversity along the white/nonwhite\naxis, the Plan reduced racial tensions and produced positive\neducational benefits. Narrow tailoring does not require that\nLynn ensure diversity among every racial and ethnic sub-\ngroup as well.”) (emphasis added).\n\n  b. Race-neutral alternatives\n\n   In Grutter, the Court explained that narrow tailoring “re-\nquire[s] serious, good faith consideration of workable race-\nneutral alternatives that will achieve the diversity the univer-\nsity seeks.” 539 U.S. at 339 (emphasis added). On the other\nhand, “[n]arrow tailoring does not require exhaustion of every\nconceivable race-neutral alternative.” Id. Furthermore, the\nCourt made clear that the university was not required to adopt\nrace-neutral measures that would have forced it to sacrifice\nother educational values central to its mission. Id. at 340.\nImplicit in the Court’s analysis was a measure of deference\ntoward the university’s identification of those values.33 See id.\n  33\n     The Supreme Court repeatedly has shown deference to school officials\nat the intersection between constitutional protections and educational pol-\nicy. See generally Wendy Parker, Connecting the Dots: Grutter, School\nDesegregation, and Federalism, 45 Wm. & Mary L. Rev. 1691 (2004).\nThe theme of local control over public education has animated Supreme\nCourt jurisprudence. See, e.g., Brown, 349 U.S. at 299 (directing local\n\f             PARENTS INVOLVED v.

Using poverty as an alternative measure of diversity\n\n   The record demonstrates that the School Board considered\nusing a poverty tiebreaker in place of the race-based tie-\nbreaker. It concluded, however, that this proxy device would\nnot achieve its compelling interest in achieving racial diver-\nsity, and had other adverse effects. Although there was no for-\nmal study of the proposal by District staff, Board members’\ntestimony revealed two legitimate reasons why the Board\nrejected the use of poverty to reach its goal of racial diversity.\nFirst, the Board concluded that it is insulting to minorities and\noften inaccurate to assume that poverty correlates with minor-\nity status. Second, for the group of students for whom poverty\nwould correlate with minority status, the implementation\nwould have been thwarted by high school students’ under-\n\nschool officials, with court oversight, to devise remedies for segregation\nin the light of “varied local school problems”); Milliken v.

These Supreme Court decisions\nsuggest that secondary schools occupy a unique position in our constitu-\ntional tradition.

SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\nstandable reluctance to reveal their socioeconomic status to\ntheir peers.\n\n   Because racial diversity is a compelling interest, the Dis-\ntrict may permissibly seek it if it does so in a narrowly tai-\nlored manner. We do not require the District to conceal its\ncompelling interest of achieving racial diversity and avoiding\nracial concentration or isolation through the use of “some\nclumsier proxy device” such as poverty. See Comfort, 418\nF.3d at 29 (Boudin, C.J., concurring).\n\n    ii. The Urban League plan\n\n   Parents also assert that the District should have more for-\nmally considered an Urban League proposal, which did not\neliminate the integration tiebreaker but merely considered it\nafter other factors. The Urban League plan was a comprehen-\nsive plan seeking to enhance the quality of education in Seat-\ntle’s schools by focusing on educational organization, teacher\nquality, parent-teacher interaction, raising curricular stan-\ndards, substantially broadening the availability of specialized\nand magnet programs (which could attract a broader cross-\nsection of students to undersubscribed schools) and support-\ning extra-curricular development. The plan proposed decreas-\ning the School District’s reliance on race in the assignment\nprocess by pairing neighborhoods with particular schools and\ncreating a type of neighborhood/regional school model. Under\nthe Urban League plan, preference initially would be given to\nstudents choosing a school in their paired region, and the\nexisting racial tiebreaker would be demoted from second to\nthird in the process of resolving any remaining oversubscrip-\ntion. The plan also suggested adding an eleventh high school.\n\n   Board members testified that they rejected the plan because\nof the high value the District places on parental and student\nchoice. Moreover, given Seattle’s segregated housing pat-\nterns, by prioritizing a neighborhood/regional school model\nwhere students are assigned to schools close to their homes,\n\f           PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.        14701\nthe Urban League plan did not sufficiently ensure the achieve-\nment of the District’s compelling interests in racial diversity\nand avoidance of racial concentration or isolation. As one\nmember of the School Board testified, “[it] would become\nControlled Choice all over again. That’s basically what Con-\ntrolled Choice was, [ ] a regional plan; it controlled your\noptions by using regions or geography.” It was therefore per-\nmissible for the District to reject a plan that neither comported\nwith its priorities nor achieved its compelling interests.\n\n    iii. Lottery\n\n   Parents additionally contend in this court that the District\nshould have considered using a lottery to assign students to\nthe oversubscribed high schools. As an initial matter, we note\nthat Parents did not argue before the district court that a lot-\ntery was a workable race-neutral alternative that would\nachieve the Districts’ compelling interests. Parents now argue\non appeal, however, that a lottery would achieve the District’s\ncompelling interests without having to resort to the race-based\ntiebreaker. They ask us to assume that because approximately\n82 percent of all students want to attend one of Seattle’s over-\nsubscribed schools, the makeup of this 82 percent, as well as\nthat of the applicant pool for each school, mirrors the demo-\ngraphics of the District (60 percent white and 40 percent non-\nwhite). Employing this assumption, Parents also ask us to\nassume that a random lottery drawing from this pool would\nproduce a student body in each of the oversubscribed schools\nthat falls within the District’s 15 percent plus or minus vari-\nance. These assumptions, however, are not supported —\nindeed, are undercut — by the factual record. For example,\nSuperintendent Olchefske explained that District patterns\nindicate that more people choose schools close to home. That\nwould mean that the pool of applicants would be skewed in\nfavor of the demographic of the surrounding residential area.\nThat is, the applicant pool for the north area oversubscribed\nhigh schools would have a higher concentration of white stu-\ndents and the applicant pool for the south area oversubscribed\n\f14702      PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\nhigh school would have a higher concentration of nonwhite\nstudents. Thus, random sampling from such a racially skewed\npool would produce a racially skewed student body. As one\nBoard member testified, a lottery was not a viable alternative\nbecause “[i]f applicants are overwhelmingly majority and you\nhave a lottery, then your lottery — the pool of your lottery\nkids are going to be overwhelmingly majority. We have a\ndiversity goal.”\n\n   Although the District has the burden of demonstrating that\nits Plan is narrowly tailored, see Gratz, 539 U.S. at 270, it\nneed not “exhaust[ ] every conceivable race-neutral alterna-\ntive.” Grutter, 539 U.S. at 339. Parents’ belated and bald\nassertion that a lottery could achieve the District’s compelling\ninterests, without any evidence to support their claim, fails to\ndemonstrate that a lottery is a viable race-neutral alternative.\nSee id. at 340 (dismissing the race-neutral alternative of “per-\ncentage plans,” advocated by the United States in an amicus\nbrief, because the “United States [did] not . . . explain how\nsuch plans could work for graduate and professional\nschools”); Comfort, 418 F.3d at 23 (noting that Lynn rejected\nthe use of a lottery in place of the race-based tiebreaker and\nholding that “Lynn must keep abreast of possible alternatives\nas they develop . . . but it need not prove the impracticability\nof every conceivable model for racial integration”) (internal\ncitation omitted).\n\n  c. The District’s use of race\n\n   The dissent posits variables the District could use instead\nof race, for example, embracing the San Francisco school dis-\ntrict’s approach as a possible model for integration that would\nmeet the dissent’s criteria. Bea, J., dissenting, infra. at 14750-\n51, n.24. Perhaps San Francisco has experienced success\n(however that school district defines it) in its multi-variable\nplan — the details and evaluations of which are not in the\nrecord. The District is free to consider the San Francisco\nmodel when it engages in the annual review of its own Plan.\n\f           PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.       14703\nHowever, even assuming that San Francisco’s plan is work-\ning, that does not mean that it must be used by other cities in\nother states. Much can be gained from the various states\nemploying locally appropriate means to achieve desirable\nends. In our system, where states are considered laboratories\nto be used to experiment with myriad approaches to resolving\nsocial problems, we certainly should not punish one school\ndistrict for not adopting the approach of another. Justice Bran-\ndeis said it well,\n\n    There must be power in the States and the Nation to\n    remould, through experimentation, our economic\n    practices and institutions to meet changing social\n    and economic needs . . . .

It is one of\n    the happy incidents of the federal system that a sin-\n    gle courageous State may, if its citizens choose,\n    serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and eco-\n    nomic experiments without risk to the rest of the\n    country.\n\nNew State Ice Co. v.

Even Parents’ expert conceded that, “if you don’t\n\f14704        PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\nconsider race, it may not be possible to offer an integrated\noption to students. . . .

Undue Harm\n\n   A narrowly tailored plan ensures that no member of any\nracial group is unduly harmed. Grutter, 539 U.S. at 341. Par-\nents argue that every student who is denied his or her choice\nof schools because of the integration tiebreaker suffers a con-\nstitutionally significant burden. We agree with the Supreme\nCourt of Washington, however, in its assessment that the Dis-\ntrict’s Plan imposes a minimal burden that is shared equally\nby all of the District’s students. Parents IV, 72 P.3d at 159-60\n(noting that the burden of not being allowed to attend one’s\npreferred school is shared by all students equally). As that\ncourt noted, it is well established that “there [is] no right\nunder Washington law to attend a local school or the school\nof the student’s choice.” Id. at 159.35 Indeed, public schools,\n  34\n      The dissent urges, “The way to end discrimination is to stop discrimi-\nnating by race.” Bea, J., dissenting, infra. at 14762. More properly stated,\nthe way to end segregation is to stop separation of the races.

When an applicant’s qualifications are not under\nconsideration at all, there is no notion that one student is enti-\ntled to a place at any particular school. See Comfort, 418 F.3d\nat 20 (“The denial of a transfer under the [District’s] Plan is\n. . . markedly different from the denial of a spot at a unique\nor selective educational institution.”).\n\n   Moreover, it is undisputed that the race-based tiebreaker\ndoes not uniformly benefit one race or group to the detriment\nof another. At some schools, white students are given prefer-\nence over nonwhite students, and, at other schools, nonwhite\nstudents are given preference over white students. For exam-\nple, in the 2000-01 school year, 89 more white students were\nassigned to Franklin, one of Seattle’s most popular schools,\nthan would have been assigned absent the tiebreaker; 107\nmore nonwhite students were assigned to Ballard, another of\nSeattle’s most popular schools, than would have been\nassigned absent the tiebreaker; 27 more nonwhite students\nwere assigned to Nathan Hale than would have been assigned\nabsent the tiebreaker; and 82 more nonwhite students were\nassigned to Roosevelt than would have been absent the tie-\nbreaker.36\n\n   [20] In sum, because (1) the District is entitled to assign all\nstudents to any of its schools, (2) no student is entitled to\nattend any specific school and (3) the tiebreaker does not uni-\nformly benefit any race or group of individuals to the detri-\n  36\n    As detailed earlier, the Board’s decision to change the trigger point for\nuse of the tiebreaker from plus or minus 10 percent to plus or minus 15\npercent had the effect of rendering Roosevelt High School neutral for\ndesegregation purposes. Thus, the tiebreaker did not factor into assign-\nments to Roosevelt High School in the 2001-02 school year.\n\f14706        PARENTS INVOLVED v.

Sunset Provision\n\n   [21] A narrowly tailored plan must be limited not only in\nscope, but also in time. Grutter, 539 U.S. at 342. The Court\nheld in Grutter that this durational requirement can be met by\n“periodic reviews to determine whether racial preferences are\nstill necessary to achieve student body diversity.” Id. The Dis-\ntrict’s Plan includes such reviews. It revisits the Plan annually\nand has demonstrated its ability to be responsive to parents’\nand students’ choice patterns and to the concerns of its con-\nstituents. For example, in 2000, when a higher than normal\nnumber of students selected the same schools, the Board\nresponded by increasing the race-based trigger from 10 per-\ncent to a 15 percent deviation from the school population,\nadopting the thermostat that turns off the tiebreaker as soon\nas the school has come within the 15 percent plus or minus\ntrigger point and by using the tiebreaker solely for the incom-\ning ninth grade class.\n\n   [22] With respect to the dissent’s concern for a “logical end\npoint,” Bea, J., dissenting, infra. at 14755, like Justice\nO’Connor this court shares in the hope that “25 years from\nnow, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary\nto further the interest approved today.” Grutter, 539 U.S. at\n343. We expect that the District will continue to review its\nPlan, and we presume, as did the Court in Grutter, that school\nofficials will demonstrate a good faith commitment to moni-\ntoring the continued need for the race-based tiebreaker and\nterminating its use when that need ends.37 See 539 U.S. at 343.\n  37\n    It is worth noting that plans like the District’s may actually contribute\nto achieving the Court’s vision in Grutter that racial preferences will no\nlonger be necessary in 25 years — or even sooner. As Justice Ginsburg\nobserved, “As lower school education in minority communities improves,\nan increase in the number of [highly qualified and competitive] students\nmay be anticipated.” Grutter, 539 U.S. at 346 (Ginsburg, J., concurring).\n\f          PARENTS INVOLVED v.

When the government\nseeks to use racial classifications to oppress blacks or other\nminorities, no conceivable justification will be sufficiently\ncompelling. See, e.g., Yick Wo v. Hopkins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"91704\"><a href=\"/opinion/91704/yick-wo-v-hopkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">356</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 374\n(1886). Similarly, when lawyers use peremptory challenges to\nexclude jurors of a particular race, thereby denying them the\nright to participate in government service, they must justify\ntheir challenges based on objective, non-racial considerations;\njustifications based on race will be rejected out of hand, no\nmatter how compelling they might seem. See Batson v. Ken-\ntucky, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111662\"><a href=\"/opinion/111662/batson-v-kentucky/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 85-88 (1986). When government seeks to\nsegregate the races, as in Johnson, the courts will look with\ngreat skepticism at the justifications offered in support of such\nprograms, and will reject them when they reflect assumptions\nabout the conduct of individuals based on their race or skin\ncolor. See Johnson, 125 S. Ct. at 1154 (Stevens, J., dissenting)\n(concluding that California’s policy of racially segregating\ninmates “supports the suspicion that the policy is based on\nracial stereotypes and outmoded fears about the dangers of\nracial integration”). When the government engages in racial\ngerrymandering, it not only keeps the races apart, but exacer-\nbates racial tensions by making race a proxy for political\npower. See Shaw v. Reno, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112905\"><a href=\"/opinion/112905/shaw-v-reno/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">630</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 648 (1993) (“When\na district obviously is created solely to effectuate the per-\n\f14712      PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\nceived common interests of one racial group, elected officials\nare more likely to believe that their primary obligation is to\nrepresent only the members of that group, rather than their\nconstituency as a whole.”). Programs seeking to help minori-\nties by giving them preferences in contracting, see, e.g., Ada-\nrand, and education, see, e.g., Bakke, benign though they may\nbe in their motivations, pit the races against each other, and\ncast doubts on the ability of minorities to compete with the\nmajority on an equal footing.\n\n   The Seattle plan suffers none of these defects. It certainly\nis not meant to oppress minorities, nor does it have that effect.\nNo race is turned away from government service or services.\nThe plan does not segregate the races; to the contrary, it seeks\nto promote integration. There is no attempt to give members\nof particular races political power based on skin color. There\nis no competition between the races, and no race is given a\npreference over another. That a student is denied the school\nof his choice may be disappointing, but it carries no racial\nstigma and says nothing at all about that individual’s aptitude\nor ability. The program does use race as a criterion, but only\nto ensure that the population of each public school roughly\nreflects the city’s racial composition.\n\n   Because the Seattle plan carries none of the baggage the\nSupreme Court has found objectionable in cases where it has\napplied strict scrutiny and narrow tailoring, I would consider\nthe plan under a rational basis standard of review. By rational\nbasis, I don’t mean the standard applied to economic regula-\ntions, where courts shut their eyes to reality or even invent\njustifications for upholding government programs, see, e.g.,\nWilliamson v. Lee Optical of Okla., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105285\"><a href=\"/opinion/105285/williamson-v-lee-optical-of-okla-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">348</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1955),\nbut robust and realistic rational basis review, see, e.g., City of\nCleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111507\"><a href=\"/opinion/111507/cleburne-v-cleburne-living-center-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">432</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1985),\nwhere courts consider the actual reasons for the plan in light\nof the real-world circumstances that gave rise to it.\n\n   Under this standard, I have no trouble finding the Seattle\nplan constitutional. Through their elected officials, the people\n\f           PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.        14713\nof Seattle have adopted a plan that emphasizes school choice,\nyet tempers such choice somewhat in order to ensure that the\nschools reflect the city’s population. Such stirring of the melt-\ning pot strikes me as eminently sensible.\n\n   The record shows, and common experience tells us, that\nstudents tend to select the schools closest to their homes,\nwhich means that schools will reflect the composition of the\nneighborhood where they are located. Neighborhoods, how-\never, do not reflect the racial composition of the city as a\nwhole. In Seattle, “as in many other cities, minorities and\nwhites often live in different neighborhoods.” Comfort, 418\nF.3d at 29 (Boudin, C.J., concurring). To the extent that stu-\ndents gravitate to the schools near their homes, the schools\nwill have the same racial composition as the neighborhood.\nThis means that student patterns of interacting primarily with\nmembers of their own race that are first developed by living\nin racially isolated neighborhoods will be continued and exac-\nerbated by the school experience.\n\n   It is difficult to deny the importance of teaching children,\nduring their formative years, how to deal respectfully and col-\nlegially with peers of different races. Whether one would call\nthis a compelling interest or merely a highly rational one\nstrikes me as little more than semantics. The reality is that\nattitudes and patterns of interaction are developed early in life\nand, in a multicultural and diverse society such as ours, there\nis great value in developing the ability to interact successfully\nwith individuals who are very different from oneself. It is\nimportant for the individual student, to be sure, but it is also\nvitally important for us as a society.\n\n   It may be true, as the dissent suggests, that students are\ninfluenced far more by their experiences in the home, church\nand social clubs they attend outside of school. But this does\nnot negate the fact that time spent in school and on school-\nrelated activities, which may take up as much as half of a stu-\ndent’s waking hours, nevertheless has a significant impact on\n\f14714      PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\nthat student’s development. The school environment forces\nstudents both to compete and cooperate in the classroom, as\nwell as during extracurricular activities ranging from football\nto forensics. Schoolmates often become friends, rivals and\nromantic partners; learning to deal with individuals of differ-\nent races in these various capacities cannot help but foster the\nlive-and-let-live spirit that is the essence of the American\nexperience. I believe this is a rational objective for an educa-\ntional system—every bit as rational as teaching the three Rs,\nadvanced chemistry or driver’s education. Schools, after all,\ndon’t simply prepare students for further education, though\nthey certainly can and should do that; good schools prepare\nstudents for life, by instilling skills and attitudes that will\nserve them long after their first year of college.\n\n   To borrow Judge Boudin’s words once again, the plan here\nis “far from the original evils at which the Fourteenth Amend-\nment was addressed. . . . This is not a case in which, against\nthe background of core principles, all doubts should be\nresolved against constitutionality.” Comfort, 418 F.3d at 29\n(Boudin, C.J., concurring). I am acutely mindful of the\nSupreme Court’s strong admonition only last Term that any\nand all racial classifications must be adjudged under the strict\nscrutiny standard of review. See Johnson, 125 S. Ct. at 1146\n(citing cases). But the Supreme Court’s opinions are necessar-\nily forged by the cases presented to it; where the case at hand\ndiffers in material respects from those the Supreme Court has\npreviously decided, I would hope that those seemingly cate-\ngorical pronouncements will not be applied without consider-\nation of whether they make sense beyond the circumstances\nthat occasioned them.\n\n   When the Supreme Court does review the Seattle plan, or\none like it, I hope the justices will give serious thought to\nbypassing strict—and almost always deadly—scrutiny, and\nadopt something more akin to rational basis review. Not only\ndoes a plan that promotes the mixing of races deserve support\nrather than suspicion and hostility from the judiciary, but\n\f           PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.       14715\nthere is much to be said for returning primacy on matters of\neducational policy to local officials. Long past is the day\nwhen losing an election or a legislative vote on a hotly con-\ntested issue was considered the end of the matter—at least\nuntil the next election when the voters might “throw the ras-\ncals out.” Too often nowadays, an election or a vote is a mere\nprecursor to litigation, with the outcome of the dispute not\nknown until judges decide the case many years later.\n\n   Whatever else the strict scrutiny standard of review may\ndo, it most certainly encourages resort to the courts and often\ndelays implementation of a program for years. The more com-\nplex and exacting the standard of review, the more uncertain\nthe outcome, and the greater are the incentives for the parties\nto bloat the record with depositions, expert reports, exhibits,\ndocuments and various other materials they hope will catch\nthe eye of the judges who ultimately decide the issue. This is\na perfectly fine example, the litigation having taken over five\nyears so far, generating 11 published opinions from the 24\njudges who have considered the matter in the federal and state\ncourts. In the meantime, the plan was put on hold, and at least\none class has entered and will have completed its entire high\nschool career without ever being affected by it.\n\n   While it’s tempting to adopt rules of law that give us the\nultimate say on hotly contested political questions, we should\nkeep in mind that we are not infallible, nor are we the reposi-\ntory of ultimate wisdom. Elected officials, who are much\ncloser to ground zero than we are—and whose political power\nebbs and flows with the approval of the voters—understand\nthe realities of the situation far better than we can, no matter\nhow many depositions and expert reports we may read in the\nquiet of our chambers. It therefore behooves us to approach\nissues such as those presented here with a healthy dose of\nmodesty about our ability to understand the past or predict the\nfuture. It should make us chary about use of the strict scrutiny\nstandard of review, which proclaims us the ultimate arbiters\nof the issue and gives those who oppose the policy in question\n\f14716       PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\nevery incentive to turn litigation, to paraphrase Clausewitz,\ninto a continuation of politics by other means.\n\n   To resort to Chief Judge Boudin’s words one last time, “we\nare faced with a local experiment, pursuing plausible goals by\nnovel means that are not squarely condemned by past\nSupreme Court precedent. The problems that the . . . plan\naddresses are real, and time is more likely than court hearings\nto tell us whether the solution is a good one . . . .” Comfort,\n418 F.3d at 29 (Boudin, C.J., concurring). I share Judge\nBoudin’s preference for resolving such difficult issues by trial\nand error in the real world, rather than by experts jousting in\nthe courtroom. When it comes to a plan such as this—a plan\nthat gives the American melting pot a healthy stir without\nbenefitting or burdening any particular group—I would leave\nthe decision to those much closer to the affected community,\nwho have the power to reverse or modify the policy should it\nprove unworkable. It is on this basis that I would affirm the\njudgment of the district court.\n\n\n\nBEA, Circuit Judge, with whom Circuit Judges KLEINFELD,\nTALLMAN and CALLAHAN join dissenting:\n\n  I respectfully dissent.\n\n   At the outset, it is important to note what this case is not\nabout. The idea that children will gain social, civic, and per-\nhaps educational skills by attending schools with a proportion\nof students of other ethnicities and races, which proportion\nreflects the world in which they will move, is a notion\ngrounded in common sense. It may be generally, if not univer-\nsally, accepted.1 But that is not the issue here. The issue here\nis whether this idea may be imposed by government coercion,\nrather than societal conviction; whether students and their par-\n  1\n   For a dissenting view, see infra pp. 14731-33.\n\f             PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.                 14717\nents may choose, or whether their government may choose for\nthem.2\n\n   In the Seattle School District (“District”), some schools are\noversubscribed and in higher demand than others, so the Dis-\ntrict uses a tiebreaker to assign some ninth-grade students, and\nnot others, to those schools. The tiebreaker operates solely on\nthe basis of the student’s race. In fact, rather than differentiat-\ning between African-American, Asian-American, Latino,\nNative American, or Caucasian students, the tiebreaker classi-\nfies students only as “white” or “nonwhite.”3 The District\nseeks a racially balanced student body of 40% white, 60%\nnonwhite children; the tiebreaker excludes white or nonwhite\nstudents from an oversubscribed school if their admission will\nnot further that preferred ratio.\n\n   Notwithstanding the majority’s fervent defense of that plan,\nthe District is engaged in simple racial balancing, which the\nEqual Protection Clause forbids. The majority can arrive at\nthe opposite conclusion only by applying a watered-down\n  2\n     Because of our country’s struggle with racial division and the injustices\nof compelled government de jure segregation, we must be especially\nsuspicious of any compulsive government program based upon race, even\nwhen such a program is supposedly beneficial.

The very differences between the Grutter “diversi-\nty” interest and the District’s asserted interest illustrate why\nthe latter violates the Equal Protection Clause as opposed to\nthe former. The Grutter “diversity” interest focuses upon the\nindividual, of which race plays a part, but not the whole.

In Grutter, the “context” was a public law school’s race-\nconscious, individualized consideration of applicants for purposes of\nadmissions, designed to achieve diversity. Here, the context is different;\nwe consider a rigid racial tiebreaker, which considers only race, designed\nto avoid racial imbalance in the schools.

The “context” of the Michigan Law\nSchool is different from the District’s schools.

Rather, the diversity that furthers a compelling\n       state interest encompasses a far broader array of\n       qualifications and characteristics of which racial or\n       ethnic origin is but a single though important ele-\n       ment.\n\nGrutter, 539 U.S. at 324-25 (emphasis added); see Gratz, 539\nU.S. at 272-73 (“[T]he critical criteria [in a permissible race-\nconscious admissions program] are often individual qualities\nor experiences not dependent upon race but sometimes associ-\nated with it.”).\n\n   The Grutter “diversity” interest focuses upon the individ-\nual, which can include the applicant’s race, but also includes\nother factors, such as the applicant’s family background, her\nparent’s educational history, whether she is fluent in other\nlanguages, whether she has overcome adversity or hardship,\nor whether she has unique athletic or artistic talents.

To the con-\ntrary, the racial tiebreaker considers only whether the student\nis white or nonwhite. While the Grutter “diversity” interest\npursues genuine diversity in the student body (of which race\nis only a single “plus” factor), the District pursues an interest\nwhich considers only racial diversity, i.e., a predefined group-\ning of races in the District’s schools.13 Such an interest is not\n  13\n    The majority fails to recognize this distinction.

See id. at 330 (stating\na government institution’s interest “to assure within its stu-\ndent body some specified percentage of a particular group\nmerely because of its race . . . would amount to outright racial\nbalancing, which is patently unconstitutional”).\n\n   Grutter emphasized the dangers resulting from lack of an\nindividualized consideration of each applicant. Observing that\nthe Michigan Law School sought an unquantified “critical\nmass” of minority students to avoid only token representation,\nrather than some defined balance, id. at 330, the Court rea-\nsoned the law school’s individualized focus on students form-\ning that “critical mass” would avoid perpetuating the\nstereotype that all “minority students always . . . express some\ncharacteristic minority viewpoint on any issue,” id. at 333.\n\n   But here, the District’s concept of racial diversity is a pre-\ndetermined, defined ratio of white and nonwhite children. The\nracial tiebreaker works to exclude white students from schools\nthat have a 50-55% white student body (depending on the tie-\nbreaker trigger used in a particular year), and works to\nexclude nonwhite students from schools with a 70-75% non-\nwhite student body (depending on the tiebreaker trigger used).\nThus, the District’s concept of racial diversity does not permit\n\nmajority reasons high schools “have an equal if not more important role”\nin preparing students for work and citizenship, and concludes “it would be\na perverse reading of the Equal Protection Clause that would allow a uni-\nversity, educating a relatively small percentage of the population, to use\nrace when choosing its student body but not allow a public school district,\neducating all children attending its schools, to consider a student’s race in\norder to ensure that the high schools within the district attain and maintain\ndiverse student bodies.” Majority op. at 14676, 14678. Yet Grutter did not\nallow universities to consider race in admissions to achieve racial balanc-\ning. The whole point of Grutter and Gratz was that universities may con-\nsider race, but only as part of the overall individual. I see nothing perverse\nin recognizing the Equal Protection Clause to be the protector of the indi-\nvidual, whether he be among the few at an elite law school, or among the\nmany in a public high school.\n\f             PARENTS INVOLVED v.

That argument, however, is based on the stereotype that\nall white children express traditional white viewpoints and\nexhibit traditional white mannerisms; all nonwhite children\nexpress opposite nonwhite viewpoints and exhibit nonwhite\nmannerisms, and thereby white and nonwhite children will\nbetter understand each other. Yet there is nothing in the racial\ntiebreaker to ensure such viewpoints and mannerisms are rep-\nresented within the preferred student body ratio. As noted in\nGrutter, the only way to achieve diverse viewpoints and man-\nnerisms is to look at the individual student. White children\nhave different viewpoints and backgrounds than other white\nchildren; the same goes for nonwhite children; and some\nwhite children have the same viewpoints and backgrounds as\nsome nonwhite children. The assumption that there is a differ-\nence between individuals just because there is a difference in\ntheir skin color is a stereotype in itself, nothing more.14\n\n   The District also claims it must use the racial tiebreaker to\navoid racially imbalanced schools, which may result in\nschools with large white or nonwhite student bodies and in\nwhich the supposed benefits from the District’s concept of\nracial diversity will not occur.

Although the District encourages\nthe students’ parents to identify the race of their student in the registration\nmaterials, if a parent or student chooses to follow the example of Tiger\nWoods and refuses to identify his or her race, the District then engages in\na visual inspection of the student or parent and will decide the child’s\ncolor notwithstanding the parent’s or student’s choice.\n\f           PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.        14731\n   Unlike a voluntary decision by parents to expose their chil-\ndren to individuals of different races or background, the Dis-\ntrict classifies each student by skin color and excludes certain\nstudents from particular schools—solely on the basis of race\n—to ensure those schools remain racially balanced. Even if\nwell-intentioned, the District’s use of racial classifications in\nsuch a stark and compulsory fashion risks perpetuating the\nsame racial divisions which have plagued this country since\nits founding:\n\n    Race is perhaps the worst imaginable category\n    around which to organize group competition and\n    social relations more generally. At the risk of bela-\n    boring the obvious, racial categories in law have\n    played an utterly pernicious and destructive role\n    throughout human history. This incontrovertible fact\n    should arouse wonder . . . at the hubris of those who\n    imagine that we can distinguish clearly enough\n    between invidious and benign race discrimination to\n    engrave this distinction into our constitutional order.\n    Vast human experience mocks this comforting illu-\n    sion, as does the fact that most Americans, including\n    many minorities, think racial preferences are invidi-\n    ous, not benign. Whether benignly intended or not,\n    using the category of race—which affirmative action\n    proponents oddly depict as socially constructed and\n    primordial and immutable—to distribute advantage\n    and disadvantage tends to ossify the fluid, forward-\n    looking political identities that a robust democratic\n    spirit inspires and requires.\n\nPeter H.

Although the District con-\ntends it uses the racial tiebreaker for good, i.e., to foster cross-\nracial socialization and understanding, the District’s concept\nof racial diversity also suggests other principles which many\nmay find objectionable, especially when taught to children:\n\n    While a public law preference does express a certain\n    kind of compassion for and commitment to the pre-\n    ferred groups, other signals dominate its message -\n    among them, that American society thinks it just to\n    group people by race and ethnicity, to treat those\n    groups monolithically, and to allocate precious\n    resources and opportunities accordingly; that it holds\n    equal treatment and individual merit as secondary,\n    dispensable ideals; that the preferred groups cannot\n    succeed without special public favors; that such\n    favors do not stigmatize them in the minds of fair-\n    minded others; that those who oppose preferences\n    thereby oppose the aspirations of the preferred\n    groups; and that society can assuage old injustices by\n    creating new ones. When public law says such\n    things, it speaks falsely, holds out vain promises, and\n    brings itself into disrepute.\n\nId. at 87-88.\n\n   The District’s asserted interest may be supported by noble\ngoals. But the stereotypes on which it is based, and the risks\nthat it presents, make that interest far from compelling.\n\n                                C.\n\n   The sociological evidence presented by the District, relied\nupon strongly by the majority, does not change my view. The\nmajority discusses much of the evidence that supports the\nDistrict’s position that racially balanced schools foster cross-\nracial socialization and understanding in school and later in\nthe students’ lives. Majority op. at 14675-76. Yet the majority\n\f           PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.        14733\nputs aside the other evidence suggesting there is no definitive\nagreement as to the beneficial effects of racial balance in K-\n12 schools, that the benefits attributed to racially balanced\nschools are often weak, and that any benefits do not always\nhave a direct correlation to racial balance. Yet again, a private\ncitizen is free to accept one body of opinion and reject another\nin deciding to send his child to a particular school. Is the state\nsimilarly privileged when required to determine that its\nclaimed goal is a “compelling interest”? One would think that\nto be “compelling” there would be no room for doubt of the\nneed for the measure. That is certainly not the case here.\n\n   For example, a source provided by the District states that\n“family background has a significantly stronger effect on stu-\ndent achievement than any other single school factor or con-\nstellation of school factors, including school racial and ethnic\ncomposition.” [SER 182.] Another source presented by the\nDistrict states that court-ordered desegregation (i.e., a court-\nordered breakup of a de jure segregated student body)\nresulted in only minimal benefits:\n\n    [R]esearch suggests that desegregation has had some\n    positive effect on the reading skills of African Amer-\n    ican youngsters. The effect is not large, nor does it\n    occur in all situations, but a modest measurable\n    effect does seem apparent. Such is not the case with\n    mathematical skills, which seem generally unaf-\n    fected by desegregation. Second, there is some evi-\n    dence that desegregation may help to break what can\n    be thought of as a generational cycle of segregation\n    and racial isolation. Although research on this topic\n    is scant and often marred by unavoidable flaws, evi-\n    dence has begun to accumulate that desegregation\n    may favorably influence such adult outcomes as col-\n    lege graduation, income, and employment patterns.\n    The measured effects are often weak . . . .\n\n[SER 205, 207-208.]\n\f14734        PARENTS INVOLVED v.

Indeed, there are\nmore studies showing harmful effects than studies showing positive\neffects. This led to another and more recent reviewer of the race relations\nliterature to conclude, somewhat generously: “ ‘In general, the reviews of\ndesegregation and intergroup relations were unable to come to any conclu-\nsion about what the probable effects of desegregation were. . . . Virtually\nall of the reviewers determined that few, if any, firm conclusions about the\nimpact of desegregation on intergroup relations could be drawn. The\nreluctance of reviewers to draw conclusions about the benefits of school\ndesegregation for race relations or self-esteem only reinforces our conclu-\nsion that the psychological harm theory of de facto segregation and the\nsocial benefit theory of desegregation are clearly wrong, at least when\napplied to desegregation as a racial balance policy.’ ”).\n\f           PARENTS INVOLVED v.

Other studies sug-\ngest that where racial classifications are a means of achieving\nracial balance, academic achievement by minorities is hin-\ndered, and racial tensions are riled:\n\n    In a culture that ardently affirms the principles of\n    individual freedom, merit, and equality of opportu-\n    nity, [the] demoralization and anger [precipitated by\n    being victim to government-imposed racial classifi-\n    cations] must be counted as a very large social cost.\n    It is no less a cost because it is borne by whites, and\n    often less privileged whites at that. If these princi-\n    ples make it unfair to impose this cost, the fact that\n    the unfairness is spread across a large group of peo-\n    ple may not make it any more palatable. In fact, dif-\n    fusing the unfairness in this way will simply increase\n    the number of people who feel themselves\n    aggrieved.\n\nSchuck, supra, at 69.\n\n   But despite the inconsistencies in the sociological evidence\nand the vivid risks of the District’s asserted interest, the\nmajority implicitly defers to the District’s position. Grutter\ntook a similar approach, emphasizing that its endorsement of\nthe “diversity” interest relied in large part upon deference to\nthe educational judgment of the Michigan Law School. 539\nU.S. at 330.\n\n  Yet perhaps to steal a line from the majority, the “context”\nhere is different. We are not faced with a university’s “aca-\ndemic freedom,” which arises from “a constitutional dimen-\n\f14736      PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\nsion, grounded in the First Amendment, of educational\nautonomy,” and which includes the freedom to select its stu-\ndent body. Id. We instead consider a public high school’s\nadmissions plan which admits or excludes students from par-\nticular schools solely on the basis of their race. For several\nreasons, we should not defer to such a plan.\n\n   First, other than for race-conscious university admissions\nbased on holistic diversity, deference to a government actor\nis inconsistent with strict scrutiny. See Johnson, 125 S. Ct. at\n1146 n.1 (stating generally that “deference [by the courts in\napplying strict scrutiny] is fundamentally at odds with our\nequal protection jurisprudence”); id. at 1150 (stating the\nSupreme Court has “refused to defer to state officials’ judg-\nments on race . . . where those officials traditionally exercise\nsubstantial discretion.”). In Grutter, the Court deferred to the\nMichigan Law School’s “diversity” interest because of the\nlaw school’s “academic freedom”—grounded in the First\nAmendment and including the law school’s freedom to select\nits own student body—and the law school’s asserted need for\ndiversity to achieve a “robust exchange of ideas” within its\nclassrooms, a vital part of the law school’s mission. 539 U.S.\nat 330.\n\n   None of those same issues are implicated here. The “aca-\ndemic freedom” of a university allows it “to determine for\nitself on academic grounds who may teach, what may be\ntaught, how it shall be taught, and who may be admitted to\nstudy.” Bakke, 438 U.S. at 312 (Powell, J.). High schools do\nnot have such similar freedoms. They cannot determine who\nmay teach, at least when that determination is based upon\nracial grounds. See Wygant, 476 U.S. at 274-76. They also\ncannot determine who may be admitted to study; when the\ngovernment chooses to provide public education in secondary\nschools, it “must be made available to all on equal terms.” See\nPlyler v.

Moreover, the educational bene-\nfits from diversity, if any, are much greater at the higher edu-\ncational level because such benefits are greatly magnified by\nthe learning that takes place outside the classroom—in dormi-\ntories, social settings, and extracurricular activities—as stu-\ndents must learn to live and work with persons of other races\nand ethnic backgrounds.”) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n   Moreover, there is a crucial difference between the “robust\nexchange of ideas” theory referenced in Grutter and the Dis-\ntrict’s claim that its interest “brings different viewpoints and\nexperiences to classroom discussions and thereby enhances\nthe educational process.” [ER 237.] The District applies the\nracial tiebreaker only to entering ninth-grade students. [ER\n253, 308.] It is self-evident that classroom discussion plays a\nsignificantly more vital role in universities with their typical\ndialectic or Socratic teaching method, than in ninth-grade\nhigh school courses with their typical didactic or rote teaching\nmethod.\n\n   Last, the District’s claim that its asserted interest helps to\nfoster cross-racial socialization and understanding later in the\nstudents’ lives is a sociological judgment outside the expertise\nof the District’s educators. Those external benefits are diffuse,\n\f14738        PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\nmanifest long after students leave the classroom, and cannot\nbe measured with skills possessed uniquely by educators.\nUnlike Grutter, which deferred to the Law School on the\nbasis that diversity in the classroom was vital to its educa-\ntional mission during the three-year law school curriculum,\nhere, the District’s asserted interest depends upon benefits\nonly loosely linked to the District’s educational mission and\nto take effect years after its schooling of the children, or\nentirely outside the expertise of its educators. Here, high\nschool administrators and teachers are predicting what sociol-\nogists will find years later.\n\n   Strict scrutiny cannot remain strict if we defer to judgments\nnot even within the particular expertise or observation of the\nparty being scrutinized.

To do this as an educational policy is within the broad discretion-\nary powers of school authorities; absent a finding of a constitutional viola-\ntion, however, that would not be within the authority of a federal court.”\nId. at 16; see also North Carolina State Bd. of Educ. v.

Swann\nconsidered the remedies available to a federal court to combat past de jure\nsegregation. The Court never considered whether a school district could\nuse racial classifications to achieve racial balance absent de jure segrega-\ntion. Indeed, the Court stated: “We are concerned in these cases with the\nelimination of the discrimination inherent in the dual school systems, not\nwith myriad factors of human existence which can cause discrimination in\na multitude of ways on racial, religious, or ethnic grounds. . . . Our objec-\n\f             PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.                 14739\n   In the absence of deference to the District’s sociological\nevidence, the faults of the District’s asserted interest come\ninto sharper focus. It has none of the saving graces present in\nthe Grutter holistic diversity interest. It perpetuates racial ste-\nreotypes and risks fomenting racial hostility. Last, the District\nenforces the interest through government compulsion in the\nstarkest black and white terms, espousing the principle that\nrace trumps the individual.\n\n   The sociological evidence presented by the District sug-\ngests that some benefits will accrue from racial balancing. To\nme, evidence of some benefits does not satisfy the District’s\nburden of proving a compelling governmental interest, espe-\ncially in light of the Supreme Court’s frequent pronounce-\nments that racial balancing itself is unconstitutional. Thus,\nviewed under the lens of strict scrutiny, and without the defer-\nence invoked in Grutter, the District’s interest is simply not\na compelling governmental interest. Hence, I would hold that\nthe District’s operation of the racial tiebreaker is an impermis-\nsible racial classification and violates the Equal Protection\nClause.\n\ntive in dealing with the issues presented by these cases is to see that school\nauthorities exclude no pupil of a racial minority from any school, directly\nor indirectly, on account of race; it does not and cannot embrace all the\nproblems of racial prejudice, even when those problems contribute to dis-\nproportionate racial concentrations in some schools.” Id. at 22-23\n(emphasis added).\n   Swann was also decided decades before the Court resolved the issue of\nthe level of scrutiny to apply to “benign” racial classifications, vis-a-vis\n“invidious” racial classifications. Thus, Swann’s dictum cannot shelter the\nDistrict’s use of the racial tiebreaker from the searching inquiry required\nby strict scrutiny.\n   The majority similarly errs in relying on Washington v. Seattle Sch.\nDist. No. 1, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110784\"><a href=\"/opinion/110784/washington-v-seattle-school-dist-no-1/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">457</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1982).

SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\n                              IV.\n\n   Even if the District’s asserted interest were a compelling\ngovernmental interest, the means used by the District must\nstill be narrowly tailored to serve that interest. See Grutter,\n539 U.S. at 333. For argument’s sake, I here assume, without\nconceding, the District has asserted a valid compelling gov-\nernmental interest in using racial balancing to achieve “the\neducational and social benefits of racial . . . diversity” within\nits high schools and to avoid “racially concentrated” schools.\nYet even under that assumption, the District’s use of the racial\ntiebreaker is not narrowly tailored to serve that interest.\n\n   The majority notes that Grutter set forth “five hallmarks of\na narrowly tailored affirmative action plan: (1) individualized\nconsideration of applicants; (2) the absence of quotas; (3)\nserious, good-faith consideration of race-neutral alternatives\nto the affirmative action program; (4) that no member of any\nracial group was unduly harmed; and (5) that the program had\na sunset provision or some other end point.” Majority op. at\n14684-85. I agree with that general formulation. Yet the\nmajority’s application of those factors again evinces an\nimproper deference to the District; such deference is ill suited\nfor the searching inquiry needed under the narrow-tailoring\nprong of strict scrutiny. See Johnson, 125 S. Ct. at 1146 n.1.\nI consider below whether the District’s use of the racial tie-\nbreaker is narrowly tailored to its asserted interest, and con-\nclude that racial tiebreaker is not narrowly tailored.\n\n                               A.\n\n   The first narrow-tailoring factor requires the District to\nengage in an individualized consideration of each applicant’s\ncharacteristics and qualifications. See Grutter, 539 U.S. at\n337. The importance of this factor is self-evident; individual-\nized consideration serves the primary purpose of the Equal\nProtection Clause, which protects the individual from group\nclassifications, especially those by race. See id. at 326.\n\f             PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.         14741\n   Yet the majority concludes that individualized consider-\nation of each applicant is irrelevant here “because of the con-\ntextual differences between institutions of higher learning and\npublic high schools.” Majority op. at 14685. I could not dis-\nagree more.18 By removing consideration of the individual\nfrom the narrow tailoring analysis, the majority threatens to\nread the Equal Protection Clause out of the Constitution. It is\nthe very nature of equal protection to require individualized\nconsideration when the government uses racial classifications:\n“the Fourteenth Amendment “protects persons, not groups.”\nGrutter, 539 U.S. at 326 (quoting Adarand, 515 U.S. at 227)\n(emphasis in original). Grutter emphasized the importance of\nthe individualized consideration of each applicant: in the con-\ntext of a race-conscious university admissions program, such\nconsideration\n\n       must remain flexible enough to ensure that each\n       applicant is evaluated as an individual and not in a\n       way that makes an applicant’s race or ethnicity the\n       defining feature of his or her application. The impor-\n       tance of this individualized consideration in the con-\n       text of a race-conscious admissions program is\n       paramount.\n\nId. at 337 (emphasis added). The differences between univer-\nsity and secondary education do not justify denial of individu-\nalized equal protection of the law to secondary school\nstudents.\n\n   Individualized consideration of an applicant does not\nrequire an admissions program to be oblivious to race; the\nprogram may consider race, but in doing so, it must remain\n“flexible enough to consider all pertinent elements of diver-\nsity in light of the particular qualifications of each applicant,\nand to place them on the same footing for consideration,\n  18\n    See supra pp. 14670-71 n.12 (explaining why the talismanic use of\n“context” can not alter the fact of racial discrimination).\n\f14742      PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\nalthough not necessarily according them the same weight.” Id.\nat 334. There can be “no policy, either de jure or de facto, of\nautomatic acceptance or rejection based on any single ‘soft’\nvariable . . . [such as the awarding of] mechanical, predeter-\nmined diversity ‘bonuses’ based on race or ethnicity.” Id. at\n337.\n\n   Here, the racial tiebreaker works to admit or exclude high\nschool students from certain oversubscribed schools solely on\nthe basis of their skin color. No other consideration affects the\noperation of the racial tiebreaker; when it operates, it operates\nto admit or exclude either a white or nonwhite student,\ndepending upon how the admission will affect the preferred\nbalance at the oversubscribed school. Such a program is pre-\ncisely what Grutter warned against, and what Gratz held\nunconstitutional: a mechanical, predetermined policy “of\nautomatic acceptance or rejection based on a[ ] single ‘soft’\nvariable,” that being the student’s skin color. See id.\n\n   The racial tiebreaker’s overbroad classification of students\nas “white” or “nonwhite” also runs counter to the required\nindividualized consideration of each applicant. The District\ndoes not even consider the student’s actual race. Instead, the\nDistrict presumably places all Caucasian students into the\n“white” category, and then places all African-American,\nLatino, Asian-American, Pacific Islander and Native Ameri-\ncans into the “nonwhite” category. This puts aside the catego-\nrization of any individuals whose skin color does not correlate\ndirectly with the classifications. Although parents and stu-\ndents may identify their particular group on the registration\nmaterials, if they do not, the District will make the racial iden-\ntification itself through visual inspection of the parent or stu-\ndent. Thus, a fair-skinned minority may wind up in the\n“white” category, or a darker-skinned Caucasian may wind up\nin the “nonwhite” category.\n\n  Courts have often recognized that the inclusion of all\nminorities within a “nonwhite” classification suggests the\n\f           PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.        14743\noperation of a racial classification is not narrowly tailored.\nSee Wygant, 476 U.S. at 284 n.13 (noting the “definition of\nminority to include blacks, Orientals, American Indians, and\npersons of Spanish descent further illustrates the undifferenti-\nated nature of the plan”); Monterey Mech. Co., 125 F.3d at\n714 (noting the inclusion of all minority races within a broad\n“minority” category serves as a “red flag[ ] signaling that the\nstatute is not, as the Equal Protection Clause requires, nar-\nrowly tailored”). At the very least, a narrowly tailored pro-\ngram would require an individualized focus which would\nseparate the student according to his or her correct race, rather\nthan as a process of simple pigmental matching.\n\n   The majority concludes, however, that individualized con-\nsideration of each applicant is unnecessary because the Dis-\ntrict does not exclude any student from a public education by\noperation of the racial tiebreaker. The majority reasons that\nbecause all students are entitled to a public education in one\nof the District’s schools, there is no competition in the District\nfor admission to any of those schools, and thus no racial\nstigma could attach when a student is excluded from admis-\nsion to one of the schools on the basis of his race. Majority\nop. at 14685-87.\n\n   Yet the majority offers no explanation why, in the 2000-01\nschool year, 82% of the students selected one of the oversub-\nscribed schools (i.e., the schools subject to the racial tie-\nbreaker) as their first choice, while only 18% picked one of\nthe undersubscribed schools as their first choice. Majority op.\nat 14665-66. Clearly, the students’ and their parents’ “market”\nappraise some of the schools as providing a better education\nthan the others. Even the District’s superintendent confirmed\nthat the students’ parents considered some of the schools to be\nof higher quality. [ER 534.]\n\n   It is common sense that some public schools are better than\nothers. Parents often move into areas offering better school\ndistricts, and ubiquitous research guides compare the quality\n\f14744       PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\nof public schools according to standardized test scores, pro-\ngram offerings, and the sort. It may be that soothing, if self-\ninterested, bureaucratic voices sing a lullaby of equal educa-\ntional quality in the District’s schools. But the facts show that\nparents and children have voted with their feet in choosing\nsome schools rather than others. The verdict of that “market”\nmakes a hash out of such assurances by the District.\n\n   Thus, the District’s operation of the racial tiebreaker in\nreality does limit access to a governmental benefit among cer-\ntain students. The District insulates applicants belonging to\ncertain racial groups from competition for admission to those\nschools perceived to be of higher quality. A narrowly tailored\nrace-conscious admissions program “cannot insulate each cat-\negory of applicants with certain desired [racial] qualifications\nfrom competition with all other applicants.” Grutter, 539 U.S.\nat 334. The racial tiebreaker fails that test.\n\n  Yet the majority insist that because the District seeks to\navoid racially concentrated schools, “the District’s tiebreaker\nmust necessarily focus on the race of its students.” Majority\nop. at 14689. Again, the majority misses the crucial protection\nprovided by the Equal Protection Clause. The District’s\nnarrow-tailoring obligation does not prohibit it from consider-\ning race; it just cannot consider only race. The constitutional\nguarantee of equal protection requires the District to focus\nupon the individual’s whole make up, rather than just a\ngroup’s skin color; this protects each student’s right to equal\nprotection under the law. See Grutter, 539 U.S. at 326.\n\n   The counter-argument, of course, is that administrative\ninconveniences would prohibit the District from examining\neach student’s file for individual characteristics, of which race\nmay be a part. To the contrary, the record shows such an\neffort is certainly feasible.\n\n  First, thirteen- or fourteen-year-old students19 are not so\n  19\n    As noted, the District applies the racial tiebreaker only to entering\nninth-grade students (presumably around thirteen to fourteen years old).\n\f            PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.              14745\nyoung that they have not yet developed unique traits to set\nthemselves apart from other students and add greater diversity\nto the student body. The students’s race is a factor in assess-\ning the student as an individual, but the student may also\nspeak English as a second language, come from a different\nsocioeconomic stratum than other students, have overcome\nadversity, be a talented baseball player, musician, or have par-\nticipated in community service.\n\n   Second, as noted by the majority, in the 2000-01 school\nyear, approximately 3,000 students entered the District’s high\nschools as ninth graders. Ten percent of those students were\nsubject to the racial tiebreaker. Majority op. at 14667. Thus,\nunder an individualized approach, the District would have had\nto examine only three hundred applications to determine who\nto admit to the oversubscribed schools. Instead, the District\ngrouped those three hundred students into white and nonwhite\ncategories and allowed a computer to select their assignment\nbased solely upon their race.20\n\n   Thus, rather than providing an individualized consideration\nof applicants, the District is engaged in a “de jure [policy] of\nautomatic acceptance or rejection based on a[ ] single ‘soft’\nvariable.” See Grutter, 539 U.S. at 337. Such inflexibility\nshows the racial tiebreaker is not “narrowly tailored to any\ngoal, except perhaps outright racial balancing.” See Croson,\n488 U.S. at 507 (plurality).\n\n                                   B.\n\n  The second narrow-tailoring factor prohibits the use of quo-\n  20\n     Three hundred applications seem like only a minor administrative\nchallenge, but the Supreme Court’s admonition bears repeating nonethe-\nless: “[T]he fact that the implementation of a program capable of provid-\ning individualized consideration might present administrative challenges\ndoes not render constitutional an otherwise problematic system.” Grutter,\n539 U.S. at 275.\n\f14746       PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\ntas based upon race. Grutter, 539 U.S. at 334. A quota is\ndefined as “a program in which a certain fixed number or pro-\nportion of opportunities are reserved exclusively for certain\nminority groups. Quotas impose a fixed number or percentage\nwhich must be attained, or which cannot be exceeded.” Id. at\n335 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\n\n   Here, when a District school is oversubscribed and “inte-\ngration positive”—i.e., the white or nonwhite student body of\nthe school deviates by plus or minus 10% or 15% (depending\non the school year)21 of the preferred 40% white/60% non-\nwhite ratio—the District uses the racial tiebreaker to admit\nstudents whose presence will move the overall student body\ncloser to the preferred ratio. Using the 2000-2001 school year\nas an example, the District would employ the racial tiebreaker\nto exclude white students and admit nonwhite students where\nthe white student body population exceeded 50%. The District\nwould also employ the racial tiebreaker to exclude nonwhite\nstudents and admit white students where the nonwhite student\nbody population in a particular school exceeded 70%.\n\n   By its nature, the tiebreaker aims for a rigid, predetermined\nratio of white and nonwhite students, and thus operates to\nreach “a fixed number or percentage.” (emphasis supplied).\nGratz specifically rejected such a plan as not narrowly tai-\nlored. See 539 U.S. at 270 (“[T]he University’s policy, which\nautomatically distributes [20%] . . . of the points needed to\nguarantee admission, to every single ‘underrepresented\nminority’ applicant solely because of race, is not narrowly tai-\nlored . . . .”); id. at 271-72 (“The only consideration that\naccompanies this distribution of points is a factual review of\nan application to determine whether an individual is a mem-\nber of one of these minority groups.”).\n  21\n    In 2000-01, the District used a 10% deviation trigger, but increased\nthe trigger to 15% for the 2001-02 school year.\n\f             PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.                 14747\n   Yet the majority argues no quota exists here because the\nracial tiebreaker “does not set aside a fixed number of slots\nfor nonwhite or white students,” nor is the 10 or 15% variance\nalways satisfied (generally because there are insufficient num-\nbers of white or nonwhite students needed to balance the\nschool). Majority op. at 14692.22 With respect, the majority\nmisses the point. A quota does not become less of a quota\nbecause there are an insufficient number of whites or non-\nwhites to fill the preselected spots. The District created a\nquota when it established the predetermined, preferred ratio of\nwhite and nonwhite students. In Bakke, the medical school\nargued that it did not operate a quota in its admissions system\nbecause it did not always fill the preselected seats; thus, its\nadmissions system only had a “goal.” Justice Powell rejected\nthat argument, stating that regardless of whether the preselec-\nted seats were a “quota” or a “goal,” such a\n\n       semantic distinction is beside the point: The special\n       admissions program is undeniably a classification\n       based on race and ethnic background. To the extent\n       that there existed a pool of at least minimally quali-\n       fied minority applicants to fill the 16 special admis-\n       sions seats, white applicants could compete only for\n       84 seats in the entering class, rather than the 100\n       open to minority applicants. Whether this limitation\n       is described as a quota or a goal, it is a line drawn\n       on the basis of race and ethnic status.\n  22\n     Although the majority concludes a quota does not exist here, it also\nconcludes “the rationale underlying the . . . prohibition of quotas does not\napply” here. Majority op. at 14691 n.27. The majority reasons that because\nthere is no competition in assignment to the District’s schools, the dangers\npresented by a quota—i.e., insulating applicants from competition on the\nbasis of race—are absent here. Majority op. at 14691 n.27. But saying it\ndoes not make it so, whether it is said by the District or by the majority.\nAs explained above, there is clearly a “market” for higher quality schools\nin the District, and there is competition for the schools the parents and stu-\ndents view to be the better schools.\n\f14748      PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\nBakke, 438 U.S. at 289 (Powell, J.).\n\n   The majority makes a further attempt to avoid Grutter’s\nadmonition against quotas by attempting to classify the Dis-\ntrict’s predetermined ratio as a “critical mass.” The District’s\npreferred ratio could not be further from the definition of a\n“critical mass.” Grutter recognized that a “critical mass” had\nno quantified definition; instead, it was generally referred to\nas “meaningful numbers” or “meaningful representation” of\nminorities. 539 U.S. at 318. The Court expressly stated that a\n“critical mass” was not a means “simply to assure within its\nstudent body some specified percentage of a particular group\nmerely because of its race or ethnic origin.” Id. at 329 (inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted).\n\n   But unlike the unquantified “critical mass” from Grutter,\nthe District’s preferred ratio is firmly set at 40% white, 60%\nnonwhite. When the 15% deviation trigger is used with the\nracial tiebreaker, the District seeks to enroll between 75% and\n45% nonwhite students and 25% to 55% of white students.\nThe District’s admissions plan clearly seeks to assure a speci-\nfied percentage of white or nonwhite students in its schools;\nrather than seeking a “critical mass,” the District instead seeks\nracial balance. Thus, the District’s operation of the racial tie-\nbreaker fails this factor as well.\n\n                               C.\n\n  The third narrow-tailoring factor requires the District to\nhave engaged in a “serious, good-faith consideration of work-\nable race-neutral alternatives.” See id. at 339. The majority\nconcludes the District made such an effort. Majority op. at\n14698. For several reasons, I disagree.\n\n   First, the District’s superintendent flatly admitted the Dis-\ntrict did not engage in a serious, good-faith consideration of\nrace-neutral alternatives. When asked whether the District\n“g[a]ve any serious consideration to the adoption of a plan for\n\f             PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.                14749\nthe assignment of high school students that did not use racial\nbalancing as a factor or goal,” the District’s superintendent\nstated: “I think the general answer to that question is no . . .\nI don’t remember a significant body of work being done. I\nmean it’s possible informally ideas were floated here or there,\nbut I don’t remember any significant staff work being done.”\n[ER 521.]\n\n   The record supports this concession. The District never\nasked its demographer to conduct any analysis regarding the\neffect of using a race-neutral lottery. [ER 483.] The District\nalso never asked its demographer to conduct any analysis\nregarding a diversity program with non-racial indicia such as\na student’s eligibility for free lunch or the students’s socio-\neconomic background.23 [ER 481-82.]\n   23\n      The majority makes the conclusory statement that the District’s\n“white/nonwhite distinction is narrowly tailored to prioritize movement of\nstudents from the north of the city to the south of the city and vice versa”\nas an effort to combat Seattle’s racially imbalanced residential patterns.\nMajority op. at 14697-98. Yet the District’s attempt to balance students\nfrom north Seattle and south Seattle strongly suggests a less-restrictive,\nrace-neutral approach to achieve such balancing: socioeconomic balanc-\ning. As the majority notes, the northern Seattle area contains a majority of\n“white” students and is “historically more affluent.” Majority op. at\n14660. This would mean the southern Seattle area is less affluent. Thus,\nmoving more affluent students south, and less affluent students north,\ncould possibly provide a more diverse student body. At the very least, seri-\nous consideration would have been warranted into this race-neutral alter-\nnative. See Levine, supra, at 536 (noting the key element to successfully\nintegrating students of different backgrounds and race is not racial bal-\nance, but “economic integration”).\n  Yet the majority accepts the District’s rejection of the use of socioeco-\nnomic factors, reasoning that “[a]lthough there was no formal study of the\nproposal by District staff, Board members’ testimony revealed two legiti-\nmate reasons” for rejecting the socioeconomic alternative: (1) “it is insult-\ning to minorities and often inaccurate to assume that poverty correlates\nwith minority status;” and (2) students would be reluctant to reveal their\nsocioeconomic status to their peers. Majority op. at 14699-700. Such anal-\nysis seems far from the “serious, good-faith consideration of workable\n\f14750        PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\n   Also, in 2000, the Urban League of Metropolitan Seattle\npresented a high school assignment plan to the District. The\nplan proposed that each neighborhood region in Seattle would\nhave a designated high school. Students would still be able to\napply to any high school in Seattle, but when oversubscription\noccurred, students living in the designated “reference area”\nwould first be assigned to their regional high school ahead of\nthose who did not. To avoid racial concentration in the\nschools, the plan proposed “merit-based academic, avoca-\ntional and vocational magnet programs.” These programs\n“will help each school address racial diversity issues by\nencouraging students to travel outside of their communities to\nparticipate in a specific magnet program.”24\n\nrace-neutral alternatives” demanded by Grutter. See 539 U.S. at 339. First,\nwithout formal studies (or indeed any earnest consideration of the alterna-\ntives), we have no way of knowing whether the District actually seriously\nconsidered, and rejected for valid reasons, less-restrictive race-neutral\nalternatives. In Croson, the Court emphasized the importance of a satisfac-\ntory record to determine whether race-neutral alternatives were consid-\nered. See Croson, 488 U.S. at 498-511 (plurality) (detailing the\ngovernment actor’s failure to document the basis for its use of a racial\nquota and stressing the need to do so). Second, the majority’s insistence\nthat the District’s consideration of poverty would be “insulting” ignores\nthe demeaning—and indeed, constitutionally objectionable—effect of\nplacing persons into groups solely by their skin color for the purpose of\nreceiving or being denied a governmental benefit. See Loving v. Virginia,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107480\"><a href=\"/opinion/107480/loving-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">388</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 11 (1967) (“[T]his Court has consistently repudiated distinc-\ntions between citizens solely because of their ancestry as being odious to\na free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equali-\nty.”). Even if a sole focus on poverty might be insulting to some minori-\nties, socioeconomic considerations need not inquire only into poverty\nstatus; eligibility for free lunch, the parents’ levels of education, or\nwhether English is a second language for the child are also relevant deter-\nminations in evaluating diversity. Third, there is no reason students would\nhave to reveal their socioeconomic status to their peers; the District could,\nof course, keep such information confidential.\n   24\n      Similar race-neutral alternatives are common throughout the United\nStates. For example, the San Francisco, California public school district\nemploys a program focused on enhancing diversity in the classrooms. The\n\f             PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.                14751\n   Despite the majority’s assertion, the record suggests the\nDistrict did not seriously consider this plan. The District did\nnot ask its demographer to conduct any analysis as to the\neffect or workability of the plan [ER 504]; one District board\nmember stated the District “didn’t deal with” the plan [ER\n514]; another board member stated the District didn’t consider\nthe plan [ER 643]; and last, another board member stated he\nrefused to read the proposal because he would “rather play\nwith my bass lunker fishing game.” [ER 573.]\n\n   Of course, “[n]arrow tailoring does not require exhaustion\nof every conceivable race-neutral alternative,” Grutter, 539\nU.S. at 339, but it does require an earnest, good-faith consid-\neration of the alternatives. Here, the District made no such\nattempt, and thus the District’s use of the racial tiebreaker\nfails this narrow-tailoring factor.25\n\nprogram allows students to choose any school within the district. When a\nschool is oversubscribed, the program first assigns students with siblings\nto the same school, and then accommodates students with specialized\nlearning needs. After that, the “Diversity Index” handles further assign-\nments. “Under the Diversity Index process, the school district calculates\na numerical profile of all student applicants. The current Diversity Index\nis composed of six binary factors: socioeconomic status, academic\nachievement status, mother’s educational background, language status,\nacademic performance index, and home language.” David I. Levine, Pub-\nlic School Assignment Methods after Grutter and Gratz: The View from\nSan Francisco, 30 Hastings Const. L.Q. 511, 528-31 (2003). Notably, the\nSan Francisco system “does not use race as an express criterion for school\nassignments” and thus avoids the sharp focus of strict scrutiny. Id. at 531.\n   25\n      In assessing whether the District seriously considered race-neutral\nalternatives, the majority applies deference to the District’s consideration\n(or lack thereof) and rejection of the various alternatives. Majority op. at\n14698-99 n.33. With respect, the majority errs in two respects. First, as\npreviously noted, deference to local officials’ use of race is generally\nbarred in the application of strict scrutiny. See Johnson, 125 S. Ct. at 1146\nn.1. Second, if the majority is attempting to apply the deference invoked\nin Grutter, the Court there applied deference in determining whether the\nLaw School asserted a compelling governmental interest, not whether the\n\f14752        PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\n                                     D.\n\n   The fourth narrow-tailoring factor requires that the Dis-\ntrict’s use of the racial tiebreaker “must not unduly burden\nindividuals who are not members of the favored racial and\nethnic groups.” See Grutter, 539 U.S. at 341. The majority\nadjusts this test slightly to consider “any racial group,” rather\nthan just members of the disfavored group. Majority op. at\n14684. Because the racial tiebreaker disadvantages both white\nand nonwhite children, I agree that the modification is valid.\nBut unlike the majority, I conclude the District’s operation of\nthe racial tiebreaker fails this factor as well.\n\n   The racial tiebreaker unduly burdens thirteen- and fourteen-\nyear-old school children by (1) depriving them of their choice\nof school, and (2) imposing on them tedious cross-town com-\nmutes, solely upon the basis of their race.\n\n   First, as recognized above, the “good” schools in Seattle\nare a limited government benefit. Thus, the racial tiebreaker\nburdens white or nonwhite students, and often deprives them\nof the opportunity to enroll at what are considered the better\nschools, solely on the basis of race.\n\n  Second, the children of plaintiff members Jill Kurfurst and\nWinnie Bachwitz were denied admission to Ballard High\nSchool based on their race and instead were forced to attend\nIngraham, a school on the other side of Seattle from their\nhome. To attend that school, the two white students faced a\n\nmeans used to achieve that interest were narrowly tailored. See 539 U.S.\nat 328 (“The Law School’s educational judgment that such diversity is\nessential to its educational mission is one to which we defer.”).\n   The pattern now established by the majority seems suspicious. Out of\nfive narrow-tailoring factors, the majority has concluded two are inappli-\ncable, and now a third is entitled to deference. I find it difficult to under-\nstand how such analysis could truly be considered strict scrutiny as to the\nnarrowing requirement.\n\f          PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.       14753\ndaily multi-bus round-trip commute of over four hours. The\nparents instead enrolled their children in private schools.\nThose children were not only deprived of the school of their\nchoice, they were effectively denied a public education\n(surely at much lower cost than private tuition), based on\nnothing but their race.\n\n   A look at the operation of the tiebreaker provides further\nevidence of the injury the District inflicts on both white and\nnonwhite students. As noted by the majority, in the 2000-01\nschool year, 89 more white students were assigned to Franklin\nthan would have occurred absent the tiebreaker; 107 more\nnonwhite students were admitted to Ballard; 82 more non-\nwhite students were admitted to Roosevelt; and Twenty-seven\nmore nonwhite students were admitted to Nathan Hale.\nMajority op. at 14667. To place the racial tiebreaker into\nproper perspective, in the 2000-01 school year, 89 nonwhite,\nminority students were denied admission to Franklin, and had\nto attend what to them was a less desirable school, solely\nbecause of their skin color. One hundred-seven white students\nwere denied admission to Ballard, and had to attend what to\nthem was a less desirable school, solely because of their skin\ncolor. Eighty-two white students were denied admission to\nRoosevelt, and had to attend what to them was a less desirable\nschool, solely because of their skin color. Twenty-seven white\nstudents were denied admission to Nathan Hale, and had to\nattend what to them was a less desirable school, solely\nbecause of their skin color.\n\n   Yet the majority discounts the burdens imposed by the\nracial tiebreaker, concluding that (1) the “minimal burden” of\nthe tiebreaker is shared equally among white and nonwhite\nstudents; (2) no student is entitled to attend any specific\nschool in any event; and (3) the tiebreaker does not uniformly\nbenefit one race over the other because the tiebreaker operates\nagainst both whites and nonwhites. Majority op. at 14706-07.\nRegarding the first point, the U.S. Supreme Court has long\nrejected the notion that a racial classification which burdens\n\f14754      PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\nraces equally is any less objectionable under the Equal Protec-\ntion Clause. In Loving v. Virginia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107480\"><a href=\"/opinion/107480/loving-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">388</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1967), the U.S.\nSupreme Court held a Virginia statute criminalizing interra-\ncial marriages was unconstitutional under the Equal Protec-\ntion Clause. Id. at 12. The Court rejected the state’s argument\nthat the miscegenation statute did not discriminate on the\nbasis of race because it “punish[ed] equally both the white\nand the Negro participants in an interracial marriage.” Id. at\n8. The Court reasoned: “In the case at bar . . . we deal with\nstatutes containing racial classifications, and the fact of equal\napplication does not immunize the statute from the very heavy\nburden of justification which the Fourteenth Amendment has\ntraditionally required of state statutes drawn according to\nrace.” Id. at 9. Hence, it is irrelevant whether the racial tie-\nbreaker disadvantages both races equally.\n\n   Second, I think I have already disposed of the majority’s\nargument that no student is entitled to attend any specific Dis-\ntrict school. The students and parents clearly value some of\nthe District’s schools above the others, and limiting access to\nthose higher quality schools on the basis of race is just the\nsame as any other preferential racial classification.\n\n   Third, I agree the tiebreaker does not uniformly benefit one\nrace over the other and can exclude both white and nonwhite\nstudents from the preferred schools. Yet that does not lessen\nthe injury of being subject to a racial classification. Equal pro-\ntection is an individual right, and whenever the District tells\none student, whether white or nonwhite, he or she cannot\nattend a particular school on the basis of race, that action\nworks an injury of constitutional proportion. See Adarand,\n515 U.S. at 230 (“[A]ny individual suffers an injury when he\nor she is disadvantaged by the government because of his or\nher race, whatever that race may be.”); Monterey Mech. Co.,\n125 F.3d at 712 (“Race discrimination is never a ‘trifle.’ ”).\n\n   The District’s use of the racial tiebreaker thus unduly bur-\ndens members of the disfavored class, and the tiebreaker fails\nthis narrow-tailoring factor as well.\n\f           PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.        14755\n                               E.\n\n   The fifth and final narrow-tailoring factor requires the Dis-\ntrict’s use of the racial tiebreaker to “be limited in time,” and\n“have a logical end point.” See Grutter, 539 U.S. at 342. A\nworkable “sunset” provision within any government-operated\nracial classification is vital:\n\n    [A] core purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment was\n    to do away with all governmentally imposed dis-\n    crimination based on race. . . . The requirement that\n    all race-conscious admissions programs have a ter-\n    mination point assures all citizens that the deviation\n    from the norm of equal treatment of all racial and\n    ethnic groups is a temporary matter, a measure taken\n    in the service of the goal of equality itself.\n\nId. at 341-42 (internal quotation marks and alterations omit-\nted).\n\n   Citing Grutter, the majority contends the racial tiebreaker\nsatisfies this factor because “this durational requirement can\nbe met by periodic reviews to determine whether racial pref-\nerences are still necessary to achieve student body diversity,”\nand the District engages in such periodic reviews. Majority\nop. at 14706. Yet citing Grutter in full shows that “the dura-\ntional requirement can be met by sunset provisions in race-\nconscious admissions policies and periodic reviews to deter-\nmine whether racial preferences are still necessary to achieve\nstudent body diversity.” 539 U.S. at 342 (emphasis added).\nPeriodic reviews are not enough; there must be some “dura-\ntional requirement,” some “logical end point,” to the racial\nclassifications.\n\n   The District argued the end point is in the “thermostat” to\nthe tiebreaker, in which the District ceases to use the racial\ntiebreaker at any school for the year once its use had brought\nthe school into racial balance. Yet it is undisputed that the\n\f14756       PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\nDistrict has never been segregated by law; the racial imbal-\nance in its schools results from Seattle’s racially imbalanced\nhousing patterns. If Seattle’s children were simply assigned to\nthe high schools nearest their homes, those schools suppos-\nedly would tend to reflect such imbalance.\n\n   Because there is no reason—much less evidence—to con-\nclude Seattle’s housing patterns will change, or that the Dis-\ntrict’s student assignment program will affect such patterns, I\nmust respectfully disagree that such a provision satisfies the\n“sunset provision” requirement enunciated in Grutter. Pre-\nsumably, where the District employs the racial tiebreaker, the\nschools will become racially balanced, that is 40% white,\n60% nonwhite (plus or minus a few percentage points,\ndepending on the particular percentage deviation triggering\nthe tiebreaker that year). Pursuant to the “thermostat,” the\nDistrict would then stop using the racial tiebreaker. But\nbecause Seattle’s residential makeup is racially imbalanced26\n(and remains so despite the use of the racial tiebreaker),\nassignment to the oversubscribed schools would then occur\nonly with use of (1) the sibling tiebreaker; and (2) the distance\ntiebreaker. Assuming that not every student also has a sibling\nattending one of the District’s schools, the schools will inevi-\ntably become racially imbalanced again because of the\nracially imbalanced residential makeup, thus rendering the\nthermostat useless as a “sunset provision.”\n\n   One could argue, then, that this result supports the need for\nuse of the racial tiebreaker. Not necessarily so. If the racial\nimbalance in the schools is caused not by the students, but by\nthe choices of the parents as to where to live, then why not\nput the onus of remedying that imbalance on the parents\nrather than the students? Seattle’s city council could create\n  26\n    About 70% of the residents of Seattle, Washington are white, and 30%\nof the residents are nonwhite. Sixty-six percent of white students live in\nthe northern part of Seattle, while 75% of nonwhite students live in the\nsouthern part of Seattle.\n\f          PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.       14757\n“incentives” for whites to move into nonwhite areas, and for\nnonwhites to move into white areas. And if incentives do not\naccomplish the task, well, why not use compulsion, as the\nDistrict does to high school children? The city council could\ntake measures to prevent new persons taking up residence in\nSeattle from living in areas where their presence might other-\nwise alter the sought-after racial balance. This would protect\nthe racial balance within the schools and squarely put the bur-\nden of remedying the racial imbalance upon the parents,\nrather than the students.\n\n   Of course, less political resistance can be expected from\nchoosing students for social engineering experiments in racial\nbalancing, than in telling everyone—including voters—into\nwhich neighborhood they can move. Further, regulation of\nresidence by race might run afoul of Shelley v. Kraemer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104545\"><a href=\"/opinion/104545/shelley-v-kraemer/\"><span class=\"volume\">334</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1948), although it is difficult to distinguish why the\n“compelling interest” of socialization among the races could\nnot as easily be pressed in housing regulation as it is in\nschooling regulation.\n\n  The simple truth is that some people choose to live near\nmembers of their own ethnic or racial group.\n\n    There is no denying that American blacks often live\n    in their own residential enclaves, especially in our\n    big cities. But the same is true of whites and of every\n    other racial and ethnic group—Jews, Chinese, Cam-\n    bodians, Cubans, Arabs. Such racial and ethnic clus-\n    tering means that a third of non-Asian minorities\n    attend schools that are less than 10-percent white.\n    And even though whites constitute just over 60 per-\n    cent of the nation’s schoolchildren, the average\n    white student goes to a school that is 80-percent\n    white.\n\n       But why should we expect identical proportions of\n    blacks and whites to live in each and every neighbor-\n\f14758        PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\n       hood? People like to live near others with whom\n       they identify, and the schools mirror their choices.\n       When asked about their residential preferences, only\n       about 5 percent of blacks said they wished to live on\n       an entirely or almost entirely white block. The vast\n       majority preferred neighborhoods that were half or\n       more than half African-American—in other words,\n       neighborhoods in which the black concentration was\n       “disproportionately” high. According to the 2000\n       census, this happens to correspond closely to the\n       actual distribution of black city-dwellers.\n\n          In a complex, heterogenous society, it is only nat-\n       ural that people should sort themselves out in urban\n       space along lines of race as well as of religion and\n       social class. This pattern was firmly established in\n       the U.S. by the European immigrants who landed in\n       the cities of the North in the 19th and early 20th cen-\n       turies. The sociologists who studied these settle-\n       ments recognized the important social functions\n       served by “Little Italies” and “Poletowns.\n\nAbigail Thernstrom27 & Stephan Thernstrom, Have We Over-\ncome?, Commentary, Nov. 2004, at 51-52.28\n\n   Of course, the continuing racial imbalance in some residen-\ntial areas is in significant part a byproduct of past efforts to\n  27\n      Mrs. Thernstrom is presently the Vice Chair of the U.S. Commission\non Civil Rights.\n   28\n      Further evidence that such self-selection results is submitted by this\nyear’s Nobel Laureate, Thomas C. Schelling, by application of game the-\nory in chapter four of his book Micromotives and Macrobehavior (1978).\nSchelling employs an exercise using coins to demonstrate how an inte-\ngrated neighborhood can become largely segregated as long as each resi-\ndent desires at least one third of his or her neighbors to be of his or her\nrace. When one person moves to get a preferred set of neighbors, it causes\na chain reaction which settles down only when the neighborhood is effec-\ntively segregated.\n\f          PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.      14759\nexclude minority groups from predominately white areas. Yet\nas racial tolerance and enforcement of civil rights laws have\nincreased, neighborhoods are becoming more racially bal-\nanced. Id. In 1960, 15% of African-Americans lived in sub-\nurbs. In 2004, 36% live in suburbs. Id. African-Americans\naccount for 9% of the total suburban population, “surprisingly\nclose to proportionality for a group that constitutes only 12\npercent of the American population.” Id. Moreover, from\n1960 to 2000, the proportions of African-Americans living in\ncensus tracts that were over 80% black fell from 47% to under\n30%. Id. During that same period, the proportion residing in\ncensus tracts that were over 50% black fell from 70% to 50%.\nId. Most importantly, this balancing takes place without any\ngovernment coercion, except perhaps by the enforcement of\nfair housing laws which prevent racial discrimination such as\nCalifornia’s Unruh Civil Rights Act, Cal. Civ. Code § 51\n(West 2001).\n\n    No one who understands what makes America great\n    can quarrel with ethnic pride. At home, on the week-\n    end, in the family and the neighborhood, Jews will\n    be Jews, Italians Italian - and there is no reason\n    blacks should be any different. Religion and ethnic-\n    ity are essential parts of our lives, and government\n    should not curtail how we express them in the pri-\n    vate sphere. But when it comes to public life, even\n    the benevolent color coding of recent decades has\n    proved a recipe for alienation and resentment. Soci-\n    ety need not be color-blind or color-less, but the law\n    cannot work unless it is color-neutral, and the gov-\n    ernment should not be in the business of abetting or\n    paying for the cultivation of group identity.\n\nSchuck, supra, at 88 (quoting Tamar Jacoby, Someone Else’s\nHouse: America’s Unfinished Struggle for Integration 541\n(1998)) (internal alteration omitted).\n\n  The racial imbalance in Seattle’s schools results not from\nde jure segregation nor from any invidious exclusion of non-\n\f14760        PARENTS INVOLVED v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.\nwhite minorities from the schools. Instead, it results from\nracially imbalanced residential housing patterns, an issue\nwhich the District does not even contend it can alter. Hence,\nthe method chosen by the District to impose racially balanced\nschools is fatally flawed. Because it does not respond to the\nracial imbalances in Seattle’s residential makeup, and instead\nonly attempts to fix it within the schools, there will be no sun-\nset to the use of the racial tiebreaker. See Grutter, 539 U.S.\nat 343 (“It would be a sad day indeed were America to\nbecome a quota-ridden society, with each identifiable minor-\nity assigned proportional representation in every desirable\nwalk of life. But that is not the rationale for programs of pref-\nerential treatment; the acid test of their justification will be\ntheir efficacy in eliminating the need for any racial or ethnic\npreferences at all.”). Thus, the District’s operation of the\nracial tiebreaker fails this factor as well.\n\n                                    V.\n\n  As pointed out in the majority opinion, other courts have\nconcluded that a school district’s use of a racial tiebreaker in\nsearch of racial balance in the student body passes muster\nunder the Equal Protection Clause.29 I respectfully disagree.\nThe District’s use of the racial tiebreaker to achieve racial bal-\nance in its high schools infringes upon each student’s right to\n   29\n      Cf.

We are not different because of our\nskin color; we are different because each one of us is unique.\nThat uniqueness incorporates our opinions, our background,\nour religion (or lack thereof), our thought, and our color.\nGrutter attempted to strike a balance between the individual\nprotections of equal protection and being conscious of race\neven when looking at the individual. The District’s use of the\nracial tiebreaker, however, attempts no such balance; it\ninstead classifies each ninth-grade student solely by race.\nBecause of that, I must conclude such a program violates the\nEqual Protection Clause.\n\n   The majority’s decision risks unfortunate repercussions. On\nthe short-term, the specter of “white flight” (a recurring issue\nin the aftermath of the elimination of de jure desegregation)\nmanifests itself here. The racial balancing of students will\nrequire busing and long-distance transportation to schools\noutside of some students’ neighborhoods. Parental involve-\nment in those distant schools (such as with the PTA) will\nundoubtedly decrease. Parents who can afford private educa-\ntion (such as those in the more affluent northern part of Seat-\ntle) may very well choose to pull their children from the\nDistrict schools and enroll them elsewhere, much like the\nKurfurst and Bachwitz children. On the long-term, such an\nexodus could result in a decreased tax base and public support\nfor the District schools and may result in the exact opposite\nthe District hopes to achieve—a loss of white students from\ntheir school campuses.\n\n   One of the greatest stains upon the history of our country\nis our struggle with race discrimination.
