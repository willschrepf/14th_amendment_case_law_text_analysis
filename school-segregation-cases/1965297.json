The amendments at issue derive primarily from two&#13;\nseparate, but related, enactments.  The first, House Bill (HB)&#13;\n2003 (2003), Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, is known as the PERS&#13;\nReform and Stabilization Act of 2003 and alters PERS in a variety&#13;\nof respects.  The second, HB 2004 (2003), Oregon Laws 2003,&#13;\nchapter 68, affects the actuarial equivalency factors used to&#13;\ncompute retired PERS members' service retirement&#13;\nallowances.</a><a href=\"#N_1_\"><sup> (1)</sup></a>&#13;\n </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><a name=\"FNT2\"/><a name=\"FNT3\"/><a name=\"FNT4\">We have considered both the factual and legal aspects&#13;\nof the challenges that the petitions present.  Having done so,&#13;\nand for the reasons set out below, we conclude that the&#13;\nprovisions of Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, <i>as amended by</i> Oregon&#13;\nLaws 2003, chapter 625, that eliminate the annual assumed&#13;\nearnings rate credit</a><a href=\"#N_2_\"><sup> (2)</sup></a>&#13;\n to PERS Tier One members'<a href=\"#N_3_\"><sup> (3)</sup></a> regular&#13;\naccounts impair a contractual obligation of the PERS contract in&#13;\nviolation of Article I, section 21, of the Oregon&#13;\nConstitution.<a href=\"#N_4_\"><sup> (4)</sup></a>&#13;\n  We further conclude that the provision&#13;\nof Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, section 10(3), that, in effect,&#13;\ntemporarily suspends annual cost-of-living adjustments to the&#13;\nservice retirement allowances of certain retired Tier One members&#13;\nbreaches an obligation of the PERS contract.  In all other&#13;\nrespects, we conclude that petitioners' challenges to the 2003&#13;\nPERS legislation are not well taken. </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">I.  PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATIONS</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>A. <i>Jurisdiction</i></p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 625, section 17(1), provides:</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<blockquote>&#13;\n<p><a name=\"FNT5\">\"Jurisdiction is conferred on the Supreme Court to&#13;\ndetermine in the manner provided by this section&#13;\nwhether the implementation of actuarial equivalency&#13;\nfactor tables under section 2 or 4, chapter 68, Oregon&#13;\nLaws 2003 (Enrolled House Bill 2004), breaches any&#13;\ncontract between members of the Public Employees&#13;\nRetirement System and their employers, or violates any&#13;\nconstitutional provision, including but not limited to&#13;\nimpairment of contract rights of members of the Public&#13;\nEmployees Retirement System under section 21, Article&#13;\nI, of the Oregon Constitution, or clause 1, section 10,&#13;\nArticle I, of the United States Constitution.\"</a><a href=\"#N_5_\"><sup> (5)</sup></a>&#13;\n</p></blockquote>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 625, section 17a, contains essentially&#13;\nidentical operative wording, except that the grant of&#13;\njurisdiction pertains to determinations \"whether the provisions&#13;\nof chapter 67, Oregon Laws 2003 (Enrolled House Bill 2003)\"&#13;\nbreach any PERS contract or violate any constitutional provision. </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><a name=\"FNT6\">The 2003 PERS legislation contains other jurisdictional&#13;\nand quasi-jurisdictional provisions as well.  We have considered&#13;\nevery statutory jurisdictional prerequisite and, with the three&#13;\nexceptions explained below, have determined that each of the&#13;\npetitioners in each of these consolidated cases is properly&#13;\nbefore this court and that each petition presents a justiciable&#13;\ncontroversy.</a><a href=\"#N_6_\"><sup> (6)</sup></a>&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><a name=\"FNT7\">The first of the three claims that fall short of the&#13;\njurisdictional or justiciability requirements is petitioner&#13;\nDahlin's claim for relief under 42 USC section 1983.</a><a href=\"#N_7_\"><sup> (7)</sup></a>&#13;\n  With&#13;\nrespect to that claim for relief, petitioner Dahlin states that&#13;\nhe \"is advancing no new impairment arguments under Section 1983,&#13;\nbut rather, [is] utilizing that section as a procedural vehicle&#13;\nto raise his United States Constitutional claims * * * [and] as&#13;\none method by which he may recover his costs and attorney fees in&#13;\nthis action.\"  Respondents assert, correctly we conclude, that&#13;\npetitioner Dahlin's section 1983 claim falls outside the&#13;\nlegislature's limited grant of original jurisdiction to this&#13;\ncourt, quoted above.  Contrary to petitioner Dahlin's implicit&#13;\nassertion that the legislation allows multiple avenues for&#13;\npresenting challenges, the only \"procedural vehicle[s]\" that the&#13;\nlegislature has authorized for review of the 2003 PERS&#13;\nlegislation in this court as original matters are the petitions&#13;\nto which that legislation refers.  Those petitions do not include&#13;\nthe federal statutory claim that section 1983 provides.  We&#13;\ntherefore dismiss petitioner Dahlin's section 1983 claim.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The second problematic claim is petitioner Dahlin's&#13;\nchallenge to an aspect of the 2003 PERS legislation that,&#13;\neffectively, temporarily suspends annual cost-of-living&#13;\nadjustments (COLAs) as to certain retired Tier One members.  <i>See</i>&#13;\nOr Laws 2003, ch 67, &#167; 10(3), <i>as amended by</i> Or Laws 2003, ch 625,&#13;\n&#167; 13 (so providing).  Section 10 applies to only members who:</p>&#13;\n<blockquote>&#13;\n<p>\"(a)  Established membership in [PERS] before&#13;\nJanuary 1, 1996, * * *; </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>\"(b)  Receive a service retirement allowance&#13;\ncalculated under ORS 238.300(2)(b)(A); and </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n &#13;\n<p>\"(c)  Have an effective date of retirement that is&#13;\non or after April 1, 2000, and before April 1, 2004.\"</p>&#13;\n</blockquote>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><a name=\"FNT8\">Or Laws 2003, ch 67, &#167; 10(5).</a><a href=\"#N_8_\"><sup> (8)</sup></a>&#13;\n  Petitioner Dahlin, however,&#13;\nis not a retired PERS member, and, as an active Tier One member,&#13;\nthe provisions that he seeks to challenge respecting the COLA&#13;\nsuspension do not apply to him.  On that basis, respondents&#13;\njointly assert that he lacks standing to pursue that particular&#13;\nchallenge.  We agree.  <i>See</i>, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Brumnett v. PSRB</i>, 315 Or 402,&#13;\n405, 848 P2d 1194 (1993) (for party to have standing, court's&#13;\ndecision must have some practical effect on party's rights).  </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Petitioner Dahlin's attempts to avoid the foregoing&#13;\nconclusion are not well taken.  First, he argues that he has&#13;\nbrought his claims as a class action and that \"members of the&#13;\nclass have standing to raise this claim.\"  Regardless of the&#13;\nlegal validity of that assertion, nothing in the pleadings or the&#13;\nrecord supports the proposition that petitioner Dahlin sought to&#13;\nmaintain a class action.  Second, petitioner Dahlin argues that&#13;\nrespondents have waived any objection to his standing.  Standing,&#13;\nhowever, is an aspect of justiciability, <i>McIntire v. Forbes</i>, 322&#13;\nOr 426, 433, 909 P2d 846 (1996), and justiciability is not&#13;\nwaivable, <i>Barcik v. Kubiaczyk</i>, 321 Or 174, 186-87, 895 P2d 765&#13;\n(1995).  Accordingly, we dismiss petitioner Dahlin's petition to&#13;\nthe extent that it seeks to challenge the temporary COLA&#13;\nsuspension.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The third problematic matter concerns claims that&#13;\n<i>Strunk</i> petitioners have advanced -- and in which <i>Burt</i>, <i>Dahlin</i>,&#13;\nand <i>Evans</i> petitioners have joined -- challenging Oregon Laws&#13;\n2003, chapter 67, sections 14b(1)(b) and (2), <i>as amended by</i>&#13;\nOregon Laws 2004, chapter 625, section 31, which provide as&#13;\nfollows:</p>&#13;\n<blockquote>&#13;\n<p>\"(1) If the Public Employees Retirement Board&#13;\n[(PERB)] is required to correct one or more of the&#13;\nerroneous benefit calculation methods identified in&#13;\n<i>City of Eugene et al. v. State of Oregon</i>, Case Nos.&#13;\n99C-12794, 00C-16173, 99C-12838 and 99C-20235, [PERB]&#13;\nshall recover the cost of benefits erroneously paid to&#13;\nretired members as a result of those erroneous benefit&#13;\ncalculations by one or both of the following methods:</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>\"* * * * *</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>\"(b) [PERB] may treat all or part of the present&#13;\nvalue of the benefits erroneously paid and payable to&#13;\nretired members as a result of the erroneous benefit&#13;\ncalculations as an administrative expense of the Public&#13;\nEmployees Retirement System, to be paid exclusively&#13;\nfrom future income of the Public Employees Retirement&#13;\nFund, and to be amortized over an actuarially&#13;\nreasonable period not to exceed 15 years.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>\"(2) In no event may the cost of erroneous benefit&#13;\ncalculation methods identified in <i>City of Eugene et al.&#13;\nv. State of Oregon</i> be considered an employer liability&#13;\nor charged to employers through employer&#13;\ncontributions.\"</p>&#13;\n</blockquote>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>As one of their arguments in response to petitioners' challenges&#13;\nto sections 14b(1)(b) and (2), respondents argue that those&#13;\nchallenges \"are either moot or not yet ripe for adjudication.\" &#13;\nWe agree with the latter contention.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><a name=\"FNT9\">This court long has held that, for a claim to be&#13;\njusticiable, \"[t]he controversy must involve present facts as&#13;\nopposed to a dispute which is based on future events of a&#13;\nhypothetical issue.\"  <i>Brown v. Oregon State Bar</i>, 293 Or 446, 449,&#13;\n648 P2d 1289 (1982); <i>see</i> <i>also</i> <i>State ex rel v. Funk</i>, 105 Or 134,&#13;\n155, 199 P 592, <i>overruled on demurrer</i>, 209 P2d 113 (1922)&#13;\n(\"courts pass upon concrete cases and not abstract propositions&#13;\nof law\").  As the <i>City of Eugene</i> litigation presently stands --&#13;\nand it is that litigation upon which sections 14b(1)(b) and (2)&#13;\nare predicated -- PERB has agreed not to act under those&#13;\nsections.  Whether the status quo will change remains to be&#13;\nseen.</a><a href=\"#N_9_\"><sup> (9)</sup></a>&#13;\n  What is certain is that, at this time, petitioners'&#13;\nchallenge to those sections is premature.  Accordingly, we&#13;\ndismiss the claim as not ripe for adjudication.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>B. <i>De Novo and Plenary Review</i></p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>This court best fulfills its obligation to interpret&#13;\nthe laws of this state after a trial court and the Court of&#13;\nAppeals have had an opportunity to consider and refine the&#13;\nfactual and legal issues.  <i>See</i>, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Western Helicopter Services&#13;\nv. Rogerson Aircraft</i>, 311 Or 361, 370, 811 P2d 627 (1991) (\"Our&#13;\nexperience with cases on direct appeal or in which we are&#13;\nexercising our original jurisdiction has taught us that the&#13;\nissues and arguments in both kinds of cases often are not as well&#13;\ndefined or as focused as are the issues and arguments in cases in&#13;\nwhich discretionary review is sought after the case has filtered&#13;\nthrough the lens of a Court of Appeals decision.\").  Those&#13;\nconsiderations notwithstanding, for these proceedings, the&#13;\nlegislature has directed this court to determine all issues as&#13;\noriginal matters in this court.  To comply with that directive,&#13;\nthis court appointed a special master to conduct the trial of all&#13;\nfactual issues and to assemble the record.  We now conduct a <i>de&#13;\nnovo</i> review of the evidentiary record and a plenary review of the&#13;\nlegal issues presented. </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>C. <i>The Evidentiary Record</i></p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The court appointed now-Chief Judge David Brewer of the&#13;\nOregon Court of Appeals to act as Special Master on the court's&#13;\nbehalf in these proceedings and to hold an evidentiary hearing,&#13;\nrule on prehearing matters, and make recommended findings of&#13;\nfact.  The Special Master completed that assignment in&#13;\ncommendable fashion, and his efforts warrant this court's&#13;\ngrateful acknowledgment.  He guided these cases through a two-week evidentiary hearing, oversaw the creation of a voluminous&#13;\nrecord, and prepared a comprehensive written report, including&#13;\nextensive recommended findings of fact.  That report has gone&#13;\nvirtually unchallenged before this court, and, unless&#13;\nspecifically noted, we have adopted those recommended findings of&#13;\nfact.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Although the parties challenge only a few of the&#13;\nSpecial Master's specific recommended findings of fact, they have&#13;\ndrawn freely from the evidentiary record to advance factual&#13;\nassertions that were not contained in the Special Master's&#13;\nreport.  As appropriate -- that is, when relevant and proved by a&#13;\npreponderance of the evidence -- this court has made independent&#13;\nfindings in response to those factual assertions. </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>D. <i>Motions to Compel Production</i> </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>We address a final preliminary consideration.  &#13;\nPetitioners in two of the proceedings, <i>Strunk</i> and <i>Dahlin</i>, twice&#13;\nmoved the Special Master to compel the production of documents&#13;\nthat they unsuccessfully had sought to obtain in discovery from&#13;\nrespondent Public Employees Retirement Board (PERB).  PERB had&#13;\nwithheld production of those documents on the ground that the&#13;\ndocuments, which related to advice that the Attorney General had&#13;\ngiven to PERB concerning the actuarial equivalency factors used&#13;\nto compute retired members' benefits, constituted privileged&#13;\nlawyer-client communications.  The Special Master refused to&#13;\ncompel production of the documents.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Petitioner Dahlin and <i>Strunk</i> petitioners have assigned&#13;\nthe rulings of the Special Master as error.  We uphold the&#13;\nSpecial Master's refusal to compel the production of the&#13;\ndocuments, because, in our view, the documents are not relevant&#13;\nto any claim at issue in these proceedings.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Having resolved the preliminary considerations that&#13;\nthese matters present, we proceed to an overview of PERS&#13;\ngenerally and of the parties and their claims and defenses.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">II.  BACKGROUND</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><a name=\"FNT10\">A brief summary of the history and operation of PERS,&#13;\nas well as the changes that the 2003 PERS legislation made to the&#13;\nsystem, provide context for the parties' arguments.  As the&#13;\nSpecial Master noted in his report, \"[t]he statutory,&#13;\nadministrative, historical, and operational backgrounds against&#13;\nwhich both the 2003 legislation and the instant claims have&#13;\narisen are exceedingly complex.\"  The summary that follows&#13;\nborrows heavily from the Special Master's written report.  More&#13;\nfully developed discussions about particular aspects of the&#13;\nsystem are set out later as we address the parties' specific&#13;\narguments.</a></p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>A.<i> PERS Before the 2003 Legislation</i><a href=\"#N_10_\"><sup> (10)</sup></a>&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>1. <i>General Considerations</i></p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>In one form or another, Oregon has provided its public&#13;\nemployees with a retirement plan, as a contractual benefit of&#13;\npublic employment, since 1945.  Funding for the system comes from&#13;\nthree sources:  (1) employee member contributions, presently set&#13;\nat six percent of salary; (2) employer contributions, in an&#13;\namount actuarially determined to be necessary when added to the&#13;\nemployee member contributions to cover the cost of accrued and&#13;\nprojected future service retirement allowances payable to retired&#13;\nmembers; and (3) investment earnings on those contributions.  The&#13;\nassets, taken together, constitute the Public Employees&#13;\nRetirement Fund (the fund) and are used to pay the costs of the&#13;\nsystem:  member service retirement allowances and administrative&#13;\nexpenses.  Except for variable account funds, which we discuss&#13;\nbelow, all PERS funds are commingled for investment purposes.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><a name=\"FNT11\"/><a name=\"FNT12\">PERB administers PERS and acts as trustee for the fund. &#13;\nPERB conducts its operations through a director and staff that&#13;\nPERB employs, and PERB administers the system in consultation&#13;\nwith the PERS actuary.</a><a href=\"#N_11_\"><sup> (11)</sup></a>&#13;\n  PERB sets employer contribution&#13;\nrates, adopts actuarial equivalency factors and assumed earnings&#13;\nrates, establishes reserve accounts, and allocates annual&#13;\nearnings to accounts and reserves.  The Oregon Investment Council&#13;\n(OIC) invests the assets of the fund.<a href=\"#N_12_\"><sup> (12)</sup></a>&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>2. <i>Membership in and Funding of PERS</i></p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><a name=\"FNT13\"/><a name=\"FNT14\">Public employees of participating employers become PERS&#13;\nmembers upon completing six months of uninterrupted&#13;\nservice.</a><a href=\"#N_13_\"><sup> (13)</sup></a>&#13;\n  Every PERS member has a regular \"account\" in&#13;\nPERS.  The member's regular account consists of the member's&#13;\ncontributions to the system and earnings that PERB has credited&#13;\nto those contributions.  In addition, in 1967, the legislature&#13;\nenacted an optional variable annuity account program for members&#13;\nwho are willing to have their contributions and benefits&#13;\nfluctuate with the equity markets.  A member who participates in&#13;\nthe variable  annuity account program has two member accounts:  a&#13;\nregular account and a variable account.  Members' contributions&#13;\nto their variable accounts are paid into the Variable Annuity&#13;\nAccount and are invested solely in the Oregon Equity Fund.<a href=\"#N_14_\"><sup> (14)</sup></a>&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>For purposes of this litigation, there are two&#13;\ncategories of PERS members.  \"Tier One\" members are public&#13;\nemployees who joined PERS before January 1, 1996.  Tier One&#13;\nmembers are entitled to a guaranteed minimum rate of return on&#13;\ntheir regular accounts based on the assumed earnings rate.  To&#13;\nensure that sufficient assets exist to pay guaranteed benefits to&#13;\nTier One members at the assumed earnings rate, PERS maintains a&#13;\n\"gain-loss reserve.\"  In years when fund earnings exceed the&#13;\nassumed earnings rate, PERB deposits a portion of those excess&#13;\nearnings into the gain-loss reserve.  In years when fund earnings&#13;\nare less than the assumed earnings rate, PERB uses funds from the&#13;\nreserve to make up the difference.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><a name=\"FNT15\">PERS members who joined the system on or after January&#13;\n1, 1996, are known as \"Tier Two\" members.  Unlike Tier One&#13;\nmembers, Tier Two members have no earnings guarantee on their&#13;\nregular accounts and, correspondingly, do not benefit from the&#13;\nfund's gain-loss reserve.</a><a href=\"#N_15_\"><sup> (15)</sup></a>&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><a name=\"FNT16\">Crediting of member accounts occurs annually as of&#13;\nDecember 31 of each calender year.  At the beginning of each&#13;\ncalendar year, PERB reviews changes in the value of the fund&#13;\nsince the beginning of the previous year.  PERB staff determines&#13;\nthe fund's value using standard accounting methods.  Based on the&#13;\nfund's annual growth, PERB allocates earnings to various accounts&#13;\nwithin the fund on an \"equal crediting\" basis; that is, every&#13;\ndollar within the fund receives the same percentage share of&#13;\nearnings regardless of the account to which that dollar is&#13;\ndesignated.</a><a href=\"#N_16_\"><sup> (16)</sup></a>&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><a name=\"FNT17\">The PERS actuary also recommends the adoption of&#13;\nemployer contribution rates in an \"Actuarial Valuation\" that&#13;\nusually issues as of December 31 in odd-numbered years. &#13;\nEmployers begin paying newly established contribution rates on&#13;\nJuly 1 of the following year.  Employer contribution rates&#13;\nconsist of two components:  the employer's normal cost toward&#13;\npayment of members' service retirement allowances and the amount&#13;\nnecessary to amortize any unfunded actuarial liability (UAL). &#13;\nThe normal cost component of the employer contribution rate is&#13;\nbased on the PERS actuary's best estimate of the amount needed to&#13;\npay service retirement allowances to current members in the&#13;\nfuture.  The adjustment of the employer contribution rate either&#13;\nfor UAL or actuarial surplus is based on the difference between&#13;\nan employer's account balance and the projected future service&#13;\nretirement allowances payable to its employee members.  If an&#13;\nactuarial surplus exists, then the employer pays less than the&#13;\nnormal cost rate.  If the employer has a UAL, then PERB adds an&#13;\nadditional, amortized charge to the employer's normal cost&#13;\nrate.</a><a href=\"#N_17_\"><sup> (17)</sup></a>&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>3.<i> Service Retirement Allowance Formulas</i></p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>There are three formulas available for calculating a&#13;\nPERS member's service retirement allowance, commonly known as the&#13;\nPension Plus Annuity, the Full Formula, and the Money Match.  The&#13;\nPension Plus Annuity, which is available to only members who&#13;\ncontributed to PERS before August 21, 1981, consists of the sum&#13;\nof an annuity component and a pension component.  The annuity&#13;\ncomponent is composed of the actuarial equivalent of the member's&#13;\naccount balances at retirement.  The pension component, funded by&#13;\nthe employer, is equal to one percent of the member's final&#13;\naverage salary (1.35 percent for legislators and police and fire&#13;\nemployees) for each service year.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The Full Formula also includes an annuity component&#13;\ncomposed of the actuarial equivalent of the member's account&#13;\nbalances at retirement and a pension component; however, the&#13;\npension component is calculated differently than under the&#13;\nPension Plus Annuity.  The Full Formula first calculates a&#13;\nmember's service retirement allowance by multiplying the member's&#13;\nfinal average salary by a factor set at 1.67 percent (two percent&#13;\nfor legislators, police officers, and firefighters) and then&#13;\nmultiplying the resulting figure by the member's years of&#13;\nmembership.  That service retirement allowance then is funded&#13;\nusing the actuarial equivalent of the member's account balances&#13;\nat retirement (the annuity component) and employer contributions&#13;\nrequired to make up the difference (the pension component).</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Under the Money Match, a member's service retirement&#13;\nallowance is calculated by determining the sum of the actuarial&#13;\nequivalent of the member's account balances at retirement (the&#13;\nannuity component) and then adding a sum in an equal amount that&#13;\nis charged to the employer, <i>i.e.</i>, the \"match\" (the pension&#13;\ncomponent).  The resulting service retirement allowance therefore&#13;\namounts to twice the actuarial equivalent of the member's account&#13;\nbalances at retirement.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><a name=\"FNT18\"/><a name=\"FNT19\">At retirement, a PERS member receives a service&#13;\nretirement allowance based on the formula that produces the&#13;\nhighest pension amount among the foregoing three alternative&#13;\nformulas.</a><a href=\"#N_18_\"><sup> (18)</sup></a>&#13;\n  By the late 1980s, members who retired with 30&#13;\nyears of creditable service received a service retirement&#13;\nallowance equal to approximately 63 percent of their final&#13;\naverage salary.  By the early 1990s, that figure had increased to&#13;\n66 percent and, between 1996 and 2002, increased to 85 percent. &#13;\nIn 2000, the average PERS retired member with 30 years of&#13;\ncreditable service retired at the age of 53 with a service&#13;\nretirement allowance equal to 106 percent of the member's final&#13;\naverage salary.<a href=\"#N_19_\"><sup> (19)</sup></a>&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Regardless of the formula used to determine a retired&#13;\nmember's service retirement allowance, PERS historically has&#13;\nincreased such allowance through annual cost-of-living&#13;\nadjustments (COLAs).  Such COLAs are based on the Consumer Price&#13;\nIndex and are capped at two percent of each member's allowance. &#13;\nIf the index increases by more than two percent for the year,&#13;\nthen the increase above two percent is \"banked\" and may be added&#13;\nto the member's COLA in later years when the index increases by&#13;\nless than two percent.  </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Finally, in addition to the benefits described above,&#13;\nmembers who retired before 1991 receive an increase in benefits&#13;\nto remedy unlawful taxation on retirement income benefits&#13;\nattributable to service before 1991.  <i>See generally</i> <i>Hughes v.&#13;\nState of Oregon</i>, 314 Or 1, 838 P2d 1018 (1992) (legislature's&#13;\nrepeal of income tax exemption statute as to PERS members'&#13;\nretirement benefits constituted breach of PERS contract,&#13;\nrequiring legislatively created remedy).</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>When a PERS member retires, PERB transfers the member's&#13;\naccount balances to the Benefits-In-Force reserve account (BIF),&#13;\ntogether with an amount from the employer's accumulated&#13;\ncontributions.  The amount transferred from the employer's&#13;\naccount is that which PERB has determined is necessary to pay the&#13;\nmember's service retirement allowance.  PERB also regularly&#13;\n\"trues up\" the BIF by recalculating the funds necessary to pay&#13;\nall expected service retirement allowances for retired members. &#13;\nIf PERB's actuary determines that the BIF is insufficient to pay&#13;\nthose allowances, then PERB deducts from all employer accounts&#13;\nthe amounts necessary to eliminate the deficiency.  Conversely,&#13;\nif the BIF is overfunded, then PERB adds the overage to all&#13;\nemployer accounts.  For accounting purposes, PERB does not make&#13;\nadjustments to individual employer accounts; instead, PERB&#13;\nmaintains a balancing account that shows the actuary's \"trueing&#13;\nup\" calculations.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>4. <i>Recent Fiscal Status of the Fund</i></p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The fiscal status of the fund following poor investment&#13;\nperformances in 2000, 2001, and 2002 -- together with significant&#13;\ngrowth in fund liabilities and employer contribution rates -- was&#13;\nthe primary motivator of the 2003 PERS legislation.  <i>See</i>&#13;\n<i>generally</i> Or Laws 2003, ch 67 (preamble).  Those considerations&#13;\nprovided much of the focus of the parties' advocacy before the&#13;\nSpecial Master and this court.  As context for the issues that we&#13;\nresolve in these cases, we set out the following brief discussion&#13;\nof the fund's financial status, which we take from the Special&#13;\nMaster's report:</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<blockquote>&#13;\n<p>\"For the 2001-03 biennium, the [S]tate of Oregon's&#13;\ngeneral fund and lottery budget was approximately $11&#13;\nbillion.  Oregon's local governments will collect&#13;\napproximately $17.8 billion in own-source revenues in&#13;\nfiscal year 2003-04.  In comparison, at the end of&#13;\n2002, the fund had a total UAL of more than $15 billion&#13;\n[based on the fair market value of fund assets].  In&#13;\nJanuary 2003, the UAL reached $16.41 billion.  During&#13;\nthe 2003 legislative session, the UAL exceeded $17&#13;\nbillion, but it had declined to $12.7 billion by July&#13;\n2003. </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>\"Between 1991 and 2000, the nation experienced the&#13;\nlongest sustained period of economic growth in its&#13;\nhistory.  During that time, the average investment&#13;\nreturn on the fund was approximately 15 percent per&#13;\nyear.  However, over that same period, the system's&#13;\nfunded ratio, which compares the value of fund assets&#13;\nto projected liabilities, declined.  In 1991, the&#13;\nfund's value equaled the amount of its projected future&#13;\nliabilities.  By 2001, the value of the fund's assets&#13;\nequaled 89 percent of its projected future liabilities.&#13;\nIn 2002, based on then-current actuarial assumptions,&#13;\nthe PERS actuary projected that PERS liabilities would&#13;\nincrease from approximately $45 billion in 2001 to&#13;\napproximately $65 billion by 2007.  In 2002, the&#13;\nactuary also projected that the funded ratio would&#13;\nremain below 80 percent until 2010 and that the funded&#13;\nratio probably would not equal 100 percent until 2027. &#13;\nIn early 2003, that ratio declined to 65.4 percent.\" </p>&#13;\n</blockquote>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>(Footnote omitted.)</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>B. <i>The 2003 PERS Legislation</i></p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><a name=\"FNT20\"/><a name=\"FNT21\">The following summary addresses only those changes to&#13;\nthe system following the 2003 PERS legislation that petitioners&#13;\nhave challenged in this litigation.</a><a href=\"#N_20_\"><sup> (20)</sup></a>&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>1. <i>Member Accounts</i></p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>As noted, before the 2003 PERS legislation, all active&#13;\nPERS members contributed, either directly or by employer pick-up,<a href=\"#N_21_\"><sup> (21)</sup></a>&#13;\n six percent of their salaries to their regular&#13;\naccounts.  Earnings on those contributions also were credited to&#13;\nthose  accounts.  Under the 2003 PERS legislation, all member&#13;\ncontributions made after January 1, 2004, are placed into an&#13;\n\"account\" for each member under a new Individual Account Program&#13;\n(IAP) instead of being credited to PERS regular accounts.  The&#13;\nbalances held in members' IAP accounts will not be annually&#13;\ncredited at not less than the assumed earnings rate and, at&#13;\nretirement, will not be subject to employer matching under the&#13;\nMoney Match or be enhanced by annual COLAs.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>2.  <i>Investment in the Variable Annuity Account Program</i> </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Under the 2003 PERS legislation, as of December 31,&#13;\n2003, members no longer may contribute to the variable annuity&#13;\naccount program.  The legislation does not affect contributions&#13;\ncredited to members' variable accounts before that date.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>3. <i>The \"Call\"</i></p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>As explained earlier, the legislature has required PERB&#13;\nto create a reserve account, known as the \"gain-loss\" reserve, to&#13;\noffset any deficit created in years in which fund earnings fell&#13;\nbelow the assumed earnings rate.  By statute, PERB could not&#13;\nmaintain that reserve account in a deficit position for more than&#13;\nfive years.  PERB's process for eliminating such a deficit has&#13;\nbeen referred to as the \"call.\"  There never has been a five-year&#13;\ndeficit in the reserve account, and, accordingly, PERB never has&#13;\nimplemented the call.  The 2003 PERS legislation eliminates the&#13;\nstatutory provisions respecting the call.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>4. <i>The Assumed Earnings Rate and Crediting of Accounts</i></p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><a name=\"FNT22\">As noted, before the 2003 PERS legislation, the PERS&#13;\nstatutes guaranteed all Tier One members that PERB would credit&#13;\nearnings on their regular accounts annually at a rate no less&#13;\nthan the assumed earnings rate.  The 2003 PERS legislation,&#13;\nhowever, prohibits the allocation of earnings to Tier One&#13;\nmembers' regular accounts in any year in which a deficit exists&#13;\nin the gain-loss reserve or the allocation of earnings would&#13;\ncause a deficit in the gain-loss reserve.</a><a href=\"#N_22_\"><sup> (22)</sup></a>&#13;\n  The amendment&#13;\ndoes not apply to members who retired before April 1, 2004.  For&#13;\nTier One members who retire on or after that date, the amount in&#13;\ntheir regular accounts at retirement cannot be less than the&#13;\namount that those accounts would have reflected if PERB had&#13;\ncredited those accounts with earnings at the assumed earnings&#13;\nrate for every year that the accounts existed.  If a member's&#13;\nregular account balance is deficient in that respect, then PERS&#13;\nis required to pay the difference out of the gain-loss reserve.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>5. <i>Cost-of-Living Adjustments</i></p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><a name=\"FNT23\">As noted, retired PERS members are entitled to annual&#13;\nCOLAs on their service retirement allowances not to exceed two&#13;\npercent per year.  Under the 2003 PERS legislation, PERS must&#13;\ncalculate two alternative service retirement allowances for&#13;\ncertain members who retired on or after April 1, 2000, and before&#13;\nApril 1, 2004 -- a \"revised\" service retirement allowance and a&#13;\n\"fixed\" service retirement allowance.  The \"revised\" service&#13;\nretirement allowance calculates the amount that the member would&#13;\nhave received if PERB had credited all members' regular accounts&#13;\nwith 11.33 percent interest in 1999 -- instead of the 20 percent&#13;\ninterest that PERB actually credited to members' regular accounts&#13;\nfor that year.</a><a href=\"#N_23_\"><sup> (23)</sup></a>&#13;\n  The \"fixed\" service retirement allowance&#13;\nessentially \"fixes\" each member's allowance as of July 1, 2003,&#13;\nor the effective date of the member's retirement (whichever is&#13;\nlater), but then is not subject to an annual COLA.  The&#13;\nlegislation further provides that each member in the identified&#13;\ngroup shall receive the \"greater\" of the \"revised\" and \"fixed\"&#13;\nservice retirement allowances.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>6. <i>Actuarial Equivalency Factors</i></p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><a name=\"FNT24\">Under an administrative rule that PERB adopted in 1993,&#13;\nand later amended in 1996, PERB declared that it would not&#13;\nreduce, by application of new actuarial equivalency factors&#13;\n(AEFs),</a><a href=\"#N_24_\"><sup> (24)</sup></a>&#13;\n the service retirement allowances of PERS members&#13;\nwho joined the system before 1999.  That declaration&#13;\nnotwithstanding, the 2003 PERS legislation directs the&#13;\nimplementation of updated AEFs beginning July 1, 2003, and&#13;\nthereby modifies the AEF calculation for certain members who&#13;\nentered the system before 1999.  Members who retired on or before&#13;\nJune 30, 1993 -- one day before the effective date of the new&#13;\nlegislation -- receive service retirement allowances calculated&#13;\nusing the AEFs in place before the legislative reforms.  All&#13;\nother members who joined the system before 1999 and who retired&#13;\nor will retire on or after July 1, 2003, will receive service&#13;\nretirement allowances that are subject to the new legislation. &#13;\nThose allowances are determined using one of two calculations,&#13;\nwhichever produces the greater benefit.  The first requires that&#13;\nthe AEFs in effect at a member's effective retirement date be&#13;\napplied to the member's account balance.  The second creates an&#13;\naccount balance as of June 30, 2003, that consists only of the&#13;\nmember's contributions and earnings credited as of that date. &#13;\nBased on that account balance, PERB determines the member's&#13;\nservice retirement allowance using the AEFs in effect on June 30,&#13;\n2003. </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>C. <i>The Parties and Their Claims</i></p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The following is an overview of the parties and their&#13;\nprimary contentions, taken from the Special Master's report:</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<blockquote>&#13;\n<p>\"Petitioners are current and former public&#13;\nemployees who are [Tier One] members of PERS. * * *&#13;\nPetitioners have named as [respondents] the State of&#13;\nOregon and certain state agencies (the state), [PERB],&#13;\nand various other public employers (the nonstate&#13;\n[respondents]).  Petitioners each assert [under state&#13;\nlaw] that the 2003 legislation impairs a statutory&#13;\ncontract between petitioners and their public employers&#13;\n* * *, breaches the statutory PERS contract, and takes&#13;\ntheir property without just compensation * * *.  Some&#13;\nof the petitioners also assert contract impairment and&#13;\ntakings claims under the United States Constitution. &#13;\nPetitioners seek to have many of the provisions of the&#13;\n2003 legislation declared unconstitutional and to&#13;\nenjoin their implementation.  </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>\"Petitioners in the <i>Strunk</i>, <i>Burt</i>, and <i>Evans</i> cases&#13;\nrely, for the sources of their claims, on the PERS&#13;\nstatutes that existed before the enactment of the 2003&#13;\nlegislation and certain PERB administrative rules in&#13;\neffect before the legislation's enactment.  Petitioners&#13;\nin the <i>Dahlin</i>, * * * <i>Sartain</i>, and <i>Whitty</i> cases also&#13;\nrely on those provisions and, in addition, assert that&#13;\nthe PERS contract consists of other terms, including&#13;\nprovisions of employee handbooks, oral representations,&#13;\nor documents that PERS officials have provided to them&#13;\nover the years.  Those petitioners' claims allege&#13;\nbreaches and impairments of contract and takings based&#13;\non those additional purported terms.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>\"The state has raised several defenses to&#13;\npetitioners' claims.  It asserts that (1) the statutory&#13;\nprovisions and other materials on which petitioners&#13;\nrely are not part of the obligation of any contract to&#13;\nwhich they are parties; (2) any impairment of the&#13;\nobligation of petitioners' PERS contracts is&#13;\ninsubstantial or nonexistent; (3) any impairment is&#13;\njustified by important public purposes; and (4)&#13;\npetitioners have no property interest that the 2003&#13;\nlegislation affects. * * * </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>\"Nonstate [respondents] present a somewhat&#13;\ndifferent array of defenses.  Like the state, they&#13;\nfirst assert that many of the provisions that&#13;\npetitioners seek to enforce are not <i>statutory&#13;\n</i>contractual promises.  They also contend that the 2003&#13;\nlegislation did not breach or impair those provisions&#13;\nthat constitute statutory contractual promises because&#13;\nit did not change substantially the substance of those&#13;\npromises and, in any event, none of the affected&#13;\nprovisions was beyond the reach of the legislature's&#13;\npower of amendment or repeal.

DISCUSSION</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>A. <i>General Summary of Case Law and Legal Principles</i></p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>To the extent that it provides background for some of&#13;\nthe discussion that follows, we briefly summarize this court's&#13;\ndecisions in <i>Eckles v. State of Oregon</i>, 306 Or 380, 760 P2d 846&#13;\n(1988), <i>Hughes</i>, 314 Or 1, and <i>Oregon State Police Officers' Assn.&#13;\nv. State of Oregon</i>, 323 Or 356, 918 P2d 765 (1996) (\"<i>OSPOA</i>\"),&#13;\nwhich the parties cite to support many of their competing&#13;\ncontentions in these proceedings.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><a name=\"FNT25\"><i>Eckles</i> involved legislation that had transferred&#13;\nsurplus funds from the Industrial Accident Fund (IAF) to the&#13;\nGeneral Fund for the purpose of avoiding a state budget deficit. &#13;\nThe plaintiff, an employer insured by the State Accident&#13;\nInsurance Fund Corporation (SAIF), contended that the legislation&#13;\nviolated Article I, section 21, of the Oregon Constitution by&#13;\nimpairing the state's contractual obligation (set out in an&#13;\nearlier statute) to use the funds in the IAF for only workers'&#13;\ncompensation purposes.  This court concluded that the part of the&#13;\nlegislation that eliminated the state's obligation to use the&#13;\nsurplus funds in the manner specified in the earlier statute&#13;\nconstituted an unconstitutional impairment of the state's&#13;\ncontractual obligation.  306 Or at 399.  The court further&#13;\nconcluded that the part of the legislation that directed the&#13;\ntransfer of funds amounted to a mandate that the state breach the&#13;\ncontract, <i>id.</i> at 400, which ordinarily would require payment of&#13;\ndamages to SAIF employers resulting from the breach, <i>id.</i> at&#13;\n402.</a><a href=\"#N_25_\"><sup> (25)</sup></a>&#13;\n  <i/></p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><i>Hughes</i> involved legislation that had repealed a state&#13;\nincome tax exemption for PERS benefits; specifically, the&#13;\nlegislation had (1) made that exemption inapplicable to state&#13;\npersonal income taxation; and (2) repealed the corresponding&#13;\nprovision in the tax statutes.  The plaintiffs, who were present&#13;\nand retired public employees, challenged the legislation under&#13;\nArticle I, section 21, and this court ultimately held that the&#13;\ntwo statutory provisions, respectively, unconstitutionally&#13;\nimpaired a contractual obligation and breached the PERS contract. &#13;\n314 Or at 29-33.  Most significant to our analysis here, the&#13;\ncourt in <i>Hughes</i> concluded that \"PERS was intended to be and is a&#13;\ncontract between the state and its employees[.]\"  314 Or at 25.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><i>OSPOA</i> involved challenges to Ballot Measure 8 (1994),&#13;\nwhich had amended the Oregon Constitution in three ways relating&#13;\nto PERS:  (1) by mandating that public employees make six percent&#13;\ncontributions to public retirement plans, if so covered, and,&#13;\ncorrespondingly, by precluding public employers from \"picking up\"&#13;\nthat contribution on behalf of their employee members; (2) by&#13;\nprohibiting the state from guaranteeing a rate of return on&#13;\nretirement contributions; and (3) by prohibiting any increase of&#13;\nretirement benefits based on unused sick leave.  The plaintiffs&#13;\nbrought federal impairment of contract challenges to the&#13;\namendments, and, after applying state law principles to construe&#13;\nthe underlying PERS contract, this court invalidated the&#13;\namendments as unconstitutional impairments of that contract.  In&#13;\nreaching that conclusion, the court concluded that each of the &#13;\nstatutory PERS provisions at issue -- that is, the provisions&#13;\npermitting employer \"pick-up\" of the employee's contribution,&#13;\nguaranteeing an assumed earnings rate, and providing for&#13;\ninclusion of unused sick leave in benefit calculations --&#13;\nconstituted terms of the PERS contract that applied even to work&#13;\nyet to be performed.  323 Or at 372-79.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>We note some considerations from <i>Eckles</i> and <i>Hughes</i> that&#13;\nguide our analysis in these cases.  First, in <i>Eckles</i>, this court&#13;\nclarified that the contracts provision of Article I, section 21,&#13;\nprohibited the impairment of a contractual <i>obligation</i>.  <i>Eckles</i>,&#13;\n306 Or at 395.  As to the determination whether newer legislation&#13;\namounts to an impairment of a preexisting statutory contractual&#13;\nobligation, the court focused on whether the legislation would&#13;\nchange or eliminate the state's obligation under that contract. &#13;\n<i>Id.</i> at 399-400.  By contrast, the court explained that&#13;\nlegislation that mandated a breach on the state's part of such a&#13;\ncontractual obligation -&#8211; but did not change or eliminate the&#13;\nobligation itself &#8211;- did not <i>contravene</i> Article I, section 21,&#13;\nalthough, in accordance with that constitutional provision, such&#13;\nlegislation ordinarily would require payment of damages resulting&#13;\nfrom the breach.  <i>Id.</i> at 400-02.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>In <i>Hughes</i>, this court set out a two-step process for&#13;\naddressing a claim of contract impairment or breach under Article&#13;\nI, section 21:</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<blockquote>&#13;\n<p>\"First, it must be determined whether a contract&#13;\nexists to which the person asserting an impairment is a&#13;\nparty; and, second, it must be determined whether a law&#13;\nof this state has impaired an obligation of that&#13;\ncontract.  General principles of contract law normally&#13;\nwill govern both inquiries, even where the state is&#13;\nalleged to be a party to the contract at issue.\"</p>&#13;\n</blockquote>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><i>Hughes</i>, 314 Or at 14.  In its ensuing analysis, the court divided&#13;\nthe first question into three component inquiries:  (1) is there&#13;\na state contract?; (2) if so, what are its terms?; and (3) what&#13;\nobligations do the terms provide?  <i>See id.</i> at 17-29 (engaging in&#13;\nthose inquiries).  Further, as noted above, this court in <i>Hughes</i>&#13;\nconcluded that PERS constituted a statutory contract.  <i>Id.</i> at 25.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>B.  <i>Obligation of Successive Legislatures</i></p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>We underscore that the claims presented here, for the&#13;\nmost part, concern contract formation and implicate what this&#13;\ncourt has described as the \"significant\" proposition that, if&#13;\ncertain circumstances are met, \"one legislature may bind a&#13;\nsucceeding legislature to a particular course of action.\"  <i>Id.</i> at&#13;\n13.  That proposition is significant, in part, because&#13;\n\"[o]rdinarily it is the function of a legislature to make laws&#13;\nand not contracts.\"  <i>Campbell et al. v. Aldrich et al.</i>, 159 Or&#13;\n208, 213, 79 P2d 257 (1938).  However, as the court in <i>Campbell</i>&#13;\nwent on to state:</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<blockquote>&#13;\n<p>\"[L]egislative enactments may contain provisions which,&#13;\nwhen accepted as the basis of action byindividuals,&#13;\nbecome contracts between them and the state.  It is&#13;\nalso equally well established that the intention of the&#13;\nLegislature thus to create contractual obligations,&#13;\nresulting in extinguishment to a certain extent of&#13;\ngovernmental powers, must clearly and unmistakably&#13;\nappear.  The intention to surrender or suspend&#13;\nlegislative control over matters vitally affecting the&#13;\npublic welfarecannot be established by mere&#13;\nimplication.\"<i/></p>&#13;\n</blockquote>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 213-14.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>C.  <i>Order of Analysis</i></p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>As a final preliminary matter, we note that&#13;\npetitioners' arguments arise under and implicate various sources&#13;\nof state and federal law.  When, as here, we are presented with&#13;\nmultiple bases for disposition, this court generally considers&#13;\nthe issues hierarchically.  <i>See</i>, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>State v. Kennedy</i>, 295 Or&#13;\n260, 262, 666 P2d 1316 (1983) (so stating; addressing defendant's&#13;\nstate constitutional law claim before considering his federal&#13;\nclaim). Accordingly, we begin by addressing petitioners' claims&#13;\nunder state law.  </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>D.  <i>Petitioners' State Law Contractual Claims</i></p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><a name=\"FNT26\">As noted above, <i>Strunk</i>, <i>Burt</i>, and <i>Evans</i> petitioners&#13;\nrely solely upon the PERS statutes and certain administrative&#13;\nrules as they existed before the 2003 PERS legislation as the&#13;\nbases for their contractual claims -- that is, their claims that&#13;\nthe 2003 legislation either impairs or breaches obligations set&#13;\nout in the PERS contract.  <i>Dahlin</i> and <i>Whitty</i> petitioners,&#13;\nhowever, cast a broader net.  They argue that, in addition to&#13;\nstatutory and administrative rule provisions, the PERS contract&#13;\nincludes documents that PERB has provided to them over the&#13;\nyears.</a><a href=\"#N_26_\"><sup> (26)</sup></a>&#13;\n  <i>Whitty</i> petitioners, moreover, also rely on the&#13;\nemployee handbook that they received from their employer as&#13;\nestablishing some of their contractual rights.  Finally, <i>Strunk</i>&#13;\nand <i>Burt</i> petitioners also assert that the 2003 PERS legislation&#13;\nbreaches not only the PERS contract but also the settlement&#13;\nagreement resolving litigation that followed this court's&#13;\ndecision in <i>Hughes</i>.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>1.  <i>Handbooks and Other Materials as Contract Terms</i></p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>a.  <i>Whitty</i> Petitioners</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><i>Whitty</i> petitioners are each employees of SAIF, and they&#13;\nnamed PERB and SAIF as respondents to their petition for review. &#13;\n<i>Whitty</i> petitioners' opening brief asserts, in part:</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<blockquote>&#13;\n<p>\"In addition to the [a]rguments stated by the&#13;\n<i>Strunk</i> Petitioners, the <i>Whitty</i> petition[ers] are&#13;\nrelying upon the Respondent SAIF Corporation's written&#13;\npolicy concerning retirement, stated in the SAIF&#13;\nEmployee Handbook, as part of their contract with their&#13;\nemployer. * * *</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>\"The SAIF policy also refers the employee to the&#13;\nPERS Handbook, 'for complete details of the retirement&#13;\nprogram.' * * * </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>\"* * * * *</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>\"The language used by SAIF Corporation in its&#13;\nretirement policy statement, words such as&#13;\n'established,' 'secure' and 'guarantees,' is language&#13;\nof contract. * * *\"</p>&#13;\n</blockquote>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>In response, respondents argue that (1) the PERS&#13;\nstatutes do not reflect a legislative intent to delegate either&#13;\nto PERB or to SAIF the power to bind future legislatures; (2)&#13;\neven if the legislature had purported to delegate that power, the&#13;\ndelegation would be an unconstitutional abdication of the&#13;\nlegislature's lawmaking authority; (3) even if such a delegation&#13;\nwere permissible, there is no evidence that the legislature&#13;\nintended to delegate such authority to PERB staff or SAIF, as&#13;\nopposed to PERB; and (4) at least insofar as the SAIF employee&#13;\nmanual is concerned, it promises nothing more than the ability of&#13;\nits employees to participate in PERS like all other state&#13;\nemployees.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>In reply, <i>Whitty</i> petitioners argue, in part, as&#13;\nfollows:</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<blockquote>&#13;\n<p>\"Respondents argue that the SAIF policy on&#13;\nretirement and the PERS Handbook are not part of&#13;\nPetitioners' contract because the language of the PERS&#13;\nstatutes does not reflect an intent to delegate the&#13;\npower to bind future legislatures to an administrative&#13;\nagency.  The language of the PERS statutes also does&#13;\nnot delegate to SAIF Corporation, or any other&#13;\ngovernmental agency the power to enter into any&#13;\ncontract with its employees.  Yet, this court has held&#13;\nthat a Multnomah County Ordinance is a sufficient basis&#13;\nfor a retirement benefit contract.  <i>Taylor v. Multn[.]&#13;\n* * * Dept[.] Sher[.] Ret[.] B[d.]</i>, 265 Or 445, 451,&#13;\n510 P2d 339 (1973). * * * If a county can contract with&#13;\nits employees through enactment of an ordinance&#13;\nestablishing a retirement benefit, certainly an&#13;\nindependent public corporation, SAIF, can contract with&#13;\nemployees through adoption of a policy conferring&#13;\nretirement benefits. * * *</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>\"* * * * *</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><a name=\"FNT27\">\"As to whether the PERS Handbook is a part of&#13;\nPetitioners' contract with SAIF, the SAIF policy on&#13;\nretirement incorporates the benefits conferred in that&#13;\nHandbook by reference. * * * It did not adopt the&#13;\nHandbook as a 'legal reference.'\"</a><a href=\"#N_27_\"><sup> (27)</sup></a>&#13;\n</p></blockquote>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>b.  Petitioner Dahlin</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Petitioner Dahlin's opening brief asserts, in part:</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<blockquote>&#13;\n<p>\"Petitioner Dahlin relied on the PERS statutes,&#13;\nrules, handbooks, annual statements and web site&#13;\nestimates when planning his retirement.  Based on his&#13;\nreview of the communications from PERS, Petitioner&#13;\nDahlin believed that the Money Match would produce a&#13;\ngreater retirement benefit than the Full Formula. &#13;\nPetitioner Dahlin's understanding that the Money Match&#13;\ncalculation would exceed the value of the Full Formula&#13;\nbenefit was confirmed by annual statements that he&#13;\nreceived from PERS beginning in 1998.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>\"* * * * *</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>\"At all relevant times, the PERS handbooks * * *&#13;\nstated that '\"vesting\" means you cannot lose your&#13;\nbenefit rights, even if you stop working in covered&#13;\nemployment.'\" </p>&#13;\n</blockquote>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Respondents offered essentially the same arguments in&#13;\nresponse to petitioner Dahlin as they did to <i>Whitty</i> petitioners, &#13;\nsummarizing their response as follows:</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<blockquote>&#13;\n<p>\"[P]etitioner Dahlin asserts that his contract rights -- to the extent they exist -- arise from PERS handbooks&#13;\nand his annual statements, in addition to the PERS&#13;\nstatutes and regulations.  This assertion is incorrect. &#13;\nThere has been no legislative delegation to PER[B] that&#13;\nwould allow the agency to bind future Legislative&#13;\nAssemblies.  Indeed, such a delegation would be&#13;\nunconstitutional.  Moreover, these documents on which&#13;\npetitioner Dahlin relies actually contain language&#13;\ndisclosing the fact that they are not legal references&#13;\nor complete statements of the PERS statutes or rules,&#13;\nand that in [the event of] any conflict the statutes&#13;\nand rules shall prevail.\"</p>&#13;\n</blockquote>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>In reply, petitioner Dahlin states:</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<blockquote>&#13;\n<p>\"[Respondents] respond that as of 2001 the Handbooks&#13;\ncontained a disclaimer that indicated that if a&#13;\nconflict exists between the PERS statutes and the&#13;\nHandbook, the statute will control. * * *</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>\"[Respondents'] response, however, missed the&#13;\npoint of Petitioner Dahlin's argument.  Petitioner&#13;\nDahlin is not arguing that a conflict exists between&#13;\nthe PERS statute, its administrative rules, and the&#13;\nPERS Handbook.  Rather, Petitioner Dahlin is arguing&#13;\nthat the PERS Handbook is consistent with Oregon Law&#13;\nand the lack of a 'reservation of rights clause' is the&#13;\nrecognition of and an embodiment of the contract theory&#13;\nof pensions. * * *\" </p>&#13;\n</blockquote>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>c.  Discussion</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>To the extent that petitioner Dahlin and <i>Whitty</i>&#13;\npetitioners argue that the PERS handbooks, PERB communications,&#13;\nand the employment policies of SAIF form part of the PERS&#13;\ncontract, we reiterate that this court has held that PERS is a&#13;\n<i>statutory</i> contract.  <i>Hughes</i>, 314 Or at 25.  Therefore, the&#13;\nquestion whether the materials on which petitioners in part rely&#13;\nconstitute terms of that statutory contract is a question of&#13;\nlegislative intent.  <i>See generally</i> <i>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and&#13;\nIndustries</i>, 317 Or 606, 610-11, 859 P2d 1143 (1993) (statutory&#13;\nconstruction involves ascertaining legislature's intent; to do&#13;\nso, court first examines text and context of statute at issue);&#13;\nORS 174.020(1)(a) (\"[i]n the construction of a statute, a court&#13;\nshall pursue the intention of the legislature if possible\"). &#13;\nEven disregarding respondents' argument that the legislature&#13;\nlacks the power to delegate to an administrative agency or other&#13;\nsubdivision of the state the authority to set the terms of the&#13;\nPERS contract, the predicate question remains:  did the&#13;\nlegislature <i>intend</i> to do so?</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><a name=\"FNT28\">In that respect, petitioners point to no Oregon statute&#13;\nindicating that the legislature intended to permit PERB or any&#13;\nother entity as a general matter to set or alter any terms of the&#13;\nPERS statutory contract.</a><a href=\"#N_28_\"><sup> (28)</sup></a>&#13;\n  Nor has our own research&#13;\nrevealed any support for the idea that the legislature intended&#13;\nto permit PERB or any other governmental entity -- through the&#13;\nissuance of handbooks, policy statements, account summaries, or&#13;\notherwise -- to provide binding pronouncements of the retirement&#13;\nbenefits that PERS will provide.  We hold that the PERS&#13;\nhandbooks, communications from PERB to PERS members, and SAIF's&#13;\nemployment policies do not constitute terms of the PERS contract.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><a name=\"FNT29\">That holding does not meet directly the separate&#13;\nargument of <i>Whitty</i> petitioners that the 2003 PERS legislation&#13;\nbreaches or impairs their separate employment contracts with&#13;\nSAIF.  They analogize those contracts to the ordinance at issue&#13;\nin <i>Taylor</i>, 265 Or 445.  That analogy is inapposite, however, for&#13;\nthe simple reason that nothing about the retirement policy at&#13;\nissue in <i>Taylor</i> implicated a state statutory contract or any&#13;\nother legislative policy.</a><a href=\"#N_29_\"><sup> (29)</sup></a>&#13;\n  For <i>Whitty</i> petitioners to&#13;\nsucceed in that argument, the retirement policy that SAIF&#13;\nprovides to its employees would have to be independent of PERS. &#13;\nBut that is not the case.  SAIF offers its employees the PERS&#13;\nretirement plan, not a SAIF retirement plan or some sort of PERS&#13;\nhybrid.  And, as we determined above, nothing in the PERS&#13;\nstatutes indicates that the legislature intended to authorize&#13;\npublic employers to set the terms of the PERS contract. </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Accordingly, we reject the arguments of petitioner&#13;\nDahlin and <i>Whitty</i> petitioners that the PERS contract includes &#13;\nterms outside the PERS statutes (and applicable administrative&#13;\nrules) and the argument of <i>Whitty</i> petitioners that the 2003 PERS&#13;\nlegislation breaches or impairs their employment contracts with&#13;\nSAIF.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>2. <i>The Chess Settlement</i></p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Until 1991, PERS benefits were not subject to state or&#13;\nlocal income taxation.  ORS 237.201 (1989).  In 1989, the United&#13;\nStates Supreme Court held that, if a state exempts from state and&#13;\nlocal taxation pension benefits paid by state and local&#13;\ngovernments, principles of intergovernmental tax immunity require&#13;\nlike treatment of pension benefits paid by the federal&#13;\ngovernment.  <i>Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury</i>, 489 US 803, 109&#13;\nS Ct 1500, 103 L Ed 2d 891 (1989).  At the time of the <i>Davis</i>&#13;\ndecision, Oregon taxed federal pension benefits as personal&#13;\nincome.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Responding to that and other decisions, the 1991&#13;\nLegislative Assembly enacted Oregon Laws 1991, chapter 823, which&#13;\nrepealed the tax exemption for PERS benefits, thereby equalizing&#13;\nthe tax treatment of state and federal pensions.  As noted&#13;\nearlier in this opinion, this court in <i>Hughes</i> held that that&#13;\nrepeal of the tax exemption breached the PERS contract.  <i>Hughes</i>,&#13;\n314 Or at 33.  The court, however, concluded that \"[t]he&#13;\nlegislature is the most appropriate branch of government in the&#13;\nfirst instance to choose among the available remedies\" for that&#13;\nbreach.  <i>Id.</i> at 33 n 36.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>When the legislature failed to enact a remedy, class&#13;\naction litigation -- to which we refer as the <i>Chess</i> litigation --&#13;\nensued.  The trial court in <i>Chess</i> ultimately approved a&#13;\nsettlement for damages covering all PERS retirees who were PERS&#13;\nmembers before the effective date of the 1991 tax repeal&#13;\n(September 29, 1991).  The settlement agreement provided that the&#13;\n\"[p]laintiffs agree to accept the remedies provided in [the&#13;\nlegislation] as full and complete payment for all claims raised&#13;\nin [the class] actions.\"  The legislature adopted the terms of&#13;\nthe <i>Chess</i> settlement and codified them at ORS 238.375 to 238.380. &#13;\nORS 238.375(3) provides:</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<blockquote>&#13;\n<p>\"No member of the system or beneficiary of a&#13;\nmember of the system shall acquire a right, contractual&#13;\nor otherwise, to the increased benefits provided by&#13;\n[ORS 238.375 to 238.380].\"</p>&#13;\n</blockquote>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The implementation of those settlement terms resulted in an&#13;\nannual increase in employer contribution rates of approximately&#13;\n1.4 percent, amounting to a permanent annual expense that PERB&#13;\nassumed would continue for 30 years.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><i>Strunk</i> and <i>Burt</i> petitioners argue that Oregon Laws&#13;\n2003, chapter 67, <i>as amended by</i> Oregon Laws 2003, chapters 625&#13;\nand 733, when considered generally, breaches the settlement&#13;\nagreement in <i>Chess</i>.  Their analysis proceeds as follows:  PERB&#13;\nunderstood that codifying the <i>Chess</i> settlement would increase&#13;\nemployer contribution rates; employer contribution rates in fact&#13;\nincreased as a direct result of that legislation; the preamble to&#13;\nOregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, states that one reason for the&#13;\nenactment was to address the increase in employer contribution&#13;\nrates; some of that increase resulted from the <i>Chess</i> settlement&#13;\nlegislation; and therefore, \"[t]o the extent that the legislature&#13;\nhas lowered PERS retirement benefits, at least in part, because&#13;\nof the increase granted by [the legislation], then it has in fact&#13;\nrepealed the benefits of [that legislation].\"</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Respondents disagree for various reasons, only one of&#13;\nwhich we need address.  Respondents argue, we conclude correctly,&#13;\nthat the <i>Chess</i> settlement agreement by its specific terms limited&#13;\npetitioners' rights to those set out in the 1991 legislation and&#13;\nthat that legislation expressly disavowed the creation of any&#13;\ncontractual rights.  The wording of ORS 238.375(3), which&#13;\ncodified the settlement, could not be clearer in that respect. &#13;\nNothing about the context of that wording alters what we perceive&#13;\nto be the legislature's manifest intent.  Because petitioners&#13;\nhave failed to demonstrate a contractual right that Oregon Laws&#13;\n2003, chapter 67, <i>as amended by</i> Oregon Laws 2003, chapters 625&#13;\nand 733, is capable of breaching with respect to the <i>Chess</i>&#13;\nsettlement, we reject their argument.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>3. <i>Petitioners' Statutory Contract Claims</i></p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>We now turn to the central issues in these cases --&#13;\nthat is, petitioners' contentions that various aspects of the&#13;\n2003 PERS legislation unconstitutionally impair statutory&#13;\ncontractual obligations set out in the PERS contract in violation&#13;\nof Article I, section 21, or, alternatively, that aspects of the&#13;\n2003 legislation breach statutory contractual obligations set out&#13;\nin the PERS contract.  We discuss each challenged aspect of the&#13;\n2003 legislation separately.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>a. Redirection of Members' Contributions to the IAP</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>(1)  The Statutes</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>As noted, before the 2003 PERS legislation, PERS&#13;\nmembers were required to contribute, or to have employers&#13;\ncontribute on behalf of their employee members, six percent of&#13;\nmembers' salaries to those members' regular accounts.

To the extent that any such promise exists, respondents&#13;\ncontinue, there is no support in the text or context of the PERS&#13;\nstatutes for a legislative promise that members could continue to&#13;\ncontribute to their regular accounts throughout their PERS&#13;\nmembership.  </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Respondents assert that that conclusion is bolstered by&#13;\nthe fact that, when the legislature adopted the Full Formula in&#13;\n1981, it simultaneously reduced the statutory contributions of&#13;\nhigher compensated PERS members from seven percent to six&#13;\npercent.  Or Laws 1981, ch 761, &#167; 1 (discussed further below). &#13;\nSuch a reduction, they argue, is inconsistent with a legislative&#13;\nunderstanding that PERS members would have a perpetual right to&#13;\nmaintain contributions to the system at a particular level. &#13;\nOtherwise, the legislature would have grandfathered those members&#13;\nwho, before 1981, were required to contribute seven percent of&#13;\nsalary so as to preserve the amount of benefits that those&#13;\nmembers would receive at retirement.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><a name=\"FNT33\">Responding to petitioners' assertion that most mid-career PERS members effectively will lose the option of retiring&#13;\nunder the Money Match, respondents counter that the PERS statutes&#13;\nrequire only that a member receive a service retirement allowance&#13;\ncalculated under the formula that produces the highest pension&#13;\namount, whichever formula that may be.  There is no indication,&#13;\nthey contend, that the legislature intended that members would&#13;\nhave an option to have their service retirement allowances&#13;\ncalculated under a particular formula, the Money Match or&#13;\notherwise.  Moreover, respondents assert that certain wording in&#13;\nthe PERS statutes indicates that the legislature intended the&#13;\nMoney Match to be the floor for any service retirement&#13;\ncalculation and, consistently with that proposition, either the&#13;\nFull Formula or the Pension Plus Annuity provided the highest&#13;\nservice retirement allowance for most members before the mid-1990s.</a><a href=\"#N_33_\"><sup> (33)</sup></a>&#13;\n  They conclude that, under the 2003 PERS&#13;\nlegislation, members still will have those retirement benefits&#13;\nthat derive from their member accounts as they existed before the&#13;\n2003 PERS legislation, calculated on the full value of those&#13;\naccounts.  As to the other statutes upon which petitioners rely,&#13;\nORS 238.205 (2001) (permitting employer pick-up) and ORS 238.250&#13;\n(2001) (requiring PERB to provide regular accounts for members,&#13;\nshowing contributions and earnings), respondents argue that the&#13;\n2003 PERS legislation does not alter the pick-up provisions and&#13;\nthat the directive for PERB to establish PERS regular accounts&#13;\nfor members is nothing more than \"a clerical obligation imposed&#13;\non PERB\" to \"maintain appropriate record-keeping on member's&#13;\nregular accounts.\"</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>In the end, respondents assert that petitioners' only&#13;\ntrue complaint respecting the redirection of PERS member&#13;\ncontributions to the IAP is that their projected future service&#13;\nretirement allowances under the 2003 PERS legislation will not be&#13;\nas high as those allowances would have been without the&#13;\nlegislation.  And, although respondents agree that such will be&#13;\nthe case, they disagree with petitioners' claims that that&#13;\ncomplaint has either contractual or constitutional consequences.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>(3)  Discussion  </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><a name=\"FNT34\">We begin by noting some preliminary considerations. &#13;\nFirst, we are mindful that the \"accepted proposition of the&#13;\ncontractual nature of PERS is an essential background\" for our&#13;\ninquiry.  <i>Hughes</i>, 314 Or at 22.  Further, although petitioners&#13;\ncite a number of statutes as significant to our analysis of their&#13;\nchallenge to the redirection of member contributions to the IAP,&#13;\nwe conclude that the service retirement allowance formula&#13;\nprovisions, set out in ORS 238.300 (2001), viewed in context with&#13;\nother statutes that petitioners cite, are the most central to our&#13;\nanalysis, as explained below.</a><a href=\"#N_34_\"><sup> (34)</sup></a>&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>As noted, the crux of petitioners' analysis is that the&#13;\ndiversion of contributions from PERS members' regular accounts to&#13;\nIAP accounts means that \"most mid-career employees will lose the&#13;\noption of retiring under Money Match and will find their benefits&#13;\ncalculated under the less generous full formula benefit.\" &#13;\nAccordingly, we proceed to assess in detail the relevant benefit&#13;\nformulas that PERS provides.  That is, we consider whether the&#13;\nstatutory provisions containing those formulas are part of the&#13;\nPERS contract and, if so, the extent of the state's obligation in&#13;\nthat regard.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><a name=\"FNT35\">ORS 238.300 (2001)</a><a href=\"#N_35_\"><sup> (35)</sup></a>&#13;\n provided, in part, as&#13;\nfollows:</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<blockquote>&#13;\n<p>\"Upon retiring from service at normal retirement&#13;\nage or thereafter, a member of the system shall receive&#13;\na service retirement allowance which shall consist of&#13;\nthe following annuity and pensions:</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>\"(1)  A refund annuity which shall be the&#13;\nactuarial equivalent of accumulated contributions by&#13;\nthe member and interest thereon credited at the time of&#13;\nretirement * * *.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>\"(2)(a)  A life pension (nonrefund) for current&#13;\nservice provided by the contributions of employers,&#13;\nwhich pension, subject to paragraph (b) of this&#13;\nsubsection, shall be an amount which, when added to the&#13;\nsum of the annuity under subsection (1) of this section&#13;\nand the annuity, if any, provided on the same basis and&#13;\npayable from the Variable Annuity Account, both&#13;\nannuities considered on a refund basis, results in a&#13;\ntotal of:</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>\"(A)  For service as a police officer or&#13;\nfirefighter, two percent of final average salary&#13;\nmultiplied by the number of years of membership in the&#13;\nsystem * * *.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>\"(B)  For service as a member of the Legislative&#13;\nAssembly, two percent of final average salary&#13;\nmultiplied by the number of years of membership in the&#13;\nsystem * * *.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>\"(C)  For service as other than a police officer,&#13;\nfirefighter or member of the Legislative Assembly, 1.67&#13;\npercent of final average salary multiplied by the&#13;\nnumber of years of membership in the system * * *.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>\"(b)  A pension under this subsection shall be at&#13;\nleast:</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>\"(A)  The actuarial equivalent of the annuity&#13;\nprovided by the accumulated contributions of the&#13;\nmember.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>\"(B)  For a member who made contributions before&#13;\nAugust 21, 1981, the equivalent of a pension computed&#13;\npursuant to this subsection as it existed immediately&#13;\nbefore that date.\"</p>&#13;\n</blockquote>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>As a matter of plain text, ORS 238.300 (2001) provides,&#13;\nfirst, that a member is entitled to receive a service retirement&#13;\nallowance that is calculated by multiplying the member's final&#13;\naverage salary by a factor of 1.67 percent for general service&#13;\nemployees and then multiplying the resulting figure by the&#13;\nmember's years of membership.  That service retirement allowance&#13;\nthen is funded by an annuity component (consisting of the&#13;\nactuarial equivalent of the member's account balances at&#13;\nretirement) and a pension component (consisting of employer&#13;\ncontributions).  ORS 238.300(1), (2)(a) (2001).  That is the Full&#13;\nFormula.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>However, if the pension component as calculated under&#13;\nthe Full Formula is less than the actuarial equivalent of the&#13;\nannuity component based on a member's accumulated contributions&#13;\nto the fund, then the member is entitled to received a higher&#13;\npension component -- that is, one composed of the actuarial&#13;\nequivalent of the member's accumulated contributions.  ORS&#13;\n238.300(2)(b)(A) (2001).  That is the Money Match (<i>i.e.</i>, the&#13;\nemployer-funded pension component \"matches\" the member's annuity&#13;\ncomponent).  And, if a member contributed to PERS before August&#13;\n21, 1981, and the pension component calculated for that member&#13;\nbased on the system as it existed immediately before that date&#13;\nprovides a higher pension component than ones calculated under&#13;\nthe Full Formula and the Money Match, then the member receives&#13;\nthe higher pension amount.  ORS 238.300(2)(b)(B) (2001).  That is&#13;\nthe Pension Plus Annuity.  </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><a name=\"FNT36\">In other words, ORS 238.300 (2001) provided (and still&#13;\nprovides) that a retired PERS member will receive a final service&#13;\nretirement allowance that is calculated under the one formula of&#13;\nthe three described above that yields the highest pension amount&#13;\nfor that member, whichever formula that may be.  At the same&#13;\ntime, it appears to us that, notwithstanding the somewhat awkward&#13;\nplacement of the words \"at least\" in ORS 238.300(2)(b) (2001),&#13;\nthe legislature intended to set the Full Formula as the primary&#13;\nformula and, generally, designed the Full Formula so as to&#13;\nprovide a minimum level below which the pension component should&#13;\nnot fall.  That is so because the Full Formula, which,&#13;\nsignificantly, is set out in the first two parts of the statute,&#13;\nORS 238.300(1) and (2)(a) (2001), sets a defined benefit that&#13;\ndoes not vary depending on fluctuations in earnings or on the&#13;\nsize of the member's annuities from the regular and variable&#13;\naccounts.</a><a href=\"#N_36_\"><sup> (36)</sup></a>&#13;\n  Thus, in that context, the words \"at least\" in&#13;\nORS 238.300(2)(b) (2001) refer to a calculation of the Full&#13;\nFormula pension component that equals or exceeds a calculation of&#13;\na pension component calculated under the Money Match (based on&#13;\nthe member's accumulated contributions to the fund) or the&#13;\nPension Plus Annuity (based on earlier statutory requirements).</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>More importantly, the wording of ORS 238.300 (2001) is&#13;\nunambiguously promissory.  Through that statute, the legislature&#13;\ncontinuously and unequivocally has communicated to PERS members&#13;\nthat, if they retire from service at normal retirement age, they&#13;\nwill receive a pension component of their final service&#13;\nretirement allowance that, (1) when combined with the actuarial&#13;\nequivalent of their accumulated contributions to the fund, will&#13;\nconsist of the Full Formula amount based upon years of service,&#13;\nfinal average salary, and class of service that equals or exceeds&#13;\nany pension component calculated under the other two formulas; or&#13;\n(2) in the event that the Full Formula calculation falls short, a&#13;\npension component calculated under the Money Match or the Pension&#13;\nPlus Annuity.  In short, the state's obligation as set out in ORS&#13;\n238.300 (2001) is to provide a final service retirement allowance&#13;\nmade up of an annuity component and a pension component at the&#13;\nminimum level described above. </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><a name=\"FNT37\"/><a name=\"FNT38\">The context of ORS 238.300 (2001), which includes the &#13;\ndevelopment of the statute through successive legislatures,&#13;\n<i>Swarens v. Dept. of Rev.</i>, 320 Or 326, 331, 883 P2d 853 (1994),&#13;\nconfirms that reading.  ORS 238.300 and its predecessor statute,&#13;\n<i>former</i> ORS 237.147 (1993), have been a part of the PERS statutes&#13;\nsince the creation of PERS in 1953.</a><a href=\"#N_37_\"><sup> (37)</sup></a>&#13;\n  During those 50&#13;\nyears, the benefits that PERS has provided and the manner for&#13;\ncalculating them have changed considerably.  As the Special&#13;\nMaster noted, when the legislature created PERS, the system&#13;\nprovided a Money Purchase Plan with an employer matching&#13;\ncomponent.  <i>See</i> Or Laws 1953, ch 200, &#167; 18 (setting out benefit&#13;\nformula).<a href=\"#N_38_\"><sup> (38)</sup></a>&#13;\n  The stated goal of that formula, once combined&#13;\nwith an annuity funded by member contributions, was to provide&#13;\ncareer employees ineligible for the federal Social Security&#13;\nprogram approximately one half of their final average salaries;&#13;\nfor those eligible for Social Security, the target was less.  <i>Id.</i>&#13;\nat &#167; 13. </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>In 1955, the legislature increased the target&#13;\nreplacement ratio from 50 to 60 percent of final average salary,&#13;\nincluding Social Security.  Or Laws 1955, ch 131, &#167; 5(2).  That&#13;\nenactment also modified the member contribution rate to provide&#13;\nthat members making more than $4,800 per year could elect to&#13;\ncontribute an equal percentage of salary in excess of that&#13;\namount, which contributions would \"purchase at retirement[]&#13;\nadditional benefits which will be matched by the employer.\"  <i>Id.</i></p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>In 1967, the legislature repealed the provisions&#13;\nstating target retirement goals and abandoned calculating member&#13;\ncontribution rates based strictly on actuarial assumptions,&#13;\nopting instead for a straight percentage-of-salary model.  <i>See</i> Or&#13;\nLaws 1967, ch 622, &#167; 4.  The legislature also enacted the Pension&#13;\nPlus Annuity, under which retired members would receive an&#13;\nannuity (based on accumulated contributions and earnings) and a&#13;\npension calculated as the actuarial equivalent of 1.67 percent of&#13;\nthe member's final average salary for general service employees&#13;\n(1.92 percent for fire and police employees) multiplied by years&#13;\nof membership up to 30 years for general service (25 years for&#13;\nfire or police service).  Or Laws 1967, ch 622, &#167; 13.  Finally,&#13;\nthe legislature repealed the employer matching method for&#13;\ncalculating the pension component.  <i>Id.</i> </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>In 1969, the legislature restored the employer matching&#13;\nmethod (now known as the \"Money Match\") as one method for&#13;\ndetermining the pension component of retirement benefits.  As&#13;\nbetween the Money Match and the Pension Plus Annuity, the&#13;\namendment provided that the pension component of a service&#13;\nretirement allowance \"shall be <i>at least</i> the actuarial equivalent&#13;\nof the annuity provided by the accumulated contributions of the&#13;\n[member].\"  Or Laws 1969, ch 640, &#167; 7(2)(b) (emphasis added).  </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><a name=\"FNT39\">Other than changing the multiplier for the Pension Plus&#13;\nAnnuity, Or Laws 1971, ch 738, &#167; 2; Or Laws 1973, ch 695, &#167; 4,&#13;\nremoving the 25- and 30-year limits on years of membership, Or&#13;\nLaws 1971, ch 738, &#167; 2, and including legislators in the system,&#13;\nOr Laws 1975, ch 137, &#167; 3, the legislature did not amend the PERS&#13;\nstatutes in any significant way until 1981.

That is, contrary to petitioners'&#13;\narguments, the legislature did not promise that PERS would be&#13;\nmaintained so that the Money Match remains the primary calculator&#13;\nof member service retirement allowances, which it presently&#13;\nhappens to be because it usually is the most remunerative. &#13;\nInstead, that statutory evolution demonstrates that the&#13;\nlegislature promised that members would receive service&#13;\nretirement allowances calculated under whichever formula yields&#13;\nthe highest pension amount for that member and that the Full&#13;\nFormula calculation ordinarily should equal or exceed&#13;\ncalculations under the Money Match or, if applicable, the Pension&#13;\nPlus Annuity.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Before assessing the import of the statutory context&#13;\nset out above, we must ensure that we are ascertaining the intent&#13;\nof the correct legislature -- an inquiry that is critical when&#13;\nanalyzing statutory contracts.

From 1953 through 1967, PERS did not provide members&#13;\nwith any minimum level of benefits.  Instead, members received&#13;\nonly the contributions and earnings in their accounts matched by&#13;\nan employer pension in equal amount.  The key variable to that&#13;\nformula was earnings.  And, as petitioners note, those earnings&#13;\nprovided \"the only hope that members would have of achieving an&#13;\nannuity which approached the goals of the system.\" </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>That changed in 1967, when the legislature repealed the&#13;\nemployer-matching alternative and replaced it with the Pension&#13;\nPlus Annuity.  Under that system, a retired PERS member was&#13;\nguaranteed a minimum pension component that would be added to&#13;\nwhatever annuity that the contributions and earnings on the&#13;\nmember's accounts had provided, whether those earnings had been&#13;\ngood or bad.  Thus, unlike the earlier employer-matching method,&#13;\nwhich had placed the risk of investment loss on members, under&#13;\nthe Pension Plus Annuity, members could expect some minimum level&#13;\nof benefits and shared the risk of earnings shortfalls with&#13;\nemployers.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>As noted, in 1969, the legislature reinstated what is&#13;\nnow known as the Money Match as an additional formula to&#13;\ncalculate the pension component of a member's service retirement&#13;\nallowance.  Such an amendment could have been a meaningful&#13;\nlegislative act only if the legislature contemplated that the&#13;\nMoney Match might for some retired members provide higher pension&#13;\namounts.  Such an expectation, however, does not support the&#13;\nconclusion that the legislature <i>promised</i> members that that <i>always</i>&#13;\nwould be the case.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The final change that we determine to be relevant to&#13;\nunderstanding the evolution of the formulas for calculating&#13;\nservice retirement allowances occurred in 1981 with the creation&#13;\nof the Full Formula.  With that amendment, the legislature, for&#13;\nthe first time, provided members with a formula under which the&#13;\nrisk of earnings loss fell -- and continues to fall -- squarely&#13;\non employers.  The changes that the 1981 amendments made to&#13;\n<i>former</i> ORS 237.147 (1979), now ORS 238.300, were material:  they&#13;\nadded a new, primary benefit calculator to the system and shifted&#13;\nthe downside risk of investment return away from members. &#13;\nBecause we presume that the legislature intended those material&#13;\nchanges to change the meaning of the statute materially as well,&#13;\nwe conclude that the 1981 amendment effected a reenactment of the&#13;\nentire section and provides the version of the statute to which&#13;\nwe will look in ascertaining the legislature's promissory intent. </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Having concluded that Oregon Laws 1981, chapter 761,&#13;\nsection 4, enacted the operative statutory contract that is now&#13;\nembodied in ORS 238.300 (and also was embodied in ORS 238.300&#13;\n(2001)), we find nothing about the statutory law that preceded&#13;\nthe 1981 amendments to <i>former</i> ORS 237.147 (1979) that detracts&#13;\nfrom the preliminary conclusion that we drew from the wording of&#13;\nORS 238.300 (2001), that is, that the 1981 Legislative Assembly&#13;\npromised PERS members that, on retirement, they would receive the&#13;\nretirement formula yielding the highest pension amount.  Nor do&#13;\nwe find any contrary intent revealed in the other statutes upon&#13;\nwhich petitioners rely (concerning six percent member&#13;\ncontributions and direction of those contributions to PERS&#13;\nregular accounts). </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><a name=\"FNT40\">Our case law is consistent with that conclusion.  As an&#13;\ninitial matter, the parties have not directed us to a prior&#13;\ndecision interpreting the relevant statutory provisions, and we&#13;\nhave found none.  Looking more broadly to this court's prior&#13;\ndecisions involving PERS, petitioners place heavy reliance on&#13;\nthis court's decision in <i>OSPOA</i>, 323 Or 356.  <i>OSPOA</i>, however,&#13;\nstands for only the proposition that the legislature promised&#13;\nmembers that the permissible employer pick-up of member&#13;\ncontributions, assumed earnings rate for Tier One members, and&#13;\nunused sick-leave accrual provisions of the PERS statutory scheme&#13;\nwere promissory and applied even to work yet to be performed. &#13;\nHowever, nothing about the court's interpretation of the&#13;\nstatutory provisions at issue in <i>OSPOA</i> mandates a conclusion&#13;\ndifferent from the one that we have reached after analyzing the&#13;\ntext and context of ORS 238.300 (2001).</a><a href=\"#N_40_\"><sup> (40)</sup></a>&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>In summary, we conclude that the 1981 Legislative&#13;\nAssembly promised each eligible member that, at retirement, the&#13;\nmember would be entitled to receive a service retirement&#13;\nallowance calculated under the formula that yielded the highest&#13;\npension amount.  The legislature did not alter or eliminate that&#13;\npromise when it enacted in the 2003 PERS legislation.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Petitioners contend, however, that the statutory&#13;\ncontractual obligation that we just have described includes an&#13;\nadditional promise that PERS members have the right, during the&#13;\ncourse of their PERS membership, to contribute a certain&#13;\npercentage of their salary to their regular accounts so as to&#13;\n<i>increase</i> the value of their ultimate pension amount under the&#13;\nMoney Match.  We disagree.  </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Nothing in the text of ORS 238.200(1)(a) (2001), which&#13;\nrequired PERS members to contribute six percent of their salaries&#13;\nto the fund, supports petitioners' argument that the legislature&#13;\nintended that contribution to be immutable.  As noted earlier,&#13;\nthe 1981 Legislative Assembly lowered the member contribution&#13;\nrate from a high of seven percent to a uniform six percent.  And,&#13;\nat the same time, the legislature grandfathered those members&#13;\npreviously paying a contribution rate of less than six percent,&#13;\neven though it meant that those members' account balances, and&#13;\ntherefore the service retirement allowances that the members&#13;\nultimately would receive, would be smaller under the Money Match. &#13;\nIn other words, the text of ORS 238.200(1)(a) (2001) and its&#13;\nstatutory context do not establish clearly and unambiguously that&#13;\nthe legislature intended to promise members that they could&#13;\ncontribute six percent of their salaries to their regular&#13;\naccounts throughout their PERS membership so as to maximize their&#13;\npension component calculation under the Money Match.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Applying the foregoing conclusions to petitioners'&#13;\nclaims that the redirection of PERS members' future contributions&#13;\nto the IAP, as set out in the 2003 PERS legislation, either&#13;\nbreaches or impairs a contractual obligation of the PERS&#13;\ncontract, the answer is clear:  Nothing about the creation of the&#13;\nIAP alters the legislature's promise that, at retirement, each&#13;\nmember will receive a service retirement allowance calculated&#13;\nunder the formula yielding the highest pension amount, and&#13;\nnothing about the IAP legislation constitutes a breach of that&#13;\npromise.  To the contrary, under the 2003 PERS legislation, each&#13;\nmember in the system at the time of the effective date of that&#13;\nlegislation will, at retirement, receive a service retirement&#13;\nallowance consisting of an annuity component based on the&#13;\nmember's contributions and earnings and a pension component&#13;\ncalculated under the formula that yields the highest pension&#13;\namount. </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>b.

As with the&#13;\nprovisions respecting contributions to members' regular accounts&#13;\nthat predated the 2003 PERS legislation, petitioners view the&#13;\nwording of the statutory provisions respecting the crediting of&#13;\nearnings to those accounts as unambiguously promissory,&#13;\napplicable to work yet to be performed, and containing no&#13;\nreservation of the right to future amendment.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Based upon that understanding of the above-quoted 2001&#13;\nstatutory provisions, petitioners argue that the above-quoted&#13;\nprovisions from the 2003 PERS legislation directly and indirectly&#13;\neither breach or impair those earlier obligations:</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<blockquote>&#13;\n<p>\"There is no question but that these legislative&#13;\nchanges eliminate the requirement that petitioners'&#13;\n[regular] accounts grow at a rate <i>at least equal</i> to the&#13;\nassumed rate <i>annually</i> as promised by the 1975&#13;\nlegislature.  Furthermore, by removing the employer&#13;\nCall, these changes eliminate the requirement that&#13;\nafter five years, any remaining deficit created by the&#13;\npayment of the guarantee becomes the liability of&#13;\nemployers. * * * [Instead], all future deficits will be&#13;\nretired only through earnings on employee accounts.  In&#13;\naccordance with these provisions, in 2004, [PERB]&#13;\ndistributed zero earnings to petitioners['] accounts&#13;\nfor the 2003 earnings.\"</p>&#13;\n</blockquote>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Respondents disagree.  They argue that ORS 238.255&#13;\n(2001) did not promise or require that PERB would credit PERS&#13;\nmembers' regular accounts with a specific amount of earnings each&#13;\nyear.  Instead, that statute requires only that crediting occur&#13;\nat \"the assumed rate for that year determined by [PERB],\" that&#13;\nPERB had the discretion to change that rate, and that the&#13;\nlegislature may (and did in 2003) confine PERB's discretion in&#13;\nsetting the assumed rate.  Moreover, respondents argue that the&#13;\n2003 PERS legislation applies to only prospective crediting&#13;\ndecisions and that newly enacted ORS 238.258 ensures that members&#13;\nultimately never will receive a lower service retirement&#13;\nallowance than they would have received if their regular accounts&#13;\nhad been credited at the assumed earnings rate each year. &#13;\nRespondents also disagree with petitioners' reading of the former&#13;\ncall provision as requiring employers to make up any five-year&#13;\ndeficit in the gain-loss reserve.  Finally, respondents argue&#13;\nthat nothing in the statutes upon which petitioners rely&#13;\nestablishes a legislative promise that PERS members are entitled&#13;\nto have credited to their regular accounts \"any earnings in&#13;\nexcess of the assumed rate.\"</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>(3) Discussion</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Our assessment of the parties' arguments begins with&#13;\nthis court's holding in <i>OSPOA</i> that the legislature intended the&#13;\nassumed earnings rate for Tier One members to constitute a&#13;\npromise that extends to work yet to be performed.  Specifically,&#13;\nthe court stated:</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<blockquote>&#13;\n<p>\"The state's promise, as material, included employee&#13;\naccess to the return rate procedure described in ORS&#13;\n237.277.  Section 11 [of Ballot Measure 8 (1994)] would&#13;\ncancel that obligation after employees partially&#13;\nperformed their services.  Moreover, section 11 impairs&#13;\nthe obligation of contract stated in ORS 237.277,&#13;\nbecause it would entirely eliminate that obligation&#13;\nwith respect to employee contributions to PERS made by&#13;\ncurrent employees for work performed both <i>before</i> and&#13;\nafter the effective date of Measure 8.  <i>Hughes</i>;&#13;\n<i>Taylor</i>.\"</p>&#13;\n</blockquote>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><i>OSPOA</i>, 323 Or at 378 (emphasis in original).  That holding,&#13;\nhowever, must be considered in the context of the nature of the&#13;\nimpairment of the contractual obligation at issue in that case. &#13;\nThere, Measure 8 had presented an all-or-nothing scenario, in&#13;\n<i>eliminating in its entirety</i> the legislative promise that Tier One&#13;\nmembers would receive annual crediting to their regular accounts&#13;\nin an amount not less than the assumed earnings rate. </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><a name=\"FNT44\">The 2003 PERS legislation, however, does something&#13;\nother than simply eliminate the obligation.  Instead, by enacting&#13;\nORS 238.258 -- which requires a guaranteed crediting at the&#13;\napplicable assumed earnings rates on a career basis at retirement&#13;\n-- the legislature at least acknowledged the promissory nature of&#13;\nthe guaranteed rate of return that <i>OSPOA</i> recognized. &#13;\nAccordingly, we are required to interpret the statutory&#13;\nprovisions at issue in greater detail than did the court in&#13;\n<i>OSPOA</i>, so as to determine whether the 2003 PERS legislation is&#13;\nconsistent with the earlier legislative promise.</a><a href=\"#N_44_\"><sup> (44)</sup></a>&#13;\n </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>We address first petitioners' argument that the&#13;\nstatutes before the 2003 PERS legislation guaranteed Tier One&#13;\nmembers not only annual earnings at a rate not less than the&#13;\nassumed earnings rate but also any earnings in excess of the&#13;\nassumed rate, less any allocations necessary for administrative&#13;\nexpenses and to properly constituted reserves.  We find no&#13;\nsupport for that broad proposition in the wording of the statutes&#13;\non which petitioners rely.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>ORS 238.255 (2001), for example, addressed directly the&#13;\ncircumstance in which a Tier One member's \"regular account is&#13;\ncredited with earnings for the previous year in an amount less&#13;\nthan the earnings that would have been credited pursuant to the&#13;\nassumed interest rate for that year determined by [PERB].\"  In&#13;\nsuch instances, PERB credited the difference to the member's&#13;\nregular account and charged that amount to the gain-loss reserve. &#13;\nAlthough that wording supports a legislative promise that Tier&#13;\nOne members' regular accounts will grow annually in an amount not&#13;\nless than the assumed earnings rate, that text evinces no support&#13;\nfor the proposition that Tier One members contractually are&#13;\nentitled to any <i>overage</i> that is not applied to administrative&#13;\nexpenses or reserves.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Neither does the legislative direction later in that&#13;\nstatute that \"[e]arnings in excess of the assumed interest rate&#13;\nfor years following the year for which a charge is made to the&#13;\n[gain-loss reserve] shall first be applied to reduce or eliminate&#13;\nthe amount of a deficit,\" ORS 238.255 (2001), support&#13;\npetitioners' claim.  Although that sentence expressly&#13;\ncontemplated the <i>potential</i> for excess earnings, the only command&#13;\nin the statutory wording is that the overage first go toward&#13;\nrestoring the gain-loss reserve.  Notably absent is any directive&#13;\nthat, following such application, PERB <i>must</i> apply any remaining&#13;\nearnings to PERS members' regular accounts.  </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><a name=\"FNT45\">Likewise, ORS 238.670 (2001), which addressed years in&#13;\nwhich the fund's earnings equaled or exceeded the assumed&#13;\nearnings rate and on which petitioners also rely, did not contain&#13;\nany affirmative promise that PERS members were entitled to a&#13;\ncrediting of the overage, less expenses, to their regular&#13;\naccounts.  Instead, that statute provided only that, for such&#13;\nyears, PERB \"shall set aside, out of interest and other income&#13;\nreceived * * *, such part of the income as [PERB] may deem&#13;\nadvisable, not exceeding seven and one-half percent of the&#13;\ncombined total of such income\" to a reserve account.  That&#13;\nstatute was not a legislative directive that PERB <i>must</i> credit any&#13;\nremaining excess earnings to members' regular accounts.  Finally,&#13;\nwe have found nothing in the context or history of those&#13;\nstatutory provisions that detracts from the conclusion that we&#13;\nhave drawn from the text -- that is, that the legislature made no&#13;\nsuch promise respecting excess earnings.</a><a href=\"#N_45_\"><sup> (45)</sup></a>&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The record in these cases establishes that PERB in fact&#13;\nhistorically has credited PERS members' regular accounts with&#13;\nexcess earnings in good investment years.  Even so, it is not for&#13;\nthis court to codify PERB's practices.  Instead, our task is to&#13;\nascertain those aspects of the PERS statutes that are promissory&#13;\nand, from those provisions, to determine the precise nature of&#13;\nthe obligations that they impose.  It is those obligations that&#13;\nset the conditions that the legislature may not in the future&#13;\nalter without consequence.  That PERB may have been administering&#13;\nthe system in a more generous fashion regarding crediting to&#13;\nmembers' regular accounts than the statutes required does not&#13;\nalter the nature of the promises that the legislature made.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>For the reasons set out above, we conclude that Tier&#13;\nOne members had no contractual right under the PERS statutes as&#13;\nthey existed before the 2003 PERS legislation to the crediting of&#13;\nannual earnings in excess of the assumed earnings rate to their&#13;\nregular accounts.  Instead, we conclude that, for Tier One&#13;\nmembers, annual crediting at &#8211;- but not in excess of &#8211;- the&#13;\nassumed earnings rate is the promise that the legislature&#13;\nextended.  Those conclusions, moreover, undermine at least in&#13;\npart petitioners' subsidiary argument, <i>viz.</i>, that the legislature&#13;\ncontractually is bound to maintain the system's allocation of the&#13;\nburden of funding reserves and paying administrative expenses. &#13;\nSo long as Tier One members' regular accounts are credited&#13;\nannually with earnings that do not fall below the assumed&#13;\nearnings rate, the legislature has reserved for itself the&#13;\nability to redirect any excess earnings.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Those conclusions, however, do not address fully&#13;\npetitioners' argument that, by changing the future timing of the&#13;\ncrediting process, the 2003 PERS legislation removes (<i>i.e.</i>,&#13;\nimpairs) the obligation that Tier One members' regular accounts&#13;\nannually be credited not less than the assumed earnings rate.  In&#13;\nassessing that argument, we begin by comparing the statutory&#13;\nprocesses for Tier One regular account crediting both before and&#13;\nafter the 2003 PERS legislation.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Before the 2003 PERS legislation, PERB examined the&#13;\nregular accounts of Tier One members annually to determine&#13;\nwhether the earnings credited to those accounts fell below the&#13;\nassumed earnings rate.  ORS 238.255 (2001).  If they did, then&#13;\nPERB would credit the difference to those accounts and charge&#13;\nthat difference to the gain-loss reserve.  <i>Id.</i>  That statute&#13;\nfurther provided that the gain-loss reserve could not be&#13;\nmaintained on a deficit basis for more than five years (the&#13;\ncall), and, respecting repayment of the deficit, the statute&#13;\nprovided that PERB first must apply future earnings in excess of&#13;\nthe assumed earnings rate to reduce or eliminate the deficit. &#13;\nAnd, as noted earlier in this opinion, the call provisions of the&#13;\nstatute never have had to be invoked.  Also, before the 2003 PERS&#13;\nlegislation, Tier One members received annual statements showing&#13;\nthe crediting from the previous year's earnings, and those&#13;\nearnings were never less than the assumed earnings rate.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><a name=\"FNT46\"/><a name=\"FNT47\">Under the 2003 PERS legislation, however, the crediting&#13;\nsystem for Tier One members has changed considerably.  First, as&#13;\nwe have addressed and upheld above, Tier One members no longer&#13;\nare authorized to contribute salary withholdings to their regular&#13;\naccounts.  Accordingly, any future growth in those accounts will&#13;\nderive solely from earnings on the members' account balances as&#13;\nof the effective date of the 2003 legislation.  Moreover, it no&#13;\nlonger is the case that Tier One members' regular accounts&#13;\nnecessarily will receive year-by-year annual credits in an amount&#13;\nnot less than the assumed earnings rate.  For example, if a&#13;\ndeficit exists in the gain-loss reserve, then PERB will apply&#13;\nTier One regular account earnings to the gain-loss reserve in the&#13;\nyears following to reduce or eliminate that deficit.</a><a href=\"#N_46_\"><sup> (46)</sup></a> Moreover, PERB now may not credit any earnings to Tier One&#13;\nmembers' regular accounts for any year in which to do so would&#13;\ncause a deficit in the gain-loss reserve, and, for any year in&#13;\nwhich the fund experiences a loss, PERB is required to charge the&#13;\namount of the loss attributable to Tier One members' regular&#13;\naccounts against the gain-loss reserve.  Or Laws 2003, ch 67, &#167;&#13;\n5, <i>as amended by</i> Or Laws 2003, ch 625, &#167; 10, <i>codified as</i> ORS&#13;\n238.255(1) and (2).<a href=\"#N_47_\"><sup> (47)</sup></a>&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>As described, there can be little doubt but that the&#13;\n2003 PERS legislation took what was before an <i>unconditional</i> right&#13;\nof Tier One members to have their regular accounts credited in an&#13;\namount not less than the assumed earnings rate and changed that&#13;\nright to a <i>conditional</i> one.  That change, standing alone, would&#13;\nconstitute an impairment of a contractual obligation set out in&#13;\nthe PERS contract, because it amounts to an alteration of the&#13;\nlegislature's promise respecting the crediting of members'&#13;\nregular accounts.  <i>See</i>&#160;<i>Eckles</i>, 306 Or at 395, 400 (explaining&#13;\ngravamen of constitutional violation; contrasting impairment with&#13;\nbreach).  </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The 2003 PERS legislation, however, added a new&#13;\nstatutory provision, ORS 238.258 (quoted above), apparently to&#13;\nmeet what otherwise seems a clear impairment of contractual&#13;\nobligation.  That provision states that, for purposes of&#13;\ncomputing the service retirement allowance of a retired Tier One&#13;\nmember, the member's minimum regular account balance will be \"the&#13;\namount that the regular account of a member would have contained&#13;\nif the regular account had been credited with earnings at the&#13;\nassumed interest rate in every year in which the regular account&#13;\n* * * was in existence.\"  Or Laws 2003, ch 67, &#167; 8(2), <i>as amended&#13;\nby</i> Or Laws 2003, ch 625, &#167; 12.  Therefore, the validity of&#13;\npetitioners' argument, as well as the validity of that aspect of&#13;\nthe 2003 PERS legislation, depends on whether that new provision&#13;\nis consistent with the legislature's earlier guarantee.  We&#13;\nconclude that it is not.  </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>As discussed, the legislature's promise with respect to&#13;\nTier One members was that those members would receive no less&#13;\nthan the assumed earnings rate credited annually to their regular&#13;\naccounts.  That statutory promise extends throughout PERS&#13;\nmembership.  <i>See</i> <i>OSPOA</i>, 323 Or at 377-78 (constitutional&#13;\namendment that eliminated assumed earnings rate on contributions&#13;\nto member accounts for work performed both before and after date&#13;\nof adoption impaired contract set out in <i>former</i> ORS 237.777&#13;\n(1975)).  That part of the 2003 PERS legislation providing for a&#13;\n\"minimum regular account balance,\" Or Laws 2003, ch 67, &#167; 8(2),&#13;\n<i>as amended by</i> Or Laws 2003, ch 625, &#167; 12, based on the assumed&#13;\nearnings rate over the life of a Tier One member's regular&#13;\naccount, is not consistent with the above-described obligation. &#13;\nThat is so because Tier One members' regular account balances&#13;\ncurrently reflect annual earnings credits that often <i>exceeded</i> the&#13;\nassumed earnings rate.  Those prior earnings crediting decisions,&#13;\nwhether or not they are deemed overly generous in hindsight, are&#13;\nnow final.  To the extent that those final crediting decisions&#13;\nare reflected in Tier One members' regular account balances, no&#13;\nless than the assumed earnings rate must be credited annually to&#13;\nthose account balances until retirement.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>In creating a new, <i>post hoc</i>, career-crediting process,&#13;\nthe 2003 PERS legislation, Or Laws 2003, ch 67, &#167; 8, <i>as amended&#13;\nby</i> Or Laws 2003, ch 625, &#167; 12, changes that obligation,&#13;\nultimately resulting in many cases in account balances that will&#13;\nnot represent the sum of all earnings that, consistently with the&#13;\nearlier legislative promise, <i>annually</i> have been (and would be)&#13;\ncredited to Tier One members' regular accounts.  We therefore&#13;\nhold that Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, sections 5 to 8, <i>as&#13;\namended by</i> Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 625, sections 10 to 12,&#13;\nalter the state's earlier contractual obligation and thereby&#13;\nimpair that obligation in violation of Article I, section 21, of&#13;\nthe Oregon Constitution. </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Having concluded that that part of the 2003 PERS&#13;\nlegislation alters and thereby impairs the state's contractual&#13;\nobligation to credit Tier One members' regular accounts annually&#13;\nin an amount not less than the assumed earnings rate, we proceed&#13;\nto consider the State of Oregon and nonstate respondents'&#13;\nremaining alternative argument and affirmative defense that they&#13;\nadvance to avoid the ultimate conclusion that that impairment is&#13;\nconstitutionally significant.  For the reasons set out below, we&#13;\nconclude that respondents' remaining argument and affirmative&#13;\ndefense are not availing under the present circumstances.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>First, respondents argue that, to violate Article I,&#13;\nsection 21, of the Oregon Constitution, an impairment of&#13;\ncontractual obligation must be \"substantial.\"  And, in&#13;\nrespondents' view, any impairment resulting from the 2003 PERS&#13;\nlegislation is not of that magnitude.  Specifically, they argue:</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<blockquote>&#13;\n<p>\"This Court has not directly addressed the&#13;\nquestion whether the Legislative Assembly may, within&#13;\nthe confines of Oregon's Contract Clause, amend or&#13;\nalter an obligation without impairing or breaching a&#13;\nstatutory contract.  It has implied on several&#13;\noccasions, however, that a lesser modification to a&#13;\nstatutory contract may be constitutionally&#13;\npermissible.\"</p>&#13;\n</blockquote>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>For that proposition, respondents rely primarily on the&#13;\nstatement in <i>Hughes</i> that, once vested, \"an employee's contractual&#13;\ninterest in a pension plan may not be <i>substantially</i> impaired by&#13;\nsubsequent legislation.\"  314 Or at 20 (emphasis added). &#13;\nMoreover, respondents argue that other state and federal courts&#13;\nhave reached the same conclusion in the context of pension&#13;\nlitigation and urge this court to follow suit.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>We agree with respondents that this court has yet to&#13;\ndetermine whether substantiality of an impairment of a&#13;\ncontractual obligation is required to show a violation of Article&#13;\nI, section 21.  Further, we have considered thoroughly the well-developed arguments from both sides addressing the issue. &#13;\nHowever, we conclude that we need not answer that question in&#13;\nthis instance.  That is so because, assuming without deciding&#13;\nthat substantiality is a required element, we deem the impairment&#13;\nto the obligation in the PERS contract respecting the annual&#13;\nassumed earnings rate guarantee to be substantial.  We reach that&#13;\nconclusion for two reasons.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>As an initial matter, although the evidence of the&#13;\nimpact of the crediting changes to Tier One members' regular&#13;\naccounts was sharply contested before the Special Master, and the&#13;\nSpecial Master found that the evidence consisted of estimates&#13;\nthat were themselves contingent, that data is sufficiently&#13;\nprecise to permit this court to find that, for <i>Strunk</i> petitioners&#13;\nas an example, the provisions relating to crediting of Tier One&#13;\nmembers' regular accounts will result in a reduction of benefits&#13;\n(compared to those that they would have received without the&#13;\nlegislation) in amounts varying between approximately 12 and 20&#13;\npercent per month.  Such significant reductions are illustrative&#13;\nof a substantial impairment of the assumed earnings rate&#13;\nguarantee.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><a name=\"FNT48\">More significantly, we deem the impairment to be&#13;\nsubstantial for the further reason that the alternative that the&#13;\nlegislature provided &#8211;- career-long crediting at the assumed&#13;\nearnings rate &#8211;- has a retrospective effect on earnings accrued&#13;\nfor work already performed.  That is so because, in providing the&#13;\ncareer-basis remedy, the 2003 PERS legislation disregards&#13;\nentirely PERB's earlier crediting decisions -&#8211; decisions that&#13;\ngenerally were not challenged</a><a href=\"#N_48_\"><sup> (48)</sup></a>&#13;\n -&#8211; and effectively replaces&#13;\nthe resulting regular those account earnings, many of which had&#13;\nexceeded the minimum rate of earnings, with the assumed earnings&#13;\nrate.  Absent some legal basis for such a downward adjustment,&#13;\nthat legislative choice amounts to nothing more than a unilateral&#13;\ndecision to reduce benefits already earned.  That, in our view,&#13;\nis a substantial impairment of the contractual obligation&#13;\nrespecting the assumed earnings rate guarantee.  Accordingly, we&#13;\nreject respondents' argument to the contrary.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Respondents next argue by way of affirmative defense&#13;\nthat, even if the impairment is substantial, a substantial&#13;\nimpairment can be justified if reasonable and necessary for an&#13;\nimportant public purpose.  Oregon has not adopted that view.  <i>See</i>&#13;\n<i>Hughes</i>, 314 Or at 14 n 16 (\"the application of the rule that a&#13;\nstate may not contract away its 'police power' under Article I,&#13;\nsection 21, of the Oregon Constitution, does not embrace the&#13;\n'balancing' analysis currently employed by the Supreme Court of&#13;\nthe United States\"). </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The parties introduced voluminous documentary and&#13;\ntestimonial evidence concerning the financial status of PERS and&#13;\nthe Oregon economy generally in support of and against what the&#13;\nSpecial Master described as respondents' \"economic hardship&#13;\ndefenses.\"  That evidence, and specifically the recommended&#13;\nfindings that the Special Master derived therefrom, do not&#13;\nconvince us that the situation rises to the high threshold that&#13;\nwould have to be met for an economic hardship defense -- were we&#13;\nto recognize one -- to succeed.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>First, we emphasize that we are not dealing here with&#13;\nlegislation that impairs private contracts.  Instead, we are&#13;\ndealing with a statutory contract.  In other words, it is one of&#13;\nthe <i>parties</i> to the contract (the state) that now is attempting to&#13;\nrely on a change in circumstances to permit it to alter its&#13;\ncontractual obligations in a constitutional manner.  In that&#13;\nlight, we note that the Special Master made, among others, the&#13;\nfollowing recommended findings:</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<blockquote>&#13;\n<p/><li>  \"Oregon's state tax burden currently is&#13;\napproximately .7 percent less than the national&#13;\naverage.\"  &#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n<p/></li><li>  \"[T]here is little voter willingness to raise&#13;\ntaxes to provide additional government revenues.\" &#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n<p/></li><li>  The \"capital downturn\" from 2000 through 2002,&#13;\nalthough causing a greater impact on state tax revenues&#13;\nthan previous economic downturns over the past two&#13;\ndecades, \"did not compare in magnitude or duration to&#13;\nthe Great Depression of the 1930s.\" &#13;\n</li></blockquote>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>To be sure, the Special Master's report contains other&#13;\nrecommended findings that demonstrate that the state's recent&#13;\nfiscal status is both serious and has resulted in substantial&#13;\ndetriments to the provision of governmental services across the&#13;\nstate.  We accept all those findings.  Taken together, however,&#13;\nthey do not justify a rewriting of the assumed earnings rate&#13;\nguarantee in a manner that would result in the elimination of&#13;\nearnings both promised and actually credited over time to Tier&#13;\nOne members' regular accounts.  We reject respondents' economic&#13;\nhardship affirmative defense and declare Oregon Laws 2003,&#13;\nchapter 67, sections 5 to 8, <i>as amended by</i> Oregon Laws 2003,&#13;\nchapter 625, sections 10 to 12, void.  <i>See</i>&#160;<i>Hughes</i> 314 Or at 31&#13;\n(law impairing obligation of contract \"is a nullity\").</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>c.  Elimination of the Variable Annuity Account Program</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>(1) The Statutes</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>As noted, the legislature in 1967 authorized PERS&#13;\nmembers to direct a percentage of their contributions to equity&#13;\ninvestments, by creating a variable annuity account program.  Or&#13;\nLaws 1967, ch 622, &#167; 24, <i>codified as</i> <i>former</i> ORS 237.197 (1967),&#13;\n<i>renumbered as</i> ORS 238.260 (1995).  The 2001 version of that&#13;\nstatute, which remains substantially unchanged from the enactment&#13;\nas initially worded, provided, in part, as follows:</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<blockquote>&#13;\n<p>\"A member may elect at any time to have 25, 50 or&#13;\n75 percent of contributions by the member to the fund&#13;\non and after the effective date of the election paid&#13;\ninto the Variable Annuity Account, credited to a&#13;\nvariable account, and reserved for the purchase of a&#13;\nvariable annuity.  A member who has elected to have a&#13;\npercentage of contributions so paid, credited and&#13;\nreserved may elect at any time thereafter to have an&#13;\nadditional 25 or 50 percent of contributions by the&#13;\nmember, but not to exceed a maximum of 75 percent, so&#13;\npaid, credited and reserved.  An election shall be in&#13;\nwriting on a form furnished by [PERB] and be filed with&#13;\n[PERB].  An election shall be effective on January 1&#13;\nfollowing the filing thereof.\"</p>&#13;\n</blockquote>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><a name=\"FNT49\">ORS 238.260(3) (2001).</a><a href=\"#N_49_\"><sup> (49)</sup></a>&#13;\n  The 2003 PERS legislation,&#13;\nhowever, added a new paragraph (b) to ORS 238.260(3), stating&#13;\nthat, \"[n]otwithstanding any other provision of this section, a&#13;\nmember may not contribute to the Variable Annuity Account after&#13;\nDecember 31, 2003.\"  Or Laws 2003, ch 67, &#167; 3.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>(2) The Parties' Arguments</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><a name=\"FNT50\">All petitioners, except petitioner Sartain, argue that&#13;\nthey have a statutory \"right\" to continue directing a percentage&#13;\nof their PERS contributions to equity investments via their&#13;\nvariable accounts, and they focus not only on the use of the word&#13;\n\"shall\" in ORS 238.260(3) (2001), but also on the wording \"at any&#13;\ntime,\" \"on and after,\" and \"at any time thereafter\" in that&#13;\nprovision to support their claim that that right extends to&#13;\nfuture, rather than to only present, member contributions to&#13;\nPERS.  Moreover, petitioners point to the legislative history of&#13;\nthe 1967 enactment as support for their claim that the&#13;\nlegislature intended, through establishment of the variable&#13;\nannuity account program, \"to allow employees the opportunity to&#13;\nincrease their benefits.\"</a><a href=\"#N_50_\"><sup> (50)</sup></a>&#13;\n  As before with respect to the&#13;\nstatutory provisions governing PERS members' regular accounts,&#13;\npetitioners argue that, by permitting no further contributions to&#13;\nthe variable annuity account program, the 2003 PERS legislation&#13;\nbreaches or impairs the PERS contract because the statutory&#13;\nprovisions are </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<blockquote>&#13;\n<p>\"unquestionably part of the PERS Act, [are] integral to&#13;\nthe calculation of benefits under the Act, [use]&#13;\nunambiguously promissory [wording], [and] contain no&#13;\nlanguage excluding contributions attributable to future&#13;\nservice from the general contractual protection and no&#13;\nreservation of [the] right of future amendment.\"</p>&#13;\n</blockquote>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Respondents likewise advance what in essence repeats&#13;\ntheir argument concerning PERS members' regular accounts in&#13;\nresponse to petitioners' variable account claims, <i>viz.</i>, that,&#13;\nbecause members have no continuing contractual right to make&#13;\ncontributions to PERS, they similarly have no right to direct&#13;\nthose contributions to a variable account.  Respondents view the&#13;\nwording \"at anytime thereafter\" in ORS 238.260(3) (2001) not as&#13;\nestablishing a <i>right</i> to make future contributions but, instead,&#13;\nas allowing a member to change his or her election at any time so&#13;\nlong as the variable account remains available as a statutory&#13;\noption.  Finally, respondents emphasize that nothing about the&#13;\n2003 PERS legislation impacts funds held in a member's variable&#13;\naccount as of the effective date of that legislation.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>(3) Discussion</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>For many of the same reasons that we concluded that the&#13;\nstatutory provisions respecting PERS members' regular accounts&#13;\nare terms of the PERS contract, we likewise conclude, and do so&#13;\nwithout further discussion, that the variable account provisions&#13;\nare as well.  (We do not understand respondents to argue to the&#13;\ncontrary.)  Accordingly, we proceed to determine the meaning of&#13;\nthose statutory contractual terms, specifically, whether they&#13;\nconstitute a legislative promise that members would have a right&#13;\nfor the duration of their membership in PERS to continue&#13;\ndirecting contributions to their variable accounts.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><a name=\"FNT51\">From a textual standpoint, and from petitioners'&#13;\nperspective, the salient wording of ORS 238.260(3) (2001) is the&#13;\nphrase \"at any time,\" which appears two times in that&#13;\nsubsection.</a><a href=\"#N_51_\"><sup> (51)</sup></a>&#13;\n  Read in isolation, those broad temporal&#13;\nreferences could support petitioners' contention that the&#13;\nlegislature promised PERS members that they would be permitted to&#13;\ncontribute to their variable accounts (as well as to increase&#13;\ntheir contributions to those accounts) for the duration of their&#13;\nactive membership.  Ascribing such an intent to the legislature,&#13;\nhowever, becomes much less supportable when other wording in the&#13;\nstatute is considered, particularly the wording that ties a&#13;\nmember's right \"at any time\" to contribute to a variable account&#13;\nto the member's \"contributions * * * <i>to the fund</i>.\"  (Emphasis&#13;\nadded.)  Likewise, a member's right to increase his or her&#13;\nvariable account election \"at any time thereafter\" is tied to&#13;\n\"<i>contributions by the member</i>\" <i>to the fund</i>.  (Emphasis added.)</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>As we have held above, the legislature did not promise&#13;\nmembers that they could <i>continue making contributions to the fund</i>&#13;\nthroughout their membership in PERS.  And, because we have upheld &#13;\nthe legislature's 2003 decision to prohibit members from <i>further</i>&#13;\ncontributing to the fund (and, instead, to direct member&#13;\ncontributions to the IAP), there no longer will be fund&#13;\ncontributions from which a percentage could be directed to a&#13;\nvariable account.  As we view the entirety of the wording of ORS&#13;\n238.260(3) (2001), then, that wording does not support&#13;\npetitioners' claim of a promise of a continued right to invest in&#13;\nthe variable annuity account program.  Instead, at most, such a&#13;\nright of contribution exists only so long as members are&#13;\npermitted to contribute to the fund.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>We do, however, perceive from that wording a different&#13;\nlegislative promise respecting the variable annuity account&#13;\nprogram that extends throughout membership in PERS.  That is, for&#13;\nany member \"who has elected to have a percentage of contributions&#13;\nso paid,\" once PERB has credited those monies to the member's&#13;\nvariable account, those contributions will be \"<i>reserved</i> for the&#13;\npurchase of a variable annuity.\"  ORS 238.260(3) (2001) (emphasis&#13;\nadded).  Stated differently, although the wording of the statute&#13;\ndoes not support a continued right to contribute to the variable&#13;\nannuity account program, the wording does evince a legislative&#13;\npromise to reserve until the time of retirement any monies that a&#13;\nmember has invested in the variable annuity account program for&#13;\nthe purchase of a variable annuity.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Turning next to context, we find little to support or&#13;\ndetract from the preliminary observations that we have gleaned&#13;\nfrom the words of ORS 238.260(3) (2001).  Again, we deem the&#13;\nactions of the 1981 Legislative Assembly to be the focal point&#13;\nfor our analysis, because it was that body that fundamentally&#13;\nrestructured the system to provide for the Full Formula benefit. &#13;\nConsistently with the comprehensive nature of the 1981&#13;\nlegislation, the legislature also added a provision to <i>former</i> ORS&#13;\n237.197 (1979), <i>renumbered as</i> 238.260(12) (1995), to account for&#13;\nthose members who had made contributions to the variable annuity&#13;\naccount program or who had made contributions on salary in excess&#13;\nof $4,800 per year between 1956 and 1967.  Or Laws 1981, ch 761,&#13;\n&#167; 6.  For such members, the legislature directed PERB to&#13;\ndetermine the difference between each member's total account&#13;\nbalance and what that total would have been had the member either&#13;\nnot participated in the variable annuity account program, not&#13;\nmade excess contributions, or both.  <i>Id.</i>  The value of the&#13;\ndifference, whether positive or negative, then resulted in either&#13;\nan increase or a decrease to the member's monthly service&#13;\nretirement allowance.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><a name=\"FNT52\">Through that amendment to what is now ORS 238.260(12),&#13;\nthe 1981 Legislative Assembly not only preserved the excess&#13;\ncontributions that some members had made before 1967 and&#13;\ncontributions to the variable annuity account program between&#13;\n1967 and 1981, but also permitted the variable annuity account&#13;\nprogram to remain as a meaningful part of the system. &#13;\n(Otherwise, absent the Money Match or the Pension Plus Annuity&#13;\nyielding a higher pension component, increases or decreases to a&#13;\nmember's variable account would serve only to increase or&#13;\ndecrease the amount that an employer would have to pay to fund&#13;\nthe pension component of the service retirement allowance under&#13;\nthe Full Formula.)  What that limited contextual evidence does&#13;\nnot suggest, however, is that the legislature promised members&#13;\nthat they would have the ability to contribute to their variable&#13;\naccounts throughout their membership in PERS.  That amendment,&#13;\ninstead, concerned only the effect that a variable account could&#13;\nhave on the service retirement allowance that a member ultimately &#13;\nwould receive at retirement.</a><a href=\"#N_52_\"><sup> (52)</sup></a>&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>In light of the foregoing discussion, we conclude that&#13;\nthere is nothing inconsistent between the earlier promise that&#13;\nthe legislature made with respect to the variable annuity account&#13;\nprogram &#8211;- that any funds placed into variable accounts would be&#13;\nreserved for the purchase of a variable annuity -&#8211; and the 2003&#13;\nLegislative Assembly's decision to discontinue permitting PERS&#13;\nmembers to contribute to their variable accounts.  Consequently,&#13;\nthere can be no breach or impairment of the obligations set out&#13;\nin the PERS contract in that respect.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>d.   Cost-of-Living Adjustments (COLAs)</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>As briefly explained earlier, both before and after the&#13;\n2003 PERS legislation, ORS 238.360 (2001) required (and still&#13;\nrequires) PERB to determine and apply annual COLAs, based on the&#13;\nConsumer Price Index (CPI), to retired PERS members' service&#13;\nretirement allowances.  However, parts of the 2003 PERS&#13;\nlegislation effectively suspend COLAs on particular service&#13;\nretirement allowances, until specified financial conditions are&#13;\nmet, for certain retired Tier One members.  The legislature took&#13;\nthat step in response to a trial court ruling in the <i>City of&#13;\nEugene</i> litigation, also described below.  <i>Strunk</i> and <i>Sartain</i>&#13;\npetitioners argue that that part of the 2003 legislation&#13;\nconstitutes either an impairment or a breach of the statutory&#13;\nPERS contract.  We address those contentions below, beginning&#13;\nwith a discussion of the <i>City of Eugene</i> litigation.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>(1)  Background</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>As discussed earlier in this opinion, the PERS statutes&#13;\nprovide for the maintenance of various reserve accounts.  Most&#13;\nsignificant to the <i>City of Eugene</i> litigation are the contingency&#13;\nreserve and the gain-loss reserve.  </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>ORS 238.670(1) describes the parameters of the&#13;\ncontingency reserve, providing that PERB \"shall set aside\" as&#13;\nmuch interest and other income received through investment as&#13;\nPERB \"may deem advisable, not exceeding seven and one-half&#13;\npercent of the combined total of such income[,]\" for the purpose&#13;\nof maintaining a contingency reserve to \"prevent any deficit of&#13;\nmoney available for the payment of retirement allowances, due to&#13;\ninterest fluctuations, changes in mortality rate or * * * other&#13;\ncontingency.\"  ORS 238.670(1).  PERB has not funded a contingency&#13;\nreserve since 1979. </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>ORS 238.255 (2001) (now ORS 238.255(1)) describes the&#13;\nparameters of the \"gain-loss reserve,\" to which PERB is required&#13;\nto charge certain amounts.  With respect to the gain-loss&#13;\nreserve, the Special Master found: </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<blockquote>&#13;\n<p>\"Before the enactment of the 2003 [PERS]&#13;\nlegislation, PER[B] maintained a 'gain-loss reserve' in&#13;\nwhich it set aside a portion of annual fund earnings to&#13;\nensure that sufficient assets would be available to pay&#13;\nguaranteed benefits at the assumed earnings rate.  In&#13;\nyears when fund earnings exceeded the guaranteed&#13;\namount, PERB deposited a portion of those funds into&#13;\nthe gain-loss reserve.  The evidence showed that it is&#13;\nreasonable to fund the gain-loss reserve at a level&#13;\nthat would fund projected Tier One guaranteed earnings&#13;\ncredits for a 30-month period, which, using the current&#13;\nassumed earnings rate of 8 percent, would set the&#13;\nreserve balance at 20 percent of the fund's value.\"</p>&#13;\n</blockquote>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>As to PERB's treatment of the gain-loss reserve and the&#13;\ncontingency reserve in the late 1990s, the Special Master found&#13;\nas follows: </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<blockquote>&#13;\n<p>\"In 1999, the fund earned approximately $7.5&#13;\nbillion, or 24.89 percent of its value.  [PERB credited&#13;\n20 percent to Tier One regular accounts for that year.] &#13;\nPERB allocated approximately $1.3 billion to the gain-loss reserve, which left it funded at approximately 72&#13;\npercent of [its] new 30-month goal.  After PERB&#13;\nallocated 1999 earnings, the gain-loss reserve had a&#13;\npositive balance of $4.744 billion.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><a name=\"FNT53\">\"If PERB had fully funded the contingency reserve&#13;\nfor 1999 by crediting 7.5 percent of the fund's&#13;\nearnings as authorized by ORS 238.670(1) and, if PERB&#13;\nhad fully funded the gain-loss reserve according to its&#13;\n30-month goal, approximately 11.33 percent would have&#13;\nbeen available for crediting to Tier One&#13;\naccounts.\"</a><a href=\"#N_53_\"><sup> (53)</sup></a>&#13;\n</p></blockquote>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The funding gap created by PERB's choice not to fund&#13;\nthe two accounts fully, as the Special Master described it, meant&#13;\nthat an imbalance existed that PERB sought to make up through&#13;\nassessments -- <i>i.e.</i>, contribution rate orders -- on employers. &#13;\nIn response to those assessments, three local government&#13;\nemployers, including the City of Eugene, challenged their 1998&#13;\nand 2000 contribution rate orders by filing an action against&#13;\nPERB in Marion County Circuit Court.  Several employers also&#13;\nchallenged PERB's order allocating 1999 earnings.  In part, the&#13;\nemployers argued that their contribution rates would have been&#13;\nlower if PERB properly had funded the contingency and gain-loss&#13;\nreserves.  All the challenges were consolidated and became the&#13;\n<i>City of Eugene</i> litigation.  Several PERS members intervened in&#13;\nthe litigation to defend PERB's crediting decisions respecting&#13;\ntheir regular accounts.  </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>In July 2001, the trial court held that PERB had abused&#13;\nits discretion by not funding the contingency reserve since 1979. &#13;\nThe court further held that PERB had abused its discretion by&#13;\ncrediting 20 percent interest to Tier One members' regular&#13;\naccounts in 1999, instead of properly funding the contingency and&#13;\ngain-loss reserves.  The court remanded the challenged rate&#13;\norders to PERB with instructions that PERB issue new rate orders&#13;\nconsistently with the court's judgment.  PERB and intervenors&#13;\nappealed that judgment to the Court of Appeals, which transferred&#13;\nthe litigation to this court pursuant to Oregon Laws 2003,&#13;\nchapter 537, section 1, where it is now pending.    </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><a name=\"FNT54\">Pursuant to the trial court's judgment, the Fiscal&#13;\nServices Division (FSD) of PERS recalculated the credits to Tier&#13;\nOne members' regular accounts for 1999 and concluded that, if&#13;\nPERB properly had funded the contingency and gain-loss reserves&#13;\nin 1999, the appropriate credit to members' regular accounts for&#13;\nthat year would have been 11.33 percent.  Before FSD presented&#13;\nthat figure to PERB for final approval, however, the legislature&#13;\nrequested that information directly from FSD.  The legislature&#13;\nsubsequently enacted the 2003 PERS legislation.  Oregon Laws&#13;\n2003, chapter 67, sections 9 and 10, <i>as amended by</i> Oregon Laws&#13;\n2003, chapter 625, section 13, effectively codifying the 11.33&#13;\npercent figure as the correct 1999 crediting decision.</a><a href=\"#N_54_\"><sup> (54)</sup></a>&#13;\n  </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>After the legislature enacted Oregon Laws 2003, chapter&#13;\n67, PERB and the employer parties entered into a settlement&#13;\nagreement purporting to resolve the <i>City of Eugene</i> litigation. &#13;\nThat settlement agreement provided, in part:</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<blockquote>&#13;\n<p>\"[E]xcept in the event of a supervening change in law&#13;\n(such as by a legislative enactment or further court&#13;\norder):</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>\"* * * * *</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>\"1.3 The new 1999 earnings allocation order * * *  will&#13;\nprovide that the appropriate earnings allocation&#13;\nto Tier [One] regular member accounts is 11.33&#13;\n[percent], that 7.5 [percent] of the 1999 earnings&#13;\nshould have been allocated to the contingency&#13;\nreserve established by ORS 238.670(1), and that&#13;\nthe gain-loss reserve created by ORS 238.670(3)&#13;\nshould have been funded to the full extent of the&#13;\nformer PERB's policy to maintain a gain-loss&#13;\nreserve sufficient to credit the assumed interest&#13;\nrate to Tier [One] regular member accounts during&#13;\na period of 30 months of 0 [percent] earnings.\"  </p>&#13;\n</blockquote>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>After entering into that settlement agreement, PERB moved to&#13;\ndismiss the appeal, but intervenors opposed that motion, and this&#13;\ncourt denied it without prejudice.  As a result of the court&#13;\nchallenges to PERB's 1999 crediting decision, that decision was&#13;\npotentially subject to reversal at the time that the legislature&#13;\nenacted Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, sections 9 and 10, <i>as&#13;\namended by</i> Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 625, section 13.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, sections 9 and 10, <i>as&#13;\namended by</i> Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 625, section 13, apply to&#13;\nonly Tier One members who receive service retirement allowances&#13;\npursuant to the Money Match and who retired on or after April 1,&#13;\n2000, but before April 1, 2004.  As pertinent here, section 10,&#13;\n<i>as amended by</i> Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 625, section 13, requires&#13;\nPERB to recalculate two alternative service retirement allowances&#13;\nfor those members, resulting in a \"revised\" allowance and a&#13;\n\"fixed\" allowance.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>To calculate the \"revised\" service retirement&#13;\nallowance, PERB first must recalculate the affected members'&#13;\nregular account balances as if 11.33 percent, rather than 20&#13;\npercent, had been credited in 1999.  PERB then must recalculate&#13;\nthe members' service retirement allowances based on those newly&#13;\ncalculated account balances and apply the appropriate COLAs for&#13;\neach calendar year since each member's retirement to the newly&#13;\ncalculated service retirement allowance.  As a result of those&#13;\ncalculations, PERB will have determined a new service retirement&#13;\nallowance for each affected member as of the date of the&#13;\ncalculation, based on an 11.33 percent credit to each member's&#13;\nregular account in 1999 (<i>i.e.</i>, the \"revised\" service retirement&#13;\nallowance).

They particularly argue, as pertinent here, that ORS&#13;\n238.360 (2001), which required PERB to provide retired members&#13;\nwith annual COLAs on their monthly service retirement allowances,&#13;\nis a term of the PERS contract.  ORS 238.360 (2001) provided, in&#13;\npart:</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<blockquote>&#13;\n<p>\"(1)  As soon as practicable after January 1 each&#13;\nyear, [PERB] shall determine the percentage increase or&#13;\ndecrease in the cost-of-living for the previous&#13;\ncalendar year, based on the Consumer Price Index * * *. &#13;\nPrior to July 1 each year the allowance which the&#13;\nmember or the member's beneficiary is receiving or is&#13;\nentitled to receive on August 1 for the month of July&#13;\nshall be multiplied by the percentage figure&#13;\ndetermined, and the allowance for the next 12 months&#13;\nbeginning July 1 adjusted to the resultant amount.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>\"(2)  Such increase or decrease shall not exceed&#13;\ntwo percent of any monthly retirement allowance in any&#13;\nyear and no allowance shall be adjusted to an amount&#13;\nless than the amount to which the recipient would be&#13;\nentitled if no cost-of-living adjustment were&#13;\nauthorized.\"</p>&#13;\n</blockquote>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><i>Strunk</i> and <i>Sartain</i> petitioners argue that, contrary to Oregon&#13;\nLaws 2003, chapter 67, section 10(3), <i>as amended by</i> Oregon Laws&#13;\n2003, chapter 625, section 13, which calculates a \"fixed\" service&#13;\nretirement allowance that is not subject to an annual COLA, ORS&#13;\n238.360(1) (2001) required PERB to provide COLAs on <i>all</i> service&#13;\nretirement allowances.  In other words, <i>Strunk</i> and <i>Sartain</i>&#13;\npetitioners assert that affected Tier One members who are&#13;\nreceiving \"fixed\" service retirement allowances under the 2003&#13;\nPERS legislation have a contractual right to receive annual COLAs&#13;\non those allowances, even though the allowances were based on a&#13;\nregular account balance that, in the legislature's determination,&#13;\nincluded an erroneous 20 percent credit in 1999.  They argue&#13;\nthat, when a member has performed fully under the PERS contract&#13;\nin reliance on the promise set out in ORS 238.360(1) (2001), that&#13;\nmember's rights have vested and the legislature may not take away&#13;\nCOLAs without breaching the PERS contract or unconstitutionally&#13;\nimpairing an obligation of that contract.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Respondents acknowledge that the affected Tier One&#13;\nmembers have performed fully and are entitled to receive service&#13;\nretirement allowances that are calculated based on amounts&#13;\n<i>properly</i> credited to their regular accounts.  They argue,&#13;\nhowever, that petitioners seek more than that.  Petitioners,&#13;\nrespondents claim, are asserting that they have a contractual&#13;\nright to receive service retirement allowances that reflect an&#13;\n<i>improper</i> credit of 20 percent in 1999.  The PERS statutes,&#13;\nrespondents argue, do not grant petitioners the right to&#13;\n<i>erroneously</i> credited earnings.  In fact, they assert, another&#13;\nstatute -- ORS 238.715 (which we discuss in greater detail below)&#13;\n-- authorizes PERB to recover the over-credited amounts from&#13;\npetitioners, even though they are retired.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><a name=\"FNT56\">Respondents also observe that, in addition to setting&#13;\nout specific avenues for recouping overpayments, ORS 238.715(8)&#13;\nallows PERB to use \"any other remedies that may be available to&#13;\n[it] for recovery of amounts incorrectly paid from the&#13;\nfund[.]\"</a><a href=\"#N_56_\"><sup> (56)</sup></a>&#13;\n  Respondents argue that, in enacting Oregon Laws&#13;\n2003, chapter 67, section 10, <i>as amended by</i> Oregon Laws 2003,&#13;\nchapter 625, section 13, the legislature has provided PERB with&#13;\n\"other remedies\" for recouping the erroneously credited earnings. &#13;\n</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>(3)  Discussion</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><a name=\"FNT57\">Before turning to our analysis of petitioners' claims,&#13;\nwe think it helpful to clarify the precise nature of our inquiry&#13;\nhere.  First, no party appears to dispute that, in creating the&#13;\n\"fixed\" service retirement allowance coupled with the suspension&#13;\nof an annual COLA, the legislature's intent was to recoup what it&#13;\ndeemed to be overpayments to the affected members' regular&#13;\naccounts in 1999.</a><a href=\"#N_57_\"><sup> (57)</sup></a>&#13;\n  Second, as discussed below, respondents&#13;\nnote that the PERS statutes contemplate that PERB erroneously&#13;\nmight pay certain amounts to a member who already has retired and&#13;\nthat PERB generally is permitted, as a statutory matter, to&#13;\nrecoup erroneous payments.  And, third, as respondents appear to&#13;\nsuggest, <i>Strunk</i> and <i>Sartain</i> petitioners' <i>particular</i> contractual&#13;\nchallenges to the COLA suspension in Oregon Laws 2003, chapter&#13;\n67, section 10(3), in essence raise the question whether the&#13;\nlegislature's choice <i>to preclude application of annual COLAs on&#13;\nfixed retirement allowances</i> was a permissible method of&#13;\nfacilitating such a recoupment.  Stated differently, by directing&#13;\nPERB to suspend annual COLAs on fixed retirement allowances, does&#13;\nthe 2003 PERS legislation either impair or breach PERB's&#13;\nobligation to apply annual COLAs under ORS 238.360 (2001)?</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>As with our analysis of the foregoing challenged&#13;\naspects of the 2003 PERS legislation, we first determine whether&#13;\nORS 238.360 constituted a term of the PERS statutory contract&#13;\nbefore the enactment of the 2003 legislation.

The legislature enacted that statute in 1971,&#13;\nand its substance has remained unchanged, notwithstanding other&#13;\ninterim amendments.  <i>See</i> <i>former</i> ORS 237.060(1) (1971), <i>renumbered&#13;\nas</i> ORS 238.360 (1995) (setting out original statute). </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>ORS 238.360(1), as it existed in 2001 and as presently&#13;\nworded, provides that PERS members' monthly service retirement&#13;\nallowances annually shall be adjusted to reflect \"the percentage&#13;\nincrease or decrease in the cost of living for the previous&#13;\ncalendar year[.]\"  Like the tax provision analyzed in <i>Hughes</i>, the&#13;\ntext of ORS 238.360(1) (2001) evinces a clear legislative intent&#13;\nto provide retired members with annual COLAs on their service&#13;\nretirement allowances, whenever the CPI warrants such COLAs.  We&#13;\ntherefore conclude that the general promise embodied in ORS&#13;\n238.360(1) (2001) was part of the statutory PERS contract&#13;\napplicable to the group of retired members affected by the 2003&#13;\nprovisions at issue here.  Having so concluded, we now must&#13;\ndetermine the extent of that promise.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>We return to the wording of the statute and,&#13;\nspecifically, the requirement that, prior to July 1 each year,&#13;\n\"the <i>allowance</i> which the member or the member's beneficiary <i>is&#13;\nreceiving or is entitled to receive</i>\" on August 1 for the month of&#13;\nJuly must be subject to a COLA.  ORS 238.360(1) (2001) (emphasis&#13;\nadded).  The context of ORS 238.360(1) (2001), which includes&#13;\nother related statutes, <i>PGE</i>, 317 Or at 611, assists our reading&#13;\nof the emphasized wording.  As noted earlier, ORS 238.715 (2001)&#13;\nprovided, in part:</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<blockquote>&#13;\n<p>\"(1) <i>If [PERB] determines that a member</i> of the&#13;\nsystem or any other person receiving a monthly payment&#13;\nfrom the * * * [f]und <i>has received any amount in excess&#13;\nof the amounts that the member or other person is&#13;\nentitled to under this chapter</i>, [PERB] may recover the&#13;\noverpayment or other improperly made payment by:</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>\"(a) Reducing the monthly payment to the member or&#13;\nother person for as many months as may be determined by&#13;\n[PERB] to be necessary to recover the overpayment or&#13;\nother improperly made payment; or</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>\"(b) Reducing the monthly payment to the member or&#13;\nother person by an amount actuarially determined to be&#13;\nadequate to recover the overpayment or other improperly&#13;\nmade payment during the period during which the monthly&#13;\npayment will be made to the member or other person.\"</p>&#13;\n</blockquote>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>(Emphasis added.)  As is apparent from the text of ORS 238.715(1)&#13;\n(2001), the legislature has anticipated that PERB might pay&#13;\namounts from the fund in error -- that is, a member (or other&#13;\nperson, such as a beneficiary) might be paid more from the fund&#13;\nthan that member is \"entitled\" to \"receive[]\" under the PERS&#13;\nstatutes.  And, in the event that such an overpayment occurs, the&#13;\nlegislature further has provided that PERB may recover that&#13;\noverpayment.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>In light of the identical wording in ORS 238.360 (2001)&#13;\nand ORS 238.715(1) (2001), regarding allowances that a member is &#13;\n\"entitled to receive\" and amounts \"received\" that exceed those to&#13;\nwhich a member is \"entitled,\" we conclude that the promise set&#13;\nout in ORS 238.360(1) (2001) respecting the application of annual&#13;\nCOLAs does not extend to erroneous overpayments included in a&#13;\nmember's service retirement allowance that the member was not&#13;\nentitled to receive.  However, the promise does extend to&#13;\nproperly calculated service retirement allowances.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Having defined the scope of the legislature's promise,&#13;\nwe turn to the 2003 PERS legislation to determine whether -- and,&#13;\nif so, to what extent -- it is inconsistent with that promise. &#13;\nAs explained earlier, Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, section 10,&#13;\n<i>as amended by</i> Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 625, section 13, provides&#13;\nthat the original service retirement allowances for retired Tier&#13;\nOne members who are affected by that section shall be&#13;\nrecalculated in two ways, resulting in a \"revised\" service&#13;\nretirement allowance and an alternative \"fixed\" service&#13;\nretirement allowance.  As also noted above, the \"revised\" service&#13;\nretirement allowance continues to be subject to an annual COLA&#13;\nunder ORS 238.360(1).  The \"fixed\" service retirement allowance&#13;\nis set at the amount that was payable to the retired member as of&#13;\nJuly 1, 2003, or as of the member's retirement date, whichever is&#13;\nlater, and is not subject to an annual COLA under ORS 238.360(1). &#13;\nThe crux of the question before us, then, is whether the \"fixed\"&#13;\nservice retirement allowance calculated under Oregon Laws 2003,&#13;\nchapter 67, section 10(3), <i>as amended by</i> Oregon Laws 2003,&#13;\nchapter 625, section 13, either does or does not qualify as an&#13;\nallowance that is subject to an annual COLA under ORS 238.360(1)&#13;\n(2001).  Stated more specifically, does the \"fixed\" service&#13;\nretirement allowance represent payment of an \"allowance\" that the&#13;\nmember was not \"entitled to receive?\"</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The answer to that question is no.  It is true that the&#13;\nlegislature's apparent intent in creating the \"fixed\" service&#13;\nretirement allowance -- most notably, when coupled with&#13;\nelimination of any otherwise applicable COLA -- was to allow PERB&#13;\nto recoup certain amounts credited to the affected members'&#13;\naccounts in 1999 (and which the 2003 Legislative Assembly deemed&#13;\nto be overpayments).  However, the \"fixed\" service retirement&#13;\nallowance <i>itself</i> represents a <i>determined allowance</i> -- that is, an&#13;\nallowance expressly determined by the legislature.  In light of&#13;\nthat legislative determination, the \"fixed\" service retirement&#13;\nallowance cannot be said to transfer to the affected member any&#13;\nfunds to which the member (again, in the legislature's&#13;\ndetermination) was not entitled.  As such, the \"fixed\" service&#13;\nretirement allowance falls within the scope of the promise set&#13;\nout in ORS 238.360(1) (2001) -- that is, that PERB annually apply&#13;\na COLA to each affected member's allowance (in years in which the&#13;\nCPI warrants such a COLA) -- because the allowance represents&#13;\nfunds that the member, by legislative determination, is \"entitled&#13;\nto receive.\"</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>We therefore conclude that the elimination of annual&#13;\nCOLAs from the \"fixed\" service retirement allowance, as set out&#13;\nin Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, section 10(3), is inconsistent&#13;\nwith the legislature's promise set out in ORS 238.360(1) (2001). &#13;\nHaving done so, we next must determine whether that inconsistency&#13;\namounts to a breach or an impairment of that obligation under the&#13;\nPERS contract.  As to that question, this court's decision in&#13;\n<i>Eckles</i>, 306 Or 380, is instructive.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>As explained earlier, <i>Eckles</i> involved legislation that&#13;\nhad transferred surplus funds from the IAF -- which, by statute,&#13;\nwere to be used for only workers' compensation purposes -- to the&#13;\nGeneral Fund.  There, as here, the legislature's intent in&#13;\ntransferring the funds had been to attain a legislative goal&#13;\nthat, generally speaking, appeared legitimate and was not in&#13;\ndispute (in <i>Eckles</i>, avoiding a state budget deficit).  However,&#13;\nit was the legislature's method for attaining that goal that, in&#13;\nthe court's determination in <i>Eckles</i>, had contractual implications&#13;\nfor the state.  Specifically, the court concluded that the part&#13;\nof the legislation that had <i>eliminated</i> the state's obligation to&#13;\nuse IAF funds in the statutorily specified manner constituted an&#13;\nunconstitutional impairment of the state's contractual&#13;\nobligation.  306 Or at 399.  The court further concluded that the&#13;\npart of the legislation that had directed the transfer of funds&#13;\n<i>amounted to a mandate that the state breach the contract</i>.  <i>Id.</i> at&#13;\n400.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><a name=\"FNT58\">Applying <i>Eckles</i> to the statutory contractual issue&#13;\nbefore us now, it is indisputable that the promise set out in ORS&#13;\n238.360(1) (2001) respecting annual COLAs remains part of the&#13;\nPERS statutory scheme applicable to the affected group of retired&#13;\nmembers.  However, by precluding application of annual COLAs to&#13;\n\"fixed\" service retirement allowances determined for those&#13;\naffected members, Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, section 10(3),&#13;\namounts to a directive from the legislature to PERB to breach the&#13;\npromise set out in ORS 238.360(1) (2001) with respect to those&#13;\nmembers.  We conclude, as petitioners contend, that that aspect&#13;\nof the 2003 PERS legislation breaches a term of the PERS&#13;\ncontract.  <i>See</i> <i>Eckles</i>, 306 Or at 400-02 (so explaining in similar&#13;\ncircumstances); <i>see also</i> <i>Hughes</i>, 314 Or at 32-33 (same).</a><a href=\"#N_58_\"><sup> (58)</sup></a>&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><a name=\"FNT59\">Having so concluded, we now must address as a final&#13;\nmatter the disposition of petitioners' claims for relief&#13;\nrespecting the above-described COLA provisions of the 2003 PERS&#13;\nlegislation.  As explained, Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, section&#13;\n10(3), breaches the PERS contract by directing PERB not to&#13;\nprovide annual COLAs on \"fixed\" service retirement allowances. &#13;\nNormally, this court leaves to the legislature, as the \"most&#13;\nappropriate branch of government in the first instance,\" <i>Hughes</i>,&#13;\n314 Or at 33 n 36, the choice as to which remedy to select when&#13;\nlegislation breaches a statutory contract.  Here, however, under&#13;\nwhat we deem to be unique circumstances, we conclude that the&#13;\nprudent dispositional action is to invalidate the offending&#13;\nstatutory wording.  Accordingly, we declare that part of Oregon&#13;\nLaws 2003, chapter 67, section 10(3), that provides, \"[t]he fixed&#13;\nservice retirement allowance may not be adjusted under ORS&#13;\n238.360,\" to be void.  The effect of our choice to declare that&#13;\npart of the law to be void is that petitioners will be returned &#13;\n-- at least for the time being -- to the same position in which&#13;\nthey would have been if the legislature had not enacted the COLA&#13;\nsuspension.</a><a href=\"#N_59_\"><sup> (59)</sup></a>&#13;\n   </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>e.  Actuarial Equivalency Factors</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>As noted earlier in this opinion and as explained more&#13;\nfully below, part of the 2003 PERS legislation modifies the&#13;\ncalculation of service retirement allowances for certain PERS&#13;\nmembers who entered the system before 1999, by adopting new&#13;\nactuarial equivalency factors (AEFs).  All petitioners challenge&#13;\nthat part of the legislation, as discussed below.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>(1) Background</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>We take the following description of PERB's approach&#13;\ntoward AEFs from the Special Master's report:</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<blockquote>&#13;\n<p><a name=\"FNT60\">\"From time to time, after consulting with its&#13;\nactuary,<sup>[</sup></a><a href=\"#N_60_\"><sup> (60)</sup></a>&#13;\n<sup>]</sup> PERB has adopted AEFs for use in the&#13;\nadministration of the fund.  AEFs are based on&#13;\nassumptions concerning the future earnings of the fund&#13;\nand members' expected mortality rates.  AEFs are used&#13;\nto convert lump sum account balances to monthly payment&#13;\nstreams and to change one optional benefit payment form&#13;\nto another.  When converting a lump sum to a monthly&#13;\nbenefit, the lump sum and the monthly benefit payments&#13;\nare actuarially equivalent if both forms of payment&#13;\nhave the same present value.  Two of the three types of&#13;\nPERS retirement benefits--Money Match and Pension Plus&#13;\nAnnuity--are calculated based on AEFs.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>\"Before 1978, PERB used a substantial number of&#13;\nAEF tables that applied to particular categories of&#13;\nmembers.  In 1978, PERB adopted two simplified sets of&#13;\nactuarial tables, one each for male and female members. &#13;\nThe tables for female members produced a lower monthly&#13;\nretirement allowance, because they assumed that females&#13;\nwould, on average, have longer life spans after&#13;\nretirement than males.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><a name=\"FNT61\">\"In <i>Henderson v. State</i>, U.S. District Court Case&#13;\nNo. CV74-538, the court concluded that the use of&#13;\nseparate gender-based calculations was&#13;\nunlawful.<sup>[</sup></a><a href=\"#N_61_\"><sup> (61)</sup></a>&#13;\n<sup>]</sup>  In 1978, PERB adopted the male-only&#13;\nactuarial factors for all PERS members.  That process&#13;\ncommonly was referred to as 'topping up' the AEF&#13;\ntables.  The topped-up tables increased employer&#13;\ncontribution rates by 0.49 percent.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>\"In 1978, PERB adopted a 7 percent assumed&#13;\nearnings rate for the fund.  In 1979, PERB increased&#13;\nthe assumed earnings rate to 7.5 percent.  However, it&#13;\ndid not change the system's AEFs because (1) the&#13;\nactuary determined that members generally were living&#13;\nlonger after retirement; and (2) new actuarial factors&#13;\nwould have blended assumed male and female mortality&#13;\nrates and, therefore, would have been lower than those&#13;\nproduced by the use of male-only tables.  PERB did not&#13;\nchange its AEFs again until 1989.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>\"When PERB increased the assumed earnings rate to&#13;\n8 percent in 1989, it also adopted revised mortality&#13;\ntables.  The revised AEFs were a combination of the&#13;\npre-existing 7 percent earnings and 1978 male-only&#13;\nmortality assumptions, and new 8 percent earnings and&#13;\n1989 blended male/female mortality assumptions.  PERB&#13;\nused the new factors only if they increased member&#13;\nbenefits; otherwise, PERB used the preexisting factors.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>\"In 1993, PERB adopted [<i>former</i>] OAR 459-05-055&#13;\n[(1993)].

The actuary also explained in a July 1995&#13;\nletter to PERB that the factors that PERB intended to adopt&#13;\npursuant to <i>former</i> OAR 459-05-055 (1993) would not serve to&#13;\nachieve \"'true actuarial equivalenc[y]' because of the&#13;\ngrandfathering of higher benefit factors over the years[.]\"  </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>In 1996, PERB both renumbered and amended <i>former</i> OAR&#13;\n459-05-055 (1993) (set out in part above) to provide that AEFs&#13;\nwould be updated for only members who joined PERS after January&#13;\n1, 1999.

At that time, PERB adopted a policy of using&#13;\nfactors based on current mortality assumptions if the&#13;\nfactors adequately protected benefits previously earned&#13;\nunder former AEFs.  PERB reviewed various options for&#13;\nprotecting accrued benefits, but it had not completed&#13;\nthat process when it became apparent that the 2003&#13;\nlegislature intended to enact legislation on the same&#13;\nsubject.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><a name=\"FNT63\">\"In sum, before the 2003 legislation was enacted,&#13;\nPERB generally used AEFs that had been in effect since&#13;\n1978 and that did not match the assumptions that the&#13;\nactuary used to value the system and make projections&#13;\nabout system costs.  Those factors understated the life&#13;\nexpectancy of PERS members.  When they were used to&#13;\nconvert a member's account balance to a monthly&#13;\nallowance, the aggregate value of the monthly allowance&#13;\nwas higher than the value of the account balance. &#13;\nTherefore, unless additional funds were contributed to&#13;\nthe system, the account balance would have dissipated&#13;\nbefore the member's average life expectancy was&#13;\nreached.  Put another way, because the AEFs did not&#13;\nmatch the actuary's life expectancy assumptions for the&#13;\nsystem, the amount available to pay the BIF<sup>[<a href=\"#N_63_\"><sup> (63)</sup></a>&#13;\n]</sup> upon&#13;\na member's retirement was, other things being equal,&#13;\ninsufficient to cover the projected costs for that&#13;\nmember.

As more members retired under the Money&#13;\nMatch and the amount of their benefits increased, the&#13;\nfinancial impact of using outdated factors also grew. &#13;\nIn 2002, the actuary estimated that the immediate use&#13;\nof updated mortality tables would decrease employer&#13;\ncontribution rates by approximately 2.28 percent of&#13;\npayroll.\"</p>&#13;\n</blockquote>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>(Footnote omitted.)</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 68, section 2, requires PERB&#13;\nto adopt current actuarial equivalency factor tables that \"use&#13;\nthe best actuarial information on mortality available at the time&#13;\n[PERB] adopts the tables[.]\"  Those tables become effective on&#13;\nJanuary 1 of the calendar year following PERB's adoption of the&#13;\nnew tables.  <i>Id.</i></p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Further, Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 68, section 4, <i>as&#13;\namended by</i> Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, section 40, and Oregon&#13;\nLaws 2003, chapter 625, section 16, modifies the calculation for&#13;\nthe annuity component of the service retirement allowance for&#13;\ncertain members who entered the system before 1999. &#13;\nSpecifically, such members who retired (or will retire) on or&#13;\nafter July 1, 2003, will have their annuity components calculated&#13;\nunder the new legislation, which directs PERB to use one of two&#13;\ncalculations, whichever produces the greater benefit.

They rely&#13;\nprimarily on OAR 459-005-0055(5) (1996), which, as quoted above,&#13;\nprovided:</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<blockquote>&#13;\n<p><a name=\"FNT64\">\"Notwithstanding subsection (4)(b) of this&#13;\nrule,<sup>[<a href=\"#N_64_\"><sup> (64)</sup></a>&#13;\n]</sup> for members who established membership in&#13;\nPERS before January 1, 1999, as described in Oregon&#13;\nLaws 1995, Chapter 654, Section 2, [PERB] shall not&#13;\nchange a factor that would produce a lower periodic or&#13;\nsingle benefit payment, and any change of factor(s)&#13;\nshall apply to the total allowance payable.\"</a></p>&#13;\n</blockquote>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>They assert that, because PERB is the trustee of the fund and has&#13;\nbeen granted authority to adopt rules governing administration of&#13;\nthe fund, the foregoing rule is a term of the PERS statutory&#13;\ncontract.  As such, they argue that the legislature may not&#13;\nremove that term by requiring PERB to calculate annuity&#13;\ncomponents using updated AEFs, the likely effect of which will be&#13;\nto reduce their service retirement allowances.  </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>As support for that contention, petitioners argue that&#13;\nORS 238.630(3)(g) (2001), a predecessor version of which is&#13;\ndiscussed further below, gave PERB \"the absolute authority\" to&#13;\nestablish the system's actuarial factors (specifically, those in&#13;\neffect since 1978) and required that such factors \"shall&#13;\nconstitute part of the system.\"  They further argue that ORS&#13;\n238.650(2) (2001), which provided that \"[a]ll rules adopted by&#13;\n[PERB] become part of the written plan document of [PERS],\"&#13;\nreinforces their contractual right to enforce the terms of OAR&#13;\n459-005-0055(5) (1996).  Because Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 68,&#13;\nsection 4, <i>as amended by</i> Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, section&#13;\n40, and Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 625, section 16, nullifies the&#13;\neffect of that rule, petitioners argue, it breaches the PERS&#13;\ncontract and impairs obligations of the contract.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Petitioner Dahlin presents the same argument, but adds&#13;\na \"federal law\" analysis premised on his observation that PERB&#13;\nmust maintain the fund's tax status under the IRC.  His analysis&#13;\nis designed to illustrate that the incorporation of updated AEFs&#13;\nwill violate provisions of the IRC, jeopardize the fund's tax&#13;\nstatus, and therefore violate petitioners' contractual rights.  </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>For their part, respondents first observe that the PERS&#13;\nstatutes require AEFs to yield service retirement allowances that&#13;\nare the \"'actuarial equivalent' of members' account balances.\" &#13;\nYet petitioners, in respondents' view, assert a contractual right&#13;\nto the use of outdated factors that, by definition, cannot&#13;\nproduce actuarial equivalency.  To support that argument,&#13;\nrespondents cite ORS 238.630(3)(g) (2001), which required PERB to&#13;\nadopt new AEFs from \"time to time\" that, once applied, will&#13;\ncalculate the \"actuarial equivalen[t] of optional forms of&#13;\nretirement allowances,\" and ORS 238.300(1) (2001), which required&#13;\n(and still requires) \"actuarial equivalen[cy]\" in converting each&#13;\nmember's account balances at retirement into the annuity&#13;\ncomponent of the member's service retirement allowance.     </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Respondents further dismiss the validity of OAR 459-005-0055(5) (1996) by observing that that rule departs from the&#13;\naforementioned legislative mandates.  Finally, respondents&#13;\nobserve that the 2003 \"look-back\" calculation preserves the&#13;\nservice retirement allowances that members would have received&#13;\nhad PERB calculated their annuity components using the factors&#13;\nand account balances in place the day before the 2003 PERS&#13;\nlegislation went into effect.  Thus, they argue, Oregon Laws&#13;\n2003, chapter 68, section 4, <i>as amended by</i> Oregon Laws 2003,&#13;\nchapter 67, section 40, and Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 625,&#13;\nsection 16, does not reduce retroactively the service retirement&#13;\nallowances to which members are entitled. </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>(3)  Discussion</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>As an initial matter, we briefly dispose of petitioner&#13;\nDahlin's separate IRC-based claims.  First, addressing fully&#13;\nthose IRC-based claims would require an analysis of specific IRC&#13;\nprovisions.  IRC section 7476(a), however, confers jurisdiction&#13;\nto determine retirement plan qualification to the United States&#13;\nTax Court.  It follows that engaging in the analysis that&#13;\npetitioner Dahlin's IRC-based claims require would be outside the&#13;\nscope of our jurisdiction.  We therefore reject petitioner&#13;\nDahlin's IRC-based claims without further discussion.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Turning to the other challenges, our analysis again&#13;\nmust begin with determining the specific terms of the PERS&#13;\nstatutory contract. </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><i>Former</i> ORS 237.251(3)(g) (1991), <i>renumbered as</i> ORS&#13;\n238.630(3)(g) (1995), which initially provided the basis for&#13;\nPERB's adoption of the rule that became OAR 459-005-0055 (1996),&#13;\nprovided:  </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<blockquote>&#13;\n<p><a name=\"FNT65\">\"[PERB] [s]hall determine the actuarial equivalency of&#13;\noptional forms of retirement allowances and establish&#13;\nfrom time to time for that purpose the necessary&#13;\nactuarial factors, which shall constitute a part of the&#13;\nsystem[.]\"</a><a href=\"#N_65_\"><sup> (65)</sup></a>&#13;\n</p></blockquote>&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><a name=\"FNT66\">We again apply the <i>PGE</i> methodology, 317 Or at 610-12, to the&#13;\nstatute to ascertain the legislature's intent and conclude that&#13;\nthe legislature's intent is clear from the first level of&#13;\nanalysis.  As respondents argue, <i>former</i> ORS 237.251(3)(g) (1991)&#13;\nset out a legislative mandate that PERB periodically perform two&#13;\ntasks:  first, to determine the \"actuarial equivalency of&#13;\noptional forms of retirement allowances\"; and, second, to&#13;\n\"establish[,] from time to time[,] for [the purpose of&#13;\ndetermining the actuarial equivalency of optional forms of&#13;\nretirement allowances,] the necessary actuarial factors, which&#13;\nshall constitute a part of the system[.]\"  <i>Former</i> ORS&#13;\n237.251(3)(g) (1991) therefore required PERB periodically to&#13;\nupdate its actuarial factors to ensure that service retirement&#13;\nallowances ultimately paid, regardless of the form of those&#13;\nallowances,</a><a href=\"#N_66_\"><sup> (66)</sup></a>&#13;\n satisfied an \"actual equivalency\" standard.  </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Similarly, <i>former</i> ORS 237.147 (1991) <i>renumbered as</i> ORS&#13;\n238.300(1) (1995), provided, in part, that the annuity component&#13;\nof each member's service retirement allowance \"shall be the&#13;\nactuarial equivalent\" of each member's \"accumulated contributions&#13;\n* * * at the time of retirement.\"  In short, both statutes&#13;\nclearly indicate that the legislature intended for members'&#13;\nservice retirement allowances to satisfy an \"actuarial&#13;\nequivalency\" standard.  The legislature delegated that&#13;\nresponsibility, which included updating the system's actuarial&#13;\nfactors, to PERB.  </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><a name=\"FNT67\">The PERS statutes did not define the term \"actuarial&#13;\nequivalent\" at the time that PERB adopted <i>former</i> OAR 459-05-055&#13;\n(1993), <i>renumbered as</i> OAR 459-005-0055 (1996); that term remained&#13;\nundefined until 2003.</a><a href=\"#N_67_\"><sup> (67)</sup></a>&#13;\n  The PERS actuary, however,&#13;\ntestified consistently with the following explanation of the&#13;\nterm, as set out in the Special Master's report:</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<blockquote>&#13;\n<p>\"AEFs are based on assumptions concerning the future&#13;\nearnings of the fund and members' expected mortality&#13;\nrates.  AEFs are used to convert lump sum account&#13;\nbalances to monthly payment streams and to change one&#13;\noptional benefit payment form to another.  <i>When&#13;\nconverting a lump sum to a monthly benefit, the lump&#13;\nsum and the monthly benefit payments are actuarially&#13;\nequivalent if both forms of payment have the same&#13;\npresent value</i>.\"</p>&#13;\n</blockquote>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>(Emphasis added.)  That definition suggests that the concept of&#13;\nactuarial equivalency, as it relates to these cases, is concerned&#13;\nwith substituting equally one form of payment for another -- that&#13;\nis, a lump sum representing a member's total service retirement&#13;\nallowance for a stream of payments over time derived from that&#13;\nsum.  In addition, it is clear that, if mortality rates improve,&#13;\nmembers' monthly allowances would decrease if AEFs properly are&#13;\nupdated to reflect those improvements.  </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><a name=\"FNT68\">PERB, however, has adopted a rule that essentially&#13;\nrenders the AEFs static.  OAR 459-005-0055(5) (1996) provided&#13;\nthat, for certain members,</a><a href=\"#N_68_\"><sup> (68)</sup></a>&#13;\n \"[PERB] shall not change a&#13;\nfactor that would produce a lower periodic or single benefit&#13;\npayment.\"  That text effectively states that, even if the PERS&#13;\nactuary recommended that PERB update the AEFs to reflect improved&#13;\nmortality assumptions, PERB would not do so if it would result in&#13;\nlower monthly service retirement allowances for certain members. &#13;\nIndeed, the PERS actuary testified before the Special Master that&#13;\nPERB had declined to update the AEFs notwithstanding his warning&#13;\nthat the PERB-applied AEFs were not producing actuarially&#13;\nequivalent benefits (as <i>former</i> ORS 237.251(3)(g) (1991) and&#13;\n<i>former</i> ORS 237.147(1) (1991) required) and his advice that PERB&#13;\nnot adopt OAR XXX-XX-XXXX (1996).</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Petitioners argue that the last clause of <i>former</i> ORS&#13;\n237.251(3)(g) (1991) -- \"which shall constitute a part of the&#13;\nsystem\" -- demonstrates a legislative intent to provide PERB with&#13;\nthe absolute authority to establish, at its discretion, the&#13;\nsystem's actuarial factors.  They argue that, because of that&#13;\nauthority, the actuarial factors that PERB has established are&#13;\npart of the PERS statutory contract and cannot be changed without&#13;\neither breaching or impairing their contractual rights.  We&#13;\ndisagree, for two reasons.  </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>First, petitioners' reading of the final clause of&#13;\n<i>former</i> ORS 237.251(3)(g) (1991) both misapprehends and devalues&#13;\nthe clause that precedes it.  Again, that provision provided:</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<blockquote>&#13;\n<p>\"[PERB] [s]hall determine the actuarial&#13;\nequivalency of optional forms of retirement allowances&#13;\nand establish from time to time for that purpose the&#13;\nnecessary actuarial factors, which shall constitute a&#13;\npart of the system[.]\"</p>&#13;\n</blockquote>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>As a grammatical matter, the phrase, \"which shall constitute part&#13;\nof the system,\" refers to factors that <i>necessarily ensure&#13;\nactuarial equivalency</i> in the payment of PERS members' service&#13;\nretirement allowances -- a standard by which, as the Special&#13;\nMaster found, the AEFs used before the 2003 PERS legislation fell&#13;\nshort.  <i>See generally</i>, Bryan A. Garner, <i>A Dictionary of Modern&#13;\nAmerican Usage</i> 648 (1998) (nonrestrictive clause provides detail&#13;\nas to preceding noun).  Relatedly, in light of the legislature's&#13;\nchoice to use nonrestrictive wording in the final clause, it is&#13;\napparent that the legislature's primary intent was to ensure that&#13;\nPERB update the AEFs as necessary to produce actuarial&#13;\nequivalency in the calculation of members' service retirement&#13;\nallowances.  <i>See</i> <i>id.</i> (nonrestrictive clauses generally provide&#13;\nsupplemental detail relating to preceding noun, as opposed to&#13;\nmore essential detail); <i>see also generally</i> <i>Feero v. Housley</i>, 205&#13;\nOr 404, 415, 288 P2d 1052 (1955) (court presumes that legislature&#13;\nmeant exactly what it stated within statutory provision).</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Petitioners' suggested reading of <i>former</i> ORS&#13;\n237.251(3)(g) (1991) also renders that provision internally&#13;\ninconsistent, effectively directing PERB to establish proper AEFs&#13;\nto ensure actuarial equivalency in calculating PERS members'&#13;\nservice retirement allowances on the one hand, while providing&#13;\nPERB with authority to make those factors permanent on the other. &#13;\nThat is not a plausible reading of the statute.  To the contrary,&#13;\nthe statutory wording demonstrates that the legislature intended&#13;\nfor PERB to ensure that a retired member's stream of monthly&#13;\npayments would be the actuarial equivalent of that member's total&#13;\nservice retirement allowance.  And, in so doing, PERB was&#13;\nrequired, \"from time to time for that purpose[,]\" <i>former</i> ORS&#13;\n237.251(3)(g) (1991), to establish the actuarial factors&#13;\nnecessary to produce that result.  Nowhere in chapter 237 (now&#13;\nchapter 238) did the legislature evince any contrary intent. &#13;\nAnd, no part of that chapter suggests that the legislature&#13;\nintended to give PERB the authority to make its AEFs permanent.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Based on the foregoing, we reject petitioners' argument&#13;\nthat the legislature intended in <i>former</i> ORS 237.251(3)(g) (1991),&#13;\nwhich, as noted, provided the basis for PERB's adoption of OAR&#13;\n459-05-055 (1993), <i>renumbered as</i> OAR 459-005-0055 (1996), to&#13;\nfreeze the AEFs in place at that time, as part of the statutory&#13;\ncontract.  It follows that nothing about Oregon Laws 2003,&#13;\nchapter 68, sections 2 and 4, <i>as amended by</i> Oregon Laws 2003,&#13;\nchapter 67, section 40, and Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 625,&#13;\nsection 16, breaches or impairs an obligation of the PERS&#13;\ncontract.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>E. <i>State Constitutional Claim Under Article I,</i> </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><i>Section 20</i></p>&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><a name=\"FNT69\">Petitioner Dahlin argues that the 2003 PERS legislation&#13;\ndiscriminates on the basis of age in violation of the equal&#13;\nprivileges and immunities clause of Article I, section 20, of the&#13;\nOregon Constitution.</a><a href=\"#N_69_\"><sup> (69)</sup></a>&#13;\n  More specifically, he argues that&#13;\nthe Special Master's findings indicate that the 2003 legislation&#13;\nwill have a disparate impact on the service retirement allowances&#13;\nof \"older workers\" as opposed to those of younger workers.  He&#13;\nargues that, because the 2003 legislation denies older workers&#13;\nbenefits that it specifically confers to younger workers, it&#13;\nviolates his rights under Article I, section 20.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Petitioner Dahlin uses various terms to describe the&#13;\npurported \"class\" to which he belongs.  On one hand, he argues&#13;\nthat the 2003 PERS legislation denies benefits to \"older workers\"&#13;\n-- a term that he does not define -- that it confers to younger&#13;\nworkers, but, on the other, he asserts membership in a specific&#13;\nclass, namely, Tier One members aged 40 and older.  However, even&#13;\nassuming that either categorization is sufficient to define a&#13;\nclass for the purposes of Article I, section 20, petitioner&#13;\nDahlin cannot prevail as a member of either class, as explained&#13;\nbelow.  </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>As to petitioner Dahlin's argument based on a class of&#13;\n\"older workers,\" the Special Master's report states that \"mid-career employees -- that is, those within 10 years of retirement&#13;\n-- [will] experience greater impacts on their future benefits\" as&#13;\na result of the 2003 PERS legislation.  According to his report,&#13;\nthose members are aged 42 to 52.  His report indicates further&#13;\nthat members aged 57 are expected to receive benefits greater&#13;\nthan those received by mid-career members and even than those&#13;\nreceived by members aged 37.  That data indicates that the oldest&#13;\ngroup of members are projected to receive benefits in excess of&#13;\nthose received by many younger members.  Petitioner Dahlin&#13;\npresents no additional evidence nor any evidence to the contrary. &#13;\nIn fact, he relies exclusively on the findings set out in the&#13;\nSpecial Master's report, but he reaches a conclusion exactly&#13;\nopposite to that which is inescapable based on the data set out&#13;\nin that report.  We conclude that, even if this court were to&#13;\nagree that \"older workers\" compose a recognizable class under&#13;\nArticle I, section 20, petitioner Dahlin cannot prevail on his&#13;\nclaim here because the evidence simply does not support his&#13;\nassertion that the 2003 PERS legislation treats \"older workers\"&#13;\ndisparately from younger ones.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>As to petitioner Dahlin's argument based on a class of &#13;\n\"Tier One members aged 40 and older,\" that argument essentially&#13;\nasserts age discrimination within the broader \"class\" of Tier One&#13;\nmembers.  Being a Tier One member, however, is a status created&#13;\nentirely by the PERS statutory scheme.  As this court has&#13;\nexplained, the legislature is free to create statutory classes&#13;\nand to create distinctions among those classes.  <i>Greist v.&#13;\nPhillips</i>, 322 Or 281, 292, 906 P2d 789 (1995).  What the&#13;\nlegislature may not do, however, is create distinctions based on&#13;\ncharacteristics that exist independent of the terms of&#13;\nlegislation.  <a href=\"S46166.htm\" webstripperwas=\"S46166.htm\"><i>Crocker and Crocker</i></a>, 332 Or 43, 54-55, 22 P3d&#13;\n759 (2001).  As noted above, petitioner Dahlin has failed to&#13;\nprove any distinction based on age.  He therefore is left to rely&#13;\nentirely on his status as a Tier One member.  Because that&#13;\nclassification was created by the statutory scheme at issue and&#13;\ndoes not exist independently of that scheme, it cannot serve as a&#13;\nbasis for petitioner Dahlin to assert an Article I, section 20,&#13;\nviolation.  We therefore reject his claim.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>F. <i>Remaining Constitutional Claims</i></p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>In addition to the claims for relief that we have&#13;\naddressed, various petitioners also challenge parts of the 2003&#13;\nPERS legislation based on the \"takings\" provisions of the Oregon&#13;\nConstitution and the United States Constitution, Or Const, Art I,&#13;\n&#167; 18; US Const, Amend V, IV, and the Contracts Clause of the&#13;\nUnited States Constitution, US Const, Art I, &#167; 10.  The foregoing&#13;\nholdings dispose of those claims, either because we have voided&#13;\nthe challenged legislation in light of petitioners' state&#13;\ncontract claims or because our determination of the particular&#13;\nobligations set out in the PERS contract obviates the fundamental&#13;\npremise of petitioners' remaining claims (that is, that the PERS&#13;\ncontract granted them \"rights\" that cannot be breached, impaired,&#13;\nor taken for public use).  We therefore need not discuss those&#13;\nclaims further. </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">IV.  CONCLUSION</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>\"The function of the court is to declare the law as it&#13;\nis and not what it thinks it ought to be.\"  <i>Wallace v.&#13;\nInternational Ass'n</i>, 155 Or 652, 661-62, 63 P2d 1090 (1937).  We&#13;\noffer that nearly 70-year-old statement from our predecessors on&#13;\nthis bench neither in apology nor as commentary on the various&#13;\nlegislative and executive policy choices -&#8211; both past and present&#13;\n&#8211;- that these cases have brought before us.  Instead, we&#13;\nreiterate that pronouncement here because we think that it is&#13;\nboth correct and reflective of our efforts to resolve these&#13;\ncompelling issues &#8211;- efforts that counsel and the parties&#13;\nthemselves advanced considerably through their diligent and&#13;\ncapable conduct of this litigation.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>We conclude that, in two respects, petitioners have&#13;\nprevailed on their claims for relief.  First, petitioners in each&#13;\nof the cases correctly have argued that the provisions of the&#13;\n2003 PERS legislation that alter the manner in which earnings are&#13;\ncredited to the regular accounts of Tier One members impair an&#13;\nobligation of the statutory PERS contract in violation of Article&#13;\nI, section 21, of the Oregon Constitution.  As such, those&#13;\nprovisions are void and of no effect.  Second, <i>Strunk</i> and <i>Sartain</i>&#13;\npetitioners are correct in their assertion that the provision of&#13;\nthe 2003 PERS legislation that directs PERB to not apply annual&#13;\nCOLAs to certain retired members' \"fixed\" service retirement&#13;\nallowances breaches the contrary obligation of the PERS contract&#13;\nto do so; that provision also is declared void and of no effect. &#13;\nIn all other respects, we conclude that petitioners' claims for&#13;\nrelief are not well taken.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, sections 5, 6, 7, and 8,&#13;\n<i>as amended by</i> Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 625, section 10, 11, and&#13;\n12, are declared void.  The final sentence in Oregon Laws 2003,&#13;\nchapter 67, section 10(3), is declared void.  In all other&#13;\nrespects, petitioners' claims for relief are denied or dismissed.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>BALMER, J., concurring.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>I join in each aspect of the majority's analysis and&#13;\ndisposition of these proceedings, including those that follow&#13;\nfrom this court's decision in <i>Oregon State Police Officers' Assn.&#13;\nv. State of Oregon</i>, 323 Or 356, 918 P2d 765 (1996) (<i>OSPOA</i>).  We&#13;\nappropriately have declined to revisit the questions of statutory&#13;\ninterpretation and legislative intent that <i>OSPOA</i> addressed and&#13;\ndecided.  Our respect for that precedent, however, should not be&#13;\nmisread as an endorsement of either the result or the reasoning&#13;\nin that case.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>To the contrary, in my view, the court in <i>OSPOA</i> lost&#13;\nsight of the polestar of statutory contractual analysis:  clear,&#13;\nunambiguous, and unmistakable promissory intent.  <i>See</i> <i>Hughes v.&#13;\nState of Oregon</i>, 314 Or 1, 17, 838 P2d 1018 (1992) (\"a contract&#13;\nwill not be inferred from * * * legislation unless it&#13;\nunambiguously expresses an intention to create a contract\");&#13;\n<i>Campbell et al. v. Aldrich et al.</i>, 159 Or 208, 213-14, 79 P2d 257&#13;\n(1938) (legislature's intention \"to create contractual&#13;\nobligations * * * must clearly and unmistakably appear\";&#13;\nsurrender of legislative control over vital public matters&#13;\n\"cannot be established by mere implication\").  Having lost that&#13;\nbearing, the court in <i>OSPOA</i> proceeded to misconstrue the \"assumed&#13;\ninterest rate\" provision of ORS 238.255 -- a patently&#13;\nadministrative provision intended to smooth fluctuations in PERS&#13;\nfund earnings -- as both a material and a perpetual aspect of the&#13;\nPERS contract.  <i>See</i> <i>OSPOA</i>, 323 Or at 377-78 (construing \"assumed&#13;\ninterest rate\" provision).  Oregon's public employers and&#13;\ntaxpayers must live with the effect of <i>OSPOA</i>'s error for some&#13;\ntime to come.  Our appropriate respect for stare decisis in the&#13;\ninterpretation of statutes, and more particularly of statutory&#13;\ncontracts on which public employees have relied, compels as much. &#13;\n<i>OSPOA</i>, however, ought not have any more vitality than that.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>I concur.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>DURHAM, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>I write separately to explain why I join in some but&#13;\nnot all of the majority's analysis and conclusions. </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>I begin by noting that I agree with the majority's&#13;\ninvocation of the \"rule of necessity\" to allow the justices of&#13;\nthis court to address and decide the issues in these proceedings. &#13;\nI also agree with the majority's determinations regarding&#13;\npetitioners' standing and the existence of justiciable&#13;\ncontroversies; the dismissal of petitioner Dahlin's claims under&#13;\n42 USC section 1983 and on behalf of certain PERS retirees; the&#13;\ndismissal, on ripeness grounds, of claims by petitioners in&#13;\n<i>Strunk</i>, <i>Burt</i>, <i>Dahlin</i>, and <i>Evans</i> challenging Oregon Laws 2003,&#13;\nchapter 67, sections 14b(1)(b) and 14b(2); and the denial of&#13;\nmotions to compel production of documents in the <i>Strunk</i> and&#13;\n<i>Dahlin</i> proceedings.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>I turn now to the majority's disposition of&#13;\npetitioners' other substantive challenges to the 2003 PERS&#13;\nlegislation.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">ANNUAL CREDITING OF MEMBERS' REGULAR ACCOUNTS AT ASSUMED EARNINGS RATE</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The majority declares that Oregon Laws 2003, chapter&#13;\n67, sections 5, 6, 7, and 8, <i>as amended by</i> Oregon Laws 2003,&#13;\nchapter 625, sections 10, 11, and 12, are void, because those&#13;\nprovisions impair the state's contractual retirement obligation&#13;\nwith its employees in violation of Article I, section 21, of the&#13;\nOregon Constitution.  That section provides, in part:  \"No * * *&#13;\nlaw impairing the obligation of contracts shall ever be passed  &#13;\n* * *.\"  The cited provisions of the 2003 PERS legislation&#13;\nconcern the legislature's cancellation of annual crediting of&#13;\nTier One member regular account balances at the assumed earnings&#13;\nrate.  I concur with the majority's conclusion in that respect.  I also concur with the majority that the legislature's&#13;\nmodification of the statutory scheme for charging public employer&#13;\naccounts when credited income exceeds earnings for more than five&#13;\nyears (the \"call\") does not impair the statutory contract.  The&#13;\nunderlying contractual obligation to credit member regular&#13;\naccounts remains with the state regardless of the state's&#13;\naccounting arrangements with public employers regarding the&#13;\nfunding of member account balances.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENTS (COLAs)</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The majority also concludes that Oregon Laws 2003,&#13;\nchapter 67, section 10(3), direct the Public Employees Retirement&#13;\nBoard (PERB) to breach the promise of annual COLAs on certain&#13;\n\"fixed\" service retirement allowances.  <i>Strunk</i>, ___ Or at ___&#13;\n(slip op at 109).  I conclude that the cited section of the 2003&#13;\nlegislation regarding COLAs purports to eliminate a contractual&#13;\nobligation of the state.  As a consequence, that that provision&#13;\nof the 2003 legislation impairs an obligation of contract in&#13;\nviolation of Article I, section 21, and is invalid for that&#13;\nreason.  The legislature's attempt to suspend COLAs on properly&#13;\ncalculated service retirement allowances for the affected retired&#13;\nmembers is void.  </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The majority rests its breach of contract theory on its&#13;\nreading of <i>Eckles v. State of Oregon</i>, 306 Or 380, 760 P2d 846&#13;\n(1988).  In <i>Eckles</i>, this court examined two provisions of a&#13;\nstatute, Oregon Laws 1982 (Special Session 3), chapter 2 (the&#13;\n\"Transfer Act\").  One provision of the Transfer Act, section&#13;\nfour, eliminated the state's statutory contractual obligation to&#13;\nemployers to use certain surplus funds in a statutory trust fund&#13;\nonly for purposes related to the workers' compensation laws.  A&#13;\nsecond provision, section two, directed the State Treasurer to&#13;\ntransfer $81 million from that statutory trust fund to the state&#13;\nGeneral Fund.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The court concluded that section four of the Transfer&#13;\nAct impaired the state's contractual obligation under preexisting&#13;\ncontracts with employers and was unconstitutional in that&#13;\nrespect.  The court also concluded that section two of the&#13;\nTransfer Act did not alter the state's contractual obligation to&#13;\nemployers.  Requiring the State Treasurer to transfer funds did&#13;\nnothing to change the state's contractual promise to use the&#13;\nfunds solely for purposes related to workers' compensation laws. &#13;\nIn the court's view, however, section two did breach the state's&#13;\npromise; the transfer of the funds exposed the state to a legal&#13;\nobligation to compensate employers for the breach.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>In my view, the elimination of COLAs in the 2003 PERS&#13;\nlegislation is closely analogous to the elimination of the&#13;\nstatutory contractual duty effected by section four of the&#13;\nTransfer Act, as discussed in <i>Eckles</i>.  The majority's attempt to&#13;\ncompare that aspect of the 2003 PERS legislation to the operation&#13;\nof section two of the Transfer Act, as discussed in <i>Eckles</i>, is&#13;\nunconvincing.  I conclude that the majority misreads <i>Eckles</i>.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Nevertheless, I see no reason to dissent from the&#13;\nresult that the majority adopts following its breach of contract&#13;\nanalysis.  The majority returns the parties to the position that&#13;\nthey occupied before the legislature adopted its 2003 amendment,&#13;\nand declares that that amendment is void.  As <i>Eckles</i>&#13;\ndemonstrates, that is the proper remedy when legislation impairs&#13;\nthe obligation of a statutory contract in violation of Oregon&#13;\nConstitution, Article I, section 21.  As a consequence, I concur&#13;\nin that aspect of the majority opinion.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">ADOPTION OF NEW ACTUARIAL EQUIVALENCY FACTORS (AEFs)</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The 2003 PERS legislation modifies the preexisting&#13;\nstatutory scheme regarding PERB's application of actuarial&#13;\nequivalency factors (AEFs) to convert a member's account balance&#13;\nto a monthly allowance, among other things.  Petitioners contend&#13;\nthat, pursuant to a lawful delegation of rulemaking authority,&#13;\nPERB had adopted rules in 1993 (<i>former</i> OAR 459-05-055) and 1996&#13;\n(OAR 459-005-0055) that required PERB to refrain from changing&#13;\nany AEF if the adoption of the new factor would have the effect&#13;\nof lowering a periodic or single benefit payment to a member. &#13;\nAccording to petitioners, PERB's rules \"constitute[d] a part of&#13;\nthe system,\" as ORS 238.630(3)(g) (2001) provided, from the time&#13;\nof their adoption.  Therefore, petitioners argue, by amending&#13;\ncertain statutes to require PERB to update its AEFs, the&#13;\nlegislature impaired an aspect of the retirement contract between&#13;\nthe state and the affected members of PERS.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 68, section 2, requires PERB&#13;\nto adopt new AEFs that \"use the best actuarial information on&#13;\nmortality available at the time the board adopts the tables[.]\" &#13;\nSection 4 of that law incorporates the new AEFs as a part of the&#13;\nretirement calculus for members who retired on or after July 1,&#13;\n2003, and exposes those retirees to the possibility of lower&#13;\nretirement allowances under the new AEFs.  Petitioners contend&#13;\nthat those sections of Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 68, impair the&#13;\nstate's contractual obligation to its employees.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The majority rejects that claim, and I concur for the&#13;\nfollowing reason.  There is no question that PERB's 1993 and 1996&#13;\nrule, in its amended 1996 form, in absolute and unconditional&#13;\nterms, prohibited PERB from changing any AEF to the economic&#13;\ndetriment of any member who established PERS membership before&#13;\nJanuary 1, 1999.  It is unnecessary to decide in this proceeding&#13;\nwhether PERB exceeded its rulemaking authority in adopting those&#13;\nrules.  The only true question is whether the statutes requiring&#13;\nestablishment of AEFs by PERB reflect a contractual intention by&#13;\nthe legislature, such that the Legislative Assembly in 2003&#13;\nlacked authority to impair any obligation regarding AEFs that&#13;\nPERB's rules embodied.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>I assume <i>arguendo</i> that the legislature may create a&#13;\nbinding contract by a valid delegation of authority to an&#13;\nadministrative agency to specify contractual terms through&#13;\nrulemaking.  However, that is not what occurred here.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><a name=\"FNT70\"/><a name=\"FNT71\">For many years before it enacted the 2003 PERS&#13;\nlegislation, the legislature had required PERB to establish from&#13;\ntime to time the necessary actuarial factors that would allow&#13;\nPERB to determine the actuarial equivalency of the optional forms&#13;\nof retirement under the system.  <i>See</i>, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>former</i> ORS&#13;\n237.251(3)(g) (1991).</a><a href=\"#N_70_\"><sup> (70)</sup></a>&#13;\n  \"Actuarial\" means \"relating to&#13;\nstatistical calculation esp. of life expectancy.\"  <i>Webster's&#13;\nThird New Int'l Dictionary</i> 22 (unabridged ed 2002).  As a&#13;\nvariable in the statistical calculation of actuarial equivalency,&#13;\nthe factor of \"life expectancy\" has no constant and unchanging&#13;\nvalue.  Rather, it is constantly in flux, shifting with the&#13;\nprevalence in the subject population of the various factors&#13;\n(<i>e.g.</i>, health history, diet, exercise, tobacco use, etc.) that&#13;\ninfluence longevity.<a href=\"#N_71_\"><sup> (71)</sup></a>&#13;\n  <i>Former</i> ORS 237.251(3)(g) (1991)&#13;\nrequired PERB to take account of the changing character of the&#13;\nfactors that determine actuarial equivalency by establishing the&#13;\nnecessary actuarial factors \"from time to time.\"</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>There is no question that the legislature has delegated&#13;\nbroad rulemaking authority to PERB.  When PERB adopted the two&#13;\nrules now under consideration, <i>former</i> ORS 237.263 (1991),&#13;\n<i>renumbered as</i> ORS 238.650(1995), provided:</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<blockquote>&#13;\n<p>\"<i>Subject to the limitations of ORS 237.001 to&#13;\n237.315, the board shall, from time to time, establish&#13;\nrules for transacting its business and administering&#13;\nthe system</i> in accordance with the requirements of ORS&#13;\n183.310 to 183.550.\"</p>&#13;\n</blockquote>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>(Emphasis added.)  That statute has remained in effect without&#13;\nsubstantive modification through the present time.  Aside from&#13;\nany question of the lawfulness of the 1993 and 1996 rules, that&#13;\nstatute confirms that PERB had authority to alter those rules at&#13;\nany time.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>PERB's broad authority to alter its rules is&#13;\ninsufficient, standing alone, to demonstrate that PERB's rules&#13;\ndid not reflect a legislative contractual intent while they were&#13;\nin effect.  However, in view of PERB's duty under <i>former</i> ORS&#13;\n237.251(3)(g) (1991) to evaluate the accuracy of its AEFs and&#13;\npublish new ones from time to time, and the necessary qualifying&#13;\neffect of that statute on PERB's rulemaking authority in <i>former</i>&#13;\nORS 237.263 (1991), I cannot read PERB's rules to create a&#13;\ncontractual obligation that later legislation could not impair. &#13;\n<i>Former</i> ORS 237.263 (1991) required PERB \"from time to time\" to&#13;\nestablish rules for conducting its business, and ORS&#13;\n237.251(3)(g) (1991) and its statutory successors in force&#13;\nthrough 2001 also required PERB to establish new AEFs \"from time&#13;\nto time.\"  Those provisions underscore the impermanence of the&#13;\nAEF rules on which petitioners base their claim.  The foregoing&#13;\ndiscussion demonstrates that the majority correctly rejects&#13;\npetitioners' contract impairment claims based on PERB's 1993 and&#13;\n1996 administrative rules.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">PETITIONER DAHLIN'S AGE DISCRIMINATION CLAIM</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The majority addresses and rejects the claim of&#13;\npetitioner Dahlin that the 2003 PERS legislation discriminates&#13;\nagainst him on the basis of age in violation of Article I,&#13;\nsection 20, of the Oregon Constitution.  I concur. </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">TERMINATION OF EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS TO MEMBER ACCOUNT;<br/>&#13;\nLOSS OF CREDITS TO MEMBER ACCOUNT AND ENHANCEMENTS TO RETIREMENT ALLOWANCE</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The 2003 PERS legislation terminates the longstanding&#13;\nstatutory plan for funding a key component of public employee&#13;\nretirement allowances, the member account.  The result is that,&#13;\nfor affected Tier One employees, decades-old statutory&#13;\nrequirements for credits to member accounts and employer matching&#13;\ncontributions no longer will apply.  Petitioners argue that those&#13;\nchanges inevitably will lead to reduced retirement allowances in&#13;\nviolation of their retirement contract with the state.  Moreover,&#13;\nthey contend, because employee retirement allowances will fall&#13;\nunder the 2003 PERS legislation, public employers will pay COLA&#13;\nadjustments after petitioners retire on the basis of illegally&#13;\nreduced retirement allowances, thus compounding the economic&#13;\ninjury to petitioners.  To evaluate petitioners' impairment of&#13;\ncontract claim in this respect, it is necessary to put in the&#13;\nproper context the requirements for member accounts that were in&#13;\nplace before enactment of the 2003 PERS legislation.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The payment that an eligible member of the PERS system&#13;\nreceives on retiring is known as a service retirement allowance. &#13;\nORS 238.300 (2001) provided:</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<blockquote>&#13;\n<p>\"Upon retiring from service  at normal retirement&#13;\nage or thereafter, a member of the system shall receive&#13;\na <i>service retirement allowance which shall consist of&#13;\nthe following annuity and pensions</i>:  * * *.\"</p>&#13;\n</blockquote>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>(Emphasis added.)</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>As that clause makes clear, two sources of funds&#13;\nconstitute the service retirement allowance:  an annuity and&#13;\npensions.  ORS 238.005 (2001) defined \"annuity\" and \"pension\" as&#13;\nfollows:</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<blockquote>&#13;\n<p>\"For purposes of this chapter:</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>\"(1) 'Annuity' means payments for life derived&#13;\nfrom contributions made by a member as provided in this&#13;\nchapter.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>\"* * * * *</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>\"(15) 'Pension' means annual payments for life&#13;\nderived from contributions by one or more public&#13;\nemployers.\"</p>&#13;\n</blockquote>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The phrase \"contributions made by a member\" in the&#13;\nstatutory definition of \"annuity\" referred to the statutory&#13;\nobligation of active members to contribute six percent of their&#13;\nsalaries to the Public Employees Retirement Fund (the fund).  ORS&#13;\n238.200(1)(a) (2001) provided:</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<blockquote>&#13;\n<p>\"An active member of the system shall contribute&#13;\nto the fund and there shall be withheld from salary of&#13;\nthe member six percent of that salary.\"</p>&#13;\n</blockquote>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Oregon's statutory scheme for public employee&#13;\nretirement always has required employees' contributions to the&#13;\nfund that provides the financial basis for their retirement since&#13;\nthe creation of the present retirement system 60 years ago.  That&#13;\nscheme also has required PERB to maintain individual accounts&#13;\nthat reflect both the amount of member contributions to the fund&#13;\nand any increases in the account due to interest earnings.  <i>See</i>&#13;\nOCLA &#167; 90-710(2) (stating those requirements in the original&#13;\npublic employee retirement statute in 1945).  Until 2003, those&#13;\nprovisions had not changed significantly since 1945.  </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Several statutes in effect in 2001, as set out below,&#13;\nexplained the nature and operation of member accounts and their&#13;\ncentral importance to the calculation of each member's service&#13;\nretirement allowance.  ORS 238.005(13) (2001) provided, in&#13;\npart:</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<blockquote>&#13;\n<p>\"(a) 'Member account' means the regular account&#13;\nand the variable account.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>\"(b) 'Regular account' means the account&#13;\nestablished for each active and inactive member under&#13;\nORS 238.250.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>\"(c) 'Variable account' means the account&#13;\nestablished for a member who participates in the&#13;\nVariable Annuity Account under ORS 238.260.\"  </p>&#13;\n</blockquote>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>ORS 238.200(2) (2001) provided:</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<blockquote>&#13;\n<p>\"The contributions of each member as provided in&#13;\nsubsection (1) of this section shall be deducted by the&#13;\nemployer from each payroll and transmitted by the&#13;\nemployer to the board, which shall cause them to be&#13;\ncredited to the member account of the member.\"</p>&#13;\n</blockquote>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>ORS 238.250 (2001) provided: </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<blockquote>&#13;\n<p>\"The board shall provide for a regular account for&#13;\neach active and inactive member of the system.  The&#13;\nregular account shall show the amount of the member's&#13;\ncontributions to the fund and the interest which they&#13;\nhave earned.  The board shall furnish a written&#13;\nstatement thereof upon request by any member or&#13;\nbeneficiary of the system.\"</p>&#13;\n</blockquote>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>ORS 238.255 (2001) explained the requirements for&#13;\ncrediting the regular account of a Tier One member:  </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<blockquote>&#13;\n<p>\"The regular account for an active or inactive&#13;\nmember of the system shall be examined each year.  If&#13;\nthe regular account is credited with earnings for the&#13;\nprevious year in an amount less than the earnings that&#13;\nwould have been credited pursuant to the assumed&#13;\ninterest rate for that year determined by the board,&#13;\nthe amount of the difference shall be credited to the&#13;\nregular account and charged to a reserve account in the&#13;\nfund established for the purpose.  A reserve account so&#13;\nestablished may not be maintained on a deficit basis&#13;\nfor a period of more than five years.  Earnings in&#13;\nexcess of the assumed interest rate for years following&#13;\nthe year for which a charge is made to the reserve&#13;\naccount shall first be applied to reduce or eliminate&#13;\nthe amount of a deficit.  The Public Employees&#13;\nRetirement Board shall attempt to ensure that the&#13;\nreserve account is funded with amounts adequate to&#13;\nleave a zero balance in the account when all members&#13;\nwho established membership in the system before January&#13;\n1, 1996, as described in ORS 238.430, have retired.\"</p>&#13;\n</blockquote>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The statutes set out above demonstrate that the&#13;\nrequirements regarding member contributions of salary to the fund&#13;\nserved two functions.  First, they required a personal&#13;\ninvestment, over time, by the member in the system that&#13;\nultimately would fund the member's retirement.  Second, they&#13;\nafforded the member the opportunity, over time, to increase the&#13;\nsize of the resulting member's regular account.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The majority correctly reports that the PERS system&#13;\ncreated three different formulas for calculating a member's&#13;\nservice retirement allowance and promised the members that the&#13;\nstate would calculate their benefits according to the one formula&#13;\nout of the three that would provide the highest level of service&#13;\nretirement allowance.  The three formulas are the Money Match,&#13;\nthe Pension Plus Annuity, and the Full Formula.  The Pension Plus&#13;\nAnnuity formula applies to only Tier One members who made&#13;\ncontributions to the system before August 21, 1981.  For the Tier&#13;\nOne members who do not meet that qualification, ORS 238.300&#13;\n(2001) affords two, not three, formulas, the Money Match and the&#13;\nFull Formula.  It is undisputed that, as petitioners argue, the&#13;\nsize of the member's service retirement allowance under the Money&#13;\nMatch and Pension Plus Annuity formulas turns directly on the&#13;\nsize of the accumulated percentage-of-salary contributions and&#13;\ninterest on those contributions in the member's regular account.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The three formulas arise from the terms of ORS 238.300,&#13;\nwhich in 2001 provided:</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<blockquote>&#13;\n<p>\"Upon retiring from service at normal retirement&#13;\nage or thereafter, a member of the system shall receive&#13;\na service retirement allowance which shall consist of&#13;\nthe following annuity and pensions:</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>\"(1) A refund annuity which shall be the actuarial&#13;\nequivalent of accumulated contributions by the member&#13;\nand interest thereon credited at the time of&#13;\nretirement, which annuity shall provide an allowance&#13;\npayable during the life of the member and at death a&#13;\nlump sum equal in amount to the difference between&#13;\naccumulated contributions at the time of retirement and&#13;\nthe sum of the annuity payments actually made to the&#13;\nmember during life shall be paid to such person, if&#13;\nany, as the member nominates by written designation&#13;\nduly acknowledged and filed with the board or shall&#13;\notherwise be paid according to the provisions of this&#13;\nchapter for disposal of an amount credited to the&#13;\nmember account of a member at the time of death in the&#13;\nevent the member designates no beneficiary to receive&#13;\nthe amount or no such beneficiary is able to receive&#13;\nthe amount.

A benefit in an equal amount is then added&#13;\nand charged to the employer's account.  The resulting&#13;\nretirement allowance is therefore twice the amount of&#13;\nthe benefit resulting from the member's own annuitized&#13;\naccount balances.\"</p>&#13;\n</blockquote>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Special Master's Report at 13.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The legislature created the Pension Plus Annuity&#13;\nformula in 1967, Oregon Laws 1967, chapter 622, and, as already&#13;\nnoted, it applies only to PERS members who have made&#13;\ncontributions before August 21, 1981.  The Special Master&#13;\ndescribed the operation of the Pension Plus Annuity formula as&#13;\nfollows:</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<blockquote>&#13;\n<p>\"The Pension Plus Annuity method is available only&#13;\nto members who made PERS contributions before August&#13;\n21, 1981.  Under that method, PERS calculates a pension&#13;\nequal to 1.0 percent of the member's final average&#13;\nsalary (1.35 percent for legislators, and police and&#13;\nfire employees) for each year of service.  An annuity&#13;\ncalculated by multiplying the member's account balance&#13;\nby an actuarial equivalency factor (AEF) is added to&#13;\nthe pension.  The retirement allowance is the sum of&#13;\nthe formula pension and the member's annuitized account&#13;\nbalance.  Under the Pension Plus Annuity method, the&#13;\nretirement allowance is fully funded by employers.\"</p>&#13;\n</blockquote>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The legislature created the Full Formula pension&#13;\nbenefit in 1981.  Or Laws 1981, ch 616, &#167; 4.  The Special Master&#13;\ndescribed the operation of the Full Formula pension as follows:</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<blockquote>&#13;\n<p>\"PERS staff calculates the Full Formula allowance&#13;\nby multiplying the retiring member's final average&#13;\nsalary and years of service by a factor.  The formula&#13;\nprovides 50 percent of final average salary for career&#13;\nemployees (25 years of police/fire service, or 30 years&#13;\nof general service).  Thus, the Full Formula&#13;\ncalculation consists of three components:  (1) the&#13;\nmember's final average salary; (2) the member's years&#13;\nand months of creditable service as of the date of&#13;\nretirement; and (3) a factor set by statute at 1.67&#13;\npercent for general service employees and 2.0 percent&#13;\nfor legislators, police officers, and firefighters.<sup>7</sup> &#13;\nThe member is entitled to an annuity in an amount equal&#13;\nto the member's final average salary multiplied by the&#13;\nlength of creditable service multiplied by the&#13;\napplicable statutory percentage factor.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n<p/><hr width=\"50%\" align=\"left\"/><p>\"<sup>7</sup>  The Full Formula benefit for legislators,&#13;\npolice, and fire members provides a higher multiplier&#13;\nthat allows those members to receive a more favorable&#13;\nretirement benefit, by allowing earlier retirement at a&#13;\nfull benefit, than is provided for members in general&#13;\nservice.\"</p>&#13;\n</blockquote>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>It is important to note that ORS 238.300(2)(a) (2001)&#13;\nprovided that the Full Formula method was \"subject to paragraph&#13;\n(b) of this subsection[.]\"  The cited paragraph (b) (<i>i.e.</i>, ORS&#13;\n238.300(2)(b)), stated that \"[a] pension under this subsection&#13;\nshall be at least:\", and then described the Money Match and&#13;\nPension Plus Annuity formulas.  When I read those passages&#13;\ntogether, they indicate without ambiguity that the legislature&#13;\nguaranteed that the pension portion of the qualified retiring&#13;\nmember's service retirement allowance, when calculated under the&#13;\nFull Formula method, would not fall below the amount of the&#13;\npension to which the employee would be entitled under either the&#13;\nMoney Match formula or, if it applied, the Pension Plus Annuity&#13;\nformula.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The foregoing discussion indicates that the preexisting&#13;\nPERS system required Tier One members to contribute six percent&#13;\nof their salary, either through payroll deduction or by employer&#13;\n\"pick-up,\" to the fund, but entitled members to accumulate those&#13;\ncontributions, together with interest on the contributions, in&#13;\neach member's regular account.  That scheme created a tangible&#13;\nincentive for Tier One members to accumulate as large a regular&#13;\naccount as possible, because, at retirement, the state guaranteed&#13;\nthat the size of the regular account, among other factors, would&#13;\ndetermine the size of the member's service retirement allowance. &#13;\nFinally, because the Money Match and, as applicable, the Pension&#13;\nPlus Annuity formulas operated as a financial floor beneath which&#13;\nthe pension component could not fall, the incentive that I&#13;\nidentify above existed for all Tier One members regardless of the&#13;\nparticular formula that PERS used to calculate their service&#13;\nretirement allowance.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>In 2003, the legislature amended ORS 238.200, which now&#13;\nprohibits any future contributions to the fund and, thus, to the&#13;\nmember's regular account on or after January 1, 2004.  ORS&#13;\n238.200(4) provides in part:</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<blockquote>&#13;\n<p>\"Notwithstanding subsections (1) to (3) of this&#13;\nsection, a member of the system, or a participating&#13;\nemployer acting on behalf of the member pursuant to ORS&#13;\n238.205, is not permitted or required to make employee&#13;\ncontributions to the fund for service performed on or&#13;\nafter January 1, 2004.\"</p>&#13;\n</blockquote>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><a name=\"FNT76\">The new statute continues to require members to contribute six&#13;\npercent of their salary,</a><a href=\"#N_76_\"><sup> (76)</sup></a>&#13;\n but now diverts those amounts&#13;\ninto an Individual Account Program (IAP).  Regular accounts will&#13;\ncontinue to exist, but PERS no longer will credit salary&#13;\ncontributions to regular accounts.  The Special Master summarized&#13;\nthe consequences of that aspect of the 2003 PERS legislation as&#13;\nfollows:</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<blockquote>&#13;\n<p>\"The diversion of member contributions to the IAP&#13;\nwill reduce members' future account balances for&#13;\npurposes of employer matching under the Money Match&#13;\nformula.  On a system-wide basis, the elimination of&#13;\nemployee contributions from the Money Match calculation&#13;\nprobably will cause the Full Formula option to overtake&#13;\nthe Money Match as the most common retirement formula. &#13;\nAlthough members will receive balances held in the IAP,&#13;\nthose balances will not be matched by employer&#13;\ncontributions, enhanced by cost of living increases, or&#13;\nannuitized at the assumed earnings rate as part of a&#13;\ndefined benefit package.\"</p>&#13;\n</blockquote>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>In <i>Hughes v. State of Oregon</i>, 314 Or 1, 12, 838 P2d&#13;\n1018 (1992), this court considered whether the legislature had&#13;\nimpaired the PERS contract in 1991 by modifying the statute that&#13;\nmade retirement benefits \"accrued or accruing\" under PERS exempt&#13;\nfrom state income taxation.  The court acknowledged the rule that&#13;\nthe court will not infer a contract from legislation if the law&#13;\n\"does not unambiguously express an intention to create a&#13;\ncontract[.]\"  <i>Id.</i> at 14.  The court, however, noted that the&#13;\ncontractual nature of PERS was a settled matter:</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<blockquote>&#13;\n<p>\"We begin from the premise that PERS is a contract&#13;\nbetween the state and its employees.  The contractual&#13;\nnature of such pension schemes was settled in <i>Taylor v.&#13;\nMult. Dep. Sher. Ret.

The court concluded that, because contractual intent&#13;\nof the legislature and the contractual nature of PERS were&#13;\nmatters of settled law, \"[t]he only remaining question,&#13;\ntherefore, is whether and to what extent <i>former</i> ORS 237.201&#13;\n(1989) [the statute that exempted \"accrued or accruing\" PERS&#13;\nbenefits from state taxation] was intended to be a term of the&#13;\nPERS contract.\"  <i>Id.</i> at 21 (footnote omitted).  The court&#13;\nanswered that question in the affirmative, because, considering&#13;\nthe context of the tax exemption's enactment as a matter of&#13;\n\"primary importance,\" the legislature had included the exemption&#13;\n\"as part and parcel\" of the 1953 PERS statute.  <i>Id.</i> at 25.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The <i>Hughes</i> court limited its impairment holding to&#13;\nthose PERS retirement benefits that already had accrued in the&#13;\npast or were accruing at present, and distinguished those&#13;\ncategories from benefits accruing in the future, because the&#13;\npreexisting PERS tax exemption statute had incorporated that&#13;\nexpress distinction.  Thus, the <i>Hughes</i> court concluded, the&#13;\nlegislature had not obligated itself by its statutory contract to&#13;\ntreat as exempt PERS benefits received for work performed after a&#13;\nchange in the tax exemption statute.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><i>Hughes</i> relied on the <i>Taylor</i> case for the proposition&#13;\nthat, on acceptance of employment (and completion of a required&#13;\nsix-month period of service) with a PERS employer, subsequent&#13;\nlegislation cannot impair the employee's vested contractual&#13;\ninterest in a pension plan.  <i>Hughes</i>, 314 Or at 20.  In <i>Taylor</i>,&#13;\nthe plaintiff was a deputy sheriff who had served for 13 years as&#13;\na jail matron, and later as a corrections officer, in Multnomah&#13;\nCounty.

The county refused to allow&#13;\nthe plaintiff to participate, claiming that her work in the jail&#13;\ndid not involve \"law enforcement\" services.  The county soon&#13;\namended the ordinance, in Ordinance No. 29, to exclude the&#13;\nplaintiff more clearly, and relied on its express authority under&#13;\nthe ordinance to determine the eligibility and qualifications of&#13;\ncounty personnel to receive benefits under the county's&#13;\nretirement system.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>This court held that the plaintiff had acquired pension&#13;\nrights under the original ordinance, Ordinance No. 25, because&#13;\nher contractual rights arose when she first had rendered service&#13;\nunder that ordinance, <i>not</i> when she completed the service that the&#13;\nlater Ordinance No. 29 required for receipt of pension benefits:</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<blockquote>&#13;\n<p>\"We conclude from the above authorities that&#13;\nOregon has adopted not only the contractual concept of&#13;\npensions, but, also, the concept that contractual&#13;\nrights can arise prior to the completion of the service&#13;\nnecessary to a pension.  * * * Such rights are subject,&#13;\nof course, to subsequent completion of the necessary&#13;\nservice.\"</p>&#13;\n</blockquote>&#13;\n &#13;\n<p><a name=\"FNT77\"><i>Taylor</i>, 265 Or at 451 (citations omitted).

Applying those principles to the facts in <i>Taylor</i>, the&#13;\ncourt stated:</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<blockquote>&#13;\n<p>\"As applied to the present circumstances,&#13;\n<i>plaintiff's tender of the contributions and acceptance&#13;\nof the plan terminated defendants' power to revoke the&#13;\noffer, and plaintiff would be entitled to the benefits&#13;\nof the plan if she continued to work for the requisite&#13;\nperiod necessary for retirement</i>.\"</p>&#13;\n</blockquote>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 454 (emphasis added).</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Two additional authorities that this court discussed&#13;\nwith approval in <i>Taylor</i> confirm the binding nature of an&#13;\nemployer's offered inducements for employment once the employee&#13;\naccepts them by commencing service.  In <i>Harryman v. Roseburg Fire&#13;\nDist.</i>, 244 Or 631, 420 P2d 51 (1966), a public employer&#13;\nrepresented that it would allow employees to accumulate unused&#13;\nsick leave and pay them for it when they terminated employment. &#13;\nThe plaintiff accepted employment.  Later, the public employer&#13;\nrevoked the sick leave policy and refused to pay the employee for&#13;\nthe sick leave that he had accumulated during his employment. &#13;\nThis court held that the public employer was required to honor&#13;\nthe inducement for employment that it had made:</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<blockquote>&#13;\n<p>\"When plaintiff entered upon his employment with&#13;\ndefendant he was advised that he would receive an&#13;\nallowance for accumulated sick leave upon termination&#13;\nof employment.  He accepted employment upon the&#13;\nassumption that the allowance for sick leave was a part&#13;\nof his compensation for services.  Since it was a part&#13;\nof the inducement to accept employment, it can be&#13;\nregarded as a contractual term of plaintiff's&#13;\nemployment.  Defendant could not, therefore, deprive&#13;\nplaintiff of the allowance after he had earned it.\"</p>&#13;\n</blockquote>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 634-35 (footnote omitted).</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>In <i>Adams v. Schrunk</i>, 6 Or App 580, 488 P2d 831 (1971),&#13;\nthe Court of Appeals held that a public employer was not entitled&#13;\nto evade, by means of a charter amendment, a provision in its&#13;\noriginal charter that allowed employees to accumulate time toward&#13;\ntheir eligibility for retirement by counting time spent in&#13;\ntemporary service.  This court in <i>Taylor</i> provided the following&#13;\nsummary of the holding in <i>Adams</i> and expressly agreed with it:</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<blockquote>&#13;\n<p>\"In <i>Adams v. Schrunk</i>, 6 Or App 580, 488 P2d 831 (1971),&#13;\n(<i>rev. denied</i> November 16, 1971), the Court of Appeals&#13;\nheld that Portland police officers acquired a right to&#13;\nhave time served as temporary officers included in&#13;\ntheir periods of service necessary to entitle them to a&#13;\npension.  At the time of the temporary service the then&#13;\nexisting pension plan authorized this inclusion in&#13;\ncomputing the length of service necessary for a&#13;\npension, and contributions were withheld from the&#13;\nofficers' salaries.  Subsequently, the plan was amended&#13;\nto deny the inclusion of such service.  The Court of&#13;\nAppeals thus recognized, as <i>Crawford</i> [<i>v.

This court's discussion of <i>Adams</i> and <i>Crawford</i> in&#13;\n<i>Taylor</i> constitutes a rejection of the statement in <i>Crawford</i> that&#13;\ncontract rights in a retirement plan do not arise before the&#13;\ncompletion of the necessary service for retirement.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The final case that is pertinent to this discussion is&#13;\n<i>Oregon State Police Officers' Assn. v. State of Oregon</i>, 323 Or&#13;\n356, 918 P2d 765 (1996) (<i>OSPOA</i>).  <i>OSPOA</i> involved a contract&#13;\nimpairment challenge to three changes to PERS that a ballot&#13;\nmeasure, Ballot Measure 8, purported to add to the state&#13;\nconstitution.  Section 10 of the measure repeated the existing&#13;\nrequirement that members must contribute six percent of their&#13;\nsalary to the system, but prohibited public employers, by&#13;\ncontract or otherwise, from \"picking up\" the employees' six&#13;\npercent payment obligation.  That provision concerned the&#13;\nlegislature's enactment of <i>former</i> ORS 237.075 (1979) renumbered&#13;\nas ORS 238.205 (1995), which authorized public employers to agree&#13;\nwith employees or to decide unilaterally to pick up the employee&#13;\ncontribution to PERS.  <i>See</i> <i>OSPOA</i>, 323 Or at 373 (explaining&#13;\noperation of pick-up statute).  Section 11 of the ballot measure&#13;\nwithdrew the statutorily guaranteed minimum rate of return on&#13;\nPERS member accounts.  Section 12 of the ballot measure purported&#13;\nto nullify a statute that allowed retiring PERS members to add&#13;\naccumulated unused sick leave benefits to their final average&#13;\nsalary.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The court in <i>OSPOA</i> reviewed at length the Oregon case&#13;\nlaw, including the cases discussed in this opinion, on the&#13;\nsubject of contractual rights that arise from public employee&#13;\nretirement plans.  Addressing section 10, the court stated:</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<blockquote>&#13;\n<p>\"Under the <i>Taylor</i> analysis, and contrary to the&#13;\nstate's argument here, ORS 237.075, and the state's&#13;\nimplementation of the authority contained in that&#13;\nstatute, promised a pension benefit that plaintiffs&#13;\ncould realize only on retirement with sufficient years&#13;\nof service, that is, <i>after</i> rendering labor for the&#13;\nstate.  Plaintiffs accepted that offer by working.  <i>See</i>&#13;\n<i>Taylor</i>, 265 Or at 452.  The change mandated by section&#13;\n10 alters the state's contractual obligation, in&#13;\nviolation of <i>Taylor</i>, by increasing plaintiffs' cost of&#13;\nretirement benefits for services that, absent a lawful&#13;\nseparation of employment, they will provide in the&#13;\nfuture.  That consequence, if approved, would permit&#13;\nthe state to retain the benefit of plaintiffs' labor,&#13;\nbut relieve the state of the burden of paying&#13;\nplaintiffs what it promised for that labor.  That&#13;\nresult would frustrate plaintiffs' reasonable&#13;\ncontractual expectations that were based on legal&#13;\ncommitments expressly made by the state.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>\"Once offered and accepted, a pension promise made&#13;\nby the state is not a mirage (something seen in the&#13;\ndistance that disappears before the employee reaches&#13;\nretirement).  Nullification of an express term of&#13;\nplaintiffs' PERS contract with the state is an&#13;\nimpairment for purposes of Contract Clause analysis, &#13;\n<i>Allied Structural Steel Co. v. Spannaus</i>, 438 US 234,&#13;\n247, 98 S Ct 2716, 57 L Ed 2d 727 (1978).  Section 10&#13;\nexpressly and substantially changes the state's&#13;\ncontractual promise to plaintiffs with respect to the&#13;\ncost of their participation in the PERS retirement plan&#13;\nand the benefits that they will receive on retirement. &#13;\nUnder section 10, the cost of participation to the&#13;\nemployee increases while the benefits that the employee&#13;\nultimately will receive on retirement decrease. &#13;\nUnquestionably, section 10 impairs the obligation of&#13;\nplaintiffs' PERS contract.\"</p>&#13;\n</blockquote>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><i>OSPOA</i>, 323 Or at 374-75 (emphasis in original; footnote omitted).</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>In dissent, Justice Gillette opined that the majority,&#13;\nin analyzing section 10, had transformed a statutory permission&#13;\ninto a promise to pick up all public employees' six percent&#13;\ncontributions.  <i>Id.</i> at 409 (Gillette, J., dissenting).  The&#13;\nmajority responded to Justice Gillette's criticism as follows:</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<blockquote>&#13;\n<p>\"The fatal flaw in that analysis is that it 'errs in&#13;\nfailing to consider the significance of context.' &#13;\n<i>Hughes</i>, 314 Or at 21 n 27.  The six percent pick-up is&#13;\nan integral part of the underlying PERS pension&#13;\ncontract.  Unilateral termination of the six percent&#13;\npick-up term of the PERS pension contract materially&#13;\nchanges that underlying pension contract to plaintiffs'&#13;\ndetriment and, thus, frustrates plaintiffs' reasonable&#13;\nreliance on the offer the state made to them and which&#13;\nthey accepted by the tender of part performance.  <i>Id.</i>&#13;\nat 20-21.\"</p>&#13;\n</blockquote>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 376.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><i>OSPOA</i> went on to hold that sections 11 and 12 of Ballot&#13;\nMeasure 8 also impaired employee contractual rights.  As to those&#13;\nconclusions, the court was unanimous.  The court struck down&#13;\nBallot Measure 8 in its entirety.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>I turn now to the analysis of the legislature's&#13;\nalteration in 2003 of the preexisting scheme for crediting member&#13;\ncontributions in light of the case law discussed above.  Both&#13;\nbefore and after the 2003 legislation, PERS members are subject,&#13;\nas they have been for many decades, to a legal requirement to&#13;\ncontribute six percent of their salary to a discrete \"account\" in&#13;\nPERS.  Salary contributions no longer will be credited to, and&#13;\nenhance the value of, member regular accounts; instead, PERS will&#13;\ncredit salary contributions to the IAP.  Also, before and after&#13;\nthe legislative change, the regular account and IAP of each&#13;\nmember will earn a rate of interest.  What has changed is the&#13;\nlegislature's commitment before the 2003 legislative amendment&#13;\nabout how PERS will increase the value of those contributions&#13;\nbefore and after retirement and, consequently, the value of each&#13;\nmember's service retirement allowance.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>First, the 2003 PERS legislation cancelled the&#13;\npreexisting unconditional obligation to increase Tier One member&#13;\naccount balances annually by the assumed interest rate.  I&#13;\nalready have indicated that I join in the majority's&#13;\ndetermination that that change impaired the PERS contract.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Second, the 2003 PERS legislation has reduced&#13;\nsignificantly the practical value of the Money Match formula by&#13;\nprohibiting future contributions of salary to regular member&#13;\naccounts and by eliminating any matching feature regarding the&#13;\nIAP.  Before the change, PERS members could work and plan for a&#13;\nservice retirement allowance that would reflect a pension amount&#13;\nnot less than their accumulated salary contributions during their&#13;\nyears of service, increased annually by at least the assumed&#13;\ninterest rate, plus an amount not less than a pension (<i>i.e.</i>, an&#13;\namount \"matched\" by the employer) that was the actuarial&#13;\nequivalent of the annuity that the members' accumulated&#13;\ncontributions could provide.  After the 2003 PERS legislation,&#13;\nthe employer matching feature will not apply to member&#13;\ncontributions made after July 1, 2003, either directly as one&#13;\navailable retirement formula or as a minimum financial benchmark&#13;\nfor the service retirement allowance.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>I conclude that that aspect of the 2003 PERS&#13;\nlegislation constitutes an impairment of contract under this&#13;\ncourt's precedents.  According to <i>OSPOA</i>, Ballot Measure 8's&#13;\ndeprivation of the employer pick-up feature of the employee&#13;\nregular account contribution scheme represented an impairment of&#13;\ncontract.  By dint of logic, we must recognize that the complete&#13;\nprospective cancellation of that contribution scheme constitutes&#13;\nan even clearer impairment of contract.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>This court's cases defeat the majority's contrary&#13;\nconclusion.  According to this court's case law, the proper focus&#13;\nis the employer's retirement benefit plan in place at the&#13;\ncommencement of employment, together with any enhancements to&#13;\nthat plan that the employer implements after employment begins. &#13;\nIn no case has this court allowed a public body to modify a&#13;\nretirement plan to effect a practical reduction in benefits,&#13;\neither directly or through an alteration of the applicable&#13;\nformula for calculating benefits, after inducing employees to&#13;\nrender service in reliance on the retirement plan.  As <i>Taylor</i>&#13;\nheld, and as the <i>Restatement of the Law of Contracts</i> confirms,&#13;\nthe premise that makes the benefit plan unchangeable by the&#13;\nemployer's unilateral act is the employer's promise, which the&#13;\nlaw implies, that the employer will not revoke the retirement&#13;\nplan once the employee commences service.  Because the pre-2003&#13;\nPERS scheme, <i>i.e.</i>, the \"offer,\" was in place when each petitioner&#13;\ncommenced his or her employment, the state is bound by its&#13;\nimplied promise not to revoke that offer once petitioners&#13;\ntendered partial performance.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The majority makes two points in reaching its different&#13;\nconclusion.  First, the majority asserts that, in 1981, the&#13;\nlegislature adopted the Full Formula and expected that that&#13;\nformula would be \"a new, primary benefit calculator to the&#13;\nsystem.\"  ___ Or at ___ (slip op at 60.)  The majority also&#13;\nobserves that the Full Formula feature was significant because it&#13;\nshifted the risk of poor market performance to employers and away&#13;\nfrom employees.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The legislature's expectation about the frequency of&#13;\nuse of the Full Formula method as a \"primary benefit calculator\"&#13;\nis just that:  an expectation.  As the Special Master found,&#13;\n\"[u]ntil 1997, PERB assumed that member retirement allowances&#13;\nwould be calculated under the Full Formula method[,]\" but the&#13;\nMoney Match emerged instead in 1997 as the predominant formula. &#13;\nBut the erroneous assumptions by the legislature and PERB about&#13;\nwhich retirement formula might be used most frequently as a&#13;\n\"primary benefit calculator\" cannot alter the fact that the pre-2003 PERS statute promised members that they would receive&#13;\nbenefits calculated according to the most economically attractive&#13;\nformula from among <i>three</i> statutory formulas.  Those incorrect&#13;\nassumptions about the frequency of use of the Full Formula and&#13;\nwhether it would be the \"primary benefit calculator\" have no&#13;\neffect on the state's contractual obligation to pay the full&#13;\nbenefits that the statute held out to employees.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The majority's point also disregards the fact,&#13;\nconfirmed in the text of ORS 238.300(2)(b) (2001), that the&#13;\nlegislature required the employer's Full Formula pension to be&#13;\n\"at least\" the actuarial equivalent of the Money Match and&#13;\nPension Plus Annuity formulas.  Thus, as a matter of clear text,&#13;\nthe Full Formula may be the ceiling but it is not the floor for&#13;\nthe statutory pension component.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>I fail to see the significance of the fact that the&#13;\nFull Formula shifted greater risk of market loss to employers. &#13;\nThe PERS statute promised members that they would receive&#13;\nbenefits calculated according to the most economically attractive&#13;\nretirement benefit formula <i>regardless of market performance</i>.  The&#13;\naddition of the Full Formula benefit in 1981 merely added one&#13;\nmore option to the retirement calculation formulas.  The risk of&#13;\nmarket loss under any of those formulas has nothing to do with&#13;\ntheir function in the calculation of promised service retirement&#13;\nallowances.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Finally, the majority notes that the statutory&#13;\nprovision regarding regular accounts contains no separate wording&#13;\nthat promises that the legislature will not terminate the&#13;\naccumulation of member contributions in regular accounts.  This&#13;\ncourt addressed and rejected a similar argument in <i>Hughes</i> that a&#13;\ndissenting opinion asserted.  The majority in <i>Hughes</i> emphasized&#13;\nthat the legislature's inclusion of a tax exemption statute&#13;\nwithin a larger statutory contract was a significant contextual&#13;\nclue about the legislature's contractual intent; the absence of&#13;\npromissory terms in the tax exemption statute itself was, in the&#13;\ncourt's view, immaterial.  The court cited numerous United States&#13;\nSupreme Court cases that held that a tax exemption was a term of&#13;\na larger contract, and noted:</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<blockquote>&#13;\n<p>\"The significant fact [in those cases] is that an&#13;\nunderlying contract was present.  This case presents an&#13;\nanalogous situation where we are faced with an&#13;\nunderlying contract -- the PERS contract -- and the&#13;\nquestion is whether the tax exemption statute is a term&#13;\nof that contract.  Also significant is that in those&#13;\ncases the tax exemption terms are not, on their face,&#13;\nindicative of an intention not to repeal those&#13;\nexemptions.  <i>The constitutional protection that was&#13;\nafforded to those provisions' obligations followed from&#13;\nthe fact that they were part of a larger contract, not&#13;\nthat they were promissory in and of themselves.</i>\"</p>&#13;\n</blockquote>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><i>Hughes</i>, 314 Or at 21-22 n 27 (emphasis added).</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Applying that point from <i>Hughes</i> to this case, it is&#13;\nimmaterial that the legislature did not append explicit wording&#13;\nto the regular account statute to confirm its unchangeability. &#13;\nWhat is significant is the statutory context.  Did the&#13;\nlegislature incorporate into the PERS contract the provisions for&#13;\nregular accounts and the calculation of retirement benefits from&#13;\nthe accumulated benefits in those accounts?  Clearly, the answer&#13;\nis yes.  The majority's contrary answer is a legal error.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">ELIMINATION OF VARIABLE ACCOUNT</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The Special Master found as follows:</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<blockquote>&#13;\n<p>\"Before the enactment of Section 3 of HB 2003,&#13;\nPERS members could elect to have 25, 50 or 75 percent&#13;\nof their employee contributions allocated to variable&#13;\naccounts, and they were entitled to purchase a variable&#13;\nannuity at retirement with their variable account&#13;\nbalances.  ORS 238.260 (2001).  Section 3 of HB 2003&#13;\nprovides that, after December 31, 2003, members no&#13;\nlonger are permitted to direct contributions to the&#13;\nvariable account.  ORS 238.260(3)(b) (2003).</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>\"Section 3 does not affect contributions credited&#13;\nto member accounts before its effective date.\"</p>&#13;\n</blockquote>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The Special Master explained the operation of the&#13;\nvariable account system before its cancellation as follows:</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<blockquote>&#13;\n<p>\"Earnings on variable accounts are first allocated&#13;\nto pay a proportionate share of administrative&#13;\nexpenses, and the remainder are credited to member&#13;\naccounts.  The PERS system never has funded a reserve&#13;\nfrom variable account earnings.  For many years, PERB&#13;\nadded the balances in the regular and variable accounts&#13;\nof members who retired under the Money Match, and it&#13;\napplied the relevant AEFs to calculate their monthly&#13;\nannuities.  PERS then required employers to match those&#13;\nannuities.  That practice gave members twice the&#13;\ndifference between the earnings on their regular and&#13;\nvariable accounts.\"</p>&#13;\n</blockquote>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>In essence, the variable account plan afforded members&#13;\nthe opportunity to obtain greater growth in their regular&#13;\naccounts by investing a portion of their salary contributions in&#13;\nequities.  ORS 238.260(1) explained the legislature's purpose in&#13;\nestablishing the variable account program:</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<blockquote>&#13;\n<p>\"The purpose of this section is to establish a&#13;\nwell balanced, broadly diversified investment program&#13;\nfor certain contributions and portions of the member&#13;\naccounts so as to provide retirement benefits for&#13;\nmembers of the system that will fluctuate as the value&#13;\nand earnings of the investments vary in relation to&#13;\nchanges in the general economy.  It is anticipated that&#13;\ninvestment of those contributions and portions of the&#13;\nmember accounts in equities will result in the&#13;\naccumulation of larger deposit reserves for those&#13;\nmembers during their working years, tend to preserve&#13;\nthe purchasing power of those reserves and the&#13;\nretirement benefits provided thereby and afford better&#13;\nprotection in periods of economic inflation.\"</p>&#13;\n</blockquote>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Petitioners assert that the legislature's repeal of&#13;\ntheir right to direct contributions to the variable account&#13;\nprogram is an impairment of their contract.  The majority rejects&#13;\nthat claim, relying substantially on the reasoning used to reject&#13;\npetitioners' claim regarding members' regular accounts.  In&#13;\nparticular, the majority points to the absence of specific words&#13;\nin ORS 238.260 (2001) or any earlier version of the variable&#13;\naccount statute in which the legislature expressly promised to&#13;\n<i>continue</i> the variable account program.  The majority draws the&#13;\nconclusion from that fact that the legislature thus reserved the&#13;\nright to repeal the variable account program at any time.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>I disagree.  <i>None</i> of the components of the PERS&#13;\ncontract, including the promised retirement formulas and public&#13;\nemployer obligations, appear with a legislative promise that the&#13;\nlegislature will not repeal them.  The majority's reasoning&#13;\ndeparts from this court's decisions that examine retirement&#13;\nobligations from the standpoint of benefits offered.  None of&#13;\nthis court's cases have suggested that the absence of a promise&#13;\nof non repeal exposes a retirement plan benefit to withdrawal or&#13;\ncancellation.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The fact that the legislature's cancellation was only&#13;\nprospective does not save it from an impairment of contract&#13;\nchallenge.  When the affected employees accepted employment, the&#13;\nvariable account plan represented one available means for&#13;\nincreasing the size of their regular accounts.  As the foregoing&#13;\ndiscussion of the regular account challenge demonstrates, our&#13;\ncases decline to allow employers, once employment commences, to&#13;\nnullify aspects of a retirement plan that employees may use to&#13;\nenhance their service retirement benefit.  For the reasons&#13;\nexpressed in that discussion, the majority's contrary conclusion&#13;\nis erroneous.  </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>In conclusion, I respectfully dissent from the&#13;\nmajority's conclusions regarding the legislature's amendment of&#13;\nthe statutes regarding employee contributions to regular accounts&#13;\nand variable accounts, and concur, for the reasons stated, with&#13;\nthe balance of the majority's conclusions.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Riggs and Kistler, JJ., concur with this opinion.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n<p/><hr width=\"10%\" align=\"left\"/><p>&#13;\n<tt>&#13;\n</tt></p><p><a name=\"N_1_\">1.&#160;</a>&#13;\nAfter the enactment of those bills, the legislature&#13;\nmade further amendments to both, HB 3020 (2003); Or Laws 2003, ch&#13;\n625, and later amended HB 2003 even further, HB 2020 (2003); Or&#13;\nLaws 2003, ch 733.

Having done so, and for the reasons set out below, we conclude that the provisions of Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, <i>as amended by</i> Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 625, that eliminate the annual assumed earnings rate credit<sup>[2]</sup> to PERS Tier One members'<sup>[3]</sup> regular accounts impair a contractual obligation of the PERS contract in violation of Article I, section 21, of the Oregon Constitution.<sup>[4]</sup> We further conclude that the provision of Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, section 10(3), that, in effect, temporarily suspends annual cost-of-living adjustments to the service retirement allowances of certain retired Tier One members breaches an obligation of the PERS contract. In all other respects, we conclude that petitioners' challenges to the 2003 PERS legislation are not well taken.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATIONS</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Jurisdiction</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 625, section 17(1), provides:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Jurisdiction is conferred on the Supreme Court to determine in the manner provided by this section whether the implementation of actuarial equivalency factor tables under section 2 or 4, chapter 68, Oregon Laws 2003 (Enrolled House Bill 2004), breaches any contract between members of the Public Employees Retirement System and their employers, or violates any constitutional provision, including but not limited to impairment of contract rights of members of the Public Employees Retirement System under section 21, Article I, of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1065</span> Oregon Constitution, or clause 1, section 10, Article I, of the United States Constitution.\"<sup>[5]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 625, section 17a, contains essentially identical operative wording, except that the grant of jurisdiction pertains to determinations \"whether the provisions of chapter 67, Oregon Laws 2003 (Enrolled House Bill 2003)\" breach any PERS contract or violate any constitutional provision.</p>\n<p>The 2003 PERS legislation contains other jurisdictional and quasi-jurisdictional provisions as well. We have considered every statutory jurisdictional prerequisite and, with the three exceptions explained below, have determined that each of the petitioners in each of these consolidated cases is properly before this court and that each petition presents a justiciable controversy.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>The first of the three claims that fall short of the jurisdictional or justiciability requirements is petitioner Dahlin's claim for relief under 42 USC section 1983.<sup>[7]</sup> With respect to that claim for relief, petitioner Dahlin states that he \"is advancing no new impairment arguments under Section 1983, but rather, [is] utilizing that section as a procedural vehicle to raise his United States Constitutional claims * * * [and] as one method by which he may recover his costs and attorney fees in this action.\" Respondents assert, correctly we conclude, that petitioner Dahlin's section 1983 claim falls outside the legislature's limited grant of original jurisdiction to this court, quoted above. Contrary to petitioner Dahlin's implicit assertion that the legislation allows multiple avenues for presenting challenges, the only \"procedural vehicle[s]\" that the legislature has authorized for review of the 2003 PERS legislation in this court as original matters are the petitions to which that legislation refers. Those petitions do not include the federal statutory claim that section 1983 provides. We therefore dismiss petitioner Dahlin's section 1983 claim.</p>\n<p>The second problematic claim is petitioner Dahlin's challenge to an aspect of the 2003 PERS legislation that, effectively, temporarily suspends annual cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) as to certain retired Tier One members. <i>See</i> Or. Laws 2003, ch. 67, § 10(3), <i>as amended by</i> Or. Laws 2003, ch. 625, § 13 (so providing). Section 10 applies to only members who:</p>\n<blockquote>\"(a) Established membership in [PERS] before January 1, 1996, * * *;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(b) Receive a service retirement allowance calculated under ORS 238.300(2)(b)(A); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(c) Have an effective date of retirement that is on or after April 1, 2000, and before April 1, 2004.\"</blockquote>\n<p>Or. Laws 2003, ch. 67, § 10(5).<sup>[8]</sup> Petitioner Dahlin, however, is not a retired PERS member, and, as an active Tier One member, the provisions that he seeks to challenge respecting <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1066</span> the COLA suspension do not apply to him. On that basis, respondents jointly assert that he lacks standing to pursue that particular challenge. We agree. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Brumnett v. PSRB,</i> 315 Or. 402, 405, 848 P.2d 1194 (1993) (for party to have standing, court's decision must have some practical effect on party's rights).</p>\n<p>Petitioner Dahlin's attempts to avoid the foregoing conclusion are not well taken. First, he argues that he has brought his claims as a class action and that \"members of the class have standing to raise this claim.\" Regardless of the legal validity of that assertion, nothing in the pleadings or the record supports the proposition that petitioner Dahlin sought to maintain a class action. Second, petitioner Dahlin argues that respondents have waived any objection to his standing. Standing, however, is an aspect of justiciability, <i>McIntire v. Forbes,</i> 322 Or. 426, 433, 909 P.2d 846 (1996), and justiciability is not waivable, <i>Barcik v. Kubiaczyk,</i> 321 Or. 174, 186-87, 895 P.2d 765 (1995). Accordingly, we dismiss petitioner Dahlin's petition to the extent that it seeks to challenge the temporary COLA suspension.</p>\n<p>The third problematic matter concerns claims that <i>Strunk</i> petitioners have advanced  and in which <i>Burt, Dahlin,</i> and <i>Evans</i> petitioners have joined  challenging Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, sections 14b(1)(b) and (2), <i>as amended by</i> Oregon Laws 2004, chapter 625, section 31, which provide as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"(1) If the Public Employees Retirement Board [(PERB)] is required to correct one or more of the erroneous benefit calculation methods identified in <i>City of Eugene et al. v. State of Oregon,</i> Case Nos. 99C-12794, 00C-16173, 99C-12838 and 99C-20235, [PERB] shall recover the cost of benefits erroneously paid to retired members as a result of those erroneous benefit calculations by one or both of the following methods:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(b) [PERB] may treat all or part of the present value of the benefits erroneously paid and payable to retired members as a result of the erroneous benefit calculations as an administrative expense of the Public Employees Retirement System, to be paid exclusively from future income of the Public Employees Retirement Fund, and to be amortized over an actuarially reasonable period not to exceed 15 years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(2) In no event may the cost of erroneous benefit calculation methods identified in <i>City of Eugene et al. v. State of Oregon</i> be considered an employer liability or charged to employers through employer contributions.\"</blockquote>\n<p>As one of their arguments in response to petitioners' challenges to sections 14b(1)(b) and (2), respondents argue that those challenges \"are either moot or not yet ripe for adjudication.\" We agree with the latter contention.</p>\n<p>This court long has held that, for a claim to be justiciable, \"[t]he controversy must involve present facts as opposed to a dispute which is based on future events of a hypothetical issue.\" <i>Brown v. Oregon State Bar,</i> 293 Or. 446, 449, 648 P.2d 1289 (1982); <i>see also </i><i>State ex rel v. Funk,</i> 105 Or. 134, 155, 199 P. 592, <i>overruled on demurrer,</i> 105 Or. 134, 209 P. 113 (1922) (\"courts pass upon concrete cases and not abstract propositions of law\"). As the <i>City of Eugene</i> litigation presently stands  and it is that litigation upon which sections 14b(1)(b) and (2) are predicated  PERB has agreed not to act under those sections. Whether the status quo will change remains to be seen.<sup>[9]</sup> What is certain is that, at this time, petitioners' challenge to those sections is premature. Accordingly, we dismiss the claim as not ripe for adjudication.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>De Novo and Plenary Review</i>\n</h2>\n<p>This court best fulfills its obligation to interpret the laws of this state after a trial court and the Court of Appeals have had an <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1067</span> opportunity to consider and refine the factual and legal issues. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Western Helicopter Services v. Rogerson Aircraft,</i> 311 Or. 361, 370, 811 P.2d 627 (1991) (\"Our experience with cases on direct appeal or in which we are exercising our original jurisdiction has taught us that the issues and arguments in both kinds of cases often are not as well defined or as focused as are the issues and arguments in cases in which discretionary review is sought after the case has filtered through the lens of a Court of Appeals decision.\"). Those considerations notwithstanding, for these proceedings, the legislature has directed this court to determine all issues as original matters in this court. To comply with that directive, this court appointed a special master to conduct the trial of all factual issues and to assemble the record. We now conduct a <i>de novo</i> review of the evidentiary record and a plenary review of the legal issues presented.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>The Evidentiary Record</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The court appointed now-Chief Judge David Brewer of the Oregon Court of Appeals to act as Special Master on the court's behalf in these proceedings and to hold an evidentiary hearing, rule on prehearing matters, and make recommended findings of fact. The Special Master completed that assignment in commendable fashion, and his efforts warrant this court's grateful acknowledgment. He guided these cases through a two-week evidentiary hearing, oversaw the creation of a voluminous record, and prepared a comprehensive written report, including extensive recommended findings of fact. That report has gone virtually unchallenged before this court, and, unless specifically noted, we have adopted those recommended findings of fact.</p>\n<p>Although the parties challenge only a few of the Special Master's specific recommended findings of fact, they have drawn freely from the evidentiary record to advance factual assertions that were not contained in the Special Master's report. As appropriate  that is, when relevant and proved by a preponderance of the evidence  this court has made independent findings in response to those factual assertions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. <i>Motions to Compel Production</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We address a final preliminary consideration. Petitioners in two of the proceedings, <i>Strunk</i> and <i>Dahlin,</i> twice moved the Special Master to compel the production of documents that they unsuccessfully had sought to obtain in discovery from respondent Public Employees Retirement Board (PERB). PERB had withheld production of those documents on the ground that the documents, which related to advice that the Attorney General had given to PERB concerning the actuarial equivalency factors used to compute retired members' benefits, constituted privileged lawyer-client communications. The Special Master refused to compel production of the documents.</p>\n<p>Petitioner Dahlin and <i>Strunk</i> petitioners have assigned the rulings of the Special Master as error. We uphold the Special Master's refusal to compel the production of the documents, because, in our view, the documents are not relevant to any claim at issue in these proceedings.</p>\n<p>Having resolved the preliminary considerations that these matters present, we proceed to an overview of PERS generally and of the parties and their claims and defenses.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>A brief summary of the history and operation of PERS, as well as the changes that the 2003 PERS legislation made to the system, provide context for the parties' arguments. As the Special Master noted in his report, \"[t]he statutory, administrative, historical, and operational backgrounds against which both the 2003 legislation and the instant claims have arisen are exceedingly complex.\" The summary that follows borrows heavily from the Special Master's written report. More fully developed discussions about particular aspects of the system are set out later as we address the parties' specific arguments.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1068</span> A. <i>PERS Before the 2003 Legislation</i><sup>[10]</sup></h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>General Considerations</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In one form or another, Oregon has provided its public employees with a retirement plan, as a contractual benefit of public employment, since 1945. Funding for the system comes from three sources: (1) employee member contributions, presently set at six percent of salary; (2) employer contributions, in an amount actuarially determined to be necessary when added to the employee member contributions to cover the cost of accrued and projected future service retirement allowances payable to retired members; and (3) investment earnings on those contributions. The assets, taken together, constitute the Public Employees Retirement Fund (the fund) and are used to pay the costs of the system: member service retirement allowances and administrative expenses. Except for variable account funds, which we discuss below, all PERS funds are commingled for investment purposes.</p>\n<p>PERB administers PERS and acts as trustee for the fund. PERB conducts its operations through a director and staff that PERB employs, and PERB administers the system in consultation with the PERS actuary.<sup>[11]</sup> PERB sets employer contribution rates, adopts actuarial equivalency factors and assumed earnings rates, establishes reserve accounts, and allocates annual earnings to accounts and reserves. The Oregon Investment Council (OIC) invests the assets of the fund.<sup>[12]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Membership in and Funding of PERS</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Public employees of participating employers become PERS members upon completing six months of uninterrupted service.<sup>[13]</sup> Every PERS member has a regular \"account\" in PERS. The member's regular account consists of the member's contributions to the system and earnings that PERB has credited to those contributions. In addition, in 1967, the legislature enacted an optional variable annuity account program for members who are willing to have their contributions and benefits fluctuate with the equity markets. A member who participates in the variable annuity account program has two member accounts: a regular account and a variable account. Members' contributions to their variable accounts are paid into the Variable Annuity Account and are invested solely in the Oregon Equity Fund.<sup>[14]</sup></p>\n<p>For purposes of this litigation, there are two categories of PERS members. \"Tier <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1069</span> One\" members are public employees who joined PERS before January 1, 1996. Tier One members are entitled to a guaranteed minimum rate of return on their regular accounts based on the assumed earnings rate. To ensure that sufficient assets exist to pay guaranteed benefits to Tier One members at the assumed earnings rate, PERS maintains a \"gain-loss reserve.\" In years when fund earnings exceed the assumed earnings rate, PERB deposits a portion of those excess earnings into the gain-loss reserve. In years when fund earnings are less than the assumed earnings rate, PERB uses funds from the reserve to make up the difference.</p>\n<p>PERS members who joined the system on or after January 1, 1996, are known as \"Tier Two\" members. Unlike Tier One members, Tier Two members have no earnings guarantee on their regular accounts and, correspondingly, do not benefit from the fund's gain-loss reserve.<sup>[15]</sup></p>\n<p>Crediting of member accounts occurs annually as of December 31 of each calender year. At the beginning of each calendar year, PERB reviews changes in the value of the fund since the beginning of the previous year. PERB staff determines the fund's value using standard accounting methods. Based on the fund's annual growth, PERB allocates earnings to various accounts within the fund on an \"equal crediting\" basis; that is, every dollar within the fund receives the same percentage share of earnings regardless of the account to which that dollar is designated.<sup>[16]</sup></p>\n<p>The PERS actuary also recommends the adoption of employer contribution rates in an \"Actuarial Valuation\" that usually issues as of December 31 in odd-numbered years. Employers begin paying newly established contribution rates on July 1 of the following year. Employer contribution rates consist of two components: the employer's normal cost toward payment of members' service retirement allowances and the amount necessary to amortize any unfunded actuarial liability (UAL). The normal cost component of the employer contribution rate is based on the PERS actuary's best estimate of the amount needed to pay service retirement allowances to current members in the future. The adjustment of the employer contribution rate either for UAL or actuarial surplus is based on the difference between an employer's account balance and the projected future service retirement allowances payable to its employee members. If an actuarial surplus exists, then the employer pays less than the normal cost rate. If the employer has a UAL, then PERB adds an additional, amortized charge to the employer's normal cost rate.<sup>[17]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. <i>Service Retirement Allowance Formulas</i>\n</h2>\n<p>There are three formulas available for calculating a PERS member's service retirement <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1070</span> allowance, commonly known as the Pension Plus Annuity, the Full Formula, and the Money Match. The Pension Plus Annuity, which is available to only members who contributed to PERS before August 21, 1981, consists of the sum of an annuity component and a pension component. The annuity component is composed of the actuarial equivalent of the member's account balances at retirement. The pension component, funded by the employer, is equal to one percent of the member's final average salary (1.35 percent for legislators and police and fire employees) for each service year.</p>\n<p>The Full Formula also includes an annuity component composed of the actuarial equivalent of the member's account balances at retirement and a pension component; however, the pension component is calculated differently than under the Pension Plus Annuity. The Full Formula first calculates a member's service retirement allowance by multiplying the member's final average salary by a factor set at 1.67 percent (two percent for legislators, police officers, and firefighters) and then multiplying the resulting figure by the member's years of membership. That service retirement allowance then is funded using the actuarial equivalent of the member's account balances at retirement (the annuity component) and employer contributions required to make up the difference (the pension component).</p>\n<p>Under the Money Match, a member's service retirement allowance is calculated by determining the sum of the actuarial equivalent of the member's account balances at retirement (the annuity component) and then adding a sum in an equal amount that is charged to the employer, <i>i.e.,</i> the \"match\" (the pension component). The resulting service retirement allowance therefore amounts to twice the actuarial equivalent of the member's account balances at retirement.</p>\n<p>At retirement, a PERS member receives a service retirement allowance based on the formula that produces the highest pension amount among the foregoing three alternative formulas.<sup>[18]</sup> By the late 1980s, members who retired with 30 years of creditable service received service retirement allowances equal to approximately 63 percent of their final average salaries. By the early 1990s, that figure had increased to 66 percent and, between 1996 and 2002, had increased to 85 percent. In 2000, the average PERS retired member with 30 years of creditable service retired at the age of 53 with a service retirement allowance equal to 106 percent of the member's final average salary.<sup>[19]</sup></p>\n<p>Regardless of the formula used to determine a retired member's service retirement allowance, PERS historically has increased such allowances through annual cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs). COLAs are based on the Consumer Price Index and are capped at two percent of each member's allowance. If the index increases by more than two percent for the year, then the increase above two percent is \"banked\" and may be added to the member's COLA in later years when the index increases by less than two percent.</p>\n<p>Finally, in addition to the benefits described above, members who retired before 1991 receive an increase in benefits to remedy unlawful taxation on retirement income benefits attributable to service before 1991. <i>See generally </i><i>Hughes v. State of Oregon,</i> 314 Or. 1, 838 P.2d 1018 (1992) (legislature's repeal of income tax exemption statute as to PERS members' retirement benefits constituted <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1071</span> breach of PERS contract, requiring legislatively created remedy).</p>\n<p>When a PERS member retires, PERB transfers the member's account balances to the Benefits-In-Force reserve account (BIF), together with an amount from the employer's accumulated contributions. The amount transferred from the employer's account is that which PERB has determined is necessary to pay the member's service retirement allowance. PERB also regularly \"trues up\" the BIF by recalculating the funds necessary to pay all expected service retirement allowances for retired members. If PERB's actuary determines that the BIF is insufficient to pay those allowances, then PERB deducts from all employer accounts the amounts necessary to eliminate the deficiency. Conversely, if the BIF is overfunded, then PERB adds the overage to all employer accounts. For accounting purposes, PERB does not make adjustments to individual employer accounts; instead, PERB maintains a balancing account that shows the actuary's \"trueing up\" calculations.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4. <i>Recent Fiscal Status of the Fund</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The fiscal status of the fund following poor investment performances in 2000, 2001, and 2002  together with significant growth in fund liabilities and employer contribution rates  was the primary motivator of the 2003 PERS legislation. <i>See generally</i> Or Laws 2003, ch 67 (preamble). Those considerations provided much of the focus of the parties' advocacy before the Special Master and this court. As context for the issues that we resolve in these cases, we set out the following brief discussion of the fund's financial status, which we take from the Special Master's report:</p>\n<blockquote>\"For the 2001-03 biennium, the [S]tate of Oregon's general fund and lottery budget was approximately $11 billion. Oregon's local governments will collect approximately $17.8 billion in own-source revenues in fiscal year 2003-04. In comparison, at the end of 2002, the fund had a total UAL of more than $15 billion [based on the fair market value of fund assets]. In January 2003, the UAL reached $16.41 billion. During the 2003 legislative session, the UAL exceeded $17 billion, but it had declined to $12.7 billion by July 2003.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"Between 1991 and 2000, the nation experienced the longest sustained period of economic growth in its history. During that time, the average investment return on the fund was approximately 15 percent per year. However, over that same period, the system's funded ratio, which compares the value of fund assets to projected liabilities, declined. In 1991, the fund's value equaled the amount of its projected future liabilities. By 2001, the value of the fund's assets equaled 89 percent of its projected future liabilities. In 2002, based on then-current actuarial assumptions, the PERS actuary projected that PERS liabilities would increase from approximately $45 billion in 2001 to approximately $65 billion by 2007. In 2002, the actuary also projected that the funded ratio would remain below 80 percent until 2010 and that the funded ratio probably would not equal 100 percent until 2027. In early 2003, that ratio declined to 65.4 percent.\"</blockquote>\n<p>(Footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>The 2003 PERS Legislation</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The following summary addresses only those changes to the system following the 2003 PERS legislation that petitioners have challenged in this litigation.<sup>[20]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>Member Accounts</i>\n</h2>\n<p>As noted, before the 2003 PERS legislation, all active PERS members contributed, either directly or by employer pick-up,<sup>[21]</sup> six percent of their salaries to their regular accounts. Earnings on those contributions also were credited to those accounts. Under the 2003 PERS legislation, all member contributions <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1072</span> made after January 1, 2004, are placed into an \"account\" for each member under a new Individual Account Program (IAP) instead of being credited to PERS regular accounts. The balances held in members' IAP accounts will not be annually credited at not less than the assumed earnings rate and, at retirement, will not be subject to employer matching under the Money Match or be enhanced by annual COLAs.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Investment in the Variable Annuity Account Program</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Under the 2003 PERS legislation, as of December 31, 2003, members no longer may contribute to the variable annuity account program. The legislation does not affect contributions credited to members' variable accounts before that date.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. <i>The \"Call\"</i>\n</h2>\n<p>As explained earlier, the legislature has required PERB to create a reserve account, known as the \"gain-loss\" reserve, to offset any deficit created in years in which fund earnings fell below the assumed earnings rate. By statute, PERB could not maintain that reserve account in a deficit position for more than five years. PERB's process for eliminating such a deficit has been referred to as the \"call.\" There never has been a five-year deficit in the reserve account, and, accordingly, PERB never has implemented the call. The 2003 PERS legislation eliminates the statutory provisions respecting the call.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4. <i>The Assumed Earnings Rate and Crediting of Accounts</i>\n</h2>\n<p>As noted, before the 2003 PERS legislation, the PERS statutes guaranteed all Tier One members that PERB would credit earnings on their regular accounts annually at not less than the assumed earnings rate. The 2003 PERS legislation, however, prohibits the allocation of earnings to Tier One members' regular accounts in any year in which a deficit exists in the gain-loss reserve or the allocation of earnings would cause a deficit in the gain-loss reserve.<sup>[22]</sup> The amendment does not apply to members who retired before April 1, 2004. For Tier One members who retire on or after that date, the amount in their regular accounts at retirement cannot be less than the amount that those accounts would have reflected if PERB had credited those accounts with earnings at the assumed earnings rate for every year that the accounts existed. If a member's regular account balance is deficient in that respect, then PERS is required to pay the difference out of the gain-loss reserve.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>5. <i>Cost-of-Living Adjustments</i>\n</h2>\n<p>As noted, retired PERS members are entitled to annual COLAs on their service retirement allowances not to exceed two percent per year. Under the 2003 PERS legislation, PERS must calculate two alternative service retirement allowances for certain members who retired on or after April 1, 2000, and before April 1, 2004  a \"revised\" service retirement allowance and a \"fixed\" service retirement allowance. The \"revised\" service retirement allowance calculates the amount that the member would have received if PERB had credited all members' regular accounts with 11.33 percent interest in 1999  instead of the 20 percent interest that PERB actually credited to members' regular accounts for that year.<sup>[23]</sup> The \"fixed\" service retirement allowance essentially \"fixes\" each <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1073</span> member's allowance as of July 1, 2003, or the effective date of the member's retirement (whichever is later), but then is not subject to an annual COLA. The legislation further provides that each member in the identified group shall receive the \"greater\" of the \"revised\" and \"fixed\" service retirement allowances.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>6. <i>Actuarial Equivalency Factors</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Under an administrative rule that PERB adopted in 1993, and later amended in 1996, PERB declared that it would not reduce, by application of new actuarial equivalency factors (AEFs),<sup>[24]</sup> the service retirement allowances of PERS members who joined the system before 1999. That declaration notwithstanding, the 2003 PERS legislation directs the implementation of updated AEFs beginning July 1, 2003, and thereby modifies the AEF calculation for certain members who entered the system before 1999. Members who retired on or before June 30, 2003  one day before the effective date of the new legislation  receive service retirement allowances calculated using the AEFs in place before the legislative reforms. All other members who joined the system before 1999 and who retired or will retire on or after July 1, 2003, will receive service retirement allowances that are subject to the new legislation. Those allowances are determined using one of two calculations, whichever produces the greater benefit. The first requires that the AEFs in effect at a member's effective retirement date be applied to the member's account balance. The second creates an account balance as of June 30, 2003, that consists only of the member's contributions and earnings credited as of that date. Based on that account balance, PERB determines the member's service retirement allowance using the AEFs in effect on June 30, 2003.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>The Parties and Their Claims</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The following is an overview of the parties and their primary contentions, taken from the Special Master's report:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Petitioners are current and former public employees who are [Tier One] members of PERS. * * * Petitioners have named as [respondents] the State of Oregon and certain state agencies (the state), [PERB], and various other public employers (the nonstate [respondents]). Petitioners each assert [under state law] that the 2003 legislation impairs a statutory contract between petitioners and their public employers * * *, breaches the statutory PERS contract, and takes their property without just compensation * * *. Some of the petitioners also assert contract impairment and takings claims under the United States Constitution. Petitioners seek to have many of the provisions of the 2003 legislation declared unconstitutional and to enjoin their implementation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"Petitioners in the <i>Strunk, Burt,</i> and <i>Evans</i> cases rely, for the sources of their claims, on the PERS statutes that existed before the enactment of the 2003 legislation and certain PERB administrative rules in effect before the legislation's enactment. Petitioners in the <i>Dahlin,</i> * * * <i>Sartain,</i> and <i>Whitty</i> cases also rely on those provisions and, in addition, assert that the PERS contract consists of other terms, including provisions of employee handbooks, oral representations, or documents that PERS officials have provided to them over the years. Those petitioners' claims allege breaches and impairments of contract and takings based on those additional purported terms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"The state has raised several defenses to petitioners' claims. It asserts that (1) the statutory provisions and other materials on which petitioners rely are not part of the obligation of any contract to which they are parties; (2) any impairment of the obligation of petitioners' PERS contracts is insubstantial or nonexistent; (3) any impairment is justified by important public purposes; and (4) petitioners have no property interest that the 2003 legislation affects. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1074</span> \"Nonstate [respondents] present a somewhat different array of defenses. Like the state, they first assert that many of the provisions that petitioners seek to enforce are not <i>statutory</i> contractual promises. They also contend that the 2003 legislation did not breach or impair those provisions that constitute statutory contractual promises because it did not change substantially the substance of those promises and, in any event, none of the affected provisions was beyond the reach of the legislature's power of amendment or repeal. They assert that the 2003 legislation has `only prospective effects.'</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"In addition, nonstate [respondents] assert that PERB lacked authority to create binding contractual obligations between themselves and petitioners with respect to PERS benefits. Further, [they] argue that, even if PERB had such authority, the rules and actions on which petitioners rely were unauthorized or contrary to statute, and petitioners have no right to retain the benefits resulting from them. According to nonstate [respondents], the legislature has the exclusive authority to determine PERS benefit levels.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"Nonstate [respondents] also have raised several affirmative defenses to petitioners' breach of contract claims. Assuming that the legislature intended the statutes, rules, and other materials on which petitioners rely to constitute part of the PERS contract, [they] assert that their performance is excused on the following grounds: (1) mutually mistaken assumptions that PERB would administer the PERS system in a prudent manner to provide benefits in accordance with legislative intent; and (2) impossibility or impracticability based on extreme financial hardship.\"</blockquote>\n<p>(Emphasis in original; footnotes omitted.)</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. DISCUSSION</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>General Summary of Case Law and Legal Principles</i>\n</h2>\n<p>To the extent that it provides background for some of the discussion that follows, we briefly summarize this court's decisions in <i>Eckles v. State of Oregon,</i> 306 Or. 380, 760 P.2d 846 (1988), <i>Hughes,</i> 314 Or. 1, 838 P.2d 1018, and <i>Oregon State Police Officers' Assn. v. State. of Oregon,</i> 323 Or. 356, 918 P.2d 765 (1996) (<i>OSPOA</i>), which the parties cite to support many of their competing contentions in these proceedings.</p>\n<p><i>Eckles</i> involved legislation that had transferred surplus funds from the Industrial Accident Fund (IAF) to the General Fund for the purpose of avoiding a state budget deficit. The plaintiff, an employer insured by the State Accident Insurance Fund Corporation (SAIF), contended that the legislation violated Article I, section 21, of the Oregon Constitution by impairing the state's contractual obligation (set out in an earlier statute) to use the funds in the IAF for only workers' compensation purposes. This court concluded that the part of the legislation that eliminated the state's obligation to use the surplus funds in the manner specified in the earlier statute constituted an unconstitutional impairment of the state's contractual obligation. 306 Or. at 399, 760 P.2d 846. The court further concluded that the part of the legislation that directed the transfer of funds amounted to a mandate that the state breach the contract, <i>id.</i> at 400, 760 P.2d 846, which ordinarily would require payment of damages to SAIF employers resulting from the breach, <i>id.</i> at 402, 760 P.2d 846.<sup>[25]</sup></p>\n<p><i>Hughes</i> involved legislation that had repealed a state income tax exemption for PERS benefits; specifically, the legislation had (1) made that exemption inapplicable to state personal income taxation; and (2) repealed the corresponding provision in the tax statutes. The plaintiffs, who were present and retired public employees, challenged the legislation under Article I, section 21, and this court ultimately held that the two statutory provisions, respectively, unconstitutionally impaired a contractual obligation and breached the PERS contract. 314 Or. at 29-33, 838 P.2d 1018. Most significant to our analysis here, the court in <i>Hughes</i> concluded <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1075</span> that \"PERS was intended to be and is a contract between the state and its employees[.]\" 314 Or. at 25, 838 P.2d 1018.</p>\n<p><i>OSPOA</i> involved challenges to Ballot Measure 8 (1994), which had amended the Oregon Constitution in three ways relating to PERS: (1) by mandating that public employees make six percent contributions to public retirement plans, if so covered, and, correspondingly, by precluding public employers from \"picking up\" that contribution on behalf of their employee members; (2) by prohibiting the state from guaranteeing a rate of return on retirement contributions; and (3) by prohibiting any increase of retirement benefits based on unused sick leave. The plaintiffs brought federal impairment of contract challenges to the amendments, and, after applying state law principles to construe the underlying PERS contract, this court invalidated the amendments as unconstitutional impairments of that contract. In reaching that conclusion, the court concluded that each of the statutory PERS provisions at issue  that is, the provisions permitting employer \"pick-up\" of the employee's contribution, guaranteeing an assumed earnings rate, and providing for inclusion of unused sick leave in benefit calculations  constituted terms of the PERS contract that applied even to work yet to be performed. 323 Or. at 372-79, 918 P.2d 765.</p>\n<p>We note some considerations from <i>Eckles</i> and <i>Hughes</i> that guide our analysis in these cases. First, in <i>Eckles,</i> this court clarified that the contracts provision of Article I, section 21, prohibited the impairment of a contractual <i>obligation. </i><i>Eckles,</i> 306 Or. at 395, 760 P.2d 846. As to the determination whether newer legislation amounts to an impairment of a preexisting statutory contractual obligation, the court focused on whether the legislation would change or eliminate the state's obligation under that contract. <i>Id.</i> at 399-400, 760 P.2d 846. By contrast, the court explained that legislation that mandated a breach on the state's part of such a contractual obligation  but did not change or eliminate the obligation itself  did not <i>contravene</i> Article I, section 21, although, in accordance with that constitutional provision, such legislation ordinarily would require payment of damages resulting from the breach. <i>Id.</i> at 400-02, 760 P.2d 846.</p>\n<p>In <i>Hughes,</i> this court set out a two-step process for addressing a claim of contractual impairment or breach under Article I, section 21:</p>\n<blockquote>\"First, it must be determined whether a contract exists to which the person asserting an impairment is a party; and, second, it must be determined whether a law of this state has impaired an obligation of that contract. General principles of contract law normally will govern both inquiries, even where the state is alleged to be a party to the contract at issue.\"</blockquote>\n<p><i>Hughes,</i> 314 Or. at 14, 838 P.2d 1018. In its ensuing analysis, the court divided the first question into three component inquiries: (1) is there a state contract?; (2) if so, what are its terms?; and (3) what obligations do the terms provide? <i>See id.</i> at 17-29, 838 P.2d 1018 (engaging in those inquiries). Further, as noted above, this court in <i>Hughes</i> concluded that PERS constituted a statutory contract. <i>Id.</i> at 25, 838 P.2d 1018.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Obligation of Successive Legislatures</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We underscore that the claims presented here, for the most part, concern contract formation and implicate what this court has described as the \"significant\" proposition that, if certain circumstances are met, \"one legislature may bind a succeeding legislature to a particular course of action.\" <i>Id.</i> at 13, 838 P.2d 1018. That proposition is significant, in part because \"[o]rdinarily it is the function of a legislature to make laws and not contracts.\" <i>Campbell et al. v. Aldrich et al.,</i> 159 Or. 208, 213, 79 P.2d 257 (1938). However, as the court in <i>Campbell</i> went on to state:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[L]egislative enactments may contain provisions which, when accepted as the basis of action by individuals, become contracts between them and the state. It is also equally well established that the intention of the Legislature thus to create contractual obligations, resulting in extinguishment to a certain extent of governmental powers, must clearly and unmistakably appear. The intention to surrender or suspend legislative control over matters vitally affecting <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1076</span> the public welfare cannot be established by mere implication.\"</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 213-14, 79 P.2d 257.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>Order of Analysis</i>\n</h2>\n<p>As a final preliminary matter, we note that petitioners' arguments arise under and implicate various sources of state and federal law. When, as here, we are presented with multiple bases for disposition, this court generally considers the issues hierarchically. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>State v. Kennedy,</i> 295 Or. 260, 262, 666 P.2d 1316 (1983) (so stating; addressing defendant's state constitutional law claim before considering his federal claim). Accordingly, we begin by addressing petitioners' claims under state law.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. <i>Petitioners' State Law Contractual Claims</i>\n</h2>\n<p>As noted above, <i>Strunk, Burt,</i> and <i>Evans</i> petitioners rely solely upon the PERS statutes and certain administrative rules as they existed before the 2003 PERS legislation as the bases for their contractual claims  that is, their claims that the 2003 legislation either impairs or breaches obligations set out in the PERS contract. <i>Dahlin</i> and <i>Whitty</i> petitioners, however, cast a broader net. They argue that, in addition to statutory and administrative rule provisions, the PERS contract includes documents that PERB has provided to them over the years.<sup>[26]</sup><i>Whitty</i> petitioners, moreover, also rely on the employee handbook that they received from their employer as establishing some of their contractual rights. Finally, <i>Strunk</i> and <i>Burt</i> petitioners also assert that the 2003 PERS legislation breaches not only the PERS contract but also the settlement agreement resolving litigation that followed this court's decision in <i>Hughes.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>Handbooks and Other Materials as Contract Terms</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>a. <i>Whitty</i> Petitioners</h2>\n<p><i>Whitty</i> petitioners are each employees of SAIF, and they named PERB and SAIF as respondents to their petition for review. <i>Whitty</i> petitioners' opening brief asserts, in part:</p>\n<blockquote>\"In addition to the [a]rguments stated by the <i>Strunk</i> Petitioners, the <i>Whitty</i> petition[ers] are relying upon the Respondent SAIF Corporation's written policy concerning retirement, stated in the SAIF Employee Handbook, as part of their contract with their employer. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"The SAIF policy also refers the employee to the PERS Handbook, `for complete details of the retirement program.' * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"The language used by SAIF Corporation in its retirement policy statement, words such as `established,' `secure' and `guarantees,' is language of contract. * * *\"</blockquote>\n<p>In response, respondents argue that (1) the PERS statutes do not reflect a legislative intent to delegate either to PERB or to SAIF the power to bind future legislatures; (2) even if the legislature had purported to delegate that power, the delegation would be an unconstitutional abdication of the legislature's lawmaking authority; (3) even if such a delegation were permissible, there is no evidence that the legislature intended to delegate <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1077</span> such authority to PERB staff or SAIF, as opposed to PERB; and (4) at least insofar as the SAIF employee manual is concerned, it promises nothing more than the ability of its employees to participate in PERS like all other state employees.</p>\n<p>In reply, <i>Whitty</i> petitioners argue, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Respondents argue that the SAIF policy on retirement and the PERS Handbook are not part of Petitioners' contract because the language of the PERS statutes does not reflect an intent to delegate the power to bind future legislatures to an administrative agency. The language of the PERS statutes also does not delegate to SAIF Corporation, or any other governmental agency the power to enter into any contract with its employees. Yet, this court has held that a Multnomah County Ordinance is a sufficient basis for a retirement benefit contract. <i>Taylor v. Multn[.] * * * Dept[.] Sher[.] Ret[.] B[d.],</i> 265 Or. 445, 451, 510 P.2d 339 (1973). * * * If a county can contract with its employees through enactment of an ordinance establishing a retirement benefit, certainly an independent public corporation, SAIF, can contract with employees through adoption of a policy conferring retirement benefits. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"As to whether the PERS Handbook is a part of Petitioners' contract with SAIF, the SAIF policy on retirement incorporates the benefits conferred in that Handbook by reference. * * * It did not adopt the Handbook as a `legal reference.'\"<sup>[27]</sup></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>b. Petitioner Dahlin</h2>\n<p>Petitioner Dahlin's opening brief asserts, in part:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Petitioner Dahlin relied on the PERS statutes, rules, handbooks, annual statements and web site estimates when planning his retirement. Based on his review of the communications from PERS, Petitioner Dahlin believed that the Money Match would produce a greater retirement benefit than the Full Formula. Petitioner Dahlin's understanding that the Money Match calculation would exceed the value of the Full Formula benefit was confirmed by annual statements that he received from PERS beginning in 1998.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"At all relevant times, the PERS handbooks * * * stated that `\"vesting\" means you cannot lose your benefit rights, even if you stop working in covered employment.'\"</blockquote>\n<p>Respondents offered essentially the same arguments in response to petitioner Dahlin as they did to <i>Whitty</i> petitioners, summarizing their response as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[P]etitioner Dahlin asserts that his contract rights  to the extent they exist  arise from PERS handbooks and his annual statements, in addition to the PERS statutes and regulations. This assertion is incorrect. There has been no legislative delegation to PER[B] that would allow the agency to bind future Legislative Assemblies. Indeed, such a delegation would be unconstitutional. Moreover, these documents on which petitioner Dahlin relies actually contain language disclosing the fact that they are not legal references or complete statements of the PERS statutes or rules, and that in [the event of] any conflict the statutes and rules shall prevail.\"</blockquote>\n<p>In reply, petitioner Dahlin states:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[Respondents] respond that as of 2001 the Handbooks contained a disclaimer that indicated that if a conflict exists between the PERS statutes and the Handbook, the statute will control. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"[Respondents'] response, however, missed the point of Petitioner Dahlin's argument. Petitioner Dahlin is not arguing that a conflict exists between the PERS statute[s], its administrative rules, and the PERS Handbook. Rather, Petitioner Dahlin is arguing that the PERS Handbook <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1078</span> is consistent with Oregon Law and the lack of a `reservation of rights clause' is the recognition of and an embodiment of the contract theory of pensions. * * *\"</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>c. Discussion</h2>\n<p>To the extent that petitioner Dahlin and <i>Whitty</i> petitioners argue that the PERS handbooks, PERB communications, and the employment policies of SAIF form part of the PERS contract, we reiterate that this court has held that PERS is a <i>statutory</i> contract. <i>Hughes,</i> 314 Or. at 25, 838 P.2d 1018. Therefore, the question whether the materials on which petitioners in part rely constitute terms of that statutory contract is a question of legislative intent. <i>See generally </i><i>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries,</i> 317 Or. 606, 610-11, 859 P.2d 1143 (1993) (statutory construction involves ascertaining legislature's intent; to do so, court first examines text and context of statute at issue); ORS 174.020(1)(a) (\"[i]n the construction of a statute, a court shall pursue the intention of the legislature if possible\"). Even disregarding respondents' argument that the legislature lacks the power to delegate to an administrative agency or other subdivision of the state the authority to set the terms of the PERS contract, the predicate question remains: did the legislature <i>intend</i> to do so?</p>\n<p>In that respect, petitioners point to no Oregon statute indicating that the legislature intended to permit PERB or any other entity as a general matter to set or alter any terms of the PERS statutory contract.<sup>[28]</sup> Nor has our own research revealed any support for the idea that the legislature intended to permit PERB or any other governmental entity  through the issuance of handbooks, policy statements, account summaries, or otherwise  to provide binding pronouncements of the retirement benefits that PERS will provide. We hold that the PERS handbooks, communications from PERB to PERS members, and SAIF's employment policies do not constitute terms of the PERS contract.</p>\n<p>That holding does not meet directly the separate argument of <i>Whitty</i> petitioners that the 2003 PERS legislation breaches or impairs their separate employment contracts with SAIF. They analogize those contracts to the ordinance at issue in <i>Taylor,</i> 265 Or. 445, 510 P.2d 339. That analogy is inapposite, however, for the simple reason that nothing about the retirement policy at issue in <i>Taylor</i> implicated a state statutory contract or any other legislative policy.<sup>[29]</sup> For <i>Whitty</i> petitioners to succeed in that argument, the retirement policy that SAIF provides to its employees would have to be independent of PERS. But that is not the case. SAIF offers its employees the PERS retirement plan, not a SAIF retirement plan or some sort of PERS hybrid. And, as we determined above, nothing in the PERS statutes indicates that the legislature intended to authorize public employers to set the terms of the PERS contract.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, we reject the arguments of petitioner Dahlin and <i>Whitty</i> petitioners that the PERS contract includes terms outside the PERS statutes (and applicable administrative rules) and the argument of <i>Whitty</i> petitioners that the 2003 PERS legislation breaches or impairs their employment contracts with SAIF.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>The Chess Settlement</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Until 1991, PERS benefits were not subject to state or local income taxation. ORS 237.201 (1989). In 1989, the United States Supreme Court held that, if a state exempts from state and local taxation pension benefits paid by state and local governments, principles of intergovernmental tax immunity require like treatment of pension benefits paid by the federal government. <i>Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury,</i> 489 U.S. 803, 109 S.Ct. 1500, 103 L.Ed.2d 891 (1989). At the time of the <i>Davis</i> decision, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1079</span> Oregon taxed federal pension benefits as personal income.</p>\n<p>Responding to that and other decisions, the 1991 Legislative Assembly enacted Oregon Laws 1991, chapter 823, which repealed the tax exemption for PERS benefits, thereby equalizing the tax treatment of state and federal pensions. As noted earlier in this opinion, this court in <i>Hughes</i> held that that repeal of the tax exemption breached the PERS contract. <i>Hughes,</i> 314 Or. at 33, 838 P.2d 1018. The court, however, concluded that \"[t]he legislature is the most appropriate branch of government in the first instance to choose among the available remedies\" for that breach. <i>Id.</i> at 33 n. 36, 838 P.2d 1018.</p>\n<p>When the legislature failed to enact a remedy, class action litigation  to which we refer as the <i>Chess</i> litigation  ensued. The trial court in <i>Chess</i> ultimately approved a settlement for damages covering all PERS retirees who were PERS members before the effective date of the 1991 tax repeal (September 29, 1991). The settlement agreement provided that the \"[p]laintiffs agree to accept the remedies provided in [the legislation] as full and complete payment for all claims raised in [the class] actions.\" The legislature adopted the terms of the <i>Chess</i> settlement and codified them at ORS 238.375 to 238.380. ORS 238.375(3) provides:</p>\n<blockquote>\"No member of the system or beneficiary of a member of the system shall acquire a right, contractual or otherwise, to the increased benefits provided by [ORS 238.375 to 238.380].\"</blockquote>\n<p>The implementation of those settlement terms resulted in an annual increase in employer contribution rates of approximately 1.4 percent, amounting to a permanent annual expense that PERB assumed would continue for 30 years.</p>\n<p><i>Strunk</i> and <i>Burt</i> petitioners argue that Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, <i>as amended by</i> Oregon Laws 2003, chapters 625 and 733, when considered generally, breaches the settlement agreement in <i>Chess.</i> Their analysis proceeds as follows: PERB understood that codifying the <i>Chess</i> settlement would increase employer contribution rates; employer contribution rates in fact increased as a direct result of that legislation; the preamble to Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, states that one reason for the enactment was to address the increase in employer contribution rates; some of that increase resulted from the <i>Chess</i> settlement legislation; and therefore, \"[t]o the extent that the legislature has lowered PERS retirement benefits, at least in part, because of the increase granted by [the legislation], then it has in fact repealed the benefits of [that legislation].\"</p>\n<p>Respondents disagree for various reasons, only one of which we need address. Respondents argue, we conclude correctly, that the <i>Chess</i> settlement agreement by its specific terms limited petitioners' rights to those set out in the 1991 legislation and that that legislation expressly disavowed the creation of any contractual rights. The wording of ORS 238.375(3), which codified the settlement, could not be clearer in that respect. Nothing about the context of that wording alters what we perceive to be the legislature's manifest intent. Because petitioners have failed to demonstrate a contractual right that Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, <i>as amended by</i> Oregon Laws 2003, chapters 625 and 733, is capable of breaching with respect to the <i>Chess</i> settlement, we reject their argument.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. <i>Petitioners' Statutory Contract Claims</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We now turn to the central issues in these cases  that is, petitioners' contentions that various aspects of the 2003 PERS legislation unconstitutionally impair statutory contractual obligations set out in the PERS contract in violation of Article I, section 21, or, alternatively, that aspects of the 2003 legislation breach statutory contractual obligations set out in the PERS contract. We discuss each challenged aspect of the 2003 legislation separately.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>a. Redirection of Members' Contributions to the IAP</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>(1) The Statutes</h2>\n<p>As noted, before the 2003 PERS legislation, PERS members were required to contribute, or to have employers contribute on behalf of their employee members, six percent <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1080</span> of members' salaries to those members' regular accounts. We set out the relevant statutes below.</p>\n<p>ORS 238.200(1)(a) (2001) provided:</p>\n<blockquote>\"An active member of the system shall contribute to the fund and there shall be withheld from salary of the member six percent of that salary.\"</blockquote>\n<p>ORS 238.200(2) (2001) provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The contributions of each member as provided in subsection (1) of this section shall be deducted by the employer from each payroll and transmitted by the employer to [PERB], which shall cause them to be credited to the member account of the member.\"</blockquote>\n<p>ORS 238.205 (2001) provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, and subject to the provisions of this section, a public employer participating in the system may agree, by a written employment policy or agreement in effect on or after July 1, 1979, to `pick-up,' assume or pay the full amount of contributions to the fund required of all or less than all active members of the system employed by the employer.\"</blockquote>\n<p>The 2003 PERS legislation, however, amended ORS 238.200 to discontinue contributions to the PERS fund:</p>\n<blockquote>\"a member of [PERS], or a participating employer acting on behalf of the member pursuant to ORS 238.205, is not permitted or required to make employee contributions to the fund for service performed on or after January 1, 2004. * * *\"</blockquote>\n<p>Or. Laws 2003, ch 67, § 1(4), <i>as amended by</i> Or. Laws 2003, ch. 625, § 9, <i>codified as</i> ORS 238.200(4). Instead, all PERS members who established membership in the system before August 29, 2003, now are members of the IAP. ORS 238A.305(1). As of January 1, 2004, those members' six percent contributions  which remain mandatory  now go into their IAP accounts, rather than into their regular accounts. Or. Laws 2003, ch. 733, §§ 32, 34, 35, <i>codified as</i> ORS 238A.330; ORS 238A.335. As before, employers still may agree to pick up the six percent contributions. Or. Laws, 2003, ch. 733, § 34, <i>codified as</i> ORS 238A.335. Each IAP account is credited with earnings and losses on the member's contributions, less administrative expenses. Or. Laws 2003, ch. 733, § 37(1), <i>codified as</i> ORS 238A.350(1). Upon retiring, the member will receive, in a lump sum payment, the full amount of that member's IAP account, Or. Laws 2003, ch. 733, § 41(1), <i>codified as</i> ORS 238A.400(1), in addition to any retirement benefits for work performed before January 1, 2004, to which the member may be entitled under PERS as it existed before the 2003 legislation. Alternatively, in lieu of the lump sum payment, the member may elect to receive the amount in his or her IAP account in installments paid over 5, 10, 15, or 20 years. Or. Laws 2003, ch. 733, § 41(2), <i>codified as</i> ORS 238A.400(2).</p>\n<p>As noted earlier in this opinion, although PERS members will receive at retirement the balances held in their IAP accounts, those balances (1) are not guaranteed annual crediting at not less than the assumed earnings rate; (2) at retirement, will not be subject to the Money Match; and (3) at retirement, will not be enhanced by annual COLAs. Respondent State of Oregon characterizes the IAP accounts as \"invested and credited in the same fashion as a typical 401(k) or IRA account,\" and we agree with that general description.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>(2) The Parties' Arguments</h2>\n<p>All petitioners, except petitioner Sartain, challenge the discontinuation of PERS members' contributions to their regular accounts.<sup>[30]</sup> Petitioners argue that the 2001 versions of the statutes set out above</p>\n<blockquote>\"were unquestionably part of the PERS Act, were integral to the calculation of benefits under the Act, were unambiguously promissory, [and] contained no language excluding contributions attributable to future service from the general contractual protection and no reservation of right of future amendment.\"</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1081</span> In support of that assertion, petitioners note that ORS 238.250 (2001), which provided for the regular account (as that statute continues to do), has remained virtually unchanged since the adoption of the first state retirement act in 1945.</p>\n<p>Although petitioners note that amounts from each member's IAP account will be payable at retirement as a lump sum without employer matching or application of annual COLAs, that is not the effect of the legislation that they emphasize. Instead, petitioners argue primarily that,</p>\n<blockquote>\"[a]s a result of this diversion, most mid-career employees will lose the option of retiring under Money Match and will find their benefits calculated under the less generous full formula benefit. * * * Under ORS 238.300 (2001), however, petitioners were promised calculation of their benefits under the formula which would produce the highest value. * * * By diverting their contributions, Section 1 of HB 2003 [Or Laws 2003, ch 67, § 1], effectively denies petitioners the contractual protection afforded by ORS 238.300(2) (2001).[<sup>[31]</sup>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"As it did in <i>OSPOA,</i>[<sup>[32]</sup>] this court should find that this permanent elimination of petitioners' statutory right to receive a pension calculated on the full value of their account[,] including future contributions and earnings thereon, constitutes an impairment of their PERS contract or[,] at a minimum, a breach of the contractual promise that all member contributions and earnings would be directed to and maintained in that PERS member account.\"</blockquote>\n<p>Respondents counter that PERS members' contributions to their regular accounts are an obligation on each member's part, rather than a contractual right that inures to each member's benefit. To the extent that any such promise exists, respondents continue, there is no support in the text or context of the PERS statutes for a legislative promise that members could continue to contribute to their regular accounts throughout their PERS membership.</p>\n<p>Respondents assert that that conclusion is bolstered by the fact that, when the legislature adopted the Full Formula in 1981, it simultaneously reduced the statutory contributions of higher compensated PERS members from seven percent to six percent. Or. Laws 1981, ch. 761, § 1 (discussed further below). Such a reduction, they argue, is inconsistent with a legislative understanding that PERS members would have a perpetual right to maintain contributions to the system at a particular level. Otherwise, the legislature would have grandfathered those members who, before 1981, were required to contribute seven percent of salary so as to preserve the amount of benefits that those members would receive at retirement.</p>\n<p>Responding to petitioners' assertion that most mid-career PERS members effectively will lose the option of retiring under the Money Match, respondents counter that the PERS statutes require only that a member receive a service retirement allowance calculated under the formula that produces the highest pension amount, whichever formula that may be. There is no indication, they contend, that the legislature intended that members would have an option to have their service retirement allowances calculated under a particular formula, the Money Match or otherwise. Moreover, respondents assert that certain wording in the PERS statutes indicates that the legislature intended the Money Match to be the floor for any service retirement calculation and, consistently with that proposition, either the Full Formula or the Pension Plus Annuity provided the highest service retirement allowance for most members before the mid-1990s.<sup>[33]</sup> They conclude <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1082</span> that, under the 2003 PERS legislation, members still will have those retirement benefits that derive from their member accounts as they existed before the 2003 PERS legislation, calculated on the full value of those accounts. As to the other statutes upon which petitioners rely, ORS 238.205 (2001) (permitting employer pick-up) and ORS 238.250 (2001) (requiring PERB to provide regular accounts for members, showing contributions and earnings), respondents argue that the 2003 PERS legislation does not alter the pick-up provisions and that the directive for PERB to establish PERS regular accounts for members is nothing more than \"a clerical obligation imposed on PERB\" to \"maintain appropriate record-keeping on member's regular accounts.\"</p>\n<p>In the end, respondents assert that petitioners' only true complaint respecting the redirection of PERS member contributions to the IAP is that their projected future service retirement allowances under the 2003 PERS legislation will not be as high as those allowances would have been without the legislation. And, although respondents agree that such will be the case, they disagree with petitioners' claims that that complaint has either contractual or constitutional consequences.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>(3) Discussion</h2>\n<p>We begin by noting some preliminary considerations. First, we are mindful that the \"accepted proposition of the contractual nature of PERS is an essential background\" for our inquiry. <i>Hughes,</i> 314 Or. at 22, 838 P.2d 1018. Further, although petitioners cite a number of statutes as significant to our analysis of their challenge to the redirection of member contributions to the IAP, we conclude that the service retirement allowance formula provisions, set out in ORS 238.300 (2001), viewed in context with other statutes that petitioners cite, are the most central to our analysis, as explained below.<sup>[34]</sup></p>\n<p>As noted, the crux of petitioners' analysis is that the diversion of contributions from PERS members' regular accounts to IAP accounts means that \"most mid-career employees will lose the option of retiring under Money Match and will find their benefits calculated under the less generous full formula benefit.\" Accordingly, we proceed to assess in detail the relevant benefit formulas that PERS provides. That is, we consider whether the statutory provisions containing those formulas are part of the PERS contract and, if so, the extent of the state's obligation in that regard.</p>\n<p>ORS 238.300 (2001)<sup>[35]</sup> provided, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Upon retiring from service at normal retirement age or thereafter, a member of the system shall receive a service retirement allowance which shall consist of the following annuity and pensions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(1) A refund annuity which shall be the actuarial equivalent of accumulated contributions <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1083</span> by the member and interest thereon credited at the time of retirement * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(2)(a) A life pension (nonrefund) for current service provided by the contributions of employers, which pension, subject to paragraph (b) of this subsection, shall be an amount which, when added to the sum of the annuity under subsection (1) of this section and the annuity, if any, provided on the same basis and payable from the Variable Annuity Account, both annuities considered on a refund basis, results in a total of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(A) For service as a police officer or firefighter, two percent of final average salary multiplied by the number of years of membership in the system * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(B) For service as a member of the Legislative Assembly, two percent of final average salary multiplied by the number of years of membership in the system * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(C) For service as other than a police officer, firefighter or member of the Legislative Assembly, 1.67 percent of final average salary multiplied by the number of years of membership in the system * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(b) A pension under this subsection shall be at least:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(A) The actuarial equivalent of the annuity provided by the accumulated contributions of the member.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(B) For a member who made contributions before August 21, 1981, the equivalent of a pension computed pursuant to this subsection as it existed immediately before that date.\"</blockquote>\n<p>As a matter of plain text, ORS 238.300 (2001) provides, first, that a member is entitled to receive a service retirement allowance that is calculated by multiplying the member's final average salary by a factor of 1.67 percent for general service employees and then multiplying the resulting figure by the member's years of membership. That service retirement allowance then is funded by an annuity component (consisting of the actuarial equivalent of the member's account balances at retirement) and a pension component (consisting of employer contributions). ORS 238.300(1), (2)(a) (2001). That is the Full Formula.</p>\n<p>However, if the pension component as calculated under the Full Formula is less than the actuarial equivalent of the annuity component based on a member's accumulated contributions to the fund, then the member is entitled to receive a higher pension component  that is, one composed of the actuarial equivalent of the member's accumulated contributions. ORS 238.300(2)(b)(A) (2001). That is the Money Match (<i>i.e.,</i> the employer-funded pension component \"matches\" the member's annuity component). And, if a member contributed to PERS before August 21, 1981, and the pension component calculated for that member based on the system as it existed immediately before that date provides a higher pension component than ones calculated under the Full Formula and the Money Match, then the member receives the higher pension amount. ORS 238.300(2)(b)(B) (2001). That is the Pension Plus Annuity.</p>\n<p>In other words, ORS 238.300 (2001) provided (and still provides) that a retired PERS member will receive a final service retirement allowance that is calculated under the one formula of the three described above that yields the highest pension amount for that member, whichever formula that may be. At the same time, it appears to us that, notwithstanding the somewhat awkward placement of the words \"at least\" in ORS 238.300(2)(b) (2001), the legislature intended to set the Full Formula as the primary formula and, generally, designed the Full Formula so as to provide a minimum level below which the pension component should not fall. That is so because the Full Formula, which, significantly, is set out in the first two parts of the statute, ORS 238.300(1) and (2)(a) (2001), sets a defined benefit that does not vary depending on fluctuations in earnings or on the size of the member's annuities from the regular and variable accounts.<sup>[36]</sup> Thus, in that context, the words \"at least\" in ORS 238.300(2)(b) (2001) refer to a calculation of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1084</span> the Full Formula pension component that equals or exceeds a calculation of a pension component calculated under the Money Match (based on the member's accumulated contributions to the fund) or the Pension Plus Annuity (based on earlier statutory requirements).</p>\n<p>More importantly, the wording of ORS 238.300 (2001) is unambiguously promissory. Through that statute, the legislature continuously and unequivocally has communicated to PERS members that, if they retire from service at normal retirement age, they will receive a pension component of their final service retirement allowance that, (1) when combined with the actuarial equivalent of their accumulated contributions to the fund, will consist of the Full Formula amount based upon years of service, final average salary, and class of service that equals or exceeds any pension component calculated under the other two formulas; or (2) in the event that the Full Formula calculation falls short, a pension component calculated under the Money Match or the Pension Plus Annuity. In short, the state's obligation as set out in ORS 238.300 (2001) is to provide a final service retirement allowance made up of an annuity component and a pension component at the minimum level described above.</p>\n<p>The context of ORS 238.300 (2001), which includes the development of the statute through successive legislatures, <i>Swarens v. Dept. of Rev.,</i> 320 Or. 326, 331, 883 P.2d 853 1994), confirms that reading. ORS 238.300 and its predecessor statute, <i>former</i> ORS 237.147 (1993), have been a part of the PERS statutes since the creation of PERS in 1953.<sup>[37]</sup> During those 50 years, the benefits that PERS has provided and the manner for calculating them have changed considerably. As the Special Master noted, when the legislature created PERS, the system provided a Money Purchase Plan with an employer matching component. <i>See</i> Or. Laws 1953, ch. 200, § 18 (setting out benefit formula).<sup>[38]</sup> The stated goal of that formula, once combined with an annuity funded by member contributions, was to provide career employees ineligible for the federal Social Security program approximately one half of their final average salaries; for those eligible for Social Security, the target was less. <i>Id.</i> at § 13.</p>\n<p>In 1955, the legislature increased the target replacement ratio from 50 to 60 percent of final average salary, including Social Security. Or. Laws 1955, ch. 131, § 5(2). That enactment also modified the member contribution rate to provide that members making more than $4,800 per year could elect to contribute an equal percentage of salary in excess of that amount, which contributions would \"purchase at retirement[] additional benefits which will be matched by the employer.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>In 1967, the legislature repealed the provisions stating target retirement goals and abandoned calculating member contribution rates based strictly on actuarial assumptions, opting instead for a straight percentage-of-salary model. <i>See</i> Or. Laws 1967, ch. 622, § 4. The legislature also enacted the Pension Plus Annuity, under which retired members would receive an annuity (based on accumulated contributions and earnings) and a pension calculated as the actuarial equivalent of 1.67 percent of the member's final average salary for general service employees (1.92 percent for fire and police employees) multiplied by years of membership up to 30 years for general service (25 years for fire or police service). Or. Laws 1967, ch. 622, § 13. Finally, the legislature repealed the employer matching method for calculating the pension component. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>In 1969, the legislature restored the employer matching method (now known as the \"Money Match\") as one method for determining the pension component of retirement benefits. As between the Money Match and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1085</span> the Pension Plus Annuity, the amendment provided that the pension component of a service retirement allowance \"shall be <i>at least</i> the actuarial equivalent of the annuity provided by the accumulated contributions of the [member].\" Or. Laws 1969, ch. 640, § 7(2)(b) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Other than changing the multiplier for the Pension Plus Annuity, Or. Laws 1971, ch. 738, § 2; Or. Laws 1973, ch. 695, § 4, removing the 25- and 30-year limits on years of membership, Or. Laws 1971, ch. 738, § 2, and including legislators in the system, Or. Laws 1975, ch. 137, § 3, the legislature did not amend the PERS statutes in any significant way until 1981. In that year, the legislature added the Full Formula, described in greater detail above, which has remained substantially unchanged since that time. Or. Laws 1981, ch. 761, § 4.<sup>[39]</sup></p>\n<p>As we develop more fully below, the evolution of the statutory provisions setting out the formulas for calculating PERS members' service retirement allowances, in our view, accords with the preliminary conclusion that we drew from examining the text of ORS 238.300 (2001). That is, contrary to petitioners' arguments, the legislature did not promise that PERS would be maintained so that the Money Match remains the primary calculator of member service retirement allowances, which it presently happens to be because it usually is the most remunerative. Instead, that statutory evolution demonstrates that the legislature promised that members would receive service retirement allowances calculated under whichever formula yields the highest pension amount for that member and that the Full Formula calculation ordinarily should equal or exceed calculations under the Money Match or, if applicable, the Pension Plus Annuity.</p>\n<p>Before assessing the import of the statutory context set out above, we must ensure that we are ascertaining the intent of the correct legislature  an inquiry that is critical when analyzing statutory contracts. That is so because the fundamental purpose behind such contracts is to bind future legislative action. <i>See generally Hughes,</i> 314 Or. at 13, 838 P.2d 1018 (discussing effect of binding succeeding legislature). To know when a legislature is so bound, we first must determine which legislature enacted the operative statutory contract.</p>\n<p>As a general matter, this court has recognized several principles that it has applied at the first level of the <i>PGE</i> analysis, 317 Or. at 610-11, 859 P.2d 1143, to assist in the construction of amendatory acts. One of those principles is the presumption that \"material changes in the language of the statute create material changes in meaning.\" <i>Carlson v. Myers,</i> 327 Or. 213, 225, 959 P.2d 31 (1998). Another is a corollary to that presumption: \"[I]t is presumed that such changes in meaning do not go further than is expressly declared or necessarily implied.\" <i>Id.</i> And, finally for our purposes here,</p>\n<blockquote>\"`where a section of the statute is amended so as to read \"as follows,\" and the section is then set forth with the changes intended to be made, those portions of the old section that are merely copied into the amendment without change are not to be considered as re-enacted or as a new statement of the law, but are to be read as a part of the earlier statute, if in conflict with another law passed after the section amended and before the amendatory act, unless there is a clear manifestation of legislative intention to the contrary. In the absence of such an intention, it is the change or the additions incorporated in the section amended only that are to be considered enacted.'\"</blockquote>\n<p><i>Jones v. General Motors Corp.,</i> 325 Or. 404, 418, 939 P.2d 608 (1997) (quoting <i>Allison v. Hatton,</i> 46 Or. 370, 372, 80 P. 101 1905)); <i>see also </i><i>State ex rel Caleb v. Beesley,</i> 326 Or. 83, 88, 949 P.2d 724 (1997) (to same general effect).</p>\n<p>With the foregoing principles in mind, we glean the following from the progression of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1086</span> the statutory benefit formulas over time. From 1953 through 1967, PERS did not provide members with any minimum level of benefits. Instead, a retired member received only the contributions and earnings in his or her account matched by an employer pension in an equal amount. The key variable to that formula was earnings. And, as petitioners note, those earnings provided \"the only hope that members would have of achieving an annuity which approached the goals of the system.\"</p>\n<p>That changed in 1967, when the legislature repealed the employer-matching alternative and replaced it with the Pension Plus Annuity. Under that system, a retired PERS member was guaranteed a minimum pension component that would be added to whatever annuity that the contributions and earnings on the member's accounts had provided, whether those earnings had been good or bad. Thus, unlike the earlier employer-matching method, which had placed the risk of investment loss on members, under the Pension Plus Annuity, members could expect some minimum level of benefits and shared the risk of earnings shortfalls with employers.</p>\n<p>As noted, in 1969, the legislature reinstated what is now known as the Money Match as an additional formula to calculate the pension component of a member's service retirement allowance. Such an amendment could have been a meaningful legislative act only if the legislature contemplated that the Money Match might for some retired members provide higher pension amounts. Such an expectation, however, does not support the conclusion that the legislature <i>promised</i> members that that <i>always</i> would be the case.</p>\n<p>The final change that we determine to be relevant to understanding the evolution of the formulas for calculating service retirement allowances occurred in 1981 with the creation of the Full Formula. With that amendment, the legislature, for the first time, provided members with a formula under which the risk of earnings loss fell  and continues to fall  squarely on employers. The changes that the 1981 amendments made to <i>former</i> ORS 237.147 (1979), now ORS 238.300, were material: they added a new, primary benefit calculator to the system and shifted the downside risk of investment return away from members. Because we presume that the legislature intended those material changes to change the meaning of the statute materially as well, we conclude that the 1981 amendments effected a reenactment of the entire section and provide the version of the statute to which we will look in ascertaining the legislature's promissory intent.</p>\n<p>Having concluded that Oregon Laws 1981, chapter 761, section 4, enacted the operative statutory contract that is now embodied in ORS 238.300 (and also was embodied in ORS 238.300 (2001)), we find nothing about the statutory law that preceded the 1981 amendments to <i>former</i> ORS 237.147 (1979) that detracts from the preliminary conclusion that we drew from the wording of ORS 238.300 (2001), that is, that the 1981 Legislative Assembly promised PERS members that, on retirement, they would receive the retirement formula yielding the highest pension amount. Nor do we find any contrary intent revealed in the other statutes upon which petitioners rely (concerning six percent member contributions and direction of those contributions to PERS regular accounts).</p>\n<p>Our case law is consistent with that conclusion. As an initial matter, the parties have not directed us to a prior decision interpreting the relevant statutory provisions, and we have found none. Looking more broadly to this court's prior decisions involving PERS, petitioners place heavy reliance on this court's decision in <i>OSPOA,</i> 323 Or. 356, 918 P.2d 765. <i>OSPOA,</i> however, stands for only the proposition that the legislature promised members that the permissible employer pick-up of member contributions, assumed earnings rate for Tier One members, and unused sick-leave accrual provisions of the PERS statutory scheme were promissory and applied even to work yet to be performed. However, nothing about the court's interpretation of the statutory provisions at issue in <i>OSPOA</i> mandates a conclusion different from the one that we have reached after analyzing the text and context of ORS 238.300 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1087</span> (2001).<sup>[40]</sup></p>\n<p>In summary, we conclude that the 1981 Legislative Assembly promised each eligible member that, at retirement, the member would be entitled to receive a service retirement allowance calculated under the formula that yielded the highest pension amount. The legislature did not alter or eliminate that promise when it enacted the 2003 PERS legislation.</p>\n<p>Petitioners contend, however, that the statutory contractual obligation that we just have described includes an additional promise that PERS members have the right, during the course of their PERS membership, to contribute a certain percentage of their salary to their regular accounts so as to <i>increase</i> the value of their ultimate pension amount under the Money Match. We disagree.</p>\n<p>Nothing in the text of ORS 238.200(1)(a) (2001), which required PERS members to contribute six percent of their salaries to the fund, supports petitioners' argument that the legislature intended that contribution to be immutable. As noted earlier, the 1981 Legislative Assembly lowered the member contribution rate from a high of seven percent to a uniform six percent. And, at the same time, the legislature grandfathered those members previously paying a contribution rate of less than six percent, even though it meant that those members' account balances, and therefore the service retirement allowances that the members ultimately would receive, would be smaller under the Money Match. In other words, the text of ORS 238.200(1)(a) (2001) and its statutory context do not establish clearly and unambiguously that the legislature intended to promise members that they could contribute six percent of their salaries to their regular accounts throughout their PERS membership so as to maximize their pension component calculation under the Money Match.</p>\n<p>Applying the foregoing conclusions to petitioners' claims that the redirection of PERS members' future contributions to the IAP, as set out in the 2003 PERS legislation, either breaches or impairs a contractual obligation of the PERS contract, the answer is clear: Nothing about the creation of the IAP alters the legislature's promise that, at retirement, each member will receive a service retirement allowance calculated under the formula yielding the highest pension amount, and nothing about the IAP legislation constitutes a breach of that promise. To the contrary, under the 2003 PERS legislation, each member in the system at the time of the effective date of that legislation will, at retirement, receive a service retirement allowance consisting of an annuity component based on the member's contributions and earnings and a pension component calculated under the formula that yields the highest pension amount.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>b. The Assumed Earnings Rate</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>(1) The Statutes</h2>\n<p>Since 1975, the PERS statutory scheme has provided that the earnings to be credited annually to Tier One members' regular accounts will be no less than the existing assumed earnings rate. <i>See generally</i> Or. Laws 1975, ch. 333, § 2, <i>codified as former</i> ORS 237.277 (1975) (now ORS 238.255).<sup>[41]</sup> Petitioners identify the following statutory provisions as relevant to our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[PERB] shall provide for a regular account for each active and inactive member of the system. The regular account shall <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1088</span> show the amount of the member's contributions to the fund and the interest which they have earned.

As with the provisions respecting contributions to members' regular accounts that predated the 2003 PERS legislation, petitioners view the wording of the statutory provisions respecting the crediting of earnings to those accounts as unambiguously promissory, applicable to work yet to be performed, and containing no reservation of the right to future amendment.</p>\n<p>Based upon that understanding of the above-quoted 2001 statutory provisions, petitioners argue that the above-quoted provisions from the 2003 PERS legislation directly and indirectly either breach or impair those earlier obligations:</p>\n<blockquote>\"There is no question but that these legislative changes eliminate the requirement that petitioners' [regular] accounts grow at a rate <i>at least equal</i> to the assumed rate <i>annually</i> as promised by the 1975 legislature. Furthermore, by removing the employer Call, these changes eliminate the requirement that after five years, any remaining deficit created by the payment of the guarantee becomes the liability of employers. * * * [Instead], all future deficits will be retired only through earnings on employee accounts. In accordance with these provisions, in 2004, [PERB] distributed zero earnings to petitioners ['] accounts for the 2003 earnings.\"</blockquote>\n<p>Respondents disagree. They argue that ORS 238.255 (2001) did not promise or require that PERB would credit PERS members' regular accounts with a specific amount of earnings each year. Instead, that statute requires only that crediting occur at \"the assumed rate for that year determined by [PERB],\" that PERB had the discretion to change that rate, and that the legislature may (and did in 2003) confine PERB's discretion in setting the assumed rate. Moreover, respondents argue that the 2003 PERS legislation applies to only prospective crediting decisions and that newly enacted ORS 238.258 ensures that members ultimately never will receive a lower service retirement allowance than they would have received if their regular accounts had been credited at the assumed earnings rate each year. Respondents also disagree with petitioners' reading of the former call provision as requiring employers to make up any five-year deficit in the gain-loss reserve. Finally, respondents argue that nothing in the statutes upon which petitioners rely establishes a legislative promise that PERS members are entitled to have credited to their regular <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1091</span> accounts \"any earnings in excess of the assumed rate.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>(3) Discussion</h2>\n<p>Our assessment of the parties' arguments begins with this court's holding in <i>OSPOA</i> that the legislature intended the assumed earnings rate for Tier One members to constitute a promise that extends to work yet to be performed. Specifically, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The state's promise, as material, included employee access to the return rate procedure described in ORS 237.277. Section 11 [of Ballot Measure 8 (1994)] would cancel that obligation after employees partially performed their services. Moreover, section 11 impairs the obligation of contract stated in ORS 237.277, because it would entirely eliminate that obligation with respect to employee contributions to PERS made by current employees for work performed both <i>before</i> and after the effective date of Measure 8. <i>Hughes; Taylor.</i>\"</blockquote>\n<p><i>OSPOA,</i> 323 Or. at 378, 918 P.2d 765 (emphasis in original). That holding, however, must be considered in the context of the nature of the impairment of the contractual obligation at issue in that case. There, Measure 8 had presented an all-or-nothing scenario, in <i>eliminating in its entirety</i> the legislative promise that Tier One members would receive annual crediting to their regular accounts in an amount not less than the assumed earnings rate.</p>\n<p>The 2003 PERS legislation, however, does something other than simply eliminate the obligation. Instead, by enacting ORS 238.258  which requires a guaranteed crediting at the applicable assumed earnings rates on a career basis at retirement  the legislature at least acknowledged the promissory nature of the guaranteed rate of return that <i>OSPOA</i> recognized. Accordingly, we are required to interpret the statutory provisions at issue in greater detail than did the court in <i>OSPOA,</i> so as to determine whether the 2003 PERS legislation is consistent with the earlier legislative promise.<sup>[44]</sup></p>\n<p>We address first petitioners' argument that the statutes before the 2003 PERS legislation guaranteed Tier One members not only annual earnings at a rate not less than the assumed earnings rate but also any earnings in excess of the assumed rate, less any allocations necessary for administrative expenses and properly constituted reserves. We find no support for that broad proposition in the wording of the statutes on which petitioners rely.</p>\n<p>ORS 238.255 (2001), for example, addressed directly the circumstance in which a Tier One member's \"regular account is credited with earnings for the previous year in an amount less than the earnings that would have been credited pursuant to the assumed interest rate for that year determined by [PERB].\" In such instances, PERB credited the difference to the member's regular account and charged that amount to the gain-loss reserve. Although that wording supports a legislative promise that Tier One members' regular accounts will grow annually in an amount not less than the assumed earnings rate, that text evinces no support for the proposition that Tier One members contractually are entitled to any <i>overage</i> that is not applied to administrative expenses or reserves.</p>\n<p>Neither does the legislative direction later in that statute that \"[e]arnings in excess of the assumed interest rate for years following the year for which a charge is made to the [gain-loss reserve] shall first be applied to reduce or eliminate the amount of a deficit,\" ORS 238.255 (2001), support petitioners' claim. Although that sentence expressly contemplated the <i>potential</i> for excess earnings, the only command in the statutory wording is that the overage first go toward restoring the gain-loss reserve. Notably absent is any directive that, following such application, PERB <i>must</i> apply any remaining earnings to PERS members' regular accounts.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1092</span> Likewise, ORS 238.670 (2001), which addressed years in which the fund's earnings equaled or exceeded the assumed earnings rate and on which petitioners also rely, did not contain any affirmative promise that PERS members were entitled to a crediting of the overage, less expenses, to their regular accounts. Instead, that statute provided only that, for such years, PERB \"shall set aside, out of interest and other income received * * *, such part of the income as [PERB] may deem advisable, not exceeding seven and one-half percent of the combined total of such income\" to a reserve account. That statute was not a legislative directive that PERB <i>must</i> credit any remaining excess earnings to members' regular accounts. Finally, we have found nothing in the context or history of those statutory provisions that detracts from the conclusion that we have drawn from the text  that is, that the legislature made no such promise respecting excess earnings.<sup>[45]</sup></p>\n<p>The record in these cases establishes that PERB in fact historically has credited PERS members' regular accounts with excess earnings in good investment years. Even so, it is not for this court to codify PERB's practices. Instead, our task is to ascertain those aspects of the PERS statutes that are promissory and, from those provisions, to determine the precise nature of the obligations that they impose. It is those obligations that set the conditions that the legislature may not in the future alter without consequence. That PERB may have been administering the system in a more generous fashion regarding crediting to members' regular accounts than the statutes required does not alter the nature of the promises that the legislature made.</p>\n<p>For the reasons set out above, we conclude that Tier One members had no contractual right under the PERS statutes as they existed before the 2003 PERS legislation to the crediting of annual earnings in excess of the assumed earnings rate to their regular accounts. Instead, we conclude that, for Tier One members, annual crediting at  but not in excess of  the assumed earnings rate is the promise that the legislature extended. Those conclusions, moreover, undermine at least in part petitioners' subsidiary argument, <i>viz.,</i> that the legislature contractually is bound to maintain the system's allocation of the burden of funding reserves and paying administrative expenses. So long as Tier One members' regular accounts are credited annually with earnings that do not fall below the assumed earnings rate, the legislature has reserved for itself the ability to redirect any excess earnings.</p>\n<p>Those conclusions, however, do not address fully petitioners' argument that, by changing the future timing of the crediting process, the 2003 PERS legislation removes (<i>i.e.,</i> impairs) the obligation that Tier One members' regular accounts annually be credited at not less than the assumed earnings rate. In assessing that argument, we begin by comparing the statutory processes for Tier One regular account crediting both before and after the 2003 PERS legislation.</p>\n<p>Before the 2003 PERS legislation, PERB examined the regular accounts of Tier One members annually to determine whether the earnings credited to those accounts fell below the assumed earnings rate. ORS 238.255 (2001). If they did, then PERB would credit the difference to those accounts and charge that difference to the gain-loss reserve. <i>Id.</i> That statute further provided that the gain-loss reserve could not be maintained on a deficit basis for more than five years (the call), and, respecting repayment of the deficit, the statute provided that PERB first must apply future earnings in excess of the assumed earnings rate to reduce or eliminate the deficit. And, as noted earlier in this opinion, the call provisions of the statute never have had to be invoked. Also, before the 2003 PERS legislation, Tier One members received annual statements showing the crediting from the previous year's earnings, and those earnings were never less than the assumed earnings rate.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1093</span> Under the 2003 PERS legislation, however, the crediting system for Tier One members has changed considerably. First, as we have addressed and upheld above, Tier One members no longer are authorized to contribute salary withholdings to their regular accounts. Accordingly, any future growth in those accounts will derive solely from earnings on the members' account balances as of the effective date of the 2003 legislation. Moreover, it no longer is the case that Tier One members' regular accounts necessarily will receive year-by-year annual credits in an amount not less than the assumed earnings rate. For example, if a deficit exists in the gain-loss reserve, then PERB will apply Tier One regular account earnings to the gain-loss reserve in the years following to reduce or eliminate that deficit.<sup>[46]</sup> Moreover, PERB now may not credit any earnings to Tier One members' regular accounts for any year in which to do so would cause a deficit in the gain-loss reserve, and, for any year in which the fund experiences a loss, PERB is required to charge the amount of the loss attributable to Tier One members' regular accounts against the gain-loss reserve. Or. Laws 2003, ch. 67, § 5, <i>as amended by</i> Or. Laws 2003, ch. 625, § 10, <i>codified as</i> ORS 238.255(1) and (2).<sup>[47]</sup></p>\n<p>As described, there can be little doubt but that the 2003 PERS legislation took what was before an <i>unconditional</i> right of Tier One members to have their regular accounts credited in an amount not less than the assumed earnings rate and changed that right to a <i>conditional</i> one. That change, standing alone, would constitute an impairment of a contractual obligation set out in the PERS contract, because it amounts to an alteration of the legislature's promise respecting the crediting of members' regular accounts. <i>See </i><i>Eckles,</i> 306 Or. at 395, 400, 760 P.2d 846 (explaining gravamen of constitutional violation; contrasting impairment with breach).</p>\n<p>The 2003 PERS legislation, however, added a new statutory provision, ORS 238.258 (quoted above), apparently to meet what otherwise seems a clear impairment of contractual obligation. That provision states that, for purposes of computing the service retirement allowance of a retired Tier One member, the member's minimum regular account balance will be \"the amount that the regular account of a member would have contained if the regular account had been credited with earnings at the assumed interest rate in every year in which the regular account * * * was in existence.\" Or. Laws 2003, ch. 67, § 8(2), <i>as amended by</i> Or. Laws 2003, ch. 625, § 12. Therefore, the validity of petitioners' argument, as well as the validity of that aspect of the 2003 PERS legislation, depends on whether that new provision is consistent with the legislature's earlier guarantee. We conclude that it is not.</p>\n<p>As discussed, the legislature's promise with respect to Tier One members was that those members would receive no less than the assumed earnings rate credited annually to their regular accounts. That statutory promise extends throughout PERS membership. <i>See OSPOA,</i> 323 Or. at 377-78, 918 P.2d 765 (constitutional amendment that eliminated assumed earnings rate on contributions to member accounts for work performed both before and after date of adoption impaired contractual obligation set out in <i>former</i> ORS 237.777 (1975)). That part of the 2003 PERS legislation providing for a \"minimum regular account balance,\" Or. Laws 2003, ch. 67, § 8(2), <i>as amended by</i> Or. Laws 2003, ch. 625, § 12, based on the assumed earnings rate over the life of a Tier One member's regular account, is not consistent with the above-described obligation. That is so because Tier One members' regular account balances currently reflect annual earnings credits that often <i>exceeded</i> the assumed earnings rate. Those prior earnings crediting decisions, whether or not they are deemed to have been overly generous in hindsight, are <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1094</span> now final. To the extent that those final crediting decisions are reflected in Tier One members' regular account balances, no less than the assumed earnings rate must be credited annually to those account balances until retirement.</p>\n<p>In creating a new, <i>post hoc,</i> career-crediting process, the 2003 PERS legislation, Or. Laws 2003, ch. 67, § 8, <i>as amended by</i> Or. Laws 2003, ch. 625, § 12, changes that obligation, ultimately resulting in many cases in account balances that will not represent the sum of all earnings that, consistently with the earlier legislative promise, <i>annually</i> have been (and would be) credited to Tier One members' regular accounts. We therefore hold that Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, sections 5 to 8, <i>as amended by</i> Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 625, sections 10 to 12, alter the state's earlier contractual obligation and thereby impair that obligation in violation of Article I, section 21, of the Oregon Constitution.</p>\n<p>Having concluded that that part of the 2003 PERS legislation alters and thereby impairs the state's contractual obligation to credit Tier One members' regular accounts annually in an amount not less than the assumed earnings rate, we proceed to consider the State of Oregon and nonstate respondents' remaining alternative argument and affirmative defense that they advance to avoid the ultimate conclusion that that impairment is constitutionally significant. For the reasons set out below, we conclude that respondents' remaining argument and affirmative defense are not availing under the present circumstances.</p>\n<p>First, respondents argue that, to violate Article I, section 21, of the Oregon Constitution, an impairment of contractual obligation must be \"substantial.\" And, in respondents' view, any impairment resulting from the 2003 PERS legislation is not of that magnitude. Specifically, they argue:</p>\n<blockquote>\"This Court has not directly addressed the question whether the Legislative Assembly may, within the confines of Oregon's Contract Clause, amend or alter an obligation without impairing or breaching a statutory contract. It has implied on several occasions, however, that a lesser modification to a statutory contract may be constitutionally permissible.\"</blockquote>\n<p>For that proposition, respondents rely primarily on the statement in <i>Hughes</i> that, once vested, \"an employee's contractual interest in a pension plan may not be <i>substantially</i> impaired by subsequent legislation.\" 314 Or. at 20, 838 P.2d 1018 (emphasis added). Moreover, respondents argue that other state and federal courts have reached the same conclusion in the context of pension litigation and urge this court to follow suit.</p>\n<p>We agree with respondents that this court has yet to determine whether substantiality of an impairment of a contractual obligation is required to show a violation of Article I, section 21. Further, we have considered thoroughly the well-developed arguments from both sides addressing the issue. However, we conclude that we need not answer that question in this instance. That is so because, assuming without deciding that substantiality is a required element, we deem the impairment to the obligation in the PERS contract respecting the annual assumed earnings rate guarantee to be substantial. We reach that conclusion for two reasons.</p>\n<p>As an initial matter, although the evidence of the impact of the crediting changes to Tier One members' regular accounts was sharply contested before the Special Master, and the Special Master found that the evidence consisted of estimates that were themselves contingent, that data is sufficiently precise to permit this court to find that, for <i>Strunk</i> petitioners as an example, the provisions relating to crediting of Tier One members' regular accounts will result in a reduction of benefits (compared to those that they would have received without the legislation) in amounts varying between approximately 12 and 20 percent per month. Such significant reductions are illustrative of a substantial impairment of the assumed earnings rate guarantee.</p>\n<p>More significantly, we deem the impairment to be substantial for the further reason that the alternative that the legislature provided  career-long crediting at the assumed earnings rate  has a retrospective effect on <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1095</span> earnings accrued for work already performed. That is so because, in providing the career-basis remedy, the 2003 PERS legislation disregards entirely PERB's earlier crediting decisions  decisions that generally were not challenged<sup>[48]</sup>  and effectively replaces the resulting regular account earnings, many of which had exceeded the minimum rate of earnings, with the assumed earnings rate. Absent some legal basis for such a downward adjustment, that legislative choice amounts to nothing more than a unilateral decision to reduce benefits already earned. That, in our view, is a substantial impairment of the contractual obligation respecting the assumed earnings rate guarantee. Accordingly, we reject respondents' argument to the contrary.</p>\n<p>Respondents next argue by way of affirmative defense that, even if the impairment is substantial, a substantial impairment can be justified if reasonable and necessary for an important public purpose. Oregon has not adopted that view. <i>See </i><i>Hughes,</i> 314 Or. at 14 n. 16, 838 P.2d 1018 (\"the application of the rule that a state may not contract away its `police power' under Article I, section 21, of the Oregon Constitution, does not embrace the `balancing' analysis currently employed by the Supreme Court of the United States\").</p>\n<p>The parties introduced voluminous documentary and testimonial evidence concerning the financial status of PERS and the Oregon economy generally in support of and against what the Special Master described as respondents'\"economic hardship defenses.\" That evidence, and specifically the recommended findings that the Special Master derived therefrom, do not convince us that the situation rises to the high threshold that would have to be met for an economic hardship defense  were we to recognize one  to succeed.</p>\n<p>First, we emphasize that we are not dealing here with legislation that impairs private contracts. Instead, we are dealing with a statutory contract. In other words, it is one of the <i>parties</i> to the contract (the state) that now is attempting to rely on a change in circumstances to permit it to alter its contractual obligations in a constitutional manner. In that light, we note that the Special Master made, among others, the following recommended findings:</p>\n<blockquote> \"Oregon's state tax burden currently is approximately .7 percent less than the national average.\"</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \"[T]here is little voter willingness to raise taxes to provide additional government revenues.\"</blockquote>\n<blockquote> The \"capital downturn\" from 2000 through 2002, although causing a greater impact on state tax revenues than previous economic downturns over the past two decades, \"did not compare in magnitude or duration to the Great Depression of the 1930s.\"</blockquote>\n<p>To be sure, the Special Master's report contains other recommended findings that demonstrate that the state's recent fiscal status is both serious and has resulted in substantial detriments to the provision of governmental services across the state. We accept all those findings. Taken together, however, they do not justify a rewriting of the assumed earnings rate guarantee in a manner that would result in the elimination of earnings both promised and actually credited over time to Tier One members' regular accounts. We reject respondents' economic hardship affirmative defense and declare Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, sections 5 to 8, <i>as amended by</i> Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 625, sections 10 to 12, void. <i>See Hughes</i> 314 Or. at 31, 838 P.2d 1018 (law impairing obligation of contract \"is a nullity\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>c. Elimination of the Variable Annuity Account Program</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>(1) The Statutes</h2>\n<p>As noted, the legislature in 1967 authorized PERS members to direct a percentage of their contributions to equity investments, by creating a variable annuity account program. Or. Laws 1967, ch. 622, § 24, <i>codified as former</i> ORS 237.197 (1967), <i>renumbered as</i> ORS 238.260 (1995). The 2001 version of that statute, which remains substantially unchanged <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1096</span> from the enactment as initially worded, provided, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"A member may elect at any time to have 25, 50 or 75 percent of contributions by the member to the fund on and after the effective date of the election paid into the Variable Annuity Account, credited to a variable account, and reserved for the purchase of a variable annuity. A member who has elected to have a percentage of contributions so paid, credited and reserved may elect at any time thereafter to have an additional 25 or 50 percent of contributions by the member, but not to exceed a maximum of 75 percent, so paid, credited and reserved. An election shall be in writing on a form furnished by [PERB] and be filed with [PERB]. An election shall be effective on January 1 following the filing thereof.\"</blockquote>\n<p>ORS 238.260(3) (2001).<sup>[49]</sup> The 2003 PERS legislation, however, added a new paragraph (b) to ORS 238.260(3), stating that, \"[n]otwithstanding any other provision of this section, a member may not contribute to the Variable Annuity Account after December 31, 2003.\" Or. Laws 2003, ch. 67, § 3.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>(2) The Parties' Arguments</h2>\n<p>All petitioners, except petitioner Sartain, argue that they have a statutory \"right\" to continue directing a percentage of their PERS contributions to equity investments via their variable accounts, and they focus not only on the use of the word \"shall\" in ORS 238.260(3) (2001), but also on the wording \"at any time,\" \"on and after,\" and \"at any time thereafter\" in that provision to support their claim that that right extends to future, rather than to only present, member contributions to PERS. Moreover, petitioners point to the legislative history of the 1967 enactment as support for their claim that the legislature intended, through establishment of the variable annuity account program, \"to allow employees the opportunity to increase their benefits.\"<sup>[50]</sup> As before with respect to the statutory provisions governing PERS members' regular accounts, petitioners argue that, by permitting no further contributions to the variable annuity account program, the 2003 PERS legislation breaches or impairs the PERS contract because the statutory provisions are</p>\n<blockquote>\"unquestionably part of the PERS Act, [are] integral to the calculation of benefits under the Act, [use] unambiguously promissory [wording], [and] contain no language excluding contributions attributable to future service from the general contractual protection and no reservation of [the] right of future amendment.\"</blockquote>\n<p>Respondents likewise advance what in essence repeats their argument concerning PERS members' regular accounts in response to petitioners' variable account claims, <i>viz.,</i> that, because members have no continuing contractual right to make contributions to PERS, they similarly have no right to direct those contributions to variable accounts. Respondents view the wording \"at anytime thereafter\" in ORS 238.260(3) (2001) not as establishing a <i>right</i> to make future contributions but, instead, as allowing a member to change his or her election at any time so long as the variable account remains available as a statutory option. Finally, respondents emphasize that nothing about the 2003 PERS legislation impacts funds held in a member's variable account as of the effective date of that legislation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1097</span> (3) Discussion</h2>\n<p>For many of the same reasons that we concluded that the statutory provisions respecting PERS members' regular accounts are terms of the PERS contract, we likewise conclude, and do so without further discussion, that the variable account provisions are as well. (We do not understand respondents to argue to the contrary.) Accordingly, we proceed to determine the meaning of those statutory contractual terms, specifically, whether they constitute a legislative promise that members would have a right for the duration of their membership in PERS to continue directing contributions to their variable accounts.</p>\n<p>From a textual standpoint, and from petitioners' perspective, the salient wording of ORS 238.260(3) (2001) is the phrase \"at any time,\" which appears two times in that subsection.<sup>[51]</sup> Read in isolation, those broad temporal references could support petitioners' contention that the legislature promised PERS members that they would be permitted to contribute to their variable accounts (as well as to increase their contributions to those accounts) for the duration of their active membership. Ascribing such an intent to the legislature, however, becomes much less supportable when other wording in the statute is considered, particularly the wording that ties a member's right \"at any time\" to contribute to a variable account to the member's \"contributions * * * <i>to the fund.</i>\" (Emphasis added.) Likewise, a member's right to increase his or her variable account election \"at any time thereafter\" is tied to \"<i>contributions by the member</i>\" <i>to the fund.</i> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p>As we have held above, the legislature did not promise members that they could <i>continue making contributions to the fund</i> throughout their membership in PERS. And, because we have upheld the legislature's 2003 decision to prohibit members from <i>further</i> contributing to the fund (and, instead, to direct member contributions to the IAP), there no longer will be fund contributions from which a percentage could be directed to a variable account. As we view the entirety of the wording of ORS 238.260(3) (2001), then, that wording does not support petitioners' claim of a promise of a continued right to invest in the variable annuity account program. Instead, at most, such a right of contribution exists only so long as members are permitted to contribute to the fund.</p>\n<p>We do, however, perceive from that wording a different legislative promise respecting the variable annuity account program that extends throughout membership in PERS. That is, for any member \"who has elected to have a percentage of contributions so paid,\" once PERB has credited those monies to the member's variable account, those contributions will be \"<i>reserved</i> for the purchase of a variable annuity.\" ORS 238.260(3) (2001) (emphasis added). Stated differently, although the wording of the statute does not support a continued right to contribute to the variable annuity account program, the wording does evince a legislative promise to reserve until the time of retirement any monies that a member has invested in the variable annuity account program for the purchase of a variable annuity.</p>\n<p>Turning next to context, we find little to support or detract from the preliminary observations that we have gleaned from the words of ORS 238.260(3) (2001). Again, we deem the actions of the 1981 Legislative Assembly to be the focal point for our analysis, because it was that body that fundamentally restructured the system to provide for the Full Formula benefit. Consistently with the comprehensive nature of the 1981 legislation, the legislature also added a provision to <i>former</i> ORS 237.197 (1979), <i>renumbered as</i> 238.260(12) (1995), to account for those members who had made contributions to the variable annuity account program or who had made contributions on salary in excess of $4,800 per year between 1956 and 1967. Or. Laws 1981, ch. 761, § 6. For such members, the legislature directed PERB to determine <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1098</span> the difference between each member's total account balance and what that total would have been had the member either not participated in the variable annuity account program, not made excess contributions, or both. <i>Id.</i> The value of the difference, whether positive or negative, then resulted in either an increase or a decrease to the member's monthly service retirement allowance.</p>\n<p>Through that amendment to what is now ORS 238.260(12), the 1981 Legislative Assembly not only preserved the excess contributions that some members had made before 1967 and contributions to the variable annuity account program between 1967 and 1981, but also permitted the variable annuity account program to remain as a meaningful part of the system. (Otherwise, absent the Money Match or the Pension Plus Annuity yielding a higher pension component, increases or decreases to a member's variable account would serve only to increase or decrease the amount that an employer would have to pay to fund the pension component of the member's service retirement allowance under the Full Formula.) What that limited contextual evidence does not suggest, however, is that the legislature promised members that they would have the ability to contribute to their variable accounts throughout their membership in PERS. That amendment, instead, concerned only the effect that a variable account could have on the service retirement allowance that a member ultimately would receive at retirement.<sup>[52]</sup></p>\n<p>In light of the foregoing discussion, we conclude that there is nothing inconsistent between the earlier promise that the legislature made with respect to the variable annuity account program  that any funds placed into variable accounts would be reserved for the purchase of a variable annuity  and the 2003 Legislative Assembly's decision to discontinue permitting PERS members to contribute to their variable accounts. Consequently, there can be no breach or impairment of the obligations set out in the PERS contract in that respect.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>d. Cost-of-Living Adjustments (COLAs)</h2>\n<p>As briefly explained earlier, both before and after the 2003 PERS legislation, ORS 238.360 (2001) required (and still requires) PERB to determine and apply annual COLAs, based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI), to retired PERS members' service retirement allowances. However, parts of the 2003 PERS legislation effectively suspend COLAs on particular service retirement allowances, until specified financial conditions are met, for certain retired Tier One members. The legislature took that step in response to a trial court ruling in the <i>City of Eugene</i> litigation, described below. <i>Strunk</i> and <i>Sartain</i> petitioners argue that that part of the 2003 legislation constitutes either an impairment or a breach of the statutory PERS contract. We address those contentions below, beginning with a discussion of the <i>City of Eugene</i> litigation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>(1) Background</h2>\n<p>As discussed earlier in this opinion, the PERS statutes provide for the maintenance of various reserve accounts. Most significant to the <i>City of Eugene</i> litigation are the contingency reserve and the gain-loss reserve.</p>\n<p>ORS 238.670(1) describes the parameters of the contingency reserve, providing that PERB \"shall set aside\" as much interest and other income received through investment as PERB \"may deem advisable, not exceeding seven and one-half percent of the combined total of such income[,]\" for the purpose of maintaining a contingency reserve to \"prevent any deficit of money available for the payment of retirement allowances, due to interest fluctuations, changes in mortality rate or * * * other contingency.\" ORS 238.670(1). PERB has not funded a contingency reserve since 1979.</p>\n<p>ORS 238.255 (2001) (now ORS 238.255(1)) describes the parameters of the \"gain-loss reserve,\" to which PERB is required to charge certain amounts. With respect to the gain-loss reserve, the Special Master found:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1099</span> \"Before the enactment of the 2003 [PERS] legislation, PER[B] maintained a `gain-loss reserve' in which it set aside a portion of annual fund earnings to ensure that sufficient assets would be available to pay guaranteed benefits at the assumed earnings rate. In years when fund earnings exceeded the guaranteed amount, PERB deposited a portion of those funds into the gain-loss reserve. The evidence showed that it is reasonable to fund the gain-loss reserve at a level that would fund projected Tier One guaranteed earnings credits for a 30-month period, which, using the current assumed earnings rate of 8 percent, would set the reserve balance at 20 percent of the fund's value.\"</blockquote>\n<p>As to PERB's treatment of the gain-loss reserve and the contingency reserve in the late 1990s, the Special Master found as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"In 1999, the fund earned approximately $7.5 billion, or 24.89 percent of its value. [PERB credited 20 percent to Tier One regular accounts for that year.] PERB allocated approximately $1.3 billion to the gain-loss reserve, which left it funded at approximately 72 percent of [its] new 30-month goal. After PERB allocated 1999 earnings, the gain-loss reserve had a positive balance of $4.744 billion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"If PERB had fully funded the contingency reserve for 1999 by crediting 7.5 percent of the fund's earnings as authorized by ORS 238.670(1) and, if PERB had fully funded the gain-loss reserve according to its 30-month goal, approximately 11.33 percent would have been available for crediting to Tier One accounts.\"<sup>[53]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>The funding gap created by PERB's choice not to fund the two accounts fully, as the Special Master described it, meant that an imbalance existed that PERB sought to make up through assessments  <i>i.e.,</i> contribution rate orders  on employers. In response to those assessments, three local government employers, including the City of Eugene, challenged their 1998 and 2000 contribution rate orders by filing an action against PERB in Marion County Circuit Court. Several employers also challenged PERB's order allocating 1999 earnings. In part, the employers argued that their contribution rates would have been lower if PERB properly had funded the contingency and gain-loss reserves. All the challenges were consolidated and became the <i>City of Eugene</i> litigation. Several PERS members intervened in the litigation to defend PERB's crediting decisions respecting their regular accounts.</p>\n<p>In July 2001, the trial court held that PERB had abused its discretion by not funding the contingency reserve since 1979. The court further held that PERB had abused its discretion by crediting 20 percent interest to Tier One members' regular accounts in 1999, instead of properly funding the contingency and gain-loss reserves. The court remanded the challenged rate orders to PERB with instructions that PERB issue new rate orders consistently with the court's judgment. PERB and intervenors appealed that judgment to the Court of Appeals, which transferred the litigation to this court pursuant to Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 537, section 1, where it is now pending.</p>\n<p>Pursuant to the trial court's judgment, the Fiscal Services Division (FSD) of PERS recalculated the credits to Tier One members' regular accounts for 1999 and concluded that, if PERB properly had funded the contingency and gain-loss reserves in 1999, the appropriate credit to members' regular accounts for that year would have been 11.33 percent. Before FSD presented that figure to PERB for final approval, however, the legislature requested that information directly from FSD. The legislature subsequently enacted the 2003 PERS legislation; in Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, sections 9 and 10, <i>as amended by</i> Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 625, section 13, the Legislature effectively codifies the 11.33 percent figure as the correct 1999 crediting decision.<sup>[54]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1100</span> After the legislature enacted Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, PERB and the employer parties entered into a settlement agreement purporting to resolve the <i>City of Eugene</i> litigation. That settlement agreement provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[E]xcept in the event of a supervening change in law (such as by a legislative enactment or further court order):</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"1.3 The new 1999 earnings allocation order * * * will provide that the appropriate earnings allocation to Tier [One] regular member accounts is 11.33 [percent], that 7.5 [percent] of the 1999 earnings should have been allocated to the contingency reserve established by ORS 238.670(1), and that the gain-loss reserve created by ORS 238.670(3) should have been funded to the full extent of the former PERB's policy to maintain a gain-loss reserve sufficient to credit the assumed interest rate to Tier [One] regular member accounts during a period of 30 months of 0 [percent] earnings.\"</blockquote>\n<p>After entering into that settlement agreement, PERB moved to dismiss the appeal, but intervenors opposed that motion, and this court denied it without prejudice. As a result of the court challenges to PERB's 1999 crediting decision, that decision was potentially subject to reversal at the time that the legislature enacted Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, sections 9 and 10, <i>as amended by</i> Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 625, section 13.</p>\n<p>Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, sections 9 and 10, <i>as amended by</i> Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 625, section 13, apply to only Tier One members who receive service retirement allowances pursuant to the Money Match and who retired on or after April 1, 2000, but before April 1, 2004. As pertinent here, section 10, <i>as amended by</i> Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 625, section 13, requires PERB to recalculate two alternative service retirement allowances for those members, resulting in a \"revised\" allowance and a \"fixed\" allowance.</p>\n<p>To calculate the \"revised\" service retirement allowance, PERB first must recalculate the affected members' regular account balances as if 11.33 percent, rather than 20 percent, had been credited in 1999. PERB then must recalculate the members' service retirement allowances based on those newly calculated account balances and apply the appropriate COLAs for each calendar year since each member's retirement to the newly calculated service retirement allowance. As a result of those calculations, PERB will have determined a new service retirement allowance for each affected member as of the date of the calculation, based on an 11.33 percent credit to each member's regular account in 1999 (<i>i.e.,</i> the \"revised\" service retirement allowance). Or. Laws 2003, ch. 67, § 10(2), <i>as amended by</i> Or. Laws 2003, ch. 625, § 13. PERB thereafter is required to apply annual COLAs on members'\"revised\" service retirement allowances. Or. Laws 2003, ch. 67, § 10(2)(d).</p>\n<p>To calculate the \"fixed\" service retirement allowance, PERB must determine the amount payable to each affected member on July 1, 2003, or on the member's retirement date, whichever is later. The resulting \"fixed\" service retirement allowance may not be adjusted by annual application of a COLA. Or. Laws 2003, ch. 67, § 10(3), <i>as amended by</i> Or. Laws 2003, ch. 625, § 13.<sup>[55]</sup></p>\n<p>Finally, Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, section 10(4), <i>as amended by</i> Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 625, section 13, requires that each affected member be paid the greater of the newly calculated \"revised\" and \"fixed\" service retirement allowances. Stated differently, if an affected member's \"fixed\" service retirement allowance (which is based on a 20 percent credit in 1999, but is <i>not</i> subject to an annual COLA) exceeds that member's periodically determined \"revised\" service retirement allowance (which is based on an 11.33 percent credit in 1999 and <i>is</i> subject to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1101</span> an annual COLA), then that member will not receive annual COLAs until such time as the \"revised\" allowance exceeds the \"fixed\" allowance. From that point forward, the member will receive annual COLAs on the \"revised\" service retirement allowance.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>(2) The Parties' Arguments</h2>\n<p><i>Strunk</i> and <i>Sartain</i> petitioners argue that Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, sections 9 and 10, <i>as amended by</i> Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 625, section 13, breach the PERS statutory contract and impair contractual obligations in violation of Article I, section 21. They particularly argue, as pertinent here, that ORS 238.360 (2001), which required PERB to provide retired members with annual COLAs on their monthly service retirement allowances, is a term of the PERS contract. ORS 238.360 (2001) provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote>\"(1) As soon as practicable after January 1 each year, [PERB] shall determine the percentage increase or decrease in the cost-of-living for the previous calendar year, based on the Consumer Price Index * * *. Prior to July 1 each year the allowance which the member or the member's beneficiary is receiving or is entitled to receive on August 1 for the month of July shall be multiplied by the percentage figure determined, and the allowance for the next 12 months beginning July 1 adjusted to the resultant amount.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(2) Such increase or decrease shall not exceed two percent of any monthly retirement allowance in any year and no allowance shall be adjusted to an amount less than the amount to which the recipient would be entitled if no cost-of-living adjustment were authorized.\"</blockquote>\n<p><i>Strunk</i> and <i>Sartain</i> petitioners argue that, contrary to Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, section 10(3), <i>as amended by</i> Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 625, section 13, which calculates a \"fixed\" service retirement allowance that is not subject to an annual COLA, ORS 238.360(1) (2001) required PERB to provide COLAs on <i>all</i> service retirement allowances. In other words, <i>Strunk</i> and <i>Sartain</i> petitioners assert that affected Tier One members who are receiving \"fixed\" service retirement allowances under the 2003 PERS legislation have a contractual right to receive annual COLAs on those allowances, even though the allowances were based on a regular account balance that, in the legislature's determination, included an erroneous 20 percent credit in 1999. They argue that, when a member has performed fully under the PERS contract in reliance on the promise set out in ORS 238.360(1) (2001), that member's rights have vested and the legislature may not take away COLAs without breaching the PERS contract or unconstitutionally impairing an obligation of that contract.</p>\n<p>Respondents acknowledge that the affected Tier One members have performed fully and are entitled to receive service retirement allowances that are calculated based on amounts <i>properly</i> credited to their regular accounts. They argue, however, that petitioners seek more than that. Petitioners, respondents claim, are asserting that they have a contractual right to receive service retirement allowances that reflect an <i>improper</i> credit of 20 percent in 1999. The PERS statutes, respondents argue, do not grant petitioners the right to <i>erroneously</i> credited earnings. In fact, they assert, another statute  ORS 238.715 (which we discuss in greater detail below)  authorizes PERB to recover the over-credited amounts from petitioners, even though they are retired.</p>\n<p>Respondents also observe that, in addition to setting out specific avenues for recouping overpayments, ORS 238.715(8) allows PERB to use \"any other remedies that may be available to [it] for recovery of amounts incorrectly paid from the fund[.]\"<sup>[56]</sup> Respondents argue that, in enacting Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, section 10, <i>as amended by</i> Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 625, section 13, the legislature has provided PERB with \"other remedies\" for recouping the erroneously credited earnings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1102</span> (3) Discussion</h2>\n<p>Before turning to our analysis of petitioners' claims, we think it helpful to clarify the precise nature of our inquiry here. First, no party appears to dispute that, in creating the \"fixed\" service retirement allowance coupled with the suspension of an annual COLA, the legislature's intent was to recoup what it deemed to be overpayments to the affected members' regular accounts in 1999.<sup>[57]</sup> Second, as discussed below, respondents note that the PERS statutes contemplate that PERB erroneously might pay certain amounts to a member who already has retired and that PERB generally is permitted, as a statutory matter, to recoup erroneous payments. And, third, as respondents appear to suggest, <i>Strunk</i> and <i>Sartain</i> petitioners' <i>particular</i> contractual challenges to the COLA suspension in Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, section 10(3), in essence raise the question whether the legislature's choice <i>to preclude application of annual COLAs on fixed retirement allowances</i> was a permissible method of facilitating such a recoupment. Stated differently, by directing PERB to suspend annual COLAs on fixed retirement allowances, does the 2003 PERS legislation either impair or breach PERB's obligation to apply annual COLAs under ORS 238.360 (2001)?</p>\n<p>As with our analysis of the foregoing challenged aspects of the 2003 PERS legislation, we first determine whether ORS 238.360 constituted a term of the PERS statutory contract before the enactment of the 2003 legislation. ORS 238.360 (2001) provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote>\"(1) As soon as practicable after January 1 each year, <i>[PERB] shall determine the percentage increase or decrease in the cost of living for the previous calendar year,</i> based on the Consumer Price Index * * *. Prior to July 1 each year <i>the allowance which the member or the member's beneficiary is receiving or is entitled to receive</i> on August 1 for the month of July <i>shall be multiplied by the percentage figure determined, and the allowance for the next 12 months beginning July 1 adjusted to the resultant amount.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(2) Such increase or decrease shall not exceed two percent of any monthly retirement allowance in any year and no allowance shall be adjusted to an amount less than the amount to which the recipient would be entitled if no cost of living adjustment were authorized.\"</blockquote>\n<p>(Emphasis added.) The legislature enacted that statute in 1971, and its substance has remained unchanged, notwithstanding other interim amendments. <i>See former</i> ORS 237.060(1) (1971), <i>renumbered as</i> ORS 238.360 (1995) (setting out original statute).</p>\n<p>ORS 238.360(1), as it existed in 2001 and as presently worded, provides that PERS members' monthly service retirement allowances annually shall be adjusted to reflect \"the percentage increase or decrease in the cost of living for the previous calendar year[.]\" Like the tax provision analyzed in <i>Hughes,</i> the text of ORS 238.360(1) (2001) evinces a clear legislative intent to provide retired members with annual COLAs on their service retirement allowances, whenever the CPI warrants such COLAs. We therefore conclude that the general promise embodied in ORS 238.360(1) (2001) was part of the statutory PERS contract applicable to the group of retired members affected by the 2003 provisions at issue here. Having so concluded, we now must determine the extent of that promise.</p>\n<p>We return to the wording of the statute and, specifically, the requirement that, prior to July 1 each year, \"the <i>allowance</i> which the member or the member's beneficiary <i>is receiving or is entitled to receive</i>\" on August 1 for the month of July must be subject to a COLA. ORS 238.360(1) (2001) (emphasis added). The context of ORS 238.360(1) (2001), which includes other related statutes, <i>PGE,</i> 317 Or. at 611, 859 P.2d 1143, assists our reading of the emphasized wording. As noted earlier, ORS 238.715 (2001) provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote>\"(1) <i>If [PERB] determines that a member</i> of the system or any other person receiving a monthly payment from the * * * [f]und <i>has received any amount in</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1103</span> <i>excess of the amounts that the member or other person is entitled to under this chapter,</i> [PERB] may recover the overpayment or other improperly made payment by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(a) Reducing the monthly payment to the member or other person for as many months as may be determined by [PERB] to be necessary to recover the overpayment or other improperly made payment; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(b) Reducing the monthly payment to the member or other person by an amount actuarially determined to be adequate to recover the overpayment or other improperly made payment during the period during which the monthly payment will be made to the member or other person.\"</blockquote>\n<p>(Emphasis added.) As is apparent from the text of ORS 238.715(1) (2001), the legislature has anticipated that PERB might pay amounts from the fund in error-that is, a member (or other person, such as a beneficiary) might be paid more from the fund than that member is \"entitled\" to \"receive[ ]\" under the PERS statutes. And, in the event that such an overpayment occurs, the legislature further has provided that PERB may recover that overpayment.</p>\n<p>In light of the identical wording in ORS 238.360 (2001) and ORS 238.715(1) (2001), regarding allowances that a member is \"entitled to receive\" and amounts \"received\" that exceed those to which a member is \"entitled,\" we conclude that the promise set out in ORS 238.360(1) (2001) respecting the application of annual COLAs does not extend to erroneous overpayments included in a member's service retirement allowance that the member was not entitled to receive. However, the promise does extend to properly calculated service retirement allowances.</p>\n<p>Having defined the scope of the legislature's promise, we turn to the 2003 PERS legislation to determine whether  and, if so, to what extent  it is inconsistent with that promise. As explained earlier, Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, section 10, <i>as amended by</i> Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 625, section 13, provides that the original service retirement allowance for each retired Tier One member who is affected by that section shall be recalculated in two ways, resulting in a \"revised\" service retirement allowance and an alternative \"fixed\" service retirement allowance. As also noted above, the \"revised\" service retirement allowance continues to be subject to an annual COLA under ORS 238.360(1). The \"fixed\" service retirement allowance is set at the amount that was payable to the retired member as of July 1, 2003, or as of the member's retirement date, whichever is later, and is not subject to an annual COLA under ORS 238.360(1). The crux of the question before us, then, is whether the \"fixed\" service retirement allowance calculated under Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, section 10(3), <i>as amended by</i> Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 625, section 13, either does or does not qualify as an allowance that is subject to an annual COLA under ORS 238.360(1) (2001). Stated more specifically, does the \"fixed\" service retirement allowance represent payment of an \"allowance\" that the member was not \"entitled to receive?\"</p>\n<p>The answer to that question is no. It is true that the legislature's apparent intent in creating the \"fixed\" service retirement allowance  most notably, when coupled with elimination of any otherwise applicable COLA  was to allow PERB to recoup certain amounts credited to the affected members' accounts in 1999 (and which the 2003 Legislative Assembly deemed to be overpayments). However, the \"fixed\" service retirement allowance <i>itself</i> represents a <i>determined allowance</i>  that is, an allowance expressly determined by the legislature. In light of that legislative determination, the \"fixed\" service retirement allowance cannot be said to transfer to the affected member any funds to which the member (again, in the legislature's determination) was not entitled. As such, the \"fixed\" service retirement allowance falls within the scope of the promise set out in ORS 238.360(1) (2001)  that is, that PERB annually apply a COLA to each affected member's allowance (in years in which the CPI warrants such a COLA)-because the allowance represents funds that the member, by legislative determination, is \"entitled to receive.\"</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1104</span> We therefore conclude that the elimination of annual COLAs from the \"fixed\" service retirement allowance, as set out in Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, section 10(3), is inconsistent with the legislature's promise set out in ORS 238.360(1) (2001). Having done so, we next must determine whether that inconsistency amounts to a breach or an impairment of that obligation under the PERS contract. As to that question, this court's decision in <i>Eckles,</i> 306 Or. 380, 760 P.2d 846, is instructive.</p>\n<p>As explained earlier, <i>Eckles</i> involved legislation that had transferred surplus funds from the IAF  which, by statute, were to be used for only workers' compensation purposes  to the General Fund. There, as here, the legislature's intent in transferring the funds had been to attain a legislative goal that, generally speaking, appeared legitimate and was not in dispute (in <i>Eckles,</i> avoiding a state budget deficit). However, it was the legislature's method for attaining that goal that, in the court's determination in <i>Eckles,</i> had contractual implications for the state. Specifically, the court concluded that the part of the legislation that had <i>eliminated</i> the state's obligation to use IAF funds in the statutorily specified manner constituted an unconstitutional impairment of the state's contractual obligation. 306 Or. at 399, 760 P.2d 846. The court further concluded that the part of the legislation that had directed the transfer of funds <i>amounted to a mandate that the state breach the contract. Id.</i> at 400, 760 P.2d 846.</p>\n<p>Applying <i>Eckles</i> to the statutory contractual issue before us now, it is indisputable that the promise set out in ORS 238.360(1) (2001) respecting annual COLAs remains part of the PERS statutory scheme applicable to the affected group of retired members. However, by precluding application of annual COLAs to \"fixed\" service retirement allowances determined for those affected members, Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, section 10(3), amounts to a directive from the legislature to PERB to breach the promise set out in ORS 238.360(1) (2001) with respect to those members. We conclude, as petitioners contend, that that aspect of the 2003 PERS legislation breaches a term of the PERS contract. <i>See </i><i>Eckles,</i> 306 Or. at 400-02, 760 P.2d 846 (so explaining in similar circumstances); <i>see also </i><i>Hughes,</i> 314 Or. at 32-33, 838 P.2d 1018 (same).<sup>[58]</sup></p>\n<p>Having so concluded, we now must address as a final matter the disposition of petitioners' claims for relief respecting the above-described COLA provisions of the 2003 PERS legislation. As explained, Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, section 10(3), breaches the PERS contract by directing PERB not to provide annual COLAs on \"fixed\" service retirement allowances. Normally, this court leaves to the legislature, as the \"most appropriate branch of government in the first instance,\" <i>Hughes,</i> 314 Or. at 33 n. 36, 838 P.2d 1018, the choice as to which remedy to select when legislation breaches a statutory contract. Here, however, under what we deem to be unique circumstances, we conclude that the prudent dispositional action is to invalidate the offending statutory wording. Accordingly, we declare that part of Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, section 10(3), that provides, \"[t]he fixed service retirement allowance may not be adjusted under ORS 238.360,\" to be void. The effect of our choice to declare that part of the law to be void is that petitioners will be returned  at least for the time being  to the same position in which they would have been if the legislature had not enacted the COLA suspension.<sup>[59]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1105</span> e. Actuarial Equivalency Factors</h2>\n<p>As noted earlier in this opinion and as explained more fully below, part of the 2003 PERS legislation modifies the calculation of service retirement allowances for certain PERS members who entered the system before 1999, by adopting new actuarial equivalency factors (AEFs). All petitioners challenge that part of the legislation, as discussed below.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>(1) Background</h2>\n<p>We take the following description of PERB's approach toward AEFs from the Special Master's report:</p>\n<blockquote>\"From time to time, after consulting with its actuary,[<sup>[60]</sup>] PERB has adopted AEFs for use in the administration of the fund. AEFs are based on assumptions concerning the future earnings of the fund and members' expected mortality rates. AEFs are used to convert lump sum account balances to monthly payment streams and to change one optional benefit payment form to another. When converting a lump sum to a monthly benefit, the lump sum and the monthly benefit payments are actuarially equivalent if both forms of payment have the same present value. Two of the three types of PERS retirement benefits  Money Match and Pension Plus Annuity  are calculated based on AEFs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"Before 1978, PERB used a substantial number of AEF tables that applied to particular categories of members. In 1978, PERB adopted two simplified sets of actuarial tables, one each for male and female members. The tables for female members produced a lower monthly retirement allowance, because they assumed that females would, on average, have longer life spans after retirement than males.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"In <i>Henderson v. State,</i> U.S. District Court Case No. CV74-538, the court concluded that the use of separate gender-based calculations was unlawful. [[<sup>[61]</sup>] In 1978, PERB adopted the male-only actuarial factors for all PERS members. That process commonly was referred to as `topping up' the AEF tables. The topped-up tables increased employer contribution rates by 0.49 percent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"In 1978, PERB adopted a 7 percent assumed earnings rate for the fund. In 1979, PERB increased the assumed earnings rate to 7.5 percent. However, it did not change the system's AEFs because (1) the actuary determined that members generally were living longer after retirement; and (2) new actuarial factors would have blended assumed male and female mortality rates and, therefore, would have been lower than those produced by the use of male-only tables. PERB did not change its AEFs again until 1989.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"When PERB increased the assumed earnings rate to 8 percent in 1989, it also adopted revised mortality tables. The revised AEFs were a combination of the pre-existing 7 percent earnings and 1978 male-only mortality assumptions, and new 8 percent earnings and 1989 blended male/female mortality assumptions. PERB used the new factors only if they increased member benefits; otherwise, PERB used the preexisting factors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"In 1993, PERB adopted [<i>former</i>] OAR 459-05-055 [(1993)]. That rule provided that [the] PER[S] actuary would perform an actuarial equivalency study every two years. The rule required the actuary to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1106</span> `recommend to [PERB] assumptions, factors and the rationale for any recommended changes to the actuarial tables used by [PERS].' [<i>Former</i>] OAR 459-05-055(1)(b) (1993) [, <i>renumbered as</i> OAR XXX-XXX-XXXX (1996)]. Subsection (2) of the rule provided, in part:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"`(b) All changes to the System's annuity tables shall be prospective only for allowances effective on or after the effective date of the change;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"`(c) If the consulting actuary's recommendation to change a factor would produce a lower benefit, [PERB] will not change the current factor.'</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"In the 1995 actuarial study, the actuary reported that continuing improvement in mortality rates would justify an adjustment of the system's AEFs, but he opined that [<i>former</i>] OAR [XXX-XX-XXX (1993)] * * * foreclosed the adoption of factors that would reduce member benefits. The actuary asked PERB to review the rule because mortality rates were expected to continue to improve, and the use of the existing AEFs was a significant cost consideration.\"</blockquote>\n<p>(Footnote omitted.) The actuary also explained in a July 1995 letter to PERB that the factors that PERB intended to adopt pursuant to <i>former</i> OAR 459-05-055 (1993) would not serve to achieve \"`true actuarial equivalenc[y]' because of the grandfathering of higher benefit factors over the years[.]\"</p>\n<p>In 1996, PERB both renumbered and amended <i>former</i> OAR 459-05-055 (1993) (set out in part above) to provide that AEFs would be updated for only members who joined PERS after January 1, 1999. The new rule, renumbered as OAR XXX-XXX-XXXX (1996), provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote>\"(4) * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(b) All changes to the System's actuarial equivalency factors shall be prospective only for that portion of an allowance attributable to service as an active member beginning on or after the effective date of the change.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(5) Notwithstanding subsection (4)(b) of this rule, for members who established membership in PERS before January 1, 1999, as described in Oregon Laws 1995, Chapter 654, Section 2, [PERB] shall not change a factor that would produce a lower periodic or single benefit payment, and any change of factor(s) shall apply to the total allowance payable.\"</blockquote>\n<p>PERB had promulgated that rule in response to legal advice that it had received regarding maintaining the fund's status as a qualified governmental retirement plan and trust under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC).<sup>[62]</sup></p>\n<p>The Special Master's report explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\"In 2001, PERB again reviewed the AEFs for the system. At that time, PERB adopted a policy of using factors based on current mortality assumptions if the factors adequately protected benefits previously earned under former AEFs. PERB reviewed various options for protecting accrued benefits, but it had not completed that process when it became apparent that the 2003 legislature intended to enact legislation on the same subject.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"In sum, before the 2003 legislation was enacted, PERB generally used AEFs that had been in effect since 1978 and that did not match the assumptions that the actuary used to value the system and make projections about system costs. Those factors understated the life expectancy of PERS members. When they were used to convert a member's account balance to a monthly allowance, the aggregate value of the monthly allowance was higher than the value of the account balance. Therefore, unless additional funds were contributed to the system, the account balance would have dissipated before the member's average life expectancy was reached. Put another way, because the AEFs did not match the actuary's life expectancy assumptions for the system, the amount <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1107</span> available to pay the BIF [<sup>[63]</sup>] upon a member's retirement was, other things being equal, insufficient to cover the projected costs for that member. PERS then had to `true up' the BIF by transferring additional amounts from employer accounts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"In 1995, the actuary estimated that the continued use of a `grand [ ]fathered' approach to changes in AEFs cost the system approximately 0.5 percent of payroll per year. As more members retired under the Money Match and the amount of their benefits increased, the financial impact of using outdated factors also grew. In 2002, the actuary estimated that the immediate use of updated mortality tables would decrease employer contribution rates by approximately 2.28 percent of payroll.\"</blockquote>\n<p>(Footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p>Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 68, section 2, requires PERB to adopt current actuarial equivalency factor tables that \"use the best actuarial information on mortality available at the time [PERB] adopts the tables[.]\" Those tables become effective on January 1 of the calendar year following PERB's adoption of the new tables. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Further, Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 68, section 4, <i>as amended by</i> Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, section 40, and Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 625, section 16, modifies the calculation for the annuity components of the service retirement allowances for certain members who entered the system before 1999. Specifically, such members who retired (or will retire) on or after July 1, 2003, will have their annuity components calculated under the new legislation, which directs PERB to use one of two calculations, whichever produces the greater benefit. The first requires application of the AEFs in effect as of the member's effective retirement date to the retiring member's account balances on that date; the second creates an account balance as of June 30, 2003, that consists of only the member's contributions and earnings credited as of that date, and PERB then determines the member's annuity component from that balance using the AEFs in effect on June 30, 2003. That second calculation generally is referred to as the \"look-back\" provision.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>(2) The Parties' Arguments</h2>\n<p>All petitioners, except petitioner Sartain, challenge Oregon Laws, chapter 68, section 4, <i>as amended by</i> Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, section 40, and Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 625, section 16, which requires PERB to adopt updated AEFs and, beginning July 1, 2003, to apply those AEFs when calculating certain retired PERS members' annuity components. They rely primarily on OAR XXX-XXX-XXXX(5) (1996), which, as quoted above, provided:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Notwithstanding subsection (4)(b) of this rule,[<sup>[64]</sup>] for members who established membership in PERS before January 1, 1999, as described in Oregon Laws 1995, Chapter 654, Section 2, [PERB] shall not change a factor that would produce a lower periodic or single benefit payment, and any change of factor(s) shall apply to the total allowance payable.\"</blockquote>\n<p>They assert that, because PERB is the trustee of the fund and has been granted authority to adopt rules governing administration of the fund, the foregoing rule is a term of the PERS statutory contract. As such, they argue that the legislature may not remove that term by requiring PERB to calculate annuity components using updated AEFs, the likely effect of which will be to reduce their service retirement allowances.</p>\n<p>As support for that contention, petitioners argue that ORS 238.630(3)(g) (2001), a predecessor version of which is discussed further below, gave PERB \"the absolute authority\" to establish the system's actuarial factors (specifically, those in effect since 1978) and required that such factors \"shall constitute part of the system.\" They further argue <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1108</span> that ORS 238.650(2) (2001), which provided that \"[a]ll rules adopted by [PERB] become part of the written plan document of [PERS],\" reinforces their contractual right to enforce the terms of OAR XXX-XXX-XXXX(5) (1996). Because Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 68, section 4, <i>as amended by</i> Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, section 40, and Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 625, section 16, nullifies the effect of that rule, petitioners argue, it breaches the PERS contract and impairs obligations of the contract.</p>\n<p>Petitioner Dahlin presents the same argument, but adds a \"federal law\" analysis premised on his observation that PERB must maintain the fund's tax status under the IRC. His analysis is designed to illustrate that the incorporation of updated AEFs will violate provisions of the IRC, jeopardize the fund's tax status, and therefore violate petitioners' contractual rights.</p>\n<p>For their part, respondents first observe that the PERS statutes require AEFs to yield service retirement allowances that are the \"`actuarial equivalent' of members' account balances.\" Yet petitioners, in respondents' view, assert a contractual right to the use of outdated factors that, by definition, cannot produce actuarial equivalency. To support that argument, respondents cite ORS 238.630(3)(g) (2001), which required PERB to adopt new AEFs from \"time to time\" that, once applied, will calculate the \"actuarial equivalen[t] of optional forms of retirement allowances,\" and ORS 238.300(1) (2001), which required (and still requires) \"actuarial equivalen[cy]\" in converting each member's account balances at retirement into the annuity component of the member's service retirement allowance.</p>\n<p>Respondents further dismiss the validity of OAR XXX-XXX-XXXX(5) (1996) by observing that that rule departs from the aforementioned legislative mandates. Finally, respondents observe that the 2003 \"look-back\" calculation preserves the service retirement allowances that members would have received had PERB calculated their annuity components using the factors and account balances in place the day before the 2003 PERS legislation went into effect. Thus, they argue, Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 68, section 4, <i>as amended by</i> Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, section 40, and Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 625, section 16, does not reduce retroactively the service retirement allowances to which members are entitled.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>(3) Discussion</h2>\n<p>As an initial matter, we briefly dispose of petitioner Dahlin's separate IRC-based claims. First, addressing fully those IRC-based claims would require an analysis of specific IRC provisions. IRC section 7476(a), however, confers jurisdiction to determine retirement plan qualification to the United States Tax Court. It follows that engaging in the analysis that petitioner Dahlin's IRC-based claims require would be outside the scope of our jurisdiction. We therefore reject petitioner Dahlin's IRC-based claims without further discussion.</p>\n<p>Turning to the other challenges, our analysis again must begin with determining the specific terms of the PERS statutory contract.</p>\n<p><i>Former</i> ORS 237.251(3)(g) (1991), <i>renumbered as</i> ORS 238.630(3)(g) (1995), which initially provided the basis for PERB's adoption of the rule that became OAR XXX-XXX-XXXX (1996), provided:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[PERB] [s]hall determine the actuarial equivalency of optional forms of retirement allowances and establish from time to time for that purpose the necessary actuarial factors, which shall constitute a part of the system [.]\"<sup>[65]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>We again apply the <i>PGE</i> methodology, 317 Or. at 610-12, 859 P.2d 1143, to the statute to ascertain the legislature's intent and conclude that the legislature's intent is clear from the first level of analysis. As respondents argue, <i>former</i> ORS 237.251(3)(g) (1991) set out a legislative mandate that PERB periodically perform two tasks: first, to determine <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1109</span> the \"actuarial equivalency of optional forms of retirement allowances\"; and, second, to \"establish[,] from time to time[,] for [the purpose of determining the actuarial equivalency of optional forms of retirement allowances,] the necessary actuarial factors, which shall constitute a part of the system [.]\" <i>Former</i> ORS 237.251(3)(g) (1991) therefore required PERB periodically to update its actuarial factors to ensure that service retirement allowances ultimately paid, regardless of the form of those allowances,<sup>[66]</sup> satisfied an \"actual equivalency\" standard.</p>\n<p>Similarly, <i>former</i> ORS 237.147 (1991) <i>renumbered as</i> ORS 238.300(1) (1995), provided, in part, that the annuity component of each member's service retirement allowance \"shall be the actuarial equivalent\" of each member's \"accumulated contributions * * * at the time of retirement.\" In short, both statutes clearly indicate that the legislature intended for members' service retirement allowances to satisfy an \"actuarial equivalency\" standard. The legislature delegated that responsibility, which included updating the system's actuarial factors, to PERB.</p>\n<p>The PERS statutes did not define the term \"actuarial equivalent\" at the time that PERB adopted <i>former</i> OAR 459-05-055 (1993), <i>renumbered as</i> OAR XXX-XXX-XXXX (1996); that term remained undefined until 2003.<sup>[67]</sup> The PERS actuary, however, testified consistently with the following explanation of the term, as set out in the Special Master's report:</p>\n<blockquote>\"AEFs are based on assumptions concerning the future earnings of the fund and members' expected mortality rates. AEFs are used to convert lump sum account balances to monthly payment streams and to change one optional benefit payment form to another. <i>When converting a lump sum to a monthly benefit, the lump sum and the monthly benefit payments are actuarially equivalent if both forms of payment have the same present value.</i>\"</blockquote>\n<p>(Emphasis added.) That definition suggests that the concept of actuarial equivalency, as it relates to these cases, is concerned with substituting equally one form of payment for another  that is, a lump sum representing a member's total service retirement allowance for a stream of payments over time derived from that sum. In addition, it is clear that, if mortality rates improve, members' monthly allowances would decrease if AEFs properly are updated to reflect those improvements.</p>\n<p>PERB, however, has adopted a rule that essentially renders the AEFs static. OAR XXX-XXX-XXXX(5) (1996) provided that, for certain members,<sup>[68]</sup> \"[PERB] shall not change a factor that would produce a lower periodic or single benefit payment.\" That text effectively states that, even if the PERS actuary recommended that PERB update the AEFs to reflect improved mortality assumptions, PERB would not do so if it would result in lower monthly service retirement allowances for certain members. Indeed, the PERS actuary testified before the Special Master that PERB had declined to update the AEFs notwithstanding his warning that the PERB-applied AEFs were not producing actuarially equivalent benefits (as <i>former</i> ORS 237.251(3)(g) (1991) and <i>former</i> ORS 237.147(1) (1991) required) and his advice that PERB not adopt OAR XXX-XX-XXXX (1996).</p>\n<p>Petitioners argue that the last clause of <i>former</i> ORS 237.251(3)(g) (1991)  \"which shall constitute a part of the system\"  demonstrates a legislative intent to provide PERB with the absolute authority to establish, at its discretion, the system's actuarial factors. They argue that, because of that authority, the actuarial factors that PERB has established are part of the PERS statutory contract and cannot be changed without <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1110</span> either breaching or impairing their contractual rights. We disagree, for two reasons.</p>\n<p>First, petitioners' reading of the final clause of <i>former</i> ORS 237.251(3)(g) (1991) both misapprehends and devalues the clause that precedes it. Again, that provision provided:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[PERB] [s]hall determine the actuarial equivalency of optional forms of retirement allowances and establish from time to time for that purpose the necessary actuarial factors, which shall constitute a part of the system[.]\"</blockquote>\n<p>As a grammatical matter, the phrase, \"which shall constitute part of the system,\" refers to factors that <i>necessarily ensure actuarial equivalency</i> in the payment of PERS members' service retirement allowances  a standard by which, as the Special Master found, the AEFs used before the 2003 PERS legislation fell short. <i>See generally,</i> Bryan A. Garner, <i>A Dictionary of Modern American Usage</i> 648 (1998) (nonrestrictive clause provides detail as to preceding noun). Relatedly, in light of the legislature's choice to use nonrestrictive wording in the final clause, it is apparent that the legislature's primary intent was to ensure that PERB update the AEFs as necessary to produce actuarial equivalency in the calculation of members' service retirement allowances. <i>See id.</i> (nonrestrictive clauses generally provide supplemental detail relating to preceding noun, as opposed to more essential detail); <i>see also generally </i><i>Feero v. Housley,</i> 205 Or. 404, 415, 288 P.2d 1052 (1955) (court presumes that legislature meant exactly what it stated within statutory provision).</p>\n<p>Petitioners' suggested reading of <i>former</i> ORS 237.251(3)(g) (1991) also renders that provision internally inconsistent, effectively directing PERB to establish proper AEFs to ensure actuarial equivalency in calculating PERS members' service retirement allowances on the one hand, while providing PERB with authority to make those factors permanent on the other. That is not a plausible reading of the statute. To the contrary, the statutory wording demonstrates that the legislature intended for PERB to ensure that a retired member's stream of monthly payments would be the actuarial equivalent of that member's total service retirement allowance. And, in so doing, PERB was required, \"from time to time for that purpose[,]\" <i>former</i> ORS 237.251(3)(g) (1991), to establish the actuarial factors necessary to produce that result. Nowhere in chapter 237 (now chapter 238) did the legislature evince any contrary intent. And, no part of that chapter suggests that the legislature intended to give PERB the authority to make its AEFs permanent.</p>\n<p>Based on the foregoing, we reject petitioners' argument that the legislature intended in <i>former</i> ORS 237.251(3)(g) (1991), which, as noted, provided the basis for PERB's adoption of OAR 459-05-055 (1993), <i>renumbered as</i> OAR XXX-XXX-XXXX (1996), to freeze the AEFs in place at that time, as part of the statutory contract. It follows that nothing about Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 68, sections 2 and 4, <i>as amended by</i> Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, section 40, and Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 625, section 16, breaches or impairs an obligation of the PERS contract.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E. <i>State Constitutional Claim Under Article I, Section 20</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Petitioner Dahlin argues that the 2003 PERS legislation discriminates on the basis of age in violation of the equal privileges and immunities clause of Article I, section 20, of the Oregon Constitution.<sup>[69]</sup> More specifically, he argues that the Special Master's findings indicate that the 2003 legislation will have a disparate impact on the service retirement allowances of \"older workers\" as opposed to those of younger workers. He argues that, because the 2003 legislation denies older workers benefits that it specifically confers to younger workers, it violates his rights under Article I, section 20.</p>\n<p>Petitioner Dahlin uses various terms to describe the purported \"class\" to which he belongs. On one hand, he argues that the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1111</span> 2003 PERS legislation denies benefits to \"older workers\"  a term that he does not define  that it confers to younger workers, but, on the other, he asserts membership in a specific class, namely, Tier One members aged 40 and older. However, even assuming that either categorization is sufficient to define a class for the purposes of Article I, section 20, petitioner Dahlin cannot prevail as a member of either class, as explained below.</p>\n<p>As to petitioner Dahlin's argument based on a class of \"older workers,\" the Special Master's report states that \"mid-career employees  that is, those within 10 years of retirement  [will] experience greater impacts on their future benefits\" as a result of the 2003 PERS legislation. According to his report, those members are aged 42 to 52. His report indicates further that members aged 57 are expected to receive benefits greater than those received by mid-career members and even than those received by members aged 37. That data indicates that the oldest group of members are projected to receive benefits in excess of those received by many younger members. Petitioner Dahlin presents no additional evidence nor any evidence to the contrary. In fact, he relies exclusively on the findings set out in the Special Master's report, but he reaches a conclusion exactly opposite to that which is inescapable based on the data set out in that report. We conclude that, even if this court were to agree that \"older workers\" compose a recognizable class under Article I, section 20, petitioner Dahlin cannot prevail on his claim here because the evidence simply does not support his assertion that the 2003 PERS legislation treats \"older workers\" disparately from younger ones.</p>\n<p>As to petitioner Dahlin's argument based on a class of \"Tier One members aged 40 and older,\" that argument essentially asserts age discrimination within the broader \"class\" of Tier One members. Being a Tier One member, however, is a status created entirely by the PERS statutory scheme. As this court has explained, the legislature is free to create statutory classes and to create distinctions among those classes. <i>Greist v. Phillips,</i> 322 Or. 281, 292, 906 P.2d 789 (1995). What the legislature may not do, however, is create distinctions based on characteristics that exist independent of the terms of legislation. <i>Crocker and Crocker,</i> 332 Or. 42, 54-55, 22 P.3d 759 (2001). As noted above, petitioner Dahlin has failed to prove any distinction based on age. He therefore is left to rely entirely on his status as a Tier One member. Because that classification was created by the statutory scheme at issue and does not exist independently of that scheme, it cannot serve as a basis for petitioner Dahlin to assert an Article I, section 20, violation. We therefore reject his claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>F. <i>Remaining Constitutional Claims</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In addition to the claims for relief that we have addressed, various petitioners also challenge parts of the 2003 PERS legislation based on the \"takings\" provisions of the Oregon Constitution and the United States Constitution, Or. Const., Art. I, § 18; U.S. Const., Amends. V, XIV, and the Contracts Clause of the United States Constitution, U.S. Const., Art. I, § 10. The foregoing holdings dispose of those claims, either because we have voided the challenged legislation in light of petitioners' state contract claims or because our determination of the particular obligations set out in the PERS contract obviates the fundamental premise of petitioners' remaining claims (that is, that the PERS contract granted them \"rights\" that cannot be breached, impaired, or taken for public use). We therefore need not discuss those claims further.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>\"The function of the court is to declare the law as it is and not what it thinks it ought to be.\" <i>Wallace v. International Ass'n,</i> 155 Or. 652, 661-62, 63 P.2d 1090 (1937). We offer that nearly 70-year-old statement from our predecessors on this bench neither in apology nor as commentary on the various legislative and executive policy choices  both past and present  that these cases have brought before us. Instead, we reiterate that pronouncement here because we think that it is both correct and reflective of our efforts to resolve these compelling issues  efforts that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1112</span> counsel and the parties themselves advanced considerably through their diligent and capable conduct of this litigation.</p>\n<p>We conclude that, in two respects, petitioners have prevailed on their claims for relief. First, petitioners in each of the cases correctly have argued that the provisions of the 2003 PERS legislation that alter the manner in which earnings are credited to the regular accounts of Tier One members impair an obligation of the statutory PERS contract in violation of Article I, section 21, of the Oregon Constitution. As such, those provisions are void and of no effect. Second, <i>Strunk</i> and <i>Sartain</i> petitioners are correct in their assertion that the provision of the 2003 PERS legislation that directs PERB to not apply annual COLAs to certain retired members' \"fixed\" service retirement allowances breaches the contrary obligation of the PERS contract to do so; that provision also is declared void and of no effect. In all other respects, we conclude that petitioners' claims for relief are not well taken.</p>\n<p>Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, sections 5, 6, 7, and 8, <i>as amended by</i> Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 625, section 10, 11, and 12, are declared void. The final sentence in Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, section 10(3), is declared void. In all other respects, petitioners' claims for relief are denied or dismissed.</p>\n<p>BALMER, J., concurring.</p>\n<p>I join in each aspect of the majority's analysis and disposition of these proceedings, including those that follow from this court's decision in <i>Oregon State Police Officers' Assn. v. State of Oregon,</i> 323 Or. 356, 918 P.2d 765 (1996) (<i>OSPOA</i>). We appropriately have declined to revisit the questions of statutory interpretation and legislative intent that <i>OSPOA</i> addressed and decided. Our respect for that precedent, however, should not be misread as an endorsement of either the result or the reasoning in that case.</p>\n<p>To the contrary, in my view, the court in <i>OSPOA</i> lost sight of the polestar of statutory contractual analysis: clear, unambiguous, and unmistakable promissory intent. <i>See </i><i>Hughes v. State of Oregon,</i> 314 Or. 1, 17, 838 P.2d 1018 (1992) (\"a contract will not be inferred from * * * legislation unless it unambiguously expresses an intention to create a contract\"); <i>Campbell et al. v. Aldrich et al.,</i> 159 Or. 208, 213-14, 79 P.2d 257 (1938) (legislature's intention \"to create contractual obligations * * * must clearly and unmistakably appear\"; surrender of legislative control over vital public matters \"cannot be established by mere implication\"). Having lost that bearing, the court in <i>OSPOA</i> proceeded to misconstrue the \"assumed interest rate\" provision of ORS 238.255  a patently administrative provision intended to smooth fluctuations in PERS fund earnings  as both a material and a perpetual aspect of the PERS contract. <i>See OSPOA,</i> 323 Or. at 377-78, 918 P.2d 765 (construing \"assumed interest rate\" provision). Oregon's public employers and taxpayers must live with the effect of <i>OSPOA's</i> error for some time to come. Our appropriate respect for <i>stare decisis</i> in the interpretation of statutes, and more particularly of statutory contracts on which public employees have relied, compels as much. <i>OSPOA,</i> however, ought not have any more vitality than that.</p>\n<p>I concur.</p>\n<p>DURHAM, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p>I write separately to explain why I join in some but not all of the majority's analysis and conclusions.</p>\n<p>I begin by noting that I agree with the majority's invocation of the \"rule of necessity\" to allow the justices of this court to address and decide the issues in these proceedings. I also agree with the majority's determinations regarding petitioners' standing and the existence of justiciable controversies; the dismissal of petitioner Dahlin's claims under 42 USC section 1983 and on behalf of certain PERS retirees; the dismissal, on ripeness grounds, of claims by petitioners in <i>Strunk, Burt, Dahlin,</i> and <i>Evans</i> challenging Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, sections 14b(1)(b) and 14b(2); and the denial of motions to compel production of documents in the <i>Strunk</i> and <i>Dahlin</i> proceedings.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1113</span> I turn now to the majority's disposition of petitioners' other substantive challenges to the 2003 PERS legislation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>ANNUAL CREDITING OF MEMBERS' REGULAR ACCOUNTS AT ASSUMED EARNINGS RATE</h2>\n<p>The majority declares that Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, sections 5, 6, 7, and 8, <i>as amended by</i> Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 625, sections 10, 11, and 12, are void, because those provisions impair the state's contractual retirement obligation with its employees in violation of Article I, section 21, of the Oregon Constitution. That section provides, in part: \"No * * * law impairing the obligation of contracts shall ever be passed * * *.\" The cited provisions of the 2003 PERS legislation concern the legislature's cancellation of annual crediting of Tier One member regular account balances at the assumed earnings rate. I concur with the majority's conclusion in that respect.</p>\n<p>I also concur with the majority that the legislature's modification of the statutory scheme for charging public employer accounts when credited income exceeds earnings for more than five years (the \"call\") does not impair the statutory contract. The underlying contractual obligation to credit member regular accounts remains with the state regardless of the state's accounting arrangements with public employers regarding the funding of member account balances.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENTS (COLAs)</h2>\n<p>The majority also concludes that Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, section 10(3), direct the Public Employees Retirement Board (PERB) to breach the promise of annual COLAs on certain \"fixed\" service retirement allowances. 338 Or at 225, 108 P.3d at 1104. I conclude that the cited section of the 2003 legislation regarding COLAs purports to eliminate a contractual obligation of the state. As a consequence, that that provision of the 2003 legislation impairs an obligation of contract in violation of Article I, section 21, and is invalid for that reason. The legislature's attempt to suspend COLAs on properly calculated service retirement allowances for the affected retired members is void.</p>\n<p>The majority rests its breach of contract theory on its reading of <i>Eckles v. State of Oregon,</i> 306 Or. 380, 760 P.2d 846 (1988). In <i>Eckles,</i> this court examined two provisions of a statute, Oregon Laws 1982 (Special Session 3), chapter 2 (the \"Transfer Act\"). One provision of the Transfer Act, section four, eliminated the state's statutory contractual obligation to employers to use certain surplus funds in a statutory trust fund only for purposes related to the workers' compensation laws. A second provision, section two, directed the State Treasurer to transfer $81 million from that statutory trust fund to the state General Fund.</p>\n<p>The court concluded that section four of the Transfer Act impaired the state's contractual obligation under preexisting contracts with employers and was unconstitutional in that respect. The court also concluded that section two of the Transfer Act did not alter the state's contractual obligation to employers. Requiring the State Treasurer to transfer funds did nothing to change the state's contractual promise to use the funds solely for purposes related to workers' compensation laws. In the court's view, however, section two did breach the state's promise; the transfer of the funds exposed the state to a legal obligation to compensate employers for the breach.</p>\n<p>In my view, the elimination of COLAs in the 2003 PERS legislation is closely analogous to the elimination of the statutory contractual duty effected by section four of the Transfer Act, as discussed in <i>Eckles.</i> The majority's attempt to compare that aspect of the 2003 PERS legislation to the operation of section two of the Transfer Act, as discussed in <i>Eckles,</i> is unconvincing. I conclude that the majority misreads <i>Eckles.</i></p>\n<p>Nevertheless, I see no reason to dissent from the result that the majority adopts following its breach of contract analysis. The majority returns the parties to the position that they occupied before the legislature adopted its 2003 amendment, and declares that that amendment is void. As <i>Eckles</i> demonstrates, that is the proper remedy <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1114</span> when legislation impairs the obligation of a statutory contract in violation of Article I, section 21, of the Oregon Constitution. As a consequence, I concur in that aspect of the majority opinion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>ADOPTION OF NEW ACTUARIAL EQUIVALENCY FACTORS (AEFs)</h2>\n<p>The 2003 PERS legislation modifies the preexisting statutory scheme regarding PERB's application of actuarial equivalency factors (AEFs) to convert a member's account balance to a monthly allowance, among other things. Petitioners contend that, pursuant to a lawful delegation of rulemaking authority, PERB had adopted rules in 1993 (<i>former</i> OAR 459-05-055) and 1996 (OAR XXX-XXX-XXXX) that required PERB to refrain from changing any AEF if the adoption of the new factor would have the effect of lowering a periodic or single benefit payment to a member. According to petitioners, PERB's rules \"constitute[d] a part of the system,\" as ORS 238.630(3)(g) (2001) provided, from the time of their adoption. Therefore, petitioners argue, by amending certain statutes to require PERB to update its AEFs, the legislature impaired an aspect of the retirement contract between the state and the affected members of PERS.</p>\n<p>Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 68, section 2, requires PERB to adopt new AEFs that \"use the best actuarial information on mortality available at the time the board adopts the tables[.]\" Section 4 of that law incorporates the new AEFs as a part of the retirement calculus for members who retired on or after July 1, 2003, and exposes those retirees to the possibility of lower retirement allowances under the new AEFs. Petitioners contend that those sections of Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 68, impair the state's contractual obligation to its employees.</p>\n<p>The majority rejects that claim, and I concur for the following reason. There is no question that PERB's 1993 and 1996 rule, in its amended 1996 form, in absolute and unconditional terms, prohibited PERB from changing any AEF to the economic detriment of any member who established PERS membership before January 1, 1999. It is unnecessary to decide in this proceeding whether PERB exceeded its rulemaking authority in adopting those rules. The only true question is whether the statutes requiring establishment of AEFs by PERB reflect a contractual intention by the legislature, such that the Legislative Assembly in 2003 lacked authority to impair any obligation regarding AEFs that PERB's rules embodied.</p>\n<p>I assume <i>arguendo</i> that the legislature may create a binding contract by a valid delegation of authority to an administrative agency to specify contractual terms through rulemaking. However, that is not what occurred here.</p>\n<p>For many years before it enacted the 2003 PERS legislation, the legislature had required PERB to establish from time to time the necessary actuarial factors that would allow PERB to determine the actuarial equivalency of the optional forms of retirement under the system. <i>See, e.g., former</i> ORS 237.251(3)(g) (1991).<sup>[1]</sup> \"Actuarial\" means \"relating to statistical calculation esp. of life expectancy.\" <i>Webster's Third New Int'l Dictionary</i> 22 (unabridged ed. 2002). As a variable in the statistical calculation of actuarial equivalency, the factor of \"life expectancy\" has no constant and unchanging value. Rather, it is constantly in flux, shifting with the prevalence in the subject population of the various factors (<i>e.g.,</i> health history, diet, exercise, tobacco use, etc.) that influence longevity.<sup>[2]</sup><i>Former</i> ORS <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1115</span> 237.251(3)(g) (1991) required PERB to take account of the changing character of the factors that determine actuarial equivalency by establishing the necessary actuarial factors \"from time to time.\"</p>\n<p>There is no question that the legislature has delegated broad rulemaking authority to PERB. When PERB adopted the two rules now under consideration, <i>former</i> ORS 237.263 (1991), <i>renumbered as</i> ORS 238.650(1995), provided:</p>\n<blockquote>\"<i>Subject to the limitations of ORS 237.001 to 237.315, the board shall, from time to time, establish rules for transacting its business and administering the system</i> in accordance with the requirements of ORS 183.310 to 183.550.\"</blockquote>\n<p>(Emphasis added.) That statute has remained in effect without substantive modification through the present time. Aside from any question of the lawfulness of the 1993 and 1996 rules, that statute confirms that PERB had authority to alter those rules at any time.</p>\n<p>PERB's broad authority to alter its rules is insufficient, standing alone, to demonstrate that PERB's rules did not reflect a legislative contractual intent while they were in effect. However, in view of PERB's duty under <i>former</i> ORS 237.251(3)(g) (1991) to evaluate the accuracy of its AEFs and publish new ones from time to time, and the necessary qualifying effect of that statute on PERB's rulemaking authority in <i>former</i> ORS 237.263 (1991), I cannot read PERB's rules to create a contractual obligation that later legislation could not impair. <i>Former</i> ORS 237.263 (1991) required PERB \"from time to time\" to establish rules for conducting its business, and ORS 237.251(3)(g) (1991) and its statutory successors in force through 2001 also required PERB to establish new AEFs \"from time to time.\" Those provisions underscore the impermanence of the AEF rules on which petitioners base their claim. The foregoing discussion demonstrates that the majority correctly rejects petitioners' contract impairment claims based on PERB's 1993 and 1996 administrative rules.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>PETITIONER DAHLIN'S AGE DISCRIMINATION CLAIM</h2>\n<p>The majority addresses and rejects the claim of petitioner Dahlin that the 2003 PERS legislation discriminates against him on the basis of age in violation of Article I, section 20, of the Oregon Constitution. I concur.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>TERMINATION OF EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS TO MEMBER ACCOUNT; LOSS OF CREDITS TO MEMBER ACCOUNT AND ENHANCEMENTS TO RETIREMENT ALLOWANCE</h2>\n<p>The 2003 PERS legislation terminates the longstanding statutory plan for funding a key component of public employee retirement allowances, the member account. The result is that, for affected Tier One employees, decades-old statutory requirements for credits to member accounts and employer matching contributions no longer will apply. Petitioners argue that those changes inevitably will lead to reduced retirement allowances in violation of their retirement contract with the state. Moreover, they contend, because employee retirement allowances will fall under the 2003 PERS legislation, public employers will pay COLA adjustments after petitioners retire on the basis of illegally reduced retirement allowances, thus compounding the economic injury to petitioners. To evaluate petitioners' impairment of contract claim in this respect, it is necessary to put in the proper context the requirements for member accounts that were in place before enactment of the 2003 PERS legislation.</p>\n<p>The payment that an eligible member of the PERS system receives on retiring is known as a service retirement allowance. ORS 238.300 (2001) provided:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1116</span> \"Upon retiring from service at normal retirement age or thereafter, a member of the system shall receive a <i>service retirement allowance which shall consist of the following annuity and pensions:</i> * * *.\"</blockquote>\n<p>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p>As that clause makes clear, two sources of funds constitute the service retirement allowance: an annuity and pensions. ORS 238.005 (2001) defined \"annuity\" and \"pension\" as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"For purposes of this chapter:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(1) `Annuity' means payments for life derived from contributions made by a member as provided in this chapter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(15) `Pension' means annual payments for life derived from contributions by one or more public employers.\"</blockquote>\n<p>The phrase \"contributions made by a member\" in the statutory definition of \"annuity\" referred to the statutory obligation of active members to contribute six percent of their salaries to the Public Employees Retirement Fund (the fund). ORS 238.200(1)(a) (2001) provided:</p>\n<blockquote>\"An active member of the system shall contribute to the fund and there shall be withheld from salary of the member six percent of that salary.\"</blockquote>\n<p>Oregon's statutory scheme for public employee retirement always has required employees' contributions to the fund that provides the financial basis for their retirement since the creation of the present retirement system 60 years ago. That scheme also has required PERB to maintain individual accounts that reflect both the amount of member contributions to the fund and any increases in the account due to interest earnings. <i>See</i> OCLA § 90-710(2) (stating those requirements in the original public employee retirement statute in 1945). Until 2003, those provisions had not changed significantly since 1945.</p>\n<p>Several statutes in effect in 2001, as set out below, explained the nature and operation of member accounts and their central importance to the calculation of each member's service retirement allowance. ORS 238.005(13) (2001) provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote>\"(a) `Member account' means the regular account and the variable account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(b) `Regular account' means the account established for each active and inactive member under ORS 238.250.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(c) `Variable account' means the account established for a member who participates in the Variable Annuity Account under ORS 238.260.\"</blockquote>\n<p>ORS 238.200(2) (2001) provided:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The contributions of each member as provided in subsection (1) of this section shall be deducted by the employer from each payroll and transmitted by the employer to the board, which shall cause them to be credited to the member account of the member.\"</blockquote>\n<p>ORS 238.250 (2001) provided:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The board shall provide for a regular account for each active and inactive member of the system. The regular account shall show the amount of the member's contributions to the fund and the interest which they have earned. The board shall furnish a written statement thereof upon request by any member or beneficiary of the system.\"</blockquote>\n<p>ORS 238.255 (2001) explained the requirements for crediting the regular account of a Tier One member:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The regular account for an active or inactive member of the system shall be examined each year. If the regular account is credited with earnings for the previous year in an amount less than the earnings that would have been credited pursuant to the assumed interest rate for that year determined by the board, the amount of the difference shall be credited to the regular account and charged to a reserve account in the fund established for the purpose. A reserve account so established may not be maintained on a deficit basis for a period of more than five years. Earnings in excess of the assumed interest rate for years following the year for which a charge is made to the reserve account shall first be applied to reduce or eliminate the amount of a deficit. The Public Employees Retirement Board shall attempt <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1117</span> to ensure that the reserve account is funded with amounts adequate to leave a zero balance in the account when all members who established membership in the system before January 1, 1996, as described in ORS 238.430, have retired.\"</blockquote>\n<p>The statutes set out above demonstrate that the requirements regarding member contributions of salary to the fund served two functions. First, they required a personal investment, over time, by the member in the system that ultimately would fund the member's retirement. Second, they afforded the member the opportunity, over time, to increase the size of the resulting member's regular account.</p>\n<p>The majority correctly reports that the PERS system created three different formulas for calculating a member's service retirement allowance and promised the members that the state would calculate their benefits according to the one formula out of the three that would provide the highest level of service retirement allowance. The three formulas are the Money Match, the Pension Plus Annuity, and the Full Formula. The Pension Plus Annuity formula applies to only Tier One members who made contributions to the system before August 21, 1981. For the Tier One members who do not meet that qualification, ORS 238.300 (2001) affords two, not three, formulas, the Money Match and the Full Formula. It is undisputed that, as petitioners argue, the size of the member's service retirement allowance under the Money Match and Pension Plus Annuity formulas turns directly on the size of the accumulated percentage-of-salary contributions and interest on those contributions in the member's regular account.</p>\n<p>The three formulas arise from the terms of ORS 238.300, which in 2001 provided:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Upon retiring from service at normal retirement age or thereafter, a member of the system shall receive a service retirement allowance which shall consist of the following annuity and pensions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(1) A refund annuity which shall be the actuarial equivalent of accumulated contributions by the member and interest thereon credited at the time of retirement, which annuity shall provide an allowance payable during the life of the member and at death a lump sum equal in amount to the difference between accumulated contributions at the time of retirement and the sum of the annuity payments actually made to the member during life shall be paid to such person, if any, as the member nominates by written designation duly acknowledged and filed with the board or shall otherwise be paid according to the provisions of this chapter for disposal of an amount credited to the member account of a member at the time of death in the event the member designates no beneficiary to receive the amount or no such beneficiary is able to receive the amount. If death of the member occurs before the first payment is due, the member account of the member shall be treated as though death had occurred before retirement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(2)(a) A life pension (nonrefund) for current service provided by the contributions of employers, which pension, <i>subject to paragraph (b) of this subsection,</i> shall be an amount which, when added to the sum of the annuity under subsection (1) of this section and the annuity, if any, provided on the same basis and payable from the Variable Annuity Account, both annuities considered on a refund basis, results in a total of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(A) For service as a police officer or firefighter, two percent of final average salary multiplied by the number of years of membership in the system as a police officer or firefighter before the effective date of retirement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(B) For service as a member of the Legislative Assembly, two percent of final average salary multiplied by the number of years of membership in the system as a member of the Legislative Assembly before the effective date of retirement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(C) For service as other than a police officer, firefighter or member of the Legislative Assembly, 1.67 percent of final average salary multiplied by the number of years of membership in the system as other than a police officer, firefighter or <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1118</span> member of the Legislative Assembly before the effective date of retirement.[<sup>[3]</sup>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(b) <i>A pension under this subsection shall be at least:</i>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(A) The actuarial equivalent of the annuity provided by the accumulated contributions of the member.[<sup>[4]</sup>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(B) For a member who made contributions before August 21, 1981, the equivalent of a pension computed pursuant to this subsection as it existed immediately before that date.[<sup>[5]</sup>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(c) As used in this subsection, `number of years of membership' means the number of full years plus any remaining fraction of a year for which salary was paid and contributions to the Public Employees Retirement System made. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, in determining a remaining fraction a full month shall be considered as one-twelfth of a year and a major fraction of a month shall be considered as a full month. Membership of a school district employee, an employee of the State Board of Higher Education engaged in teaching or other school activity at an institution of higher education or an employee of the Department of Human Services, the Oregon Youth Authority, the Department of Corrections or the State Board of Education engaged in teaching or other school activity at an institution supervised by the authority, board or department, for all portions of a school year in a calendar year in which the district school, institution of higher education or school activity at an institution so supervised in which the member is employed is normally in session shall be considered as a full one-half year of membership. The number of years of membership of a member who received a refund of contributions as provided in ORS 237.976(2) is limited to the number of years after the day before the date on which the refund was received. The number of years of membership of a member who is separated, for any reason other than death or disability, from all service entitling the member to membership in the system, who withdraws the amount credited to the member account of the member in the fund during absence from such service and who thereafter reenters the service of an employer participating in the system but does not repay the amount so withdrawn as provided in this chapter, is limited to the number of years after the day before the date of so reentering.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(3) An additional life pension (nonrefund) for prior service credit, including military service, credited to the member at the time of first becoming a member of the system, as elsewhere provided in this chapter, which pension shall be provided by the contributions of the employer.\"</blockquote>\n<p>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p>The Money Match formula in that statute derives particularly from the terms of ORS 238.300(2)(b)(A) (2001).<sup>[6]</sup> The Special Master described the operation of the Money Match formula as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[U]nder the Money Match method, a retired member receives an annuity based on his or her member account balance, which is matched by an equal annuity that the member's employer or employers funds. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1119</span> PERB historically has calculated the Money Match benefit by determining the balance in the member's regular account, adding the balance in the member's variable account, if any, and multiplying the combined balance by an AEF. A benefit in an equal amount is then added and charged to the employer's account. The resulting retirement allowance is therefore twice the amount of the benefit resulting from the member's own annuitized account balances.\"</blockquote>\n<p>Special Master's Report at 13.</p>\n<p>The legislature created the Pension Plus Annuity formula in 1967, Oregon Laws 1967, chapter 622, and, as already noted, it applies only to PERS members who have made contributions before August 21, 1981. The Special Master described the operation of the Pension Plus Annuity formula as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The Pension Plus Annuity method is available only to members who made PERS contributions before August 21, 1981. Under that method, PERS calculates a pension equal to 1.0 percent of the member's final average salary (1.35 percent for legislators, and police and fire employees) for each year of service. An annuity calculated by multiplying the member's account balance by an actuarial equivalency factor (AEF) is added to the pension. The retirement allowance is the sum of the formula pension and the member's annuitized account balance. Under the Pension Plus Annuity method, the retirement allowance is fully funded by employers.\"</blockquote>\n<p>The legislature created the Full Formula pension benefit in 1981. Or. Laws 1981, ch. 616, § 4. The Special Master described the operation of the Full Formula pension as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"PERS staff calculates the Full Formula allowance by multiplying the retiring member's final average salary and years of service by a factor. The formula provides 50 percent of final average salary for career employees (25 years of police/fire service, or 30 years of general service). Thus, the Full Formula calculation consists of three components: (1) the member's final average salary; (2) the member's years and months of creditable service as of the date of retirement; and (3) a factor set by statute at 1.67 percent for general service employees and 2.0 percent for legislators, police officers, and firefighters.7 The member is entitled to an annuity in an amount equal to the member's final average salary multiplied by the length of creditable service multiplied by the applicable statutory percentage factor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>7 \"The Full Formula benefit for legislators, police, and fire members provides a higher multiplier that allows those members to receive a more favorable retirement benefit, by allowing earlier retirement at a full benefit, than is provided for members in general service.\"</blockquote>\n<p>It is important to note that ORS 238.300(2)(a) (2001) provided that the Full Formula method was \"subject to paragraph (b) of this subsection [.]\" The cited paragraph (b) (<i>i.e.,</i> ORS 238.300(2)(b)), stated that \"[a] pension under this subsection shall be at least:\", and then described the Money Match and Pension Plus Annuity formulas. When I read those passages together, they indicate without ambiguity that the legislature guaranteed that the pension portion of the qualified retiring member's service retirement allowance, when calculated under the Full Formula method, would not fall below the amount of the pension to which the employee would be entitled under either the Money Match formula or, if it applied, the Pension Plus Annuity formula.</p>\n<p>The foregoing discussion indicates that the preexisting PERS system required Tier One members to contribute six percent of their salary, either through payroll deduction or by employer \"pick-up,\" to the fund, but entitled members to accumulate those contributions, together with interest on the contributions, in each member's regular account. That scheme created a tangible incentive for Tier One members to accumulate as large a regular account as possible, because, at retirement, the state guaranteed that the size of the regular account, among other factors, would determine the size of the member's service retirement allowance. Finally, because the Money Match and, as applicable, the Pension Plus Annuity formulas operated as a financial floor beneath which the pension <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1120</span> component could not fall, the incentive that I identify above existed for all Tier One members regardless of the particular formula that PERS used to calculate their service retirement allowance.</p>\n<p>In 2003, the legislature amended ORS 238.200, which now prohibits any future contributions to the fund and, thus, to the member's regular account on or after January 1, 2004. ORS 238.200(4) provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Notwithstanding subsections (1) to (3) of this section, a member of the system, or a participating employer acting on behalf of the member pursuant to ORS 238.205, is not permitted or required to make employee contributions to the fund for service performed on or after January 1, 2004.\"</blockquote>\n<p>The new statute continues to require members to contribute six percent of their salary,<sup>[7]</sup> but now diverts those amounts into an Individual Account Program (IAP). Regular accounts will continue to exist, but PERS no longer will credit salary contributions to regular accounts. The Special Master summarized the consequences of that aspect of the 2003 PERS legislation as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The diversion of member contributions to the IAP will reduce members' future account balances for purposes of employer matching under the Money Match formula. On a system-wide basis, the elimination of employee contributions from the Money Match calculation probably will cause the Full Formula option to overtake the Money Match as the most common retirement formula. Although members will receive balances held in the IAP, those balances will not be matched by employer contributions, enhanced by cost of living increases, or annuitized at the assumed earnings rate as part of a defined benefit package.\"</blockquote>\n<p>In <i>Hughes v. State of Oregon,</i> 314 Or. 1, 12, 838 P.2d 1018 (1992), this court considered whether the legislature had impaired the PERS contract in 1991 by modifying the statute that made retirement benefits \"accrued or accruing\" under PERS exempt from state income taxation. The court acknowledged the rule that the court will not infer a contract from legislation if the law \"does not unambiguously express an intention to create a contract[.]\" <i>Id.</i> at 14, 838 P.2d 1018. The court, however, noted that the contractual nature of PERS was a settled matter:</p>\n<blockquote>\"We begin from the premise that PERS is a contract between the state and its employees. The contractual nature of such pension schemes was settled in <i>Taylor v. Mult. Dep. Sher. Ret. Bd.,</i> 265 Or. 445, 450, 510 P.2d 339 (1973).\"</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 18, 838 P.2d 1018. The court concluded that, because contractual intent of the legislature and the contractual nature of PERS were matters of settled law, \"[t]he only remaining question, therefore, is whether and to what extent <i>former</i> ORS 237.201 (1989) [the statute that exempted \"accrued or accruing\" PERS benefits from state taxation] was intended to be a term of the PERS contract.\" <i>Id.</i> at 21, 838 P.2d 1018 (footnote omitted). The court answered that question in the affirmative, because, considering the context of the tax exemption's enactment as a matter of \"primary importance,\" the legislature had included the exemption \"as part and parcel\" of the 1953 PERS statute. <i>Id.</i> at 25, 838 P.2d 1018.</p>\n<p>The <i>Hughes</i> court limited its impairment holding to those PERS retirement benefits that already had accrued in the past or were accruing at present, and distinguished those categories from benefits accruing in the future, because the preexisting PERS tax exemption statute had incorporated that express distinction. Thus, the <i>Hughes</i> court concluded, the legislature had not obligated itself by its statutory contract to treat as exempt PERS benefits received for work performed after a change in the tax exemption statute.</p>\n<p><i>Hughes</i> relied on the <i>Taylor</i> case for the proposition that, on acceptance of employment (and completion of a required six-month period of service) with a PERS employer, subsequent legislation cannot impair the employee's vested contractual interest in a pension plan. <i>Hughes,</i> 314 Or. at 20, 838 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1121</span> P.2d 1018. In <i>Taylor,</i> the plaintiff was a deputy sheriff who had served for 13 years as a jail matron, and later as a corrections officer, in Multnomah County. The county adopted a retirement ordinance, known as Ordinance No. 25, for sworn personnel who provided \"law enforcement\" services to the county. The county refused to allow the plaintiff to participate, claiming that her work in the jail did not involve \"law enforcement\" services. The county soon amended the ordinance, in Ordinance No. 29, to exclude the plaintiff more clearly, and relied on its express authority under the ordinance to determine the eligibility and qualifications of county personnel to receive benefits under the county's retirement system.</p>\n<p>This court held that the plaintiff had acquired pension rights under the original ordinance, Ordinance No. 25, because her contractual rights arose when she first had rendered service under that ordinance, <i>not</i> when she completed the service that the later Ordinance No. 29 required for receipt of pension benefits:</p>\n<blockquote>\"We conclude from the above authorities that Oregon has adopted not only the contractual concept of pensions, but, also, the concept that contractual rights can arise prior to the completion of the service necessary to a pension. * * * Such rights are subject, of course, to subsequent completion of the necessary service.\"</blockquote>\n<p><i>Taylor,</i> 265 Or. at 451, 510 P.2d 339 (citations omitted). According to <i>Taylor,</i>\"[t]he adoption of the pension plan was an offer for a unilateral contract. Such an offer can be accepted by the tender of part performance.\" <i>Id.</i> at 452, 510 P.2d 339.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>This court in <i>Taylor</i> quoted with approval the following rules of law from the <i>Restatement of the Law of Contracts</i> regarding the binding nature of the employer's offered terms in a retirement plan once the employee accepts the offer by tendering part performance:</p>\n<blockquote>\"`If an offer for a unilateral contract is made, and part of the consideration requested in the offer is given or tendered by the offeree in response thereto, the offeror is bound by a contract, the duty of immediate performance of which is conditional on the full consideration being given or tendered within the time stated in the offer, or, if no time is stated therein, within a reasonable time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"`<i>Comment:</i>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"`* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"`<i>b.</i> Tender, however, is sufficient. Though not the equivalent of performance, nevertheless it is obviously unjust to allow so late withdrawal. There can be no actionable duty on the part of the offeror until he has received all that he demanded, or until the condition is excused by his own prevention of performance by refusing a tender; but he may become bound at an earlier day. The main offer includes as a subsidiary promise, necessarily implied, that if part of the requested performance is given, the offeror will not revoke his offer, and that if tender is made it will be accepted. Part performance or tender may thus furnish consideration for the subsidiary promises * * *.'\"</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 452-53, 510 P.2d 339 (quoting <i>Restatement of the Law of Contracts</i> § 45 (1932)). <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1122</span> Applying those principles to the facts in <i>Taylor,</i> the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote>\"As applied to the present circumstances, <i>plaintiff's tender of the contributions and acceptance of the plan terminated defendants' power to revoke the offer, and plaintiff would be entitled to the benefits of the plan if she continued to work for the requisite period necessary for retirement.</i>\"</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 454, 510 P.2d 339 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Two additional authorities that this court discussed with approval in <i>Taylor</i> confirm the binding nature of an employer's offered inducements for employment once the employee accepts them by commencing service. In <i>Harryman v. Roseburg Fire Dist.,</i> 244 Or. 631, 420 P.2d 51 (1966), a public employer represented that it would allow employees to accumulate unused sick leave and pay them for it when they terminated employment. The plaintiff accepted employment. Later, the public employer revoked the sick leave policy and refused to pay the employee for the sick leave that he had accumulated during his employment. This court held that the public employer was required to honor the inducement for employment that it had made:</p>\n<blockquote>\"When plaintiff entered upon his employment with defendant he was advised that he would receive an allowance for accumulated sick leave upon termination of employment. He accepted employment upon the assumption that the allowance for sick leave was a part of his compensation for services. Since it was a part of the inducement to accept employment, it can be regarded as a contractual term of plaintiff's employment. Defendant could not, therefore, deprive plaintiff of the allowance after he had earned it.\"</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 634-35, 420 P.2d 51 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p>In <i>Adams v. Schrunk,</i> 6 Or.App. 580, 488 P.2d 831 (1971), the Court of Appeals held that a public employer was not entitled to evade, by means of a charter amendment, a provision in its original charter that allowed employees to accumulate time toward their eligibility for retirement by counting time spent in temporary service. This court in <i>Taylor</i> provided the following summary of the holding in <i>Adams</i> and expressly agreed with it:</p>\n<blockquote>\"In <i>Adams v. Schrunk,</i> 6 Or.App. 580, 488 P.2d 831 (1971), (<i>rev. denied</i> November 16, 1971), the Court of Appeals held that Portland police officers acquired a right to have time served as temporary officers included in their periods of service necessary to entitle them to a pension. At the time of the temporary service the then existing pension plan authorized this inclusion in computing the length of service necessary for a pension, and contributions were withheld from the officers' salaries. Subsequently, the plan was amended to deny the inclusion of such service. The Court of Appeals thus recognized, as <i>Crawford</i> [<i>v. Teachers' Ret. Fund Ass'n,</i> 164 Or. 77, 99 P.2d 729 (1940)] had not, that a contractual right could be established <i>before the completion</i> of the service necessary to a pension. We agree with that opinion.\"</blockquote>\n<p><i>Taylor,</i> 265 Or. at 450-51, 510 P.2d 339 (underscoring added). <i>See </i><i>Hughes,</i> 314 Or. at 20 n. 25, 838 P.2d 1018 (noting that, in <i>Taylor,</i>\"this court expressly approved of the holding in <i>Adams v. Schrunk</i> * * * \").</p>\n<p>The <i>Taylor</i> court's statement about the earlier decision in <i>Crawford</i> is significant. <i>Crawford</i> correctly had held that a teachers' retirement fund could not alter the terms of a teacher's retirement benefits after the teacher had retired. However, the court had explained its holding in terms that indicated that contract rights did not arise before the employee had rendered complete service:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[W]e think the trend of modern authority and the better-reasoned cases are to the effect that contractual relations are created and that, upon full performance by the annuitant, rights accrue which cannot be impaired by subsequent legislation * * *.\"</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 87-88, 99 P.2d 729. This court's discussion of <i>Adams</i> and <i>Crawford</i> in <i>Taylor</i> constitutes a rejection of the statement in <i>Crawford</i> that contract rights in a retirement plan do not arise before the completion of the necessary service for retirement.</p>\n<p>The final case that is pertinent to this discussion is <i>Oregon State Police Officers'</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1123</span> <i>Assn. v. State of Oregon,</i> 323 Or. 356, 918 P.2d 765 (1996) (<i>OSPOA</i>). <i>OSPOA</i> involved a contract impairment challenge to three changes to PERS that a ballot measure, Ballot Measure 8, purported to add to the state constitution. Section 10 of the measure repeated the existing requirement that members must contribute six percent of their salary to the system, but prohibited public employers, by contract or otherwise, from \"picking up\" the employees' six percent payment obligation. That provision concerned the legislature's enactment of <i>former</i> ORS 237.075 (1979), <i>renumbered as</i> ORS 238.205 (1995), which authorized public employers to agree with employees or to decide unilaterally to pick up the employee contribution to PERS. <i>See OSPOA,</i> 323 Or. at 373, 918 P.2d 765 (explaining operation of pick-up statute). Section 11 of the ballot measure withdrew the statutorily guaranteed minimum rate of return on PERS member accounts. Section 12 of the ballot measure purported to nullify a statute that allowed retiring PERS members to add accumulated unused sick leave benefits to their final average salary.</p>\n<p>The court in <i>OSPOA</i> reviewed at length the Oregon case law, including the cases discussed in this opinion, on the subject of contractual rights that arise from public employee retirement plans. Addressing section 10, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Under the <i>Taylor</i> analysis, and contrary to the state's argument here, ORS 237.075, and the state's implementation of the authority contained in that statute, promised a pension benefit that plaintiffs could realize only on retirement with sufficient years of service, that is, <i>after</i> rendering labor for the state. Plaintiffs accepted that offer by working. <i>See </i><i>Taylor,</i> 265 Or. at 452, 510 P.2d 339. The change mandated by section 10 alters the state's contractual obligation, in violation of <i>Taylor,</i> by increasing plaintiffs' cost of retirement benefits for services that, absent a lawful separation of employment, they will provide in the future. That consequence, if approved, would permit the state to retain the benefit of plaintiffs' labor, but relieve the state of the burden of paying plaintiffs what it promised for that labor. That result would frustrate plaintiffs' reasonable contractual expectations that were based on legal commitments expressly made by the state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"Once offered and accepted, a pension promise made by the state is not a mirage (something seen in the distance that disappears before the employee reaches retirement). Nullification of an express term of plaintiffs' PERS contract with the state is an impairment for purposes of Contract Clause analysis, <i>Allied Structural Steel Co. v. Spannaus,</i> 438 U.S. 234, 247, 98 S.Ct. 2716, 57 L.Ed.2d 727 (1978). Section 10 expressly and substantially changes the state's contractual promise to plaintiffs with respect to the cost of their participation in the PERS retirement plan and the benefits that they will receive on retirement. Under section 10, the cost of participation to the employee increases while the benefits that the employee ultimately will receive on retirement decrease. Unquestionably, section 10 impairs the obligation of plaintiffs' PERS contract.\"</blockquote>\n<p><i>OSPOA,</i> 323 Or. at 374-75, 918 P.2d 765 (emphasis in original; footnote omitted).</p>\n<p>In dissent, Justice Gillette opined that the majority, in analyzing section 10, had transformed a statutory permission into a promise to pick up all public employees' six percent contributions. <i>Id.</i> at 409, 918 P.2d 765 (Gillette, J., dissenting). The majority responded to Justice Gillette's criticism as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The fatal flaw in that analysis is that it `errs in failing to consider the significance of context.' <i>Hughes,</i> 314 Or. at 21 n. 27, 838 P.2d 1018. The six percent pick-up is an integral part of the underlying PERS pension contract. Unilateral termination of the six percent pick-up term of the PERS pension contract materially changes that underlying pension contract to plaintiffs' detriment and, thus, frustrates plaintiffs' reasonable reliance on the offer the state made to them and which they accepted by the tender of part performance. <i>Id.</i> at 20-21, 838 P.2d 1018.\"</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 376, 918 P.2d 765.</p>\n<p><i>OSPOA</i> went on to hold that sections 11 and 12 of Ballot Measure 8 also impaired employee contractual rights. As to those <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1124</span> conclusions, the court was unanimous. The court struck down Ballot Measure 8 in its entirety.</p>\n<p>I turn now to the analysis of the legislature's alteration in 2003 of the preexisting scheme for crediting member contributions in light of the case law discussed above. Both before and after the 2003 legislation, PERS members are subject, as they have been for many decades, to a legal requirement to contribute six percent of their salary to a discrete \"account\" in PERS. Salary contributions no longer will be credited to, and enhance the value of, member regular accounts; instead, PERS will credit salary contributions to the IAP. Also, before and after the legislative change, the regular account and IAP of each member will earn a rate of interest. What has changed is the legislature's commitment before the 2003 legislative amendment about how PERS will increase the value of those contributions before and after retirement and, consequently, the value of each member's service retirement allowance.</p>\n<p>First, the 2003 PERS legislation cancelled the preexisting unconditional obligation to increase Tier One member account balances annually by the assumed interest rate. I already have indicated that I join in the majority's determination that that change impaired the PERS contract.</p>\n<p>Second, the 2003 PERS legislation has reduced significantly the practical value of the Money Match formula by prohibiting future contributions of salary to regular member accounts and by eliminating any matching feature regarding the IAP. Before the change, PERS members could work and plan for a service retirement allowance that would reflect a pension amount not less than their accumulated salary contributions during their years of service, increased annually by at least the assumed interest rate, plus an amount not less than a pension (<i>i.e.,</i> an amount \"matched\" by the employer) that was the actuarial equivalent of the annuity that the members' accumulated contributions could provide. After the 2003 PERS legislation, the employer matching feature will not apply to member contributions made after July 1, 2003, either directly as one available retirement formula or as a minimum financial benchmark for the service retirement allowance.</p>\n<p>I conclude that that aspect of the 2003 PERS legislation constitutes an impairment of contract under this court's precedents. According to <i>OSPOA,</i> Ballot Measure 8's deprivation of the employer pick-up feature of the employee regular account contribution scheme represented an impairment of contract. By dint of logic, we must recognize that the complete prospective cancellation of that contribution scheme constitutes an even clearer impairment of contract.</p>\n<p>This court's cases defeat the majority's contrary conclusion. According to this court's case law, the proper focus is the employer's retirement benefit plan in place at the commencement of employment, together with any enhancements to that plan that the employer implements after employment begins. In no case has this court allowed a public body to modify a retirement plan to effect a practical reduction in benefits, either directly or through an alteration of the applicable formula for calculating benefits, after inducing employees to render service in reliance on the retirement plan. As <i>Taylor</i> held, and as the <i>Restatement of the Law of Contracts</i> confirms, the premise that makes the benefit plan unchangeable by the employer's unilateral act is the employer's promise, which the law implies, that the employer will not revoke the retirement plan once the employee commences service. Because the pre-2003 PERS scheme, <i>i.e.,</i> the \"offer,\" was in place when each petitioner commenced his or her employment, the state is bound by its implied promise not to revoke that offer once petitioners tendered partial performance.</p>\n<p>The majority makes two points in reaching its different conclusion. First, the majority asserts that, in 1981, the legislature adopted the Full Formula and expected that that formula would be \"a new, primary benefit calculator to the system.\" 338 Or at 191, 108 P.3d at 1086. The majority also observes that the Full Formula feature was significant because it shifted the risk of poor market performance to employers and away from employees.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1125</span> The legislature's expectation about the frequency of use of the Full Formula method as a \"primary benefit calculator\" is just that: an expectation. As the Special Master found, \"[u]ntil 1997, PERB assumed that member retirement allowances would be calculated under the Full Formula method [,]\" but the Money Match emerged instead in 1997 as the predominant formula. But the erroneous assumptions by the legislature and PERB about which retirement formula might be used most frequently as a \"primary benefit calculator\" cannot alter the fact that the pre-2003 PERS statute promised members that they would receive benefits calculated according to the most economically attractive formula from among <i>three</i> statutory formulas. Those incorrect assumptions about the frequency of use of the Full Formula and whether it would be the \"primary benefit calculator\" have no effect on the state's contractual obligation to pay the full benefits that the statute held out to employees.</p>\n<p>The majority's point also disregards the fact, confirmed in the text of ORS 238.300(2)(b) (2001), that the legislature required the employer's Full Formula pension to be \"at least\" the actuarial equivalent of the Money Match and Pension Plus Annuity formulas. Thus, as a matter of clear text, the Full Formula may be the ceiling but it is not the floor for the statutory pension component.</p>\n<p>I fail to see the significance of the fact that the Full Formula shifted greater risk of market loss to employers. The PERS statute promised members that they would receive benefits calculated according to the most economically attractive retirement benefit formula <i>regardless of market performance.</i> The addition of the Full Formula benefit in 1981 merely added one more option to the retirement calculation formulas. The risk of market loss under any of those formulas has nothing to do with their function in the calculation of promised service retirement allowances.</p>\n<p>Finally, the majority notes that the statutory provision regarding regular accounts contains no separate wording that promises that the legislature will not terminate the accumulation of member contributions in regular accounts. This court addressed and rejected a similar argument in <i>Hughes</i> that a dissenting opinion asserted. The majority in <i>Hughes</i> emphasized that the legislature's inclusion of a tax exemption statute within a larger statutory contract was a significant contextual clue about the legislature's contractual intent; the absence of promissory terms in the tax exemption statute itself was, in the court's view, immaterial. The court cited numerous United States Supreme Court cases that held that a tax exemption was a term of a larger contract, and noted:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The significant fact [in those cases] is that an underlying contract was present. This case presents an analogous situation where we are faced with an underlying contract  the PERS contract  and the question is whether the tax exemption statute is a term of that contract. Also significant is that in those cases the tax exemption terms are not, on their face, indicative of an intention not to repeal those exemptions. <i>The constitutional protection that was afforded to those provisions' obligations followed from the fact that they were part of a larger contract, not that they were promissory in and of themselves.</i>\"</blockquote>\n<p><i>Hughes,</i> 314 Or. at 21-22 n. 27, 838 P.2d 1018 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Applying that point from <i>Hughes</i> to this case, it is immaterial that the legislature did not append explicit wording to the regular account statute to confirm its unchangeability. What is significant is the statutory context. Did the legislature incorporate into the PERS contract the provisions for regular accounts and the calculation of retirement benefits from the accumulated benefits in those accounts? Clearly, the answer is yes. The majority's contrary answer is a legal error.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>ELIMINATION OF VARIABLE ACCOUNT</h2>\n<p>The Special Master found as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Before the enactment of Section 3 of HB 2003, PERS members could elect to have 25, 50 or 75 percent of their employee contributions allocated to variable accounts, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1126</span> and they were entitled to purchase a variable annuity at retirement with their variable account balances. ORS 238.260 (2001). Section 3 of HB 2003 provides that, after December 31, 2003, members no longer are permitted to direct contributions to the variable account. ORS 238.260(3)(b) (2003).</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"Section 3 does not affect contributions credited to member accounts before its effective date.\"</blockquote>\n<p>The Special Master explained the operation of the variable account system before its cancellation as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Earnings on variable accounts are first allocated to pay a proportionate share of administrative expenses, and the remainder are credited to member accounts. The PERS system never has funded a reserve from variable account earnings. For many years, PERB added the balances in the regular and variable accounts of members who retired under the Money Match, and it applied the relevant AEFs to calculate their monthly annuities. PERS then required employers to match those annuities. That practice gave members twice the difference between the earnings on their regular and variable accounts.\"</blockquote>\n<p>In essence, the variable account plan afforded members the opportunity to obtain greater growth in their regular accounts by investing a portion of their salary contributions in equities. ORS 238.260(1) explained the legislature's purpose in establishing the variable account program:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The purpose of this section is to establish a well balanced, broadly diversified investment program for certain contributions and portions of the member accounts so as to provide retirement benefits for members of the system that will fluctuate as the value and earnings of the investments vary in relation to changes in the general economy. It is anticipated that investment of those contributions and portions of the member accounts in equities will result in the accumulation of larger deposit reserves for those members during their working years, tend to preserve the purchasing power of those reserves and the retirement benefits provided thereby and afford better protection in periods of economic inflation.\"</blockquote>\n<p>Petitioners assert that the legislature's repeal of their right to direct contributions to the variable account program is an impairment of their contract. The majority rejects that claim, relying substantially on the reasoning used to reject petitioners' claim regarding members' regular accounts. In particular, the majority points to the absence of specific words in ORS 238.260 (2001) or any earlier version of the variable account statute in which the legislature expressly promised to <i>continue</i> the variable account program. The majority draws the conclusion from that fact that the legislature thus reserved the right to repeal the variable account program at any time.</p>\n<p>I disagree. <i>None</i> of the components of the PERS contract, including the promised retirement formulas and public employer obligations, appears with a legislative promise that the legislature will not repeal them. The majority's reasoning departs from this court's decisions that examine retirement obligations from the standpoint of benefits offered. None of this court's cases has suggested that the absence of a promise of nonrepeal exposes a retirement plan benefit to withdrawal or cancellation.</p>\n<p>The fact that the legislature's cancellation was only prospective does not save it from an impairment of contract challenge. When the affected employees accepted employment, the variable account plan represented one available means for increasing the size of their regular accounts. As the foregoing discussion of the regular account challenge demonstrates, our cases decline to allow employers, once employment commences, to nullify aspects of a retirement plan that employees may use to enhance their service retirement benefit. For the reasons expressed in that discussion, the majority's contrary conclusion is erroneous.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, I respectfully dissent from the majority's conclusions regarding the legislature's amendment of the statutes regarding employee contributions to regular accounts and variable accounts, and concur, for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1127</span> the reasons stated, with the balance of the majority's conclusions.</p>\n<p>RIGGS and KISTLER, JJ., concur with this opinion.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  After the enactment of those bills, the legislature made further amendments to both, HB 3020 (2003); Or Laws 2003, ch 625, and later amended HB 2003 even further, HB 2020 (2003); Or Laws 2003, ch 733. With the final form of the substantive enactments now incorporated into the 2003 edition of the Oregon Revised Statutes, there are a number of sources from which to cite. In an effort to promote clarity, and unless to do so would detract from that purpose, we shall refer to the statutory provisions at issue by their designations in the session laws, <i>e.g.,</i>\"Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, section 1,\" and refer to the legislation as a whole as the \"2003 PERS legislation.\"</p>\n<p>[2]  The assumed earnings rate is the rate of investment return that the Public Employees Retirement Fund is assumed to earn over 50 to 75 years. That earnings assumption facilitates the calculation of the funding necessary to maintain the system on an actuarially sound basis. The assumption has changed from time to time. From 1975 through 1978, the assumed earnings rate was seven percent. In 1979, the Public Employees Retirement Board (PERB) increased the assumed earnings rate to seven and one-half percent. In 1989, PERB increased the rate again, this time to its current level of eight percent.</p>\n<p>[3]  A Tier One member is a PERS member who joined PERS before January 1, 1996.</p>\n<p>[4]  Article I, section 21, of the Oregon Constitution provides, in part:\n</p>\n<p>\"No * * * law impairing the obligation of contracts shall ever be passed[.]\"</p>\n<p>[5]  This is not the first instance in which the legislature has conferred jurisdiction specifically on this court to determine the validity of legislative or constitutional changes to PERS. In those prior instances, the \"rule of necessity\" required the court to adjudicate the claims. <i>See </i><i>Oregon State Police Officers' Assn. v. State of Oregon,</i> 323 Or. 356, 361 n. 3, 918 P.2d 765 (1996); <i>Hughes v. State of Oregon,</i> 314 Or. 1, 5 n. 2, 838 P.2d 1018 (1992) (both discussing that doctrine). To the extent that the justices of this court either have, or arguably could be said to have, a financial stake in the outcome of this litigation, we likewise conclude that the rule of necessity requires that we decide the contractual and constitutional challenges that the legislature has directed us to adjudicate.</p>\n<p>[6]  The number of parties and claims has narrowed during the pendency of these proceedings. We perceive of no benefit to the public, the bench, or the bar in explaining the evolution of these cases in detail.</p>\n<p>[7]  42 USC section 1983 provides, in part:\n</p>\n<p>\"Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress[.]\"</p>\n<p>[8]  Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 625, section 13(6), amended Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, section 10, to make that section applicable as well to \"the alternate payees and beneficiaries of members described in subsection (5) of this section.\"</p>\n<p>[9]  We discuss the <i>City of Eugene</i> litigation, which presently is under advisement in this court, later in our opinion. At this point, it suffices to note that the plaintiffs and the defendants (but not the intervenors) in that litigation have entered into a settlement agreement that provides, among other things, that PERB will not use the methods that section 14b specifies to remedy the errors that the trial court identified.</p>\n<p>[10]  For ease of reference, we use the present tense, recognizing that the 2003 PERS legislation has changed the system significantly. We have included citations to various PERS statutes in place before 2003 later in this opinion, in the course of analyzing petitioners' claims.</p>\n<p>[11]  PERB employs the PERS actuary to perform various statutory functions. <i>See, e.g.,</i> ORS 238.360(3)(b) (2001) (PERB shall arrange for actuarial services for PERS); ORS 238.605 (2001) (actuary shall prepare reports for PERB).</p>\n<p>[12]  PERB holds the fund assets in trust, which, as noted, OIC invests. Before the 2003 PERS legislation, OIC had five members: three members whom the Governor appointed, one of whom was required to be a PERB member; the State Treasurer; and the PERS director (appointed by PERB), who was a nonvoting member. ORS 293.706 (2001). OIC now has six members: the State Treasurer; the PERS director (still a nonvoting member); and four members whom the Governor appoints, none of whom is required to be a PERB member. ORS 293.706.</p>\n<p>[13]  ORS 238.015(1) provides:\n</p>\n<p>\"No person may become a member of the system unless that person is in the service of a public employer and has completed six months' service uninterrupted by more than 30 consecutive working days during the six months' period. Every employee of a participating employer shall become a member of the system at the beginning of the first full pay period of the employee following the six months' period. Contributions for new members shall first be made for those wages that are attributable to services performed by the employee during the first full pay period following the six months' period, without regard to when those wages are considered earned for other purposes under this chapter. All public employers participating in the Public Employees Retirement System established by chapter 401, Oregon Laws 1945, as amended, at the time of repeal of that chapter, and all school districts of the state, shall participate in, and their employees shall be members of, the system, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.\"</p>\n<p>[14]  PERB allocates earnings on variable accounts by first paying a proportionate share of administrative expenses and then crediting the remainder to members' variable accounts. PERB never has funded a reserve from variable account earnings.\n</p>\n<p>Historically, employer funds were not invested in the Variable Annuity Account. To the extent that that account outperformed the regular account, employers were required to contribute additional amounts to match those earnings. In 2000, employers began participating in the Variable Annuity Account.</p>\n<p>[15]  As noted later in this opinion, all petitioners who remain part of these cases are Tier One members of PERS, either active or retired. The summary offered below therefore primarily focuses on aspects of PERS that relate to Tier One members.</p>\n<p>[16]  In years in which the earnings on the fund equal or exceed the guaranteed earnings rate, PERB statutorily is required to \"set aside * * * such part of the income as [PERB] may deem advisable, not exceeding seven and one-half percent of the combined total of such income, which moneys so segregated shall remain in the fund and constitute therein a reserve account.\" ORS 238.670(1). Before 1980, PERB funded a contingency reserve account, as set out in that statute, but it has not done so since 1979.\n</p>\n<p>In 1969, PERB began investing the fund in equity markets. Since then, the actual earnings of the fund, overall, substantially exceeded the assumed earnings rate. Historically, PERB credited members' regular accounts with earnings in excess of the assumed earnings rate when fund earnings exceeded that rate.</p>\n<p>[17]  Between 1977 and 2001, PERS employer contribution rates ranged from a high of 11.84 percent to a low of 9.15 percent of payroll. Between 1975 and 1997, the average normal cost for employers ranged between 7.09 and 9.33 percent of payroll, and the average rate at which employers paid amortized UAL during that same period ranged from zero to 3.24 percent of payroll. The three highest UAL rates occurred between 1975 and 1979.</p>\n<p>[18]  Until 1997, PERB assumed that most member service retirement allowances would be calculated under the Full Formula. By that time, however, the Money Match had emerged as the dominant formula. We agree with the Special Master's finding that the Money Match became the primary formula for calculating service retirement allowances because of (1) the structure of PERS; (2) the dramatically fluctuating investment markets of the late 1990s and early 2000s; and (3) certain of PERB's administrative practices concerning reserves, earning allocations, and the variable annuity account program.</p>\n<p>[19]  As the Special Master noted in his report, those percentages, which commonly are referred to as \"replacement ratios,\" understate the extent to which service retirement allowances under PERS replace a member's preretirement salary, because, among other reasons, any Social Security benefits that a retired member may become eligible to receive are not included in the member's retirement income.</p>\n<p>[20]  We provide citations to the session laws respecting the particular provisions at issue later in the opinion.</p>\n<p>[21]  Member contributions are established by statute at six percent of salary and either are withheld from the member's salary or paid, that is, \"picked up,\" by the employer. The pick-up historically has been negotiated separately between public employers and employees.</p>\n<p>[22]  As noted above, before the enactment of the 2003 PERS legislation, PERB set aside a portion of annual fund earnings to ensure that sufficient assets would be available to pay guaranteed benefits at the assumed earnings rate. In years when fund earnings exceeded the guaranteed amount, PERB deposited a portion of those funds into the gain-loss reserve. According to the evidence in the record, it is reasonable to fund the gain-loss reserve at a level that would fund projected Tier One guaranteed earnings credits for a 30-month period, which, using the current assumed earnings rate of eight percent, would set the reserve balance at 20 percent of the fund's value.</p>\n<p>[23]  We discuss the 1999 crediting in greater detail later in this opinion. At this point, we note that the 11.33 percent figure on which the legislature focused derives from a calculation that the PERS actuary performed, after the fact, to determine the earnings crediting that would have occurred in 1999 if PERB had funded the contingency and gain-loss reserves fully and also had not allowed employers to participate in the Variable Annuity Account for that year.</p>\n<p>[24]  As explained later in this opinion, the term \"actuarial equivalency factors\" refers to computational tools used to convert lump sum account balances to monthly payment streams and to change one optional benefit payment form to another. They primarily are based on assumptions concerning future earnings or investments and mortality rates.</p>\n<p>[25]  The court noted, however, that the plaintiff in <i>Eckles</i> neither had sought compensation nor had produced any evidence that he had been damaged by the state's breach of contract. <i>Eckles,</i> 306 Or. 380, 402, 760 P.2d 846 (1988).</p>\n<p>[26]  Petitioner Sartain entered into a stipulation with respondents to the effect that, with one exception, she would rely upon only statutory and administrative law sources as establishing the terms of her contract. The exception was for \"a document known as the `Notice of Entitlement' [that retired PERS members] receive upon retirement.\" Consistently with that stipulation, petitioner Sartain's opening brief focuses on statutory sources, but also includes the following footnote:\n</p>\n<p>\"The conduct of the PERS staff and PERB further confirms the contractual nature of the account balance and retirement allowance. At the time of petitioner Sartain's retirement, she was informed that her account balance was $289,633.41. * * * PERS sent her a Notice of Entitlement setting forth her balance and stating that her monthly retirement benefit would be $5,426.22.\"</p>\n<p>The footnote, however, contains no argument or authority that would support an implicit assertion that the conduct of PERB or its staff through issuance of the notice of entitlement somehow became part of the PERS contract. We therefore do not include petitioner Sartain's challenge in our discussion concerning the extent to which materials outside the PERS statutes (and applicable administrative rules) formed part of the PERS contract.</p>\n<p>[27]  Respondents offer additional argument to the contrary in their surreply brief. That advocacy, however, falls outside the appropriate scope of matters that properly may be addressed in surreply. Absent leave from this court, petitioners have the final word in reply as to issues in their case-in-chief. Accordingly, we have not considered respondents' surreply brief in that respect.</p>\n<p>[28]  As noted, with respect to the administrative rules concerning actuarial equivalency factors, all petitioners, except petitioner Sartain, argue that the legislature specifically delegated authority to PERB to adopt the rule at issue. We address that claim later in this opinion.</p>\n<p>[29]  <i>Taylor</i> involved a retirement plan for sworn law enforcement personnel of Multnomah County. <i>Taylor v. Mult. Dept. Sher. Ret. Bd.,</i> 265 Or. 445, 447, 510 P.2d 339 (1973).</p>\n<p>[30]  As noted earlier, all petitioners challenge the 2003 PERS legislation as it relates to Tier One members. Our summary of the parties' arguments and ensuing analysis likewise focuses, for the most part, on Tier One members.</p>\n<p>[31]  ORS 238.300 provides the various formulas for calculating service retirement allowances, and we discuss those formulas in greater detail below.</p>\n<p>[32]  As explained earlier, this court concluded in <i>OSPOA,</i> 323 Or. at 374-76, 918 P.2d 765, that, as at issue in the context of that particular case, certain statutory contribution provisions (including the optional employer \"pick-up\") constituted terms of the PERS contract.</p>\n<p>[33]  Concerning the genesis of the Money Match, the Special Master noted as follows:\n</p>\n<p>\"In the mid-1950s, PERS was a Money Purchase Plan with an employer matching feature. In 1968, the Money Purchase Plan was repealed, and it was replaced with the Pension Plus Annuity benefit formula. PERB later recognized that one or two members who retired in the interim had received lower benefits than they would have received under the previous system and that such a reduction was not permissible under a retirement plan that is qualified under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). PERB asked the legislature to enact corrective legislation so that benefits earned by such members would be protected and, in response, the legislature reinstated the matching feature.\"</p>\n<p>[34]  Relatedly, we decline respondents' invitation to construe certain of the statutory provisions at issue  particularly, ORS 238.200 (2001), which required members to contribute six percent of their salaries to the fund, and ORS 238.250 (2001), which required (and still requires) PERB to provide a regular account for each member  in isolation. Rather, as we address petitioners' contentions, we must view the wording of all the statutory provisions at issue in the context of their collective operation. <i>See </i><i>Hughes,</i> 314 Or. at 23, 838 P.2d 1018 (rejecting state's argument as impermissibly viewing tax exemption at issue \"in isolation\" and as \"standing alone\").\n</p>\n<p>In a similar vein, we note that this court's earlier conclusion in <i>OSPOA,</i> 323 Or. at 374-76, 918 P.2d 765, that the employer pick-up provisions are part of the PERS contract does not necessarily assist our analysis in this more complex case, which requires that we view all the statutes at issue as a whole.</p>\n<p>[35]  The 2003 Legislative Assembly amended ORS 238.300; however, those amendments do not affect the formula calculations that we discuss above. <i>See</i> Or. Laws 2003, ch. 67, § 4, <i>as amended by</i> Or. Laws 2003, ch. 625, § 22; Or. Laws 2003, ch. 733, § 46e.</p>\n<p>[36]  There is one exception to the Full Formula's design of providing a minimum level for a pension component, pertaining to an adjustment for members who participate in the variable annuity account program. That adjustment is not at issue in these cases.</p>\n<p>[37]  The 1953 act was entitled the \"Public Employe[e]s Retirement Act of 1953.\" Or. Laws 1953, ch. 200, § 1. The predecessor scheme, enacted in 1945 and similarly named the \"Public Employees Retirement Act,\" was similar, but not identical to, the 1953 act, eventually named PERS. <i>See</i> Or. Laws 1945, ch. 401 (enacting original act). For a general discussion of the relationship between the 1945 and 1953 acts, see <i>Hughes,</i> 314 Or. at 7 n. 7, 838 P.2d 1018.</p>\n<p>[38]  The 1953 act also provided an additional life pension for service before the employee became a member of the system. Or. Laws 1953, ch. 200, § 18.</p>\n<p>[39]  As respondents note, the 1981 Legislative Assembly also amended the graduated contribution rates for members based on salary, providing, instead, that the withholding for all members would be six percent unless the member made less than $1,000 per month, in which case less would be withheld. Or. Laws 1981, ch. 761, § 1; <i>former</i> ORS 237.071 (1981). As amended in 1981, that statute, now numbered as ORS 238.200, has remained substantially unchanged.</p>\n<p>[40]  In their reply brief, petitioners also argue that this court's decision in <i>Taylor,</i> 265 Or. 445, 510 P.2d 339, \"is a much more pivotal case in this court's developing analysis of pension benefits than is <i>OSPOA</i>.\" In <i>Taylor,</i> which involved a county retirement system, the court acknowledged that \"contractual rights can arise prior to the completion of the service necessary to a pension.\" 265 Or. at 451, 510 P.2d 339. Of course they can. The predicate question  which we determine to be dispositive in these cases  is whether the contract offer that the particular pension plan presents <i>contains</i> such a promise, <i>i.e.,</i> a promise that extends over the life of a covered member's service. And, in that respect, we find nothing inconsistent between <i>Taylor</i> and our analysis here.</p>\n<p>[41]  As noted, before January 1, 1996, PERS did not recognize classes of membership. <i>See</i> Or. Laws 1995, ch. 654, § 2 (providing limitation on benefits payable to persons establishing membership on or after January 1, 1996). In creating the \"tiers\" of membership in 1995, the legislature made what is now ORS 238.255 inapplicable to Tier Two PERS members. Or. Laws 1995, ch. 654, § 3.</p>\n<p>[42]  Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 625, section 10(5), now ORS 238.255(5), provides that the amendments to ORS 238.255 do not apply to a person who was a judge member of PERS on June 30, 2003.</p>\n<p>[43]  Petitioners do not rely on the amendments made to ORS 238.250 (2001) and ORS 238.610 (2001) during the 2003 legislative session (the legislature did not amend ORS 238.670 (2001)), and we agree that those amendments do not appear relevant to the arguments that petitioners make.</p>\n<p>[44]  In doing so, we choose not to revisit the court's holding in <i>OSPOA</i> that the legislature's promise to Tier One members of a guaranteed rate of return applies to work yet to be performed.</p>\n<p>[45]  As noted above, petitioners also cite ORS 238.250 (2001) (PERB shall provide members with regular accounts) and ORS 238.610 (2001) (employers responsible for covering difference when administrative expenses exceed annual fund earnings) as support for their argument. We, however, see nothing in those statutes that advances petitioners' assertion.</p>\n<p>[46]  For example, for that reason, PERB credited Tier One members' regular accounts with no earnings for 2003.</p>\n<p>[47]  As noted above, under Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 3, section 1, <i>as amended by</i> Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, section 5, <i>codified as</i> ORS 238.255(3), Tier One regular accounts will not be credited with earnings in excess of the assumed earnings rate until the gain-loss reserve no longer has a deficit and is fully funded as determined by PERB for three consecutive years. The validity of that legislation is not before us on review.</p>\n<p>[48]  As discussed at length further in this opinion, a particular crediting decision that PERB made in 1999 was challenged as part of the <i>City of Eugene</i> litigation.</p>\n<p>[49]  The legislature initially provided that members could contribute either 25 or 50 percent of their PERS contributions to the variable annuity account program. Or. Laws 1967, ch. 622, § 24(3). In 1973, the legislature increased the amount that members could direct to their variable accounts by adding the 75 percent option. Or. Laws 1973, ch. 695, § 5. Other than that change, and one other in 1981 that we discuss below, the substantive provisions of the statute have remained the same over time.</p>\n<p>[50]  Even after the 2003 PERS legislation, there is no need to rely on legislative history for that proposition. ORS 238.260(1) (2001) itself provided as follows:\n</p>\n<p>\"It is anticipated that investment of those contributions and portions of the member accounts in equities will result in the accumulation of larger deposit reserves for those members during their working years, tend to preserve the purchasing power of those reserves and the retirement benefits provided thereby and afford better protection in periods of economic inflation.\"</p>\n<p><i>See also</i> Or. Laws 1967, ch. 622, § 24(1) (enacting that wording).</p>\n<p>[51]  We do not deem the legislature's use of the words \"shall\" and \"on and after\" in ORS 238.260(3) (2001) to be indicative of a promise of a right to future contributions to the variable annuity account program. The import of the word \"shall\" is limited by its context-specifically, its reference to use of a PERB-approved form and to a particular effective date. Similarly, the words \"on and after\" merely clarify when the variable election takes effect.</p>\n<p>[52]  As noted, there is a dispute in the <i>City of Eugene</i> litigation as to that particular aspect of the variable annuity account program. The resolution of that dispute, however, does not impact our analysis in these cases.</p>\n<p>[53]  The Special Master made those findings based on evidence presented to, and findings made by, the trial court in the <i>City of Eugene</i> litigation, described in the text below.</p>\n<p>[54]  As noted, Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 537, section 1, granted this court \"exclusive jurisdiction to decide\" the <i>City of Eugene</i> litigation. We do not address here the merits of the trial court's judgment in that litigation. The issues that that case presents more appropriately will be addressed in our opinion in that case.</p>\n<p>[55]  We note that the particular sentence in Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, section 10(3), that precludes application of annual COLAs to \"fixed\" service retirement allowances was not amended by Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 625, section 13.</p>\n<p>[56]  The current versions of ORS 238.715(1) and (8) are identical to the 2001 versions of those provisions.</p>\n<p>[57]  As noted, in light of the pending <i>City of Eugene</i> litigation, PERB's 1999 crediting decision remained subject to reversal at the time that the legislature enacted the 2003 PERS legislation.</p>\n<p>[58]  Put another way, the legislature took what it deemed to be restorative action, but used as the mechanism for doing so an adjustment that implicated the COLA provision of the PERS contract. Our conclusion that that particular legislative action amounted to a breach of the PERS contract, however, implies nothing about PERB's  or, for that matter, the legislature's  authority to recover amounts determined to have been paid from the fund in error.</p>\n<p>[59]  Because the foregoing disposition returns petitioners to the <i>status quo ante,</i> that disposition obviates any need to consider petitioners' arguments that the temporary suspension of COLAs constitutes a taking of property under Article I, section 18, of the Oregon Constitution or their additional contractual and constitutional challenges to the \"revised\" service retirement allowance calculations set out in Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, section 10(2), <i>as amended by</i> Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 625, section 13.</p>\n<p>[60]  Since the inception of what is now PERS in 1945, the legislature has required the PERS actuary to \"prepare a report evaluating the current and prospective assets and liabilities of the system and indicating its current and prospective financial condition.\" ORS 238.605; <i>see</i> Or. Laws 1945, ch. 401, § 13 (stating same). The legislature further has required that, \"[i]n preparing the report[,] the actuary shall investigate the mortality, disability, service and other experience of the members of, and employers participating in the system, shall state fully the condition of the system, and shall make such recommendations as the actuary deems advisable to facilitate administering it properly.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>[61]  The United States Supreme Court also has held that that practice violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. <i>See </i><i>Arizona Governing Committee v. Norris,</i> 463 U.S. 1073, 1084, 103 S.Ct. 3492, 77 L.Ed.2d 1236 (1983) (\"The use of sex-segregated actuarial tables to calculate retirement benefits violates Title VII whether or not the tables reflect an accurate prediction of the longevity of women as a class[.]\")</p>\n<p>[62]  Following enactment of the 2003 PERS legislation, PERB again amended the rule to conform with the legislation. <i>See</i> OAR XXX-XXX-XXXX(3) (2004) (requiring use of updated AEFs for members retiring after July 1, 2003).</p>\n<p>[63]  As explained earlier, the BIF (or \"Benefits-In-Force\" reserve account) acts as a transitional account to which PERB transfers a newly retired member's account balances, together with the employer contributions necessary to pay that member's service retirement allowance.</p>\n<p>[64]  That subsection provided that \"[a]ll changes to the System's actuarial equivalency factors shall be prospective only for that portion of an allowance attributable to service as an active member beginning on or after the effective date of the change.\"</p>\n<p>[65]  The text of that statutory provision was the same in 1996, when PERB renumbered and amended <i>former</i> OAR 459-05-055 (1993), <i>renumbered as</i> OAR XXX-XXX-XXXX (1996), and also was the same in 2001. The 2003 Legislative Assembly renumbered the provision as ORS 238.630(3)(f) and amended it; that amendment is not at issue here.</p>\n<p>[66]  ORS 238.305 (1993) allowed (and still allows in amended form) retired members to select from a variety of \"optional\" service retirement allowance calculations, in addition to those set out in ORS 238.300.</p>\n<p>[67]  ORS 238A.005(2) now provides:\n</p>\n<p>\"`Actuarial equivalent' means a payment or series of payments having the same value as the payment or series of payments replaced, computed on the basis of interest rate and mortality assumptions adopted by [PERB].\"</p>\n<p>[68]  Those members \"established membership in PERS before January 1, 1999[.]\" OAR XXX-XXX-XXXX(5) (1996).</p>\n<p>[69]  Article I, section 20, of the Oregon Constitution provides that \"[n]o law shall be passed granting to any citizen or class of citizens privileges, or immunities, which, upon the same terms, shall not equally belong to all citizens.\"</p>\n<p>[1]  <i>Former</i> ORS 237.251(3) (1991), which was in effect when PERB adopted the rules in question, provided, in part:\n</p>\n<p>\"The board:</p>\n<p>\"(g) Shall determine the actuarial equivalency of optional forms of retirement allowances and establish from time to time for that purpose the necessary actuarial factors, which shall constitute a part of the system[.]\"</p>\n<p>That statute, renumbered as ORS 238.630(3)(g) in 1995, remained in effect without substantive modification until the legislature amended it by enacting Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 68, sections 2 and 4.</p>\n<p>[2]  The legislature acknowledged the inherent variability of the factors that influence the statistical determination of actuarial equivalency when it adopted the following statement as one of its premises for the enactment of House Bill 2004, which the legislature later codified as Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 68:\n</p>\n<p>\"Whereas actuarial equivalency factors are based on assumptions and conditions that vary over time as the demographics of a system's constituent population and the expected performance of investments of the Public Employees Retirement Fund change, so that the most reasonable expectation is that such factors, by their very nature, must vary over time to reflect those demographic and performance shifts * * *.\"</p>\n<p>[3]  This paragraph states the Full Formula.</p>\n<p>[4]  This paragraph states the Money Match formula.</p>\n<p>[5]  This paragraph states the Pension Plus Annuity formula.</p>\n<p>[6]  As the majority indicates, PERS, at its inception in 1945, provided for the creation of personal accounts into which the public employee would pay an amount actuarially determined to be sufficient, with earnings on the account balance, to provide one-half of the proposed retirement allowance (typically, at the time, 50% of final average salary). OCLA § 90-714. Upon retirement, the employee would receive an annuity based on the value of the personal account, and the public employer also would provide a similar annuity, for the other one-half of the proposed retirement allowance, by \"matching\" the amount in the employee's individual account. OCLA § 90-719. The level of the projected retirement benefit has increased over time, and the legislature has augmented the PERS system from time to time with various reserve features to provide stability during periods of loss. However, except for one two-year period over 35 years ago, the PERS system has retained the Money Match formula as one available method of retirement benefit calculation through the present time.</p>\n<p>[7]  ORS 238.200(1)(b) requires smaller salary contributions from employees who were active members on August 21, 1981.</p>\n<p>[8]  The court in <i>Taylor</i> selected the term \"unilateral contract\" on the assumption that the employees could accept the employer's offer by the tender of partial performance. The <i>Taylor</i> court's subsequent discussion of the binding effect of the tender of partial performance confirms that, in the employment context, partial performance terminates the employer's power to revoke the offer. Thus, one characteristic of a truly unilateral contract  the offeror's power to revoke the offer before the offeree tenders full performance  is not applicable in this setting.\n</p>\n<p>Moreover, the term \"unilateral contract\" may no longer provide a fully accurate conception of the factors that make the employment relationship binding. <i>Restatement (Second) of Contracts</i> § 32 (1981), which the American Law Institute adopted eight years after the <i>Taylor</i> decision, provides:</p>\n<p>\"In case of doubt an offer is interpreted as inviting the offeree to accept either by promising to perform what the offer requests or by rendering the performance, as the offeree chooses.\"</p>\n<p>Under that provision, unless the employer insists on performance as the sole mode of acceptance, the employee may bind the employer to its offer either by partially performing or promising to perform. In either case, a valid acceptance terminates the employer's power to revoke the offer.</p>\n\n</div>",

The amendments at issue derive primarily from two separate, but related, enactments. The first, House Bill (HB) 2003 (2003), Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, is known as the PERS Reform and Stabilization Act of 2003 and alters PERS in a variety of respects. The second, HB 2004 (2003), Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 68, affects the actuarial equivalency factors used to compute retired PERS members' service retirement allowances.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>We have considered both the factual and legal aspects of the challenges that the petitions present. Having done so, and for the reasons set out below, we conclude that the provisions of Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, <i>as amended by</i> Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 625, that eliminate the annual assumed earnings rate credit<sup>[2]</sup> to PERS Tier One members'<sup>[3]</sup> regular accounts impair a contractual obligation of the PERS contract in violation of Article I, section 21, of the Oregon Constitution.<sup>[4]</sup> We further conclude that the provision of Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, section 10(3), that, in effect, temporarily suspends annual cost-of-living adjustments to the service retirement allowances of certain retired Tier One members breaches an obligation of the PERS contract. In all other respects, we conclude that petitioners' challenges to the 2003 PERS legislation are not well taken.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATIONS</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Jurisdiction</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 625, section 17(1), provides:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Jurisdiction is conferred on the Supreme Court to determine in the manner provided by this section whether the implementation of actuarial equivalency factor tables under section 2 or 4, chapter 68, Oregon Laws 2003 (Enrolled House Bill 2004), breaches any contract between members of the Public Employees Retirement System and their employers, or violates any constitutional provision, including but not limited to impairment of contract rights of members of the Public Employees Retirement System under section 21, Article I, of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1065</span> Oregon Constitution, or clause 1, section 10, Article I, of the United States Constitution.\"<sup>[5]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 625, section 17a, contains essentially identical operative wording, except that the grant of jurisdiction pertains to determinations \"whether the provisions of chapter 67, Oregon Laws 2003 (Enrolled House Bill 2003)\" breach any PERS contract or violate any constitutional provision.</p>\n<p>The 2003 PERS legislation contains other jurisdictional and quasi-jurisdictional provisions as well. We have considered every statutory jurisdictional prerequisite and, with the three exceptions explained below, have determined that each of the petitioners in each of these consolidated cases is properly before this court and that each petition presents a justiciable controversy.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>The first of the three claims that fall short of the jurisdictional or justiciability requirements is petitioner Dahlin's claim for relief under 42 USC section 1983.<sup>[7]</sup> With respect to that claim for relief, petitioner Dahlin states that he \"is advancing no new impairment arguments under Section 1983, but rather, [is] utilizing that section as a procedural vehicle to raise his United States Constitutional claims * * * [and] as one method by which he may recover his costs and attorney fees in this action.\" Respondents assert, correctly we conclude, that petitioner Dahlin's section 1983 claim falls outside the legislature's limited grant of original jurisdiction to this court, quoted above. Contrary to petitioner Dahlin's implicit assertion that the legislation allows multiple avenues for presenting challenges, the only \"procedural vehicle[s]\" that the legislature has authorized for review of the 2003 PERS legislation in this court as original matters are the petitions to which that legislation refers. Those petitions do not include the federal statutory claim that section 1983 provides. We therefore dismiss petitioner Dahlin's section 1983 claim.</p>\n<p>The second problematic claim is petitioner Dahlin's challenge to an aspect of the 2003 PERS legislation that, effectively, temporarily suspends annual cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) as to certain retired Tier One members. <i>See</i> Or. Laws 2003, ch. 67, § 10(3), <i>as amended by</i> Or. Laws 2003, ch. 625, § 13 (so providing). Section 10 applies to only members who:</p>\n<blockquote>\"(a) Established membership in [PERS] before January 1, 1996, * * *;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(b) Receive a service retirement allowance calculated under ORS 238.300(2)(b)(A); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(c) Have an effective date of retirement that is on or after April 1, 2000, and before April 1, 2004.\"</blockquote>\n<p>Or. Laws 2003, ch. 67, § 10(5).<sup>[8]</sup> Petitioner Dahlin, however, is not a retired PERS member, and, as an active Tier One member, the provisions that he seeks to challenge respecting <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1066</span> the COLA suspension do not apply to him. On that basis, respondents jointly assert that he lacks standing to pursue that particular challenge. We agree. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Brumnett v. PSRB,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1375942\"><a href=\"/opinion/1375942/brumnett-v-psrb/\"><span class=\"volume\">315</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Or.</span> <span class=\"page\">402</span></a></span>, 405, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1375942\"><a href=\"/opinion/1375942/brumnett-v-psrb/\"><span class=\"volume\">848</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1194</span></a></span> (1993) (for party to have standing, court's decision must have some practical effect on party's rights).</p>\n<p>Petitioner Dahlin's attempts to avoid the foregoing conclusion are not well taken. First, he argues that he has brought his claims as a class action and that \"members of the class have standing to raise this claim.\" Regardless of the legal validity of that assertion, nothing in the pleadings or the record supports the proposition that petitioner Dahlin sought to maintain a class action. Second, petitioner Dahlin argues that respondents have waived any objection to his standing. Standing, however, is an aspect of justiciability, <i>McIntire v. Forbes,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1250784\"><a href=\"/opinion/1250784/mcintire-v-forbes/\"><span class=\"volume\">322</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Or.</span> <span class=\"page\">426</span></a></span>, 433, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1250784\"><a href=\"/opinion/1250784/mcintire-v-forbes/\"><span class=\"volume\">909</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">846</span></a></span> (1996), and justiciability is not waivable, <i>Barcik v. Kubiaczyk,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1265920\"><a href=\"/opinion/1265920/barcik-v-kubiaczyk/\"><span class=\"volume\">321</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Or.</span> <span class=\"page\">174</span></a></span>, 186-87, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1265920\"><a href=\"/opinion/1265920/barcik-v-kubiaczyk/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">765</span></a></span> (1995). Accordingly, we dismiss petitioner Dahlin's petition to the extent that it seeks to challenge the temporary COLA suspension.</p>\n<p>The third problematic matter concerns claims that <i>Strunk</i> petitioners have advanced  and in which <i>Burt, Dahlin,</i> and <i>Evans</i> petitioners have joined  challenging Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, sections 14b(1)(b) and (2), <i>as amended by</i> Oregon Laws 2004, chapter 625, section 31, which provide as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"(1) If the Public Employees Retirement Board [(PERB)] is required to correct one or more of the erroneous benefit calculation methods identified in <i>City of Eugene et al. v.

Those considerations notwithstanding, for these proceedings, the legislature has directed this court to determine all issues as original matters in this court. To comply with that directive, this court appointed a special master to conduct the trial of all factual issues and to assemble the record. We now conduct a <i>de novo</i> review of the evidentiary record and a plenary review of the legal issues presented.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>The Evidentiary Record</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The court appointed now-Chief Judge David Brewer of the Oregon Court of Appeals to act as Special Master on the court's behalf in these proceedings and to hold an evidentiary hearing, rule on prehearing matters, and make recommended findings of fact. The Special Master completed that assignment in commendable fashion, and his efforts warrant this court's grateful acknowledgment. He guided these cases through a two-week evidentiary hearing, oversaw the creation of a voluminous record, and prepared a comprehensive written report, including extensive recommended findings of fact. That report has gone virtually unchallenged before this court, and, unless specifically noted, we have adopted those recommended findings of fact.</p>\n<p>Although the parties challenge only a few of the Special Master's specific recommended findings of fact, they have drawn freely from the evidentiary record to advance factual assertions that were not contained in the Special Master's report.

Petitioners in two of the proceedings, <i>Strunk</i> and <i>Dahlin,</i> twice moved the Special Master to compel the production of documents that they unsuccessfully had sought to obtain in discovery from respondent Public Employees Retirement Board (PERB). PERB had withheld production of those documents on the ground that the documents, which related to advice that the Attorney General had given to PERB concerning the actuarial equivalency factors used to compute retired members' benefits, constituted privileged lawyer-client communications. The Special Master refused to compel production of the documents.</p>\n<p>Petitioner Dahlin and <i>Strunk</i> petitioners have assigned the rulings of the Special Master as error. We uphold the Special Master's refusal to compel the production of the documents, because, in our view, the documents are not relevant to any claim at issue in these proceedings.</p>\n<p>Having resolved the preliminary considerations that these matters present, we proceed to an overview of PERS generally and of the parties and their claims and defenses.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>A brief summary of the history and operation of PERS, as well as the changes that the 2003 PERS legislation made to the system, provide context for the parties' arguments. As the Special Master noted in his report, \"[t]he statutory, administrative, historical, and operational backgrounds against which both the 2003 legislation and the instant claims have arisen are exceedingly complex.\" The summary that follows borrows heavily from the Special Master's written report. More fully developed discussions about particular aspects of the system are set out later as we address the parties' specific arguments.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1068</span> A. <i>PERS Before the 2003 Legislation</i><sup>[10]</sup></h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>General Considerations</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In one form or another, Oregon has provided its public employees with a retirement plan, as a contractual benefit of public employment, since 1945. Funding for the system comes from three sources: (1) employee member contributions, presently set at six percent of salary; (2) employer contributions, in an amount actuarially determined to be necessary when added to the employee member contributions to cover the cost of accrued and projected future service retirement allowances payable to retired members; and (3) investment earnings on those contributions. The assets, taken together, constitute the Public Employees Retirement Fund (the fund) and are used to pay the costs of the system: member service retirement allowances and administrative expenses. Except for variable account funds, which we discuss below, all PERS funds are commingled for investment purposes.</p>\n<p>PERB administers PERS and acts as trustee for the fund. PERB conducts its operations through a director and staff that PERB employs, and PERB administers the system in consultation with the PERS actuary.<sup>[11]</sup> PERB sets employer contribution rates, adopts actuarial equivalency factors and assumed earnings rates, establishes reserve accounts, and allocates annual earnings to accounts and reserves. The Oregon Investment Council (OIC) invests the assets of the fund.<sup>[12]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Membership in and Funding of PERS</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Public employees of participating employers become PERS members upon completing six months of uninterrupted service.<sup>[13]</sup> Every PERS member has a regular \"account\" in PERS. The member's regular account consists of the member's contributions to the system and earnings that PERB has credited to those contributions. In addition, in 1967, the legislature enacted an optional variable annuity account program for members who are willing to have their contributions and benefits fluctuate with the equity markets. A member who participates in the variable annuity account program has two member accounts: a regular account and a variable account. Members' contributions to their variable accounts are paid into the Variable Annuity Account and are invested solely in the Oregon Equity Fund.<sup>[14]</sup></p>\n<p>For purposes of this litigation, there are two categories of PERS members. \"Tier <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1069</span> One\" members are public employees who joined PERS before January 1, 1996. Tier One members are entitled to a guaranteed minimum rate of return on their regular accounts based on the assumed earnings rate. To ensure that sufficient assets exist to pay guaranteed benefits to Tier One members at the assumed earnings rate, PERS maintains a \"gain-loss reserve.\" In years when fund earnings exceed the assumed earnings rate, PERB deposits a portion of those excess earnings into the gain-loss reserve. In years when fund earnings are less than the assumed earnings rate, PERB uses funds from the reserve to make up the difference.</p>\n<p>PERS members who joined the system on or after January 1, 1996, are known as \"Tier Two\" members. Unlike Tier One members, Tier Two members have no earnings guarantee on their regular accounts and, correspondingly, do not benefit from the fund's gain-loss reserve.<sup>[15]</sup></p>\n<p>Crediting of member accounts occurs annually as of December 31 of each calender year. At the beginning of each calendar year, PERB reviews changes in the value of the fund since the beginning of the previous year. PERB staff determines the fund's value using standard accounting methods. Based on the fund's annual growth, PERB allocates earnings to various accounts within the fund on an \"equal crediting\" basis; that is, every dollar within the fund receives the same percentage share of earnings regardless of the account to which that dollar is designated.<sup>[16]</sup></p>\n<p>The PERS actuary also recommends the adoption of employer contribution rates in an \"Actuarial Valuation\" that usually issues as of December 31 in odd-numbered years. Employers begin paying newly established contribution rates on July 1 of the following year. Employer contribution rates consist of two components: the employer's normal cost toward payment of members' service retirement allowances and the amount necessary to amortize any unfunded actuarial liability (UAL). The normal cost component of the employer contribution rate is based on the PERS actuary's best estimate of the amount needed to pay service retirement allowances to current members in the future. The adjustment of the employer contribution rate either for UAL or actuarial surplus is based on the difference between an employer's account balance and the projected future service retirement allowances payable to its employee members. If an actuarial surplus exists, then the employer pays less than the normal cost rate. If the employer has a UAL, then PERB adds an additional, amortized charge to the employer's normal cost rate.<sup>[17]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. <i>Service Retirement Allowance Formulas</i>\n</h2>\n<p>There are three formulas available for calculating a PERS member's service retirement <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1070</span> allowance, commonly known as the Pension Plus Annuity, the Full Formula, and the Money Match. The Pension Plus Annuity, which is available to only members who contributed to PERS before August 21, 1981, consists of the sum of an annuity component and a pension component. The annuity component is composed of the actuarial equivalent of the member's account balances at retirement. The pension component, funded by the employer, is equal to one percent of the member's final average salary (1.35 percent for legislators and police and fire employees) for each service year.</p>\n<p>The Full Formula also includes an annuity component composed of the actuarial equivalent of the member's account balances at retirement and a pension component; however, the pension component is calculated differently than under the Pension Plus Annuity. The Full Formula first calculates a member's service retirement allowance by multiplying the member's final average salary by a factor set at 1.67 percent (two percent for legislators, police officers, and firefighters) and then multiplying the resulting figure by the member's years of membership. That service retirement allowance then is funded using the actuarial equivalent of the member's account balances at retirement (the annuity component) and employer contributions required to make up the difference (the pension component).</p>\n<p>Under the Money Match, a member's service retirement allowance is calculated by determining the sum of the actuarial equivalent of the member's account balances at retirement (the annuity component) and then adding a sum in an equal amount that is charged to the employer, <i>i.e.,</i> the \"match\" (the pension component). The resulting service retirement allowance therefore amounts to twice the actuarial equivalent of the member's account balances at retirement.</p>\n<p>At retirement, a PERS member receives a service retirement allowance based on the formula that produces the highest pension amount among the foregoing three alternative formulas.<sup>[18]</sup> By the late 1980s, members who retired with 30 years of creditable service received service retirement allowances equal to approximately 63 percent of their final average salaries. By the early 1990s, that figure had increased to 66 percent and, between 1996 and 2002, had increased to 85 percent. In 2000, the average PERS retired member with 30 years of creditable service retired at the age of 53 with a service retirement allowance equal to 106 percent of the member's final average salary.<sup>[19]</sup></p>\n<p>Regardless of the formula used to determine a retired member's service retirement allowance, PERS historically has increased such allowances through annual cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs). COLAs are based on the Consumer Price Index and are capped at two percent of each member's allowance. If the index increases by more than two percent for the year, then the increase above two percent is \"banked\" and may be added to the member's COLA in later years when the index increases by less than two percent.</p>\n<p>Finally, in addition to the benefits described above, members who retired before 1991 receive an increase in benefits to remedy unlawful taxation on retirement income benefits attributable to service before 1991. <i>See generally </i><i>Hughes v. State of Oregon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1155678\"><a href=\"/opinion/1155678/hughes-v-state-of-oregon/\"><span class=\"volume\">314</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Or.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1155678\"><a href=\"/opinion/1155678/hughes-v-state-of-oregon/\"><span class=\"volume\">838</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1018</span></a></span> (1992) (legislature's repeal of income tax exemption statute as to PERS members' retirement benefits constituted <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1071</span> breach of PERS contract, requiring legislatively created remedy).</p>\n<p>When a PERS member retires, PERB transfers the member's account balances to the Benefits-In-Force reserve account (BIF), together with an amount from the employer's accumulated contributions. The amount transferred from the employer's account is that which PERB has determined is necessary to pay the member's service retirement allowance. PERB also regularly \"trues up\" the BIF by recalculating the funds necessary to pay all expected service retirement allowances for retired members. If PERB's actuary determines that the BIF is insufficient to pay those allowances, then PERB deducts from all employer accounts the amounts necessary to eliminate the deficiency. Conversely, if the BIF is overfunded, then PERB adds the overage to all employer accounts. For accounting purposes, PERB does not make adjustments to individual employer accounts; instead, PERB maintains a balancing account that shows the actuary's \"trueing up\" calculations.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4. <i>Recent Fiscal Status of the Fund</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The fiscal status of the fund following poor investment performances in 2000, 2001, and 2002  together with significant growth in fund liabilities and employer contribution rates  was the primary motivator of the 2003 PERS legislation. <i>See generally</i> Or Laws 2003, ch 67 (preamble). Those considerations provided much of the focus of the parties' advocacy before the Special Master and this court. As context for the issues that we resolve in these cases, we set out the following brief discussion of the fund's financial status, which we take from the Special Master's report:</p>\n<blockquote>\"For the 2001-03 biennium, the [S]tate of Oregon's general fund and lottery budget was approximately $11 billion. Oregon's local governments will collect approximately $17.8 billion in own-source revenues in fiscal year 2003-04. In comparison, at the end of 2002, the fund had a total UAL of more than $15 billion [based on the fair market value of fund assets]. In January 2003, the UAL reached $16.41 billion. During the 2003 legislative session, the UAL exceeded $17 billion, but it had declined to $12.7 billion by July 2003.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"Between 1991 and 2000, the nation experienced the longest sustained period of economic growth in its history. During that time, the average investment return on the fund was approximately 15 percent per year. However, over that same period, the system's funded ratio, which compares the value of fund assets to projected liabilities, declined. In 1991, the fund's value equaled the amount of its projected future liabilities. By 2001, the value of the fund's assets equaled 89 percent of its projected future liabilities. In 2002, based on then-current actuarial assumptions, the PERS actuary projected that PERS liabilities would increase from approximately $45 billion in 2001 to approximately $65 billion by 2007. In 2002, the actuary also projected that the funded ratio would remain below 80 percent until 2010 and that the funded ratio probably would not equal 100 percent until 2027. In early 2003, that ratio declined to 65.4 percent.\"</blockquote>\n<p>(Footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>The 2003 PERS Legislation</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The following summary addresses only those changes to the system following the 2003 PERS legislation that petitioners have challenged in this litigation.<sup>[20]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>Member Accounts</i>\n</h2>\n<p>As noted, before the 2003 PERS legislation, all active PERS members contributed, either directly or by employer pick-up,<sup>[21]</sup> six percent of their salaries to their regular accounts. Earnings on those contributions also were credited to those accounts. Under the 2003 PERS legislation, all member contributions <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1072</span> made after January 1, 2004, are placed into an \"account\" for each member under a new Individual Account Program (IAP) instead of being credited to PERS regular accounts. The balances held in members' IAP accounts will not be annually credited at not less than the assumed earnings rate and, at retirement, will not be subject to employer matching under the Money Match or be enhanced by annual COLAs.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Investment in the Variable Annuity Account Program</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Under the 2003 PERS legislation, as of December 31, 2003, members no longer may contribute to the variable annuity account program. The legislation does not affect contributions credited to members' variable accounts before that date.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. <i>The \"Call\"</i>\n</h2>\n<p>As explained earlier, the legislature has required PERB to create a reserve account, known as the \"gain-loss\" reserve, to offset any deficit created in years in which fund earnings fell below the assumed earnings rate. By statute, PERB could not maintain that reserve account in a deficit position for more than five years. PERB's process for eliminating such a deficit has been referred to as the \"call.\" There never has been a five-year deficit in the reserve account, and, accordingly, PERB never has implemented the call. The 2003 PERS legislation eliminates the statutory provisions respecting the call.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4. <i>The Assumed Earnings Rate and Crediting of Accounts</i>\n</h2>\n<p>As noted, before the 2003 PERS legislation, the PERS statutes guaranteed all Tier One members that PERB would credit earnings on their regular accounts annually at not less than the assumed earnings rate. The 2003 PERS legislation, however, prohibits the allocation of earnings to Tier One members' regular accounts in any year in which a deficit exists in the gain-loss reserve or the allocation of earnings would cause a deficit in the gain-loss reserve.<sup>[22]</sup> The amendment does not apply to members who retired before April 1, 2004. For Tier One members who retire on or after that date, the amount in their regular accounts at retirement cannot be less than the amount that those accounts would have reflected if PERB had credited those accounts with earnings at the assumed earnings rate for every year that the accounts existed. If a member's regular account balance is deficient in that respect, then PERS is required to pay the difference out of the gain-loss reserve.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>5. <i>Cost-of-Living Adjustments</i>\n</h2>\n<p>As noted, retired PERS members are entitled to annual COLAs on their service retirement allowances not to exceed two percent per year. Under the 2003 PERS legislation, PERS must calculate two alternative service retirement allowances for certain members who retired on or after April 1, 2000, and before April 1, 2004  a \"revised\" service retirement allowance and a \"fixed\" service retirement allowance. The \"revised\" service retirement allowance calculates the amount that the member would have received if PERB had credited all members' regular accounts with 11.33 percent interest in 1999  instead of the 20 percent interest that PERB actually credited to members' regular accounts for that year.<sup>[23]</sup> The \"fixed\" service retirement allowance essentially \"fixes\" each <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1073</span> member's allowance as of July 1, 2003, or the effective date of the member's retirement (whichever is later), but then is not subject to an annual COLA. The legislation further provides that each member in the identified group shall receive the \"greater\" of the \"revised\" and \"fixed\" service retirement allowances.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>6. <i>Actuarial Equivalency Factors</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Under an administrative rule that PERB adopted in 1993, and later amended in 1996, PERB declared that it would not reduce, by application of new actuarial equivalency factors (AEFs),<sup>[24]</sup> the service retirement allowances of PERS members who joined the system before 1999. That declaration notwithstanding, the 2003 PERS legislation directs the implementation of updated AEFs beginning July 1, 2003, and thereby modifies the AEF calculation for certain members who entered the system before 1999. Members who retired on or before June 30, 2003  one day before the effective date of the new legislation  receive service retirement allowances calculated using the AEFs in place before the legislative reforms. All other members who joined the system before 1999 and who retired or will retire on or after July 1, 2003, will receive service retirement allowances that are subject to the new legislation. Those allowances are determined using one of two calculations, whichever produces the greater benefit. The first requires that the AEFs in effect at a member's effective retirement date be applied to the member's account balance. The second creates an account balance as of June 30, 2003, that consists only of the member's contributions and earnings credited as of that date. Based on that account balance, PERB determines the member's service retirement allowance using the AEFs in effect on June 30, 2003.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>The Parties and Their Claims</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The following is an overview of the parties and their primary contentions, taken from the Special Master's report:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Petitioners are current and former public employees who are [Tier One] members of PERS. * * * Petitioners have named as [respondents] the State of Oregon and certain state agencies (the state), [PERB], and various other public employers (the nonstate [respondents]). Petitioners each assert [under state law] that the 2003 legislation impairs a statutory contract between petitioners and their public employers * * *, breaches the statutory PERS contract, and takes their property without just compensation * * *. Some of the petitioners also assert contract impairment and takings claims under the United States Constitution. Petitioners seek to have many of the provisions of the 2003 legislation declared unconstitutional and to enjoin their implementation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"Petitioners in the <i>Strunk, Burt,</i> and <i>Evans</i> cases rely, for the sources of their claims, on the PERS statutes that existed before the enactment of the 2003 legislation and certain PERB administrative rules in effect before the legislation's enactment. Petitioners in the <i>Dahlin,</i> * * * <i>Sartain,</i> and <i>Whitty</i> cases also rely on those provisions and, in addition, assert that the PERS contract consists of other terms, including provisions of employee handbooks, oral representations, or documents that PERS officials have provided to them over the years. Those petitioners' claims allege breaches and impairments of contract and takings based on those additional purported terms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"The state has raised several defenses to petitioners' claims. It asserts that (1) the statutory provisions and other materials on which petitioners rely are not part of the obligation of any contract to which they are parties; (2) any impairment of the obligation of petitioners' PERS contracts is insubstantial or nonexistent; (3) any impairment is justified by important public purposes; and (4) petitioners have no property interest that the 2003 legislation affects. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1074</span> \"Nonstate [respondents] present a somewhat different array of defenses. Like the state, they first assert that many of the provisions that petitioners seek to enforce are not <i>statutory</i> contractual promises. They also contend that the 2003 legislation did not breach or impair those provisions that constitute statutory contractual promises because it did not change substantially the substance of those promises and, in any event, none of the affected provisions was beyond the reach of the legislature's power of amendment or repeal. They assert that the 2003 legislation has `only prospective effects.'</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"In addition, nonstate [respondents] assert that PERB lacked authority to create binding contractual obligations between themselves and petitioners with respect to PERS benefits. Further, [they] argue that, even if PERB had such authority, the rules and actions on which petitioners rely were unauthorized or contrary to statute, and petitioners have no right to retain the benefits resulting from them. According to nonstate [respondents], the legislature has the exclusive authority to determine PERS benefit levels.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"Nonstate [respondents] also have raised several affirmative defenses to petitioners' breach of contract claims. Assuming that the legislature intended the statutes, rules, and other materials on which petitioners rely to constitute part of the PERS contract, [they] assert that their performance is excused on the following grounds: (1) mutually mistaken assumptions that PERB would administer the PERS system in a prudent manner to provide benefits in accordance with legislative intent; and (2) impossibility or impracticability based on extreme financial hardship.\"</blockquote>\n<p>(Emphasis in original; footnotes omitted.)</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.

The plaintiff, an employer insured by the State Accident Insurance Fund Corporation (SAIF), contended that the legislation violated Article I, section 21, of the Oregon Constitution by impairing the state's contractual obligation (set out in an earlier statute) to use the funds in the IAF for only workers' compensation purposes. This court concluded that the part of the legislation that eliminated the state's obligation to use the surplus funds in the manner specified in the earlier statute constituted an unconstitutional impairment of the state's contractual obligation. 306 Or. at 399, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1176322\"><a href=\"/opinion/1176322/eckles-v-state-of-oregon/\"><span class=\"volume\">760</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">846</span></a></span>. The court further concluded that the part of the legislation that directed the transfer of funds amounted to a mandate that the state breach the contract, <i>id.</i> at 400, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1176322\"><a href=\"/opinion/1176322/eckles-v-state-of-oregon/\"><span class=\"volume\">760</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">846</span></a></span>, which ordinarily would require payment of damages to SAIF employers resulting from the breach, <i>id.</i> at 402, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1176322\"><a href=\"/opinion/1176322/eckles-v-state-of-oregon/\"><span class=\"volume\">760</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">846</span></a></span>.<sup>[25]</sup></p>\n<p><i>Hughes</i> involved legislation that had repealed a state income tax exemption for PERS benefits; specifically, the legislation had (1) made that exemption inapplicable to state personal income taxation; and (2) repealed the corresponding provision in the tax statutes. The plaintiffs, who were present and retired public employees, challenged the legislation under Article I, section 21, and this court ultimately held that the two statutory provisions, respectively, unconstitutionally impaired a contractual obligation and breached the PERS contract. 314 Or. at 29-33, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1155678\"><a href=\"/opinion/1155678/hughes-v-state-of-oregon/\"><span class=\"volume\">838</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1018</span></a></span>. Most significant to our analysis here, the court in <i>Hughes</i> concluded <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1075</span> that \"PERS was intended to be and is a contract between the state and its employees[.]\" 314 Or. at 25, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1155678\"><a href=\"/opinion/1155678/hughes-v-state-of-oregon/\"><span class=\"volume\">838</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1018</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p><i>OSPOA</i> involved challenges to Ballot Measure 8 (1994), which had amended the Oregon Constitution in three ways relating to PERS: (1) by mandating that public employees make six percent contributions to public retirement plans, if so covered, and, correspondingly, by precluding public employers from \"picking up\" that contribution on behalf of their employee members; (2) by prohibiting the state from guaranteeing a rate of return on retirement contributions; and (3) by prohibiting any increase of retirement benefits based on unused sick leave. The plaintiffs brought federal impairment of contract challenges to the amendments, and, after applying state law principles to construe the underlying PERS contract, this court invalidated the amendments as unconstitutional impairments of that contract. In reaching that conclusion, the court concluded that each of the statutory PERS provisions at issue  that is, the provisions permitting employer \"pick-up\" of the employee's contribution, guaranteeing an assumed earnings rate, and providing for inclusion of unused sick leave in benefit calculations  constituted terms of the PERS contract that applied even to work yet to be performed. 323 Or. at 372-79, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1192606\"><a href=\"/opinion/1192606/oregon-police-officersassn-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">765</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>We note some considerations from <i>Eckles</i> and <i>Hughes</i> that guide our analysis in these cases. First, in <i>Eckles,</i> this court clarified that the contracts provision of Article I, section 21, prohibited the impairment of a contractual <i>obligation. </i><i>Eckles,</i> 306 Or. at 395, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1176322\"><a href=\"/opinion/1176322/eckles-v-state-of-oregon/\"><span class=\"volume\">760</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">846</span></a></span>. As to the determination whether newer legislation amounts to an impairment of a preexisting statutory contractual obligation, the court focused on whether the legislation would change or eliminate the state's obligation under that contract. <i>Id.</i> at 399-400, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1176322\"><a href=\"/opinion/1176322/eckles-v-state-of-oregon/\"><span class=\"volume\">760</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">846</span></a></span>. By contrast, the court explained that legislation that mandated a breach on the state's part of such a contractual obligation  but did not change or eliminate the obligation itself  did not <i>contravene</i> Article I, section 21, although, in accordance with that constitutional provision, such legislation ordinarily would require payment of damages resulting from the breach. <i>Id.</i> at 400-02, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1176322\"><a href=\"/opinion/1176322/eckles-v-state-of-oregon/\"><span class=\"volume\">760</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">846</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>In <i>Hughes,</i> this court set out a two-step process for addressing a claim of contractual impairment or breach under Article I, section 21:</p>\n<blockquote>\"First, it must be determined whether a contract exists to which the person asserting an impairment is a party; and, second, it must be determined whether a law of this state has impaired an obligation of that contract. General principles of contract law normally will govern both inquiries, even where the state is alleged to be a party to the contract at issue.\"</blockquote>\n<p><i>Hughes,</i> 314 Or. at 14, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1155678\"><a href=\"/opinion/1155678/hughes-v-state-of-oregon/\"><span class=\"volume\">838</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1018</span></a></span>. In its ensuing analysis, the court divided the first question into three component inquiries: (1) is there a state contract?; (2) if so, what are its terms?; and (3) what obligations do the terms provide? <i>See id.</i> at 17-29, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1155678\"><a href=\"/opinion/1155678/hughes-v-state-of-oregon/\"><span class=\"volume\">838</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1018</span></a></span> (engaging in those inquiries). Further, as noted above, this court in <i>Hughes</i> concluded that PERS constituted a statutory contract. <i>Id.</i> at 25, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1155678\"><a href=\"/opinion/1155678/hughes-v-state-of-oregon/\"><span class=\"volume\">838</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1018</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Obligation of Successive Legislatures</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We underscore that the claims presented here, for the most part, concern contract formation and implicate what this court has described as the \"significant\" proposition that, if certain circumstances are met, \"one legislature may bind a succeeding legislature to a particular course of action.\" <i>Id.</i> at 13, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1155678\"><a href=\"/opinion/1155678/hughes-v-state-of-oregon/\"><span class=\"volume\">838</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1018</span></a></span>. That proposition is significant, in part because \"[o]rdinarily it is the function of a legislature to make laws and not contracts.\" <i>Campbell et al. v. Aldrich et al.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3838402\"><a href=\"/opinion/4079958/campbell-v-aldrich/\"><span class=\"volume\">159</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Or.</span> <span class=\"page\">208</span></a></span>, 213, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3838402\"><a href=\"/opinion/4079958/campbell-v-aldrich/\"><span class=\"volume\">79</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">257</span></a></span> (1938). However, as the court in <i>Campbell</i> went on to state:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[L]egislative enactments may contain provisions which, when accepted as the basis of action by individuals, become contracts between them and the state. It is also equally well established that the intention of the Legislature thus to create contractual obligations, resulting in extinguishment to a certain extent of governmental powers, must clearly and unmistakably appear. The intention to surrender or suspend legislative control over matters vitally affecting <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1076</span> the public welfare cannot be established by mere implication.\"</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 213-14, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3838402\"><a href=\"/opinion/4079958/campbell-v-aldrich/\"><span class=\"volume\">79</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">257</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>Order of Analysis</i>\n</h2>\n<p>As a final preliminary matter, we note that petitioners' arguments arise under and implicate various sources of state and federal law. When, as here, we are presented with multiple bases for disposition, this court generally considers the issues hierarchically. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>State v. Kennedy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1142841\"><a href=\"/opinion/1142841/state-v-kennedy/\"><span class=\"volume\">295</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Or.</span> <span class=\"page\">260</span></a></span>, 262, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1142841\"><a href=\"/opinion/1142841/state-v-kennedy/\"><span class=\"volume\">666</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1316</span></a></span> (1983) (so stating; addressing defendant's state constitutional law claim before considering his federal claim). Accordingly, we begin by addressing petitioners' claims under state law.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. <i>Petitioners' State Law Contractual Claims</i>\n</h2>\n<p>As noted above, <i>Strunk, Burt,</i> and <i>Evans</i> petitioners rely solely upon the PERS statutes and certain administrative rules as they existed before the 2003 PERS legislation as the bases for their contractual claims  that is, their claims that the 2003 legislation either impairs or breaches obligations set out in the PERS contract. <i>Dahlin</i> and <i>Whitty</i> petitioners, however, cast a broader net. They argue that, in addition to statutory and administrative rule provisions, the PERS contract includes documents that PERB has provided to them over the years.<sup>[26]</sup><i>Whitty</i> petitioners, moreover, also rely on the employee handbook that they received from their employer as establishing some of their contractual rights. Finally, <i>Strunk</i> and <i>Burt</i> petitioners also assert that the 2003 PERS legislation breaches not only the PERS contract but also the settlement agreement resolving litigation that followed this court's decision in <i>Hughes.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>Handbooks and Other Materials as Contract Terms</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>a. <i>Whitty</i> Petitioners</h2>\n<p><i>Whitty</i> petitioners are each employees of SAIF, and they named PERB and SAIF as respondents to their petition for review. <i>Whitty</i> petitioners' opening brief asserts, in part:</p>\n<blockquote>\"In addition to the [a]rguments stated by the <i>Strunk</i> Petitioners, the <i>Whitty</i> petition[ers] are relying upon the Respondent SAIF Corporation's written policy concerning retirement, stated in the SAIF Employee Handbook, as part of their contract with their employer. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"The SAIF policy also refers the employee to the PERS Handbook, `for complete details of the retirement program.' * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"The language used by SAIF Corporation in its retirement policy statement, words such as `established,' `secure' and `guarantees,' is language of contract. * * *\"</blockquote>\n<p>In response, respondents argue that (1) the PERS statutes do not reflect a legislative intent to delegate either to PERB or to SAIF the power to bind future legislatures; (2) even if the legislature had purported to delegate that power, the delegation would be an unconstitutional abdication of the legislature's lawmaking authority; (3) even if such a delegation were permissible, there is no evidence that the legislature intended to delegate <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1077</span> such authority to PERB staff or SAIF, as opposed to PERB; and (4) at least insofar as the SAIF employee manual is concerned, it promises nothing more than the ability of its employees to participate in PERS like all other state employees.</p>\n<p>In reply, <i>Whitty</i> petitioners argue, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Respondents argue that the SAIF policy on retirement and the PERS Handbook are not part of Petitioners' contract because the language of the PERS statutes does not reflect an intent to delegate the power to bind future legislatures to an administrative agency. The language of the PERS statutes also does not delegate to SAIF Corporation, or any other governmental agency the power to enter into any contract with its employees. Yet, this court has held that a Multnomah County Ordinance is a sufficient basis for a retirement benefit contract. <i>Taylor v. Multn[.] * * * Dept[.] Sher[.] Ret[.] B[d.],</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">265</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Or.</span> <span class=\"page\">445</span></span>, 451, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1117036\"><a href=\"/opinion/1117036/taylor-v-multnomah-cty-deputy-sher-retire-bd/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">339</span></a></span> (1973). * * * If a county can contract with its employees through enactment of an ordinance establishing a retirement benefit, certainly an independent public corporation, SAIF, can contract with employees through adoption of a policy conferring retirement benefits. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"As to whether the PERS Handbook is a part of Petitioners' contract with SAIF, the SAIF policy on retirement incorporates the benefits conferred in that Handbook by reference. * * * It did not adopt the Handbook as a `legal reference.'\"<sup>[27]</sup></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>b. Petitioner Dahlin</h2>\n<p>Petitioner Dahlin's opening brief asserts, in part:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Petitioner Dahlin relied on the PERS statutes, rules, handbooks, annual statements and web site estimates when planning his retirement. Based on his review of the communications from PERS, Petitioner Dahlin believed that the Money Match would produce a greater retirement benefit than the Full Formula. Petitioner Dahlin's understanding that the Money Match calculation would exceed the value of the Full Formula benefit was confirmed by annual statements that he received from PERS beginning in 1998.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"At all relevant times, the PERS handbooks * * * stated that `\"vesting\" means you cannot lose your benefit rights, even if you stop working in covered employment.'\"</blockquote>\n<p>Respondents offered essentially the same arguments in response to petitioner Dahlin as they did to <i>Whitty</i> petitioners, summarizing their response as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[P]etitioner Dahlin asserts that his contract rights  to the extent they exist  arise from PERS handbooks and his annual statements, in addition to the PERS statutes and regulations. This assertion is incorrect. There has been no legislative delegation to PER[B] that would allow the agency to bind future Legislative Assemblies. Indeed, such a delegation would be unconstitutional. Moreover, these documents on which petitioner Dahlin relies actually contain language disclosing the fact that they are not legal references or complete statements of the PERS statutes or rules, and that in [the event of] any conflict the statutes and rules shall prevail.\"</blockquote>\n<p>In reply, petitioner Dahlin states:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[Respondents] respond that as of 2001 the Handbooks contained a disclaimer that indicated that if a conflict exists between the PERS statutes and the Handbook, the statute will control. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"[Respondents'] response, however, missed the point of Petitioner Dahlin's argument. Petitioner Dahlin is not arguing that a conflict exists between the PERS statute[s], its administrative rules, and the PERS Handbook. Rather, Petitioner Dahlin is arguing that the PERS Handbook <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1078</span> is consistent with Oregon Law and the lack of a `reservation of rights clause' is the recognition of and an embodiment of the contract theory of pensions. * * *\"</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>c. Discussion</h2>\n<p>To the extent that petitioner Dahlin and <i>Whitty</i> petitioners argue that the PERS handbooks, PERB communications, and the employment policies of SAIF form part of the PERS contract, we reiterate that this court has held that PERS is a <i>statutory</i> contract. <i>Hughes,</i> 314 Or. at 25, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1155678\"><a href=\"/opinion/1155678/hughes-v-state-of-oregon/\"><span class=\"volume\">838</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1018</span></a></span>. Therefore, the question whether the materials on which petitioners in part rely constitute terms of that statutory contract is a question of legislative intent. <i>See generally </i><i>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2613226\"><a href=\"/opinion/2613226/pge-v-bureau-of-labor-and-industries/\"><span class=\"volume\">317</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Or.</span> <span class=\"page\">606</span></a></span>, 610-11, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2613226\"><a href=\"/opinion/2613226/pge-v-bureau-of-labor-and-industries/\"><span class=\"volume\">859</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1143</span></a></span> (1993) (statutory construction involves ascertaining legislature's intent; to do so, court first examines text and context of statute at issue); ORS 174.020(1)(a) (\"[i]n the construction of a statute, a court shall pursue the intention of the legislature if possible\"). Even disregarding respondents' argument that the legislature lacks the power to delegate to an administrative agency or other subdivision of the state the authority to set the terms of the PERS contract, the predicate question remains: did the legislature <i>intend</i> to do so?</p>\n<p>In that respect, petitioners point to no Oregon statute indicating that the legislature intended to permit PERB or any other entity as a general matter to set or alter any terms of the PERS statutory contract.<sup>[28]</sup> Nor has our own research revealed any support for the idea that the legislature intended to permit PERB or any other governmental entity  through the issuance of handbooks, policy statements, account summaries, or otherwise  to provide binding pronouncements of the retirement benefits that PERS will provide. We hold that the PERS handbooks, communications from PERB to PERS members, and SAIF's employment policies do not constitute terms of the PERS contract.</p>\n<p>That holding does not meet directly the separate argument of <i>Whitty</i> petitioners that the 2003 PERS legislation breaches or impairs their separate employment contracts with SAIF. They analogize those contracts to the ordinance at issue in <i>Taylor,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">265</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Or.</span> <span class=\"page\">445</span></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1117036\"><a href=\"/opinion/1117036/taylor-v-multnomah-cty-deputy-sher-retire-bd/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">339</span></a></span>. That analogy is inapposite, however, for the simple reason that nothing about the retirement policy at issue in <i>Taylor</i> implicated a state statutory contract or any other legislative policy.<sup>[29]</sup> For <i>Whitty</i> petitioners to succeed in that argument, the retirement policy that SAIF provides to its employees would have to be independent of PERS. But that is not the case. SAIF offers its employees the PERS retirement plan, not a SAIF retirement plan or some sort of PERS hybrid. And, as we determined above, nothing in the PERS statutes indicates that the legislature intended to authorize public employers to set the terms of the PERS contract.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, we reject the arguments of petitioner Dahlin and <i>Whitty</i> petitioners that the PERS contract includes terms outside the PERS statutes (and applicable administrative rules) and the argument of <i>Whitty</i> petitioners that the 2003 PERS legislation breaches or impairs their employment contracts with SAIF.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>The Chess Settlement</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Until 1991, PERS benefits were not subject to state or local income taxation. ORS 237.201 (1989). In 1989, the United States Supreme Court held that, if a state exempts from state and local taxation pension benefits paid by state and local governments, principles of intergovernmental tax immunity require like treatment of pension benefits paid by the federal government. <i>Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112227\"><a href=\"/opinion/112227/davis-v-michigan-dept-of-treasury/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">803</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112227\"><a href=\"/opinion/112227/davis-v-michigan-dept-of-treasury/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">891</span></a></span> (1989). At the time of the <i>Davis</i> decision, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1079</span> Oregon taxed federal pension benefits as personal income.</p>\n<p>Responding to that and other decisions, the 1991 Legislative Assembly enacted Oregon Laws 1991, chapter 823, which repealed the tax exemption for PERS benefits, thereby equalizing the tax treatment of state and federal pensions. As noted earlier in this opinion, this court in <i>Hughes</i> held that that repeal of the tax exemption breached the PERS contract. <i>Hughes,</i> 314 Or. at 33, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1155678\"><a href=\"/opinion/1155678/hughes-v-state-of-oregon/\"><span class=\"volume\">838</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1018</span></a></span>. The court, however, concluded that \"[t]he legislature is the most appropriate branch of government in the first instance to choose among the available remedies\" for that breach. <i>Id.</i> at 33 n. 36, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1155678\"><a href=\"/opinion/1155678/hughes-v-state-of-oregon/\"><span class=\"volume\">838</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1018</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>When the legislature failed to enact a remedy, class action litigation  to which we refer as the <i>Chess</i> litigation  ensued. The trial court in <i>Chess</i> ultimately approved a settlement for damages covering all PERS retirees who were PERS members before the effective date of the 1991 tax repeal (September 29, 1991). The settlement agreement provided that the \"[p]laintiffs agree to accept the remedies provided in [the legislation] as full and complete payment for all claims raised in [the class] actions.\" The legislature adopted the terms of the <i>Chess</i> settlement and codified them at ORS 238.375 to 238.380. ORS 238.375(3) provides:</p>\n<blockquote>\"No member of the system or beneficiary of a member of the system shall acquire a right, contractual or otherwise, to the increased benefits provided by [ORS 238.375 to 238.380].\"</blockquote>\n<p>The implementation of those settlement terms resulted in an annual increase in employer contribution rates of approximately 1.4 percent, amounting to a permanent annual expense that PERB assumed would continue for 30 years.</p>\n<p><i>Strunk</i> and <i>Burt</i> petitioners argue that Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, <i>as amended by</i> Oregon Laws 2003, chapters 625 and 733, when considered generally, breaches the settlement agreement in <i>Chess.</i> Their analysis proceeds as follows: PERB understood that codifying the <i>Chess</i> settlement would increase employer contribution rates; employer contribution rates in fact increased as a direct result of that legislation; the preamble to Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, states that one reason for the enactment was to address the increase in employer contribution rates; some of that increase resulted from the <i>Chess</i> settlement legislation; and therefore, \"[t]o the extent that the legislature has lowered PERS retirement benefits, at least in part, because of the increase granted by [the legislation], then it has in fact repealed the benefits of [that legislation].\"</p>\n<p>Respondents disagree for various reasons, only one of which we need address. Respondents argue, we conclude correctly, that the <i>Chess</i> settlement agreement by its specific terms limited petitioners' rights to those set out in the 1991 legislation and that that legislation expressly disavowed the creation of any contractual rights. The wording of ORS 238.375(3), which codified the settlement, could not be clearer in that respect. Nothing about the context of that wording alters what we perceive to be the legislature's manifest intent. Because petitioners have failed to demonstrate a contractual right that Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, <i>as amended by</i> Oregon Laws 2003, chapters 625 and 733, is capable of breaching with respect to the <i>Chess</i> settlement, we reject their argument.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. <i>Petitioners' Statutory Contract Claims</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We now turn to the central issues in these cases  that is, petitioners' contentions that various aspects of the 2003 PERS legislation unconstitutionally impair statutory contractual obligations set out in the PERS contract in violation of Article I, section 21, or, alternatively, that aspects of the 2003 legislation breach statutory contractual obligations set out in the PERS contract. We discuss each challenged aspect of the 2003 legislation separately.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>a. Redirection of Members' Contributions to the IAP</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>(1) The Statutes</h2>\n<p>As noted, before the 2003 PERS legislation, PERS members were required to contribute, or to have employers contribute on behalf of their employee members, six percent <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1080</span> of members' salaries to those members' regular accounts. We set out the relevant statutes below.</p>\n<p>ORS 238.200(1)(a) (2001) provided:</p>\n<blockquote>\"An active member of the system shall contribute to the fund and there shall be withheld from salary of the member six percent of that salary.\"</blockquote>\n<p>ORS 238.200(2) (2001) provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The contributions of each member as provided in subsection (1) of this section shall be deducted by the employer from each payroll and transmitted by the employer to [PERB], which shall cause them to be credited to the member account of the member.\"</blockquote>\n<p>ORS 238.205 (2001) provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, and subject to the provisions of this section, a public employer participating in the system may agree, by a written employment policy or agreement in effect on or after July 1, 1979, to `pick-up,' assume or pay the full amount of contributions to the fund required of all or less than all active members of the system employed by the employer.\"</blockquote>\n<p>The 2003 PERS legislation, however, amended ORS 238.200 to discontinue contributions to the PERS fund:</p>\n<blockquote>\"a member of [PERS], or a participating employer acting on behalf of the member pursuant to ORS 238.205, is not permitted or required to make employee contributions to the fund for service performed on or after January 1, 2004. * * *\"</blockquote>\n<p>Or. Laws 2003, ch 67, § 1(4), <i>as amended by</i> Or. Laws 2003, ch. 625, § 9, <i>codified as</i> ORS 238.200(4). Instead, all PERS members who established membership in the system before August 29, 2003, now are members of the IAP. ORS 238A.305(1). As of January 1, 2004, those members' six percent contributions  which remain mandatory  now go into their IAP accounts, rather than into their regular accounts. Or. Laws 2003, ch. 733, §§ 32, 34, 35, <i>codified as</i> ORS 238A.330; ORS 238A.335. As before, employers still may agree to pick up the six percent contributions. Or. Laws, 2003, ch. 733, § 34, <i>codified as</i> ORS 238A.335. Each IAP account is credited with earnings and losses on the member's contributions, less administrative expenses. Or. Laws 2003, ch. 733, § 37(1), <i>codified as</i> ORS 238A.350(1). Upon retiring, the member will receive, in a lump sum payment, the full amount of that member's IAP account, Or. Laws 2003, ch. 733, § 41(1), <i>codified as</i> ORS 238A.400(1), in addition to any retirement benefits for work performed before January 1, 2004, to which the member may be entitled under PERS as it existed before the 2003 legislation. Alternatively, in lieu of the lump sum payment, the member may elect to receive the amount in his or her IAP account in installments paid over 5, 10, 15, or 20 years. Or. Laws 2003, ch. 733, § 41(2), <i>codified as</i> ORS 238A.400(2).</p>\n<p>As noted earlier in this opinion, although PERS members will receive at retirement the balances held in their IAP accounts, those balances (1) are not guaranteed annual crediting at not less than the assumed earnings rate; (2) at retirement, will not be subject to the Money Match; and (3) at retirement, will not be enhanced by annual COLAs. Respondent State of Oregon characterizes the IAP accounts as \"invested and credited in the same fashion as a typical 401(k) or IRA account,\" and we agree with that general description.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>(2) The Parties' Arguments</h2>\n<p>All petitioners, except petitioner Sartain, challenge the discontinuation of PERS members' contributions to their regular accounts.<sup>[30]</sup> Petitioners argue that the 2001 versions of the statutes set out above</p>\n<blockquote>\"were unquestionably part of the PERS Act, were integral to the calculation of benefits under the Act, were unambiguously promissory, [and] contained no language excluding contributions attributable to future service from the general contractual protection and no reservation of right of future amendment.\"</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1081</span> In support of that assertion, petitioners note that ORS 238.250 (2001), which provided for the regular account (as that statute continues to do), has remained virtually unchanged since the adoption of the first state retirement act in 1945.</p>\n<p>Although petitioners note that amounts from each member's IAP account will be payable at retirement as a lump sum without employer matching or application of annual COLAs, that is not the effect of the legislation that they emphasize. Instead, petitioners argue primarily that,</p>\n<blockquote>\"[a]s a result of this diversion, most mid-career employees will lose the option of retiring under Money Match and will find their benefits calculated under the less generous full formula benefit. * * * Under ORS 238.300 (2001), however, petitioners were promised calculation of their benefits under the formula which would produce the highest value. * * * By diverting their contributions, Section 1 of HB 2003 [Or Laws 2003, ch 67, § 1], effectively denies petitioners the contractual protection afforded by ORS 238.300(2) (2001).[<sup>[31]</sup>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"As it did in <i>OSPOA,</i>[<sup>[32]</sup>] this court should find that this permanent elimination of petitioners' statutory right to receive a pension calculated on the full value of their account[,] including future contributions and earnings thereon, constitutes an impairment of their PERS contract or[,] at a minimum, a breach of the contractual promise that all member contributions and earnings would be directed to and maintained in that PERS member account.\"</blockquote>\n<p>Respondents counter that PERS members' contributions to their regular accounts are an obligation on each member's part, rather than a contractual right that inures to each member's benefit. To the extent that any such promise exists, respondents continue, there is no support in the text or context of the PERS statutes for a legislative promise that members could continue to contribute to their regular accounts throughout their PERS membership.</p>\n<p>Respondents assert that that conclusion is bolstered by the fact that, when the legislature adopted the Full Formula in 1981, it simultaneously reduced the statutory contributions of higher compensated PERS members from seven percent to six percent. Or. Laws 1981, ch. 761, § 1 (discussed further below). Such a reduction, they argue, is inconsistent with a legislative understanding that PERS members would have a perpetual right to maintain contributions to the system at a particular level. Otherwise, the legislature would have grandfathered those members who, before 1981, were required to contribute seven percent of salary so as to preserve the amount of benefits that those members would receive at retirement.</p>\n<p>Responding to petitioners' assertion that most mid-career PERS members effectively will lose the option of retiring under the Money Match, respondents counter that the PERS statutes require only that a member receive a service retirement allowance calculated under the formula that produces the highest pension amount, whichever formula that may be. There is no indication, they contend, that the legislature intended that members would have an option to have their service retirement allowances calculated under a particular formula, the Money Match or otherwise. Moreover, respondents assert that certain wording in the PERS statutes indicates that the legislature intended the Money Match to be the floor for any service retirement calculation and, consistently with that proposition, either the Full Formula or the Pension Plus Annuity provided the highest service retirement allowance for most members before the mid-1990s.<sup>[33]</sup> They conclude <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1082</span> that, under the 2003 PERS legislation, members still will have those retirement benefits that derive from their member accounts as they existed before the 2003 PERS legislation, calculated on the full value of those accounts. As to the other statutes upon which petitioners rely, ORS 238.205 (2001) (permitting employer pick-up) and ORS 238.250 (2001) (requiring PERB to provide regular accounts for members, showing contributions and earnings), respondents argue that the 2003 PERS legislation does not alter the pick-up provisions and that the directive for PERB to establish PERS regular accounts for members is nothing more than \"a clerical obligation imposed on PERB\" to \"maintain appropriate record-keeping on member's regular accounts.\"</p>\n<p>In the end, respondents assert that petitioners' only true complaint respecting the redirection of PERS member contributions to the IAP is that their projected future service retirement allowances under the 2003 PERS legislation will not be as high as those allowances would have been without the legislation. And, although respondents agree that such will be the case, they disagree with petitioners' claims that that complaint has either contractual or constitutional consequences.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>(3) Discussion</h2>\n<p>We begin by noting some preliminary considerations. First, we are mindful that the \"accepted proposition of the contractual nature of PERS is an essential background\" for our inquiry. <i>Hughes,</i> 314 Or. at 22, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1155678\"><a href=\"/opinion/1155678/hughes-v-state-of-oregon/\"><span class=\"volume\">838</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1018</span></a></span>. Further, although petitioners cite a number of statutes as significant to our analysis of their challenge to the redirection of member contributions to the IAP, we conclude that the service retirement allowance formula provisions, set out in ORS 238.300 (2001), viewed in context with other statutes that petitioners cite, are the most central to our analysis, as explained below.<sup>[34]</sup></p>\n<p>As noted, the crux of petitioners' analysis is that the diversion of contributions from PERS members' regular accounts to IAP accounts means that \"most mid-career employees will lose the option of retiring under Money Match and will find their benefits calculated under the less generous full formula benefit.\" Accordingly, we proceed to assess in detail the relevant benefit formulas that PERS provides. That is, we consider whether the statutory provisions containing those formulas are part of the PERS contract and, if so, the extent of the state's obligation in that regard.</p>\n<p>ORS 238.300 (2001)<sup>[35]</sup> provided, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Upon retiring from service at normal retirement age or thereafter, a member of the system shall receive a service retirement allowance which shall consist of the following annuity and pensions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(1) A refund annuity which shall be the actuarial equivalent of accumulated contributions <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1083</span> by the member and interest thereon credited at the time of retirement * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(2)(a) A life pension (nonrefund) for current service provided by the contributions of employers, which pension, subject to paragraph (b) of this subsection, shall be an amount which, when added to the sum of the annuity under subsection (1) of this section and the annuity, if any, provided on the same basis and payable from the Variable Annuity Account, both annuities considered on a refund basis, results in a total of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(A) For service as a police officer or firefighter, two percent of final average salary multiplied by the number of years of membership in the system * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(B) For service as a member of the Legislative Assembly, two percent of final average salary multiplied by the number of years of membership in the system * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(C) For service as other than a police officer, firefighter or member of the Legislative Assembly, 1.67 percent of final average salary multiplied by the number of years of membership in the system * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(b) A pension under this subsection shall be at least:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(A) The actuarial equivalent of the annuity provided by the accumulated contributions of the member.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(B) For a member who made contributions before August 21, 1981, the equivalent of a pension computed pursuant to this subsection as it existed immediately before that date.\"</blockquote>\n<p>As a matter of plain text, ORS 238.300 (2001) provides, first, that a member is entitled to receive a service retirement allowance that is calculated by multiplying the member's final average salary by a factor of 1.67 percent for general service employees and then multiplying the resulting figure by the member's years of membership. That service retirement allowance then is funded by an annuity component (consisting of the actuarial equivalent of the member's account balances at retirement) and a pension component (consisting of employer contributions). ORS 238.300(1), (2)(a) (2001). That is the Full Formula.</p>\n<p>However, if the pension component as calculated under the Full Formula is less than the actuarial equivalent of the annuity component based on a member's accumulated contributions to the fund, then the member is entitled to receive a higher pension component  that is, one composed of the actuarial equivalent of the member's accumulated contributions. ORS 238.300(2)(b)(A) (2001). That is the Money Match (<i>i.e.,</i> the employer-funded pension component \"matches\" the member's annuity component). And, if a member contributed to PERS before August 21, 1981, and the pension component calculated for that member based on the system as it existed immediately before that date provides a higher pension component than ones calculated under the Full Formula and the Money Match, then the member receives the higher pension amount. ORS 238.300(2)(b)(B) (2001). That is the Pension Plus Annuity.</p>\n<p>In other words, ORS 238.300 (2001) provided (and still provides) that a retired PERS member will receive a final service retirement allowance that is calculated under the one formula of the three described above that yields the highest pension amount for that member, whichever formula that may be. At the same time, it appears to us that, notwithstanding the somewhat awkward placement of the words \"at least\" in ORS 238.300(2)(b) (2001), the legislature intended to set the Full Formula as the primary formula and, generally, designed the Full Formula so as to provide a minimum level below which the pension component should not fall. That is so because the Full Formula, which, significantly, is set out in the first two parts of the statute, ORS 238.300(1) and (2)(a) (2001), sets a defined benefit that does not vary depending on fluctuations in earnings or on the size of the member's annuities from the regular and variable accounts.<sup>[36]</sup> Thus, in that context, the words \"at least\" in ORS 238.300(2)(b) (2001) refer to a calculation of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1084</span> the Full Formula pension component that equals or exceeds a calculation of a pension component calculated under the Money Match (based on the member's accumulated contributions to the fund) or the Pension Plus Annuity (based on earlier statutory requirements).</p>\n<p>More importantly, the wording of ORS 238.300 (2001) is unambiguously promissory. Through that statute, the legislature continuously and unequivocally has communicated to PERS members that, if they retire from service at normal retirement age, they will receive a pension component of their final service retirement allowance that, (1) when combined with the actuarial equivalent of their accumulated contributions to the fund, will consist of the Full Formula amount based upon years of service, final average salary, and class of service that equals or exceeds any pension component calculated under the other two formulas; or (2) in the event that the Full Formula calculation falls short, a pension component calculated under the Money Match or the Pension Plus Annuity. In short, the state's obligation as set out in ORS 238.300 (2001) is to provide a final service retirement allowance made up of an annuity component and a pension component at the minimum level described above.</p>\n<p>The context of ORS 238.300 (2001), which includes the development of the statute through successive legislatures, <i>Swarens v. Dept. of Rev.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">320</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Or.</span> <span class=\"page\">326</span></span>, 331, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">883</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">853</span></span> 1994), confirms that reading. ORS 238.300 and its predecessor statute, <i>former</i> ORS 237.147 (1993), have been a part of the PERS statutes since the creation of PERS in 1953.<sup>[37]</sup> During those 50 years, the benefits that PERS has provided and the manner for calculating them have changed considerably. As the Special Master noted, when the legislature created PERS, the system provided a Money Purchase Plan with an employer matching component. <i>See</i> Or. Laws 1953, ch. 200, § 18 (setting out benefit formula).<sup>[38]</sup> The stated goal of that formula, once combined with an annuity funded by member contributions, was to provide career employees ineligible for the federal Social Security program approximately one half of their final average salaries; for those eligible for Social Security, the target was less. <i>Id.</i> at § 13.</p>\n<p>In 1955, the legislature increased the target replacement ratio from 50 to 60 percent of final average salary, including Social Security. Or. Laws 1955, ch. 131, § 5(2). That enactment also modified the member contribution rate to provide that members making more than $4,800 per year could elect to contribute an equal percentage of salary in excess of that amount, which contributions would \"purchase at retirement[] additional benefits which will be matched by the employer.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>In 1967, the legislature repealed the provisions stating target retirement goals and abandoned calculating member contribution rates based strictly on actuarial assumptions, opting instead for a straight percentage-of-salary model. <i>See</i> Or. Laws 1967, ch. 622, § 4. The legislature also enacted the Pension Plus Annuity, under which retired members would receive an annuity (based on accumulated contributions and earnings) and a pension calculated as the actuarial equivalent of 1.67 percent of the member's final average salary for general service employees (1.92 percent for fire and police employees) multiplied by years of membership up to 30 years for general service (25 years for fire or police service). Or. Laws 1967, ch. 622, § 13. Finally, the legislature repealed the employer matching method for calculating the pension component. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>In 1969, the legislature restored the employer matching method (now known as the \"Money Match\") as one method for determining the pension component of retirement benefits. As between the Money Match and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1085</span> the Pension Plus Annuity, the amendment provided that the pension component of a service retirement allowance \"shall be <i>at least</i> the actuarial equivalent of the annuity provided by the accumulated contributions of the [member].\" Or. Laws 1969, ch. 640, § 7(2)(b) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Other than changing the multiplier for the Pension Plus Annuity, Or. Laws 1971, ch. 738, § 2; Or. Laws 1973, ch. 695, § 4, removing the 25- and 30-year limits on years of membership, Or. Laws 1971, ch. 738, § 2, and including legislators in the system, Or. Laws 1975, ch. 137, § 3, the legislature did not amend the PERS statutes in any significant way until 1981. In that year, the legislature added the Full Formula, described in greater detail above, which has remained substantially unchanged since that time. Or. Laws 1981, ch. 761, § 4.<sup>[39]</sup></p>\n<p>As we develop more fully below, the evolution of the statutory provisions setting out the formulas for calculating PERS members' service retirement allowances, in our view, accords with the preliminary conclusion that we drew from examining the text of ORS 238.300 (2001). That is, contrary to petitioners' arguments, the legislature did not promise that PERS would be maintained so that the Money Match remains the primary calculator of member service retirement allowances, which it presently happens to be because it usually is the most remunerative. Instead, that statutory evolution demonstrates that the legislature promised that members would receive service retirement allowances calculated under whichever formula yields the highest pension amount for that member and that the Full Formula calculation ordinarily should equal or exceed calculations under the Money Match or, if applicable, the Pension Plus Annuity.</p>\n<p>Before assessing the import of the statutory context set out above, we must ensure that we are ascertaining the intent of the correct legislature  an inquiry that is critical when analyzing statutory contracts. That is so because the fundamental purpose behind such contracts is to bind future legislative action. <i>See generally Hughes,</i> 314 Or. at 13, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1155678\"><a href=\"/opinion/1155678/hughes-v-state-of-oregon/\"><span class=\"volume\">838</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1018</span></a></span> (discussing effect of binding succeeding legislature). To know when a legislature is so bound, we first must determine which legislature enacted the operative statutory contract.</p>\n<p>As a general matter, this court has recognized several principles that it has applied at the first level of the <i>PGE</i> analysis, 317 Or. at 610-11, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2613226\"><a href=\"/opinion/2613226/pge-v-bureau-of-labor-and-industries/\"><span class=\"volume\">859</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1143</span></a></span>, to assist in the construction of amendatory acts. One of those principles is the presumption that \"material changes in the language of the statute create material changes in meaning.\" <i>Carlson v. Myers,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"836577\"><a href=\"/opinion/836577/carlson-v-myers/\"><span class=\"volume\">327</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Or.</span> <span class=\"page\">213</span></a></span>, 225, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"836577\"><a href=\"/opinion/836577/carlson-v-myers/\"><span class=\"volume\">959</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></a></span> (1998). Another is a corollary to that presumption: \"[I]t is presumed that such changes in meaning do not go further than is expressly declared or necessarily implied.\" <i>Id.</i> And, finally for our purposes here,</p>\n<blockquote>\"`where a section of the statute is amended so as to read \"as follows,\" and the section is then set forth with the changes intended to be made, those portions of the old section that are merely copied into the amendment without change are not to be considered as re-enacted or as a new statement of the law, but are to be read as a part of the earlier statute, if in conflict with another law passed after the section amended and before the amendatory act, unless there is a clear manifestation of legislative intention to the contrary. In the absence of such an intention, it is the change or the additions incorporated in the section amended only that are to be considered enacted.'\"</blockquote>\n<p><i>Jones v.

From 1953 through 1967, PERS did not provide members with any minimum level of benefits. Instead, a retired member received only the contributions and earnings in his or her account matched by an employer pension in an equal amount. The key variable to that formula was earnings. And, as petitioners note, those earnings provided \"the only hope that members would have of achieving an annuity which approached the goals of the system.\"</p>\n<p>That changed in 1967, when the legislature repealed the employer-matching alternative and replaced it with the Pension Plus Annuity. Under that system, a retired PERS member was guaranteed a minimum pension component that would be added to whatever annuity that the contributions and earnings on the member's accounts had provided, whether those earnings had been good or bad. Thus, unlike the earlier employer-matching method, which had placed the risk of investment loss on members, under the Pension Plus Annuity, members could expect some minimum level of benefits and shared the risk of earnings shortfalls with employers.</p>\n<p>As noted, in 1969, the legislature reinstated what is now known as the Money Match as an additional formula to calculate the pension component of a member's service retirement allowance. Such an amendment could have been a meaningful legislative act only if the legislature contemplated that the Money Match might for some retired members provide higher pension amounts. Such an expectation, however, does not support the conclusion that the legislature <i>promised</i> members that that <i>always</i> would be the case.</p>\n<p>The final change that we determine to be relevant to understanding the evolution of the formulas for calculating service retirement allowances occurred in 1981 with the creation of the Full Formula. With that amendment, the legislature, for the first time, provided members with a formula under which the risk of earnings loss fell  and continues to fall  squarely on employers. The changes that the 1981 amendments made to <i>former</i> ORS 237.147 (1979), now ORS 238.300, were material: they added a new, primary benefit calculator to the system and shifted the downside risk of investment return away from members. Because we presume that the legislature intended those material changes to change the meaning of the statute materially as well, we conclude that the 1981 amendments effected a reenactment of the entire section and provide the version of the statute to which we will look in ascertaining the legislature's promissory intent.</p>\n<p>Having concluded that Oregon Laws 1981, chapter 761, section 4, enacted the operative statutory contract that is now embodied in ORS 238.300 (and also was embodied in ORS 238.300 (2001)), we find nothing about the statutory law that preceded the 1981 amendments to <i>former</i> ORS 237.147 (1979) that detracts from the preliminary conclusion that we drew from the wording of ORS 238.300 (2001), that is, that the 1981 Legislative Assembly promised PERS members that, on retirement, they would receive the retirement formula yielding the highest pension amount. Nor do we find any contrary intent revealed in the other statutes upon which petitioners rely (concerning six percent member contributions and direction of those contributions to PERS regular accounts).</p>\n<p>Our case law is consistent with that conclusion. As an initial matter, the parties have not directed us to a prior decision interpreting the relevant statutory provisions, and we have found none. Looking more broadly to this court's prior decisions involving PERS, petitioners place heavy reliance on this court's decision in <i>OSPOA,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1192606\"><a href=\"/opinion/1192606/oregon-police-officersassn-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">323</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Or.</span> <span class=\"page\">356</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1192606\"><a href=\"/opinion/1192606/oregon-police-officersassn-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">765</span></a></span>. <i>OSPOA,</i> however, stands for only the proposition that the legislature promised members that the permissible employer pick-up of member contributions, assumed earnings rate for Tier One members, and unused sick-leave accrual provisions of the PERS statutory scheme were promissory and applied even to work yet to be performed. However, nothing about the court's interpretation of the statutory provisions at issue in <i>OSPOA</i> mandates a conclusion different from the one that we have reached after analyzing the text and context of ORS 238.300 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1087</span> (2001).<sup>[40]</sup></p>\n<p>In summary, we conclude that the 1981 Legislative Assembly promised each eligible member that, at retirement, the member would be entitled to receive a service retirement allowance calculated under the formula that yielded the highest pension amount. The legislature did not alter or eliminate that promise when it enacted the 2003 PERS legislation.</p>\n<p>Petitioners contend, however, that the statutory contractual obligation that we just have described includes an additional promise that PERS members have the right, during the course of their PERS membership, to contribute a certain percentage of their salary to their regular accounts so as to <i>increase</i> the value of their ultimate pension amount under the Money Match. We disagree.</p>\n<p>Nothing in the text of ORS 238.200(1)(a) (2001), which required PERS members to contribute six percent of their salaries to the fund, supports petitioners' argument that the legislature intended that contribution to be immutable. As noted earlier, the 1981 Legislative Assembly lowered the member contribution rate from a high of seven percent to a uniform six percent. And, at the same time, the legislature grandfathered those members previously paying a contribution rate of less than six percent, even though it meant that those members' account balances, and therefore the service retirement allowances that the members ultimately would receive, would be smaller under the Money Match. In other words, the text of ORS 238.200(1)(a) (2001) and its statutory context do not establish clearly and unambiguously that the legislature intended to promise members that they could contribute six percent of their salaries to their regular accounts throughout their PERS membership so as to maximize their pension component calculation under the Money Match.</p>\n<p>Applying the foregoing conclusions to petitioners' claims that the redirection of PERS members' future contributions to the IAP, as set out in the 2003 PERS legislation, either breaches or impairs a contractual obligation of the PERS contract, the answer is clear: Nothing about the creation of the IAP alters the legislature's promise that, at retirement, each member will receive a service retirement allowance calculated under the formula yielding the highest pension amount, and nothing about the IAP legislation constitutes a breach of that promise. To the contrary, under the 2003 PERS legislation, each member in the system at the time of the effective date of that legislation will, at retirement, receive a service retirement allowance consisting of an annuity component based on the member's contributions and earnings and a pension component calculated under the formula that yields the highest pension amount.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>b. The Assumed Earnings Rate</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>(1) The Statutes</h2>\n<p>Since 1975, the PERS statutory scheme has provided that the earnings to be credited annually to Tier One members' regular accounts will be no less than the existing assumed earnings rate. <i>See generally</i> Or. Laws 1975, ch. 333, § 2, <i>codified as former</i> ORS 237.277 (1975) (now ORS 238.255).<sup>[41]</sup> Petitioners identify the following statutory provisions as relevant to our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[PERB] shall provide for a regular account for each active and inactive member of the system.

As with the provisions respecting contributions to members' regular accounts that predated the 2003 PERS legislation, petitioners view the wording of the statutory provisions respecting the crediting of earnings to those accounts as unambiguously promissory, applicable to work yet to be performed, and containing no reservation of the right to future amendment.</p>\n<p>Based upon that understanding of the above-quoted 2001 statutory provisions, petitioners argue that the above-quoted provisions from the 2003 PERS legislation directly and indirectly either breach or impair those earlier obligations:</p>\n<blockquote>\"There is no question but that these legislative changes eliminate the requirement that petitioners' [regular] accounts grow at a rate <i>at least equal</i> to the assumed rate <i>annually</i> as promised by the 1975 legislature. Furthermore, by removing the employer Call, these changes eliminate the requirement that after five years, any remaining deficit created by the payment of the guarantee becomes the liability of employers. * * * [Instead], all future deficits will be retired only through earnings on employee accounts. In accordance with these provisions, in 2004, [PERB] distributed zero earnings to petitioners ['] accounts for the 2003 earnings.\"</blockquote>\n<p>Respondents disagree. They argue that ORS 238.255 (2001) did not promise or require that PERB would credit PERS members' regular accounts with a specific amount of earnings each year. Instead, that statute requires only that crediting occur at \"the assumed rate for that year determined by [PERB],\" that PERB had the discretion to change that rate, and that the legislature may (and did in 2003) confine PERB's discretion in setting the assumed rate. Moreover, respondents argue that the 2003 PERS legislation applies to only prospective crediting decisions and that newly enacted ORS 238.258 ensures that members ultimately never will receive a lower service retirement allowance than they would have received if their regular accounts had been credited at the assumed earnings rate each year. Respondents also disagree with petitioners' reading of the former call provision as requiring employers to make up any five-year deficit in the gain-loss reserve. Finally, respondents argue that nothing in the statutes upon which petitioners rely establishes a legislative promise that PERS members are entitled to have credited to their regular <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1091</span> accounts \"any earnings in excess of the assumed rate.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>(3) Discussion</h2>\n<p>Our assessment of the parties' arguments begins with this court's holding in <i>OSPOA</i> that the legislature intended the assumed earnings rate for Tier One members to constitute a promise that extends to work yet to be performed. Specifically, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The state's promise, as material, included employee access to the return rate procedure described in ORS 237.277. Section 11 [of Ballot Measure 8 (1994)] would cancel that obligation after employees partially performed their services. Moreover, section 11 impairs the obligation of contract stated in ORS 237.277, because it would entirely eliminate that obligation with respect to employee contributions to PERS made by current employees for work performed both <i>before</i> and after the effective date of Measure 8. <i>Hughes; Taylor.</i>\"</blockquote>\n<p><i>OSPOA,</i> 323 Or. at 378, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1192606\"><a href=\"/opinion/1192606/oregon-police-officersassn-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">765</span></a></span> (emphasis in original). That holding, however, must be considered in the context of the nature of the impairment of the contractual obligation at issue in that case. There, Measure 8 had presented an all-or-nothing scenario, in <i>eliminating in its entirety</i> the legislative promise that Tier One members would receive annual crediting to their regular accounts in an amount not less than the assumed earnings rate.</p>\n<p>The 2003 PERS legislation, however, does something other than simply eliminate the obligation. Instead, by enacting ORS 238.258  which requires a guaranteed crediting at the applicable assumed earnings rates on a career basis at retirement  the legislature at least acknowledged the promissory nature of the guaranteed rate of return that <i>OSPOA</i> recognized. Accordingly, we are required to interpret the statutory provisions at issue in greater detail than did the court in <i>OSPOA,</i> so as to determine whether the 2003 PERS legislation is consistent with the earlier legislative promise.<sup>[44]</sup></p>\n<p>We address first petitioners' argument that the statutes before the 2003 PERS legislation guaranteed Tier One members not only annual earnings at a rate not less than the assumed earnings rate but also any earnings in excess of the assumed rate, less any allocations necessary for administrative expenses and properly constituted reserves. We find no support for that broad proposition in the wording of the statutes on which petitioners rely.</p>\n<p>ORS 238.255 (2001), for example, addressed directly the circumstance in which a Tier One member's \"regular account is credited with earnings for the previous year in an amount less than the earnings that would have been credited pursuant to the assumed interest rate for that year determined by [PERB].\" In such instances, PERB credited the difference to the member's regular account and charged that amount to the gain-loss reserve. Although that wording supports a legislative promise that Tier One members' regular accounts will grow annually in an amount not less than the assumed earnings rate, that text evinces no support for the proposition that Tier One members contractually are entitled to any <i>overage</i> that is not applied to administrative expenses or reserves.</p>\n<p>Neither does the legislative direction later in that statute that \"[e]arnings in excess of the assumed interest rate for years following the year for which a charge is made to the [gain-loss reserve] shall first be applied to reduce or eliminate the amount of a deficit,\" ORS 238.255 (2001), support petitioners' claim. Although that sentence expressly contemplated the <i>potential</i> for excess earnings, the only command in the statutory wording is that the overage first go toward restoring the gain-loss reserve. Notably absent is any directive that, following such application, PERB <i>must</i> apply any remaining earnings to PERS members' regular accounts.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1092</span> Likewise, ORS 238.670 (2001), which addressed years in which the fund's earnings equaled or exceeded the assumed earnings rate and on which petitioners also rely, did not contain any affirmative promise that PERS members were entitled to a crediting of the overage, less expenses, to their regular accounts. Instead, that statute provided only that, for such years, PERB \"shall set aside, out of interest and other income received * * *, such part of the income as [PERB] may deem advisable, not exceeding seven and one-half percent of the combined total of such income\" to a reserve account. That statute was not a legislative directive that PERB <i>must</i> credit any remaining excess earnings to members' regular accounts. Finally, we have found nothing in the context or history of those statutory provisions that detracts from the conclusion that we have drawn from the text  that is, that the legislature made no such promise respecting excess earnings.<sup>[45]</sup></p>\n<p>The record in these cases establishes that PERB in fact historically has credited PERS members' regular accounts with excess earnings in good investment years. Even so, it is not for this court to codify PERB's practices. Instead, our task is to ascertain those aspects of the PERS statutes that are promissory and, from those provisions, to determine the precise nature of the obligations that they impose. It is those obligations that set the conditions that the legislature may not in the future alter without consequence. That PERB may have been administering the system in a more generous fashion regarding crediting to members' regular accounts than the statutes required does not alter the nature of the promises that the legislature made.</p>\n<p>For the reasons set out above, we conclude that Tier One members had no contractual right under the PERS statutes as they existed before the 2003 PERS legislation to the crediting of annual earnings in excess of the assumed earnings rate to their regular accounts. Instead, we conclude that, for Tier One members, annual crediting at  but not in excess of  the assumed earnings rate is the promise that the legislature extended. Those conclusions, moreover, undermine at least in part petitioners' subsidiary argument, <i>viz.,</i> that the legislature contractually is bound to maintain the system's allocation of the burden of funding reserves and paying administrative expenses. So long as Tier One members' regular accounts are credited annually with earnings that do not fall below the assumed earnings rate, the legislature has reserved for itself the ability to redirect any excess earnings.</p>\n<p>Those conclusions, however, do not address fully petitioners' argument that, by changing the future timing of the crediting process, the 2003 PERS legislation removes (<i>i.e.,</i> impairs) the obligation that Tier One members' regular accounts annually be credited at not less than the assumed earnings rate. In assessing that argument, we begin by comparing the statutory processes for Tier One regular account crediting both before and after the 2003 PERS legislation.</p>\n<p>Before the 2003 PERS legislation, PERB examined the regular accounts of Tier One members annually to determine whether the earnings credited to those accounts fell below the assumed earnings rate. ORS 238.255 (2001). If they did, then PERB would credit the difference to those accounts and charge that difference to the gain-loss reserve. <i>Id.</i> That statute further provided that the gain-loss reserve could not be maintained on a deficit basis for more than five years (the call), and, respecting repayment of the deficit, the statute provided that PERB first must apply future earnings in excess of the assumed earnings rate to reduce or eliminate the deficit. And, as noted earlier in this opinion, the call provisions of the statute never have had to be invoked. Also, before the 2003 PERS legislation, Tier One members received annual statements showing the crediting from the previous year's earnings, and those earnings were never less than the assumed earnings rate.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1093</span> Under the 2003 PERS legislation, however, the crediting system for Tier One members has changed considerably. First, as we have addressed and upheld above, Tier One members no longer are authorized to contribute salary withholdings to their regular accounts. Accordingly, any future growth in those accounts will derive solely from earnings on the members' account balances as of the effective date of the 2003 legislation. Moreover, it no longer is the case that Tier One members' regular accounts necessarily will receive year-by-year annual credits in an amount not less than the assumed earnings rate. For example, if a deficit exists in the gain-loss reserve, then PERB will apply Tier One regular account earnings to the gain-loss reserve in the years following to reduce or eliminate that deficit.<sup>[46]</sup> Moreover, PERB now may not credit any earnings to Tier One members' regular accounts for any year in which to do so would cause a deficit in the gain-loss reserve, and, for any year in which the fund experiences a loss, PERB is required to charge the amount of the loss attributable to Tier One members' regular accounts against the gain-loss reserve. Or. Laws 2003, ch. 67, § 5, <i>as amended by</i> Or. Laws 2003, ch. 625, § 10, <i>codified as</i> ORS 238.255(1) and (2).<sup>[47]</sup></p>\n<p>As described, there can be little doubt but that the 2003 PERS legislation took what was before an <i>unconditional</i> right of Tier One members to have their regular accounts credited in an amount not less than the assumed earnings rate and changed that right to a <i>conditional</i> one. That change, standing alone, would constitute an impairment of a contractual obligation set out in the PERS contract, because it amounts to an alteration of the legislature's promise respecting the crediting of members' regular accounts. <i>See </i><i>Eckles,</i> 306 Or. at 395, 400, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1176322\"><a href=\"/opinion/1176322/eckles-v-state-of-oregon/\"><span class=\"volume\">760</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">846</span></a></span> (explaining gravamen of constitutional violation; contrasting impairment with breach).</p>\n<p>The 2003 PERS legislation, however, added a new statutory provision, ORS 238.258 (quoted above), apparently to meet what otherwise seems a clear impairment of contractual obligation. That provision states that, for purposes of computing the service retirement allowance of a retired Tier One member, the member's minimum regular account balance will be \"the amount that the regular account of a member would have contained if the regular account had been credited with earnings at the assumed interest rate in every year in which the regular account * * * was in existence.\" Or. Laws 2003, ch. 67, § 8(2), <i>as amended by</i> Or. Laws 2003, ch. 625, § 12. Therefore, the validity of petitioners' argument, as well as the validity of that aspect of the 2003 PERS legislation, depends on whether that new provision is consistent with the legislature's earlier guarantee. We conclude that it is not.</p>\n<p>As discussed, the legislature's promise with respect to Tier One members was that those members would receive no less than the assumed earnings rate credited annually to their regular accounts. That statutory promise extends throughout PERS membership. <i>See OSPOA,</i> 323 Or. at 377-78, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1192606\"><a href=\"/opinion/1192606/oregon-police-officersassn-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">765</span></a></span> (constitutional amendment that eliminated assumed earnings rate on contributions to member accounts for work performed both before and after date of adoption impaired contractual obligation set out in <i>former</i> ORS 237.777 (1975)). That part of the 2003 PERS legislation providing for a \"minimum regular account balance,\" Or. Laws 2003, ch. 67, § 8(2), <i>as amended by</i> Or. Laws 2003, ch. 625, § 12, based on the assumed earnings rate over the life of a Tier One member's regular account, is not consistent with the above-described obligation. That is so because Tier One members' regular account balances currently reflect annual earnings credits that often <i>exceeded</i> the assumed earnings rate. Those prior earnings crediting decisions, whether or not they are deemed to have been overly generous in hindsight, are <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1094</span> now final. To the extent that those final crediting decisions are reflected in Tier One members' regular account balances, no less than the assumed earnings rate must be credited annually to those account balances until retirement.</p>\n<p>In creating a new, <i>post hoc,</i> career-crediting process, the 2003 PERS legislation, Or. Laws 2003, ch. 67, § 8, <i>as amended by</i> Or. Laws 2003, ch. 625, § 12, changes that obligation, ultimately resulting in many cases in account balances that will not represent the sum of all earnings that, consistently with the earlier legislative promise, <i>annually</i> have been (and would be) credited to Tier One members' regular accounts. We therefore hold that Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, sections 5 to 8, <i>as amended by</i> Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 625, sections 10 to 12, alter the state's earlier contractual obligation and thereby impair that obligation in violation of Article I, section 21, of the Oregon Constitution.</p>\n<p>Having concluded that that part of the 2003 PERS legislation alters and thereby impairs the state's contractual obligation to credit Tier One members' regular accounts annually in an amount not less than the assumed earnings rate, we proceed to consider the State of Oregon and nonstate respondents' remaining alternative argument and affirmative defense that they advance to avoid the ultimate conclusion that that impairment is constitutionally significant. For the reasons set out below, we conclude that respondents' remaining argument and affirmative defense are not availing under the present circumstances.</p>\n<p>First, respondents argue that, to violate Article I, section 21, of the Oregon Constitution, an impairment of contractual obligation must be \"substantial.\" And, in respondents' view, any impairment resulting from the 2003 PERS legislation is not of that magnitude. Specifically, they argue:</p>\n<blockquote>\"This Court has not directly addressed the question whether the Legislative Assembly may, within the confines of Oregon's Contract Clause, amend or alter an obligation without impairing or breaching a statutory contract. It has implied on several occasions, however, that a lesser modification to a statutory contract may be constitutionally permissible.\"</blockquote>\n<p>For that proposition, respondents rely primarily on the statement in <i>Hughes</i> that, once vested, \"an employee's contractual interest in a pension plan may not be <i>substantially</i> impaired by subsequent legislation.\" 314 Or. at 20, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1155678\"><a href=\"/opinion/1155678/hughes-v-state-of-oregon/\"><span class=\"volume\">838</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1018</span></a></span> (emphasis added). Moreover, respondents argue that other state and federal courts have reached the same conclusion in the context of pension litigation and urge this court to follow suit.</p>\n<p>We agree with respondents that this court has yet to determine whether substantiality of an impairment of a contractual obligation is required to show a violation of Article I, section 21. Further, we have considered thoroughly the well-developed arguments from both sides addressing the issue. However, we conclude that we need not answer that question in this instance. That is so because, assuming without deciding that substantiality is a required element, we deem the impairment to the obligation in the PERS contract respecting the annual assumed earnings rate guarantee to be substantial. We reach that conclusion for two reasons.</p>\n<p>As an initial matter, although the evidence of the impact of the crediting changes to Tier One members' regular accounts was sharply contested before the Special Master, and the Special Master found that the evidence consisted of estimates that were themselves contingent, that data is sufficiently precise to permit this court to find that, for <i>Strunk</i> petitioners as an example, the provisions relating to crediting of Tier One members' regular accounts will result in a reduction of benefits (compared to those that they would have received without the legislation) in amounts varying between approximately 12 and 20 percent per month. Such significant reductions are illustrative of a substantial impairment of the assumed earnings rate guarantee.</p>\n<p>More significantly, we deem the impairment to be substantial for the further reason that the alternative that the legislature provided  career-long crediting at the assumed earnings rate  has a retrospective effect on <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1095</span> earnings accrued for work already performed. That is so because, in providing the career-basis remedy, the 2003 PERS legislation disregards entirely PERB's earlier crediting decisions  decisions that generally were not challenged<sup>[48]</sup>  and effectively replaces the resulting regular account earnings, many of which had exceeded the minimum rate of earnings, with the assumed earnings rate. Absent some legal basis for such a downward adjustment, that legislative choice amounts to nothing more than a unilateral decision to reduce benefits already earned. That, in our view, is a substantial impairment of the contractual obligation respecting the assumed earnings rate guarantee. Accordingly, we reject respondents' argument to the contrary.</p>\n<p>Respondents next argue by way of affirmative defense that, even if the impairment is substantial, a substantial impairment can be justified if reasonable and necessary for an important public purpose. Oregon has not adopted that view. <i>See </i><i>Hughes,</i> 314 Or. at 14 n. 16, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1155678\"><a href=\"/opinion/1155678/hughes-v-state-of-oregon/\"><span class=\"volume\">838</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1018</span></a></span> (\"the application of the rule that a state may not contract away its `police power' under Article I, section 21, of the Oregon Constitution, does not embrace the `balancing' analysis currently employed by the Supreme Court of the United States\").</p>\n<p>The parties introduced voluminous documentary and testimonial evidence concerning the financial status of PERS and the Oregon economy generally in support of and against what the Special Master described as respondents'\"economic hardship defenses.\" That evidence, and specifically the recommended findings that the Special Master derived therefrom, do not convince us that the situation rises to the high threshold that would have to be met for an economic hardship defense  were we to recognize one  to succeed.</p>\n<p>First, we emphasize that we are not dealing here with legislation that impairs private contracts. Instead, we are dealing with a statutory contract. In other words, it is one of the <i>parties</i> to the contract (the state) that now is attempting to rely on a change in circumstances to permit it to alter its contractual obligations in a constitutional manner. In that light, we note that the Special Master made, among others, the following recommended findings:</p>\n<blockquote> \"Oregon's state tax burden currently is approximately .7 percent less than the national average.\"</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \"[T]here is little voter willingness to raise taxes to provide additional government revenues.\"</blockquote>\n<blockquote> The \"capital downturn\" from 2000 through 2002, although causing a greater impact on state tax revenues than previous economic downturns over the past two decades, \"did not compare in magnitude or duration to the Great Depression of the 1930s.\"</blockquote>\n<p>To be sure, the Special Master's report contains other recommended findings that demonstrate that the state's recent fiscal status is both serious and has resulted in substantial detriments to the provision of governmental services across the state. We accept all those findings. Taken together, however, they do not justify a rewriting of the assumed earnings rate guarantee in a manner that would result in the elimination of earnings both promised and actually credited over time to Tier One members' regular accounts. We reject respondents' economic hardship affirmative defense and declare Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, sections 5 to 8, <i>as amended by</i> Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 625, sections 10 to 12, void. <i>See Hughes</i> 314 Or. at 31, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1155678\"><a href=\"/opinion/1155678/hughes-v-state-of-oregon/\"><span class=\"volume\">838</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1018</span></a></span> (law impairing obligation of contract \"is a nullity\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>c.

Or. Laws 1967, ch. 622, § 24, <i>codified as former</i> ORS 237.197 (1967), <i>renumbered as</i> ORS 238.260 (1995). The 2001 version of that statute, which remains substantially unchanged <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1096</span> from the enactment as initially worded, provided, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"A member may elect at any time to have 25, 50 or 75 percent of contributions by the member to the fund on and after the effective date of the election paid into the Variable Annuity Account, credited to a variable account, and reserved for the purchase of a variable annuity. A member who has elected to have a percentage of contributions so paid, credited and reserved may elect at any time thereafter to have an additional 25 or 50 percent of contributions by the member, but not to exceed a maximum of 75 percent, so paid, credited and reserved. An election shall be in writing on a form furnished by [PERB] and be filed with [PERB]. An election shall be effective on January 1 following the filing thereof.\"</blockquote>\n<p>ORS 238.260(3) (2001).<sup>[49]</sup> The 2003 PERS legislation, however, added a new paragraph (b) to ORS 238.260(3), stating that, \"[n]otwithstanding any other provision of this section, a member may not contribute to the Variable Annuity Account after December 31, 2003.\" Or. Laws 2003, ch. 67, § 3.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>(2) The Parties' Arguments</h2>\n<p>All petitioners, except petitioner Sartain, argue that they have a statutory \"right\" to continue directing a percentage of their PERS contributions to equity investments via their variable accounts, and they focus not only on the use of the word \"shall\" in ORS 238.260(3) (2001), but also on the wording \"at any time,\" \"on and after,\" and \"at any time thereafter\" in that provision to support their claim that that right extends to future, rather than to only present, member contributions to PERS. Moreover, petitioners point to the legislative history of the 1967 enactment as support for their claim that the legislature intended, through establishment of the variable annuity account program, \"to allow employees the opportunity to increase their benefits.\"<sup>[50]</sup> As before with respect to the statutory provisions governing PERS members' regular accounts, petitioners argue that, by permitting no further contributions to the variable annuity account program, the 2003 PERS legislation breaches or impairs the PERS contract because the statutory provisions are</p>\n<blockquote>\"unquestionably part of the PERS Act, [are] integral to the calculation of benefits under the Act, [use] unambiguously promissory [wording], [and] contain no language excluding contributions attributable to future service from the general contractual protection and no reservation of [the] right of future amendment.\"</blockquote>\n<p>Respondents likewise advance what in essence repeats their argument concerning PERS members' regular accounts in response to petitioners' variable account claims, <i>viz.,</i> that, because members have no continuing contractual right to make contributions to PERS, they similarly have no right to direct those contributions to variable accounts. Respondents view the wording \"at anytime thereafter\" in ORS 238.260(3) (2001) not as establishing a <i>right</i> to make future contributions but, instead, as allowing a member to change his or her election at any time so long as the variable account remains available as a statutory option. Finally, respondents emphasize that nothing about the 2003 PERS legislation impacts funds held in a member's variable account as of the effective date of that legislation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1097</span> (3) Discussion</h2>\n<p>For many of the same reasons that we concluded that the statutory provisions respecting PERS members' regular accounts are terms of the PERS contract, we likewise conclude, and do so without further discussion, that the variable account provisions are as well. (We do not understand respondents to argue to the contrary.) Accordingly, we proceed to determine the meaning of those statutory contractual terms, specifically, whether they constitute a legislative promise that members would have a right for the duration of their membership in PERS to continue directing contributions to their variable accounts.</p>\n<p>From a textual standpoint, and from petitioners' perspective, the salient wording of ORS 238.260(3) (2001) is the phrase \"at any time,\" which appears two times in that subsection.<sup>[51]</sup> Read in isolation, those broad temporal references could support petitioners' contention that the legislature promised PERS members that they would be permitted to contribute to their variable accounts (as well as to increase their contributions to those accounts) for the duration of their active membership. Ascribing such an intent to the legislature, however, becomes much less supportable when other wording in the statute is considered, particularly the wording that ties a member's right \"at any time\" to contribute to a variable account to the member's \"contributions * * * <i>to the fund.</i>\" (Emphasis added.) Likewise, a member's right to increase his or her variable account election \"at any time thereafter\" is tied to \"<i>contributions by the member</i>\" <i>to the fund.</i> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p>As we have held above, the legislature did not promise members that they could <i>continue making contributions to the fund</i> throughout their membership in PERS. And, because we have upheld the legislature's 2003 decision to prohibit members from <i>further</i> contributing to the fund (and, instead, to direct member contributions to the IAP), there no longer will be fund contributions from which a percentage could be directed to a variable account. As we view the entirety of the wording of ORS 238.260(3) (2001), then, that wording does not support petitioners' claim of a promise of a continued right to invest in the variable annuity account program. Instead, at most, such a right of contribution exists only so long as members are permitted to contribute to the fund.</p>\n<p>We do, however, perceive from that wording a different legislative promise respecting the variable annuity account program that extends throughout membership in PERS. That is, for any member \"who has elected to have a percentage of contributions so paid,\" once PERB has credited those monies to the member's variable account, those contributions will be \"<i>reserved</i> for the purchase of a variable annuity.\" ORS 238.260(3) (2001) (emphasis added). Stated differently, although the wording of the statute does not support a continued right to contribute to the variable annuity account program, the wording does evince a legislative promise to reserve until the time of retirement any monies that a member has invested in the variable annuity account program for the purchase of a variable annuity.</p>\n<p>Turning next to context, we find little to support or detract from the preliminary observations that we have gleaned from the words of ORS 238.260(3) (2001). Again, we deem the actions of the 1981 Legislative Assembly to be the focal point for our analysis, because it was that body that fundamentally restructured the system to provide for the Full Formula benefit. Consistently with the comprehensive nature of the 1981 legislation, the legislature also added a provision to <i>former</i> ORS 237.197 (1979), <i>renumbered as</i> 238.260(12) (1995), to account for those members who had made contributions to the variable annuity account program or who had made contributions on salary in excess of $4,800 per year between 1956 and 1967. Or. Laws 1981, ch. 761, § 6. For such members, the legislature directed PERB to determine <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1098</span> the difference between each member's total account balance and what that total would have been had the member either not participated in the variable annuity account program, not made excess contributions, or both. <i>Id.</i> The value of the difference, whether positive or negative, then resulted in either an increase or a decrease to the member's monthly service retirement allowance.</p>\n<p>Through that amendment to what is now ORS 238.260(12), the 1981 Legislative Assembly not only preserved the excess contributions that some members had made before 1967 and contributions to the variable annuity account program between 1967 and 1981, but also permitted the variable annuity account program to remain as a meaningful part of the system. (Otherwise, absent the Money Match or the Pension Plus Annuity yielding a higher pension component, increases or decreases to a member's variable account would serve only to increase or decrease the amount that an employer would have to pay to fund the pension component of the member's service retirement allowance under the Full Formula.) What that limited contextual evidence does not suggest, however, is that the legislature promised members that they would have the ability to contribute to their variable accounts throughout their membership in PERS. That amendment, instead, concerned only the effect that a variable account could have on the service retirement allowance that a member ultimately would receive at retirement.<sup>[52]</sup></p>\n<p>In light of the foregoing discussion, we conclude that there is nothing inconsistent between the earlier promise that the legislature made with respect to the variable annuity account program  that any funds placed into variable accounts would be reserved for the purchase of a variable annuity  and the 2003 Legislative Assembly's decision to discontinue permitting PERS members to contribute to their variable accounts. Consequently, there can be no breach or impairment of the obligations set out in the PERS contract in that respect.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>d. Cost-of-Living Adjustments (COLAs)</h2>\n<p>As briefly explained earlier, both before and after the 2003 PERS legislation, ORS 238.360 (2001) required (and still requires) PERB to determine and apply annual COLAs, based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI), to retired PERS members' service retirement allowances. However, parts of the 2003 PERS legislation effectively suspend COLAs on particular service retirement allowances, until specified financial conditions are met, for certain retired Tier One members. The legislature took that step in response to a trial court ruling in the <i>City of Eugene</i> litigation, described below. <i>Strunk</i> and <i>Sartain</i> petitioners argue that that part of the 2003 legislation constitutes either an impairment or a breach of the statutory PERS contract. We address those contentions below, beginning with a discussion of the <i>City of Eugene</i> litigation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>(1) Background</h2>\n<p>As discussed earlier in this opinion, the PERS statutes provide for the maintenance of various reserve accounts. Most significant to the <i>City of Eugene</i> litigation are the contingency reserve and the gain-loss reserve.</p>\n<p>ORS 238.670(1) describes the parameters of the contingency reserve, providing that PERB \"shall set aside\" as much interest and other income received through investment as PERB \"may deem advisable, not exceeding seven and one-half percent of the combined total of such income[,]\" for the purpose of maintaining a contingency reserve to \"prevent any deficit of money available for the payment of retirement allowances, due to interest fluctuations, changes in mortality rate or * * * other contingency.\" ORS 238.670(1). PERB has not funded a contingency reserve since 1979.</p>\n<p>ORS 238.255 (2001) (now ORS 238.255(1)) describes the parameters of the \"gain-loss reserve,\" to which PERB is required to charge certain amounts. With respect to the gain-loss reserve, the Special Master found:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1099</span> \"Before the enactment of the 2003 [PERS] legislation, PER[B] maintained a `gain-loss reserve' in which it set aside a portion of annual fund earnings to ensure that sufficient assets would be available to pay guaranteed benefits at the assumed earnings rate. In years when fund earnings exceeded the guaranteed amount, PERB deposited a portion of those funds into the gain-loss reserve. The evidence showed that it is reasonable to fund the gain-loss reserve at a level that would fund projected Tier One guaranteed earnings credits for a 30-month period, which, using the current assumed earnings rate of 8 percent, would set the reserve balance at 20 percent of the fund's value.\"</blockquote>\n<p>As to PERB's treatment of the gain-loss reserve and the contingency reserve in the late 1990s, the Special Master found as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"In 1999, the fund earned approximately $7.5 billion, or 24.89 percent of its value. [PERB credited 20 percent to Tier One regular accounts for that year.] PERB allocated approximately $1.3 billion to the gain-loss reserve, which left it funded at approximately 72 percent of [its] new 30-month goal. After PERB allocated 1999 earnings, the gain-loss reserve had a positive balance of $4.744 billion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"If PERB had fully funded the contingency reserve for 1999 by crediting 7.5 percent of the fund's earnings as authorized by ORS 238.670(1) and, if PERB had fully funded the gain-loss reserve according to its 30-month goal, approximately 11.33 percent would have been available for crediting to Tier One accounts.\"<sup>[53]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>The funding gap created by PERB's choice not to fund the two accounts fully, as the Special Master described it, meant that an imbalance existed that PERB sought to make up through assessments  <i>i.e.,</i> contribution rate orders  on employers. In response to those assessments, three local government employers, including the City of Eugene, challenged their 1998 and 2000 contribution rate orders by filing an action against PERB in Marion County Circuit Court. Several employers also challenged PERB's order allocating 1999 earnings. In part, the employers argued that their contribution rates would have been lower if PERB properly had funded the contingency and gain-loss reserves. All the challenges were consolidated and became the <i>City of Eugene</i> litigation. Several PERS members intervened in the litigation to defend PERB's crediting decisions respecting their regular accounts.</p>\n<p>In July 2001, the trial court held that PERB had abused its discretion by not funding the contingency reserve since 1979. The court further held that PERB had abused its discretion by crediting 20 percent interest to Tier One members' regular accounts in 1999, instead of properly funding the contingency and gain-loss reserves. The court remanded the challenged rate orders to PERB with instructions that PERB issue new rate orders consistently with the court's judgment. PERB and intervenors appealed that judgment to the Court of Appeals, which transferred the litigation to this court pursuant to Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 537, section 1, where it is now pending.</p>\n<p>Pursuant to the trial court's judgment, the Fiscal Services Division (FSD) of PERS recalculated the credits to Tier One members' regular accounts for 1999 and concluded that, if PERB properly had funded the contingency and gain-loss reserves in 1999, the appropriate credit to members' regular accounts for that year would have been 11.33 percent. Before FSD presented that figure to PERB for final approval, however, the legislature requested that information directly from FSD. The legislature subsequently enacted the 2003 PERS legislation; in Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, sections 9 and 10, <i>as amended by</i> Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 625, section 13, the Legislature effectively codifies the 11.33 percent figure as the correct 1999 crediting decision.<sup>[54]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1100</span> After the legislature enacted Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, PERB and the employer parties entered into a settlement agreement purporting to resolve the <i>City of Eugene</i> litigation. That settlement agreement provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[E]xcept in the event of a supervening change in law (such as by a legislative enactment or further court order):</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"1.3 The new 1999 earnings allocation order * * * will provide that the appropriate earnings allocation to Tier [One] regular member accounts is 11.33 [percent], that 7.5 [percent] of the 1999 earnings should have been allocated to the contingency reserve established by ORS 238.670(1), and that the gain-loss reserve created by ORS 238.670(3) should have been funded to the full extent of the former PERB's policy to maintain a gain-loss reserve sufficient to credit the assumed interest rate to Tier [One] regular member accounts during a period of 30 months of 0 [percent] earnings.\"</blockquote>\n<p>After entering into that settlement agreement, PERB moved to dismiss the appeal, but intervenors opposed that motion, and this court denied it without prejudice. As a result of the court challenges to PERB's 1999 crediting decision, that decision was potentially subject to reversal at the time that the legislature enacted Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, sections 9 and 10, <i>as amended by</i> Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 625, section 13.</p>\n<p>Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, sections 9 and 10, <i>as amended by</i> Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 625, section 13, apply to only Tier One members who receive service retirement allowances pursuant to the Money Match and who retired on or after April 1, 2000, but before April 1, 2004. As pertinent here, section 10, <i>as amended by</i> Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 625, section 13, requires PERB to recalculate two alternative service retirement allowances for those members, resulting in a \"revised\" allowance and a \"fixed\" allowance.</p>\n<p>To calculate the \"revised\" service retirement allowance, PERB first must recalculate the affected members' regular account balances as if 11.33 percent, rather than 20 percent, had been credited in 1999. PERB then must recalculate the members' service retirement allowances based on those newly calculated account balances and apply the appropriate COLAs for each calendar year since each member's retirement to the newly calculated service retirement allowance. As a result of those calculations, PERB will have determined a new service retirement allowance for each affected member as of the date of the calculation, based on an 11.33 percent credit to each member's regular account in 1999 (<i>i.e.,</i> the \"revised\" service retirement allowance). Or. Laws 2003, ch. 67, § 10(2), <i>as amended by</i> Or. Laws 2003, ch. 625, § 13. PERB thereafter is required to apply annual COLAs on members'\"revised\" service retirement allowances. Or. Laws 2003, ch. 67, § 10(2)(d).</p>\n<p>To calculate the \"fixed\" service retirement allowance, PERB must determine the amount payable to each affected member on July 1, 2003, or on the member's retirement date, whichever is later. The resulting \"fixed\" service retirement allowance may not be adjusted by annual application of a COLA. Or. Laws 2003, ch. 67, § 10(3), <i>as amended by</i> Or. Laws 2003, ch. 625, § 13.<sup>[55]</sup></p>\n<p>Finally, Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, section 10(4), <i>as amended by</i> Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 625, section 13, requires that each affected member be paid the greater of the newly calculated \"revised\" and \"fixed\" service retirement allowances. Stated differently, if an affected member's \"fixed\" service retirement allowance (which is based on a 20 percent credit in 1999, but is <i>not</i> subject to an annual COLA) exceeds that member's periodically determined \"revised\" service retirement allowance (which is based on an 11.33 percent credit in 1999 and <i>is</i> subject to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1101</span> an annual COLA), then that member will not receive annual COLAs until such time as the \"revised\" allowance exceeds the \"fixed\" allowance. From that point forward, the member will receive annual COLAs on the \"revised\" service retirement allowance.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>(2) The Parties' Arguments</h2>\n<p><i>Strunk</i> and <i>Sartain</i> petitioners argue that Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, sections 9 and 10, <i>as amended by</i> Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 625, section 13, breach the PERS statutory contract and impair contractual obligations in violation of Article I, section 21. They particularly argue, as pertinent here, that ORS 238.360 (2001), which required PERB to provide retired members with annual COLAs on their monthly service retirement allowances, is a term of the PERS contract. ORS 238.360 (2001) provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote>\"(1) As soon as practicable after January 1 each year, [PERB] shall determine the percentage increase or decrease in the cost-of-living for the previous calendar year, based on the Consumer Price Index * * *. Prior to July 1 each year the allowance which the member or the member's beneficiary is receiving or is entitled to receive on August 1 for the month of July shall be multiplied by the percentage figure determined, and the allowance for the next 12 months beginning July 1 adjusted to the resultant amount.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(2) Such increase or decrease shall not exceed two percent of any monthly retirement allowance in any year and no allowance shall be adjusted to an amount less than the amount to which the recipient would be entitled if no cost-of-living adjustment were authorized.\"</blockquote>\n<p><i>Strunk</i> and <i>Sartain</i> petitioners argue that, contrary to Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, section 10(3), <i>as amended by</i> Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 625, section 13, which calculates a \"fixed\" service retirement allowance that is not subject to an annual COLA, ORS 238.360(1) (2001) required PERB to provide COLAs on <i>all</i> service retirement allowances. In other words, <i>Strunk</i> and <i>Sartain</i> petitioners assert that affected Tier One members who are receiving \"fixed\" service retirement allowances under the 2003 PERS legislation have a contractual right to receive annual COLAs on those allowances, even though the allowances were based on a regular account balance that, in the legislature's determination, included an erroneous 20 percent credit in 1999. They argue that, when a member has performed fully under the PERS contract in reliance on the promise set out in ORS 238.360(1) (2001), that member's rights have vested and the legislature may not take away COLAs without breaching the PERS contract or unconstitutionally impairing an obligation of that contract.</p>\n<p>Respondents acknowledge that the affected Tier One members have performed fully and are entitled to receive service retirement allowances that are calculated based on amounts <i>properly</i> credited to their regular accounts. They argue, however, that petitioners seek more than that. Petitioners, respondents claim, are asserting that they have a contractual right to receive service retirement allowances that reflect an <i>improper</i> credit of 20 percent in 1999. The PERS statutes, respondents argue, do not grant petitioners the right to <i>erroneously</i> credited earnings. In fact, they assert, another statute  ORS 238.715 (which we discuss in greater detail below)  authorizes PERB to recover the over-credited amounts from petitioners, even though they are retired.</p>\n<p>Respondents also observe that, in addition to setting out specific avenues for recouping overpayments, ORS 238.715(8) allows PERB to use \"any other remedies that may be available to [it] for recovery of amounts incorrectly paid from the fund[.]\"<sup>[56]</sup> Respondents argue that, in enacting Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, section 10, <i>as amended by</i> Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 625, section 13, the legislature has provided PERB with \"other remedies\" for recouping the erroneously credited earnings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1102</span> (3) Discussion</h2>\n<p>Before turning to our analysis of petitioners' claims, we think it helpful to clarify the precise nature of our inquiry here. First, no party appears to dispute that, in creating the \"fixed\" service retirement allowance coupled with the suspension of an annual COLA, the legislature's intent was to recoup what it deemed to be overpayments to the affected members' regular accounts in 1999.<sup>[57]</sup> Second, as discussed below, respondents note that the PERS statutes contemplate that PERB erroneously might pay certain amounts to a member who already has retired and that PERB generally is permitted, as a statutory matter, to recoup erroneous payments. And, third, as respondents appear to suggest, <i>Strunk</i> and <i>Sartain</i> petitioners' <i>particular</i> contractual challenges to the COLA suspension in Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, section 10(3), in essence raise the question whether the legislature's choice <i>to preclude application of annual COLAs on fixed retirement allowances</i> was a permissible method of facilitating such a recoupment. Stated differently, by directing PERB to suspend annual COLAs on fixed retirement allowances, does the 2003 PERS legislation either impair or breach PERB's obligation to apply annual COLAs under ORS 238.360 (2001)?</p>\n<p>As with our analysis of the foregoing challenged aspects of the 2003 PERS legislation, we first determine whether ORS 238.360 constituted a term of the PERS statutory contract before the enactment of the 2003 legislation. ORS 238.360 (2001) provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote>\"(1) As soon as practicable after January 1 each year, <i>[PERB] shall determine the percentage increase or decrease in the cost of living for the previous calendar year,</i> based on the Consumer Price Index * * *. Prior to July 1 each year <i>the allowance which the member or the member's beneficiary is receiving or is entitled to receive</i> on August 1 for the month of July <i>shall be multiplied by the percentage figure determined, and the allowance for the next 12 months beginning July 1 adjusted to the resultant amount.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(2) Such increase or decrease shall not exceed two percent of any monthly retirement allowance in any year and no allowance shall be adjusted to an amount less than the amount to which the recipient would be entitled if no cost of living adjustment were authorized.\"</blockquote>\n<p>(Emphasis added.) The legislature enacted that statute in 1971, and its substance has remained unchanged, notwithstanding other interim amendments. <i>See former</i> ORS 237.060(1) (1971), <i>renumbered as</i> ORS 238.360 (1995) (setting out original statute).</p>\n<p>ORS 238.360(1), as it existed in 2001 and as presently worded, provides that PERS members' monthly service retirement allowances annually shall be adjusted to reflect \"the percentage increase or decrease in the cost of living for the previous calendar year[.]\" Like the tax provision analyzed in <i>Hughes,</i> the text of ORS 238.360(1) (2001) evinces a clear legislative intent to provide retired members with annual COLAs on their service retirement allowances, whenever the CPI warrants such COLAs. We therefore conclude that the general promise embodied in ORS 238.360(1) (2001) was part of the statutory PERS contract applicable to the group of retired members affected by the 2003 provisions at issue here. Having so concluded, we now must determine the extent of that promise.</p>\n<p>We return to the wording of the statute and, specifically, the requirement that, prior to July 1 each year, \"the <i>allowance</i> which the member or the member's beneficiary <i>is receiving or is entitled to receive</i>\" on August 1 for the month of July must be subject to a COLA. ORS 238.360(1) (2001) (emphasis added). The context of ORS 238.360(1) (2001), which includes other related statutes, <i>PGE,</i> 317 Or. at 611, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2613226\"><a href=\"/opinion/2613226/pge-v-bureau-of-labor-and-industries/\"><span class=\"volume\">859</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1143</span></a></span>, assists our reading of the emphasized wording. As noted earlier, ORS 238.715 (2001) provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote>\"(1) <i>If [PERB] determines that a member</i> of the system or any other person receiving a monthly payment from the * * * [f]und <i>has received any amount in</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1103</span> <i>excess of the amounts that the member or other person is entitled to under this chapter,</i> [PERB] may recover the overpayment or other improperly made payment by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(a) Reducing the monthly payment to the member or other person for as many months as may be determined by [PERB] to be necessary to recover the overpayment or other improperly made payment; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(b) Reducing the monthly payment to the member or other person by an amount actuarially determined to be adequate to recover the overpayment or other improperly made payment during the period during which the monthly payment will be made to the member or other person.\"</blockquote>\n<p>(Emphasis added.) As is apparent from the text of ORS 238.715(1) (2001), the legislature has anticipated that PERB might pay amounts from the fund in error-that is, a member (or other person, such as a beneficiary) might be paid more from the fund than that member is \"entitled\" to \"receive[ ]\" under the PERS statutes. And, in the event that such an overpayment occurs, the legislature further has provided that PERB may recover that overpayment.</p>\n<p>In light of the identical wording in ORS 238.360 (2001) and ORS 238.715(1) (2001), regarding allowances that a member is \"entitled to receive\" and amounts \"received\" that exceed those to which a member is \"entitled,\" we conclude that the promise set out in ORS 238.360(1) (2001) respecting the application of annual COLAs does not extend to erroneous overpayments included in a member's service retirement allowance that the member was not entitled to receive. However, the promise does extend to properly calculated service retirement allowances.</p>\n<p>Having defined the scope of the legislature's promise, we turn to the 2003 PERS legislation to determine whether  and, if so, to what extent  it is inconsistent with that promise. As explained earlier, Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, section 10, <i>as amended by</i> Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 625, section 13, provides that the original service retirement allowance for each retired Tier One member who is affected by that section shall be recalculated in two ways, resulting in a \"revised\" service retirement allowance and an alternative \"fixed\" service retirement allowance. As also noted above, the \"revised\" service retirement allowance continues to be subject to an annual COLA under ORS 238.360(1). The \"fixed\" service retirement allowance is set at the amount that was payable to the retired member as of July 1, 2003, or as of the member's retirement date, whichever is later, and is not subject to an annual COLA under ORS 238.360(1). The crux of the question before us, then, is whether the \"fixed\" service retirement allowance calculated under Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, section 10(3), <i>as amended by</i> Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 625, section 13, either does or does not qualify as an allowance that is subject to an annual COLA under ORS 238.360(1) (2001). Stated more specifically, does the \"fixed\" service retirement allowance represent payment of an \"allowance\" that the member was not \"entitled to receive?\"</p>\n<p>The answer to that question is no. It is true that the legislature's apparent intent in creating the \"fixed\" service retirement allowance  most notably, when coupled with elimination of any otherwise applicable COLA  was to allow PERB to recoup certain amounts credited to the affected members' accounts in 1999 (and which the 2003 Legislative Assembly deemed to be overpayments). However, the \"fixed\" service retirement allowance <i>itself</i> represents a <i>determined allowance</i>  that is, an allowance expressly determined by the legislature. In light of that legislative determination, the \"fixed\" service retirement allowance cannot be said to transfer to the affected member any funds to which the member (again, in the legislature's determination) was not entitled. As such, the \"fixed\" service retirement allowance falls within the scope of the promise set out in ORS 238.360(1) (2001)  that is, that PERB annually apply a COLA to each affected member's allowance (in years in which the CPI warrants such a COLA)-because the allowance represents funds that the member, by legislative determination, is \"entitled to receive.\"</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1104</span> We therefore conclude that the elimination of annual COLAs from the \"fixed\" service retirement allowance, as set out in Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, section 10(3), is inconsistent with the legislature's promise set out in ORS 238.360(1) (2001). Having done so, we next must determine whether that inconsistency amounts to a breach or an impairment of that obligation under the PERS contract. As to that question, this court's decision in <i>Eckles,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1176322\"><a href=\"/opinion/1176322/eckles-v-state-of-oregon/\"><span class=\"volume\">306</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Or.</span> <span class=\"page\">380</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1176322\"><a href=\"/opinion/1176322/eckles-v-state-of-oregon/\"><span class=\"volume\">760</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">846</span></a></span>, is instructive.</p>\n<p>As explained earlier, <i>Eckles</i> involved legislation that had transferred surplus funds from the IAF  which, by statute, were to be used for only workers' compensation purposes  to the General Fund. There, as here, the legislature's intent in transferring the funds had been to attain a legislative goal that, generally speaking, appeared legitimate and was not in dispute (in <i>Eckles,</i> avoiding a state budget deficit). However, it was the legislature's method for attaining that goal that, in the court's determination in <i>Eckles,</i> had contractual implications for the state. Specifically, the court concluded that the part of the legislation that had <i>eliminated</i> the state's obligation to use IAF funds in the statutorily specified manner constituted an unconstitutional impairment of the state's contractual obligation. 306 Or. at 399, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1176322\"><a href=\"/opinion/1176322/eckles-v-state-of-oregon/\"><span class=\"volume\">760</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">846</span></a></span>. The court further concluded that the part of the legislation that had directed the transfer of funds <i>amounted to a mandate that the state breach the contract. Id.</i> at 400, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1176322\"><a href=\"/opinion/1176322/eckles-v-state-of-oregon/\"><span class=\"volume\">760</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">846</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>Applying <i>Eckles</i> to the statutory contractual issue before us now, it is indisputable that the promise set out in ORS 238.360(1) (2001) respecting annual COLAs remains part of the PERS statutory scheme applicable to the affected group of retired members. However, by precluding application of annual COLAs to \"fixed\" service retirement allowances determined for those affected members, Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, section 10(3), amounts to a directive from the legislature to PERB to breach the promise set out in ORS 238.360(1) (2001) with respect to those members. We conclude, as petitioners contend, that that aspect of the 2003 PERS legislation breaches a term of the PERS contract. <i>See </i><i>Eckles,</i> 306 Or. at 400-02, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1176322\"><a href=\"/opinion/1176322/eckles-v-state-of-oregon/\"><span class=\"volume\">760</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">846</span></a></span> (so explaining in similar circumstances); <i>see also </i><i>Hughes,</i> 314 Or. at 32-33, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1155678\"><a href=\"/opinion/1155678/hughes-v-state-of-oregon/\"><span class=\"volume\">838</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1018</span></a></span> (same).<sup>[58]</sup></p>\n<p>Having so concluded, we now must address as a final matter the disposition of petitioners' claims for relief respecting the above-described COLA provisions of the 2003 PERS legislation. As explained, Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, section 10(3), breaches the PERS contract by directing PERB not to provide annual COLAs on \"fixed\" service retirement allowances. Normally, this court leaves to the legislature, as the \"most appropriate branch of government in the first instance,\" <i>Hughes,</i> 314 Or. at 33 n. 36, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1155678\"><a href=\"/opinion/1155678/hughes-v-state-of-oregon/\"><span class=\"volume\">838</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1018</span></a></span>, the choice as to which remedy to select when legislation breaches a statutory contract. Here, however, under what we deem to be unique circumstances, we conclude that the prudent dispositional action is to invalidate the offending statutory wording. Accordingly, we declare that part of Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, section 10(3), that provides, \"[t]he fixed service retirement allowance may not be adjusted under ORS 238.360,\" to be void. The effect of our choice to declare that part of the law to be void is that petitioners will be returned  at least for the time being  to the same position in which they would have been if the legislature had not enacted the COLA suspension.<sup>[59]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1105</span> e. Actuarial Equivalency Factors</h2>\n<p>As noted earlier in this opinion and as explained more fully below, part of the 2003 PERS legislation modifies the calculation of service retirement allowances for certain PERS members who entered the system before 1999, by adopting new actuarial equivalency factors (AEFs). All petitioners challenge that part of the legislation, as discussed below.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>(1) Background</h2>\n<p>We take the following description of PERB's approach toward AEFs from the Special Master's report:</p>\n<blockquote>\"From time to time, after consulting with its actuary,[<sup>[60]</sup>] PERB has adopted AEFs for use in the administration of the fund. AEFs are based on assumptions concerning the future earnings of the fund and members' expected mortality rates. AEFs are used to convert lump sum account balances to monthly payment streams and to change one optional benefit payment form to another. When converting a lump sum to a monthly benefit, the lump sum and the monthly benefit payments are actuarially equivalent if both forms of payment have the same present value. Two of the three types of PERS retirement benefits  Money Match and Pension Plus Annuity  are calculated based on AEFs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"Before 1978, PERB used a substantial number of AEF tables that applied to particular categories of members. In 1978, PERB adopted two simplified sets of actuarial tables, one each for male and female members. The tables for female members produced a lower monthly retirement allowance, because they assumed that females would, on average, have longer life spans after retirement than males.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"In <i>Henderson v. State,</i> U.S. District Court Case No. CV74-538, the court concluded that the use of separate gender-based calculations was unlawful. [[<sup>[61]</sup>] In 1978, PERB adopted the male-only actuarial factors for all PERS members. That process commonly was referred to as `topping up' the AEF tables. The topped-up tables increased employer contribution rates by 0.49 percent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"In 1978, PERB adopted a 7 percent assumed earnings rate for the fund. In 1979, PERB increased the assumed earnings rate to 7.5 percent. However, it did not change the system's AEFs because (1) the actuary determined that members generally were living longer after retirement; and (2) new actuarial factors would have blended assumed male and female mortality rates and, therefore, would have been lower than those produced by the use of male-only tables. PERB did not change its AEFs again until 1989.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"When PERB increased the assumed earnings rate to 8 percent in 1989, it also adopted revised mortality tables. The revised AEFs were a combination of the pre-existing 7 percent earnings and 1978 male-only mortality assumptions, and new 8 percent earnings and 1989 blended male/female mortality assumptions. PERB used the new factors only if they increased member benefits; otherwise, PERB used the preexisting factors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"In 1993, PERB adopted [<i>former</i>] OAR 459-05-055 [(1993)]. That rule provided that [the] PER[S] actuary would perform an actuarial equivalency study every two years. The rule required the actuary to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1106</span> `recommend to [PERB] assumptions, factors and the rationale for any recommended changes to the actuarial tables used by [PERS].' [<i>Former</i>] OAR 459-05-055(1)(b) (1993) [, <i>renumbered as</i> OAR XXX-XXX-XXXX (1996)]. Subsection (2) of the rule provided, in part:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"`(b) All changes to the System's annuity tables shall be prospective only for allowances effective on or after the effective date of the change;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"`(c) If the consulting actuary's recommendation to change a factor would produce a lower benefit, [PERB] will not change the current factor.'</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"In the 1995 actuarial study, the actuary reported that continuing improvement in mortality rates would justify an adjustment of the system's AEFs, but he opined that [<i>former</i>] OAR [XXX-XX-XXX (1993)] * * * foreclosed the adoption of factors that would reduce member benefits. The actuary asked PERB to review the rule because mortality rates were expected to continue to improve, and the use of the existing AEFs was a significant cost consideration.\"</blockquote>\n<p>(Footnote omitted.) The actuary also explained in a July 1995 letter to PERB that the factors that PERB intended to adopt pursuant to <i>former</i> OAR 459-05-055 (1993) would not serve to achieve \"`true actuarial equivalenc[y]' because of the grandfathering of higher benefit factors over the years[.]\"</p>\n<p>In 1996, PERB both renumbered and amended <i>former</i> OAR 459-05-055 (1993) (set out in part above) to provide that AEFs would be updated for only members who joined PERS after January 1, 1999. The new rule, renumbered as OAR XXX-XXX-XXXX (1996), provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote>\"(4) * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(b) All changes to the System's actuarial equivalency factors shall be prospective only for that portion of an allowance attributable to service as an active member beginning on or after the effective date of the change.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(5) Notwithstanding subsection (4)(b) of this rule, for members who established membership in PERS before January 1, 1999, as described in Oregon Laws 1995, Chapter 654, Section 2, [PERB] shall not change a factor that would produce a lower periodic or single benefit payment, and any change of factor(s) shall apply to the total allowance payable.\"</blockquote>\n<p>PERB had promulgated that rule in response to legal advice that it had received regarding maintaining the fund's status as a qualified governmental retirement plan and trust under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC).<sup>[62]</sup></p>\n<p>The Special Master's report explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\"In 2001, PERB again reviewed the AEFs for the system. At that time, PERB adopted a policy of using factors based on current mortality assumptions if the factors adequately protected benefits previously earned under former AEFs. PERB reviewed various options for protecting accrued benefits, but it had not completed that process when it became apparent that the 2003 legislature intended to enact legislation on the same subject.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"In sum, before the 2003 legislation was enacted, PERB generally used AEFs that had been in effect since 1978 and that did not match the assumptions that the actuary used to value the system and make projections about system costs. Those factors understated the life expectancy of PERS members. When they were used to convert a member's account balance to a monthly allowance, the aggregate value of the monthly allowance was higher than the value of the account balance. Therefore, unless additional funds were contributed to the system, the account balance would have dissipated before the member's average life expectancy was reached. Put another way, because the AEFs did not match the actuary's life expectancy assumptions for the system, the amount <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1107</span> available to pay the BIF [<sup>[63]</sup>] upon a member's retirement was, other things being equal, insufficient to cover the projected costs for that member. PERS then had to `true up' the BIF by transferring additional amounts from employer accounts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"In 1995, the actuary estimated that the continued use of a `grand [ ]fathered' approach to changes in AEFs cost the system approximately 0.5 percent of payroll per year. As more members retired under the Money Match and the amount of their benefits increased, the financial impact of using outdated factors also grew. In 2002, the actuary estimated that the immediate use of updated mortality tables would decrease employer contribution rates by approximately 2.28 percent of payroll.\"</blockquote>\n<p>(Footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p>Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 68, section 2, requires PERB to adopt current actuarial equivalency factor tables that \"use the best actuarial information on mortality available at the time [PERB] adopts the tables[.]\" Those tables become effective on January 1 of the calendar year following PERB's adoption of the new tables. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Further, Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 68, section 4, <i>as amended by</i> Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, section 40, and Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 625, section 16, modifies the calculation for the annuity components of the service retirement allowances for certain members who entered the system before 1999. Specifically, such members who retired (or will retire) on or after July 1, 2003, will have their annuity components calculated under the new legislation, which directs PERB to use one of two calculations, whichever produces the greater benefit. The first requires application of the AEFs in effect as of the member's effective retirement date to the retiring member's account balances on that date; the second creates an account balance as of June 30, 2003, that consists of only the member's contributions and earnings credited as of that date, and PERB then determines the member's annuity component from that balance using the AEFs in effect on June 30, 2003. That second calculation generally is referred to as the \"look-back\" provision.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>(2) The Parties' Arguments</h2>\n<p>All petitioners, except petitioner Sartain, challenge Oregon Laws, chapter 68, section 4, <i>as amended by</i> Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, section 40, and Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 625, section 16, which requires PERB to adopt updated AEFs and, beginning July 1, 2003, to apply those AEFs when calculating certain retired PERS members' annuity components. They rely primarily on OAR XXX-XXX-XXXX(5) (1996), which, as quoted above, provided:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Notwithstanding subsection (4)(b) of this rule,[<sup>[64]</sup>] for members who established membership in PERS before January 1, 1999, as described in Oregon Laws 1995, Chapter 654, Section 2, [PERB] shall not change a factor that would produce a lower periodic or single benefit payment, and any change of factor(s) shall apply to the total allowance payable.\"</blockquote>\n<p>They assert that, because PERB is the trustee of the fund and has been granted authority to adopt rules governing administration of the fund, the foregoing rule is a term of the PERS statutory contract. As such, they argue that the legislature may not remove that term by requiring PERB to calculate annuity components using updated AEFs, the likely effect of which will be to reduce their service retirement allowances.</p>\n<p>As support for that contention, petitioners argue that ORS 238.630(3)(g) (2001), a predecessor version of which is discussed further below, gave PERB \"the absolute authority\" to establish the system's actuarial factors (specifically, those in effect since 1978) and required that such factors \"shall constitute part of the system.\" They further argue <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1108</span> that ORS 238.650(2) (2001), which provided that \"[a]ll rules adopted by [PERB] become part of the written plan document of [PERS],\" reinforces their contractual right to enforce the terms of OAR XXX-XXX-XXXX(5) (1996). Because Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 68, section 4, <i>as amended by</i> Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, section 40, and Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 625, section 16, nullifies the effect of that rule, petitioners argue, it breaches the PERS contract and impairs obligations of the contract.</p>\n<p>Petitioner Dahlin presents the same argument, but adds a \"federal law\" analysis premised on his observation that PERB must maintain the fund's tax status under the IRC. His analysis is designed to illustrate that the incorporation of updated AEFs will violate provisions of the IRC, jeopardize the fund's tax status, and therefore violate petitioners' contractual rights.</p>\n<p>For their part, respondents first observe that the PERS statutes require AEFs to yield service retirement allowances that are the \"`actuarial equivalent' of members' account balances.\" Yet petitioners, in respondents' view, assert a contractual right to the use of outdated factors that, by definition, cannot produce actuarial equivalency. To support that argument, respondents cite ORS 238.630(3)(g) (2001), which required PERB to adopt new AEFs from \"time to time\" that, once applied, will calculate the \"actuarial equivalen[t] of optional forms of retirement allowances,\" and ORS 238.300(1) (2001), which required (and still requires) \"actuarial equivalen[cy]\" in converting each member's account balances at retirement into the annuity component of the member's service retirement allowance.</p>\n<p>Respondents further dismiss the validity of OAR XXX-XXX-XXXX(5) (1996) by observing that that rule departs from the aforementioned legislative mandates. Finally, respondents observe that the 2003 \"look-back\" calculation preserves the service retirement allowances that members would have received had PERB calculated their annuity components using the factors and account balances in place the day before the 2003 PERS legislation went into effect. Thus, they argue, Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 68, section 4, <i>as amended by</i> Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, section 40, and Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 625, section 16, does not reduce retroactively the service retirement allowances to which members are entitled.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>(3) Discussion</h2>\n<p>As an initial matter, we briefly dispose of petitioner Dahlin's separate IRC-based claims. First, addressing fully those IRC-based claims would require an analysis of specific IRC provisions. IRC section 7476(a), however, confers jurisdiction to determine retirement plan qualification to the United States Tax Court. It follows that engaging in the analysis that petitioner Dahlin's IRC-based claims require would be outside the scope of our jurisdiction. We therefore reject petitioner Dahlin's IRC-based claims without further discussion.</p>\n<p>Turning to the other challenges, our analysis again must begin with determining the specific terms of the PERS statutory contract.</p>\n<p><i>Former</i> ORS 237.251(3)(g) (1991), <i>renumbered as</i> ORS 238.630(3)(g) (1995), which initially provided the basis for PERB's adoption of the rule that became OAR XXX-XXX-XXXX (1996), provided:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[PERB] [s]hall determine the actuarial equivalency of optional forms of retirement allowances and establish from time to time for that purpose the necessary actuarial factors, which shall constitute a part of the system [.]\"<sup>[65]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>We again apply the <i>PGE</i> methodology, 317 Or. at 610-12, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2613226\"><a href=\"/opinion/2613226/pge-v-bureau-of-labor-and-industries/\"><span class=\"volume\">859</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1143</span></a></span>, to the statute to ascertain the legislature's intent and conclude that the legislature's intent is clear from the first level of analysis. As respondents argue, <i>former</i> ORS 237.251(3)(g) (1991) set out a legislative mandate that PERB periodically perform two tasks: first, to determine <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1109</span> the \"actuarial equivalency of optional forms of retirement allowances\"; and, second, to \"establish[,] from time to time[,] for [the purpose of determining the actuarial equivalency of optional forms of retirement allowances,] the necessary actuarial factors, which shall constitute a part of the system [.]\" <i>Former</i> ORS 237.251(3)(g) (1991) therefore required PERB periodically to update its actuarial factors to ensure that service retirement allowances ultimately paid, regardless of the form of those allowances,<sup>[66]</sup> satisfied an \"actual equivalency\" standard.</p>\n<p>Similarly, <i>former</i> ORS 237.147 (1991) <i>renumbered as</i> ORS 238.300(1) (1995), provided, in part, that the annuity component of each member's service retirement allowance \"shall be the actuarial equivalent\" of each member's \"accumulated contributions * * * at the time of retirement.\" In short, both statutes clearly indicate that the legislature intended for members' service retirement allowances to satisfy an \"actuarial equivalency\" standard. The legislature delegated that responsibility, which included updating the system's actuarial factors, to PERB.</p>\n<p>The PERS statutes did not define the term \"actuarial equivalent\" at the time that PERB adopted <i>former</i> OAR 459-05-055 (1993), <i>renumbered as</i> OAR XXX-XXX-XXXX (1996); that term remained undefined until 2003.<sup>[67]</sup> The PERS actuary, however, testified consistently with the following explanation of the term, as set out in the Special Master's report:</p>\n<blockquote>\"AEFs are based on assumptions concerning the future earnings of the fund and members' expected mortality rates. AEFs are used to convert lump sum account balances to monthly payment streams and to change one optional benefit payment form to another. <i>When converting a lump sum to a monthly benefit, the lump sum and the monthly benefit payments are actuarially equivalent if both forms of payment have the same present value.</i>\"</blockquote>\n<p>(Emphasis added.) That definition suggests that the concept of actuarial equivalency, as it relates to these cases, is concerned with substituting equally one form of payment for another  that is, a lump sum representing a member's total service retirement allowance for a stream of payments over time derived from that sum. In addition, it is clear that, if mortality rates improve, members' monthly allowances would decrease if AEFs properly are updated to reflect those improvements.</p>\n<p>PERB, however, has adopted a rule that essentially renders the AEFs static. OAR XXX-XXX-XXXX(5) (1996) provided that, for certain members,<sup>[68]</sup> \"[PERB] shall not change a factor that would produce a lower periodic or single benefit payment.\" That text effectively states that, even if the PERS actuary recommended that PERB update the AEFs to reflect improved mortality assumptions, PERB would not do so if it would result in lower monthly service retirement allowances for certain members. Indeed, the PERS actuary testified before the Special Master that PERB had declined to update the AEFs notwithstanding his warning that the PERB-applied AEFs were not producing actuarially equivalent benefits (as <i>former</i> ORS 237.251(3)(g) (1991) and <i>former</i> ORS 237.147(1) (1991) required) and his advice that PERB not adopt OAR XXX-XX-XXXX (1996).</p>\n<p>Petitioners argue that the last clause of <i>former</i> ORS 237.251(3)(g) (1991)  \"which shall constitute a part of the system\"  demonstrates a legislative intent to provide PERB with the absolute authority to establish, at its discretion, the system's actuarial factors. They argue that, because of that authority, the actuarial factors that PERB has established are part of the PERS statutory contract and cannot be changed without <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1110</span> either breaching or impairing their contractual rights. We disagree, for two reasons.</p>\n<p>First, petitioners' reading of the final clause of <i>former</i> ORS 237.251(3)(g) (1991) both misapprehends and devalues the clause that precedes it. Again, that provision provided:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[PERB] [s]hall determine the actuarial equivalency of optional forms of retirement allowances and establish from time to time for that purpose the necessary actuarial factors, which shall constitute a part of the system[.]\"</blockquote>\n<p>As a grammatical matter, the phrase, \"which shall constitute part of the system,\" refers to factors that <i>necessarily ensure actuarial equivalency</i> in the payment of PERS members' service retirement allowances  a standard by which, as the Special Master found, the AEFs used before the 2003 PERS legislation fell short. <i>See generally,</i> Bryan A. Garner, <i>A Dictionary of Modern American Usage</i> 648 (1998) (nonrestrictive clause provides detail as to preceding noun). Relatedly, in light of the legislature's choice to use nonrestrictive wording in the final clause, it is apparent that the legislature's primary intent was to ensure that PERB update the AEFs as necessary to produce actuarial equivalency in the calculation of members' service retirement allowances. <i>See id.</i> (nonrestrictive clauses generally provide supplemental detail relating to preceding noun, as opposed to more essential detail); <i>see also generally </i><i>Feero v. Housley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1346297\"><a href=\"/opinion/1346297/feero-v-housley/\"><span class=\"volume\">205</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Or.</span> <span class=\"page\">404</span></a></span>, 415, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1346297\"><a href=\"/opinion/1346297/feero-v-housley/\"><span class=\"volume\">288</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1052</span></a></span> (1955) (court presumes that legislature meant exactly what it stated within statutory provision).</p>\n<p>Petitioners' suggested reading of <i>former</i> ORS 237.251(3)(g) (1991) also renders that provision internally inconsistent, effectively directing PERB to establish proper AEFs to ensure actuarial equivalency in calculating PERS members' service retirement allowances on the one hand, while providing PERB with authority to make those factors permanent on the other. That is not a plausible reading of the statute. To the contrary, the statutory wording demonstrates that the legislature intended for PERB to ensure that a retired member's stream of monthly payments would be the actuarial equivalent of that member's total service retirement allowance. And, in so doing, PERB was required, \"from time to time for that purpose[,]\" <i>former</i> ORS 237.251(3)(g) (1991), to establish the actuarial factors necessary to produce that result. Nowhere in chapter 237 (now chapter 238) did the legislature evince any contrary intent. And, no part of that chapter suggests that the legislature intended to give PERB the authority to make its AEFs permanent.</p>\n<p>Based on the foregoing, we reject petitioners' argument that the legislature intended in <i>former</i> ORS 237.251(3)(g) (1991), which, as noted, provided the basis for PERB's adoption of OAR 459-05-055 (1993), <i>renumbered as</i> OAR XXX-XXX-XXXX (1996), to freeze the AEFs in place at that time, as part of the statutory contract. It follows that nothing about Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 68, sections 2 and 4, <i>as amended by</i> Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, section 40, and Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 625, section 16, breaches or impairs an obligation of the PERS contract.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E. <i>State Constitutional Claim Under Article I, Section 20</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Petitioner Dahlin argues that the 2003 PERS legislation discriminates on the basis of age in violation of the equal privileges and immunities clause of Article I, section 20, of the Oregon Constitution.<sup>[69]</sup> More specifically, he argues that the Special Master's findings indicate that the 2003 legislation will have a disparate impact on the service retirement allowances of \"older workers\" as opposed to those of younger workers. He argues that, because the 2003 legislation denies older workers benefits that it specifically confers to younger workers, it violates his rights under Article I, section 20.</p>\n<p>Petitioner Dahlin uses various terms to describe the purported \"class\" to which he belongs. On one hand, he argues that the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1111</span> 2003 PERS legislation denies benefits to \"older workers\"  a term that he does not define  that it confers to younger workers, but, on the other, he asserts membership in a specific class, namely, Tier One members aged 40 and older. However, even assuming that either categorization is sufficient to define a class for the purposes of Article I, section 20, petitioner Dahlin cannot prevail as a member of either class, as explained below.</p>\n<p>As to petitioner Dahlin's argument based on a class of \"older workers,\" the Special Master's report states that \"mid-career employees  that is, those within 10 years of retirement  [will] experience greater impacts on their future benefits\" as a result of the 2003 PERS legislation. According to his report, those members are aged 42 to 52. His report indicates further that members aged 57 are expected to receive benefits greater than those received by mid-career members and even than those received by members aged 37. That data indicates that the oldest group of members are projected to receive benefits in excess of those received by many younger members. Petitioner Dahlin presents no additional evidence nor any evidence to the contrary. In fact, he relies exclusively on the findings set out in the Special Master's report, but he reaches a conclusion exactly opposite to that which is inescapable based on the data set out in that report. We conclude that, even if this court were to agree that \"older workers\" compose a recognizable class under Article I, section 20, petitioner Dahlin cannot prevail on his claim here because the evidence simply does not support his assertion that the 2003 PERS legislation treats \"older workers\" disparately from younger ones.</p>\n<p>As to petitioner Dahlin's argument based on a class of \"Tier One members aged 40 and older,\" that argument essentially asserts age discrimination within the broader \"class\" of Tier One members. Being a Tier One member, however, is a status created entirely by the PERS statutory scheme. As this court has explained, the legislature is free to create statutory classes and to create distinctions among those classes. <i>Greist v. Phillips,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1127452\"><a href=\"/opinion/1127452/greist-v-phillips/\"><span class=\"volume\">322</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Or.</span> <span class=\"page\">281</span></a></span>, 292, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1127452\"><a href=\"/opinion/1127452/greist-v-phillips/\"><span class=\"volume\">906</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">789</span></a></span> (1995). What the legislature may not do, however, is create distinctions based on characteristics that exist independent of the terms of legislation. <i>Crocker and Crocker,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"836223\"><a href=\"/opinion/836223/in-re-marriage-of-crocker/\"><span class=\"volume\">332</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Or.</span> <span class=\"page\">42</span></a></span>, 54-55, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"836223\"><a href=\"/opinion/836223/in-re-marriage-of-crocker/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">759</span></a></span> (2001). As noted above, petitioner Dahlin has failed to prove any distinction based on age. He therefore is left to rely entirely on his status as a Tier One member. Because that classification was created by the statutory scheme at issue and does not exist independently of that scheme, it cannot serve as a basis for petitioner Dahlin to assert an Article I, section 20, violation. We therefore reject his claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>F. <i>Remaining Constitutional Claims</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In addition to the claims for relief that we have addressed, various petitioners also challenge parts of the 2003 PERS legislation based on the \"takings\" provisions of the Oregon Constitution and the United States Constitution, Or. Const., Art. I, § 18; U.S. Const., Amends. V, XIV, and the Contracts Clause of the United States Constitution, U.S. Const., Art. I, § 10. The foregoing holdings dispose of those claims, either because we have voided the challenged legislation in light of petitioners' state contract claims or because our determination of the particular obligations set out in the PERS contract obviates the fundamental premise of petitioners' remaining claims (that is, that the PERS contract granted them \"rights\" that cannot be breached, impaired, or taken for public use). We therefore need not discuss those claims further.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>\"The function of the court is to declare the law as it is and not what it thinks it ought to be.\" <i>Wallace v. International Ass'n,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">155</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Or.</span> <span class=\"page\">652</span></span>, 661-62, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1090</span></span> (1937). We offer that nearly 70-year-old statement from our predecessors on this bench neither in apology nor as commentary on the various legislative and executive policy choices  both past and present  that these cases have brought before us. Instead, we reiterate that pronouncement here because we think that it is both correct and reflective of our efforts to resolve these compelling issues  efforts that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1112</span> counsel and the parties themselves advanced considerably through their diligent and capable conduct of this litigation.</p>\n<p>We conclude that, in two respects, petitioners have prevailed on their claims for relief. First, petitioners in each of the cases correctly have argued that the provisions of the 2003 PERS legislation that alter the manner in which earnings are credited to the regular accounts of Tier One members impair an obligation of the statutory PERS contract in violation of Article I, section 21, of the Oregon Constitution. As such, those provisions are void and of no effect. Second, <i>Strunk</i> and <i>Sartain</i> petitioners are correct in their assertion that the provision of the 2003 PERS legislation that directs PERB to not apply annual COLAs to certain retired members' \"fixed\" service retirement allowances breaches the contrary obligation of the PERS contract to do so; that provision also is declared void and of no effect. In all other respects, we conclude that petitioners' claims for relief are not well taken.</p>\n<p>Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, sections 5, 6, 7, and 8, <i>as amended by</i> Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 625, section 10, 11, and 12, are declared void. The final sentence in Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, section 10(3), is declared void. In all other respects, petitioners' claims for relief are denied or dismissed.</p>\n<p>BALMER, J., concurring.</p>\n<p>I join in each aspect of the majority's analysis and disposition of these proceedings, including those that follow from this court's decision in <i>Oregon State Police Officers' Assn. v. State of Oregon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1192606\"><a href=\"/opinion/1192606/oregon-police-officersassn-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">323</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Or.</span> <span class=\"page\">356</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1192606\"><a href=\"/opinion/1192606/oregon-police-officersassn-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">765</span></a></span> (1996) (<i>OSPOA</i>). We appropriately have declined to revisit the questions of statutory interpretation and legislative intent that <i>OSPOA</i> addressed and decided. Our respect for that precedent, however, should not be misread as an endorsement of either the result or the reasoning in that case.</p>\n<p>To the contrary, in my view, the court in <i>OSPOA</i> lost sight of the polestar of statutory contractual analysis: clear, unambiguous, and unmistakable promissory intent. <i>See </i><i>Hughes v. State of Oregon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1155678\"><a href=\"/opinion/1155678/hughes-v-state-of-oregon/\"><span class=\"volume\">314</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Or.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1155678\"><a href=\"/opinion/1155678/hughes-v-state-of-oregon/\"><span class=\"volume\">838</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1018</span></a></span> (1992) (\"a contract will not be inferred from * * * legislation unless it unambiguously expresses an intention to create a contract\"); <i>Campbell et al. v. Aldrich et al.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3838402\"><a href=\"/opinion/4079958/campbell-v-aldrich/\"><span class=\"volume\">159</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Or.</span> <span class=\"page\">208</span></a></span>, 213-14, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3838402\"><a href=\"/opinion/4079958/campbell-v-aldrich/\"><span class=\"volume\">79</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">257</span></a></span> (1938) (legislature's intention \"to create contractual obligations * * * must clearly and unmistakably appear\"; surrender of legislative control over vital public matters \"cannot be established by mere implication\"). Having lost that bearing, the court in <i>OSPOA</i> proceeded to misconstrue the \"assumed interest rate\" provision of ORS 238.255  a patently administrative provision intended to smooth fluctuations in PERS fund earnings  as both a material and a perpetual aspect of the PERS contract. <i>See OSPOA,</i> 323 Or. at 377-78, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1192606\"><a href=\"/opinion/1192606/oregon-police-officersassn-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">765</span></a></span> (construing \"assumed interest rate\" provision). Oregon's public employers and taxpayers must live with the effect of <i>OSPOA's</i> error for some time to come. Our appropriate respect for <i>stare decisis</i> in the interpretation of statutes, and more particularly of statutory contracts on which public employees have relied, compels as much. <i>OSPOA,</i> however, ought not have any more vitality than that.</p>\n<p>I concur.</p>\n<p>DURHAM, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p>I write separately to explain why I join in some but not all of the majority's analysis and conclusions.</p>\n<p>I begin by noting that I agree with the majority's invocation of the \"rule of necessity\" to allow the justices of this court to address and decide the issues in these proceedings. I also agree with the majority's determinations regarding petitioners' standing and the existence of justiciable controversies; the dismissal of petitioner Dahlin's claims under 42 USC section 1983 and on behalf of certain PERS retirees; the dismissal, on ripeness grounds, of claims by petitioners in <i>Strunk, Burt, Dahlin,</i> and <i>Evans</i> challenging Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, sections 14b(1)(b) and 14b(2); and the denial of motions to compel production of documents in the <i>Strunk</i> and <i>Dahlin</i> proceedings.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1113</span> I turn now to the majority's disposition of petitioners' other substantive challenges to the 2003 PERS legislation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>ANNUAL CREDITING OF MEMBERS' REGULAR ACCOUNTS AT ASSUMED EARNINGS RATE</h2>\n<p>The majority declares that Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, sections 5, 6, 7, and 8, <i>as amended by</i> Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 625, sections 10, 11, and 12, are void, because those provisions impair the state's contractual retirement obligation with its employees in violation of Article I, section 21, of the Oregon Constitution. That section provides, in part: \"No * * * law impairing the obligation of contracts shall ever be passed * * *.\" The cited provisions of the 2003 PERS legislation concern the legislature's cancellation of annual crediting of Tier One member regular account balances at the assumed earnings rate. I concur with the majority's conclusion in that respect.</p>\n<p>I also concur with the majority that the legislature's modification of the statutory scheme for charging public employer accounts when credited income exceeds earnings for more than five years (the \"call\") does not impair the statutory contract. The underlying contractual obligation to credit member regular accounts remains with the state regardless of the state's accounting arrangements with public employers regarding the funding of member account balances.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENTS (COLAs)</h2>\n<p>The majority also concludes that Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, section 10(3), direct the Public Employees Retirement Board (PERB) to breach the promise of annual COLAs on certain \"fixed\" service retirement allowances. 338 Or at 225, 108 P.3d at 1104. I conclude that the cited section of the 2003 legislation regarding COLAs purports to eliminate a contractual obligation of the state. As a consequence, that that provision of the 2003 legislation impairs an obligation of contract in violation of Article I, section 21, and is invalid for that reason. The legislature's attempt to suspend COLAs on properly calculated service retirement allowances for the affected retired members is void.</p>\n<p>The majority rests its breach of contract theory on its reading of <i>Eckles v. State of Oregon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1176322\"><a href=\"/opinion/1176322/eckles-v-state-of-oregon/\"><span class=\"volume\">306</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Or.</span> <span class=\"page\">380</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1176322\"><a href=\"/opinion/1176322/eckles-v-state-of-oregon/\"><span class=\"volume\">760</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">846</span></a></span> (1988). In <i>Eckles,</i> this court examined two provisions of a statute, Oregon Laws 1982 (Special Session 3), chapter 2 (the \"Transfer Act\"). One provision of the Transfer Act, section four, eliminated the state's statutory contractual obligation to employers to use certain surplus funds in a statutory trust fund only for purposes related to the workers' compensation laws. A second provision, section two, directed the State Treasurer to transfer $81 million from that statutory trust fund to the state General Fund.</p>\n<p>The court concluded that section four of the Transfer Act impaired the state's contractual obligation under preexisting contracts with employers and was unconstitutional in that respect. The court also concluded that section two of the Transfer Act did not alter the state's contractual obligation to employers. Requiring the State Treasurer to transfer funds did nothing to change the state's contractual promise to use the funds solely for purposes related to workers' compensation laws. In the court's view, however, section two did breach the state's promise; the transfer of the funds exposed the state to a legal obligation to compensate employers for the breach.</p>\n<p>In my view, the elimination of COLAs in the 2003 PERS legislation is closely analogous to the elimination of the statutory contractual duty effected by section four of the Transfer Act, as discussed in <i>Eckles.</i> The majority's attempt to compare that aspect of the 2003 PERS legislation to the operation of section two of the Transfer Act, as discussed in <i>Eckles,</i> is unconvincing. I conclude that the majority misreads <i>Eckles.</i></p>\n<p>Nevertheless, I see no reason to dissent from the result that the majority adopts following its breach of contract analysis. The majority returns the parties to the position that they occupied before the legislature adopted its 2003 amendment, and declares that that amendment is void. As <i>Eckles</i> demonstrates, that is the proper remedy <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1114</span> when legislation impairs the obligation of a statutory contract in violation of Article I, section 21, of the Oregon Constitution. As a consequence, I concur in that aspect of the majority opinion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>ADOPTION OF NEW ACTUARIAL EQUIVALENCY FACTORS (AEFs)</h2>\n<p>The 2003 PERS legislation modifies the preexisting statutory scheme regarding PERB's application of actuarial equivalency factors (AEFs) to convert a member's account balance to a monthly allowance, among other things. Petitioners contend that, pursuant to a lawful delegation of rulemaking authority, PERB had adopted rules in 1993 (<i>former</i> OAR 459-05-055) and 1996 (OAR XXX-XXX-XXXX) that required PERB to refrain from changing any AEF if the adoption of the new factor would have the effect of lowering a periodic or single benefit payment to a member. According to petitioners, PERB's rules \"constitute[d] a part of the system,\" as ORS 238.630(3)(g) (2001) provided, from the time of their adoption. Therefore, petitioners argue, by amending certain statutes to require PERB to update its AEFs, the legislature impaired an aspect of the retirement contract between the state and the affected members of PERS.</p>\n<p>Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 68, section 2, requires PERB to adopt new AEFs that \"use the best actuarial information on mortality available at the time the board adopts the tables[.]\" Section 4 of that law incorporates the new AEFs as a part of the retirement calculus for members who retired on or after July 1, 2003, and exposes those retirees to the possibility of lower retirement allowances under the new AEFs. Petitioners contend that those sections of Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 68, impair the state's contractual obligation to its employees.</p>\n<p>The majority rejects that claim, and I concur for the following reason. There is no question that PERB's 1993 and 1996 rule, in its amended 1996 form, in absolute and unconditional terms, prohibited PERB from changing any AEF to the economic detriment of any member who established PERS membership before January 1, 1999. It is unnecessary to decide in this proceeding whether PERB exceeded its rulemaking authority in adopting those rules. The only true question is whether the statutes requiring establishment of AEFs by PERB reflect a contractual intention by the legislature, such that the Legislative Assembly in 2003 lacked authority to impair any obligation regarding AEFs that PERB's rules embodied.</p>\n<p>I assume <i>arguendo</i> that the legislature may create a binding contract by a valid delegation of authority to an administrative agency to specify contractual terms through rulemaking. However, that is not what occurred here.</p>\n<p>For many years before it enacted the 2003 PERS legislation, the legislature had required PERB to establish from time to time the necessary actuarial factors that would allow PERB to determine the actuarial equivalency of the optional forms of retirement under the system. <i>See, e.g., former</i> ORS 237.251(3)(g) (1991).<sup>[1]</sup> \"Actuarial\" means \"relating to statistical calculation esp. of life expectancy.\" <i>Webster's Third New Int'l Dictionary</i> 22 (unabridged ed. 2002). As a variable in the statistical calculation of actuarial equivalency, the factor of \"life expectancy\" has no constant and unchanging value. Rather, it is constantly in flux, shifting with the prevalence in the subject population of the various factors (<i>e.g.,</i> health history, diet, exercise, tobacco use, etc.) that influence longevity.<sup>[2]</sup><i>Former</i> ORS <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1115</span> 237.251(3)(g) (1991) required PERB to take account of the changing character of the factors that determine actuarial equivalency by establishing the necessary actuarial factors \"from time to time.\"</p>\n<p>There is no question that the legislature has delegated broad rulemaking authority to PERB. When PERB adopted the two rules now under consideration, <i>former</i> ORS 237.263 (1991), <i>renumbered as</i> ORS 238.650(1995), provided:</p>\n<blockquote>\"<i>Subject to the limitations of ORS 237.001 to 237.315, the board shall, from time to time, establish rules for transacting its business and administering the system</i> in accordance with the requirements of ORS 183.310 to 183.550.\"</blockquote>\n<p>(Emphasis added.) That statute has remained in effect without substantive modification through the present time. Aside from any question of the lawfulness of the 1993 and 1996 rules, that statute confirms that PERB had authority to alter those rules at any time.</p>\n<p>PERB's broad authority to alter its rules is insufficient, standing alone, to demonstrate that PERB's rules did not reflect a legislative contractual intent while they were in effect. However, in view of PERB's duty under <i>former</i> ORS 237.251(3)(g) (1991) to evaluate the accuracy of its AEFs and publish new ones from time to time, and the necessary qualifying effect of that statute on PERB's rulemaking authority in <i>former</i> ORS 237.263 (1991), I cannot read PERB's rules to create a contractual obligation that later legislation could not impair. <i>Former</i> ORS 237.263 (1991) required PERB \"from time to time\" to establish rules for conducting its business, and ORS 237.251(3)(g) (1991) and its statutory successors in force through 2001 also required PERB to establish new AEFs \"from time to time.\" Those provisions underscore the impermanence of the AEF rules on which petitioners base their claim. The foregoing discussion demonstrates that the majority correctly rejects petitioners' contract impairment claims based on PERB's 1993 and 1996 administrative rules.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>PETITIONER DAHLIN'S AGE DISCRIMINATION CLAIM</h2>\n<p>The majority addresses and rejects the claim of petitioner Dahlin that the 2003 PERS legislation discriminates against him on the basis of age in violation of Article I, section 20, of the Oregon Constitution. I concur.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>TERMINATION OF EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS TO MEMBER ACCOUNT; LOSS OF CREDITS TO MEMBER ACCOUNT AND ENHANCEMENTS TO RETIREMENT ALLOWANCE</h2>\n<p>The 2003 PERS legislation terminates the longstanding statutory plan for funding a key component of public employee retirement allowances, the member account. The result is that, for affected Tier One employees, decades-old statutory requirements for credits to member accounts and employer matching contributions no longer will apply. Petitioners argue that those changes inevitably will lead to reduced retirement allowances in violation of their retirement contract with the state. Moreover, they contend, because employee retirement allowances will fall under the 2003 PERS legislation, public employers will pay COLA adjustments after petitioners retire on the basis of illegally reduced retirement allowances, thus compounding the economic injury to petitioners. To evaluate petitioners' impairment of contract claim in this respect, it is necessary to put in the proper context the requirements for member accounts that were in place before enactment of the 2003 PERS legislation.</p>\n<p>The payment that an eligible member of the PERS system receives on retiring is known as a service retirement allowance. ORS 238.300 (2001) provided:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1116</span> \"Upon retiring from service at normal retirement age or thereafter, a member of the system shall receive a <i>service retirement allowance which shall consist of the following annuity and pensions:</i> * * *.\"</blockquote>\n<p>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p>As that clause makes clear, two sources of funds constitute the service retirement allowance: an annuity and pensions. ORS 238.005 (2001) defined \"annuity\" and \"pension\" as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"For purposes of this chapter:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(1) `Annuity' means payments for life derived from contributions made by a member as provided in this chapter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(15) `Pension' means annual payments for life derived from contributions by one or more public employers.\"</blockquote>\n<p>The phrase \"contributions made by a member\" in the statutory definition of \"annuity\" referred to the statutory obligation of active members to contribute six percent of their salaries to the Public Employees Retirement Fund (the fund). ORS 238.200(1)(a) (2001) provided:</p>\n<blockquote>\"An active member of the system shall contribute to the fund and there shall be withheld from salary of the member six percent of that salary.\"</blockquote>\n<p>Oregon's statutory scheme for public employee retirement always has required employees' contributions to the fund that provides the financial basis for their retirement since the creation of the present retirement system 60 years ago. That scheme also has required PERB to maintain individual accounts that reflect both the amount of member contributions to the fund and any increases in the account due to interest earnings. <i>See</i> OCLA § 90-710(2) (stating those requirements in the original public employee retirement statute in 1945). Until 2003, those provisions had not changed significantly since 1945.</p>\n<p>Several statutes in effect in 2001, as set out below, explained the nature and operation of member accounts and their central importance to the calculation of each member's service retirement allowance. ORS 238.005(13) (2001) provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote>\"(a) `Member account' means the regular account and the variable account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(b) `Regular account' means the account established for each active and inactive member under ORS 238.250.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(c) `Variable account' means the account established for a member who participates in the Variable Annuity Account under ORS 238.260.\"</blockquote>\n<p>ORS 238.200(2) (2001) provided:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The contributions of each member as provided in subsection (1) of this section shall be deducted by the employer from each payroll and transmitted by the employer to the board, which shall cause them to be credited to the member account of the member.\"</blockquote>\n<p>ORS 238.250 (2001) provided:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The board shall provide for a regular account for each active and inactive member of the system. The regular account shall show the amount of the member's contributions to the fund and the interest which they have earned. The board shall furnish a written statement thereof upon request by any member or beneficiary of the system.\"</blockquote>\n<p>ORS 238.255 (2001) explained the requirements for crediting the regular account of a Tier One member:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The regular account for an active or inactive member of the system shall be examined each year. If the regular account is credited with earnings for the previous year in an amount less than the earnings that would have been credited pursuant to the assumed interest rate for that year determined by the board, the amount of the difference shall be credited to the regular account and charged to a reserve account in the fund established for the purpose. A reserve account so established may not be maintained on a deficit basis for a period of more than five years. Earnings in excess of the assumed interest rate for years following the year for which a charge is made to the reserve account shall first be applied to reduce or eliminate the amount of a deficit. The Public Employees Retirement Board shall attempt <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1117</span> to ensure that the reserve account is funded with amounts adequate to leave a zero balance in the account when all members who established membership in the system before January 1, 1996, as described in ORS 238.430, have retired.\"</blockquote>\n<p>The statutes set out above demonstrate that the requirements regarding member contributions of salary to the fund served two functions. First, they required a personal investment, over time, by the member in the system that ultimately would fund the member's retirement. Second, they afforded the member the opportunity, over time, to increase the size of the resulting member's regular account.</p>\n<p>The majority correctly reports that the PERS system created three different formulas for calculating a member's service retirement allowance and promised the members that the state would calculate their benefits according to the one formula out of the three that would provide the highest level of service retirement allowance. The three formulas are the Money Match, the Pension Plus Annuity, and the Full Formula. The Pension Plus Annuity formula applies to only Tier One members who made contributions to the system before August 21, 1981. For the Tier One members who do not meet that qualification, ORS 238.300 (2001) affords two, not three, formulas, the Money Match and the Full Formula. It is undisputed that, as petitioners argue, the size of the member's service retirement allowance under the Money Match and Pension Plus Annuity formulas turns directly on the size of the accumulated percentage-of-salary contributions and interest on those contributions in the member's regular account.</p>\n<p>The three formulas arise from the terms of ORS 238.300, which in 2001 provided:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Upon retiring from service at normal retirement age or thereafter, a member of the system shall receive a service retirement allowance which shall consist of the following annuity and pensions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(1) A refund annuity which shall be the actuarial equivalent of accumulated contributions by the member and interest thereon credited at the time of retirement, which annuity shall provide an allowance payable during the life of the member and at death a lump sum equal in amount to the difference between accumulated contributions at the time of retirement and the sum of the annuity payments actually made to the member during life shall be paid to such person, if any, as the member nominates by written designation duly acknowledged and filed with the board or shall otherwise be paid according to the provisions of this chapter for disposal of an amount credited to the member account of a member at the time of death in the event the member designates no beneficiary to receive the amount or no such beneficiary is able to receive the amount. If death of the member occurs before the first payment is due, the member account of the member shall be treated as though death had occurred before retirement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(2)(a) A life pension (nonrefund) for current service provided by the contributions of employers, which pension, <i>subject to paragraph (b) of this subsection,</i> shall be an amount which, when added to the sum of the annuity under subsection (1) of this section and the annuity, if any, provided on the same basis and payable from the Variable Annuity Account, both annuities considered on a refund basis, results in a total of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(A) For service as a police officer or firefighter, two percent of final average salary multiplied by the number of years of membership in the system as a police officer or firefighter before the effective date of retirement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(B) For service as a member of the Legislative Assembly, two percent of final average salary multiplied by the number of years of membership in the system as a member of the Legislative Assembly before the effective date of retirement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(C) For service as other than a police officer, firefighter or member of the Legislative Assembly, 1.67 percent of final average salary multiplied by the number of years of membership in the system as other than a police officer, firefighter or <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1118</span> member of the Legislative Assembly before the effective date of retirement.[<sup>[3]</sup>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(b) <i>A pension under this subsection shall be at least:</i>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(A) The actuarial equivalent of the annuity provided by the accumulated contributions of the member.[<sup>[4]</sup>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(B) For a member who made contributions before August 21, 1981, the equivalent of a pension computed pursuant to this subsection as it existed immediately before that date.[<sup>[5]</sup>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(c) As used in this subsection, `number of years of membership' means the number of full years plus any remaining fraction of a year for which salary was paid and contributions to the Public Employees Retirement System made. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, in determining a remaining fraction a full month shall be considered as one-twelfth of a year and a major fraction of a month shall be considered as a full month. Membership of a school district employee, an employee of the State Board of Higher Education engaged in teaching or other school activity at an institution of higher education or an employee of the Department of Human Services, the Oregon Youth Authority, the Department of Corrections or the State Board of Education engaged in teaching or other school activity at an institution supervised by the authority, board or department, for all portions of a school year in a calendar year in which the district school, institution of higher education or school activity at an institution so supervised in which the member is employed is normally in session shall be considered as a full one-half year of membership. The number of years of membership of a member who received a refund of contributions as provided in ORS 237.976(2) is limited to the number of years after the day before the date on which the refund was received. The number of years of membership of a member who is separated, for any reason other than death or disability, from all service entitling the member to membership in the system, who withdraws the amount credited to the member account of the member in the fund during absence from such service and who thereafter reenters the service of an employer participating in the system but does not repay the amount so withdrawn as provided in this chapter, is limited to the number of years after the day before the date of so reentering.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(3) An additional life pension (nonrefund) for prior service credit, including military service, credited to the member at the time of first becoming a member of the system, as elsewhere provided in this chapter, which pension shall be provided by the contributions of the employer.\"</blockquote>\n<p>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p>The Money Match formula in that statute derives particularly from the terms of ORS 238.300(2)(b)(A) (2001).<sup>[6]</sup> The Special Master described the operation of the Money Match formula as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[U]nder the Money Match method, a retired member receives an annuity based on his or her member account balance, which is matched by an equal annuity that the member's employer or employers funds. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1119</span> PERB historically has calculated the Money Match benefit by determining the balance in the member's regular account, adding the balance in the member's variable account, if any, and multiplying the combined balance by an AEF. A benefit in an equal amount is then added and charged to the employer's account. The resulting retirement allowance is therefore twice the amount of the benefit resulting from the member's own annuitized account balances.\"</blockquote>\n<p>Special Master's Report at 13.</p>\n<p>The legislature created the Pension Plus Annuity formula in 1967, Oregon Laws 1967, chapter 622, and, as already noted, it applies only to PERS members who have made contributions before August 21, 1981. The Special Master described the operation of the Pension Plus Annuity formula as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The Pension Plus Annuity method is available only to members who made PERS contributions before August 21, 1981. Under that method, PERS calculates a pension equal to 1.0 percent of the member's final average salary (1.35 percent for legislators, and police and fire employees) for each year of service. An annuity calculated by multiplying the member's account balance by an actuarial equivalency factor (AEF) is added to the pension. The retirement allowance is the sum of the formula pension and the member's annuitized account balance. Under the Pension Plus Annuity method, the retirement allowance is fully funded by employers.\"</blockquote>\n<p>The legislature created the Full Formula pension benefit in 1981. Or. Laws 1981, ch. 616, § 4. The Special Master described the operation of the Full Formula pension as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"PERS staff calculates the Full Formula allowance by multiplying the retiring member's final average salary and years of service by a factor. The formula provides 50 percent of final average salary for career employees (25 years of police/fire service, or 30 years of general service). Thus, the Full Formula calculation consists of three components: (1) the member's final average salary; (2) the member's years and months of creditable service as of the date of retirement; and (3) a factor set by statute at 1.67 percent for general service employees and 2.0 percent for legislators, police officers, and firefighters.7 The member is entitled to an annuity in an amount equal to the member's final average salary multiplied by the length of creditable service multiplied by the applicable statutory percentage factor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>7 \"The Full Formula benefit for legislators, police, and fire members provides a higher multiplier that allows those members to receive a more favorable retirement benefit, by allowing earlier retirement at a full benefit, than is provided for members in general service.\"</blockquote>\n<p>It is important to note that ORS 238.300(2)(a) (2001) provided that the Full Formula method was \"subject to paragraph (b) of this subsection [.]\" The cited paragraph (b) (<i>i.e.,</i> ORS 238.300(2)(b)), stated that \"[a] pension under this subsection shall be at least:\", and then described the Money Match and Pension Plus Annuity formulas. When I read those passages together, they indicate without ambiguity that the legislature guaranteed that the pension portion of the qualified retiring member's service retirement allowance, when calculated under the Full Formula method, would not fall below the amount of the pension to which the employee would be entitled under either the Money Match formula or, if it applied, the Pension Plus Annuity formula.</p>\n<p>The foregoing discussion indicates that the preexisting PERS system required Tier One members to contribute six percent of their salary, either through payroll deduction or by employer \"pick-up,\" to the fund, but entitled members to accumulate those contributions, together with interest on the contributions, in each member's regular account. That scheme created a tangible incentive for Tier One members to accumulate as large a regular account as possible, because, at retirement, the state guaranteed that the size of the regular account, among other factors, would determine the size of the member's service retirement allowance. Finally, because the Money Match and, as applicable, the Pension Plus Annuity formulas operated as a financial floor beneath which the pension <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1120</span> component could not fall, the incentive that I identify above existed for all Tier One members regardless of the particular formula that PERS used to calculate their service retirement allowance.</p>\n<p>In 2003, the legislature amended ORS 238.200, which now prohibits any future contributions to the fund and, thus, to the member's regular account on or after January 1, 2004. ORS 238.200(4) provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Notwithstanding subsections (1) to (3) of this section, a member of the system, or a participating employer acting on behalf of the member pursuant to ORS 238.205, is not permitted or required to make employee contributions to the fund for service performed on or after January 1, 2004.\"</blockquote>\n<p>The new statute continues to require members to contribute six percent of their salary,<sup>[7]</sup> but now diverts those amounts into an Individual Account Program (IAP). Regular accounts will continue to exist, but PERS no longer will credit salary contributions to regular accounts. The Special Master summarized the consequences of that aspect of the 2003 PERS legislation as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The diversion of member contributions to the IAP will reduce members' future account balances for purposes of employer matching under the Money Match formula. On a system-wide basis, the elimination of employee contributions from the Money Match calculation probably will cause the Full Formula option to overtake the Money Match as the most common retirement formula. Although members will receive balances held in the IAP, those balances will not be matched by employer contributions, enhanced by cost of living increases, or annuitized at the assumed earnings rate as part of a defined benefit package.\"</blockquote>\n<p>In <i>Hughes v.

The court acknowledged the rule that the court will not infer a contract from legislation if the law \"does not unambiguously express an intention to create a contract[.]\" <i>Id.</i> at 14, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1155678\"><a href=\"/opinion/1155678/hughes-v-state-of-oregon/\"><span class=\"volume\">838</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1018</span></a></span>.

The court concluded that, because contractual intent of the legislature and the contractual nature of PERS were matters of settled law, \"[t]he only remaining question, therefore, is whether and to what extent <i>former</i> ORS 237.201 (1989) [the statute that exempted \"accrued or accruing\" PERS benefits from state taxation] was intended to be a term of the PERS contract.\" <i>Id.</i> at 21, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1155678\"><a href=\"/opinion/1155678/hughes-v-state-of-oregon/\"><span class=\"volume\">838</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1018</span></a></span> (footnote omitted).

Thus, the <i>Hughes</i> court concluded, the legislature had not obligated itself by its statutory contract to treat as exempt PERS benefits received for work performed after a change in the tax exemption statute.</p>\n<p><i>Hughes</i> relied on the <i>Taylor</i> case for the proposition that, on acceptance of employment (and completion of a required six-month period of service) with a PERS employer, subsequent legislation cannot impair the employee's vested contractual interest in a pension plan. <i>Hughes,</i> 314 Or. at 20, 838 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1121</span> P.2d 1018. In <i>Taylor,</i> the plaintiff was a deputy sheriff who had served for 13 years as a jail matron, and later as a corrections officer, in Multnomah County.

The county refused to allow the plaintiff to participate, claiming that her work in the jail did not involve \"law enforcement\" services. The county soon amended the ordinance, in Ordinance No. 29, to exclude the plaintiff more clearly, and relied on its express authority under the ordinance to determine the eligibility and qualifications of county personnel to receive benefits under the county's retirement system.</p>\n<p>This court held that the plaintiff had acquired pension rights under the original ordinance, Ordinance No. 25, because her contractual rights arose when she first had rendered service under that ordinance, <i>not</i> when she completed the service that the later Ordinance No. 29 required for receipt of pension benefits:</p>\n<blockquote>\"We conclude from the above authorities that Oregon has adopted not only the contractual concept of pensions, but, also, the concept that contractual rights can arise prior to the completion of the service necessary to a pension. * * * Such rights are subject, of course, to subsequent completion of the necessary service.\"</blockquote>\n<p><i>Taylor,</i> 265 Or. at 451, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1117036\"><a href=\"/opinion/1117036/taylor-v-multnomah-cty-deputy-sher-retire-bd/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">339</span></a></span> (citations omitted).

The plaintiff accepted employment. Later, the public employer revoked the sick leave policy and refused to pay the employee for the sick leave that he had accumulated during his employment. This court held that the public employer was required to honor the inducement for employment that it had made:</p>\n<blockquote>\"When plaintiff entered upon his employment with defendant he was advised that he would receive an allowance for accumulated sick leave upon termination of employment. He accepted employment upon the assumption that the allowance for sick leave was a part of his compensation for services.

This court in <i>Taylor</i> provided the following summary of the holding in <i>Adams</i> and expressly agreed with it:</p>\n<blockquote>\"In <i>Adams v.

This court's discussion of <i>Adams</i> and <i>Crawford</i> in <i>Taylor</i> constitutes a rejection of the statement in <i>Crawford</i> that contract rights in a retirement plan do not arise before the completion of the necessary service for retirement.</p>\n<p>The final case that is pertinent to this discussion is <i>Oregon State Police Officers'</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1123</span> <i>Assn. v.

Section 10 of the measure repeated the existing requirement that members must contribute six percent of their salary to the system, but prohibited public employers, by contract or otherwise, from \"picking up\" the employees' six percent payment obligation. That provision concerned the legislature's enactment of <i>former</i> ORS 237.075 (1979), <i>renumbered as</i> ORS 238.205 (1995), which authorized public employers to agree with employees or to decide unilaterally to pick up the employee contribution to PERS. <i>See OSPOA,</i> 323 Or. at 373, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1192606\"><a href=\"/opinion/1192606/oregon-police-officersassn-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">765</span></a></span> (explaining operation of pick-up statute). Section 11 of the ballot measure withdrew the statutorily guaranteed minimum rate of return on PERS member accounts. Section 12 of the ballot measure purported to nullify a statute that allowed retiring PERS members to add accumulated unused sick leave benefits to their final average salary.</p>\n<p>The court in <i>OSPOA</i> reviewed at length the Oregon case law, including the cases discussed in this opinion, on the subject of contractual rights that arise from public employee retirement plans. Addressing section 10, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Under the <i>Taylor</i> analysis, and contrary to the state's argument here, ORS 237.075, and the state's implementation of the authority contained in that statute, promised a pension benefit that plaintiffs could realize only on retirement with sufficient years of service, that is, <i>after</i> rendering labor for the state. Plaintiffs accepted that offer by working. <i>See </i><i>Taylor,</i> 265 Or. at 452, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1117036\"><a href=\"/opinion/1117036/taylor-v-multnomah-cty-deputy-sher-retire-bd/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">339</span></a></span>. The change mandated by section 10 alters the state's contractual obligation, in violation of <i>Taylor,</i> by increasing plaintiffs' cost of retirement benefits for services that, absent a lawful separation of employment, they will provide in the future. That consequence, if approved, would permit the state to retain the benefit of plaintiffs' labor, but relieve the state of the burden of paying plaintiffs what it promised for that labor. That result would frustrate plaintiffs' reasonable contractual expectations that were based on legal commitments expressly made by the state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"Once offered and accepted, a pension promise made by the state is not a mirage (something seen in the distance that disappears before the employee reaches retirement).

Section 10 expressly and substantially changes the state's contractual promise to plaintiffs with respect to the cost of their participation in the PERS retirement plan and the benefits that they will receive on retirement. Under section 10, the cost of participation to the employee increases while the benefits that the employee ultimately will receive on retirement decrease. Unquestionably, section 10 impairs the obligation of plaintiffs' PERS contract.\"</blockquote>\n<p><i>OSPOA,</i> 323 Or. at 374-75, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1192606\"><a href=\"/opinion/1192606/oregon-police-officersassn-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">765</span></a></span> (emphasis in original; footnote omitted).</p>\n<p>In dissent, Justice Gillette opined that the majority, in analyzing section 10, had transformed a statutory permission into a promise to pick up all public employees' six percent contributions. <i>Id.</i> at 409, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1192606\"><a href=\"/opinion/1192606/oregon-police-officersassn-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">765</span></a></span> (Gillette, J., dissenting). The majority responded to Justice Gillette's criticism as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The fatal flaw in that analysis is that it `errs in failing to consider the significance of context.' <i>Hughes,</i> 314 Or. at 21 n. 27, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1155678\"><a href=\"/opinion/1155678/hughes-v-state-of-oregon/\"><span class=\"volume\">838</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1018</span></a></span>. The six percent pick-up is an integral part of the underlying PERS pension contract. Unilateral termination of the six percent pick-up term of the PERS pension contract materially changes that underlying pension contract to plaintiffs' detriment and, thus, frustrates plaintiffs' reasonable reliance on the offer the state made to them and which they accepted by the tender of part performance. <i>Id.</i> at 20-21, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1155678\"><a href=\"/opinion/1155678/hughes-v-state-of-oregon/\"><span class=\"volume\">838</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1018</span></a></span>.\"</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 376, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1192606\"><a href=\"/opinion/1192606/oregon-police-officersassn-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">765</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p><i>OSPOA</i> went on to hold that sections 11 and 12 of Ballot Measure 8 also impaired employee contractual rights. As to those <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1124</span> conclusions, the court was unanimous. The court struck down Ballot Measure 8 in its entirety.</p>\n<p>I turn now to the analysis of the legislature's alteration in 2003 of the preexisting scheme for crediting member contributions in light of the case law discussed above. Both before and after the 2003 legislation, PERS members are subject, as they have been for many decades, to a legal requirement to contribute six percent of their salary to a discrete \"account\" in PERS. Salary contributions no longer will be credited to, and enhance the value of, member regular accounts; instead, PERS will credit salary contributions to the IAP. Also, before and after the legislative change, the regular account and IAP of each member will earn a rate of interest. What has changed is the legislature's commitment before the 2003 legislative amendment about how PERS will increase the value of those contributions before and after retirement and, consequently, the value of each member's service retirement allowance.</p>\n<p>First, the 2003 PERS legislation cancelled the preexisting unconditional obligation to increase Tier One member account balances annually by the assumed interest rate. I already have indicated that I join in the majority's determination that that change impaired the PERS contract.</p>\n<p>Second, the 2003 PERS legislation has reduced significantly the practical value of the Money Match formula by prohibiting future contributions of salary to regular member accounts and by eliminating any matching feature regarding the IAP. Before the change, PERS members could work and plan for a service retirement allowance that would reflect a pension amount not less than their accumulated salary contributions during their years of service, increased annually by at least the assumed interest rate, plus an amount not less than a pension (<i>i.e.,</i> an amount \"matched\" by the employer) that was the actuarial equivalent of the annuity that the members' accumulated contributions could provide. After the 2003 PERS legislation, the employer matching feature will not apply to member contributions made after July 1, 2003, either directly as one available retirement formula or as a minimum financial benchmark for the service retirement allowance.</p>\n<p>I conclude that that aspect of the 2003 PERS legislation constitutes an impairment of contract under this court's precedents. According to <i>OSPOA,</i> Ballot Measure 8's deprivation of the employer pick-up feature of the employee regular account contribution scheme represented an impairment of contract. By dint of logic, we must recognize that the complete prospective cancellation of that contribution scheme constitutes an even clearer impairment of contract.</p>\n<p>This court's cases defeat the majority's contrary conclusion. According to this court's case law, the proper focus is the employer's retirement benefit plan in place at the commencement of employment, together with any enhancements to that plan that the employer implements after employment begins. In no case has this court allowed a public body to modify a retirement plan to effect a practical reduction in benefits, either directly or through an alteration of the applicable formula for calculating benefits, after inducing employees to render service in reliance on the retirement plan. As <i>Taylor</i> held, and as the <i>Restatement of the Law of Contracts</i> confirms, the premise that makes the benefit plan unchangeable by the employer's unilateral act is the employer's promise, which the law implies, that the employer will not revoke the retirement plan once the employee commences service. Because the pre-2003 PERS scheme, <i>i.e.,</i> the \"offer,\" was in place when each petitioner commenced his or her employment, the state is bound by its implied promise not to revoke that offer once petitioners tendered partial performance.</p>\n<p>The majority makes two points in reaching its different conclusion. First, the majority asserts that, in 1981, the legislature adopted the Full Formula and expected that that formula would be \"a new, primary benefit calculator to the system.\" 338 Or at 191, 108 P.3d at 1086. The majority also observes that the Full Formula feature was significant because it shifted the risk of poor market performance to employers and away from employees.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1125</span> The legislature's expectation about the frequency of use of the Full Formula method as a \"primary benefit calculator\" is just that: an expectation. As the Special Master found, \"[u]ntil 1997, PERB assumed that member retirement allowances would be calculated under the Full Formula method [,]\" but the Money Match emerged instead in 1997 as the predominant formula. But the erroneous assumptions by the legislature and PERB about which retirement formula might be used most frequently as a \"primary benefit calculator\" cannot alter the fact that the pre-2003 PERS statute promised members that they would receive benefits calculated according to the most economically attractive formula from among <i>three</i> statutory formulas. Those incorrect assumptions about the frequency of use of the Full Formula and whether it would be the \"primary benefit calculator\" have no effect on the state's contractual obligation to pay the full benefits that the statute held out to employees.</p>\n<p>The majority's point also disregards the fact, confirmed in the text of ORS 238.300(2)(b) (2001), that the legislature required the employer's Full Formula pension to be \"at least\" the actuarial equivalent of the Money Match and Pension Plus Annuity formulas. Thus, as a matter of clear text, the Full Formula may be the ceiling but it is not the floor for the statutory pension component.</p>\n<p>I fail to see the significance of the fact that the Full Formula shifted greater risk of market loss to employers. The PERS statute promised members that they would receive benefits calculated according to the most economically attractive retirement benefit formula <i>regardless of market performance.</i> The addition of the Full Formula benefit in 1981 merely added one more option to the retirement calculation formulas. The risk of market loss under any of those formulas has nothing to do with their function in the calculation of promised service retirement allowances.</p>\n<p>Finally, the majority notes that the statutory provision regarding regular accounts contains no separate wording that promises that the legislature will not terminate the accumulation of member contributions in regular accounts. This court addressed and rejected a similar argument in <i>Hughes</i> that a dissenting opinion asserted. The majority in <i>Hughes</i> emphasized that the legislature's inclusion of a tax exemption statute within a larger statutory contract was a significant contextual clue about the legislature's contractual intent; the absence of promissory terms in the tax exemption statute itself was, in the court's view, immaterial. The court cited numerous United States Supreme Court cases that held that a tax exemption was a term of a larger contract, and noted:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The significant fact [in those cases] is that an underlying contract was present. This case presents an analogous situation where we are faced with an underlying contract  the PERS contract  and the question is whether the tax exemption statute is a term of that contract. Also significant is that in those cases the tax exemption terms are not, on their face, indicative of an intention not to repeal those exemptions. <i>The constitutional protection that was afforded to those provisions' obligations followed from the fact that they were part of a larger contract, not that they were promissory in and of themselves.</i>\"</blockquote>\n<p><i>Hughes,</i> 314 Or. at 21-22 n. 27, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1155678\"><a href=\"/opinion/1155678/hughes-v-state-of-oregon/\"><span class=\"volume\">838</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1018</span></a></span> (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Applying that point from <i>Hughes</i> to this case, it is immaterial that the legislature did not append explicit wording to the regular account statute to confirm its unchangeability. What is significant is the statutory context. Did the legislature incorporate into the PERS contract the provisions for regular accounts and the calculation of retirement benefits from the accumulated benefits in those accounts? Clearly, the answer is yes. The majority's contrary answer is a legal error.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>ELIMINATION OF VARIABLE ACCOUNT</h2>\n<p>The Special Master found as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Before the enactment of Section 3 of HB 2003, PERS members could elect to have 25, 50 or 75 percent of their employee contributions allocated to variable accounts, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1126</span> and they were entitled to purchase a variable annuity at retirement with their variable account balances. ORS 238.260 (2001). Section 3 of HB 2003 provides that, after December 31, 2003, members no longer are permitted to direct contributions to the variable account. ORS 238.260(3)(b) (2003).</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"Section 3 does not affect contributions credited to member accounts before its effective date.\"</blockquote>\n<p>The Special Master explained the operation of the variable account system before its cancellation as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Earnings on variable accounts are first allocated to pay a proportionate share of administrative expenses, and the remainder are credited to member accounts. The PERS system never has funded a reserve from variable account earnings. For many years, PERB added the balances in the regular and variable accounts of members who retired under the Money Match, and it applied the relevant AEFs to calculate their monthly annuities. PERS then required employers to match those annuities. That practice gave members twice the difference between the earnings on their regular and variable accounts.\"</blockquote>\n<p>In essence, the variable account plan afforded members the opportunity to obtain greater growth in their regular accounts by investing a portion of their salary contributions in equities. ORS 238.260(1) explained the legislature's purpose in establishing the variable account program:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The purpose of this section is to establish a well balanced, broadly diversified investment program for certain contributions and portions of the member accounts so as to provide retirement benefits for members of the system that will fluctuate as the value and earnings of the investments vary in relation to changes in the general economy. It is anticipated that investment of those contributions and portions of the member accounts in equities will result in the accumulation of larger deposit reserves for those members during their working years, tend to preserve the purchasing power of those reserves and the retirement benefits provided thereby and afford better protection in periods of economic inflation.\"</blockquote>\n<p>Petitioners assert that the legislature's repeal of their right to direct contributions to the variable account program is an impairment of their contract. The majority rejects that claim, relying substantially on the reasoning used to reject petitioners' claim regarding members' regular accounts. In particular, the majority points to the absence of specific words in ORS 238.260 (2001) or any earlier version of the variable account statute in which the legislature expressly promised to <i>continue</i> the variable account program. The majority draws the conclusion from that fact that the legislature thus reserved the right to repeal the variable account program at any time.</p>\n<p>I disagree. <i>None</i> of the components of the PERS contract, including the promised retirement formulas and public employer obligations, appears with a legislative promise that the legislature will not repeal them. The majority's reasoning departs from this court's decisions that examine retirement obligations from the standpoint of benefits offered. None of this court's cases has suggested that the absence of a promise of nonrepeal exposes a retirement plan benefit to withdrawal or cancellation.</p>\n<p>The fact that the legislature's cancellation was only prospective does not save it from an impairment of contract challenge. When the affected employees accepted employment, the variable account plan represented one available means for increasing the size of their regular accounts. As the foregoing discussion of the regular account challenge demonstrates, our cases decline to allow employers, once employment commences, to nullify aspects of a retirement plan that employees may use to enhance their service retirement benefit. For the reasons expressed in that discussion, the majority's contrary conclusion is erroneous.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, I respectfully dissent from the majority's conclusions regarding the legislature's amendment of the statutes regarding employee contributions to regular accounts and variable accounts, and concur, for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1127</span> the reasons stated, with the balance of the majority's conclusions.</p>\n<p>RIGGS and KISTLER, JJ., concur with this opinion.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  After the enactment of those bills, the legislature made further amendments to both, HB 3020 (2003); Or Laws 2003, ch 625, and later amended HB 2003 even further, HB 2020 (2003); Or Laws 2003, ch 733. With the final form of the substantive enactments now incorporated into the 2003 edition of the Oregon Revised Statutes, there are a number of sources from which to cite. In an effort to promote clarity, and unless to do so would detract from that purpose, we shall refer to the statutory provisions at issue by their designations in the session laws, <i>e.g.,</i>\"Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, section 1,\" and refer to the legislation as a whole as the \"2003 PERS legislation.\"</p>\n<p>[2]  The assumed earnings rate is the rate of investment return that the Public Employees Retirement Fund is assumed to earn over 50 to 75 years. That earnings assumption facilitates the calculation of the funding necessary to maintain the system on an actuarially sound basis. The assumption has changed from time to time. From 1975 through 1978, the assumed earnings rate was seven percent. In 1979, the Public Employees Retirement Board (PERB) increased the assumed earnings rate to seven and one-half percent. In 1989, PERB increased the rate again, this time to its current level of eight percent.</p>\n<p>[3]  A Tier One member is a PERS member who joined PERS before January 1, 1996.</p>\n<p>[4]  Article I, section 21, of the Oregon Constitution provides, in part:\n</p>\n<p>\"No * * * law impairing the obligation of contracts shall ever be passed[.]\"</p>\n<p>[5]  This is not the first instance in which the legislature has conferred jurisdiction specifically on this court to determine the validity of legislative or constitutional changes to PERS. In those prior instances, the \"rule of necessity\" required the court to adjudicate the claims. <i>See </i><i>Oregon State Police Officers' Assn. v.

To the extent that the justices of this court either have, or arguably could be said to have, a financial stake in the outcome of this litigation, we likewise conclude that the rule of necessity requires that we decide the contractual and constitutional challenges that the legislature has directed us to adjudicate.</p>\n<p>[6]  The number of parties and claims has narrowed during the pendency of these proceedings. We perceive of no benefit to the public, the bench, or the bar in explaining the evolution of these cases in detail.</p>\n<p>[7]  42 USC section 1983 provides, in part:\n</p>\n<p>\"Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress[.]\"</p>\n<p>[8]  Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 625, section 13(6), amended Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, section 10, to make that section applicable as well to \"the alternate payees and beneficiaries of members described in subsection (5) of this section.\"</p>\n<p>[9]  We discuss the <i>City of Eugene</i> litigation, which presently is under advisement in this court, later in our opinion. At this point, it suffices to note that the plaintiffs and the defendants (but not the intervenors) in that litigation have entered into a settlement agreement that provides, among other things, that PERB will not use the methods that section 14b specifies to remedy the errors that the trial court identified.</p>\n<p>[10]  For ease of reference, we use the present tense, recognizing that the 2003 PERS legislation has changed the system significantly. We have included citations to various PERS statutes in place before 2003 later in this opinion, in the course of analyzing petitioners' claims.</p>\n<p>[11]  PERB employs the PERS actuary to perform various statutory functions. <i>See, e.g.,</i> ORS 238.360(3)(b) (2001) (PERB shall arrange for actuarial services for PERS); ORS 238.605 (2001) (actuary shall prepare reports for PERB).</p>\n<p>[12]  PERB holds the fund assets in trust, which, as noted, OIC invests. Before the 2003 PERS legislation, OIC had five members: three members whom the Governor appointed, one of whom was required to be a PERB member; the State Treasurer; and the PERS director (appointed by PERB), who was a nonvoting member. ORS 293.706 (2001). OIC now has six members: the State Treasurer; the PERS director (still a nonvoting member); and four members whom the Governor appoints, none of whom is required to be a PERB member. ORS 293.706.</p>\n<p>[13]  ORS 238.015(1) provides:\n</p>\n<p>\"No person may become a member of the system unless that person is in the service of a public employer and has completed six months' service uninterrupted by more than 30 consecutive working days during the six months' period. Every employee of a participating employer shall become a member of the system at the beginning of the first full pay period of the employee following the six months' period. Contributions for new members shall first be made for those wages that are attributable to services performed by the employee during the first full pay period following the six months' period, without regard to when those wages are considered earned for other purposes under this chapter. All public employers participating in the Public Employees Retirement System established by chapter 401, Oregon Laws 1945, as amended, at the time of repeal of that chapter, and all school districts of the state, shall participate in, and their employees shall be members of, the system, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.\"</p>\n<p>[14]  PERB allocates earnings on variable accounts by first paying a proportionate share of administrative expenses and then crediting the remainder to members' variable accounts. PERB never has funded a reserve from variable account earnings.\n</p>\n<p>Historically, employer funds were not invested in the Variable Annuity Account. To the extent that that account outperformed the regular account, employers were required to contribute additional amounts to match those earnings. In 2000, employers began participating in the Variable Annuity Account.</p>\n<p>[15]  As noted later in this opinion, all petitioners who remain part of these cases are Tier One members of PERS, either active or retired. The summary offered below therefore primarily focuses on aspects of PERS that relate to Tier One members.</p>\n<p>[16]  In years in which the earnings on the fund equal or exceed the guaranteed earnings rate, PERB statutorily is required to \"set aside * * * such part of the income as [PERB] may deem advisable, not exceeding seven and one-half percent of the combined total of such income, which moneys so segregated shall remain in the fund and constitute therein a reserve account.\" ORS 238.670(1). Before 1980, PERB funded a contingency reserve account, as set out in that statute, but it has not done so since 1979.\n</p>\n<p>In 1969, PERB began investing the fund in equity markets. Since then, the actual earnings of the fund, overall, substantially exceeded the assumed earnings rate. Historically, PERB credited members' regular accounts with earnings in excess of the assumed earnings rate when fund earnings exceeded that rate.</p>\n<p>[17]  Between 1977 and 2001, PERS employer contribution rates ranged from a high of 11.84 percent to a low of 9.15 percent of payroll. Between 1975 and 1997, the average normal cost for employers ranged between 7.09 and 9.33 percent of payroll, and the average rate at which employers paid amortized UAL during that same period ranged from zero to 3.24 percent of payroll. The three highest UAL rates occurred between 1975 and 1979.</p>\n<p>[18]  Until 1997, PERB assumed that most member service retirement allowances would be calculated under the Full Formula. By that time, however, the Money Match had emerged as the dominant formula. We agree with the Special Master's finding that the Money Match became the primary formula for calculating service retirement allowances because of (1) the structure of PERS; (2) the dramatically fluctuating investment markets of the late 1990s and early 2000s; and (3) certain of PERB's administrative practices concerning reserves, earning allocations, and the variable annuity account program.</p>\n<p>[19]  As the Special Master noted in his report, those percentages, which commonly are referred to as \"replacement ratios,\" understate the extent to which service retirement allowances under PERS replace a member's preretirement salary, because, among other reasons, any Social Security benefits that a retired member may become eligible to receive are not included in the member's retirement income.</p>\n<p>[20]  We provide citations to the session laws respecting the particular provisions at issue later in the opinion.</p>\n<p>[21]  Member contributions are established by statute at six percent of salary and either are withheld from the member's salary or paid, that is, \"picked up,\" by the employer. The pick-up historically has been negotiated separately between public employers and employees.</p>\n<p>[22]  As noted above, before the enactment of the 2003 PERS legislation, PERB set aside a portion of annual fund earnings to ensure that sufficient assets would be available to pay guaranteed benefits at the assumed earnings rate. In years when fund earnings exceeded the guaranteed amount, PERB deposited a portion of those funds into the gain-loss reserve. According to the evidence in the record, it is reasonable to fund the gain-loss reserve at a level that would fund projected Tier One guaranteed earnings credits for a 30-month period, which, using the current assumed earnings rate of eight percent, would set the reserve balance at 20 percent of the fund's value.</p>\n<p>[23]  We discuss the 1999 crediting in greater detail later in this opinion. At this point, we note that the 11.33 percent figure on which the legislature focused derives from a calculation that the PERS actuary performed, after the fact, to determine the earnings crediting that would have occurred in 1999 if PERB had funded the contingency and gain-loss reserves fully and also had not allowed employers to participate in the Variable Annuity Account for that year.</p>\n<p>[24]  As explained later in this opinion, the term \"actuarial equivalency factors\" refers to computational tools used to convert lump sum account balances to monthly payment streams and to change one optional benefit payment form to another. They primarily are based on assumptions concerning future earnings or investments and mortality rates.</p>\n<p>[25]  The court noted, however, that the plaintiff in <i>Eckles</i> neither had sought compensation nor had produced any evidence that he had been damaged by the state's breach of contract. <i>Eckles,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1176322\"><a href=\"/opinion/1176322/eckles-v-state-of-oregon/\"><span class=\"volume\">306</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Or.</span> <span class=\"page\">380</span></a></span>, 402, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1176322\"><a href=\"/opinion/1176322/eckles-v-state-of-oregon/\"><span class=\"volume\">760</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">846</span></a></span> (1988).</p>\n<p>[26]  Petitioner Sartain entered into a stipulation with respondents to the effect that, with one exception, she would rely upon only statutory and administrative law sources as establishing the terms of her contract. The exception was for \"a document known as the `Notice of Entitlement' [that retired PERS members] receive upon retirement.\" Consistently with that stipulation, petitioner Sartain's opening brief focuses on statutory sources, but also includes the following footnote:\n</p>\n<p>\"The conduct of the PERS staff and PERB further confirms the contractual nature of the account balance and retirement allowance. At the time of petitioner Sartain's retirement, she was informed that her account balance was $289,633.41. * * * PERS sent her a Notice of Entitlement setting forth her balance and stating that her monthly retirement benefit would be $5,426.22.\"</p>\n<p>The footnote, however, contains no argument or authority that would support an implicit assertion that the conduct of PERB or its staff through issuance of the notice of entitlement somehow became part of the PERS contract. We therefore do not include petitioner Sartain's challenge in our discussion concerning the extent to which materials outside the PERS statutes (and applicable administrative rules) formed part of the PERS contract.</p>\n<p>[27]  Respondents offer additional argument to the contrary in their surreply brief. That advocacy, however, falls outside the appropriate scope of matters that properly may be addressed in surreply. Absent leave from this court, petitioners have the final word in reply as to issues in their case-in-chief. Accordingly, we have not considered respondents' surreply brief in that respect.</p>\n<p>[28]  As noted, with respect to the administrative rules concerning actuarial equivalency factors, all petitioners, except petitioner Sartain, argue that the legislature specifically delegated authority to PERB to adopt the rule at issue. We address that claim later in this opinion.</p>\n<p>[29]  <i>Taylor</i> involved a retirement plan for sworn law enforcement personnel of Multnomah County. <i>Taylor v. Mult. Dept. Sher. Ret.

Our summary of the parties' arguments and ensuing analysis likewise focuses, for the most part, on Tier One members.</p>\n<p>[31]  ORS 238.300 provides the various formulas for calculating service retirement allowances, and we discuss those formulas in greater detail below.</p>\n<p>[32]  As explained earlier, this court concluded in <i>OSPOA,</i> 323 Or. at 374-76, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1192606\"><a href=\"/opinion/1192606/oregon-police-officersassn-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">765</span></a></span>, that, as at issue in the context of that particular case, certain statutory contribution provisions (including the optional employer \"pick-up\") constituted terms of the PERS contract.</p>\n<p>[33]  Concerning the genesis of the Money Match, the Special Master noted as follows:\n</p>\n<p>\"In the mid-1950s, PERS was a Money Purchase Plan with an employer matching feature. In 1968, the Money Purchase Plan was repealed, and it was replaced with the Pension Plus Annuity benefit formula. PERB later recognized that one or two members who retired in the interim had received lower benefits than they would have received under the previous system and that such a reduction was not permissible under a retirement plan that is qualified under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). PERB asked the legislature to enact corrective legislation so that benefits earned by such members would be protected and, in response, the legislature reinstated the matching feature.\"</p>\n<p>[34]  Relatedly, we decline respondents' invitation to construe certain of the statutory provisions at issue  particularly, ORS 238.200 (2001), which required members to contribute six percent of their salaries to the fund, and ORS 238.250 (2001), which required (and still requires) PERB to provide a regular account for each member  in isolation. Rather, as we address petitioners' contentions, we must view the wording of all the statutory provisions at issue in the context of their collective operation. <i>See </i><i>Hughes,</i> 314 Or. at 23, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1155678\"><a href=\"/opinion/1155678/hughes-v-state-of-oregon/\"><span class=\"volume\">838</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1018</span></a></span> (rejecting state's argument as impermissibly viewing tax exemption at issue \"in isolation\" and as \"standing alone\").\n</p>\n<p>In a similar vein, we note that this court's earlier conclusion in <i>OSPOA,</i> 323 Or. at 374-76, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1192606\"><a href=\"/opinion/1192606/oregon-police-officersassn-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">765</span></a></span>, that the employer pick-up provisions are part of the PERS contract does not necessarily assist our analysis in this more complex case, which requires that we view all the statutes at issue as a whole.</p>\n<p>[35]  The 2003 Legislative Assembly amended ORS 238.300; however, those amendments do not affect the formula calculations that we discuss above. <i>See</i> Or. Laws 2003, ch. 67, § 4, <i>as amended by</i> Or. Laws 2003, ch. 625, § 22; Or. Laws 2003, ch. 733, § 46e.</p>\n<p>[36]  There is one exception to the Full Formula's design of providing a minimum level for a pension component, pertaining to an adjustment for members who participate in the variable annuity account program. That adjustment is not at issue in these cases.</p>\n<p>[37]  The 1953 act was entitled the \"Public Employe[e]s Retirement Act of 1953.\" Or. Laws 1953, ch. 200, § 1. The predecessor scheme, enacted in 1945 and similarly named the \"Public Employees Retirement Act,\" was similar, but not identical to, the 1953 act, eventually named PERS. <i>See</i> Or. Laws 1945, ch. 401 (enacting original act). For a general discussion of the relationship between the 1945 and 1953 acts, see <i>Hughes,</i> 314 Or. at 7 n. 7, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1155678\"><a href=\"/opinion/1155678/hughes-v-state-of-oregon/\"><span class=\"volume\">838</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1018</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>[38]  The 1953 act also provided an additional life pension for service before the employee became a member of the system. Or. Laws 1953, ch. 200, § 18.</p>\n<p>[39]  As respondents note, the 1981 Legislative Assembly also amended the graduated contribution rates for members based on salary, providing, instead, that the withholding for all members would be six percent unless the member made less than $1,000 per month, in which case less would be withheld. Or. Laws 1981, ch. 761, § 1; <i>former</i> ORS 237.071 (1981). As amended in 1981, that statute, now numbered as ORS 238.200, has remained substantially unchanged.</p>\n<p>[40]  In their reply brief, petitioners also argue that this court's decision in <i>Taylor,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">265</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Or.</span> <span class=\"page\">445</span></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1117036\"><a href=\"/opinion/1117036/taylor-v-multnomah-cty-deputy-sher-retire-bd/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">339</span></a></span>, \"is a much more pivotal case in this court's developing analysis of pension benefits than is <i>OSPOA</i>.\" In <i>Taylor,</i> which involved a county retirement system, the court acknowledged that \"contractual rights can arise prior to the completion of the service necessary to a pension.\" 265 Or. at 451, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1117036\"><a href=\"/opinion/1117036/taylor-v-multnomah-cty-deputy-sher-retire-bd/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">339</span></a></span>. Of course they can. The predicate question  which we determine to be dispositive in these cases  is whether the contract offer that the particular pension plan presents <i>contains</i> such a promise, <i>i.e.,</i> a promise that extends over the life of a covered member's service. And, in that respect, we find nothing inconsistent between <i>Taylor</i> and our analysis here.</p>\n<p>[41]  As noted, before January 1, 1996, PERS did not recognize classes of membership. <i>See</i> Or. Laws 1995, ch. 654, § 2 (providing limitation on benefits payable to persons establishing membership on or after January 1, 1996). In creating the \"tiers\" of membership in 1995, the legislature made what is now ORS 238.255 inapplicable to Tier Two PERS members. Or. Laws 1995, ch. 654, § 3.</p>\n<p>[42]  Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 625, section 10(5), now ORS 238.255(5), provides that the amendments to ORS 238.255 do not apply to a person who was a judge member of PERS on June 30, 2003.</p>\n<p>[43]  Petitioners do not rely on the amendments made to ORS 238.250 (2001) and ORS 238.610 (2001) during the 2003 legislative session (the legislature did not amend ORS 238.670 (2001)), and we agree that those amendments do not appear relevant to the arguments that petitioners make.</p>\n<p>[44]  In doing so, we choose not to revisit the court's holding in <i>OSPOA</i> that the legislature's promise to Tier One members of a guaranteed rate of return applies to work yet to be performed.</p>\n<p>[45]  As noted above, petitioners also cite ORS 238.250 (2001) (PERB shall provide members with regular accounts) and ORS 238.610 (2001) (employers responsible for covering difference when administrative expenses exceed annual fund earnings) as support for their argument. We, however, see nothing in those statutes that advances petitioners' assertion.</p>\n<p>[46]  For example, for that reason, PERB credited Tier One members' regular accounts with no earnings for 2003.</p>\n<p>[47]  As noted above, under Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 3, section 1, <i>as amended by</i> Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, section 5, <i>codified as</i> ORS 238.255(3), Tier One regular accounts will not be credited with earnings in excess of the assumed earnings rate until the gain-loss reserve no longer has a deficit and is fully funded as determined by PERB for three consecutive years. The validity of that legislation is not before us on review.</p>\n<p>[48]  As discussed at length further in this opinion, a particular crediting decision that PERB made in 1999 was challenged as part of the <i>City of Eugene</i> litigation.</p>\n<p>[49]  The legislature initially provided that members could contribute either 25 or 50 percent of their PERS contributions to the variable annuity account program. Or. Laws 1967, ch. 622, § 24(3). In 1973, the legislature increased the amount that members could direct to their variable accounts by adding the 75 percent option. Or. Laws 1973, ch. 695, § 5. Other than that change, and one other in 1981 that we discuss below, the substantive provisions of the statute have remained the same over time.</p>\n<p>[50]  Even after the 2003 PERS legislation, there is no need to rely on legislative history for that proposition. ORS 238.260(1) (2001) itself provided as follows:\n</p>\n<p>\"It is anticipated that investment of those contributions and portions of the member accounts in equities will result in the accumulation of larger deposit reserves for those members during their working years, tend to preserve the purchasing power of those reserves and the retirement benefits provided thereby and afford better protection in periods of economic inflation.\"</p>\n<p><i>See also</i> Or. Laws 1967, ch. 622, § 24(1) (enacting that wording).</p>\n<p>[51]  We do not deem the legislature's use of the words \"shall\" and \"on and after\" in ORS 238.260(3) (2001) to be indicative of a promise of a right to future contributions to the variable annuity account program. The import of the word \"shall\" is limited by its context-specifically, its reference to use of a PERB-approved form and to a particular effective date. Similarly, the words \"on and after\" merely clarify when the variable election takes effect.</p>\n<p>[52]  As noted, there is a dispute in the <i>City of Eugene</i> litigation as to that particular aspect of the variable annuity account program. The resolution of that dispute, however, does not impact our analysis in these cases.</p>\n<p>[53]  The Special Master made those findings based on evidence presented to, and findings made by, the trial court in the <i>City of Eugene</i> litigation, described in the text below.</p>\n<p>[54]  As noted, Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 537, section 1, granted this court \"exclusive jurisdiction to decide\" the <i>City of Eugene</i> litigation. We do not address here the merits of the trial court's judgment in that litigation. The issues that that case presents more appropriately will be addressed in our opinion in that case.</p>\n<p>[55]  We note that the particular sentence in Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, section 10(3), that precludes application of annual COLAs to \"fixed\" service retirement allowances was not amended by Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 625, section 13.</p>\n<p>[56]  The current versions of ORS 238.715(1) and (8) are identical to the 2001 versions of those provisions.</p>\n<p>[57]  As noted, in light of the pending <i>City of Eugene</i> litigation, PERB's 1999 crediting decision remained subject to reversal at the time that the legislature enacted the 2003 PERS legislation.</p>\n<p>[58]  Put another way, the legislature took what it deemed to be restorative action, but used as the mechanism for doing so an adjustment that implicated the COLA provision of the PERS contract. Our conclusion that that particular legislative action amounted to a breach of the PERS contract, however, implies nothing about PERB's  or, for that matter, the legislature's  authority to recover amounts determined to have been paid from the fund in error.</p>\n<p>[59]  Because the foregoing disposition returns petitioners to the <i>status quo ante,</i> that disposition obviates any need to consider petitioners' arguments that the temporary suspension of COLAs constitutes a taking of property under Article I, section 18, of the Oregon Constitution or their additional contractual and constitutional challenges to the \"revised\" service retirement allowance calculations set out in Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 67, section 10(2), <i>as amended by</i> Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 625, section 13.</p>\n<p>[60]  Since the inception of what is now PERS in 1945, the legislature has required the PERS actuary to \"prepare a report evaluating the current and prospective assets and liabilities of the system and indicating its current and prospective financial condition.\" ORS 238.605; <i>see</i> Or. Laws 1945, ch. 401, § 13 (stating same). The legislature further has required that, \"[i]n preparing the report[,] the actuary shall investigate the mortality, disability, service and other experience of the members of, and employers participating in the system, shall state fully the condition of the system, and shall make such recommendations as the actuary deems advisable to facilitate administering it properly.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>[61]  The United States Supreme Court also has held that that practice violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. <i>See </i><i>Arizona Governing Committee v. Norris,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111021\"><a href=\"/opinion/111021/arizona-governing-comm-for-tax-deferred-annuity-and-deferred-compensation/\"><span class=\"volume\">463</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1073</span></a></span>, 1084, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111021\"><a href=\"/opinion/111021/arizona-governing-comm-for-tax-deferred-annuity-and-deferred-compensation/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The 2003 Legislative Assembly renumbered the provision as ORS 238.630(3)(f) and amended it; that amendment is not at issue here.</p>\n<p>[66]  ORS 238.305 (1993) allowed (and still allows in amended form) retired members to select from a variety of \"optional\" service retirement allowance calculations, in addition to those set out in ORS 238.300.</p>\n<p>[67]  ORS 238A.005(2) now provides:\n</p>\n<p>\"`Actuarial equivalent' means a payment or series of payments having the same value as the payment or series of payments replaced, computed on the basis of interest rate and mortality assumptions adopted by [PERB].\"</p>\n<p>[68]  Those members \"established membership in PERS before January 1, 1999[.]\" OAR XXX-XXX-XXXX(5) (1996).</p>\n<p>[69]  Article I, section 20, of the Oregon Constitution provides that \"[n]o law shall be passed granting to any citizen or class of citizens privileges, or immunities, which, upon the same terms, shall not equally belong to all citizens.\"</p>\n<p>[1]  <i>Former</i> ORS 237.251(3) (1991), which was in effect when PERB adopted the rules in question, provided, in part:\n</p>\n<p>\"The board:</p>\n<p>\"(g) Shall determine the actuarial equivalency of optional forms of retirement allowances and establish from time to time for that purpose the necessary actuarial factors, which shall constitute a part of the system[.]\"</p>\n<p>That statute, renumbered as ORS 238.630(3)(g) in 1995, remained in effect without substantive modification until the legislature amended it by enacting Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 68, sections 2 and 4.</p>\n<p>[2]  The legislature acknowledged the inherent variability of the factors that influence the statistical determination of actuarial equivalency when it adopted the following statement as one of its premises for the enactment of House Bill 2004, which the legislature later codified as Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 68:\n</p>\n<p>\"Whereas actuarial equivalency factors are based on assumptions and conditions that vary over time as the demographics of a system's constituent population and the expected performance of investments of the Public Employees Retirement Fund change, so that the most reasonable expectation is that such factors, by their very nature, must vary over time to reflect those demographic and performance shifts * * *.\"</p>\n<p>[3]  This paragraph states the Full Formula.</p>\n<p>[4]  This paragraph states the Money Match formula.</p>\n<p>[5]  This paragraph states the Pension Plus Annuity formula.</p>\n<p>[6]  As the majority indicates, PERS, at its inception in 1945, provided for the creation of personal accounts into which the public employee would pay an amount actuarially determined to be sufficient, with earnings on the account balance, to provide one-half of the proposed retirement allowance (typically, at the time, 50% of final average salary). OCLA § 90-714. Upon retirement, the employee would receive an annuity based on the value of the personal account, and the public employer also would provide a similar annuity, for the other one-half of the proposed retirement allowance, by \"matching\" the amount in the employee's individual account. OCLA § 90-719. The level of the projected retirement benefit has increased over time, and the legislature has augmented the PERS system from time to time with various reserve features to provide stability during periods of loss. However, except for one two-year period over 35 years ago, the PERS system has retained the Money Match formula as one available method of retirement benefit calculation through the present time.</p>\n<p>[7]  ORS 238.200(1)(b) requires smaller salary contributions from employees who were active members on August 21, 1981.</p>\n<p>[8]  The court in <i>Taylor</i> selected the term \"unilateral contract\" on the assumption that the employees could accept the employer's offer by the tender of partial performance. The <i>Taylor</i> court's subsequent discussion of the binding effect of the tender of partial performance confirms that, in the employment context, partial performance terminates the employer's power to revoke the offer. Thus, one characteristic of a truly unilateral contract  the offeror's power to revoke the offer before the offeree tenders full performance  is not applicable in this setting.\n</p>\n<p>Moreover, the term \"unilateral contract\" may no longer provide a fully accurate conception of the factors that make the employment relationship binding. <i>Restatement (Second) of Contracts</i> § 32 (1981), which the American Law Institute adopted eight years after the <i>Taylor</i> decision, provides:</p>\n<p>\"In case of doubt an offer is interpreted as inviting the offeree to accept either by promising to perform what the offer requests or by rendering the performance, as the offeree chooses.\"</p>\n<p>Under that provision, unless the employer insists on performance as the sole mode of acceptance, the employee may bind the employer to its offer either by partially performing or promising to perform. In either case, a valid acceptance terminates the employer's power to revoke the offer.</p>\n\n</div>",
