This is a review of an\nunpublished court of appeals' opinion and order,1 which affirmed\n\nthe circuit court's order2 granting a writ of mandamus compelling\n\nthe   Wisconsin     Department   of   Justice    to    disclose       two    video\n\nrecordings requested by the Democratic Party of Wisconsin under\n\nWisconsin's Public Records Law, Wis. Stat. §§ 19.31-.39 (2013-\n\n      1\n       Democratic Party of Wis. v. DOJ, No. 2014AP2536-FT,\nunpublished slip op. (Wis. Ct. App. Oct. 14, 2015).\n      2\n          The Honorable Richard G.

We conclude that the reasons given by\n\nthe record custodian for nondisclosure sufficiently demonstrate\n\nthat the legislative presumption in favor of disclosure has been\n\noutweighed by the public harm that would result from disclosure.\n\nWe reverse the decision of the court of appeals and deny the\n\nwrit of mandamus.\n\n                                I.    BACKGROUND\n\n        ¶2    In September 2014, Cory Liebmann, Research Director\n\nfor     the   Democratic   Party     of    Wisconsin,    submitted     a   public\n\nrecords request to the Wisconsin Department of Justice.                       The\n\nrequest asked for the release of\n\n        [a]ny and all photographs, films, and tape recordings\n        including but not limited to computer tapes and\n        printouts, CDs, DVDs, videotapes and optical discs of\n        any presentation made at any training program by Brad\n        Schimel on the following dates: May 14, 2013; June 8,\n        2012; November 8, 2012, May 20, 2010; June 17, 2009.\n        ¶3    Kevin   Potter,   the       Department    of   Justice's     Record\n\nCustodian, responded to the request by letter in October 2014.\n\nPotter explained the DOJ had \"identified two records responsive\n\nto [Liebmann's] request:         one video recording of a presentation\n\nmade by Mr. Schimel on May 14, 2013 on the topic of victim\n\nconfidentiality and one video recording of a presentation on\n\nJune 17, 2009 concerning the prosecution of, and common defenses\n\n        3\n       All subsequent references to the Wisconsin Statutes are to\nthe 2013-14 version unless otherwise indicated.\n\n\n                                          2\n\f                                                                No.     2014AP2536-FT\n\n\n\nin   online       child    exploitation       cases.\"        Both     videos     were\n\nrecordings of presentations Attorney Schimel4 gave at Wisconsin\n\nState    Prosecutors       Education    and    Training      conferences.         The\n\nsubject matter of the 2013 conference was \"Protecting Victims of\n\nCrime\"     and     Attorney       Schimel's      segment     addressed      \"Victim\n\nConfidentiality.\"          Attorney Schimel's presentation at the 2009\n\nconference       addressed     \"Prosecution      [and]     Common     Defenses     in\n\nOnline    Child        Exploitation    Cases.\"       These    conferences        were\n\ntraining sessions for prosecutors and victims' rights advocates,\n\nwith some law enforcement representatives present.                       Attendance\n\nwas limited to those groups and not open to the public or the\n\nmedia.    The videos were not publicly available but were recorded\n\nand stored so that prosecutors who were not able to attend could\n\nview the educational training at a later date.5\n\n     ¶4        Potter     explained    that    neither     recording     would     be\n\nreleased because, after applying the public records balancing\n\ntest,     he     concluded     the    public     interest     in      nondisclosure\n\noutweighed       the    general   presumption     favoring    release.         Potter\n\n     4\n       During the pendency of this case, Attorney Schimel served\nas the Waukesha County District Attorney and later as Wisconsin\nAttorney General.      To avoid confusion, we refer to him\nthroughout as \"Attorney Schimel.\"        At the time of both\npresentations at issue, Attorney Schimel served as the Waukesha\nDistrict Attorney. At the time of the 2013 presentation, he was\nalso the Republican candidate for Wisconsin Attorney General in\na contested election, which he won in November 2014.\n     5\n       The presentations are not professionally recorded and the\nvideos are of low quality. As we understand it, a video camera\nwas set up and an attendee was asked to push \"record\" when the\npresentation started and to push \"stop\" when it ended.\n\n\n                                         3\n\f                                                                               No.     2014AP2536-FT\n\n\n\ngave   specific         reasons         for    his       conclusion       particular      to    each\n\nrecording, with some overlap.                        The 2009 recording would not be\n\nreleased      because          (1)       the        presentation          contained       specific\n\nlitigation         strategies           for     online         child     exploitation       cases,\n\ndisclosure      of      which       would      impede      effective          investigation      and\n\nprosecution        of     sexual        predators;         (2)    the     prosecutor      training\n\nprograms are similar to the contents of a prosecutor's case\n\nfiles, which are exempt from disclosure under                                    State ex rel.\n\nRichards v. Foust, 165 Wis. 2d 429, 477 N.W.2d 608 (1991); (3)\n\nthe    material         presented             may     be       privileged       attorney-client\n\ncommunication,              work     product         material,           or    both;     and     (4)\n\ndisclosure would adversely impact victims' rights.                                   The reasons\n\nfor    not   disclosing            the     2013      recording          included:         (1)   the\n\npresentation, which was part of a joint training program for\n\nprosecutors         and       crime      victim          staff,     discussed          prosecution\n\nstrategies      in      a    high-profile           sexual       extortion       case    involving\n\nhigh   school        students;          and    (2)       the     presentation        contained    a\n\nsubstantial amount of detail, which, if disclosed, would violate\nthe Wisconsin Constitution's Article I, § 9m provision requiring\n\nthat    crime      victims         be    treated          with    \"fairness,         dignity    and\n\nrespect      for     their         privacy.\"             The     recording      also     contained\n\n\"sufficient        details\"         that       \"could      lead     to    identification        and\n\ninvasion of privacy for young victims of a very sensitive series\n\nof crimes.\"         In addressing release of a redacted version, Potter\n\nexplained that doing so would render an \"end result meaningless\n\nto the viewer.\"\n\n\n                                                     4\n\f                                                                     No.    2014AP2536-FT\n\n\n\n       ¶5   Liebmann       and     the   Democratic        Party     petitioned      the\n\ncircuit court for a writ of mandamus seeking release of the\n\nrecords, punitive damages, and costs and attorney's fees.                            The\n\npetition asserted the withheld recordings may contain evidence\n\nof   misconduct     by     Attorney      Schimel:          \"Upon     information     and\n\nbelief, several or all of these tapes may include offensive\n\nracial remarks and ethnic slurs, including but not limited to\n\nstereotyped accents,            as well as sexist remarks, made by Mr.\n\nSchimel.\"\n\n       ¶6   After viewing both recordings in camera, the circuit\n\ncourt   concluded        neither    video       showed    misconduct       by   Attorney\n\nSchimel, but ordered both recordings disclosed.                            The circuit\n\ncourt felt the 2009 video presented a close question because it\n\ncontained strategies and techniques used in investigating and\n\nprosecuting sexual predators.               Nevertheless, the circuit court\n\nreasoned this video should be disclosed because the techniques\n\ndiscussed    were    \"widely       known\"    via    \"books,     magazine        articles,\n\n[and] TV shows.\"         It did not think the video contained \"any real\nsecrets\" and compared prosecuting sexual predators to playing\n\nhopscotch:       when     the    predators       find    ways   to   get    around   the\n\nState's techniques, the State has to catch up and find another\n\nway.    The circuit court was \"certain\" the strategies discussed\n\n\"are    taught      in    law      enforcement          academies,     FBI      training\n\nacademies, et cetera.\"             The circuit court decided that parents\n\nneeded to see the 2009 video so they could better protect their\n\nchildren from sexual predators.                 The circuit court specifically\n\n\n                                            5\n\f                                                                     No.    2014AP2536-FT\n\n\n\nacknowledged that the 2009 video did not involve \"misconduct on\n\nthe part of any of the presenters.\"\n\n      ¶7     With   respect       to   the   2013     video,      the    circuit     court\n\nreasoned disclosure was required because (1) the video did not\n\ncontain     specifically      identifiable          names    of    victims;    (2)    the\n\nvictims' responses to the sex extortion, described by Attorney\n\nSchimel in the video, were \"perfectly natural responses to the\n\nhorrific crimes that these children were subject to,\" and no one\n\nshould be surprised by the \"traumatic effects\" these children\n\nsuffered; (3) this information is important for members of the\n\npublic to know so they can protect their children; and (4) many\n\nof the details discussed in the video were in the original case\n\nfile and had previously been \"splattered all over the Internet.\"\n\nThe   circuit       court    did       recognize      that        re-disclosing      this\n\ninformation now may \"distress\" and re-traumatize the victims,\n\nbut   the   court    did     not   believe         such   factors       outweighed    the\n\npublic's right to \"know the contents of these tapes.\"\n\n      ¶8     In a summary disposition opinion and order, the court\nof appeals affirmed the circuit court's decision.                           Release of\n\nthe two recordings at issue has been stayed during the appeal\n\nprocess.     In addition, the DOJ allowed the attorney representing\n\nthe Democratic Party to view both the 2009 and 2013 videos,\n\nsubject to a protective order.                   After viewing the videos twice,\n\ncounsel     abandoned       any    claim     that     the     videos       contain    any\n\nmisconduct by Attorney Schimel.

Applicable Law\n\n      ¶10    Wisconsin is firmly committed to open and transparent\n\ngovernment,       as    evidenced         by    the   policy     expressed          by   the\n\nlegislature in our Public Records Law:\n\n      [I]t is declared to be the public policy of this state\n      that all persons are entitled to the greatest possible\n\n                                               7\n\f                                                               No.     2014AP2536-FT\n\n\n      information regarding the affairs of government and\n      the official acts of those officers and employees who\n      represent them . . . .   To that end, ss. 19.32 to\n      19.37 shall be construed in every instance with a\n      presumption of complete public access, consistent with\n      the conduct of governmental business.   The denial of\n      public access generally is contrary to the public\n      interest, and only in an exceptional case may access\n      be denied.\nWis. Stat. § 19.31.       Wisconsin law does recognize three types of\n\nexceptions to this general policy of open access:                    (1) statutory\n\nexceptions; (2) common law exceptions; and (3) public policy\nexceptions.     See Hempel, 284 Wis. 2d 162, ¶28.                 When a public\n\nrecords request is made, the record custodian must determine\n\nwhether the Public Records Law applies.              If the law applies, the\n\npresumption favors disclosure of the record.               Id.       The next step\n\nis to determine whether any exceptions operate to overcome the\n\ngeneral     presumption   of     openness.       Id.      \"[T]he       legislature\n\nentrusted the records custodian with substantial discretion\" in\n\nmaking this determination.         Id., ¶62.\n\n      ¶11    Exceptions    to     the   public       records      law's      general\n\npresumption of disclosure exist because some requests conflict\n\nwith other important policy considerations.                    Id.,       ¶28.     The\ncustodian must conduct \"the open records disclosure analysis on\n\na case-by-case basis.\"          Id., ¶62.    If a statutory or common law\n\nexception applies, the analysis ends and the records will not be\n\ndisclosed.     Id.   If neither applies, the custodian proceeds to\n\nthe public policy balancing test, which requires a consideration\n\nof all relevant factors to determine whether the public interest\nin   nondisclosure   outweighs      the     public     interest      in    favor   of\n\n\n                                        8\n\f                                                                          No.     2014AP2536-FT\n\n\n\ndisclosure.         Id., ¶63.          The test considers whether disclosure\n\nwould cause public harm to the degree that the presumption of\n\nopenness is overcome.\n\n       ¶12    This       case   does    not     involve        any   of     the      statutory\n\nexceptions         set    forth   in    Wis.       Stat. §§ 19.31-.39.                The     DOJ\n\nasserts      one    common      law    exception:             prosecutorial          files    are\n\nexempt as recognized in Foust.                     This court in Foust held that\n\n\"prosecutorial files are exempt from public access\" as a common\n\nlaw exception even after the case is closed.                           Id. at 430, 433-\n\n34.     In doing so, we explained that investigations and data\n\ncollected are not open for public viewing because disclosure of\n\nthis information would be \"harmful to the orderly administration\n\nof justice.\"         Id. at 435-36.        We listed multiple reasons for our\n\nconclusion, including the discretion afforded to prosecutors and\n\nthe fact that their files \"may contain historical data leading\n\nup to the prosecution which may be in the form of anonymous\n\nstatements,              informants'          statements,            or         neighborhood\n\ninvestigations at the scene of the crime.\"                           Id. at 434-35.            We\nnoted   that       this    material     needs      to    be    protected        in    order    to\n\nensure that the public will continue to cooperate in criminal\n\ninvestigations.

Our concern was not for the individual teacher's\n\nembarrassment but for \"the public effects of the failure to\n\nhonor the individual's privacy interests.\"                     Id.    We also quoted\n\nthe exemptions set forth in the Freedom of Information Act, 5\n\nU.S.C. § 552(b)(7) (2000), and said that \"when coupled with our\n\nprior caselaw,\" FOIA \"factors provide a framework that records\n\ncustodians         can    use   to    determine      whether   the    presumption      of\n\nopenness      in    law    enforcement         records    is   overcome     by    another\n\npublic policy.\"           Linzmeyer, 254 Wis. 2d 306, ¶33.                 As pertinent\n\nhere, the Freedom of Information Act exempts records that \"would\n\ndisclose       techniques            and     procedures      for   law      enforcement\n\ninvestigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for\n\nlaw       enforcement       investigations           or     prosecutions         if   such\n\ndisclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of\n\nthe law.\"          Id., ¶32 (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(E)).6                        The\nthreat      that    releasing        a     record   would   reveal    techniques      and\n\nprocedures used in \"a sting or undercover operation that would\n\n\n      6\n       The Freedom of Information Act applies to federal records\nand therefore is not controlling in Wisconsin Public Records\ncases, but as Linzmeyer and other Wisconsin cases have\nrecognized, FOIA and the cases interpreting it can be used as\npersuasive authority in deciding Wisconsin Public Records cases.\nSee Linzmeyer v.

Linzmeyer, 254 Wis. 2d 306, ¶41.\n\n    ¶14     This case also involves a very important public policy\n\nconsideration——of constitutional dimension——with respect to the\n\ntreatment      of    crime    victims     in     Wisconsin.          The     Wisconsin\n\nConstitution        specifically   provides:           \"This    state   shall       treat\n\ncrime victims, as defined by law, with fairness, dignity and\n\nrespect for their privacy.\"              Wis. Const. art. I, § 9m.                   This\n\npolicy    is   further       embodied    in     Wis.    Stat.    § 950.04(1v)(ag)7\n\ngoverning rights of crime victims and Wis. Stat. § 950.055(1)8\n\ngoverning      rights    of    juvenile        crime    victims.        This        court\n\nrecognizes \"that justice requires that all who are engaged in\n\n    7\n         Wisconsin Stat. § 950.04(1v) provides, in part:\n\n    RIGHTS OF VICTIMS.

The\n\npublic policy interest in protecting the privacy of victims of\n\ncrime——especially children affected by very sensitive crimes——\n\nweighs heavily in favor of nondisclosure.\n\n      ¶15    Having set forth the relevant framework, we now turn\n\nto an analysis of the 2009 and 2013 recordings.\n\n                                       C.

Attorney         Schimel       shared           the     specific\n\nstrategies     and      techniques      he       used,       and    he    provided          numerous\n\ncase-specific examples, even on occasion referring to the cases\nby   name.        There    is    no     doubt         that    this       recording          contains\n\nspecific      techniques         and        procedures             for     law         enforcement\n\ninvestigations and prosecutions in Wisconsin.                                  The question is\n\nwhether,     because      of    this,       application            of    the    balancing       test\n\nmakes    the       2009        video        an        exceptional          case            justifying\n\nnondisclosure.

We\n\nreview      whether    the    custodian             considered    \"all        the     relevant\n\nfactors.\"     Hempel, 284 Wis. 2d 162, ¶63.\n\n      ¶18    Attorney       Schimel       is    an    elected     official,          and    this\n\nfactor    weighs      in    favor    of     disclosure.           See    Linzmeyer,          254\n\nWis. 2d 306, ¶29.           The content of the 2009 video, however, and\n\nits potentially harmful impact on the public interest weighs\n\nstrongly in favor of nondisclosure.                        In the video, Attorney\n\nSchimel discusses tactics and strategies used by law enforcement\n\nand   prosecutors      to    catch     and      convict     criminals         who     prey    on\n\nminors.      The techniques discussed involve undercover and sting\n\noperations to catch criminals who use computers to victimize\n\nchildren.      The presentation occurred at a confidential training\n\nsession for prosecutors and victims' right advocates, with some\n\npolice      representatives         present.9           Public    records           containing\nprosecution strategies and police tactics are not specifically\n\nexcepted     from     disclosure       by      Wisconsin        statutes,       but     record\n\n\n      9\n       The Democratic Party argues the training seminars were\nopen to the defense bar, pointing to two names of attorneys on\nthe attendee list currently doing criminal defense work.     This\nargument fails to recognize the reality of the underlying facts.\nAt the time of the presentations, those attorneys attended the\nseminar in their capacity as prosecutors.     The fact that they\nleft their jobs as prosecutors and now represent criminal\ndefendants does not change the nature of the training seminars.\n\n\n                                               13\n\f                                                                           No.        2014AP2536-FT\n\n\n\ncustodians can properly consider such content when determining\n\n\"whether       the       presumption       of     openness . . . is              overcome        by\n\nanother public policy,\" see Linzmeyer, 254 Wis. 2d 306, ¶¶32-33,\n\nand as noted, the federal Freedom of Information Act lists this\n\ntype of record as exempt \"if such disclosure could reasonably be\n\nexpected      to     risk    circumvention           of    the    law\"    and     protects       it\n\nstatutorily from disclosure, see 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(E).\n\n       ¶19    The reason for protecting prosecutorial techniques and\n\nlocal police strategies is obvious:                          if local criminals learn\n\nthe    specific          techniques    and      procedures         used     by    police        and\n\nprosecutors,         the     disclosed          information         could        be     used     to\n\ncircumvent         the    law.       The   content          of    the    2009    video      falls\n\nsquarely into this category.                    Releasing this video would create\n\na significant risk that specific techniques and strategies being\n\nused    in    Wisconsin       could    instantly            be    disseminated          over    the\n\ninternet and exploited by sexual predators.                               This information\n\nwould    in    essence       serve    as   a     textbook         enlightening          Wisconsin\n\ncriminals on how to avoid detection, elude capture, and escape\nconviction.          The harm arising from release would substantially\n\nimpair       the    ongoing      battle      police         and    prosecutors           face    in\n\nprotecting children and would impede efforts made to catch and\n\nprosecute sexual predators who lurk in the shadows and anonymity\n\nof    internet       websites.        Although            disclosing      this    information\n\ndirectly to the Democratic Party alone would not necessarily be\n\nharmful, releasing the 2009 video to one effectively renders it\n\npublic to all, including anyone plotting to use it to circumvent\nthe law.

Releasing the 2009 video would frustrate the public\n\npolicy of investigating and prosecuting criminal activity that\n\nin this instance would cause considerable public harm, which\n\noverwhelmingly outweighs any public interest in viewing it.                              See\n\nLinzmeyer, 254 Wis. 2d 306, ¶39.\n\n       ¶20    Drawing on reasons the circuit court used in ordering\n\ndisclosure, the Democratic Party asserts:                      (1) the video would\n\nbe helpful to parents              trying to protect their children from\n\npredators, and (2) the techniques discussed on the video are not\n\nnovel, do not contain any secrets, and are widely known, often\n\nseen on television shows.                  The Democratic Party's arguments,\n\nlike   the    circuit      court's    reasons,         are   flawed    and     erroneous.\n\nThis   video        is   replete    with    police       and   prosecutor          tactics,\n\nspecific      instances      of    cases        with   descriptive          details,     and\n\npractical strategies to gather evidence.                     This content would not\n\nassist the average parent.\n       ¶21    The Democratic Party's assertion that the techniques\n\nand strategies are so widely known that disclosure would not be\n\nharmful      is   equally    questionable.             There   is     no    rule    of   law\n\nprotecting only brand new or novel prosecution techniques and\n\npolice strategies, and there is no evidence that releasing local\n\nstrategies will not lead to circumvention of the law simply\n\nbecause      they    are   also    seen    on    television     crime       shows.       The\n\nDemocratic Party does not cite any authority to support its\n\"novel\" argument, and when directly asked for authority for this\n                                            15\n\f                                                                        No.   2014AP2536-FT\n\n\n\nproposition        during       oral      argument,       the        Democratic    Party's\n\nattorney was unable to provide any.                       Although child predators\n\nmay    know   in     general      terms     various     techniques       taught    to    and\n\nemployed by police departments across the country, the specific\n\ntechniques used by police officers in a particular jurisdiction\n\nor geographic area are not necessarily a matter of common public\n\nknowledge.         A criminal who knows the specific techniques being\n\nused    locally      is    much    more     likely     to      evade    capture    than    a\n\ncriminal      who,    after     viewing      a    crime     show,      guesses    at    what\n\ntechniques local police and prosecutors are using.\n\n       ¶22    Another      factor      to    balance      in    these     cases    is    the\n\npresence of \"official cover-up\" by public officials.                               Hempel,\n\n284 Wis. 2d 162, ¶68.             \"The public has a very strong interest in\n\nbeing informed about public officials who have been derelict in\n\ntheir    duty.\"           Id.     Everyone        in   this     case,     including      the\n\nDemocratic Party, agrees that the video does not contain any\n\nevidence of misconduct.             Because the video reveals no misconduct\n\nor dereliction of duty, this factor does not counter the strong\npublic policies supporting nondisclosure.\n\n       ¶23    Additionally,        the      context    of      the    records'    request,\n\nalthough not always relevant, should be considered here.                                 See\n\nid., ¶66 (\"When performing a balancing test, however, a records\n\ncustodian      almost       inevitably       must      evaluate        context    to    some\n\ndegree.\").      The Public Records Law does not require a requestor\n\nto disclose his or her identity or to state a purpose for the\n\nrequest.      See Wis. Stat. § 19.35(1)(i).                    But by asserting that,\n\"[u]pon information and belief, several or all of these tapes\n                                             16\n\f                                                                         No.    2014AP2536-FT\n\n\n\nmay include offensive racial remarks and ethnic slurs, including\n\nbut   not    limited      to   stereotyped        accents,         as    well    as    sexist\n\nremarks, made by Mr. Schimel,\" the language of the Democratic\n\nParty's petition for a writ of mandamus suggests a partisan\n\npurpose underlying the request.                   During a contested election,\n\nthe     request     sought       records     containing            allegedly       offensive\n\ncomments     made    by    the    candidate       from       the     opposing     political\n\nparty.      And the Democratic Party persists in its pursuit of the\n\nrecords, despite the fact that its attorney has now viewed the\n\nrecordings and the parties agree the recordings contain no such\n\noffensive content.          When weighed against the likely harm to law\n\nenforcement's efforts to capture and convict sexual predators\n\nwho target children, the counterfactual justification offered\n\nfor   the    request       clearly    does       not    tip     the      balance      towards\n\noverturning the record custodian's decision.\n\n      ¶24    In applying the balancing test to the 2009 video, we\n\nconclude     that    the    public     interest         in    preventing        release     of\n\nspecific police and prosecution strategies and techniques being\ntaught and used in Wisconsin outweighs the general legislative\n\npresumption that public records should be disclosed.                               We are a\n\nState    committed     to      open   and    transparent           government,        but   if\n\ndisclosure results in greater public harm than nondisclosure,\n\nthe scale must tip in favor of nondisclosure, especially when\n\nsexual exploitation of vulnerable children is at risk.                                Because\n\nthe 2009 video consists almost entirely of police tactics and\n\nspecific     prosecution         strategies        in    cases          involving      sexual\nexploitation      of   children,       disclosure            would    result     in    public\n                                            17\n\f                                                         No.    2014AP2536-FT\n\n\n\nharm.      The public policy factors favoring nondisclosure thus\n\novercome the presumption in favor of disclosure.                The record\n\ncustodian gave specific reasons for the decision not to disclose\n\nthe   2009   recording,   and   we   conclude   the   reasons   given   were\n\nlegally sufficient and sound.10\n\n      10\n       While excerpts of the recording may fall beyond the\npublic policy considerations favoring nondisclosure, which\nordinarily results in the release of a redacted version under\nWis. Stat. § 19.36(6), our viewing of the recording validates\nthe custodian's assessment that a redacted version would be\nmeaningless to the viewer.     See John C. v. Martha A., 592\nN.Y.S.2d 229, 235-36 (Civ. Ct. 1992) (where \"entire court file\nis permeated with confidential\" information, no part can be\nopened for viewing); cf. Am. Civil Liberties Union v. Dep't of\nDefense, 543 F.3d 59, 84 (2d Cir. 2008) (affirming district\ncourt order releasing certain redacted photographs depicting\nabuse of detainees at military prison, but mentioning without\nobjection that \"[w]here 'individual recognition could not be\nprevented without redaction so extensive as to render the images\nmeaningless,' the court ordered those photographs to be\nwithheld\"), vacated on other grounds 558 U.S. 1042 (noting\nintervening change in federal law); Harwood v. McDonough, 799\nN.E.2d 859, 866-70 (Ill. App. Ct. 2003) (affirming withholding\nof report under Illinois open records law where trial court\n\"concluded that plaintiff was not entitled to a redacted\nreport . . . if the result of the redaction was a document\nconsisting of blank pages, along with meaningless pronouns and\narticles such as the words 'and,' 'or,' 'but,' etc.\");\nKestenbaum v.

Attorney      Schimel        recounted         the     background,      the\n\ninvestigation, the charging decisions, the attempt to keep the\n\nvictims' identities confidential, the impact on the case when a\n\nbreach of that confidentiality revealed the identity of all of\n\nthe   victims,     the    negative        effects      the    disclosure       of    the\n\nidentities     caused,     and      his     thoughts         and    strategies       for\n\nprosecution.\n\n      ¶26   Before we apply the balancing test, we analyze whether\n\nthe common law exception to disclosure for a prosecutor's case\n\nfiles, discussed in Foust, applies to these facts.                         See Foust,\n\n165 Wis. 2d at 433-35.            Foust held that a district attorney's\n\nclosed files were not subject to the Public Records Law based on\n\nthe broad discretion a district attorney has in charging, the\n\nconfidential nature of the contents of a file, and the threat\ndisclosure poses to the orderly administration of justice.                          Id.\n\n      ¶27   The    2013   video,     of    course,      is    not    a    prosecutor's\n\ntypical paper case file.            Rather, the record is an oral, in-\n\ndepth presentation by Attorney Schimel, who was the prosecutor\n\nin charge of the sex extortion case discussed.                      Attorney Schimel\n\nVermilion, 2012-Ohio-5320, ¶19, 980 N.E.2d 975)).     Meaningless\nredaction is particularly applicable here where the records\nconsist of video recordings. The nondisclosable content on the\nvideos permeates the recordings, making redaction futile.\n\n\n                                          19\n\f                                                                           No.    2014AP2536-FT\n\n\n\nshared his thought processes for charging and walked through the\n\ncase from the beginning to the end.                           The presentation is in\n\ngreat respect the oral equivalent of a prosecutor's closed case\n\nfile.   The same rationale asserted in Foust to protect closed\n\nprosecutorial case files from disclosure under public records\n\nrequests applies to the video here.                         Attorney Schimel's oral\n\npresentation       included     his    analysis         and    impressions          regarding\n\ncharging     and    how    to    charge,         a    concept        Foust       labeled     as\n\nconfidential.       Foust, 165 Wis. 2d at 433-35.                         The presentation\n\nalso addressed issues relating to confidentiality of victims'\n\nidentities    and     statements,        which        parallels           Foust's    concerns\n\nabout anonymous statements and informants' statements.                                See id.\n\nat   435.     Attorney         Schimel      discussed         what    would       equate    to\n\n\"historical data leading up to the prosecution,\" which Foust\n\nexpressed    should       be   protected         from    public       disclosure.           Id.\n\nBased on these similarities, it would be illogical to conclude\n\nthat a paper accounting of a district attorney's discretionary\n\nprocesses must be kept confidential but an oral accounting of\nthe same, given in a confidential setting, need not.                                It is the\n\nnature of the record, rather than its form or location that\n\nmatters.      See     Nichols,        199    Wis. 2d at         270,       274-75.

The\n\nsubstance of this 2013 video contains the same discretionary\n\ncontent    found       in    a    prosecutor's            file;    therefore,              the    Foust\n\ncommon     law    exception             renders         the     2013     video       exempt        from\n\ndisclosure under Wisconsin's Public Records Law.\n\n    ¶28        Our analysis could end here because the common law\n\nexception applies.            This case, however, involves a public policy\n\nconsideration of constitutional significance, and we therefore\n\nchoose    to     proceed         to     an    application         of     the     public          policy\n\nbalancing test.             First, again, Attorney Schimel is a public\n\nofficial, a factor weighing in favor of disclosure.                                   Second, the\n\ncontent of the video, like the 2009 video, contains prosecution\n\nstrategies       and   law       enforcement            tactics,       which,        as     Linzmeyer\n\nexplains,      weighs       in    favor       of    nondisclosure.              See        Linzmeyer,\n\n¶¶32-33.       Third, the 2013 video discusses the victims of the sex\n\nextortion      case     and      the     devastating            impact    of     these        crimes,\nespecially       after       the        victims'         identities        were       discovered.\n\nWisconsin's constitutional commitment to the fair treatment of\n\nvictims and their privacy rights, together with this court's\n\ncommitment to minimizing victims' suffering, weigh in favor of\n\nnondisclosure.          Although we cannot always protect victims from\n\nre-traumatization           or        additional         suffering,       the        circumstances\n\nhere clearly allow us to do so.\n\n    ¶29        Although we review the record custodian's decision, we\nbriefly explain why the four reasons the circuit court gave for\n                                                   21\n\f                                                                    No.    2014AP2536-FT\n\n\n\noverturning      the     custodian's           decision      are    inadequate         and\n\nerroneous.      We do so because the Democratic Party relies on the\n\ncircuit court's reasoning to advance its position that the 2013\n\nvideo should be disclosed.                First, the fact that no specific\n\nnames   are    used     on    the    video     does    not    render      the    victims\n\nunidentifiable.              Disclosing       the     recording     would       reignite\n\ninterest in the case and allow identification in the same way it\n\noccurred the first time around.                     There is sufficient factual\n\ndetail in the recording to easily connect the dots to identify\n\nthe dozens of victims, who would be re-traumatized should this\n\ncase result in a repeat exposure of their identities almost a\n\ndecade after these events occurred.                   Disclosure leading to re-\n\nvictimization       would     run     afoul    of     Wisconsin's      constitutional\n\ncommitment     to   treating         victims    with     \"fairness,       dignity      and\n\nrespect for their privacy.\"             Wis. Const. art. I, § 9m.               Further,\n\nthe victims involved here were all child victims who deserve\n\nspecial treatment and protection with an emphasis on keeping\n\ntheir identities confidential, \"especially in sensitive cases.\"\nSee Wis. Stat. § 950.055(1).              This court will \"make every effort\n\nto minimize further suffering by crime victims.\"                      Schilling, 278\n\nWis. 2d 216, ¶26.\n\n    ¶30       Second,    the        circuit     court's      reasoning         that    the\n\nvictims' reactions to the crimes were \"perfectly natural\" and\n\nwould not be surprising to anyone is not a relevant factor in\n\nweighing   disclosure         over    nondisclosure.          Whether      a    victim's\n\nreaction is natural or excessive should not be a justification\nfor re-traumatizing child victims of sensitive crimes.                                What\n                                          22\n\f                                                                          No.     2014AP2536-FT\n\n\n\nmust be considered is whether the victims will be re-traumatized\n\nby renewed suffering as a result of an additional violation of\n\ntheir privacy.\n\n     ¶31     Third,       the    rationale         that       disclosure         would       help\n\nparents      protect      their        children        from    sexual          predators       is\n\nunconvincing.           Although this video may contain limited helpful\n\ninformation on this topic, many other useful resources exist for\n\nparents but do not present the same threat of harm to victims.\n\nThe DOJ makes available online materials helpful to concerned\n\nparents.11     Local schools, communities, and police departments\n\nalso offer a variety of helpful resources and seminars.12\n\n     ¶32     Fourth,      the    fact    that      a    significant           amount    of    the\n\ninformation        discussed      in    the    recording           had    been     previously\n\ndisseminated seven or eight years ago, although \"germane to the\n\nbalancing test\" see Linzmeyer, 254 Wis. 2d 306, ¶37, does not\n\nrequire disclosure.              This information was disclosed almost a\n\ndecade ago.        As presented in the affidavit submitted by Jill J.\n\nKarofsky,     Executive         Director      of   the    Office         of     Crime    Victim\nServices,     re-disclosing        the       details     of    a    case      typically       re-\n\ntraumatizes victims.

It is not unreasonable——indeed,\n\nit comports with common sense——to expect additional harm will be\n\ninflicted on the victims every time a case such as this is\n\npublicized, especially if done in a high-profile way such as a\n\nlawsuit that is pursued through all three levels of Wisconsin's\n\ncourt system with much media attention.                  Moreover, releasing the\n\n2013 video creates a real risk that future victims will not\n\nreport       crimes    and     will    not      cooperate       with     prosecutors.\n\nEffective        prosecution    depends      upon    victims    reporting       in   the\n\nfirst instance and cooperating until the end of the case.13\n\n       ¶33       In balancing the equally important public policies of\n\nopenness         of   public     records        against     the        constitutional\n\ndeclaration demanding protection and fair treatment of victims,\n\ncoupled with the need for victim reporting and cooperation in\n\norder       to   identify    lawbreakers,      we    conclude     that    the   Public\n\nRecords Law did not require the record custodian to release the\n\n2013    video.        The    video    contains      no   misconduct      or   evidence\n\n\n       13\n       This case is not about protecting an individual's privacy\ninterest like in Linzmeyer, where the teacher objected to the\nrelease of a police report generated during an investigation of\npossible inappropriate actions between the teacher and some\nstudents.   See Linzmeyer, 254 Wis. 2d 306, ¶31 (observing that\nthe public interest in protecting the reputation and privacy of\ncitizens is \"not equivalent to an individual's personal interest\nin protecting his or her own character and reputation\").\nRather, the case before this court is about the public interest\nin protecting the reputation and privacy of crime victims and\nthe concomitant public policy that such protection will\nencourage victims to report crimes and cooperate in prosecution\nof criminals.\n\n\n                                          24\n\f                                                                    No.    2014AP2536-FT\n\n\n\nshowing      dereliction      of    duty.        Rather,    it     contains   an     oral\n\naccount of the prosecution of a high school student who sexually\n\nextorted       dozens   of    his    fellow       students.        The    account     was\n\npresented      at   a   confidential        prosecutor      training      seminar,    and\n\naside from the general presumption favoring disclosure, it has\n\nlittle public value.            Disclosure would provide the public with\n\nAttorney Schimel's mental processes and thoughts with respect to\n\na sex extortion case he prosecuted many years ago.                         Contrary to\n\nFoust, releasing the video would give the public insight into\n\nAttorney       Schimel's      discretionary        charging      decisions,    and     it\n\nwould likely reignite the public and media outrage associated\n\nwith   the     crimes    at    issue      here.      It    would    undoubtedly       re-\n\ntraumatize and harm the             victims who were minors at the time of\n\nthese crimes, and its disclosure would send a strong message to\n\ncrime victims that the continued pain that sometimes accompanies\n\nthe pursuit of justice does not end——even when a prosecution is\n\ncomplete and the case is closed.                    The balancing test clearly\n\nweighs    in    favor    of   nondisclosure        and     strongly      overcomes    the\npresumption favoring disclosure.\n\n                                   III.    CONCLUSION\n\n       ¶34     Wisconsin and this court are firmly committed to open\n\nand transparent government.               The denial of public access occurs\n\nonly in exceptional cases.                  This case presents one of those\n\nexceptional situations.             The two videos requested here do not\n\ncontain any evidence of official misconduct.                     The circuit court,\n\nthe court of appeals, this court, and the Democratic Party all\nagree on this point.            Both the 2009 and 2013 videos arise from\n                                            25\n\f                                                                       No.    2014AP2536-FT\n\n\n\nconfidential      prosecutors'         training        sessions,      and    both    videos\n\ncontain     instruction         on      prosecutorial          strategies          and     law\n\nenforcement tactics.            The 2013 recording is an accounting of a\n\nsingle case and the functional equivalent of a prosecutor's case\n\nfile, which is exempt from disclosure under Foust.                            Further, it\n\ncontains information, which, if released, would harm the public\n\ninterest     by   re-traumatizing         the     victims       and    violating         their\n\nprivacy rights, contrary to the policies enshrined in our state\n\nconstitution, statutes, and case law.                    In applying the balancing\n\ntest    required     by    Wis.      Stat.    § 19.35(1)(a),           the    DOJ    record\n\ncustodian     gave      specific      reasons     for     nondisclosure,           and     our\n\nreview independently demonstrates that the reasons proffered are\n\nsufficient and supported by the facts in this case.                            We reverse\n\nthe    decision    of     the   court    of     appeals       and   deny     the    writ    of\n\nmandamus.\n\n       By   the   Court.—The         decision     of    the    court    of    appeals       is\n\nreversed.\n\n\n\n\n                                             26\n\f                                                                No.   2014AP2536-FT.ssa\n\n\n     ¶35    SHIRLEY     S.

The\n\nwhole discussion that releasing the 2009 video would create a\n\nsignificant risk is ipse dixit; that is, there is a significant\n\npublic       risk   to     effective       law    enforcement      only        because       the\n\nDepartment of Justice and the majority opinion say so.                                Majority\n\nop., ¶¶19, 20.\n\n       ¶76     The law enforcement interest that the Department of\n\nJustice       and    the     majority        opinion       identify         (but      do     not\n\ndemonstrate)        does    not    overcome        the   statutory         presumption        of\nopenness      in    the    instant     case.        In   any     event,       the     majority\n\nopinion should not be read as adopting a per se rule that any\n\ntime a requested record implicates any law enforcement technique\n\nor    prosecutorial        strategy,       the    record    will      be      withheld      from\n\npublic view.        Indeed, the Department of Justice's brief explains\n\nthat    it    is    not    asking    for     any    sort    of     blanket         exception.\n\nRather,       the   Department       of     Justice's       position          is     that   law\n\n\n\n\n                                             15\n\f                                                                  No.   2014AP2536-FT.ssa\n\n\nenforcement training records must be analyzed on a case-by-case\n\nbasis.19\n\n                                            B\n\n      ¶77    I turn now to the Department of Justice and majority\n\nopinion's reliance on the federal Freedom of Information Act\n\n(FOIA) and the Linzmeyer decision to support their conclusion.\n\nMajority op., ¶¶13, 18.

The majority opinion relegates the\n\nsubject of redaction to a footnote.\n\n      ¶81     The majority opinion baldly asserts that redaction is\n\nnot an option because the records at issue are videos, rather\n\nthan text documents, and cannot be redacted.                       Majority op., ¶24\n\nn.10.      Nothing in the record reveals whether this assertion is\n\ntrue.

The majority opinion in the instant\n\ncase extracts this language from the Michigan case that appears\n\nto support the majority opinion's view without comparing the\n\nMichigan and Wisconsin public records laws and without analyzing\n\nthe meaning of \"useless\" and whether redaction makes the 2009\n\nvideo \"useless\" in the instant case.\n\n    ¶92    In contrast, in State ex rel.

To support its conclusion that\n\nrelease of the 2013 video has the potential for re-victimizing\n\ncrime victims and imposes too high a cost on crime victims in\n\nthe instant case, the Department of Justice and the majority\n\nopinion rely on Jill J.

This is a review of an\nunpublished court of appeals' opinion and order,1 which affirmed\n\nthe circuit court's order2 granting a writ of mandamus compelling\n\nthe   Wisconsin     Department   of   Justice    to    disclose       two    video\n\nrecordings requested by the Democratic Party of Wisconsin under\n\nWisconsin's Public Records Law, Wis. Stat. §§ 19.31-.39 (2013-\n\n      1\n       Democratic Party of Wis. v. DOJ, No. 2014AP2536-FT,\nunpublished slip op. (Wis. Ct. App. Oct. 14, 2015).\n      2\n          The Honorable Richard G.

We conclude that the reasons given by\n\nthe record custodian for nondisclosure sufficiently demonstrate\n\nthat the legislative presumption in favor of disclosure has been\n\noutweighed by the public harm that would result from disclosure.\n\nWe reverse the decision of the court of appeals and deny the\n\nwrit of mandamus.\n\n                                I.    BACKGROUND\n\n        ¶2    In September 2014, Cory Liebmann, Research Director\n\nfor     the   Democratic   Party     of    Wisconsin,    submitted     a   public\n\nrecords request to the Wisconsin Department of Justice.                       The\n\nrequest asked for the release of\n\n        [a]ny and all photographs, films, and tape recordings\n        including but not limited to computer tapes and\n        printouts, CDs, DVDs, videotapes and optical discs of\n        any presentation made at any training program by Brad\n        Schimel on the following dates: May 14, 2013; June 8,\n        2012; November 8, 2012, May 20, 2010; June 17, 2009.\n        ¶3    Kevin   Potter,   the       Department    of   Justice's     Record\n\nCustodian, responded to the request by letter in October 2014.\n\nPotter explained the DOJ had \"identified two records responsive\n\nto [Liebmann's] request:         one video recording of a presentation\n\nmade by Mr. Schimel on May 14, 2013 on the topic of victim\n\nconfidentiality and one video recording of a presentation on\n\nJune 17, 2009 concerning the prosecution of, and common defenses\n\n        3\n       All subsequent references to the Wisconsin Statutes are to\nthe 2013-14 version unless otherwise indicated.\n\n\n                                          2\n\f                                                                No.     2014AP2536-FT\n\n\n\nin   online       child    exploitation       cases.\"        Both     videos     were\n\nrecordings of presentations Attorney Schimel4 gave at Wisconsin\n\nState    Prosecutors       Education    and    Training      conferences.         The\n\nsubject matter of the 2013 conference was \"Protecting Victims of\n\nCrime\"     and     Attorney       Schimel's      segment     addressed      \"Victim\n\nConfidentiality.\"          Attorney Schimel's presentation at the 2009\n\nconference       addressed     \"Prosecution      [and]     Common     Defenses     in\n\nOnline    Child        Exploitation    Cases.\"       These    conferences        were\n\ntraining sessions for prosecutors and victims' rights advocates,\n\nwith some law enforcement representatives present.                       Attendance\n\nwas limited to those groups and not open to the public or the\n\nmedia.    The videos were not publicly available but were recorded\n\nand stored so that prosecutors who were not able to attend could\n\nview the educational training at a later date.5\n\n     ¶4        Potter     explained    that    neither     recording     would     be\n\nreleased because, after applying the public records balancing\n\ntest,     he     concluded     the    public     interest     in      nondisclosure\n\noutweighed       the    general   presumption     favoring    release.         Potter\n\n     4\n       During the pendency of this case, Attorney Schimel served\nas the Waukesha County District Attorney and later as Wisconsin\nAttorney General.      To avoid confusion, we refer to him\nthroughout as \"Attorney Schimel.\"        At the time of both\npresentations at issue, Attorney Schimel served as the Waukesha\nDistrict Attorney. At the time of the 2013 presentation, he was\nalso the Republican candidate for Wisconsin Attorney General in\na contested election, which he won in November 2014.\n     5\n       The presentations are not professionally recorded and the\nvideos are of low quality. As we understand it, a video camera\nwas set up and an attendee was asked to push \"record\" when the\npresentation started and to push \"stop\" when it ended.\n\n\n                                         3\n\f                                                                               No.     2014AP2536-FT\n\n\n\ngave   specific         reasons         for    his       conclusion       particular      to    each\n\nrecording, with some overlap.                        The 2009 recording would not be\n\nreleased      because          (1)       the        presentation          contained       specific\n\nlitigation         strategies           for     online         child     exploitation       cases,\n\ndisclosure      of      which       would      impede      effective          investigation      and\n\nprosecution        of     sexual        predators;         (2)    the     prosecutor      training\n\nprograms are similar to the contents of a prosecutor's case\n\nfiles, which are exempt from disclosure under                                    State ex rel.\n\nRichards v.

The reasons\n\nfor    not   disclosing            the     2013      recording          included:         (1)   the\n\npresentation, which was part of a joint training program for\n\nprosecutors         and       crime      victim          staff,     discussed          prosecution\n\nstrategies      in      a    high-profile           sexual       extortion       case    involving\n\nhigh   school        students;          and    (2)       the     presentation        contained    a\n\nsubstantial amount of detail, which, if disclosed, would violate\nthe Wisconsin Constitution's Article I, § 9m provision requiring\n\nthat    crime      victims         be    treated          with    \"fairness,         dignity    and\n\nrespect      for     their         privacy.\"             The     recording      also     contained\n\n\"sufficient        details\"         that       \"could      lead     to    identification        and\n\ninvasion of privacy for young victims of a very sensitive series\n\nof crimes.\"         In addressing release of a redacted version, Potter\n\nexplained that doing so would render an \"end result meaningless\n\nto the viewer.\"\n\n\n                                                     4\n\f                                                                     No.    2014AP2536-FT\n\n\n\n       ¶5   Liebmann       and     the   Democratic        Party     petitioned      the\n\ncircuit court for a writ of mandamus seeking release of the\n\nrecords, punitive damages, and costs and attorney's fees.                            The\n\npetition asserted the withheld recordings may contain evidence\n\nof   misconduct     by     Attorney      Schimel:          \"Upon     information     and\n\nbelief, several or all of these tapes may include offensive\n\nracial remarks and ethnic slurs, including but not limited to\n\nstereotyped accents,            as well as sexist remarks, made by Mr.\n\nSchimel.\"\n\n       ¶6   After viewing both recordings in camera, the circuit\n\ncourt   concluded        neither    video       showed    misconduct       by   Attorney\n\nSchimel, but ordered both recordings disclosed.                            The circuit\n\ncourt felt the 2009 video presented a close question because it\n\ncontained strategies and techniques used in investigating and\n\nprosecuting sexual predators.               Nevertheless, the circuit court\n\nreasoned this video should be disclosed because the techniques\n\ndiscussed    were    \"widely       known\"    via    \"books,     magazine        articles,\n\n[and] TV shows.\"         It did not think the video contained \"any real\nsecrets\" and compared prosecuting sexual predators to playing\n\nhopscotch:       when     the    predators       find    ways   to   get    around   the\n\nState's techniques, the State has to catch up and find another\n\nway.    The circuit court was \"certain\" the strategies discussed\n\n\"are    taught      in    law      enforcement          academies,     FBI      training\n\nacademies, et cetera.\"             The circuit court decided that parents\n\nneeded to see the 2009 video so they could better protect their\n\nchildren from sexual predators.                 The circuit court specifically\n\n\n                                            5\n\f                                                                     No.    2014AP2536-FT\n\n\n\nacknowledged that the 2009 video did not involve \"misconduct on\n\nthe part of any of the presenters.\"\n\n      ¶7     With   respect       to   the   2013     video,      the    circuit     court\n\nreasoned disclosure was required because (1) the video did not\n\ncontain     specifically      identifiable          names    of    victims;    (2)    the\n\nvictims' responses to the sex extortion, described by Attorney\n\nSchimel in the video, were \"perfectly natural responses to the\n\nhorrific crimes that these children were subject to,\" and no one\n\nshould be surprised by the \"traumatic effects\" these children\n\nsuffered; (3) this information is important for members of the\n\npublic to know so they can protect their children; and (4) many\n\nof the details discussed in the video were in the original case\n\nfile and had previously been \"splattered all over the Internet.\"\n\nThe   circuit       court    did       recognize      that        re-disclosing      this\n\ninformation now may \"distress\" and re-traumatize the victims,\n\nbut   the   court    did     not   believe         such   factors       outweighed    the\n\npublic's right to \"know the contents of these tapes.\"\n\n      ¶8     In a summary disposition opinion and order, the court\nof appeals affirmed the circuit court's decision.                           Release of\n\nthe two recordings at issue has been stayed during the appeal\n\nprocess.     In addition, the DOJ allowed the attorney representing\n\nthe Democratic Party to view both the 2009 and 2013 videos,\n\nsubject to a protective order.                   After viewing the videos twice,\n\ncounsel     abandoned       any    claim     that     the     videos       contain    any\n\nmisconduct by Attorney Schimel.

Applicable Law\n\n      ¶10    Wisconsin is firmly committed to open and transparent\n\ngovernment,       as    evidenced         by    the   policy     expressed          by   the\n\nlegislature in our Public Records Law:\n\n      [I]t is declared to be the public policy of this state\n      that all persons are entitled to the greatest possible\n\n                                               7\n\f                                                               No.     2014AP2536-FT\n\n\n      information regarding the affairs of government and\n      the official acts of those officers and employees who\n      represent them . . . .   To that end, ss. 19.32 to\n      19.37 shall be construed in every instance with a\n      presumption of complete public access, consistent with\n      the conduct of governmental business.   The denial of\n      public access generally is contrary to the public\n      interest, and only in an exceptional case may access\n      be denied.\nWis. Stat. § 19.31.       Wisconsin law does recognize three types of\n\nexceptions to this general policy of open access:                    (1) statutory\n\nexceptions; (2) common law exceptions; and (3) public policy\nexceptions.

When a public\n\nrecords request is made, the record custodian must determine\n\nwhether the Public Records Law applies.              If the law applies, the\n\npresumption favors disclosure of the record.               Id.       The next step\n\nis to determine whether any exceptions operate to overcome the\n\ngeneral     presumption   of     openness.       Id.      \"[T]he       legislature\n\nentrusted the records custodian with substantial discretion\" in\n\nmaking this determination.         Id., ¶62.\n\n      ¶11    Exceptions    to     the   public       records      law's      general\n\npresumption of disclosure exist because some requests conflict\n\nwith other important policy considerations.                    Id.,       ¶28.     The\ncustodian must conduct \"the open records disclosure analysis on\n\na case-by-case basis.\"          Id., ¶62.    If a statutory or common law\n\nexception applies, the analysis ends and the records will not be\n\ndisclosed.     Id.   If neither applies, the custodian proceeds to\n\nthe public policy balancing test, which requires a consideration\n\nof all relevant factors to determine whether the public interest\nin   nondisclosure   outweighs      the     public     interest      in    favor   of\n\n\n                                        8\n\f                                                                          No.     2014AP2536-FT\n\n\n\ndisclosure.         Id., ¶63.          The test considers whether disclosure\n\nwould cause public harm to the degree that the presumption of\n\nopenness is overcome.\n\n       ¶12    This       case   does    not     involve        any   of     the      statutory\n\nexceptions         set    forth   in    Wis.       Stat. §§ 19.31-.39.

This court in Foust held that\n\n\"prosecutorial files are exempt from public access\" as a common\n\nlaw exception even after the case is closed.                           Id. at 430, 433-\n\n34.     In doing so, we explained that investigations and data\n\ncollected are not open for public viewing because disclosure of\n\nthis information would be \"harmful to the orderly administration\n\nof justice.\"         Id. at 435-36.        We listed multiple reasons for our\n\nconclusion, including the discretion afforded to prosecutors and\n\nthe fact that their files \"may contain historical data leading\n\nup to the prosecution which may be in the form of anonymous\n\nstatements,              informants'          statements,            or         neighborhood\n\ninvestigations at the scene of the crime.\"                           Id. at 434-35.            We\nnoted   that       this    material     needs      to    be    protected        in    order    to\n\nensure that the public will continue to cooperate in criminal\n\ninvestigations.

The   content          of    the    2009    video      falls\n\nsquarely into this category.                    Releasing this video would create\n\na significant risk that specific techniques and strategies being\n\nused    in    Wisconsin       could    instantly            be    disseminated          over    the\n\ninternet and exploited by sexual predators.                               This information\n\nwould    in    essence       serve    as   a     textbook         enlightening          Wisconsin\n\ncriminals on how to avoid detection, elude capture, and escape\nconviction.          The harm arising from release would substantially\n\nimpair       the    ongoing      battle      police         and    prosecutors           face    in\n\nprotecting children and would impede efforts made to catch and\n\nprosecute sexual predators who lurk in the shadows and anonymity\n\nof    internet       websites.        Although            disclosing      this    information\n\ndirectly to the Democratic Party alone would not necessarily be\n\nharmful, releasing the 2009 video to one effectively renders it\n\npublic to all, including anyone plotting to use it to circumvent\nthe law.

The Democratic Party's arguments,\n\nlike   the    circuit      court's    reasons,         are   flawed    and     erroneous.\n\nThis   video        is   replete    with    police       and   prosecutor          tactics,\n\nspecific      instances      of    cases        with   descriptive          details,     and\n\npractical strategies to gather evidence.                     This content would not\n\nassist the average parent.\n       ¶21    The Democratic Party's assertion that the techniques\n\nand strategies are so widely known that disclosure would not be\n\nharmful      is   equally    questionable.             There   is     no    rule    of   law\n\nprotecting only brand new or novel prosecution techniques and\n\npolice strategies, and there is no evidence that releasing local\n\nstrategies will not lead to circumvention of the law simply\n\nbecause      they    are   also    seen    on    television     crime       shows.

Although child predators\n\nmay    know   in     general      terms     various     techniques       taught    to    and\n\nemployed by police departments across the country, the specific\n\ntechniques used by police officers in a particular jurisdiction\n\nor geographic area are not necessarily a matter of common public\n\nknowledge.         A criminal who knows the specific techniques being\n\nused    locally      is    much    more     likely     to      evade    capture    than    a\n\ncriminal      who,    after     viewing      a    crime     show,      guesses    at    what\n\ntechniques local police and prosecutors are using.\n\n       ¶22    Another      factor      to    balance      in    these     cases    is    the\n\npresence of \"official cover-up\" by public officials.

Because the video reveals no misconduct\n\nor dereliction of duty, this factor does not counter the strong\npublic policies supporting nondisclosure.\n\n       ¶23    Additionally,        the      context    of      the    records'    request,\n\nalthough not always relevant, should be considered here.                                 See\n\nid., ¶66 (\"When performing a balancing test, however, a records\n\ncustodian      almost       inevitably       must      evaluate        context    to    some\n\ndegree.\").      The Public Records Law does not require a requestor\n\nto disclose his or her identity or to state a purpose for the\n\nrequest.      See Wis. Stat. § 19.35(1)(i).

During a contested election,\n\nthe     request     sought       records     containing            allegedly       offensive\n\ncomments     made    by    the    candidate       from       the     opposing     political\n\nparty.      And the Democratic Party persists in its pursuit of the\n\nrecords, despite the fact that its attorney has now viewed the\n\nrecordings and the parties agree the recordings contain no such\n\noffensive content.          When weighed against the likely harm to law\n\nenforcement's efforts to capture and convict sexual predators\n\nwho target children, the counterfactual justification offered\n\nfor   the    request       clearly    does       not    tip     the      balance      towards\n\noverturning the record custodian's decision.\n\n      ¶24    In applying the balancing test to the 2009 video, we\n\nconclude     that    the    public     interest         in    preventing        release     of\n\nspecific police and prosecution strategies and techniques being\ntaught and used in Wisconsin outweighs the general legislative\n\npresumption that public records should be disclosed.                               We are a\n\nState    committed     to      open   and    transparent           government,        but   if\n\ndisclosure results in greater public harm than nondisclosure,\n\nthe scale must tip in favor of nondisclosure, especially when\n\nsexual exploitation of vulnerable children is at risk.                                Because\n\nthe 2009 video consists almost entirely of police tactics and\n\nspecific     prosecution         strategies        in    cases          involving      sexual\nexploitation      of   children,       disclosure            would    result     in    public\n                                            17\n\f                                                         No.    2014AP2536-FT\n\n\n\nharm.      The public policy factors favoring nondisclosure thus\n\novercome the presumption in favor of disclosure.                The record\n\ncustodian gave specific reasons for the decision not to disclose\n\nthe   2009   recording,   and   we   conclude   the   reasons   given   were\n\nlegally sufficient and sound.10\n\n      10\n       While excerpts of the recording may fall beyond the\npublic policy considerations favoring nondisclosure, which\nordinarily results in the release of a redacted version under\nWis.

See Foust,\n\n165 Wis. 2d at 433-35.            Foust held that a district attorney's\n\nclosed files were not subject to the Public Records Law based on\n\nthe broad discretion a district attorney has in charging, the\n\nconfidential nature of the contents of a file, and the threat\ndisclosure poses to the orderly administration of justice.

Rather, the record is an oral, in-\n\ndepth presentation by Attorney Schimel, who was the prosecutor\n\nin charge of the sex extortion case discussed.

App.        1998)\n\n(distinguishing         private          records         from    public        records).            The\n\nsubstance of this 2013 video contains the same discretionary\n\ncontent    found       in    a    prosecutor's            file;    therefore,              the    Foust\n\ncommon     law    exception             renders         the     2013     video       exempt        from\n\ndisclosure under Wisconsin's Public Records Law.\n\n    ¶28        Our analysis could end here because the common law\n\nexception applies.            This case, however, involves a public policy\n\nconsideration of constitutional significance, and we therefore\n\nchoose    to     proceed         to     an    application         of     the     public          policy\n\nbalancing test.             First, again, Attorney Schimel is a public\n\nofficial, a factor weighing in favor of disclosure.                                   Second, the\n\ncontent of the video, like the 2009 video, contains prosecution\n\nstrategies       and   law       enforcement            tactics,       which,        as     Linzmeyer\n\nexplains,      weighs       in    favor       of    nondisclosure.              See        Linzmeyer,\n\n¶¶32-33.       Third, the 2013 video discusses the victims of the sex\n\nextortion      case     and      the     devastating            impact    of     these        crimes,\nespecially       after       the        victims'         identities        were       discovered.\n\nWisconsin's constitutional commitment to the fair treatment of\n\nvictims and their privacy rights, together with this court's\n\ncommitment to minimizing victims' suffering, weigh in favor of\n\nnondisclosure.          Although we cannot always protect victims from\n\nre-traumatization           or        additional         suffering,       the        circumstances\n\nhere clearly allow us to do so.\n\n    ¶29        Although we review the record custodian's decision, we\nbriefly explain why the four reasons the circuit court gave for\n                                                   21\n\f                                                                    No.    2014AP2536-FT\n\n\n\noverturning      the     custodian's           decision      are    inadequate         and\n\nerroneous.      We do so because the Democratic Party relies on the\n\ncircuit court's reasoning to advance its position that the 2013\n\nvideo should be disclosed.                First, the fact that no specific\n\nnames   are    used     on    the    video     does    not    render      the    victims\n\nunidentifiable.              Disclosing       the     recording     would       reignite\n\ninterest in the case and allow identification in the same way it\n\noccurred the first time around.                     There is sufficient factual\n\ndetail in the recording to easily connect the dots to identify\n\nthe dozens of victims, who would be re-traumatized should this\n\ncase result in a repeat exposure of their identities almost a\n\ndecade after these events occurred.                   Disclosure leading to re-\n\nvictimization       would     run     afoul    of     Wisconsin's      constitutional\n\ncommitment     to   treating         victims    with     \"fairness,       dignity      and\n\nrespect for their privacy.\"             Wis. Const. art. I, § 9m.               Further,\n\nthe victims involved here were all child victims who deserve\n\nspecial treatment and protection with an emphasis on keeping\n\ntheir identities confidential, \"especially in sensitive cases.\"\nSee Wis. Stat. § 950.055(1).

Whether      a    victim's\n\nreaction is natural or excessive should not be a justification\nfor re-traumatizing child victims of sensitive crimes.

Although this video may contain limited helpful\n\ninformation on this topic, many other useful resources exist for\n\nparents but do not present the same threat of harm to victims.\n\nThe DOJ makes available online materials helpful to concerned\n\nparents.11     Local schools, communities, and police departments\n\nalso offer a variety of helpful resources and seminars.12\n\n     ¶32     Fourth,      the    fact    that      a    significant           amount    of    the\n\ninformation        discussed      in    the    recording           had    been     previously\n\ndisseminated seven or eight years ago, although \"germane to the\n\nbalancing test\" see Linzmeyer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2013841\"><a href=\"/opinion/2013841/linzmeyer-v-forcey/\"><span class=\"volume\">254</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wis. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">306</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶37, does not\n\nrequire disclosure.              This information was disclosed almost a\n\ndecade ago.        As presented in the affidavit submitted by Jill J.\n\nKarofsky,     Executive         Director      of   the    Office         of     Crime    Victim\nServices,     re-disclosing        the       details     of    a    case      typically       re-\n\ntraumatizes victims.

It is not unreasonable——indeed,\n\nit comports with common sense——to expect additional harm will be\n\ninflicted on the victims every time a case such as this is\n\npublicized, especially if done in a high-profile way such as a\n\nlawsuit that is pursued through all three levels of Wisconsin's\n\ncourt system with much media attention.                  Moreover, releasing the\n\n2013 video creates a real risk that future victims will not\n\nreport       crimes    and     will    not      cooperate       with     prosecutors.\n\nEffective        prosecution    depends      upon    victims    reporting       in   the\n\nfirst instance and cooperating until the end of the case.13\n\n       ¶33       In balancing the equally important public policies of\n\nopenness         of   public     records        against     the        constitutional\n\ndeclaration demanding protection and fair treatment of victims,\n\ncoupled with the need for victim reporting and cooperation in\n\norder       to   identify    lawbreakers,      we    conclude     that    the   Public\n\nRecords Law did not require the record custodian to release the\n\n2013    video.        The    video    contains      no   misconduct      or   evidence\n\n\n       13\n       This case is not about protecting an individual's privacy\ninterest like in Linzmeyer, where the teacher objected to the\nrelease of a police report generated during an investigation of\npossible inappropriate actions between the teacher and some\nstudents.   See Linzmeyer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2013841\"><a href=\"/opinion/2013841/linzmeyer-v-forcey/\"><span class=\"volume\">254</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wis. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">306</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶31 (observing that\nthe public interest in protecting the reputation and privacy of\ncitizens is \"not equivalent to an individual's personal interest\nin protecting his or her own character and reputation\").\nRather, the case before this court is about the public interest\nin protecting the reputation and privacy of crime victims and\nthe concomitant public policy that such protection will\nencourage victims to report crimes and cooperate in prosecution\nof criminals.\n\n\n                                          24\n\f                                                                    No.    2014AP2536-FT\n\n\n\nshowing      dereliction      of    duty.        Rather,    it     contains   an     oral\n\naccount of the prosecution of a high school student who sexually\n\nextorted       dozens   of    his    fellow       students.        The    account     was\n\npresented      at   a   confidential        prosecutor      training      seminar,    and\n\naside from the general presumption favoring disclosure, it has\n\nlittle public value.            Disclosure would provide the public with\n\nAttorney Schimel's mental processes and thoughts with respect to\n\na sex extortion case he prosecuted many years ago.                         Contrary to\n\nFoust, releasing the video would give the public insight into\n\nAttorney       Schimel's      discretionary        charging      decisions,    and     it\n\nwould likely reignite the public and media outrage associated\n\nwith   the     crimes    at    issue      here.      It    would    undoubtedly       re-\n\ntraumatize and harm the             victims who were minors at the time of\n\nthese crimes, and its disclosure would send a strong message to\n\ncrime victims that the continued pain that sometimes accompanies\n\nthe pursuit of justice does not end——even when a prosecution is\n\ncomplete and the case is closed.                    The balancing test clearly\n\nweighs    in    favor    of   nondisclosure        and     strongly      overcomes    the\npresumption favoring disclosure.\n\n                                   III.    CONCLUSION\n\n       ¶34     Wisconsin and this court are firmly committed to open\n\nand transparent government.               The denial of public access occurs\n\nonly in exceptional cases.                  This case presents one of those\n\nexceptional situations.             The two videos requested here do not\n\ncontain any evidence of official misconduct.                     The circuit court,\n\nthe court of appeals, this court, and the Democratic Party all\nagree on this point.            Both the 2009 and 2013 videos arise from\n                                            25\n\f                                                                       No.    2014AP2536-FT\n\n\n\nconfidential      prosecutors'         training        sessions,      and    both    videos\n\ncontain     instruction         on      prosecutorial          strategies          and     law\n\nenforcement tactics.            The 2013 recording is an accounting of a\n\nsingle case and the functional equivalent of a prosecutor's case\n\nfile, which is exempt from disclosure under Foust.                            Further, it\n\ncontains information, which, if released, would harm the public\n\ninterest     by   re-traumatizing         the     victims       and    violating         their\n\nprivacy rights, contrary to the policies enshrined in our state\n\nconstitution, statutes, and case law.                    In applying the balancing\n\ntest    required     by    Wis.      Stat.    § 19.35(1)(a),           the    DOJ    record\n\ncustodian     gave      specific      reasons     for     nondisclosure,           and     our\n\nreview independently demonstrates that the reasons proffered are\n\nsufficient and supported by the facts in this case.

I view the public\n\nrecords law from three vantage points.

These\n\ncases are precedent that binds us all.                           In my capacity as an\n\nelected      official    and     custodian         of    records,       I     have    been    the\n\nrecipient of numerous open records requests, to which I have\n\nresponded by complying with the public records law (although the\n\ncourt   has    never    ruled     on    whether         the     public       records    law    is\napplicable to it).

Do not adopt a redact and release\n\napproach.5\n\n       ¶42     In this court, the Department of Justice again seeks\n\nto bar release of the two videos in their entirety.                                   I agree\n\nwith the circuit court and court of appeals that the Department\n\nof     Justice       has      not     provided          evidence      to        support     the\nnondisclosure of the videos.                Instead, the Department of Justice\n\nrelies on speculation, conjecture, and fear.\n\n       ¶43     The Department of Justice has presented no evidence\n\nthat the two videos reveal any investigation and prosecution\n\npractices not already known or knowable in the public sphere.\n\nThe    Department       of     Justice      has      presented       no     evidence       that\n\n       5\n       At the circuit court, the Department of Justice rejected\nthe Democratic Party's suggestion that the circuit court\nconsider redaction of certain parts of the videos.\n\n\n                                               4\n\f                                                                 No.    2014AP2536-FT.ssa\n\n\ninformation in the videos would hinder the state's ability to\n\nprosecute       sex    offenders.
