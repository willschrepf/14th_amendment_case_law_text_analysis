Moreover, the legislative history of House Bill 2563 indicates that the bill was meant to\ndefine the role of a school board member and distinguish it from the role of a superintendent-as\na kind ofjob description for a board trustee. In the hearings before the House Committee on Public\nEducation and the Senate Committee on Education, the testimony ofwitnesses and the bill's authors\nfocused solely on the provisions in the bill pertaining to the respective authority of, and relationship\nbetween, the school board and the superintendent. See Hearings on Tex. H.B. 2563 Before the\nHouse Comm. on Pub. Educ., 80th Leg., R.S. (Apr. 17, 2007) (statements of Representative Kelly\nHancock; David Duty, Tex. Ass'n Sch. Bds.; Mike Moses, Tex.

The purpose, circumstances of enactment, and\nthe legislative history indicate to us that the Legislature intended House Bill 2563 to better define\nthe role of a school board trustee and to segregate the board's role and duties from those of the\nsuperintendent, particularly with respect to governance and management duties. There is no\nindication that the Legislature intended to alter the common-law majority vote requirement for a\nschool district board of trustees.\n\n         Thus, absent clear indication in the text of section 11.051 (a-I) that the Legislature intended\nto abrogate the common-law standard for determining a majority vote, and because we find no\nindication in the extra-textual considerations ofany such legislative intent, we conclude that section\n11.051 (a-I) does not change the standard for determining the number ofvotes necessary for a school\ndistrict board of trustees to act in its official capacity. Because we answer your first question in the\nnegative, we need not address your additional questions.\n\fMr. Robert Scott - Page 4                     (GA-0689)\n\n\n\n                                       SUMMARY\n\n                       Section 11.051(a-l), Texas Education Code, does not alter the\n               common-law standard for determining the number ofvotes necessary\n               for a school district board of trustees to act in its official capacity.\n\n\n\n\nANDREW WEBER\nFirst Assistant Attorney General\n\nJONATHAN K.

Bus. & Educ. Coal.); Hearings on\nTex. Comm. Substitute H.B. 2563' Before the Sen. Comm. on Educ., 80th Leg., R.S. (May 17, 2007,\npart II) (statement of Senator Leticia Van de Putte). The purpose, circumstances of enactment, and\nthe legislative history indicate to us that the Legislature intended House Bill 2563 to better define\nthe role of a school board trustee and to segregate the board's role and duties from those of the\nsuperintendent, particularly with respect to governance and management duties. There is no\nindication that the Legislature intended to alter the common-law majority vote requirement for a\nschool district board of trustees.\n\n         Thus, absent clear indication in the text of section 11.051 (a-I) that the Legislature intended\nto abrogate the common-law standard for determining a majority vote, and because we find no\nindication in the extra-textual considerations ofany such legislative intent, we conclude that section\n11.051 (a-I) does not change the standard for determining the number ofvotes necessary for a school\ndistrict board of trustees to act in its official capacity. Because we answer your first question in the\nnegative, we need not address your additional questions.\n\fMr. Robert Scott - Page 4                     (GA-0689)\n\n\n\n                                       SUMMARY\n\n                       Section 11.051(a-l), Texas Education Code, does not alter the\n               common-law standard for determining the number ofvotes necessary\n               for a school district board of trustees to act in its official capacity.\n\n\n\n\nANDREW WEBER\nFirst Assistant Attorney General\n\nJONATHAN K.
