The District Court\n\ninitially granted summary judgment in favor of Defendants as to the due process claims\n\nunder Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539 (1974). Milton filed a motion for\n\nreconsideration, noting that the District Court overlooked additional due process and\n\nfreedom of speech claims. After granting his motion and considering those claims, the\n\nDistrict Court again granted summary judgment in favor of Defendants. Milton filed\n\nanother motion for reconsideration, which was denied. This appeal followed. Because\n\nthe appeal does not present a substantial question, we will summarily affirm. See 3d Cir.\n\nLAR 27.4; 3d Cir. IOP 10.6.\n\n                                               I\n\n         In 2002 and 2003, Milton received sanctions stemming from two incidents at\n\nU.S.P. Allenwood, where he is incarcerated. In the first instance, Milton was charged\n\nwith violating Prohibited Action Code 397, which prohibits “Use of the Telephone for\n\n\n\n\n  1\n      See Bivens v. Six Unknown Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971).\n\n                                               2\n\fAbuses other than Criminal Activity.” 2 After Milton filed a formal resolution request, a\n\nDisciplinary Hearing Officer (DHO) conducted a hearing, at which the DHO determined\n\nthat Milton had violated Code 397. Milton received a sanction of lost phone privileges\n\nfor three months and a loss of thirteen days’ good time credit. Milton appealed the\n\nDHO’s decision to the Regional Director, arguing that the sanction violated his Due\n\nProcess and First Amendment Rights. The Regional Director upheld the DHO’s decision.\n\nMilton then appealed to the General Counsel, which ordered the DHO to reconsider the\n\ncharge against Milton. Notably, Milton did not argue a First Amendment violation in that\n\nfinal appeal. Upon review of the case, a DHO determined that Milton had not violated\n\nCode 397 and reinstated his good time credit. In July 2004, Milton filed the instant action\n\nin the District Court.\n\n       In the second incident, Milton was charged with “Possession of Anything Not\n\nAuthorized,” in violation of Code 305.3 At a hearing, a DHO found Milton guilty of\n\nviolating Code 305 and sanctioned him with two months’ loss of commissary privileges\n\nand fifteen days’ disciplinary segregation, suspended pending 180 days of clear conduct.\n\nMilton’s appeals were denied and, in August 2004, he amended his pending federal\n\ncomplaint to allege Due Process violations during the Code 305 proceedings.\n\n\n  2\n    It was alleged that Milton had initiated a plan of third party contact by suggesting over\nthe phone that his brother contact another relative on Milton’s behalf, thereby\ncircumventing BOP’s monitoring of inmate communications.\n  3\n   BOP officials alleged that Milton possessed food items taken from the prison cafeteria\nand secreted in his laundry bag.\n\n                                              3\n\f                                              II\n\n       Milton contends that the District Court improperly granted the Defendants’\n\nmotions for summary judgment.4 A motion for summary judgment may not be granted\n\nunless the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56.\n\nSummary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings, depositions, answers to\n\ninterrogatories, admissions on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue\n\nas to any material fact. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). An issue of fact is “genuine only if a\n\nreasonable jury, considering the evidence presented, could find for the nonmoving party.”\n\nChilders v. Joseph, 842 F.2d 689, 693-94 (3d Cir. 1988) (internal citations omitted).\n\n       The burden of proving that there is no genuine issue of material fact is initially\n\nupon the movant; upon such a showing, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party. See El\n\nv. Southeastern Pennsylvania Transp. Auth., 479 F.3d 232, 238 (3d Cir. 2007). The\n\nnonmoving party is required to go beyond the pleadings and by affidavits or by\n\n“depositions, answers to interrogatories and admissions on file” designate “specific facts\n\nshowing that there is a genuine issue for trial.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e).\n\n\n\n\n  4\n    Milton’s complaint includes the following claims: the DHO proceedings related to his\nCode 397 and Code 305 charges failed to provide due process, as required by Wolff v.\nMcDonnell, 418 U.S. 539 (1974), and Superintendent, Mass. Corr. Inst., Walpole v. Hill,\n472 U.S. 445 (1985); the telephone restriction sanctions imposed against Milton under\nCode 397 violated his free speech rights under the First Amendment; and Code 397 fails\nto provide fair notice of the conduct it prohibits, in violation of the Due Process Clause of\nthe Fifth Amendment.\n\n                                              4\n\f                                             III\n\n       When an inmate faces the possibility of loss of good conduct time credits, he\n\nshould receive: (1) written notice of the claimed violation at least twenty-four hours in\n\nadvance of the hearing, (2) an opportunity to call witnesses and present documentary\n\nevidence in his defense when doing so would not be unduly hazardous to institutional\n\nsafety or correctional goals, (3) assistance from a representative, if the charged inmate is\n\nilliterate or if complex issues are involved, and (4) a written statement by the factfinder as\n\nto evidence relied on and reasons for the disciplinary action. See Wolff, 418 U.S. at 564.\n\nFurther, the DHO’s decision must be supported by “some evidence” on the record. See\n\nHill, 472 U.S. at 454.\n\n       The District Court record overwhelmingly supports the conclusion that the\n\nrequirements of Wolff and Hill were met in both DHO proceedings. In the Code 397\n\nproceeding, Milton received timely notice of the claimed violation, had the opportunity to\n\ncall witnesses and present documentary evidence, received assistance from a staff\n\nrepresentative, and received a written statement by the DHO concerning the evidence\n\nrelied upon and the reasons for imposing sanctions. Further, because Milton admitted to\n\nmaking the phone call and asking his brother to contact a third party, evidence existed on\n\nthe record to support the DHO’s decision. Milton has not met his burden of\n\ndemonstrating the existence of a disputed material fact with regard to the Code 397 claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\f                                             IV\n\n       Milton’s claim with respect to the Code 305 proceeding also lacks merit.\n\n“Discipline by prison officials in response to a wide range of misconduct” is expected as\n\npart of an inmate’s sentence, Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472, 484 (1995), and a sanction\n\nof fifteen days’ segregated confinement ordinarily does not violate a protected liberty\n\ninterest. See, e.g., Smith v. Mensinger, 293 F.3d 641, 653 (3d Cir. 2002) (seven months’\n\ndisciplinary segregation insufficient to trigger due process violation); Griffin v. Vaughan,\n\n112 F.3d 703, 706-08 (3d Cir. 1997) (fifteen months’ administrative custody insufficient\n\nto trigger due process violation). The District Court reasoned that the suspended term of\n\ndisciplinary segregation and two months’ loss of commissary privileges did not amount to\n\na hardship of sufficient magnitude to implicate a liberty interest, and concluded that\n\nsummary judgment was appropriate because Wolff due process protections did not apply.\n\nWe agree.5\n\n                                             V\n\n       Milton’s First Amendment claim also fails. No prisoner may file an action in\n\nfederal court with respect to prison conditions without first exhausting all available\n\n\n\n\n  5\n    Moreover, even if Wolff’s protections applied, we note that the conditions of Wolff\nand Hill were satisfied. Milton received timely notice of the hearing. He was advised of\nhis rights, indicated that he understood them, and chose not to have a staff representative\nor witnesses appear on his behalf. The DHO provided a written report explaining the\nconclusion that Milton committed the proscribed conduct, and inculpatory evidence in the\nform of Milton’s possession of the food provided some support for that decision.\n\n                                              6\n\fadministrative remedies. 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a). Pursuant to BOP regulations, a federal\n\nprisoner found guilty at a DHO hearing of a code violation may appeal the decision to the\n\nRegional Director. 28 C.F.R. § 542.14(d)(2). If he does not prevail, he may appeal the\n\nRegional Director’s decision to the Central Office. 28 C.F.R. § 542.15. At all stages of\n\nthe administrative appellate process, the inmate must “state specifically the reason[s] for\n\nappeal,” § 542.15(b)(1), and “an inmate may not raise in an Appeal issues not raised in\n\nlower level filings.” § 542.15(b)(2). In the instant case, although Milton raised a First\n\nAmendment claim in his appeal to the Regional Director, he did not do so in his appeal to\n\nthe Central Office. Because he failed to exhaust administrative remedies concerning any\n\nFirst Amendment violations, Milton cannot prevail on such a claim in federal court.\n\n                                             VI\n\n       Finally, with regard to Milton’s fair notice claim, the District Court reasoned that,\n\nin light of the DHO’s conclusion that Milton did not violate Code 397, the regulations\n\nprovided adequate notice.6 We agree.7\n\n       In sum, the appeal presents no substantial issues. Accordingly, we summarily\n\naffirm the judgment of the District Court.\n\n\n\n  6\n    Code 397 prohibits “use of the telephone for abuses other than criminal activity (e.g.,\nconference calling, possession and/or use of another inmate’s PIN number, three-way\ncalling, providing false information for preparation of a telephone list).” 28 C.F.R. §\n541.13, Table 3.\n  7\n   We also agree with the District Court’s reasons for denying Milton’s motion for\nreconsideration.\n\n                                              7\n\f",

The District Court\n\ninitially granted summary judgment in favor of Defendants as to the due process claims\n\nunder Wolff v. McDonnell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109097\"><a href=\"/opinion/109097/wolff-v-mcdonnell/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">539</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1974). Milton filed a motion for\n\nreconsideration, noting that the District Court overlooked additional due process and\n\nfreedom of speech claims. After granting his motion and considering those claims, the\n\nDistrict Court again granted summary judgment in favor of Defendants. Milton filed\n\nanother motion for reconsideration, which was denied. This appeal followed. Because\n\nthe appeal does not present a substantial question, we will summarily affirm. See 3d Cir.\n\nLAR 27.4; 3d Cir. IOP 10.6.\n\n                                               I\n\n         In 2002 and 2003, Milton received sanctions stemming from two incidents at\n\nU.S.P. Allenwood, where he is incarcerated. In the first instance, Milton was charged\n\nwith violating Prohibited Action Code 397, which prohibits “Use of the Telephone for\n\n\n\n\n  1\n      See Bivens v. Six Unknown Agents of Fed.

Milton received a sanction of lost phone privileges\n\nfor three months and a loss of thirteen days’ good time credit. Milton appealed the\n\nDHO’s decision to the Regional Director, arguing that the sanction violated his Due\n\nProcess and First Amendment Rights. The Regional Director upheld the DHO’s decision.\n\nMilton then appealed to the General Counsel, which ordered the DHO to reconsider the\n\ncharge against Milton. Notably, Milton did not argue a First Amendment violation in that\n\nfinal appeal. Upon review of the case, a DHO determined that Milton had not violated\n\nCode 397 and reinstated his good time credit. In July 2004, Milton filed the instant action\n\nin the District Court.\n\n       In the second incident, Milton was charged with “Possession of Anything Not\n\nAuthorized,” in violation of Code 305.3 At a hearing, a DHO found Milton guilty of\n\nviolating Code 305 and sanctioned him with two months’ loss of commissary privileges\n\nand fifteen days’ disciplinary segregation, suspended pending 180 days of clear conduct.\n\nMilton’s appeals were denied and, in August 2004, he amended his pending federal\n\ncomplaint to allege Due Process violations during the Code 305 proceedings.\n\n\n  2\n    It was alleged that Milton had initiated a plan of third party contact by suggesting over\nthe phone that his brother contact another relative on Milton’s behalf, thereby\ncircumventing BOP’s monitoring of inmate communications.\n  3\n   BOP officials alleged that Milton possessed food items taken from the prison cafeteria\nand secreted in his laundry bag.\n\n                                              3\n\f                                              II\n\n       Milton contends that the District Court improperly granted the Defendants’\n\nmotions for summary judgment.4 A motion for summary judgment may not be granted\n\nunless the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56.\n\nSummary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings, depositions, answers to\n\ninterrogatories, admissions on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue\n\nas to any material fact. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). An issue of fact is “genuine only if a\n\nreasonable jury, considering the evidence presented, could find for the nonmoving party.”\n\nChilders v.

P. 56(e).\n\n\n\n\n  4\n    Milton’s complaint includes the following claims: the DHO proceedings related to his\nCode 397 and Code 305 charges failed to provide due process, as required by Wolff v.\nMcDonnell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109097\"><a href=\"/opinion/109097/wolff-v-mcdonnell/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">539</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1974), and Superintendent, Mass.

Hill,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111476\"><a href=\"/opinion/111476/superintendent-mass-correctional-institution-at-walpole-v-hill/\"><span class=\"volume\">472</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">445</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1985); the telephone restriction sanctions imposed against Milton under\nCode 397 violated his free speech rights under the First Amendment; and Code 397 fails\nto provide fair notice of the conduct it prohibits, in violation of the Due Process Clause of\nthe Fifth Amendment.\n\n                                              4\n\f                                             III\n\n       When an inmate faces the possibility of loss of good conduct time credits, he\n\nshould receive: (1) written notice of the claimed violation at least twenty-four hours in\n\nadvance of the hearing, (2) an opportunity to call witnesses and present documentary\n\nevidence in his defense when doing so would not be unduly hazardous to institutional\n\nsafety or correctional goals, (3) assistance from a representative, if the charged inmate is\n\nilliterate or if complex issues are involved, and (4) a written statement by the factfinder as\n\nto evidence relied on and reasons for the disciplinary action. See Wolff, 418 U.S. at 564.\n\nFurther, the DHO’s decision must be supported by “some evidence” on the record. See\n\nHill, 472 U.S. at 454.\n\n       The District Court record overwhelmingly supports the conclusion that the\n\nrequirements of Wolff and Hill were met in both DHO proceedings. In the Code 397\n\nproceeding, Milton received timely notice of the claimed violation, had the opportunity to\n\ncall witnesses and present documentary evidence, received assistance from a staff\n\nrepresentative, and received a written statement by the DHO concerning the evidence\n\nrelied upon and the reasons for imposing sanctions. Further, because Milton admitted to\n\nmaking the phone call and asking his brother to contact a third party, evidence existed on\n\nthe record to support the DHO’s decision. Milton has not met his burden of\n\ndemonstrating the existence of a disputed material fact with regard to the Code 397 claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\f                                             IV\n\n       Milton’s claim with respect to the Code 305 proceeding also lacks merit.\n\n“Discipline by prison officials in response to a wide range of misconduct” is expected as\n\npart of an inmate’s sentence, Sandin v. Conner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117957\"><a href=\"/opinion/117957/sandin-v-conner/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 484 (1995), and a sanction\n\nof fifteen days’ segregated confinement ordinarily does not violate a protected liberty\n\ninterest. See, e.g., Smith v.

The District Court reasoned that the suspended term of\n\ndisciplinary segregation and two months’ loss of commissary privileges did not amount to\n\na hardship of sufficient magnitude to implicate a liberty interest, and concluded that\n\nsummary judgment was appropriate because Wolff due process protections did not apply.\n\nWe agree.5\n\n                                             V\n\n       Milton’s First Amendment claim also fails. No prisoner may file an action in\n\nfederal court with respect to prison conditions without first exhausting all available\n\n\n\n\n  5\n    Moreover, even if Wolff’s protections applied, we note that the conditions of Wolff\nand Hill were satisfied. Milton received timely notice of the hearing. He was advised of\nhis rights, indicated that he understood them, and chose not to have a staff representative\nor witnesses appear on his behalf. The DHO provided a written report explaining the\nconclusion that Milton committed the proscribed conduct, and inculpatory evidence in the\nform of Milton’s possession of the food provided some support for that decision.\n\n                                              6\n\fadministrative remedies. 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a). Pursuant to BOP regulations, a federal\n\nprisoner found guilty at a DHO hearing of a code violation may appeal the decision to the\n\nRegional Director. 28 C.F.R. § 542.14(d)(2). If he does not prevail, he may appeal the\n\nRegional Director’s decision to the Central Office. 28 C.F.R. § 542.15. At all stages of\n\nthe administrative appellate process, the inmate must “state specifically the reason[s] for\n\nappeal,” § 542.15(b)(1), and “an inmate may not raise in an Appeal issues not raised in\n\nlower level filings.” § 542.15(b)(2). In the instant case, although Milton raised a First\n\nAmendment claim in his appeal to the Regional Director, he did not do so in his appeal to\n\nthe Central Office. Because he failed to exhaust administrative remedies concerning any\n\nFirst Amendment violations, Milton cannot prevail on such a claim in federal court.\n\n                                             VI\n\n       Finally, with regard to Milton’s fair notice claim, the District Court reasoned that,\n\nin light of the DHO’s conclusion that Milton did not violate Code 397, the regulations\n\nprovided adequate notice.6 We agree.7\n\n       In sum, the appeal presents no substantial issues. Accordingly, we summarily\n\naffirm the judgment of the District Court.\n\n\n\n  6\n    Code 397 prohibits “use of the telephone for abuses other than criminal activity (e.g.,\nconference calling, possession and/or use of another inmate’s PIN number, three-way\ncalling, providing false information for preparation of a telephone list).” 28 C.F.R. §\n541.13, Table 3.\n  7\n   We also agree with the District Court’s reasons for denying Milton’s motion for\nreconsideration.\n\n                                              7\n\f</pre>",
