The law provides that the Attorney General may substitute and certify a more suitable and correct popular name and ballot title, if he can do so, or if the proposed popular name and ballot title are sufficiently misleading, may reject the entire petition.</p>\n<p>A.C.A. &#167; <cross_reference>7-9-107</cross_reference> neither requires nor authorizes this office to make legal determinations concerning the merits of the act or amendment, or concerning the likelihood that it will accomplish its stated objective. Consequently, this review has been limited to a determination, pursuant to the guidelines that have been set forth by the Arkansas Supreme Court, discussed below, of whether the proposed popular name and ballot title accurately and impartially summarize the provisions of your proposed amendment.</p>\n<p>The purpose of my review and certification is to ensure that the popular name and ballot title honestly, intelligibly, and fairly set forth the purpose of the proposed amendment. <u>See</u> <em>Arkansas Women's Political Caucus</em><em>v. Riviere,</em> <cross_reference>282 Ark. 463</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>466</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>677 S.W.2d 846</cross_reference> (1984).</p>\n<p>The popular name is primarily a useful legislative device. <em>Pafford v.</em><em>Hall,</em> <cross_reference>217 Ark. 734</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>233 S.W.2d 72</cross_reference> (1950). It need not contain detailed information or include exceptions that might be required of a ballot title, but it must not be misleading or give partisan coloring to the merit of the proposal. <em>Chaney v. Bryant,</em> <cross_reference>259 Ark. 294</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>532 S.W.2d 741</cross_reference>\n(1976); <em>Moore v. Hall,</em> <cross_reference>229 Ark. 411</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>316 S.W.2d 207</cross_reference> (1958). The popular name is to be considered together with the ballot title in determining the ballot title's sufficiency. <u>Id.</u></p>\n<p>The ballot title must include an impartial summary of the proposed amendment that will give the voter a fair understanding of the issues presented. <em>Hoban v. Hall,</em> <cross_reference>229 Ark. 416</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>417</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>316 S.W.2d 185</cross_reference> (1958); <em>Becker</em><em>v.

According to the court, if information omitted from the ballot title is an \"essential fact which would give the voter serious ground for reflection, it must be disclosed.\" <em>Bailey v. McCuen,</em> <cross_reference>318 Ark. 277</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>285</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>884 S.W.2d 938</cross_reference> (1994), citing <em>Finn v.

Hall, supra</em>; and<em>Walton v. McDonald,</em> <cross_reference>192 Ark. 1155</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>97 S.W.2d 81</cross_reference> (1936). At the same time, however, a ballot title must be brief and concise (<u>see</u> A.C.A. &#167;<cross_reference>7-9-107</cross_reference>(b)); otherwise voters could run afoul of A.C.A. &#167; <cross_reference>7-5-522</cross_reference>'s five minute limit in voting booths when other voters are waiting in line.<em>Bailey v. McCuen, supra.</em> The ballot title is not required to be perfect, nor is it reasonable to expect the title to cover or anticipate every possible legal argument the proposed measure might evoke. <em>Plugge v.</em><em>McCuen,</em> <cross_reference>310 Ark. 654</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>841 S.W.2d 139</cross_reference> (1992). The title, however, must be free from any misleading tendency, whether by amplification, omission, or fallacy; it must not be tinged with partisan coloring. <u>Id.</u> A ballot title must convey an intelligible idea of the scope and significance of a proposed change in the law. <em>Christian Civic Action Committee v. McCuen,</em><cross_reference>318 Ark. 241</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>884 S.W.2d 605</cross_reference> (1994). It has been stated that the ballot title must be: 1) intelligible, 2) honest, and 3) impartial. <em>Becker v.</em><em>McCuen,</em> <cross_reference>303 Ark. 482</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>798 S.W.2d 71</cross_reference> (1990), citing <em>Leigh v. Hall,</em><cross_reference>232 Ark. 558</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>339 S.W.2d 104</cross_reference> (1960).</p>\n<p>Having analyzed your proposed amendment, as well as your proposed popular name and ballot title under the above precepts, it is my conclusion that I must again reject both your proposed popular name and ballot title due to unresolved ambiguities in the <em>text</em> of your measure. There are a number of additions or changes to your popular name and ballot title which in my view are necessary in order to more fully and correctly summarize your proposal. I cannot, however, at this time, fairly or completely summarize the effect of your proposed measure to the electorate without the resolution of these ambiguities. I am therefore unable to substitute and certify a more suitable and correct ballot title under A.C.A. &#167; <cross_reference>7-9-107</cross_reference>\n(b).</p>\n<p>The following ambiguities must be clarified before I can perform my statutory duty:</p>\n<blockquote><p>  1. Section 5 of your proposed amendment states in pertinent part that: \"All retirement plans for state or local public servants hired after July 1, 2001, shall be maintained in approved privately managed retirement account(s) as may be chosen by the public servant, from any entity lawfully authorized to offer retirement plans within the State of Arkansas.\" It is unclear how this Section relates to Section 4 of your proposed amendment. Section 4 limits fringe benefits of public servants to twenty-five percent of direct salary and provides that fringe benefits, including funds paid towards retirement plans or accounts, shall be offered \"cafeteria style,\" with any unused funds paid over to the public servant in cash. Under Section 4, a public servant could presumably decline the provision of all fringe benefits, including any retirement fund or account and elect instead to take the authorized amount in cash. Section 5, on the other hand, requires all retirement plans for public servants first hired after July 1, 2000 to be maintained in approved privately managed retirement account(s) as may be chosen by the public servant, from entities authorized to offer retirement plans in Arkansas. This provision appears to require a formal, privately managed retirement plan or account for such public servants. It may be your intention to require such a privately managed fund or account to the extent the public servant <em>elects</em> retirement benefits as a fringe benefit. The language of Section 5 is unclear in this regard, however.</p>\n<p>  2. Section 5 of your proposed amendment also states that \"Public servants first hired before July 1, 2001, shall have the option of continuing to participate in their existing retirement plan, or to transfer the value of their retirement account to some other retirement system and direct that all contributions be made to the new retirement account or system on behalf of said public servant.\" The first ambiguity arising from this section is the question of whether such a public servant may elect to transfer the value of their retirement account to another <em>public</em> retirement system. The language in this regard is not restricted to privately managed retirement plans or systems. I am uncertain whether a transfer of value to another public system is authorized. The second ambiguity arising from this sentence is the meaning of the phrase \"the value of their retirement account.\" Your proposed amendment authorizes the \"value of [the public servant's] retirement account\" to be transferred to another system. I am uncertain, as an initial matter, whether this phrase refers only to any actual monies deposited to the credit of such an \"account\" or whether \"value\" is determined in some other manner. In addition, I cannot determine whether this \"value\" is to be measured before or after the required \"full funding\" by the legislature. I cannot determine how this provision will be applied to noncontributory pension plans for certain public servants, where no separate \"value\" is held in a discrete account to the credit of a particular public servant. <u>See,</u> <u>e.g.</u>, A.C.A. &#167; <cross_reference>24-12-120</cross_reference> (payment of certain city attorney pensions to be made, upon retirement, from city general fund); A.C.A. &#167; <cross_reference>24-12-121</cross_reference>\n(same as to city clerk-clerk treasurer); A.C.A. &#167;&#167; <cross_reference>24-12-122</cross_reference>&#8212;123; A.C.A. &#167;&#167; <cross_reference>24-12-125</cross_reference> and -127 (same as to other officers). In addition, it is unclear how such \"value\" will be measured for public servants who are not yet vested in the system.</p>\n<p>  3. Section 6(a) of your proposed amendment states in pertinent part that: \"Any person paying any part of <em>the tax</em> received by any city, county, or town of the State of Arkansas, whether directly or indirectly, shall be entitled to maintain suit to recover back <em>any</em> <em>illegal expenditures</em> by said public entity. . . .\" (Emphasis added). I cannot determine the effect of this provision on current law. There are currently two types of illegal exactions. The first is a \"public-funds case where the plaintiff contends that public funds generated from tax dollars are being misapplied or illegally spent.\" <em>Ghegan v. Weiss,</em> <cross_reference>338 Ark. 9</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>991 S.W.2d 536</cross_reference> (1999). The second is an \"illegal-tax case where plaintiff asserts that the tax itself is illegal or contrary to a constitutional or statutory provision.\" <u>Id.</u> It appears that Section 6 of your proposed amendment involves the first type of illegal exaction. Current law, however, does not require a plaintiff pursuing such an action to \"trace his or her individual tax contribution to the tax money that is allegedly being spent in an illegal manner. . . .\"  <u>Id.</u> at 16. Section 6(a) of your proposed amendment, however, appears to impose this requirement by restricting standing to persons \"paying any part of the tax. . . .\" I cannot determine whether it is your intention to change current law on this point. In addition, Section 6(a) authorizes such persons to maintain actions against \"<em>any</em> illegal expenditures by [the] public entity.\" (Emphasis added). It does not appear that the language of your amendment limits the cause of action to illegal expenditures made from \"the tax\" referenced earlier in the same sentence of your proposal. I cannot, therefore, determine the effect of this language on current law. Finally, the title of Section 6 of your proposed amendment is \"Right of Action Against Illegal Compensation, Benefits, or Theft of Public Property.\" The actual language of Section 6, however, relating to the recovery of \"any illegal expenditures\" is much broader. I am uncertain, therefore, whether Section 6 has reference only to illegal expenditures relating to the enumerated items in the title of Section 6, or to any and all \"illegal expenditures.\" The conflict in the title of Section 6 and the text of Section 6 causes confusion in this regard.</p></blockquote>\n<p>My office, in the certification of ballot titles and popular names, does not concern itself with the merits, philosophy, or ideology of proposed measures. I have no constitutional role in the shaping or drafting of such measures. My statutory mandate is embodied only in A.C.A. &#167; <cross_reference>7-9-107</cross_reference>\nand my duty is to the electorate. I am not your counsel in this matter and cannot advise you as to the substance of your proposal.</p>\n<p>At the same time, however, the Arkansas Supreme Court, through its decisions, has placed a practical duty on the Attorney General, in exercising his statutory duty, to include language in a ballot title about the effects of a proposed measure on current law. <u>See,</u> <u>e.g.,</u> <em>Finn</em><em>v. McCuen,</em> <cross_reference>303 Ark. 418</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>793 S.W.2d 34</cross_reference> (1990). Where the effects of a proposed measure on current law are unclear or ambiguous, it is impossible for me to perform my statutory duty to the satisfaction of the Arkansas Supreme Court without clarification of the ambiguities.</p>\n<p>My statutory duty, under these circumstances, is to reject your proposed ballot title, stating my reasons therefor, and to instruct you to \"redesign\" the proposed measure and ballot title. <u>See</u> A.C.A. &#167;<cross_reference>7-9-107</cross_reference>(c). You may, after clarification of the issue discussed above, resubmit your proposed amendment, along with a proposed popular name and ballot title, at your convenience. I anticipate, as noted above, that some changes or additions to your submitted ballot title may be necessary. I will be pleased to perform my statutory duties in this regard in a timely manner after resubmission.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>MARK PRYOR Attorney General</p>",

There are a number of additions or changes to your popular name and ballot title which in my view are necessary in order to more fully and correctly summarize your proposal. I cannot, however, at this time, fairly or completely summarize the effect of your proposed measure to the electorate without the resolution of these ambiguities. I am therefore unable to substitute and certify a more suitable and correct ballot title under A.C.A. &#167; <cross_reference>7-9-107</cross_reference>\n(b).</p>\n<p>The following ambiguities must be clarified before I can perform my statutory duty:</p>\n<blockquote><p>  1. Section 5 of your proposed amendment states in pertinent part that: \"All retirement plans for state or local public servants hired after July 1, 2001, shall be maintained in approved privately managed retirement account(s) as may be chosen by the public servant, from any entity lawfully authorized to offer retirement plans within the State of Arkansas.\" It is unclear how this Section relates to Section 4 of your proposed amendment. Section 4 limits fringe benefits of public servants to twenty-five percent of direct salary and provides that fringe benefits, including funds paid towards retirement plans or accounts, shall be offered \"cafeteria style,\" with any unused funds paid over to the public servant in cash. Under Section 4, a public servant could presumably decline the provision of all fringe benefits, including any retirement fund or account and elect instead to take the authorized amount in cash. Section 5, on the other hand, requires all retirement plans for public servants first hired after July 1, 2000 to be maintained in approved privately managed retirement account(s) as may be chosen by the public servant, from entities authorized to offer retirement plans in Arkansas. This provision appears to require a formal, privately managed retirement plan or account for such public servants. It may be your intention to require such a privately managed fund or account to the extent the public servant <em>elects</em> retirement benefits as a fringe benefit. The language of Section 5 is unclear in this regard, however.</p>\n<p>  2. Section 5 of your proposed amendment also states that \"Public servants first hired before July 1, 2001, shall have the option of continuing to participate in their existing retirement plan, or to transfer the value of their retirement account to some other retirement system and direct that all contributions be made to the new retirement account or system on behalf of said public servant.\" The first ambiguity arising from this section is the question of whether such a public servant may elect to transfer the value of their retirement account to another <em>public</em> retirement system. The language in this regard is not restricted to privately managed retirement plans or systems. I am uncertain whether a transfer of value to another public system is authorized. The second ambiguity arising from this sentence is the meaning of the phrase \"the value of their retirement account.\" Your proposed amendment authorizes the \"value of [the public servant's] retirement account\" to be transferred to another system. I am uncertain, as an initial matter, whether this phrase refers only to any actual monies deposited to the credit of such an \"account\" or whether \"value\" is determined in some other manner. In addition, I cannot determine whether this \"value\" is to be measured before or after the required \"full funding\" by the legislature. I cannot determine how this provision will be applied to noncontributory pension plans for certain public servants, where no separate \"value\" is held in a discrete account to the credit of a particular public servant. <u>See,</u> <u>e.g.</u>, A.C.A. &#167; <cross_reference>24-12-120</cross_reference> (payment of certain city attorney pensions to be made, upon retirement, from city general fund); A.C.A. &#167; <cross_reference>24-12-121</cross_reference>\n(same as to city clerk-clerk treasurer); A.C.A. &#167;&#167; <cross_reference>24-12-122</cross_reference>&#8212;123; A.C.A. &#167;&#167; <cross_reference>24-12-125</cross_reference> and -127 (same as to other officers). In addition, it is unclear how such \"value\" will be measured for public servants who are not yet vested in the system.</p>\n<p>  3. Section 6(a) of your proposed amendment states in pertinent part that: \"Any person paying any part of <em>the tax</em> received by any city, county, or town of the State of Arkansas, whether directly or indirectly, shall be entitled to maintain suit to recover back <em>any</em> <em>illegal expenditures</em> by said public entity. . . .\" (Emphasis added). I cannot determine the effect of this provision on current law. There are currently two types of illegal exactions. The first is a \"public-funds case where the plaintiff contends that public funds generated from tax dollars are being misapplied or illegally spent.\" <em>Ghegan v. Weiss,</em> <cross_reference><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1533983\"><a href=\"/opinion/1533983/ghegan-ghegan-inc-v-weiss/\"><span class=\"volume\">338</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ark.</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span></cross_reference>, <cross_reference><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1533983\"><a href=\"/opinion/1533983/ghegan-ghegan-inc-v-weiss/\"><span class=\"volume\">991</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">536</span></a></span></cross_reference> (1999). The second is an \"illegal-tax case where plaintiff asserts that the tax itself is illegal or contrary to a constitutional or statutory provision.\" <u>Id.</u> It appears that Section 6 of your proposed amendment involves the first type of illegal exaction. Current law, however, does not require a plaintiff pursuing such an action to \"trace his or her individual tax contribution to the tax money that is allegedly being spent in an illegal manner. . . .\"  <u>Id.</u> at 16. Section 6(a) of your proposed amendment, however, appears to impose this requirement by restricting standing to persons \"paying any part of the tax. . . .\" I cannot determine whether it is your intention to change current law on this point. In addition, Section 6(a) authorizes such persons to maintain actions against \"<em>any</em> illegal expenditures by [the] public entity.\" (Emphasis added). It does not appear that the language of your amendment limits the cause of action to illegal expenditures made from \"the tax\" referenced earlier in the same sentence of your proposal. I cannot, therefore, determine the effect of this language on current law. Finally, the title of Section 6 of your proposed amendment is \"Right of Action Against Illegal Compensation, Benefits, or Theft of Public Property.\" The actual language of Section 6, however, relating to the recovery of \"any illegal expenditures\" is much broader. I am uncertain, therefore, whether Section 6 has reference only to illegal expenditures relating to the enumerated items in the title of Section 6, or to any and all \"illegal expenditures.\" The conflict in the title of Section 6 and the text of Section 6 causes confusion in this regard.</p></blockquote>\n<p>My office, in the certification of ballot titles and popular names, does not concern itself with the merits, philosophy, or ideology of proposed measures. I have no constitutional role in the shaping or drafting of such measures. My statutory mandate is embodied only in A.C.A. &#167; <cross_reference>7-9-107</cross_reference>\nand my duty is to the electorate. I am not your counsel in this matter and cannot advise you as to the substance of your proposal.</p>\n<p>At the same time, however, the Arkansas Supreme Court, through its decisions, has placed a practical duty on the Attorney General, in exercising his statutory duty, to include language in a ballot title about the effects of a proposed measure on current law. <u>See,</u> <u>e.g.,</u> <em>Finn</em><em>v. McCuen,</em> <cross_reference><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2455506\"><a href=\"/opinion/2455506/finn-v-mccuen/\"><span class=\"volume\">303</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ark.</span> <span class=\"page\">418</span></a></span></cross_reference>, <cross_reference><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">793</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></span></cross_reference> (1990). Where the effects of a proposed measure on current law are unclear or ambiguous, it is impossible for me to perform my statutory duty to the satisfaction of the Arkansas Supreme Court without clarification of the ambiguities.</p>\n<p>My statutory duty, under these circumstances, is to reject your proposed ballot title, stating my reasons therefor, and to instruct you to \"redesign\" the proposed measure and ballot title. <u>See</u> A.C.A. &#167;<cross_reference>7-9-107</cross_reference>(c). You may, after clarification of the issue discussed above, resubmit your proposed amendment, along with a proposed popular name and ballot title, at your convenience. I anticipate, as noted above, that some changes or additions to your submitted ballot title may be necessary. I will be pleased to perform my statutory duties in this regard in a timely manner after resubmission.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>MARK PRYOR Attorney General</p>",
