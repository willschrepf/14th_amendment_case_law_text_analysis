For the defendant, the consequences of such an\nenhancement are great, and hence (as is always the case)\nwe treat the legal issues raised by this matter with\nseriousness. That said, we do not denigrate this appeal by\nobserving that the public might well wonder whether federal\njudges do not have more important things to do than to\nwrite the eighteen page opinion necessary to decide this\nessentially pedestrian question. If Congress would amend\nthe Sentencing Guidelines Enabling Act, 28 U.S.C.S 994 et\nseq., so as to enable the Sentencing Commission to afford\nfederal judges additional sentencing discretion, such efforts\ncould be avoided. If it does not, we can look forward to\ndecades more in which the dockets of the federal courts will\nbe glutted with such esoteric exercises, the energies of\ndistrict court and appellate judges sapped, and the Federal\nReporters filled with one tome after another on issues as\nbanal as whether a cook supervisor is a corrections officer.1\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. A rough survey, based on a Westlaw search, suggests that in the last\ntwelve months 2053 opinions of the Courts of Appeals have involved\n\n                               2\n\n\nThe subject of this opinion is the Defendant, Lawyer Lee\nWalker. Walker is a federal inmate who worked in the\nkitchen at the United States Penitentiary at Lewisburg,\nPennsylvania (USP-Lewisburg), and who, soon after he was\nnotified that he would be transferred from that job,\nassaulted his former boss David Wadeck, a prison cook\nsupervisor. In the case at the bar, we must determine\nwhether Wadeck was a corrections officer and whether\nWalker knew or had reasonable cause to believe that\nWadeck was a corrections officer, such that a three-level\nsentence enhancement under S 3A1.2(b) was appropriate.\nThe panel hearing Walker's first appeal defined the term\n\"corrections officer\" for us and did so narrowly. The prior\npanel focused on whether the victim was titled a corrections\nofficer, whether he spent a significant amount of time\nguarding prisoners, and whether he was guarding prisoners\nat the time he was assaulted. See United States v. Walker,\n149 F.3d 238, 242 (3d Cir. 1998). The District Court\nresentencing Walker applied this definition and found the\nOfficial Victim enhancement appropriate.\n\fAlthough, with the benefit of hindsight, one could argue\nthat the prior panel's definition of the term corrections\nofficer is unduly narrow, we are, needless to say, bound by\nit. Accordingly, our task is limited to assessing whether the\nDistrict Court resentencing Walker applied that definition\ncorrectly. Because we find that Wadeck was not titled a\ncorrections officer, and that the record does not support\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nsentencing guidelines issues. It would not be necessary to eliminate the\nsentencing guidelines to alleviate this problem. Widening the allowable\nguideline ranges might make it possible to reduce the Internal Revenue\nCode-like network of enhancements and adjustments. See Suggestions\nfor the Sentencing Commission, 8 Fed. Sentencing Rep. 10, 11\n(July/August 1995). The Commission would also be well served to pay\nbetter attention to the way courts apply the guidelines and to responding\nto courts' (and others') frustrations with the guidelines' overly\nmechanical characteristics. See Daniel J. Freed, Federal Sentencing in\nthe Wake of Guidelines: Unacceptable Limits on the Discretion of\nSentencers, 101 Yale L.J. 1681, 1750-51 (1992). For an incisive criticism\nof the guidelines scheme, in general, and suggestions for reform, see\ngenerally Kate Stith & Jose Cabranes, Fear of Judging: Sentencing\nGuidelines in Federal Courts (1998).\n\n                               3\n\n\neither the conclusion that Wadeck spent significant time\nguarding prisoners or that he was engaged in the act of\nguarding prisoners when he was struck by Walker, we hold\nthat the District Court erred as a matter of law in\nenhancing Walker's sentence. That said, because a broader\ndefinition of corrections officer seems to us to be more\nconsonant with the purpose of the \"Official Victim\"\nenhancement, we urge the Sentencing Commission to\nrevisit S 3A1.2(b) and the application notes accompanying\nit, thereby obviating the uncertainty that led to the prior\npanel's rendering.\n\nI.\n\nLawyer Lee Walker worked on a food service detail at\nUSP-Lewisburg. The penitentiary employed Wadeck as a\ncook supervisor. Wadeck served as Walker's immediate\nsupervisor. See infra Subsections II.A.1-3 (describing what\nthese supervisory duties entailed). One day during work,\nDonald Reed, the Food Services Supervisor in charge of the\nkitchen, informed Walker that Wadeck found Walker's work\nsubstandard and that Walker would be transferred to\nanother job position. After Walker's meeting with Reed,\nWadeck \"provoked\" Walker by calling him a\"punk,\" which\nis an extremely offensive term to prisoners at USP-\nLewisburg. United States v. Walker, 30 F. Supp. 2d 829,\n\f831 & n.1 (M.D. Pa. 1998). Incensed, Walker waited\napproximately an hour and then, while Wadeck prepared\nfood trays for inmates in the segregation unit, attacked\nWadeck by striking him from behind with a steel ladle or\npaddle. A struggle ensued during which Walker kicked\nWadeck several times. Wadeck fended off Walker by pulling\ndown Walker's pants. Other correctional staff summoned by\nWadeck detained Walker.\n\nWalker pled guilty to possession of a prohibited object by\nan inmate, 18 U.S.C. S 1791, and impeding a federal officer,\n19 U.S.C. S 111. The District Court sentenced Walker to 77\nmonths incarceration, applying a three-level enhancement\nto Walker's offense level under U.S.S.G. S 3A1.2(b). Section\n3A1.2, entitled \"Official Victim\" provides that\n\n                               4\n\n\n       [i]f--\n\n       . . .\n\n       (b) during the course of the offense or immediate\n       flight therefrom, the defendant or a person for\n       whose conduct the defendant is otherwise\n       accountable, knowing or having reasonable\n       cause to believe that a person was a law\n       enforcement or corrections officer, assaulted\n       such officer in a manner creating a substantial\n       risk of serious bodily injury,\n\n       increase by 3 levels.\n\nU.S.S.G. S 3A1.2(b) (bold in original).\n\nWalker appealed the enhancement. The prior panel\nconcluded that, in applying S 3A1.2(b), the District Court\nimpermissibly lumped \" `all prison employees, who work in\nfacilities and frequently interact with inmates' \" into the\nsmaller subset of individuals referred to as corrections\nofficers in S 3A1.2(b). Walker, 149 F.3d at 241 (quoting the\nDistrict Court).2 The panel held that, for purposes of\nS 3A1.2(b), a \" `corrections officer' . . . is a person distinct\nfrom other prison employees.\" Id. at 242. According to the\npanel, a corrections officer is defined as \"[1] any person so\ntitled, [2] any person, however titled, who spends significant\ntime guarding prisoners within a jail or correctional\ninstitution or in transit to or from or within a jail or\ncorrectional institution, and [3] all other persons assaulted\nwhile actually engaged in guarding prisoners.\" Id. Because\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. The panel held that the term \"corrections officer\" referred to a class\n\fof\nindividuals distinct from all federal employees at the prison because the\nenhancement provision in S 3A1.2(a) had been amended in 1992 to\ninclude all \"government officer[s] or employee[s],\" while S 3A1.2(b) was\nleft to include only corrections officers. Walker, 149 F.3d at 241. If\ngovernment officers or employees were not distinct from \"corrections\nofficer,\" the panel reasoned, the 1992 amendment would be superfluous.\nSee id. The panel found support for this reasoning in other statutory and\nregulatory provisions distinguishing between government employees and\ncorrections officers. See id. at 241-42. It also concluded that the plain\nmeaning of the term \"corrections officer\" was inconsistent with the plain\nmeaning of the word \"employee.\" See id. at 242.\n\n                               5\n\n\nthe panel found no evidence that Wadeck fit into any one\nof these three criteria, it reversed and remanded for\nresentencing, suggesting that the District Court conduct\nfurther fact-finding to see whether Wadeck qualified as a\ncorrections officer under S 3A1.2(b) and the panel's\ndefinition of that term. See id. at 243.\n\nOn resentencing, the District Court engaged in the\nsuggested fact-finding and made several conclusions of law\nbased on the panel's three-part, disjunctive test for\ndetermining whether Wadeck was a corrections officer. The\nCourt first found that Wadeck's job title was not\n\"corrections officer,\" but instead \"cook supervisor.\"\nAccordingly, he did not meet the first criterion of the test.\nThe Court next found that \"Wadeck routinely supervises\ninmates during their employment, is responsible for\nensuring that they are present during working hours, and\nis responsible for safety, security and discipline of inmates\nunder his supervision.\" Walker, 30 F. Supp. 2d at 833. The\nCourt therefore held that \"Wadeck spends significant time\nguarding prisoners within a correctional institution,\" and\nthat he was \"assaulted by Walker while actually engaged in\nguarding prisoners.\" Id. Concluding that the prior panel's\nsecond and third criteria for qualifying as a corrections\nofficer were met, the Court added a three-point\nenhancement to Walker's offense level pursuant to\nS 3A1.2(b). The District Court made no explicit findings\nregarding the mens rea component of the guideline. See\ninfra note 11 (discussing the mens rea issue).3\n\nII.\n\nThe first issue before us is whether Wadeck was a\ncorrections officer, as the prior panel defined that term.\nSpecifically, we must decide whether the District Court's\nfactual findings and the record at the resentencing hearing\nwarranted finding that a cook supervisor such as Wadeck\nspent a significant amount of time guarding prisoners or\n\f_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. The District Court properly exercised jurisdiction over the matter\nunder 18 U.S.C. S 1321. We exercise appellate jurisdiction over the final\njudgment of the District Court under 28 U.S.C. S 1291 and 18 U.S.C.\nS 3742(e)(1).\n\n                               6\n\n\nthat Wadeck was engaged in the act of guarding prisoners\nat the time Walker attacked him.4 We review de novo the\nDistrict Court's legal conclusions that both of these\nquestions should be answered in the affirmative. See United\nStates v. Bennett, 161 F.3d 171, 190 (3d Cir. 1998) (noting\nthat in a federal sentencing appeal \" `the District Court's\nfindings of facts are measured by the clearly erroneous test,\nbut our review of the legal component of its conclusions is\nplenary' \") (citations omitted).\n\nA.\n\nWe turn our attention first to whether Wadeck spent a\nsignificant amount of time guarding prisoners. The prior\npanel did not elaborate on what guarding prisoners means\nor what it understood a significant amount of time to be,\nbut it did provide us with certain outer boundaries. The\npanel went to great pains to point out that not all prison\nemployees are corrections officers, and that corrections\nofficers are a distinct subset of the federal prison employee\npopulation. See Walker, 149 F.3d at 241-43. 5 Therefore, we\nknow that any interpretation of \"spends a significant\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4. The District Court found as a matter of fact that Wadeck's job title\nwas not \"corrections officer.\" See Walker, 30 F. Supp. 2d at 833. Neither\nparty contests this finding of fact or the legal conclusion that arises\ntherefrom; i.e., that Wadeck's job title, by itself, did not place him in\nthe\nclass of individuals protected by S 3A1.2(b)'s Official Victim\nenhancement. We will not disturb the District Court's finding of fact on\nthis matter, which we review for clear error, see United States v.\nBennett,\n\n161 F.3d 171, 190 (3d Cir. 1998), nor we will revisit the legal conclusion\nthat the finding compelled.\n\n5. Examples of the panel's repeated efforts to make this point include\nstatements that: (1) The \"conclusion that `all prison employees, who work\nin facilities and frequently interact with inmates, fall within the\nprotection of 3A1.2(b),' is supported neither by citations to the record\nnor\nby legal authority.\" Walker, 149 F.3d at 241; (2) \"We are convinced that\na `corrections officer,' as referenced in section 3A1.2(b), is a person\n\fdistinct from other prison employees.\" Id. at 242; and (3) \" `If\ncorrections\nofficer' is to have meaning apart from `government employee,' and we\nconclude that it must, then Wadeck is not a corrections officer according\nto this record.\" Id. at 242-43 (emphasis added). The dissent seems to\nignore this distinction.\n\n                               7\n\n\namount of time guarding prisoners\" that sweeps too many\nindividuals employed at a prison into its web is too broad.\nWe also know that any interpretation that limits thefield to\ncorrections officers so titled is too narrow.\n\nBeginning with these two outer boundaries, we turn to\nthe common meanings of the word \"guard\" and the phrase\n\"spends a significant amount of time.\"6 Webster's defines\nthe verb \"to guard\" as \"to protect from danger,\" \"to\naccompany for protection,\" and to watch over so as to\nprevent escape . . . or restrain from violence or\nindiscretion.\" WEBSTER'S THIRD NEW INT'L DICTIONARY\nUNABRIDGED 1007 (1966). Additionally, Webster's defines the\nadjective \"significant\" as \"deserving to be considered:\nIMPORTANT, WEIGHTY, NOTABLE.\" Id. at 2116. Referencing\nWebster's sensible common usage, if Wadeck, the cook\nsupervisor, is to be a corrections officer for purposes of the\nguideline in question, an important, weighty, or notable\npart of his time working at ESP-Lewisburg must be spent\nprotecting people from danger, accompanying them for\nprotection, watching over prisoners so as to prevent their\nescape, and/or restraining them from violence or\nindiscretion. Under the prior panel's teaching, cook\nsupervisors must spend more time engaged in these\nactivities than prison employees generally, but need not\nspend as much time doing these things as corrections\nofficers so titled.\n\nWith this understanding of the prior panel's second\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6. The government would have us use the Department of Labor's and the\nOffice of Management and Budget's definitions of the term \"corrections\nofficer\" and the several factors contained therein, to determine whether\nWadeck was a corrections officer for purposes of the sentencing\nguidelines. Although the prior panel relied on these definitions to\ndismiss\n\nthe government's previous claim that all prison employees were\ncorrections officers, see Walker, 149 F.3d at 241-42 (quoting 1 U.S.\nDep't of Labor, Dictionary of Occupational Titles 268 (4th ed. rev. 1991);\nOffice of Management and Budget's Proposed 1997 Standard\nOccupational Classification Manual (visited July 1, 1998)\nhttp://stats.bls.gov/soc/soc/_5360.htm>), the panel crafted its own\n\fdefinition of the term corrections officer. It is that definition, as the\nlaw\nof the circuit and of this case, that controls on this appeal, not that of\nthe Department of Labor or the Office of Management and Budget.\n\n                               8\n\n\ncriterion for a S 3A1.2(b) enhancement in mind, we turn our\nattention to Wadeck's and cook supervisors' various duties\nat USP Lewisburg. We address a cook supervisors' general,\nprimary, and security duties in turn, deciding whether\nviewed alone or in concert they place Wadeck and other\ncook supervisors within the scope of the class protected by\nS 3A1.2(b)'s Official Victim enhancement.\n\n1. Wadeck's (and USP-Lewisburg Cook Supervisors')\n       General Duties\n\nMany of the characteristics of Wadeck's job that the\nDistrict Court relied upon at the resentencing hearing to\nenhance Walker's sentence do nothing to distinguish\nWadeck, or cook supervisors generally, from all other\nemployees at USP-Lewisburg. The Court found many facts\nrelevant to Wadeck's training, clothing, salary, and\nauthority to discipline and detain prisoners, but failed to\nconsider whether these facts mean that he engages in\nguarding as compared to other employees. We conclude\nthat they do not.\n\nWadeck received initial correctional techniques training\nwhen he was hired, and a refresher training in security\nonce a year; he was required to maintain proficiency in self-\ndefense techniques, firearms, and legal statutes involved in\ncorrectional management; he was titled a law enforcement\nofficer and accordingly received hazard pay and enhanced\npension benefits because he worked in close proximity to\nprison inmates; and he had the authority and responsibility\nto arrest and detain prisoners and respond to emergency\nsituations. As the testimony of those employed at USP-\nLewisburg and documentary evidence admitted at the\nresentencing hearing shows, however, every employee at\nUSP-Lewisburg received such benefits and training, had\nsuch authority and responsibilities, and was titled a law\nenforcement officer in order to receive enhanced pay and\nbenefits.7\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n7. In concluding that Wadeck guarded prisoners, the District Court also\nrelied on the fact that Wadeck wore a nylon belt on which he kept keys,\na radio with which he could communicate with his supervisors or call in\nassistance, and chits that could be traded in for other equipment. Again,\nmany prison employees wore such a belt--some of whom were not\nresponsible for guarding prisoners--while others did not--some of whom\n\fwere in fact in charge of guarding prisoners. Wadeck's belt, therefore,\ndoes not tighten the argument that he guarded prisoners.\n\n                               9\n\n\nBecause these general duties and job characteristics were\ncommon to all employees at USP-Lewisburg--from\ncorrections officers to cook supervisors to chaplains and\nsecretaries--none of these facts place Wadeck, or USP-\nLewisburg cook supervisors generally, into the subclass of\nprison employees that the prior panel was willing to\nrecognize as Official Victims under S 3A1.2(b). If these\nduties and characteristics were to qualify individuals as\nOfficial Victims, the prior panel's decision would be\nmeaningless, because all USP-Lewisburg prison employees\nwould be protected by S 3A1.2(b). This is a conclusion the\nprior panel explicitly and repeatedly rejected. See Walker,\n149 F.3d at 241-43; see also supra note 5 (enumerating\ninstances in which the panel rejected the conclusion that\nall prison employees qualified as corrections officers under\nthe Official Victim enhancement).\n\n2. Wadeck's (and USP-Lewisburg Cook Supervisors')\n       Primary Duties\n\nSimilarly, Wadeck's primary duties as a cook supervisor\ndo not place him within the guideline's protected class, as\nthe prior panel defined the contours of that class. Wadeck\nis charged with supervising inmates who are employees in\nthe kitchen area at USP-Lewisburg. As a cook supervisor,\nhis \"[p]rimary duties\" are to supervise and instruct \"inmate\nworkers in all phases of preparation, presentation and\ntimeliness of all food items that are placed on the serving\nline\" and to supervise \"inmates in the serving of all meals,\nand the sanitation of the department.\" Position Description,\nCook Supervisor, Appendix at 119.\n\nTo meet these obligations, a cook supervisor such as\nWadeck receives specialized training in food preparation; he\ntrains inmate workers in the art of prison cooking; he\nacquaints them with overall operation of the kitchen; he\nstaffs the kitchen and orders equipment and supplies; he\nsets the inmate workers' schedules and sets priorities to\nmeet feeding demands and deadlines; he makes sure the\ninmate-employees prepare nutritious and attractive meals\nin a timely and presentable manner; he evaluates his\ninmate employees' performance, reprimanding them or\nrecommending that they receive service awards; he pays the\ninmate workers their salaries; he counsels and motivates\n\n                               10\n\funwilling or potentially dangerous workers and considers\nsecurity and safety of other when assigning work; and in\nlock-down situations, when inmates are confined to their\ncells, he prepares food. Because the \"consequences of a\nfailed meal could be disastrous,\" the cook supervisor \"must\nmaintain constant vigilance of inmate workers.\" Id. at 121.\n\nIn our view, none of these supervisory duties connote\n\"guarding\" as the term is normally employed. In contrast,\nwe see them as more akin to any manager in a kitchen in\na restaurant or college cafeteria. In fact, Wadeck's\nsupervisor in the food services department described the\ntrade-type cook supervisor as one who receives additional\npay only because he is in frequent contact with inmates.\nThis is true, however, of every prison employee, save for\nthose who are actually charged to go extra lengths to\nreceive their hazard pay.\n\nThe government objects to this characterization of\nWadeck's supervisory duties. It contends in its brief, and\nasserted even more explicitly at oral argument, that any\ntime a prison employee at USP-Lewisburg--be it a\nsecretary, nurse, cook supervisor, or chaplain--is alone\nwith an inmate or supervising an inmate, the employee is\nguarding the inmate. Accordingly, submits the government,\na cook supervisor, who is often alone with inmates as they\nbake and cook, spends a significant amount of time\nguarding prisoners.\n\nWe find this argument--and its conflation of the acts of\nsupervising and guarding--unconvincing. As Wadeck's\ntestimony at the sentencing hearing established, a cook\nsupervisor such as Wadeck performs his multiple\nsupervisory tasks in many different parts of the kitchen\narea and dining halls adjoining it. Instead of spending a\nsignificant amount of time protecting inmates from danger,\naccompanying them for protection, watching over them so\nas to prevent escape, or restraining them from violence or\nindiscretion--as guarding is commonly defined--Wadeck\nmoves throughout the prison and in and out of contact with\ndifferent prisoners. This contact mainly consists of making\nsure food is prepared and served properly and in a timely\nmanner. To that end, Wadeck spends some of his time by\nthe freezers supervising the preparation of common fare\n\n                                11\n\n\ntrays and cold trays. He then moves to the main kitchen to\nsupervise the preparation of other trays for distribution in\nthe main line of the dining hall.\n\nWadeck also works in the bakery, the storeroom, the\nkitchen, the dining hall, the staff dining room, and in front\n\fof the main kitchen on the serving line. When he is in the\nkitchen with inmates, he is either alone with ten tofifteen\ninmates or with another cook supervisor and as many as\nsixty-five inmates, depending on the shift. Whether he is in\nthe kitchen supervising the inmates or away from the\nkitchen leaving the inmates to themselves, the doors to the\nkitchen always remain locked. This movement from station\nto station and task to task is not the work load of someone\nwatching over prisoners to prevent violence, escape, and\nindiscretion; again, it seems to be the schedule of a busy\nmanager of a large restaurant or cafeteria. While cook\nsupervisors monitor the preparation and delivery of food,\nthe locks on the kitchen doors and the attractiveness of a\nkitchen job to inmates, as well as the corrections officers,\nso titled, who are posted throughout the prison, perform\nthe safeguarding functions the government attributes to all\nprison employees.\n\nIf we were to accept the government's argument that any\ntime a prison employee was alone with prisoner, he would\nbe guarding that prisoner, we would run afoul of the prior\npanel's decision. Put simply, the government's argument\nproves too much. The argument sweeps spiritual advisors\nwho spend time alone with penitents, librarians and job\ncounselors, secretaries who work in the same offices as\nprisoners, and countless other prison employees into the\nclass of people who spend a significant amount of time\n\"guarding\" prisoners. Modern prisons are huge institutions,\nwith large numbers of employees performing a host of job\ndescriptions. By equating supervision of job tasks or time\nspent alone with prisoners with the act of guarding, the\ngovernment and the District Court bring us back to the first\ntime this Court heard Walker's appeal, where the\ngovernment had argued, and the District Court had found,\nthat all prison employees were corrections officers. This, we\nnow know, is not the case.\n\n                               12\n\n\nIn excepting chaplains, secretaries, and cook supervisors\nfrom the class of people who spend a significant amount of\ntime guarding, we do not slice the prior panel's decision too\nthinly. As Robby Wilson, a special investigative agent at\nUSP-Lewisburg testified, there were several groups of\nemployees at the prison, not titled corrections officers,\nwhose jobs seem to us to consist primarily, or at least\nsignificantly, of guarding. There are lieutenants posted\nthroughout the prison who instruct individuals to conduct\nshakedowns;8 security officers, locksmith officers, and\narmory officers who insure the integrity of locks and the\nbuilding; and senior officers, senior officer specialists,\nspecial investigative agents, and correctional counselors, all\nof whom spend most of their time doing the work of\n\fcorrectional officers, even though not titled as such. It is\nthese individuals who appear to fall under the prior panel's\ndefinition of the set of individuals whose job title is not\ncorrections officer, but who spend a significant amount of\ntheir time guarding prisoners.\n\nIn contrast, a cook supervisor is concerned with food\npreparation, and a prison chaplain with spiritual guidance.\nConsistent with his duties, a cook supervisor reports to the\nfood services administrator. And consistent with their\nguarding duties, the employees described in the preceding\nparagraph report to a captain and an associate warden who\nis in charge of custody. Even though a chaplain or cook\nsupervisor may be alone with prisoners as they perform\ntheir duties, in our view, they cannot be seen as guarding\nprisoners in the way that the aforementioned corrections\nofficers, and their counterparts do. Their primary duties\nand responsibilities are simply different in kind.\n\n3. Wadeck's (and USP-Lewisburg Cook Supervisors')\n       Security Obligations\n\nA cook supervisor has certain security obligations specific\nto his station that come closer to the act of guarding than\ndo his general and primary duties, but not close enough to\nqualify him as a corrections officer, as the prior panel\ndefined the term. According to the District Court's findings\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n8. According to Wadeck's testimony, \"prison foremen\" conduct\nshakedowns in the kitchen area.\n\n                               13\n\n\nof fact, a cook supervisor must (1) ensure that all inmates\nassigned to work in the kitchen were at their assigned\nstation during working hours; (2) track implements such as\nknives, which may be used as weapons; (3) ensure that all\nconfined items, such as foods that may be used to ferment\nalcohol, are not removed from the kitchen area; (4) respond\nto emergencies; (5) write reports that may lead to the\ndiscipline of inmates; and (6) join the staff from other\ndepartments (including staff members titled corrections\nofficers) and gather in the dining hall for purposes of\nsecurity and to make themselves available to inmates with\nproblems or complaints.\n\nAs mentioned above, the fourth, fifth, and sixth of these\nduties are shared by almost everyone at the prison. Every\nprison employee must respond to inmate fights or\nemergencies, every employee can write up an inmate, and\nmost employees gather in the dining hall to supervise\nmeals. As Wadeck testified, the write-ups he issues relate to\n\femployer-employee problems, such as tardiness, insolence\ntoward staff, sanitation, and failure to wear safety shoes.\nDuring meals in the dining hall, he is more concerned with\nthe delivery of food to inmates on the serving line. These\nthree security duties, therefore, do not demonstrate that\nWadeck spends a significant amount of time guarding\nprisoners.\n\nThe cook supervisor's second and third security duties,\nmonitoring the theft of implements that could be used to\nmake weapons and food supplies with which the prisoners\ncan make alcohol, may have special importance in a prison,9\nbut they are comparable to the duty to prevent theft that\nthe manager of any restaurant, navy mess hall, or college\ncafeteria would have. Wadeck spends twenty minutes each\nday filling out log sheets, noting that he checked to make\nsure that all of the kitchen's grills, locks, and bars are\nsecured, and that all of the knives and potentially\ndangerous tools that were dispensed are returned. This\nclerical monitoring is supplemented by shake-downs of\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n9. To that end, Wadeck received special training aimed at familiarizing\nhim with the types of objects that prisoners could use to make weapons\nand alcohol.\n\n                                14\n\n\nprisoners and kitchen areas, performed not by cooks\nsupervisors, such as Wadeck, but by prison employees\ntitled cook foremen. The cook supervisor job description\nalso charges Wadeck with maintaining the accountability of\ninmates at all times and preventing passage of illegal drugs\nand weapons.\n\nNothing about these supervisory duties, however, elevates\nWadeck's duties to guarding. Although the government and\nthe District Court frequently equate supervision with\nguarding, this conflation of terms is not enough to support\nthe legal conclusion that Wadeck spent a significant\namount of time guarding prisoners. It is not surprising that\nin a prison, where security is of paramount importance to\nevery employee, each employee would have some\nsupervisory obligations directed toward effecting that\nprimary end. This general responsibility, divided among the\nUSP-Lewisburg staff as specific tasks, cannot, however, be\nused to bootstrap Wadeck into Official Victim status for\nsentencing guidelines purposes.\n\nThat leaves the first security duty--ensuring that inmates\nassigned to work in the kitchen are at their assigned\nstation during working hours--as a ground upon which to\nfind a S3A1.2(b) enhancement under the prior panel's\n\fsecond criterion. Cook supervisors, with and without the\nassistance of corrections officers, perform three\"counts\"\nduring each shift on which they work to insure that each\ninmate is present. This duty, making sure that each inmate\nis at his station, serves two purposes. First, food does not\nget served if an inmate fails to report to his position and\nstay working there diligently. Second, the fact that a\nprisoner is not at his station could mean that he is\nattempting to escape. The first purpose is a concern of any\nkitchen manager and does not make the act of counting,\nguarding. Acting to effect the second purpose can\nconstitute guarding, but there is no evidence in the\nsentencing hearing record establishing that cook\nsupervisors at USP-Lewisburg spend a significant amount\nof time counting prisoners and preventing escape. These\ndiscrete acts of guarding, when understood in the context\nof Wadeck's other duties, are not enough to justify an\nOfficial Victim enhancement under the prior panel's\ndefinition.\n\n                               15\n\n\nAccordingly, for the reasons detailed in this Section, we\nconclude that the District Court erred as a matter of law in\nfinding that Wadeck spent a significant amount of time\nguarding prisoners, as the prior panel defined that term.\nSee Bennett, 161 F.3d at 190 (defining our plenary\nstandard of review over the legal component of sentencing\nguideline issues).\n\nB.\n\nHaving determined that Wadeck did not spend a\nsignificant amount of time guarding prisoners, we turn our\nattention to the prior panel's third criterion for applying\nS 3A1.2(b)--i.e., whether Wadeck was guarding prisoners at\nthe time Walker assaulted him. The District Court held that\n\"Wadeck was assaulted by Walker while actually engaged in\nguarding prisoners,\" but gave no explanation why this was\nthe case. Walker, 30 F. Supp. 2d at 833. The only evidence\nof what Wadeck was doing at the time Walker struck him\nfrom behind is contained in Wadeck's testimony at the\nresentencing hearing. This testimony shows that when\nWalker surprised him Wadeck was not guarding anyone;\ninstead it shows that Wadeck was, in essence, running an\nerrand:\n\n       Q: Mr. Wadeck what were you doing at the time Mr.\n       Walker assaulted you?\n\n       A: I was getting food trays to send down to\n       segregation.\n\f       Q: At that time were you supervising inmates?\n\n       A: At that time when I walked back I was coming off\n       the line during feeding, and I was supervising inmates\n       that were--actually they were coming to eat, and I just\n       had to run back and get some trays; there was nobody\n       else back there at the time.\n\nAppendix at 62-63 (testimony of Wadeck, being questioned\nby government on direct examination) (emphasis added).\n\n       Q: Now at the time Mr. Walker assaulted you, I\n       believe that you said you were getting food trays and\n       taking them to G block.\n\n                               16\n\n\n       A: Right, it was either G block or segregation that\n       called.\n\n       . . .\n\n       Q: So were you actually carrying the trays up there?\n\n       A: No, I wasn't, I was going back in the area where\n       they prepare the trays. There was a hallway there with\n       an opening in the door. I was standing in there\n       informing the two individuals that were in there that I\n       needed five more trays, and at that time I felt\n       something on the back of my head.\n\nAppendix at 77-78 (testimony of Wadeck, being questioned\nby Walker on cross examination).\n\nNot even an extremely generous reading of this testimony\nsupports the conclusion that when assaulted Wadeck was\nengaged in the act of guarding as that term is defined\nrepeatedly above. Had Wadeck been performing a count,\nbreaking up an inmate fight, or working as a corrections\nofficer when assaulted,10 we could reach the opposite\nconclusion. On this record, however, we cannot. Wadeck\nwas performing the type of task that led us to conclude in\nthe last Section that he does not spend a significant\namount of time guarding prisoners, but rather spends his\ntime insuring that meals are prepared and served\neffectively. Accordingly, we hold that the District Court\nerred as a matter of law in relying on this third criterion of\nthe prior panel's disjunctive three-part test to enhance\nWalker's sentence under S 3A1.2(b).\n\nIII.\n\nBecause we conclude that Wadeck was not titled a\n\fcorrections officer, that he did not spent significant time\nguarding prisoners, and that he was not guarding Walker\nat the time he was struck by Walker, we hold that the\nDistrict Court erroneously enhanced Walker's sentence\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n10.   Some cook supervisors work overtime as corrections officers. Wadeck\nhas   done this type of work in the past, but the record does not indicate\nhow   many hours he has worked as a corrections officer. At all events, he\nwas   not working as a corrections officer when assaulted by Walker.\n\n                                 17\n\n\nunder S 3A1.2(b). We will, therefore, vacate the judgment of\nthe District Court and remand with instructions that\nWalker be resentenced without an enhancement based on\nthe Official Victim guideline contained in S 3A1.2(b).11\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n11. Although we need not reach the issue, we note the possibility that\nWalker's sentence could also be vacated on the grounds that the District\nCourt did not make specific findings of fact or law with respect to\nS 3A1.2(b)'s mens rea requirement. The guideline requires that the\ndefendant \"know[ ] or hav[e] reasonable cause to believe that [the victim]\nwas a law enforcement or corrections officer . . ..\" U.S.S.G. S 3A1.2(b).\nAt his original sentencing hearing, Walker referred to Wadeck as a \"cop,\"\nsuggesting both that he knew or had reason to know that Wadeck was\na corrections officer as the prior panel defined that term, and that he\ntherefore harbored the requisite criminal intent when he assaulted\nWadeck. The prior panel mentioned this fact, but did not rule that this\nstatement disposed of the mens rea issue when remanding for\nresentencing. See Walker, 149 F.3d at 242-43. In its resentencing\nmemorandum, the District Court did not refer to Walker's testimony, and\nit made no factual or legal rulings regarding the intent element of\nS 3A1.2(b). In their absence, we are deprived of factual or legal\nconclusions to review on appeal.\n\n                                 18\n\n\nGARTH, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\nThis appeal seeks an answer to the question -- when is\na prison Cook Supervisor not a prison Corrections Officer?\nMy answer to that question, in the present context, differs\ndramatically from the majority's answer -- my answer is\nnever!\n\nThe majority's opinion holds that, pursuant to the\ndefinition set forth by an earlier panel of this court, United\nStates v. Walker, 149 F.3d 238 (3d Cir. 1998) (\"Walker I\"),\nCook Supervisor Wadeck, who was assaulted by the\nappellant Walker, neither was, nor is a Corrections Officer.1\n\fIn reaching this decision, the majority displays, as Justice\nFrankfurter stated, \"ignor[ance] as judges of what we know\nas men.\" Watts v. State of Indiana, 388 U.S. 49, 52 (1949).\nIt has set aside its understanding of the most basic and\nfundamental aspect of prison life: that prisons are\nessentially composed of two distinct groups of individuals\n-- those who are imprisoned and those who are charged\nwith guarding the prisoners. Clearly, Walker is a prisoner.\nJust as clearly, Wadeck -- whose primary responsibility as\na Cook Supervisor is to supervise prisoners in preparing\nfood and to ensure that the inmates are fed -- also has a\nsimultaneous secondary responsibility to guard the\nprisoners.\n\nThis latter responsibility, whether discharged by a Cook\nSupervisor, a prison engineer, a prison maintenance or\nequipment manager, or others who have prime\nresponsibilities, requires these prison personnel to prevent\nprisoner escapes, and to prevent violations of prison rules,\njust as it requires them to perform all and every function\nentailed in guarding the prison population. Hence, Wadeck,\nas a Cook Supervisor, simultaneously bears not only the\nresponsibility to ensure that the inmates are fed, but also\nbears the ongoing and continuous responsibility to guard\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. In Walker I, for purposes of S 3A1.2(b) of the United States Sentencing\nGuidelines, we defined \"corrections officer\" as \"any person so titled, any\nperson, however, titled, who spends significant time guarding prisoners\nwithin a jail or correctional institution or in transit to or from or\nwithin\na jail or correctional institution, and all other persons assaulted while\nactually engaged in guarding prisoners.\"\n\n                               19\n\n\nthese very prisoners. As such, he must necessarily be\nregarded as a Corrections Officer. To conclude that Cook\nSupervisor Wadeck is not a Corrections Officer is, as I have\njust indicated, to ignore what we know as a matter of\ncommon sense, and to construe Wadeck's position without\nreference to either his overall prison responsibilities or our\ngeneral knowledge of the way prisons operate.\n\nThe district court found that \"Wadeck routinely\nsupervises inmates during their employment, is responsible\nfor ensuring that they are present during work hours, and\nis responsible for safety, security and discipline of inmates\nunder his supervision.\" United States v. Walker, 30 F.\nSupp. 2d 829, 833 (M.D. Pa. 1998). Wadeck received\nspecialized training for his position, including training in\nsecurity and self-defense. Stationed throughout most of the\npenitentiary are correctional officers to guard the prisoners;\n\fhowever, -- and this is most significant to me-- no other\nCorrections Officers styled as such are regularly posted in\nthe kitchen area. Although Corrections Officers gather in\nthe dining hall for security purposes, they are not present\nin any other part of the kitchen either during or between\nmeals, leaving the maintenance of kitchen security solely to\nthose such as Cook Supervisor Wadeck.2 It is Wadeck and\nother Cook Supervisors who make sure that the doors and\ngrills are locked, search for contraband, prevent prisoners\nfrom escaping, and take action to prevent violations of\nprison rules. In the past Wadeck himself has responded to\nemergencies and reported violations.\n\nCook Supervisors such as Wadeck help monitor and\naccount for the whereabouts of prisoners assigned to their\ndepartment, and directly supervise prisoners employed in\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. The district court found, for example, that:\"Between 11:00 p.m. and\n7:00 a.m., there is only one Cook Supervisor on duty to supervise 16\ninmates without any other BOP employees, including Corrections Officers,\npresent in the kitchen area.\" Walker I, 30 F. Supp. 2d at 832 (emphasis\nadded).\n\nThe district court also found that: \"While Corrections Officers stand\nmain line, they are not stationed in any other part of the kitchen area\neither during meals or between meals, and security is left to the Food\nService Department.\" Id.\n\n                               20\n\n\nthe kitchen. And, although Cook Supervisors are not styled\nCorrections Officers, they wear dark blue uniforms to which\nare affixed the Bureau of Prisons emblem, wear duty belts,\nreceive specialized training in security matters that are\nunique to Food Services (such as knowledge of food\nproducts that can be utilized in the making of controlled or\nprohibited substances, such as alcohol), and are\nresponsible for reporting any missing inmates to\ncorrectional officers.3 Cook Supervisors are also authorized\nto pursue, arrest or detain escapees. Indeed, the district\ncourt found that Cook Supervisors also qualify for early\nretirement benefits as a \"law enforcement officer\" because,\nin addition to their food-related responsibilities, they share\nmany of the duties of correctional officers. Finally, the\ndistrict court also based its conclusion on the premise that\nWalker assaulted Wadeck while Wadeck was engaged in\nguarding prisoners.4\n\nWalker does not contest the district court's factual\nfindings, but rather only its legal conclusion that those\nfacts were sufficient to establish that Wadeck was a\nCorrections Officer within the meaning of Walker I. We\n\f\"exercise plenary review over legal questions about the\nmeaning of the sentencing guidelines, but apply the\ndeferential clearly erroneous standard to factual\ndeterminations underlying their application.\" United States\nv. Inigo, 925 F.2d 641, 658 (3d Cir. 1991).\n\nThe majority's opinion attempts to tailor the subset of\nprison employees that qualify as Corrections Officers based\non the significance of the amount of time they spend\nguarding prisoners. In this endeavor, I believe the majority\nhas erroneously and unnecessarily excluded from those\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. Employees specifically entitled \"correctional officers\" are employed at\nthe penitentiary. But, we have not limited the definition of Corrections\nOfficers, for purposes of the Sentencing Guidelines, to only those so\nentitled. See United States v. Walker, 149 F.3d 238, 242 (3d Cir. 1998).\nOur definition also included \"any person, . . . however titled, who spends\nsignificant time guarding prisoners . . . and all other persons assaulted\nwhile actually engaged in guarding prisoners.\" Id.\n\n4. Just prior to Walker's attack, in his supervisory role Wadeck was\ndirecting two prisoner-workers as to the number of food trays he needed\nprepared.\n\n                               21\n\n\ndischarging the functions of Corrections Officers all but\nthose who are actually entitled Corrections Officers, and\nthose employees such as lieutenants who instruct others to\nconduct shakedowns, security officers, locksmith officers,\narmory officers, senior officers, senior officer specialists,\nspecial investigative agents and correctional counselors.\n(Majority Op. at 13). Wadeck's food preparation activities\nshould not be construed to diminish the significant time he\nspends in guarding prisoners.\n\nThe majority places too much weight on the fact that any\nprison employee would be expected to respond to inmate\nfights or emergencies, write up inmates for violations, and\nmake themselves available to prisoners with problems or\ncomplaints should the situation arise. Id. at 14. Although it\nis true that in some manner all employees share the\nresponsibilities of prison security, my colleagues ignore the\nfact that unlike internal office prison personnel, for\nexample, Corrections Officers including Cook Supervisors\nare constantly and continuously engaged in these duties. It\nmakes no sense for the majority to discount the importance\nof the duties required of a Cook Supervisor merely because\nsome other employees might on a rare occasion assume\nthem as well. Nor is this analysis changed by the fact that,\nas the majority notes, it is cook foremen rather than Cook\nSupervisors who conduct shakedowns. (Id. at 15). The\n\fmajority did not feel the need to eliminate armory officers,\nlocksmith officers, special investigative agents, correctional\ncounselors and others from its list of those who would\nqualify as Corrections Officers merely because another\nprison official conducts the shakedowns. Similarly and as a\nmatter of logic, neither should Cook Supervisors fail to\nqualify as Corrections Officers on this basis.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent. As I read\nthe record, Walker I, and the district court's findings of fact,\nthe district court correctly categorized Wadeck as a\nCorrections Officer, and therefore properly enhanced\nWalker's sentence to reflect Wadeck's status as an official\nvictim.5\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5. The \"Official Victim\" provision of section 3A1.2 of the United States\nSentencing Guidelines provides that:\n\n                               22\n\n\nAs a second matter, the majority also addresses the issue\nof whether we should remand this case for resentencing of\nWalker because the majority charges that the district court\nfailed to make specific findings of fact with respect to\nWalker's knowledge of Wadeck's status as a Corrections\nOfficer. We must recognize, however, that our mandate to\nthe district court on remand in Walker I was to conduct\n\"further fact-finding and, applying our definition of\ncorrections officer, see if Walker is subject to the section\n3A1.2(b) `Official Victim' enhancement [of three levels].\"\nWalker, 149 F.3d at 243. It appears to me that the district\ncourt made no point of Walker's knowledge because our\nearlier opinion (Walker I) itself referred to Walker's\nadmission during his testimony that Wadeck was \"a cop.\"\nId. at 242. Indeed, a review of the record reveals this telling\nadmission.6\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n       If--\n\n       (a) the victim was a government officer or employee; a former\n       government officer or employee; or a member of the immediate\n       family of any of the above, and the offense of conviction was\n       motivated by such status, or\n\n       (b) during the course of the offense or immediateflight therefrom,\n       the defendant or a person for whose conduct the defendant is\n       otherwise accountable, knowing or having reasonable cause to\n       believe that a person was a law enforcement or corrections\n       officer, assaulted such officer in a manner creating a\n       substantial risk of serious bodily injury,\n\f       increase by 3 levels. U.S.S.G. S 3A1.2.\n\n6. During the Sentencing, the following exchange occurred between\nWalker and his counsel:\n\n       Q: If Mr. Wadeck had been an inmate and called you a punk, what\n       would you have done\n\n       A: I would have tried to kill him.\n\n       Q: You didn't try to kill Mr. Wadeck, did you?\n\n       A: No, he was a cop.\n\nSentencing Hearing Transcript at 8.\n\n                               23\n\n\nFurther, given the uniforms worn by Cook Supervisors,\nthe security measures taken by Cook Supervisors --\nincluding searching for contraband items, checking the\nsecurity in the kitchen and monitoring prisoners -- Walker\nhad to have been aware that Wadeck was a Corrections\nOfficer, even if not formally titled as such. Certainly, he\nknew that Wadeck was not a prisoner. Although the district\ncourt understandably made no explicit finding with regard\nto Walker's knowledge, presumably in light of our mandate,\nI am satisfied that the government's burden as to this\nrequirement was satisfied as well.\n\nI would hold that Wadeck was a Corrections Officer; that\nWalker knew he was; and that the district court did not err\nin enhancing Walker's sentence. Because the majority holds\notherwise, I respectfully dissent.\n\nA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n\n                               24\n\f",

For the defendant, the consequences of such an\nenhancement are great, and hence (as is always the case)\nwe treat the legal issues raised by this matter with\nseriousness. That said, we do not denigrate this appeal by\nobserving that the public might well wonder whether federal\njudges do not have more important things to do than to\nwrite the eighteen page opinion necessary to decide this\nessentially pedestrian question. If Congress would amend\nthe Sentencing Guidelines Enabling Act, 28 U.S.C.S 994 et\nseq., so as to enable the Sentencing Commission to afford\nfederal judges additional sentencing discretion, such efforts\ncould be avoided. If it does not, we can look forward to\ndecades more in which the dockets of the federal courts will\nbe glutted with such esoteric exercises, the energies of\ndistrict court and appellate judges sapped, and the Federal\nReporters filled with one tome after another on issues as\nbanal as whether a cook supervisor is a corrections officer.1\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. A rough survey, based on a Westlaw search, suggests that in the last\ntwelve months 2053 opinions of the Courts of Appeals have involved\n\n                               2\n\n\nThe subject of this opinion is the Defendant, Lawyer Lee\nWalker. Walker is a federal inmate who worked in the\nkitchen at the United States Penitentiary at Lewisburg,\nPennsylvania (USP-Lewisburg), and who, soon after he was\nnotified that he would be transferred from that job,\nassaulted his former boss David Wadeck, a prison cook\nsupervisor. In the case at the bar, we must determine\nwhether Wadeck was a corrections officer and whether\nWalker knew or had reasonable cause to believe that\nWadeck was a corrections officer, such that a three-level\nsentence enhancement under S 3A1.2(b) was appropriate.\nThe panel hearing Walker's first appeal defined the term\n\"corrections officer\" for us and did so narrowly. The prior\npanel focused on whether the victim was titled a corrections\nofficer, whether he spent a significant amount of time\nguarding prisoners, and whether he was guarding prisoners\nat the time he was assaulted. See United States v. Walker,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"755781\"><a href=\"/opinion/755781/united-states-v-lawyer-lee-walker/\"><span class=\"volume\">149</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">238</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 242 (3d Cir. 1998). The District Court\nresentencing Walker applied this definition and found the\nOfficial Victim enhancement appropriate.\n\fAlthough, with the benefit of hindsight, one could argue\nthat the prior panel's definition of the term corrections\nofficer is unduly narrow, we are, needless to say, bound by\nit. Accordingly, our task is limited to assessing whether the\nDistrict Court resentencing Walker applied that definition\ncorrectly. Because we find that Wadeck was not titled a\ncorrections officer, and that the record does not support\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nsentencing guidelines issues. It would not be necessary to eliminate the\nsentencing guidelines to alleviate this problem. Widening the allowable\nguideline ranges might make it possible to reduce the Internal Revenue\nCode-like network of enhancements and adjustments. See Suggestions\nfor the Sentencing Commission, 8 Fed. Sentencing Rep. 10, 11\n(July/August 1995). The Commission would also be well served to pay\nbetter attention to the way courts apply the guidelines and to responding\nto courts' (and others') frustrations with the guidelines' overly\nmechanical characteristics. See Daniel J. Freed, Federal Sentencing in\nthe Wake of Guidelines: Unacceptable Limits on the Discretion of\nSentencers, 101 Yale L.J. 1681, 1750-51 (1992). For an incisive criticism\nof the guidelines scheme, in general, and suggestions for reform, see\ngenerally Kate Stith & Jose Cabranes, Fear of Judging: Sentencing\nGuidelines in Federal Courts (1998).\n\n                               3\n\n\neither the conclusion that Wadeck spent significant time\nguarding prisoners or that he was engaged in the act of\nguarding prisoners when he was struck by Walker, we hold\nthat the District Court erred as a matter of law in\nenhancing Walker's sentence. That said, because a broader\ndefinition of corrections officer seems to us to be more\nconsonant with the purpose of the \"Official Victim\"\nenhancement, we urge the Sentencing Commission to\nrevisit S 3A1.2(b) and the application notes accompanying\nit, thereby obviating the uncertainty that led to the prior\npanel's rendering.\n\nI.\n\nLawyer Lee Walker worked on a food service detail at\nUSP-Lewisburg. The penitentiary employed Wadeck as a\ncook supervisor. Wadeck served as Walker's immediate\nsupervisor. See infra Subsections II.A.1-3 (describing what\nthese supervisory duties entailed). One day during work,\nDonald Reed, the Food Services Supervisor in charge of the\nkitchen, informed Walker that Wadeck found Walker's work\nsubstandard and that Walker would be transferred to\nanother job position. After Walker's meeting with Reed,\nWadeck \"provoked\" Walker by calling him a\"punk,\" which\nis an extremely offensive term to prisoners at USP-\nLewisburg. United States v. Walker, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2417177\"><a href=\"/opinion/2417177/united-states-v-walker/\"><span class=\"volume\">30</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">829</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\f831 & n.1 (M.D. Pa. 1998). Incensed, Walker waited\napproximately an hour and then, while Wadeck prepared\nfood trays for inmates in the segregation unit, attacked\nWadeck by striking him from behind with a steel ladle or\npaddle. A struggle ensued during which Walker kicked\nWadeck several times. Wadeck fended off Walker by pulling\ndown Walker's pants. Other correctional staff summoned by\nWadeck detained Walker.\n\nWalker pled guilty to possession of a prohibited object by\nan inmate, 18 U.S.C. S 1791, and impeding a federal officer,\n19 U.S.C. S 111. The District Court sentenced Walker to 77\nmonths incarceration, applying a three-level enhancement\nto Walker's offense level under U.S.S.G. S 3A1.2(b). Section\n3A1.2, entitled \"Official Victim\" provides that\n\n                               4\n\n\n       [i]f--\n\n       . . .\n\n       (b) during the course of the offense or immediate\n       flight therefrom, the defendant or a person for\n       whose conduct the defendant is otherwise\n       accountable, knowing or having reasonable\n       cause to believe that a person was a law\n       enforcement or corrections officer, assaulted\n       such officer in a manner creating a substantial\n       risk of serious bodily injury,\n\n       increase by 3 levels.\n\nU.S.S.G. S 3A1.2(b) (bold in original).\n\nWalker appealed the enhancement. The prior panel\nconcluded that, in applying S 3A1.2(b), the District Court\nimpermissibly lumped \" `all prison employees, who work in\nfacilities and frequently interact with inmates' \" into the\nsmaller subset of individuals referred to as corrections\nofficers in S 3A1.2(b). Walker, 149 F.3d at 241 (quoting the\nDistrict Court).2 The panel held that, for purposes of\nS 3A1.2(b), a \" `corrections officer' . . . is a person distinct\nfrom other prison employees.\" Id. at 242. According to the\npanel, a corrections officer is defined as \"[1] any person so\ntitled, [2] any person, however titled, who spends significant\ntime guarding prisoners within a jail or correctional\ninstitution or in transit to or from or within a jail or\ncorrectional institution, and [3] all other persons assaulted\nwhile actually engaged in guarding prisoners.\" Id. Because\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. The panel held that the term \"corrections officer\" referred to a class\n\fof\nindividuals distinct from all federal employees at the prison because the\nenhancement provision in S 3A1.2(a) had been amended in 1992 to\ninclude all \"government officer[s] or employee[s],\" while S 3A1.2(b) was\nleft to include only corrections officers. Walker, 149 F.3d at 241. If\ngovernment officers or employees were not distinct from \"corrections\nofficer,\" the panel reasoned, the 1992 amendment would be superfluous.\nSee id. The panel found support for this reasoning in other statutory and\nregulatory provisions distinguishing between government employees and\ncorrections officers. See id. at 241-42. It also concluded that the plain\nmeaning of the term \"corrections officer\" was inconsistent with the plain\nmeaning of the word \"employee.\" See id. at 242.\n\n                               5\n\n\nthe panel found no evidence that Wadeck fit into any one\nof these three criteria, it reversed and remanded for\nresentencing, suggesting that the District Court conduct\nfurther fact-finding to see whether Wadeck qualified as a\ncorrections officer under S 3A1.2(b) and the panel's\ndefinition of that term. See id. at 243.\n\nOn resentencing, the District Court engaged in the\nsuggested fact-finding and made several conclusions of law\nbased on the panel's three-part, disjunctive test for\ndetermining whether Wadeck was a corrections officer. The\nCourt first found that Wadeck's job title was not\n\"corrections officer,\" but instead \"cook supervisor.\"\nAccordingly, he did not meet the first criterion of the test.\nThe Court next found that \"Wadeck routinely supervises\ninmates during their employment, is responsible for\nensuring that they are present during working hours, and\nis responsible for safety, security and discipline of inmates\nunder his supervision.\" Walker, 30 F. Supp. 2d at 833. The\nCourt therefore held that \"Wadeck spends significant time\nguarding prisoners within a correctional institution,\" and\nthat he was \"assaulted by Walker while actually engaged in\nguarding prisoners.\" Id. Concluding that the prior panel's\nsecond and third criteria for qualifying as a corrections\nofficer were met, the Court added a three-point\nenhancement to Walker's offense level pursuant to\nS 3A1.2(b). The District Court made no explicit findings\nregarding the mens rea component of the guideline. See\ninfra note 11 (discussing the mens rea issue).3\n\nII.\n\nThe first issue before us is whether Wadeck was a\ncorrections officer, as the prior panel defined that term.\nSpecifically, we must decide whether the District Court's\nfactual findings and the record at the resentencing hearing\nwarranted finding that a cook supervisor such as Wadeck\nspent a significant amount of time guarding prisoners or\n\f_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. The District Court properly exercised jurisdiction over the matter\nunder 18 U.S.C. S 1321. We exercise appellate jurisdiction over the final\njudgment of the District Court under 28 U.S.C. S 1291 and 18 U.S.C.\nS 3742(e)(1).\n\n                               6\n\n\nthat Wadeck was engaged in the act of guarding prisoners\nat the time Walker attacked him.4 We review de novo the\nDistrict Court's legal conclusions that both of these\nquestions should be answered in the affirmative. See United\nStates v. Bennett, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"759470\"><a href=\"/opinion/759470/united-states-v-john-g-bennett-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">161</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">171</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 190 (3d Cir. 1998) (noting\nthat in a federal sentencing appeal \" `the District Court's\nfindings of facts are measured by the clearly erroneous test,\nbut our review of the legal component of its conclusions is\nplenary' \") (citations omitted).\n\nA.\n\nWe turn our attention first to whether Wadeck spent a\nsignificant amount of time guarding prisoners. The prior\npanel did not elaborate on what guarding prisoners means\nor what it understood a significant amount of time to be,\nbut it did provide us with certain outer boundaries. The\npanel went to great pains to point out that not all prison\nemployees are corrections officers, and that corrections\nofficers are a distinct subset of the federal prison employee\npopulation. See Walker, 149 F.3d at 241-43. 5 Therefore, we\nknow that any interpretation of \"spends a significant\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4. The District Court found as a matter of fact that Wadeck's job title\nwas not \"corrections officer.\" See Walker, 30 F. Supp. 2d at 833. Neither\nparty contests this finding of fact or the legal conclusion that arises\ntherefrom; i.e., that Wadeck's job title, by itself, did not place him in\nthe\nclass of individuals protected by S 3A1.2(b)'s Official Victim\nenhancement. We will not disturb the District Court's finding of fact on\nthis matter, which we review for clear error, see United States v.\nBennett,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"759470\"><a href=\"/opinion/759470/united-states-v-john-g-bennett-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">161</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">171</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 190 (3d Cir. 1998), nor we will revisit the legal conclusion\nthat the finding compelled.\n\n5. Examples of the panel's repeated efforts to make this point include\nstatements that: (1) The \"conclusion that `all prison employees, who work\nin facilities and frequently interact with inmates, fall within the\nprotection of 3A1.2(b),' is supported neither by citations to the record\nnor\nby legal authority.\" Walker, 149 F.3d at 241; (2) \"We are convinced that\na `corrections officer,' as referenced in section 3A1.2(b), is a person\n\fdistinct from other prison employees.\" Id. at 242; and (3) \" `If\ncorrections\nofficer' is to have meaning apart from `government employee,' and we\nconclude that it must, then Wadeck is not a corrections officer according\nto this record.\" Id. at 242-43 (emphasis added). The dissent seems to\nignore this distinction.\n\n                               7\n\n\namount of time guarding prisoners\" that sweeps too many\nindividuals employed at a prison into its web is too broad.\nWe also know that any interpretation that limits thefield to\ncorrections officers so titled is too narrow.\n\nBeginning with these two outer boundaries, we turn to\nthe common meanings of the word \"guard\" and the phrase\n\"spends a significant amount of time.\"6 Webster's defines\nthe verb \"to guard\" as \"to protect from danger,\" \"to\naccompany for protection,\" and to watch over so as to\nprevent escape . . . or restrain from violence or\nindiscretion.\" WEBSTER'S THIRD NEW INT'L DICTIONARY\nUNABRIDGED 1007 (1966). Additionally, Webster's defines the\nadjective \"significant\" as \"deserving to be considered:\nIMPORTANT, WEIGHTY, NOTABLE.\" Id. at 2116. Referencing\nWebster's sensible common usage, if Wadeck, the cook\nsupervisor, is to be a corrections officer for purposes of the\nguideline in question, an important, weighty, or notable\npart of his time working at ESP-Lewisburg must be spent\nprotecting people from danger, accompanying them for\nprotection, watching over prisoners so as to prevent their\nescape, and/or restraining them from violence or\nindiscretion. Under the prior panel's teaching, cook\nsupervisors must spend more time engaged in these\nactivities than prison employees generally, but need not\nspend as much time doing these things as corrections\nofficers so titled.\n\nWith this understanding of the prior panel's second\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6. The government would have us use the Department of Labor's and the\nOffice of Management and Budget's definitions of the term \"corrections\nofficer\" and the several factors contained therein, to determine whether\nWadeck was a corrections officer for purposes of the sentencing\nguidelines. Although the prior panel relied on these definitions to\ndismiss\n\nthe government's previous claim that all prison employees were\ncorrections officers, see Walker, 149 F.3d at 241-42 (quoting 1 U.S.\nDep't of Labor, Dictionary of Occupational Titles 268 (4th ed. rev. 1991);\nOffice of Management and Budget's Proposed 1997 Standard\nOccupational Classification Manual (visited July 1, 1998)\nhttp://stats.bls.gov/soc/soc/_5360.htm>), the panel crafted its own\n\fdefinition of the term corrections officer. It is that definition, as the\nlaw\nof the circuit and of this case, that controls on this appeal, not that of\nthe Department of Labor or the Office of Management and Budget.\n\n                               8\n\n\ncriterion for a S 3A1.2(b) enhancement in mind, we turn our\nattention to Wadeck's and cook supervisors' various duties\nat USP Lewisburg. We address a cook supervisors' general,\nprimary, and security duties in turn, deciding whether\nviewed alone or in concert they place Wadeck and other\ncook supervisors within the scope of the class protected by\nS 3A1.2(b)'s Official Victim enhancement.\n\n1. Wadeck's (and USP-Lewisburg Cook Supervisors')\n       General Duties\n\nMany of the characteristics of Wadeck's job that the\nDistrict Court relied upon at the resentencing hearing to\nenhance Walker's sentence do nothing to distinguish\nWadeck, or cook supervisors generally, from all other\nemployees at USP-Lewisburg. The Court found many facts\nrelevant to Wadeck's training, clothing, salary, and\nauthority to discipline and detain prisoners, but failed to\nconsider whether these facts mean that he engages in\nguarding as compared to other employees. We conclude\nthat they do not.\n\nWadeck received initial correctional techniques training\nwhen he was hired, and a refresher training in security\nonce a year; he was required to maintain proficiency in self-\ndefense techniques, firearms, and legal statutes involved in\ncorrectional management; he was titled a law enforcement\nofficer and accordingly received hazard pay and enhanced\npension benefits because he worked in close proximity to\nprison inmates; and he had the authority and responsibility\nto arrest and detain prisoners and respond to emergency\nsituations. As the testimony of those employed at USP-\nLewisburg and documentary evidence admitted at the\nresentencing hearing shows, however, every employee at\nUSP-Lewisburg received such benefits and training, had\nsuch authority and responsibilities, and was titled a law\nenforcement officer in order to receive enhanced pay and\nbenefits.7\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n7. In concluding that Wadeck guarded prisoners, the District Court also\nrelied on the fact that Wadeck wore a nylon belt on which he kept keys,\na radio with which he could communicate with his supervisors or call in\nassistance, and chits that could be traded in for other equipment. Again,\nmany prison employees wore such a belt--some of whom were not\nresponsible for guarding prisoners--while others did not--some of whom\n\fwere in fact in charge of guarding prisoners. Wadeck's belt, therefore,\ndoes not tighten the argument that he guarded prisoners.\n\n                               9\n\n\nBecause these general duties and job characteristics were\ncommon to all employees at USP-Lewisburg--from\ncorrections officers to cook supervisors to chaplains and\nsecretaries--none of these facts place Wadeck, or USP-\nLewisburg cook supervisors generally, into the subclass of\nprison employees that the prior panel was willing to\nrecognize as Official Victims under S 3A1.2(b). If these\nduties and characteristics were to qualify individuals as\nOfficial Victims, the prior panel's decision would be\nmeaningless, because all USP-Lewisburg prison employees\nwould be protected by S 3A1.2(b). This is a conclusion the\nprior panel explicitly and repeatedly rejected. See Walker,\n149 F.3d at 241-43; see also supra note 5 (enumerating\ninstances in which the panel rejected the conclusion that\nall prison employees qualified as corrections officers under\nthe Official Victim enhancement).\n\n2. Wadeck's (and USP-Lewisburg Cook Supervisors')\n       Primary Duties\n\nSimilarly, Wadeck's primary duties as a cook supervisor\ndo not place him within the guideline's protected class, as\nthe prior panel defined the contours of that class. Wadeck\nis charged with supervising inmates who are employees in\nthe kitchen area at USP-Lewisburg. As a cook supervisor,\nhis \"[p]rimary duties\" are to supervise and instruct \"inmate\nworkers in all phases of preparation, presentation and\ntimeliness of all food items that are placed on the serving\nline\" and to supervise \"inmates in the serving of all meals,\nand the sanitation of the department.\" Position Description,\nCook Supervisor, Appendix at 119.\n\nTo meet these obligations, a cook supervisor such as\nWadeck receives specialized training in food preparation; he\ntrains inmate workers in the art of prison cooking; he\nacquaints them with overall operation of the kitchen; he\nstaffs the kitchen and orders equipment and supplies; he\nsets the inmate workers' schedules and sets priorities to\nmeet feeding demands and deadlines; he makes sure the\ninmate-employees prepare nutritious and attractive meals\nin a timely and presentable manner; he evaluates his\ninmate employees' performance, reprimanding them or\nrecommending that they receive service awards; he pays the\ninmate workers their salaries; he counsels and motivates\n\n                               10\n\funwilling or potentially dangerous workers and considers\nsecurity and safety of other when assigning work; and in\nlock-down situations, when inmates are confined to their\ncells, he prepares food. Because the \"consequences of a\nfailed meal could be disastrous,\" the cook supervisor \"must\nmaintain constant vigilance of inmate workers.\" Id. at 121.\n\nIn our view, none of these supervisory duties connote\n\"guarding\" as the term is normally employed. In contrast,\nwe see them as more akin to any manager in a kitchen in\na restaurant or college cafeteria. In fact, Wadeck's\nsupervisor in the food services department described the\ntrade-type cook supervisor as one who receives additional\npay only because he is in frequent contact with inmates.\nThis is true, however, of every prison employee, save for\nthose who are actually charged to go extra lengths to\nreceive their hazard pay.\n\nThe government objects to this characterization of\nWadeck's supervisory duties. It contends in its brief, and\nasserted even more explicitly at oral argument, that any\ntime a prison employee at USP-Lewisburg--be it a\nsecretary, nurse, cook supervisor, or chaplain--is alone\nwith an inmate or supervising an inmate, the employee is\nguarding the inmate. Accordingly, submits the government,\na cook supervisor, who is often alone with inmates as they\nbake and cook, spends a significant amount of time\nguarding prisoners.\n\nWe find this argument--and its conflation of the acts of\nsupervising and guarding--unconvincing. As Wadeck's\ntestimony at the sentencing hearing established, a cook\nsupervisor such as Wadeck performs his multiple\nsupervisory tasks in many different parts of the kitchen\narea and dining halls adjoining it. Instead of spending a\nsignificant amount of time protecting inmates from danger,\naccompanying them for protection, watching over them so\nas to prevent escape, or restraining them from violence or\nindiscretion--as guarding is commonly defined--Wadeck\nmoves throughout the prison and in and out of contact with\ndifferent prisoners. This contact mainly consists of making\nsure food is prepared and served properly and in a timely\nmanner. To that end, Wadeck spends some of his time by\nthe freezers supervising the preparation of common fare\n\n                                11\n\n\ntrays and cold trays. He then moves to the main kitchen to\nsupervise the preparation of other trays for distribution in\nthe main line of the dining hall.\n\nWadeck also works in the bakery, the storeroom, the\nkitchen, the dining hall, the staff dining room, and in front\n\fof the main kitchen on the serving line. When he is in the\nkitchen with inmates, he is either alone with ten tofifteen\ninmates or with another cook supervisor and as many as\nsixty-five inmates, depending on the shift. Whether he is in\nthe kitchen supervising the inmates or away from the\nkitchen leaving the inmates to themselves, the doors to the\nkitchen always remain locked. This movement from station\nto station and task to task is not the work load of someone\nwatching over prisoners to prevent violence, escape, and\nindiscretion; again, it seems to be the schedule of a busy\nmanager of a large restaurant or cafeteria. While cook\nsupervisors monitor the preparation and delivery of food,\nthe locks on the kitchen doors and the attractiveness of a\nkitchen job to inmates, as well as the corrections officers,\nso titled, who are posted throughout the prison, perform\nthe safeguarding functions the government attributes to all\nprison employees.\n\nIf we were to accept the government's argument that any\ntime a prison employee was alone with prisoner, he would\nbe guarding that prisoner, we would run afoul of the prior\npanel's decision. Put simply, the government's argument\nproves too much. The argument sweeps spiritual advisors\nwho spend time alone with penitents, librarians and job\ncounselors, secretaries who work in the same offices as\nprisoners, and countless other prison employees into the\nclass of people who spend a significant amount of time\n\"guarding\" prisoners. Modern prisons are huge institutions,\nwith large numbers of employees performing a host of job\ndescriptions. By equating supervision of job tasks or time\nspent alone with prisoners with the act of guarding, the\ngovernment and the District Court bring us back to the first\ntime this Court heard Walker's appeal, where the\ngovernment had argued, and the District Court had found,\nthat all prison employees were corrections officers. This, we\nnow know, is not the case.\n\n                               12\n\n\nIn excepting chaplains, secretaries, and cook supervisors\nfrom the class of people who spend a significant amount of\ntime guarding, we do not slice the prior panel's decision too\nthinly. As Robby Wilson, a special investigative agent at\nUSP-Lewisburg testified, there were several groups of\nemployees at the prison, not titled corrections officers,\nwhose jobs seem to us to consist primarily, or at least\nsignificantly, of guarding. There are lieutenants posted\nthroughout the prison who instruct individuals to conduct\nshakedowns;8 security officers, locksmith officers, and\narmory officers who insure the integrity of locks and the\nbuilding; and senior officers, senior officer specialists,\nspecial investigative agents, and correctional counselors, all\nof whom spend most of their time doing the work of\n\fcorrectional officers, even though not titled as such. It is\nthese individuals who appear to fall under the prior panel's\ndefinition of the set of individuals whose job title is not\ncorrections officer, but who spend a significant amount of\ntheir time guarding prisoners.\n\nIn contrast, a cook supervisor is concerned with food\npreparation, and a prison chaplain with spiritual guidance.\nConsistent with his duties, a cook supervisor reports to the\nfood services administrator. And consistent with their\nguarding duties, the employees described in the preceding\nparagraph report to a captain and an associate warden who\nis in charge of custody. Even though a chaplain or cook\nsupervisor may be alone with prisoners as they perform\ntheir duties, in our view, they cannot be seen as guarding\nprisoners in the way that the aforementioned corrections\nofficers, and their counterparts do. Their primary duties\nand responsibilities are simply different in kind.\n\n3. Wadeck's (and USP-Lewisburg Cook Supervisors')\n       Security Obligations\n\nA cook supervisor has certain security obligations specific\nto his station that come closer to the act of guarding than\ndo his general and primary duties, but not close enough to\nqualify him as a corrections officer, as the prior panel\ndefined the term. According to the District Court's findings\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n8. According to Wadeck's testimony, \"prison foremen\" conduct\nshakedowns in the kitchen area.\n\n                               13\n\n\nof fact, a cook supervisor must (1) ensure that all inmates\nassigned to work in the kitchen were at their assigned\nstation during working hours; (2) track implements such as\nknives, which may be used as weapons; (3) ensure that all\nconfined items, such as foods that may be used to ferment\nalcohol, are not removed from the kitchen area; (4) respond\nto emergencies; (5) write reports that may lead to the\ndiscipline of inmates; and (6) join the staff from other\ndepartments (including staff members titled corrections\nofficers) and gather in the dining hall for purposes of\nsecurity and to make themselves available to inmates with\nproblems or complaints.\n\nAs mentioned above, the fourth, fifth, and sixth of these\nduties are shared by almost everyone at the prison. Every\nprison employee must respond to inmate fights or\nemergencies, every employee can write up an inmate, and\nmost employees gather in the dining hall to supervise\nmeals. As Wadeck testified, the write-ups he issues relate to\n\femployer-employee problems, such as tardiness, insolence\ntoward staff, sanitation, and failure to wear safety shoes.\nDuring meals in the dining hall, he is more concerned with\nthe delivery of food to inmates on the serving line. These\nthree security duties, therefore, do not demonstrate that\nWadeck spends a significant amount of time guarding\nprisoners.\n\nThe cook supervisor's second and third security duties,\nmonitoring the theft of implements that could be used to\nmake weapons and food supplies with which the prisoners\ncan make alcohol, may have special importance in a prison,9\nbut they are comparable to the duty to prevent theft that\nthe manager of any restaurant, navy mess hall, or college\ncafeteria would have. Wadeck spends twenty minutes each\nday filling out log sheets, noting that he checked to make\nsure that all of the kitchen's grills, locks, and bars are\nsecured, and that all of the knives and potentially\ndangerous tools that were dispensed are returned. This\nclerical monitoring is supplemented by shake-downs of\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n9. To that end, Wadeck received special training aimed at familiarizing\nhim with the types of objects that prisoners could use to make weapons\nand alcohol.\n\n                                14\n\n\nprisoners and kitchen areas, performed not by cooks\nsupervisors, such as Wadeck, but by prison employees\ntitled cook foremen. The cook supervisor job description\nalso charges Wadeck with maintaining the accountability of\ninmates at all times and preventing passage of illegal drugs\nand weapons.\n\nNothing about these supervisory duties, however, elevates\nWadeck's duties to guarding. Although the government and\nthe District Court frequently equate supervision with\nguarding, this conflation of terms is not enough to support\nthe legal conclusion that Wadeck spent a significant\namount of time guarding prisoners. It is not surprising that\nin a prison, where security is of paramount importance to\nevery employee, each employee would have some\nsupervisory obligations directed toward effecting that\nprimary end. This general responsibility, divided among the\nUSP-Lewisburg staff as specific tasks, cannot, however, be\nused to bootstrap Wadeck into Official Victim status for\nsentencing guidelines purposes.\n\nThat leaves the first security duty--ensuring that inmates\nassigned to work in the kitchen are at their assigned\nstation during working hours--as a ground upon which to\nfind a S3A1.2(b) enhancement under the prior panel's\n\fsecond criterion. Cook supervisors, with and without the\nassistance of corrections officers, perform three\"counts\"\nduring each shift on which they work to insure that each\ninmate is present. This duty, making sure that each inmate\nis at his station, serves two purposes. First, food does not\nget served if an inmate fails to report to his position and\nstay working there diligently. Second, the fact that a\nprisoner is not at his station could mean that he is\nattempting to escape. The first purpose is a concern of any\nkitchen manager and does not make the act of counting,\nguarding. Acting to effect the second purpose can\nconstitute guarding, but there is no evidence in the\nsentencing hearing record establishing that cook\nsupervisors at USP-Lewisburg spend a significant amount\nof time counting prisoners and preventing escape. These\ndiscrete acts of guarding, when understood in the context\nof Wadeck's other duties, are not enough to justify an\nOfficial Victim enhancement under the prior panel's\ndefinition.\n\n                               15\n\n\nAccordingly, for the reasons detailed in this Section, we\nconclude that the District Court erred as a matter of law in\nfinding that Wadeck spent a significant amount of time\nguarding prisoners, as the prior panel defined that term.\nSee Bennett, 161 F.3d at 190 (defining our plenary\nstandard of review over the legal component of sentencing\nguideline issues).\n\nB.\n\nHaving determined that Wadeck did not spend a\nsignificant amount of time guarding prisoners, we turn our\nattention to the prior panel's third criterion for applying\nS 3A1.2(b)--i.e., whether Wadeck was guarding prisoners at\nthe time Walker assaulted him. The District Court held that\n\"Wadeck was assaulted by Walker while actually engaged in\nguarding prisoners,\" but gave no explanation why this was\nthe case. Walker, 30 F. Supp. 2d at 833. The only evidence\nof what Wadeck was doing at the time Walker struck him\nfrom behind is contained in Wadeck's testimony at the\nresentencing hearing. This testimony shows that when\nWalker surprised him Wadeck was not guarding anyone;\ninstead it shows that Wadeck was, in essence, running an\nerrand:\n\n       Q: Mr. Wadeck what were you doing at the time Mr.\n       Walker assaulted you?\n\n       A: I was getting food trays to send down to\n       segregation.\n\f       Q: At that time were you supervising inmates?\n\n       A: At that time when I walked back I was coming off\n       the line during feeding, and I was supervising inmates\n       that were--actually they were coming to eat, and I just\n       had to run back and get some trays; there was nobody\n       else back there at the time.\n\nAppendix at 62-63 (testimony of Wadeck, being questioned\nby government on direct examination) (emphasis added).\n\n       Q: Now at the time Mr. Walker assaulted you, I\n       believe that you said you were getting food trays and\n       taking them to G block.\n\n                               16\n\n\n       A: Right, it was either G block or segregation that\n       called.\n\n       . . .\n\n       Q: So were you actually carrying the trays up there?\n\n       A: No, I wasn't, I was going back in the area where\n       they prepare the trays. There was a hallway there with\n       an opening in the door. I was standing in there\n       informing the two individuals that were in there that I\n       needed five more trays, and at that time I felt\n       something on the back of my head.\n\nAppendix at 77-78 (testimony of Wadeck, being questioned\nby Walker on cross examination).\n\nNot even an extremely generous reading of this testimony\nsupports the conclusion that when assaulted Wadeck was\nengaged in the act of guarding as that term is defined\nrepeatedly above. Had Wadeck been performing a count,\nbreaking up an inmate fight, or working as a corrections\nofficer when assaulted,10 we could reach the opposite\nconclusion. On this record, however, we cannot. Wadeck\nwas performing the type of task that led us to conclude in\nthe last Section that he does not spend a significant\namount of time guarding prisoners, but rather spends his\ntime insuring that meals are prepared and served\neffectively. Accordingly, we hold that the District Court\nerred as a matter of law in relying on this third criterion of\nthe prior panel's disjunctive three-part test to enhance\nWalker's sentence under S 3A1.2(b).\n\nIII.\n\nBecause we conclude that Wadeck was not titled a\n\fcorrections officer, that he did not spent significant time\nguarding prisoners, and that he was not guarding Walker\nat the time he was struck by Walker, we hold that the\nDistrict Court erroneously enhanced Walker's sentence\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n10.   Some cook supervisors work overtime as corrections officers. Wadeck\nhas   done this type of work in the past, but the record does not indicate\nhow   many hours he has worked as a corrections officer. At all events, he\nwas   not working as a corrections officer when assaulted by Walker.\n\n                                 17\n\n\nunder S 3A1.2(b). We will, therefore, vacate the judgment of\nthe District Court and remand with instructions that\nWalker be resentenced without an enhancement based on\nthe Official Victim guideline contained in S 3A1.2(b).11\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n11. Although we need not reach the issue, we note the possibility that\nWalker's sentence could also be vacated on the grounds that the District\nCourt did not make specific findings of fact or law with respect to\nS 3A1.2(b)'s mens rea requirement. The guideline requires that the\ndefendant \"know[ ] or hav[e] reasonable cause to believe that [the victim]\nwas a law enforcement or corrections officer . . ..\" U.S.S.G. S 3A1.2(b).\nAt his original sentencing hearing, Walker referred to Wadeck as a \"cop,\"\nsuggesting both that he knew or had reason to know that Wadeck was\na corrections officer as the prior panel defined that term, and that he\ntherefore harbored the requisite criminal intent when he assaulted\nWadeck. The prior panel mentioned this fact, but did not rule that this\nstatement disposed of the mens rea issue when remanding for\nresentencing. See Walker, 149 F.3d at 242-43. In its resentencing\nmemorandum, the District Court did not refer to Walker's testimony, and\nit made no factual or legal rulings regarding the intent element of\nS 3A1.2(b). In their absence, we are deprived of factual or legal\nconclusions to review on appeal.\n\n                                 18\n\n\nGARTH, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\nThis appeal seeks an answer to the question -- when is\na prison Cook Supervisor not a prison Corrections Officer?\nMy answer to that question, in the present context, differs\ndramatically from the majority's answer -- my answer is\nnever!\n\nThe majority's opinion holds that, pursuant to the\ndefinition set forth by an earlier panel of this court, United\nStates v. Walker, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"755781\"><a href=\"/opinion/755781/united-states-v-lawyer-lee-walker/\"><span class=\"volume\">149</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">238</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir. 1998) (\"Walker I\"),\nCook Supervisor Wadeck, who was assaulted by the\nappellant Walker, neither was, nor is a Corrections Officer.1\n\fIn reaching this decision, the majority displays, as Justice\nFrankfurter stated, \"ignor[ance] as judges of what we know\nas men.\" Watts v. State of Indiana, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">388</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 52 (1949).\nIt has set aside its understanding of the most basic and\nfundamental aspect of prison life: that prisons are\nessentially composed of two distinct groups of individuals\n-- those who are imprisoned and those who are charged\nwith guarding the prisoners. Clearly, Walker is a prisoner.\nJust as clearly, Wadeck -- whose primary responsibility as\na Cook Supervisor is to supervise prisoners in preparing\nfood and to ensure that the inmates are fed -- also has a\nsimultaneous secondary responsibility to guard the\nprisoners.\n\nThis latter responsibility, whether discharged by a Cook\nSupervisor, a prison engineer, a prison maintenance or\nequipment manager, or others who have prime\nresponsibilities, requires these prison personnel to prevent\nprisoner escapes, and to prevent violations of prison rules,\njust as it requires them to perform all and every function\nentailed in guarding the prison population. Hence, Wadeck,\nas a Cook Supervisor, simultaneously bears not only the\nresponsibility to ensure that the inmates are fed, but also\nbears the ongoing and continuous responsibility to guard\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. In Walker I, for purposes of S 3A1.2(b) of the United States Sentencing\nGuidelines, we defined \"corrections officer\" as \"any person so titled, any\nperson, however, titled, who spends significant time guarding prisoners\nwithin a jail or correctional institution or in transit to or from or\nwithin\na jail or correctional institution, and all other persons assaulted while\nactually engaged in guarding prisoners.\"\n\n                               19\n\n\nthese very prisoners. As such, he must necessarily be\nregarded as a Corrections Officer. To conclude that Cook\nSupervisor Wadeck is not a Corrections Officer is, as I have\njust indicated, to ignore what we know as a matter of\ncommon sense, and to construe Wadeck's position without\nreference to either his overall prison responsibilities or our\ngeneral knowledge of the way prisons operate.\n\nThe district court found that \"Wadeck routinely\nsupervises inmates during their employment, is responsible\nfor ensuring that they are present during work hours, and\nis responsible for safety, security and discipline of inmates\nunder his supervision.\" United States v. Walker, 30 F.\nSupp. 2d 829, 833 (M.D. Pa. 1998). Wadeck received\nspecialized training for his position, including training in\nsecurity and self-defense. Stationed throughout most of the\npenitentiary are correctional officers to guard the prisoners;\n\fhowever, -- and this is most significant to me-- no other\nCorrections Officers styled as such are regularly posted in\nthe kitchen area. Although Corrections Officers gather in\nthe dining hall for security purposes, they are not present\nin any other part of the kitchen either during or between\nmeals, leaving the maintenance of kitchen security solely to\nthose such as Cook Supervisor Wadeck.2 It is Wadeck and\nother Cook Supervisors who make sure that the doors and\ngrills are locked, search for contraband, prevent prisoners\nfrom escaping, and take action to prevent violations of\nprison rules. In the past Wadeck himself has responded to\nemergencies and reported violations.\n\nCook Supervisors such as Wadeck help monitor and\naccount for the whereabouts of prisoners assigned to their\ndepartment, and directly supervise prisoners employed in\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. The district court found, for example, that:\"Between 11:00 p.m. and\n7:00 a.m., there is only one Cook Supervisor on duty to supervise 16\ninmates without any other BOP employees, including Corrections Officers,\npresent in the kitchen area.\" Walker I, 30 F. Supp. 2d at 832 (emphasis\nadded).\n\nThe district court also found that: \"While Corrections Officers stand\nmain line, they are not stationed in any other part of the kitchen area\neither during meals or between meals, and security is left to the Food\nService Department.\" Id.\n\n                               20\n\n\nthe kitchen. And, although Cook Supervisors are not styled\nCorrections Officers, they wear dark blue uniforms to which\nare affixed the Bureau of Prisons emblem, wear duty belts,\nreceive specialized training in security matters that are\nunique to Food Services (such as knowledge of food\nproducts that can be utilized in the making of controlled or\nprohibited substances, such as alcohol), and are\nresponsible for reporting any missing inmates to\ncorrectional officers.3 Cook Supervisors are also authorized\nto pursue, arrest or detain escapees. Indeed, the district\ncourt found that Cook Supervisors also qualify for early\nretirement benefits as a \"law enforcement officer\" because,\nin addition to their food-related responsibilities, they share\nmany of the duties of correctional officers. Finally, the\ndistrict court also based its conclusion on the premise that\nWalker assaulted Wadeck while Wadeck was engaged in\nguarding prisoners.4\n\nWalker does not contest the district court's factual\nfindings, but rather only its legal conclusion that those\nfacts were sufficient to establish that Wadeck was a\nCorrections Officer within the meaning of Walker I. We\n\f\"exercise plenary review over legal questions about the\nmeaning of the sentencing guidelines, but apply the\ndeferential clearly erroneous standard to factual\ndeterminations underlying their application.\" United States\nv. Inigo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"555784\"><a href=\"/opinion/555784/united-states-v-antonio-ruben-inigo-united-states-of-america-v-raul/\"><span class=\"volume\">925</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">641</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 658 (3d Cir. 1991).\n\nThe majority's opinion attempts to tailor the subset of\nprison employees that qualify as Corrections Officers based\non the significance of the amount of time they spend\nguarding prisoners. In this endeavor, I believe the majority\nhas erroneously and unnecessarily excluded from those\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. Employees specifically entitled \"correctional officers\" are employed at\nthe penitentiary. But, we have not limited the definition of Corrections\nOfficers, for purposes of the Sentencing Guidelines, to only those so\nentitled. See United States v. Walker, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"755781\"><a href=\"/opinion/755781/united-states-v-lawyer-lee-walker/\"><span class=\"volume\">149</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">238</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 242 (3d Cir. 1998).\nOur definition also included \"any person, . . . however titled, who spends\nsignificant time guarding prisoners . . . and all other persons assaulted\nwhile actually engaged in guarding prisoners.\" Id.\n\n4. Just prior to Walker's attack, in his supervisory role Wadeck was\ndirecting two prisoner-workers as to the number of food trays he needed\nprepared.\n\n                               21\n\n\ndischarging the functions of Corrections Officers all but\nthose who are actually entitled Corrections Officers, and\nthose employees such as lieutenants who instruct others to\nconduct shakedowns, security officers, locksmith officers,\narmory officers, senior officers, senior officer specialists,\nspecial investigative agents and correctional counselors.\n(Majority Op. at 13). Wadeck's food preparation activities\nshould not be construed to diminish the significant time he\nspends in guarding prisoners.\n\nThe majority places too much weight on the fact that any\nprison employee would be expected to respond to inmate\nfights or emergencies, write up inmates for violations, and\nmake themselves available to prisoners with problems or\ncomplaints should the situation arise. Id. at 14. Although it\nis true that in some manner all employees share the\nresponsibilities of prison security, my colleagues ignore the\nfact that unlike internal office prison personnel, for\nexample, Corrections Officers including Cook Supervisors\nare constantly and continuously engaged in these duties. It\nmakes no sense for the majority to discount the importance\nof the duties required of a Cook Supervisor merely because\nsome other employees might on a rare occasion assume\nthem as well. Nor is this analysis changed by the fact that,\nas the majority notes, it is cook foremen rather than Cook\nSupervisors who conduct shakedowns. (Id. at 15). The\n\fmajority did not feel the need to eliminate armory officers,\nlocksmith officers, special investigative agents, correctional\ncounselors and others from its list of those who would\nqualify as Corrections Officers merely because another\nprison official conducts the shakedowns. Similarly and as a\nmatter of logic, neither should Cook Supervisors fail to\nqualify as Corrections Officers on this basis.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent. As I read\nthe record, Walker I, and the district court's findings of fact,\nthe district court correctly categorized Wadeck as a\nCorrections Officer, and therefore properly enhanced\nWalker's sentence to reflect Wadeck's status as an official\nvictim.5\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5. The \"Official Victim\" provision of section 3A1.2 of the United States\nSentencing Guidelines provides that:\n\n                               22\n\n\nAs a second matter, the majority also addresses the issue\nof whether we should remand this case for resentencing of\nWalker because the majority charges that the district court\nfailed to make specific findings of fact with respect to\nWalker's knowledge of Wadeck's status as a Corrections\nOfficer. We must recognize, however, that our mandate to\nthe district court on remand in Walker I was to conduct\n\"further fact-finding and, applying our definition of\ncorrections officer, see if Walker is subject to the section\n3A1.2(b) `Official Victim' enhancement [of three levels].\"\nWalker, 149 F.3d at 243. It appears to me that the district\ncourt made no point of Walker's knowledge because our\nearlier opinion (Walker I) itself referred to Walker's\nadmission during his testimony that Wadeck was \"a cop.\"\nId. at 242. Indeed, a review of the record reveals this telling\nadmission.6\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n       If--\n\n       (a) the victim was a government officer or employee; a former\n       government officer or employee; or a member of the immediate\n       family of any of the above, and the offense of conviction was\n       motivated by such status, or\n\n       (b) during the course of the offense or immediateflight therefrom,\n       the defendant or a person for whose conduct the defendant is\n       otherwise accountable, knowing or having reasonable cause to\n       believe that a person was a law enforcement or corrections\n       officer, assaulted such officer in a manner creating a\n       substantial risk of serious bodily injury,\n\f       increase by 3 levels. U.S.S.G. S 3A1.2.\n\n6. During the Sentencing, the following exchange occurred between\nWalker and his counsel:\n\n       Q: If Mr. Wadeck had been an inmate and called you a punk, what\n       would you have done\n\n       A: I would have tried to kill him.\n\n       Q: You didn't try to kill Mr. Wadeck, did you?\n\n       A: No, he was a cop.\n\nSentencing Hearing Transcript at 8.\n\n                               23\n\n\nFurther, given the uniforms worn by Cook Supervisors,\nthe security measures taken by Cook Supervisors --\nincluding searching for contraband items, checking the\nsecurity in the kitchen and monitoring prisoners -- Walker\nhad to have been aware that Wadeck was a Corrections\nOfficer, even if not formally titled as such. Certainly, he\nknew that Wadeck was not a prisoner. Although the district\ncourt understandably made no explicit finding with regard\nto Walker's knowledge, presumably in light of our mandate,\nI am satisfied that the government's burden as to this\nrequirement was satisfied as well.\n\nI would hold that Wadeck was a Corrections Officer; that\nWalker knew he was; and that the district court did not err\nin enhancing Walker's sentence. Because the majority holds\notherwise, I respectfully dissent.\n\nA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n\n                               24\n\f</pre>",
