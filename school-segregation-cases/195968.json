Shaq and Mary Doe — both minors represented by\n\ntheir guardians — and an unincorporated association calling itself Citizens Concerned\n\nAbout Our Children (CCC) challenge the district court’s judgment against them on\n\ntheir claims against the Broward County, Florida School Board for discrimination in\n\nviolation of the Equal Protection Clause. Addressing the two appeals together, we\n\nconclude that we lack jurisdiction over CCC’s interlocutory appeal, that Shaq and\n\nDoe’s interlocutory appeal (which is joined with CCC’s) is meritless, and that the\n\ndistrict court’s final summary judgment, the subject of the second appeal, was only\n\npartially correct.\n\n                                   I. Background\n\n       In a series of actions beginning thirty years ago, black plaintiffs have accused\n\nthe Broward County Schools of impermissibly race-conscious policies. One of those\n\nactions, begun in 1983, ended in 1987 with a consent decree. Among other things,\n\nthat decree required review of all student-assignment policies by a biracial committee\n\nand restriction of magnet programs to majority-black schools. School Board policy\n\nadopted under the decree requires consideration of the “racial/ethnic backgrounds of\n\nthe student population at each school in order to maintain a unitary school system.”\n\n(R.6-272 at 16.) The practical application of this policy was busing students (as it\n\n\n\n\n                                           3\n\fturned out far more black than white) to schools outside their neighborhoods. Plaintiff\n\nDoe rode one of these buses for five years, through fifth grade.\n\n      The School Board also adopted a magnet school policy under the consent\n\ndecree. The magnet programs, as the name implies, were special curricula designed\n\nto attract white students to mostly black schools. In the name of integration of\n\nmajority-black schools, some magnet programs preferred white pupils over black\n\npupils up to certain quotas. Shaq, a black pupil, was denied entry to a magnet\n\nprogram in a majority-black school for a month at the beginning of a school year,\n\nallegedly because of such a quota.\n\n      Shaq and Doe sued the School Board, claiming that Doe’s busing and Shaq’s\n\nexclusion from the magnet program violated their rights under the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment. In addition to these particularized claims by these individual plaintiffs,\n\nthe complaint included claims of discrimination throughout the Broward County\n\nsystem in funding, facilities, and resources. In asserting these claims, the two\n\nindividual plaintiffs were joined by CCC, which the complaint describes as “an\n\nunincorporated organization comprised of leaders in the African-American\n\ncommunity who have joined together for the common purpose of ending racially\n\ninspired policies of the BROWARD COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD.” (R.1-23 at 2.)\n\n\n\n\n                                          4\n\f       The district court dismissed CCC’s claims for want of standing, and it\n\ndismissed the claims of Shaq and Doe for equitable relief on the ground that, their\n\nclaims mooted, they too lacked standing. CCC, Shaq, and Doe filed an interlocutory\n\nappeal. The district court later granted the School Board summary judgment on Shaq\n\nand Doe’s remaining claims for damages on the ground that the School Board had a\n\ncompelling interest to justify its race-conscious policies — obeying the consent\n\ndecree. The court also concluded that Shaq and Doe lacked standing to assert claims\n\nof system-wide discrimination, and that Shaq and Doe had proffered insufficient\n\nevidence that their schools had poor facilities due to race. The court thus entered final\n\njudgment, and Shaq and Doe appealed.\n\n       The primary issue raised in the interlocutory appeal is whether CCC has\n\nstanding to pursue any of the stated claims. In the appeal from final judgment, the\n\nprincipal argument is that the district court erred in concluding that the evidence of\n\ndiscriminatory intent was insufficient.1 Because the district court ruled on motions for\n\nsummary judgment, our review is de novo, see NAACP v. Hunt, 891 F.2d 1555, 1559\n\n(11th Cir. 1990), and we apply the same familiar summary-judgment standards.\n\n                                         II. Discussion\n\n\n\n       1\n               Shaq and Doe also argue that Judge Ryskamp should have recused himself for unfair\nbias. This argument is meritless, and we reject it without further discussion. See 11th Cir. R. 36-1.\n\n                                                 5\n\fA. Jurisdiction over CCC’s Interlocutory Appeal2\n\n       This court raised the question whether appellate jurisdiction exists over CCC’s\n\ninterlocutory appeal. Having reviewed the parties’ briefs, we conclude that there is\n\nno jurisdiction.3\n\n       As Rule 54 implies, a judgment that eliminates fewer than all the claims or\n\nparties is not a final, appealable judgment; thus, an order dismissing one plaintiff, but\n\nnot others, is not immediately appealable by the dismissed plaintiff. See Robinson v.\n\nParke-Davis & Co., 685 F.2d 912, 913 (4th Cir. 1982).4 Absent some exception to the\n\n       2\n                Shaq and Doe joined in this interlocutory appeal to argue that the court improperly\ngranted summary judgment against them on their claims for injunctive relief because, having been\nadmitted to the school and programs of their choice, they have lost standing. We have jurisdiction\nover this appeal, see 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1), and see no merit to it. Showing standing is the\nplaintiffs’ burden, and we agree after reviewing the record that there is no evidence here that Shaq\nand Doe face any “real and immediate” danger of being assigned, because of their race, to a school\nthey do not wish to attend. City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 102, 103 S. Ct. 1660, 1665\n(1983). The district court thus did not err in entering summary judgment on this aspect of their\nclaims. Cf. id. at 106-09, 103 S. Ct. at 1667-69.\n       3\n               Our jurisdiction over Shaq and Doe’s interlocutory appeal does not confer\njurisdiction over CCC’s appeal: Pendant party appellate jurisdiction does not exist. See Swint v.\nChambers County Comm’n, 514 U.S. 35, 51, 115 S. Ct. 1203, 1212 (1995).\n       4\n                Judge Barkett cites Transamerica Finance Corp. v. Banton, Inc., 970 F.2d 810, 814-\n15 (11th Cir. 1992), for the proposition that parties dismissed from an action may always appeal\neven if the action continues with the other parties in the district court. We decline to read\nTransamerica, which concerned defendants against whom default judgments had been entered and\nRule 11 sanctions imposed, to have so broad an effect. First, the opinion itself focuses heavily on\nthe fact that sanction accompanied the default judgment, and that sanctions — being independent\nfrom the merits — often fall into the Cohen exception to the final judgment rule. See id. at 814-15.\nSecond, the court emphasized that in “the unique circumstances of this case,” the two defendants\n(there were eight defendants remaining) could not obtain appellate review of the sanctions. See id.\nat 815. Finally, interpreting Transamerica to authorize all interlocutory appeals by a party who has\nbeen dismissed from an action would be difficult to harmonize with Rule 54(b). See Fed. R. Civ.\n\n                                                 6\n\ffinal judgment rule, therefore, CCC could not appeal interlocutorily. CCC invokes\n\ntwo exceptions. First, it argues that the order had the effect of denying it the\n\ninjunctive relief it requested in its complaint, thus authorizing interlocutory appeal\n\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1). Cf. General Elec. Co. v. Marvel Rare Metals Co., 287\n\nU.S. 430, 431-33, 53 S. Ct. 202, 203-04 (1932). Second, it contends that standing is\n\na Cohen issue, and a district court order ruling on it is therefore immediately\n\nappealable. See Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 546, 69 S.\n\nCt. 1221, 1225-26 (1949). We reject both of these contentions.\n\n        On the first point, we acknowledge that an order that does not rule on a request\n\nfor injunctive relief, but that has the effect of denying it, may be immediately\n\nappealable. See Stringfellow v. Concerned Neighbors in Action, 480 U.S. 370, 379,\n\n107 S. Ct. 1177, 1183 (1987). For such an interlocutory order to be appealable before\n\nfinal judgment, the prospective appellant must show that the denial of injunctive relief\n\nhas a “serious, perhaps irreparable, consequence, and that the order can be effectually\n\nchallenged only by immediate appeal.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted)\n\n(quoting Carson v. American Brands, Inc. 450 U.S. 79, 84, 101 S. Ct. 993, 996 (1981)\n\n\n\n\nP. 54(b) (“In the absence of such a determination and direction [that is, 54(b) partial final judgment],\nany order or other form of decision, however designated, which adjudicates fewer than all the claims\nor the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties shall not terminate the action as to any of the\nclaims or parties . . . .”).\n\n                                                    7\n\f(in turn quoting Baltimore Contractors, Inc. v. Bodinger, 348 U.S. 176, 181, 75 S. Ct.\n\n249, 252 (1955)).\n\n       CCC cannot carry that burden. While the complaint does request injunctive\n\nrelief, and in its catchall conclusion, “additional preliminary and permanent relief as\n\nmay appear to the Court to be just and proper,” (R.1-23 at 9 ¶ 33(f)), in the nearly two\n\nyears between the filing of the complaint and the district court’s dismissal of CCC’s\n\nclaims for want of standing, CCC did not move for preliminary injunctive relief.\n\nAdmittedly, whether the request is for preliminary or permanent relief is not\n\nnecessarily dispositive, see Switzerland Cheese Ass’n, Inc. v. Horne’s Market, Inc.,\n\n385 U.S. 23, 25, 87 S. Ct. 193, 195 (1966), but a failure to seek immediate relief\n\nmilitates against a conclusion that delaying appeal to final judgment inflicts\n\nirreparable harm. See Carson, 450 U.S. at 84-85, 101 S. Ct. at 997; Shanks v. City of\n\nDallas, Tex., 752 F.2d 1092, 1096 (5th Cir. 1985). CCC has advanced no other reason\n\nwhy requiring it to wait to final judgment for review of the order ruling on standing\n\nwould have any “serious consequence.” We thus conclude that § 1292(a)(1) does not\n\nconfer jurisdiction.\n\n      Nor is the order immediately appealable under the Cohen doctrine, the other\n\nbasis CCC advances. This court has explicitly rejected the argument that a defendant\n\nmay immediately appeal, under the Cohen doctrine, a denial of dismissal for want of\n\n\n                                           8\n\fstanding. See Summit Med. Assocs., P.C. v. Pryor, No. 98-6129, slip op. at 3258 (11th\n\nCir. July 15, 1999). While this case presents the mirror image of the issue addressed\n\nin Pryor — here, it is the grant of a dismissal for want of standing — the appellants\n\ndo not explain why a dismissal for want of standing is any less reviewable on appeal\n\nfrom final judgment than denial of such a dismissal. Like the order in Pryor,\n\ntherefore, this order fails the third prong of the Cohen test. See Coopers & Lybrand\n\nv. Livesay, 437 U.S. 463, 468, 98 S. Ct. 2454, 2458 (1978) (listing elements). We\n\ntherefore conclude that we lack jurisdiction over CCC’s interlocutory appeal.\n\nB. Appeal from Final Judgment: Summary Judgment on Race Discrimination Claims\n\n      1. Standing to Complain of Facilities in Other Schools.\n\n      The plaintiffs object to the district court’s conclusion that they lacked standing\n\nto complain about inferior facilities and funding at majority-black schools that they\n\ndid not attend. We conclude that the district court did not err. While it is plain that\n\nthe plaintiffs have standing to complain of allegedly race-based differences in physical\n\nplant and programs that they have personally experienced, they cite no law permitting\n\nthem to complain of race-based disadvantages experienced only by other people. In\n\nthe voting rights context, the Supreme Court has held to the contrary that those not\n\nactually disadvantaged by a racial classification lack standing to object to it. See\n\nUnited States v. Hays, 515 U.S. 737, 743-44, 115 S. Ct. 2431, 2435 (1995) (“[E]ven\n\n\n                                           9\n\fif a governmental actor is discriminating on the basis of race, the resulting injury\n\naccords a basis for standing only to those persons who are personally denied equal\n\ntreatment by the challenged discriminatory conduct.”) (internal quotations omitted).\n\nThe district court thus properly dismissed the plaintiffs’ claims relating to schools they\n\ndid not attend.\n\n       2. Merits of Other Claims.\n\n               a. Overview. Because of the vagueness of the complaint and the\n\nplaintiffs’ inadequate briefing of the summary judgment motion and the appeal, the\n\nhardest issues in this case have been identifying the claims and what evidence the\n\nplaintiffs believe creates a genuine issue of material fact on their discrimination\n\nclaims.    The district court saw six claims: (1) Shaq’s claim that she was denied\n\nentrance to the T.V. Production/Communication and Broadcasting Program at\n\nHallandale High School for one month in 1994, because of her race; (2) Doe’s claim\n\nthat she was bused5 because of her race to Edgewood Elementary School during the\n\nschool year 1995-96; (3) Shaq’s claim that Hallandale High School has facilities\n\ninferior to other Broward schools because Hallandale is majority black; (4) Shaq’s\n\nclaim that Hallandale receives lower funding than other schools because it is majority\n\n       5\n               The parties use the term “starbursting” to describe the practice of transporting\nstudents to schools away from their neighborhoods in order to achieve desired racial ratios. We use\nthe ordinary term “busing,” which is what the School Board has always called the practice,\naccording to the deposition of its member Robert Parks.\n\n                                                10\n\fblack; (5) Doe’s claim that she was briefly put in a dropout-prevention program\n\nbecause of her race; and (6) Doe’s claim that she was denied sufficient textbooks\n\nbecause of her race. An attack on this characterization of the claims does not figure\n\namong the plaintiffs’ arguments, and we therefore accept it.\n\n      These claims fall into groups that are treated a little differently in equal\n\nprotection law. The first two claims challenge government policies that are explicitly\n\nracial: the magnet school racial preference policy and the County’s forced integration\n\npolicy. Because the challenged state action is explicitly racial, the policy is subject\n\nto strict scrutiny. See Adarand v. Peña, 515 U.S. 200, 227, 115 S. Ct. 2097, 2113\n\n(1995). What that means is that the policy is unconstitutional unless the governmental\n\nentity can prove that it has narrowly tailored the policy to serve a compelling interest.\n\nSee id.\n\n      The other claims are of disparate treatment; that is, the plaintiffs claim that a\n\ngovernmental entity is treating them differently because of their race, even though the\n\ngovernment has not advertised its motives in an explicit policy. To force the\n\ngovernmental entity to prove a compelling interest on this kind of claim, the plaintiffs\n\nmust show not only racially disparate treatment but also discriminatory purpose. See\n\nWashington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 238-48, 96 S. Ct. 2040, 2046-50 (1976). We\n\n\n\n\n                                           11\n\fconclude that the plaintiffs have not presented enough evidence of racially\n\ndiscriminatory intent to survive summary judgment.\n\n               b. Facially racial policies.\n\n                      I. Busing. Doe blames her race-targeted busing on the School\n\nBoard’s Policy 5000. That policy, which was approved in 1988 and covered student\n\nassignment, stated as one of its objectives the “[m]aintenance of a unitary system” —\n\nthat is, avoiding resegregation. (Expandable Folder #6, doc. 206, tab 14, at 307.) In\n\nestablishing school boundaries and attendance areas, the policy directed that\n\n“[c]onsideration should be given to the racial/ethnic backgrounds of the student\n\npopulation at each school in order to maintain a unitary school system.” (Id. at 308.)\n\nDuring the 1995-96 school year, the only year relevant to the remaining claims, the\n\nsuperintendent proposed implementing this policy by busing students such that the\n\npercentage of black pupils at each school was within 25 percentage points of the\n\ncountywide percentage. Doe was in fact bused to Edgewood Elementary School that\n\nyear (apparently her fifth-grade year) along with several children in her\n\nneighborhood.6 While this evidence does not give us any information about the\n\ncontours of the busing plan actually adopted, which apparently is not in the record, it\n\n       6\n                 Although this suit as it stands now is only one for damages, Doe testified in her\ndeposition that the only injury she suffered from attending Edgewood Elementary was being hit in\nthe chest by a softball. Doe did not explain the causal connection between the busing and the\nsoftball injury.\n\n                                               12\n\fwould permit a jury to conclude that a racial policy existed. For summary judgment\n\npurposes, we conclude that the School Board must show that the policy was narrowly\n\ntailored to serve a compelling interest.\n\n      The School Board justifies this policy by pointing to the 1987 consent decree.\n\nThe decree stated as the purpose of its provisions the “maintenance of a unitary\n\nsystem of education.” (Expandable Folder 6, doc. 206, tab 24, at 2.) While the\n\nmethods are not described in detail, the decree did obviously contemplate forced\n\nintegration, in obscure grammar:\n\n      6. THE SCHOOL BOARD OF BROWARD COUNTY, FLORIDA\n      shall implement the following:\n\n             A. That there will be an equal application of methods to ensure\n             that integration will be shared by both black and white students\n             within Broward County, and that the utilization of Magnet\n             Programs, other voluntary programs, and feasible and practical\n             boundary changes will be implemented to achieve such equal\n             application. However, a Bi-Racial Committee, hereinafter\n             provided for, shall review all boundaries on an annual basis for a\n             report to the Board.\n\n(Id.) The text of the consent decree is all we have to explain the obligations it\n\nimposed. How the School Board construed the consent decree, for instance, to arrive\n\nat the policy that resulted in Doe’s busing to Edgewood Elementary in 1995-96 is a\n\nmystery on the present record. At best we have some recommendations of the\n\nsuperintendent’s desegregation task force. They mention goals for racial distribution\n\n\n                                           13\n\fin the schools, but they do not get into any detail about student assignments designed\n\nto achieve those goals.\n\n      The School Board’s argument and this state of the record present two questions.\n\nThe first is whether compliance with a consent decree ever qualifies as a compelling\n\ninterest for Fourteenth Amendment purposes. This is a question of law, capable of\n\nresolution on motion for summary judgment. See Concrete Works of Colorado, Inc.\n\nv. Denver, 36 F.3d 1513, 1522 (10th Cir. 1994). The second question, however, is\n\nwhether this consent decree imposed this racial policy; for the reasons that follow,\n\nwe believe this to be a question of fact unresolved by the current record.\n\n      The legal question here — whether compliance with a consent decree of this\n\nsort is a compelling interest — answers itself yes, for two reasons. First, consent\n\ndecrees are a kind of court order. Parties must obey them, therefore, like court orders,\n\nand violation is punishable by contempt. See, e.g., Spallone v. United States, 493 U.S.\n\n265, 276, 110 S. Ct. 625, 632 (1990). A potential for contempt alone could provide\n\nthe School Board a compelling interest to observe racial policies. But there is more\n\nto the point than that. Any rule that punished the School Board for failing to disobey\n\nthe court would not comport with the sanctity of an unchallenged court order. See,\n\ne.g., W.R. Grace & Co. v. Local Union 759, Int’l Union of the United Rubber, Cork,\n\nLinoleum & Plastic Workers, 461 U.S. 757, 766, 103 S. Ct. 2177, 2183 (1983) (“It is\n\n\n                                          14\n\fbeyond question that obedience to judicial orders is an important public policy.”);\n\nPasadena City Bd. of Educ. v. Spangler, 427 U.S. 424, 439, 96 S. Ct. 2697, 2706\n\n(1976). This sanctity expresses itself in many forms, most strikingly in the collateral\n\norder doctrine, which requires a party subject to a court order to comply with it,\n\npending further review, even if the order arguably violates important constitutional\n\nrights. See Walker v. City of Birmingham, 308 U.S. 307, 315, 87 S. Ct. 1824, 1827\n\n(1967). In other contexts, the law considers an enjoined party to have lost the\n\ndiscretion to contravene a court order. See GTE Sylvania, Inc. v. Consumers Union\n\nof the United States, Inc., 445 U.S. 375, 386, 100 S. Ct. 1194, 1201 (1980). And court\n\norders do not bend simply because the enjoined party, by virtue of the order, becomes\n\nliable to a third party for damages. See W.R. Grace & Co., 461 U.S. at 769, 103 S. Ct.\n\nat 2185. Avoiding contempt and respecting the court that entered the consent decree\n\nsuffice to make obedience a compelling interest.7\n\n       But there is a second reason in this case to deem compliance to be a compelling\n\ninterest.    This consent decree rests on a foundation — redressing of past\n\ndiscriminatory wrongs — that the Supreme Court has explicitly recognized as a\n\n\n       7\n                The plaintiffs contend that, even if compliance with the decree were a compelling\ninterest in some cases, it should not justify discrimination against them because they were not parties\nto the litigation that generated the decree. We can’t see the logic here; whether or not these\nplaintiffs are bound by the decree, the School Board obviously is, and the question is whether the\nSchool Board has a compelling interest.\n\n                                                  15\n\fcompelling interest by itself when two elements are present.8 See Shaw v. Hunt, 116\n\nS. Ct. 1894, 1902 (1996). The first element is that the past discrimination be\n\n“identified.” Id. The other element is that the government entity have a “strong basis\n\nin evidence” to conclude that remedial action was necessary. Id. (quoting Wygant v.\n\nJackson Bd. of Educ., 476 U.S. 267, 277, 106 S. Ct. 1842, 1848 (1986) (plurality\n\nopinion)). Here these elements were satisfied at the time of the consent decree. The\n\npast discrimination is identified; it was the confinement of blacks to certain schools\n\nin the system. See Allen v. Board of Pub. Instruction, 312 F. Supp. 1127, 1131 (S.D.\n\nFla. 1970) (finding as fact that 17 of Broward County schools were all black, while\n\nanother five were more than 99% black). The County also had “sufficient evidence\n\nto justify the conclusion that there ha[d] been prior discrimination.” Wygant, 476 U.S.\n\nat 277, 106 S. Ct. at 1848-49 (plurality opinion). There were indeed findings of fact\n\nfrom litigation of the early ’70s that Broward County schools were segregated. While\n\nthe district court believed Broward County to be fully desegregated by 1979, (see\n\nOrder Granting Partial Summ. J. at 4-8, Expandable folder 4, doc. 189, ex. 1), no one\n\nhas argued here that the 1983 race-discrimination action was unfounded. Complying\n\n\n\n\n       8\n                The School Board has not argued that remedying past discrimination would justify\nits policies even without a consent decree, so we do not address that issue.\n\n                                              16\n\fwith this consent decree in particular thus reflected another compelling interest\n\nbeyond respect for court orders.\n\n      The conclusion that compliance with the consent decree is a compelling\n\ninterest, however, does not end the summary judgment analysis. Consent decrees are\n\na species of court order, but they are also a kind of contract. See Local No. 93, Int’l\n\nAss’n of Firefighters v. City of Cleveland, 478 U.S. 501, 519, 106 S. Ct. 3063, 3073\n\n(1986). And as is the case in the law of contracts, when a consent decree is\n\nambiguous, we may resort to extrinsic evidence to determine the parties’ intent. See\n\nUnited States v. ITT Continental Baking Co., 420 U.S. 223, 238, 95 S. Ct. 926, 935\n\n(1975). The consent decree here, which we quoted above, implicitly contemplated\n\nintegration in the sense of ensuring a black and white mix in the County’s schools.\n\nBecause of this, it may have implied that the School Board should engage in the\n\nbusing policy of which Doe complains. But we cannot go farther than that on the\n\npresent record, and that is not far enough.\n\n      A contravening compelling interest justifies an explicitly racial policy only\n\nwhen the policy is narrowly tailored to serve that interest. See Adarand v. Peña, 515\n\nU.S. 200, 227, 115 S. Ct. 2097, 2113 (1995).        When the compelling interest is\n\ncompliance with a court order, that means that the governmental entity must face a\n\nlikelihood of contempt under the order if it abandons the racial policy. The reason is\n\n\n                                          17\n\fobvious: any policy that exceeds the bare requirements of the order no longer closely\n\nfits the compelling interest because abandoning the policy is consistent with\n\nrespecting the court, avoiding contempt liability, and righting the wrongs underlying\n\nthe decree. In this case, not knowing whether the parties intended the consent decree\n\nto compel busing like that imposed on Doe makes it unknowable whether the court\n\nwould likely have held the School Board in contempt for refusing to bus Doe. The\n\nSchool Board has thus not carried its burden on this summary judgment motion of\n\neliminating a genuine issue of fact as to whether it had a compelling interest for Doe’s\n\nbusing during the 1995-96 school year.\n\n                    ii. Magnet school racial quotas.\n\n      Plaintiff Shaq attributes her temporary exclusion from a magnet program to a\n\nracial quota system that was in effect in the fall of 1994. That system, which\n\napparently resided in School Board policy 5004, is not in the record, as the district\n\ncourt pointed out. From deposition testimony and the amended 5004 that was\n\nproposed in 1996, however, a jury could find that whites were given preference for\n\nmagnet programs located in majority-black schools, until a certain desired percentage\n\nof white pupils was achieved. Shaq has thus presented enough evidence for present\n\npurposes to permit the conclusion that this policy was racial and therefore\n\nunconstitutional, unless it was narrowly tailored to serve a compelling interest.\n\n\n                                          18\n\f      Here again, as in the case of Doe’s busing, the School Board argues that the\n\n1987 consent decree provides a compelling interest. Again, the School Board’s\n\nproffered evidence leaves doubt as to how the consent decree compelled the racial\n\nquotas for magnet programs. There is more of a hint here of the link between the\n\ndecree and the policy; the decree explicitly mentions magnet programs, albeit in the\n\nsame obscure grammar:\n\n      6. THE SCHOOL BOARD OF BROWARD COUNTY, FLORIDA\n      shall implement the following:\n\n      ...\n\n             B. That Magnet Programs be primarily restricted to traditionally\n      black schools, and that the Plaintiff be provided with a list of all Magnet\n      Programs, real or imagined, their locations, and the current populations\n      of students participating in said programs.\n\n(Expandable Folder 6, doc. 206, tab 24, at 2.) Magnet programs also appeared in the\n\nsection of the decree addressing integration, which was quoted above, as a method of\n\nintegration. We could infer that some sort of racial preference would be necessary to\n\nachieve the desired desegregation. But what is missing is any evidence that quotas\n\n(whose details, as we said earlier, are unclear from this record) — not to mention the\n\nactual quota figures that were chosen — were necessary to comply with the consent\n\ndecree. We thus reach the same conclusion on this claim as we did on the Doe’s\n\nbusing claim: that the School Board has failed to carry its burden on summary\n\n\n                                          19\n\fjudgment to eliminate any genuine issue of fact concerning its defense of a compelling\n\ninterest.\n\n\n\n\n                                         20\n\f       c. Disparate treatment claims.\n\n       The remaining claims concern alleged racial distinctions that are not explicit.9\n\nAs we explained above, “official action will not be held unconstitutional solely\n\nbecause it results in racially disproportionate impact. . . . Proof of racially\n\ndiscriminatory intent or purpose is required to show a violation of the Equal\n\nProtection Clause.” Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Hous. Dev. Corp.,\n\n429 U.S. 252, 264-65, 97 S. Ct. 555, 563 (1977). In this summary judgment context,\n\nwhen the defendant has pointed to the absence of evidence of discriminatory intent,\n\nit becomes the plaintiffs’ job to produce such evidence. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett,\n\n477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 2552 (1986). If the plaintiffs have done so,\n\nthey have certainly not made it known — their brief to this court takes the district\n\ncourt to task for failing to “examine circumstantial evidence including the historic\n\nbackground of the decision making body, and legislative or administrative history of\n\nthe decisions,” but the plaintiffs have not provided us with a single record cite to any\n\n       9\n                By cunningly culling a quotation from a School Board rule, Doe tries to represent her\nclaim concerning tracking in a dropout prevention program as one arising from a facially racial\npolicy. The policy indeed limits how long pupils of a certain race may be kept apart from pupils of\nanother race, as Doe points out. But immediately above this provision, in all capital letters, the\npolicy (number 5150) behind the rule provides that “STUDENTS SHALL NOT BE ASSIGNED TO\nABILITY GROUPS, TRACKS, SPECIAL EDUCATION CLASSES, CLASSES FOR THE\nMENTALLY RETAINED, OR OTHER CURRICULAR OR EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES\nON THE BASIS OF RACE . . . .” (Expandable folder 6, doc. 206, tab 8.) This policy is thus not\nonly not explicitly racial, it is explicitly nonracial. Like the other claims discussed in this section,\ntherefore, this claim survives summary judgment only if the plaintiffs have produced sufficient\nevidence that this nonracial policy rests on a discriminatory purpose.\n\n                                                  21\n\fsuch history, or to any other evidence of discriminatory intent. In the interest of\n\njustice, we have nonetheless examined the record for such evidence. The record in\n\nfact does not support any assertion of discriminatory intent.\n\n      We can start with the background and historical facts that courts properly look\n\nto for evidence of intent. See Rogers v. Lodge, 458 U.S. 613, 623-27, 102 S. Ct. 3272,\n\n3278-81 (1982). The parties agree that the Broward County schools have been unitary\n\nsince 1979, and that unitariness came rapidly with good-faith compliance with court-\n\nordered desegregation. In 1987, following a lawsuit by some black parents, the\n\nSchool Board agreed to desegregation measures that, according to the plaintiffs here,\n\nwere not constitutionally necessary. When other black parents complained about the\n\ndesegregation measures — such as the busing at issue here — the Board established\n\na desegregation task force to make recommendations. The task force recommended\n\neliminating the busing, which the Board did. Furthermore, when parents complained\n\nthat suspension rates were higher for black pupils than white, the Board directed that\n\nschool improvement teams examine suspension practices. Finally, the Board’s\n\nmission statement is to provide the County’s “multi-cultural, diverse population” with\n\n“equal educational opportunity.” (Expandable folder 1, doc. 91, at 31.) This evidence\n\ndoes not support an inference of discriminatory intent. (Indeed, if anything this\n\nevidence depicts a well-meaning Board tiptoeing through a racial minefield.)\n\n\n                                         22\n\f       The plaintiffs’ other evidence is no better. The plaintiffs claim that for racial\n\nreasons western Broward schools get more money than eastern Broward schools, and\n\nthus have better facilities. But in none of the plaintiffs’ depositions of School Board\n\nmembers or school staff did the plaintiffs pursue the questions of how the Board\n\ndistributes money among schools in the County, how funding requests are made, how\n\nthe Board weighs requests, or how needs and priorities may differ from school to\n\nschool. In short, they did not elucidate the process in a level of detail that might\n\nexpose discriminatory intent.10 Instead, the plaintiffs point only to the disparities\n\nbetween schools that are the basis of their claims. This is just not enough evidence\n\nof intent when there are so many imaginable reasons for differences, both global —\n\neastern Broward County neighborhoods are older, and the schools there are older as\n\nwell — and specific to each spending decision, such as when the Board decides for\n\nlegitimate reasons that School X needs a new roof more than School Y needs a new\n\ngym floor. And as for Doe’s claim of racial tracking, the plaintiffs apparently did not\n\ndepose or seek affidavits from the officials who tracked Doe into an anti-dropout\n\n\n\n\n       10\n               What scanty testimony there is about certain spending items, such as new school\nconstruction, is that pupil health and safety, among other concerns peculiar to certain schools,\nmotivated decisions. (See Robert Parks Dep. at 51-54.)\n\n                                              23\n\fprogram. Thus, apart from Doe’s say-so11 we have no idea whether her placement\n\nthere was for racial or other reasons.\n\n       Because there is not enough evidence in the record for a jury to find that the\n\nSchool Board’s funding and resource decisions carry a racial taint, or that the School\n\nBoard or superintendent tracked Doe for racial reasons, the district court properly\n\ngranted summary judgment on those claims.\n\n                                      III. Conclusion\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we dismiss the interlocutory appeal of CCC and\n\naffirm the district court’s summary judgment against Shaq and Doe on their claims for\n\ninjunctive relief. We reverse, however, the summary judgment entered on Doe’s\n\nclaim for damages for being bused during the 1995-96 school year and Shaq’s claim\n\nfor damages for being denied entry into a magnet program for one month, and we\n\nremand for further proceedings on these two damages claims. The district court’s\n\njudgment is in all other respects affirmed.\n\n       NO. 97-5078        AFFIRMED IN PART;               DISMISSED FOR WANT OF\n\nAPPELLATE JURISDICTION IN PART.\n\n\n\n\n       11\n              Even on summary judgment, a court is not obliged to take as true testimony that is\nnot based on personal knowledge. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e).\n\n                                              24\n\f    NO. 98-4199 AFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED AND REMANDED IN\n\nPART.\n\n\n\n\n                            25\n\fBARKETT, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part:\n\n      I concur in the court’s resolution of Shaq and Doe’s appeal. I respectfully\n\ndissent, however, from the majority’s conclusion that the order from which an\n\ninterlocutory appeal is sought by Citizens Concerned About Our Children (“CCC”)\n\nis one which cannot be appealed under Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337\n\nU.S. 541 (1949). I believe our precedent requires the opposite result. Interlocutory\n\nappeals are permitted under the collateral order doctrine if the order appealed from:\n\n(1) conclusively determines the disputed question; (2) resolves an important issue\n\ncompletely separate from the merits of the action; and (3) is effectively unreviewable\n\non appeal from a final judgment. See Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. v. Mayacamas\n\nCorp., 485 U.S. 271, 276 (1988) (reiterating the three-prong test of Cohen).\n\n      The majority finds that the district court’s order fails the third prong of the\n\nCohen test, on the basis of Summit Med. Assocs., P.C. v. Pryor, 180 F.3d 1326 (11th\n\nCir. 1999). I believe Pryor is not applicable and that this case is controlled by\n\nTransamerica Commercial Finance Corp. v. Banton, 970 F.2d 810 (11th Cir. 1992).\n\n      In Pryor, the Court found that a defendant may not immediately appeal a denial\n\nof a motion to dismiss for lack of standing. See Pryor, 180 F.3d at 1334. The\n\nmajority suggests that a denial of a motion to dismiss for want of standing is no\n\ndifferent from a judgment granting a motion to dismiss for want of standing. See Maj.\n\n\n                                         26\n\fOp. at 8. I find these actions to be significantly different in their consequences. When\n\na district court denies a motion to dismiss, all parties remain in the lawsuit and\n\nparticipate therein. When a district court grants the motion, the dismissed party can\n\nno longer participate and loses any opportunity to clarify or to affect in any way the\n\nongoing case.\n\n       Moreover, this court’s precedent has explicitly recognized that excluding a\n\nparty from the remainder of an ongoing case satisfies the third prong of Cohen. In\n\nTransamerica Commercial Finance Corp, 970 F.2d at 814, this Court held that an\n\norder dismissing two of the eleven defendants in the case by granting motions for\n\nsummary and default judgments as a form of sanction was immediately appealable\n\nunder the collateral order doctrine. The court concluded that such an order, albeit not\n\na final judgment under section 1291, was appealable as an interlocutory order because\n\notherwise it would be effectively unreviewable.1 As the court noted, “having been\n\nsevered from the underlying case” the two defendants could lose their opportunity to\n\n\n\n\n       1\n                This does not mean that parties dismissed from an action may always have an\ninterlocutory appeal from a nonfinal order. The order must still fulfill the first two prongs of Cohen,\nthat is it must conclusively determine the disputed question and resolve an important issue\ncompletely separate from the merits of the action. In Transamerica, the Court concluded that the\ndistrict court’s order undoubtedly fulfilled the first two Cohen prongs. Similarly, the question\nwhether a party has standing easily fulfills the first two prongs of Cohen because a standing\ndetermination is both separate from the merits of a claim and conclusively resolves an important\ndisputed question. See Pryor, 180 F.3d at 1334.\n\n                                                  27\n\fappeal for “the remaining defendants may settle or may decide not to appeal.” Id. at\n\n815.\n\n       In the case at hand, CCC may be subjected to irreparable harm in the absence\n\nof an immediate appeal. The district court, in the same order dismissing CCC for lack\n\nof standing also denied Shaq and Doe the right to proceed with their claims for\n\ninjunctive relief. Furthermore, the district court’s September 5, 1997 order found that\n\nShaq and Doe did not have standing to challenge the alleged system-wide racial\n\ndisparities and inequities in the Broward County School system. The district court\n\nlimited Shaq and Doe’s claims to those practices directed towards them only at the\n\nschools which they attended.        These rulings relating to Shaq and Doe were\n\nincorporated in the subsequent final judgment but CCC was not included therein.\n\nTherefore, if the issue of CCC’s standing is not reviewed in this appeal, the parties\n\nwill have no avenue through which to challenge the alleged system-wide\n\nunconstitutional practices as CCC tried to do in its complaint.\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, I would find that this Court has appellate jurisdiction\n\nover CCC’s interlocutory appeal and should resolve the issues pertaining thereto.\n\n\n\n\n                                           28\n\f",

Shaq and Mary Doe — both minors represented by\n\ntheir guardians — and an unincorporated association calling itself Citizens Concerned\n\nAbout Our Children (CCC) challenge the district court’s judgment against them on\n\ntheir claims against the Broward County, Florida School Board for discrimination in\n\nviolation of the Equal Protection Clause. Addressing the two appeals together, we\n\nconclude that we lack jurisdiction over CCC’s interlocutory appeal, that Shaq and\n\nDoe’s interlocutory appeal (which is joined with CCC’s) is meritless, and that the\n\ndistrict court’s final summary judgment, the subject of the second appeal, was only\n\npartially correct.\n\n                                   I. Background\n\n       In a series of actions beginning thirty years ago, black plaintiffs have accused\n\nthe Broward County Schools of impermissibly race-conscious policies. One of those\n\nactions, begun in 1983, ended in 1987 with a consent decree. Among other things,\n\nthat decree required review of all student-assignment policies by a biracial committee\n\nand restriction of magnet programs to majority-black schools. School Board policy\n\nadopted under the decree requires consideration of the “racial/ethnic backgrounds of\n\nthe student population at each school in order to maintain a unitary school system.”\n\n(R.6-272 at 16.) The practical application of this policy was busing students (as it\n\n\n\n\n                                           3\n\fturned out far more black than white) to schools outside their neighborhoods. Plaintiff\n\nDoe rode one of these buses for five years, through fifth grade.\n\n      The School Board also adopted a magnet school policy under the consent\n\ndecree. The magnet programs, as the name implies, were special curricula designed\n\nto attract white students to mostly black schools. In the name of integration of\n\nmajority-black schools, some magnet programs preferred white pupils over black\n\npupils up to certain quotas. Shaq, a black pupil, was denied entry to a magnet\n\nprogram in a majority-black school for a month at the beginning of a school year,\n\nallegedly because of such a quota.\n\n      Shaq and Doe sued the School Board, claiming that Doe’s busing and Shaq’s\n\nexclusion from the magnet program violated their rights under the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment. In addition to these particularized claims by these individual plaintiffs,\n\nthe complaint included claims of discrimination throughout the Broward County\n\nsystem in funding, facilities, and resources. In asserting these claims, the two\n\nindividual plaintiffs were joined by CCC, which the complaint describes as “an\n\nunincorporated organization comprised of leaders in the African-American\n\ncommunity who have joined together for the common purpose of ending racially\n\ninspired policies of the BROWARD COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD.” (R.1-23 at 2.)\n\n\n\n\n                                          4\n\f       The district court dismissed CCC’s claims for want of standing, and it\n\ndismissed the claims of Shaq and Doe for equitable relief on the ground that, their\n\nclaims mooted, they too lacked standing. CCC, Shaq, and Doe filed an interlocutory\n\nappeal. The district court later granted the School Board summary judgment on Shaq\n\nand Doe’s remaining claims for damages on the ground that the School Board had a\n\ncompelling interest to justify its race-conscious policies — obeying the consent\n\ndecree. The court also concluded that Shaq and Doe lacked standing to assert claims\n\nof system-wide discrimination, and that Shaq and Doe had proffered insufficient\n\nevidence that their schools had poor facilities due to race. The court thus entered final\n\njudgment, and Shaq and Doe appealed.\n\n       The primary issue raised in the interlocutory appeal is whether CCC has\n\nstanding to pursue any of the stated claims. In the appeal from final judgment, the\n\nprincipal argument is that the district court erred in concluding that the evidence of\n\ndiscriminatory intent was insufficient.1 Because the district court ruled on motions for\n\nsummary judgment, our review is de novo, see NAACP v. Hunt, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"533854\"><a href=\"/opinion/533854/national-association-for-the-advancement-of-colored-people-naacp-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">891</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1555</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1559\n\n(11th Cir. 1990), and we apply the same familiar summary-judgment standards.\n\n                                         II. Discussion\n\n\n\n       1\n               Shaq and Doe also argue that Judge Ryskamp should have recused himself for unfair\nbias. This argument is meritless, and we reject it without further discussion. See 11th Cir. R. 36-1.\n\n                                                 5\n\fA. Jurisdiction over CCC’s Interlocutory Appeal2\n\n       This court raised the question whether appellate jurisdiction exists over CCC’s\n\ninterlocutory appeal. Having reviewed the parties’ briefs, we conclude that there is\n\nno jurisdiction.3\n\n       As Rule 54 implies, a judgment that eliminates fewer than all the claims or\n\nparties is not a final, appealable judgment; thus, an order dismissing one plaintiff, but\n\nnot others, is not immediately appealable by the dismissed plaintiff. See Robinson v.\n\nParke-Davis & Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"407594\"><a href=\"/opinion/407594/suzanne-l-robinson-and-constance-robinson-v-parke-davis-and-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">685</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">912</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 913 (4th Cir. 1982).4 Absent some exception to the\n\n       2\n                Shaq and Doe joined in this interlocutory appeal to argue that the court improperly\ngranted summary judgment against them on their claims for injunctive relief because, having been\nadmitted to the school and programs of their choice, they have lost standing. We have jurisdiction\nover this appeal, see 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1), and see no merit to it. Showing standing is the\nplaintiffs’ burden, and we agree after reviewing the record that there is no evidence here that Shaq\nand Doe face any “real and immediate” danger of being assigned, because of their race, to a school\nthey do not wish to attend.

We decline to read\nTransamerica, which concerned defendants against whom default judgments had been entered and\nRule 11 sanctions imposed, to have so broad an effect. First, the opinion itself focuses heavily on\nthe fact that sanction accompanied the default judgment, and that sanctions — being independent\nfrom the merits — often fall into the Cohen exception to the final judgment rule. See id. at 814-15.\nSecond, the court emphasized that in “the unique circumstances of this case,” the two defendants\n(there were eight defendants remaining) could not obtain appellate review of the sanctions. See id.\nat 815. Finally, interpreting Transamerica to authorize all interlocutory appeals by a party who has\nbeen dismissed from an action would be difficult to harmonize with Rule 54(b). See Fed.

First, it argues that the order had the effect of denying it the\n\ninjunctive relief it requested in its complaint, thus authorizing interlocutory appeal\n\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1). Cf.

We reject both of these contentions.\n\n        On the first point, we acknowledge that an order that does not rule on a request\n\nfor injunctive relief, but that has the effect of denying it, may be immediately\n\nappealable.

This court has explicitly rejected the argument that a defendant\n\nmay immediately appeal, under the Cohen doctrine, a denial of dismissal for want of\n\n\n                                           8\n\fstanding. See Summit Med. Assocs., P.C. v. Pryor, No. 98-6129, slip op. at 3258 (11th\n\nCir. July 15, 1999). While this case presents the mirror image of the issue addressed\n\nin Pryor — here, it is the grant of a dismissal for want of standing — the appellants\n\ndo not explain why a dismissal for want of standing is any less reviewable on appeal\n\nfrom final judgment than denial of such a dismissal. Like the order in Pryor,\n\ntherefore, this order fails the third prong of the Cohen test. See Coopers & Lybrand\n\nv.

Appeal from Final Judgment: Summary Judgment on Race Discrimination Claims\n\n      1. Standing to Complain of Facilities in Other Schools.\n\n      The plaintiffs object to the district court’s conclusion that they lacked standing\n\nto complain about inferior facilities and funding at majority-black schools that they\n\ndid not attend. We conclude that the district court did not err. While it is plain that\n\nthe plaintiffs have standing to complain of allegedly race-based differences in physical\n\nplant and programs that they have personally experienced, they cite no law permitting\n\nthem to complain of race-based disadvantages experienced only by other people. In\n\nthe voting rights context, the Supreme Court has held to the contrary that those not\n\nactually disadvantaged by a racial classification lack standing to object to it. See\n\nUnited States v. Hays, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117965\"><a href=\"/opinion/117965/united-states-v-hays/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">737</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 743-44, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117965\"><a href=\"/opinion/117965/united-states-v-hays/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Merits of Other Claims.\n\n               a. Overview. Because of the vagueness of the complaint and the\n\nplaintiffs’ inadequate briefing of the summary judgment motion and the appeal, the\n\nhardest issues in this case have been identifying the claims and what evidence the\n\nplaintiffs believe creates a genuine issue of material fact on their discrimination\n\nclaims.    The district court saw six claims: (1) Shaq’s claim that she was denied\n\nentrance to the T.V. Production/Communication and Broadcasting Program at\n\nHallandale High School for one month in 1994, because of her race; (2) Doe’s claim\n\nthat she was bused5 because of her race to Edgewood Elementary School during the\n\nschool year 1995-96; (3) Shaq’s claim that Hallandale High School has facilities\n\ninferior to other Broward schools because Hallandale is majority black; (4) Shaq’s\n\nclaim that Hallandale receives lower funding than other schools because it is majority\n\n       5\n               The parties use the term “starbursting” to describe the practice of transporting\nstudents to schools away from their neighborhoods in order to achieve desired racial ratios. We use\nthe ordinary term “busing,” which is what the School Board has always called the practice,\naccording to the deposition of its member Robert Parks.\n\n                                                10\n\fblack; (5) Doe’s claim that she was briefly put in a dropout-prevention program\n\nbecause of her race; and (6) Doe’s claim that she was denied sufficient textbooks\n\nbecause of her race. An attack on this characterization of the claims does not figure\n\namong the plaintiffs’ arguments, and we therefore accept it.\n\n      These claims fall into groups that are treated a little differently in equal\n\nprotection law. The first two claims challenge government policies that are explicitly\n\nracial: the magnet school racial preference policy and the County’s forced integration\n\npolicy. Because the challenged state action is explicitly racial, the policy is subject\n\nto strict scrutiny. See Adarand v. Peña, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117947\"><a href=\"/opinion/117947/adarand-constructors-inc-v-pena/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 227, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117947\"><a href=\"/opinion/117947/adarand-constructors-inc-v-pena/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

What that means is that the policy is unconstitutional unless the governmental\n\nentity can prove that it has narrowly tailored the policy to serve a compelling interest.\n\nSee id.\n\n      The other claims are of disparate treatment; that is, the plaintiffs claim that a\n\ngovernmental entity is treating them differently because of their race, even though the\n\ngovernment has not advertised its motives in an explicit policy. To force the\n\ngovernmental entity to prove a compelling interest on this kind of claim, the plaintiffs\n\nmust show not only racially disparate treatment but also discriminatory purpose.

Davis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109469\"><a href=\"/opinion/109469/washington-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">426</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">229</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 238-48, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109469\"><a href=\"/opinion/109469/washington-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In\n\nestablishing school boundaries and attendance areas, the policy directed that\n\n“[c]onsideration should be given to the racial/ethnic backgrounds of the student\n\npopulation at each school in order to maintain a unitary school system.” (Id. at 308.)\n\nDuring the 1995-96 school year, the only year relevant to the remaining claims, the\n\nsuperintendent proposed implementing this policy by busing students such that the\n\npercentage of black pupils at each school was within 25 percentage points of the\n\ncountywide percentage. Doe was in fact bused to Edgewood Elementary School that\n\nyear (apparently her fifth-grade year) along with several children in her\n\nneighborhood.6 While this evidence does not give us any information about the\n\ncontours of the busing plan actually adopted, which apparently is not in the record, it\n\n       6\n                 Although this suit as it stands now is only one for damages, Doe testified in her\ndeposition that the only injury she suffered from attending Edgewood Elementary was being hit in\nthe chest by a softball. Doe did not explain the causal connection between the busing and the\nsoftball injury.\n\n                                               12\n\fwould permit a jury to conclude that a racial policy existed. For summary judgment\n\npurposes, we conclude that the School Board must show that the policy was narrowly\n\ntailored to serve a compelling interest.\n\n      The School Board justifies this policy by pointing to the 1987 consent decree.\n\nThe decree stated as the purpose of its provisions the “maintenance of a unitary\n\nsystem of education.” (Expandable Folder 6, doc. 206, tab 24, at 2.) While the\n\nmethods are not described in detail, the decree did obviously contemplate forced\n\nintegration, in obscure grammar:\n\n      6. THE SCHOOL BOARD OF BROWARD COUNTY, FLORIDA\n      shall implement the following:\n\n             A. That there will be an equal application of methods to ensure\n             that integration will be shared by both black and white students\n             within Broward County, and that the utilization of Magnet\n             Programs, other voluntary programs, and feasible and practical\n             boundary changes will be implemented to achieve such equal\n             application. However, a Bi-Racial Committee, hereinafter\n             provided for, shall review all boundaries on an annual basis for a\n             report to the Board.\n\n(Id.) The text of the consent decree is all we have to explain the obligations it\n\nimposed. How the School Board construed the consent decree, for instance, to arrive\n\nat the policy that resulted in Doe’s busing to Edgewood Elementary in 1995-96 is a\n\nmystery on the present record. At best we have some recommendations of the\n\nsuperintendent’s desegregation task force. They mention goals for racial distribution\n\n\n                                           13\n\fin the schools, but they do not get into any detail about student assignments designed\n\nto achieve those goals.\n\n      The School Board’s argument and this state of the record present two questions.\n\nThe first is whether compliance with a consent decree ever qualifies as a compelling\n\ninterest for Fourteenth Amendment purposes. This is a question of law, capable of\n\nresolution on motion for summary judgment. See Concrete Works of Colorado, Inc.\n\nv. Denver, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"679519\"><a href=\"/opinion/679519/concrete-works-of-colorado-inc-a-colorado-corporation-v-denver-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1513</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1522 (10th Cir. 1994). The second question, however, is\n\nwhether this consent decree imposed this racial policy; for the reasons that follow,\n\nwe believe this to be a question of fact unresolved by the current record.\n\n      The legal question here — whether compliance with a consent decree of this\n\nsort is a compelling interest — answers itself yes, for two reasons. First, consent\n\ndecrees are a kind of court order. Parties must obey them, therefore, like court orders,\n\nand violation is punishable by contempt. See, e.g., Spallone v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112349\"><a href=\"/opinion/112349/spallone-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">493</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">265</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 276, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112349\"><a href=\"/opinion/112349/spallone-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

A potential for contempt alone could provide\n\nthe School Board a compelling interest to observe racial policies. But there is more\n\nto the point than that. Any rule that punished the School Board for failing to disobey\n\nthe court would not comport with the sanctity of an unchallenged court order. See,\n\ne.g., W.R. Grace & Co. v.

This sanctity expresses itself in many forms, most strikingly in the collateral\n\norder doctrine, which requires a party subject to a court order to comply with it,\n\npending further review, even if the order arguably violates important constitutional\n\nrights. See Walker v.

In other contexts, the law considers an enjoined party to have lost the\n\ndiscretion to contravene a court order. See GTE Sylvania, Inc. v. Consumers Union\n\nof the United States, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110227\"><a href=\"/opinion/110227/gte-sylvania-inc-v-consumers-union-of-united-states-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">445</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">375</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 386, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110227\"><a href=\"/opinion/110227/gte-sylvania-inc-v-consumers-union-of-united-states-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

And court\n\norders do not bend simply because the enjoined party, by virtue of the order, becomes\n\nliable to a third party for damages. See W.R. Grace & Co., 461 U.S. at 769, 103 S. Ct.\n\nat 2185. Avoiding contempt and respecting the court that entered the consent decree\n\nsuffice to make obedience a compelling interest.7\n\n       But there is a second reason in this case to deem compliance to be a compelling\n\ninterest.    This consent decree rests on a foundation — redressing of past\n\ndiscriminatory wrongs — that the Supreme Court has explicitly recognized as a\n\n\n       7\n                The plaintiffs contend that, even if compliance with the decree were a compelling\ninterest in some cases, it should not justify discrimination against them because they were not parties\nto the litigation that generated the decree. We can’t see the logic here; whether or not these\nplaintiffs are bound by the decree, the School Board obviously is, and the question is whether the\nSchool Board has a compelling interest.\n\n                                                  15\n\fcompelling interest by itself when two elements are present.8 See Shaw v.

The first element is that the past discrimination be\n\n“identified.” Id. The other element is that the government entity have a “strong basis\n\nin evidence” to conclude that remedial action was necessary. Id. (quoting Wygant v.\n\nJackson Bd. of Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111669\"><a href=\"/opinion/111669/wygant-v-jackson-bd-of-ed/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">267</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 277, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111669\"><a href=\"/opinion/111669/wygant-v-jackson-bd-of-ed/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The\n\npast discrimination is identified; it was the confinement of blacks to certain schools\n\nin the system. See Allen v. Board of Pub. Instruction, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">312</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1127</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1131 (S.D.\n\nFla. 1970) (finding as fact that 17 of Broward County schools were all black, while\n\nanother five were more than 99% black). The County also had “sufficient evidence\n\nto justify the conclusion that there ha[d] been prior discrimination.” Wygant, 476 U.S.\n\nat 277, 106 S. Ct. at 1848-49 (plurality opinion). There were indeed findings of fact\n\nfrom litigation of the early ’70s that Broward County schools were segregated. While\n\nthe district court believed Broward County to be fully desegregated by 1979, (see\n\nOrder Granting Partial Summ. J. at 4-8, Expandable folder 4, doc. 189, ex. 1), no one\n\nhas argued here that the 1983 race-discrimination action was unfounded. Complying\n\n\n\n\n       8\n                The School Board has not argued that remedying past discrimination would justify\nits policies even without a consent decree, so we do not address that issue.\n\n                                              16\n\fwith this consent decree in particular thus reflected another compelling interest\n\nbeyond respect for court orders.\n\n      The conclusion that compliance with the consent decree is a compelling\n\ninterest, however, does not end the summary judgment analysis. Consent decrees are\n\na species of court order, but they are also a kind of contract. See Local No. 93, Int’l\n\nAss’n of Firefighters v. City of Cleveland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111748\"><a href=\"/opinion/111748/firefighters-v-cleveland/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">501</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 519, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111748\"><a href=\"/opinion/111748/firefighters-v-cleveland/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

And as is the case in the law of contracts, when a consent decree is\n\nambiguous, we may resort to extrinsic evidence to determine the parties’ intent. See\n\nUnited States v. ITT Continental Baking Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1682020\"><a href=\"/opinion/1682020/united-states-v-itt-continental-baking-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">420</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">223</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 238, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1682020\"><a href=\"/opinion/1682020/united-states-v-itt-continental-baking-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">926</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 935\n\n(1975). The consent decree here, which we quoted above, implicitly contemplated\n\nintegration in the sense of ensuring a black and white mix in the County’s schools.\n\nBecause of this, it may have implied that the School Board should engage in the\n\nbusing policy of which Doe complains. But we cannot go farther than that on the\n\npresent record, and that is not far enough.\n\n      A contravening compelling interest justifies an explicitly racial policy only\n\nwhen the policy is narrowly tailored to serve that interest. See Adarand v. Peña, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117947\"><a href=\"/opinion/117947/adarand-constructors-inc-v-pena/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 227, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117947\"><a href=\"/opinion/117947/adarand-constructors-inc-v-pena/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2097</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2113 (1995).        When the compelling interest is\n\ncompliance with a court order, that means that the governmental entity must face a\n\nlikelihood of contempt under the order if it abandons the racial policy. The reason is\n\n\n                                          17\n\fobvious: any policy that exceeds the bare requirements of the order no longer closely\n\nfits the compelling interest because abandoning the policy is consistent with\n\nrespecting the court, avoiding contempt liability, and righting the wrongs underlying\n\nthe decree. In this case, not knowing whether the parties intended the consent decree\n\nto compel busing like that imposed on Doe makes it unknowable whether the court\n\nwould likely have held the School Board in contempt for refusing to bus Doe. The\n\nSchool Board has thus not carried its burden on this summary judgment motion of\n\neliminating a genuine issue of fact as to whether it had a compelling interest for Doe’s\n\nbusing during the 1995-96 school year.\n\n                    ii. Magnet school racial quotas.\n\n      Plaintiff Shaq attributes her temporary exclusion from a magnet program to a\n\nracial quota system that was in effect in the fall of 1994. That system, which\n\napparently resided in School Board policy 5004, is not in the record, as the district\n\ncourt pointed out. From deposition testimony and the amended 5004 that was\n\nproposed in 1996, however, a jury could find that whites were given preference for\n\nmagnet programs located in majority-black schools, until a certain desired percentage\n\nof white pupils was achieved. Shaq has thus presented enough evidence for present\n\npurposes to permit the conclusion that this policy was racial and therefore\n\nunconstitutional, unless it was narrowly tailored to serve a compelling interest.\n\n\n                                          18\n\f      Here again, as in the case of Doe’s busing, the School Board argues that the\n\n1987 consent decree provides a compelling interest. Again, the School Board’s\n\nproffered evidence leaves doubt as to how the consent decree compelled the racial\n\nquotas for magnet programs. There is more of a hint here of the link between the\n\ndecree and the policy; the decree explicitly mentions magnet programs, albeit in the\n\nsame obscure grammar:\n\n      6. THE SCHOOL BOARD OF BROWARD COUNTY, FLORIDA\n      shall implement the following:\n\n      ...\n\n             B. That Magnet Programs be primarily restricted to traditionally\n      black schools, and that the Plaintiff be provided with a list of all Magnet\n      Programs, real or imagined, their locations, and the current populations\n      of students participating in said programs.\n\n(Expandable Folder 6, doc. 206, tab 24, at 2.) Magnet programs also appeared in the\n\nsection of the decree addressing integration, which was quoted above, as a method of\n\nintegration. We could infer that some sort of racial preference would be necessary to\n\nachieve the desired desegregation. But what is missing is any evidence that quotas\n\n(whose details, as we said earlier, are unclear from this record) — not to mention the\n\nactual quota figures that were chosen — were necessary to comply with the consent\n\ndecree. We thus reach the same conclusion on this claim as we did on the Doe’s\n\nbusing claim: that the School Board has failed to carry its burden on summary\n\n\n                                          19\n\fjudgment to eliminate any genuine issue of fact concerning its defense of a compelling\n\ninterest.\n\n\n\n\n                                         20\n\f       c. Disparate treatment claims.\n\n       The remaining claims concern alleged racial distinctions that are not explicit.9\n\nAs we explained above, “official action will not be held unconstitutional solely\n\nbecause it results in racially disproportionate impact. . . .

If the plaintiffs have done so,\n\nthey have certainly not made it known — their brief to this court takes the district\n\ncourt to task for failing to “examine circumstantial evidence including the historic\n\nbackground of the decision making body, and legislative or administrative history of\n\nthe decisions,” but the plaintiffs have not provided us with a single record cite to any\n\n       9\n                By cunningly culling a quotation from a School Board rule, Doe tries to represent her\nclaim concerning tracking in a dropout prevention program as one arising from a facially racial\npolicy. The policy indeed limits how long pupils of a certain race may be kept apart from pupils of\nanother race, as Doe points out. But immediately above this provision, in all capital letters, the\npolicy (number 5150) behind the rule provides that “STUDENTS SHALL NOT BE ASSIGNED TO\nABILITY GROUPS, TRACKS, SPECIAL EDUCATION CLASSES, CLASSES FOR THE\nMENTALLY RETAINED, OR OTHER CURRICULAR OR EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES\nON THE BASIS OF RACE . . . .” (Expandable folder 6, doc. 206, tab 8.) This policy is thus not\nonly not explicitly racial, it is explicitly nonracial. Like the other claims discussed in this section,\ntherefore, this claim survives summary judgment only if the plaintiffs have produced sufficient\nevidence that this nonracial policy rests on a discriminatory purpose.\n\n                                                  21\n\fsuch history, or to any other evidence of discriminatory intent. In the interest of\n\njustice, we have nonetheless examined the record for such evidence. The record in\n\nfact does not support any assertion of discriminatory intent.\n\n      We can start with the background and historical facts that courts properly look\n\nto for evidence of intent. See Rogers v. Lodge, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110790\"><a href=\"/opinion/110790/rogers-v-lodge/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">613</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 623-27, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110790\"><a href=\"/opinion/110790/rogers-v-lodge/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The parties agree that the Broward County schools have been unitary\n\nsince 1979, and that unitariness came rapidly with good-faith compliance with court-\n\nordered desegregation. In 1987, following a lawsuit by some black parents, the\n\nSchool Board agreed to desegregation measures that, according to the plaintiffs here,\n\nwere not constitutionally necessary. When other black parents complained about the\n\ndesegregation measures — such as the busing at issue here — the Board established\n\na desegregation task force to make recommendations. The task force recommended\n\neliminating the busing, which the Board did. Furthermore, when parents complained\n\nthat suspension rates were higher for black pupils than white, the Board directed that\n\nschool improvement teams examine suspension practices. Finally, the Board’s\n\nmission statement is to provide the County’s “multi-cultural, diverse population” with\n\n“equal educational opportunity.” (Expandable folder 1, doc. 91, at 31.) This evidence\n\ndoes not support an inference of discriminatory intent. (Indeed, if anything this\n\nevidence depicts a well-meaning Board tiptoeing through a racial minefield.)\n\n\n                                         22\n\f       The plaintiffs’ other evidence is no better. The plaintiffs claim that for racial\n\nreasons western Broward schools get more money than eastern Broward schools, and\n\nthus have better facilities. But in none of the plaintiffs’ depositions of School Board\n\nmembers or school staff did the plaintiffs pursue the questions of how the Board\n\ndistributes money among schools in the County, how funding requests are made, how\n\nthe Board weighs requests, or how needs and priorities may differ from school to\n\nschool. In short, they did not elucidate the process in a level of detail that might\n\nexpose discriminatory intent.10 Instead, the plaintiffs point only to the disparities\n\nbetween schools that are the basis of their claims. This is just not enough evidence\n\nof intent when there are so many imaginable reasons for differences, both global —\n\neastern Broward County neighborhoods are older, and the schools there are older as\n\nwell — and specific to each spending decision, such as when the Board decides for\n\nlegitimate reasons that School X needs a new roof more than School Y needs a new\n\ngym floor. And as for Doe’s claim of racial tracking, the plaintiffs apparently did not\n\ndepose or seek affidavits from the officials who tracked Doe into an anti-dropout\n\n\n\n\n       10\n               What scanty testimony there is about certain spending items, such as new school\nconstruction, is that pupil health and safety, among other concerns peculiar to certain schools,\nmotivated decisions. (See Robert Parks Dep. at 51-54.)\n\n                                              23\n\fprogram. Thus, apart from Doe’s say-so11 we have no idea whether her placement\n\nthere was for racial or other reasons.\n\n       Because there is not enough evidence in the record for a jury to find that the\n\nSchool Board’s funding and resource decisions carry a racial taint, or that the School\n\nBoard or superintendent tracked Doe for racial reasons, the district court properly\n\ngranted summary judgment on those claims.\n\n                                      III. Conclusion\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we dismiss the interlocutory appeal of CCC and\n\naffirm the district court’s summary judgment against Shaq and Doe on their claims for\n\ninjunctive relief. We reverse, however, the summary judgment entered on Doe’s\n\nclaim for damages for being bused during the 1995-96 school year and Shaq’s claim\n\nfor damages for being denied entry into a magnet program for one month, and we\n\nremand for further proceedings on these two damages claims. The district court’s\n\njudgment is in all other respects affirmed.\n\n       NO. 97-5078        AFFIRMED IN PART;               DISMISSED FOR WANT OF\n\nAPPELLATE JURISDICTION IN PART.\n\n\n\n\n       11\n              Even on summary judgment, a court is not obliged to take as true testimony that is\nnot based on personal knowledge. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e).\n\n                                              24\n\f    NO. 98-4199 AFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED AND REMANDED IN\n\nPART.\n\n\n\n\n                            25\n\fBARKETT, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part:\n\n      I concur in the court’s resolution of Shaq and Doe’s appeal. I respectfully\n\ndissent, however, from the majority’s conclusion that the order from which an\n\ninterlocutory appeal is sought by Citizens Concerned About Our Children (“CCC”)\n\nis one which cannot be appealed under Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104695\"><a href=\"/opinion/104695/cohen-v-beneficial-industrial-loan-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">337</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">541</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1949). I believe our precedent requires the opposite result. Interlocutory\n\nappeals are permitted under the collateral order doctrine if the order appealed from:\n\n(1) conclusively determines the disputed question; (2) resolves an important issue\n\ncompletely separate from the merits of the action; and (3) is effectively unreviewable\n\non appeal from a final judgment. See Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. v. Mayacamas\n\nCorp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112025\"><a href=\"/opinion/112025/gulfstream-aerospace-corp-v-mayacamas-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">271</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 276 (1988) (reiterating the three-prong test of Cohen).\n\n      The majority finds that the district court’s order fails the third prong of the\n\nCohen test, on the basis of Summit Med. Assocs., P.C. v. Pryor, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">180</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1326</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (11th\n\nCir. 1999). I believe Pryor is not applicable and that this case is controlled by\n\nTransamerica Commercial Finance Corp. v. Banton, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">970</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">810</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (11th Cir. 1992).\n\n      In Pryor, the Court found that a defendant may not immediately appeal a denial\n\nof a motion to dismiss for lack of standing. See Pryor, 180 F.3d at 1334. The\n\nmajority suggests that a denial of a motion to dismiss for want of standing is no\n\ndifferent from a judgment granting a motion to dismiss for want of standing. See Maj.\n\n\n                                         26\n\fOp. at 8. I find these actions to be significantly different in their consequences. When\n\na district court denies a motion to dismiss, all parties remain in the lawsuit and\n\nparticipate therein. When a district court grants the motion, the dismissed party can\n\nno longer participate and loses any opportunity to clarify or to affect in any way the\n\nongoing case.\n\n       Moreover, this court’s precedent has explicitly recognized that excluding a\n\nparty from the remainder of an ongoing case satisfies the third prong of Cohen. In\n\nTransamerica Commercial Finance Corp, 970 F.2d at 814, this Court held that an\n\norder dismissing two of the eleven defendants in the case by granting motions for\n\nsummary and default judgments as a form of sanction was immediately appealable\n\nunder the collateral order doctrine. The court concluded that such an order, albeit not\n\na final judgment under section 1291, was appealable as an interlocutory order because\n\notherwise it would be effectively unreviewable.1 As the court noted, “having been\n\nsevered from the underlying case” the two defendants could lose their opportunity to\n\n\n\n\n       1\n                This does not mean that parties dismissed from an action may always have an\ninterlocutory appeal from a nonfinal order. The order must still fulfill the first two prongs of Cohen,\nthat is it must conclusively determine the disputed question and resolve an important issue\ncompletely separate from the merits of the action. In Transamerica, the Court concluded that the\ndistrict court’s order undoubtedly fulfilled the first two Cohen prongs. Similarly, the question\nwhether a party has standing easily fulfills the first two prongs of Cohen because a standing\ndetermination is both separate from the merits of a claim and conclusively resolves an important\ndisputed question. See Pryor, 180 F.3d at 1334.\n\n                                                  27\n\fappeal for “the remaining defendants may settle or may decide not to appeal.” Id. at\n\n815.\n\n       In the case at hand, CCC may be subjected to irreparable harm in the absence\n\nof an immediate appeal. The district court, in the same order dismissing CCC for lack\n\nof standing also denied Shaq and Doe the right to proceed with their claims for\n\ninjunctive relief. Furthermore, the district court’s September 5, 1997 order found that\n\nShaq and Doe did not have standing to challenge the alleged system-wide racial\n\ndisparities and inequities in the Broward County School system. The district court\n\nlimited Shaq and Doe’s claims to those practices directed towards them only at the\n\nschools which they attended.        These rulings relating to Shaq and Doe were\n\nincorporated in the subsequent final judgment but CCC was not included therein.\n\nTherefore, if the issue of CCC’s standing is not reviewed in this appeal, the parties\n\nwill have no avenue through which to challenge the alleged system-wide\n\nunconstitutional practices as CCC tried to do in its complaint.\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, I would find that this Court has appellate jurisdiction\n\nover CCC’s interlocutory appeal and should resolve the issues pertaining thereto.\n\n\n\n\n                                           28\n\f</pre>",
