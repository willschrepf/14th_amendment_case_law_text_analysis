Plaintiff’s\n\ncomplaint challenges the responses to written requests that he made to defendants, the Criminal\n\nDivision (“CRM”) of the United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”), the United States\n\nMarshals Service (“USMS”), the Executive Office for United States Attorneys (“EOUSA”), the\n\nFederal Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”), the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives\n\n(“ATF”), and the Department of Treasury (“Treasury”). 1 In each of his requests, plaintiff sought\n\nall records related to himself. All of the defendant agencies except for Treasury responded to\n\nplaintiff’s requests by conducting searches. Many have disclosed some responsive records, and\n\nall have provided reasons for withholding at least some information.\n\n       Defendants have filed two partial motions for summary judgment and dismissal, which\n\ntogether seek to dispose of this action in its entirety. Fed. Defs.’ Partial Mot. for Summ. J. and\n\n\n\n1       Plaintiff also named the Department of Justice and the Parker County Sheriff Department\nas defendants to this action. The Court dismissed the Parker County Sheriff Department from\nthe action by Order of December 12, 2012 [Dkt. # 18].\n\fDismissal [Dkt. # 15] (“Defs.’ 1st Mot.”); Fed. Defs.’ Supp. Mot. for Summ. J. and Dismissal\n\n[Dkt. # 22] (“Defs.’ 2d Mot.”). Plaintiff opposes both motions, challenging the adequacy of the\n\nagencies’ searches and their withholdings. Resp. and Objection to Fed. Defs.’ Partial Mot. for\n\nSumm. J. and Dismissal [Dkt. # 16] (“Pl.’s 1st Resp.”); Pl.’s Verified Mem. Resp. to Fed. Defs.’\n\nSupplemental Mot. for Summ. J. and Dismissal [Dkt. # 25] (“Pl.’s 2d Resp.”). Plaintiff also\n\nchallenges Treasury’s failure to undertake a search. The Court finds that plaintiff has failed to\n\nexhaust his administrative remedies as to some of his claims. As to the others, the Court finds,\n\nbased on affidavits and Vaughn indices submitted by the government, that the agencies\n\nconducted adequate searches for responsive documents, but they have not provided adequate\n\nexplanations for all of their withholdings. Accordingly, the Court will grant in part and deny in\n\npart defendants’ motions for summary judgment. The Court will direct EOUSA to disclose parts\n\nof four documents that it has withheld in full and will remand to BOP to review the documents it\n\nreceived from EOUSA after the commencement of this action.\n\n                                       BACKGROUND\n\n       Plaintiff is currently incarcerated at the Seagoville Federal Correctional Institution in\n\nSeagoville, Texas. Pl.’s 1st Compl. [Dkt. # 1] (“Compl.”) ¶ 1. In July 2010, he pled guilty to\n\none count of possession of an unregistered destructive device, in violation of 26 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 5841, 5861(d), and 5871.    Minute Order, United States v. David Barouch, No. 4:10-CR-\n\n00099-A(01) (N.D. Tex. July 9, 2010) [Dkt. # 27]. In November 2010, he was sentenced in the\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of Northern Texas to 120 months in prison.\n\nJudgment, United State, No. 4:10-CR-00099-A(01) (N.D. Tex. Nov. 1, 2010) [Dkt. # 41].\n\n\n\n\n                                               2\n\f        By letters dated April and May 2011, 2 plaintiff submitted written requests to CRM,\n\nUSMS, EOUSA, BOP, and ATF. Ex. 1 to Decl. of John E. Cunningham III (“Cunningham\n\nDecl.”) [Dkt. # 15-3] at 1 (CRM); Attach. 2 to Decl. of Violet Mack (“Mack Decl.”) [Dkt. # 22-\n\n1] at 1 (BOP); Ex. A to Decl. of David Luczynski (“Luczynski Decl.”) [Dkt. # 22-2] at 1\n\n(EOUSA); Ex. A to Decl. of Stephanie M. Boucher (“1st Boucher Decl.”) [Dkt. # 22-3] at 1\n\n(ATF); Ex. A to Decl. of William E. Bordley (“Bordley Decl.”) [Dkt. # 22-4] at 1 (USMS). All\n\nof the documents sought “full disclosure and release of all files, records, data and/or information\n\nmaintained by” each agency under plaintiff’s name. Id. His request included his birthdate, place\n\nof birth, social security number, case numbers for his conviction and appeal, and the district in\n\nwhich he was convicted. Id. In addition, plaintiff maintains that he submitted an identical FOIA\n\nrequest to Treasury. 3 Compl. ¶ 12; see also Aff. of Jack Barouch (“Barouch Aff.”), Ex. A to\n\n[Dkt. # 16], ¶ 1.\n\n   I.      Request to Treasury\n\n        Plaintiff claims that Treasury possesses but has withheld documents responsive to his\n\nrequest. Compl. ¶¶ 5, 22, 25. Defendants claim that Treasury never received a request from\n\nplaintiff. Mem. in Support of Fed. Defs.’ Mot. for Partial Summ. J. and Dismissal [Dkt. # 15-2]\n\n(“Defs.’ 1st Mem.”) at 4. In support of this contention, Treasury has submitted a declaration\n\nfrom Hugh Gilmore, a supervisory program analyst in Disclosure Services, part of Treasury’s\n\nDepartmental Offices, which oversees FOIA compliance for the bureaus of Treasury except for\n\n\n\n2       Defendants assert that plaintiff’s FOIA request directed to ATF was not received until\nAugust 2011. Mem. in Support of Fed. Defs.’ Supplemental Mot. for Summ. J. and Dismissal\n[Dkt. # 22] (“Defs.’ 2d Mem.”) at 4.\n\n3      All of plaintiff’s letters of request were identical, except that the letters to BOP and ATF\nalso contained attachments, which identified with more specificity the documents that were the\nsubjects of plaintiff’s request. Ex. 2 to Mack Decl.; Ex. A to 1st Boucher Decl.\n                                                3\n\fthe Internal Revenue Service. Declaration of Hugh Gilmore [Dkt. # 15-4] (“Gilmore Decl.”) ¶ 2.\n\nHe states that Treasury has conducted a search of its FOIA tracking system to find any requests\n\nsubmitted under plaintiff’s name, but none were located. Id. ¶ 5.\n\n         The declaration also notes that although plaintiff alleges that ATF is an agency within\n\nTreasury, ATF became part of DOJ in 2003. Id. ¶¶ 6–7; see also Homeland Security Act of\n\n2002, Pub. L. No. 107-206, 116 Stat. 2135; Compl. ¶¶ 5, 6, 22, 25 (referring to ATF as a division\n\nof Treasury).\n\n   II.      Request to CRM\n\n         CRM acknowledged receipt of plaintiff’s request by letter dated May 6, 2011.\n\nCunningham Decl. ¶ 4; see also Ex. 1 to Cunningham Decl. On May 23, 2011, it responded to\n\nthe request. Cunningham Decl. ¶ 7; Ex. 2 to Cunningham Decl. The response directed plaintiff\n\nto send another letter to CRM indicating which section of the agency he wanted to be searched,\n\nand specifying the location and dates of his conviction, arrests, and the federal offenses, and any\n\nother applicable timeframes involved. Ex. 2 to Cunningham Decl. By letter dated June 6, 2011,\n\nplaintiff asked that CRM search the “FOIA/PA Unit,” and he responded to CRM’s other\n\nrequests. Cunningham Decl. ¶ 8; Ex. 3 to Cunningham Decl. On July 6, 2011, CRM sent\n\nplaintiff a letter informing him that no responsive documents had been found. Cunningham\n\nDecl. ¶ 11; Ex. 5 to Cunningham Decl. The letter also explained plaintiff’s right to appeal\n\nCRM’s determination to DOJ’s Office of Information Policy (“OIP”). Ex. 5 to Cunningham\n\nDecl. On July 12, 2011, plaintiff sent a letter to OIP appealing CRM’s decision. Cunningham\n\nDecl. ¶ 13; Ex. 6 to Cunningham Decl. OIP confirmed receipt of plaintiff’s appeal by letter\n\ndated July 27, 2011, and informed plaintiff by letter dated October 11, 2011 that it had\n\n\n\n\n                                                4\n\fdetermined that CRM’s search was adequate.          Cunningham Decl. ¶¶ 14–15; Exs. 7–8 to\n\nCunningham Decl.\n\n          On April 3, 2012, after plaintiff had filed the instant lawsuit, CRM received one\n\npotentially responsive document from EOUSA because EOUSA had determined that the\n\ndocument originated with CRM. Cunningham Decl. ¶ 17; Exs. 9–10 to Cunningham Decl. The\n\ndocument was a July 15, 2005, memorandum (“Richter Memorandum”) from Acting Assistant\n\nAttorney General of CRM, John C. Richter, concerning “[c]harging under 18 U.S.C. 924(c)\n\nwhere the underlying crime of violence is the possession of the same weapon.” Cunningham\n\nDecl. ¶ 19 (internal quotation marks omitted); Ex. 11 to Cunningham Decl. On April 18, CRM\n\ninformed plaintiff by letter that it was withholding the document in part pursuant to 5 U.S.C.\n\n§ 552(b)(5), which permits agencies to withhold from production inter- or intra-agency\n\ndocuments that would not be available in litigation.       Cunningham Decl. ¶ 19; Ex. 11 to\n\nCunningham Decl. This letter also informed plaintiff that he could appeal the decision to OIP.\n\nEx. 11 to Cunningham Decl.\n\n   III.      Request to USMS\n\n          On May 17, 2011, USMS’s Office of General Counsel (“OGC”) received plaintiff’s\n\nrequest. Bordley Decl. ¶ 2; Ex. A to Bordley Decl. By letter dated May 20, OGC acknowledged\n\nreceipt of plaintiff’s letter and informed him that the office had begun its search. Bordley Decl.\n\n¶ 3; Ex. B to Bordley Decl. According to William E. Bordley, who is the Associate General\n\nCounsel and Freedom of Information/Privacy Act Officer for USMS, OGC searched the Prisoner\n\nProcessing and Population Management/Prisoner Tracking System (PPM/PTS), JUSTICE/USM-\n\n005 and the Warrant Information Network (WIN), JUSTICE/USM-007. Bordley Decl. ¶¶ 1, 5.\n\nThese resources comprise the electronic and paper records concerning USMS prisoners and\n\n\n\n                                                5\n\fothers investigated by USMS pursuant to an arrest warrant or other judicial process. Id. ¶ 5.\n\nFollowing a search of these records, OGC identified 28 pages of material indexed to plaintiff’s\n\nname, located in the Northern District of Texas – the relevant location identified by plaintiff in\n\nhis request. Id.; Ex. A to Bordley Decl.\n\n         By letter dated June 21, 2011, OGC informed plaintiff that it was releasing twenty-eight\n\npages of documents to him. Bordley Decl. ¶ 6; Ex. C to Bordley Decl. Of these pages, fifteen\n\nwere released in their entirety, and thirteen were released with redactions pursuant to 5 U.S.C.\n\n§ 552(b)(7)(C) (“Exemption (b)(7)(C)”) and 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(E) (“Exemption (b)(7)(E)”).\n\nBordley Decl. ¶ 6; see also 5 U.S.C. §§ 552(b)(7)(C), (b)(7)(E) (2012). The letter also informed\n\nplaintiff that he could appeal USMS’s determination to OIP. Ex. C to Bordley Decl. Plaintiff\n\nfiled an appeal by letter dated July 1, 2011. Bordley Decl. ¶ 7; Ex. D to Bordley Decl. By letter\n\ndated September 21, 2011, OIP informed plaintiff that it was affirming the decision. Ex. E to\n\nBordley Decl.\n\n         USMS’s Vaughn index describes the information withheld and lists the basis for the\n\nwithholdings. Bordley Decl. ¶¶ 11–12. USMS relied on Exemption (b)(7)(C) to withhold\n\ninformation from twelve pages of the responsive documents. Id. ¶ 12. In each instance, it was\n\ninvoked to excise the name, address, prison identification number, and/or registration number of\n\nthird parties, government employees, law enforcement officers, USMS employees and/or other\n\nprisoners. Id. USMS also withheld the secure website address from one page also pursuant to\n\nExemption (b)(7)(E). Id.\n\n   IV.      Request to ATF\n\n         According to a declaration by the Chief of ATF’s Disclosure Division, Stephanie M.\n\nBoucher, the agency received a letter from plaintiff on August 1, 2011, that was dated July 20,\n\n\n\n                                                6\n\f2011. 1st Boucher Decl. ¶¶ 1, 3. The letter indicated that plaintiff had filed a formal FOIA\n\nrequest more than thirty days prior but had not received a response. Ex. A to 1st Boucher Decl.\n\nEnclosed along with the letter was a copy of a request written by plaintiff under FOIA and the\n\nPrivacy Act, dated April 26, 2011, as well as two attachments to the request. Id. The first\n\nattachment is a document stating that the request includes investigative records in the possession\n\nof the Colleybille [sic], Keller, and Fort Worth Police Departments, which – according to the\n\nattachment – operated as sub-agents for ATF in plaintiff’s criminal case. Id. The second\n\nattachment is a document stating that the request includes (1) a microcassette recording of an\n\nOctober 2010 interview of plaintiff by ATF Agent Riddle with plaintiff’s then-counsel Mic\n\nMickelson, (2) a tape recording of a November 2010 interview with an inmate that was\n\nconducted by ATF Agent Riddle and an unnamed Texas Ranger, and was attended by plaintiff,\n\nand (3) a videotape recording of plaintiff purchasing two salad bowls from Bed, Bath, and\n\nBeyond in roughly April or May of 2010. Id. By letter dated August 2, 2011, ATF responded to\n\nplaintiff to inform him that ATF had received and would process his FOIA request dated August\n\n1, but that it had not previously received a request from him. 1st Boucher Decl. ¶ 4; Ex. B to 1st\n\nBoucher Decl.\n\n       According to the Boucher declaration, the Disclosure Division concluded that release of\n\nthe records sought could reasonably be expected to interfere with ongoing law enforcement\n\nproceedings. 1st Boucher Decl. ¶ 5. Accordingly, by letter of August 3, 2011, ATF denied\n\nplaintiff’s request pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(A) (“Exemption (b)(7)(A)”). 1st Boucher\n\nDecl. ¶ 5; Ex. C to 1st Boucher Decl.; see also 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(A) (2012). The denial left\n\nopen the option for ATF to invoke additional exemptions to support withholdings in the future.\n\n1st Boucher Decl. ¶ 5; Ex. C to 1st Boucher Decl. The letter also informed plaintiff that he could\n\n\n\n                                                7\n\fappeal the denial to OIP. 1st Boucher Decl. ¶ 5; Ex. C to 1st Boucher Decl. After August 3,\n\n2011, ATF notified plaintiff of that because his appeal from his criminal case had concluded, the\n\nagency intended to release documents that had been previously withheld. Decl. of Stephanie M.\n\nBoucher [Dkt. # 26-1] ¶ 3.\n\n         According to Boucher, her staff contacted OIP after plaintiff filed the complaint in the\n\ninstant case to determine whether plaintiff had filed an administrative appeal of ATF’s actions.\n\n1st Boucher Decl. ¶ 8. OIP informed Boucher’s staff that it had no records of an appeal from\n\nplaintiff. Id.\n\n         In addition, on April 10, 2012, ATF received potentially responsive documents from\n\nEOUSA because EOUSA had determined that the documents originated with ATF. 1st Boucher\n\nDecl. ¶ 6; Ex. D to 1st Boucher Decl. By letter dated April 12, 2012, ATF notified plaintiff that\n\nit was partially withholding the documents under Exemption (b)(7)(C). 1st Boucher Decl. ¶ 7;\n\nEx. E to 1st Boucher Decl.\n\n    V.      Request to BOP\n\n         By letter dated April 26, 2011, plaintiff submitted a Privacy Act/FOIA request to BOP.\n\nMack Decl. ¶ 4; Attach. 2 to Mack Decl. The letter was directed to BOP’s Office of General\n\nCounsel FOIA/PA Section and was received by that office on May 17, 2011. Mack Decl. ¶ 4;\n\nAttach. 2 to Mack Decl. According to BOP Paralegal Specialist Violate Mack, the FOIA/PA\n\nSection staff determined that the appropriate location for plaintiff’s search request was BOP’s\n\nSouth Central Region. Mack Decl. ¶ 5. Accordingly, on May 27, 2011, FOIA/PA Section staff\n\nuploaded the request letter into Metastorm BPM – the Bureau’s FOIA database – for processing\n\nby the SCRO Regional Counsel’s Office. Id. According to Mack, the now-retired SCRO\n\nParalegal Specialist, Larry Collins, determined that the form of plaintiff’s request was typical of\n\n\n\n                                                8\n\fforms used by inmates at particular institutions, except that plaintiff had also appended an\n\nadditional page specifying in more detail the materials he sought. Id. ¶ 6; Attach. 2 to Mack\n\nDecl. Those specific materials were: “[t]elephonic recordings or transcript[s] of telephonic\n\nrecordings” from (a) the Parker County detention center from May 1, 2010 through July 15,\n\n2010; (b) FDC Fort Worth from July 1, 2010 through November 1, 2010; and (c) FCI Seagoville\n\nfrom October 28, 2010 to present, as well as any Parker County Detention Center or FDC Fort\n\nWorth inmate files concerning plaintiff not currently in the central file at Seagoville. Attach. 2 to\n\nMack Decl.\n\n        On August 14, 2011, BOP’s Office of General Counsel, Freedom of Information\n\ndivision received another letter from plaintiff. Mack Decl. ¶ 14. This letter contained (1) a letter\n\nfrom plaintiff to the BOP FOIA section, dated July 20, 2011, requesting an update on the status\n\nof his April 26, 2011 FOIA request to the BOP Office of Central Counsel FOIA/PA Section,\n\nwith a copy of the April 26 request attached, (2) a letter dated July 27, 2011, from BOP Legal\n\nInstruments Examiner Paula Champion, indicating that she had received a letter from plaintiff\n\nrequesting records maintained by BOP at the Federal Correctional Institution, Fort Worth, Texas,\n\nand informing plaintiff that if his request was intended to be filed under the Privacy and Freedom\n\nof Information Acts, it should be sent to BOP’s Office of General Counsel, Freedom of\n\nInformation Division, and (3) a FOIA request by plaintiff, identical to the April 26, 2011 request,\n\nbut addressed to the Office of General Counsel, Freedom of Information, Bureau of Prisons\n\nCentral Office and dated July 30, 2011. Mack Decl. ¶ 14; Attach. 5 to Mack Decl.\n\n        According to Mack, Collins e-mailed FCI Fort Worth’s staff on June 7, 2011, requesting\n\ndocuments responsive to plaintiff’s request. Mack Decl. ¶ 7. In his email, Collins noted that\n\nplaintiff had been a “holdover” inmate – that is, a BOP inmate not yet transferred to his\n\n\n\n                                                 9\n\fdesignated institution – at Fort Worth, and that he was specifically requesting all recorded\n\ntelephone calls from Fort Worth during the specified timeframe. Id. & n.2. Collins also sent an\n\ne-mail on June 7, 2011 to FCI Seagoville’s Legal Liaison requesting responsive records,\n\nspecifically including recorded telephone calls for the requested period and any available\n\ntelephone transactional data concerning plaintiff. Id. ¶ 8. 4\n\n          The Mack declarations states that because the content of plaintiff’s FOIA letter was the\n\nsame or similar to letters that BOP receives frequently from other inmates, BOP interpreted the\n\nletter as a “form letter” rather than a request for all documents maintained in the central and\n\nmedical files of the requesting inmate. Id. ¶ 11 & n.5. To determine the scope of plaintiff’s\n\nrequest, BOP looked to the more specific requests delineated in the attachments to plaintiff’s\n\nletter.   Id. ¶ 11.   Since the requests described in the attachments were limited to records\n\nmaintained by the Parker County Detention Center and FCI Fort Worth that would not be found\n\nin plaintiff’s central file maintained at FCI Seagoville, BOP determined that the scope of\n\nplaintiff’s request did not extend to all documents in his central file. Id. And since the requests\n\nwere unrelated to any records that would be maintained in plaintiff’s medical file, BOP\n\ndetermined that the scope did not extend to all documents in his medical file. Id.\n\n          According to Mack, on June 8, 2011, FCI Fort Worth staff sent Collins the transactional\n\ndata from plaintiff’s use of the Inmate Telephone System (“ITS”) but informed him that it had\n\nfound no recorded telephone conversations and no detainee files. Mack Decl. ¶ 12. On June 16,\n\n2011, FCI Seagoville staff informed Collins that it would forward a CD containing a copy of the\n\ntransactional data for plaintiff’s ITS usage. Id. ¶ 13. The CD also contained recorded telephone\n\nconversations. Id.\n\n\n4        No similar request was made to the Parker County Detention Center as it is not a BOP\nfacility. Mack Decl. ¶ 9.\n                                                 10\n\f        On August 31, 2011, the SCRO Regional Counsel responded to plaintiff’s FOIA\n\nrequest. Mack Decl. ¶ 15; Attach 6 to Mack Decl. The letter indicated the following:\n\n           Parker County Detention Center records are not subject to FOIA requests and not\n           within BOP’s jurisdiction.\n\n           BOP located no detainee file concerning plaintiff at FCI Fort Worth.\n\n           In consideration of the specific requests noted in the attachments to plaintiff’s\n           request letter, BOP declined to interpret the scope of the request as including all\n           documents in the central and medical files; however, plaintiff was invited to provide\n           BOP with a clearer description of the records sought.\n\n           BOP’s search turned up 113 recorded telephone conversations from FCI Seagoville\n           between the dates of December 18, 2010 and June 6, 2011.\n\n           No recorded telephone conversations were found at FCI Fort Worth.\n\n           Recorded telephone conversations are maintained on the TRUFONE system for 180\n           days, after which they are automatically deleted.\n\n           Recorded telephone conversations cannot be released without consent from all\n           recorded parties and are, therefore, exempt from disclosure under 5 U.S.C.\n           §§ 552(b)(6) and (b)(7)(C).\n\n           Sixteen pages of telephone transactional data were released to plaintiff.\n\n           Plaintiff could appeal BOP’s response to his request by filing a written appeal with\n           OIP.\n\nMack Decl. ¶ 15; Attach. 6 to Mack Decl.\n\n       By letter dated September 29, 2011, plaintiff requested preservation of the telephone\n\nconversations identified in BOP’s response. Mack Decl. ¶ 16; Attach. 7 to Mack Decl. SCRO\n\nRegional Counsel confirmed by letter dated October 24, 2011, that the records would be\n\npreserved through December 2017 per the BOP Records and Information Disposition Schedule.\n\nMack Decl. ¶ 16; Attach. 8 to Mack Decl.\n\n       On March 13, 2012, after BOP received no correspondence indicating that plaintiff had\n\nelected to file an appeal, Collins sent an e-mail to an OIP representative, asking for a\n\n                                               11\n\fconfirmation that plaintiff had not yet appealed the decision. Mack Decl. ¶¶ 18–19. On March\n\n27, Collins received an email response indicating that OIP had no record of an appeal. Mack\n\nDecl. ¶ 20; Attach. 9 to Mack Decl.\n\n         At the time that plaintiff filed the instant lawsuit, BOP had informed plaintiff only that it\n\nwas withholding the records described in BOP’s August 31, 2011 letter. See Attach. 6 to Mack\n\nDecl. However, after the initiation of this action, EOUSA referred a number of additional pages\n\nto BOP to process. Luczynski Decl. ¶ 6.\n\n   VI.      Request to EOUSA\n\n         On May 17, 2011, EOUSA received a letter from plaintiff requesting, pursuant to the\n\nPrivacy Act and FOIA, copies of “all files, records, data, and/or information” maintained by\n\nEOUSA under the name David Barouch. 5 Luczynski Decl. ¶ 4; Ex. A to Luczynski Decl. On\n\nMay 31, 2011, EOUSA acknowledged receipt of plaintiff’s letter. Luczynski Decl. ¶ 5; Ex. B to\n\nLuczynski Decl. EOUSA’s letter informed plaintiff that, although the agency attempted to\n\nprocess most requests within twenty days, “Project Requests” – including requests about oneself\n\nin criminal case files – usually took about nine months. Ex. B to Luczynski Decl.\n\n         According to David Luczynski, an EOUSA attorney advisor who, among other things,\n\nreviews FOIA and Privacy Act requests submitted to EOUSA and prepares responses, EOUSA\n\nbegan its search in the Northern District of Texas, which was specified as the pertinent location\n\nin plaintiff’s initial inquiry. Luczynski Decl. ¶¶ 1, 8; Ex. A to Luczynski Decl. EOUSA’s search\n\ninvolved reviewing the records from plaintiff’s case, sending email requests for responsive\n\ndocuments to the Assistant United States Attorney in the Criminal Division, and searching the\n\n\n5       Although the affidavit submitted in support of EOUSA’s motion to dismiss repeatedly\nrefers to plaintiff’s letter as a “FOIA request,” the letter cites both FOIA and the Privacy Act as\nthe bases for plaintiff’s request. See Luczynski Decl. ¶¶ 3, 6, 9, 11; see also Ex. A to Luczynski\nDecl.\n                                                  12\n\fLIONS system – used by the United States Attorney Offices to monitor cases and retrieve files –\n\nusing plaintiff’s name as the search term. Luczynski Decl. ¶ 8\n\n       By letter dated March 26, 2012 – after the initiation of this case – EOUSA responded to\n\nplaintiff, indicating that it had identified relevant documents and was releasing 159 pages in full,\n\nreleasing 50 pages in part, and withholding 282 pages in full. Compl. at 1; Luczynski Decl. ¶ 6;\n\nEx. C to Luczynski Decl. The letter informed plaintiff that documents were withheld from\n\nproduction under the FOIA exemptions codified at 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(3) (“Exemption (b)(3)”), 5\n\nU.S.C. § 552(b)(5) (“Exemption (b)(5)”), 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(6) (“Exemption (b)(6)”), and\n\nExemption (b)(7)(C), and under the Privacy Act exemption codified at 5 U.S.C. § 552a(j)(2)\n\n(“Exemption (j)(2)”). Luczynski Decl. ¶ 6. Ex. C to Luczynski Decl.; see also Vaughn Index,\n\nAttach. to Luczynski Decl.       The letter also informed plaintiff that additional potentially\n\nresponsive documents were being referred to ATF, CRM, and BOP. Luczynski Decl. ¶ 6; Ex. C\n\nto Luczynski Decl. Finally, the letter stated that plaintiff could appeal the decision to OIP within\n\nsixty days. Luczynski Decl. ¶ 6; Ex. C to Luczynski Decl.\n\n   VII.    Procedural Background\n\n       Plaintiff, acting pro se, filed the complaint in this action on January 23, 2012, against\n\nDOJ, USMS, the DOJ Criminal Division, EOUSA, BOP, Treasury, ATF, and the Parker County\n\nSheriff Department. Compl. at 1. The complaint alleges that the named defendants have “failed,\n\nrefused, and neglected to comply with Plaintiff’s reasonable requests for records, documents,\n\naudio tapes and jail tape recordings, and discovery.” Compl. ¶ 15. Plaintiff seeks an order\n\ncompelling disclosure of his “entire record of investigation” for the years 2010 and 2011.\n\nCompl. ¶ 17.     On December 12, 2012, the Court dismissed the Parker County Sheriff\n\n\n\n\n                                                13\n\fDepartment, sua sponte, because the local entity is not subject to the provisions of FOIA. [Dkt.\n\n# 18].\n\n         Defendants filed two partial motions for summary judgment or dismissal that together\n\nwould dispose of the entire case. Defs.’ 1st Mot.; Defs.’ 2d Mot. The first motion, filed on\n\nNovember 9, 2012, seeks summary judgment or dismissal with respect to plaintiff’s claims\n\nagainst Treasury and CRM. Defs.’ 1st Mot. Plaintiff filed an opposition on November 27, 2012.\n\nPl.’s 1st Resp. Defendants filed a reply in support of their motion on December 21, 2012. Defs.’\n\nReply to Pl.’s Resp. and Objection to Federal Defs.’ Mot. for Partial Summ. J. and Dismissal\n\n[Dkt. # 20]. On January 17, 2013, plaintiff filed a surreply to defendants’ response. Pl.’s Sur-\n\nResp. to Defs.’ Reply to Pl.’s Resp. and Objection to Federal Defs.’ Mot. for Partial Summ. J.\n\n[Dkt. # 21] (“Pl.’s Sur-Resp.”). The second motion, filed on February 7, 2013, seeks summary\n\njudgment or dismissal with respect to the claims against the remaining federal defendants: ATF,\n\nBOP, USMS, and EOUSA. Defs.’ 2d Mot. Plaintiff responded on March 11, 2013. Pl.’s 2d\n\nResp. Defendants filed a reply in support of their motion on March 22, 2013. Defs.’ Reply to\n\nPl.’s Verified Mem. Response to Fed. Defs.’ Supp. Mot. for Summ. J. and Dismissal [Dkt. # 26]\n\n(“Defs.’ Reply”).\n\n         On July 25, 2013, upon review of the parties’ submissions, the Court ordered defendants\n\nto deliver to chambers for in camera inspection four documents that had been withheld by\n\ndefendant EOUSA. Minute Order (July 25, 2013), citing Ray v. Turner, 587 F.2d 1187, 1195\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1978). EOUSA submitted the four documents to the Court in camera on August 2,\n\n2013.    The Court has reviewed these documents along with the parties’ memoranda and\n\npleadings.\n\n\n\n\n                                               14\n\f                                  STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n       Summary judgment is appropriate “if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute\n\nas to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n56(a). The party seeking summary judgment bears the “initial responsibility of informing the\n\ndistrict court of the basis for its motion, and identifying those portions of the pleadings,\n\ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if\n\nany, which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.” Celotex\n\nCorp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986) (internal quotation marks omitted). To defeat\n\nsummary judgment, the non-moving party must “designate specific facts showing that there is a\n\ngenuine issue for trial.” Id. at 324 (internal quotation marks omitted). The existence of a factual\n\ndispute is insufficient to preclude summary judgment. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S.\n\n242, 247-48 (1986). A dispute is “genuine” only if a reasonable fact-finder could find for the\n\nnon-moving party; a fact is only “material” if it is capable of affecting the outcome of the\n\nlitigation. Id. at 248; Laningham v. U.S. Navy, 813 F.2d 1236, 1241 (D.C. Cir. 1987). In\n\nassessing a party's motion, the court must “view the facts and draw reasonable inferences ‘in the\n\nlight most favorable to the party opposing the summary judgment motion.’” Scott v. Harris, 550\n\nU.S. 372, 378 (2007) (alterations omitted), quoting United States v. Diebold, Inc., 369 U.S. 654,\n\n655 (1962) (per curiam).\n\n       While the same legal framework applies in every case, where a plaintiff proceeds pro se,\n\n“the Court must take particular care to construe the plaintiff's filings liberally, for such\n\ncomplaints are held ‘to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.’”\n\nCheeks v. Fort Myer Constr. Co., 722 F. Supp. 2d 93, 107 (D.D.C. 2010), quoting Haines v.\n\nKerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520–21 (1972).\n\n\n\n                                                15\n\f                                          ANALYSIS\n\n       I.      The Court will grant summary judgment to defendants for all claims against\n               Treasury\n\n       Treasury moves for summary judgment on the grounds that there is no evidence that\n\nplaintiff submitted a FOIA request to the agency. 6 Defs.’ 1st Mem. at 2. Treasury’s declarant,\n\nGilmore, describes Treasury’s FOIA tracking system, Gilmore Decl. ¶ 4, and he states that upon\n\nconducting a search of that tracking system under plaintiff’s name, he was unable to find a\n\nrequest. Id. ¶ 5.\n\n       Plaintiff has failed to produce any evidence that he submitted a FOIA or Privacy Act\n\nrequest to Treasury, let alone provide a copy of the request itself to the Court. Moreover,\n\nplaintiff has continually wrongly characterized ATF as a bureau of Treasury, Compl. ¶¶ 5–6, 22,\n\n25, which suggests that he may have been under the impression that he was seeking records from\n\nTreasury when he submitted his request to ATF. Because there is no genuine dispute that no\n\ndocuments were produced to plaintiff by Treasury because Treasury did not receive a FOIA\n\nrequest from him, Gilmore Decl. ¶¶ 4–5, the Court will grant Treasury’s motion for summary\n\njudgment.\n\n       II.     The Court will grant in part and deny in part defendants’ motions for\n               summary judgment with respect to plaintiff’s claims arising under FOIA\n\n       The purpose of FOIA is to require the release of government records upon request and to\n\n“ensure an informed citizenry, vital to the functioning of a democratic society, needed to check\n\n\n\n6       Treasury also moves on these grounds under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).\nDefs.’ 1st Mem. at 4. In his opposition to Treasury’s motion, plaintiff disputes Treasury’s\nassertion that it never received his request. Pl.’s 1st Resp. at 1. Because the Court relies on\nevidence outside the complaint to resolve this dispute, the Court will decide the claim under Rule\n56, not 12(b)(6). See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(d) (“If, on a motion under Rule 12(b)(6) . . . , matters\noutside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion must be treated\nas one for summary judgment under Rule 56.”).\n                                               16\n\fagainst corruption and to hold the governors accountable to the governed.”           Nat’l Labor\n\nRelations Bd. v. Robbins Tire & Rubber Co., 437 U.S. 214, 242 (1978). At the same time,\n\nCongress recognized “that legitimate governmental and private interests could be harmed by\n\nrelease of certain types of information and provided nine specific exemptions under which\n\ndisclosure could be refused.” FBI v. Abramson, 456 U.S. 615, 621 (1982); see also Ctr. for Nat’l\n\nSec. Studies v. DOJ, 331 F.3d 918, 925 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (“FOIA represents a balance struck by\n\nCongress between the public’s right to know and the government’s legitimate interest in keeping\n\ncertain information confidential.”). The Supreme Court has instructed that “FOIA exemptions\n\nare to be narrowly construed.” Abramson, 456 U.S. at 630.\n\n       To prevail at the summary judgment phase in a typical FOIA action, an agency must\n\nsatisfy two elements. Leadership Conference on Civil Rights v. Gonzales, 404 F. Supp. 2d 246,\n\n252 (D.D.C. 2005). First, the agency must demonstrate that it has made “a good faith effort to\n\nconduct a search for the requested records, using methods which can be reasonably expected to\n\nproduce the information requested.” Oglesby v. U.S. Dep’t of Army, 920 F.2d 57, 68 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1990). Second, an agency must show that “materials that are withheld . . . fall within a FOIA\n\nstatutory exemption.” Leadership Conference on Rights, 404 F. Supp. 2d at 252. After asserting\n\nand explaining its exemptions, an agency must release “[a]ny reasonably segregable portion of a\n\nrecord” and provide it to the requesting party, “after deletion of the portions which are exempt.”\n\n5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(9).\n\n       The district court reviews the agency’s action de novo, and “the burden is on the agency\n\nto sustain its action.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B); accord Military Audit Project v. Casey, 656 F.2d\n\n724, 738 (D.C. Cir. 1981). Once the case comes to court, “FOIA cases are typically and\n\nappropriately decided on motions for summary judgment.” Moore v. Bush, 601 F. Supp. 2d 6, 12\n\n\n\n                                               17\n\f(D.D.C. 2009). In any motion for summary judgment, the Court “must view the evidence in the\n\nlight most favorable to the nonmoving party, draw all reasonable inferences in his favor, and\n\neschew making credibility determinations or weighing the evidence.” Montgomery v. Chao, 546\n\nF.3d 703, 706 (D.C. Cir. 2008); see also Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255 (1986). However, where a\n\nplaintiff has not provided evidence that an agency acted in bad faith, “a court may award\n\nsummary judgment solely on the basis of information provided by the agency in declarations.”\n\nMoore, 601 F. Supp. 2d at 12.\n\n       A.      Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies\n\n       Once a FOIA request has been processed, a plaintiff is required to exhaust all\n\nadministrative remedies before bringing an action to compel disclosure of documents. See 5\n\nU.S.C. § 552(a)(6); 28 C.F.R. § 16.9(c); Wilbur v. CIA, 355 F.3d 675, 677 (D.C. Cir. 2004).\n\nFailure to exhaust such remedies bars the lawsuit. See Banks v. DOJ, 813 F. Supp. 2d 132, 138–\n\n39 (D.D.C. 2011) (granting agency’s motion for summary judgment in FOIA action where\n\nplaintiff failed to file an administrative appeal before filing the lawsuit); Schwaner v. Dep’t of\n\nArmy, 696 F. Supp. 2d 77, 81 (D.D.C. 2010) (same).\n\n       However, because exhaustion is not a jurisdictional bar under FOIA, courts will deem a\n\nplaintiff to have constructively exhausted his administrative remedies with respect to a FOIA\n\nclaim when an agency “fails to comply with the applicable time limit provisions” of FOIA. 5\n\nU.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(C)(i). The agency has twenty days to make an initial determination, and\n\nfollowing an administrative appeal of a FOIA decision, twenty days to make a determination on\n\nthe appeal. 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(A)(i)–(ii). A requester will be found to have “constructively\n\nexhausted” his administrative remedies if, after the twenty days has expired but before the\n\nagency responds to his request, he files an action in federal court complaining that the agency\n\n\n\n                                               18\n\ffailed to respond to his FOIA request within the applicable time limit.            See 5 U.S.C.\n\n§ 552(a)(6)(C)(i) (2012); 28 C.F.R. § 16.9(a), (c) (2012); see also Oglesby, 920 F.2d at 70–71.\n\nConstructive exhaustion is applied narrowly: courts in this district have declined to find that a\n\nrequestor has constructively exhausted his administrative remedies if the agency responds to his\n\nrequest before he brings suit, even if the agency’s response is outside the statutory time limit.\n\nSee, e.g., Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Dept. of Energy, 888 F. Supp. 2d 189, 192–193 (D.D.C.\n\n2012).\n\n                1.     EOUSA\n\n         At the time plaintiff filed the complaint in this action, EOUSA had not responded to his\n\nrequest for documents, despite the expiration of the mandatory statutory time limit for agency\n\nresponse under FOIA.         Defs.’ 2d Mem. at 17 n.8.       EOUSA concedes that plaintiff’s\n\n“administrative remedies were constructively exhausted by the time he filed this lawsuit.” Id.\n\nAccordingly, the Court finds that plaintiff exhausted his administrative remedies with respect to\n\nhis claims against EOUSA under FOIA.\n\n\n                2.     ATF\n\n         But the ATF has moved to dismiss the FOIA claims against it under Federal Rule of Civil\n\nProcedure 12(b)(6) on the basis that plaintiff failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. 7\n\nDefs.’ 2d Mem. at 4–5. ATF issued two different decisions in response to plaintiff’s request: (1)\n\nit denied his August 3, 2011 request because it did not find any responsive documents; and (2) it\n\nlater disclosed redacted versions of documents that EOUSA had referred to it after the inception\n\n7      To this end, ATF relies on an affidavit attesting to the fact that plaintiff could have\nappealed. Defs.’ 2d Mem. at 4–5; 1st Boucher Decl. ¶¶ 7–8. Although ATF styles its motion as\na Rule 12(b)(6) motion, its reliance on the affidavit requires this Court to treat the motion as a\nRule 56 motion. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(d). See Hamilton v. Geithner, 743 F. Supp. 2d 1, 8 (D.D.C.\n2010); Lane v. Tschetter, Civ. A. No. 05-1414(EGS), 2007 WL 2007493, at *2 (D.D.C. July 10,\n2007).\n                                                19\n\fof this action. 1st Boucher Decl ¶¶ 5, 7. ATF claims that plaintiff has failed to exhaust the\n\navailable administrative remedies under FOIA without distinguishing between these two\n\ndifferent determinations. Defs.’ 2d Mem. at 4–5. Because plaintiff has not appealed either of\n\nthese decisions to OIP, ATF maintains, judicial review of its decisions is unavailable. Defs.’ 2d\n\nMem. at 5. For his part, plaintiff maintains that “it would be futile to undergo the deliberative\n\nand fruitless delay of further administrative review.” Pl.’s 2d Resp. at 36. The Court will\n\naddress each of ATF’s decisions separately.\n\n                      a. Plaintiff’s claim with respect to ATF’s August 3, 2011 decision is\n                         barred\n\n       With respect to the first set of documents, the Court agrees with ATF that plaintiff’s\n\nclaim under FOIA is barred for failure to exhaust his administrative remedies. When plaintiff\n\nreceived notification – in the letter dated August 3, 2011 – that his initial request to ATF had\n\nbeen denied, he was notified that he could appeal the decision to OIP. Ex. C to 1st Boucher\n\nDecl. Plaintiff did not do so. 1st Boucher Decl. ¶ 8.\n\n       Plaintiff is correct that in certain contexts, “the exhaustion requirement may be waived by\n\nthe agency, or disregarded by the court when application of the doctrine would be futile.” Cutler\n\nv. Hayes, 818 F.2d 879, 891 (D.C. Cir. 1987). “[S]till, as a jurisprudential doctrine, failure to\n\nexhaust precludes judicial review if the purposes of exhaustion and the particular administrative\n\nscheme support such a bar.” Wilbur v. CIA, 355 F.3d 675, 677 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted), quoting Hidalgo v. FBI, 344 F.3d 1256, 1258–59 (D.C. Cir. 2003).\n\nAnd “the FOIA’s administrative scheme favors treating failure to exhaust as a bar to judicial\n\nreview.” Hidalgo, 344 F.3d at 1259. Moreover, permitting plaintiff to obtain judicial review\n\nwithout exhausting his administrative remedies in this case would undermine the purpose for the\n\nexhaustion requirement: “preventing premature interference with agency processes, affording\n\n                                               20\n\fthe parties and the courts the benefit of the agency’s experience and expertise, or compiling a\n\nrecord which is adequate for judicial review.” Id. (alterations and internal quotation marks\n\nomitted), quoting Ryan v. Bentsen, 12 F.3d 245, 247 (D.C. Cir. 1993).\n\n        Therefore, with respect to ATF’s August 3, 2011 determination, defendants’ motion to\n\ndismiss, construed as a motion for summary judgment, will be granted.\n\n                       b. Plaintiff’s failure to file an administrative appeal of ATF’s\n                          determination under FOIA with respect to the documents referred to it\n                          by the EOUSA does not bar this Court’s review of the merits of the\n                          determination\n\n        The Court, however, finds a distinction between the challenges to ATF’s determination\n\nregarding the documents that ATF uncovered in its initial search and the determination on the\n\ndocuments referred to ATF by EOUSA after the initiation of this action. Plaintiff was first\n\ninformed of his right to appeal ATF’s decision regarding the documents referred to it by EOUSA\n\nby letter dated April 12, 2012, after plaintiff had already filed his complaint in this Court. Ex. E\n\nto 1st Boucher Decl. In other words, when plaintiff filed the instant lawsuit, there was no\n\nadministrative remedy available for plaintiff to exhaust regarding these documents.             See\n\nLuczynski Decl. ¶ 6 (showing EOUSA referred documents to ATF after plaintiff filed suit).\n\n        It is true that plaintiff did not exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to these\n\ndocuments in a literal sense. But a FOIA requester will be deemed to have “constructively\n\nexhausted” his administrative remedies “if the agency fails to comply with the applicable time\n\nlimit provisions.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(C)(i). The documents processed by ATF were actually\n\nin the possession of EOUSA, which had not responded to plaintiff’s request when plaintiff filed\n\nhis complaint in this action, despite the expiration of the applicable time limit for the agency to\n\nrespond. See, e.g., Oglesby, 920 F.2d at 65–66. EOUSA concedes this. Defs.’ 2d Mem. at 17\n\nn.8.   It would be anomalous to review plaintiff’s challenges to EOUSA’s withholdings of\n\n                                                21\n\fdocuments that were identified by EOUSA in the spring of 2012 and that were processed by\n\nEOUSA, but to decline review on exhaustion grounds the determinations of other agencies to\n\nwhich EOUSA sent some of the documents it identified at the same time. Compare Defs.’ 2d\n\nMem. at 17 n.8 (conceding administrative remedies were constructively exhausted) with 1st\n\nBoucher Decl. ¶ 8 (asserting that plaintiff has failed to exhaust his administrative remedies with\n\nrespect to his ATF request). Since the exhaustion requirement under FOIA is not jurisdictional,\n\nHidalgo, 344 F.3d at 1258, the Court finds that plaintiff has constructively exhausted his\n\nadministrative remedies with respect to the documents uncovered by EOUSA after the initiation\n\nof this action, regardless of whether they were processed by EOUSA or by another agency, such\n\nas ATF. Accordingly, the Court finds that plaintiff’s challenge to ATF’s determination on the\n\ndocuments it received from EOUSA is not barred for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.\n\n               3.      BOP\n\n                       a. The Court is barred from reviewing plaintiff’s challenge to BOP’s\n                          August 31, 2011 determination because plaintiff failed to exhaust his\n                          administrative remedies with respect to that determination\n\n       BOP argues that plaintiff is barred from seeking judicial review of BOP’s response to his\n\nFOIA request because he failed to exhaust all administrative remedies before filing the instant\n\nsuit. Defs.’ 2d Mem. at 9. Plaintiff argues that any further administrative review would be\n\n“futile.” Pl.’s 2d Resp. at 36.\n\n       With respect at least to the documents that were the subject of BOP’s August 31, 2011\n\nletter, plaintiff’s request differs little in relevant respects from his request to ATF: Plaintiff was\n\ninformed on August 31, 2011, that certain documents were being released to plaintiff, that others\n\nwere being withheld, and that he was entitled to an administrative appeal. Mack Decl. ¶ 15;\n\nAttach. 6 to Mack Decl. In addition, the letter informed plaintiff that he might obtain additional\n\n\n\n                                                 22\n\fdocuments by specifying that he also sought the records located in his central and medical files.\n\nMack Decl. ¶ 15; Attach. 6 to Mack Decl. Plaintiff responded to BOP on September 29, 2011,\n\nbut he did not file an administrative appeal with OIP. Mack Decl. ¶¶ 16, 20; Attach. 7 to Mack\n\nDecl.; Attach. 9 to Mack Decl. Plaintiff’s conclusory characterization of further administrative\n\nreview as “futile” is insufficient to overcome the rule that exhaustion of administrative remedies\n\nis a prerequisite to judicial review in this context for the same reasons that the Court discussed\n\nwith respect to ATF. Accordingly, the Court is barred from reviewing plaintiff’s challenge to\n\nBOP’s August 31, 2011 determination.\n\n                      b. BOP must identify which documents were referred to it by EOUSA\n                         and produce them or explain its basis for withholding them\n\n       Defendants argue that that plaintiff’s challenge to BOP’s withholding of the documents\n\nreferred to it by EOUSA after the initiation of this action is also barred because he failed to\n\nexhaust his administrative remedies. Defs.’ 2d Mem. at 17 n.7. The Court finds for the same\n\nreasons discussed above with respect to ATF that plaintiff has constructively exhausted his\n\nadministrative remedies, and the Court may therefore address the merits of his claim.\n\n       Moreover, BOP has yet to produce to plaintiff the documents referred to it by EOUSA or\n\nto explain the basis for its withholdings. See generally Mack Decl. (making no reference to\n\ndocuments referred to it by EOUSA). Consequently, plaintiff has not received any determination\n\non the referred documents, despite the fact that he had constructively exhausted his\n\nadministrative remedies. See Oglesby, 920 F.2d at 70–71. Accordingly, the Court will remand\n\nto BOP with the direction that it either produce the documents referred to it by EOUSA to\n\nplaintiff or justify any withholdings. The FOIA claims that remain, then, are against CRM,\n\nUSMS, EOUSA, and ATF for its handling of records transmitted to it by EOUSA.\n\n\n\n\n                                               23\n\f       B.      The agencies’ searches were adequate\n\n       In pursuing those claims, plaintiff challenges the adequacy of the agencies’ searches. 8\n\nCompl. ¶ 15; Pl.’s 1st Resp. at 3; Pl.’s 2d Resp. at 8–13. The Court finds that each of these\n\nagencies’ searches was adequate.\n\n       To prevail in a FOIA case, the agency must demonstrate that it has made “a good faith\n\neffort to conduct a search for the requested records, using methods which can be reasonably\n\nexpected to produce the information requested.” Ogelsby, 920 F.2d at 68. “[A]t the summary\n\njudgment phase, an agency must set forth sufficient information in its affidavits for a court to\n\ndetermine if the search was adequate.” Nation Magazine, Wash. Bureau v. U.S. Customs Serv.,\n\n71 F.3d 885, 890 (D.C. Cir. 1995), citing Oglesby, 920 F.2d at 68. Such agency affidavits\n\nattesting to a reasonable search “are afforded a presumption of good faith[,]” Defenders of\n\nWildlife v. U.S. Dep’t of Interior, 314 F. Supp. 2d 1, 8 (D.D.C. 2004), and “can be rebutted only\n\n‘with evidence that the agency’s search was not made in good faith.’” Id., quoting Trans Union\n\nLLC v. Fed. Trade Comm’n, 141 F. Supp. 2d 62, 69 (D.D.C. 2001).\n\n               1.      CRM\n\n       CRM maintains that it conducted an adequate search for records responsive to plaintiff’s\n\nrequest that was reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents. Defs.’ Reply at 4.\n\n\n\n\n8       Defendants argue that plaintiff waived any challenge to CRM’s search by not raising the\nissue in his opposition to first dispositive motion. Defs.’ Reply at 5. As discussed, where, as\nhere, a plaintiff appears pro se, “the Court must take particular care to construe the plaintiff's\nfilings liberally, for such complaints are held ‘to less stringent standards than formal pleadings\ndrafted by lawyers.’” Cheeks, 722 F. Supp. 2d at 107, quoting Haines, 404 U.S. at 520–21. The\nCourt will construe plaintiff’s assertion in his opposition to the original dispositive motion that to\ndate, “defendants continue to hide, suppress, and otherwise fail to identify” responsive records as\nan objection to the adequacy of defendants’ search. Pl.’s 1st Resp. at 3 (emphasis added).\n\n                                                 24\n\fPlaintiff disputes this assertion, in part contending that defendants’ failure to locate the three\n\nmissing audiotapes demonstrates the inadequacy of the search. Pl.’s 2d Resp. at 10–11.\n\n       To show that CRM performed adequate searches for responsive records, defendants\n\nsubmitted a declaration by John Cunningham III – a Trial Attorney in the CRM currently\n\nassigned to the FOIA and Privacy Act Unit.          Cunningham Decl. ¶ 1.      The Cunningham\n\ndeclaration states that, as a general practice, CRM searches its Central Criminal Division Index\n\nFile (“CRM-001”) in response to FOIA requests. Id. ¶ 9. The declaration further states that\n\nCRM searched CRM-001 as well as the CRM oracle menu – the Case Automated Tracking\n\nSystem (“CATS”). Id. ¶ 10. CRM used plaintiff’s name as a search term. Ex. 4 to Cunningham\n\nDecl. In addition, since plaintiff had indicated in his submission of materials to CRM that the\n\nsection of CRM that he reasonably believed might contain responsive records was the FOIA and\n\nPrivacy Act Unit of the Office of Enforcement Operations, CRM specifically searched that unit’s\n\nrecords. Cunningham Decl. ¶ 9; Ex. 3 to Cunningham Decl. The Cunningham declaration also\n\nindicates that it is common for CRM to find no records responsive to a federal inmate’s Privacy\n\nAct request because most federal criminal cases are prosecuted by EOUSA. Cunningham Decl.\n\n¶ 12. This affidavit therefore establishes that CRM searched the databases that were likely to\n\nturn up documents responsive to plaintiff’s requests using search terms that correspond to the\n\nscope of the requests.\n\n       Plaintiff specifically challenges CRM’s search on the basis that after informing him that\n\nit had found no responsive documents, it later “admitted” the existence of one document that had\n\noriginated with CRM. Pl.’s Sur-Resp. to Def.’s 1st Mot. at 1. Plaintiff appears to be referring to\n\nthe document that EOUSA referred to CRM after the inception of this action. The fact that\n\nEOUSA referred a document to CRM that it determined “may or may not be responsive” to\n\n\n\n                                               25\n\fplaintiff’s request does not make CRM’s search inadequate. See Ex. 9 to Cunningham Decl.\n\nFirst, it was EOUSA that uncovered the document in its files, not CRM. But even if CRM had\n\nuncovered additional documents after its initial search, “the mere fact that additional documents\n\nhave been discovered does not impugn the accuracy of the [agency] affidavits. The issue [is] not\n\nwhether any further documents might conceivably exist but whether [the agency]’s search for\n\nresponsive documents was adequate.” Goland v. CIA, 607 F.2d 339, 369 (D.C. Cir.1978).\n\n       The Court therefore finds, on the basis of the Cunningham declaration, that CRM’s\n\nsearch was “reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents.” Weisberg v. DOJ, 705\n\nF.2d 1344, 1351 (D.C. Cir. 1983). 9\n\n                2.     USMS\n\n       The Court similarly finds that USMS conducted an adequate search. Defendants have\n\nsubmitted   a    declaration   by   USMS     Associate    General    Counsel    and   Freedom     of\n\nInformation/Privacy Act Officer Bordley. Bordley Decl. ¶ 1. The Bordley declaration states that\n\nOGC searched the systems of records routinely searched for documents concerning prisoners for\n\ndocuments relating to plaintiff. Id. ¶¶ 4–5. OGC used plaintiff’s name as well as other personal\n\nidentifying information to identify documents indexed to him. Id. ¶ 4. The other personal\n\nidentifiers submitted to OGC included plaintiff’s date of birth, place of birth, social security\n\nnumber and information concerning his criminal case. Ex. A to Bordley Decl. USMS conducts\n\nsearches using the requestor’s name and/or other identifying information, often his prisoner\n\n\n9       In opposing the motion, plaintiff argues that summary judgment is ill advised prior to the\ntendering of a Vaughn index and the Court’s in camera inspection of the documents and records,\nparticularly three audio cassette tapes plaintiff alleges exist. Pl.'s 1st Resp. ¶ 9. Since plaintiff\nasserts the same arguments in a subsequent filing with respect to the defendants generally, see\nPl.’s 2d Resp. at 27–30, the Court will address these arguments altogether at the end of this\nMemorandum Opinion.\n\n                                                 26\n\fregistration number or social security number. Bordley Decl. ¶ 5. In addition, plaintiff identified\n\nthe Northern District of Texas as the location to be searched, and OGC confirmed that this was\n\nthe location where USMS would reasonably expect to find responsive documents. Bordley Decl.\n\n¶ 4; Ex. A to Bordley Decl.        USMS’s search located twenty-eight pages of responsive\n\ndocuments, and USMS produced those pages to plaintiff with some limited redactions. Bordley\n\nDecl. ¶ 6. In light of these facts, this Court finds, on the basis of Bordley’s affidavit, that the\n\nsearch was “reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents.” Weisberg, 705 F.2d at\n\n1351.\n\n               3.     EOUSA\n\n        Finally, the Court also finds that EOUSA conducted an adequate search. The Luczynski\n\ndeclaration states that, upon receiving plaintiff’s request, EOUSA requested that the United\n\nStates Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Texas search and forward responsive\n\ndocuments. Luczynski Decl. ¶ 8. The FOIA contact for the Northern District of Texas searched\n\nfor records from the case files of plaintiff’s criminal case, and sent e-mails to the Assistant\n\nUnited States Attorneys in the Criminal Division to ascertain whether they had any responsive\n\nrecords. Id. To search for files, the FOIA contact used the “LIONS” system, which is a\n\ncomputer system used by United States Attorneys’ Offices to access databases which can be used\n\nto retrieve files pertaining to cases and investigations based on a defendant’s name, the internal\n\nadministrative number for the case, and the district court case number. Id. The FOIA contact\n\nused plaintiff’s name as the search term. Id. According to the declarant, “[a]ll responsive\n\ndocuments to Plaintiff’s FOIA request would have been located in the [United States Attorney’s\n\nOffice for the Northern District of Texas]. There are no other records systems or locations\n\nwithin EOUSA or DOJ in which other files pertaining to Plaintiff’s name were maintained.” Id.\n\n\n\n                                                27\n\fThese affidavits establish that the agencies searched the databases that were likely to turn up\n\ndocuments responsive to plaintiff’s requests using search terms that correspond to the scope of\n\nthe requests. Plaintiff has not presented any evidence of bad faith on the part of the government.\n\nThe Court therefore finds, on the basis of defendants’ affidavits, that the searches were\n\n“reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents.” Weisberg, 705 F.2d at 1351.\n\n       Plaintiff argues that the searches performed by the DOJ subsections and by EOUSA were\n\ninadequate because they failed to turn up three responsive audio tapes that are in the agencies’\n\npossession. Pl.’s 2d Resp. at 11. But, “the mere fact that additional documents have been\n\ndiscovered does not impugn the accuracy of the [agency] affidavits. The issue [is] not whether\n\nany further documents might conceivably exist but whether [the agency’s] search for responsive\n\ndocuments was adequate.” Goland v. Cent. Intelligence Agency, 607 F.2d 339, 369 (D.C.\n\nCir.1978); see also Weisberg v. DOJ, 745 F.2d 1476, 1485 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (“[T]he issue to be\n\nresolved is not whether there might exist any other documents possibly responsive to the request,\n\nbut rather whether the search for those documents was adequate.”); Iturralde v. Comptroller of\n\nthe Currency, 315 F.3d 311, 315 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (“[T]he adequacy of a FOIA search is\n\ngenerally determined not by the fruits of the search, but by the appropriateness of the methods\n\nused to carry out the search.”); Adionser v. DOJ, 811 F. Supp. 2d 284, 293 (D.D.C. 2011)\n\n(rejecting a plaintiff’s challenge to the adequacy of a search because he challenged it “based on\n\nthe results of the search rather than the actual method by which” the search was conducted).\n\n        Plaintiff does not identify any problems with the way in which the search was\n\nconducted, but rather challenges the results of the search. As the Court has already explained,\n\nthe agencies have met their burden of demonstrating that the methods they used to search for\n\nresponsive documents can be reasonably expected to produce the information plaintiff requested.\n\n\n\n                                               28\n\fAnd although plaintiff lodges a series of conclusory allegations that the agencies acted in bad\n\nfaith, he does not proffer any evidence of bad faith. The Court therefore finds, on the basis of the\n\ngovernment’s declarations, that the agencies’ searches were “reasonably calculated to uncover all\n\nrelevant documents.” Weisberg v. Dep’t. of Justice, 705 F.2d 1344, 1351 (D.C. Cir. 1983).\n\n       C.     The agencies have met their burden to show that they released reasonably\n       segregable portions of responsive records with the exception of four documents\n       withheld by EOUSA\n\n       FOIA expressly requires agencies to extract “[a]ny reasonably segregable portion of a\n\nrecord” and provide it to the requesting party “after deletion of the portions which are exempt.”\n\n5 U.S.C. § 552(b). “[I]t has long been the rule in this Circuit that non-exempt portions of a\n\ndocument must be disclosed unless they are inextricably intertwined with exempt portions.”\n\nWilderness Soc’y v. U.S. Dep’t of Interior, 344 F. Supp. 2d 1, 18 (D.D.C. 2004) (emphasis in\n\noriginal), quoting Mead Data Cent., Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Air Force, 566 F.2d 242, 260 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1977). Agencies and courts must “differentiate among the contents of a document rather than to\n\ntreat it as an indivisible record for FOIA purposes.” Abramson, 456 U.S. at 626 (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).     Regardless of whether a party actually challenges an agency’s\n\ndetermination on the segregability of requested records, a district court must not “simply approve\n\nthe withholding of an entire document without entering a finding on segregability, or the lack\n\nthereof.” Schiller v. Nat’l Labor Relations Bd., 964 F.2d 1205, 1210 (D.C. Cir. 1992), abrogated\n\non other grounds by Milner v. Dep’t of Navy, 131 S. Ct. 1259 (2011) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted); see also Sussman v. U.S. Marshals Serv., 494 F.3d 1106, 1116 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (“If the\n\ndistrict court approves withholding without such a finding [of segregability], remand is required\n\neven if the requester did not raise the issue of segregability before the court.”). The district\n\ncourt’s findings of segregability must be “specific.” Sussman, 494 F.3d at 1116.\n\n\n\n                                                29\n\f       The government bears the burden of demonstrating that no reasonably segregable\n\nmaterial exists in the withheld documents. Army Times Publ’g Co. v. Dep’t of Air Force, 998\n\nF.2d 1067, 1068 (D.C. Cir. 1993). The agency must “provide[] a detailed justification and not\n\njust conclusory statements to demonstrate that all reasonably segregable information has been\n\nreleased.” Valfells v. CIA, 717 F. Supp. 2d 110, 120 (D.D.C. 2010) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted); see also Armstrong v. Exec. Office of the President, 97 F.3d 575, 578 (D.C. Cir. 1996)\n\n(affirming summary judgment where government affidavits explained non-segregability of\n\ndocuments with “reasonable specificity”).        The government may meet its obligation of\n\n“reasonable specificity” with “[t]he combination of the Vaughn index and [agency] affidavits.”\n\nJohnson v. Exec. Office for U.S. Att’ys, 310 F.3d 771, 776 (D.C. Cir. 2002); see also Loving v.\n\nDep’t of Def., 550 F.3d 32, 41 (D.C. Cir. 2008). Whether the Vaughn index is sufficient “turns\n\non whether the agency has sufficiently explained why there was no reasonable means of\n\nsegregating factual material from the claimed privileged material.” Wilderness Soc’y, 344 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 18. “[A] blanket declaration that all facts are so intertwined” is not sufficient to meet\n\nthis burden. Id. at 19.\n\n       With the exception that is explained later in this opinion in the context of plaintiff’s\n\nrequest to EOUSA, the Court finds that defendants have met their burden of showing with\n\nreasonable specificity that they disclosed all segregable material.          The grounds for this\n\nconclusion are explained along with the Court’s substantive discussion of the propriety of the\n\ngovernment’s withholdings.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 30\n\f       D.      FOIA Exemptions\n\n               1.    CRM did not err in withholding the Richter Memorandum pursuant to\n               Exemption (b)(5)\n\n        CRM argues that summary judgment is appropriate because the only document\n\nresponsive to plaintiff’s request that has been withheld is the Richter Memorandum, which it\n\ncontends was appropriately withheld subject to Exemption (b)(5). 10 Defs.’ 1st Mem. at 9–13.\n\nPlaintiff has generally challenged defendants’ invocation of Exemption (b)(5). See Pl.’s 2d\n\nResp. at 19–20.\n\n       FOIA Exemption (b)(5) allows agencies to withhold records if the requested documents\n\ninclude “inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by\n\nlaw to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency[.]” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(5). In\n\ndetermining whether a document was properly withheld under Exemption (b)(5), a court must\n\nensure that the document satisfies two conditions: (1) “its source must be a Government agency,\n\nand [(2)] it must fall within the ambit of a privilege against discovery under judicial standards\n\nthat would govern litigation against the agency that holds it.” Dep’t of Interior v. Klamath Water\n\nUsers Protective Ass’n, 532 U.S. 1, 8 (2001). These privileges include the attorney work product\n\nand deliberative process privileges, which are the two privileges that CRM contends protect the\n\nRichter Memorandum. Id.; Defs.’ 1st Mem. at 11–12. Since the Court finds that CRM has\n\nsatisfied the work product prong, it will not address the deliberative process prong.\n\n\n\n\n10      CRM also notes that it redacted the name and telephone number of the EOUSA employee\nwho referred the Richter Memorandum to CRM pursuant to Exemptions (b)(6) and (b)(7)(C).\nCunningham Decl. ¶ 17 n.2. Because plaintiff did not request – and has not disputed the\ndecision to withhold – this information, the only relevant exemption that the Court will address is\nExemption (b)(5). Moreover, even if the Court were to consider CRM’s reliance on Exemptions\n(b)(6) and (b)(7)(C), it would find that the agency’s withholdings were proper for the same\nreasons it finds USMS’s and EOUSA’s reliance on Exemption (b)(7)(C) was proper.\n                                                31\n\f       The work product doctrine protects “‘mental processes of the attorney,’” Klamath, 532\n\nU.S. at 8, quoting United States v. Nobles, 422 U.S. 225, 238 (1975), when such material was\n\n“prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial . . . .” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. DOJ, 432 F.3d\n\n366, 369 (D.C. Cir. 2005), quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(3) (internal quotation marks omitted). It\n\nextends to material which “can fairly be said to have been prepared or obtained because of the\n\nprospect of litigation.” Equal Emp’t Opportunity Comm’n v. Lutheran Soc. Servs., 186 F.3d 959,\n\n968 (D.C. Cir.1999) (internal quotation marks omitted). The doctrine also includes materials\n\nrelating to “foreseeable litigation, even if no specific claim is contemplated.” Schiller, 964 F.2d\n\nat 1208, abrogated on other grounds by Milner, 131 S.Ct. 1259. The “‘testing question’” when\n\nreviewing a withholding under the work-product prong of Exemption (b)(5) is “‘whether, in light\n\nof the nature of the document and the factual situation in the particular case, the document can\n\nfairly be said to have been prepared or obtained because of the prospect of litigation.’” In re\n\nSealed Case, 146 F.3d 881, 884 (D.C. Cir. 1998), quoting Senate of Puerto Rico v. DOJ, 823\n\nF.2d 574, 586 n.42 (D.C. Cir. 1987).\n\n       CRM maintains that, as a document created by the executive branch and that never left\n\nthe executive branch, the Richter Memorandum meets Exemption (b)(5)’s threshold requirement\n\nthat its source must be a government agency. Defs.’ 1st Mem. at 12. Because plaintiff does not\n\ndispute this assertion, and because there is no evidence that the government’s assertion is false,\n\nKlamath’s first prong is not at issue here. See 532 U.S. at 8.\n\n       CRM also contends that the document is predecisional and deliberative, and was prepared\n\nin anticipation of litigation, because it relates to “[c]harging under 18 U.S.C. 924(c) where the\n\nunderlying crime of violence is the possession of the same weapon.” Cunningham Decl. ¶ 19;\n\nsee also Ex. 11 to Cunningham Decl. Although plaintiff does not specifically dispute this\n\n\n\n                                                32\n\fassertion in his opposition to defendant’s summary judgment motion relating to the CRM\n\nrequest, he contends generally that Exemption (b)(5) does not protect factual material. Pl.’s 2d\n\nResp. at 19–20. But this argument is unavailing with respect to the work product doctrine.11\n\n“The work-product privilege simply does not distinguish between factual and deliberative\n\nmaterial.” Martin v. Office of Special Counsel Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., 819 F.2d 1181, 1187 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1987); see also Judicial Watch, 432 F.3d at 371, quoting Martin for the proposition that the\n\nwork-product doctrine does not “distinguish between factual and deliberative material.”);\n\nComptel v. FCC, 910 F. Supp. 2d 100, 122 (D.D.C. 2012) (“If a document is fully protected as\n\nwork product, then segregability is not required because that privilege does not distinguish\n\nbetween factual and deliberative materials.”) (internal quotation marks omitted); Tax Analysts v.\n\nIRS, 117 F.3d 607, 620 (D.D.C. 1997) (“The work product doctrine protects such deliberative\n\nmaterials but it also protects factual materials prepared in anticipation of litigation.”). Here, the\n\ngovernment has provided sufficient evidence that the Richter Memorandum is predecisional\n\nmaterial prepared in anticipation of plaintiff’s criminal trial. Since plaintiff has not presented\n\nevidence that controverts the government’s declaration or presented evidence of bad faith, the\n\nCourt finds that the document was properly withheld under the work-product prong of FOIA\n\nExemption (b)(5). See Defenders of Wildlife, 314 F. Supp. 2d at 8.\n\n       “If a document is fully protected as work product, then segregability is not required.”\n\nJudicial Watch, 432 F.3d at 371. Because the Richter Memorandum – the only document\n\nwithheld by CRM – was properly withheld in its entirety as attorney work product, the Court\n\nfinds that CRM has met its segregability obligations.\n\n\n\n\n11     The Court also notes that a memorandum related to a charging decision may contain\nsome facts, but is not solely factual.\n                                                 33\n\f               2.      USMS\n\n       USMS has withheld records under Exemptions (b)(7)(E) and (b)(7)(C). The Court will\n\nuphold its reliance on these exemptions.\n\n                       a. USMS appropriately redacted a record pursuant to FOIA Exemption\n                          (b)(7)(E)\n\n       FOIA Exemption 7(E) protects from disclosure law enforcement records “to the extent\n\nthat the production of such . . . information . . . would disclose techniques and procedures for law\n\nenforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement\n\ninvestigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk\n\ncircumvention of the law.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(E) (2012). “Exemption 7(E) sets a relatively\n\nlow bar for the agency to justify withholding: Rather than requiring a highly specific burden of\n\nshowing how the law will be circumvented, exemption 7(E) only requires that the [agency]\n\ndemonstrate logically how the release of the requested information might create a risk of\n\ncircumvention of the law.’” Blackwell v. FBI, 646 F.3d 37, 42 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (alteration in\n\noriginal) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n       USMS invoked Exemption (b)(7)(E) to withhold the secure website address of an internal\n\nUSMS database. Bordley Decl. ¶ 11. The document was otherwise produced in full. Id. ¶¶ 11–\n\n12. The Bordley declaration asserts that if the address were to be released, it could lead to the\n\ncircumvention of the law by allowing individuals to access a database used to process prisoners.\n\nId. ¶ 11. Plaintiff does not dispute Bordley’s assertion. Accordingly, the Court finds that USMS\n\nhas properly justified its withholding under FOIA. See generally Pl.’s 2d Resp.; see also Defs.’\n\nReply at 11. Moreover, based on the narrow scope of this redaction under on Exemption\n\n(b)(7)(E), and the fact that USMS released the rest of the redacted document to plaintiff, Bordley\n\n\n\n\n                                                34\n\fDecl. ¶ 11, the Court finds that USMS has met its obligation to disclose reasonably segregable\n\ninformation.\n\n                      b. USMS appropriately withheld portions of certain documents pursuant\n                         to Exemption (b)(7)(C)\n\n       FOIA Exemption (b)(7)(C) exempts documents compiled for law enforcement that\n\n“could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.”\n\n5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(C). USMS has redacted twelve records pursuant to this provision. Bordley\n\nDecl. ¶ 12.\n\n       In order for particular records to qualify for this exemption, the agency must first\n\ndemonstrate that the documents were compiled for law enforcement purposes. See Rural Hous.\n\nAlliance v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 498 F.2d 73, 80 (D.C. Cir. 1974). The Bordley declaration\n\nstates that all of the information at issue was compiled for the law enforcement purposes relating\n\nto USMS’s oversight of prisoners, including plaintiff. Bordley Decl. ¶ 9. Plaintiff acknowledges\n\nthat the law enforcement purpose threshold requirement exists, and he does not dispute that it has\n\nbeen satisfied here. Pl.’s 2d Resp. at 13–14.\n\n       This Circuit has consistently held that where a FOIA request for law enforcement records\n\ninvokes the privacy interests of any third party mentioned in those records (including\n\ninvestigators, suspects, witnesses, and informants), the exemption applies unless there is an\n\noverriding public interest in disclosure. See Schrecker v. DOJ, 349 F.3d 657, 661 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2003); Lewis v. DOJ, 609 F. Supp. 2d 80, 84 (D.D.C. 2009). So the first step in any Exemption\n\n(b)(7)(C) analysis is to determine whether any privacy interest exists; then the court balances the\n\nprivacy interest against the public interest in disclosure.    See, e.g., People for the Ethical\n\nTreatment of Animals v. Nat’l Insts. of Health Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 853 F. Supp. 2d\n\n146, 154–59 (D.D.C. 2012).\n\n                                                35\n\f       According to the Bordley declaration and the Vaughn index he provided, the information\n\nthat USMS withheld under Exemption (b)(7)(C) is identifying information – including names,\n\naddresses, and identification and prison registration numbers – of law enforcement officers,\n\nthird-party individuals, USMS employees, government employees, and other prisoners. Bordley\n\nDecl. ¶ 12.\n\n       “As a general rule, third-party identifying information contained in [law enforcement]\n\nrecords is ‘categorically exempt’ from disclosure.” Lazaridis v. U.S. Dep’t of State, -- F. Supp.\n\n2d --, Civ. A. No. 10-1280(RMC), 2013 WL 1226607, at *12 (D.D.C. Mar. 27, 2013). “Under\n\nExemption (b)(7)(C), an agency may “redact the names, addresses, or other identifiers of\n\nindividuals mentioned in investigatory files in order to protect the privacy of those persons.”\n\nNation Magazine, 71 F.3d at 896; see also Dunkelberger v. DOJ, 906 F.2d 779, 781 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1990), quoting Stern v. FBI, 737 F.2d 84, 91–92 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (“Exemption 7(C) takes\n\nparticular note of the ‘strong interest’ of individuals, whether they be suspects, witnesses, or\n\ninvestigators, ‘in not being associated unwarrantedly with alleged criminal activity.’”).\n\n       Plaintiff disputes USMS’s assertion that there is some privacy interest in the information\n\nhe requests because at least some of the named individuals, he argues, were “the subject of a\n\ngreat number of television and newspaper news reports.” Pl’s 2d Resp. at 23. While there is\n\nsome support for the notion that a private citizen waives her privacy interest in information when\n\nshe voluntarily brings that information into the public domain, see Nation Magazine, 71 F.3d at\n\n896, plaintiff merely asserts – without substantiating – the existence of such reports and thus has\n\nnot met his burden of showing that has occurred here. To establish that a privacy interest has\n\nbeen waived, the plaintiff bears the burden of showing that the information: “(1) is ‘as specific as\n\nthe information previously released’; (2) ‘match[es] the information previously disclosed’; and\n\n\n\n                                                36\n\f(3) was ‘made public through an official and documented disclosure.’” McRae v. DOJ, 869 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 151, 165 (D.D.C. 2012) (alteration in original), quoting Fitzgibbon v. CIA, 911 F.2d\n\n755, 765 (D.C. Cir. 1990). Plaintiff has not met that burden. Plaintiff has presented no evidence\n\nthat any individual publicly disclosed his or her role in his criminal prosecution, much less that\n\nthe information publicly disclosed is the same as the information being withheld. See Span v.\n\nDOJ, 696 F. Supp. 2d 113, 122 (D.D.C. 2010), quoting Cottone v. Reno, 193 F.3d 550, 554\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1999) (“Because Span has not identified any specific information or . . . ‘the exact\n\nportions’ of a specific document that is in fact ‘preserved in a permanent public domain,’ his\n\npublic domain challenge fails.”) (emphasis in original).         Accordingly, the Court finds a\n\nsubstantial privacy interest in the withheld identifying information.\n\n       Where – as here – a legitimate privacy interest exists, the requester must next “(1) show\n\nthat the public interest sought to be advanced is a significant one, an interest more specific than\n\nhaving the information for its own sake, and (2) show the information is likely to advance that\n\ninterest.” Boyd v. Criminal Div. of the U.S. DOJ, 475 F.3d 381, 387 (D.C. Cir. 2007), quoting\n\nNat’l Archives & Records Admin. v. Favish, 541 U.S. 157, 172 (2004) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted). The Supreme Court has determined that the only relevant public interest for purposes\n\nof Exemption (b)(7)(C) is “the citizens’ right to be informed about what their government is up\n\nto.” DOJ v. Reporters Comm. for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749, 773 (1989) (internal\n\nquotation marks and citations omitted). In determining whether to disclose a document, a court\n\nmust weigh “the nature of the requested document and its relationship to ‘the basic purpose of\n\nthe Freedom of Information Act to open agency action to the light of public scrutiny.’” Id. at\n\n772, quoting Dep’t of Air Force v. Rose, 425 U.S. 352, 372 (1976). “That purpose, however, is\n\nnot fostered by disclosure of information about private citizens that is accumulated in various\n\n\n\n                                                37\n\fgovernmental files but that reveals little or nothing about an agency’s own conduct.” Id. at 773\n\n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted).         Moreover, courts in this Circuit have\n\nconsistently held that where an individual seeks law enforcement records that implicate the\n\nprivacy interests of a third party, the requester bears the burden of asserting the public interest at\n\nplay. See, e.g., Boyd, 475 F.3d at 387; Lewis, 609 F. Supp. 2d at 84; Fischer v. DOJ, 596 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 34, 47 (D.D.C. 2009). Law enforcement records may be withheld under Exemption\n\n(b)(7)(C) “if the privacy interest at stake outweighs the public’s interest in disclosure.” Nation\n\nMagazine, 71 F.3d at 893 (citations omitted).\n\n       Defendants argue that plaintiff presents no legitimate public interest favoring disclosure\n\nof the personal identifying information withheld under Exemption (b)(7)(C). Defs.’ 2d Mem. at\n\n14–15. Rather, according to defendants, disclosure would allow the individuals whose names\n\nand other personal information were redacted, to be subjected to unwarranted attention,\n\nharassment, and other threats. Id. at 15. The Court agrees.\n\n       For his part, plaintiff maintains that defendants’ balancing test is a “perfunctory sham”\n\nused to withhold documents. Pl.’s 2d Resp. at 14. He also alleges that the documents will reveal\n\nexculpatory and/or mitigating statements that will reveal his innocence in regards to the criminal\n\noffense for which he was convicted, as well as his role in securing the criminal conviction of\n\nanother individual for murder. See id. at 15, 22. But he fails to explain how identifying\n\ninformation of third parties – the only withheld information – could be exculpatory and/or\n\nmitigating. Moreover, the interest in revealing exculpatory information about one individual’s\n\ncriminal case is not the type of public interest protected by FOIA because it would “reveal[] little\n\nor nothing about an agency’s own conduct.” Reporters Comm., 489 U.S. at 773. “That the\n\n[agency]’s denial of his FOIA requests may hinder his efforts to challenge his conviction or\n\n\n\n                                                 38\n\fsentence . . . is irrelevant.” Pugh v. FBI, 793 F. Supp. 2d 226, 233 (D.D.C. 2011), citing Oguaju\n\nv. United States, 378 F.3d 1115, 1116–17 (D.C. Cir. 2004).\n\n       Plaintiff also maintains that “the naming of law enforcement Agents who conducted the\n\nspecific wit[n]ess interviews of” the murderer in whose conviction plaintiff claims to have\n\nplayed a role and of the agents “who took into th[ei]r possession the audio-taps and investigative\n\ncase[] notes and the explosive investigation reports” are matters of significant public interest\n\nbecause they would “cast the light of day on how citizenry’s Government operates.” Pl.’s 2d\n\nResp. at 27. 12 This description however fails to state how the disclosure of such identifying\n\ninformation would shed any light on the way that the government operates. Because plaintiff has\n\nnot identified any public interest that would overcome the privacy interest protected by\n\nExemption (b)(7)(C), the Court finds that USMS’s withholdings were proper. The Court also\n\nnotes that the limited scope of the redactions made by USMS under Exemption (b)(7)(C) –\n\nwhich includes only the names, addresses, and other identifying information of third parties,\n\nBordley Decl. ¶ 12 – satisfies the Court that USMS has met its burden to release all reasonably\n\nsegregable material.\n\n               3.      ATF\n\n       Since the Court has already found that plaintiff constructively exhausted his\n\nadministrative remedies with respect to the documents referred to ATF from EOUSA, it will\n\n\n\n\n12      Plaintiff also requests documents because he claims that they are relevant to his criminal\ncase. See, e.g., Pl.’s 2d Resp. at 22. However, a requester’s interest in his own case is\ninsufficient to establish a relevant public interest. “[T]he only public interest relevant for\npurposes of Exemption 7(C) is one that focuses on ‘the citizens’ right to be informed about what\ntheir government is up to.’” Davis v. DOJ, 968 F.2d 1276, 1282 (D.C. Circ. 1992) (internal\nquotations marks and citations omitted)\n\n\n                                               39\n\fproceed to address whether ATF’s withholdings of portions of those records under Exemption\n\n(b)(7)(C) were justified. It finds that they were.\n\n       The information that ATF has withheld under Exemption (b)(7)(C) is the names and\n\nidentifying information of federal law enforcement agents, federal law enforcement employees,\n\nand third-party individuals. 1st Boucher Decl. ¶ 7. As the Court already explained in detail in its\n\ndiscussion of USMS’s reliance on Exemption (b)(7)(C), an agency may “redact the names,\n\naddresses, or other identifiers of individuals mentioned in investigatory files in order to protect\n\nthe privacy of those persons.” Nation Magazine, 71 F.3d at 896. Thus, ATF identified an\n\nadequate privacy interest in the information it has withheld.\n\n       Plaintiff advances the same alleged public interests in disclosing the information ATF has\n\nwithheld under Exemption (b)(7)(C) that he advanced with respect to the information USMS has\n\nwithheld. Pl.’s 2d Resp. at 14–15. The Court finds them unavailing for the reasons already\n\ndiscussed.   Accordingly, the Court finds that defendants properly relied upon Exemption\n\n(b)(7)(C) to withhold the disputed information. Boyd, 475 F.3d at 387. In addition, the limited\n\nscope of the redactions made by ATF under Exemption (b)(7)(C) – which includes only the\n\nnames and other identifying information of third parties, 1st Boucher Decl. ¶ 7 – satisfies the\n\nCourt that ATF has met its burden to release all reasonably segregable material.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 40\n\f                  4.      EOUSA\n\n           In withholding documents and information responsive to plaintiff’s FOIA request,\n\nEOUSA relies on Exemptions (b)(3), (b)(5), (b)(6), and (b)(7)(C). Luczynski Decl. ¶ 6. Plaintiff\n\nchallenges each of these exemptions except Exemption (b)(3). Pl.’s 2d Resp. at 13–15, 17–21.\n\nThe Court will address each of these exemptions in turn.\n\n                          a. EOUSA properly withheld records pursuant to FOIA Exemption (b)(3)\n\n           EOUSA relies on Exemption (b)(3) to withhold conflict of interest forms. Luczynski\n\nDecl. ¶¶ 13–14. 13 FOIA Exemption (b)(3) authorizes the government to withhold information\n\nthat is:\n\n           [S]pecifically exempted from disclosure by statute . . . if that statute\n\n           (A)(i) requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to\n           leave no discretion on the issue; or\n\n           (ii) establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of\n           matters to be withheld; and\n\n           (B) if enacted after the date of enactment of the OPEN FOIA Act of 2009\n           [enacted Oct. 28, 2009], specifically cited to this paragraph.\n\n5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(3). Defendants point to 5 U.S.C. app § 107(a)(2) as the statute that bars the\n\ndisclosure of conflict of interest forms under Exemption (b)(3). Luczynski Decl. ¶¶ 13–14.\n\nPlaintiff does not challenge EOUSA’s reliance on Exemption (b)(3) to withhold this form, so this\n\n\n13      Although the EOUSA does not explain in any detail who the conflict of interest forms\npertain to or what they contain, the Court can infer by EOUSA’s reference to 5 U.S.C. App.\n§ 107(a) that these forms are certifications that Assistant United States Attorneys file for each\ncase to which he or she is assigned. See Concepcion v. FBI, 606 F. Supp. 2d 14, 33–34 (D.D.C.\n2009) (characterizing conflict of interest certifications withheld under Exemption (b)(3) as forms\nthat each Assistant United States Attorney must complete for each case to which he is assigned),\nciting Glascoe v. DOJ, Civ. A. No. 04-0486(RJL), 2005 WL 1139269, at *2 (D.D.C. May 15,\n2005); see also Glascoe, 2005 WL 1139269, at *1 n.2 (characterizing conflict of interest\ncertifications withheld under Exemption (b)(3) as “an approved alternative to the Office of\nGovernment Ethics standard form 450”).\n\n                                                     41\n\fCourt may properly treat the issue as conceded. McMillan v. WMATA, 898 F. Supp. 2d 64, 69\n\n(D.D.C. 2012), citing Howard v. Locke, 729 F. Supp. 2d 85, 87 (D.D.C. 2010). 14\n\n                       b. EOUSA properly withheld records pursuant to FOIA Exemption (b)(5)\n\n       The next exemption EOUSA relies upon is Exemption (b)(5). Luczynski Decl. ¶¶ 16–17.\n\nAs explained above with regards to the records that CRM has withheld under this exemption,\n\nExemption (b)(5) allows agencies to withhold from production inter- or intra-agency documents\n\nthat would not be available in litigation. 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(5). As with CRM’s invocation of\n\nthis exemption, there is no dispute that the EOUSA is a government agency; therefore, the\n\nrelevant question is whether the documents withheld “fall within the ambit of a privilege against\n\ndiscovery under judicial standards that would govern litigation against the agency that holds it.”\n\nKlamath, 532 U.S. at 8. Like CRM, EOUSA identifies two such privileges: (1) the attorney\n\nwork product doctrine and (2) the deliberative process privilege. Luczynski Decl. ¶ 17. Because\n\nthe Court finds that the attorney work product doctrine covers EOUSA’s withholdings, the Court\n\nneed not address the deliberative process privilege.\n\n       As explained above, the attorney work product doctrine permits the withholding of\n\nmaterial that is “prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial. . . .” Judicial Watch, 432 F.3d\n\nat 369, quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 26 (b)(3).         EOUSA withheld the following categories of\n\ndocuments pursuant to Exemption (b)(5)’s attorney work product privilege prong:\n\n            A “[p]rintout of an e-mail exchange between attorneys for the government\n            discussing various issues and how they relate to prosecution of plaintiff,” (Document\n            No. 1);\n\n\n14      The Court notes that case law in this Circuit supports defendants’ argument that\nEOUSA’s conflict of interest forms are exempt from FOIA disclosure requirements under\nExemption (b)(3). See Concepcion, 606 F. Supp. 2d at 33–34 (finding EOUSA conflict of\ninterest forms appropriately withheld under Exemption (b)(3)); Lopez v. Exec. Office for U.S.\nAttorneys, 598 F.

Based on the descriptions of these documents, the\n\nCourt is satisfied that each of them can fairly be said to have been prepared or obtained because\n\nof the prospect of a criminal case being brought against plaintiff. See Lutheran Soc. Servs., 186\n\nF.3d at 968.\n\n       Plaintiff argues that the documents should be produced because the only material he\n\nseeks is factual in nature. But even “factual material is itself privileged when it appears within\n\ndocuments that are attorney work product.” Judicial Watch, 432 F.3d at 371.\n\n       Plaintiff also suggests – although he does not expressly argue – that the attorney work\n\nproduct doctrine does not protect documents when a party demonstrates a “substantial need.”\n\nPl.’s 2d Resp. at 19. But while that limitation may apply in the context of civil litigation\n\ndiscovery, it does not apply in the context of FOIA. Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Dept. of\n\nHomeland Sec., 841 F. Supp. 2d 142, 156 n. 8 (D.D.C. 2012), citing Williams & Connolly v.\n\nSecs. & Exch. Comm’n, 662 F.3d 1240, 1243 (D.C. Cir. 2011). Because the government has\n\nadequately demonstrated that these documents fall under the attorney work product privilege, the\n\nCourt finds that they were properly withheld under Exemption (b)(5). See Judicial Watch, 432\n\n                                                  43\n\fF.3d at 371 (“If a document is fully protected as work product, then segregability is not\n\nrequired.”).\n\n                         c. EOUSA properly withheld records pursuant to FOIA Exemption\n                            (b)(7)(C), but did not properly release segregable material\n\n       Next, EOUSA withheld certain categories of documents pursuant to Exemption\n\n(b)(7)(C). 15 Luczynski Decl. ¶¶ 23–24. EOUSA has invoked Exemption (b)(7)(C) to withhold\n\nthe following documents in full 16:\n\n               A “[f]acsimile regarding a Bench Warrant relating to the plaintiff,” (Document No.\n               4);\n\n                A “[l]etter from probation officer addressing issues relating to the Victim Witness,”\n               (Document No. 7);\n\n               A “[d]ocument titled ‘Search Warrant Application and Affidavit,’” (Document No.\n               8); and\n\n               A “[d]raft of a ‘Criminal Complaint,” which “contains sensitive information\n               provided by witnesses as well as information identifying those witnesses,”\n               (Document No. 9).\n\nVaughn Index, Attach. to Luczynski Decl.\n\n       In each instance, “Exemption (b)(7)(C) [was] asserted to protect the names and other\n\nidentifying information of third parties, witnesses, and law enforcement personnel who provided\n\n\n\n\n15      Every document withheld under Exemption (b)(6) was also withheld under Exemption\n(b)(7)(C). See Vaughn Index, Attach. To Luczynski Decl. FOIA Exemption (B)(7)(C) exempts\ndocuments compiled for law enforcement that “could reasonably be expected to constitute an\nunwarranted invasion of personal privacy.” 5 USC § 552(b)(7)(C). Because this is a lower\nstandard than Exemption 6, which requires a “clearly unwarranted” invasion of privacy, id.\n§ 552(b)(6) (emphasis added), the Court will address only Exemption (b)(7)(C). See Reporters\nComm., 489 U.S. at 756.\n\n16      This list does not include documents withheld under Exemption (b)(7)(C) that the Court\nhas already permitted to be withheld under some other FOIA exemption.\n\n                                                  44\n\finformation to the investigation team on the grounds that disclosure could reasonably be\n\nexpected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.” Id.\n\n          The information withheld pursuant to Exemption (b)(7)(C) by EOUSA was of the same\n\nnature as the information withheld under the same exemption by USMS and ATF, compare\n\nBordley Decl. ¶ 12 with Vaughn Index, Attach. to Luczynski Decl., and plaintiff made the same\n\narguments to challenge all of them. The Court finds, based on the same legal analysis that it\n\nused to assess the application of Exemption (b)(7)(C) by USMS and ATF, that EOUSA properly\n\nwithheld the identifying information. See Boyd , 475 F.3d at 387; Lazaridis, 2013 WL 1226607,\n\nat *12.\n\n          However,   while      EOUSA   appropriately   withheld    information   pursuant    to\n\nExemption (b)(7)(C), the justifications provided in the Vaughn index are insufficient to explain\n\nwhy each of the previously discussed documents were withheld in full. Vaughn Index, Attach to\n\nLuczynski Decl. “[I]t has long been the rule in this Circuit that non-exempt portions of a\n\ndocument must be disclosed unless they are inextricably intertwined with exempt portions.”\n\nWilderness Soc’y, 344 F. Supp. 2d at 18 (emphasis in original), quoting Mead Data Cent., 566\n\nF.2d at 260. With respect to each of these documents, the Vaughn index states that “[n]o page\n\nwas determined segregable after a review for segregability.” Vaughn Index, Attach. to Luczynski\n\nDecl. However, this statement does not provide enough information for the Court to determine\n\nwhether the document contains disclosable portions that are not “inextricably intertwined” with\n\nthe identifying information that is properly withheld under Exemption (b)(7)(C). Wilderness\n\nSoc’y, 344 F. Supp. 2d at 18.\n\n          Accordingly, on July 25, 2013, the Court ordered defendants to deliver those four\n\ndocuments to chambers for in camera inspection in order to assist the Court in making a\n\n\n\n                                               45\n\fresponsible de novo determination. Minute Order (July 25, 2013). The Court has now reviewed\n\nthose documents and finds that all four of them contain portions that are not inextricably\n\nintertwined with identifying information about third parties, witnesses, and law enforcement\n\npersonnel. On that basis, the Court will order EOUSA to disclose the following portions of those\n\ndocuments, which the Court has determined are segregable: 17\n\n           From EOUSA Document 4: Page two of the record, except the names and fax\n           numbers that appear in the header on that page.\n\n           From EOUSA Document 7: All nine pages of the record, except: (1) the name and\n           address of the addressee that appears on pages one and six of the record; (2) the name\n           of the U.S. Probation Officer that appears on pages two and seven of the record; and\n           (3) the name and title of the individual copied on the correspondence that appears on\n           pages two and seven of the record.\n\n           From EOUSA Document 8: All eleven pages of the record, except: (1) the name of\n           the Special Agent, which appears throughout the record; (2) the initials that appear\n           throughout the record to identify a particular individual; (3) paragraph twelve on page\n           four of the record; (4) the second, third, and fourth sentences of paragraph thirteen on\n           page five of the record; and (5) paragraph sixteen on page five of the record; (6)\n           paragraph two on page nine of the record; (7) the second, third, and fourth sentences\n           of paragraph three on pages nine to ten of the record; (8) paragraph six on page ten of\n           the record; and (9) the name of the individual, identified as an employee of the Texas\n           Department of Public Safety Crime Lab, that appears in paragraph twelve on page\n           eleven of the record.\n\n           From EOUSA Document 9: All eight pages of the record, except: (1) the name of\n           the Special Agent, which appears throughout the record; (2) the initials that appear\n           throughout the record to identify a particular individual; (3) paragraph one on page\n           one of the record; (4) the second, third, and fourth sentences of paragraph two on\n           page two of the record; (5) paragraph five on page two of the record; (6) paragraph\n\n\n17      The Court notes that although Document Number 9 is described in EOUSA’s Vaughn\nIndex as a draft of a criminal complaint, defendants have not asserted Exemption (b)(5) as a\nbasis for the withholding. In addition, although defendants wrote in the “justification” column of\nthe Vaughn Index for document number 4 that, “[d]isclosure of any portion of the document\nwould disclose attorney work product and the deliberate process concerning a particular case,\nthus the document is not segregable,” they did not assert Exemption (b)(5) as a basis for the\nwithholding. Even so, the Court would find based on its in camera review of the document, that\nit is not covered by either the attorney work product privilege or the deliberative process\nprivilege.\n\n\n                                               46\n\f              one on pages four to five of the record; (7) the first three sentences of paragraph two\n              on page five of the record; (8) the three words following the phrase “photographs of\n              Improvised Explosive Weapon left” that appear in paragraph five on page five of the\n              record; (9) all names that appear in paragraph five on pages five to six of the record;\n              (10) paragraphs six through ten that appear on pages six to seven of the record.\n                 5.      The Court need not examine any other FOIA exemptions\n\n       Plaintiff also identifies a handful of FOIA exemptions which he contends are inadequate\n\nto justify withholding responsive documents from production, but which the agencies never\n\ninvoked. 18    Pl.’s 2d Resp. 15–17, 20–21.       Because defendants have not relied upon these\n\nexemptions to withhold any material, the Court need not examine plaintiff’s arguments\n\nconcerning them.\n\n       III.      The Privacy Act\n\n       The Privacy Act provides:\n\n                 Each agency that maintains a system of records shall . . . upon request by\n                 any individual to gain access to his record or to any information pertaining\n                 to him which is contained in the system, permit him . . . to review the\n                 record and have a copy made of all or any portion thereof in a form\n                 comprehensible to him . . . .\n\n5 U.S.C. § 552a(d)(1). Thus, for the disclosure provision to apply, the material at issue must be a\n\n“record” that is, in turn, contained in a “system of records.” Fisher v. Nat’l Inst. of Health, 934\n\nF. Supp. 464, 468 (D.D.C. 1996).\n\n       When a plaintiff challenges an agency’s withholding of documents under the Privacy\n\nAct, the court determines de novo whether the withholding was proper, and the burden is on the\n\nagency to sustain its action. 5 U.S.C. § 552a(g)(3)(A); Doe v. United States, 821 F.2d 694, 697–\n\n98 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (en banc) (finding that in this context, de novo means “a fresh, independent\n\ndetermination of ‘the matter’ at stake,” and the court need not give “deference . . . [to] the\n\nagency’s conclusion”); see also Skinner v. DOJ, 584 F.3d 1093, 1096 (D.C. Cir. 2009). “[T]he\n\n18     These exemptions are (b)(4), (b)(7)(D), and (b)(7)(F). Pl.’s 2d Resp. 15–17, 20–21.\n                                                  47\n\f[Privacy] Act ‘safeguards the public from unwarranted collection, maintenance, use and\n\ndissemination of personal information contained in agency records . . . by allowing an individual\n\nto participate in ensuring that his records are accurate and properly used.” McCready v.\n\nNicholson, 465 F.3d 1, 7–8 (D.C. Cir. 2006), quoting Bartel v. Fed. Aviation Admin., 725 F.2d\n\n1403, 1407 (D.C. Cir. 1984).\n\n       Where a request for documents is made under both FOIA and the Privacy Act, the\n\nresponding agency “must demonstrate that the documents fall within some exemption under each\n\nAct.” Martin, 819 F.2d at 1184 (emphasis in original). “If a FOIA exemption covers the\n\ndocuments, but a Privacy Act exemption does not, the documents must be released under the\n\nPrivacy Act; if a Privacy Act exemption but not a FOIA exemption applies, the documents must\n\nbe released under FOIA.” 19 Id.\n\n       A.    The Court does not have jurisdiction to consider plaintiff’s challenges to the\n       withholdings by CRM, ATF, or BOP under the Privacy Act because plaintiff has not\n       exhausted his administrative remedies\n\n       Plaintiff’s claims challenging CRM’s, ATF’s, and BOP’s withholdings under the Privacy\n\nAct are barred because plaintiff failed to exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to\n\nthose withholdings. As with FOIA, once a Privacy Act request has been processed, a plaintiff is\n\nrequired to exhaust all administrative remedies before bringing an action to compel disclosure of\n\ndocuments. See Haase v. Sessions, 893 F.2d 370, 373 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (finding a cause of action\n\nunder the Privacy Act to be subject to administrative exhaustion requirement). Failure to exhaust\n\none’s remedies bars the lawsuit. See Mulhern v. Gates, 525 F. Supp. 2d 174, 187 (D.D.C. 2007)\n\n(dismissing Privacy Act suit brought without exhaustion of administrative remedies for lack of\n\n\n19     It is worth noting that plaintiff has not challenged any of defendants’ withholdings under\nthe Privacy Act, and so the Court may properly treat those withholdings as conceded. See\nMcMillan v. WMATA, 898 F. Supp. 2d 64, 69 (D.D.C. 2012), citing Howard v. Locke, 729 F.\nSupp. 2d 85, 87 (D.D.C. 2010).\n                                               48\n\fsubject matter jurisdiction). Indeed, failure to exhaust administrative remedies under the Privacy\n\nAct is a jurisdictional deficiency because exhaustion is required by statute. See 5. U.S.C.\n\n§ 552a(d)(1)–(3); 5 U.S.C. § 552a(g)(1)(B); Mulhern, 525 F. Supp. 2d at 183 (“Premature\n\nPrivacy Act suits [for improperly withholding documents] are dismissed for lack of subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction.”); Kursar v. Transp. Sec. Admin., 581 F. Supp. 2d 7, 18 (D.D.C. 2008)\n\n(same). “A person seeking judicial review of an agency’s handling of his or her Privacy Act\n\nrequest must actually exhaust the available administrative remedies.” Makuch v. FBI, No. Civ.A\n\n99-1094 RMU, 2000 WL 915640, at *4 (D.D.C. Jan. 5, 2000).\n\n       With respect to CRM, there is no dispute that plaintiff exhausted the available\n\nadministrative remedies for challenging its initial determination on his Privacy Act request by\n\nfiling a timely appeal with OIP. Cunningham Decl. ¶ 13; see also Ex. 6 to Cunningham Decl.\n\nBut there is no indication that plaintiff appealed CRM’s subsequent determination to withhold\n\nthe Richter Memorandum – the document referred to CRM by EOUSA after plaintiff filed the\n\ncomplaint in this action. See Ex. 11 to Cunningham Decl. Even though CRM did not provide a\n\njustification under the Privacy Act in its April 18, 2012 letter informing plaintiff that it was\n\nwithholding the Richter memorandum, plaintiff must raise that deficiency in a timely appeal to\n\nOIP before this Court obtains jurisdiction to hear it. 20 And because exhaustion under the Privacy\n\nAct is jurisdictional, the Court cannot find that plaintiff constructively exhausted his\n\nadministrative remedies.     In addition, there is no evidence that plaintiff exhausted his\n\nadministrative remedies with respect to the Richter memorandum when it was being withheld by\n\nEOUSA because, as will be discussed below, plaintiff did not administratively challenge\n\nEOUSA’s failure to timely respond to his request. Accordingly, this Court does not have\n\n\n20       The letter did inform plaintiff of his right to an administrative appeal and of the process\nfor filing an appeal.\n                                                49\n\fjurisdiction over his challenge to CRM’s withholding of the Richter memorandum under the\n\nPrivacy Act. Makuch , 2000 WL 915640, at *4.\n\n       With respect to both BOP and ATF, plaintiff is barred from challenging the agencies’\n\ninitial determinations on his Privacy Act request because he did not file appeals of either of those\n\ndeterminations with OIP. Attach. 9 to Mack Decl. (BOP); 1st Boucher Decl. ¶ 8 (ATF).\n\n       Both agencies also obtained documents from EOUSA after the initiation of this action.\n\nBOP never contacted plaintiff regarding these documents. See generally Mack Decl. (making no\n\nreference to documents referred to BOP by EOUSA).             ATF informed plaintiff that it had\n\nreceived documents from EOUSA and that it was releasing them to plaintiff with redactions. Ex.\n\nE to 1st Boucher Decl. But, while it justified the redactions under FOIA, it did not justify them\n\nunder the Privacy Act. Id. Even though all of these events occurred after plaintiff had already\n\nfiled the complaint in this action, he is jurisdictionally barred from challenging them here\n\nbecause he failed to first file an appeal with OIP. Mulhern, 525 F. Supp. 2d at 183.\n\n       B.      Plaintiff’s Privacy Act claims with respect to EOUSA are barred\n\n       EOUSA appears to be willing to concede that plaintiff had constructively exhausted his\n\nadministrative remedies at the time he filed suit. Defs.’ 2d Mem. at 17 n.8. But, “[t]he Privacy\n\nAct contains no equivalent to FOIA's constructive-exhaustion provision.” Makuch, 2000 WL\n\n915640, at *4. Despite defendant’s concession, “[a] claim that the court lacks jurisdiction under\n\nArticle III of the Constitution may not be waived, . . . and the court is obligated to address it sua\n\nsponte.” Doe ex rel. Fein v. District of Columbia, 93 F.3d 861, 871 (D.C. Cir. 1996), citing\n\nBender v. Williamsport Area Sch. Dist., 475 U.S. 534, 541 (1986). Accordingly, the Court must\n\nfind that plaintiff failed to exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to his request to\n\n\n\n\n                                                 50\n\fEOUSA, and the Court’s consideration of EOUSA’s justification for its withholdings under the\n\nPrivacy Act on the merits is therefore barred for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n\n        C.   Plaintiff has not established that USMS inappropriately declined to produce\n        documents pursuant to the Privacy Act\n\n        Plaintiff did, however, appeal USMS’s withholdings under the Privacy Act, so this\n\nCourt’s review of that agency’s action is not jurisdictionally barred. USMS asserts that all of the\n\nrecords at issue here fall under an exemption to disclosure under the Privacy Act, codified at 5\n\nU.S.C. § 552a(j)(2) (“Exemption j(2)”). Defs.’ 2d Mem. at 13 n.5. Exemption j(2) applies if: (1)\n\nthe records are stored in a system of records that has been designated by the agency to be exempt\n\nfrom the Privacy Act’s disclosure requirements, and (2) the system of records is “maintained by\n\nan agency or component thereof which performs as its principal function any activity pertaining\n\nto the enforcement of criminal laws” and consists of “information compiled for the purpose of a\n\ncriminal investigation.” 5 U.S.C. § 552a(j)(2) (2012); see also Defs.’ 2d Mem. at 13 n.5.\n\n        Plaintiff has not opposed defendants’ assertion of Exemption (j)(2) over any of the\n\nmaterial at issue in this case, so the Court may properly treat defendants’ assertion as conceded.\n\nSee McMillan, 898 F. Supp. 2d at 69, citing Howard, 729 F. Supp. 2d at 87 (“It is well\n\nunderstood in this Circuit that when a plaintiff files an opposition to a motion . . . addressing\n\nonly certain arguments raised by the defendant, a court may treat those arguments that the\n\nplaintiff failed to address as conceded.”). 21\n\n\n\n21      In addition, the Court is satisfied that defendants have met their burden to show that\nExemption j(2) applies to any responsive records covered by the Privacy Act. The Bordley\nDeclaration states that the system of records to which these documents belong assists the USMS\nin effectuating its statutory law enforcement responsibilities. Bordley Decl. ¶ 5. In addition, as\nthe Bordley Declaration notes, federal regulation exempts the relevant systems because 28\nC.F.R. §§ 16.101(a) and (q) identify JUSTICE/USM-007 and JUSTICE/USM-005 as being\nexempt from Privacy Act disclosure provisions. Id.\n\n\n                                                 51\n\f       D.     Plaintiff’s Privacy Act claims with respect to Treasury are barred\n\n       Because, as discussed above, plaintiff has not established that he submitted a request to\n\nTreasury, the Court need not address Treasury’s production obligations under the Privacy Act.\n\n       IV.    Plaintiff’s Remaining Arguments\n\n       Finally, plaintiff sets forth a number of other arguments concerning the adequacy of the\n\nagencies’ searches and productions. None is persuasive.\n\n       First plaintiff argues that the government is operating in bad faith and inappropriately\n\nwithholding exculpatory evidence for his criminal case. Pl.’s 2d Resp. at 26–27. With respect to\n\nthe adequacy of the search, and as the Court has already explained, affidavits attesting to a\n\nreasonable search “are afforded a presumption of good faith,” Defenders of Wildlife, 314 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 8, and “can be rebutted only ‘with evidence that the agency’s search was not made in\n\ngood faith.’” Id., quoting Trans Union LLC, 141 F. Supp. 2d at 69. Plaintiff has come forth with\n\nno evidence of bad faith. Instead, he offers merely conclusory assertions. See Pl.’s 2d Resp. at\n\n26–27. Accordingly, plaintiff’s unsupported argument is unsuccessful.\n\n       Next, plaintiff argues that the Vaughn index produced in this case is “simply smoke and\n\nmirrors” and that defendants should be ordered to produce an adequate Vaughn index.22 Id. at\n\n27–28. Production of a Vaughn index is just one way that an agency can explain its response to a\n\nFOIA request – albeit a common one. In order for a court to pass on the agency’s action, the\n\nagency must submit a “Vaughn index and/or accompanying affidavits or declarations”\n\nspecifically showing why documents were redacted or withheld in full. Defenders of Wildlife v.\n\nU.S. Border Patrol, 623 F. Supp. 2d 83, 88 (D.D.C. 2009).            The Vaughn indices and\n\naccompanying affidavits in this case are sufficient: Both EOUSA and USMS produced Vaughn\n\n\n22    As discussed, defendants produced two Vaughn indices – one for EOUSA and one for\nUSMS.\n                                              52\n\findices that set forth with particularity the documents withheld and the underlying rationales as\n\ndemonstrated by the Court’s ability to rely on them in assessing the government’s justifications\n\nfor its withholdings. See Bordley Decl. ¶ 12; Vaughn Index, Attach. to Luczynski Decl. Neither\n\nBOP nor ATF produced Vaughn indices, but they both produced detailed affidavits. Moreover,\n\nthe Court need not rely on detailed descriptions of those agencies’ withholdings because plaintiff\n\nhas failed to exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to their determinations. See 1st\n\nBoucher Decl.; Mack Decl.\n\n       Finally, there is no need for a Vaughn index for the remaining two agencies: Treasury\n\nand CRM. Treasury need not produce a Vaughn index because it did not receive any request\n\nfrom plaintiff, and the Court will grant summary judgment on that basis. CRM submitted a\n\ndeclaration that described with particularity the sole responsive document that its search\n\nuncovered, the material that was withheld from it, and the basis for its withholdings. See\n\nCunningham Decl.; Gilmore Decl. The agencies, therefore, need not provide additional Vaughn\n\nindices.\n\n       Plaintiff argues that this Court should undertake an in camera inspection of the withheld\n\ndocuments. Pl.’s 2d Resp. at 29. “Congress left the matter of In camera inspection to the\n\ndiscretion of the district court.” Ray v. Turner, 587 F.2d 1187, 1195 (D.C. Cir. 1978). And the\n\ncriterion that courts use to determine whether to exercise that discretion is “[w]hether the district\n\njudge believes that In camera inspection is needed in order to make a responsible de novo\n\ndetermination on the claims of exemption.” Id. At the same time, in camera review is not\n\nrequired in every case and it “is not a substitute for the government’s obligation to justify its\n\nwithholding in publicly available and debatable documents.” PHE, Inc. v. DOJ, 983 F.2d 248,\n\n253 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). There is no reason for the\n\n\n\n                                                 53\n\fCourt to conduct an in camera inspection of the documents about which the agencies made\n\ndisclosure decisions that plaintiff did not appeal to OIP, because the Court’s review of those\n\nagency determinations is barred. And the Court has already found that the Vaughn indices\n\nsubmitted by the parties provide sufficient detail for the Court to assess the agencies’ claims of\n\nexemption on the remaining documents, except for the four EOUSA documents that the Court\n\nhas reviewed.\n\n       Finally, plaintiff argues that this Court’s powers in equity allow it to exercise jurisdiction\n\nfor purposes of deciding the matter.

But he provides no authority for\n\nthe proposition that a federal court can unilaterally expand its own jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 54\n\f                                           CONCLUSION\n\n       For the reasons set forth above, this Court will grant defendants’ first partial motion for\n\nsummary judgment [Dkt. # 15], and will grant in part and deny in part defendants’ second partial\n\nmotion for summary judgment [Dkt. # 22]. The Court will direct defendant EOUSA to produce\n\nportions of four withheld documents, consistent with this Memorandum Opinion. The Court will\n\nalso remand to BOP to review the documents that it received from EOUSA after plaintiff had\n\nalready initiated this action and to either disclose those documents to plaintiff or justify any\n\nwithholdings under FOIA.

Plaintiff’s\n\ncomplaint challenges the responses to written requests that he made to defendants, the Criminal\n\nDivision (“CRM”) of the United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”), the United States\n\nMarshals Service (“USMS”), the Executive Office for United States Attorneys (“EOUSA”), the\n\nFederal Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”), the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives\n\n(“ATF”), and the Department of Treasury (“Treasury”). 1 In each of his requests, plaintiff sought\n\nall records related to himself. All of the defendant agencies except for Treasury responded to\n\nplaintiff’s requests by conducting searches. Many have disclosed some responsive records, and\n\nall have provided reasons for withholding at least some information.\n\n       Defendants have filed two partial motions for summary judgment and dismissal, which\n\ntogether seek to dispose of this action in its entirety. Fed. Defs.’ Partial Mot. for Summ. J. and\n\n\n\n1       Plaintiff also named the Department of Justice and the Parker County Sheriff Department\nas defendants to this action. The Court dismissed the Parker County Sheriff Department from\nthe action by Order of December 12, 2012 [Dkt. # 18].\n\fDismissal [Dkt. # 15] (“Defs.’ 1st Mot.”); Fed. Defs.’ Supp. Mot. for Summ. J. and Dismissal\n\n[Dkt. # 22] (“Defs.’ 2d Mot.”). Plaintiff opposes both motions, challenging the adequacy of the\n\nagencies’ searches and their withholdings. Resp. and Objection to Fed. Defs.’ Partial Mot. for\n\nSumm. J. and Dismissal [Dkt. # 16] (“Pl.’s 1st Resp.”); Pl.’s Verified Mem. Resp. to Fed. Defs.’\n\nSupplemental Mot. for Summ. J. and Dismissal [Dkt. # 25] (“Pl.’s 2d Resp.”). Plaintiff also\n\nchallenges Treasury’s failure to undertake a search. The Court finds that plaintiff has failed to\n\nexhaust his administrative remedies as to some of his claims. As to the others, the Court finds,\n\nbased on affidavits and Vaughn indices submitted by the government, that the agencies\n\nconducted adequate searches for responsive documents, but they have not provided adequate\n\nexplanations for all of their withholdings. Accordingly, the Court will grant in part and deny in\n\npart defendants’ motions for summary judgment. The Court will direct EOUSA to disclose parts\n\nof four documents that it has withheld in full and will remand to BOP to review the documents it\n\nreceived from EOUSA after the commencement of this action.\n\n                                       BACKGROUND\n\n       Plaintiff is currently incarcerated at the Seagoville Federal Correctional Institution in\n\nSeagoville, Texas. Pl.’s 1st Compl. [Dkt. # 1] (“Compl.”) ¶ 1. In July 2010, he pled guilty to\n\none count of possession of an unregistered destructive device, in violation of 26 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 5841, 5861(d), and 5871.    Minute Order, United States v. David Barouch, No. 4:10-CR-\n\n00099-A(01) (N.D. Tex. July 9, 2010) [Dkt. # 27]. In November 2010, he was sentenced in the\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of Northern Texas to 120 months in prison.\n\nJudgment, United State, No. 4:10-CR-00099-A(01) (N.D. Tex.

Ex. 1 to Decl. of John E. Cunningham III (“Cunningham\n\nDecl.”) [Dkt. # 15-3] at 1 (CRM); Attach. 2 to Decl. of Violet Mack (“Mack Decl.”) [Dkt. # 22-\n\n1] at 1 (BOP); Ex. A to Decl. of David Luczynski (“Luczynski Decl.”) [Dkt. # 22-2] at 1\n\n(EOUSA); Ex. A to Decl. of Stephanie M. Boucher (“1st Boucher Decl.”) [Dkt. # 22-3] at 1\n\n(ATF); Ex. A to Decl. of William E. Bordley (“Bordley Decl.”) [Dkt. # 22-4] at 1 (USMS). All\n\nof the documents sought “full disclosure and release of all files, records, data and/or information\n\nmaintained by” each agency under plaintiff’s name. Id. His request included his birthdate, place\n\nof birth, social security number, case numbers for his conviction and appeal, and the district in\n\nwhich he was convicted. Id. In addition, plaintiff maintains that he submitted an identical FOIA\n\nrequest to Treasury. 3 Compl. ¶ 12; see also Aff. of Jack Barouch (“Barouch Aff.”), Ex. A to\n\n[Dkt. # 16], ¶ 1.\n\n   I.      Request to Treasury\n\n        Plaintiff claims that Treasury possesses but has withheld documents responsive to his\n\nrequest. Compl. ¶¶ 5, 22, 25. Defendants claim that Treasury never received a request from\n\nplaintiff. Mem. in Support of Fed. Defs.’ Mot. for Partial Summ. J. and Dismissal [Dkt. # 15-2]\n\n(“Defs.’ 1st Mem.”) at 4. In support of this contention, Treasury has submitted a declaration\n\nfrom Hugh Gilmore, a supervisory program analyst in Disclosure Services, part of Treasury’s\n\nDepartmental Offices, which oversees FOIA compliance for the bureaus of Treasury except for\n\n\n\n2       Defendants assert that plaintiff’s FOIA request directed to ATF was not received until\nAugust 2011.

Declaration of Hugh Gilmore [Dkt. # 15-4] (“Gilmore Decl.”) ¶ 2.\n\nHe states that Treasury has conducted a search of its FOIA tracking system to find any requests\n\nsubmitted under plaintiff’s name, but none were located. Id. ¶ 5.\n\n         The declaration also notes that although plaintiff alleges that ATF is an agency within\n\nTreasury, ATF became part of DOJ in 2003. Id. ¶¶ 6–7; see also Homeland Security Act of\n\n2002, Pub. L. No. 107-206, 116 Stat. 2135; Compl. ¶¶ 5, 6, 22, 25 (referring to ATF as a division\n\nof Treasury).\n\n   II.      Request to CRM\n\n         CRM acknowledged receipt of plaintiff’s request by letter dated May 6, 2011.\n\nCunningham Decl. ¶ 4; see also Ex. 1 to Cunningham Decl. On May 23, 2011, it responded to\n\nthe request. Cunningham Decl. ¶ 7; Ex. 2 to Cunningham Decl. The response directed plaintiff\n\nto send another letter to CRM indicating which section of the agency he wanted to be searched,\n\nand specifying the location and dates of his conviction, arrests, and the federal offenses, and any\n\nother applicable timeframes involved. Ex. 2 to Cunningham Decl. By letter dated June 6, 2011,\n\nplaintiff asked that CRM search the “FOIA/PA Unit,” and he responded to CRM’s other\n\nrequests. Cunningham Decl. ¶ 8; Ex. 3 to Cunningham Decl. On July 6, 2011, CRM sent\n\nplaintiff a letter informing him that no responsive documents had been found. Cunningham\n\nDecl. ¶ 11; Ex. 5 to Cunningham Decl. The letter also explained plaintiff’s right to appeal\n\nCRM’s determination to DOJ’s Office of Information Policy (“OIP”). Ex. 5 to Cunningham\n\nDecl. On July 12, 2011, plaintiff sent a letter to OIP appealing CRM’s decision. Cunningham\n\nDecl. ¶ 13; Ex. 6 to Cunningham Decl. OIP confirmed receipt of plaintiff’s appeal by letter\n\ndated July 27, 2011, and informed plaintiff by letter dated October 11, 2011 that it had\n\n\n\n\n                                                4\n\fdetermined that CRM’s search was adequate.          Cunningham Decl. ¶¶ 14–15; Exs. 7–8 to\n\nCunningham Decl.\n\n          On April 3, 2012, after plaintiff had filed the instant lawsuit, CRM received one\n\npotentially responsive document from EOUSA because EOUSA had determined that the\n\ndocument originated with CRM. Cunningham Decl. ¶ 17; Exs. 9–10 to Cunningham Decl. The\n\ndocument was a July 15, 2005, memorandum (“Richter Memorandum”) from Acting Assistant\n\nAttorney General of CRM, John C. Richter, concerning “[c]harging under 18 U.S.C. 924(c)\n\nwhere the underlying crime of violence is the possession of the same weapon.” Cunningham\n\nDecl. ¶ 19 (internal quotation marks omitted); Ex. 11 to Cunningham Decl. On April 18, CRM\n\ninformed plaintiff by letter that it was withholding the document in part pursuant to 5 U.S.C.\n\n§ 552(b)(5), which permits agencies to withhold from production inter- or intra-agency\n\ndocuments that would not be available in litigation.       Cunningham Decl. ¶ 19; Ex. 11 to\n\nCunningham Decl. This letter also informed plaintiff that he could appeal the decision to OIP.\n\nEx. 11 to Cunningham Decl.\n\n   III.      Request to USMS\n\n          On May 17, 2011, USMS’s Office of General Counsel (“OGC”) received plaintiff’s\n\nrequest. Bordley Decl. ¶ 2; Ex. A to Bordley Decl. By letter dated May 20, OGC acknowledged\n\nreceipt of plaintiff’s letter and informed him that the office had begun its search. Bordley Decl.\n\n¶ 3; Ex. B to Bordley Decl. According to William E. Bordley, who is the Associate General\n\nCounsel and Freedom of Information/Privacy Act Officer for USMS, OGC searched the Prisoner\n\nProcessing and Population Management/Prisoner Tracking System (PPM/PTS), JUSTICE/USM-\n\n005 and the Warrant Information Network (WIN), JUSTICE/USM-007. Bordley Decl. ¶¶ 1, 5.\n\nThese resources comprise the electronic and paper records concerning USMS prisoners and\n\n\n\n                                                5\n\fothers investigated by USMS pursuant to an arrest warrant or other judicial process. Id. ¶ 5.\n\nFollowing a search of these records, OGC identified 28 pages of material indexed to plaintiff’s\n\nname, located in the Northern District of Texas – the relevant location identified by plaintiff in\n\nhis request. Id.; Ex. A to Bordley Decl.\n\n         By letter dated June 21, 2011, OGC informed plaintiff that it was releasing twenty-eight\n\npages of documents to him. Bordley Decl. ¶ 6; Ex. C to Bordley Decl. Of these pages, fifteen\n\nwere released in their entirety, and thirteen were released with redactions pursuant to 5 U.S.C.\n\n§ 552(b)(7)(C) (“Exemption (b)(7)(C)”) and 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(E) (“Exemption (b)(7)(E)”).\n\nBordley Decl. ¶ 6; see also 5 U.S.C. §§ 552(b)(7)(C), (b)(7)(E) (2012). The letter also informed\n\nplaintiff that he could appeal USMS’s determination to OIP. Ex. C to Bordley Decl. Plaintiff\n\nfiled an appeal by letter dated July 1, 2011. Bordley Decl. ¶ 7; Ex. D to Bordley Decl. By letter\n\ndated September 21, 2011, OIP informed plaintiff that it was affirming the decision. Ex. E to\n\nBordley Decl.\n\n         USMS’s Vaughn index describes the information withheld and lists the basis for the\n\nwithholdings. Bordley Decl. ¶¶ 11–12. USMS relied on Exemption (b)(7)(C) to withhold\n\ninformation from twelve pages of the responsive documents. Id. ¶ 12. In each instance, it was\n\ninvoked to excise the name, address, prison identification number, and/or registration number of\n\nthird parties, government employees, law enforcement officers, USMS employees and/or other\n\nprisoners. Id. USMS also withheld the secure website address from one page also pursuant to\n\nExemption (b)(7)(E). Id.\n\n   IV.      Request to ATF\n\n         According to a declaration by the Chief of ATF’s Disclosure Division, Stephanie M.\n\nBoucher, the agency received a letter from plaintiff on August 1, 2011, that was dated July 20,\n\n\n\n                                                6\n\f2011. 1st Boucher Decl. ¶¶ 1, 3. The letter indicated that plaintiff had filed a formal FOIA\n\nrequest more than thirty days prior but had not received a response. Ex. A to 1st Boucher Decl.\n\nEnclosed along with the letter was a copy of a request written by plaintiff under FOIA and the\n\nPrivacy Act, dated April 26, 2011, as well as two attachments to the request. Id. The first\n\nattachment is a document stating that the request includes investigative records in the possession\n\nof the Colleybille [sic], Keller, and Fort Worth Police Departments, which – according to the\n\nattachment – operated as sub-agents for ATF in plaintiff’s criminal case. Id. The second\n\nattachment is a document stating that the request includes (1) a microcassette recording of an\n\nOctober 2010 interview of plaintiff by ATF Agent Riddle with plaintiff’s then-counsel Mic\n\nMickelson, (2) a tape recording of a November 2010 interview with an inmate that was\n\nconducted by ATF Agent Riddle and an unnamed Texas Ranger, and was attended by plaintiff,\n\nand (3) a videotape recording of plaintiff purchasing two salad bowls from Bed, Bath, and\n\nBeyond in roughly April or May of 2010. Id. By letter dated August 2, 2011, ATF responded to\n\nplaintiff to inform him that ATF had received and would process his FOIA request dated August\n\n1, but that it had not previously received a request from him. 1st Boucher Decl. ¶ 4; Ex. B to 1st\n\nBoucher Decl.\n\n       According to the Boucher declaration, the Disclosure Division concluded that release of\n\nthe records sought could reasonably be expected to interfere with ongoing law enforcement\n\nproceedings. 1st Boucher Decl. ¶ 5. Accordingly, by letter of August 3, 2011, ATF denied\n\nplaintiff’s request pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(A) (“Exemption (b)(7)(A)”). 1st Boucher\n\nDecl. ¶ 5; Ex. C to 1st Boucher Decl.; see also 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(A) (2012). The denial left\n\nopen the option for ATF to invoke additional exemptions to support withholdings in the future.\n\n1st Boucher Decl. ¶ 5; Ex. C to 1st Boucher Decl. The letter also informed plaintiff that he could\n\n\n\n                                                7\n\fappeal the denial to OIP. 1st Boucher Decl. ¶ 5; Ex. C to 1st Boucher Decl. After August 3,\n\n2011, ATF notified plaintiff of that because his appeal from his criminal case had concluded, the\n\nagency intended to release documents that had been previously withheld. Decl. of Stephanie M.\n\nBoucher [Dkt. # 26-1] ¶ 3.\n\n         According to Boucher, her staff contacted OIP after plaintiff filed the complaint in the\n\ninstant case to determine whether plaintiff had filed an administrative appeal of ATF’s actions.\n\n1st Boucher Decl. ¶ 8. OIP informed Boucher’s staff that it had no records of an appeal from\n\nplaintiff. Id.\n\n         In addition, on April 10, 2012, ATF received potentially responsive documents from\n\nEOUSA because EOUSA had determined that the documents originated with ATF. 1st Boucher\n\nDecl. ¶ 6; Ex. D to 1st Boucher Decl. By letter dated April 12, 2012, ATF notified plaintiff that\n\nit was partially withholding the documents under Exemption (b)(7)(C). 1st Boucher Decl. ¶ 7;\n\nEx. E to 1st Boucher Decl.\n\n    V.      Request to BOP\n\n         By letter dated April 26, 2011, plaintiff submitted a Privacy Act/FOIA request to BOP.\n\nMack Decl. ¶ 4; Attach. 2 to Mack Decl. The letter was directed to BOP’s Office of General\n\nCounsel FOIA/PA Section and was received by that office on May 17, 2011. Mack Decl. ¶ 4;\n\nAttach. 2 to Mack Decl. According to BOP Paralegal Specialist Violate Mack, the FOIA/PA\n\nSection staff determined that the appropriate location for plaintiff’s search request was BOP’s\n\nSouth Central Region. Mack Decl. ¶ 5. Accordingly, on May 27, 2011, FOIA/PA Section staff\n\nuploaded the request letter into Metastorm BPM – the Bureau’s FOIA database – for processing\n\nby the SCRO Regional Counsel’s Office. Id. According to Mack, the now-retired SCRO\n\nParalegal Specialist, Larry Collins, determined that the form of plaintiff’s request was typical of\n\n\n\n                                                8\n\fforms used by inmates at particular institutions, except that plaintiff had also appended an\n\nadditional page specifying in more detail the materials he sought. Id. ¶ 6; Attach. 2 to Mack\n\nDecl. Those specific materials were: “[t]elephonic recordings or transcript[s] of telephonic\n\nrecordings” from (a) the Parker County detention center from May 1, 2010 through July 15,\n\n2010; (b) FDC Fort Worth from July 1, 2010 through November 1, 2010; and (c) FCI Seagoville\n\nfrom October 28, 2010 to present, as well as any Parker County Detention Center or FDC Fort\n\nWorth inmate files concerning plaintiff not currently in the central file at Seagoville. Attach. 2 to\n\nMack Decl.\n\n        On August 14, 2011, BOP’s Office of General Counsel, Freedom of Information\n\ndivision received another letter from plaintiff. Mack Decl. ¶ 14. This letter contained (1) a letter\n\nfrom plaintiff to the BOP FOIA section, dated July 20, 2011, requesting an update on the status\n\nof his April 26, 2011 FOIA request to the BOP Office of Central Counsel FOIA/PA Section,\n\nwith a copy of the April 26 request attached, (2) a letter dated July 27, 2011, from BOP Legal\n\nInstruments Examiner Paula Champion, indicating that she had received a letter from plaintiff\n\nrequesting records maintained by BOP at the Federal Correctional Institution, Fort Worth, Texas,\n\nand informing plaintiff that if his request was intended to be filed under the Privacy and Freedom\n\nof Information Acts, it should be sent to BOP’s Office of General Counsel, Freedom of\n\nInformation Division, and (3) a FOIA request by plaintiff, identical to the April 26, 2011 request,\n\nbut addressed to the Office of General Counsel, Freedom of Information, Bureau of Prisons\n\nCentral Office and dated July 30, 2011. Mack Decl. ¶ 14; Attach. 5 to Mack Decl.\n\n        According to Mack, Collins e-mailed FCI Fort Worth’s staff on June 7, 2011, requesting\n\ndocuments responsive to plaintiff’s request. Mack Decl. ¶ 7. In his email, Collins noted that\n\nplaintiff had been a “holdover” inmate – that is, a BOP inmate not yet transferred to his\n\n\n\n                                                 9\n\fdesignated institution – at Fort Worth, and that he was specifically requesting all recorded\n\ntelephone calls from Fort Worth during the specified timeframe. Id. & n.2. Collins also sent an\n\ne-mail on June 7, 2011 to FCI Seagoville’s Legal Liaison requesting responsive records,\n\nspecifically including recorded telephone calls for the requested period and any available\n\ntelephone transactional data concerning plaintiff. Id. ¶ 8. 4\n\n          The Mack declarations states that because the content of plaintiff’s FOIA letter was the\n\nsame or similar to letters that BOP receives frequently from other inmates, BOP interpreted the\n\nletter as a “form letter” rather than a request for all documents maintained in the central and\n\nmedical files of the requesting inmate. Id. ¶ 11 & n.5. To determine the scope of plaintiff’s\n\nrequest, BOP looked to the more specific requests delineated in the attachments to plaintiff’s\n\nletter.   Id. ¶ 11.   Since the requests described in the attachments were limited to records\n\nmaintained by the Parker County Detention Center and FCI Fort Worth that would not be found\n\nin plaintiff’s central file maintained at FCI Seagoville, BOP determined that the scope of\n\nplaintiff’s request did not extend to all documents in his central file. Id. And since the requests\n\nwere unrelated to any records that would be maintained in plaintiff’s medical file, BOP\n\ndetermined that the scope did not extend to all documents in his medical file. Id.\n\n          According to Mack, on June 8, 2011, FCI Fort Worth staff sent Collins the transactional\n\ndata from plaintiff’s use of the Inmate Telephone System (“ITS”) but informed him that it had\n\nfound no recorded telephone conversations and no detainee files. Mack Decl. ¶ 12. On June 16,\n\n2011, FCI Seagoville staff informed Collins that it would forward a CD containing a copy of the\n\ntransactional data for plaintiff’s ITS usage. Id. ¶ 13. The CD also contained recorded telephone\n\nconversations. Id.\n\n\n4        No similar request was made to the Parker County Detention Center as it is not a BOP\nfacility.

Mack Decl. ¶ 15; Attach 6 to Mack Decl. The letter indicated the following:\n\n           Parker County Detention Center records are not subject to FOIA requests and not\n           within BOP’s jurisdiction.\n\n           BOP located no detainee file concerning plaintiff at FCI Fort Worth.\n\n           In consideration of the specific requests noted in the attachments to plaintiff’s\n           request letter, BOP declined to interpret the scope of the request as including all\n           documents in the central and medical files; however, plaintiff was invited to provide\n           BOP with a clearer description of the records sought.\n\n           BOP’s search turned up 113 recorded telephone conversations from FCI Seagoville\n           between the dates of December 18, 2010 and June 6, 2011.\n\n           No recorded telephone conversations were found at FCI Fort Worth.\n\n           Recorded telephone conversations are maintained on the TRUFONE system for 180\n           days, after which they are automatically deleted.\n\n           Recorded telephone conversations cannot be released without consent from all\n           recorded parties and are, therefore, exempt from disclosure under 5 U.S.C.\n           §§ 552(b)(6) and (b)(7)(C).\n\n           Sixteen pages of telephone transactional data were released to plaintiff.\n\n           Plaintiff could appeal BOP’s response to his request by filing a written appeal with\n           OIP.\n\nMack Decl. ¶ 15; Attach. 6 to Mack Decl.\n\n       By letter dated September 29, 2011, plaintiff requested preservation of the telephone\n\nconversations identified in BOP’s response.

Request to EOUSA\n\n         On May 17, 2011, EOUSA received a letter from plaintiff requesting, pursuant to the\n\nPrivacy Act and FOIA, copies of “all files, records, data, and/or information” maintained by\n\nEOUSA under the name David Barouch. 5 Luczynski Decl. ¶ 4; Ex. A to Luczynski Decl. On\n\nMay 31, 2011, EOUSA acknowledged receipt of plaintiff’s letter. Luczynski Decl. ¶ 5; Ex. B to\n\nLuczynski Decl. EOUSA’s letter informed plaintiff that, although the agency attempted to\n\nprocess most requests within twenty days, “Project Requests” – including requests about oneself\n\nin criminal case files – usually took about nine months. Ex. B to Luczynski Decl.\n\n         According to David Luczynski, an EOUSA attorney advisor who, among other things,\n\nreviews FOIA and Privacy Act requests submitted to EOUSA and prepares responses, EOUSA\n\nbegan its search in the Northern District of Texas, which was specified as the pertinent location\n\nin plaintiff’s initial inquiry. Luczynski Decl. ¶¶ 1, 8; Ex. A to Luczynski Decl. EOUSA’s search\n\ninvolved reviewing the records from plaintiff’s case, sending email requests for responsive\n\ndocuments to the Assistant United States Attorney in the Criminal Division, and searching the\n\n\n5       Although the affidavit submitted in support of EOUSA’s motion to dismiss repeatedly\nrefers to plaintiff’s letter as a “FOIA request,” the letter cites both FOIA and the Privacy Act as\nthe bases for plaintiff’s request.

Luczynski Decl. ¶ 8\n\n       By letter dated March 26, 2012 – after the initiation of this case – EOUSA responded to\n\nplaintiff, indicating that it had identified relevant documents and was releasing 159 pages in full,\n\nreleasing 50 pages in part, and withholding 282 pages in full. Compl. at 1; Luczynski Decl. ¶ 6;\n\nEx. C to Luczynski Decl. The letter informed plaintiff that documents were withheld from\n\nproduction under the FOIA exemptions codified at 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(3) (“Exemption (b)(3)”), 5\n\nU.S.C. § 552(b)(5) (“Exemption (b)(5)”), 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(6) (“Exemption (b)(6)”), and\n\nExemption (b)(7)(C), and under the Privacy Act exemption codified at 5 U.S.C. § 552a(j)(2)\n\n(“Exemption (j)(2)”). Luczynski Decl. ¶ 6. Ex. C to Luczynski Decl.; see also Vaughn Index,\n\nAttach. to Luczynski Decl.       The letter also informed plaintiff that additional potentially\n\nresponsive documents were being referred to ATF, CRM, and BOP. Luczynski Decl. ¶ 6; Ex. C\n\nto Luczynski Decl.

Procedural Background\n\n       Plaintiff, acting pro se, filed the complaint in this action on January 23, 2012, against\n\nDOJ, USMS, the DOJ Criminal Division, EOUSA, BOP, Treasury, ATF, and the Parker County\n\nSheriff Department. Compl. at 1. The complaint alleges that the named defendants have “failed,\n\nrefused, and neglected to comply with Plaintiff’s reasonable requests for records, documents,\n\naudio tapes and jail tape recordings, and discovery.” Compl. ¶ 15. Plaintiff seeks an order\n\ncompelling disclosure of his “entire record of investigation” for the years 2010 and 2011.\n\nCompl. ¶ 17.     On December 12, 2012, the Court dismissed the Parker County Sheriff\n\n\n\n\n                                                13\n\fDepartment, sua sponte, because the local entity is not subject to the provisions of FOIA.

Id. ¶ 5.\n\n       Plaintiff has failed to produce any evidence that he submitted a FOIA or Privacy Act\n\nrequest to Treasury, let alone provide a copy of the request itself to the Court. Moreover,\n\nplaintiff has continually wrongly characterized ATF as a bureau of Treasury, Compl. ¶¶ 5–6, 22,\n\n25, which suggests that he may have been under the impression that he was seeking records from\n\nTreasury when he submitted his request to ATF. Because there is no genuine dispute that no\n\ndocuments were produced to plaintiff by Treasury because Treasury did not receive a FOIA\n\nrequest from him, Gilmore Decl. ¶¶ 4–5, the Court will grant Treasury’s motion for summary\n\njudgment.\n\n       II.     The Court will grant in part and deny in part defendants’ motions for\n               summary judgment with respect to plaintiff’s claims arising under FOIA\n\n       The purpose of FOIA is to require the release of government records upon request and to\n\n“ensure an informed citizenry, vital to the functioning of a democratic society, needed to check\n\n\n\n6       Treasury also moves on these grounds under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).\nDefs.’ 1st Mem. at 4.

ATF claims that plaintiff has failed to exhaust the\n\navailable administrative remedies under FOIA without distinguishing between these two\n\ndifferent determinations. Defs.’ 2d Mem. at 4–5. Because plaintiff has not appealed either of\n\nthese decisions to OIP, ATF maintains, judicial review of its decisions is unavailable. Defs.’ 2d\n\nMem. at 5. For his part, plaintiff maintains that “it would be futile to undergo the deliberative\n\nand fruitless delay of further administrative review.” Pl.’s 2d Resp. at 36. The Court will\n\naddress each of ATF’s decisions separately.\n\n                      a. Plaintiff’s claim with respect to ATF’s August 3, 2011 decision is\n                         barred\n\n       With respect to the first set of documents, the Court agrees with ATF that plaintiff’s\n\nclaim under FOIA is barred for failure to exhaust his administrative remedies. When plaintiff\n\nreceived notification – in the letter dated August 3, 2011 – that his initial request to ATF had\n\nbeen denied, he was notified that he could appeal the decision to OIP. Ex. C to 1st Boucher\n\nDecl. Plaintiff did not do so. 1st Boucher Decl. ¶ 8.\n\n       Plaintiff is correct that in certain contexts, “the exhaustion requirement may be waived by\n\nthe agency, or disregarded by the court when application of the doctrine would be futile.” Cutler\n\nv.

Cir. 1993).\n\n        Therefore, with respect to ATF’s August 3, 2011 determination, defendants’ motion to\n\ndismiss, construed as a motion for summary judgment, will be granted.\n\n                       b. Plaintiff’s failure to file an administrative appeal of ATF’s\n                          determination under FOIA with respect to the documents referred to it\n                          by the EOUSA does not bar this Court’s review of the merits of the\n                          determination\n\n        The Court, however, finds a distinction between the challenges to ATF’s determination\n\nregarding the documents that ATF uncovered in its initial search and the determination on the\n\ndocuments referred to ATF by EOUSA after the initiation of this action. Plaintiff was first\n\ninformed of his right to appeal ATF’s decision regarding the documents referred to it by EOUSA\n\nby letter dated April 12, 2012, after plaintiff had already filed his complaint in this Court. Ex. E\n\nto 1st Boucher Decl. In other words, when plaintiff filed the instant lawsuit, there was no\n\nadministrative remedy available for plaintiff to exhaust regarding these documents.             See\n\nLuczynski Decl. ¶ 6 (showing EOUSA referred documents to ATF after plaintiff filed suit).\n\n        It is true that plaintiff did not exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to these\n\ndocuments in a literal sense. But a FOIA requester will be deemed to have “constructively\n\nexhausted” his administrative remedies “if the agency fails to comply with the applicable time\n\nlimit provisions.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(C)(i). The documents processed by ATF were actually\n\nin the possession of EOUSA, which had not responded to plaintiff’s request when plaintiff filed\n\nhis complaint in this action, despite the expiration of the applicable time limit for the agency to\n\nrespond. See, e.g., Oglesby, 920 F.2d at 65–66. EOUSA concedes this. Defs.’ 2d Mem. at 17\n\nn.8.   It would be anomalous to review plaintiff’s challenges to EOUSA’s withholdings of\n\n                                                21\n\fdocuments that were identified by EOUSA in the spring of 2012 and that were processed by\n\nEOUSA, but to decline review on exhaustion grounds the determinations of other agencies to\n\nwhich EOUSA sent some of the documents it identified at the same time. Compare Defs.’ 2d\n\nMem. at 17 n.8 (conceding administrative remedies were constructively exhausted) with 1st\n\nBoucher Decl. ¶ 8 (asserting that plaintiff has failed to exhaust his administrative remedies with\n\nrespect to his ATF request). Since the exhaustion requirement under FOIA is not jurisdictional,\n\nHidalgo, 344 F.3d at 1258, the Court finds that plaintiff has constructively exhausted his\n\nadministrative remedies with respect to the documents uncovered by EOUSA after the initiation\n\nof this action, regardless of whether they were processed by EOUSA or by another agency, such\n\nas ATF. Accordingly, the Court finds that plaintiff’s challenge to ATF’s determination on the\n\ndocuments it received from EOUSA is not barred for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.\n\n               3.      BOP\n\n                       a. The Court is barred from reviewing plaintiff’s challenge to BOP’s\n                          August 31, 2011 determination because plaintiff failed to exhaust his\n                          administrative remedies with respect to that determination\n\n       BOP argues that plaintiff is barred from seeking judicial review of BOP’s response to his\n\nFOIA request because he failed to exhaust all administrative remedies before filing the instant\n\nsuit. Defs.’ 2d Mem. at 9. Plaintiff argues that any further administrative review would be\n\n“futile.” Pl.’s 2d Resp. at 36.\n\n       With respect at least to the documents that were the subject of BOP’s August 31, 2011\n\nletter, plaintiff’s request differs little in relevant respects from his request to ATF: Plaintiff was\n\ninformed on August 31, 2011, that certain documents were being released to plaintiff, that others\n\nwere being withheld, and that he was entitled to an administrative appeal. Mack Decl. ¶ 15;\n\nAttach. 6 to Mack Decl. In addition, the letter informed plaintiff that he might obtain additional\n\n\n\n                                                 22\n\fdocuments by specifying that he also sought the records located in his central and medical files.\n\nMack Decl. ¶ 15; Attach. 6 to Mack Decl. Plaintiff responded to BOP on September 29, 2011,\n\nbut he did not file an administrative appeal with OIP. Mack Decl. ¶¶ 16, 20; Attach. 7 to Mack\n\nDecl.; Attach. 9 to Mack Decl. Plaintiff’s conclusory characterization of further administrative\n\nreview as “futile” is insufficient to overcome the rule that exhaustion of administrative remedies\n\nis a prerequisite to judicial review in this context for the same reasons that the Court discussed\n\nwith respect to ATF. Accordingly, the Court is barred from reviewing plaintiff’s challenge to\n\nBOP’s August 31, 2011 determination.\n\n                      b. BOP must identify which documents were referred to it by EOUSA\n                         and produce them or explain its basis for withholding them\n\n       Defendants argue that that plaintiff’s challenge to BOP’s withholding of the documents\n\nreferred to it by EOUSA after the initiation of this action is also barred because he failed to\n\nexhaust his administrative remedies. Defs.’ 2d Mem. at 17 n.7. The Court finds for the same\n\nreasons discussed above with respect to ATF that plaintiff has constructively exhausted his\n\nadministrative remedies, and the Court may therefore address the merits of his claim.\n\n       Moreover, BOP has yet to produce to plaintiff the documents referred to it by EOUSA or\n\nto explain the basis for its withholdings. See generally Mack Decl. (making no reference to\n\ndocuments referred to it by EOUSA). Consequently, plaintiff has not received any determination\n\non the referred documents, despite the fact that he had constructively exhausted his\n\nadministrative remedies. See Oglesby, 920 F.2d at 70–71. Accordingly, the Court will remand\n\nto BOP with the direction that it either produce the documents referred to it by EOUSA to\n\nplaintiff or justify any withholdings. The FOIA claims that remain, then, are against CRM,\n\nUSMS, EOUSA, and ATF for its handling of records transmitted to it by EOUSA.\n\n\n\n\n                                               23\n\f       B.      The agencies’ searches were adequate\n\n       In pursuing those claims, plaintiff challenges the adequacy of the agencies’ searches. 8\n\nCompl. ¶ 15; Pl.’s 1st Resp. at 3; Pl.’s 2d Resp. at 8–13. The Court finds that each of these\n\nagencies’ searches was adequate.\n\n       To prevail in a FOIA case, the agency must demonstrate that it has made “a good faith\n\neffort to conduct a search for the requested records, using methods which can be reasonably\n\nexpected to produce the information requested.” Ogelsby, 920 F.2d at 68. “[A]t the summary\n\njudgment phase, an agency must set forth sufficient information in its affidavits for a court to\n\ndetermine if the search was adequate.” Nation Magazine, Wash.

CRM\n\n       CRM maintains that it conducted an adequate search for records responsive to plaintiff’s\n\nrequest that was reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents. Defs.’ Reply at 4.\n\n\n\n\n8       Defendants argue that plaintiff waived any challenge to CRM’s search by not raising the\nissue in his opposition to first dispositive motion. Defs.’ Reply at 5. As discussed, where, as\nhere, a plaintiff appears pro se, “the Court must take particular care to construe the plaintiff's\nfilings liberally, for such complaints are held ‘to less stringent standards than formal pleadings\ndrafted by lawyers.’” Cheeks, 722 F. Supp. 2d at 107, quoting Haines, 404 U.S. at 520–21. The\nCourt will construe plaintiff’s assertion in his opposition to the original dispositive motion that to\ndate, “defendants continue to hide, suppress, and otherwise fail to identify” responsive records as\nan objection to the adequacy of defendants’ search. Pl.’s 1st Resp. at 3 (emphasis added).\n\n                                                 24\n\fPlaintiff disputes this assertion, in part contending that defendants’ failure to locate the three\n\nmissing audiotapes demonstrates the inadequacy of the search. Pl.’s 2d Resp. at 10–11.\n\n       To show that CRM performed adequate searches for responsive records, defendants\n\nsubmitted a declaration by John Cunningham III – a Trial Attorney in the CRM currently\n\nassigned to the FOIA and Privacy Act Unit.          Cunningham Decl. ¶ 1.      The Cunningham\n\ndeclaration states that, as a general practice, CRM searches its Central Criminal Division Index\n\nFile (“CRM-001”) in response to FOIA requests. Id. ¶ 9. The declaration further states that\n\nCRM searched CRM-001 as well as the CRM oracle menu – the Case Automated Tracking\n\nSystem (“CATS”). Id. ¶ 10. CRM used plaintiff’s name as a search term. Ex. 4 to Cunningham\n\nDecl. In addition, since plaintiff had indicated in his submission of materials to CRM that the\n\nsection of CRM that he reasonably believed might contain responsive records was the FOIA and\n\nPrivacy Act Unit of the Office of Enforcement Operations, CRM specifically searched that unit’s\n\nrecords. Cunningham Decl. ¶ 9; Ex. 3 to Cunningham Decl. The Cunningham declaration also\n\nindicates that it is common for CRM to find no records responsive to a federal inmate’s Privacy\n\nAct request because most federal criminal cases are prosecuted by EOUSA. Cunningham Decl.\n\n¶ 12. This affidavit therefore establishes that CRM searched the databases that were likely to\n\nturn up documents responsive to plaintiff’s requests using search terms that correspond to the\n\nscope of the requests.\n\n       Plaintiff specifically challenges CRM’s search on the basis that after informing him that\n\nit had found no responsive documents, it later “admitted” the existence of one document that had\n\noriginated with CRM. Pl.’s Sur-Resp. to Def.’s 1st Mot. at 1. Plaintiff appears to be referring to\n\nthe document that EOUSA referred to CRM after the inception of this action. The fact that\n\nEOUSA referred a document to CRM that it determined “may or may not be responsive” to\n\n\n\n                                               25\n\fplaintiff’s request does not make CRM’s search inadequate. See Ex. 9 to Cunningham Decl.\n\nFirst, it was EOUSA that uncovered the document in its files, not CRM. But even if CRM had\n\nuncovered additional documents after its initial search, “the mere fact that additional documents\n\nhave been discovered does not impugn the accuracy of the [agency] affidavits. The issue [is] not\n\nwhether any further documents might conceivably exist but whether [the agency]’s search for\n\nresponsive documents was adequate.” Goland v.

Cir. 1983). 9\n\n                2.     USMS\n\n       The Court similarly finds that USMS conducted an adequate search. Defendants have\n\nsubmitted   a    declaration   by   USMS     Associate    General    Counsel    and   Freedom     of\n\nInformation/Privacy Act Officer Bordley. Bordley Decl. ¶ 1. The Bordley declaration states that\n\nOGC searched the systems of records routinely searched for documents concerning prisoners for\n\ndocuments relating to plaintiff. Id. ¶¶ 4–5. OGC used plaintiff’s name as well as other personal\n\nidentifying information to identify documents indexed to him. Id. ¶ 4. The other personal\n\nidentifiers submitted to OGC included plaintiff’s date of birth, place of birth, social security\n\nnumber and information concerning his criminal case. Ex. A to Bordley Decl. USMS conducts\n\nsearches using the requestor’s name and/or other identifying information, often his prisoner\n\n\n9       In opposing the motion, plaintiff argues that summary judgment is ill advised prior to the\ntendering of a Vaughn index and the Court’s in camera inspection of the documents and records,\nparticularly three audio cassette tapes plaintiff alleges exist. Pl.'s 1st Resp. ¶ 9. Since plaintiff\nasserts the same arguments in a subsequent filing with respect to the defendants generally, see\nPl.’s 2d Resp. at 27–30, the Court will address these arguments altogether at the end of this\nMemorandum Opinion.\n\n                                                 26\n\fregistration number or social security number. Bordley Decl. ¶ 5. In addition, plaintiff identified\n\nthe Northern District of Texas as the location to be searched, and OGC confirmed that this was\n\nthe location where USMS would reasonably expect to find responsive documents. Bordley Decl.\n\n¶ 4; Ex. A to Bordley Decl.        USMS’s search located twenty-eight pages of responsive\n\ndocuments, and USMS produced those pages to plaintiff with some limited redactions. Bordley\n\nDecl. ¶ 6. In light of these facts, this Court finds, on the basis of Bordley’s affidavit, that the\n\nsearch was “reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents.” Weisberg, 705 F.2d at\n\n1351.\n\n               3.     EOUSA\n\n        Finally, the Court also finds that EOUSA conducted an adequate search. The Luczynski\n\ndeclaration states that, upon receiving plaintiff’s request, EOUSA requested that the United\n\nStates Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Texas search and forward responsive\n\ndocuments. Luczynski Decl. ¶ 8. The FOIA contact for the Northern District of Texas searched\n\nfor records from the case files of plaintiff’s criminal case, and sent e-mails to the Assistant\n\nUnited States Attorneys in the Criminal Division to ascertain whether they had any responsive\n\nrecords. Id. To search for files, the FOIA contact used the “LIONS” system, which is a\n\ncomputer system used by United States Attorneys’ Offices to access databases which can be used\n\nto retrieve files pertaining to cases and investigations based on a defendant’s name, the internal\n\nadministrative number for the case, and the district court case number. Id. The FOIA contact\n\nused plaintiff’s name as the search term. Id. According to the declarant, “[a]ll responsive\n\ndocuments to Plaintiff’s FOIA request would have been located in the [United States Attorney’s\n\nOffice for the Northern District of Texas]. There are no other records systems or locations\n\nwithin EOUSA or DOJ in which other files pertaining to Plaintiff’s name were maintained.” Id.\n\n\n\n                                                27\n\fThese affidavits establish that the agencies searched the databases that were likely to turn up\n\ndocuments responsive to plaintiff’s requests using search terms that correspond to the scope of\n\nthe requests. Plaintiff has not presented any evidence of bad faith on the part of the government.\n\nThe Court therefore finds, on the basis of defendants’ affidavits, that the searches were\n\n“reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents.” Weisberg, 705 F.2d at 1351.\n\n       Plaintiff argues that the searches performed by the DOJ subsections and by EOUSA were\n\ninadequate because they failed to turn up three responsive audio tapes that are in the agencies’\n\npossession. Pl.’s 2d Resp. at 11. But, “the mere fact that additional documents have been\n\ndiscovered does not impugn the accuracy of the [agency] affidavits.

Moreover, courts in this Circuit have\n\nconsistently held that where an individual seeks law enforcement records that implicate the\n\nprivacy interests of a third party, the requester bears the burden of asserting the public interest at\n\nplay.

Defs.’ 2d Mem. at\n\n14–15. Rather, according to defendants, disclosure would allow the individuals whose names\n\nand other personal information were redacted, to be subjected to unwarranted attention,\n\nharassment, and other threats.

He also alleges that the documents will reveal\n\nexculpatory and/or mitigating statements that will reveal his innocence in regards to the criminal\n\noffense for which he was convicted, as well as his role in securing the criminal conviction of\n\nanother individual for murder. See id. at 15, 22. But he fails to explain how identifying\n\ninformation of third parties – the only withheld information – could be exculpatory and/or\n\nmitigating. Moreover, the interest in revealing exculpatory information about one individual’s\n\ncriminal case is not the type of public interest protected by FOIA because it would “reveal[] little\n\nor nothing about an agency’s own conduct.” Reporters Comm., 489 U.S. at 773. “That the\n\n[agency]’s denial of his FOIA requests may hinder his efforts to challenge his conviction or\n\n\n\n                                                 38\n\fsentence . . . is irrelevant.” Pugh v.

Because plaintiff has\n\nnot identified any public interest that would overcome the privacy interest protected by\n\nExemption (b)(7)(C), the Court finds that USMS’s withholdings were proper. The Court also\n\nnotes that the limited scope of the redactions made by USMS under Exemption (b)(7)(C) –\n\nwhich includes only the names, addresses, and other identifying information of third parties,\n\nBordley Decl. ¶ 12 – satisfies the Court that USMS has met its burden to release all reasonably\n\nsegregable material.\n\n               3.

As the Court already explained in detail in its\n\ndiscussion of USMS’s reliance on Exemption (b)(7)(C), an agency may “redact the names,\n\naddresses, or other identifiers of individuals mentioned in investigatory files in order to protect\n\nthe privacy of those persons.” Nation Magazine, 71 F.3d at 896. Thus, ATF identified an\n\nadequate privacy interest in the information it has withheld.\n\n       Plaintiff advances the same alleged public interests in disclosing the information ATF has\n\nwithheld under Exemption (b)(7)(C) that he advanced with respect to the information USMS has\n\nwithheld. Pl.’s 2d Resp. at 14–15. The Court finds them unavailing for the reasons already\n\ndiscussed.   Accordingly, the Court finds that defendants properly relied upon Exemption\n\n(b)(7)(C) to withhold the disputed information. Boyd, 475 F.3d at 387. In addition, the limited\n\nscope of the redactions made by ATF under Exemption (b)(7)(C) – which includes only the\n\nnames and other identifying information of third parties, 1st Boucher Decl. ¶ 7 – satisfies the\n\nCourt that ATF has met its burden to release all reasonably segregable material.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 40\n\f                  4.

Luczynski Decl. ¶¶ 16–17.\n\nAs explained above with regards to the records that CRM has withheld under this exemption,\n\nExemption (b)(5) allows agencies to withhold from production inter- or intra-agency documents\n\nthat would not be available in litigation. 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(5). As with CRM’s invocation of\n\nthis exemption, there is no dispute that the EOUSA is a government agency; therefore, the\n\nrelevant question is whether the documents withheld “fall within the ambit of a privilege against\n\ndiscovery under judicial standards that would govern litigation against the agency that holds it.”\n\nKlamath, 532 U.S. at 8. Like CRM, EOUSA identifies two such privileges: (1) the attorney\n\nwork product doctrine and (2) the deliberative process privilege. Luczynski Decl. ¶ 17. Because\n\nthe Court finds that the attorney work product doctrine covers EOUSA’s withholdings, the Court\n\nneed not address the deliberative process privilege.\n\n       As explained above, the attorney work product doctrine permits the withholding of\n\nmaterial that is “prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial. . . .” Judicial Watch, 432 F.3d\n\nat 369, quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 26 (b)(3).

With respect to each of these documents, the Vaughn index states that “[n]o page\n\nwas determined segregable after a review for segregability.” Vaughn Index, Attach. to Luczynski\n\nDecl. However, this statement does not provide enough information for the Court to determine\n\nwhether the document contains disclosable portions that are not “inextricably intertwined” with\n\nthe identifying information that is properly withheld under Exemption (b)(7)(C). Wilderness\n\nSoc’y, 344 F. Supp. 2d at 18.\n\n          Accordingly, on July 25, 2013, the Court ordered defendants to deliver those four\n\ndocuments to chambers for in camera inspection in order to assist the Court in making a\n\n\n\n                                               45\n\fresponsible de novo determination. Minute Order (July 25, 2013). The Court has now reviewed\n\nthose documents and finds that all four of them contain portions that are not inextricably\n\nintertwined with identifying information about third parties, witnesses, and law enforcement\n\npersonnel. On that basis, the Court will order EOUSA to disclose the following portions of those\n\ndocuments, which the Court has determined are segregable: 17\n\n           From EOUSA Document 4: Page two of the record, except the names and fax\n           numbers that appear in the header on that page.\n\n           From EOUSA Document 7: All nine pages of the record, except: (1) the name and\n           address of the addressee that appears on pages one and six of the record; (2) the name\n           of the U.S. Probation Officer that appears on pages two and seven of the record; and\n           (3) the name and title of the individual copied on the correspondence that appears on\n           pages two and seven of the record.\n\n           From EOUSA Document 8: All eleven pages of the record, except: (1) the name of\n           the Special Agent, which appears throughout the record; (2) the initials that appear\n           throughout the record to identify a particular individual; (3) paragraph twelve on page\n           four of the record; (4) the second, third, and fourth sentences of paragraph thirteen on\n           page five of the record; and (5) paragraph sixteen on page five of the record; (6)\n           paragraph two on page nine of the record; (7) the second, third, and fourth sentences\n           of paragraph three on pages nine to ten of the record; (8) paragraph six on page ten of\n           the record; and (9) the name of the individual, identified as an employee of the Texas\n           Department of Public Safety Crime Lab, that appears in paragraph twelve on page\n           eleven of the record.\n\n           From EOUSA Document 9: All eight pages of the record, except: (1) the name of\n           the Special Agent, which appears throughout the record; (2) the initials that appear\n           throughout the record to identify a particular individual; (3) paragraph one on page\n           one of the record; (4) the second, third, and fourth sentences of paragraph two on\n           page two of the record; (5) paragraph five on page two of the record; (6) paragraph\n\n\n17      The Court notes that although Document Number 9 is described in EOUSA’s Vaughn\nIndex as a draft of a criminal complaint, defendants have not asserted Exemption (b)(5) as a\nbasis for the withholding. In addition, although defendants wrote in the “justification” column of\nthe Vaughn Index for document number 4 that, “[d]isclosure of any portion of the document\nwould disclose attorney work product and the deliberate process concerning a particular case,\nthus the document is not segregable,” they did not assert Exemption (b)(5) as a basis for the\nwithholding. Even so, the Court would find based on its in camera review of the document, that\nit is not covered by either the attorney work product privilege or the deliberative process\nprivilege.\n\n\n                                               46\n\f              one on pages four to five of the record; (7) the first three sentences of paragraph two\n              on page five of the record; (8) the three words following the phrase “photographs of\n              Improvised Explosive Weapon left” that appear in paragraph five on page five of the\n              record; (9) all names that appear in paragraph five on pages five to six of the record;\n              (10) paragraphs six through ten that appear on pages six to seven of the record.\n                 5.      The Court need not examine any other FOIA exemptions\n\n       Plaintiff also identifies a handful of FOIA exemptions which he contends are inadequate\n\nto justify withholding responsive documents from production, but which the agencies never\n\ninvoked. 18    Pl.’s 2d Resp. 15–17, 20–21.       Because defendants have not relied upon these\n\nexemptions to withhold any material, the Court need not examine plaintiff’s arguments\n\nconcerning them.\n\n       III.      The Privacy Act\n\n       The Privacy Act provides:\n\n                 Each agency that maintains a system of records shall . . . upon request by\n                 any individual to gain access to his record or to any information pertaining\n                 to him which is contained in the system, permit him . . . to review the\n                 record and have a copy made of all or any portion thereof in a form\n                 comprehensible to him . . . .\n\n5 U.S.C. § 552a(d)(1).

Cunningham Decl. ¶ 13; see also Ex. 6 to Cunningham Decl.\n\nBut there is no indication that plaintiff appealed CRM’s subsequent determination to withhold\n\nthe Richter Memorandum – the document referred to CRM by EOUSA after plaintiff filed the\n\ncomplaint in this action.

In addition, there is no evidence that plaintiff exhausted his\n\nadministrative remedies with respect to the Richter memorandum when it was being withheld by\n\nEOUSA because, as will be discussed below, plaintiff did not administratively challenge\n\nEOUSA’s failure to timely respond to his request.

Plaintiff has not established that USMS inappropriately declined to produce\n        documents pursuant to the Privacy Act\n\n        Plaintiff did, however, appeal USMS’s withholdings under the Privacy Act, so this\n\nCourt’s review of that agency’s action is not jurisdictionally barred. USMS asserts that all of the\n\nrecords at issue here fall under an exemption to disclosure under the Privacy Act, codified at 5\n\nU.S.C. § 552a(j)(2) (“Exemption j(2)”). Defs.’ 2d Mem. at 13 n.5. Exemption j(2) applies if: (1)\n\nthe records are stored in a system of records that has been designated by the agency to be exempt\n\nfrom the Privacy Act’s disclosure requirements, and (2) the system of records is “maintained by\n\nan agency or component thereof which performs as its principal function any activity pertaining\n\nto the enforcement of criminal laws” and consists of “information compiled for the purpose of a\n\ncriminal investigation.” 5 U.S.C. § 552a(j)(2) (2012); see also Defs.’ 2d Mem. at 13 n.5.\n\n        Plaintiff has not opposed defendants’ assertion of Exemption (j)(2) over any of the\n\nmaterial at issue in this case, so the Court may properly treat defendants’ assertion as conceded.\n\nSee McMillan, 898 F. Supp. 2d at 69, citing Howard, 729 F.

The Bordley\nDeclaration states that the system of records to which these documents belong assists the USMS\nin effectuating its statutory law enforcement responsibilities. Bordley Decl. ¶ 5. In addition, as\nthe Bordley Declaration notes, federal regulation exempts the relevant systems because 28\nC.F.R. §§ 16.101(a) and (q) identify JUSTICE/USM-007 and JUSTICE/USM-005 as being\nexempt from Privacy Act disclosure provisions.

Plaintiff’s Privacy Act claims with respect to Treasury are barred\n\n       Because, as discussed above, plaintiff has not established that he submitted a request to\n\nTreasury, the Court need not address Treasury’s production obligations under the Privacy Act.\n\n       IV.    Plaintiff’s Remaining Arguments\n\n       Finally, plaintiff sets forth a number of other arguments concerning the adequacy of the\n\nagencies’ searches and productions. None is persuasive.\n\n       First plaintiff argues that the government is operating in bad faith and inappropriately\n\nwithholding exculpatory evidence for his criminal case. Pl.’s 2d Resp. at 26–27. With respect to\n\nthe adequacy of the search, and as the Court has already explained, affidavits attesting to a\n\nreasonable search “are afforded a presumption of good faith,” Defenders of Wildlife, 314 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 8, and “can be rebutted only ‘with evidence that the agency’s search was not made in\n\ngood faith.’” Id., quoting Trans Union LLC, 141 F. Supp. 2d at 69. Plaintiff has come forth with\n\nno evidence of bad faith. Instead, he offers merely conclusory assertions. See Pl.’s 2d Resp. at\n\n26–27. Accordingly, plaintiff’s unsupported argument is unsuccessful.\n\n       Next, plaintiff argues that the Vaughn index produced in this case is “simply smoke and\n\nmirrors” and that defendants should be ordered to produce an adequate Vaughn index.22 Id. at\n\n27–28. Production of a Vaughn index is just one way that an agency can explain its response to a\n\nFOIA request – albeit a common one. In order for a court to pass on the agency’s action, the\n\nagency must submit a “Vaughn index and/or accompanying affidavits or declarations”\n\nspecifically showing why documents were redacted or withheld in full. Defenders of Wildlife v.\n\nU.S. Border Patrol, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1513919\"><a href=\"/opinion/1513919/defenders-of-wildlife-v-us-border-patrol/\"><span class=\"volume\">623</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 88 (D.D.C. 2009).            The Vaughn indices and\n\naccompanying affidavits in this case are sufficient: Both EOUSA and USMS produced Vaughn\n\n\n22    As discussed, defendants produced two Vaughn indices – one for EOUSA and one for\nUSMS.\n                                              52\n\findices that set forth with particularity the documents withheld and the underlying rationales as\n\ndemonstrated by the Court’s ability to rely on them in assessing the government’s justifications\n\nfor its withholdings. See Bordley Decl. ¶ 12; Vaughn Index, Attach. to Luczynski Decl. Neither\n\nBOP nor ATF produced Vaughn indices, but they both produced detailed affidavits. Moreover,\n\nthe Court need not rely on detailed descriptions of those agencies’ withholdings because plaintiff\n\nhas failed to exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to their determinations. See 1st\n\nBoucher Decl.; Mack Decl.\n\n       Finally, there is no need for a Vaughn index for the remaining two agencies: Treasury\n\nand CRM. Treasury need not produce a Vaughn index because it did not receive any request\n\nfrom plaintiff, and the Court will grant summary judgment on that basis. CRM submitted a\n\ndeclaration that described with particularity the sole responsive document that its search\n\nuncovered, the material that was withheld from it, and the basis for its withholdings. See\n\nCunningham Decl.; Gilmore Decl. The agencies, therefore, need not provide additional Vaughn\n\nindices.\n\n       Plaintiff argues that this Court should undertake an in camera inspection of the withheld\n\ndocuments. Pl.’s 2d Resp. at 29. “Congress left the matter of In camera inspection to the\n\ndiscretion of the district court.” Ray v. Turner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"361163\"><a href=\"/opinion/361163/ellen-l-ray-and-william-h-schaap-v-stansfield-turner-director-central/\"><span class=\"volume\">587</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1187</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1195 (D.C.

And the\n\ncriterion that courts use to determine whether to exercise that discretion is “[w]hether the district\n\njudge believes that In camera inspection is needed in order to make a responsible de novo\n\ndetermination on the claims of exemption.” Id. At the same time, in camera review is not\n\nrequired in every case and it “is not a substitute for the government’s obligation to justify its\n\nwithholding in publicly available and debatable documents.” PHE, Inc. v.

And the Court has already found that the Vaughn indices\n\nsubmitted by the parties provide sufficient detail for the Court to assess the agencies’ claims of\n\nexemption on the remaining documents, except for the four EOUSA documents that the Court\n\nhas reviewed.\n\n       Finally, plaintiff argues that this Court’s powers in equity allow it to exercise jurisdiction\n\nfor purposes of deciding the matter. Pl.’s 2d Resp. at 30–32. But he provides no authority for\n\nthe proposition that a federal court can unilaterally expand its own jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 54\n\f                                           CONCLUSION\n\n       For the reasons set forth above, this Court will grant defendants’ first partial motion for\n\nsummary judgment [Dkt. # 15], and will grant in part and deny in part defendants’ second partial\n\nmotion for summary judgment [Dkt. # 22]. The Court will direct defendant EOUSA to produce\n\nportions of four withheld documents, consistent with this Memorandum Opinion. The Court will\n\nalso remand to BOP to review the documents that it received from EOUSA after plaintiff had\n\nalready initiated this action and to either disclose those documents to plaintiff or justify any\n\nwithholdings under FOIA. A separate order will issue.\n\n\n\n\n                                            AMY BERMAN JACKSON\n                                            United States District Judge\n\nDATE: August 23, 2013\n\n\n\n\n                                               55\n\f</pre>",
