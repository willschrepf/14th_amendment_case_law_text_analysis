The District Court retained jurisdiction over the remainder of the case, and issuance and sale of the bonds will in no way impair its jurisdiction to pass upon the appropriateness of the School Board's construction plans when they are developed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court was entirely correct in acting as it did to remove the cloud which the pendency of this claim created on the sale and issuance of the school bonds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This same school district is involved in another school desegregation case which was recently before this court.
