The jury also found true\nthe special circumstance allegations of burglary-murder and torture-murder.2\n(§§ 190.2, subd. (a)(17), (18).) The jury was unable to reach a penalty verdict, and\nthe trial court declared a mistrial.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n      A. Guilt Phase\n\n            1. Prosecution Evidence\n\n                  a. Murder of Marjorie Deeble\n\n                     1) The crime scene and condition of the victim’s body\n     In the late afternoon of Thursday, May 15, 1986, Marjorie Deeble was found\ndead in her single story apartment on Green Street in Los Alamitos, California.\nThe front screen door was closed but unlocked, and the wooden front door was\nopen approximately four inches. There was no sign of forced entry. The screen\nfrom a window next to the door had been removed, and was leaning against the\nbuilding.\n     Inside the home, loud music was playing in the southeast bedroom. Deeble\nwas discovered in this bedroom. She was lying face-down on the floor between\nthe bed and a dresser. She was wearing a long nightgown that had been pushed up\naround her waist and no panties. The bottom of the nightgown had been either cut\nor ripped. Her hands were tied behind her back with material from the nightgown,\nand with torn telephone cord.\n     Deeble‘s neck was in a noose made from a thin belt. The end of the belt was\ntied to the top drawer handle of the dresser, so that her neck was suspended about\neight inches above the floor. The drawer was open about six to eight inches.\nBlood had run out of her left ear and mouth, and there was blood around her nose.\nThere were two wounds on her neck, one underneath the belt and one just below.\nHer left leg was bent and leaning against the bed. Her right leg was fully extended\nand underneath the bed. Inside Deeble‘s thigh was a stain that could have been\ndried semen. She was barefoot, and her ankles bore marks that might have been\nligature marks.\n\n\n                                         2\n\f     A cylindrical mousse can was found in a bed covering on top of the bed. A\nsubstance underneath the ridge around the top of the can appeared to be blood, and\ngave a positive response to a presumptive test for blood. A cap found on the\nground next to Deeble appeared to be one that could fit the mousse can. A\nsubstance that appeared to be blood was observed just inside the opening of the\ncap ―in a position that if the cap had been placed upon the mousse can, it might\nhave transferred.‖\n     On the floor, a pillowcase, a dress, and a scarf were wrapped together with\nadhesive tape. The dress was bloodstained. The pillowcase was also\nbloodstained. It was tied to resemble a hood, and appeared to have been cut with\npinking shears. More blood was inside the pillowcase than was on the outside.\n     A sheet was found on the floor. A strip approximately 66 inches long and 15\ninches wide had been cut and torn from the left side of the sheet. The irregular\ncutting was possibly made by the use of pinking shears. A telephone cord and an\nelectrical cord were found tied together either on the floor or on the bed.\n     The bedroom had been ransacked. Garments lay in the middle of the room,\nitems were knocked over on the credenza, dresser drawers were open, and the\ncontents of a purse were strewn on the floor. A telephone that appeared to have its\ncord ripped off was against the wall.\n     Dr. Robert Richards, a pathologist, performed Deeble‘s autopsy. Because\nDr. Richards had retired by the time of trial, his partner, Dr. Richard Fukumoto,\ntestified regarding the autopsy findings. In light of defendant‘s appellate claims\nthat this testimony violated his confrontation clause rights (see post, at pt. II.B.2.),\nthat the trial court erred in admitting evidence of the uncharged murder of Muriel\nDelbecq (see post, at pt. II.B.3.), that the evidence is insufficient to support the\nmurder conviction on a theory of torture murder or burglary murder, and that the\nevidence is insufficient to support the jury‘s true findings on the torture-murder\n\n                                           3\n\fand burglary-murder special-circumstance allegations (see post, at pts. II.B.4.,\nII.B.5.), we recount the autopsy findings in detail.\n     Deeble had bruises in her vaginal area, primarily on the labia and vaginal\nvault. There was bruising and tearing just inside the opening to the vagina, and a\ntear and hemorrhaging in the area of the posterior fourchette, or the bottom of the\nopening to the vagina. On one microscopic slide, Dr. Richards had noted an\n―underlying submucosal hemorrhage.‖ Dr. Fukumoto testified that the ―lining of\nthe vaginal wall is called the mucosa, so a submucosa means the area below that\nlining of the surface.‖ A ―submucosal hemorrhage‖ means that ―there is bleeding\nbeneath the surface lining of the mucus membrane.‖ No tissue response was\nnoted, which Dr. Fukumoto said meant that the injury to the vaginal area was\nprobably less than eight hours old. Deeble‘s anus was dilated, and bruising and\nsmall mucosal lacerations were observed just inside the anus. Dr. Fukumoto\nopined that the dilation of the anus could have been caused by a finger, penis, or\nany number of other objects.\n     Dr. Fukumoto agreed with the prosecutor that the vaginal and rectal areas are\n―full of lots of nerve endings,‖ and so trauma to those areas is ―highly painful.‖\nHe opined the injuries were caused by an object that did not have sharp edges, and\nthat exhibit No. 16, the mousse can found in Deeble‘s bed, was consistent with an\nobject that could have caused the injuries. From the microscopic examination,\nDr. Fukumoto opined that the injuries to the vaginal and rectal areas were inflicted\nbefore death.3\n\n3 The prosecutor asked Dr. Fukumoto if ―[f]rom the microscopic examination‖ he\ncould determine whether the injuries to the vaginal and rectal area ―were caused\nbefore or after death,‖ and Dr. Fukumoto replied ―Yes,‖ and subsequently stated\nwithout elaboration his opinion that the injuries occurred before death. The\n―microscopic examination‖ presumably refers to Dr. Fukumoto‘s examination of\n―microscopic slides,‖ which he defined as ―slide preparations of tissues from\n\n\n                                          4\n\f      There was bleeding in the tissues near the tail of Deeble‘s pancreas.\nDr. Fukumoto testified that the pancreas is an organ located deep within the body,\nand it requires a ―tremendous amount of . . . localized‖ blunt force to the area to\ndamage the pancreas. In the stomach area, Dr. Richards had observed food that\nwas virtually untouched by digestion. Dr. Fukumoto opined that such a finding\nwould indicate that Deeble died within an hour after eating.\n      Blood was coming out of Deeble‘s left ear, and there was extensive\nhemorrhaging in the middle ears which extended from the middle ear into the bone\nof the skull. The right ear drum was torn, and the left ear drum had a break that\naccording to the autopsy report was ―incisional.‖ Dr. Fukumoto explained: ―[A]n\nincision to a forensic pathologist . . . . is not a tear. It is something that is caused\nby a sharp instrument or an instrument that has a point.‖ Dr. Fukumoto said that\n―if the ear drums are torn, associated with massive bleeding in the middle ears, this\ncould be due to a massive increase in pressure as a result of the struggle of the\nvictim in his or her attempt to get a breath.‖ Dr. Fukumoto opined that an amount\nof pressure that would tear an ear drum, and the infliction of an incisional injury to\nan ear drum would, in each case, be extremely painful.\n      Dr. Richards‘s most prominent finding from the neck up was ―marked\nengorgement‖ — which occurs when blood vessels are dilated and filled with\nblood — in the neck, upper neck, and face area. Dr. Fukumoto testified that\nstrangling can have this effect, and when there is venous but not carotid\ncompression, the face becomes red and eventually bluish or purplish as well as\n\n\n(footnote continued from previous page)\nvarious organs which the pathologist has taken . . . for pathologists to look at in\ncase somebody has to review the case.‖ In addition, the prosecutor asked Dr.\nFukumoto about the ―microscopic examination that Dr. Richards did as well that\nyou yourself did . . . on the area of the vagina.‖\n\n\n                                            5\n\fengorged.4 The whites of Deeble‘s eyes had conjunctival hemorrhages, or\nbleeding, and there was a marked swelling of the eyelids. There were abraded\nlacerations in the left chin area. There was a crescent in the bridge area of the\nnose that was consistent to Dr. Richards with ―fracturing of the bridge.‖\nDr. Richards palpated Deeble‘s nose and believed that it was broken, but no\nfracture was visible to him on an x-ray. Dr. Fukumoto reviewed x-rays of the nose\nand testified that one showed ―somewhat flattening‖ that ―may reflect fracturing at\nthe bridge of [the] nose.‖ An internal examination revealed numerous pinpoint\nhemorrhages in the scalp and muscle tissue which were evidence of trauma, and\nsubarachnoid hemorrhaging inside the skull. Dr. Fukumoto opined that the\ninjuries above the neck were the result of blunt force trauma, and that Deeble had\nsuffered at least one significant blow to her face. A substance that appeared to be\nthe residue of adhesive tape was observed in an area extending from the mouth\nover to the lower left cheek.\n     An autopsy photograph showed a deep furrow created by the ligature around\nDeeble‘s neck. Dr. Fukumoto opined that features of the furrow indicated that\nthere was an ―abrasive sideways movement‖ either by the victim in an attempt to\nloosen the ligature, or by the perpetrator as he moved the ligature back and forth,\nand that the ligature and struggling against it would be extremely painful.\n     Dr. Fukumoto stated that when one is strangled, it takes five to six minutes\nfor the brain to die, and the individual may lose consciousness well before then; in\nan extreme ligature or manual strangulation, loss of consciousness can occur in\n\n\n\n4  Dr. Fukumoto testified that engorgement differs from swelling, which is when\nthere is fluid outside the blood vessels that makes tissue swell up, and has nothing\nto do with the presence of blood inside the blood vessels. Swelling indicates that\ntrauma has been inflicted, especially if it is associated with hemorrhaging.\n\n\n                                          6\n\fless than a minute. He opined that the cause of death was ―asphyxiation due to\nligature strangulation.‖ This opinion was consistent with that of Dr. Richards.\n\n                    2) Circumstances surrounding the Deeble murder\n     Deeble was a real estate agent, and Rebecca Brown was the manager of the\noffice at which Deeble worked. On Monday May 12, 1986, Deeble mentioned to\nBrown that she was leaving for an appointment scheduled for about 5:00 p.m.\nBrown understood that Deeble never arrived at the appointment, and she never\nsaw Deeble alive again. Deeble did not contact Brown on May 13, 14, or 15,\nwhich was highly unusual because Deeble was a top agent and the most active\nagent in the office. Brown recalled that during this time period the real estate\nmarket was ―[h]ot, hot.‖\n     Kathryn Deeble Valentine, Deeble‘s daughter, testified she met defendant in\nabout March 1986. They began dating shortly thereafter.5 For about two months\nbefore her mother‘s death, Valentine saw defendant every evening, but only\nwitnessed him drinking once, and once saw him inject cocaine. She never saw\nhim passed out or ―blacked out‖ on alcohol or drugs.\n     Valentine saw her mother for the last time on the morning of Monday\nMay 12, 1986, between 7:00 and 7:30 a.m. Valentine called Deeble several times\nbetween Monday and Thursday of that week and left messages on her answering\nmachine, but never spoke with her.\n     In May 1986 Valentine owned a pickup truck to which only she and\ndefendant had keys. In early May 1986, defendant borrowed the truck for the\nweekend, and when the time came to return it, said it was not drivable. Deeble\nbecame upset, and arranged for defendant to take the truck in for repair.\n\n5 At the time she was dating defendant, Deeble‘s daughter shared her last name.\nAt the time of trial, Deeble‘s daughter‘s last name was Valentine.\n\n\n                                          7\n\f     Deeble would at times leave an apartment key out in a drain pipe in front of\nthe apartment. Defendant knew the key was there. Valentine also told defendant\nthat one could access the apartment through a screen window. Defendant had\nbeen inside Deeble‘s home on at least two occasions, once when Valentine\nintroduced defendant to her mother (the only time they met), and once with\nValentine while Deeble was away.\n     When Valentine met defendant, his leg was in a cast. During the week of\nMay 11, 1986, his leg was no longer in a cast, and he could run with a limp, and\n―move fast if he needed to.‖\n     Valentine generally parked her truck in her driveway, positioning the truck so\nthat it was either before or beyond some juniper bushes so that she could avoid\nstanding in the bushes when entering or exiting the vehicle. On the night of\nMay 12, 1986, Valentine parked the truck before the juniper bushes. The\nfollowing morning, she had to stand in the juniper bushes to enter her truck,\nindicating that someone had moved the truck. Valentine had not given defendant\npermission to use the truck the night before.\n     Valentine and defendant continued to date for about a week after Deeble‘s\nbody was discovered. Valentine asked defendant to attend Deeble‘s funeral, but\nhe declined.\n     Valentine identified — by looking at photographs of Deeble while she was\nalive — certain jewelry that Deeble owned but that Valentine never saw again\nafter Deeble‘s death.\n\n               b. Murder of Muriel Delbecq\n     The prosecutor relied on the other crimes evidence of Muriel Delbecq‘s 1993\nmurder to demonstrate the identity, common design or plan, and intent of the killer\nof Marjorie Deeble.\n\n\n\n                                         8\n\f     On the evening of January 25, 1993, Peggy Ventura dropped off her 67-year-\nold mother, Muriel Delbecq, at Delbecq‘s first floor condominium on Kanoe\nStreet in Kihei, Maui, Hawaii. The following morning, about 7:30 a.m., Ventura\nknocked at Delbecq‘s door and received no response. The front door was closed\nand locked, and Ventura used a key to enter. She observed blood on the carpet,\nand the living room telephone was missing. Delbecq‘s bedroom door was closed\nand locked. Ventura ran outside, alerted neighbors to call 911, and entered her\nmother‘s bedroom through a window. There was a comforter over the window,\nmaking the bedroom ―pitch black.‖ The light switch did not work, and Ventura\nopened the bedroom door to let in light.\n     Ventura discovered Delbecq on the bed under a pile of blankets. She was\nlying on her back, completely nude. Responding officers testified that Delbecq‘s\nlegs were spread, and her hands and feet were not bound. Defendant‘s palm prints\nwere found on the wall, and his bloody right footprint was found on a white\nT-shirt. Delbecq‘s bedroom was ransacked, and the carpet appeared soaked with\nblood. Cigarette butts were found on the floor of the bedroom and in the\nbathroom.\n     Ventura testified that Delbecq always wore her wedding ring. Maui County\nPolice Lieutenant Lenie Lawrence, who examined Delbecq at the murder scene,\ndid not observe any jewelry on Delbecq, but did see a white mark around her left\nring finger indicating a ring had been there.\n     After being locked out in December 1992, Delbecq told Ventura she was\ngoing to hide a key under a rock outside her condominium. Ventura testified,\napparently based on a photograph, that a window screen in the living room was\n\n\n\n\n                                           9\n\fbowed, and more damaged than she recalled.6 A responding officer testified that a\ncorner of the window screen in the living room was slightly bent; it appeared the\nscreen had been taken out and put back improperly. Pieces of dried grass were on\nthe window sill and on the floor under the window sill.\n     In a dumpster near Delbecq‘s residence, police found a bloody pillowcase\nwith a pattern that was consistent with Delbecq‘s bedding. In the pillowcase,\npolice found a variety of items, including a check for an account held by Muriel\nDelbecq and Peggy Ventura, traveler‘s checks, two telephones Ventura identified\nas being her mother‘s, two pieces of telephone cord tied together, cut clothing, a\nflashlight, a wine bottle, two beer cans, a Seattle Seahawks game schedule, a golf\ntag, golf tees, dishwashing liquid, stain remover, shampoo, lotion, disposable\nrazors, and scissors.\n     Ventura testified that Delbecq, wearing her swimsuit, walked to the beach\nabout four blocks away nearly every morning. Lieutenant Lawrence searched\ndefendant‘s apartment several days after the murder. He found binoculars on a\nsmall table located directly beneath a bedroom window that faced Delbecq‘s\nresidence. Using the binoculars, he could clearly see what type of vehicle was\nentering and leaving the parking lot of Delbecq‘s building.\n     Dr. Alvin Omori, who conducted the autopsy on Delbecq, testified that her\nhead and right ear were bruised. There was bruising to the scalp caused by blunt\ntrauma. Her nose was fractured. There were bruises to her lips, and tears to the\ninner portion of her lips, indicating force or pressure was placed over the mouth\narea. Her neck was bruised, and her hyoid bone, or the bone located right above\n\n\n6   Ventura testified that before ―we realized how the screens go in‖ and how to\nremove them, ―we had used a knife to kind of pry open the side and lift them out .\n. . so there was one corner [where] . . . you could see . . . . it was kind of bent.‖\n\n\n                                         10\n\fthe voice box, was broken. The skin over the voice box had an ―incised type of\nabrasion,‖ caused by a sharpened or pointed object being scraped horizontally\nacross the skin. Similar abrasions appeared on the lower portion of the left neck,\nthe left anterior chest about the breast, and the breast area, including the nipples of\nboth breasts. Both breasts were bruised. There was a puncture wound on the left\nlower chest. Ligature marks on her wrists and ankles indicated she had been\nbound.\n     The genital area had a pattern of abrasions or scraping of the skin consistent\nwith fingernail marks. The entrance to the vaginal cavity was bruised, and there\nwere internal injuries to both the vaginal and rectal areas. There were two\nperforations in the vaginal cavity. The first perforation extended into the rectal\ncavity. The second perforation was to the right upper portion of the vaginal\ncavity, and extended into the abdominal cavity. This perforation was caused by a\nmousse can that was found protruding into the abdominal cavity. The rectum was\ntorn, and the bowel was perforated ―into the abdominal cavity.‖ There was visible\nbleeding in both the vaginal and rectal orifices, and approximately 100 cc‘s, or\nthree and one-third ounces, of blood was in the perforated area of the rectum and\nthe vaginal cavity. The injuries to the rectal and vaginal area appeared to have\nbeen inflicted before Delbecq‘s death.\n     The most probable cause of death was ―asphyxia or lack of oxygen due to\nstrangulation and/or suffocation.‖ The injuries to the vaginal area as well as the\nrectal tear were a contributing factor, but were not life threatening by themselves\nat the time she was asphyxiated.\n\n\n\n\n                                          11\n\f           2. Defense Evidence\n\n                a. Testimony of defendant and defendant’s family and friends\n     Laura McFarland, defendant‘s mother, testified that she married William\nEdwards, Sr., in July 1959. Defendant was born in 1961, and had an older brother\nWilliam, and a younger sister Elena. The family lived primarily in Florida until\ndefendant was about nine years old. They then moved to Puerto Rico for about 11\nmonths. Laura left defendant‘s father in July 1974, and she and the children\nreturned to California. The couple divorced in 1975, and Laura remarried in about\n1984. Defendant‘s father died in December 1992.\n     William, Sr., suspected that defendant was not his child. He first hit\ndefendant when defendant was about six months old. When defendant was a\nchild, his father hit or beat him almost daily. He nicknamed defendant and his\nbrother ―SFB-1‖ and ―SFB-2,‖ which stood for ―shit for brains one and two.‖\nWilliam, Sr., was also violent towards Laura.\n     When defendant was born, his father worked as a bartender and had an\nalcohol problem. Laura, who was a registered nurse, also had an alcohol problem,\nand in 1972 received a prescription for Valium. She continued to use prescription\nValium off and on until about the late 1970‘s. When defendant was about 11,\nLaura was run over by a car while she was intoxicated.\n     Laura first saw defendant under the influence of drugs when he was 14 years\nold, in February 1975. Defendant continued using drugs and alcohol. He\nperformed poorly in school, and he and his brother committed burglaries to\nsupport their habit.\n     Laura saw defendant‘s brother William drunk for the first time when he was\n14 years of age. Many years later, defendant‘s sister Elena began to have\nproblems with drugs and alcohol. Defendant‘s paternal grandmother was addicted\nto Ativan, and Laura‘s mother was addicted to prescription drugs such as Valium\n\n\n                                        12\n\fand Percodan. All four of Laura‘s siblings had problems with alcohol, and one of\nher sisters was also addicted to Valium.\n      Defendant testified. He was born in 1961 in Long Beach, California, and\nwas 35 years old at the time of trial. He dropped out of school when he was in the\neighth grade, and earned money doing day labor and odd jobs. When defendant\nwas in his late teens and early 20‘s, he and his brother William made money by\nselling what appeared to be paper LSD, but was actually nothing but paper with a\ndesign on it. Defendant testified, ―it was a safe way to make money without\ncommitting a crime.‖\n      Defendant recalled drinking a small amount of beer when he was about eight\nor nine years old and enjoying the effect of the alcohol. Defendant had other\nexperiences with alcohol after that. Defendant moved back to California from\nPuerto Rico when he was 12 or 13. His alcohol use ―increased drastically‖ and he\n―drank continuously.‖ He started smoking cigarettes when he was 12 years old,\ncontinued to smoke through the mid-1980‘s, and had only recently quit at the time\nof trial.\n      Defendant‘s first experience with drugs was using marijuana when he was 11\nor 12 years old. He tried hashish and cannabinol when he was about 12 years old.\nHe then tried LSD, cocaine, peyote, methamphetamine, amphetamines,\nbarbiturates, and heroin. When defendant was about 14 years old, he began\ninjecting drugs. His drug and alcohol use increased throughout his teenage years.\n      Defendant frequently used a technique called ―jacking off‖ when injecting\ndrugs. After injecting the drug, he would draw blood into the syringe, and then\nreinject it into his arm. He also used a technique called ―shooting water,‖ which\ninvolved attempting to collect and use any residue of a drug that might be left in a\nbag. When he was about 18, he injected an unknown drug, and ―thought [he] was\ngoing to die.‖\n\n                                           13\n\f     Defendant experienced his first alcoholic blackout when he was about 16\nyears old. Defendant described various situations in which he had blacked out,\nsuch as being with friends and making plans to go somewhere, and suddenly\nfinding himself walking apparently alone on the street in Long Beach at 5:00 a.m.\nand not knowing how he got there. On another occasion he found himself under a\nkitchen table in an unfamiliar residence. There was never a time when defendant\nbecame aware of his surroundings after blacking out and he never had reason to\nsuspect he had been involved in a violent crime.\n     In December 1985, defendant was involved in a motorcycle accident, and had\nsurgery on his right leg. As a result, his leg was in a cast. In the spring of 1986,\ndefendant met Kathryn Valentine while he was selling fake LSD at a Long Beach\nbus stop. Valentine drove by in her pickup truck, saw defendant had a cast, and\noffered him a ride. The two began dating shortly thereafter. Valentine gave\ndefendant a key to her truck, and told him that there was a spare key in a magnetic\nbox hidden on the truck.\n     Valentine introduced defendant to her mother, Marjorie Deeble, at Deeble‘s\nhouse. He also saw Deeble when he helped her and Valentine load Deeble‘s car\nfor a weekend trip to Palm Springs. Both meetings were cordial. Defendant\nborrowed Valentine‘s truck while she and her mother were in Palm Springs, and\nthe generator died. When Valentine and Deeble returned from Palm Springs,\ndefendant and Deeble discussed on the telephone what had happened to the truck,\nand Deeble told defendant to take it to the dealership for repair. During this\nconversation, Deeble did not raise her voice, and was firm and assertive, but not\nangry. Defendant was not bothered by the incident, nor did he have any ill will or\nhostile feelings toward Deeble or Valentine because of it. Defendant subsequently\nreceived a blank check from Deeble for the repair, and took the truck to the\ndealership.\n\n                                          14\n\f     Defendant and Valentine once went to Deeble‘s residence when she was not\nhome. He and Valentine were intimate. Defendant was not aware of a key hidden\noutside Deeble‘s residence, and never had possession of a key to her home.\n     Defendant continued to use drugs and alcohol during the time he dated\nValentine. Valentine did not know anything about drugs, and at her request,\ndefendant once let her watch him inject cocaine.\n     When defendant learned of Deeble‘s death, he and Valentine were visiting\nhis aunt and uncle. Valentine was told she had to go to the Los Alamitos Police\nDepartment because something had happened to her mother. Valentine and\ndefendant drove to the police station. Defendant waited in the lobby, and after a\nfew minutes he heard Valentine crying. Valentine and defendant continued to date\nfor a ―couple of weeks‖ after Deeble‘s death. They then ―drifted apart,‖ but\nremained on good terms. Defendant refused police requests for blood, urine, and\nhair samples.\n     Defendant denied killing Marjorie Deeble. In May of 1986, defendant had\nlittle mobility, could bend his right knee only a small amount, could not put his\nfull weight on his leg, and could not run. On the night of May 12, 1986, defendant\nand his brother sold fake LSD outside a Judas Priest concert in Los Angeles. They\nleft for the concert about 4:00 p.m., and returned home between 11:00 and 11:30\np.m. He drank alcohol throughout the concert. They then obtained drugs, and\ndefendant went home to inject cocaine and heroin and to drink. At no time that\nweek, including May 12, did defendant go to Deeble‘s residence.\n     Defendant testified he had been convicted of murder and burglary in Hawaii\nin 1994. He was also convicted of second degree burglary in California in 1984.\n     Janice Hunt testified that she dated defendant in Hawaii. Around December\n1992, defendant moved in with Hunt and her 12-year-old daughter. That same\nmonth, defendant‘s father was killed in an airplane crash. Defendant‘s demeanor\n\n                                         15\n\fchanged, and he became quiet and depressed. He drank more heavily than before.\nAt times, defendant became so intoxicated he had alcoholic blackouts. Hunt\ndescribed two incidents, one when defendant left in his work truck at night, and\nthe next morning she and defendant searched for the truck, and another when he\napparently left a bag of groceries outside all night. She did not believe he was\nusing drugs during the time he was living with her.\n     Hunt kept binoculars in her bedroom so that she could watch whales. She\nhad a partial ocean view from her bedroom window. Hunt had difficulty focusing\nthe binoculars, and never saw defendant look through or touch them.\n     On the evening of January 25, 1993, the night Delbecq was murdered, Hunt\nwas at home with her daughter and defendant. Between 8:00 and 8:30 p.m., an\nacquaintance informed defendant that his dog had been killed. Defendant found\nthe dog on the road, held it, and sobbed. They buried the dog at sea. Hunt\nreturned home, and when she went to bed between 11:00 and 11:30 p.m.,\ndefendant was not yet home. Defendant returned home before morning. The next\nday Hunt learned of a murder that had occurred nearby and informed defendant;\nhe seemed surprised.\n     David Long testified that he knew defendant for about a year before January\n1993. He observed defendant ingest drugs and alcohol nearly every time he saw\nhim. On the night of January 25, 1993, sometime between 8:30 and 11:00 p.m.,\ndefendant came to Long‘s apartment, talked about his dog, and injected half a\ngram to a gram of cocaine. When defendant left, he was more intoxicated with\ndrugs and alcohol than Long had ever seen him.\n     Carl Stevens knew defendant in junior high school in Long Beach. He saw\ndefendant outside of school approximately 10 to 25 times, and on each occasion\ndefendant was drinking alcohol or using drugs. Stevens had had no contact with\ndefendant for the last 13 years.\n\n                                         16\n\f     Vincent Portillo, defendant‘s cousin, lived in Maui for a month in 1991-1992.\nOne night he, defendant, and defendant‘s girlfriend Brenda drank heavily. They\ngot into a vehicle with defendant driving and Brenda in the passenger seat.\nBrenda and defendant argued, and Brenda hit defendant several times. Defendant\ndid not hit her back, but blocked her hits to maintain control of the vehicle. The\nfollowing day, defendant did not appear to be upset with Brenda over her behavior\nthe night before.\n\n               b. Testimony of other witnesses\n     Orange County Sheriff supervising forensic specialist Sharon Krenz testified\nthat on May 15, 1986, she observed baggies of pills on the dresser and the floor of\nDeeble‘s bedroom. She entered a different room and observed a TV Guide that\nwas open to Monday May 12. She also observed pinking shears on the floor of the\nbathroom. She did not observe any cigarette butts in the apartment. None of the\nfingerprints lifted from Deeble‘s apartment matched defendant‘s.\n     Richard Brown, a criminalist with the Orange County Sheriff‘s Office crime\nlab, testified that comparison of defendant‘s pubic hair to pubic hair found at the\ncrime scene eliminated defendant as a source of the crime scene hair. Brown was\nunable to compare the crime scene hair to that of seven men other than defendant\nbecause the hair standards submitted for those individuals contained too few hairs\nto make a comparison. He sent a report to the Los Alamitos Police Department\nstating that the hair standards were inadequate. He was never provided with\nadequate hair samples.\n     Sergeant James Jessen of the Los Alamitos Police Department testified that\nhe was the lead investigator of Deeble‘s murder. He interviewed Deeble‘s\ndaughter Kathryn Valentine on May 15, 1986. Valentine told Jessen that on\nMonday night (presumably Monday May 12, 1986), her brother had borrowed her\n\n\n\n                                         17\n\ftruck for a short period of time. Valentine also told Jessen that she kept a spare\nkey in a magnetic lock box on the vehicle. Although Jessen had looked inside\nValentine‘s truck, to his knowledge the truck had never been searched, nor had he\nrequested it be photographed or processed for fingerprints or trace evidence. The\nparties stipulated that Sergeant Jessen‘s report did not state that Valentine had told\nhim she had ―shown [defendant] a hidden key, he knew where one was‖ at her\nmother‘s residence. When Jessen met with defendant on May 20, 1986, he\nobserved defendant walked with a noticeable limp and appeared to have difficulty\nstanding on his right leg for a long period of time. There was no indication in\nJessen‘s report that he asked defendant for permission to search his living quarters.\n     On approximately October 21, 1987, Sergeant Jessen spoke with Maggie\nBlack of the Orange County Sheriff‘s Office crime lab regarding elimination\nprints. Black was dissatisfied with the quality of the prints taken of five\nindividuals other than defendant and said they would have to be redone.\n     Gloria Dangerfield, an employee of the facility manager for the Los Angeles\nSports Arena and Coliseum, testified that on May 12, 1986, Judas Priest\nperformed at a concert at the sports arena between about 8:00 and 11:00 p.m.\n     Paul Roy dated Deeble at some point after August 1985.7 On May 12 or 13,\n1986, Roy called Deeble at her home at 8:20 p.m. One or two days later, Roy\nwent to Deeble‘s apartment and knocked on her door. When no one answered, he\nplaced a greeting card for Deeble between the screen door and the closed wooden\ndoor. He did not recall a window screen leaning up against the wall of the house.\n\n\n\n\n7 Roy was a reluctant witness, and the parties agreed that Sergeant Jessen and\nRobert Courtney, the senior investigator for the Orange County Public Defender‘s\nOffice, could testify as to his statements.\n\n\n                                          18\n\f     Alden Olson testified that he dated Marjorie Deeble during the eight weeks\nbefore her death. He saw her do her laundry, including her sheets, three or four\ntimes. Deeble always locked the doors to her apartment — including her front\nscreen door — before going to bed.\n     Leonard Hirsch, who dated Deeble on a regular basis from about 1980 to\n1983, and less frequently after that, testified that Deeble‘s sheets were generally\nfresh and clean. She also vacuumed once a week, and often more than once a\nweek.\n     Vivian Camp, who sold Avon products, went to Deeble‘s home on Thursday\nMay 15, 1986 between 11:00 and 11:15 a.m. The door to Deeble‘s residence was\nopen about a foot, and Camp could see inside the residence. She did not notice a\nscreen off of the window that was facing the walkway.\n\n               c. Expert testimony\n     Defense expert Dr. Paul Wolf, a clinical professor of pathology, and a trauma\nand transplant pathologist at the University of California Medical Center in San\nDiego, and director of autopsy at the Veteran‘s Administration Medical Center in\nLa Jolla, testified as an expert on pathology. He had reviewed Deeble‘s autopsy\nreport. According to the report, Deeble had hemorrhaged from both ears.\nDr. Wolf stated this is a common finding after ligature strangulation because the\nblood vessels in the ears are engorged, and the ear drums are perforated and bleed.\nThere can also be tears in the middle ear that are either sharp or jagged.\nStrangulation, which causes asphyxia, creates pressure on the veins so great that\nsmall blood vessels in the nose, mouth, and ears will rupture. Because\nDr. Richards, the pathologist who performed Deeble‘s autopsy, had not taken any\nmicroscopic sections of the ears, there was no way to ascertain whether the\ndamage to the right eardrum was caused by a sharp object or by the increased\n\n\n\n                                         19\n\fpressure that followed the ligature strangulation. Moreover, ―incisional‖ was not a\nterm of art, and its use in an autopsy report did not ineluctably mean that the\ndamage had been caused by a sharp object.\n     Dr. Wolf further testified that when an individual is strangled, he or she can\nlose consciousness within 15 to 30 seconds, and it takes about four minutes of lack\nof oxygen for the heart and ―respiratory center‖ to die. Dr. Wolf agreed with\nDr. Fukumoto that an incision, which Dr. Richards did not perform, ―would have\nbeen the best procedure to confirm or disprove that there was a fracture‖ of the\nnose. He also agreed that the possible fracture was more likely from a blow rather\nthan a fall. A blow to the head of sufficient force to break a nose could cause\nimmediate unconsciousness. A person unconscious from either strangulation or a\nblow would not feel pain. Ligature strangulation and bleeding from the ears as a\nresult of ligature strangulation were not necessarily consistent with extreme or\nprolonged pain. Nor were the ligature marks on Deeble‘s ankles consistent with\nextreme or prolonged pain.\n     Dr. Wolf stated that a ―laceration‖ and a ―hemorrhage‖ can be microscopic in\nsize. He described the injuries to Deeble‘s vagina and rectum as microscopic and\n―[e]xtremely minor.‖ He opined they could have been caused by a finger or a\npenis. Deeble was menopausal, and Dr. Wolf opined that was the reason the\nvaginal mucosa (or lining of the vaginal wall) was so thin. When the mucosa is\nthin, any kind of manipulation by a finger, penis, or other foreign object is more\nlikely to cause microscopic lacerations. Although Dr. Richards reported\nlacerations and tears, he did not measure them. Dr. Wolf noted that there are\n―ruga folds‖ in the vagina that can be mistaken for a laceration, and that the only\nslide from the vagina showed ―a very minor removal of a mucosa.‖ Dr. Richards\nhad reported submucosal hemorrhage (or bleeding beneath the surface of the\nlining of the vaginal wall) in the vagina, and Dr. Wolf confirmed this in his\n\n                                         20\n\fexamination of a slide of a vaginal tissue section. It was ―such a small amount\nthat it wouldn‘t be too visible,‖ and Dr. Richards did not report seeing any blood\nin the vagina. For a criminalist to see a visible substance all the way around the\ntop of a can that he thought might be blood was inconsistent with the microscopic\nquantity of blood that was reported in the vagina. Moreover, because no blood\nwas observed in the rectum, there was not enough blood to go around the edge of a\ncap area.\n     Dr. Alex Stalcup testified as a specialist in addiction medicine. He did not\ninterview defendant and had not diagnosed him, although he had interviewed\nmembers of defendant‘s family.8 He had also received a record of defendant‘s\ncontacts with police, and transcripts of interviews with family members and\nindividuals familiar with defendant‘s drug use in the 1980‘s. He was not given\nany information about the Deeble and Delbecq murders.\n     Dr. Stalcup testified that alcoholism and drug addiction are illnesses. Signs\nof the disease of addiction include inability to control intake of the drug or alcohol\nand continued drug or alcohol use despite adverse consequences. He opined that\npredisposition based on genetics or child abuse, early drug experiences and the\ncircumstances of the first experience, and whether the individual is in an enabling\nenvironment in which drugs are easily available, widely used, and not\ndiscouraged, are factors that contribute to certain individuals becoming addicts\nwhile others do not. Genetics were the most, and child abuse was the second\nmost, prevalent risk factor for addiction or alcoholism. Considering defendant‘s\nhypothetical risk factors of genetic background, horrific childhood abuse, lack of\n\n\n8 The jury was instructed that Dr. Stalcup‘s testimony regarding statements by\nindividuals such as defendant‘s family members was not admissible to prove the\nfacts in the statements, but was admitted only to provide the basis for his opinion.\n\n\n                                          21\n\fsupervision, and an environment in which drugs were available, Dr. Stalcup\nopined: ―I frankly don‘t see how he escaped being an addict. This fellow didn‘t\nhave a chance.‖\n     Dr. Stalcup testified that one study indicated that individuals with a history\non both sides of the family of alcoholism or drug addiction had half of the normal\namount of endorphin. This meant ―they are very different in their ability to feel\nnormal. . . . Pleasure is hard to get. . . For them pleasure is b[l]unted.‖ ―[T]he term\nfor the way they feel is called chronic dysphoria. Dysphoria is the opposite of\neuphoria. . . . A lot of these kids from a very young age feel off.‖ ―Once these\nkids discover alcohol and drugs, unless there is early intervention, it is all over.\nBecause they feel pleasure, they feel satisfaction, they feel normal for the first\ntime in their life.‖ ―[N]ow for the first time [they] don‘t feel dysphoria.‖\n     When drugs such as amphetamines are injected, they reach the brain\ninstantly, and ―there is such an explosive release [of] dopamine and endorphin that\nit damages the pleasure centers. It literally damages or overwhelms the part of the\nbrain responsible for feeling normal pleasure. . . . [I]ndividuals who use drugs . . .\nwill progressively injure their ability to feel normal pleasure.‖ This explained why\nmany individuals do not stay sober, and instead relapse.\n     Dr. Stalcup found use of alcohol and drugs at a young age significant. He\nalso found it significant that defendant did not have a drug of choice, and that once\nhe was exposed to alcohol and drugs, he immediately lost control. ―[H]e is telling\nus that something was wrong with sobriety. Something was wrong with how he\nfelt.‖ Dr. Stalcup also noted that injecting drugs by the age of 13 or 14 was ―quite\nunusual,‖ and ―indicative of extremely rapid progression of addiction.‖ He said:\n―What I interpret when I hear these stories is . . . that something is really wrong\nwith this kid. Something is really intolerable for him or her. That something is\neither happening in their home or as we mentioned earlier, they are chronically\n\n                                          22\n\fdysphoric. They feel really bad.‖ Based on these factors, Dr. Stalcup opined that\ndefendant would fall in the 1 or 2 percent of the most severely affected drug\naddicts. Dr. Stalcup agreed with the prosecutor that he was ―not saying that a\nperson who is addicted to drugs or alcohol [was] not responsible for the violent\ncrimes they commit.‖\n       Dr. Stalcup testified that anyone who drinks can have an alcoholic blackout.\nSuch an individual has had enough alcohol that an average person can tell he or\nshe is intoxicated because of slurred speech and unsteadiness on his or her feet.\nAn individual who uses alcohol with cocaine is ―far, far, far more likely to go into\nan alcoholic blackout.‖ Sixteen is an early age for an individual to experience his\nfirst alcoholic blackout.\n\n             3. Rebuttal Evidence\n       Sergeant Jessen agreed with the prosecutor that he began to focus on\ndefendant to the exclusion of individuals mentioned by the defense because\ndefendant refused to supply the police with hair, saliva, and blood samples, and\nbecause in his mind, based on information he had received from laboratory\npersonnel, the individuals who had provided inadequate hair and fingerprint\nsamples were eliminated as donors of semen and fluids at the crime scene. It was\nnot until Jessen learned of a 1993 murder in Hawaii that he felt he had enough\nevidence to arrest defendant.\n\n        B. Second Penalty Phase9\n\n             1. Prosecution evidence\n       At the penalty retrial, the prosecution introduced much of the evidence from\nthe guilt phase. The prosecution also introduced evidence that defendant had\n\n\n9   As noted above, defendant‘s first penalty trial ended in a hung jury and mistrial.\n\n\n                                           23\n\fsuffered murder and sexual assault convictions in Hawaii and a burglary\nconviction in California.\n     N.T., a former girlfriend of defendant‘s, testified that she met defendant on\nMaui. One night in 1990, after their romantic relationship had ended, defendant,\nwho sounded drunk, called N.T. and asked to come over. N.T. said no. She later\nawoke to find defendant trying to insert a bottle into her vaginal and rectal areas.\nShe ordered defendant out of the house.\n     Orange County Sheriff‘s Deputy Timothy Martin testified that on July 8,\n1997, in the Orange County Men‘s Central Jail, he observed defendant sharpen a\nshank and hand it to another inmate.\n     Kathryn Valentine testified regarding the friendship with her mother that she\nhad lost when Deeble was murdered, and the guilt she felt for bringing defendant\ninto her family. She also testified regarding several family photographs. Lorraine\nJohnston, Deeble‘s sister, testified that she was eight years older than Deeble, and\nlike a mother to Deeble when she was an infant. They were close as adults, spoke\noften on the telephone, and visited each other. Because of Deeble‘s murder,\nJohnston had been physically ill, had been through counseling, and had seen a\ntrauma therapist.\n\n           2. Defense evidence\n     Fifty witnesses, including defendant, testified for the defense or their\ntestimony was read into the record. Much of the evidence from the defense\nportion of the guilt phase was introduced.\n\n               a. Testimony of defendant and other character witnesses\n     Defendant testified that in 1983, he was convicted of second degree burglary\nin Los Angeles County after breaking into a vehicle. Around November 1988, he\nwas convicted of taking or driving an automobile without the consent of the\n\n\n\n                                          24\n\fowner. In 1993, he was convicted of the second degree murder and sexual assault\nof Muriel Delbecq in Hawaii, and was currently serving five consecutive life\nsentences in that case. He had never been sentenced for a violent act before his\nHawaii sentence. In about September 1996, defendant was written up for heroin\nuse in the Orange County jail.\n     At times, defendant feared for his life at the jail. The ―worst time‖ was the\nsummer of 1997 when racial tensions were exacerbated. Defendant saw an\nindividual who had received medical treatment after his face was slashed. After\nthat incident, defendant tried to make the shank described by Deputy Martin.\nDefendant reasoned that if an aggressor knew he was armed, he would be less\nlikely to attack defendant. He did not plan to be an aggressor and assault anyone\nwith the weapon. In defendant‘s approximately nine years of incarceration, he had\nnever been written up for weapon possession before.\n     Defendant‘s father was a pilot in the Army, and served two tours of duty in\nVietnam. Defendant moved frequently as a child – living in California, Florida,\nGeorgia, and Puerto Rico – because of his father‘s work. When defendant was\nyoung, his father would strike him with his fist. He once knocked defendant out\nof his chair and drew blood because defendant had missed a number while\ncounting. Defendant‘s father drank heavily, and became increasingly abusive as\nhe drank more.\n     Defendant first got drunk when he was about eight years old. Defendant‘s\nparents separated when he was about 11 or 12 while the family was living in\nPuerto Rico. Defendant, his mother, and his siblings returned to Long Beach,\nwhere they had close relatives. Defendant‘s mother worked and attended night\nschool. Defendant began to skip school, and dropped out of school in the eighth\ngrade. He abused alcohol and drugs.\n\n\n\n                                         25\n\f     After his parents‘ separation, defendant had no contact with his father for\nseveral years. In about the summer of 1992, the two began communicating. In\nDecember 1992, defendant‘s father sent him a Christmas card, and signed it\n―Love, Dad,‖ something he had not done for years. Defendant‘s father died on\nDecember 19, 1992, in a plane crash. Defendant subsequently suffered bouts of\ndepression.\n     Defendant had experienced alcoholic blackouts, and described some of those\nexperiences. At the time of Deeble‘s death, defendant was heavily abusing drugs\nand alcohol. Defendant was not in an alcoholic blackout when he committed\nburglary in 1983, or when he made the shank.\n     In about November 1989, defendant moved to Maui, Hawaii to be with his\nsister Elena and to stop his drug abuse. He attended Narcotics Anonymous (NA)\nand Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings, remained drug and alcohol free for\nseven or eight months, and worked for a roofing company. He then began to use\ndrugs again and became homeless.\n     Defendant‘s son, Robert Mark Edwards, Jr. (―Robbie‖), was born on January\n23, 1985. Defendant described his efforts since 1985 to visit with his son and to\ncommunicate with him by telephone and letters. Defendant had counseled his son\nto refrain from using drugs, and was proud that his son had refused offers to try\nthem. Robbie had also sought his father‘s advice in other matters, and shared his\nachievements with his father. Defendant did not want Robbie to testify on his\nbehalf in part because he did not want him to feel ―maybe he said the wrong thing\nor something like that.‖\n     Defendant enjoyed reading while incarcerated, including books on parenting\nand spirituality. He had also written several short stories for Robbie. While\nincarcerated in Hawaii, he had attended GED classes and assisted other inmates\nwith their schoolwork. Defendant also enjoyed art, and some of his work was\n\n                                         26\n\fshown to the jury. He had participated in NA and AA meetings while in custody,\nand encouraged others who were not in custody to stay sober. Defendant could\nnot guarantee that he would not be under the influence of drugs or alcohol while in\nprison, but said, ―My sobriety I take one day at a time.‖\n     Defendant testified that he now believed he had killed Deeble and Delbecq,\nalthough he had no recollection of their murders. Defendant felt ―horrible,‖\nfasted, meditated, and prayed on the dates of the murders, and ―always pray[ed]\nfor the families.‖\n     Laura McFarland, defendant‘s mother, testified to many of the details in her\nguilt phase testimony. In addition, she testified she married defendant‘s father,\nWilliam Edwards, Sr., when she was 19 years old and had known him three\nmonths. At the time, Edwards was in the Marines. When defendant was born\nEdwards was a bartender and did not live at home. When defendant was about\none, Edwards joined the Army. Edwards was gone nearly all of the time from\ndefendant‘s birth until he was about 3 and a half years old.\n     After Edwards returned from being stationed abroad, his family joined him\nwhile he attended officers‘ candidate school in Georgia. Edwards was cruel to\ndefendant, who was about four, and struck him at least once or twice a week.\nMcFarland did not protect him from this abuse. Once, when defendant had a\nbowel movement during a bath, Edwards called him a ―filthy little boy,‖ and made\ndefendant pick up the stool and rub it over defendant‘s chest. Defendant began to\nhave night terrors. He said a puppet was trying to attack him, and described the\npuppet as wearing a sport coat similar to one his father had. Defendant had a G.I.\nJoe doll, and would leave it in the street and wait for cars to run over it. In\nDecember 1966, when defendant was about five and a half, Edwards left for\nVietnam.\n\n\n\n                                          27\n\f     When defendant was six, after his father returned from his first tour of duty\nin Vietnam, defendant regressed in his development. He would have bowel\nmovements in his pants, and if Edwards became aware of it, he would whip\ndefendant, and make him wash out his shorts in the bathtub. If Edwards\ndisapproved of a child‘s manners at the table, he would stab his or her hand with a\nfork. Once, when defendant was about 10 and had braces, Edwards punched him\nin the mouth, causing defendant‘s mouth to bleed and swell. Defendant frequently\nobserved his father physically abusing McFarland. McFarland never observed\nEdwards praise defendant for anything he had done, or be nurturing in any way.\n     Edwards was unfaithful, and would drive by the house with a girlfriend and\nwave to his children. He once introduced defendant‘s little sister Elena to a\nwoman he said was going to be her next mother.\n     After McFarland and Edwards divorced, Edwards told his children, ―[N]ow\nyou‘re out of my life and I‘ve never been so happy. Don‘t bother me.‖ After\nMcFarland left Edwards, she took defendant to a psychiatric clinic in Long Beach\n―off and on‖ for a ―long time.‖ At one point defendant went to live with his\nfather. Edwards was dissatisfied with everything defendant did, and sent him back\nto live with his mother. Defendant continued to try to establish a relationship with\nhis father until his father died, and was ―[a]bsolutely devastated‖ by his death.\n     McFarland described several incidents in which defendant had been kind to\nindividuals less fortunate than himself, and to stray animals.\n     McFarland testified that for some period of time she received substantial\nchild support. When Edwards married his second wife, he reduced McFarland‘s\nchild support so that she could no longer afford to stay at home, and she began to\nwork for a construction company. McFarland later married her current husband,\nJack McFarland, who assisted her in attending nursing school.\n\n\n\n                                         28\n\f     At the time of trial, McFarland had cared for defendant‘s son, Robbie, for\nabout four years. Once defendant was returned to California, he saw his son\nnearly every week, spoke to him on the telephone, and corresponded with him.\nDefendant took an active role in helping Robbie make decisions about his life, and\nwas nurturing, loving, and very proud of his son.\n     McFarland testified that if defendant were to be given a sentence of life\nimprisonment without the possibility of parole, his life would have value to her.\nShe begged the jury to spare her son‘s life.\n     Elena Edwards, defendant‘s sister, testified that their father was ―very scary,‖\nand would hit her brothers and was often verbally abusive to them. Their father\nstruck defendant about five times more than he struck defendant‘s brother. In\nElena‘s opinion, their father‘s behavior ―broke [defendant‘s] being before his\nbeing was established.‖\n     Elena had once been a substance abuser, but at the time of trial had been\nclean and sober for eight years. She found a new way of life at NA in Hawaii, and\nencouraged defendant to move there. Defendant did so, and began attending NA\nand AA meetings. After defendant was arrested in Hawaii, Elena visited him in\njail every weekend. During one visit, defendant looked down and told Elena, ―[I]f\nI did do this, I don‘t ever want to get out.‖ Elena and defendant were still close at\nthe time of trial.\n     Ana Guthridge, defendant‘s aunt, knew defendant as a child. Defendant was\na sweet little boy, very quiet and gentle, who was often overlooked because he was\nwell-behaved.\n     Scott Deeble, Marjorie Deeble‘s son, testified that at the time of his mother‘s\ndeath, he was a pilot in the Marine Corps. His mother‘s death was a huge loss.\nDeeble felt compassion for defendant, and said that in the nearly 12 years since his\n\n\n\n                                         29\n\fmother‘s death, he had learned, ―I cannot appreciate the ecstasy of my joy if I do\nnot embrace the depth of my grief. I have learned the big lesson in forgiveness.‖\n     Bridget Briggs testified she was a childhood friend of defendant‘s sister\nElena, and met defendant when she was about 11 years old and defendant was\nabout 18 years old. When defendant arrived at the Orange County jail in 1994, he\ntold Briggs that he ―didn‘t remember doing any of the things that they were saying\nthat he did. But if he did, . . . he should be punished accordingly.‖\n     Linda Lauer testified that she met defendant in late 1989 or early 1990 while\nshe was working on a research project for the Hawaii Department of Health.\nLauer was a community health outreach worker trying to prevent the spread of\nAIDS by educating and assessing intravenous drug users and their sexual partners.\nGetting intravenous drug users to answer a lengthy questionnaire was difficult\nbecause ―of the nature of I.V. drug users and the illegal things they do.‖\nDefendant was the first person to agree to be interviewed. Lauer interviewed\ndefendant at his apartment one evening, and did not feel threatened or vulnerable.\nDefendant appeared to be clean and sober, and responded thoughtfully to deeply\npersonal questions. He then encouraged others to participate, and ―it opened up\nthe project for us on Maui.‖\n     Craig Furtado, a roofing contractor on Maui, met defendant when Furtado\nlost his briefcase containing valuables at an airport on Maui. Defendant found the\nbriefcase, and called Furtado to return it to him. When the two met, nothing was\nmissing from the briefcase, and defendant refused a reward. Furtado subsequently\nhired defendant in his business for about five months. Defendant worked hard,\nwas prompt and honest, and got along with everyone. Despite his two murder\nconvictions, Furtado would hire defendant again if he had the opportunity.\n     Geraldine Jakeway testified she met defendant on Maui in about 1992.\nJakeway was in a wheelchair, and often swam at the beach. On one occasion,\n\n                                         30\n\fwhen no lifeguards were present to carry her into the water, she asked a group of\nindividuals if anyone could assist her. Defendant immediately volunteered, and\nalso assisted Jakeway out of the water when she was done swimming. Jakeway\nsaw defendant on other occasions at the beach when he again assisted her in and\nout of the water.\n     William Farmer testified he met defendant in 1989 on Maui at an NA dance.\nThey immediately became friends, and Farmer hired defendant to perform\nconstruction. Defendant was a religious person, and a loyal and hard worker. For\nsix to 12 months in 1992, defendant lived in Farmer‘s home. Farmer asked\ndefendant to leave one night when he came home drunk, which was against the\nhouse rules. Defendant did not appear to be the same person, and Farmer felt\nthreatened. The following morning, defendant returned to the house in a sober\nstate, and had no recollection of the night before. He appeared surprised when\nFarmer informed him he was not welcome in the home.\n     Albert Terry met and became close friends with defendant in 1989 while\nparticipating in AA and NA programs. Defendant was a loving, caring, and\nrespectful person. Terry visited the Maui Community Correctional Center to assist\nin AA meetings while defendant was incarcerated there. Defendant participated in\nthe meetings, and appeared to be sincere in his comments about drug and alcohol\nabuse. Terry believed defendant would be of benefit to other recovering addicts in\na custodial setting.\n     Orange County Sheriff‘s Deputy Robert Taft testified he worked at the\nOrange County jail. On two different occasions he was assigned to the\nadministrative segregation area in which defendant was housed. He never saw\ndefendant act disrespectfully to any deputies or have problems with any inmates.\n     Orange County Sheriff‘s Deputy Matthew Johnson testified he worked at the\nOrange County jail while defendant was incarcerated there. He wrote up\n\n                                        31\n\fdefendant once for possession of contraband, which consisted of extra clothing\nand pictures on the wall. Johnson otherwise observed that defendant followed the\njail rules, was respectful toward and communicated well with Johnson, and got\nalong with the other inmates.\n     Sergeant Robert Morris worked at the Maui Community Correctional Center,\nand testified that defendant was an ―ideal inmate‖ who was respectful to guards,\nnever gave ―anybody problems,‖ kept his cell clean and neat, and was helpful to\nnew inmates. Defendant had no ―write-ups‖ on Morris‘s watch, which was\nunusual for an inmate. During the time defendant was there, there were two\nescape attempts. Both times the individuals who escaped were in defendant‘s\nhousing area, but he did not go with them. Defendant enjoyed drawing, and\nattended NA and AA meetings and church services while incarcerated.\n     Sergeant Herbert Aguiar, who worked at the Maui Community Correctional\nCenter, testified that when defendant first came to the facility, he was dirty, very\nthin, had long hair, and his eyes were always moving like he was trapped\nsomewhere. Aguiar was leery of him, and his first impression was ―dirt bag.‖\nDefendant then started cleaning himself up, got a haircut, and started filling out.\nAguilar described defendant as a ―model inmate,‖ whom he had never seen be\ndisrespectful to anyone. Defendant engaged in many activities at the facility,\nincluding beginning work on his GED.\n     Reverend Diane Winter, a ministerial counselor, met defendant while\nconducting classes and counseling inmates in the Maui Community Correctional\nCenter. Defendant took classes with Winter, and was respectful, kind, and\ninterested in learning. Winters perceived defendant as genuine and not\nmanipulative in class. Winters had observed defendant with his girlfriend, Janice\nHunt, and he was kind, respectful, and loving. Winters said that defendant had\ncried sometimes and been very depressed. There were numerous occasions on\n\n                                          32\n\fwhich defendant felt a lot of pain, and sometimes he would break down and cry\nbecause he said he did not remember what he had done. Defendant said that if he\nhad killed Delbecq, he was a ―monster.‖ He also said, ―if I had done that . . . it is\nhorrible, I shouldn‘t be allowed to live in society.‖ Defendant would ask Winter\n―to pray for the family,‖ and ―we would pray together, and he would cry.‖\nDefendant took full responsibility for his addiction, and did not offer drugs and\nalcohol as an excuse for his situation. Defendant was respectful and kind to\nguards and staff at the jail, and helpful to other inmates. During her years working\nin a jail setting, Winters had been asked 80-90 times to testify on a prisoner‘s\nbehalf. She had only testified about four or five times, including once before for\ndefendant.\n     Karen Phaneuf, an adult educator, testified she taught defendant in GED\nclasses at the Maui Community Correctional Center. Defendant was friendly and\nhelpful. He had a ―great mind,‖ and was interested in reading at a much higher\nlevel than a GED. Most of the students other than defendant were working at a\nvery remedial level, and defendant would assist Phaneuf with those students so\nthat they could pass their GED exam. Defendant was not shackled or handcuffed\nduring class, but Phaneuf had no fear of him. Defendant was always cordial to\nother inmates, as well as to custodial officers who would walk though the\nclassroom, and was a calming influence in the classroom. Phaneuf had\ncorresponded with defendant since he left Maui, and assisted him on several\nstories defendant had written. She described defendant as a ―gifted writer.‖\n     Dominic Bagarozzi testified he met defendant while they were both\nincarcerated at the Orange County jail in about August 1994. Bagarozzi agreed\nwith counsel that at that time Bagarozzi was ―a bad guy who had given up,‖ and\nwho had a drug problem. Bagarozzi and defendant were day room partners in\nadministrative segregation, and knowing defendant made Bagarozzi a better\n\n                                          33\n\fperson and changed his outlook on life. Bagarozzi had appeared on television and\nin film as a child, and wanted to return to that profession, but did not think it was\n―cool.‖ Defendant told him he could do anything he wanted to do, and while he\ncould be a convict and stay in prison for the rest of his life, ―it would be more of a\nchallenge to try to achieve my goals.‖ Bagarozzi was now out of jail, and in the\npast few months had appeared on Ally McBeal, a television pilot with Sam Elliott,\nand in a television commercial. Jean Bagarozzi, Dominic‘s mother, testified that\nwhen her son went to jail, he was a drug addicted, angry, and immature person.\nAfter he was placed in administrative segregation and met defendant, he began to\n―talk sense,‖ and Jean heard about defendant and the advice he gave her son.\nDominic followed defendant‘s advice, and was now an employed, mature, and\ndrug-free person.\n     Charles Quesnel testified he met defendant in February 1993 while\nincarcerated in Hawaii. Quesnel had a history of drug and alcohol abuse, and\ndefendant encouraged him to attend AA and NA meetings, and a self-awareness\nclass. As a result of defendant‘s influence, Quesnel, who had previously been in\nand out of custody apparently because of his drug usage, had been clean for over\nfive years.\n     Jimmy Ekstrom testified he met defendant in March 1993 while serving six\nmonths for vehicular manslaughter in the Maui Community Correctional Center.\nEkstrom had never been in custody before, and was frightened. Defendant talked\nto him about how to get along with other inmates and the guards, and had his sister\nElena give Ekstrom money so that he could purchase items at the jail store.\nDefendant also encouraged Ekstrom to attend GED classes, and helped him with\nthe assignments.\n     Mark White testified that he met defendant while he was incarcerated on\nMaui pending trial on a robbery charge. When White arrived, he went through\n\n                                          34\n\fwithdrawal from heroin and cocaine. After he was brought to the general\npopulation he was still sick, and defendant would talk to him, bring him sweets\nwhich White craved, and share cigarettes. Defendant also helped White get along\nwith the other inmates. White never saw defendant argue with anyone, and he\nonce was able to calm an aggressive inmate who was upset at White. Defendant\nencouraged White to attend NA and AA meetings. White was struck at the\nmeetings by how defendant shared from his heart his experiences, and White\nsubsequently continued his involvement in the NA and AA programs when he\nwent to prison.\n     Lynn Pendzik, a retired schoolteacher, testified she began to correspond with\ndefendant while he was incarcerated in the Maui Community Correctional Center.\nAfter several months, defendant asked her to visit, and the two became friends.\nOnce while defendant was on trial in Hawaii he refused a visit with Pendzik.\nDefendant subsequently wrote to her: ―Remember during the trial when it was at\nthe most horrible testimony? You came up that weekend and I refused your visit.\nDo you know why I did that? I did it because I was utterly appalled by what they\nhad shown in court and that I was responsible for it. And I hated myself, and I felt\nthat you certainly must hate me. I was ashamed and I did not want to face you.‖\n\n                  b. Expert testimony\n     Dr. Roberta Falke, a clinical psychologist, testified that she was asked to\nobserve the nature of the relationship between defendant and his son Robbie, and\ndefendant‘s ability to parent effectively while incarcerated. Falke had visited\ndefendant in jail about every other week for two years. She had spent about 70\nhours with defendant, and 50 hours with Robbie. On four occasions Falke had\nalso taken Robbie to visit defendant and observed their interaction. Defendant and\nRobbie were separated by glass and spoke to each other on the telephone. In\n\n\n\n                                         35\n\faddition, Falke met with Laura and Jack McFarland, Robbie‘s grandmother and\nher husband and Robbie‘s custodians, defendant‘s sister Elena, Robbie‘s\nbiological mother Gina Stevens, and Gina‘s mother Bernice.\n     Dr. Falke believed defendant and Robbie had a strong relationship.\nDefendant knew a great deal about what Robbie was studying in school, what\nproblems he was having in school, and what his special needs were. Robbie had\nbeen attending the Sylvan Learning Center before Falke was hired, and defendant\nrequested that she meet with individuals there and take notes about what Robbie\nwas working on. Defendant then requested Falke facilitate contact between the\nSylvan tutors and Robbie‘s school teachers so they could coordinate their efforts.\nFalke became defendant‘s arms and legs in the community, and he ―constantly‖\nkept her running on issues concerning Robbie‘s academics.\n     Defendant was also concerned about Robbie‘s low self-esteem. He sought\nDr. Falke‘s advice as to what to say to Robbie when he made self-deprecating\nremarks, and Falke advised defendant about techniques for speaking with Robbie\nin other situations.\n     Dr. Falke opined that defendant was a ―remarkable‖ parent because of his\n―unflagging devotion.‖ ―[T]hat man put me to work for his son, and I barely got a\nbreak.‖ In her view, defendant was at the top of the list of individuals who were\nimportant to Robbie in terms of support systems, and it was essential their\nrelationship continue.\n     Dr. Kara Cross, a clinical psychologist and Robbie‘s therapist, testified that\nwhen she began to treat Robbie about three years earlier, when he was about 10,\nhe was very depressed, had learning disabilities, and had an adjustment disorder.\nThe treatment plan was to incorporate Robbie‘s relationship with defendant, which\nwas the ―strength‖ in Robbie‘s life that affected him the most, and use that\nrelationship to help Robbie overcome depression and learn better coping skills.\n\n                                         36\n\fCross gave Robbie assignments to complete with defendant from workbooks\ndesigned to improve psychosocial communication within a family. Defendant\nwould frequently telephone Cross and tell her how he had addressed a particular\nassignment and ask if he had done it correctly and how he could do it better next\ntime. Although contact visits were generally not allowed, Cross was able to\narrange a 30-minute contact visit between defendant and Robbie. After that visit,\nRobbie was a changed child; he was animated and would reach out and touch\nothers in a teasing manner. Cross opined that defendant‘s relationship with\nRobbie was the ―bedrock of Robbie‘s emotional stability,‖ and that it was vital\nthat the relationship continue.\n     Father John McAndrew, a Roman Catholic priest, testified that he was a\nrecovering alcoholic, and about a third of his ministerial time was devoted to\nworking with individuals in recovery. McAndrew testified that blackouts are often\nsymptomatic of the disease of addiction. McAndrew had experienced alcoholic\nblackouts, and was ashamed of things he was told he had done during them.\n     Father McAndrew knew defendant, and had visited him many times at the\nOrange County jail. McAndrew gave defendant assignments to complete with\nregard to a 12-step program, and was defendant‘s only regular contact for an\nalcohol or drug recovery program. McAndrew was aware that about a year and a\nhalf earlier defendant had been found to be under the influence of heroin in jail. It\nis much harder to return to a recovery program after a relapse, and so when an\nindividual returned, that told McAndrew ―there is a willingness there.‖\nMcAndrew found defendant inspirational, and believed he had ―an awful lot to\noffer to other people in recovery.‖\n     Dr. Stalcup testified as a specialist in addiction medicine in a manner similar\nto his testimony at the guilt phase. In addition, he testified that a blackout is\nreferred to as ―anterograde amnesia,‖ which means that ―from the time of onset of\n\n                                          37\n\fthe drug until the time the drug effect wears off, there is no recording in memory\nof the events that happened during that time.‖ ―[T]here‘s immediate memory,‖\nand ―[t]hen you have long-term memory, which is where thing are stored. There is\na transfer step, and alcohol and tranquilizers and barbiturates block the transfer\nstep. So immediate memory is happening, but it‘s not written down in permanent\nmemory.‖ Acts performed during a blackout are immediately remembered and\nintentionally done, such as walking down a beach, seeing the waves, and hearing a\nseal bark, but are not recorded. In mild blackouts, individuals have brief images in\ntheir mind of what they were doing. In moderate blackouts, individuals wake up\nthe next day and cannot remember what they did the previous day. In severe\nblackouts, individuals cannot remember what they are doing now. Generally, to\nhave a blackout, one has to drink enough to appear and know one is intoxicated.\nDr. Stalcup also agreed with the prosecutor that there are individuals who would\ntry to counter dysphoria by sexually causing suffering in others.\n\n           3. Rebuttal evidence\n     Dr. Park Dietz, a clinical professor of psychiatry and biobehavioral sciences\nat the University of California at Los Angeles School of Medicine, testified. He\nhad reviewed defendant‘s testimony in this case, crime scene and witness reports\nof the crimes, witness and background statements, and crime scene and autopsy\nphotographs from the Deeble and Delbecq homicides. An alcohol blackout is the\nterm ―used to refer to loss of memory during periods of intense drinking,\nespecially among people who are very heavy chronic alcohol users. A blackout is\na period of time ―for which an individual no longer has the memory because while\nthey were doing what they were doing, their brain did not permanently record the\ninformation into‖ long-term memory. Assuming defendant committed both\nmurders, and that he now had no memory of either homicide because of the effect\n\n\n\n                                         38\n\fof alcohol, this would mean that he ―is now in a blackout for both homicides.‖\nDr. Dietz added, ―But it doesn‘t tell us anything about his mental state at the time\nof the homicides except that he was drunk.‖ He also opined, ―looking at what\nhappened in each homicide, . . . that shows if intoxicated he wasn‘t too intoxicated\nto engage in a very orderly sequence of complicated behaviors.‖ These included\nthe ―things done to gain access to each victim, to do things to the victims and their\nproperty and to leave the scene.‖ Dr. Dietz agreed with the prosecutor that ―the\nblackout does not affect his mental state while he was perpetuating the acts,‖\nnoting that the ―blackout doesn‘t begin until later.‖ The blackout ―begins at least\nseconds after each action, maybe minutes, but the blackout is what he is later in. It\nis not something he is in while he is doing it.‖ Dr. Dietz agreed with the\nprosecutor that ―the blackout simply means that short-term memory has not been\nrecorded into long-term memory.‖ Dr. Dietz stated: ―[A]s he is committing the\nhomicides, . . . he is behaving intentionally [and] voluntarily. He knows where he\nis, what he is doing, who he is with, why he is engaging in each action, what he\nwants to do next, which things please him and which things don‘t. . . . Now, he\nmay not know what he did five minutes ago or ten minutes ago. He may be in a\nblackout already for those. But for what he just did and what he is going to do\nnext, he is not in any blackout at all. He is right there in the present tense in the\nmoment doing as he pleases.‖ Dr. Dietz agreed with the prosecutor that the\ncircumstance that defendant placed a comforter over Delbecq‘s window\ndemonstrated that ―at that moment he knows what he is doing is wrong. He is\ntrying to hide it from the outside world.‖\n\n\n\n\n                                          39\n\f                                     II. DISCUSSION\n\n       A. Pretrial Issues\n\n           1. Asserted Wheeler error\n     Defendant contends that the prosecutor exercised a peremptory challenge in a\ndiscriminatory manner to exclude a Black prospective juror in violation of his\nrights under the Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the federal\nConstitution, and article I, section 16 of the state Constitution. (Batson v.\nKentucky (1986) 476 U.S. 79, 89; People v. Wheeler (1978) 22 Cal.3d 258, 272,\n276-277.) We agree with the trial court that defendant made no prima facie\nshowing that Prospective Juror M.M. was challenged because of her race.\n\n               a. Factual background\n     On Prospective Juror M.M.‘s questionnaire, when asked her general feelings\nabout the death penalty, she responded: ―I‘ve thought about it on a personal level\nwithout coming to a conclusion as to whether society should or should not have\nthe death penalty. As the law now states we have it so therefore I am prepared to\nobey the law of the land. On a personal level I will continue to ponder.‖ On voir\ndire, the prosecutor read part of this response, and asked M.M., ―Have you\nresolved that issue in your own mind since you [have] been here the last few\ndays?‖ She responded, ―Not really.‖ The prosecutor asked no other questions and\npassed M.M. for cause. The defense accepted the panel, and the prosecutor\nexercised a peremptory challenge against M.M.\n     Defense counsel made a Wheeler motion. Counsel stated that Prospective\nJuror M.M. was Black, there appeared to be only two Black prospective jurors in\nthe panel, and only one Black woman, who was Prospective Juror M.M. He also\nobserved that M.M. ―clearly passed for cause.‖ The court found no prima facie\n\n\n\n\n                                          40\n\fcase of discrimination, stating that it had not seen anything to indicate the\nprosecutor excused the prospective juror because of her race.\n\n                b. Analysis\n     The use of peremptory challenges to exclude prospective jurors based on race\nviolates both the federal and state Constitutions. (People v. Bonilla (2007) 41\nCal.4th 313, 341 (Bonilla).) ―There is a rebuttable presumption that a peremptory\nchallenge is being exercised properly, and the burden is on the opposing party to\ndemonstrate impermissible discrimination.‖ (Ibid.) To do so, the following\nprocedure applies: ―First, the defendant must make out a prima facie case ‗by\nshowing that the totality of the relevant facts gives rise to an inference of\ndiscriminatory purpose.‘ [Citations.] Second, once the defendant has made out a\nprima facie case, the ‗burden shifts to the State to explain adequately the racial\nexclusion‘ by offering permissible race-neutral justifications for the strikes.\n[Citations.] Third, ‗[i]f a race-neutral explanation is tendered, the trial court must\nthen decide . . . whether the opponent of the strike has proved purposeful racial\ndiscrimination.‘ ‖ (Johnson v. California (2005) 545 U.S. 162, 168.) Although\nthe trial court here used the since disapproved ―strong likelihood‖ standard,\n―[r]egardless of the standard employed by the trial court,‖ we independently\nreview the record and determine whether it ―supports an inference that the\nprosecutor excused a juror on the basis of race.‖ (People v. Cornwell (2005) 37\nCal.4th 50, 73.)\n     Here, to establish a prima facie case, defense counsel merely asserted that\nProspective Juror M.M. was Black, and that there appeared to be only one other\n\n\n\n\n                                          41\n\fBlack prospective juror.10 That is insufficient. (People v. Box (2000) 23 Cal.4th\n1153, 1188-1189; see People v. Bell (2007) 40 Cal.4th 582, 598, fn. 3 (Bell).)\n     On appeal, defendant asserts that the prosecutor asked Prospective Juror\nM.M. a single question. Under certain circumstances perfunctory voir dire can be\nindicative of hidden bias. (Bell, supra, 40 Cal.4th at p. 598.) Here, however, the\nprosecutor‘s question focused on M.M.‘s ambivalence about the death penalty,\nwhich she confirmed on voir dire remained unresolved. Contrary to defendant‘s\nassertion, this inquiry does not constitute ―powerful circumstantial evidence that\nthe challenge was exercised upon a prohibited race basis.‖ Moreover, before voir\ndire, M.M. had completed a 14-page questionnaire containing 38 questions with\nsubparts. (People v. Dement (2011) 53 Cal.4th 1, 20-21 (Dement) [relying on\ncircumstance that before voir dire, the prosecutor had reviewed a 21-page\nquestionnaire containing 87 questions with subparts filled out by each prospective\njuror to reject claim that the prosecutor‘s limited or no individual questioning of\nchallenged prospective jurors created an inference of discrimination]; Bell, supra,\n40 Cal.4th at pp. 598-599, fn. 5 [noting the trial court‘s comment that ― ‗when you\nhave a questionnaire, it can never be a perfunctory examination‘ ‖].) ―Under these\ncircumstances, we place little weight on the prosecutor‘s failure to . . . more\nthoroughly question a prospective juror before exercising a peremptory\nchallenge.‖ (Dement, at p. 21.)\n     Defendant also asserts that the prosecutor‘s single question to Prospective\nJuror M.M. must be contrasted with the prosecutor‘s more detailed questions to\n\n\n10 As defendant acknowledges, neither the racial composition of the jury as sworn\nnor the exact number of Black prospective jurors is in the record. Indeed, the day\nafter defendant‘s Wheeler motion, the trial court observed that there were ―at least\nfour, maybe more‖ Black prospective jurors, and told defense counsel, ―I don‘t\nknow where you got two from.‖\n\n\n                                         42\n\fCaucasian prospective jurors. The racial identity of each prospective juror is not\nin the record. Moreover, although it is true that the prosecutor questioned some\nprospective jurors at greater length than he did M.M., he also engaged in\nperfunctory questioning of other prospective jurors, and at times declined to ask\nany questions at all. The record therefore provides no indication that there was\nany discernible racial pattern to the prosecutor‘s questioning.\n\n           2. Denial of motion to dismiss the panel\n     Defendant contends the trial court erroneously denied his motion to dismiss\nthe panel in violation of his rights under the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth\nAmendments to the federal Constitution, and article I, sections 15-17 of the state\nConstitution.11 We disagree.\n\n               a. Factual background\n     At the outset of Prospective Juror R.B.‘s voir dire, which was conducted in\nfront of other prospective jurors, the trial court observed that R.B. was a peace\nofficer, and asked, ―[C]an you be an objective juror in this type of case?‖ R.B.\nanswered: ―I am very fair. I can be objective, but . . . I am a correctional peace\nofficer, so . . . I know a lot of murderers. I have dealt with a lot of people who\nhave been convicted of murders, and I have seen a lot of people who are there . . .\n\n\n11  In this and certain other appellate claims defendant contends the asserted error\ninfringed upon his constitutional rights. ―In those instances where he did not\npresent constitutional theories below, it appears that either (1) the appellate claim\nis one that required no objection to preserve it, or (2) the new arguments are based\non factual or legal standards no different from those the trial court was asked to\napply, but raise the additional legal consequence of violating the Constitution. ‗To\nthat extent, defendant‘s new constitutional arguments are not forfeited on appeal.‘\n(People v. Boyer (2006) 38 Cal.4th 412, 441, fn. 17.) No separate constitutional\ndiscussion is required, or provided, when rejection of a claim on the merits\nnecessarily leads to rejection of any constitutional theory or ‗gloss‘ raised for the\nfirst time here.‖ (People v. Loker (2008) 44 Cal.4th 691, 704, fn. 7.)\n\n\n                                          43\n\ffor death or 25 to life. And since I think I filled the questionnaire out . . . I sit at\nnighttime thinking about it. I deal with all these people, and . . . they are hard to\ndeal with if they just have life, you know, because they are still affecting\npeople. . . . [T]here are still victims inside correctional institutes . . . and prisons.\nBut I see there are some people that can be in for life and they are fine, you know.\nIt is hard because I have to deal with it. The thing we just had a few weeks ago\nsomeone in for 25 to life that beat one of us officers to death.‖\n     The trial court asked if the incident happened inside the California Youth\nAuthority (CYA), and Prospective Juror R.B. responded: ―Yeah, out there in\nChino. So that is hard to deal with because I think that gentleman, young man, he\nis 24, 25, he . . . beat someone to death. So there is another victim he created\nwhile he was in. So it is hard to say, but I could make that decision. . . . I don‘t\nknow what else to really say. I would have to listen to everything, hear\neverything. And if . . . he is found guilty, then it would be hard not to go for the\ndeath penalty, very hard because again I see the people that are locked up. I deal\nwith hundreds of them that are in for life, and I know what it is like in there. And\nI know that it is a lot easier than these people know . . . it is not as bad as what\nthese people think it is.‖\n     The trial court said, ―[T]hat is a different view.‖ Prospective Juror R.B.\ncontinued, ―See, I am in there. I am locked up every day with them, and what\nsociety sees and what people. . . .‖ The trial court then cut R.B. off and said,\n―Let‘s stay to the bottom line. Can you be an objective juror in this case if you get\nto a penalty phase?‖ R.B. answered that he would have to listen to everything.\nWhen asked if he could conceive of voting for life imprisonment without the\npossibility of parole in this case, R.B. assured the court, ―I would have to listen to\nthe attorneys. I wouldn‘t say I would automatically jump to [a] conclusion. I\ndon‘t jump to conclusions.‖ The trial court said: ―There is another problem. One,\n\n                                            44\n\fwe‘re not talking about the California Youth Authority here. We are talking about\nother places. And it wouldn‘t be proper for you to educate the jurors in the jury\nroom what it is like to be incarcerated in a state prison. I know what the Youth\nAuthority is, okay? I am not educating the jury either. [B]ut do you understand\nwhat I am saying? You would have to keep those thoughts to yourself?‖ R.B.\nsaid, ―Exactly.‖\n     Subsequently, outside the presence of the prospective jurors, defense counsel\nmoved to excuse the entire jury venire based on Prospective Juror R.B.‘s\nstatements regarding experiences in the CYA, and ―what he knows about life\nwithout the possibility of parole.‖ He asserted, ―He basically said to them that\nLWOP isn‘t what these people think; I know it is not that hard.‖ The trial court\nsaid: ―First of all, you have no basis upon which to base your conclusion that\nanybody has been tainted or even that anybody understood. I knew where he was\ngoing, and I shut him off. And then I told him that we‘re not talking about C.Y.A.\nWe are talking about other places. And that would be a quantum leap for jurors to\nthink that prison is like C.Y.A. Now, it is, but they don‘t know that. They would\nassume that C.Y.A. is for the kids, and that state prison is for the bad guys, and\nthere is harsher treatment in prison, I think your conclusion is wrong. And absent\nsome showing, which means if you want to bring it up, I will probably permit\nsome limit[ed] question[ing] in that regard and we can even do it one on one. I\ndon‘t see a problem. I would be afraid about bringing attention to it —‖ Defense\ncounsel said, ―That is our concern, too.‖ The court responded, ―So that is a big\nconcern.‖ The trial court denied the motion to excuse the entire panel. Defense\ncounsel then moved to excuse Prospective Juror R.B., and the court granted the\nmotion.\n     That afternoon, the defense submitted a proposed admonition. Defense\ncounsel requested that any questioning of prospective jurors would be done in\n\n                                         45\n\fprivate, and the court agreed. The proposed admonition was modified by the court\nafter discussion with counsel. The following admonition was given to the panel:\n―This morning you may recall hearing a prospective juror [R.B.], who was sitting\nin seat No. 3 . . . express some of his opinions and experiences as a counselor at\nthe California Youth Authority. The custodial facilities for minors are far\ndifferent than those for adults. [R.B.] has no experience as a custodial officer in\nthe adult state prison system or with adult life without possibility of parole\nprisoners. The purpose of incarceration in a state prison for crime is punishment.\nDo any of you have any question regarding [R.B.‘s] statement? If so, please raise\nyour hand? Anybody with a hand. Do any of you wish to comment on [R.B.‘s]\nstatement, please raise your hand. How many of you don‘t recall what he said,\nplease raise your hand. Okay. Several . . . hands went up, and no hand went up\nfor the questions.‖ Prospective Juror J.D. indicated that she had a comment. The\ncourt told her: ―We are going to talk to you. We are going to do it in private.‖\nThe court then told the entire panel: ―Anybody else? If anything comes to mind,\njust let me know when you are called forward and we‘ll talk about it, but I want to\ntalk about it in private. That makes sense, doesn‘t it ladies and gentlemen? In any\nevent, for those of you who may recall what [R.B.] said, you are to disregard his\nstatement regarding his personal experiences.‖\n\n               b. Discussion\n     Defendant contends he was prejudiced by Prospective Juror R.B.‘s remarks\nbecause he in effect ―predicted that [defendant] might continue to pose a danger to\nothers if he was sentenced to life imprisonment‖ without the possibility of parole,\nand the remarks ―created a substantial danger that jurors would select the death\npenalty.‖ However, R.B.‘s comments occurred before the guilt phase, and a\ndifferent jury was impaneled for the second penalty phase. No prejudice at the\n\n\n\n                                          46\n\fsecond penalty phase was possible. Defendant further summarily contends that\n―the assumptions inherent in [R.B.‘s] remarks struck at the heart of the\npresumption of innocence and [the] prosecution‘s burden of proof.‖ It is not\napparent – and defendant does not explain – how R.B.‘s challenged remarks\nrelated to any issue at the guilt phase.\n     Defendant further contends the court erred in failing to ask the venire\nwhether ―there was a question or comment about its instruction or whether they\ncould disregard [Prospective Juror R.B.‘s] comments.‖ Defense counsel proposed\nthe instruction, and the trial court worked with both counsel at length in modifying\nit. At the end of the hearing, the trial court inquired, ―Any further comments on\nany requested admonition as modified?‖ Defense counsel responded, ―No, your\nhonor.‖ Defendant has therefore forfeited any claim that the instruction was\nincomplete. (See People v. Wilson (2008) 43 Cal.4th 1, 22.)\n     Defendant further contends the trial court erred in failing to ―conduct a\nhearing to exclude those jurors who overheard [Prospective Juror R.B.‘s] improper\nremarks and could not promise to ignore them during their deliberations.‖ The\ntrial court offered to allow limited questioning ―one on one‖ regarding R.B.‘s\ncomments, but noted it was concerned ―about bringing attention to it.‖ Defense\ncounsel responded, ―That is our concern, too.‖ Defense counsel subsequently\nrequested that prospective jurors with questions or comments be questioned in\nprivate. Defendant thus chose not to question every prospective juror regarding\nR.B.‘s remarks, and agreed to private examination of those who had comments or\nquestions. This claim is therefore forfeited.\n     Moreover, the trial court instructed the panel that Prospective Juror R.B‘s\nexperience was in a facility for minors that was ―far different than those for\nadults,‖ and that he had ―no experience as a custodial officer in the adult state\nprison system or with adult life without possibility of parole prisoners.‖ It further\n\n                                           47\n\finstructed the jury to disregard R.B.‘s comments, solicited any comments or\nquestions the prospective jurors might have about R.B.‘s remarks, and said ―[i]f\nanything comes to mind, just let me know when you are called forward and we‘ll\ntalk about it, but I want to talk about it in private.‖ This inquiry was sufficient to\nascertain whether the prospective jurors were free from bias after R.B.‘s remarks.\nFinally, as noted above, a different jury determined penalty.\n     Defendant also contends that the record does not reflect that Prospective\nJuror J.D. was ever questioned in camera. However, J.D. did not serve on the jury,\nso any comment she may have had could not have affected the verdict.\n\n       B. Guilt Phase Issues\n\n           1. Denial of mistrial motion\n     Defendant contends the trial court erred in denying defendant‘s motion for\nmistrial. We disagree.\n     During his opening statement, while discussing the Delbecq murder, the\nprosecutor said, ―In fact, when [defendant] was ultimately arrested for this —\nwhen [defendant] was found to be involved,‖ the police found certain evidence.\nAfter the prosecutor completed his opening statement, defendant moved for a\nmistrial outside the presence of the jury. Defense counsel stated, ―Not 10 minutes\nbefore [the prosecutor] delivered his opening statement I asked him if he was\ngoing to mention the fact of the defendant‘s arrest in Hawaii . . . and [the\nprosecutor] said no . . . because [he did not] think that that is relevant to anything\nin this case. And as we all know, arrest is just one step away from conviction.\nAnd this jury is not going to hear about the conviction. And during the opening\nstatement what does [the prosecutor] do? He mentions that the defendant was\narrested.‖ The court asked, ―How would this jury not figure that out sooner or\nlater?‖ Defense counsel replied that even if the jury figured it out, that was ―a far\n\n\n\n                                          48\n\fcry from someone telling them that.‖ The prosecutor said that he had in good faith\ntold defense counsel he would not bring up defendant‘s arrest, and that his\ncomment was inadvertent. The court denied the mistrial motion.\n     ― ‗A mistrial should be granted if the court is apprised of prejudice that it\njudges incurable by admonition or instruction. [Citation.] Whether a particular\nincident is incurably prejudicial is by its nature a speculative matter, and the trial\ncourt is vested with considerable discretion in ruling on mistrial motions.\n[Citation.]‘ [Citation.] A motion for a mistrial should be granted when ‗ ― ‗a\n[defendant‘s] chances of receiving a fair trial have been irreparably damaged.‘ ‖ ‘\n‖ (People v. Collins (2010) 49 Cal.4th 175, 198.) We conclude here that the\nprosecutor‘s use of the word ―arrest‖ — even if erroneous — was not ―so\nincurably prejudicial that a new trial was required.‖ (People v. Ledesma (2006)\n39 Cal.4th 641, 683.)\n     The prosecutor reference to defendant‘s arrest was brief and isolated. Indeed,\nthe prosecutor corrected himself midsentence and changed ―arrested‖ to\n―involved.‖ Moreover, the prosecutor contended during his opening statement that\ndefendant was linked to Delbecq‘s murder by the circumstance that his bloody\nfootprint and palm prints were found inside her bedroom. Hence, as the trial court\nobserved, the jury would already surmise defendant had been arrested for that\noffense. (See Dement, supra, 53 Cal.4th at p. 40 [witness‘s improper comment\n―largely duplicative of evidence the jury properly received‖].) In addition, the jury\nhad already been instructed that statements by the attorneys during the trial were\nnot evidence. Hence the trial court did not abuse its broad discretion in denying\nthe mistrial motion.\n\n\n\n\n                                          49\n\f           2. Challenge to pathologist’s testimony\n     Defendant contends the trial court prejudicially erred in allowing Dr. Richard\nFukumoto, a pathologist who did not perform Marjorie Deeble‘s autopsy, to testify\nat the guilt and second penalty phase regarding the autopsy report and his opinions\nbased on that report in violation of defendant‘s confrontation rights under the\nSixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the federal Constitution. (See ante, at pp. 3-\n7.) He further contends that even if Dr. Fukumoto‘s testimony was not wholly\ninadmissible, his opinions lacked foundation, and were unduly prejudicial. (Evid.\nCode, § 352.) We conclude these claims are without merit.\n\n               a. Factual background\n     Dr. Fukumoto worked at Richards, Fisher, Fukumoto Medical Group, Inc.\nThe medical group had a contract with the Orange County Sheriff‘s Department to\nperform autopsies in Orange County. Dr. Richards, who had performed Deeble‘s\n1986 autopsy and written an autopsy report, had since retired. The autopsy report\nwas signed, but not sworn or certified. The report itself was not admitted into\nevidence. Dwight Reed, a criminalist who worked for Orange County Sheriff-\nCoroner Forensic Sciences Services, attended the autopsy. In addition to\nreviewing the report, Dr. Fukumoto reviewed about 100 photographs of Deeble‘s\nbody, X-rays, and microscopic slides of organ tissues, generated as part of the\nautopsy.\n\n               b. Analysis\n\n                    1) Asserted Confrontation Clause Violation\n     The Attorney General asserts that defendant has forfeited his confrontation\nclause claim because he failed to object on this ground at trial. We recently\nrejected a similar forfeiture claim, and for similar reasons do so again here.\n(People v. Pearson (2013) 56 Cal.4th 393, 461-462 [concluding that a defendant\nwho failed at a 1996 trial to challenge as a violation of the confrontation clause the\n\n                                         50\n\ftestimony of a substitute pathologist did not forfeit the claim on appeal].) In\nPeople v. Clark (1992) 3 Cal.4th 41 (Clark), this court rejected a confrontation\nclause challenge to the testimony of one pathologist based on the autopsy report of\na deceased pathologist. We held that the contents of the report ―were admitted\nunder a ‗firmly rooted‘ exception to the hearsay rule that carries sufficient indicia\nof reliability to satisfy the requirements of the confrontation clause.‖ (Id. at\np. 159; People v. Beeler (1995) 9 Cal.4th 953, 978-980 [same] (Beeler).) In light\nof Clark and Beeler, defendant‘s failure to object during his 1996 trial ―was\nexcusable, since governing law at the time . . . afforded scant grounds for\nobjection.‖ (People v. Johnson (2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 1409, 1411, fn. 2.)\n― ‗[W]e have excused a failure to object where to require defense counsel to raise\nan objection ―would place an unreasonable burden on defendants to anticipate\nunforeseen changes in the law and encourage fruitless objections in other\nsituations where defendants might hope that an established rule of evidence would\nbe changed on appeal.‖ ‘ ‖ (People v. Williams (1976) 16 Cal.3d 663, 667, fn. 4\n(Williams).) We therefore consider defendant‘s claim on the merits.\n     Since our decisions in Clark, supra, 3 Cal.4th 41 and Beeler, supra, 9 Cal.4th\n953, the United States Supreme Court held in Crawford v. Washington (2004) 541\nU.S. 36, 59-60 that admission of testimonial statements of a witness who was not\nsubject to cross-examination at trial violates a defendant‘s Sixth Amendment right\nof confrontation, unless the witness is unavailable and the defendant had a prior\nopportunity for cross-examination. More recently, in Williams v. Illinois (2012)\n__ U.S. __ [132 S.Ct. 2221], the high court in a fractured decision held the\nconfrontation clause is not violated when an expert witness testifies about the\nresults of DNA testing performed by nontestifying analysts whom the defendant\nhas had no opportunity to confront.\n\n\n\n                                          51\n\f     Following Williams v. Illinois, we held that the confrontation clause was not\nviolated when a testifying pathologist expressed forensic opinions on the basis of\nobjective medical observations derived from a nontestifying pathologist‘s autopsy\nreport and its accompanying photographs. (People v. Dungo (2012) 55 Cal.4th\n608, 621 (Dungo).) In Dungo, neither the autopsy report nor its accompanying\nphotographs were admitted into evidence. (Id. at p. 612.) We therefore concluded\nwe need not decide whether the entire report was testimonial, but could focus on\nthe testimonial nature of particular statements in the report, as described by the\ntestifying pathologist. (Id. at pp. 618-619.)\n     We noted in Dungo that ―[a]lthough the high court has not agreed on a\ndefinition of ‗testimonial,‘ testimonial out-of-court statements have two critical\ncomponents. First, to be testimonial the statement must be made with some\ndegree of formality or solemnity. Second, the statement is testimonial only if its\nprimary purpose pertains in some fashion to a criminal prosecution.‖ (Dungo,\nsupra, 55 Cal.4th at p. 619.)\n     Applying these standards to the autopsy evidence in Dungo, we noted that\nautopsy reports typically contain two types of statements, those that ―describ[e]\nthe [autopsy] pathologist‘s anatomical and physiological observations about the\ncondition of the body,‖ and those that ―set[ ] forth the [autopsy] pathologist‘s\nconclusions as to the cause of the victim‘s death.‖ (Dungo, supra, 55 Cal.4th at p.\n619.) The testifying pathologist in Dungo, we stressed, had described only\nautopsy statements in the first category, and had then supplied, on the basis of\nthose statements and his own examination of autopsy photos, his independent\nforensic opinions about the cause of the victim‘s death. (Id. at pp. 618-619.) He\nhad not described the conclusions in the autopsy report as to the cause of death.\nThus, we had no occasion to ―determine whether such testimony, if it had been\n\n\n\n                                         52\n\fgiven, would have violated defendant‘s right to confront‖ the autopsy\npathologist.12 (Id. at p. 619.)\n     Autopsy statements that simply record anatomical and physiological\nobservations, we indicated, are ―less formal‖ than statements of the autopsy\nphysician‘s expert forensic conclusion as to the cause of death. (Dungo, supra,\n55 Cal.4th at p. 619.) Statements in the former category, we observed, are\n―comparable to observations of objective fact in a report by a physician who, after\nexamining a patient, diagnoses a particular injury or ailment and determines the\nappropriate treatment. Such observations are not testimonial in nature.\n[Citation.]‖ (Id. at pp. 619-620.) A majority in Dungo further pointed out that the\nautopsy statements at issue were neither sworn nor certified for accuracy, and for\nthis additional reason they ―lacked the solemnity and formality that characterize\nstatements the high court deems testimonial.‖ (Id. at p. 623 (conc. opn. of\nWerdegar, J.).)\n     We also found the anatomical observations in the Dungo autopsy report to be\nnontestimonial under the ―primary purpose‖ test. (Dungo, supra, 55 Cal.4th at\np. 621, italics omitted.) We noted that California statutes require an autopsy in\ncertain types of death, only some of which are related to suspected criminal\nactivity. (Id. at p. 620.) Regardless of the circumstances, we explained, ―the\nscope of the coroner‘s statutory duty to investigate is the same‖ (ibid.), and the\nreport serves both forensic and nonforensic uses (id. at pp. 620-621). Hence, we\nconcluded, ―criminal investigation was not the primary purpose for the . . .\nreport‘s description of the condition of [the victim‘s] body; it was only one of\n\n12 Thus, although the concurring and dissenting opinion states that ―[t]here is no\ndebate that admission of testimony as to medical conclusions reached by a\nnontestifying expert would violate the confrontation clause,‖ we have never\ndecided this issue. (Conc. & dis. opn. of Corrigan, J., post, at p. 2.)\n\n\n                                         53\n\fseveral purposes.‖ (Id. at p. 621.) We pointed out that the report itself was, in\nessence, ―simply an official explanation of an unusual death, and such official\nrecords are ordinarily not testimonial. [Citation.]‖ (Ibid.)\n     Here, as in Dungo, Dr. Fukumoto recounted objective medical observations\nderived from Dr. Richards‘s autopsy report and its accompanying photographs,\nmicroscopic slides, and X-rays, and expressed opinions based on those\nobservations. Defendant implicitly concedes any confrontation clause challenge to\nthis portion of Dr. Fukumoto‘s testimony is foreclosed by Dungo, and offers no\npersuasive reason for us to revisit our conclusion in that case.13\n     Defendant contends, however, that his rights under the confrontation clause\nwere violated when Dr. Fukumoto recounted forensic opinions expressed by\nDr. Richards in the autopsy report. At the guilt phase Dr. Fukumoto opined that\nthe cause of Deeble‘s death was ―asphyxiation due to ligature strangulation,‖ and\nagreed with the prosecutor that this was consistent with Dr. Richards‘s opinion.\nDr. Fukumoto also agreed with the prosecutor that an autopsy photograph\nappeared to show ligature marks on Deeble‘s ankles (Deeble‘s legs were not\nbound when her body was discovered), and said that Dr. Richards described\nnearby lacerations on the right ankle also visible in the photograph ―as being\ncaused by the wires probably coming together and inflicting the injury.‖ The\nprosecutor asked if Dr. Fukumoto ―personally disagree[d] with that at all,‖ and Dr.\nFukumoto replied: ―No. It is consistent with that.‖ At the second penalty phase,\nDr. Fukumoto again opined that Deeble ―died as a result of asphyxiation due to a\n\n\n13 The author of the concurring and dissenting opinion, who also dissented in\nDungo, 55 Cal.4th at pages 633-649 (dis. opn. of Corrigan, J.), continues to urge\nhere that Dungo was wrongly decided. (Conc. & dis. opn. of Corrigan, J., post, at\npp. 1, 5, 10.) As indicated above, we are not persuaded to reconsider that recent\ncase.\n\n\n                                         54\n\fligature strangulation,‖ and agreed with the prosecutor this was consistent with Dr.\nRichards‘s opinion and that Dr. Fukumoto had formed his opinion independently.\n     Thus, even assuming these statements violated the confrontation clause, an\nissue we need not decide, no prejudice was possible under any standard. As can\nbe seen, Dr. Fukumoto independently agreed with Dr. Richards‘s opinions, and\nneither the cause of death nor the source of the lacerations on Deeble‘s ankle was\nin dispute at trial.14\n     Defendant contends that at the guilt phase Dr. Fukumoto also erroneously\nrecounted Dr. Richards‘s ―opinions‖ that the injury to Deeble‘s left ear was\n―incisional,‖ residue from adhesive tape was observed in an area from the mouth\nto the lower cheek, and Deeble‘s nose was fractured, and at the second penalty\nphase made similar statements regarding Dr. Richards‘s opinions of injury to\nDeeble‘s ear and the presence of adhesive tape. This testimony by Dr. Fukumoto\ndid not, however, recount Dr. Richards‘s forensic opinions as to the cause of\nDeeble‘s injury or death, but rather his medical observations of objective fact.\nThat a break appears ―incisional,‖ a nose appears to be broken, or residue appears\n\n14  The concurring and dissenting opinion asserts that Dr. Fukumoto also testified\nregarding Dr. Richards‘s forensic opinion that Deeble ―had suffered an incisional\ntear in her left eardrum, suggesting it had been caused by a sharp instrument.‖\n(Conc. & dis. opn. of Corrigan, J., post, at pp. 2-3, underlining in original.) In\nfact, Dr. Fukumoto testified that Dr. Richards had described ―a break on the left\near drum . . . as incisional in type.‖ Dr. Fukumoto then explained: ―[A]n incision\nto a forensic pathologist . . . . is not a tear. It is something that is caused by a sharp\ninstrument or an instrument that has a point.‖\n\nThe concurring and dissenting opinion suggests generally that Dungo’s distinction\nbetween an autopsy examiner‘s medical observations and the examiner‘s forensic\nconclusions is too indistinct to be workable. (Conc. & dis. opn. of Corrigan, J.,\npost, at pp. 1-2, 10.) For the reasons stated in Dungo, and demonstrated here, we\ndisagree.\n\n\n\n\n                                           55\n\fto be from adhesive tape, are expert medical observations of the body‘s condition\n– assessments like those a doctor would make to determine the proper treatment of\na live patient. (See Dungo, supra, 55 Cal.4th at p. 619.) Such testimony was no\ndifferent than, for example, Dr. Fukumoto‘s testimony regarding statements in the\nautopsy report that Deeble‘s stomach contained food that was virtually untouched\nby digestion, and that there was bruising and tearing just inside the opening to the\nvagina. Moreover, Dr. Fukumoto independently reviewed X-rays of Deeble‘s\nnose and testified that one X-ray showed ―somewhat flattening‖ that ―may reflect\nfracturing at the bridge of [the] nose,‖ and Dwight Reed, who attended the\nautopsy, testified that during the autopsy white adhesive material was observed on\nDeeble‘s left cheek.\n\n                    2) Claim Dr. Fukumoto’s testimony lacked foundation and\n                       was unduly prejudicial\n     Defendant contends that even if Dr. Fukumoto‘s testimony was not wholly\ninadmissible, his opinions that Deeble‘s injuries were extremely painful and\noccurred before death lacked foundation, were irrelevant, and were unduly\nprejudicial. (Evid. Code, §§ 352, 801.) This claim lacks merit.\n     Dr. Fukumoto opined that the ligature and struggling against it, the incisional\ninjury to Deeble‘s ear, and an amount of pressure sufficient to tear the ear drums\nwould all be extremely painful. He also agreed with the prosecutor that trauma to\nthe vaginal and rectal areas is ―highly painful,‖ and opined that the injuries to the\nvaginal and rectal areas occurred before death.\n     Adequate foundation for Dr. Fukumoto‘s opinions was provided by\nDr. Richards‘s autopsy report, photographs, and slides, as well as Dr. Fukumoto‘s\nmore than 30 years‘ experience as a forensic pathologist. (See People v. Taylor\n(2010) 48 Cal.4th 574, 588 [recounting testimony by deputy medical examiner and\ntreating cardiologist that elderly victim died from the extreme fear, pain, and stress\n\n\n                                          56\n\fcaused by the sexual assault]; People v. Linkenauger (1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 1603,\n1606 [noting medical examiner had opined that strangulation victim ―was acutely\naware of the pain before her death‖].) Contrary to defendant‘s assertion, Dr.\nFukumoto was not required to be the pathologist who performed the autopsy or\npossess a neurology background in order to testify regarding the painfulness of\nDeeble‘s injuries. Moreover, the jury was instructed that it was not bound to\naccept Dr. Fukumoto‘s opinions as conclusive, but was free to determine the\nweight to which they were entitled and to disregard the opinions if the jury found\nthem to be unreasonable. (§ 1127b.)\n     Defendant contends that Dr. Fukumoto‘s testimony was irrelevant because\nthe jury could draw its own conclusions about the painfulness of Deeble‘s injuries,\nand received ―no appreciable help from Dr. Fukumoto‘s opinion testimony.‖ He\ndid not object on this ground below, and the claim is therefore forfeited.\n(Williams, supra, 16 Cal.3d at p. 667, fn. 4 [―It is the general rule, of course, that\nquestions relating to the admissibility of evidence will not be reviewed on appeal\nabsent a specific and timely objection at trial on the ground sought to be urged on\nappeal.‖].) It also lacks merit. ―Evidence Code section 801 qualifies a matter as\nthe proper subject for expert testimony if it is ‗sufficiently beyond common\nexperience that the opinion of an expert would assist the trier of fact.‘ That is not\nto say, however, that the jury need be wholly ignorant of the subject matter of the\nexpert opinion in order for it to be admissible. [Citation.] Rather, expert opinion\ntestimony ‗ ―will be excluded only when it would add nothing at all to the jury‘s\ncommon fund of information, i.e., when ‗the subject of inquiry is one of such\ncommon knowledge that men of ordinary education could reach a conclusion as\nintelligently as the witness‘ ‖ [citation]. ‘ ‖ (People v. Jones (2012) 54 Cal.4th 1,\n60 (Jones).) Here, Dr. Fukumoto‘s medical expertise provided additional insight\n\n\n\n                                          57\n\fabove and beyond the jury‘s general knowledge in the areas of whether the genital\ninjuries occurred before death, and whether these and other injuries were painful.\n     Defendant further asserts that the probative value of Dr. Fukumoto‘s\nopinions was substantially outweighed by their prejudice or, phrased another way,\nthat his opinions posed an intolerable risk to the fairness of the proceedings or the\nreliability of the outcome. (People v. Riggs (2008) 44 Cal.4th 248, 290 (Riggs).)\nDefendant has forfeited these claims by failing to raise them below. (Williams,\nsupra, 16 Cal.3d at p. 667, fn. 4.) They are also meritless. As delineated below,\nDr. Fukumoto‘s opinions were highly probative on the issues of identity, torture\nmurder, and the torture-murder special-circumstance, as well as burglary murder\nand the burglary-murder special-circumstance based on entry with intent to\npenetrate with a foreign object. (See post, at pts. II.B.3., II.B.4., II.B.5.)\nDefendant does not even attempt to demonstrate how their admission\n―necessitate[d] undue consumption of time‖ or ―create[d] [a] substantial danger of\nundue prejudice, of confusing the issues, or of misleading the jury.‖ (Evid. Code,\n§ 352.)\n\n           3. Admission of evidence regarding Muriel Delbecq’s murder\n     Defendant contends the trial court erred in admitting evidence about\nDelbecq‘s murder on the issues of identity, common plan, and intent in violation\nof Evidence Code sections 352 and 110115 and his rights under the Fifth, Eighth,\n\n\n15 Evidence Code section 1101 provides:\n       ―(a) Except as provided in this section and in [other sections], evidence of\na person‘s character or a trait of his or her character (whether in the form of an\nopinion, evidence of reputation, or evidence of specific instances of his or her\nconduct) is inadmissible when offered to prove his or her conduct on a specified\noccasion.\n       ―(b) Nothing in this section prohibits the admission of evidence that a\nperson committed a crime, civil wrong, or other act when relevant to prove some\n\n\n                                           58\n\fand Fourteenth Amendments to the federal Constitution. We conclude there was\nno error.\n      Before trial, the prosecutor sought the admission of evidence regarding\nDelbecq‘s murder. The trial court ruled that evidence of the Delbecq murder was\nadmissible on the issues of identification, common plan and scheme, and intent,\nand that admission of the evidence did not violate Evidence Code section 352.16\n\n\n\n\n(footnote continued from previous page)\nfact (such as motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity,\nabsence of mistake or accident. . .) other than his or her disposition to commit such\nan act.\n        ―(c) Nothing in this section affects the admissibility of evidence offered to\nsupport or attack the credibility of a witness.‖\n16  The jury was instructed: ―Evidence has been introduced for the purpose of\nshowing that the defendant committed a crime other than that for which he is on\ntrial. Such evidence, if believed, was not received and may not be considered by\nyou to prove that defendant is a person of bad character or that he has a disposition\nto commit crimes. Such evidence was received and may be considered by you\nonly for the limited purpose of determining if it tends to show:\n        ―[T]he identity of the person who committed the crime, if any, of which the\ndefendant is accused.\n\n        ―A characteristic design or plan in the commission of criminal acts similar\nto the design or plan or scheme used in the commission of the offense in this case.\n\n      ―The existence of the intent which is a necessary element of the crime\ncharged.\n\n       ―For the limited purpose for which you may consider such evidence you\nmust weigh it in the same manner as you do all other evidence in the case. You\nare not permitted to consider such evidence for any other purpose.\n\n       ―For identity to be established, the uncharged misconduct and the charged\noffense must share common features which are sufficiently distinctive so as to\nsupport the inference that the same person committed both acts.\n\n\n\n\n                                          59\n\fThe court excluded evidence that Deeble and Delbecq shared the same three\ninitials because Delbecq went by the nickname ―Stevie Delbecq‖ in Hawaii, and\nthere was no evidence defendant knew her real name. It also excluded evidence\nthat both Deeble and Delbecq were real estate agents because Delbecq did not\nengage in that occupation when she visited Hawaii, and there was no evidence that\ndefendant knew her occupation in Alaska. Finally, the court ruled that evidence\nDelbecq‘s pubic hair was cut would not be admissible absent a further showing of\nrelevance.\n      ―Subdivision (a) of [Evidence Code] section 1101prohibits admission of\nevidence of a person‘s character, including evidence of character in the form of\nspecific instances of uncharged misconduct, to prove the conduct of that person on\na specified occasion. Subdivision (b) of section 1101 clarifies, however, that this\nrule does not prohibit admission of evidence of uncharged misconduct when such\nevidence is relevant to establish some fact other than the person‘s character or\ndisposition,‖ such as identity, common plan, or intent. (People v. Ewoldt (1994)\n7 Cal.4th 380, 393, fn. omitted (Ewoldt).)‖ Evidence of uncharged crimes is\nadmissible to prove identity, common plan, and intent ―only if the charged and\nuncharged crimes are sufficiently similar to support a rational inference‖ on these\nissues. (People v. Kipp (1998) 18 Cal.4th 349, 369 (Kipp).) We review the trial\n\n\n\n\n(footnote continued from previous page)\n        ―Within the meaning of the preceding instruction, such other crime\npurportedly committed by defendant must be proved by a preponderance of the\nevidence. You must not consider such evidence for any other purpose unless you\nare satisfied that the defendant committed such other crime.\n\n       ―The prosecution has the burden of proving these facts by a preponderance\nof the evidence.‖\n\n\n                                          60\n\fcourt‘s determination for abuse of discretion, and view the evidence in the light\nmost favorable to the trial court‘s ruling. (Id. at pp. 369-370.)\n     The ―highest degree of similarity is required to prove identity.‖ (People v.\nSoper (2009) 45 Cal.4th 759, 776, fn. omitted.) ― ‗For identity to be established,\nthe uncharged misconduct and the charged offense must share common features\nthat are sufficiently distinctive so as to support the inference that the same person\ncommitted both acts. [Citation.] ―The pattern and characteristics of the crimes\nmust be so unusual and distinctive as to be like a signature.‖ ‘ ‖ (People v. Lynch\n(2010) 50 Cal.4th 693, 736 (Lynch).) ―The strength of the inference in any case\ndepends upon two factors: (1) the degree of distinctiveness of individual shared\nmarks, and (2) the number of minimally distinctive shared marks.‖ (People v.\nThornton (1974) 11 Cal.3d 738, 756.) ―The inference of identity, however, ‗need\nnot depend on one or more unique or nearly unique common features; features of\nsubstantial but lesser distinctiveness may yield a distinctive combination when\nconsidered together.‘ ‖ (Lynch, at p. 736.)\n     Here, evidence of the Delbecq murder was relevant to prove identity because\nthe common features of that crime and Deeble‘s murder were ―sufficiently\ndistinctive so as to support the inference that the same person committed both\nacts.‖ (Ewoldt, supra, 7 Cal.4th at p. 403.) At the time the court ruled before trial,\nit was informed that there was evidence both Deeble and Delbecq were older17\nCaucasian women who lived alone on the first floor of an apartment building.\nDelbecq was murdered at night, and there was evidence Deeble was also murdered\nat night given that when her body was discovered she was wearing a nightgown.\nThe cause of death for both women was strangulation. Delbecq had been\n\n\n17 In his trial brief regarding this issue, the prosecutor asserted that Deeble was 55\nyears old at the time of her death.\n\n\n                                          61\n\fpenetrated by a mousse can, and the evidence strongly suggested Deeble had been\npenetrated by a mousse can of similar diameter and length. It appeared that both\npenetrations occurred while the victims were alive. Both women also suffered\nbroken noses and ligature marks on their wrists and ankles consistent with being\nbound by telephone cord. Defendant knew Deeble, and his bloody palm prints\nwere found at the Delbecq murder scene. Both victims were found in their\nransacked bedrooms, and had jewelry taken, and the prosecutor asserted entry into\nboth homes was made by removing a window screen. Substantially similar\nevidence was presented at trial.\n     Thus, at the time the Hawaii evidence was admitted, the trial court was aware\nof numerous similarities between the Deeble and Delbecq murders. Most notably,\nmousse cans of similar diameter and length were present at both crime scenes, and\nthere was evidence both victims had been sexually penetrated by the mousse cans.\nMoreover, ―[t]o be highly distinctive, the charged and uncharged crimes need not\nbe mirror images of each other.‖ (People v. Carter (2005) 36 Cal.4th 1114, 1148.)\nRather, dissimilarities between the crimes ―went to the weight of the evidence and\ndid not preclude the prosecution from introducing the evidence‖ regarding\nDelbecq‘s murder. (Ibid.)\n     The evidence of Delbecq‘s murder was also relevant to prove a common\ndesign or plan. ―To establish the existence of a common design or plan, the\ncommon features must indicate the existence of a plan rather than a series of\nsimilar spontaneous acts, but the plan thus revealed need not be distinctive or\nunusual‖; rather it ―need only exist to support the inference that the defendant\nemployed that plan in committing the charged offense.‖ (Ewoldt, supra, 7 Cal,4th\nat p. 403.) Here, the common features noted above indicate that when defendant\ncommitted the charged Deeble offenses and the uncharged Delbecq offenses he\n\n\n\n                                         62\n\fwas acting pursuant to a common design or plan to torture, murder, and rob the\nolder women he had chosen as victims. (Kipp, supra, 18 Cal.4th at p. 371.)\n     The evidence of Delbecq‘s murder was also relevant to prove intent, such as\ndefendant‘s entry with the intent to penetrate with a foreign object or steal as to\nburglary murder, and possession of a willful, deliberate, and premeditated intent to\ninflict extreme and prolonged pain on a person for a sadistic purpose as to torture\nmurder. (Ewoldt, supra, 7 Cal.4th at p. 402.) Here, as set forth above, the\nevidence of Delbecq‘s murder was sufficiently similar to Deeble‘s murder to\nsupport the inference that defendant ― ‗ ―probably harbor[ed] the same intent in\neach instance.‖ ‘ ‖ (Ibid.)\n     For these reasons, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it ruled that\nevidence of the Delbecq murder was sufficiently similar to Deeble‘s murder to\nsupport an inference that defendant committed both murders, and did so pursuant\nto a common design or plan and while harboring the same intent. (Kipp, supra,\n18 Cal.4th at pp. 370-371.)\n     Nor did evidence of Delbecq‘s murder contravene Evidence Code section\n352.18 (Lynch, supra, 50 Cal.4th at p. 757; Ewoldt, supra, 7 Cal.4th at p. 404.)\n―Under Evidence Code section 352, a trial court may exclude otherwise relevant\nevidence when its probative value is substantially outweighed by concerns of\nundue prejudice, confusion, or consumption of time. ‗Evidence is substantially\nmore prejudicial than probative [citation] if, broadly stated, it poses an intolerable\n―risk to the fairness of the proceedings or the reliability of the outcome\n\n\n18  Evidence Code section 352 provides: ―The court in its discretion may exclude\nevidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the probability that\nits admission will (a) necessitate undue consumption of time or (b) create\nsubstantial danger of undue prejudice, of confusing the issues, or of misleading the\njury.‖\n\n\n                                          63\n\f[citation].‖ ‘ ‖ (Riggs, supra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 290.) We conclude no such\nintolerable risk was present here.\n     The tendency of the evidence to show identity, common design or plan, and\nintent, as set forth above, was strong. (See Ewoldt, supra, 7 Cal.4th at p. 404.)\nMoreover, the evidence regarding Delbecq‘s murder was independent of the\nevidence of the charged crimes, involving witnesses and evidence from another\nstate and a decedent who had no connection to Deeble. (Id. at pp. 404-405.)\n     Nor did admission of the evidence of Delbecq‘s murder create a substantial\ndanger of undue prejudice. Although the jury could infer from the presence of\ndefendant‘s palm prints and footprint that defendant had killed Delbecq, it could\nalso infer from his testimony that he had been convicted of her 1993 murder.\nThus, ―the jury was not tempted to convict defendant of the charged offenses,\nregardless of his guilt, in order to assure that he would be punished for‖ any other\nmurder. (People v. Balcom (1994) 7 Cal.4th 414, 427.) In addition, although the\nDelbecq murder involved greater brutality to the victim‘s genital area, the jury\ncould reasonably infer that Deeble‘s genital area was also penetrated by a mousse\ncan while she was alive, and that she suffered an agonizing death as she attempted\nto hold her head up so that she would not be strangled by the ligature. Thus, the\nDelbecq murder was not more inflammatory than the Deeble murder. (Ewoldt,\nsupra, 7 Cal.4th at p. 405.) Moreover, the jury was properly instructed on the\nlimited purposes for which it could consider evidence of Delbecq‘s murder.\n(Kipp, supra, 18 Cal.4th at p. 372.)\n     Defendant contends that ―the key foundational fact‖ that Deeble was\nassaulted with a mousse can was not established at trial, and that the trial court\nerred in failing to exclude evidence Delbecq was penetrated by a mousse can. As\nwe have observed, Dr. Fukumoto testified that Deeble suffered injury to her\nvaginal and rectal areas, and that the mousse can found in her bed was consistent\n\n                                          64\n\fwith an object that could have caused these injuries. In addition, there was\ncircumstantial evidence that Deeble had been penetrated by the mousse can: A\nsubstance that appeared to be blood was present underneath the ridge around the\ntop of the mousse can; this substance gave a positive response to a presumptive\ntest for blood; a cap found on the ground next to Deeble appeared to be one that\ncould fit the mousse can; a substance that appeared to be blood was observed on\nthe cap; and the position of Deeble‘s nightgown, which was pushed up around her\nwaist, the absence of panties, and the apparent semen stain on her thigh indicated a\nsexual assault. Although defendant offered to stipulate that Delbecq was\npenetrated by a mousse can without reference to the concomitant damage to her\nabdomen, ― ‗[t]he general rule is that the prosecution in a criminal case cannot be\ncompelled to accept a stipulation if the effect would be to deprive the state‘s case\nof its persuasiveness and forcefulness.‘ ‖ (People v. Scott (2011) 52 Cal.4th 452,\n471.)\n        Defendant contends that the trial court‘s admission of evidence of Delbecq‘s\nmurder under the test in Ewoldt, supra, 7 Cal.4th 380, instead of the test under\nPeople v. Tassell (1984) 36 Cal.3d 77, which he claims was in effect at the time of\nthe crimes, violated the prohibition against ex post facto laws. Defendant\nchallenges the trial court‘s application of Ewoldt, not Evidence Code section 1101\nitself, and hence his claim is more properly characterized as one invoking due\nprocess and not the ex post facto clause. (People v. Brown (2004) 33 Cal.4th 382,\n394.) Defendant‘s claim is meritless under either provision. Ewoldt concerned the\ncircumstances under which certain evidence was admissible at trial. It did not\nattach criminality to prior acts that were ―innocent when done,‖ provide for\n―greater punishment‖ of a crime ―than was prescribed at the time of its\ncommission,‖ or ―alter the degree‖ or measure of proof necessary to convict from\nthat which was required at the time the crime was committed. (Brown, at p. 394\n\n                                          65\n\f[applying the high court‘s analysis of ex post facto laws to a claim that admission\nof victim impact evidence violated the due process clause].) Hence, Ewoldt’s\nprinciples may be applied to a trial occurring after it was decided, regardless of\nwhen the underlying crime was committed. (People v. Sandoval (2007) 41 Cal.4th\n825, 845; Tapia v. Superior Court (1991) 53 Cal.3d 282, 288-289.)\n     In sum, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting evidence of\nDelbecq‘s murder to establish identity, common design or plan, and intent.\n\n           4) Asserted insufficiency of evidence in support of a first degree\n              murder conviction on a theory of torture murder, and of a torture-\n              murder special circumstance\n     The People advanced two theories of murder: murder by means of torture\nand felony-murder burglary. The jury was also instructed on two special\ncircumstance allegations: murder involving the infliction of torture and murder\nwhile defendant was engaged in the commission of burglary. The jury found\ndefendant guilty of first degree murder, but the verdict did not specify the theory\non which it rested its verdict. It also found true the torture-murder and burglary-\nmurder special-circumstance allegations.\n     Defendant contends that the evidence is insufficient to support the jury‘s\nfinding of first degree murder on a theory of torture murder and true finding as to\nthe torture-murder special-circumstance allegation. We disagree.\n     ―When considering a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to support a\nconviction, we review the entire record in the light most favorable to the judgment\nto determine whether it contains substantial evidence — that is, evidence that is\nreasonable, credible, and of solid value — from which a reasonable trier of fact\ncould find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.‖ (People v. Lindberg\n(2008) 45 Cal.4th 1, 27.) We determine ―whether, after viewing the evidence in\nthe light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have\n\n\n                                         66\n\ffound the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.‖ (Jackson v.\nVirginia (1979) 443 U.S. 307, 319.) In so doing, a reviewing court ―presumes in\nsupport of the judgment the existence of every fact the trier could reasonably\ndeduce from the evidence.‖ (People v. Kraft (2000) 23 Cal.4th 978, 1053.) The\nsame standard of review applies to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting\nspecial circumstance findings. (People v. Chatman (2006) 38 Cal.4th 344, 389\n(Chatman).)\n     ―All murder which is perpetrated by means of . . . torture . . . is murder of the\nfirst degree.‖ (§ 189.) Murder by torture requires: 1) an act or acts causing death\nthat involve a high degree of probability of death, 2) a causal relationship between\nthe torturous act and death, 3) a willful, deliberate, and premeditated intent to\ninflict extreme and prolonged pain on a person for the purpose of revenge,\nextortion, persuasion, or for any other sadistic purpose, and 4) commission of the\nact or acts with such intent. (Chatman, supra, 38 Cal.4th at pp. 389-390\n(Chatman); People v. Davenport (1985) 41 Cal.3d 247, 267, 294 (Davenport).)\nThe circumstance that the murder is ―perpetrated by means of . . . torture‖ (§ 189)\nindicates that a torturous act — that is, one done with a willful, deliberate, and\npremeditated intent to inflict extreme and prolonged pain on a person for a sadistic\npurpose — must occur before the victim dies. Thus, the perpetrator intends to\n― ‗cause pain and suffering in addition to death,‘ ‖ and ― ‗in the course, or as a\nresult of inflicting pain and suffering, the victim dies.‘ ‖ (People v. Steger (1976)\n16 Cal.3d 539, 543.) The ― ‗finding of murder-by-torture encompasses the totality\nof the brutal acts and the circumstances which led to the victim‘s death.\n[Citation.] The acts of torture may not be segregated into their constituent\nelements in order to determine whether any single act by itself caused the death;\nrather it is the continuum of sadistic violence that constitutes the torture.‘ ‖\n(People v. Jennings (2010) 50 Cal.4th 616, 643.)\n\n                                           67\n\f     ―The jury may infer the intent to inflict extreme pain from the circumstances\nof the crime, the nature of the killing, and the condition of the body.‖ (Chatman,\nsupra, 38 Cal.4th at p. 390.) A perpetrator need not have any intent to kill\n(Davenport, supra, 41 Cal.3d at p. 267), and it need not be proven that the victim\nactually suffered pain (Chatman, at p. 389).\n     We have held that ―[m]urder by strangulation indicates malice, but it does not\nby itself indicate an intent to make the victim suffer.‖ (People v. Caldwell (1955)\n43 Cal.2d 864, 865, 869 [no evidence that the defendant intended to make the\nvictim suffer when he inflicted a long laceration on his wife‘s scalp, and then\nstrangled her with two belts].) We have, however, considered evidence of an\n―unusually forcible strangulation attempt‖ together with other violent acts to\nconclude there was sufficient evidence of a premeditated intent to inflict extreme\nand prolonged pain. (People v. Morales (1989) 48 Cal.3d 527, 541, 559-560\n[evidence that defendant told his girlfriend he was going to ― ‗hurt‖ a girl by\nstrangling her with his belt,‖ and thereafter attempted to strangle the victim ―with\nhis belt until it broke, beat her repeatedly on the head with a hammer until she was\nunconscious or dead, dragged her body into a field and completed an act of sexual\nintercourse, and finally stabbed her four times in the chest to assure her death‖\nsufficient to sustain jury‘s implied finding of intent to inflict extreme pain].)\n     Here, Dr. Fukumoto testified that before Deeble‘s death her vagina was\nbruised and torn, there was bleeding beneath the surface lining of the vaginal wall,\nand her anus was dilated, bruised, and lacerated. He also opined that the injuries\nto Deeble‘s vaginal and rectal areas were consistent with penetration by the\nmousse can found on her bed, and that trauma to the vaginal and rectal areas is\n―highly painful.‖ As noted above, there was strong circumstantial evidence that\nDeeble had been penetrated by the mousse can. (See ante, at p. 65.) The jury was\nalso aware that defendant subsequently penetrated Muriel Delbecq with a mousse\n\n                                          68\n\fcan while she was alive, tearing the barrier between the vaginal and abdominal\ncavities.\n     Deeble died from ligature strangulation, and was found with her neck in a\nnoose fashioned from a belt and suspended about eight inches above the floor.\nDr. Fukumoto testified that one mark on Deeble‘s neck, a deep furrow, had\nfeatures such as wrinkling and thickening that were consistent with Deeble\nstruggling against the ligature to loosen it. When Deeble was found, blood was\nrunning out of her left ear and her mouth, and there was blood around her nose.\nDr. Fukumoto testified that Deeble‘s left eardrum had been cut by a sharp or\npointed instrument, her right ear drum was torn, and she had extensive\nhemorrhaging in her middle ears. He opined, ―if the ear drums are torn, associated\nwith massive bleeding in the middle ears, this could be due to a massive increase\nin pressure as a result of the struggle of the victim in his or her attempt to get a\nbreath.‖ He further testified that all of these injuries would have been extremely\npainful. Moreover, defendant inflicted blunt trauma injury that caused bleeding\nnear Deeble‘s pancreas, an organ located deep within the body, and he also\ninflicted blunt trauma to her head.\n     Although there was no testimony that the injuries other than those to the\ngenital area and the ligature were inflicted before death, there was evidence that\nDeeble had been bound and gagged, and had a hood — which was fashioned from\na pillowcase — placed over her head. As noted above, these circumstances\nsuggest a methodical and prolonged attack rather than an explosion of violence,\nand would be unnecessary measures if, as defendant suggests, the victim had\nalready been rendered senseless by the blow to her head. (People v. Bemore\n(2000) 22 Cal.4th 809, 840 (Bemore) [―No restraint would have been necessary if\n[the victim] had perished at the start of the attack in the manner defendant now\nsuggests.‖].) Moreover, because more blood was found inside the hood than\n\n                                           69\n\foutside, and when Deeble was discovered she was not wearing a hood, the jury\ncould reasonably infer that the cut to Deeble‘s eardrum, which Dr. Fukumoto\ntestified would have been extremely painful, and the injuries to her nose and\nmouth, occurred while she was alive and either before or while she was wearing\nthe hood.\n     The jury could reasonably infer from this totality of facts that defendant\ncommitted torturous acts before Deeble‘s death, these acts that had a high\nprobability of killing Deeble and did kill her, and that he did so with a willful,\ndeliberate, and premeditated intent to inflict extreme and prolonged pain on\nDeeble for a sadistic purpose.\n     The evidence is also sufficient to support the jury‘s true finding of the\ntorture-murder special-circumstance allegation. The torture-murder special-\ncircumstance allegation requires an ― ‗intent to cause cruel or extreme pain and\nsuffering for the purpose of revenge, extortion, persuasion, or for any other\nsadistic purpose.‘ ‖ (People v. Elliot (2005) 37 Cal.4th 453, 479.) Unlike torture\nmurder, it also requires an intent to kill and, at the time of Deeble‘s murder,\nrequired ―proof of the infliction of extreme physical pain no matter how long its\nduration‖ on a living victim. (§ 190.2, subd. (a)(18) as added by Prop. 7, § 6,\napproved by the voters, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 7, 1978); see Chatman, supra, 38 Cal.4th\nat p. 391; Davenport, supra, 41 Cal.3d at p. 271.) It does not require a\npremeditated and deliberate intent to torture (People v. Cole (2004) 33 Cal.4th\n1158, 1226), a causal relationship between the torturous act and death (People v.\nCrittenden (1994) 9 Cal.4th 83, 141-142), or proof the victim subjectively\nexperienced pain (Davenport, supra, 41 Cal.3d at p. 271). ―Distilled, the statutory\nlanguage requires intent to kill, intent to torture, and infliction of an extremely\npainful act upon a living victim.‖ (Bemore, supra, 22 Cal.4th at p. 839.)\n\n\n\n                                          70\n\f     As we have explained, the evidence is sufficient to support the element of\nintent to inflict pain for a sadistic purpose. In addition, the nature of Deeble‘s\ninjuries supports the jury‘s conclusion that defendant intended to kill her and that\nin doing so he inflicted extreme physical pain while she was alive.\n\n           5) Asserted insufficiency of the evidence in support of first degree\n              murder conviction on a theory of burglary murder and burglary-\n              murder special circumstance\n     The prosecutor proceeded on a theory of murder in the course of burglary\nbased both on entry with intent to commit theft, and entry with intent to penetrate\nwith a foreign object. Defendant asserts that the evidence in support of the\nburglary theory of murder and the burglary-murder-special-circumstance\nallegation was insufficient. We disagree.\n      ―All murder which is . . . committed in the perpetration of, or attempt to\nperpetrate, . . . burglary . . . is murder of the first degree.‖ (§ 189.) ― ‗The mental\nstate required is simply the specific intent to commit the underlying felony; neither\nintent to kill, deliberation, premeditation, nor malice aforethought is needed.\n[Citations.] There is no requirement of a strict ―causal‖ [citation] or ―temporal‖\n[citation] relationship between the ―felony‖ and the ―murder.‖ All that is\ndemanded is that the two ―are parts of one continuous transaction.‖ ‘ ‖ (People v.\nGutierrez (2002) 28 Cal.4th 1083, 1140-1141.) When a defendant makes no\nadmissions and relies on an alibi defense, ―the jury [is] required to find his intent\nupon entry circumstantially,‖ such as ―from his conduct and statements after\nentry.‖ (People v. Failla (1966) 64 Cal.2d 560, 564-565; 2 Witkin & Epstein, Cal.\nCriminal Law (4th ed. 2012) § 156, p. 203 [―Acts or conduct on the premises after\nentry may be extremely persuasive as circumstantial evidence of intent to\ncommit . . . a felony.‖]; see People v. Abilez (2007) 41 Cal.4th 472, 508 [― ‗[t]here\n\n\n\n\n                                          71\n\fis no better proof that [defendant] entered the [victim‘s house] with intent to\ncommit robbery than a showing he did in fact commit robbery after his entry‘ ‖].)\n     We conclude the evidence of entry with the intent to commit theft or\npenetration with a foreign object was sufficient. As to entry with the intent to\ncommit theft, the bedroom in which Deeble‘s body was found had been ransacked,\nincluding dresser drawers that were open and the contents of a purse strewn on the\nfloor. Valentine, Deeble‘s daughter, testified that following Deeble‘s death,\nValentine never again saw certain identified pieces of Deeble‘s jewelry.\nMoreover, there was evidence from which the jury could infer defendant had\nsubsequently stolen Delbecq‘s wedding ring. The jury could reasonably infer\nfrom this evidence that defendant entered Deeble‘s home with the intent to commit\ntheft. (Lynch, supra, 50 Cal.4th at p. 764.)\n     As to entry with the intent to commit penetration with a foreign object,\nDeeble suffered injuries to her vaginal and rectal areas consistent with penetration\nby a mousse can found on her bed, and as recounted above, there was other\ncircumstantial evidence that Deeble had been penetrated by the mousse can. The\njury was also aware that defendant subsequently brutally penetrated Muriel\nDelbecq with a mousse can. The jury could reasonably infer from these\ncircumstances that defendant entered Deeble‘s home with the intent to penetrate\nher with a foreign object.\n     The evidence is also sufficient to support the jury‘s true finding of the\nburglary-murder special-circumstance allegation. ―The felony-murder special\ncircumstance applies to a murder committed while the defendant was engaged in,\nor was an accomplice in the commission of, the attempted commission of, or the\nimmediate flight after committing or attempting to commit, various enumerated\nfelonies, including, as relevant here, burglary. (§ 190.2, subd. (a)(17).) A strict\ncausal or temporal relationship between the felony and the murder is not required;\n\n                                         72\n\fwhat is required is proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant intended to\ncommit the felony at the time he killed the victim and that the killing and the\nfelony were part of one continuous transaction. [Citations.] Additionally, in this\nCarlos-era case, the prosecution was required to prove that defendant[] intended to\nkill the victim.‖ (People v. Coffman and Marlow (2004) 34 Cal.4th 1, 87; see\nCarlos v. Superior Court (1983) 35 Cal.3d 131, 135.) Here, as we have explained,\nthe nature of the victim‘s wounds and the circumstances surrounding the killing\nsupport the conclusion that defendant intended to kill, and committed Deeble‘s\nmurder while engaged in burglary.\n\n            6) Challenge to testimony regarding key\n     Defendant contends that the trial court‘s admission of Peggy Ventura‘s\ntestimony regarding Muriel Delbecq‘s plans to hide a key outside her home\nviolated Evidence Code section 1200, as well as his rights under the Fifth, Sixth,\nSeventh, and Fourteenth Amendments to the federal Constitution, and article I,\nsections 7, 15, and 17 of the state Constitution. We disagree.\n     During direct examination, the prosecutor asked Ventura whether Delbecq\nkept a key outside of the apartment. Ventura replied, ―Yes she did. She had been\nlocked out once, and she had to call me at work and ask me if I had my spare key.\nAnd of course I did. And she went to the neighbor then who drove her up to go\nget the spare key, and she said then that she was never going to let that happen\nagain because she hated bothering everybody. So she said she was going to hide a\nkey. And even though I never asked her —‖ The trial court overruled the defense\ncounsel‘s relevance objection. Ventura continued, ―Even though I hadn‘t asked\nher the exact location, . . . there was a little planter area right at the front entrance\nthere on the right-hand corner where the bathroom is . . . . [a]nd she said that she\n\n\n\n\n                                            73\n\fwas just going to hide it under a rock there.‖ The prosecutor asked, ―Did you ever\nfind that key or see a key . . . afterwards?‖ Ventura replied, ―No.‖\n     During cross-examination, defense counsel asked Ventura when her mother\nhad locked herself out of the condominium, and Ventura replied December 1992.\nCounsel then asked, ―Am I right that she commented on this to you, but . . . she\nnever showed you where she was going to keep the key?‖ Ventura replied,\n―Right. She had said she was going to leave it under a rock.‖ Defense counsel\nasked, ―And did you see the key that she obtained?‖ Ventura replied, ―No.‖\nDefense counsel asked, ―All right. So if I have this right, you never saw the key,\nand you never saw the rock where she was going to keep it; is that correct?‖\nVentura replied, ―No. We had talked about it, and I told her to be careful about\nwhere she kept it, that it wasn‘t obvious, but — ‖ Defense counsel asked,\n―Ma‘am, so if I have this right, the only thing you know about this as far as the\nobtaining a key or putting it under a rock, that is nothing you ever saw yourself; it\nis just something she stated to you; is that correct?‖ Ventura replied, ―. . . That is\ncorrect.‖ Defense counsel then moved to strike on grounds of hearsay and lack of\npersonal knowledge. The trial court overruled the objection because counsel ―did\nnot object to the question or to the answer when it was given.‖ Defense counsel\ncontinued to question Ventura about the key, establishing that she had never seen\nDelbecq take a key out from under a rock and use it, and that she had no personal\nknowledge whether Delbecq ever hid a key. Defendant subsequently filed, and the\ntrial court denied, a motion to strike Ventura‘s testimony regarding the key.\n     Even assuming the court erred in failing to strike Ventura‘s testimony that\nher mother kept a key outside of the apartment, there was no prejudice under any\nstandard. Ventura‘s testimony was of limited probative value because it was\nabundantly clear she had no personal knowledge whether there was a key outside\nher mother‘s condominium. Moreover, defendant was connected to Delbecq‘s\n\n                                          74\n\fmurder by the far more compelling evidence of his bloody palm prints and\nfootprint in her bedroom. In addition, the possibility that Delbecq had hidden a\nkey outside — as had Deeble — was only one minor of many more significant\nsimilarities between the Delbecq and Deeble murders.\n\n           7) Challenge to impeachment evidence\n     Defendant contends the trial erred in allowing his testimony to be impeached\nby his prior convictions in violation of Evidence Code section 352, and his rights\nunder Fifth, Sixth, Eight and Fourteenth Amendments of the federal Constitution.\nNot so.\n     During cross-examination, the prosecutor asked defendant if on March 10,\n1994 he had been convicted of the murder of Muriel Delbecq in Hawaii. Defense\ncounsel objected, and moved at sidebar to exclude reference to defendant‘s prior\nconvictions. In addition to the murder conviction, the prosecutor asserted, and\ndefendant did not dispute, that defendant had suffered March 1994 convictions for\nkidnapping, sexual assault, robbery, and burglary, 1988 convictions for receiving\nstolen property and vehicle theft, a 1987 conviction for weapon possession, and an\nAugust 1984 vehicle burglary conviction. The prosecutor also sought to ask\ndefendant about the circumstances surrounding prior misdemeanors involving\nmoral turpitude.\n     The trial court ruled that evidence of defendant‘s 1994 convictions for\nmurder and burglary and his 1984 burglary conviction could be admitted. It stated\nthat nothing more than the fact of those convictions could be introduced, and\nexcluded evidence of defendant‘s other convictions. When cross-examination\nresumed, the prosecutor asked defendant if on March 10, 1994 he had been\nconvicted in Hawaii of murder and felony burglary, and in August 1984 he had\n\n\n\n\n                                        75\n\fbeen convicted in California of the felony of second degree burglary. Defendant\nresponded affirmatively.\n     ― ‗[T]he admissibility of any past misconduct for impeachment is limited at\nthe outset by the relevance requirement of moral turpitude.‘ ‖ (People v. Clark\n(2011) 52 Cal.4th 856, 931.) Beyond this, the ― ‗trial courts have broad discretion\nto admit or exclude prior convictions for impeachment purposes.‘ ‖ (People v.\nHinton (2006) 37 Cal.4th 839, 887 (Hinton).) ―When determining whether to\nadmit a prior conviction for impeachment purposes, the court should consider,\namong other factors, whether it reflects on the witness‘s honesty or veracity,\nwhether it is near or remote in time, whether it is for the same or similar conduct\nas the charged offense, and what effect its admission would have on the\ndefendant‘s decision to testify.‖ (Clark, at p. 931.) The impeaching offense may\npostdate the charged offense. (Hinton, at p. 887.)\n     Here, the trial court did not abuse its discretion. Both murder and burglary\nare crimes involving moral turpitude. (Hinton, supra, 37 Cal.4th at p. 888; People\nv. Collins (1986) 42 Cal.3d 378, 395.) The 1994 murder and burglary convictions\nwere not remote in time to defendant‘s 1996 trial. Nor was defendant‘s 1984\nsecond degree burglary conviction remote, because as the trial court observed,\ndefendant ―has continuously been in and out of trouble‖ based on the convictions\nin 1984, 1987, 1988, and 1994. Defendant had already testified at the point\ncounsel moved to exclude evidence of the prior convictions, so the trial court‘s\nruling had no bearing on that decision.\n     ―Although the similarity between the prior convictions and the charged\noffenses is a factor for the court to consider when balancing probative value\nagainst prejudice, it is not dispositive.‖ (People v. Clark, supra, 52 Cal.4th at\np. 932.) Here, defendant only testified that he had suffered 1994 Hawaii\nconvictions for murder and burglary, not that he had been convicted of murdering\n\n                                          76\n\fand burglarizing Delbecq. Thus, contrary to defendant‘s contention, the\nconvictions did not ―conclusively establish[] his guilt of those crimes.‖ Even if\nthe jury assumed that the 1994 convictions involved Delbecq‘s 1993 murder, it\nhad already properly heard evidence regarding this murder under Evidence Code\nsection 1101, subdivision (b), and the evidence that defendant committed the\nHawaii murder was strong. Moreover, as noted above (see ante, at p. 64), the\ncircumstance that defendant had been convicted of Delbecq‘s murder would serve\nto decrease the prejudice of the Hawaii evidence because ―the jury was not\ntempted to convict defendant of the charged offenses, regardless of his guilt, in\norder to assure that he would be punished for‖ any subsequent murder. (Balcom,\nsupra, 7 Cal.4th at p. 427.)\n     We further reject defendant‘s contention that evidence he ―was guilty of the\nHawaii crimes was the de facto equivalent of a directed verdict on the present\ncharges, relieving the prosecution of its burden of proof and rendering the trial so\nfundamentally unfair as to deny [defendant] due process of law.‖ As noted,\nevidence of defendant‘s guilt of Delbecq‘s murder — properly introduced as\nsubstantive evidence that he also killed Deeble (see ante, at pt. II.B.3.) — was\nstrong. To the extent the jury inferred that his 1994 murder and burglary\nconvictions were for the Delbecq killing, that circumstance operated to decrease,\nnot increase, the prejudice of their introduction for impeachment. Moreover, even\nif the jury found by a preponderance of the evidence that defendant killed\nDelbecq, it was still required to determine if the similarities between the Delbecq\nand Deeble murders were sufficient to conclude defendant committed and\npossessed the requisite intent for the Deeble murder.\n     Defendant similarly contends that although the jury was instructed that it\ncould only use the fact of defendant‘s conviction to assess his credibility, ―it was\nundoubtedly used by the jury to . . . satisfy the prosecution‘s burden to prove\n\n                                         77\n\f[defendant‘s] commission of the Delbecq murder by a preponderance of the\nevidence before it could consider that evidence to establish identity or intent,‖19\nand ―made it even more likely that the jury would ignore the limiting ‗similar acts‘\ninstruction and conclude that since he was convicted of one brutal murder, he must\nalso be guilty of the charged offense.‖ We presume the jury followed the trial\ncourt‘s instructions. (Dement, supra, 53 Cal.4th at p. 36.) Moreover, once again,\nthe evidence of defendant‘s guilt of the Hawaii murder was strong.\n     Defendant contends, relying on People v. Rollo (1977) 20 Cal.3d 109, 118,\nthat ― ‗ ―[a]cts of violence . . . generally have little or no direct bearing on honesty\nand veracity.‖ ‘ ‖ However, in 1982, ―section 28, subdivision (f) of article I of the\nCalifornia Constitution . . . was added by Proposition 8, and . . . provides in\npertinent part that ‗[a]ny prior felony conviction . . . shall subsequently be used\nwithout limitation for purposes of impeachment . . . in any criminal proceeding.‘ ‖\n(Hinton, supra, 37 Cal.4th at pp. 887-888.) We subsequently held ― ‗that—always\nsubject to the trial court‘s discretion under [Evidence Code] section 352—\n[Proposition 8] authorizes the use of any felony conviction which necessarily\ninvolves moral turpitude, even if the immoral trait is one other than dishonesty.‘ ‖\n(Id., at p. 888, quoting People v. Castro (1985) 38 Cal.3d 301, 306.)\n\n19  The jury was instructed: ―The fact that a witness has been convicted of a\nfelony, if such be a fact, may be considered by you only for the purpose of\ndetermining the believability of that witness. The fact of such a conviction does\nnot necessarily destroy or impair a witness‘s believability. It is one of the\ncircumstances that you may take into consideration in weighing the testimony of\nsuch a witness.‖\n\nThe jury was also instructed: ―Certain evidence was admitted for a limited\npurpose. At the time this evidence was admitted you were admonished that it\ncould not be considered by you for any purpose other than the limited purpose for\nwhich it was admitted. Do not consider such evidence for any purpose except the\nlimited purpose for which it was admitted.‖\n\n\n                                           78\n\f     Defendant also contends that the trial court ―failed to engage in the weighing\nprocess required under Evidence Code section 352,‖ and in particular admitted the\nmurder conviction without consideration of all relevant factors, and ―failed to\nconsider the availability for impeachment of other felony convictions that were\ndissimilar to the murder charge and were more probative on the issue of\n[defendant‘s] credibility.‖ ― ‗[A] court need not expressly weigh prejudice against\nprobative value or even expressly state that it has done so, if the record as a whole\nshows the court was aware of and performed its balancing function under\nEvidence Code section 352.‘ ‖ (People v. Lewis (2009) 46 Cal.4th 1255, 1285.)\nHere, the trial court expressly referred to the ―weighing process,‖ was clearly\naware it had discretion to preclude admission of defendant‘s prior convictions, and\ndid preclude admission of several of them. It also precluded evidence regarding\ndefendant‘s misdemeanor convictions, observing that such evidence did not\n―prove that much and tends to take too much time and could end up confusing the\njury.‖\n     As to the prior murder conviction, the court stated it was a ―crime of . . . the\nworst type of moral turpitude,‖ and ―[h]ighly relevant on credibility.‖ Although\nthe Hawaii murder conviction was ―an identical crime,‖ the court stated that factor\nwas offset by the admission of the evidence under Evidence Code section 1101,\nsubdivision (b), and the strength of the evidence implicating defendant in the\nHawaii murder. The trial court was not required to further articulate all of its\nconsiderations, such as the availability for impeachment of other prior felony\nconvictions that were dissimilar to the murder charge, before admitting evidence\nof the murder conviction.\n\n\n\n\n                                          79\n\f           8. Assertedly erroneous exclusion of exculpatory evidence\n     Defendant contends the trial court erred in excluding certain exculpatory\nevidence in violation of his rights under the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth\nAmendments of the federal Constitution, and article I, sections 7 and 15 of the\nstate Constitution. We conclude there was no prejudicial error.\n\n               a. Dr. Wolf’s testimony\n     Defendant first contends that the trial court erred in precluding defense expert\nwitness Dr. Wolf from answering a line of questions regarding whether Deeble‘s\ninjuries were consistent with consensual sexual intercourse after it allowed the\nprosecution‘s expert, Dr. Fukumoto, to opine that the mousse can found on\nDeeble‘s bed was consistent with an object that could have caused these injuries.\nEven assuming the trial court erred in precluding this line of testimony, there was\nno prejudice under any standard. Dr. Wolf described the injuries to Deeble‘s\nvagina and rectum as ―[e]xtremely minor,‖ and opined they could have been\ncaused by a finger or a penis. He agreed with defense counsel that ―taking all the\nreferences to the vaginal mucosa, labia and fourchette together, all of these can be\naptly characterized by a pathologist as being trivial and merely consistent with\nsexual intercourse.‖ He also testified that Deeble‘s vaginal mucosa was thin\nbecause she was menopausal, and that when the mucosa is thin, any kind of\nmanipulation by a finger, penis, or other foreign object is more likely to cause\nmicroscopic lacerations. He further testified that 60 percent of women who have\nconsensual sex, and 30 percent of women who suffer sexual assault, can have\nmicroscopic injury to the vagina. In addition, on cross-examination,\nDr. Fukumoto opined that the dilation of the anus could have been caused by a\nfinger, penis, or any number of other objects.\n\n\n\n\n                                         80\n\f               b. Evidence that defendant suffered from blackouts\n     Defendant contends that the trial court erred in excluding testimony by Victor\nPortillo and Janice Hunt that that ―could have circumstantially corroborated\n[defendant‘s] defense that he was in an unconscious state at the time of the\n[Deeble] murder.‖ Portillo, defendant‘s cousin, lived on Maui for a month in\n1991-1992. One night he, defendant, and defendant‘s girlfriend Brenda drank\nheavily. They got into a vehicle with defendant driving and Brenda in the\npassenger seat. Brenda and defendant argued, and Brenda hit defendant several\ntimes. Defendant did not hit her back, but blocked her hits to maintain control of\nthe vehicle. The following day, defendant did not appear to be upset with Brenda\nover her behavior the night before. Portillo mentioned the incident to defendant.\nWhen defense counsel asked if defendant had replied ―that he did not recall any of\nit,‖ the prosecutor objected on hearsay grounds. Defense counsel asserted it was\nnot hearsay, but circumstantial evidence of an alcoholic blackout‖ and cited\nEvidence Code section 1250. The prosecutor responded that there was no\n―foundation that ties into any kind of blackout,‖ and the trial court sustained the\nobjection.\n     Janice Hunt testified that she lived with defendant in Hawaii. In December\n1992, defendant drank heavily, and at times became so intoxicated he had\nalcoholic blackouts. Hunt described two incidents, one when defendant left in his\nwork truck at night, and the next morning she and defendant searched for the\ntruck, and another when he apparently left a bag of groceries outside all night.\nAfter Hunt described the latter incident, defense counsel asked, ―Did you tell\n[defendant] that you had found these things down there?‖ Hunt replied, ―Yes.‖\nCounsel asked, ―And what was his response?‖ The prosecutor objected on\nhearsay grounds, and defense counsel responded it was not offered for the truth,\nbut for ―state of mind.‖ The trial court sustained the objection. Hunt then testified\n\n\n                                         81\n\fthat defendant appeared surprised when she showed him the items. Counsel made\nno offer of proof as to how Hunt would respond to the objected-to question, but\nhere assumes she would have said whether defendant ―recalled certain actions\nafter drinking.‖\n     Even assuming the evidence defendant sought to elicit from Portillo and\nHunt was admissible to show defendant‘s state of mind, state of mind evidence\nmust nonetheless be relevant. It is not apparent how defendant‘s state of mind in\n1991 or 1992 had any bearing on his mental state in May of 1986 when Deeble\nwas killed. (Evid. Code, § 350.) Moreover, even assuming the trial court erred in\nsustaining the prosecutor‘s objections to this testimony, there was no possible\nprejudice. Both defendant and Hunt testified that defendant suffered from\nalcoholic blackouts, and Dr. Stalcup testified that anyone who drinks enough can\nhave an alcoholic blackout.\n     Moreover, contrary to defendant‘s claim, the prosecutor did not argue that\nthere was no corroboration of defendant‘s claim he suffered blackouts, and thus\nask the jury to convict defendant because he failed to present evidence that was\nexcluded by the prosecutor‘s objection. Rather, the prosecutor asserted that the\ncircumstances of the murder were inconsistent with a perpetrator experiencing a\nblackout, and that defendant was the only person who actually knew if he had\nexperienced a blackout. Thus, the prosecutor observed that Dr. Stalcup had not\ninterviewed defendant, and stated ―[S]o the only words you have, the only person\nthat knows whether or not they had a blackout was [defendant]. And you are back\nto that same issue, why do you believe [defendant]? Why do you believe a wise,\nconvicted burglar and a convicted murderer? . . . And even if you did believe him,\nwhat does it matter? Since even if you are in a blackout, even if you are under the\ninfluence of these drugs, it doesn‘t take away responsibility?‖ The prosecutor\nargued that ―if there was a blackout,‖ the jury still had to decide whether there is\n\n                                          82\n\f―evidence that shows . . . he has formed the intent to kill, that he tortured, et\ncetera.‖ He noted: ―There had to be so much more decisions made. There had to\nbe so much more things done that a drunk who . . . is stumbling and bumbling\ncan‘t do‖ such as finding a key, pulling off a screen, taking control of the victims,\nputting a comforter over the window, cutting cords, finding mousse cans, and\nbinding and penetrating the victims. ―And that is why he isn‘t in a blackout . . .\n[d]espite what he tells us.‖ ―[I]t is too thought out, too planned.‖\n\n                c. Evidence that Valentine stole Deeble’s jewelry\n     Defendant contends that the trial court erred in excluding testimony about\ncertain statements by Paul Roy, who dated Deeble sometime after August 1985.\nRoy was a reluctant witness, and the parties agreed that Sergeant Jessen and\nRobert Courtney, the senior investigator for the Orange County Public Defender‘s\nOffice, could testify as to his statements to them. Before Jessen and Courtney\ntestified, defense counsel made an offer of proof as to what testimony he\nanticipated, and the prosecutor lodged objections. As relevant here, counsel\nasserted, ―[I]n relation to her state of mind near in time to her demise, Marge\nDeeble told Mr. Roy that Kathy [Valentine] would come into the apartment\nsometimes when Marge was not there and would take things out of the apartment\nwhich would upset the victim quite a bit.‖ Counsel also asserted, ―Again, as to her\nframe of mind near in time to her demise, she also told Mr. Roy that — or his\nimpression, he feels that the victim finally removed the key from its hiding place\nin the drain pipe so that the kids could not get into the house while she was gone.‖\n     The prosecutor objected to admission of these statements. He stated that he\ndid not ―see those statements anywhere,‖ but assuming they existed, he objected\non the grounds they were hearsay and irrelevant. Defense counsel responded that\nthe statements reflected an alternate explanation for Deeble‘s missing jewelry, and\n\n\n\n                                           83\n\fwere relevant to Kathryn Valentine‘s credibility as a witness. The prosecutor\nobserved that defendant had never asked Valentine on cross-examination if she\ntook any jewelry. The trial court sustained the objection. It also told counsel he\ncould still put Roy on the stand and ask him questions, and said that whether Roy\ntestified was a tactical decision for counsel to make. Counsel did not re-call Roy.\n     On appeal, defendant contends that Roy‘s ―impression‖ that Deeble removed\nthe key from its hiding place was admissible as a lay opinion under Evidence Code\nsection 800. He did not assert this ground below, and the claim is therefore\nforfeited. It is also meritless. The opinion was wholly speculative, not\n―[r]ationally based on the perception of the witness.‖ (Evid. Code, § 800.)\n     Defendant also contends that Deeble‘s statements to Roy fell into the hearsay\nexception for state of mind evidence. (Evid. Code, § 1250.) He did not assert this\nground below, and the claim is therefore forfeited. It is also meritless. The second\noffer of proof clearly had nothing to do with Deeble‘s state of mind, but merely\nconsisted of Roy‘s unfounded speculation. The first offer of proof was proffered\nnot to show Deeble‘s state of mind, but to demonstrate that Valentine had taken\nitems from Deeble‘s apartment without her permission. As defendant asserts here,\nit was evidence that ―Valentine, and not [defendant], stole Mrs. Deeble‘s jewelry.‖\nThe trial court therefore properly sustained the prosecutor‘s hearsay objection.\nMoreover, even if the first offer of proof could be characterized as evidence of\nDeeble‘s state of mind, nothing in counsel‘s offer indicated when before her death\nDeeble made the statement. Nor, even assuming the statement was made around\nthe time of her death, was Deeble‘s state of mind toward her daughter relevant to\nany issue at trial.\n     Defendant further contends that the first offer of proof fell within the\nexception to the hearsay rule for declarations against interest. (Evid. Code,\n§ 1230.) Nothing in Deeble‘s statement to Roy about her daughter ―created such a\n\n                                         84\n\frisk of making [her] an object of hatred, ridicule, or social disgrace in the\ncommunity, that a reasonable [person] in [her] position would not have made the\nstatement unless [she] believed it to be true.‖ (Ibid.)\n     Defendant further contends that the trial court failed to ―weigh the prejudice\nof excluding [the] testimony compared to its probative value.‖ The proffered\ntestimony was inadmissible hearsay and irrelevant. The trial court had no\nobligation to engage in any weighing process.\n     Finally, defendant summarily contends that even if the testimony was\nproperly excluded under the Evidence Code, it ―should have been admitted\npursuant to [defendant‘s] constitutional right to present a defense.‖ As ― ‗a\ngeneral matter, the ordinary rules of evidence do not impermissibly infringe on the\naccused‘s right to present a defense.‘ ‖ (Dement, supra, 53 Cal.4th at p. 52.)\nDefendant makes no effort to delineate why any exception would apply here.\n\n                d. Evidence regarding defendant’s reaction to news of Deeble’s\n                   death\n     During defendant‘s testimony, he recounted that when he learned of Deeble‘s\ndeath, he and Valentine were visiting his aunt and uncle. Valentine was told she\nhad to go to the Los Alamitos Police Department because something had happened\nto her mother. Valentine and defendant drove to the police station. Defendant\nwaited in the lobby, and after a few minutes he heard Valentine crying. Valentine\nthen came out and told defendant Valentine‘s mother had died. Counsel asked if\ndefendant remembered what Valentine had told him, and the prosecutor objected\non grounds of hearsay and relevance. Counsel asserted the evidence went to ―state\nof mind.‖ The trial court sustained the objection. Counsel then asked defendant if\nhe was ―concerned at all about being at the Los Alamitos Police Department with\n[Valentine] on that date?‖ The trial court sustained the prosecutor‘s relevance\nobjection. Counsel then asked, ―When you left your aunt‘s residence to drive\n\n\n                                          85\n\f[Valentine] to the Los Alamitos Police Department, what were you thinking?‖\nThe trial court again sustained the prosecutor‘s relevance objection. Counsel then\nasked, ―Did you have any fear about going to the Los Alamitos Police Department\nwith her?‖ Defendant answered, ―No, sir.‖\n     On appeal, defendant contends Valentine‘s statement to defendant was\noffered to explain defendant‘s reaction to news of the murder, which was ―a\nrelevant circumstance for the evaluation of guilt.‖ Defendant had already testified\nthat Valentine told him her mother had died; her exact words were irrelevant.\nDefendant was not asked about, and made no offer of proof regarding, what he\nsaid or did in response to her news. We therefore have no basis on which to\nevaluate the admissibility of evidence of his reaction.\n     Defendant further contends that his ―innocent state of mind as he was driving\nto the police station‖ was also ―a relevant circumstance for the evaluation of\nguilt.‖ Even assuming the trial court erred in sustaining the prosecutor‘s relevance\nobjections, there was no prejudice because defendant testified he had no fear about\ngoing to the Los Alamitos Police Department with Valentine.\n\n               e. Evidence regarding Steven Deeble’s interest in bondage\n     Defendant sought admission of an envelope addressed to Deeble‘s son\nSteven and an enclosed flier found by Detective Vic Cantu in a trash can in the\nsecond bedroom in Deeble‘s apartment. On the flier were photographs of a\nwoman in bondage and of Charles Manson, and several articles, including an\narticle about a bondage murder. The trial court sustained the prosecutor‘s\nobjection, stating that if the evidence was offered to show that Steven Deeble\ncould have been the perpetrator, ―you don‘t cross the threshold,‖ the article on\nbondage was not ―even remotely similar to the evidence in this case,‖ and the\nevidence was ―confusing‖ and not helpful to the defense.\n\n\n\n                                         86\n\f     ― ‗[T]o be admissible, evidence of the culpability of a third party offered by a\ndefendant to demonstrate that a reasonable doubt exists concerning his or her guilt,\nmust link the third person either directly or circumstantially to the actual\nperpetration of the crime. In assessing an offer of proof relating to such evidence,\nthe court must decide whether the evidence could raise a reasonable doubt as to\ndefendant‘s guilt and whether it is substantially more prejudicial than probative\nunder Evidence Code section 352.‘ ‖ (People v. McWhorter (2009) 47 Cal.4th\n318, 367-368.) Even assuming Steven Deeble ever saw the flier, defendant failed\nto demonstrate any link between the article and Deeble‘s murder, or that the\nevidence could raise a reasonable doubt as to defendant‘s guilt. Hence the trial\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in excluding the evidence.\n\n                f.   Cumulative Impact\n     Defendant contends that even if we determine none of the errors in excluding\nexculpatory evidence warrant reversal, the cumulative impact of these errors does.\nWe have found no error in excluding any of the evidence, and where we have\nassumed error, we have found no prejudice. Nor do we discern cumulative\nprejudice.\n\n             9. Challenge to Sergeant Jessen’s rebuttal testimony\n     Defendant contends that Sergeant Jessen‘s rebuttal testimony lacked\nfoundation and violated his rights under the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth\nAmendments to the federal Constitution.20 We disagree.\n\n\n\n\n20 Defendant also makes related claims of prosecutorial misconduct and\ninstructional error based on Sergeant Jessen‘s rebuttal testimony. (See post, at\npts. II.B.10, II.B.12.)\n\n\n                                          87\n\f               a. Factual background\n     During the prosecution‘s case-in-chief, no DNA evidence was introduced,\nnor was any other evidence introduced demonstrating that suspects other than\ndefendant had been eliminated by scientific evidence as donors of possible bodily\nfluids at the crime scene. The prosecution introduced evidence that inside\nDeeble‘s thigh was a stain that could have been dried semen. No evidence was\nintroduced that the stain was subsequently tested and determined to be semen.\n     During the defense case, defendant presented evidence that none of the\nfingerprints lifted from Deeble‘s apartment matched his. He also presented\ntestimony from Richard Brown, a criminalist with the Orange County Sheriff‘s\nOffice crime lab, that comparison of defendant‘s pubic hair to pubic hair found at\nthe crime scene eliminated defendant as a source of the crime scene hair. Brown\nwas unable to compare the crime scene hair to that of seven men other than\ndefendant because the hair standards submitted for those individuals contained too\nfew hairs to make a comparison. He sent a report to the Los Alamitos Police\nDepartment stating that the hair standards were inadequate. He was never\nprovided with adequate hair samples. In addition, on approximately October 21,\n1987, Sergeant Jessen spoke with Maggie Black of the Orange County Sheriff‘s\nOffice crime lab regarding elimination prints. Black was dissatisfied with the\nquality of the prints taken of five individuals other than defendant and said they\nwould have to be redone.\n     On rebuttal, the prosecutor asked Sergeant Jessen if he recalled that during\nthe defense case there was testimony that fingerprint exemplars and hair standards\nwere inadequate and had to be redone, but that new samples were never submitted.\nJessen responded affirmatively. After further colloquy, the prosecutor asked,\n―[Y]ou began to focus on [defendant] to the exclusion of the persons that the\ndefense mentioned, correct?‖ Jessen replied, ―Correct.‖ The court overruled\n\n\n                                         88\n\fdefense counsel‘s relevance objection. The prosecutor asked, ―And one of the\nreasons was, was it not, what has already come out that [defendant] refused to\nsupply you with samples of hair, saliva and blood?‖ Jessen said, ―Correct.‖ The\ncourt again overruled defense counsel‘s relevance objection. The prosecutor\nsubsequently asked, ―Another reason, is it not true that these persons had been\neliminated by DNA from providing the samples at the Deeble residence of semen\nand fluids, and [defendant] had not been eliminated, correct?‖ Defense counsel\nobjected on the grounds of lack of foundation and speculation, and the trial court\nsustained the objection. The prosecutor asked to be heard at sidebar.\n     The prosecutor stated that the defense had ―attacked the police for not\nfollowing through and not doing certain things.‖ He asserted that Sergeant\nJessen‘s testimony ―is only going to state of mind. This officer became aware of\ncertain factors, including the DNA results and this is a reason why they didn‘t\ncontinue because these other people had been eliminated. So it is not being\noffered for the truth of the matter. It is being offered to rebut by his state of mind\nwhat the defense is trying to show.‖\n     Defense counsel responded that the testimony was hearsay and speculation in\nthat Sergeant Jessen had ―no basis to form the opinion as to whether these people\nwere eliminated by DNA in the first place. And the second place, it is not true,\nand we can‘t . . . have a mini trial on evidence that was never noticed by the\nprosecution as being part of their case . . . . [N]either side has used DNA in this\ntrial because [the prosecutor] represented before the trial that he was not going to\nput it on. Therefore, we had no [Evidence Code section] 402 [evidentiary\nhearing]. We did not prepare to rebut it because he was never going to use it.‖\nDefense counsel also observed that rebuttal was ―limited to new matter brought up\nby the defense,‖ and the defense case had not referred to DNA evidence. Hence,\nhe argued that even if Jessen ―had the foundation to talk about DNA, even if he\n\n                                          89\n\fhad done the tests, it would be impermissible rebuttal.‖ He moved for a mistrial\n―based upon prosecutorial misconduct in bringing‖ inflammatory and untrue\nevidence ―out in rebuttal.‖ The prosecutor responded: ―It is not being offered for\nthe truth. It is being offered for his state of mind to show he didn‘t do a crappy\njob.‖\n        The trial court denied the mistrial motion, told the prosecutor to avoid the\nterm ―DNA‖ unless he put on the evidence, and said that Sergeant Jessen could\ntestify that in his mind the other persons were eliminated as suspects. The\nprosecutor then inquired whether he could ask Jessen if ―these other persons were\neliminated‖ by ―scientific testing.‖ Defense counsel subsequently responded:\n―[T]his is bringing stuff in through the back door that was never presented in\nevidence. He never even verified that the darn stain was semen. . . .We‘re far off\ninto the realm of speculation, and for stuff that is so inflammatory . . . . [T]he jury\nshould not be allowed to hear it without an adequate foundation.‖ The prosecutor\nasserted that defense counsel was correct ―if it is being offered as substantive\nevidence. It is not.‖ Defense counsel responded : ―[T]he proper witnesses for\nthis are the scientists. He is not the appropriate witness for this information. He is\nnot even an expert who can bring it in as hearsay.‖ The trial court noted that the\nother suspects were not eliminated by the DNA evidence, ―[T]hey are just not tied\ninto a semen stain. He therefore ordered the prosecutor not to use the word\n―DNA.‖\n        Immediately at the end of the sidebar conference, at defendant‘s request, the\ncourt admonished the jury to disregard the reference to DNA: ―Earlier in the trial\nwe told you that certain evidence was being offered for a limited purpose. Well,\nthe last question by the way is stricken. The jury is ordered to disregard it. But\nthese questions of this officer are being offered for a limited purpose, and the\nlimited purpose is this officer‘s state of mind. And what that is relevant to, I think\n\n                                            90\n\fwill become obvious by the questions and by any cross-examination on those\nquestions. The letters ‗DNA‘ were used in the last question. Don‘t assume or\nthink about it. Those letters are stricken. They are meaningless as far as your duty\nis concerned. Is that understood? You can all handle that all right?‖21\n     The prosecutor then asked Sergeant Jessen, ―[I]sn‘t it true that as a result of\nscientific testing that this group of names the defense had mentioned as persons\nwho had supplied inadequate samples that I asked you about before were\neliminated as the donors of the various semen and fluids at the crime scene?‖\nDefense counsel objected on the grounds of lack of foundation and misstating the\ntestimony, and the court told the prosecutor to rephrase the question. The\nprosecutor asked, ―Isn‘t it true that in your mind, based upon information you had\nreceived from other people, lab personnel, that this list of people that the defense\nhad mentioned as people who had provided inadequate samples were eliminated as\ndonors of semen and fluids at the crime scene?‖ The trial court overruled defense\ncounsel‘s foundation objection. Jessen replied, ―Yes.‖ The prosecutor asked,\n―And with that and other information that you had, then you focused on\n[defendant] . . . in your investigation, correct?‖ Defense counsel objected,\n―irrelevant, vague as to time,‖ and the court overruled the objection. Jessen\nanswered, ―Correct.‖ The prosecutor asked, ―But it wasn‘t until you received a\nphone call from Hawaii indicating a homicide that took place over there in 1993\nthat you felt you had enough evidence to actually arrest [defendant], true?‖ Jessen\nreplied, ―Correct.‖ The prosecutor asked no further questions, defendant did not\ncross-examine Jessen, and the jury was excused for the day.\n\n\n21 At the end of the guilt phase, the jury also received the instruction noted above\nthat ―Certain evidence was admitted for a limited purpose.‖ (See ante, at p. 78, fn.\n16.)\n\n\n                                         91\n\f     The following morning, just before the prosecutor‘s closing argument,\ndefense counsel asserted that not only had there never been an evidentiary hearing\nregarding the admissibility of DNA evidence, it appeared that no DNA testing had\nbeen performed. He moved for further admonition because Sergeant Jessen had\ntestified about DNA, the jury was then told to disregard the term DNA, and the\njury was then told further testing was done and Jessen relied on that testing. The\nprosecutor said there ―was DNA testing,‖ but even if defense counsel was ―correct\nand it was other testing,‖ the only question Jessen had answered was regarding\n―scientific testing.‖ The trial court denied the motion for further admonition\nbecause the issue was adequately addressed in the original admonition, and stated,\n―[t]here flat out wasn‘t any [prosecutorial] misconduct.‖\n\n               b. Analysis\n     ―The trial court has broad discretion to determine the admissibility of rebuttal\nevidence and, absent palpable abuse, an appellate court may not disturb the trial\ncourt‘s exercise of that discretion. (People v. Gurule (2002) 28 Cal.4th 557,\n656.)‖ (People v. Valdez (2012) 55 Cal.4th 82, 170.) Defendant contends,\nhowever, that the trial court erred in admitting Sergeant Jessen‘s testimony\nbecause it lacked foundation. He is correct that there was no evidence that any\nscientific testing that eliminated suspects other than defendant as the donors of\npossible bodily fluids found at the crime scene was done, that the results of that\ntesting had been communicated by lab personnel to Sergeant Jessen, or that the\nstain on Deeble‘s thigh was dried semen. The purpose of Jessen‘s testimony,\nhowever, was not to establish that these circumstances were true, but to\ndemonstrate why Jessen had not followed up on requests for further hair and\nfingerprint samples. The testimony was admissible for this relevant nonhearsay\npurpose, and constituted proper rebuttal. (People v. McKinnon (2011) 52 Cal.4th\n\n\n\n                                         92\n\f610, 656 [purpose of testimony regarding rumors that fellow gang member had\nbeen killed by a rival gang was not to prove that the rumors were true, but to show\nthe defendant believed what he heard, and thus had reason to kill the victim].)\n     Defendant further contends that the testimony violated the confrontation\nclause. Assuming the claim is preserved, there was no violation of the\nconfrontation clause because Sergeant Jessen did not recount any statements by\nlaboratory personnel. (See Crawford v. Washington, supra, 541 U.S. at pp. 59-60\n[admission of testimonial statements of a witness who was not subject to cross-\nexamination at trial violates a defendant‘s Sixth Amendment right of\nconfrontation].)\n     Defendant contends that ―through a leading question that ha[d] no basis in\nfact, the prosecutor was able to acquaint the jury with ‗the results‘ of forensic\ntesting that identified [defendant] as the only like[ly] perpetrator of the charged\noffense.‖ The court struck the prosecutor‘s first question regarding DNA, and\ninstructed the jury to disregard it, and in particular to disregard the term ―DNA.‖\nIt further instructed the jury that Sergeant Jessen‘s testimony was admitted for the\nlimited purpose of demonstrating his state of mind, and that the jury could not\nconsider evidence that was admitted for a limited purpose ―for any purpose except\nthe . . . purpose for which it was admitted.‖ Moreover, the jury was aware no\nevidence had been introduced regarding such scientific testing, or demonstrating\nthat the stain was semen, and was further aware that the police did not believe they\nhad sufficient evidence to charge defendant with Deeble‘s murder until seven\nyears later when Delbecq was killed.22 Under these circumstances, the trial court\n\n22 In his written proposed supplemental admonition, defendant requested that the\njury be instructed that testing other than DNA testing led Sergeant Jessen to\nbelieve that the seven named individuals ―were not viable suspects in his mind,‖\nand that ―[t]his evidence is not admitted for the truth of the matter as to whether\n\n\n                                          93\n\fdid not abuse its broad discretion to determine the admissibility of rebuttal\nevidence.\n\n             10. Asserted prosecutorial misconduct\n      Defendant contends the prosecutor engaged in misconduct on numerous\noccasions in violation of his rights under the Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth\nAmendments to the federal Constitution, and state law. ―A prosecutor commits\nmisconduct when his or her conduct either infects the trial with such unfairness as\nto render the subsequent conviction a denial of due process, or involves deceptive\nor reprehensible methods employed to persuade the trier of fact.‖ (People v. Avila\n(2009) 46 Cal.4th 680, 711 (Avila).) In evaluating such a claim, we determine\nwhether there is a reasonable likelihood the jury construed the remarks in an\nobjectionable fashion. (People v. Cash (2002) 28 Cal.4th 703, 733 (Cash).) We\nconclude no prejudicial prosecutorial misconduct occurred.\n\n                   a. Asserted misconduct during examination of witnesses\n      Defendant contends the prosecutor presented misleading evidence when he\nquestioned Sergeant Jessen whether it was true that other suspects had been\neliminated by DNA as donors of semen and other fluids at the murder scene, but\n\n\n\n(footnote continued from previous page)\nthere was other testing or its results,‖ but only ―to explain the officer‘s state of\nmind in not completing hair comparisons of these men with hair from the scene.‖\nSuch instruction would have clarified the purpose of Sergeant Jessen‘s testimony.\nDefendant did not, however, advance this argument during the hearing at which\nthe proposed written instruction was presented, and indeed on appeal does not\nclaim that the trial court erred in not giving this portion of the proposed\nsupplemental instruction. He only asserts that the trial court erred in not\ninstructing the jury with that portion of the proposed admonition which stated that\nSergeant Jessen‘s ―testi[mony]‖ that seven named individuals were eliminated by\nDNA testing was apparently false, and that no DNA testing was performed\nregarding these individuals. (See post, at pt. II.B.12.a.)\n\n\n                                          94\n\fdefendant had not been eliminated. (See ante, at pt. II.B.9.) Defendant‘s\nobjection to the prosecutor‘s question was sustained, and Jessen did not answer the\nquestion. Moreover, the trial court subsequently admonished the jury that the\nquestion was struck, and they were to disregard the term ―DNA.‖ We presume the\njury followed that instruction. (People v. Avila (2006) 38 Cal.4th 491, 574.)\nUnder these circumstances, even assuming the prosecutor committed misconduct\nby asking the question, no prejudice was possible under any standard. (People v.\nPinholster (1992) 1 Cal.4th 865, 943 [no prejudice since the defense objection was\nsustained, the court directed there be no further reference to the subject matter, the\nwitness did not answer the question, and the jury was instructed to disregard the\nquestion].)\n     Defendant further contends that the prosecutor repeatedly ignored court\nrulings by referring to inadmissible and inflammatory matters in front of the jury.\nIn particular, he asserts that the prosecutor repeatedly and improperly denigrated\nDr. Wolf on cross-examination. In the challenged exchange, the prosecutor asked,\n―Now, from what I have heard you told us these women were really both pretty\ndarn lucky because neither of them really suffered or felt any pain before they\ndied?‖ The court sustained defense counsel‘s objection that the question was\nargumentative. The prosecutor asked, ―Didn‘t you, in response to [defense\ncounsel‘s] series of questions, basically have both of these women unconscious\nand not feeling any pain before they died?‖ Dr. Wolf replied, ―Yes.‖ The\nprosecutor asked, ―And so if I were to show you then Exhibit[] 1, a photograph of\nMrs. Deeble in death, and Exhibit 33, a photograph of Mrs. Delbecq in death, you\nare going to tell us, doctor, that these women did not feel any pain before they\ndied?‖ Dr. Wolf answered, ―Yes.‖ The prosecutor asked, ―They were fortunate,\nindeed, weren‘t they?‖ The court sustained defense counsel‘s objection that the\nquestion was argumentative. The circumstance that the prosecutor asked two\n\n                                          95\n\fquestions ruled argumentative does not demonstrate that he infected the trial with\nsuch unfairness as to render the subsequent conviction a denial of due process, or\nengaged in deceptive or reprehensible methods employed to persuade the trier of\nfact. (Avila, supra, 46 Cal.4th at p. 711.)\n     Defendant also contends that the prosecutor reminded the jury of his\n―improper attack on Dr. Wolf[]‖ during closing argument. The prosecutor said,\n―Exhibit 1 and Exhibit 33, these are the two . . . photographs I held up. You are\ntelling us that these women did not feel any pain? And I was a little sarcastic,\nfrankly, when I asked that. Do we have that much to be grateful for that they\ndidn‘t feel . . . pain. He said, no, they did not feel pain. . . . That is ridiculous.\nThat defies common sense.‖ Defendant did not object below to the prosecutor‘s\nargument, no exception to the general requirement of an objection is applicable,\nand the claim is therefore forfeited. (People v. Schmeck (2005) 37 Cal.4th 240,\n286 (Schmeck).) The claim is also meritless. The prosecutor‘s questions to\nDr. Wolf on cross-examination were objectionable because they were\nargumentative, but argumentative statements are appropriate during closing\nargument. A prosecutor‘s ―argument may be vigorous as long as it is a fair\ncomment on the evidence, which can include reasonable inferences or deductions\nto be drawn therefrom.‖ (People v. Harrison (2005) 35 Cal.4th 208, 244.) Here,\nthe gravaman of the argument was simply that Dr. Wolf‘s opinion that neither\nDeeble nor Delbecq felt pain lacked credibility. To the extent there is a reasonable\nlikelihood the jury construed the prosecutor‘s argument as referring to the\nquestions for which defendant‘s objections were sustained, there is no possible\nprejudice given that at the same point in the questioning Dr. Wolf twice agreed\nwith the prosecutor that in his opinion the victims had not felt pain.\n     Defendant further contends the prosecutor engaged in an ―improperly\nargumentative style of examination‖ when cross-examining Janice Hunt and\n\n                                            96\n\fdefendant. The prosecutor asked Hunt why she had exposed her ―precious\ndaughter to a heavy drug user like‖ defendant. As defendant notes, his objection\nto this line of questioning was overruled. Moreover, Hunt explained that she did\nnot think defendant was using drugs at the time he lived with Hunt and her\ndaughter. Nor did the prosecutor commit misconduct during his cross-\nexamination of defendant when — in response to defendant‘s testimony that his\ndrug and alcohol use kept him from success as a father and husband and in holding\ndown a job — he asked defendant if this lack of success was because he was not\nwilling to take responsibility for his choices, or when he challenged defendant that\nhe knew ―darn well‖ that individuals who wanted to get help and recover from\naddiction are able to do that. As defendant notes, the trial court overruled\nobjections to these questions, and defendant fails to demonstrate how they\nconstituted misconduct.\n     Defendant further asserts the prosecutor asked Hunt an argumentative\nquestion, and improperly challenged her credibility in front of the jury. The\nprosecutor asked Hunt if she recalled giving defendant a ―big wave and a big\nsmile‖ at the lunch break. Hunt replied, ―Yes.‖ The prosecutor asked, ―You still\ncarry a little bit of a torch for him?‖ Hunt replied, ―I still feel he is innocent.‖ The\nprosecutor said, ―That is not my question, ma‘am.‖ Hunt said, ―I am sorry.‖ The\nprosecutor then asked the question defendant challenges here: ―You wanted to say\nthat, didn‘t you?‖ The trial court sustained defense counsel‘s objection that the\nquestion was argumentative. The prosecutor asked, ―When I asked you if you still\ncarried a torch for him, why did you talk about his innocence?‖ The court\noverruled defense counsel‘s objection that the question was argumentative. Hunt\nreplied, ―To me he seems like a decent human being.‖ The prosecutor asked,\n―That is not my question. When I asked you . . . if you still carried a torch for\nhim, why did you talk about his innocence instead of whether or not you still\n\n                                          97\n\fcarried a torch for him?‖ Hunt replied that she did not understand what the\nprosecutor meant by ―carry a torch.‖ The prosecutor asked, ―You don‘t know\nwhat that phrase means, ma‘am?‖ Hunt replied, ―No, sir.‖ The court overruled\ndefense counsel‘s objection that the question was argumentative. The prosecutor\nasked, ―You have feelings for him still, do you not?‖ Hunt replied, ―As a friend,\nyes.‖\n        Defendant makes no attempt to demonstrate how the prosecutor‘s question\ninfected the trial with such unfairness as to render the subsequent conviction a\ndenial of due process, or constituted a deceptive or reprehensible method\nemployed to persuade the trier of fact. (Avila, supra, 46 Cal.4th at p. 711.)\nMoreover, the prosecutor was entitled to explore the basis for any bias on Hunt‘s\npart for defendant.\n        Defendant further asserts that the prosecutor committed misconduct when he\nasked defendant if Kathryn Valentine was lying when she testified about how\noften she saw defendant drunk or using drugs, and that defendant was ―aware of a\nkey at her mother‘s residence and of a screen.‖ When defendant said as to each of\nthese events that Valentine was lying, the prosecutor asked if defendant knew why\nshe would lie, and defendant said he did not know the reason. No misconduct\noccurred. Defendant had personal knowledge both of these events, and of\nValentine, and hence knew whether Valentine‘s testimony was accurate and what\nmotivation she might have to lie. (Chatman, supra, 38 Cal.4th at pp. 382-383.)\n        Defendant further contends that the prosecutor improperly asked defendant to\ncomment on the testimony of Dr. Stalcup. On cross-examination, defendant\nagreed with the prosecutor that Dr. Stalcup had testified that as one continues to\ndrink alcohol, fine motor coordination is first affected, and eventually gross motor\ncoordination. The prosecutor asked, ―Dr. Stalcup never said that you as an addict\nor a user of alcohol didn‘t go through those stages, did he?‖ Defendant replied,\n\n                                          98\n\f―No. . . . He doesn‘t know me.‖ The prosecutor asked, ―He doesn‘t know you?‖\nDefendant replied, ―Dr. Stalcup, he has never interviewed me.‖ The prosecutor\nsaid, ―[H]e talked about people in your condition, did he not?‖ Defendant replied,\n―Yes.‖ In the now challenged question, the prosecutor asked, ―That was the whole\npoint of his testimony, wasn‘t it?‖ Defendant replied, ―Yes.‖ Defense counsel\nobjected that the question called for speculation, and the trial court sustained the\nobjection and struck the answer.\n     No misconduct is apparent. Contrary to defendant‘s assertion, the\nprosecutor‘s question was not a ―sarcastic aside[],‖ but simply stated the\nreasonable inference that Dr. Stalcup had been called to testify about drug and\nalcohol addiction. The jury, who had heard Dr. Stalcup‘s testimony, would\nreasonably draw the same inference.\n\n               b. Asserted denigration of defense counsel\n     Defendant contends the prosecutor committed misconduct during closing\nargument by denigrating defense counsel. ―A prosecutor commits misconduct if\nhe or she attacks the integrity of defense counsel, or casts aspersions on defense\ncounsel.‖ (People v. Hill (1998) 17 Cal.4th 800, 832; People v. Frye (1998) 18\nCal.4th 894, 978 (Frye) [a prosecutor‘s argument that denigrates defense counsel\n―directs the jury‘s attention away from the evidence and is therefore improper‖].)\n―In evaluating a claim of such misconduct, we determine whether the prosecutor‘s\ncomments were a fair response to defense counsel‘s remarks‖ (People v. Young\n(2005) 34 Cal.4th 1149, 1189 (Young)), and whether there is a reasonable\nlikelihood the jury construed the remarks in an objectionable fashion (Cash, supra,\n28 Cal.4th at p. 733).\n     During defense counsel‘s closing argument, he observed that to convict\ndefendant of torture murder, the jury was required to find that the perpetrator\n\n\n\n                                          99\n\f―intended to inflict prolonged pain, something that lasts a long time.‖ He then\nargued that ―[i]f the first thing that happened was that [Deeble] was strangled, she\nwould be unconscious in less than a minute,‖ if she received a knock-out blow, she\nwould be unconscious immediately, and ―Dr. Fukumoto isn‘t going to say\nanything different from‖ Dr. Wolf. The prosecutor interrupted, and said ―That is\nnot true, your honor, and in fact . . . unconsciousness is irrelevant and [defense\ncounsel] knows it.‖ Defense counsel said, ―I object to the constant objections.‖\nThe trial court sustained the prosecutor‘s objection. Defendant asserts that the\nprosecutor ―voiced [an] opinion to the jury that defense counsel had intentionally\nsought to mislead them.‖ There is no reasonable likelihood the jury construed the\nprosecutor‘s comment that defense counsel ―knows it‖ as an attack on counsel‘s\nintegrity. Even if the comment could be so construed, it was fleeting, and\ntherefore harmless. (See Young, supra, 34 Cal.4th at p. 1190.)\n     Defendant contends the prosecutor interrupted defense counsel‘s closing\nargument twice with the complaint that he had been personally attacked. In the\nfirst instance, defense counsel argued that whatever the substance was that was on\nthe ridge of the mousse can, it could not have come from Deeble‘s vagina or\nrectum because there was no blood in those orifices. In so doing, he said, ―[Y]ou\nknow why [the prosecutor] wanted to ride through his false front western town\nreal fast.‖ The prosecutor objected ―to the repeated personal attacks that [defense\ncounsel] feels necessary to go after me.‖ The trial court stated, ―Stick with the\nevidence, [defense counsel], if you don‘t mind.‖ In the second instance, defense\ncounsel observed that ―it is not only the L.A. Narcotics officers who want\n[Dr. Stalcup] to tell them about drugs, but Janet Reno, the Attorney General of this\ncountry. And if the prosecutor is going to pooh pooh that because [Reno] is a\nDemocrat, then Dan Lungren who is the Attorney General of the state who is a\nRepublican —‖ The prosecutor objected, ―Why does [defense counsel] have to\n\n                                         100\n\fbring me into every argument?‖ The trial court stated, ―I don‘t know what politics\nhave to do with this particular case, [defense counsel].‖ Defense counsel replied,\n―Nothing at all, your honor.‖ The court said, ―Then stay away from it.‖ It is not\napparent, and defendant does not explain, how the prosecutor‘s objections\nimproperly denigrated defense counsel.\n     Defendant further contends that the prosecutor denigrated defense counsel\nwhen he responded to defense counsel‘s use of the word ―derisory.‖ Defense\ncounsel called the prosecutor‘s implication that Dr. Wolf had not performed\n―enough trauma autopsies,‖ and was ―underqualified‖ because he did not work for\na sheriff, ―derisory.‖ On rebuttal, the prosecutor asserted: ―[T]here is a word\n[defense counsel] used in describing me twice yesterday, a word called\n‗derisory.‘ . . . And he was in the middle of attacking me personally over and over\nand over again when he was using that word.‖ The trial court overruled defense\ncounsel‘s objection that the argument was improper. The prosecutor said: ―So I\nfigured it had to be some kind of a snap at me, ‗derisory.‘ . . . I got a copy of it out\nof the dictionary . . . [and] [t]hat didn‘t help me very much. . . . Well, I looked up\n‗derision,‘ . . . and it says an object of ridicule or scorn, a laughing stock. That is\nwhat they think of me. That is what they think of this case.‖ Contrary to\ndefendant‘s claim, the prosecutor‘s statements were fair rebuttal.\n     Nor did the prosecutor impermissibly attack defense counsel on rebuttal\nwhen he argued: ―I was attacked for cheating — let‘s see what did [defense\ncounsel] say. Fake fronts, western towns.‖ The prosecutor recalled a ―Western\nanalogy‖ of individuals lighting fires outside around a home in an effort to get the\noccupants of the home to leave ―and try to put the fire out.‖ He subsequently\nargued: ―They try to create fires by never really responding to the other challenge\nI made. What is the defense, I asked? . . . Is your defense that your client didn‘t do\nit, or is your defense that your client did it but there was no crime, there was no\n\n                                          101\n\ftorture? . . . Or is your defense that because of alcohol, you had a blackout and,\ntherefore, you aren‘t responsible? What was the response to my question? Ladies\nand gentlemen, we don‘t know what you are going to believe. We don‘t know\nwhich fire you are going to go out and chase. So we give you all of these, and you\nmake up your mind. They don‘t know what the defense is. They are defending\nthe defendant without knowing the defense. They are hoping that by attacking the\npolice, by attacking the crime scene, by attacking me, that is the old . . . law school\ndeal . . . ‗If the facts are on your side, you argue the facts. If the law is on your\nside, you argue the law. If neither is on your side, you attack your opponent.‘\nThat is the only way I can explain. . . . So I don‘t know why [defense counsel] had\nto get up here and start this attack.‖ Defense counsel said, ―I am going to object to\nthe personal attacks, improper argument.‖ The court overruled the objection. The\nprosecutor continued: ―The only thing I can think of is trying to light a fire,\nhoping that I would run out trying to put it out and hoping you would run out and\nchase it, but I won‘t do that. What did I finish with . . . yesterday? These are\nhonorable men. I don‘t know why [defense counsel] felt he had to do that. I am\nnot going to change my opinion that they are honorable men. . . . I am not going to\ngo after them that way. I will not do it.‖\n     As can be seen, other than to the comment ―I don‘t know why [defense\ncounsel] had to get up here and start this attack,‖ defendant did not object to the\nprosecutor‘s argument, no exception to the general requirement of an objection is\napplicable, and his claim is therefore forfeited on appeal. (Schmeck, supra,\n37 Cal.4th at p. 286.) Moreover, his claim as to all portions of the argument is\nmeritless. The prosecutor‘s comments were fair rebuttal to defense counsel‘s\ncharacterization of the prosecution evidence as a ―false front western town.‖ They\nwere also supported by evidence at trial of varying defenses of alibi, insufficient\nevidence of torture, and lessened culpability because of a blackout. ―We accord\n\n                                          102\n\fthe prosecutor wide latitude in describing the factual deficiencies of the defense\ncase.‖ (Cash, supra, 28 Cal.4th at p. 733.) Contrary to defendant‘s assertion,\nnothing in the argument ―carried the clear implication that defense counsel did not\nbelieve in [defendant‘s] innocence‖ or believe their own client.\n\n                 c. Additional asserted misconduct during closing argument\n     Defendant contends that the prosecutor lessened the People‘s burden of proof\nbeyond a reasonable doubt during his closing argument. The prosecutor theorized\nthat either defendant had graduated to a more sadistic level when he killed\nDelbecq, or that Deeble had died too quickly so he did not have a chance to\npenetrate her with the mousse can ―all the way up.‖ He then argued: ―Would you\ngive him . . . the benefit of the doubt on that? Would you think it was - now I am\ntalking about something different than proof beyond a reasonable doubt, okay? I\nam talking about knowing this man as you know him, is there a reason that a\nperson who is brutally torturing women, are you going to give him a benefit as to\nhis motivation? Are you going to say he probably did it differently because it is\nnot the same guy? [O]r are you going to assume the worst? Would it be fair in\nthis case to assume the worst that the motivation, that the reason he couldn‘t get\nmore sexually involved with these mousse cans was because he killed her too fast?\nI say it would be fair. You will ultimately determine whether it would be fair or\nnot; it is true or not. I submit under these facts it is fair. I submit it is . . fair not to\ngive him the benefit of any factual or mental, anything to his benefit.‖ Defense\ncounsel objected, ―[T]his is an improper lessening of the burden of proof on the\nprosecution,‖ and asked that the prosecutor be admonished. The trial court stated:\n―I am going to instruct the jury. You are going to get a chance to rebut, and the\njury will follow the court‘s instructions.‖ The prosecutor continued: ―You\nunderstand what I am saying? I want to repeat it. I don‘t want the defense to be\n\n\n\n                                            103\n\f[accusing me of] doing something I shouldn‘t be. I am not talking about the\nburden of proof.‖\n     During the defense closing argument, counsel asserted that the prosecutor\n―did a nice job when he tries to make you think that what you are doing here is\neasy. It is not easy. . . . And when he tells you at the tail end of his argument that\nhe is not asking you to decide this case on less than beyond a reasonable doubt,\nwell, you know, you can all remember . . . 15 minutes ago in the core of his\nargument, you know, he said exactly that. . . . He said don‘t give this man the\nbenefit of the doubt, and he said as to issues of specific intent and mental state,\ndon‘t give him the benefit of the doubt. He said that —‖ The prosecutor objected,\n―Your Honor, that is not what I said.‖ The court replied: ―Well, it is in the record\nand it is in your memories. If you need help, my reporter will find it for you.\nOkay? The People have the burden of proof. I don‘t recall anybody trying to\nlessen that. And if somebody did, ignore it. You will get the law. I will read it to\nyou very carefully, and I am going to give it to you in writing. And what I tell you\nabout the law is what counts.‖ Defense counsel continued, ―Ladies and\ngentlemen, when [the prosecutor] asked you to decide the case against [defendant]\non a less than reasonable doubt, which that is what he means when he says don‘t\ngive him the benefit of the doubt —‖ The prosecutor said: ―That is not what it\nmeans. That is not what I said, and I am going to object. It is improper. It is\nmisstating my argument.‖ The trial court sustained the objection.\n     Viewing the prosecutor‘s comments in context, he argued that differences\nbetween the Deeble and Delbecq murders did not mean they were not committed\nby the same perpetrator. Moreover, during this portion of his argument the\nprosecutor twice reminded the jury he was not talking about his burden of proof\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. The trial court subsequently instructed the jury that\nthe prosecutor had the burden of proof, to ignore any contrary statements by\n\n                                         104\n\fcounsel, and that what the court said about the law ―is what counts.‖ In addition,\nthe prosecutor vehemently denied he had asserted the jury should decide the case\non a standard less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt, and the jury was properly\ninstructed on the standard of proof. There is thus no reasonable likelihood the jury\nconstrued the prosecutor‘s remarks as properly suggesting that the burden of proof\nwas not guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n     Defendant further contends the prosecutor improperly suggested that if the\nDeeble and Delbecq murders were not uniquely similar, the defense would have\nintroduced contrary evidence. The prosecutor said: ―[D]id you hear any of the\ndefense witnesses . . . come in here and tell you how these mousse cans got in both\nplaces? Did they have an explanation for you at any point along the way? None.\nIt cannot be explained. Do they have access to show us all the other murders out\nthere that happened this same way? Of course they do. There aren‘t any.‖ The\ntrial court sustained defense counsel‘s objection that the argument assumed facts\nnot in evidence, and struck the comment. Thus, even assuming the prosecutor‘s\ncomment rose to the level of misconduct, there was no possible prejudice given\nthe trial court immediately sustained defendant‘s objection and struck the\ncomment.\n     Defendant further contends that the prosecutor committed misconduct by\nexpressing a personal belief in defendant‘s guilt when he referred to defendant as\nthe ―killer.‖ The prosecutor argued: ―[W]ith all these similarities‖ between the\nDeeble and Delbecq murders, ―so sick, so similar, so telling, the whole sexual\nmotivation of both, how is it possible with all of that that this defendant is not the\nkiller? . . . And none of you will be able to walk out of that room . . and say, well,\nyeah, yeah, you know, these mousse cans and all this other stuff, well, they didn‘t\nreally tell us that much. You know . . . any killer that knew both had access to\nthese women, one knew her, one he lived by, that is just what any killer would\n\n                                         105\n\fhave done. See, when you come to that conclusion, when you arrive there, then\nwhether or not pubic hairs got left or not or blown around or whatever doesn‘t\nmean very much. Because you know that, whereas maybe that evidence would be\nin a crime scene or maybe it wouldn‘t. You know it wasn‘t here, legitimately\nwasn‘t here. And that is just the way it was. Because he is the killer, and it just\ndidn‘t happen. I hope you see what I am saying by that. The possibilities of\ninterpretation go away when you know what happened.‖\n     ―[P]rosecutors should not purport to rely in jury argument on their outside\nexperience or personal beliefs based on facts not in evidence.‖ (People v. Medina\n(1995) 11 Cal.4th 694, 776.) Here, however, the prosecutor simply asserted based\non the evidence that defendant was the murderer of Deeble and Delbecq. No\nmisconduct occurred.\n\n                 d. Cumulative prejudice\n     Defendant contends that the ―cumulative prejudice of overall misconduct\nrequires a new trial.‖ We have found no misconduct, and where we have assumed\nmisconduct, we have found no prejudice under any standard. Nor do we discern\nany cumulative prejudice.\n\n            11. Limitation of defense counsel’s closing argument\n     Defendant contends that the trial court improperly limited defense counsel‘s\nclosing argument on two occasions. A trial court ―is given great latitude in\ncontrolling the duration and limiting the scope of closing‖ argument. (Herring v.\nNew York (1975) 422 U.S. 853, 862.) It ―may ensure that argument does not stray\nunduly from the mark, or otherwise impede the fair and orderly conduct of the\ntrial.‖ (Ibid.; § 1044 [―It shall be the duty of the judge to . . . limit the . . .\nargument of counsel to relevant and material matters‖].) We conclude the trial\ncourt did not abuse its broad discretion here.\n\n\n\n                                            106\n\f     During defense counsel‘s closing argument, he argued that ―[i]f the first\nthing that happened was that [Deeble] was strangled, she would be unconscious in\nless than a minute,‖ if she received a knock-out blow, she would be unconscious\nimmediately, and ―Dr. Fukumoto isn‘t going to say anything different from‖\nDr. Wolf. The prosecutor interrupted, and said ―That is not true, your honor, and\nin fact . . . unconsciousness is irrelevant and [defense counsel] knows it.‖ Defense\ncounsel said, ―I object to the constant objections.‖ The trial court sustained the\nprosecutor‘s objection. Defense counsel continued his argument, and observed:\n―The intention of the perpetrator to cause prolonged pain is critical. Nobody\nintending to cause prolonged pain would knock out their victim. It defeats the\npurpose. No one intending to cause prolonged pain would ligature strangle their\nvictims so fast that their brain swells up and they lose consciousness in less than a\nminute. Look, this isn‘t as complicated as [the prosecutor] makes it want to seem.\nEvery time you have seen any TV trauma, anything with torture in it, what is the\ncommon feature? The people doing the torturing want the people getting tortured\nto stay awake. When they pass out, they throw a bucket of water on them. If you\nlook at torture down through history . . . they never wanted anybody to lose\nconsciousness. They wanted them to answer the question . . . . When torture is\nused in time of war, it is to get the unfortunate person being . . . tortured to give up\nthe information he has, not to make him pass out. That is crazy. You defeat the\npurpose. The purpose is what the statute says, . . . the intent to inflict prolonged\npain on someone else. . . . No doubt in the case of Miss Deeble a couple of blows\nwere struck very quickly. . . . Probably one to the nose first. One to the abdomen\ndamaging the pancreas, boom, boom, subdue the victim and then what? And then\nstrangle her. . . . This woman was not tortured.‖\n     Defendant contends that unconsciousness was not irrelevant because ―an\nassailant‘s decision to render his victim quickly insensible to pain is powerful\n\n                                          107\n\fcircumstantial evidence that he did not intend to cause‖ extreme and prolonged\npain. As can be seen, counsel was not precluded from making such an argument,\nand ably did so.\n     Defendant also contends that the trial court improperly limited closing\nargument when it precluded him from playing a four- or five-minute television\nstory. During argument, defense counsel asserted that ―[m]any times in life\nsimilarities are coincidences.‖ He recalled seeing a recent news story about a\ncouple in Illinois who won about $2,500,000 in the state lottery and learned that\nthe previous owners of their home had also won a large amount in the state lottery.\nHe also recounted numerous similarities between President Kennedy and President\nLincoln, and observed that if one added the numbers in the date on which the\nmurders in the O. J. Simpson case occurred, they equaled 32, which was\nSimpson‘s number when he played professional football. He also noted that if one\nadded the numbers in the date on which Deeble was killed they also equaled 32,\nand wondered where O. J. Simpson was on May 12, 1986.\n     Counsel then began to describe a television story that had been broadcast\nseveral months earlier about two women who had never met, but shared numerous\nsimilarities including the same name and date of birth, and said he was going to\nplay the four- or five-minute video. The prosecutor objected, and a hearing was\nheld at sidebar. The court sustained the objection under Evidence Code section\n352 and for lack of foundation, but permitted defense counsel to describe the\nsimilarities between the two women to the jury.\n     The trial court acted well within its discretion in excluding the videotape.\nContrary to defendant‘s assertion, the court was entitled to rely on counsel‘s\ndescription of the tape, and was not required to personally view the tape before\nruling. Here, counsel‘s central point was that there can be similarities between\nevents or individuals without those individuals or events being related, and hence,\n\n                                        108\n\fsimilarities between the Deeble and Delbecq murders did not mean that defendant\ncommitted both murders. Counsel was given considerable leeway to make this\npoint including informing the jury of all of the similarities from the videotape that\ncounsel deemed relevant.\n\n            12. Asserted instructional error\n\n                a. Failure to give requested defense instructions\n      Defendant contends the trial court erred in declining to instruct the jury in the\nlanguage of his proposed special instruction in violation of his rights under the\nFifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the federal Constitution. Not\nso.\n      Defendant first claims that the trial court erroneously refused proposed\ndefense instructions on the issue of other crimes evidence to show identity. The\nfirst proposed instruction read: ―The greatest degree of similarity is required for\nevidence of uncharged misconduct to be relevant to prove identity. For identity\nto be established, the uncharged misconduct and the charged offense must share\ncommon features that are sufficiently distinctive so as to support the inference\nthat the same person committed both acts. [Citation.] ‗The pattern and\ncharacteristics of the crimes must be so unusual and distinctive as to be like a\nsignature.‘ [Citation.]‖ This instruction was properly refused. The first\nsentence was confusing, because the instructions elsewhere did not address the\ndegree of similarity required for common plan or intent. The second sentence was\nalready contained in the jury instructions. (People v. Gurule, supra, 28 Cal.4th at\np. 659 [the trial court need not give duplicative instructions].) The trial court\nproperly refused to give the third sentence on the ground that it was too vague to\nassist the jury, and gave adequate instructions to the jury on the standard to apply\n\n\n\n\n                                         109\n\fwhen determining whether Delbecq‘s uncharged murder was sufficiently similar\nto Debble‘s charged murder to demonstrate identity.\n     The second proposed instruction provided: ―If you have no doubt that the\nperpetrator of the Los Alamitos homicide was Mr. Edwards, then you may\nconsider the evidence of the Hawaii homicide on the issue of intent in the Los\nAlamitos homicide.‖ The court properly refused to give this instruction ―as\nwritten‖ on the ground that it was an incorrect statement of the law. (Ewoldt,\nsupra, 7 Cal.4th at p. 393.) Although defendant contends the trial court should\nhave modified the instruction to conform to the law, no modification was\nsuggested below.\n     Defendant further contends that the trial court erred in refusing his request\nfor further admonishment the day after Sergeant Jessen‘s rebuttal testimony. (See\nante, at pt. II.B.9.) In particular, he claims the court should have instructed the\njury with the following portion of the proposed further admonishment: ―A\nstatement was made yesterday that requires a further admonition. Sergeant Jessen\ntestified that the seven named individuals were eliminated by ‗DNA testing.‘\nAfter consultation with the attorneys it appears that statement was false. There\nnever was DNA testing done regarding the seven named individuals. Other testing\nled Sergeant Jessen to believe that they were not viable suspects in his mind.‖\n     No error in refusing the request for further admonition is apparent. Sergeant\nJessen did not answer the question about DNA. Moreover, the trial court‘s\nadmonishment the previous day informed the jury that the question regarding\n―DNA‖ was struck, and it was to disregard the term ―DNA.‖ We presume the jury\nfollowed that instruction. (People v. Avila, supra, 38 Cal.4th at p. 574.)\n\n\n\n\n                                         110\n\f               b. Omission during oral jury instructions\n     During the oral jury instructions, the trial court omitted the word ―living‖\nfrom the murder by torture and torture-murder special-circumstance instructions.\nHowever, the written instructions, which the jury received, used the word ―living.‖\nIn addition, the prosecutor used the word ―living‖ when he read the murder by\ntorture instruction to the jury during closing argument, and defense counsel did so\non two occasions when reading a portion of the torture-murder special-\ncircumstance instruction.\n     Moreover, immediately after the court instructed the jury, defense counsel\ntold the court he did not recall hearing the word ―living.‖ Counsel then said he\nwas satisfied if the word ―living‖ appeared in the written instructions. No request\nto further instruct the jury was made.\n     ―We of course presume ‗that jurors understand and follow the court‘s\ninstructions.‘ [Citation.] This presumption includes the written instructions.\n[Citation.] To the extent a discrepancy exists between the written and oral\nversions of jury instructions, the written instructions provided to the jury will\ncontrol.‖ (People v. Wilson (2008) 44 Cal.4th 758, 803.) Here, the written\ninstructions contained the word ―living,‖ and both counsel used the word ―living‖\nduring argument. There is therefore no ―reasonable likelihood the jury applied the\nchallenged instructions in an impermissible manner.‖ (Ibid.)\n\n           13. Asserted cumulative error\n     Defendant contends that cumulative guilt phase error requires reversal. We\nhave found no error, and where we have assumed error, we have found no\nprejudice. Nor do we discern cumulative prejudice.\n\n\n\n\n                                         111\n\f       C. Second Penalty Phase Issues\n\n           1. Asserted restrictions on voir dire\n     Defendant contends the trial court improperly restricted voir dire as to two\njurors who sat on his jury, and two prospective jurors, in violation of his rights\nunder the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the federal\nConstitution. He asserts the inadequate voir dire gave counsel insufficient\ninformation to appropriately determine challenges for cause. This claim borders\non the specious.\n     As to the prospective jurors who did not sit on defendant‘s jury, even\nassuming error, no prejudice could have resulted from any limitation on voir dire.\n(People v. Roldan (2005) 35 Cal.4th 646, 692.)\n     As to Prospective Jurors Nos. 212 and 166, who did serve on defendant‘s\njury, defendant contends that the trial court ―repeatedly refused to allow‖ trial\ncounsel to ask these prospective jurors ―whether they would automatically return a\nverdict of death in a case involving generalized facts likely to be presented by the\nprosecutor (a brutal double homicide).‖ He asserts that although counsel was\npermitted to ask Prospective Juror No. 166 whether he ―would automatically vote\nfor death in a double homicide case,‖ he should have been permitted to add to his\nhypothetical the generalized facts that the double homicides involved torture,\nburglary, sexual assault, and strangulation. The record demonstrates no such\nlimitations on voir dire.\n     After the hardship excusals, and before death qualification voir dire began,\nthe court read the information to the prospective jurors, including Prospective\nJurors Nos. 212 and 166. The prospective jurors thereby learned that defendant\nhad been convicted of murdering Deeble while engaged in the commission of\nburglary, and that the murder was intentional and involved the infliction of torture.\nMoreover, voir dire was not sequestered. At the beginning of voir dire,\n\n\n                                         112\n\fProspective Juror No. 212 was placed in the box, and Prospective Juror No. 166\nwas in the courtroom. The court told the prospective jurors: ―For those of you in\nthe audience, I would appreciate it if you listen very carefully to all of my\nquestions, all of the responses given by the jurors in the box, and please do the\nsame when the attorneys are asking questions.‖ The trial court subsequently told\nthe prospective jurors while Prospective Juror No. 212 was in the box: ―You will\nhear evidence of a sexual nature. . . . I am not telling you that there is going to be\nevidence that these things occurred. . . I am just wanting you to think about it to\nsee if you will be able to evaluate evidence. Rape, sodomy. Can you objectively\nevaluate evidence concerning sexual acts such as those I just mentioned?\nAnybody with a negative answer? The record does not reflect that Prospective\nJuror No. 212 responded. The court also said: ―[Y]ou also heard that one of the\nspecial circumstances in this case involved torture. And I am assuming that when\nI said that, you probably thought of something; is that a fair statement? Probably\nthought of pain? Can you objectively discuss torture or things that the prosecution\nfor sure would refer to torture and you may or may not agree, but can you discuss\nthose things?‖ No response from any prospective juror is reflected in the record.\n     In addition, defense counsel described the crimes to the prospective jurors,\nsaying, ―[Y]ou are going to hear evidence . . . . about a murder that involves a\nstrangulation; it involves a sexual assault with a foreign object; it involves blows\nto the head; a second murder that involves sexual assault with a foreign object,\nblows to the head and strangulation.‖ A short time later, when questioning\nProspective Juror No. 212, defense counsel noted: ―[Y]ou heard a little factual\nscenario that I have given. Those are really awful crimes.‖ Prospective Juror\nNo. 212 replied, ―Yes.‖ Defense counsel asked, ―And is that the kind of crime\nwhere you think that the death penalty is always going to be warranted?‖ The\nprosecutor objected to the question ―as phrased‖ because it asked the prospective\n\n                                          113\n\fjuror to ―prejudge,‖ and the trial court sustained the objection. Defense counsel\nthen asked, ―Is that the kind of case where the death penalty would always be\nwarranted in your mind without listening to any other evidence?‖ Prospective\nJuror No. 212 replied, ―To answer your question, I don‘t think the death penalty is\nalways warranted in any case.‖\n     Defense counsel then began questioning a different prospective juror, and in\nso doing asked: ―Now, specifically you heard the description I gave of some acts\nthat involve strangulation, sex with foreign objects, intentional torture on two\noccasions, are those the kinds of crimes . . . that when you hear them, you will no\nlonger be open to listening to anything mitigating or any evidence in mitigation\nabout [defendant]?‖ Likewise, when questioning yet another prospective juror,\ndefense counsel said: ―As you know, when you came in here and his honor told\nyou this morning, [defendant] has already been convicted of first degree murder\nwith a torture special circumstance, intentional torture, and with doing that murder\nin the commission of a burglary. Okay? He‘s already been convicted beyond a\nreasonable doubt. And you also will hear circumstances about in 1993 in Hawaii,\nthere‘s a similar murder that involves torture and murder. And both the crimes\ninvolved the use of sex with foreign object . . . either anally or vaginally, okay?‖\nDefense counsel subsequently returned to questioning Prospective Juror No. 212,\nand said: ―You heard me describe in more detail this afternoon, you‘ve had the\nlunch hour to think about it, some facts that have been described by some of the\njurors as being heinous. . . . [A]s you sit there now and think about those facts,\nhave you made up your mind that this is the kind of case that should automatically\nreceive the death penalty?‖ Prospective Juror No. 212 replied, ―No.‖\n     Two days later, Prospective Juror No. 166 was questioned by a different\nmember of the defense team, who asked: ―[Y]ou sat through the entire process the\nlast couple of days that we have been going through, have you not?‖ Prospective\n\n                                         114\n\fJuror No. 166 replied, ―Absolutely.‖ Defense counsel subsequently asked, ―Can\nyou, sir, see yourself returning a verdict of life without the possibility of parole for\na person who has been convicted of first degree premeditated, intentional murder,\ntorture, burglary, sexual assault, strangulation and there is another homicide in\nHawaii of a similar nature that you as a juror, I am just telling you factually, have\nfound to be true that he is responsible for as well?‖ The court sustained the\nprosecutor‘s objection that the question ―calls for prejudgment and speculation as\nphrased.‖ Defense counsel then asked, ―Can you see yourself returning a verdict\nof life without the possibility of parole, depending upon the evidence that has been\npresented to you for a person who has been convicted of first degree murder,\ntorture and burglary and that that homicide involved a sexual assault,\nstrangulation, and you find as a juror that [defendant] is also responsible for a\nsimilar type of homicide in Hawaii?‖ The court again sustained the prosecutor‘s\nobjection. Defense counsel then asked, ―Are you open to considering the evidence\nin this case, mitigating factors that may be presented to you in this case and having\nthe possibility of returning a verdict of life without the possibility of parole?‖\nProspective Juror No. 166 replied, ―I am definitely open to considering all the\nfacts before I render any type of decision.‖ Defense counsel asked, ―Would you\nvote for the death penalty in every case in a situation where you have found a\nperson guilty of more than one homicide?‖ Prospective Juror No. 166 replied,\n―No, I would not.‖\n     ―Our decisions have explained that death-qualification voir dire must avoid\ntwo extremes. On the one hand, it must not be so abstract that it fails to identify\nthose jurors whose death penalty views would prevent or substantially impair the\nperformance of their duties as jurors in the case being tried. On the other hand, it\nmust not be so specific that it requires the prospective jurors to prejudge the\npenalty issue based on a summary of the mitigating and aggravating evidence\n\n                                          115\n\flikely to be presented.‖ (Cash, supra, 28 Cal.4th at pp. 721-722.) As can be seen,\ncontrary to defendant‘s claim, the prospective jurors here were well aware of the\ngeneralized facts regarding the two homicides, including the circumstance that\nthey involved torture, burglary, sexual assault with a foreign object, and\nstrangulation. On this record, the circumstance that the court sustained the\nprosecutor‘s objection to two questions to Prospective Juror No. 166, and one\nquestion to Prospective Juror No. 212, because they were deemed to improperly\nseek prejudgment of the facts, does not demonstrate that voir dire was improperly\nlimited.\n\n            2. Asserted error in ruling on challenges for cause\n\n                a. Prosecution challenge for cause\n     Defendant contends that the trial court erroneously excused Prospective Juror\nNo. 180 because of her views regarding the death penalty in violation of his rights\nunder the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the federal\nConstitution, and article I, sections 1, 7, and 15-17 of the state Constitution. We\ndisagree.\n\n                    1) Factual background\n     In her questionnaire, in response to a question about Prospective Juror No.\n180‘s general feelings regarding the death penalty, she stated: ―I think the death\npenalty satisfies an emotional need to dramatically express the seriousness of the\ncrime. I think it is unnecessary and not a deterrent to crime. I think it is not given\nequally. I would not want the burden of knowing my decision put a person to\ndeath.‖ In response to a question about whether the death penalty was used too\noften, too seldom, or randomly, she stated, ―I do think it is used randomly, and in\nsome places innocent people are put to death to ‗send a message.‘ ‖ When asked\nwhether she had such a conscientious opinion concerning the death penalty that\n\n\n                                         116\n\fshe would automatically refuse to vote for the death penalty in any case regardless\nof the evidence, she wrote, ―No, but I lean strongly in that direction and would not\nwant [to] make that choice for death.‖\n        During voir dire, the trial court asked the prospective jurors ―if any of you\nhave strong personal feelings concerning these possible penalties.‖ Prospective\nJuror No. 180 said, ―As I expressed in my questionnaire, I feel I would have a\ngreat deal of difficulty selecting the death penalty for a person.‖ The court said\nthat it had read her questionnaire, and asked if she had ―anything in addition to\nwhat you wrote there?‖ Prospective Juror No. 180 said, ―The more I think about it\nthe less I think I could vote for the death penalty.‖ After further colloquy with the\ncourt, she added, ―[P]ersonally I just feel that I shouldn‘t . . . be the one to decide\nthat somebody should die and other considerations that I put in the questionnaire.‖\nThe court subsequently asked, ―Could you ever vote for a penalty of death\ndepending upon the evidence and the law that I read to you?‖ Prospective Juror\nNo. 180 replied, ―I really think I would have a very hard time living with that\nvote.‖ The court said, ―Okay. That really wasn‘t my question. Okay. We‘ll get\nback to you.‖ Prospective Juror No. 180 said, ―Then I will say no.‖ The court\nsaid, ―I don‘t want you to say anything. I want you to tell me what your thoughts\nare.‖\n        During sequestered voir dire, the trial court noted Prospective Juror No. 180\nhad been through the process of voir dire with other jurors, and asked, ―Has your\nposition changed at all as to an appropriate penalty as to your ability to come up\nwith a penalty in this case?‖ Prospective Juror No. 180 answered, ―I don‘t think\nso.‖ The court asked, ―You would vote for a penalty of life without possibility of\nparole?‖ She answered, ―I think that is probably as high as I could go.‖ After\nfurther colloquy, the court asked, ―Could you ever vote for a penalty of death?‖\nProspective Juror No. 180 said, ―What I feel is . . . I might feel that the person\n\n                                           117\n\fdeserves that, but at the same time, I would feel that it is not for me to judge – it is\nnot for me to decide that. And that there are cases where it is not even handed.\nAnd I feel being in the situation, being forced to choose in the jury situation, that I\nwould find that extremely stressful. . . . I really don‘t think that in my conscience I\nwould want to vote for death. I think I might come to a place where . . . I could\nnot make any decision.‖ The court asked, ―Are you saying that you would either\nvote for life without possibility of parole or not even vote at all?‖ Prospective\nJuror No. 180 replied, ―I am saying that sometimes I find decision making\nextremely stressful. And it may be it might come to that. Sometime I get very\ndepressed when I have to make hard decisions.‖ The court asked, ―Your views on\nthe death penalty have not changed at all from the moment you came in until\nnow?‖ Prospective Juror No. 180 replied, ―No.‖\n     Defense counsel gave Prospective Juror No. 180 background on the weighing\nprocess at the penalty phase, and said that a juror was never required to vote for\ndeath. She then asked, ―In that framework . . . will you consider both of those\npenalties in making your decision, will you consider them both?‖ Prospective\nJuror No. 180 replied, ―I don‘t think I can.‖ Defense counsel urged Prospective\nJuror No. 180 not to get upset, and asked, ―[C]an you even consider both penalties\nbefore you make a decision?‖ She answered, ―I think, no, I can‘t.‖ Defense\ncounsel subsequently asked, ―Can you see yourself weighing aggravating and\nmitigating factors and finding the aggravating outweighing mitigating and\nconsidering death as a potential penalty?‖ Prospective Juror No. 180 replied, ―I\ncould consider it, but I don‘t want to vote for it.‖\n     The prosecutor asked Prospective Juror No. 180, ―Before you came in the\nother week, had you spent a lot of time thinking about [this issue] or not?‖ She\nreplied, ―I think about it. It is one thing to sit home and read about a crime and\nsay that person deserves to die, and it is another thing to sit there and be one of the\n\n                                          118\n\f12 people who says this person will die.‖ The prosecutor said, ―Right.‖\nProspective Juror No. 180 said, ―And I think I am pretty clear where I stand on\nthat.‖ After further colloquy, the prosecutor asked, ―The bottom line, Juror\nNumber 180, if you are back in the jury room, and even in your own mind you are\nsaying you know what, under the law this is a case that does deserve the death\npenalty, but you are not going to vote for the death penalty are you? That is the\nbottom line here, correct? Isn‘t that what you have been saying here all along?‖\nShe replied, ―I think so.‖\n     The prosecutor challenged Prospective Juror No. 180, and the defense\nattorney argued she was ―very, very equivocal,‖ and cause had not been\nestablished. The trial court sustained the challenge: ―See, that is the problem,\n[defense counsel], we know where it lies. We can play with words on the record\nall we want. Here is where it lies: This lady was very emotional and was to my\nquestions, to [defense counsel‘s] questions and to [the prosecutor‘s] questions,\nvery emotional. And if you watched her walk back to the jury room, she was near\ntears. We are talking about a stressful event. There is no way, no matter what the\nevidence, no matter what the law, that this lady could ever vote for a penalty of\ndeath. No way. Or vote at all. That is another problem. She indicated or vote at\nall. Not in those words, but that is the concept.‖\n\n                    2) Analysis\n     ―The federal constitutional standard for dismissing a prospective juror for\ncause based on his or her views of capital punishment is ‗ ―[w]hether the juror‘s\nviews would prevent or substantially impair the performance of his duties as a\njuror in accordance with his instructions and his oath.‖ ‘ ‖ (People v. Friend\n(2009) 47 Cal.4th 1, 56, quoting Uttecht v. Brown (2007) 551 U.S. 1, 7; see\nWainwright v. Witt (1985) 469 U.S. 412.) ― ‗On appeal, we will uphold the trial\n\n\n\n                                         119\n\fcourt‘s ruling if it is fairly supported by the record, accepting as binding the trial\ncourt‘s determination as to the prospective juror‘s true state of mind when the\nprospective juror has made statements that are conflicting or ambiguous.‘ ‖\n(People v. Barnett (1998) 17 Cal.4th 1044, 1114.)\n     No error appears in excusing Prospective Juror No. 180 for cause. The\nrecord demonstrates that this prospective juror‘s responses were consistent with\nrespect to her ability to follow the law concerning imposition of the death penalty,\nand substantial evidence supports the court‘s ruling. Prospective Juror No. 180\nsaid she ―would not want the burden of knowing my decision put a person to\ndeath,‖ she could not consider both penalties before making a decision, and when\nasked if she could ever ―vote for a penalty of death depending upon the evidence\nand the law‖ she ultimately said ―[N]o.‖ Moreover, even if her responses could be\ndeemed equivocal, the trial court was in a position, which we are not, to view her\ndemeanor. ―Deference to the trial court is appropriate because it is in a position to\nassess the demeanor of the venire, and of the individuals who compose it, a factor\nof critical importance in assessing the attitude and qualifications of potential\njurors.‖ (Uttecht v. Brown, supra, 551 U.S. at p. 9.) The court observed that\nProspective Juror No. 180 was very emotional during questioning and near tears\nwhen she returned to the jury room, and concluded there was ―no way‖ she could\never vote for the death penalty. This determination of her state of mind is binding.\n\n                b. Defense challenges for cause\n     Defendant contends the trial court erred in denying a defense challenge to\nProspective Juror No. 254 for cause, in violation of his right to an impartial jury\nunder the Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the federal Constitution.\nFollowing the court‘s refusal to excuse Prospective Juror No. 254 for cause,\ndefendant used a peremptory challenge to excuse her.\n\n\n\n                                          120\n\f     Defendant has not preserved this claim on appeal because, as he concedes, he\ndid not use all of his peremptory challenges. (People v. Farley (2009) 46 Cal.4th\n1053, 1095-1096.) Defendant asserts that ―trial counsel had no reason to believe\nthat the exercise of additional peremptory challenges would produce a jury that\nwas more fairly disposed‖ because the trial court had improperly restricted voir\ndire, and consequently ―his ability to judge the qualifications of the panel was\nfatally impaired.‖ We have concluded above that the trial court did not improperly\nrestrict voir dire. (See ante, at pt. II.C.1.) Moreover, even assuming the trial court\nerred in denying the challenge for cause, defendant does not claim that any sitting\njuror was biased. ―So long as the jury that sits is impartial, the fact that the\ndefendant had to use a peremptory challenge to achieve that result does not mean\nthe Sixth Amendment was violated.‖ (Ross v. Oklahoma (1988) 487 U.S. 81, 88;\nPeople v. Gordon (1990) 50 Cal.3d 1223, 1248, fn. 4 [finding the high court‘s\nreasoning in Ross persuasive and ―applicable to the state constitutional analogues\nto the federal constitutional rights‖ to due process and an impartial jury considered\nin Ross].)\n\n             3. Admission of other crimes evidence\n\n                a. Testimony of N.T.\n     Defendant contends the trial court erred in admitting the testimony of N.T.\nNot so.\n     At the first penalty trial, N.T. testified in a manner substantially similar to her\ntestimony at the second penalty phase trial. (See ante, at p. 24.) Before her\ntestimony at the retrial, defendant asserted that N.T.‘s testimony that she awoke to\nfind defendant trying to penetrate her vaginally and anally with a bottle did not\ndemonstrate a crime within the meaning of section 190.3, factor (b), and was\nunduly prejudicial because of its similarities to the circumstances of the capital\n\n\n\n                                          121\n\fcrime. The court, which had heard and since reread N.T.‘s testimony at the first\npenalty phase trial, admitted the evidence.\n     In determining whether to admit challenged other-crimes evidence, the trial\ncourt considers whether the prosecution has adduced substantial evidence to prove\neach element of the other crime activity. (People v. Griffin (2004) 33 Cal.4th 536,\n584; People v. Phillips (1985) 41 Cal.3d 29, 72, fn. 25.) ―Substantial evidence of\nother violent criminal activity is evidence that would allow a rational trier of fact\nto find the existence of such activity beyond a reasonable doubt.‖ (Griffin, at\np. 584.) ―[A] trial court‘s decision to admit ‗other crimes‘ evidence at the penalty\nphase is reviewed for abuse of discretion, and no abuse of discretion will be found,\nwhere, in fact, the evidence in question was legally sufficient.‖ (People v. Boyer,\nsupra, 38 Cal.4th at p. 477, fn. 51.)\n     Here, defendant does not advance any reason why N.T.‘s testimony did not\ndescribe criminal activity, but merely asserts that no rational trier of fact would\nhave found N.T.‘s testimony true beyond a reasonable doubt. He relies on the\ncircumstances that her testimony was uncorroborated, no testimony was elicited\nfrom defendant that the incident ever took place, N.T. did not contemporaneously\nfile a complaint with law enforcement, and she had a motive to fabricate the\nincident because she was defendant‘s former girlfriend and ―displayed obvious\ndisdain and anger towards [defendant] during her testimony.‖ These\ncircumstances, however, merely demonstrate weaknesses in the testimony, not its\ninsufficiency.\n\n                 b. Alleged jail misconduct\n     Defendant contends the trial court erred in admitting evidence defendant\npossessed a shank in the Orange County jail. ― ‗It is settled that a defendant‘s\nknowing possession of a potentially dangerous weapon in custody is admissible\n\n\n\n                                         122\n\funder [section 190.3,] factor (b). Such conduct is unlawful and involves an\nimplied threat of violence even where there is no evidence defendant used or\ndisplayed it in a provocative or threatening manner.‘ ‖ (People v. Smithey (1999)\n20 Cal.4th 936, 1002 (Smithey).) Defendant asserts, however, that we should\nreach a different result here because his possession of the shank was transitory,\nand ―his spotless disciplinary record in prison was utterly inconsistent‖ with any\nfinding other than ―he intended to use it, if at all, for self-defense and not to\nengage in criminal activity.‖ Neither defendant‘s explanation at trial that he did\nnot intend to use the weapon, but merely thought others would be less likely to\nattack him if they knew he was armed, nor the circumstance that defendant was\nnot cited for weapon possession on any other occasion, affects the admissibility of\nthe evidence. (Id., at pp. 1002-1003.)\n\n           4. Admission of victim impact testimony\n     Defendant contends the trial court erred in admitting victim impact testimony\nin violation of his rights under the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth\nAmendments to the federal Constitution, and analogous provisions of the state\nConstitution. We disagree.\n     ―Prior to 1991, evidence of a murder‘s impact on a victim and the victim‘s\nfamily and friends was not admissible in the penalty phase of a capital trial.\n(Booth v. Maryland (1987) 482 U.S. 496, 501-502; People v. Ochoa (1998)\n19 Cal.4th 353, 455, fn. 9.) The federal high court later reversed itself in Payne v.\nTennessee (1991) 501 U.S. 808 (Payne), deciding that ‗[v]ictim impact evidence is\nsimply another form or method of informing the sentencing authority about the\nspecific harm caused by the crime in question‘ (id. at p. 825) and was thus\nadmissible evidence. We have followed the high court‘s lead [citation] and have\nalso found such victim impact evidence admissible as a circumstance of the crime\n\n\n\n                                          123\n\fpursuant to section 190.3, factor (a).‖ (People v. Boyette (2002) 29 Cal.4th 381,\n443-444.)\n     Here, defendant‘s crime but not his trial occurred before Payne v. Tennessee,\nsupra, 501 U.S. 808. Contrary to defendant‘s assertion, we have repeatedly held\nthat ―retroactively applying the high court‘s decision in Payne v. Tennessee does\nnot violate the prohibition against ex post facto laws.‖ (People v. Famalaro\n(2011) 52 Cal.4th 1, 38.)\n     Nor did the trial court erred in admitting photographs of Deeble and her\nfamily. We have reviewed the photographs, and conclude they were ―relevant to\nhumanize the victim and provide some sense of the loss suffered by [her] family\nand society.‖ (People v. Dykes (2009) 46 Cal.4th 731, 785 (Dykes).) The\nphotographs are typical of those taken at family gatherings, and contrary to\ndefendant‘s assertion, the circumstance that not every family member who\nappeared in the photographs testified would not ―inflame the jury with speculative\nimaginings.‖\n     Defendant also contends that the testimony of Lorraine Johnson that she felt\nlike a mother to Deeble, and that Deeble was the younger sister she had always\nwanted, and Kathryn Valentine‘s testimony that she felt she contributed to her\nmother‘s death by introducing her to defendant, fell ―outside the parameters of\nadmissible [victim] impact testimony.‖ We disagree. ― ‗[U]nless it invites a\npurely irrational response, evidence of the effect of a capital murder on the loved\nones of the victim and the community is relevant and admissible under section\n190.3, factor (a) as a circumstance of the crime. [Citation.] The federal\nConstitution bars victim impact evidence only if it is so unduly prejudicial as to\nrender the trial fundamentally unfair.‘ ‖ (People v. Vines (2011) 51 Cal.4th 830,\n889.) Here, the challenged testimony fell well within these bounds and was\n\n\n\n                                        124\n\fsimilar to that we have previously upheld. (See People v. Murtishaw (2011)\n51 Cal.4th 574, 579, 581, 595; Dykes, supra, 46 Cal.4th at pp. 780-782.)\n\n           5. Admission of expert testimony regarding blackouts and defendant’s\n              mental state\n     Defendant contends the trial court erred in admitting the expert testimony of\nDr. Dietz on rebuttal in violation of his rights under the Fifth, Eighth, and\nFourteenth Amendments to the federal Constitution, and article I, sections 7, 15,\n17, and 24 of the state Constitution. We disagree.\n     During the defense penalty case, defendant testified he did not recall\ncommitting the murders, and defendant, Janice Hunt, and William Farmer testified\nto occasions on which defendant could not later remember events that occurred\nwhile he was drinking. In addition, Dr. Stalcup testified that during a blackout, an\nindividual generally has immediate memory or awareness of what he or she is\ndoing, but alcohol, tranquilizers, and barbiturates block the transfer of the memory\nto long-term memory. In moderate blackouts, individuals wake up the next day\nand cannot remember what they did the previous day, and in severe blackouts,\nindividuals cannot remember what they are doing at that moment. Father\nMcAndrew testified that blackouts are often symptomatic of the disease of\naddiction, and that he had experienced alcoholic blackouts, and was ashamed of\nthe things he was told he had done during them. Linda Lauer, a registered nurse\nand certified substance abuse counselor, testified that alcoholic blackouts are a\nhallmark symptom of alcoholism, and did not involve passing out, but more of a\n―walking amnesia.‖\n     On rebuttal, the prosecutor called Dr. Park Dietz, a clinical professor of\npsychiatry and biobehavioral sciences at the University of California at Los\nAngeles School of Medicine. Defendant objected to Dr. Dietz‘s testimony, and\nthe court held an evidentiary hearing at which Dr. Dietz testified outside the\n\n\n                                         125\n\fpresence of the jury. The court ruled that Dr. Dietz could testify as to what a\nblackout is, and that an individual in a blackout state would have a present\nmemory and act consciously, intentionally, and meaningfully in making choices.\nThe court precluded testimony regarding sexual sadism and the circumstance that\nsome individuals later reacquire memory of events that occurred while they were\nintoxicated. Although the record is unclear, the court also appeared to rule that\nDr. Dietz could not opine that based upon the crime scenes in this case the\nperpetrator‘s acts were voluntary and intentional. Dr. Dietz then testified before\nthe jury. (See ante, at pp. 39-40.)\n     Defendant contends that Dr. Dietz‘s testimony was inadmissible under\nEvidence Code section 801, subdivision (a), because the jury could easily draw the\nsame conclusions without an expert‘s testimony. As noted above, ―Evidence Code\nsection 801 qualifies a matter as the proper subject for expert testimony if it is\n‗sufficiently beyond common experience that the opinion of an expert would assist\nthe trier of fact.‘ That is not to say, however, that the jury need be wholly ignorant\nof the subject matter of the expert opinion in order for it to be admissible.\n[Citation.] Rather, expert opinion testimony ‗ ―will be excluded only when it\nwould add nothing at all to the jury‘s common fund of information, i.e., when ‗the\nsubject of inquiry is one of such common knowledge that men of ordinary\neducation could reach a conclusion as intelligently as the witness‘ ‖ [citation].‘ ‖\n(Jones, supra, 54 Cal.4th at p. 60.) Here, Dr. Dietz‘s testimony regarding what a\nblackout is, and what an individual is aware of during an event that he or she\ncannot later remember, was beyond the common experience of the jury and\nassisted it in determining defendant‘s culpability for his actions.\n     Defendant further contends that because no defense expert testified defendant\nwas in a blackout state during the crimes, Dr. Dietz‘s testimony was improper\nrebuttal. We disagree. As can be seen, during the defense case numerous lay and\n\n                                         126\n\fexpert witnesses testified regarding blackouts and defendant‘s apparent experience\nof such a phenomenon.\n     Defendant also contends that Dr. Dietz‘s testimony was substantially more\nprejudicial than probative or, phrased another way, that his testimony posed an\nintolerable risk to the fairness of the proceedings or the reliability of the outcome.\n(Riggs, supra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 290.) In particular, defendant contends the jury‘s\nfunction as the trier of fact on the issue of intent was usurped by Dr. Dietz‘s\nimpermissible expert opinion that defendant was in a conscious and deliberate\nframe of mind at the time of the homicide. Although defendant does not cite to\nthe record, we assume he is referring to Dr. Dietz‘s testimony: ―[A]s he is\ncommitting the homicides, . . . he is behaving intentionally [and] voluntarily. He\nknows where he is, what he is doing, who he is with, why he is engaging in each\naction, what he wants to do next, which things please him and which things don‘t.\n. . . Now, he may not know what he did five minutes ago or ten minutes ago. He\nmay be in a blackout already for those. But for what he just did and what he is\ngoing to do next, he is not in any blackout at all. He is right there in the present\ntense in the moment doing as he pleases.‖ The testimony was relevant to rebut the\napparent defense that because defendant was experiencing a blackout when he\ncommitted the offenses, he was less culpable. Nor was it unduly prejudicial.\nContrary to defendant‘s assertion, the testimony was in response to a hypothetical\nquestion by the prosecutor, and hence was not an expert opinion regarding\ndefendant‘s state of mind. Moreover, at the penalty phase the jury was no longer\nmaking factual determinations regarding defendant‘s intent, but rather was\ndetermining his appropriate sentence.\n\n\n\n\n                                         127\n\f           6. Exclusion of evidence of remorse and mitigating victim impact\n              testimony\n     Defendant contends the trial court erred in excluding testimony regarding\ndefendant‘s remorse, and testimony from Deeble‘s son that he did not want\ndefendant executed, in violation of his rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth\nAmendment to the federal Constitution. Not so.\n\n               a. Evidence of remorse\n     During the defense penalty case, Sergeant Morris testified that in 1993, while\ndefendant was at the Maui Community Correctional Facility, there were two\nescape attempts from defendant‘s housing area. As to the first escape, Morris\ntestified: ―There was an escape, and he wasn‘t even involved. He could have\ngone with them, I guess, but he chose not to.‖ Counsel asked, ―[D]id you find\n[defendant] still to be there and the other people gone?‖ Morris replied, ―Yes.‖\nCounsel asked, ―Did you ever discuss that with him?‖ Morris replied, ―I talked to\nhim. He says, I am going to do my time.‖ The prosecutor‘s hearsay objection was\nsustained. As to the second escape, counsel asked, ―And the second time did\n[defendant] go?‖ Morris said, ―No.‖ Counsel asked, ―Other inmates left the\nfacility?‖ Morris replied, ―Yes, they did.‖ The individuals who escaped were\nrecovered on both occasions.\n     Sergeant Aguiar similarly testified that in 1993 four inmates escaped from\ndefendant‘s module. Aguiar found defendant sitting in his cell with the door\nlocked. Counsel asked, ―Did he say anything at that time?‖ The trial court\nsustained the prosecutor‘s objection on grounds of relevance and hearsay. Aguiar\nsubsequently testified that at the time he saw defendant after the escape there were\nno guards in defendant‘s area. Defense counsel asked, ―So, in essence, there was\nnobody to stop [defendant] from leaving?‖ Aguiar replied, ―No, ma‘am.‖\nCounsel asked, ―But he remained behind?‖ Aguiar said, ―Yes, ma‘am.‖\n\n\n                                        128\n\f     Defendant testified that he now believed he had killed Deeble and Delbecq,\nalthough he had no recollection of their murders. Defendant felt ―horrible,‖\nfasted, meditated, and prayed on the dates of the murders, and ―always pray[ed]\nfor the families.‖\n     Family friend Bridget Briggs testified that when defendant arrived at the\nOrange County jail in 1994, he told Briggs that he ―didn‘t remember doing any of\nthe things that they were saying that he did. But if he did, . . . he should be\npunished accordingly.‖\n     Over the prosecutor‘s objection, Reverend Winter testified that sometimes\ndefendant would break down and cry because he said he did not remember what\nhe had done. Defendant said that if he had killed Delbecq, he was a ―monster.‖\nHe also said, ―if I had done that . . . it is horrible, I shouldn‘t be allowed to live in\nsociety.‖ Defendant would ask Winter ―to pray for the family,‖ and ―we would\npray together, and he would cry.‖ Defendant took full responsibility for his\naddiction, and did not offer drugs and alcohol as an excuse for his situation.\n       Later that same day, William Farmer, a friend of defendant‘s, testified that\nshortly after defendant‘s arrest in Hawaii he spoke with defendant by telephone.\nDefense counsel asked, ―[W]hat was it that he told you in that conversation?‖ The\nprosecutor‘s hearsay objection was sustained. Counsel argued that the testimony\nwent to defendant‘s state of mind. The court said, ―It‘s redundant.‖ Counsel then\nasked Farmer about a conversation he had with defendant while visiting him in\njail. Farmer asked defendant ―if he knew that he committed these crimes.‖\nCounsel asked, ―And what was his response?‖ The court sustained the\nprosecutor‘s objection that the question called for hearsay and was cumulative.\nCounsel asserted that this was ―the same issue we had this morning‖ on\ndefendant‘s state of mind. The court said, ―But you got it in this morning.‖\n\n\n\n                                           129\n\fCounsel said, ―This is a different witness.‖ The court said, ―The objection is\nsustained.‖\n       Lynn Pendzik subsequently testified that once while defendant was on trial\nin Hawaii he refused a visit with her. Defendant subsequently wrote to her:\n―Remember during the trial when it was at the most horrible testimony? You\ncame up that weekend and I refused your visit. Do you know why I did that? I\ndid it because I was utterly appalled by what they had shown in court and that I\nwas responsible for it. And I hated myself, and I felt that you certainly must hate\nme. I was ashamed and I did not want to face you.‖\n       Defendant‘s sister Elena testified that after defendant was arrested in\nHawaii, she visited him in jail every weekend. During one visit, defendant looked\ndown and told Elena, ―[I]f I did do this, I don‘t ever want to get out.‖\n       Near the end of the defense penalty case, Father McAndrew was asked by\ndefense counsel, ―In the conversations that you had with [defendant], did he ever\nexpress to you any remorse for the homicide that he was in custody here on?‖ The\nprosecutor‘s objection that the question called for hearsay and was cumulative was\nsustained. Counsel asked, ―Just with respect to the homicide in Los Alamitos that\noccurred in 1986, did he ever express any remorse to you?‖ The prosecutor‘s\nobjection on the same grounds was again sustained.\n       ―The Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments require that the sentencer in a\ncapital case not be precluded from considering any relevant mitigating evidence,\nthat is, evidence regarding ‗any aspect of a defendant‘s character or record and any\nof the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a\nsentence less than death.‘ ‖ (Frye, supra, 18 Cal.4th at p. 1015.) Nonetheless,\n―the United States Supreme Court never has suggested that this right precludes the\nstate from applying ordinary rules of evidence to determine whether such evidence\nis admissible.‖ (Smithey, supra, 20 Cal.4th at p. 995; see Romano v. Oklahoma\n\n                                         130\n\f(1994) 512 U.S. 1, 12 [―The Eighth Amendment does not establish a federal code\nof evidence to supersede state evidentiary rules in capital sentencing\nproceedings‖].)\n     Here, defendant relies on Green v. Georgia (1979) 442 U.S. 95, 97 which, as\nwe have described it, ―held that a defendant‘s due process rights are violated when\nhearsay testimony at the penalty phase of a capital trial is excluded, if both of the\nfollowing conditions are present: (1) the excluded testimony is ‗highly relevant to\na critical issue in the punishment phase of the trial,‘ and (2) there are substantial\nreasons to assume the reliability of the evidence.‖ (People v. Kaurish (1990)\n52 Cal.3d 648, 704.) In Green, the evidence was ―highly probative of the\ndefendant‘s innocence.‖ (Smithey, supra, 20 Cal.4th at p. 996.) ―By contrast, we\nhave held that if the exculpatory value of the excluded evidence is tangential, or\ncumulative of other evidence admitted at trial, exclusion of the evidence does not\ndeny the accused due process of law.‖ (Ibid.) Here, even assuming reliability, the\nmitigating value of the excluded testimony was cumulative to the ample evidence\nof defendant‘s remorse adduced through the testimony of defendant, Bridget\nBriggs, Reverend Winter, Elena Edwards, and Lynn Pendzik. Hence, exclusion of\nthis testimony ―did not violate the Eighth Amendment or deprive defendant of due\nprocess of law.‖ (Id., at p. 997.)\n\n                b. Scott Deeble’s testimony\n     Scott Deeble, Marjorie Deeble‘s son, testified that in the 12 years since his\nmother‘s death, he had learned that ―I cannot appreciate the ecstasy of my joy if I\ndo not embrace the depth of my grief. I have learned the big lesson in\nforgiveness.‖ Counsel then asked Scott what he meant by forgiveness, and\nwhether he felt forgiveness for defendant, and after each question the court\nsustained the prosecutor‘s relevance objection. Scott subsequently was asked how\n\n\n\n                                          131\n\fhe had personally been affected by his mother‘s death. He replied that it was a\nhuge loss, ―[b]ut I‘ve had to search for . . . meaning. I‘ve had to . . . find what I\nneed in life. I need compassion and I need forgiveness. And I‘m only entitled if I\ndon‘t deny someone else the same.‖ The prosecutor objected, and the last portion\nof Scott‘s response was stricken. Counsel then asked if Scott felt ―sympathy or\ncompassion‖ for defendant. The prosecutor‘s objection was overruled, and Scott\nreplied, ―I do feel compassion.‖\n     Defendant contends that the trial court improperly precluded him from\nintroducing ―mitigating victim impact testimony.‖ The trial court‘s rulings did not\nprevent defendant from showing the jury the effect of the murder on Scott Deeble,\nwhich is all defendant was entitled to do under Penal Code section 190, factor (a).\n\n           7. Asserted prosecutorial misconduct\n     Defendant contends that the prosecutor committed prejudicial misconduct in\nviolation of his federal and state rights to a fair trial and reliable determination of\npenalty. We disagree. As noted above, ―A prosecutor commits misconduct when\nhis or her conduct either infects the trial with such unfairness as to render the\nsubsequent conviction a denial of due process, or involves deceptive or\nreprehensible methods employed to persuade the trier of fact.‖ (Avila, supra, 46\nCal.4th at p. 711.) In evaluating such a claim, we determine whether there is a\nreasonable likelihood the jury construed the remarks in an objectionable fashion.\n(Cash, supra, 28 Cal.4th at p. 733.) We conclude no prejudicial prosecutorial\nmisconduct occurred.\n\n                a. Dr. Dietz’s testimony\n     As noted above, the trial court allowed Dr. Dietz to testify on rebuttal\nregarding what a blackout is, and that an individual in a blackout state would have\na present memory and act consciously, intentionally, and meaningfully in making\n\n\n\n                                          132\n\fchoices. The court precluded testimony regarding sexual sadism and the\ncircumstance that some individuals later reacquire memory of events that occurred\nwhile they were intoxicated. Although the record is unclear, the court also\nappeared to rule that Dr. Dietz could not opine that based upon the crime scenes in\nthis case the perpetrator‘s acts were voluntary and intentional.\n     The prosecutor asked Dr. Dietz to consider the two murder scenes and the\nacts that were committed on the victims, and ―assuming that the defendant in this\ncase . . . is the perpetrator of both those crimes, has been found guilty by a jury\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, how would an alcoholic blackout, if he had been in\none, . . . have affected what he did during those murders?‖ After the court\noverruled defense counsel‘s foundation objection, Dr. Dietz answered that\nassuming defendant committed both homicides, and ―assuming that he now has no\nmemory whatsoever of either homicide‖ because of the effects of alcohol, ―that\nwould mean that he is now in a blackout for both homicides. But it doesn‘t tell us\nanything about his mental state at the time of the homicides except that he was\ndrunk.‖ Dr. Dietz continued, ―And looking at what happened in each homicide,\nwe learn a lot about his mental state at the time of the homicides that shows if\nintoxicated he wasn‘t too intoxicated to engage in a very orderly sequence of\ncomplicated behaviors.‖\n     The prosecutor subsequently asked, ―When you talk about the sequence of\nevents, you are referring to the various things . . . that were done to the two\nvictims, correct?‖ After the court overruled defendant‘s objection, Dr. Dietz\nreplied: ―The things done to gain access to each victim, to do things to the victims\nand their property and to leave the scene. The whole sequence of events.‖ The\nprosecutor then asked, ―[A]ssuming . . . that the defendant was in an actual —\nwhen he says he doesn‘t remember, assuming that that is truthful, you have said\nthat . . . the blackout does not affect his mental state while he was perpetuating the\n\n                                         133\n\facts?‖ Dr. Dietz replied, ―Correct, the blackout doesn‘t begin until later.‖ He\nexplained, ―[It] begins at least seconds after each action, maybe minutes, but the\nblackout is what he is later in. It is not something he is in while he is doing it.‖\n     The prosecutor subsequently asked, ―[S]o as he is committing the various\nacts during the homicide, how do we characterize his mental state at this point?‖\nDr. Dietz replied, ―Well as he is committing the homicides, I think it is fair to say\nthat he is behaving intentionally voluntarily. He knows where he is, what he is\ndoing, who he is with, why he is engaging in each action, what he wants to do\nnext, which things please him and which things don‘t. . . . Now, he may not know\nwhat he did five minutes ago or ten minutes ago, He may be in a blackout already\nfor those. But for what he just did and what he is going to do next, he is not in any\nblackout at all. He is right there . . . in the moment doing as he pleases.‖\n     At about this point, the prosecutor asked Dr. Dietz the two questions\ndefendant challenges on appeal. He first asked, ―[A]ssuming that the defendant\nlater suffered a blackout of these murders and as you mentioned that doesn‘t affect\nhim knowing what he is doing, an example of that would be . . . in the Maui\nhomicide, that there was a comforter placed up over the window that — so\nwhether he ever suffered a blackout or not, clearly at that moment he knows what\nhe is doing is wrong. He is trying to hide it from the outside world, correct?‖ The\ncourt overruled defense counsel‘s objection that the question called for speculation\nand lacked foundation. Dr. Dietz replied, ―Yes, that is correct.‖\n     The prosecutor then asked, ―Was there evidence that actually indicated to\nyou that this defendant did not suffer [a] blackout?‖ Dr. Dietz answered, ―Yes,‖\nand the prosecutor asked, ―[C]ould you tell us what that is?‖ Defense counsel\nobjected that the question was ―outside the scope.‖ At sidebar, the prosecutor\nexplained that he sought to elicit testimony apparently about the circumstance that\ndefendant was not in possession of any jewelry nor did he have any blood on him\n\n                                          134\n\fwhen he woke up the morning after the Deeble murder. The court ruled that the\ninquiry was ―highly speculative‖ because defendant could have disposed of these\nitems at or immediately after the murder and ―still have no memory of them,‖ and\ntherefore the inquiry sought information precluded by its earlier order.\n     Defendant contends that the prosecutor violated the court‘s order when he\nasked whether there was evidence defendant knew what he was doing when he\nplaced the comforter over the window. Defendant did not object on the ground\nthat the question sought information precluded by the court‘s order, and that claim\nis therefore forfeited on appeal. (See Schmeck, supra, 37 Cal.4th at p. 286.)\nMoreover, the question was simply a continuation of a line of questioning\nregarding a set of assumed facts that was proper under the court‘s ruling.\n     Defendant further contends that the prosecutor violated the court‘s order\nwhen he asked Dr. Dietz whether there was ―evidence that actually indicated to\nyou that this defendant did not suffer [a] blackout?‖ Contrary to defendant‘s\nassertion, Dr. Dietz did not opine that defendant did not suffer a blackout. Rather,\nhe testified that there was evidence to that effect, but never delineated what that\nevidence was or its relative strength. In any event, the court‘s order did not\npreclude opinion testimony that defendant was not in a blackout. Rather, it\nprecluded Dr. Dietz from testifying regarding ―reacquired memory‖ and how such\na phenomenon would demonstrate defendant did not experience a blackout. No\nmisconduct is apparent.\n     Defendant further contends that the prosecutor ―made extensive use of\nDr. Dietz‘s impermissible testimony during his closing argument.‖ We have\nconcluded the testimony was not impermissible. To the extent defendant also\nchallenges the prosecutor‘s argument that defendant‘s assertion he did not\nremember the crimes should not be credited, such argument was fair comment on\nthe state of the evidence and fell well ―within the bounds of the ‗wide latitude‘\n\n                                         135\n\fgiven to prosecutors during closing argument‖ at the penalty phase. (People v.\nWelch (1999) 20 Cal.4th 701, 763; see Schmeck, supra, 37 Cal.4th at p. 298 [no\nmisconduct in referring to defendant as a ― ‘dope dealing lying rat‘ ‖]; People v.\nEdelbacher (1989) 47 Cal.3d 983, 1030 [the prosecutor‘s argument that defendant\nwas a ― ‗snake in the jungle,‘ ‖ ― ‗slick,‘ ‖ ― ‗tricky,‘ ‖ a ― ‗pathological liar,‘ ‖ and\n― ‗one of the greatest liars in the history of Fresno County‘ ‖ was not\nmisconduct].)\n\n                 b. Claim prosecutor stated he had undisclosed knowledge of\n                    defendant’s guilt\n     Defendant contends the prosecutor committed misconduct when he explicitly\ntold the second penalty phase jury he had undisclosed knowledge of defendant‘s\nguilt. Not so.\n     In the challenged comment, the prosecutor said during his opening statement:\n―[T]here is not evidence at the [Deeble] crime scene that indicated the killer. The\npolice knew who the defendant was. They knew that he had dated the victim‘s\ndaughter, but at that point in time nothing linked him to the case. And I am telling\nyou this for a couple of reasons. Number one, I am not going to retry, as I\nmentioned to you folks early on, I am not going to retry the guilt phase of this\ncase. And you have accepted that he has been proven guilty. I am not going to\nbring in every bit of evidence. But I don‘t want to mislead you either, and I won‘t\ndo that. So although I am not bringing in all the evidence, I am not going to tell\nyou that there was something there that wasn‘t or leave you with that inference. I\ndon‘t want you to infer that either because all these years I mentioned to you that\ncase was unsolved.‖\n     Defendant did not object to this portion of the prosecutor‘s opening\nstatement, no exception to the general requirement of an objection is applicable,\nand his claim is therefore forfeited on appeal. (Schmeck, supra, 37 Cal.4th at\n\n\n                                           136\n\fp. 286.) The claim is also meritless. Nothing in the challenged comment indicates\nany ―undisclosed‖ knowledge of guilt. The prosecutor simply asserted that the\njury should not infer holes in the guilt phase evidence just because the prosecutor\nwas not presenting all of the guilt phase evidence, and that no physical evidence\ntied defendant to the crime scene. Moreover, the issue of defendant‘s guilt for the\ncapital crime was not before the jury.\n\n                c. Claim the prosecutor told the jury that Hawaii did not have the\n                   death penalty\n     During cross-examination of Jimmy Ekstrom, the prosecutor established that\nEkstrom had served only about six months in jail in Hawaii for vehicular\nmanslaughter. The prosecutor then asked Ekstrom, ―There‘s no death penalty in\nHawaii, is there?‖ The court sustained defense counsel‘s relevance objection.\nContrary to defendant‘s assertion, the prosecutor did not tell the jury that Hawaii\ndid not have a death penalty statute. The jury was instructed that statements by the\nattorneys during the trial were not evidence, and that ―[i]f an objection was\nsustained to a question, do not guess what the answer might have been.‖ We\npresume it followed these instructions. (Dement, supra, 53 Cal.4th at p. 36.)\n\n                d. Additional asserted misconduct during closing argument\n     Defendant asserts that the prosecutor made impermissibly inflammatory\nremarks during closing argument. Defendant did not object to these portions of\nthe prosecutor‘s argument, no exception to the general requirement of an objection\nis applicable, and his claim is therefore forfeited on appeal. (Schmeck, supra, 37\nCal.4th at p. 286.)\n     Moreover, ―[t]here is a wide range of permissible argument at the penalty\nphase. [Citation.] Argument may include opprobrious epithets warranted by the\nevidence. [Citation.] Where they are so supported, we have condoned a wide\nrange of epithets to describe the egregious nature of the defendant‘s conduct.\n\n\n                                         137\n\f(E.g., [People v.] Farnam [(2002)] 28 Cal.4th 107, 168 [defendant is ‗monstrous,‘\n‗cold-blooded,‘ vicious, and a ‗predator‘; evidence is ‗horrifying‘ and ‗ ―more\nhorrifying than your worst nightmare‖ ‘]; People v. Thomas (1992) 2 Cal.4th 489,\n537 [defendant is ‗ ―mass murderer, rapist,‖ ‘ ‗ ―perverted murderous cancer,‖ ‘\nand ‗ ―walking depraved cancer‖ ‘]; [People v.] Sully [1991] 53 Cal.3d 1195, 1249\n[based on facts of crime, defendant is ‗ ―human monster‖ ‘ and ‗mutation‘].)‖\n(People v. Zambrano (2007) 41 Cal.4th 1082, 1172.)\n     Here, the prosecutor‘s challenged comments such as calling defendant a\n―monster‖ and an ―animal,‖ asserting that Delbecq was ―vulnerable and weak,‖\n―couldn‘t fight back,‖ ―couldn‘t plead properly for mercy,‖ ―did nothing to\ndeserve what happened to her,‖ experienced a ―cat and mouse game‖ during a\n―night of terror‖ and ―unimaginable terror‖ when she was assaulted with the\nmousse can, and asking the jury to imagine her terror, and his assertions that\nDeeble was not ―given a penalty phase‖ or ―allowed to present mitigating\nevidence,‖ was shown ―no sympathy,‖ but was ―brutally raped and murdered‖ and\nleft lying there ―like so much garbage,‖ were warranted by the evidence and fell\nwell within permissible bounds.\n     Defendant further asserts that the prosecutor committed misconduct when he\nurged the jury to consider defendant‘s future dangerousness based on his\npossession of a shank in jail. This argument was based on evidence of defendant‘s\nconduct and therefore proper. (People v. Ervin (2000) 22 Cal.4th 48, 99.)\n\n           8. Asserted instructional error\n\n               a. Lingering doubt instruction\n     Defendant contends the trial court erred in refusing to give a lingering doubt\ninstruction. There is no federal or state right to such an instruction. (People v.\nThomas (2012) 53 Cal.4th 771, 826; People v. Hartsch (2010) 49 Cal.4th 472,\n\n\n\n                                         138\n\f513.) Rather, we have held that ―the standard instructions on capital sentencing\nfactors, together with counsel‘s closing argument, are sufficient to convey the\nlingering doubt concept to the jury.‖ (Hartsch, at p. 513; see Thomas, at p. 826.)\nDefendant cites no persuasive reason to revisit this conclusion.\n\n                b. Circumstantial evidence instruction\n     Defendant requested, and the court gave, instruction in the modified language\nof CALJIC No. 2.02, which addresses the sufficiency of circumstantial evidence to\nprove a defendant‘s specific intent or mental state. Defendant did not request and\nthe jury was not instructed in the language of CALJIC No. 2.01, which generally\naddresses the sufficiency of circumstantial evidence to prove a defendant‘s guilt of\na crime. Defendant here contends the trial court erred in failing to so instruct the\njury sua sponte. Not so.\n     ―CALJIC No. 2.01 is required only where the prosecution substantially relies\non circumstantial evidence. ‗[W]here circumstantial inference is not the primary\nmeans by which the prosecution seeks to establish that the defendant engaged in\ncriminal conduct, the instruction may confuse and mislead, and thus should not be\ngiven.‘ ‖ (People v. Brown (2003) 31 Cal.4th 518, 563.) Here, at the penalty\nphase, neither the sexual assault of N.T., nor the observation of defendant with a\nshank in jail, relied on circumstantial evidence.\n     To the extent defendant claims the trial court should have instructed in the\nlanguage of CALJIC No. 2.01 because counsel argued a lingering doubt theory\nwith regard to the murder of Deeble, for which the evidence was circumstantial,\nthat assertion is also meritless. Because there is no federal or state right to an\ninstruction on lingering doubt (see ante, at pt. II.C.8.a.), there is similarly no\nfederal or state right to an instruction on circumstantial guilt phase evidence in aid\nof a penalty phase lingering doubt argument.\n\n\n\n                                          139\n\f                c. Instruction that certain factors are only mitigating\n     Defendant contends that the trial court erred when it refused to instruct that\nsection 190.3, factors (d), (h), and (k) could only be considered as evidence in\nmitigation.23 ― ‗The trial court did not commit constitutional error by failing to\ninstruct that statutory mitigating factors were relevant only in mitigation.\n[Citations.] Moreover, ―the statutory instruction to the jury to consider ‗whether\nor not‘ certain mitigating factors were present did not impermissibly invite the jury\nto aggravate the sentence upon the basis of nonexistent or irrational aggravating\nfactors. [Citations.]‖ ‘ ‖ (People v. Parson (2008) 44 Cal.4th 332, 369.) In\naddition, here the court instructed the jury that ―all evidence related to [section\n190.3,] factors (d), (h), and (k) cannot be considered as aggravating\ncircumstances.‖ It further instructed that, ―[i]n considering factors in mitigation,\nyou may consider but are not limited to any of the following which you find to\nhave been established by the evidence: Whether the defendant suffered extreme\nchild abuse[,] [w]hether the defendant has displayed any acts of kindness or\nperformed any good deeds on behalf of others[,] [w]hether the defendant shares\nany love and concern for his family and others[, and] [w]hether the defendant\nbehaved well while incarcerated in the past.‖\n\n           9. Asserted cumulative error\n     Defendant contends that cumulative guilt and penalty phase error requires\nreversal. We have found no error, and where we assumed error, we have found no\nprejudice. Nor do we discern cumulative prejudice.\n\n\n\n\n23 The court did not instruct on section 190.3, factors (e), (f), (g), and (j) because\nthey were deemed inapplicable.\n\n\n                                         140\n\f           10. Constitutionality of California’s death penalty statute\n     Defendant contends that California‘s death penalty statute is constitutionally\ninvalid in numerous respects. We have repeatedly rejected similar claims, and\nshould do so again here.\n     ―[T]he California death penalty statute is not impermissibly broad, whether\nconsidered on its face or as interpreted by this court.‖ (Dykes, supra, 46 Cal.4th at\np. 813.) We further ―reject the claim that section 190.3, factor (a), on its face or as\ninterpreted and applied, permits arbitrary and capricious imposition of a sentence\nof death.‖ (Ibid.; see Tuilaepa v. California (1994) 512 U.S. 967, 975-976, 978.)\n     Contrary to defendant‘s assertion, the death penalty statute does not lack\nsafeguards to avoid arbitrary and capricious sentencing, deprive defendant of the\nright to a jury trial, or constitute cruel and unusual punishment because it does not\nrequire unanimity as to the truth of aggravating circumstances, or findings beyond\na reasonable doubt that an aggravating circumstance (other than § 190.3, factors\n(b) or (c) evidence) has been proved, that the aggravating factors outweighed the\nmitigating factors, or that death is the appropriate sentence. (People v. Whalen\n(2013) 56 Cal.4th 1, 90; Dykes, supra, 46 Cal.4th at p. 814; Avila, supra, 46\nCal.4th at p. 724.) ―Nothing in Cunningham v. California (2007) 549 U.S. 270,\nBlakely v.

New Jersey (2000) 530 U.S. 466, affects our conclusions in this\nregard.‖ (Dement, supra, 53 Cal.4th at p. 55.) ―Written findings by the jury\nduring the penalty phase are not constitutionally required, and their absence does\nnot deprive defendant of meaningful appellate review.‖ (People v. Mendoza\n(2011) 52 Cal.4th 1056, 1097.) The jury may properly consider a defendant‘s\nunadjudicated criminal activity. (People v. Martinez (2010) 47 Cal.4th 911, 968.)\n“Use of the adjectives ‗extreme‘ and ‗substantial‘ in section 190.3, factors (d) and\n(g) is constitutional.‖ (Dement, at p. 57.)\n\n\n                                         141\n\f     ―The failure to require intercase proportionality does not guarantee ‗arbitrary,\ndiscriminatory, or disproportionate impositions of the death penalty.‘ ‖ (People v.\nStevens (2007) 41 Cal.4th 182, 212; see Pulley v. Harris (1984) 465 U.S. 37, 50-\n51.) Moreover, ―capital and noncapital defendants are not similarly situated and\ntherefore may be treated differently without violating constitutional guarantees of\nequal protection of the laws,‖ due process of law, or the cruel and unusual\npunishment clause. (People v. Manriquez (2005) 37 Cal.4th 547, 590; see\nDement, supra, 53 Cal.4th at pp. 55-56, 58.)\n     Defendant contends that his death sentence violates international law and\ntherefore his rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the federal\nConstitution. Defendant points to no authority that ―prohibit[s] a sentence of\ndeath rendered in accordance with state and federal constitutional and statutory\nrequirements.‖ (People v.

J.\nKENNARD, J.\nWERDEGAR, J.\nCHIN, J.\n\n\n\n\n                                 143\n\f     CONCURRING AND DISSENTING OPINION OF CORRIGAN, J.\n\n\n\n       In People v. Dungo (2012) 55 Cal.4th 608 (Dungo), a majority of this court\nheld that a pathologist giving an opinion about a victim‘s cause of death may\nrecount ―objective facts‖ that he did not observe, derived from an autopsy report\nhe did not write, without running afoul of the confrontation clause. (Dungo, at p.\n621.) This case demonstrates why the Dungo rule is unworkable.\n       In Dungo, as here, a witness described findings made by a nontestifying\npathologist. Both the majority and Justice Werdegar‘s concurring opinion in\nDungo emphasized that the statements attributable to the absent pathologist were\nlimited to ―anatomical and physiological observations‖ of the victim‘s body at the\nautopsy. (Dungo, supra, 55 Cal.4th at p. 619; id. at p. 621 (conc. opn. of\nWerdegar, J.).) Justice Werdegar suggested, ―[t]he process of systematically\nexamining the decedent‘s body and recording the resulting observations is . . .\ngoverned primarily by medical standards rather than by legal requirements of\nformality or solemnity‖ and that such observations do not ―resemble the ex parte\nexaminations of historical example or the structured police interrogations of\nCrawford [v. Washington (2004) 541 U.S. 36] and Davis [v. Washington (2006)\n547 U.S. 813].‖ (Dungo, at p. 624 (conc. opn. of Werdegar, J.).) The suggestion\nis that the recordation of medical observations is purely objective and mechanical.\nMy colleagues contrast them with medical conclusions, which result from\napplying a pathologist‘s expertise to a set of objective facts, in order to draw\n\n\n                                          1\n\fparticular conclusions. There is no debate that admission of testimony as to\nmedical conclusions reached by a nontestifying expert would violate the\nconfrontation clause. The Dungo majority and concurrences concluded, however,\nthat hearsay statements about medical observations may be admissible.\n       The line between an inadmissible statement amounting to a conclusion, and\nan admissible statement about an observation, is not as bright as Dungo suggests.\nThis case further blurs that distinction. As examples, Dr. Fukumoto testified\nregarding the following statements Dr. Richards made in his report. The victim\n(a) had suffered an incisional tear in her left eardrum, suggesting it had been\ncaused by a sharp instrument; (b) had ankle lacerations ―going in an upward\ndirection,‖ suggesting it was caused by a ligature; (c) had a ―crescent‖ on the\nbridge of her nose consistent with a fracture, even though Richards saw no\nindication of a fracture on an x-ray; and (d) had residue near her mouth consistent\nwith adhesive tape.\n       The defense contested all of these statements. Its expert, Dr. Wolf, testified\nthe victim‘s eardrums could have been torn from increased pressure during\nstrangulation, rather than incised by an instrument. Wolf concluded one could not\ndetermine whether a tear was ―incisional‖ without a microscopic examination,\nwhich Dr. Richards did not perform. Defense counsel argued that defendant could\nnot have had the intent to torture because he immediately rendered the victim\nunconscious by delivering a blow hard enough to break her nose. This scenario\nwas inconsistent with defendant binding the victim‘s ankles. Regarding the nose\ninjury, Dr. Fukumoto testified that Richards did not see a fracture on the X-ray.\nYet, Fukumoto testified he saw one, thus augmenting Richards‘s credibility.\nRichards had failed to obtain microscopic slides of the area or to make an incision\nthat might have confirmed a break. Finally, the defense noted that Richards never\ntested the substance on the victim‘s face to confirm the presence of an adhesive.\n\n                                          2\n\f       Even if some of Richards‘s statements can be accurately described as mere\nobservations, the underlined portions are clearly opinions or conclusions drawn\nfrom observations. The extensive testimony1 and argument2 regarding the\n\n1       At the guilt phase, the prosecutor began his questioning of Dr. Fukumoto\nregarding the autopsy by stating, ―I would like to go through with you some of Dr.\nRichards[‘s] specific findings, and I wanted to ask you some questions as well.‖\nThe prosecutor then repeatedly asked Fukumoto about Richards’s findings and\nconclusions. For example, Fukumoto testified that the victim had ―a break on the\nleft ear drum which was described by Dr. Richards as incisional in type. . . . It is\nnot a tear. It is something that is caused by a sharp instrument or an instrument\nthat has a point.‖ When asked how Richards described the victim‘s ankle\nlacerations, Fukumoto answered, ―He described them as being caused by the wires\nprobably coming together and inflicting the injury.‖ As to the victim‘s nose,\nFukumoto testified that ―[t]here was a crescent, in other words, in the area of the\nbridge of the nose, which was consistent to him [i.e., Richards] as fracturing of the\nbridge of the nose.‖ Fukumoto described Richards‘s findings as to the genital\nregion, noting ―the area of the vagina shows bruises primarily on the labia and also\nthe vaginal vault‖ and ―[t]here was hemorrhage as well as a laceration in the area\nof the posterior fourchette.‖ Fukumoto also recounted that Richards found\n―mucosal lacerations of the rectum‖ and that the anus was dilated, though\nRichards ―did not measure it.‖\n        On cross-examination, Dr. Fukumoto confirmed that Dr. Richards did not\nsee in an X-ray that the victim‘s nose was broken. Defense counsel inquired how\nFukumoto would have performed the autopsy differently from Richards, eliciting\nthat Fukumoto would have taken more measurements, produced more slide\nsamples, and made an incision in the victim‘s nose to confirm a break. Defense\ncounsel asked about a notation by Richards on one slide reflecting his finding of\nan ― ‗underlying submucosal hemorrhage‘ ‖ in the victim‘s vagina. Defense\ncounsel elicited that Richards made no notation regarding blood in the vagina or\nrectum, or damage to the victim‘s breasts. Defense counsel also sought\nclarification regarding Richards‘s findings as to the tear of the victim‘s eardrum\nand injuries to her vagina.\n        On redirect examination, the prosecutor sought to clarify that ―Dr. Richards\nin his summary doesn‘t say that there is maybe a fractured nose. He says there is a\nfractured nose; is that correct?‖ Dr. Fukumoto agreed. Fukumoto also agreed that\nRichards‘s report ―noted an area extending from the mouth over to the lower left\ncheek that appeared as a residual of adhesive tape.‖\n2       The prosecutor expressly relied upon Dr. Richards‘s credibility throughout\njury argument. For example, the prosecutor belittled the opinion of defense expert\n\n\n                                         3\n\fcredibility of the absent Richards shows how an application of Dungo can run\nafoul of the core purpose behind the confrontation clause. ― ‗The main and\nessential purpose of confrontation is to secure for the opponent the opportunity of\ncross-examination.‘ ‖ (Davis v. Alaska (1974) 415 U.S. 308, 315-316.) ―Cross-\nexamination is the principal means by which the believability of a witness and the\ntruth of his testimony are tested.‖ (Id. at p. 316.)\n        In Crawford v. Washington, supra, 541 U.S. 36, the Supreme Court\noverruled Ohio v. Roberts (1980) 448 U.S. 56. Under the Roberts rule, hearsay\ncould be admitted if it bore ―adequate ‗indicia of reliability.‘ Reliability can be\ninferred without more in a case where the evidence falls within a firmly rooted\nhearsay exception. In other cases, the evidence must be excluded, at least absent a\nshowing of particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.‖ (Id. at p. 66.) The\nCrawford majority stated, ―we do not think the Framers meant to leave the Sixth\nAmendment‘s protection to the vagaries of the rules of evidence, much less to\namorphous notions of ‗reliability.‘ ‖ (Crawford, supra, 541 U.S. at p. 61.)\n\n\n\n(footnote continued from previous page)\nDr. Wolf regarding the victim‘s vaginal injuries. The prosecutor stated Wolf was\n―quoting literature‖ in forming his opinions and did not ―hav[e] any experience.‖\nThe prosecutor noted that ―it came out very clearly that he is not a sheriff-coroner,\nnot working for the coroner‘s office,‖ and argued that ―[h]e hasn‘t seen what Dr.\nFukumoto had seen or what Dr. Richards had seen before he retired.‖ Similarly,\nwith respect to Wolf‘s opinion that it could not be determined whether the victim\nsuffered an incision to the eardrum, the prosecutor argued: ―Well, the autopsy\nsurgeon who did the autopsy, who is experienced in violent death autopsies says it\nis not. He talks about other injuries to the ears being tearing. He differentiates\nbetween the two. But he said the one injury was from a sharp instrument.‖ In\naddressing Wolf‘s assertion that the victim‘s vaginal injuries could not have been\nvisible to the eye, the prosecutor argued: ―When asked then what about the\ninjuries that were visible to Dr. Richards‘ eyes? Well, there weren‘t any of those.\nDr. Richards is wrong. That is the best [the defense] can do on this.‖\n\n\n                                           4\n\f―Reliability is an amorphous, if not entirely subjective, concept. There are\ncountless factors bearing on whether a statement is reliable . . . . Whether a\nstatement is deemed reliable depends heavily on which factors the judge considers\nand how much weight he accords each of them.‖ (Id. at p. 63.)\n       The majority here and in Dungo appear to return to a Roberts-like rule in\nwhich an ―objective‖ observation is sufficiently reliable to avoid the requirement\nof confrontation. The majority here similarly rejects defendant‘s claim that Dr.\nFukumoto improperly recounted Dr. Richards‘s opinions about the ―incisional‖\ntear in the eardrum, the fractured nose, and the presence of adhesive tape residue\non the victim‘s face. The majority reasons: ―This testimony by Dr. Fukumoto did\nnot, however, recount Dr. Richards‘ opinions, but rather [Richards‘s] objective\nmedical observations.‖ (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 55.) The majority does not explain\nthe difference between ―objective medical observations‖ and ―opinions.‖ To do so\nundermines the analysis. That some substance is present on the face may be an\nobservation. That it is adhesive residue is a conclusion. That the eardrum is\nruptured may be an observation. That the wound was caused by a sharp\ninstrument is an opinion based on interpretation.\n       In light of Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts (2009) 557 U.S. 305,\nBullcoming v. New Mexico (2011) 564 U.S. __ [131 S.Ct. 2705], and Williams v.\nIllinois (2012) __ U.S. __ [132 S.Ct. 2221], it is by no means clear that the\nmajority‘s distinction between observations and conclusions would survive\nconstitutional scrutiny. (See Bullcoming, supra, 564 U.S. at p. __ [131 S.Ct. at p.\n2715 [―the comparative reliability of an analyst‘s testimonial report drawn from\nmachine-produced data does not overcome the Sixth Amendment bar‖]; Melendez-\nDiaz, supra, 557 U.S. at p. 318 [―Nor is it evident that what respondent calls\n‗neutral scientific testing‘ is as neutral or as reliable as respondent suggests.\nForensic evidence is not uniquely immune from the risk of manipulation.‖];\n\n                                           5\n\fDungo, supra, 55 Cal.4th at pp. 639-640 (dis. opn. of Corrigan, J.).) But even if\nthe distinction is permitted, Dr. Fukumoto repeatedly testified to Dr. Richards‘s\nhearsay statements recounting his observations. Defendant had the right to cross-\nexamine Richards on the methods and reasoning he used. It is ultimately the\njury‘s role to evaluate the credibility of the person who drew the conclusions and\ndecide for itself whether to accept them. (See Commonwealth v. Rivera (Mass.\n2013) 981 N.E.2d 171, 189 [decided after Dungo; ― ‗[A] testifying medical\nexaminer called by the Commonwealth is not permitted to testify, on direct\nexamination, to the underlying factual findings contained in the autopsy report\nprepared by a different medical examiner, because such testimony would violate a\ndefendant‘s confrontation rights.‘ [Citations.]‖].)\n       In a decision after Dungo, the New Mexico Supreme Court recently\nreached a similar conclusion: ―[I]n material respects, the autopsy findings do not\ninvolve objective markers that any third party can examine in order to express an\nindependent opinion as to the existence or non-existence of soot or stippling. Such\nobservations are not based on any scientific technique that produces raw data, but\ndepend entirely on the subjective interpretation of the observer, who in this case\nwas [the nontestifying] Dr. Dudley. How Dr. Dudley reached the conclusion that\nthere was no evidence of soot or stippling on Reynaldo‘s body or clothing should\nhave been the subject of cross-examination. Inquiry into her training, the\nequipment used to arrive at her subjective conclusion, whether the evidence of\nsoot or stippling might have been masked by blood, or any other variables that\nwould influence her decision should have been tested in the crucible of cross-\nexamination.‖ (State v. Navarette (N.M. 2013) 294 P.3d 435, 443.) Likewise,\nU.S. v. Ignasiak (11th Cir. 2012) 667 F.3d 1217, reasoned: ―Medical examiners\nare not mere scriveners reporting machine generated raw-data. . . . [T]he\nobservational data and conclusions contained in the autopsy reports are the\n\n                                          6\n\fproduct of the skill, methodology, and judgment of the highly trained examiners\nwho actually performed the autopsy.‖ (Id. at p. 1232, fn. omitted.) Similarly, Dr.\nRichards‘s conclusions here depended on his skill and interpretation of what he\nsaw.\n       The majority acknowledges that Dr. Fukumoto recounted some of Dr.\nRichards‘s opinions, including that the victim was strangled to death and that her\nankle lacerations were caused by a wire ligature. However, the majority concludes\n―no prejudice was possible under any standard‖ because ―Dr. Fukumoto\nindependently agreed with Dr. Richards‘s opinions, and neither the cause of death\nnor the source of the lacerations on Deeble‘s ankle was in dispute at trial.‖ (Maj.\nopn., ante, at p. 55.) Such reasoning misses the mark. That Fukumoto reviewed\nmicroscopic slides and autopsy photographs in addition to Richards’s autopsy\nreport hardly establishes that Fukumoto derived his opinions ―independently‖ of\nRichards. As the West Virginia Supreme Court reasoned under similar\ncircumstances: ―[T]o the extent that Dr. Sabet served as a ‗transmitter‘ for Dr.\nLivingston‘s opinions regarding cause of death by reading or reiterating the\nconclusions contained from the report, such testimony is precisely the type of\n‗surrogate‘ testimony that is violative of the Confrontation Clause per Bullcoming.\nDr. Sabet‘s seeming concurrence with the cause of death, does not transform it\ninto his own opinion, capable of cross-examination sufficient for Confrontation\nClause purposes.‖ (State v. Kennedy (W.Va. 2012) 735 S.E.2d 905, 920-921.)\nPhotos and X-rays are not hearsay. (See Evid. Code, §§ 225 [defining\n―statement‖]; 1200 [defining ―hearsay evidence‖].) Fukumoto could have\nexamined photos and X-rays and given his own opinion about their significance.\nWhat he could not do is tell the jury what the absent Richards concluded.\nFukumoto‘s testimony that his opinions were ―consistent‖ with Richards‘s served\nto bolster his own credibility based on hearsay not subject to cross-examination.\n\n                                         7\n\f       For the reasons set out in my Dungo dissent, Dr. Fukumoto‘s testimony\nviolated the confrontation clause because he relayed to the jury the observations\nand conclusions of the nontestifying autopsy pathologist. Dr. Richards‘s\nstatements were recorded in a six-page autopsy record and a two-page histology\nreport. Each page of both documents bears the letterhead of the Orange County\nSheriff‘s Department, and names Brad Gates as the sheriff-coroner. Each page\nbears the victim‘s name, the case number, and Richards‘s signature. The autopsy\nwas attended by a criminalist employed by the Orange County Sheriff-Coroner, as\nwell as two members each from the Orange County Sheriff‘s Department and the\nLos Angeles Police Department. These documents and the circumstances under\nwhich they were created indicate they were sufficiently formal and made with the\nprimary purpose of establishing facts for possible use in a criminal trial.\nAccordingly, they are testimonial hearsay. (Dungo, supra, 55 Cal.4th at pp. 634-\n646 (dis. opn. of Corrigan, J.).)\n       Dr. Fukumoto‘s testimony was prejudicial with respect to the torture-\nmurder special circumstance. ― ‗Confrontation clause violations are subject to\nfederal harmless-error analysis under Chapman v. California (1967) 386 U.S. 18,\n24.‘ ‖ (People v. Loy (2011) 52 Cal.4th 46, 69.) ― ‗The beyond-a-reasonable-\ndoubt standard of Chapman ―requir[es] the beneficiary of a [federal] constitutional\nerror to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not\ncontribute to the verdict obtained.‖ [Citation.] ―To say that an error did not\ncontribute to the ensuing verdict is . . . to find that error unimportant in relation to\neverything else the jury considered on the issue in question, as revealed in the\nrecord.‖ (Yates v.

That is\nto say, the issue is ―whether the . . . verdict actually rendered in this trial was\n\n\n\n                                            8\n\fsurely unattributable to the error.‖ (Sullivan v. Louisiana (1993) 508 U.S. 275,\n279.)‘ [Citation.]‖ (People v. Pearson (2013) 56 Cal.4th 393, 463.)\n       We cannot determine on this record whether the nonhearsay autopsy\nphotographs and the microscopic slides ―would have independently supported [Dr.\nFukumoto‘s] testimony.‖ (Dungo, supra, 55 Cal.4th at p. 647 (dis. opn. of\nCorrigan, J.).) Nor did Fukumoto so limit his testimony. ―To prove a torture-\nmurder special circumstance, the prosecution must show that defendant intended\nto kill and had a torturous intent, i.e., an intent to cause extreme pain or suffering\nfor the purpose of revenge, extortion, persuasion, or another sadistic purpose.‖\n(People v. Streeter (2012) 54 Cal.4th 205, 237.) The prosecutor argued that\ndefendant achieved sexual pleasure from his victim‘s suffering, while the defense\nvigorously urged that defendant did not intend to torture. According to the\nprosecution, the victim‘s injuries reflected that she suffered extreme pain,\nincluding the ―incisional‖ tear to her eardrum, the deep furrows in her neck caused\nby struggling against the ligature, and bruising deep within the body cavity. The\ndefense urged that the evidence reflected the victim was struck in the face and\nrendered unconscious shortly after strangulation. The defense argued a person\nintending to torture would not immediately render his victim unconscious and\nimpervious to pain. The condition of the victim‘s body was critical evidence.\nFukumoto repeatedly recounted Dr. Richards‘s statements. As a result, deciding\nbetween the prosecution and defense theories depended in great measure on the\ncredibility and accuracy of Richards‘s reports.\n       However, the error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt in all other\nrespects. The defense did not contest that the victim had been strangled, instead\narguing defendant was not the killer or, alternatively, that he did not act with an\nintent to torture. Ample evidence aside from Dr. Fukumoto‘s testimony supported\nboth first degree felony murder based upon burglary and the burglary-murder\n\n                                           9\n\fspecial circumstance. The jury could have found burglary based upon an entry\nwith intent to steal or to commit sexual assault. Deeble‘s daughter identified\njewelry missing after Deeble‘s death, supporting an inference that defendant, who\nknew Deeble and had been in her home, entered the house with intent to steal.\nDeeble‘s body was found without underwear, with her legs spread apart, and her\nnightgown pushed above her waist. A mousse can was found nearby with\napparent blood on it, and a substance found on Deeble‘s leg could have been dried\nsemen. These circumstances suggest a sexual assault. Further, defendant‘s\nundisputed commission of a similar murder in Hawaii strongly supported a finding\nthat defendant entered Deeble‘s home with a similar intent.\n       In sum, this case illustrates the difficulty of applying Dungo‘s rule allowing\nadmission of testimony regarding ―objective facts‖ derived from an autopsy report\nby a pathologist who does not testify. The distinction between an admissible\nstatement of objective ―fact‖ and an inadmissible medical ―conclusion‖ is too\namorphous to be workable. Application of the confrontation clause should not\ndepend upon a court‘s judgment about which side of that blurry line a statement\nfalls. For the foregoing reasons, I would reverse the torture-murder special\ncircumstance and affirm the convictions in all other respects.\n                                                 CORRIGAN, J.\nI CONCUR:\nLIU, J.\n\n\n\n\n                                         10\n\fSee next page for addresses and telephone numbers for counsel who argued in Supreme Court.\n\nName of Opinion People v.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n      A. Guilt Phase\n\n            1. Prosecution Evidence\n\n                  a. Murder of Marjorie Deeble\n\n                     1) The crime scene and condition of the victim’s body\n     In the late afternoon of Thursday, May 15, 1986, Marjorie Deeble was found\ndead in her single story apartment on Green Street in Los Alamitos, California.\nThe front screen door was closed but unlocked, and the wooden front door was\nopen approximately four inches. There was no sign of forced entry. The screen\nfrom a window next to the door had been removed, and was leaning against the\nbuilding.\n     Inside the home, loud music was playing in the southeast bedroom. Deeble\nwas discovered in this bedroom. She was lying face-down on the floor between\nthe bed and a dresser. She was wearing a long nightgown that had been pushed up\naround her waist and no panties. The bottom of the nightgown had been either cut\nor ripped. Her hands were tied behind her back with material from the nightgown,\nand with torn telephone cord.\n     Deeble‘s neck was in a noose made from a thin belt. The end of the belt was\ntied to the top drawer handle of the dresser, so that her neck was suspended about\neight inches above the floor. The drawer was open about six to eight inches.\nBlood had run out of her left ear and mouth, and there was blood around her nose.\nThere were two wounds on her neck, one underneath the belt and one just below.\nHer left leg was bent and leaning against the bed. Her right leg was fully extended\nand underneath the bed. Inside Deeble‘s thigh was a stain that could have been\ndried semen. She was barefoot, and her ankles bore marks that might have been\nligature marks.\n\n\n                                         2\n\f     A cylindrical mousse can was found in a bed covering on top of the bed. A\nsubstance underneath the ridge around the top of the can appeared to be blood, and\ngave a positive response to a presumptive test for blood. A cap found on the\nground next to Deeble appeared to be one that could fit the mousse can. A\nsubstance that appeared to be blood was observed just inside the opening of the\ncap ―in a position that if the cap had been placed upon the mousse can, it might\nhave transferred.‖\n     On the floor, a pillowcase, a dress, and a scarf were wrapped together with\nadhesive tape. The dress was bloodstained. The pillowcase was also\nbloodstained. It was tied to resemble a hood, and appeared to have been cut with\npinking shears. More blood was inside the pillowcase than was on the outside.\n     A sheet was found on the floor. A strip approximately 66 inches long and 15\ninches wide had been cut and torn from the left side of the sheet. The irregular\ncutting was possibly made by the use of pinking shears. A telephone cord and an\nelectrical cord were found tied together either on the floor or on the bed.\n     The bedroom had been ransacked. Garments lay in the middle of the room,\nitems were knocked over on the credenza, dresser drawers were open, and the\ncontents of a purse were strewn on the floor. A telephone that appeared to have its\ncord ripped off was against the wall.\n     Dr. Robert Richards, a pathologist, performed Deeble‘s autopsy. Because\nDr. Richards had retired by the time of trial, his partner, Dr. Richard Fukumoto,\ntestified regarding the autopsy findings. In light of defendant‘s appellate claims\nthat this testimony violated his confrontation clause rights (see post, at pt. II.B.2.),\nthat the trial court erred in admitting evidence of the uncharged murder of Muriel\nDelbecq (see post, at pt. II.B.3.), that the evidence is insufficient to support the\nmurder conviction on a theory of torture murder or burglary murder, and that the\nevidence is insufficient to support the jury‘s true findings on the torture-murder\n\n                                           3\n\fand burglary-murder special-circumstance allegations (see post, at pts. II.B.4.,\nII.B.5.), we recount the autopsy findings in detail.\n     Deeble had bruises in her vaginal area, primarily on the labia and vaginal\nvault. There was bruising and tearing just inside the opening to the vagina, and a\ntear and hemorrhaging in the area of the posterior fourchette, or the bottom of the\nopening to the vagina. On one microscopic slide, Dr. Richards had noted an\n―underlying submucosal hemorrhage.‖ Dr. Fukumoto testified that the ―lining of\nthe vaginal wall is called the mucosa, so a submucosa means the area below that\nlining of the surface.‖ A ―submucosal hemorrhage‖ means that ―there is bleeding\nbeneath the surface lining of the mucus membrane.‖ No tissue response was\nnoted, which Dr. Fukumoto said meant that the injury to the vaginal area was\nprobably less than eight hours old. Deeble‘s anus was dilated, and bruising and\nsmall mucosal lacerations were observed just inside the anus. Dr. Fukumoto\nopined that the dilation of the anus could have been caused by a finger, penis, or\nany number of other objects.\n     Dr. Fukumoto agreed with the prosecutor that the vaginal and rectal areas are\n―full of lots of nerve endings,‖ and so trauma to those areas is ―highly painful.‖\nHe opined the injuries were caused by an object that did not have sharp edges, and\nthat exhibit No. 16, the mousse can found in Deeble‘s bed, was consistent with an\nobject that could have caused the injuries. From the microscopic examination,\nDr. Fukumoto opined that the injuries to the vaginal and rectal areas were inflicted\nbefore death.3\n\n3 The prosecutor asked Dr. Fukumoto if ―[f]rom the microscopic examination‖ he\ncould determine whether the injuries to the vaginal and rectal area ―were caused\nbefore or after death,‖ and Dr. Fukumoto replied ―Yes,‖ and subsequently stated\nwithout elaboration his opinion that the injuries occurred before death. The\n―microscopic examination‖ presumably refers to Dr. Fukumoto‘s examination of\n―microscopic slides,‖ which he defined as ―slide preparations of tissues from\n\n\n                                          4\n\f      There was bleeding in the tissues near the tail of Deeble‘s pancreas.\nDr. Fukumoto testified that the pancreas is an organ located deep within the body,\nand it requires a ―tremendous amount of . . . localized‖ blunt force to the area to\ndamage the pancreas. In the stomach area, Dr. Richards had observed food that\nwas virtually untouched by digestion. Dr. Fukumoto opined that such a finding\nwould indicate that Deeble died within an hour after eating.\n      Blood was coming out of Deeble‘s left ear, and there was extensive\nhemorrhaging in the middle ears which extended from the middle ear into the bone\nof the skull. The right ear drum was torn, and the left ear drum had a break that\naccording to the autopsy report was ―incisional.‖ Dr. Fukumoto explained: ―[A]n\nincision to a forensic pathologist . . . . is not a tear. It is something that is caused\nby a sharp instrument or an instrument that has a point.‖ Dr. Fukumoto said that\n―if the ear drums are torn, associated with massive bleeding in the middle ears, this\ncould be due to a massive increase in pressure as a result of the struggle of the\nvictim in his or her attempt to get a breath.‖ Dr. Fukumoto opined that an amount\nof pressure that would tear an ear drum, and the infliction of an incisional injury to\nan ear drum would, in each case, be extremely painful.\n      Dr. Richards‘s most prominent finding from the neck up was ―marked\nengorgement‖ — which occurs when blood vessels are dilated and filled with\nblood — in the neck, upper neck, and face area. Dr. Fukumoto testified that\nstrangling can have this effect, and when there is venous but not carotid\ncompression, the face becomes red and eventually bluish or purplish as well as\n\n\n(footnote continued from previous page)\nvarious organs which the pathologist has taken . . . for pathologists to look at in\ncase somebody has to review the case.‖ In addition, the prosecutor asked Dr.\nFukumoto about the ―microscopic examination that Dr. Richards did as well that\nyou yourself did . . . on the area of the vagina.‖\n\n\n                                            5\n\fengorged.4 The whites of Deeble‘s eyes had conjunctival hemorrhages, or\nbleeding, and there was a marked swelling of the eyelids. There were abraded\nlacerations in the left chin area. There was a crescent in the bridge area of the\nnose that was consistent to Dr. Richards with ―fracturing of the bridge.‖\nDr. Richards palpated Deeble‘s nose and believed that it was broken, but no\nfracture was visible to him on an x-ray. Dr. Fukumoto reviewed x-rays of the nose\nand testified that one showed ―somewhat flattening‖ that ―may reflect fracturing at\nthe bridge of [the] nose.‖ An internal examination revealed numerous pinpoint\nhemorrhages in the scalp and muscle tissue which were evidence of trauma, and\nsubarachnoid hemorrhaging inside the skull. Dr. Fukumoto opined that the\ninjuries above the neck were the result of blunt force trauma, and that Deeble had\nsuffered at least one significant blow to her face. A substance that appeared to be\nthe residue of adhesive tape was observed in an area extending from the mouth\nover to the lower left cheek.\n     An autopsy photograph showed a deep furrow created by the ligature around\nDeeble‘s neck. Dr. Fukumoto opined that features of the furrow indicated that\nthere was an ―abrasive sideways movement‖ either by the victim in an attempt to\nloosen the ligature, or by the perpetrator as he moved the ligature back and forth,\nand that the ligature and struggling against it would be extremely painful.\n     Dr. Fukumoto stated that when one is strangled, it takes five to six minutes\nfor the brain to die, and the individual may lose consciousness well before then; in\nan extreme ligature or manual strangulation, loss of consciousness can occur in\n\n\n\n4  Dr. Fukumoto testified that engorgement differs from swelling, which is when\nthere is fluid outside the blood vessels that makes tissue swell up, and has nothing\nto do with the presence of blood inside the blood vessels. Swelling indicates that\ntrauma has been inflicted, especially if it is associated with hemorrhaging.\n\n\n                                          6\n\fless than a minute. He opined that the cause of death was ―asphyxiation due to\nligature strangulation.‖ This opinion was consistent with that of Dr. Richards.\n\n                    2) Circumstances surrounding the Deeble murder\n     Deeble was a real estate agent, and Rebecca Brown was the manager of the\noffice at which Deeble worked. On Monday May 12, 1986, Deeble mentioned to\nBrown that she was leaving for an appointment scheduled for about 5:00 p.m.\nBrown understood that Deeble never arrived at the appointment, and she never\nsaw Deeble alive again. Deeble did not contact Brown on May 13, 14, or 15,\nwhich was highly unusual because Deeble was a top agent and the most active\nagent in the office. Brown recalled that during this time period the real estate\nmarket was ―[h]ot, hot.‖\n     Kathryn Deeble Valentine, Deeble‘s daughter, testified she met defendant in\nabout March 1986. They began dating shortly thereafter.5 For about two months\nbefore her mother‘s death, Valentine saw defendant every evening, but only\nwitnessed him drinking once, and once saw him inject cocaine. She never saw\nhim passed out or ―blacked out‖ on alcohol or drugs.\n     Valentine saw her mother for the last time on the morning of Monday\nMay 12, 1986, between 7:00 and 7:30 a.m. Valentine called Deeble several times\nbetween Monday and Thursday of that week and left messages on her answering\nmachine, but never spoke with her.\n     In May 1986 Valentine owned a pickup truck to which only she and\ndefendant had keys. In early May 1986, defendant borrowed the truck for the\nweekend, and when the time came to return it, said it was not drivable. Deeble\nbecame upset, and arranged for defendant to take the truck in for repair.\n\n5 At the time she was dating defendant, Deeble‘s daughter shared her last name.\nAt the time of trial, Deeble‘s daughter‘s last name was Valentine.\n\n\n                                          7\n\f     Deeble would at times leave an apartment key out in a drain pipe in front of\nthe apartment. Defendant knew the key was there. Valentine also told defendant\nthat one could access the apartment through a screen window. Defendant had\nbeen inside Deeble‘s home on at least two occasions, once when Valentine\nintroduced defendant to her mother (the only time they met), and once with\nValentine while Deeble was away.\n     When Valentine met defendant, his leg was in a cast. During the week of\nMay 11, 1986, his leg was no longer in a cast, and he could run with a limp, and\n―move fast if he needed to.‖\n     Valentine generally parked her truck in her driveway, positioning the truck so\nthat it was either before or beyond some juniper bushes so that she could avoid\nstanding in the bushes when entering or exiting the vehicle. On the night of\nMay 12, 1986, Valentine parked the truck before the juniper bushes. The\nfollowing morning, she had to stand in the juniper bushes to enter her truck,\nindicating that someone had moved the truck. Valentine had not given defendant\npermission to use the truck the night before.\n     Valentine and defendant continued to date for about a week after Deeble‘s\nbody was discovered. Valentine asked defendant to attend Deeble‘s funeral, but\nhe declined.\n     Valentine identified — by looking at photographs of Deeble while she was\nalive — certain jewelry that Deeble owned but that Valentine never saw again\nafter Deeble‘s death.\n\n               b. Murder of Muriel Delbecq\n     The prosecutor relied on the other crimes evidence of Muriel Delbecq‘s 1993\nmurder to demonstrate the identity, common design or plan, and intent of the killer\nof Marjorie Deeble.\n\n\n\n                                         8\n\f     On the evening of January 25, 1993, Peggy Ventura dropped off her 67-year-\nold mother, Muriel Delbecq, at Delbecq‘s first floor condominium on Kanoe\nStreet in Kihei, Maui, Hawaii. The following morning, about 7:30 a.m., Ventura\nknocked at Delbecq‘s door and received no response. The front door was closed\nand locked, and Ventura used a key to enter. She observed blood on the carpet,\nand the living room telephone was missing. Delbecq‘s bedroom door was closed\nand locked. Ventura ran outside, alerted neighbors to call 911, and entered her\nmother‘s bedroom through a window. There was a comforter over the window,\nmaking the bedroom ―pitch black.‖ The light switch did not work, and Ventura\nopened the bedroom door to let in light.\n     Ventura discovered Delbecq on the bed under a pile of blankets. She was\nlying on her back, completely nude. Responding officers testified that Delbecq‘s\nlegs were spread, and her hands and feet were not bound. Defendant‘s palm prints\nwere found on the wall, and his bloody right footprint was found on a white\nT-shirt. Delbecq‘s bedroom was ransacked, and the carpet appeared soaked with\nblood. Cigarette butts were found on the floor of the bedroom and in the\nbathroom.\n     Ventura testified that Delbecq always wore her wedding ring. Maui County\nPolice Lieutenant Lenie Lawrence, who examined Delbecq at the murder scene,\ndid not observe any jewelry on Delbecq, but did see a white mark around her left\nring finger indicating a ring had been there.\n     After being locked out in December 1992, Delbecq told Ventura she was\ngoing to hide a key under a rock outside her condominium. Ventura testified,\napparently based on a photograph, that a window screen in the living room was\n\n\n\n\n                                           9\n\fbowed, and more damaged than she recalled.6 A responding officer testified that a\ncorner of the window screen in the living room was slightly bent; it appeared the\nscreen had been taken out and put back improperly. Pieces of dried grass were on\nthe window sill and on the floor under the window sill.\n     In a dumpster near Delbecq‘s residence, police found a bloody pillowcase\nwith a pattern that was consistent with Delbecq‘s bedding. In the pillowcase,\npolice found a variety of items, including a check for an account held by Muriel\nDelbecq and Peggy Ventura, traveler‘s checks, two telephones Ventura identified\nas being her mother‘s, two pieces of telephone cord tied together, cut clothing, a\nflashlight, a wine bottle, two beer cans, a Seattle Seahawks game schedule, a golf\ntag, golf tees, dishwashing liquid, stain remover, shampoo, lotion, disposable\nrazors, and scissors.\n     Ventura testified that Delbecq, wearing her swimsuit, walked to the beach\nabout four blocks away nearly every morning. Lieutenant Lawrence searched\ndefendant‘s apartment several days after the murder. He found binoculars on a\nsmall table located directly beneath a bedroom window that faced Delbecq‘s\nresidence. Using the binoculars, he could clearly see what type of vehicle was\nentering and leaving the parking lot of Delbecq‘s building.\n     Dr. Alvin Omori, who conducted the autopsy on Delbecq, testified that her\nhead and right ear were bruised. There was bruising to the scalp caused by blunt\ntrauma. Her nose was fractured. There were bruises to her lips, and tears to the\ninner portion of her lips, indicating force or pressure was placed over the mouth\narea. Her neck was bruised, and her hyoid bone, or the bone located right above\n\n\n6   Ventura testified that before ―we realized how the screens go in‖ and how to\nremove them, ―we had used a knife to kind of pry open the side and lift them out .\n. . so there was one corner [where] . . . you could see . . . . it was kind of bent.‖\n\n\n                                         10\n\fthe voice box, was broken. The skin over the voice box had an ―incised type of\nabrasion,‖ caused by a sharpened or pointed object being scraped horizontally\nacross the skin. Similar abrasions appeared on the lower portion of the left neck,\nthe left anterior chest about the breast, and the breast area, including the nipples of\nboth breasts. Both breasts were bruised. There was a puncture wound on the left\nlower chest. Ligature marks on her wrists and ankles indicated she had been\nbound.\n     The genital area had a pattern of abrasions or scraping of the skin consistent\nwith fingernail marks. The entrance to the vaginal cavity was bruised, and there\nwere internal injuries to both the vaginal and rectal areas. There were two\nperforations in the vaginal cavity. The first perforation extended into the rectal\ncavity. The second perforation was to the right upper portion of the vaginal\ncavity, and extended into the abdominal cavity. This perforation was caused by a\nmousse can that was found protruding into the abdominal cavity. The rectum was\ntorn, and the bowel was perforated ―into the abdominal cavity.‖ There was visible\nbleeding in both the vaginal and rectal orifices, and approximately 100 cc‘s, or\nthree and one-third ounces, of blood was in the perforated area of the rectum and\nthe vaginal cavity. The injuries to the rectal and vaginal area appeared to have\nbeen inflicted before Delbecq‘s death.\n     The most probable cause of death was ―asphyxia or lack of oxygen due to\nstrangulation and/or suffocation.‖ The injuries to the vaginal area as well as the\nrectal tear were a contributing factor, but were not life threatening by themselves\nat the time she was asphyxiated.\n\n\n\n\n                                          11\n\f           2. Defense Evidence\n\n                a. Testimony of defendant and defendant’s family and friends\n     Laura McFarland, defendant‘s mother, testified that she married William\nEdwards, Sr., in July 1959. Defendant was born in 1961, and had an older brother\nWilliam, and a younger sister Elena. The family lived primarily in Florida until\ndefendant was about nine years old. They then moved to Puerto Rico for about 11\nmonths. Laura left defendant‘s father in July 1974, and she and the children\nreturned to California. The couple divorced in 1975, and Laura remarried in about\n1984. Defendant‘s father died in December 1992.\n     William, Sr., suspected that defendant was not his child. He first hit\ndefendant when defendant was about six months old. When defendant was a\nchild, his father hit or beat him almost daily. He nicknamed defendant and his\nbrother ―SFB-1‖ and ―SFB-2,‖ which stood for ―shit for brains one and two.‖\nWilliam, Sr., was also violent towards Laura.\n     When defendant was born, his father worked as a bartender and had an\nalcohol problem. Laura, who was a registered nurse, also had an alcohol problem,\nand in 1972 received a prescription for Valium. She continued to use prescription\nValium off and on until about the late 1970‘s. When defendant was about 11,\nLaura was run over by a car while she was intoxicated.\n     Laura first saw defendant under the influence of drugs when he was 14 years\nold, in February 1975. Defendant continued using drugs and alcohol. He\nperformed poorly in school, and he and his brother committed burglaries to\nsupport their habit.\n     Laura saw defendant‘s brother William drunk for the first time when he was\n14 years of age. Many years later, defendant‘s sister Elena began to have\nproblems with drugs and alcohol. Defendant‘s paternal grandmother was addicted\nto Ativan, and Laura‘s mother was addicted to prescription drugs such as Valium\n\n\n                                        12\n\fand Percodan. All four of Laura‘s siblings had problems with alcohol, and one of\nher sisters was also addicted to Valium.\n      Defendant testified. He was born in 1961 in Long Beach, California, and\nwas 35 years old at the time of trial. He dropped out of school when he was in the\neighth grade, and earned money doing day labor and odd jobs. When defendant\nwas in his late teens and early 20‘s, he and his brother William made money by\nselling what appeared to be paper LSD, but was actually nothing but paper with a\ndesign on it. Defendant testified, ―it was a safe way to make money without\ncommitting a crime.‖\n      Defendant recalled drinking a small amount of beer when he was about eight\nor nine years old and enjoying the effect of the alcohol. Defendant had other\nexperiences with alcohol after that. Defendant moved back to California from\nPuerto Rico when he was 12 or 13. His alcohol use ―increased drastically‖ and he\n―drank continuously.‖ He started smoking cigarettes when he was 12 years old,\ncontinued to smoke through the mid-1980‘s, and had only recently quit at the time\nof trial.\n      Defendant‘s first experience with drugs was using marijuana when he was 11\nor 12 years old. He tried hashish and cannabinol when he was about 12 years old.\nHe then tried LSD, cocaine, peyote, methamphetamine, amphetamines,\nbarbiturates, and heroin. When defendant was about 14 years old, he began\ninjecting drugs. His drug and alcohol use increased throughout his teenage years.\n      Defendant frequently used a technique called ―jacking off‖ when injecting\ndrugs. After injecting the drug, he would draw blood into the syringe, and then\nreinject it into his arm. He also used a technique called ―shooting water,‖ which\ninvolved attempting to collect and use any residue of a drug that might be left in a\nbag. When he was about 18, he injected an unknown drug, and ―thought [he] was\ngoing to die.‖\n\n                                           13\n\f     Defendant experienced his first alcoholic blackout when he was about 16\nyears old. Defendant described various situations in which he had blacked out,\nsuch as being with friends and making plans to go somewhere, and suddenly\nfinding himself walking apparently alone on the street in Long Beach at 5:00 a.m.\nand not knowing how he got there. On another occasion he found himself under a\nkitchen table in an unfamiliar residence. There was never a time when defendant\nbecame aware of his surroundings after blacking out and he never had reason to\nsuspect he had been involved in a violent crime.\n     In December 1985, defendant was involved in a motorcycle accident, and had\nsurgery on his right leg. As a result, his leg was in a cast. In the spring of 1986,\ndefendant met Kathryn Valentine while he was selling fake LSD at a Long Beach\nbus stop. Valentine drove by in her pickup truck, saw defendant had a cast, and\noffered him a ride. The two began dating shortly thereafter. Valentine gave\ndefendant a key to her truck, and told him that there was a spare key in a magnetic\nbox hidden on the truck.\n     Valentine introduced defendant to her mother, Marjorie Deeble, at Deeble‘s\nhouse. He also saw Deeble when he helped her and Valentine load Deeble‘s car\nfor a weekend trip to Palm Springs. Both meetings were cordial. Defendant\nborrowed Valentine‘s truck while she and her mother were in Palm Springs, and\nthe generator died. When Valentine and Deeble returned from Palm Springs,\ndefendant and Deeble discussed on the telephone what had happened to the truck,\nand Deeble told defendant to take it to the dealership for repair. During this\nconversation, Deeble did not raise her voice, and was firm and assertive, but not\nangry. Defendant was not bothered by the incident, nor did he have any ill will or\nhostile feelings toward Deeble or Valentine because of it. Defendant subsequently\nreceived a blank check from Deeble for the repair, and took the truck to the\ndealership.\n\n                                          14\n\f     Defendant and Valentine once went to Deeble‘s residence when she was not\nhome. He and Valentine were intimate. Defendant was not aware of a key hidden\noutside Deeble‘s residence, and never had possession of a key to her home.\n     Defendant continued to use drugs and alcohol during the time he dated\nValentine. Valentine did not know anything about drugs, and at her request,\ndefendant once let her watch him inject cocaine.\n     When defendant learned of Deeble‘s death, he and Valentine were visiting\nhis aunt and uncle. Valentine was told she had to go to the Los Alamitos Police\nDepartment because something had happened to her mother. Valentine and\ndefendant drove to the police station. Defendant waited in the lobby, and after a\nfew minutes he heard Valentine crying. Valentine and defendant continued to date\nfor a ―couple of weeks‖ after Deeble‘s death. They then ―drifted apart,‖ but\nremained on good terms. Defendant refused police requests for blood, urine, and\nhair samples.\n     Defendant denied killing Marjorie Deeble. In May of 1986, defendant had\nlittle mobility, could bend his right knee only a small amount, could not put his\nfull weight on his leg, and could not run. On the night of May 12, 1986, defendant\nand his brother sold fake LSD outside a Judas Priest concert in Los Angeles. They\nleft for the concert about 4:00 p.m., and returned home between 11:00 and 11:30\np.m. He drank alcohol throughout the concert. They then obtained drugs, and\ndefendant went home to inject cocaine and heroin and to drink. At no time that\nweek, including May 12, did defendant go to Deeble‘s residence.\n     Defendant testified he had been convicted of murder and burglary in Hawaii\nin 1994. He was also convicted of second degree burglary in California in 1984.\n     Janice Hunt testified that she dated defendant in Hawaii. Around December\n1992, defendant moved in with Hunt and her 12-year-old daughter. That same\nmonth, defendant‘s father was killed in an airplane crash. Defendant‘s demeanor\n\n                                         15\n\fchanged, and he became quiet and depressed. He drank more heavily than before.\nAt times, defendant became so intoxicated he had alcoholic blackouts. Hunt\ndescribed two incidents, one when defendant left in his work truck at night, and\nthe next morning she and defendant searched for the truck, and another when he\napparently left a bag of groceries outside all night. She did not believe he was\nusing drugs during the time he was living with her.\n     Hunt kept binoculars in her bedroom so that she could watch whales. She\nhad a partial ocean view from her bedroom window. Hunt had difficulty focusing\nthe binoculars, and never saw defendant look through or touch them.\n     On the evening of January 25, 1993, the night Delbecq was murdered, Hunt\nwas at home with her daughter and defendant. Between 8:00 and 8:30 p.m., an\nacquaintance informed defendant that his dog had been killed. Defendant found\nthe dog on the road, held it, and sobbed. They buried the dog at sea. Hunt\nreturned home, and when she went to bed between 11:00 and 11:30 p.m.,\ndefendant was not yet home. Defendant returned home before morning. The next\nday Hunt learned of a murder that had occurred nearby and informed defendant;\nhe seemed surprised.\n     David Long testified that he knew defendant for about a year before January\n1993. He observed defendant ingest drugs and alcohol nearly every time he saw\nhim. On the night of January 25, 1993, sometime between 8:30 and 11:00 p.m.,\ndefendant came to Long‘s apartment, talked about his dog, and injected half a\ngram to a gram of cocaine. When defendant left, he was more intoxicated with\ndrugs and alcohol than Long had ever seen him.\n     Carl Stevens knew defendant in junior high school in Long Beach. He saw\ndefendant outside of school approximately 10 to 25 times, and on each occasion\ndefendant was drinking alcohol or using drugs. Stevens had had no contact with\ndefendant for the last 13 years.\n\n                                         16\n\f     Vincent Portillo, defendant‘s cousin, lived in Maui for a month in 1991-1992.\nOne night he, defendant, and defendant‘s girlfriend Brenda drank heavily. They\ngot into a vehicle with defendant driving and Brenda in the passenger seat.\nBrenda and defendant argued, and Brenda hit defendant several times. Defendant\ndid not hit her back, but blocked her hits to maintain control of the vehicle. The\nfollowing day, defendant did not appear to be upset with Brenda over her behavior\nthe night before.\n\n               b. Testimony of other witnesses\n     Orange County Sheriff supervising forensic specialist Sharon Krenz testified\nthat on May 15, 1986, she observed baggies of pills on the dresser and the floor of\nDeeble‘s bedroom. She entered a different room and observed a TV Guide that\nwas open to Monday May 12. She also observed pinking shears on the floor of the\nbathroom. She did not observe any cigarette butts in the apartment. None of the\nfingerprints lifted from Deeble‘s apartment matched defendant‘s.\n     Richard Brown, a criminalist with the Orange County Sheriff‘s Office crime\nlab, testified that comparison of defendant‘s pubic hair to pubic hair found at the\ncrime scene eliminated defendant as a source of the crime scene hair. Brown was\nunable to compare the crime scene hair to that of seven men other than defendant\nbecause the hair standards submitted for those individuals contained too few hairs\nto make a comparison. He sent a report to the Los Alamitos Police Department\nstating that the hair standards were inadequate. He was never provided with\nadequate hair samples.\n     Sergeant James Jessen of the Los Alamitos Police Department testified that\nhe was the lead investigator of Deeble‘s murder. He interviewed Deeble‘s\ndaughter Kathryn Valentine on May 15, 1986. Valentine told Jessen that on\nMonday night (presumably Monday May 12, 1986), her brother had borrowed her\n\n\n\n                                         17\n\ftruck for a short period of time. Valentine also told Jessen that she kept a spare\nkey in a magnetic lock box on the vehicle. Although Jessen had looked inside\nValentine‘s truck, to his knowledge the truck had never been searched, nor had he\nrequested it be photographed or processed for fingerprints or trace evidence. The\nparties stipulated that Sergeant Jessen‘s report did not state that Valentine had told\nhim she had ―shown [defendant] a hidden key, he knew where one was‖ at her\nmother‘s residence. When Jessen met with defendant on May 20, 1986, he\nobserved defendant walked with a noticeable limp and appeared to have difficulty\nstanding on his right leg for a long period of time. There was no indication in\nJessen‘s report that he asked defendant for permission to search his living quarters.\n     On approximately October 21, 1987, Sergeant Jessen spoke with Maggie\nBlack of the Orange County Sheriff‘s Office crime lab regarding elimination\nprints. Black was dissatisfied with the quality of the prints taken of five\nindividuals other than defendant and said they would have to be redone.\n     Gloria Dangerfield, an employee of the facility manager for the Los Angeles\nSports Arena and Coliseum, testified that on May 12, 1986, Judas Priest\nperformed at a concert at the sports arena between about 8:00 and 11:00 p.m.\n     Paul Roy dated Deeble at some point after August 1985.7 On May 12 or 13,\n1986, Roy called Deeble at her home at 8:20 p.m. One or two days later, Roy\nwent to Deeble‘s apartment and knocked on her door. When no one answered, he\nplaced a greeting card for Deeble between the screen door and the closed wooden\ndoor. He did not recall a window screen leaning up against the wall of the house.\n\n\n\n\n7 Roy was a reluctant witness, and the parties agreed that Sergeant Jessen and\nRobert Courtney, the senior investigator for the Orange County Public Defender‘s\nOffice, could testify as to his statements.\n\n\n                                          18\n\f     Alden Olson testified that he dated Marjorie Deeble during the eight weeks\nbefore her death. He saw her do her laundry, including her sheets, three or four\ntimes. Deeble always locked the doors to her apartment — including her front\nscreen door — before going to bed.\n     Leonard Hirsch, who dated Deeble on a regular basis from about 1980 to\n1983, and less frequently after that, testified that Deeble‘s sheets were generally\nfresh and clean. She also vacuumed once a week, and often more than once a\nweek.\n     Vivian Camp, who sold Avon products, went to Deeble‘s home on Thursday\nMay 15, 1986 between 11:00 and 11:15 a.m. The door to Deeble‘s residence was\nopen about a foot, and Camp could see inside the residence. She did not notice a\nscreen off of the window that was facing the walkway.\n\n               c. Expert testimony\n     Defense expert Dr. Paul Wolf, a clinical professor of pathology, and a trauma\nand transplant pathologist at the University of California Medical Center in San\nDiego, and director of autopsy at the Veteran‘s Administration Medical Center in\nLa Jolla, testified as an expert on pathology. He had reviewed Deeble‘s autopsy\nreport. According to the report, Deeble had hemorrhaged from both ears.\nDr. Wolf stated this is a common finding after ligature strangulation because the\nblood vessels in the ears are engorged, and the ear drums are perforated and bleed.\nThere can also be tears in the middle ear that are either sharp or jagged.\nStrangulation, which causes asphyxia, creates pressure on the veins so great that\nsmall blood vessels in the nose, mouth, and ears will rupture. Because\nDr. Richards, the pathologist who performed Deeble‘s autopsy, had not taken any\nmicroscopic sections of the ears, there was no way to ascertain whether the\ndamage to the right eardrum was caused by a sharp object or by the increased\n\n\n\n                                         19\n\fpressure that followed the ligature strangulation. Moreover, ―incisional‖ was not a\nterm of art, and its use in an autopsy report did not ineluctably mean that the\ndamage had been caused by a sharp object.\n     Dr. Wolf further testified that when an individual is strangled, he or she can\nlose consciousness within 15 to 30 seconds, and it takes about four minutes of lack\nof oxygen for the heart and ―respiratory center‖ to die. Dr. Wolf agreed with\nDr. Fukumoto that an incision, which Dr. Richards did not perform, ―would have\nbeen the best procedure to confirm or disprove that there was a fracture‖ of the\nnose. He also agreed that the possible fracture was more likely from a blow rather\nthan a fall. A blow to the head of sufficient force to break a nose could cause\nimmediate unconsciousness. A person unconscious from either strangulation or a\nblow would not feel pain. Ligature strangulation and bleeding from the ears as a\nresult of ligature strangulation were not necessarily consistent with extreme or\nprolonged pain. Nor were the ligature marks on Deeble‘s ankles consistent with\nextreme or prolonged pain.\n     Dr. Wolf stated that a ―laceration‖ and a ―hemorrhage‖ can be microscopic in\nsize. He described the injuries to Deeble‘s vagina and rectum as microscopic and\n―[e]xtremely minor.‖ He opined they could have been caused by a finger or a\npenis. Deeble was menopausal, and Dr. Wolf opined that was the reason the\nvaginal mucosa (or lining of the vaginal wall) was so thin. When the mucosa is\nthin, any kind of manipulation by a finger, penis, or other foreign object is more\nlikely to cause microscopic lacerations. Although Dr. Richards reported\nlacerations and tears, he did not measure them. Dr. Wolf noted that there are\n―ruga folds‖ in the vagina that can be mistaken for a laceration, and that the only\nslide from the vagina showed ―a very minor removal of a mucosa.‖ Dr. Richards\nhad reported submucosal hemorrhage (or bleeding beneath the surface of the\nlining of the vaginal wall) in the vagina, and Dr. Wolf confirmed this in his\n\n                                         20\n\fexamination of a slide of a vaginal tissue section. It was ―such a small amount\nthat it wouldn‘t be too visible,‖ and Dr. Richards did not report seeing any blood\nin the vagina. For a criminalist to see a visible substance all the way around the\ntop of a can that he thought might be blood was inconsistent with the microscopic\nquantity of blood that was reported in the vagina. Moreover, because no blood\nwas observed in the rectum, there was not enough blood to go around the edge of a\ncap area.\n     Dr. Alex Stalcup testified as a specialist in addiction medicine. He did not\ninterview defendant and had not diagnosed him, although he had interviewed\nmembers of defendant‘s family.8 He had also received a record of defendant‘s\ncontacts with police, and transcripts of interviews with family members and\nindividuals familiar with defendant‘s drug use in the 1980‘s. He was not given\nany information about the Deeble and Delbecq murders.\n     Dr. Stalcup testified that alcoholism and drug addiction are illnesses. Signs\nof the disease of addiction include inability to control intake of the drug or alcohol\nand continued drug or alcohol use despite adverse consequences. He opined that\npredisposition based on genetics or child abuse, early drug experiences and the\ncircumstances of the first experience, and whether the individual is in an enabling\nenvironment in which drugs are easily available, widely used, and not\ndiscouraged, are factors that contribute to certain individuals becoming addicts\nwhile others do not. Genetics were the most, and child abuse was the second\nmost, prevalent risk factor for addiction or alcoholism. Considering defendant‘s\nhypothetical risk factors of genetic background, horrific childhood abuse, lack of\n\n\n8 The jury was instructed that Dr. Stalcup‘s testimony regarding statements by\nindividuals such as defendant‘s family members was not admissible to prove the\nfacts in the statements, but was admitted only to provide the basis for his opinion.\n\n\n                                          21\n\fsupervision, and an environment in which drugs were available, Dr. Stalcup\nopined: ―I frankly don‘t see how he escaped being an addict. This fellow didn‘t\nhave a chance.‖\n     Dr. Stalcup testified that one study indicated that individuals with a history\non both sides of the family of alcoholism or drug addiction had half of the normal\namount of endorphin. This meant ―they are very different in their ability to feel\nnormal. . . . Pleasure is hard to get. . . For them pleasure is b[l]unted.‖ ―[T]he term\nfor the way they feel is called chronic dysphoria. Dysphoria is the opposite of\neuphoria. . . . A lot of these kids from a very young age feel off.‖ ―Once these\nkids discover alcohol and drugs, unless there is early intervention, it is all over.\nBecause they feel pleasure, they feel satisfaction, they feel normal for the first\ntime in their life.‖ ―[N]ow for the first time [they] don‘t feel dysphoria.‖\n     When drugs such as amphetamines are injected, they reach the brain\ninstantly, and ―there is such an explosive release [of] dopamine and endorphin that\nit damages the pleasure centers. It literally damages or overwhelms the part of the\nbrain responsible for feeling normal pleasure. . . . [I]ndividuals who use drugs . . .\nwill progressively injure their ability to feel normal pleasure.‖ This explained why\nmany individuals do not stay sober, and instead relapse.\n     Dr. Stalcup found use of alcohol and drugs at a young age significant. He\nalso found it significant that defendant did not have a drug of choice, and that once\nhe was exposed to alcohol and drugs, he immediately lost control. ―[H]e is telling\nus that something was wrong with sobriety. Something was wrong with how he\nfelt.‖ Dr. Stalcup also noted that injecting drugs by the age of 13 or 14 was ―quite\nunusual,‖ and ―indicative of extremely rapid progression of addiction.‖ He said:\n―What I interpret when I hear these stories is . . . that something is really wrong\nwith this kid. Something is really intolerable for him or her. That something is\neither happening in their home or as we mentioned earlier, they are chronically\n\n                                          22\n\fdysphoric. They feel really bad.‖ Based on these factors, Dr. Stalcup opined that\ndefendant would fall in the 1 or 2 percent of the most severely affected drug\naddicts. Dr. Stalcup agreed with the prosecutor that he was ―not saying that a\nperson who is addicted to drugs or alcohol [was] not responsible for the violent\ncrimes they commit.‖\n       Dr. Stalcup testified that anyone who drinks can have an alcoholic blackout.\nSuch an individual has had enough alcohol that an average person can tell he or\nshe is intoxicated because of slurred speech and unsteadiness on his or her feet.\nAn individual who uses alcohol with cocaine is ―far, far, far more likely to go into\nan alcoholic blackout.‖ Sixteen is an early age for an individual to experience his\nfirst alcoholic blackout.\n\n             3. Rebuttal Evidence\n       Sergeant Jessen agreed with the prosecutor that he began to focus on\ndefendant to the exclusion of individuals mentioned by the defense because\ndefendant refused to supply the police with hair, saliva, and blood samples, and\nbecause in his mind, based on information he had received from laboratory\npersonnel, the individuals who had provided inadequate hair and fingerprint\nsamples were eliminated as donors of semen and fluids at the crime scene. It was\nnot until Jessen learned of a 1993 murder in Hawaii that he felt he had enough\nevidence to arrest defendant.\n\n        B. Second Penalty Phase9\n\n             1. Prosecution evidence\n       At the penalty retrial, the prosecution introduced much of the evidence from\nthe guilt phase. The prosecution also introduced evidence that defendant had\n\n\n9   As noted above, defendant‘s first penalty trial ended in a hung jury and mistrial.\n\n\n                                           23\n\fsuffered murder and sexual assault convictions in Hawaii and a burglary\nconviction in California.\n     N.T., a former girlfriend of defendant‘s, testified that she met defendant on\nMaui. One night in 1990, after their romantic relationship had ended, defendant,\nwho sounded drunk, called N.T. and asked to come over. N.T. said no. She later\nawoke to find defendant trying to insert a bottle into her vaginal and rectal areas.\nShe ordered defendant out of the house.\n     Orange County Sheriff‘s Deputy Timothy Martin testified that on July 8,\n1997, in the Orange County Men‘s Central Jail, he observed defendant sharpen a\nshank and hand it to another inmate.\n     Kathryn Valentine testified regarding the friendship with her mother that she\nhad lost when Deeble was murdered, and the guilt she felt for bringing defendant\ninto her family. She also testified regarding several family photographs. Lorraine\nJohnston, Deeble‘s sister, testified that she was eight years older than Deeble, and\nlike a mother to Deeble when she was an infant. They were close as adults, spoke\noften on the telephone, and visited each other. Because of Deeble‘s murder,\nJohnston had been physically ill, had been through counseling, and had seen a\ntrauma therapist.\n\n           2. Defense evidence\n     Fifty witnesses, including defendant, testified for the defense or their\ntestimony was read into the record. Much of the evidence from the defense\nportion of the guilt phase was introduced.\n\n               a. Testimony of defendant and other character witnesses\n     Defendant testified that in 1983, he was convicted of second degree burglary\nin Los Angeles County after breaking into a vehicle. Around November 1988, he\nwas convicted of taking or driving an automobile without the consent of the\n\n\n\n                                          24\n\fowner. In 1993, he was convicted of the second degree murder and sexual assault\nof Muriel Delbecq in Hawaii, and was currently serving five consecutive life\nsentences in that case. He had never been sentenced for a violent act before his\nHawaii sentence. In about September 1996, defendant was written up for heroin\nuse in the Orange County jail.\n     At times, defendant feared for his life at the jail. The ―worst time‖ was the\nsummer of 1997 when racial tensions were exacerbated. Defendant saw an\nindividual who had received medical treatment after his face was slashed. After\nthat incident, defendant tried to make the shank described by Deputy Martin.\nDefendant reasoned that if an aggressor knew he was armed, he would be less\nlikely to attack defendant. He did not plan to be an aggressor and assault anyone\nwith the weapon. In defendant‘s approximately nine years of incarceration, he had\nnever been written up for weapon possession before.\n     Defendant‘s father was a pilot in the Army, and served two tours of duty in\nVietnam. Defendant moved frequently as a child – living in California, Florida,\nGeorgia, and Puerto Rico – because of his father‘s work. When defendant was\nyoung, his father would strike him with his fist. He once knocked defendant out\nof his chair and drew blood because defendant had missed a number while\ncounting. Defendant‘s father drank heavily, and became increasingly abusive as\nhe drank more.\n     Defendant first got drunk when he was about eight years old. Defendant‘s\nparents separated when he was about 11 or 12 while the family was living in\nPuerto Rico. Defendant, his mother, and his siblings returned to Long Beach,\nwhere they had close relatives. Defendant‘s mother worked and attended night\nschool. Defendant began to skip school, and dropped out of school in the eighth\ngrade. He abused alcohol and drugs.\n\n\n\n                                         25\n\f     After his parents‘ separation, defendant had no contact with his father for\nseveral years. In about the summer of 1992, the two began communicating. In\nDecember 1992, defendant‘s father sent him a Christmas card, and signed it\n―Love, Dad,‖ something he had not done for years. Defendant‘s father died on\nDecember 19, 1992, in a plane crash. Defendant subsequently suffered bouts of\ndepression.\n     Defendant had experienced alcoholic blackouts, and described some of those\nexperiences. At the time of Deeble‘s death, defendant was heavily abusing drugs\nand alcohol. Defendant was not in an alcoholic blackout when he committed\nburglary in 1983, or when he made the shank.\n     In about November 1989, defendant moved to Maui, Hawaii to be with his\nsister Elena and to stop his drug abuse. He attended Narcotics Anonymous (NA)\nand Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings, remained drug and alcohol free for\nseven or eight months, and worked for a roofing company. He then began to use\ndrugs again and became homeless.\n     Defendant‘s son, Robert Mark Edwards, Jr. (―Robbie‖), was born on January\n23, 1985. Defendant described his efforts since 1985 to visit with his son and to\ncommunicate with him by telephone and letters. Defendant had counseled his son\nto refrain from using drugs, and was proud that his son had refused offers to try\nthem. Robbie had also sought his father‘s advice in other matters, and shared his\nachievements with his father. Defendant did not want Robbie to testify on his\nbehalf in part because he did not want him to feel ―maybe he said the wrong thing\nor something like that.‖\n     Defendant enjoyed reading while incarcerated, including books on parenting\nand spirituality. He had also written several short stories for Robbie. While\nincarcerated in Hawaii, he had attended GED classes and assisted other inmates\nwith their schoolwork. Defendant also enjoyed art, and some of his work was\n\n                                         26\n\fshown to the jury. He had participated in NA and AA meetings while in custody,\nand encouraged others who were not in custody to stay sober. Defendant could\nnot guarantee that he would not be under the influence of drugs or alcohol while in\nprison, but said, ―My sobriety I take one day at a time.‖\n     Defendant testified that he now believed he had killed Deeble and Delbecq,\nalthough he had no recollection of their murders. Defendant felt ―horrible,‖\nfasted, meditated, and prayed on the dates of the murders, and ―always pray[ed]\nfor the families.‖\n     Laura McFarland, defendant‘s mother, testified to many of the details in her\nguilt phase testimony. In addition, she testified she married defendant‘s father,\nWilliam Edwards, Sr., when she was 19 years old and had known him three\nmonths. At the time, Edwards was in the Marines. When defendant was born\nEdwards was a bartender and did not live at home. When defendant was about\none, Edwards joined the Army. Edwards was gone nearly all of the time from\ndefendant‘s birth until he was about 3 and a half years old.\n     After Edwards returned from being stationed abroad, his family joined him\nwhile he attended officers‘ candidate school in Georgia. Edwards was cruel to\ndefendant, who was about four, and struck him at least once or twice a week.\nMcFarland did not protect him from this abuse. Once, when defendant had a\nbowel movement during a bath, Edwards called him a ―filthy little boy,‖ and made\ndefendant pick up the stool and rub it over defendant‘s chest. Defendant began to\nhave night terrors. He said a puppet was trying to attack him, and described the\npuppet as wearing a sport coat similar to one his father had. Defendant had a G.I.\nJoe doll, and would leave it in the street and wait for cars to run over it. In\nDecember 1966, when defendant was about five and a half, Edwards left for\nVietnam.\n\n\n\n                                          27\n\f     When defendant was six, after his father returned from his first tour of duty\nin Vietnam, defendant regressed in his development. He would have bowel\nmovements in his pants, and if Edwards became aware of it, he would whip\ndefendant, and make him wash out his shorts in the bathtub. If Edwards\ndisapproved of a child‘s manners at the table, he would stab his or her hand with a\nfork. Once, when defendant was about 10 and had braces, Edwards punched him\nin the mouth, causing defendant‘s mouth to bleed and swell. Defendant frequently\nobserved his father physically abusing McFarland. McFarland never observed\nEdwards praise defendant for anything he had done, or be nurturing in any way.\n     Edwards was unfaithful, and would drive by the house with a girlfriend and\nwave to his children. He once introduced defendant‘s little sister Elena to a\nwoman he said was going to be her next mother.\n     After McFarland and Edwards divorced, Edwards told his children, ―[N]ow\nyou‘re out of my life and I‘ve never been so happy. Don‘t bother me.‖ After\nMcFarland left Edwards, she took defendant to a psychiatric clinic in Long Beach\n―off and on‖ for a ―long time.‖ At one point defendant went to live with his\nfather. Edwards was dissatisfied with everything defendant did, and sent him back\nto live with his mother. Defendant continued to try to establish a relationship with\nhis father until his father died, and was ―[a]bsolutely devastated‖ by his death.\n     McFarland described several incidents in which defendant had been kind to\nindividuals less fortunate than himself, and to stray animals.\n     McFarland testified that for some period of time she received substantial\nchild support. When Edwards married his second wife, he reduced McFarland‘s\nchild support so that she could no longer afford to stay at home, and she began to\nwork for a construction company. McFarland later married her current husband,\nJack McFarland, who assisted her in attending nursing school.\n\n\n\n                                         28\n\f     At the time of trial, McFarland had cared for defendant‘s son, Robbie, for\nabout four years. Once defendant was returned to California, he saw his son\nnearly every week, spoke to him on the telephone, and corresponded with him.\nDefendant took an active role in helping Robbie make decisions about his life, and\nwas nurturing, loving, and very proud of his son.\n     McFarland testified that if defendant were to be given a sentence of life\nimprisonment without the possibility of parole, his life would have value to her.\nShe begged the jury to spare her son‘s life.\n     Elena Edwards, defendant‘s sister, testified that their father was ―very scary,‖\nand would hit her brothers and was often verbally abusive to them. Their father\nstruck defendant about five times more than he struck defendant‘s brother. In\nElena‘s opinion, their father‘s behavior ―broke [defendant‘s] being before his\nbeing was established.‖\n     Elena had once been a substance abuser, but at the time of trial had been\nclean and sober for eight years. She found a new way of life at NA in Hawaii, and\nencouraged defendant to move there. Defendant did so, and began attending NA\nand AA meetings. After defendant was arrested in Hawaii, Elena visited him in\njail every weekend. During one visit, defendant looked down and told Elena, ―[I]f\nI did do this, I don‘t ever want to get out.‖ Elena and defendant were still close at\nthe time of trial.\n     Ana Guthridge, defendant‘s aunt, knew defendant as a child. Defendant was\na sweet little boy, very quiet and gentle, who was often overlooked because he was\nwell-behaved.\n     Scott Deeble, Marjorie Deeble‘s son, testified that at the time of his mother‘s\ndeath, he was a pilot in the Marine Corps. His mother‘s death was a huge loss.\nDeeble felt compassion for defendant, and said that in the nearly 12 years since his\n\n\n\n                                         29\n\fmother‘s death, he had learned, ―I cannot appreciate the ecstasy of my joy if I do\nnot embrace the depth of my grief. I have learned the big lesson in forgiveness.‖\n     Bridget Briggs testified she was a childhood friend of defendant‘s sister\nElena, and met defendant when she was about 11 years old and defendant was\nabout 18 years old. When defendant arrived at the Orange County jail in 1994, he\ntold Briggs that he ―didn‘t remember doing any of the things that they were saying\nthat he did. But if he did, . . . he should be punished accordingly.‖\n     Linda Lauer testified that she met defendant in late 1989 or early 1990 while\nshe was working on a research project for the Hawaii Department of Health.\nLauer was a community health outreach worker trying to prevent the spread of\nAIDS by educating and assessing intravenous drug users and their sexual partners.\nGetting intravenous drug users to answer a lengthy questionnaire was difficult\nbecause ―of the nature of I.V. drug users and the illegal things they do.‖\nDefendant was the first person to agree to be interviewed. Lauer interviewed\ndefendant at his apartment one evening, and did not feel threatened or vulnerable.\nDefendant appeared to be clean and sober, and responded thoughtfully to deeply\npersonal questions. He then encouraged others to participate, and ―it opened up\nthe project for us on Maui.‖\n     Craig Furtado, a roofing contractor on Maui, met defendant when Furtado\nlost his briefcase containing valuables at an airport on Maui. Defendant found the\nbriefcase, and called Furtado to return it to him. When the two met, nothing was\nmissing from the briefcase, and defendant refused a reward. Furtado subsequently\nhired defendant in his business for about five months. Defendant worked hard,\nwas prompt and honest, and got along with everyone. Despite his two murder\nconvictions, Furtado would hire defendant again if he had the opportunity.\n     Geraldine Jakeway testified she met defendant on Maui in about 1992.\nJakeway was in a wheelchair, and often swam at the beach. On one occasion,\n\n                                         30\n\fwhen no lifeguards were present to carry her into the water, she asked a group of\nindividuals if anyone could assist her. Defendant immediately volunteered, and\nalso assisted Jakeway out of the water when she was done swimming. Jakeway\nsaw defendant on other occasions at the beach when he again assisted her in and\nout of the water.\n     William Farmer testified he met defendant in 1989 on Maui at an NA dance.\nThey immediately became friends, and Farmer hired defendant to perform\nconstruction. Defendant was a religious person, and a loyal and hard worker. For\nsix to 12 months in 1992, defendant lived in Farmer‘s home. Farmer asked\ndefendant to leave one night when he came home drunk, which was against the\nhouse rules. Defendant did not appear to be the same person, and Farmer felt\nthreatened. The following morning, defendant returned to the house in a sober\nstate, and had no recollection of the night before. He appeared surprised when\nFarmer informed him he was not welcome in the home.\n     Albert Terry met and became close friends with defendant in 1989 while\nparticipating in AA and NA programs. Defendant was a loving, caring, and\nrespectful person. Terry visited the Maui Community Correctional Center to assist\nin AA meetings while defendant was incarcerated there. Defendant participated in\nthe meetings, and appeared to be sincere in his comments about drug and alcohol\nabuse. Terry believed defendant would be of benefit to other recovering addicts in\na custodial setting.\n     Orange County Sheriff‘s Deputy Robert Taft testified he worked at the\nOrange County jail. On two different occasions he was assigned to the\nadministrative segregation area in which defendant was housed. He never saw\ndefendant act disrespectfully to any deputies or have problems with any inmates.\n     Orange County Sheriff‘s Deputy Matthew Johnson testified he worked at the\nOrange County jail while defendant was incarcerated there. He wrote up\n\n                                        31\n\fdefendant once for possession of contraband, which consisted of extra clothing\nand pictures on the wall. Johnson otherwise observed that defendant followed the\njail rules, was respectful toward and communicated well with Johnson, and got\nalong with the other inmates.\n     Sergeant Robert Morris worked at the Maui Community Correctional Center,\nand testified that defendant was an ―ideal inmate‖ who was respectful to guards,\nnever gave ―anybody problems,‖ kept his cell clean and neat, and was helpful to\nnew inmates. Defendant had no ―write-ups‖ on Morris‘s watch, which was\nunusual for an inmate. During the time defendant was there, there were two\nescape attempts. Both times the individuals who escaped were in defendant‘s\nhousing area, but he did not go with them. Defendant enjoyed drawing, and\nattended NA and AA meetings and church services while incarcerated.\n     Sergeant Herbert Aguiar, who worked at the Maui Community Correctional\nCenter, testified that when defendant first came to the facility, he was dirty, very\nthin, had long hair, and his eyes were always moving like he was trapped\nsomewhere. Aguiar was leery of him, and his first impression was ―dirt bag.‖\nDefendant then started cleaning himself up, got a haircut, and started filling out.\nAguilar described defendant as a ―model inmate,‖ whom he had never seen be\ndisrespectful to anyone. Defendant engaged in many activities at the facility,\nincluding beginning work on his GED.\n     Reverend Diane Winter, a ministerial counselor, met defendant while\nconducting classes and counseling inmates in the Maui Community Correctional\nCenter. Defendant took classes with Winter, and was respectful, kind, and\ninterested in learning. Winters perceived defendant as genuine and not\nmanipulative in class. Winters had observed defendant with his girlfriend, Janice\nHunt, and he was kind, respectful, and loving. Winters said that defendant had\ncried sometimes and been very depressed. There were numerous occasions on\n\n                                          32\n\fwhich defendant felt a lot of pain, and sometimes he would break down and cry\nbecause he said he did not remember what he had done. Defendant said that if he\nhad killed Delbecq, he was a ―monster.‖ He also said, ―if I had done that . . . it is\nhorrible, I shouldn‘t be allowed to live in society.‖ Defendant would ask Winter\n―to pray for the family,‖ and ―we would pray together, and he would cry.‖\nDefendant took full responsibility for his addiction, and did not offer drugs and\nalcohol as an excuse for his situation. Defendant was respectful and kind to\nguards and staff at the jail, and helpful to other inmates. During her years working\nin a jail setting, Winters had been asked 80-90 times to testify on a prisoner‘s\nbehalf. She had only testified about four or five times, including once before for\ndefendant.\n     Karen Phaneuf, an adult educator, testified she taught defendant in GED\nclasses at the Maui Community Correctional Center. Defendant was friendly and\nhelpful. He had a ―great mind,‖ and was interested in reading at a much higher\nlevel than a GED. Most of the students other than defendant were working at a\nvery remedial level, and defendant would assist Phaneuf with those students so\nthat they could pass their GED exam. Defendant was not shackled or handcuffed\nduring class, but Phaneuf had no fear of him. Defendant was always cordial to\nother inmates, as well as to custodial officers who would walk though the\nclassroom, and was a calming influence in the classroom. Phaneuf had\ncorresponded with defendant since he left Maui, and assisted him on several\nstories defendant had written. She described defendant as a ―gifted writer.‖\n     Dominic Bagarozzi testified he met defendant while they were both\nincarcerated at the Orange County jail in about August 1994. Bagarozzi agreed\nwith counsel that at that time Bagarozzi was ―a bad guy who had given up,‖ and\nwho had a drug problem. Bagarozzi and defendant were day room partners in\nadministrative segregation, and knowing defendant made Bagarozzi a better\n\n                                          33\n\fperson and changed his outlook on life. Bagarozzi had appeared on television and\nin film as a child, and wanted to return to that profession, but did not think it was\n―cool.‖ Defendant told him he could do anything he wanted to do, and while he\ncould be a convict and stay in prison for the rest of his life, ―it would be more of a\nchallenge to try to achieve my goals.‖ Bagarozzi was now out of jail, and in the\npast few months had appeared on Ally McBeal, a television pilot with Sam Elliott,\nand in a television commercial. Jean Bagarozzi, Dominic‘s mother, testified that\nwhen her son went to jail, he was a drug addicted, angry, and immature person.\nAfter he was placed in administrative segregation and met defendant, he began to\n―talk sense,‖ and Jean heard about defendant and the advice he gave her son.\nDominic followed defendant‘s advice, and was now an employed, mature, and\ndrug-free person.\n     Charles Quesnel testified he met defendant in February 1993 while\nincarcerated in Hawaii. Quesnel had a history of drug and alcohol abuse, and\ndefendant encouraged him to attend AA and NA meetings, and a self-awareness\nclass. As a result of defendant‘s influence, Quesnel, who had previously been in\nand out of custody apparently because of his drug usage, had been clean for over\nfive years.\n     Jimmy Ekstrom testified he met defendant in March 1993 while serving six\nmonths for vehicular manslaughter in the Maui Community Correctional Center.\nEkstrom had never been in custody before, and was frightened. Defendant talked\nto him about how to get along with other inmates and the guards, and had his sister\nElena give Ekstrom money so that he could purchase items at the jail store.\nDefendant also encouraged Ekstrom to attend GED classes, and helped him with\nthe assignments.\n     Mark White testified that he met defendant while he was incarcerated on\nMaui pending trial on a robbery charge. When White arrived, he went through\n\n                                          34\n\fwithdrawal from heroin and cocaine. After he was brought to the general\npopulation he was still sick, and defendant would talk to him, bring him sweets\nwhich White craved, and share cigarettes. Defendant also helped White get along\nwith the other inmates. White never saw defendant argue with anyone, and he\nonce was able to calm an aggressive inmate who was upset at White. Defendant\nencouraged White to attend NA and AA meetings. White was struck at the\nmeetings by how defendant shared from his heart his experiences, and White\nsubsequently continued his involvement in the NA and AA programs when he\nwent to prison.\n     Lynn Pendzik, a retired schoolteacher, testified she began to correspond with\ndefendant while he was incarcerated in the Maui Community Correctional Center.\nAfter several months, defendant asked her to visit, and the two became friends.\nOnce while defendant was on trial in Hawaii he refused a visit with Pendzik.\nDefendant subsequently wrote to her: ―Remember during the trial when it was at\nthe most horrible testimony? You came up that weekend and I refused your visit.\nDo you know why I did that? I did it because I was utterly appalled by what they\nhad shown in court and that I was responsible for it. And I hated myself, and I felt\nthat you certainly must hate me. I was ashamed and I did not want to face you.‖\n\n                  b. Expert testimony\n     Dr. Roberta Falke, a clinical psychologist, testified that she was asked to\nobserve the nature of the relationship between defendant and his son Robbie, and\ndefendant‘s ability to parent effectively while incarcerated. Falke had visited\ndefendant in jail about every other week for two years. She had spent about 70\nhours with defendant, and 50 hours with Robbie. On four occasions Falke had\nalso taken Robbie to visit defendant and observed their interaction. Defendant and\nRobbie were separated by glass and spoke to each other on the telephone. In\n\n\n\n                                         35\n\faddition, Falke met with Laura and Jack McFarland, Robbie‘s grandmother and\nher husband and Robbie‘s custodians, defendant‘s sister Elena, Robbie‘s\nbiological mother Gina Stevens, and Gina‘s mother Bernice.\n     Dr. Falke believed defendant and Robbie had a strong relationship.\nDefendant knew a great deal about what Robbie was studying in school, what\nproblems he was having in school, and what his special needs were. Robbie had\nbeen attending the Sylvan Learning Center before Falke was hired, and defendant\nrequested that she meet with individuals there and take notes about what Robbie\nwas working on. Defendant then requested Falke facilitate contact between the\nSylvan tutors and Robbie‘s school teachers so they could coordinate their efforts.\nFalke became defendant‘s arms and legs in the community, and he ―constantly‖\nkept her running on issues concerning Robbie‘s academics.\n     Defendant was also concerned about Robbie‘s low self-esteem. He sought\nDr. Falke‘s advice as to what to say to Robbie when he made self-deprecating\nremarks, and Falke advised defendant about techniques for speaking with Robbie\nin other situations.\n     Dr. Falke opined that defendant was a ―remarkable‖ parent because of his\n―unflagging devotion.‖ ―[T]hat man put me to work for his son, and I barely got a\nbreak.‖ In her view, defendant was at the top of the list of individuals who were\nimportant to Robbie in terms of support systems, and it was essential their\nrelationship continue.\n     Dr. Kara Cross, a clinical psychologist and Robbie‘s therapist, testified that\nwhen she began to treat Robbie about three years earlier, when he was about 10,\nhe was very depressed, had learning disabilities, and had an adjustment disorder.\nThe treatment plan was to incorporate Robbie‘s relationship with defendant, which\nwas the ―strength‖ in Robbie‘s life that affected him the most, and use that\nrelationship to help Robbie overcome depression and learn better coping skills.\n\n                                         36\n\fCross gave Robbie assignments to complete with defendant from workbooks\ndesigned to improve psychosocial communication within a family. Defendant\nwould frequently telephone Cross and tell her how he had addressed a particular\nassignment and ask if he had done it correctly and how he could do it better next\ntime. Although contact visits were generally not allowed, Cross was able to\narrange a 30-minute contact visit between defendant and Robbie. After that visit,\nRobbie was a changed child; he was animated and would reach out and touch\nothers in a teasing manner. Cross opined that defendant‘s relationship with\nRobbie was the ―bedrock of Robbie‘s emotional stability,‖ and that it was vital\nthat the relationship continue.\n     Father John McAndrew, a Roman Catholic priest, testified that he was a\nrecovering alcoholic, and about a third of his ministerial time was devoted to\nworking with individuals in recovery. McAndrew testified that blackouts are often\nsymptomatic of the disease of addiction. McAndrew had experienced alcoholic\nblackouts, and was ashamed of things he was told he had done during them.\n     Father McAndrew knew defendant, and had visited him many times at the\nOrange County jail. McAndrew gave defendant assignments to complete with\nregard to a 12-step program, and was defendant‘s only regular contact for an\nalcohol or drug recovery program. McAndrew was aware that about a year and a\nhalf earlier defendant had been found to be under the influence of heroin in jail. It\nis much harder to return to a recovery program after a relapse, and so when an\nindividual returned, that told McAndrew ―there is a willingness there.‖\nMcAndrew found defendant inspirational, and believed he had ―an awful lot to\noffer to other people in recovery.‖\n     Dr. Stalcup testified as a specialist in addiction medicine in a manner similar\nto his testimony at the guilt phase. In addition, he testified that a blackout is\nreferred to as ―anterograde amnesia,‖ which means that ―from the time of onset of\n\n                                          37\n\fthe drug until the time the drug effect wears off, there is no recording in memory\nof the events that happened during that time.‖ ―[T]here‘s immediate memory,‖\nand ―[t]hen you have long-term memory, which is where thing are stored. There is\na transfer step, and alcohol and tranquilizers and barbiturates block the transfer\nstep. So immediate memory is happening, but it‘s not written down in permanent\nmemory.‖ Acts performed during a blackout are immediately remembered and\nintentionally done, such as walking down a beach, seeing the waves, and hearing a\nseal bark, but are not recorded. In mild blackouts, individuals have brief images in\ntheir mind of what they were doing. In moderate blackouts, individuals wake up\nthe next day and cannot remember what they did the previous day. In severe\nblackouts, individuals cannot remember what they are doing now. Generally, to\nhave a blackout, one has to drink enough to appear and know one is intoxicated.\nDr. Stalcup also agreed with the prosecutor that there are individuals who would\ntry to counter dysphoria by sexually causing suffering in others.\n\n           3. Rebuttal evidence\n     Dr. Park Dietz, a clinical professor of psychiatry and biobehavioral sciences\nat the University of California at Los Angeles School of Medicine, testified. He\nhad reviewed defendant‘s testimony in this case, crime scene and witness reports\nof the crimes, witness and background statements, and crime scene and autopsy\nphotographs from the Deeble and Delbecq homicides. An alcohol blackout is the\nterm ―used to refer to loss of memory during periods of intense drinking,\nespecially among people who are very heavy chronic alcohol users. A blackout is\na period of time ―for which an individual no longer has the memory because while\nthey were doing what they were doing, their brain did not permanently record the\ninformation into‖ long-term memory. Assuming defendant committed both\nmurders, and that he now had no memory of either homicide because of the effect\n\n\n\n                                         38\n\fof alcohol, this would mean that he ―is now in a blackout for both homicides.‖\nDr. Dietz added, ―But it doesn‘t tell us anything about his mental state at the time\nof the homicides except that he was drunk.‖ He also opined, ―looking at what\nhappened in each homicide, . . . that shows if intoxicated he wasn‘t too intoxicated\nto engage in a very orderly sequence of complicated behaviors.‖ These included\nthe ―things done to gain access to each victim, to do things to the victims and their\nproperty and to leave the scene.‖ Dr. Dietz agreed with the prosecutor that ―the\nblackout does not affect his mental state while he was perpetuating the acts,‖\nnoting that the ―blackout doesn‘t begin until later.‖ The blackout ―begins at least\nseconds after each action, maybe minutes, but the blackout is what he is later in. It\nis not something he is in while he is doing it.‖ Dr. Dietz agreed with the\nprosecutor that ―the blackout simply means that short-term memory has not been\nrecorded into long-term memory.‖ Dr. Dietz stated: ―[A]s he is committing the\nhomicides, . . . he is behaving intentionally [and] voluntarily. He knows where he\nis, what he is doing, who he is with, why he is engaging in each action, what he\nwants to do next, which things please him and which things don‘t. . . . Now, he\nmay not know what he did five minutes ago or ten minutes ago. He may be in a\nblackout already for those. But for what he just did and what he is going to do\nnext, he is not in any blackout at all. He is right there in the present tense in the\nmoment doing as he pleases.‖ Dr. Dietz agreed with the prosecutor that the\ncircumstance that defendant placed a comforter over Delbecq‘s window\ndemonstrated that ―at that moment he knows what he is doing is wrong. He is\ntrying to hide it from the outside world.‖\n\n\n\n\n                                          39\n\f                                     II. DISCUSSION\n\n       A. Pretrial Issues\n\n           1. Asserted Wheeler error\n     Defendant contends that the prosecutor exercised a peremptory challenge in a\ndiscriminatory manner to exclude a Black prospective juror in violation of his\nrights under the Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the federal\nConstitution, and article I, section 16 of the state Constitution. (Batson v.\nKentucky (1986) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 89; People v.

We agree with the trial court that defendant made no prima facie\nshowing that Prospective Juror M.M. was challenged because of her race.\n\n               a. Factual background\n     On Prospective Juror M.M.‘s questionnaire, when asked her general feelings\nabout the death penalty, she responded: ―I‘ve thought about it on a personal level\nwithout coming to a conclusion as to whether society should or should not have\nthe death penalty. As the law now states we have it so therefore I am prepared to\nobey the law of the land. On a personal level I will continue to ponder.‖ On voir\ndire, the prosecutor read part of this response, and asked M.M., ―Have you\nresolved that issue in your own mind since you [have] been here the last few\ndays?‖ She responded, ―Not really.‖ The prosecutor asked no other questions and\npassed M.M. for cause. The defense accepted the panel, and the prosecutor\nexercised a peremptory challenge against M.M.\n     Defense counsel made a Wheeler motion. Counsel stated that Prospective\nJuror M.M. was Black, there appeared to be only two Black prospective jurors in\nthe panel, and only one Black woman, who was Prospective Juror M.M. He also\nobserved that M.M. ―clearly passed for cause.‖ The court found no prima facie\n\n\n\n\n                                          40\n\fcase of discrimination, stating that it had not seen anything to indicate the\nprosecutor excused the prospective juror because of her race.\n\n                b. Analysis\n     The use of peremptory challenges to exclude prospective jurors based on race\nviolates both the federal and state Constitutions. (People v.

To do so, the following\nprocedure applies: ―First, the defendant must make out a prima facie case ‗by\nshowing that the totality of the relevant facts gives rise to an inference of\ndiscriminatory purpose.‘ [Citations.] Second, once the defendant has made out a\nprima facie case, the ‗burden shifts to the State to explain adequately the racial\nexclusion‘ by offering permissible race-neutral justifications for the strikes.\n[Citations.] Third, ‗[i]f a race-neutral explanation is tendered, the trial court must\nthen decide . . . whether the opponent of the strike has proved purposeful racial\ndiscrimination.‘ ‖ (Johnson v.

Under certain circumstances perfunctory voir dire can be\nindicative of hidden bias. (Bell, supra, 40 Cal.4th at p. 598.) Here, however, the\nprosecutor‘s question focused on M.M.‘s ambivalence about the death penalty,\nwhich she confirmed on voir dire remained unresolved. Contrary to defendant‘s\nassertion, this inquiry does not constitute ―powerful circumstantial evidence that\nthe challenge was exercised upon a prohibited race basis.‖ Moreover, before voir\ndire, M.M. had completed a 14-page questionnaire containing 38 questions with\nsubparts.

Moreover, although it is true that the prosecutor questioned some\nprospective jurors at greater length than he did M.M., he also engaged in\nperfunctory questioning of other prospective jurors, and at times declined to ask\nany questions at all. The record therefore provides no indication that there was\nany discernible racial pattern to the prosecutor‘s questioning.\n\n           2. Denial of motion to dismiss the panel\n     Defendant contends the trial court erroneously denied his motion to dismiss\nthe panel in violation of his rights under the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth\nAmendments to the federal Constitution, and article I, sections 15-17 of the state\nConstitution.11 We disagree.\n\n               a. Factual background\n     At the outset of Prospective Juror R.B.‘s voir dire, which was conducted in\nfront of other prospective jurors, the trial court observed that R.B. was a peace\nofficer, and asked, ―[C]an you be an objective juror in this type of case?‖ R.B.\nanswered: ―I am very fair. I can be objective, but . . . I am a correctional peace\nofficer, so . . . I know a lot of murderers. I have dealt with a lot of people who\nhave been convicted of murders, and I have seen a lot of people who are there . . .\n\n\n11  In this and certain other appellate claims defendant contends the asserted error\ninfringed upon his constitutional rights. ―In those instances where he did not\npresent constitutional theories below, it appears that either (1) the appellate claim\nis one that required no objection to preserve it, or (2) the new arguments are based\non factual or legal standards no different from those the trial court was asked to\napply, but raise the additional legal consequence of violating the Constitution. ‗To\nthat extent, defendant‘s new constitutional arguments are not forfeited on appeal.‘\n(People v.

And since I think I filled the questionnaire out . . . I sit at\nnighttime thinking about it. I deal with all these people, and . . . they are hard to\ndeal with if they just have life, you know, because they are still affecting\npeople. . . . [T]here are still victims inside correctional institutes . . . and prisons.\nBut I see there are some people that can be in for life and they are fine, you know.\nIt is hard because I have to deal with it. The thing we just had a few weeks ago\nsomeone in for 25 to life that beat one of us officers to death.‖\n     The trial court asked if the incident happened inside the California Youth\nAuthority (CYA), and Prospective Juror R.B. responded: ―Yeah, out there in\nChino. So that is hard to deal with because I think that gentleman, young man, he\nis 24, 25, he . . . beat someone to death. So there is another victim he created\nwhile he was in. So it is hard to say, but I could make that decision. . . . I don‘t\nknow what else to really say. I would have to listen to everything, hear\neverything. And if . . . he is found guilty, then it would be hard not to go for the\ndeath penalty, very hard because again I see the people that are locked up. I deal\nwith hundreds of them that are in for life, and I know what it is like in there. And\nI know that it is a lot easier than these people know . . . it is not as bad as what\nthese people think it is.‖\n     The trial court said, ―[T]hat is a different view.‖ Prospective Juror R.B.\ncontinued, ―See, I am in there. I am locked up every day with them, and what\nsociety sees and what people. . . .‖ The trial court then cut R.B. off and said,\n―Let‘s stay to the bottom line. Can you be an objective juror in this case if you get\nto a penalty phase?‖ R.B. answered that he would have to listen to everything.\nWhen asked if he could conceive of voting for life imprisonment without the\npossibility of parole in this case, R.B. assured the court, ―I would have to listen to\nthe attorneys. I wouldn‘t say I would automatically jump to [a] conclusion. I\ndon‘t jump to conclusions.‖ The trial court said: ―There is another problem. One,\n\n                                            44\n\fwe‘re not talking about the California Youth Authority here. We are talking about\nother places. And it wouldn‘t be proper for you to educate the jurors in the jury\nroom what it is like to be incarcerated in a state prison. I know what the Youth\nAuthority is, okay? I am not educating the jury either. [B]ut do you understand\nwhat I am saying? You would have to keep those thoughts to yourself?‖ R.B.\nsaid, ―Exactly.‖\n     Subsequently, outside the presence of the prospective jurors, defense counsel\nmoved to excuse the entire jury venire based on Prospective Juror R.B.‘s\nstatements regarding experiences in the CYA, and ―what he knows about life\nwithout the possibility of parole.‖ He asserted, ―He basically said to them that\nLWOP isn‘t what these people think; I know it is not that hard.‖ The trial court\nsaid: ―First of all, you have no basis upon which to base your conclusion that\nanybody has been tainted or even that anybody understood. I knew where he was\ngoing, and I shut him off. And then I told him that we‘re not talking about C.Y.A.\nWe are talking about other places. And that would be a quantum leap for jurors to\nthink that prison is like C.Y.A. Now, it is, but they don‘t know that. They would\nassume that C.Y.A. is for the kids, and that state prison is for the bad guys, and\nthere is harsher treatment in prison, I think your conclusion is wrong. And absent\nsome showing, which means if you want to bring it up, I will probably permit\nsome limit[ed] question[ing] in that regard and we can even do it one on one. I\ndon‘t see a problem. I would be afraid about bringing attention to it —‖ Defense\ncounsel said, ―That is our concern, too.‖ The court responded, ―So that is a big\nconcern.‖ The trial court denied the motion to excuse the entire panel. Defense\ncounsel then moved to excuse Prospective Juror R.B., and the court granted the\nmotion.\n     That afternoon, the defense submitted a proposed admonition. Defense\ncounsel requested that any questioning of prospective jurors would be done in\n\n                                         45\n\fprivate, and the court agreed. The proposed admonition was modified by the court\nafter discussion with counsel. The following admonition was given to the panel:\n―This morning you may recall hearing a prospective juror [R.B.], who was sitting\nin seat No. 3 . . . express some of his opinions and experiences as a counselor at\nthe California Youth Authority. The custodial facilities for minors are far\ndifferent than those for adults. [R.B.] has no experience as a custodial officer in\nthe adult state prison system or with adult life without possibility of parole\nprisoners. The purpose of incarceration in a state prison for crime is punishment.\nDo any of you have any question regarding [R.B.‘s] statement? If so, please raise\nyour hand? Anybody with a hand. Do any of you wish to comment on [R.B.‘s]\nstatement, please raise your hand. How many of you don‘t recall what he said,\nplease raise your hand. Okay. Several . . . hands went up, and no hand went up\nfor the questions.‖ Prospective Juror J.D. indicated that she had a comment. The\ncourt told her: ―We are going to talk to you. We are going to do it in private.‖\nThe court then told the entire panel: ―Anybody else? If anything comes to mind,\njust let me know when you are called forward and we‘ll talk about it, but I want to\ntalk about it in private. That makes sense, doesn‘t it ladies and gentlemen? In any\nevent, for those of you who may recall what [R.B.] said, you are to disregard his\nstatement regarding his personal experiences.‖\n\n               b. Discussion\n     Defendant contends he was prejudiced by Prospective Juror R.B.‘s remarks\nbecause he in effect ―predicted that [defendant] might continue to pose a danger to\nothers if he was sentenced to life imprisonment‖ without the possibility of parole,\nand the remarks ―created a substantial danger that jurors would select the death\npenalty.‖ However, R.B.‘s comments occurred before the guilt phase, and a\ndifferent jury was impaneled for the second penalty phase. No prejudice at the\n\n\n\n                                          46\n\fsecond penalty phase was possible. Defendant further summarily contends that\n―the assumptions inherent in [R.B.‘s] remarks struck at the heart of the\npresumption of innocence and [the] prosecution‘s burden of proof.‖ It is not\napparent – and defendant does not explain – how R.B.‘s challenged remarks\nrelated to any issue at the guilt phase.\n     Defendant further contends the court erred in failing to ask the venire\nwhether ―there was a question or comment about its instruction or whether they\ncould disregard [Prospective Juror R.B.‘s] comments.‖ Defense counsel proposed\nthe instruction, and the trial court worked with both counsel at length in modifying\nit. At the end of the hearing, the trial court inquired, ―Any further comments on\nany requested admonition as modified?‖ Defense counsel responded, ―No, your\nhonor.‖ Defendant has therefore forfeited any claim that the instruction was\nincomplete. (See People v. Wilson (2008) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2507466\"><a href=\"/opinion/2507466/people-v-wilson/\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 22.)\n     Defendant further contends the trial court erred in failing to ―conduct a\nhearing to exclude those jurors who overheard [Prospective Juror R.B.‘s] improper\nremarks and could not promise to ignore them during their deliberations.‖ The\ntrial court offered to allow limited questioning ―one on one‖ regarding R.B.‘s\ncomments, but noted it was concerned ―about bringing attention to it.‖ Defense\ncounsel responded, ―That is our concern, too.‖ Defense counsel subsequently\nrequested that prospective jurors with questions or comments be questioned in\nprivate. Defendant thus chose not to question every prospective juror regarding\nR.B.‘s remarks, and agreed to private examination of those who had comments or\nquestions. This claim is therefore forfeited.\n     Moreover, the trial court instructed the panel that Prospective Juror R.B‘s\nexperience was in a facility for minors that was ―far different than those for\nadults,‖ and that he had ―no experience as a custodial officer in the adult state\nprison system or with adult life without possibility of parole prisoners.‖ It further\n\n                                           47\n\finstructed the jury to disregard R.B.‘s comments, solicited any comments or\nquestions the prospective jurors might have about R.B.‘s remarks, and said ―[i]f\nanything comes to mind, just let me know when you are called forward and we‘ll\ntalk about it, but I want to talk about it in private.‖ This inquiry was sufficient to\nascertain whether the prospective jurors were free from bias after R.B.‘s remarks.\nFinally, as noted above, a different jury determined penalty.\n     Defendant also contends that the record does not reflect that Prospective\nJuror J.D. was ever questioned in camera. However, J.D. did not serve on the jury,\nso any comment she may have had could not have affected the verdict.\n\n       B. Guilt Phase Issues\n\n           1. Denial of mistrial motion\n     Defendant contends the trial court erred in denying defendant‘s motion for\nmistrial. We disagree.\n     During his opening statement, while discussing the Delbecq murder, the\nprosecutor said, ―In fact, when [defendant] was ultimately arrested for this —\nwhen [defendant] was found to be involved,‖ the police found certain evidence.\nAfter the prosecutor completed his opening statement, defendant moved for a\nmistrial outside the presence of the jury. Defense counsel stated, ―Not 10 minutes\nbefore [the prosecutor] delivered his opening statement I asked him if he was\ngoing to mention the fact of the defendant‘s arrest in Hawaii . . . and [the\nprosecutor] said no . . . because [he did not] think that that is relevant to anything\nin this case. And as we all know, arrest is just one step away from conviction.\nAnd this jury is not going to hear about the conviction. And during the opening\nstatement what does [the prosecutor] do? He mentions that the defendant was\narrested.‖ The court asked, ―How would this jury not figure that out sooner or\nlater?‖ Defense counsel replied that even if the jury figured it out, that was ―a far\n\n\n\n                                          48\n\fcry from someone telling them that.‖ The prosecutor said that he had in good faith\ntold defense counsel he would not bring up defendant‘s arrest, and that his\ncomment was inadvertent. The court denied the mistrial motion.\n     ― ‗A mistrial should be granted if the court is apprised of prejudice that it\njudges incurable by admonition or instruction. [Citation.] Whether a particular\nincident is incurably prejudicial is by its nature a speculative matter, and the trial\ncourt is vested with considerable discretion in ruling on mistrial motions.\n[Citation.]‘ [Citation.] A motion for a mistrial should be granted when ‗ ― ‗a\n[defendant‘s] chances of receiving a fair trial have been irreparably damaged.‘ ‖ ‘\n‖ (People v. Collins (2010) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2518032\"><a href=\"/opinion/2518032/people-v-collins/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">175</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 198.) We conclude here that the\nprosecutor‘s use of the word ―arrest‖ — even if erroneous — was not ―so\nincurably prejudicial that a new trial was required.‖ (People v. Ledesma (2006)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2599941\"><a href=\"/opinion/2599941/people-v-ledesma/\"><span class=\"volume\">39</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">641</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 683.)\n     The prosecutor reference to defendant‘s arrest was brief and isolated. Indeed,\nthe prosecutor corrected himself midsentence and changed ―arrested‖ to\n―involved.‖ Moreover, the prosecutor contended during his opening statement that\ndefendant was linked to Delbecq‘s murder by the circumstance that his bloody\nfootprint and palm prints were found inside her bedroom. Hence, as the trial court\nobserved, the jury would already surmise defendant had been arrested for that\noffense. (See Dement, supra, 53 Cal.4th at p. 40 [witness‘s improper comment\n―largely duplicative of evidence the jury properly received‖].) In addition, the jury\nhad already been instructed that statements by the attorneys during the trial were\nnot evidence. Hence the trial court did not abuse its broad discretion in denying\nthe mistrial motion.\n\n\n\n\n                                          49\n\f           2. Challenge to pathologist’s testimony\n     Defendant contends the trial court prejudicially erred in allowing Dr. Richard\nFukumoto, a pathologist who did not perform Marjorie Deeble‘s autopsy, to testify\nat the guilt and second penalty phase regarding the autopsy report and his opinions\nbased on that report in violation of defendant‘s confrontation rights under the\nSixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the federal Constitution. (See ante, at pp. 3-\n7.) He further contends that even if Dr. Fukumoto‘s testimony was not wholly\ninadmissible, his opinions lacked foundation, and were unduly prejudicial. (Evid.\nCode, § 352.) We conclude these claims are without merit.\n\n               a. Factual background\n     Dr. Fukumoto worked at Richards, Fisher, Fukumoto Medical Group, Inc.\nThe medical group had a contract with the Orange County Sheriff‘s Department to\nperform autopsies in Orange County. Dr. Richards, who had performed Deeble‘s\n1986 autopsy and written an autopsy report, had since retired. The autopsy report\nwas signed, but not sworn or certified. The report itself was not admitted into\nevidence. Dwight Reed, a criminalist who worked for Orange County Sheriff-\nCoroner Forensic Sciences Services, attended the autopsy. In addition to\nreviewing the report, Dr. Fukumoto reviewed about 100 photographs of Deeble‘s\nbody, X-rays, and microscopic slides of organ tissues, generated as part of the\nautopsy.\n\n               b. Analysis\n\n                    1) Asserted Confrontation Clause Violation\n     The Attorney General asserts that defendant has forfeited his confrontation\nclause claim because he failed to object on this ground at trial. We recently\nrejected a similar forfeiture claim, and for similar reasons do so again here.\n(People v.

In Dungo, neither the autopsy report nor its accompanying\nphotographs were admitted into evidence. (Id. at p. 612.) We therefore concluded\nwe need not decide whether the entire report was testimonial, but could focus on\nthe testimonial nature of particular statements in the report, as described by the\ntestifying pathologist. (Id. at pp. 618-619.)\n     We noted in Dungo that ―[a]lthough the high court has not agreed on a\ndefinition of ‗testimonial,‘ testimonial out-of-court statements have two critical\ncomponents. First, to be testimonial the statement must be made with some\ndegree of formality or solemnity. Second, the statement is testimonial only if its\nprimary purpose pertains in some fashion to a criminal prosecution.‖ (Dungo,\nsupra, 55 Cal.4th at p. 619.)\n     Applying these standards to the autopsy evidence in Dungo, we noted that\nautopsy reports typically contain two types of statements, those that ―describ[e]\nthe [autopsy] pathologist‘s anatomical and physiological observations about the\ncondition of the body,‖ and those that ―set[ ] forth the [autopsy] pathologist‘s\nconclusions as to the cause of the victim‘s death.‖ (Dungo, supra, 55 Cal.4th at p.\n619.) The testifying pathologist in Dungo, we stressed, had described only\nautopsy statements in the first category, and had then supplied, on the basis of\nthose statements and his own examination of autopsy photos, his independent\nforensic opinions about the cause of the victim‘s death. (Id. at pp. 618-619.) He\nhad not described the conclusions in the autopsy report as to the cause of death.\nThus, we had no occasion to ―determine whether such testimony, if it had been\n\n\n\n                                         52\n\fgiven, would have violated defendant‘s right to confront‖ the autopsy\npathologist.12 (Id. at p. 619.)\n     Autopsy statements that simply record anatomical and physiological\nobservations, we indicated, are ―less formal‖ than statements of the autopsy\nphysician‘s expert forensic conclusion as to the cause of death. (Dungo, supra,\n55 Cal.4th at p. 619.) Statements in the former category, we observed, are\n―comparable to observations of objective fact in a report by a physician who, after\nexamining a patient, diagnoses a particular injury or ailment and determines the\nappropriate treatment. Such observations are not testimonial in nature.\n[Citation.]‖ (Id. at pp. 619-620.) A majority in Dungo further pointed out that the\nautopsy statements at issue were neither sworn nor certified for accuracy, and for\nthis additional reason they ―lacked the solemnity and formality that characterize\nstatements the high court deems testimonial.‖ (Id. at p. 623 (conc. opn. of\nWerdegar, J.).)\n     We also found the anatomical observations in the Dungo autopsy report to be\nnontestimonial under the ―primary purpose‖ test. (Dungo, supra, 55 Cal.4th at\np. 621, italics omitted.) We noted that California statutes require an autopsy in\ncertain types of death, only some of which are related to suspected criminal\nactivity. (Id. at p. 620.) Regardless of the circumstances, we explained, ―the\nscope of the coroner‘s statutory duty to investigate is the same‖ (ibid.), and the\nreport serves both forensic and nonforensic uses (id. at pp. 620-621). Hence, we\nconcluded, ―criminal investigation was not the primary purpose for the . . .\nreport‘s description of the condition of [the victim‘s] body; it was only one of\n\n12 Thus, although the concurring and dissenting opinion states that ―[t]here is no\ndebate that admission of testimony as to medical conclusions reached by a\nnontestifying expert would violate the confrontation clause,‖ we have never\ndecided this issue. (Conc. & dis. opn. of Corrigan, J., post, at p. 2.)\n\n\n                                         53\n\fseveral purposes.‖ (Id. at p. 621.) We pointed out that the report itself was, in\nessence, ―simply an official explanation of an unusual death, and such official\nrecords are ordinarily not testimonial. [Citation.]‖ (Ibid.)\n     Here, as in Dungo, Dr. Fukumoto recounted objective medical observations\nderived from Dr. Richards‘s autopsy report and its accompanying photographs,\nmicroscopic slides, and X-rays, and expressed opinions based on those\nobservations. Defendant implicitly concedes any confrontation clause challenge to\nthis portion of Dr. Fukumoto‘s testimony is foreclosed by Dungo, and offers no\npersuasive reason for us to revisit our conclusion in that case.13\n     Defendant contends, however, that his rights under the confrontation clause\nwere violated when Dr. Fukumoto recounted forensic opinions expressed by\nDr. Richards in the autopsy report. At the guilt phase Dr. Fukumoto opined that\nthe cause of Deeble‘s death was ―asphyxiation due to ligature strangulation,‖ and\nagreed with the prosecutor that this was consistent with Dr. Richards‘s opinion.\nDr. Fukumoto also agreed with the prosecutor that an autopsy photograph\nappeared to show ligature marks on Deeble‘s ankles (Deeble‘s legs were not\nbound when her body was discovered), and said that Dr. Richards described\nnearby lacerations on the right ankle also visible in the photograph ―as being\ncaused by the wires probably coming together and inflicting the injury.‖ The\nprosecutor asked if Dr. Fukumoto ―personally disagree[d] with that at all,‖ and Dr.\nFukumoto replied: ―No. It is consistent with that.‖ At the second penalty phase,\nDr. Fukumoto again opined that Deeble ―died as a result of asphyxiation due to a\n\n\n13 The author of the concurring and dissenting opinion, who also dissented in\nDungo, 55 Cal.4th at pages 633-649 (dis. opn. of Corrigan, J.), continues to urge\nhere that Dungo was wrongly decided. (Conc. & dis. opn. of Corrigan, J., post, at\npp. 1, 5, 10.) As indicated above, we are not persuaded to reconsider that recent\ncase.\n\n\n                                         54\n\fligature strangulation,‖ and agreed with the prosecutor this was consistent with Dr.\nRichards‘s opinion and that Dr. Fukumoto had formed his opinion independently.\n     Thus, even assuming these statements violated the confrontation clause, an\nissue we need not decide, no prejudice was possible under any standard. As can\nbe seen, Dr. Fukumoto independently agreed with Dr. Richards‘s opinions, and\nneither the cause of death nor the source of the lacerations on Deeble‘s ankle was\nin dispute at trial.14\n     Defendant contends that at the guilt phase Dr. Fukumoto also erroneously\nrecounted Dr. Richards‘s ―opinions‖ that the injury to Deeble‘s left ear was\n―incisional,‖ residue from adhesive tape was observed in an area from the mouth\nto the lower cheek, and Deeble‘s nose was fractured, and at the second penalty\nphase made similar statements regarding Dr. Richards‘s opinions of injury to\nDeeble‘s ear and the presence of adhesive tape. This testimony by Dr. Fukumoto\ndid not, however, recount Dr. Richards‘s forensic opinions as to the cause of\nDeeble‘s injury or death, but rather his medical observations of objective fact.\nThat a break appears ―incisional,‖ a nose appears to be broken, or residue appears\n\n14  The concurring and dissenting opinion asserts that Dr. Fukumoto also testified\nregarding Dr. Richards‘s forensic opinion that Deeble ―had suffered an incisional\ntear in her left eardrum, suggesting it had been caused by a sharp instrument.‖\n(Conc. & dis. opn. of Corrigan, J., post, at pp. 2-3, underlining in original.) In\nfact, Dr. Fukumoto testified that Dr. Richards had described ―a break on the left\near drum . . . as incisional in type.‖ Dr. Fukumoto then explained: ―[A]n incision\nto a forensic pathologist . . . . is not a tear. It is something that is caused by a sharp\ninstrument or an instrument that has a point.‖\n\nThe concurring and dissenting opinion suggests generally that Dungo’s distinction\nbetween an autopsy examiner‘s medical observations and the examiner‘s forensic\nconclusions is too indistinct to be workable. (Conc. & dis. opn. of Corrigan, J.,\npost, at pp. 1-2, 10.) For the reasons stated in Dungo, and demonstrated here, we\ndisagree.\n\n\n\n\n                                           55\n\fto be from adhesive tape, are expert medical observations of the body‘s condition\n– assessments like those a doctor would make to determine the proper treatment of\na live patient. (See Dungo, supra, 55 Cal.4th at p. 619.) Such testimony was no\ndifferent than, for example, Dr. Fukumoto‘s testimony regarding statements in the\nautopsy report that Deeble‘s stomach contained food that was virtually untouched\nby digestion, and that there was bruising and tearing just inside the opening to the\nvagina. Moreover, Dr. Fukumoto independently reviewed X-rays of Deeble‘s\nnose and testified that one X-ray showed ―somewhat flattening‖ that ―may reflect\nfracturing at the bridge of [the] nose,‖ and Dwight Reed, who attended the\nautopsy, testified that during the autopsy white adhesive material was observed on\nDeeble‘s left cheek.\n\n                    2) Claim Dr. Fukumoto’s testimony lacked foundation and\n                       was unduly prejudicial\n     Defendant contends that even if Dr. Fukumoto‘s testimony was not wholly\ninadmissible, his opinions that Deeble‘s injuries were extremely painful and\noccurred before death lacked foundation, were irrelevant, and were unduly\nprejudicial. (Evid. Code, §§ 352, 801.) This claim lacks merit.\n     Dr. Fukumoto opined that the ligature and struggling against it, the incisional\ninjury to Deeble‘s ear, and an amount of pressure sufficient to tear the ear drums\nwould all be extremely painful. He also agreed with the prosecutor that trauma to\nthe vaginal and rectal areas is ―highly painful,‖ and opined that the injuries to the\nvaginal and rectal areas occurred before death.\n     Adequate foundation for Dr. Fukumoto‘s opinions was provided by\nDr. Richards‘s autopsy report, photographs, and slides, as well as Dr. Fukumoto‘s\nmore than 30 years‘ experience as a forensic pathologist.

Contrary to defendant‘s assertion, Dr.\nFukumoto was not required to be the pathologist who performed the autopsy or\npossess a neurology background in order to testify regarding the painfulness of\nDeeble‘s injuries. Moreover, the jury was instructed that it was not bound to\naccept Dr. Fukumoto‘s opinions as conclusive, but was free to determine the\nweight to which they were entitled and to disregard the opinions if the jury found\nthem to be unreasonable. (§ 1127b.)\n     Defendant contends that Dr. Fukumoto‘s testimony was irrelevant because\nthe jury could draw its own conclusions about the painfulness of Deeble‘s injuries,\nand received ―no appreciable help from Dr. Fukumoto‘s opinion testimony.‖ He\ndid not object on this ground below, and the claim is therefore forfeited.\n(Williams, supra, 16 Cal.3d at p. 667, fn. 4 [―It is the general rule, of course, that\nquestions relating to the admissibility of evidence will not be reviewed on appeal\nabsent a specific and timely objection at trial on the ground sought to be urged on\nappeal.‖].) It also lacks merit. ―Evidence Code section 801 qualifies a matter as\nthe proper subject for expert testimony if it is ‗sufficiently beyond common\nexperience that the opinion of an expert would assist the trier of fact.‘ That is not\nto say, however, that the jury need be wholly ignorant of the subject matter of the\nexpert opinion in order for it to be admissible.

(Williams,\nsupra, 16 Cal.3d at p. 667, fn. 4.) They are also meritless. As delineated below,\nDr. Fukumoto‘s opinions were highly probative on the issues of identity, torture\nmurder, and the torture-murder special-circumstance, as well as burglary murder\nand the burglary-murder special-circumstance based on entry with intent to\npenetrate with a foreign object. (See post, at pts. II.B.3., II.B.4., II.B.5.)\nDefendant does not even attempt to demonstrate how their admission\n―necessitate[d] undue consumption of time‖ or ―create[d] [a] substantial danger of\nundue prejudice, of confusing the issues, or of misleading the jury.‖ (Evid. Code,\n§ 352.)\n\n           3. Admission of evidence regarding Muriel Delbecq’s murder\n     Defendant contends the trial court erred in admitting evidence about\nDelbecq‘s murder on the issues of identity, common plan, and intent in violation\nof Evidence Code sections 352 and 110115 and his rights under the Fifth, Eighth,\n\n\n15 Evidence Code section 1101 provides:\n       ―(a) Except as provided in this section and in [other sections], evidence of\na person‘s character or a trait of his or her character (whether in the form of an\nopinion, evidence of reputation, or evidence of specific instances of his or her\nconduct) is inadmissible when offered to prove his or her conduct on a specified\noccasion.\n       ―(b) Nothing in this section prohibits the admission of evidence that a\nperson committed a crime, civil wrong, or other act when relevant to prove some\n\n\n                                           58\n\fand Fourteenth Amendments to the federal Constitution.

It also excluded evidence\nthat both Deeble and Delbecq were real estate agents because Delbecq did not\nengage in that occupation when she visited Hawaii, and there was no evidence that\ndefendant knew her occupation in Alaska. Finally, the court ruled that evidence\nDelbecq‘s pubic hair was cut would not be admissible absent a further showing of\nrelevance.\n      ―Subdivision (a) of [Evidence Code] section 1101prohibits admission of\nevidence of a person‘s character, including evidence of character in the form of\nspecific instances of uncharged misconduct, to prove the conduct of that person on\na specified occasion. Subdivision (b) of section 1101 clarifies, however, that this\nrule does not prohibit admission of evidence of uncharged misconduct when such\nevidence is relevant to establish some fact other than the person‘s character or\ndisposition,‖ such as identity, common plan, or intent.

At the time the court ruled before trial,\nit was informed that there was evidence both Deeble and Delbecq were older17\nCaucasian women who lived alone on the first floor of an apartment building.\nDelbecq was murdered at night, and there was evidence Deeble was also murdered\nat night given that when her body was discovered she was wearing a nightgown.\nThe cause of death for both women was strangulation. Delbecq had been\n\n\n17 In his trial brief regarding this issue, the prosecutor asserted that Deeble was 55\nyears old at the time of her death.\n\n\n                                          61\n\fpenetrated by a mousse can, and the evidence strongly suggested Deeble had been\npenetrated by a mousse can of similar diameter and length. It appeared that both\npenetrations occurred while the victims were alive. Both women also suffered\nbroken noses and ligature marks on their wrists and ankles consistent with being\nbound by telephone cord. Defendant knew Deeble, and his bloody palm prints\nwere found at the Delbecq murder scene. Both victims were found in their\nransacked bedrooms, and had jewelry taken, and the prosecutor asserted entry into\nboth homes was made by removing a window screen. Substantially similar\nevidence was presented at trial.\n     Thus, at the time the Hawaii evidence was admitted, the trial court was aware\nof numerous similarities between the Deeble and Delbecq murders. Most notably,\nmousse cans of similar diameter and length were present at both crime scenes, and\nthere was evidence both victims had been sexually penetrated by the mousse cans.\nMoreover, ―[t]o be highly distinctive, the charged and uncharged crimes need not\nbe mirror images of each other.‖ (People v. Carter (2005) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2629957\"><a href=\"/opinion/2629957/people-v-carter/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1114</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1148.)\nRather, dissimilarities between the crimes ―went to the weight of the evidence and\ndid not preclude the prosecution from introducing the evidence‖ regarding\nDelbecq‘s murder. (Ibid.)\n     The evidence of Delbecq‘s murder was also relevant to prove a common\ndesign or plan. ―To establish the existence of a common design or plan, the\ncommon features must indicate the existence of a plan rather than a series of\nsimilar spontaneous acts, but the plan thus revealed need not be distinctive or\nunusual‖; rather it ―need only exist to support the inference that the defendant\nemployed that plan in committing the charged offense.‖ (Ewoldt, supra, 7 Cal,4th\nat p. 403.) Here, the common features noted above indicate that when defendant\ncommitted the charged Deeble offenses and the uncharged Delbecq offenses he\n\n\n\n                                         62\n\fwas acting pursuant to a common design or plan to torture, murder, and rob the\nolder women he had chosen as victims. (Kipp, supra, 18 Cal.4th at p. 371.)\n     The evidence of Delbecq‘s murder was also relevant to prove intent, such as\ndefendant‘s entry with the intent to penetrate with a foreign object or steal as to\nburglary murder, and possession of a willful, deliberate, and premeditated intent to\ninflict extreme and prolonged pain on a person for a sadistic purpose as to torture\nmurder. (Ewoldt, supra, 7 Cal.4th at p. 402.) Here, as set forth above, the\nevidence of Delbecq‘s murder was sufficiently similar to Deeble‘s murder to\nsupport the inference that defendant ― ‗ ―probably harbor[ed] the same intent in\neach instance.‖ ‘ ‖ (Ibid.)\n     For these reasons, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it ruled that\nevidence of the Delbecq murder was sufficiently similar to Deeble‘s murder to\nsupport an inference that defendant committed both murders, and did so pursuant\nto a common design or plan and while harboring the same intent. (Kipp, supra,\n18 Cal.4th at pp. 370-371.)\n     Nor did evidence of Delbecq‘s murder contravene Evidence Code section\n352.18 (Lynch, supra, 50 Cal.4th at p. 757; Ewoldt, supra, 7 Cal.4th at p. 404.)\n―Under Evidence Code section 352, a trial court may exclude otherwise relevant\nevidence when its probative value is substantially outweighed by concerns of\nundue prejudice, confusion, or consumption of time. ‗Evidence is substantially\nmore prejudicial than probative [citation] if, broadly stated, it poses an intolerable\n―risk to the fairness of the proceedings or the reliability of the outcome\n\n\n18  Evidence Code section 352 provides: ―The court in its discretion may exclude\nevidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the probability that\nits admission will (a) necessitate undue consumption of time or (b) create\nsubstantial danger of undue prejudice, of confusing the issues, or of misleading the\njury.‖\n\n\n                                          63\n\f[citation].‖ ‘ ‖ (Riggs, supra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 290.) We conclude no such\nintolerable risk was present here.\n     The tendency of the evidence to show identity, common design or plan, and\nintent, as set forth above, was strong. (See Ewoldt, supra, 7 Cal.4th at p. 404.)\nMoreover, the evidence regarding Delbecq‘s murder was independent of the\nevidence of the charged crimes, involving witnesses and evidence from another\nstate and a decedent who had no connection to Deeble. (Id. at pp. 404-405.)\n     Nor did admission of the evidence of Delbecq‘s murder create a substantial\ndanger of undue prejudice. Although the jury could infer from the presence of\ndefendant‘s palm prints and footprint that defendant had killed Delbecq, it could\nalso infer from his testimony that he had been convicted of her 1993 murder.\nThus, ―the jury was not tempted to convict defendant of the charged offenses,\nregardless of his guilt, in order to assure that he would be punished for‖ any other\nmurder.

In addition, although the\nDelbecq murder involved greater brutality to the victim‘s genital area, the jury\ncould reasonably infer that Deeble‘s genital area was also penetrated by a mousse\ncan while she was alive, and that she suffered an agonizing death as she attempted\nto hold her head up so that she would not be strangled by the ligature. Thus, the\nDelbecq murder was not more inflammatory than the Deeble murder. (Ewoldt,\nsupra, 7 Cal.4th at p. 405.) Moreover, the jury was properly instructed on the\nlimited purposes for which it could consider evidence of Delbecq‘s murder.\n(Kipp, supra, 18 Cal.4th at p. 372.)\n     Defendant contends that ―the key foundational fact‖ that Deeble was\nassaulted with a mousse can was not established at trial, and that the trial court\nerred in failing to exclude evidence Delbecq was penetrated by a mousse can. As\nwe have observed, Dr. Fukumoto testified that Deeble suffered injury to her\nvaginal and rectal areas, and that the mousse can found in her bed was consistent\n\n                                          64\n\fwith an object that could have caused these injuries. In addition, there was\ncircumstantial evidence that Deeble had been penetrated by the mousse can: A\nsubstance that appeared to be blood was present underneath the ridge around the\ntop of the mousse can; this substance gave a positive response to a presumptive\ntest for blood; a cap found on the ground next to Deeble appeared to be one that\ncould fit the mousse can; a substance that appeared to be blood was observed on\nthe cap; and the position of Deeble‘s nightgown, which was pushed up around her\nwaist, the absence of panties, and the apparent semen stain on her thigh indicated a\nsexual assault. Although defendant offered to stipulate that Delbecq was\npenetrated by a mousse can without reference to the concomitant damage to her\nabdomen, ― ‗[t]he general rule is that the prosecution in a criminal case cannot be\ncompelled to accept a stipulation if the effect would be to deprive the state‘s case\nof its persuasiveness and forcefulness.‘ ‖ (People v.

Defendant‘s claim is meritless under either provision. Ewoldt concerned the\ncircumstances under which certain evidence was admissible at trial. It did not\nattach criminality to prior acts that were ―innocent when done,‖ provide for\n―greater punishment‖ of a crime ―than was prescribed at the time of its\ncommission,‖ or ―alter the degree‖ or measure of proof necessary to convict from\nthat which was required at the time the crime was committed.

He also opined that the injuries\nto Deeble‘s vaginal and rectal areas were consistent with penetration by the\nmousse can found on her bed, and that trauma to the vaginal and rectal areas is\n―highly painful.‖ As noted above, there was strong circumstantial evidence that\nDeeble had been penetrated by the mousse can.

When Deeble was found, blood was\nrunning out of her left ear and her mouth, and there was blood around her nose.\nDr. Fukumoto testified that Deeble‘s left eardrum had been cut by a sharp or\npointed instrument, her right ear drum was torn, and she had extensive\nhemorrhaging in her middle ears. He opined, ―if the ear drums are torn, associated\nwith massive bleeding in the middle ears, this could be due to a massive increase\nin pressure as a result of the struggle of the victim in his or her attempt to get a\nbreath.‖ He further testified that all of these injuries would have been extremely\npainful. Moreover, defendant inflicted blunt trauma injury that caused bleeding\nnear Deeble‘s pancreas, an organ located deep within the body, and he also\ninflicted blunt trauma to her head.\n     Although there was no testimony that the injuries other than those to the\ngenital area and the ligature were inflicted before death, there was evidence that\nDeeble had been bound and gagged, and had a hood — which was fashioned from\na pillowcase — placed over her head. As noted above, these circumstances\nsuggest a methodical and prolonged attack rather than an explosion of violence,\nand would be unnecessary measures if, as defendant suggests, the victim had\nalready been rendered senseless by the blow to her head.

(Lynch, supra, 50 Cal.4th at p. 764.)\n     As to entry with the intent to commit penetration with a foreign object,\nDeeble suffered injuries to her vaginal and rectal areas consistent with penetration\nby a mousse can found on her bed, and as recounted above, there was other\ncircumstantial evidence that Deeble had been penetrated by the mousse can. The\njury was also aware that defendant subsequently brutally penetrated Muriel\nDelbecq with a mousse can. The jury could reasonably infer from these\ncircumstances that defendant entered Deeble‘s home with the intent to penetrate\nher with a foreign object.\n     The evidence is also sufficient to support the jury‘s true finding of the\nburglary-murder special-circumstance allegation. ―The felony-murder special\ncircumstance applies to a murder committed while the defendant was engaged in,\nor was an accomplice in the commission of, the attempted commission of, or the\nimmediate flight after committing or attempting to commit, various enumerated\nfelonies, including, as relevant here, burglary.

So if I have this right, you never saw the key,\nand you never saw the rock where she was going to keep it; is that correct?‖\nVentura replied, ―No. We had talked about it, and I told her to be careful about\nwhere she kept it, that it wasn‘t obvious, but — ‖ Defense counsel asked,\n―Ma‘am, so if I have this right, the only thing you know about this as far as the\nobtaining a key or putting it under a rock, that is nothing you ever saw yourself; it\nis just something she stated to you; is that correct?‖ Ventura replied, ―. . . That is\ncorrect.‖ Defense counsel then moved to strike on grounds of hearsay and lack of\npersonal knowledge. The trial court overruled the objection because counsel ―did\nnot object to the question or to the answer when it was given.‖ Defense counsel\ncontinued to question Ventura about the key, establishing that she had never seen\nDelbecq take a key out from under a rock and use it, and that she had no personal\nknowledge whether Delbecq ever hid a key. Defendant subsequently filed, and the\ntrial court denied, a motion to strike Ventura‘s testimony regarding the key.\n     Even assuming the court erred in failing to strike Ventura‘s testimony that\nher mother kept a key outside of the apartment, there was no prejudice under any\nstandard. Ventura‘s testimony was of limited probative value because it was\nabundantly clear she had no personal knowledge whether there was a key outside\nher mother‘s condominium. Moreover, defendant was connected to Delbecq‘s\n\n                                          74\n\fmurder by the far more compelling evidence of his bloody palm prints and\nfootprint in her bedroom. In addition, the possibility that Delbecq had hidden a\nkey outside — as had Deeble — was only one minor of many more significant\nsimilarities between the Delbecq and Deeble murders.\n\n           7) Challenge to impeachment evidence\n     Defendant contends the trial erred in allowing his testimony to be impeached\nby his prior convictions in violation of Evidence Code section 352, and his rights\nunder Fifth, Sixth, Eight and Fourteenth Amendments of the federal Constitution.\nNot so.\n     During cross-examination, the prosecutor asked defendant if on March 10,\n1994 he had been convicted of the murder of Muriel Delbecq in Hawaii. Defense\ncounsel objected, and moved at sidebar to exclude reference to defendant‘s prior\nconvictions. In addition to the murder conviction, the prosecutor asserted, and\ndefendant did not dispute, that defendant had suffered March 1994 convictions for\nkidnapping, sexual assault, robbery, and burglary, 1988 convictions for receiving\nstolen property and vehicle theft, a 1987 conviction for weapon possession, and an\nAugust 1984 vehicle burglary conviction. The prosecutor also sought to ask\ndefendant about the circumstances surrounding prior misdemeanors involving\nmoral turpitude.\n     The trial court ruled that evidence of defendant‘s 1994 convictions for\nmurder and burglary and his 1984 burglary conviction could be admitted. It stated\nthat nothing more than the fact of those convictions could be introduced, and\nexcluded evidence of defendant‘s other convictions. When cross-examination\nresumed, the prosecutor asked defendant if on March 10, 1994 he had been\nconvicted in Hawaii of murder and felony burglary, and in August 1984 he had\n\n\n\n\n                                        75\n\fbeen convicted in California of the felony of second degree burglary. Defendant\nresponded affirmatively.\n     ― ‗[T]he admissibility of any past misconduct for impeachment is limited at\nthe outset by the relevance requirement of moral turpitude.‘ ‖ (People v. Clark\n(2011) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">856</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 931.) Beyond this, the ― ‗trial courts have broad discretion\nto admit or exclude prior convictions for impeachment purposes.‘ ‖ (People v.\nHinton (2006) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2640466\"><a href=\"/opinion/2640466/people-v-hinton/\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">839</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 887 (Hinton).) ―When determining whether to\nadmit a prior conviction for impeachment purposes, the court should consider,\namong other factors, whether it reflects on the witness‘s honesty or veracity,\nwhether it is near or remote in time, whether it is for the same or similar conduct\nas the charged offense, and what effect its admission would have on the\ndefendant‘s decision to testify.‖ (Clark, at p. 931.) The impeaching offense may\npostdate the charged offense. (Hinton, at p. 887.)\n     Here, the trial court did not abuse its discretion. Both murder and burglary\nare crimes involving moral turpitude. (Hinton, supra, 37 Cal.4th at p. 888; People\nv. Collins (1986) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2603494\"><a href=\"/opinion/2603494/people-v-collins/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">378</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 395.) The 1994 murder and burglary convictions\nwere not remote in time to defendant‘s 1996 trial. Nor was defendant‘s 1984\nsecond degree burglary conviction remote, because as the trial court observed,\ndefendant ―has continuously been in and out of trouble‖ based on the convictions\nin 1984, 1987, 1988, and 1994. Defendant had already testified at the point\ncounsel moved to exclude evidence of the prior convictions, so the trial court‘s\nruling had no bearing on that decision.\n     ―Although the similarity between the prior convictions and the charged\noffenses is a factor for the court to consider when balancing probative value\nagainst prejudice, it is not dispositive.‖ (People v. Clark, supra, 52 Cal.4th at\np. 932.) Here, defendant only testified that he had suffered 1994 Hawaii\nconvictions for murder and burglary, not that he had been convicted of murdering\n\n                                          76\n\fand burglarizing Delbecq. Thus, contrary to defendant‘s contention, the\nconvictions did not ―conclusively establish[] his guilt of those crimes.‖ Even if\nthe jury assumed that the 1994 convictions involved Delbecq‘s 1993 murder, it\nhad already properly heard evidence regarding this murder under Evidence Code\nsection 1101, subdivision (b), and the evidence that defendant committed the\nHawaii murder was strong. Moreover, as noted above (see ante, at p. 64), the\ncircumstance that defendant had been convicted of Delbecq‘s murder would serve\nto decrease the prejudice of the Hawaii evidence because ―the jury was not\ntempted to convict defendant of the charged offenses, regardless of his guilt, in\norder to assure that he would be punished for‖ any subsequent murder. (Balcom,\nsupra, 7 Cal.4th at p. 427.)\n     We further reject defendant‘s contention that evidence he ―was guilty of the\nHawaii crimes was the de facto equivalent of a directed verdict on the present\ncharges, relieving the prosecution of its burden of proof and rendering the trial so\nfundamentally unfair as to deny [defendant] due process of law.‖ As noted,\nevidence of defendant‘s guilt of Delbecq‘s murder — properly introduced as\nsubstantive evidence that he also killed Deeble (see ante, at pt. II.B.3.) — was\nstrong. To the extent the jury inferred that his 1994 murder and burglary\nconvictions were for the Delbecq killing, that circumstance operated to decrease,\nnot increase, the prejudice of their introduction for impeachment. Moreover, even\nif the jury found by a preponderance of the evidence that defendant killed\nDelbecq, it was still required to determine if the similarities between the Delbecq\nand Deeble murders were sufficient to conclude defendant committed and\npossessed the requisite intent for the Deeble murder.\n     Defendant similarly contends that although the jury was instructed that it\ncould only use the fact of defendant‘s conviction to assess his credibility, ―it was\nundoubtedly used by the jury to . . . satisfy the prosecution‘s burden to prove\n\n                                         77\n\f[defendant‘s] commission of the Delbecq murder by a preponderance of the\nevidence before it could consider that evidence to establish identity or intent,‖19\nand ―made it even more likely that the jury would ignore the limiting ‗similar acts‘\ninstruction and conclude that since he was convicted of one brutal murder, he must\nalso be guilty of the charged offense.‖ We presume the jury followed the trial\ncourt‘s instructions. (Dement, supra, 53 Cal.4th at p. 36.) Moreover, once again,\nthe evidence of defendant‘s guilt of the Hawaii murder was strong.\n     Defendant contends, relying on People v. Rollo (1977) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1245425\"><a href=\"/opinion/1245425/people-v-rollo/\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">109</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 118,\nthat ― ‗ ―[a]cts of violence . . . generally have little or no direct bearing on honesty\nand veracity.‖ ‘ ‖ However, in 1982, ―section 28, subdivision (f) of article I of the\nCalifornia Constitution . . . was added by Proposition 8, and . . . provides in\npertinent part that ‗[a]ny prior felony conviction . . . shall subsequently be used\nwithout limitation for purposes of impeachment . . . in any criminal proceeding.‘ ‖\n(Hinton, supra, 37 Cal.4th at pp. 887-888.) We subsequently held ― ‗that—always\nsubject to the trial court‘s discretion under [Evidence Code] section 352—\n[Proposition 8] authorizes the use of any felony conviction which necessarily\ninvolves moral turpitude, even if the immoral trait is one other than dishonesty.‘ ‖\n(Id., at p. 888, quoting People v.

The fact of such a conviction does\nnot necessarily destroy or impair a witness‘s believability. It is one of the\ncircumstances that you may take into consideration in weighing the testimony of\nsuch a witness.‖\n\nThe jury was also instructed: ―Certain evidence was admitted for a limited\npurpose. At the time this evidence was admitted you were admonished that it\ncould not be considered by you for any purpose other than the limited purpose for\nwhich it was admitted. Do not consider such evidence for any purpose except the\nlimited purpose for which it was admitted.‖\n\n\n                                           78\n\f     Defendant also contends that the trial court ―failed to engage in the weighing\nprocess required under Evidence Code section 352,‖ and in particular admitted the\nmurder conviction without consideration of all relevant factors, and ―failed to\nconsider the availability for impeachment of other felony convictions that were\ndissimilar to the murder charge and were more probative on the issue of\n[defendant‘s] credibility.‖ ― ‗[A] court need not expressly weigh prejudice against\nprobative value or even expressly state that it has done so, if the record as a whole\nshows the court was aware of and performed its balancing function under\nEvidence Code section 352.‘ ‖ (People v.

It also precluded evidence regarding\ndefendant‘s misdemeanor convictions, observing that such evidence did not\n―prove that much and tends to take too much time and could end up confusing the\njury.‖\n     As to the prior murder conviction, the court stated it was a ―crime of . . . the\nworst type of moral turpitude,‖ and ―[h]ighly relevant on credibility.‖ Although\nthe Hawaii murder conviction was ―an identical crime,‖ the court stated that factor\nwas offset by the admission of the evidence under Evidence Code section 1101,\nsubdivision (b), and the strength of the evidence implicating defendant in the\nHawaii murder. The trial court was not required to further articulate all of its\nconsiderations, such as the availability for impeachment of other prior felony\nconvictions that were dissimilar to the murder charge, before admitting evidence\nof the murder conviction.\n\n\n\n\n                                          79\n\f           8. Assertedly erroneous exclusion of exculpatory evidence\n     Defendant contends the trial court erred in excluding certain exculpatory\nevidence in violation of his rights under the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth\nAmendments of the federal Constitution, and article I, sections 7 and 15 of the\nstate Constitution. We conclude there was no prejudicial error.\n\n               a. Dr. Wolf’s testimony\n     Defendant first contends that the trial court erred in precluding defense expert\nwitness Dr. Wolf from answering a line of questions regarding whether Deeble‘s\ninjuries were consistent with consensual sexual intercourse after it allowed the\nprosecution‘s expert, Dr. Fukumoto, to opine that the mousse can found on\nDeeble‘s bed was consistent with an object that could have caused these injuries.\nEven assuming the trial court erred in precluding this line of testimony, there was\nno prejudice under any standard. Dr. Wolf described the injuries to Deeble‘s\nvagina and rectum as ―[e]xtremely minor,‖ and opined they could have been\ncaused by a finger or a penis. He agreed with defense counsel that ―taking all the\nreferences to the vaginal mucosa, labia and fourchette together, all of these can be\naptly characterized by a pathologist as being trivial and merely consistent with\nsexual intercourse.‖ He also testified that Deeble‘s vaginal mucosa was thin\nbecause she was menopausal, and that when the mucosa is thin, any kind of\nmanipulation by a finger, penis, or other foreign object is more likely to cause\nmicroscopic lacerations. He further testified that 60 percent of women who have\nconsensual sex, and 30 percent of women who suffer sexual assault, can have\nmicroscopic injury to the vagina. In addition, on cross-examination,\nDr. Fukumoto opined that the dilation of the anus could have been caused by a\nfinger, penis, or any number of other objects.\n\n\n\n\n                                         80\n\f               b. Evidence that defendant suffered from blackouts\n     Defendant contends that the trial court erred in excluding testimony by Victor\nPortillo and Janice Hunt that that ―could have circumstantially corroborated\n[defendant‘s] defense that he was in an unconscious state at the time of the\n[Deeble] murder.‖ Portillo, defendant‘s cousin, lived on Maui for a month in\n1991-1992. One night he, defendant, and defendant‘s girlfriend Brenda drank\nheavily. They got into a vehicle with defendant driving and Brenda in the\npassenger seat. Brenda and defendant argued, and Brenda hit defendant several\ntimes. Defendant did not hit her back, but blocked her hits to maintain control of\nthe vehicle. The following day, defendant did not appear to be upset with Brenda\nover her behavior the night before. Portillo mentioned the incident to defendant.\nWhen defense counsel asked if defendant had replied ―that he did not recall any of\nit,‖ the prosecutor objected on hearsay grounds. Defense counsel asserted it was\nnot hearsay, but circumstantial evidence of an alcoholic blackout‖ and cited\nEvidence Code section 1250. The prosecutor responded that there was no\n―foundation that ties into any kind of blackout,‖ and the trial court sustained the\nobjection.\n     Janice Hunt testified that she lived with defendant in Hawaii. In December\n1992, defendant drank heavily, and at times became so intoxicated he had\nalcoholic blackouts. Hunt described two incidents, one when defendant left in his\nwork truck at night, and the next morning she and defendant searched for the\ntruck, and another when he apparently left a bag of groceries outside all night.\nAfter Hunt described the latter incident, defense counsel asked, ―Did you tell\n[defendant] that you had found these things down there?‖ Hunt replied, ―Yes.‖\nCounsel asked, ―And what was his response?‖ The prosecutor objected on\nhearsay grounds, and defense counsel responded it was not offered for the truth,\nbut for ―state of mind.‖ The trial court sustained the objection. Hunt then testified\n\n\n                                         81\n\fthat defendant appeared surprised when she showed him the items. Counsel made\nno offer of proof as to how Hunt would respond to the objected-to question, but\nhere assumes she would have said whether defendant ―recalled certain actions\nafter drinking.‖\n     Even assuming the evidence defendant sought to elicit from Portillo and\nHunt was admissible to show defendant‘s state of mind, state of mind evidence\nmust nonetheless be relevant. It is not apparent how defendant‘s state of mind in\n1991 or 1992 had any bearing on his mental state in May of 1986 when Deeble\nwas killed. (Evid. Code, § 350.) Moreover, even assuming the trial court erred in\nsustaining the prosecutor‘s objections to this testimony, there was no possible\nprejudice. Both defendant and Hunt testified that defendant suffered from\nalcoholic blackouts, and Dr. Stalcup testified that anyone who drinks enough can\nhave an alcoholic blackout.\n     Moreover, contrary to defendant‘s claim, the prosecutor did not argue that\nthere was no corroboration of defendant‘s claim he suffered blackouts, and thus\nask the jury to convict defendant because he failed to present evidence that was\nexcluded by the prosecutor‘s objection. Rather, the prosecutor asserted that the\ncircumstances of the murder were inconsistent with a perpetrator experiencing a\nblackout, and that defendant was the only person who actually knew if he had\nexperienced a blackout. Thus, the prosecutor observed that Dr. Stalcup had not\ninterviewed defendant, and stated ―[S]o the only words you have, the only person\nthat knows whether or not they had a blackout was [defendant]. And you are back\nto that same issue, why do you believe [defendant]? Why do you believe a wise,\nconvicted burglar and a convicted murderer? . . . And even if you did believe him,\nwhat does it matter? Since even if you are in a blackout, even if you are under the\ninfluence of these drugs, it doesn‘t take away responsibility?‖ The prosecutor\nargued that ―if there was a blackout,‖ the jury still had to decide whether there is\n\n                                          82\n\f―evidence that shows . . . he has formed the intent to kill, that he tortured, et\ncetera.‖ He noted: ―There had to be so much more decisions made. There had to\nbe so much more things done that a drunk who . . . is stumbling and bumbling\ncan‘t do‖ such as finding a key, pulling off a screen, taking control of the victims,\nputting a comforter over the window, cutting cords, finding mousse cans, and\nbinding and penetrating the victims. ―And that is why he isn‘t in a blackout . . .\n[d]espite what he tells us.‖ ―[I]t is too thought out, too planned.‖\n\n                c. Evidence that Valentine stole Deeble’s jewelry\n     Defendant contends that the trial court erred in excluding testimony about\ncertain statements by Paul Roy, who dated Deeble sometime after August 1985.\nRoy was a reluctant witness, and the parties agreed that Sergeant Jessen and\nRobert Courtney, the senior investigator for the Orange County Public Defender‘s\nOffice, could testify as to his statements to them. Before Jessen and Courtney\ntestified, defense counsel made an offer of proof as to what testimony he\nanticipated, and the prosecutor lodged objections. As relevant here, counsel\nasserted, ―[I]n relation to her state of mind near in time to her demise, Marge\nDeeble told Mr. Roy that Kathy [Valentine] would come into the apartment\nsometimes when Marge was not there and would take things out of the apartment\nwhich would upset the victim quite a bit.‖ Counsel also asserted, ―Again, as to her\nframe of mind near in time to her demise, she also told Mr. Roy that — or his\nimpression, he feels that the victim finally removed the key from its hiding place\nin the drain pipe so that the kids could not get into the house while she was gone.‖\n     The prosecutor objected to admission of these statements. He stated that he\ndid not ―see those statements anywhere,‖ but assuming they existed, he objected\non the grounds they were hearsay and irrelevant. Defense counsel responded that\nthe statements reflected an alternate explanation for Deeble‘s missing jewelry, and\n\n\n\n                                           83\n\fwere relevant to Kathryn Valentine‘s credibility as a witness. The prosecutor\nobserved that defendant had never asked Valentine on cross-examination if she\ntook any jewelry. The trial court sustained the objection. It also told counsel he\ncould still put Roy on the stand and ask him questions, and said that whether Roy\ntestified was a tactical decision for counsel to make. Counsel did not re-call Roy.\n     On appeal, defendant contends that Roy‘s ―impression‖ that Deeble removed\nthe key from its hiding place was admissible as a lay opinion under Evidence Code\nsection 800. He did not assert this ground below, and the claim is therefore\nforfeited. It is also meritless. The opinion was wholly speculative, not\n―[r]ationally based on the perception of the witness.‖ (Evid. Code, § 800.)\n     Defendant also contends that Deeble‘s statements to Roy fell into the hearsay\nexception for state of mind evidence. (Evid. Code, § 1250.) He did not assert this\nground below, and the claim is therefore forfeited. It is also meritless. The second\noffer of proof clearly had nothing to do with Deeble‘s state of mind, but merely\nconsisted of Roy‘s unfounded speculation. The first offer of proof was proffered\nnot to show Deeble‘s state of mind, but to demonstrate that Valentine had taken\nitems from Deeble‘s apartment without her permission. As defendant asserts here,\nit was evidence that ―Valentine, and not [defendant], stole Mrs. Deeble‘s jewelry.‖\nThe trial court therefore properly sustained the prosecutor‘s hearsay objection.\nMoreover, even if the first offer of proof could be characterized as evidence of\nDeeble‘s state of mind, nothing in counsel‘s offer indicated when before her death\nDeeble made the statement. Nor, even assuming the statement was made around\nthe time of her death, was Deeble‘s state of mind toward her daughter relevant to\nany issue at trial.\n     Defendant further contends that the first offer of proof fell within the\nexception to the hearsay rule for declarations against interest. (Evid. Code,\n§ 1230.) Nothing in Deeble‘s statement to Roy about her daughter ―created such a\n\n                                         84\n\frisk of making [her] an object of hatred, ridicule, or social disgrace in the\ncommunity, that a reasonable [person] in [her] position would not have made the\nstatement unless [she] believed it to be true.‖ (Ibid.)\n     Defendant further contends that the trial court failed to ―weigh the prejudice\nof excluding [the] testimony compared to its probative value.‖ The proffered\ntestimony was inadmissible hearsay and irrelevant. The trial court had no\nobligation to engage in any weighing process.\n     Finally, defendant summarily contends that even if the testimony was\nproperly excluded under the Evidence Code, it ―should have been admitted\npursuant to [defendant‘s] constitutional right to present a defense.‖ As ― ‗a\ngeneral matter, the ordinary rules of evidence do not impermissibly infringe on the\naccused‘s right to present a defense.‘ ‖ (Dement, supra, 53 Cal.4th at p. 52.)\nDefendant makes no effort to delineate why any exception would apply here.\n\n                d. Evidence regarding defendant’s reaction to news of Deeble’s\n                   death\n     During defendant‘s testimony, he recounted that when he learned of Deeble‘s\ndeath, he and Valentine were visiting his aunt and uncle. Valentine was told she\nhad to go to the Los Alamitos Police Department because something had happened\nto her mother. Valentine and defendant drove to the police station. Defendant\nwaited in the lobby, and after a few minutes he heard Valentine crying. Valentine\nthen came out and told defendant Valentine‘s mother had died. Counsel asked if\ndefendant remembered what Valentine had told him, and the prosecutor objected\non grounds of hearsay and relevance. Counsel asserted the evidence went to ―state\nof mind.‖ The trial court sustained the objection. Counsel then asked defendant if\nhe was ―concerned at all about being at the Los Alamitos Police Department with\n[Valentine] on that date?‖ The trial court sustained the prosecutor‘s relevance\nobjection. Counsel then asked, ―When you left your aunt‘s residence to drive\n\n\n                                          85\n\f[Valentine] to the Los Alamitos Police Department, what were you thinking?‖\nThe trial court again sustained the prosecutor‘s relevance objection. Counsel then\nasked, ―Did you have any fear about going to the Los Alamitos Police Department\nwith her?‖ Defendant answered, ―No, sir.‖\n     On appeal, defendant contends Valentine‘s statement to defendant was\noffered to explain defendant‘s reaction to news of the murder, which was ―a\nrelevant circumstance for the evaluation of guilt.‖ Defendant had already testified\nthat Valentine told him her mother had died; her exact words were irrelevant.\nDefendant was not asked about, and made no offer of proof regarding, what he\nsaid or did in response to her news. We therefore have no basis on which to\nevaluate the admissibility of evidence of his reaction.\n     Defendant further contends that his ―innocent state of mind as he was driving\nto the police station‖ was also ―a relevant circumstance for the evaluation of\nguilt.‖ Even assuming the trial court erred in sustaining the prosecutor‘s relevance\nobjections, there was no prejudice because defendant testified he had no fear about\ngoing to the Los Alamitos Police Department with Valentine.\n\n               e. Evidence regarding Steven Deeble’s interest in bondage\n     Defendant sought admission of an envelope addressed to Deeble‘s son\nSteven and an enclosed flier found by Detective Vic Cantu in a trash can in the\nsecond bedroom in Deeble‘s apartment. On the flier were photographs of a\nwoman in bondage and of Charles Manson, and several articles, including an\narticle about a bondage murder. The trial court sustained the prosecutor‘s\nobjection, stating that if the evidence was offered to show that Steven Deeble\ncould have been the perpetrator, ―you don‘t cross the threshold,‖ the article on\nbondage was not ―even remotely similar to the evidence in this case,‖ and the\nevidence was ―confusing‖ and not helpful to the defense.\n\n\n\n                                         86\n\f     ― ‗[T]o be admissible, evidence of the culpability of a third party offered by a\ndefendant to demonstrate that a reasonable doubt exists concerning his or her guilt,\nmust link the third person either directly or circumstantially to the actual\nperpetration of the crime. In assessing an offer of proof relating to such evidence,\nthe court must decide whether the evidence could raise a reasonable doubt as to\ndefendant‘s guilt and whether it is substantially more prejudicial than probative\nunder Evidence Code section 352.‘ ‖ (People v. McWhorter (2009) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2590326\"><a href=\"/opinion/2590326/people-v-mcwhorter/\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span>\n<span class=\"page\">318</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 367-368.) Even assuming Steven Deeble ever saw the flier, defendant failed\nto demonstrate any link between the article and Deeble‘s murder, or that the\nevidence could raise a reasonable doubt as to defendant‘s guilt. Hence the trial\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in excluding the evidence.\n\n                f.   Cumulative Impact\n     Defendant contends that even if we determine none of the errors in excluding\nexculpatory evidence warrant reversal, the cumulative impact of these errors does.\nWe have found no error in excluding any of the evidence, and where we have\nassumed error, we have found no prejudice. Nor do we discern cumulative\nprejudice.\n\n             9. Challenge to Sergeant Jessen’s rebuttal testimony\n     Defendant contends that Sergeant Jessen‘s rebuttal testimony lacked\nfoundation and violated his rights under the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth\nAmendments to the federal Constitution.20 We disagree.\n\n\n\n\n20 Defendant also makes related claims of prosecutorial misconduct and\ninstructional error based on Sergeant Jessen‘s rebuttal testimony. (See post, at\npts. II.B.10, II.B.12.)\n\n\n                                          87\n\f               a. Factual background\n     During the prosecution‘s case-in-chief, no DNA evidence was introduced,\nnor was any other evidence introduced demonstrating that suspects other than\ndefendant had been eliminated by scientific evidence as donors of possible bodily\nfluids at the crime scene. The prosecution introduced evidence that inside\nDeeble‘s thigh was a stain that could have been dried semen. No evidence was\nintroduced that the stain was subsequently tested and determined to be semen.\n     During the defense case, defendant presented evidence that none of the\nfingerprints lifted from Deeble‘s apartment matched his. He also presented\ntestimony from Richard Brown, a criminalist with the Orange County Sheriff‘s\nOffice crime lab, that comparison of defendant‘s pubic hair to pubic hair found at\nthe crime scene eliminated defendant as a source of the crime scene hair. Brown\nwas unable to compare the crime scene hair to that of seven men other than\ndefendant because the hair standards submitted for those individuals contained too\nfew hairs to make a comparison. He sent a report to the Los Alamitos Police\nDepartment stating that the hair standards were inadequate. He was never\nprovided with adequate hair samples. In addition, on approximately October 21,\n1987, Sergeant Jessen spoke with Maggie Black of the Orange County Sheriff‘s\nOffice crime lab regarding elimination prints. Black was dissatisfied with the\nquality of the prints taken of five individuals other than defendant and said they\nwould have to be redone.\n     On rebuttal, the prosecutor asked Sergeant Jessen if he recalled that during\nthe defense case there was testimony that fingerprint exemplars and hair standards\nwere inadequate and had to be redone, but that new samples were never submitted.\nJessen responded affirmatively. After further colloquy, the prosecutor asked,\n―[Y]ou began to focus on [defendant] to the exclusion of the persons that the\ndefense mentioned, correct?‖ Jessen replied, ―Correct.‖ The court overruled\n\n\n                                         88\n\fdefense counsel‘s relevance objection. The prosecutor asked, ―And one of the\nreasons was, was it not, what has already come out that [defendant] refused to\nsupply you with samples of hair, saliva and blood?‖ Jessen said, ―Correct.‖ The\ncourt again overruled defense counsel‘s relevance objection. The prosecutor\nsubsequently asked, ―Another reason, is it not true that these persons had been\neliminated by DNA from providing the samples at the Deeble residence of semen\nand fluids, and [defendant] had not been eliminated, correct?‖ Defense counsel\nobjected on the grounds of lack of foundation and speculation, and the trial court\nsustained the objection. The prosecutor asked to be heard at sidebar.\n     The prosecutor stated that the defense had ―attacked the police for not\nfollowing through and not doing certain things.‖ He asserted that Sergeant\nJessen‘s testimony ―is only going to state of mind. This officer became aware of\ncertain factors, including the DNA results and this is a reason why they didn‘t\ncontinue because these other people had been eliminated. So it is not being\noffered for the truth of the matter. It is being offered to rebut by his state of mind\nwhat the defense is trying to show.‖\n     Defense counsel responded that the testimony was hearsay and speculation in\nthat Sergeant Jessen had ―no basis to form the opinion as to whether these people\nwere eliminated by DNA in the first place. And the second place, it is not true,\nand we can‘t . . . have a mini trial on evidence that was never noticed by the\nprosecution as being part of their case . . . . [N]either side has used DNA in this\ntrial because [the prosecutor] represented before the trial that he was not going to\nput it on. Therefore, we had no [Evidence Code section] 402 [evidentiary\nhearing]. We did not prepare to rebut it because he was never going to use it.‖\nDefense counsel also observed that rebuttal was ―limited to new matter brought up\nby the defense,‖ and the defense case had not referred to DNA evidence. Hence,\nhe argued that even if Jessen ―had the foundation to talk about DNA, even if he\n\n                                          89\n\fhad done the tests, it would be impermissible rebuttal.‖ He moved for a mistrial\n―based upon prosecutorial misconduct in bringing‖ inflammatory and untrue\nevidence ―out in rebuttal.‖ The prosecutor responded: ―It is not being offered for\nthe truth. It is being offered for his state of mind to show he didn‘t do a crappy\njob.‖\n        The trial court denied the mistrial motion, told the prosecutor to avoid the\nterm ―DNA‖ unless he put on the evidence, and said that Sergeant Jessen could\ntestify that in his mind the other persons were eliminated as suspects. The\nprosecutor then inquired whether he could ask Jessen if ―these other persons were\neliminated‖ by ―scientific testing.‖ Defense counsel subsequently responded:\n―[T]his is bringing stuff in through the back door that was never presented in\nevidence. He never even verified that the darn stain was semen. . . .We‘re far off\ninto the realm of speculation, and for stuff that is so inflammatory . . . . [T]he jury\nshould not be allowed to hear it without an adequate foundation.‖ The prosecutor\nasserted that defense counsel was correct ―if it is being offered as substantive\nevidence. It is not.‖ Defense counsel responded : ―[T]he proper witnesses for\nthis are the scientists. He is not the appropriate witness for this information. He is\nnot even an expert who can bring it in as hearsay.‖ The trial court noted that the\nother suspects were not eliminated by the DNA evidence, ―[T]hey are just not tied\ninto a semen stain. He therefore ordered the prosecutor not to use the word\n―DNA.‖\n        Immediately at the end of the sidebar conference, at defendant‘s request, the\ncourt admonished the jury to disregard the reference to DNA: ―Earlier in the trial\nwe told you that certain evidence was being offered for a limited purpose. Well,\nthe last question by the way is stricken. The jury is ordered to disregard it. But\nthese questions of this officer are being offered for a limited purpose, and the\nlimited purpose is this officer‘s state of mind. And what that is relevant to, I think\n\n                                            90\n\fwill become obvious by the questions and by any cross-examination on those\nquestions. The letters ‗DNA‘ were used in the last question. Don‘t assume or\nthink about it. Those letters are stricken. They are meaningless as far as your duty\nis concerned. Is that understood? You can all handle that all right?‖21\n     The prosecutor then asked Sergeant Jessen, ―[I]sn‘t it true that as a result of\nscientific testing that this group of names the defense had mentioned as persons\nwho had supplied inadequate samples that I asked you about before were\neliminated as the donors of the various semen and fluids at the crime scene?‖\nDefense counsel objected on the grounds of lack of foundation and misstating the\ntestimony, and the court told the prosecutor to rephrase the question. The\nprosecutor asked, ―Isn‘t it true that in your mind, based upon information you had\nreceived from other people, lab personnel, that this list of people that the defense\nhad mentioned as people who had provided inadequate samples were eliminated as\ndonors of semen and fluids at the crime scene?‖ The trial court overruled defense\ncounsel‘s foundation objection. Jessen replied, ―Yes.‖ The prosecutor asked,\n―And with that and other information that you had, then you focused on\n[defendant] . . . in your investigation, correct?‖ Defense counsel objected,\n―irrelevant, vague as to time,‖ and the court overruled the objection. Jessen\nanswered, ―Correct.‖ The prosecutor asked, ―But it wasn‘t until you received a\nphone call from Hawaii indicating a homicide that took place over there in 1993\nthat you felt you had enough evidence to actually arrest [defendant], true?‖ Jessen\nreplied, ―Correct.‖ The prosecutor asked no further questions, defendant did not\ncross-examine Jessen, and the jury was excused for the day.\n\n\n21 At the end of the guilt phase, the jury also received the instruction noted above\nthat ―Certain evidence was admitted for a limited purpose.‖ (See ante, at p. 78, fn.\n16.)\n\n\n                                         91\n\f     The following morning, just before the prosecutor‘s closing argument,\ndefense counsel asserted that not only had there never been an evidentiary hearing\nregarding the admissibility of DNA evidence, it appeared that no DNA testing had\nbeen performed. He moved for further admonition because Sergeant Jessen had\ntestified about DNA, the jury was then told to disregard the term DNA, and the\njury was then told further testing was done and Jessen relied on that testing. The\nprosecutor said there ―was DNA testing,‖ but even if defense counsel was ―correct\nand it was other testing,‖ the only question Jessen had answered was regarding\n―scientific testing.‖ The trial court denied the motion for further admonition\nbecause the issue was adequately addressed in the original admonition, and stated,\n―[t]here flat out wasn‘t any [prosecutorial] misconduct.‖\n\n               b. Analysis\n     ―The trial court has broad discretion to determine the admissibility of rebuttal\nevidence and, absent palpable abuse, an appellate court may not disturb the trial\ncourt‘s exercise of that discretion. (People v. Gurule (2002) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">557</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n656.)‖ (People v.

Defendant contends,\nhowever, that the trial court erred in admitting Sergeant Jessen‘s testimony\nbecause it lacked foundation. He is correct that there was no evidence that any\nscientific testing that eliminated suspects other than defendant as the donors of\npossible bodily fluids found at the crime scene was done, that the results of that\ntesting had been communicated by lab personnel to Sergeant Jessen, or that the\nstain on Deeble‘s thigh was dried semen. The purpose of Jessen‘s testimony,\nhowever, was not to establish that these circumstances were true, but to\ndemonstrate why Jessen had not followed up on requests for further hair and\nfingerprint samples. The testimony was admissible for this relevant nonhearsay\npurpose, and constituted proper rebuttal. (People v. McKinnon (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span>\n\n\n\n                                         <span class=\"page\">92</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\f610, 656 [purpose of testimony regarding rumors that fellow gang member had\nbeen killed by a rival gang was not to prove that the rumors were true, but to show\nthe defendant believed what he heard, and thus had reason to kill the victim].)\n     Defendant further contends that the testimony violated the confrontation\nclause. Assuming the claim is preserved, there was no violation of the\nconfrontation clause because Sergeant Jessen did not recount any statements by\nlaboratory personnel. (See Crawford v. Washington, supra, 541 U.S. at pp. 59-60\n[admission of testimonial statements of a witness who was not subject to cross-\nexamination at trial violates a defendant‘s Sixth Amendment right of\nconfrontation].)\n     Defendant contends that ―through a leading question that ha[d] no basis in\nfact, the prosecutor was able to acquaint the jury with ‗the results‘ of forensic\ntesting that identified [defendant] as the only like[ly] perpetrator of the charged\noffense.‖ The court struck the prosecutor‘s first question regarding DNA, and\ninstructed the jury to disregard it, and in particular to disregard the term ―DNA.‖\nIt further instructed the jury that Sergeant Jessen‘s testimony was admitted for the\nlimited purpose of demonstrating his state of mind, and that the jury could not\nconsider evidence that was admitted for a limited purpose ―for any purpose except\nthe . . . purpose for which it was admitted.‖ Moreover, the jury was aware no\nevidence had been introduced regarding such scientific testing, or demonstrating\nthat the stain was semen, and was further aware that the police did not believe they\nhad sufficient evidence to charge defendant with Deeble‘s murder until seven\nyears later when Delbecq was killed.22 Under these circumstances, the trial court\n\n22 In his written proposed supplemental admonition, defendant requested that the\njury be instructed that testing other than DNA testing led Sergeant Jessen to\nbelieve that the seven named individuals ―were not viable suspects in his mind,‖\nand that ―[t]his evidence is not admitted for the truth of the matter as to whether\n\n\n                                          93\n\fdid not abuse its broad discretion to determine the admissibility of rebuttal\nevidence.\n\n             10. Asserted prosecutorial misconduct\n      Defendant contends the prosecutor engaged in misconduct on numerous\noccasions in violation of his rights under the Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth\nAmendments to the federal Constitution, and state law. ―A prosecutor commits\nmisconduct when his or her conduct either infects the trial with such unfairness as\nto render the subsequent conviction a denial of due process, or involves deceptive\nor reprehensible methods employed to persuade the trier of fact.‖ (People v. Avila\n(2009) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2537905\"><a href=\"/opinion/2537905/people-v-avila/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">680</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 711 (Avila).) In evaluating such a claim, we determine\nwhether there is a reasonable likelihood the jury construed the remarks in an\nobjectionable fashion. (People v. Cash (2002) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2588259\"><a href=\"/opinion/2588259/people-v-cash/\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">703</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 733 (Cash).) We\nconclude no prejudicial prosecutorial misconduct occurred.\n\n                   a. Asserted misconduct during examination of witnesses\n      Defendant contends the prosecutor presented misleading evidence when he\nquestioned Sergeant Jessen whether it was true that other suspects had been\neliminated by DNA as donors of semen and other fluids at the murder scene, but\n\n\n\n(footnote continued from previous page)\nthere was other testing or its results,‖ but only ―to explain the officer‘s state of\nmind in not completing hair comparisons of these men with hair from the scene.‖\nSuch instruction would have clarified the purpose of Sergeant Jessen‘s testimony.\nDefendant did not, however, advance this argument during the hearing at which\nthe proposed written instruction was presented, and indeed on appeal does not\nclaim that the trial court erred in not giving this portion of the proposed\nsupplemental instruction. He only asserts that the trial court erred in not\ninstructing the jury with that portion of the proposed admonition which stated that\nSergeant Jessen‘s ―testi[mony]‖ that seven named individuals were eliminated by\nDNA testing was apparently false, and that no DNA testing was performed\nregarding these individuals. (See post, at pt. II.B.12.a.)\n\n\n                                          94\n\fdefendant had not been eliminated. (See ante, at pt. II.B.9.) Defendant‘s\nobjection to the prosecutor‘s question was sustained, and Jessen did not answer the\nquestion. Moreover, the trial court subsequently admonished the jury that the\nquestion was struck, and they were to disregard the term ―DNA.‖ We presume the\njury followed that instruction. (People v. Avila (2006) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2515784\"><a href=\"/opinion/2515784/people-v-avila/\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">491</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 574.)\nUnder these circumstances, even assuming the prosecutor committed misconduct\nby asking the question, no prejudice was possible under any standard. (People v.\nPinholster (1992) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1203248\"><a href=\"/opinion/1203248/people-v-pinholster/\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">865</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 943 [no prejudice since the defense objection was\nsustained, the court directed there be no further reference to the subject matter, the\nwitness did not answer the question, and the jury was instructed to disregard the\nquestion].)\n     Defendant further contends that the prosecutor repeatedly ignored court\nrulings by referring to inadmissible and inflammatory matters in front of the jury.\nIn particular, he asserts that the prosecutor repeatedly and improperly denigrated\nDr. Wolf on cross-examination. In the challenged exchange, the prosecutor asked,\n―Now, from what I have heard you told us these women were really both pretty\ndarn lucky because neither of them really suffered or felt any pain before they\ndied?‖ The court sustained defense counsel‘s objection that the question was\nargumentative. The prosecutor asked, ―Didn‘t you, in response to [defense\ncounsel‘s] series of questions, basically have both of these women unconscious\nand not feeling any pain before they died?‖ Dr. Wolf replied, ―Yes.‖ The\nprosecutor asked, ―And so if I were to show you then Exhibit[] 1, a photograph of\nMrs. Deeble in death, and Exhibit 33, a photograph of Mrs. Delbecq in death, you\nare going to tell us, doctor, that these women did not feel any pain before they\ndied?‖ Dr. Wolf answered, ―Yes.‖ The prosecutor asked, ―They were fortunate,\nindeed, weren‘t they?‖ The court sustained defense counsel‘s objection that the\nquestion was argumentative. The circumstance that the prosecutor asked two\n\n                                          95\n\fquestions ruled argumentative does not demonstrate that he infected the trial with\nsuch unfairness as to render the subsequent conviction a denial of due process, or\nengaged in deceptive or reprehensible methods employed to persuade the trier of\nfact. (Avila, supra, 46 Cal.4th at p. 711.)\n     Defendant also contends that the prosecutor reminded the jury of his\n―improper attack on Dr. Wolf[]‖ during closing argument. The prosecutor said,\n―Exhibit 1 and Exhibit 33, these are the two . . . photographs I held up. You are\ntelling us that these women did not feel any pain? And I was a little sarcastic,\nfrankly, when I asked that. Do we have that much to be grateful for that they\ndidn‘t feel . . . pain. He said, no, they did not feel pain. . . . That is ridiculous.\nThat defies common sense.‖ Defendant did not object below to the prosecutor‘s\nargument, no exception to the general requirement of an objection is applicable,\nand the claim is therefore forfeited. (People v. Schmeck (2005) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2595628\"><a href=\"/opinion/2595628/people-v-schmeck/\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">240</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n286 (Schmeck).) The claim is also meritless. The prosecutor‘s questions to\nDr. Wolf on cross-examination were objectionable because they were\nargumentative, but argumentative statements are appropriate during closing\nargument. A prosecutor‘s ―argument may be vigorous as long as it is a fair\ncomment on the evidence, which can include reasonable inferences or deductions\nto be drawn therefrom.‖ (People v. Harrison (2005) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2508322\"><a href=\"/opinion/2508322/people-v-harrison/\"><span class=\"volume\">35</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">208</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 244.) Here,\nthe gravaman of the argument was simply that Dr. Wolf‘s opinion that neither\nDeeble nor Delbecq felt pain lacked credibility. To the extent there is a reasonable\nlikelihood the jury construed the prosecutor‘s argument as referring to the\nquestions for which defendant‘s objections were sustained, there is no possible\nprejudice given that at the same point in the questioning Dr. Wolf twice agreed\nwith the prosecutor that in his opinion the victims had not felt pain.\n     Defendant further contends the prosecutor engaged in an ―improperly\nargumentative style of examination‖ when cross-examining Janice Hunt and\n\n                                            96\n\fdefendant. The prosecutor asked Hunt why she had exposed her ―precious\ndaughter to a heavy drug user like‖ defendant. As defendant notes, his objection\nto this line of questioning was overruled. Moreover, Hunt explained that she did\nnot think defendant was using drugs at the time he lived with Hunt and her\ndaughter. Nor did the prosecutor commit misconduct during his cross-\nexamination of defendant when — in response to defendant‘s testimony that his\ndrug and alcohol use kept him from success as a father and husband and in holding\ndown a job — he asked defendant if this lack of success was because he was not\nwilling to take responsibility for his choices, or when he challenged defendant that\nhe knew ―darn well‖ that individuals who wanted to get help and recover from\naddiction are able to do that. As defendant notes, the trial court overruled\nobjections to these questions, and defendant fails to demonstrate how they\nconstituted misconduct.\n     Defendant further asserts the prosecutor asked Hunt an argumentative\nquestion, and improperly challenged her credibility in front of the jury. The\nprosecutor asked Hunt if she recalled giving defendant a ―big wave and a big\nsmile‖ at the lunch break. Hunt replied, ―Yes.‖ The prosecutor asked, ―You still\ncarry a little bit of a torch for him?‖ Hunt replied, ―I still feel he is innocent.‖ The\nprosecutor said, ―That is not my question, ma‘am.‖ Hunt said, ―I am sorry.‖ The\nprosecutor then asked the question defendant challenges here: ―You wanted to say\nthat, didn‘t you?‖ The trial court sustained defense counsel‘s objection that the\nquestion was argumentative. The prosecutor asked, ―When I asked you if you still\ncarried a torch for him, why did you talk about his innocence?‖ The court\noverruled defense counsel‘s objection that the question was argumentative. Hunt\nreplied, ―To me he seems like a decent human being.‖ The prosecutor asked,\n―That is not my question. When I asked you . . . if you still carried a torch for\nhim, why did you talk about his innocence instead of whether or not you still\n\n                                          97\n\fcarried a torch for him?‖ Hunt replied that she did not understand what the\nprosecutor meant by ―carry a torch.‖ The prosecutor asked, ―You don‘t know\nwhat that phrase means, ma‘am?‖ Hunt replied, ―No, sir.‖ The court overruled\ndefense counsel‘s objection that the question was argumentative. The prosecutor\nasked, ―You have feelings for him still, do you not?‖ Hunt replied, ―As a friend,\nyes.‖\n        Defendant makes no attempt to demonstrate how the prosecutor‘s question\ninfected the trial with such unfairness as to render the subsequent conviction a\ndenial of due process, or constituted a deceptive or reprehensible method\nemployed to persuade the trier of fact. (Avila, supra, 46 Cal.4th at p. 711.)\nMoreover, the prosecutor was entitled to explore the basis for any bias on Hunt‘s\npart for defendant.\n        Defendant further asserts that the prosecutor committed misconduct when he\nasked defendant if Kathryn Valentine was lying when she testified about how\noften she saw defendant drunk or using drugs, and that defendant was ―aware of a\nkey at her mother‘s residence and of a screen.‖ When defendant said as to each of\nthese events that Valentine was lying, the prosecutor asked if defendant knew why\nshe would lie, and defendant said he did not know the reason. No misconduct\noccurred. Defendant had personal knowledge both of these events, and of\nValentine, and hence knew whether Valentine‘s testimony was accurate and what\nmotivation she might have to lie. (Chatman, supra, 38 Cal.4th at pp. 382-383.)\n        Defendant further contends that the prosecutor improperly asked defendant to\ncomment on the testimony of Dr. Stalcup. On cross-examination, defendant\nagreed with the prosecutor that Dr. Stalcup had testified that as one continues to\ndrink alcohol, fine motor coordination is first affected, and eventually gross motor\ncoordination. The prosecutor asked, ―Dr. Stalcup never said that you as an addict\nor a user of alcohol didn‘t go through those stages, did he?‖ Defendant replied,\n\n                                          98\n\f―No. . . . He doesn‘t know me.‖ The prosecutor asked, ―He doesn‘t know you?‖\nDefendant replied, ―Dr. Stalcup, he has never interviewed me.‖ The prosecutor\nsaid, ―[H]e talked about people in your condition, did he not?‖ Defendant replied,\n―Yes.‖ In the now challenged question, the prosecutor asked, ―That was the whole\npoint of his testimony, wasn‘t it?‖ Defendant replied, ―Yes.‖ Defense counsel\nobjected that the question called for speculation, and the trial court sustained the\nobjection and struck the answer.\n     No misconduct is apparent. Contrary to defendant‘s assertion, the\nprosecutor‘s question was not a ―sarcastic aside[],‖ but simply stated the\nreasonable inference that Dr. Stalcup had been called to testify about drug and\nalcohol addiction. The jury, who had heard Dr. Stalcup‘s testimony, would\nreasonably draw the same inference.\n\n               b. Asserted denigration of defense counsel\n     Defendant contends the prosecutor committed misconduct during closing\nargument by denigrating defense counsel. ―A prosecutor commits misconduct if\nhe or she attacks the integrity of defense counsel, or casts aspersions on defense\ncounsel.‖ (People v.

Young\n(2005) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">149, 1189 (Young)), and whether there is a reasonable\nlikelihood the jury construed the remarks in an objectionable fashion (Cash, supra,\n28 Cal.4th at p. 733).\n     During defense counsel‘s closing argument, he observed that to convict\ndefendant of torture murder, the jury was required to find that the perpetrator\n\n\n\n                                          99\n\f―intended to inflict prolonged pain, something that lasts a long time.‖ He then\nargued that ―[i]f the first thing that happened was that [Deeble] was strangled, she\nwould be unconscious in less than a minute,‖ if she received a knock-out blow, she\nwould be unconscious immediately, and ―Dr. Fukumoto isn‘t going to say\nanything different from‖ Dr. Wolf. The prosecutor interrupted, and said ―That is\nnot true, your honor, and in fact . . . unconsciousness is irrelevant and [defense\ncounsel] knows it.‖ Defense counsel said, ―I object to the constant objections.‖\nThe trial court sustained the prosecutor‘s objection. Defendant asserts that the\nprosecutor ―voiced [an] opinion to the jury that defense counsel had intentionally\nsought to mislead them.‖ There is no reasonable likelihood the jury construed the\nprosecutor‘s comment that defense counsel ―knows it‖ as an attack on counsel‘s\nintegrity. Even if the comment could be so construed, it was fleeting, and\ntherefore harmless. (See Young, supra, 34 Cal.4th at p. 1190.)\n     Defendant contends the prosecutor interrupted defense counsel‘s closing\nargument twice with the complaint that he had been personally attacked. In the\nfirst instance, defense counsel argued that whatever the substance was that was on\nthe ridge of the mousse can, it could not have come from Deeble‘s vagina or\nrectum because there was no blood in those orifices. In so doing, he said, ―[Y]ou\nknow why [the prosecutor] wanted to ride through his false front western town\nreal fast.‖ The prosecutor objected ―to the repeated personal attacks that [defense\ncounsel] feels necessary to go after me.‖ The trial court stated, ―Stick with the\nevidence, [defense counsel], if you don‘t mind.‖ In the second instance, defense\ncounsel observed that ―it is not only the L.A. Narcotics officers who want\n[Dr. Stalcup] to tell them about drugs, but Janet Reno, the Attorney General of this\ncountry. And if the prosecutor is going to pooh pooh that because [Reno] is a\nDemocrat, then Dan Lungren who is the Attorney General of the state who is a\nRepublican —‖ The prosecutor objected, ―Why does [defense counsel] have to\n\n                                         100\n\fbring me into every argument?‖ The trial court stated, ―I don‘t know what politics\nhave to do with this particular case, [defense counsel].‖ Defense counsel replied,\n―Nothing at all, your honor.‖ The court said, ―Then stay away from it.‖ It is not\napparent, and defendant does not explain, how the prosecutor‘s objections\nimproperly denigrated defense counsel.\n     Defendant further contends that the prosecutor denigrated defense counsel\nwhen he responded to defense counsel‘s use of the word ―derisory.‖ Defense\ncounsel called the prosecutor‘s implication that Dr. Wolf had not performed\n―enough trauma autopsies,‖ and was ―underqualified‖ because he did not work for\na sheriff, ―derisory.‖ On rebuttal, the prosecutor asserted: ―[T]here is a word\n[defense counsel] used in describing me twice yesterday, a word called\n‗derisory.‘ . . . And he was in the middle of attacking me personally over and over\nand over again when he was using that word.‖ The trial court overruled defense\ncounsel‘s objection that the argument was improper. The prosecutor said: ―So I\nfigured it had to be some kind of a snap at me, ‗derisory.‘ . . . I got a copy of it out\nof the dictionary . . . [and] [t]hat didn‘t help me very much. . . . Well, I looked up\n‗derision,‘ . . . and it says an object of ridicule or scorn, a laughing stock. That is\nwhat they think of me. That is what they think of this case.‖ Contrary to\ndefendant‘s claim, the prosecutor‘s statements were fair rebuttal.\n     Nor did the prosecutor impermissibly attack defense counsel on rebuttal\nwhen he argued: ―I was attacked for cheating — let‘s see what did [defense\ncounsel] say. Fake fronts, western towns.‖ The prosecutor recalled a ―Western\nanalogy‖ of individuals lighting fires outside around a home in an effort to get the\noccupants of the home to leave ―and try to put the fire out.‖ He subsequently\nargued: ―They try to create fires by never really responding to the other challenge\nI made. What is the defense, I asked? . . . Is your defense that your client didn‘t do\nit, or is your defense that your client did it but there was no crime, there was no\n\n                                          101\n\ftorture? . . . Or is your defense that because of alcohol, you had a blackout and,\ntherefore, you aren‘t responsible? What was the response to my question? Ladies\nand gentlemen, we don‘t know what you are going to believe. We don‘t know\nwhich fire you are going to go out and chase. So we give you all of these, and you\nmake up your mind. They don‘t know what the defense is. They are defending\nthe defendant without knowing the defense. They are hoping that by attacking the\npolice, by attacking the crime scene, by attacking me, that is the old . . . law school\ndeal . . . ‗If the facts are on your side, you argue the facts. If the law is on your\nside, you argue the law. If neither is on your side, you attack your opponent.‘\nThat is the only way I can explain. . . . So I don‘t know why [defense counsel] had\nto get up here and start this attack.‖ Defense counsel said, ―I am going to object to\nthe personal attacks, improper argument.‖ The court overruled the objection. The\nprosecutor continued: ―The only thing I can think of is trying to light a fire,\nhoping that I would run out trying to put it out and hoping you would run out and\nchase it, but I won‘t do that. What did I finish with . . . yesterday? These are\nhonorable men. I don‘t know why [defense counsel] felt he had to do that. I am\nnot going to change my opinion that they are honorable men. . . . I am not going to\ngo after them that way. I will not do it.‖\n     As can be seen, other than to the comment ―I don‘t know why [defense\ncounsel] had to get up here and start this attack,‖ defendant did not object to the\nprosecutor‘s argument, no exception to the general requirement of an objection is\napplicable, and his claim is therefore forfeited on appeal. (Schmeck, supra,\n37 Cal.4th at p. 286.) Moreover, his claim as to all portions of the argument is\nmeritless. The prosecutor‘s comments were fair rebuttal to defense counsel‘s\ncharacterization of the prosecution evidence as a ―false front western town.‖ They\nwere also supported by evidence at trial of varying defenses of alibi, insufficient\nevidence of torture, and lessened culpability because of a blackout. ―We accord\n\n                                          102\n\fthe prosecutor wide latitude in describing the factual deficiencies of the defense\ncase.‖ (Cash, supra, 28 Cal.4th at p. 733.) Contrary to defendant‘s assertion,\nnothing in the argument ―carried the clear implication that defense counsel did not\nbelieve in [defendant‘s] innocence‖ or believe their own client.\n\n                 c. Additional asserted misconduct during closing argument\n     Defendant contends that the prosecutor lessened the People‘s burden of proof\nbeyond a reasonable doubt during his closing argument. The prosecutor theorized\nthat either defendant had graduated to a more sadistic level when he killed\nDelbecq, or that Deeble had died too quickly so he did not have a chance to\npenetrate her with the mousse can ―all the way up.‖ He then argued: ―Would you\ngive him . . . the benefit of the doubt on that? Would you think it was - now I am\ntalking about something different than proof beyond a reasonable doubt, okay? I\nam talking about knowing this man as you know him, is there a reason that a\nperson who is brutally torturing women, are you going to give him a benefit as to\nhis motivation? Are you going to say he probably did it differently because it is\nnot the same guy? [O]r are you going to assume the worst? Would it be fair in\nthis case to assume the worst that the motivation, that the reason he couldn‘t get\nmore sexually involved with these mousse cans was because he killed her too fast?\nI say it would be fair. You will ultimately determine whether it would be fair or\nnot; it is true or not. I submit under these facts it is fair. I submit it is . . fair not to\ngive him the benefit of any factual or mental, anything to his benefit.‖ Defense\ncounsel objected, ―[T]his is an improper lessening of the burden of proof on the\nprosecution,‖ and asked that the prosecutor be admonished. The trial court stated:\n―I am going to instruct the jury. You are going to get a chance to rebut, and the\njury will follow the court‘s instructions.‖ The prosecutor continued: ―You\nunderstand what I am saying? I want to repeat it. I don‘t want the defense to be\n\n\n\n                                            103\n\f[accusing me of] doing something I shouldn‘t be. I am not talking about the\nburden of proof.‖\n     During the defense closing argument, counsel asserted that the prosecutor\n―did a nice job when he tries to make you think that what you are doing here is\neasy. It is not easy. . . . And when he tells you at the tail end of his argument that\nhe is not asking you to decide this case on less than beyond a reasonable doubt,\nwell, you know, you can all remember . . . 15 minutes ago in the core of his\nargument, you know, he said exactly that. . . . He said don‘t give this man the\nbenefit of the doubt, and he said as to issues of specific intent and mental state,\ndon‘t give him the benefit of the doubt. He said that —‖ The prosecutor objected,\n―Your Honor, that is not what I said.‖ The court replied: ―Well, it is in the record\nand it is in your memories. If you need help, my reporter will find it for you.\nOkay? The People have the burden of proof. I don‘t recall anybody trying to\nlessen that. And if somebody did, ignore it. You will get the law. I will read it to\nyou very carefully, and I am going to give it to you in writing. And what I tell you\nabout the law is what counts.‖ Defense counsel continued, ―Ladies and\ngentlemen, when [the prosecutor] asked you to decide the case against [defendant]\non a less than reasonable doubt, which that is what he means when he says don‘t\ngive him the benefit of the doubt —‖ The prosecutor said: ―That is not what it\nmeans. That is not what I said, and I am going to object. It is improper. It is\nmisstating my argument.‖ The trial court sustained the objection.\n     Viewing the prosecutor‘s comments in context, he argued that differences\nbetween the Deeble and Delbecq murders did not mean they were not committed\nby the same perpetrator. Moreover, during this portion of his argument the\nprosecutor twice reminded the jury he was not talking about his burden of proof\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. The trial court subsequently instructed the jury that\nthe prosecutor had the burden of proof, to ignore any contrary statements by\n\n                                         104\n\fcounsel, and that what the court said about the law ―is what counts.‖ In addition,\nthe prosecutor vehemently denied he had asserted the jury should decide the case\non a standard less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt, and the jury was properly\ninstructed on the standard of proof. There is thus no reasonable likelihood the jury\nconstrued the prosecutor‘s remarks as properly suggesting that the burden of proof\nwas not guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n     Defendant further contends the prosecutor improperly suggested that if the\nDeeble and Delbecq murders were not uniquely similar, the defense would have\nintroduced contrary evidence. The prosecutor said: ―[D]id you hear any of the\ndefense witnesses . . . come in here and tell you how these mousse cans got in both\nplaces? Did they have an explanation for you at any point along the way? None.\nIt cannot be explained. Do they have access to show us all the other murders out\nthere that happened this same way? Of course they do. There aren‘t any.‖ The\ntrial court sustained defense counsel‘s objection that the argument assumed facts\nnot in evidence, and struck the comment. Thus, even assuming the prosecutor‘s\ncomment rose to the level of misconduct, there was no possible prejudice given\nthe trial court immediately sustained defendant‘s objection and struck the\ncomment.\n     Defendant further contends that the prosecutor committed misconduct by\nexpressing a personal belief in defendant‘s guilt when he referred to defendant as\nthe ―killer.‖ The prosecutor argued: ―[W]ith all these similarities‖ between the\nDeeble and Delbecq murders, ―so sick, so similar, so telling, the whole sexual\nmotivation of both, how is it possible with all of that that this defendant is not the\nkiller? . . . And none of you will be able to walk out of that room . . and say, well,\nyeah, yeah, you know, these mousse cans and all this other stuff, well, they didn‘t\nreally tell us that much. You know . . . any killer that knew both had access to\nthese women, one knew her, one he lived by, that is just what any killer would\n\n                                         105\n\fhave done. See, when you come to that conclusion, when you arrive there, then\nwhether or not pubic hairs got left or not or blown around or whatever doesn‘t\nmean very much. Because you know that, whereas maybe that evidence would be\nin a crime scene or maybe it wouldn‘t. You know it wasn‘t here, legitimately\nwasn‘t here. And that is just the way it was. Because he is the killer, and it just\ndidn‘t happen. I hope you see what I am saying by that. The possibilities of\ninterpretation go away when you know what happened.‖\n     ―[P]rosecutors should not purport to rely in jury argument on their outside\nexperience or personal beliefs based on facts not in evidence.‖ (People v. Medina\n(1995) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1127426\"><a href=\"/opinion/1127426/people-v-medina/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">694</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 776.) Here, however, the prosecutor simply asserted based\non the evidence that defendant was the murderer of Deeble and Delbecq. No\nmisconduct occurred.\n\n                 d. Cumulative prejudice\n     Defendant contends that the ―cumulative prejudice of overall misconduct\nrequires a new trial.‖ We have found no misconduct, and where we have assumed\nmisconduct, we have found no prejudice under any standard. Nor do we discern\nany cumulative prejudice.\n\n            11. Limitation of defense counsel’s closing argument\n     Defendant contends that the trial court improperly limited defense counsel‘s\nclosing argument on two occasions. A trial court ―is given great latitude in\ncontrolling the duration and limiting the scope of closing‖ argument. (Herring v.\nNew York (1975) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109310\"><a href=\"/opinion/109310/herring-v-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">422</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">853</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 862.) It ―may ensure that argument does not stray\nunduly from the mark, or otherwise impede the fair and orderly conduct of the\ntrial.‖ (Ibid.; § 1044 [―It shall be the duty of the judge to . . . limit the . . .\nargument of counsel to relevant and material matters‖].) We conclude the trial\ncourt did not abuse its broad discretion here.\n\n\n\n                                            106\n\f     During defense counsel‘s closing argument, he argued that ―[i]f the first\nthing that happened was that [Deeble] was strangled, she would be unconscious in\nless than a minute,‖ if she received a knock-out blow, she would be unconscious\nimmediately, and ―Dr. Fukumoto isn‘t going to say anything different from‖\nDr. Wolf. The prosecutor interrupted, and said ―That is not true, your honor, and\nin fact . . . unconsciousness is irrelevant and [defense counsel] knows it.‖ Defense\ncounsel said, ―I object to the constant objections.‖ The trial court sustained the\nprosecutor‘s objection. Defense counsel continued his argument, and observed:\n―The intention of the perpetrator to cause prolonged pain is critical. Nobody\nintending to cause prolonged pain would knock out their victim. It defeats the\npurpose. No one intending to cause prolonged pain would ligature strangle their\nvictims so fast that their brain swells up and they lose consciousness in less than a\nminute. Look, this isn‘t as complicated as [the prosecutor] makes it want to seem.\nEvery time you have seen any TV trauma, anything with torture in it, what is the\ncommon feature? The people doing the torturing want the people getting tortured\nto stay awake. When they pass out, they throw a bucket of water on them. If you\nlook at torture down through history . . . they never wanted anybody to lose\nconsciousness. They wanted them to answer the question . . . . When torture is\nused in time of war, it is to get the unfortunate person being . . . tortured to give up\nthe information he has, not to make him pass out. That is crazy. You defeat the\npurpose. The purpose is what the statute says, . . . the intent to inflict prolonged\npain on someone else. . . . No doubt in the case of Miss Deeble a couple of blows\nwere struck very quickly. . . . Probably one to the nose first. One to the abdomen\ndamaging the pancreas, boom, boom, subdue the victim and then what? And then\nstrangle her. . . . This woman was not tortured.‖\n     Defendant contends that unconsciousness was not irrelevant because ―an\nassailant‘s decision to render his victim quickly insensible to pain is powerful\n\n                                          107\n\fcircumstantial evidence that he did not intend to cause‖ extreme and prolonged\npain. As can be seen, counsel was not precluded from making such an argument,\nand ably did so.\n     Defendant also contends that the trial court improperly limited closing\nargument when it precluded him from playing a four- or five-minute television\nstory. During argument, defense counsel asserted that ―[m]any times in life\nsimilarities are coincidences.‖ He recalled seeing a recent news story about a\ncouple in Illinois who won about $2,500,000 in the state lottery and learned that\nthe previous owners of their home had also won a large amount in the state lottery.\nHe also recounted numerous similarities between President Kennedy and President\nLincoln, and observed that if one added the numbers in the date on which the\nmurders in the O. J. Simpson case occurred, they equaled 32, which was\nSimpson‘s number when he played professional football. He also noted that if one\nadded the numbers in the date on which Deeble was killed they also equaled 32,\nand wondered where O. J. Simpson was on May 12, 1986.\n     Counsel then began to describe a television story that had been broadcast\nseveral months earlier about two women who had never met, but shared numerous\nsimilarities including the same name and date of birth, and said he was going to\nplay the four- or five-minute video. The prosecutor objected, and a hearing was\nheld at sidebar. The court sustained the objection under Evidence Code section\n352 and for lack of foundation, but permitted defense counsel to describe the\nsimilarities between the two women to the jury.\n     The trial court acted well within its discretion in excluding the videotape.\nContrary to defendant‘s assertion, the court was entitled to rely on counsel‘s\ndescription of the tape, and was not required to personally view the tape before\nruling. Here, counsel‘s central point was that there can be similarities between\nevents or individuals without those individuals or events being related, and hence,\n\n                                        108\n\fsimilarities between the Deeble and Delbecq murders did not mean that defendant\ncommitted both murders. Counsel was given considerable leeway to make this\npoint including informing the jury of all of the similarities from the videotape that\ncounsel deemed relevant.\n\n            12. Asserted instructional error\n\n                a. Failure to give requested defense instructions\n      Defendant contends the trial court erred in declining to instruct the jury in the\nlanguage of his proposed special instruction in violation of his rights under the\nFifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the federal Constitution. Not\nso.\n      Defendant first claims that the trial court erroneously refused proposed\ndefense instructions on the issue of other crimes evidence to show identity. The\nfirst proposed instruction read: ―The greatest degree of similarity is required for\nevidence of uncharged misconduct to be relevant to prove identity. For identity\nto be established, the uncharged misconduct and the charged offense must share\ncommon features that are sufficiently distinctive so as to support the inference\nthat the same person committed both acts. [Citation.] ‗The pattern and\ncharacteristics of the crimes must be so unusual and distinctive as to be like a\nsignature.‘ [Citation.]‖ This instruction was properly refused. The first\nsentence was confusing, because the instructions elsewhere did not address the\ndegree of similarity required for common plan or intent. The second sentence was\nalready contained in the jury instructions. (People v. Gurule, supra, 28 Cal.4th at\np. 659 [the trial court need not give duplicative instructions].) The trial court\nproperly refused to give the third sentence on the ground that it was too vague to\nassist the jury, and gave adequate instructions to the jury on the standard to apply\n\n\n\n\n                                         109\n\fwhen determining whether Delbecq‘s uncharged murder was sufficiently similar\nto Debble‘s charged murder to demonstrate identity.\n     The second proposed instruction provided: ―If you have no doubt that the\nperpetrator of the Los Alamitos homicide was Mr. Edwards, then you may\nconsider the evidence of the Hawaii homicide on the issue of intent in the Los\nAlamitos homicide.‖ The court properly refused to give this instruction ―as\nwritten‖ on the ground that it was an incorrect statement of the law. (Ewoldt,\nsupra, 7 Cal.4th at p. 393.) Although defendant contends the trial court should\nhave modified the instruction to conform to the law, no modification was\nsuggested below.\n     Defendant further contends that the trial court erred in refusing his request\nfor further admonishment the day after Sergeant Jessen‘s rebuttal testimony. (See\nante, at pt. II.B.9.) In particular, he claims the court should have instructed the\njury with the following portion of the proposed further admonishment: ―A\nstatement was made yesterday that requires a further admonition. Sergeant Jessen\ntestified that the seven named individuals were eliminated by ‗DNA testing.‘\nAfter consultation with the attorneys it appears that statement was false. There\nnever was DNA testing done regarding the seven named individuals. Other testing\nled Sergeant Jessen to believe that they were not viable suspects in his mind.‖\n     No error in refusing the request for further admonition is apparent. Sergeant\nJessen did not answer the question about DNA. Moreover, the trial court‘s\nadmonishment the previous day informed the jury that the question regarding\n―DNA‖ was struck, and it was to disregard the term ―DNA.‖ We presume the jury\nfollowed that instruction. (People v. Avila, supra, 38 Cal.4th at p. 574.)\n\n\n\n\n                                         110\n\f               b. Omission during oral jury instructions\n     During the oral jury instructions, the trial court omitted the word ―living‖\nfrom the murder by torture and torture-murder special-circumstance instructions.\nHowever, the written instructions, which the jury received, used the word ―living.‖\nIn addition, the prosecutor used the word ―living‖ when he read the murder by\ntorture instruction to the jury during closing argument, and defense counsel did so\non two occasions when reading a portion of the torture-murder special-\ncircumstance instruction.\n     Moreover, immediately after the court instructed the jury, defense counsel\ntold the court he did not recall hearing the word ―living.‖ Counsel then said he\nwas satisfied if the word ―living‖ appeared in the written instructions. No request\nto further instruct the jury was made.\n     ―We of course presume ‗that jurors understand and follow the court‘s\ninstructions.‘ [Citation.] This presumption includes the written instructions.\n[Citation.] To the extent a discrepancy exists between the written and oral\nversions of jury instructions, the written instructions provided to the jury will\ncontrol.‖ (People v. Wilson (2008) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2570544\"><a href=\"/opinion/2570544/people-v-wilson/\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">758</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 803.) Here, the written\ninstructions contained the word ―living,‖ and both counsel used the word ―living‖\nduring argument. There is therefore no ―reasonable likelihood the jury applied the\nchallenged instructions in an impermissible manner.‖ (Ibid.)\n\n           13. Asserted cumulative error\n     Defendant contends that cumulative guilt phase error requires reversal. We\nhave found no error, and where we have assumed error, we have found no\nprejudice. Nor do we discern cumulative prejudice.\n\n\n\n\n                                         111\n\f       C. Second Penalty Phase Issues\n\n           1. Asserted restrictions on voir dire\n     Defendant contends the trial court improperly restricted voir dire as to two\njurors who sat on his jury, and two prospective jurors, in violation of his rights\nunder the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the federal\nConstitution. He asserts the inadequate voir dire gave counsel insufficient\ninformation to appropriately determine challenges for cause. This claim borders\non the specious.\n     As to the prospective jurors who did not sit on defendant‘s jury, even\nassuming error, no prejudice could have resulted from any limitation on voir dire.\n(People v. Roldan (2005) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2546413\"><a href=\"/opinion/2546413/people-v-roldan/\"><span class=\"volume\">35</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">646</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 692.)\n     As to Prospective Jurors Nos. 212 and 166, who did serve on defendant‘s\njury, defendant contends that the trial court ―repeatedly refused to allow‖ trial\ncounsel to ask these prospective jurors ―whether they would automatically return a\nverdict of death in a case involving generalized facts likely to be presented by the\nprosecutor (a brutal double homicide).‖ He asserts that although counsel was\npermitted to ask Prospective Juror No. 166 whether he ―would automatically vote\nfor death in a double homicide case,‖ he should have been permitted to add to his\nhypothetical the generalized facts that the double homicides involved torture,\nburglary, sexual assault, and strangulation. The record demonstrates no such\nlimitations on voir dire.\n     After the hardship excusals, and before death qualification voir dire began,\nthe court read the information to the prospective jurors, including Prospective\nJurors Nos. 212 and 166. The prospective jurors thereby learned that defendant\nhad been convicted of murdering Deeble while engaged in the commission of\nburglary, and that the murder was intentional and involved the infliction of torture.\nMoreover, voir dire was not sequestered. At the beginning of voir dire,\n\n\n                                         112\n\fProspective Juror No. 212 was placed in the box, and Prospective Juror No. 166\nwas in the courtroom. The court told the prospective jurors: ―For those of you in\nthe audience, I would appreciate it if you listen very carefully to all of my\nquestions, all of the responses given by the jurors in the box, and please do the\nsame when the attorneys are asking questions.‖ The trial court subsequently told\nthe prospective jurors while Prospective Juror No. 212 was in the box: ―You will\nhear evidence of a sexual nature. . . . I am not telling you that there is going to be\nevidence that these things occurred. . . I am just wanting you to think about it to\nsee if you will be able to evaluate evidence. Rape, sodomy. Can you objectively\nevaluate evidence concerning sexual acts such as those I just mentioned?\nAnybody with a negative answer? The record does not reflect that Prospective\nJuror No. 212 responded. The court also said: ―[Y]ou also heard that one of the\nspecial circumstances in this case involved torture. And I am assuming that when\nI said that, you probably thought of something; is that a fair statement? Probably\nthought of pain? Can you objectively discuss torture or things that the prosecution\nfor sure would refer to torture and you may or may not agree, but can you discuss\nthose things?‖ No response from any prospective juror is reflected in the record.\n     In addition, defense counsel described the crimes to the prospective jurors,\nsaying, ―[Y]ou are going to hear evidence . . . . about a murder that involves a\nstrangulation; it involves a sexual assault with a foreign object; it involves blows\nto the head; a second murder that involves sexual assault with a foreign object,\nblows to the head and strangulation.‖ A short time later, when questioning\nProspective Juror No. 212, defense counsel noted: ―[Y]ou heard a little factual\nscenario that I have given. Those are really awful crimes.‖ Prospective Juror\nNo. 212 replied, ―Yes.‖ Defense counsel asked, ―And is that the kind of crime\nwhere you think that the death penalty is always going to be warranted?‖ The\nprosecutor objected to the question ―as phrased‖ because it asked the prospective\n\n                                          113\n\fjuror to ―prejudge,‖ and the trial court sustained the objection. Defense counsel\nthen asked, ―Is that the kind of case where the death penalty would always be\nwarranted in your mind without listening to any other evidence?‖ Prospective\nJuror No. 212 replied, ―To answer your question, I don‘t think the death penalty is\nalways warranted in any case.‖\n     Defense counsel then began questioning a different prospective juror, and in\nso doing asked: ―Now, specifically you heard the description I gave of some acts\nthat involve strangulation, sex with foreign objects, intentional torture on two\noccasions, are those the kinds of crimes . . . that when you hear them, you will no\nlonger be open to listening to anything mitigating or any evidence in mitigation\nabout [defendant]?‖ Likewise, when questioning yet another prospective juror,\ndefense counsel said: ―As you know, when you came in here and his honor told\nyou this morning, [defendant] has already been convicted of first degree murder\nwith a torture special circumstance, intentional torture, and with doing that murder\nin the commission of a burglary. Okay? He‘s already been convicted beyond a\nreasonable doubt. And you also will hear circumstances about in 1993 in Hawaii,\nthere‘s a similar murder that involves torture and murder. And both the crimes\ninvolved the use of sex with foreign object . . . either anally or vaginally, okay?‖\nDefense counsel subsequently returned to questioning Prospective Juror No. 212,\nand said: ―You heard me describe in more detail this afternoon, you‘ve had the\nlunch hour to think about it, some facts that have been described by some of the\njurors as being heinous. . . . [A]s you sit there now and think about those facts,\nhave you made up your mind that this is the kind of case that should automatically\nreceive the death penalty?‖ Prospective Juror No. 212 replied, ―No.‖\n     Two days later, Prospective Juror No. 166 was questioned by a different\nmember of the defense team, who asked: ―[Y]ou sat through the entire process the\nlast couple of days that we have been going through, have you not?‖ Prospective\n\n                                         114\n\fJuror No. 166 replied, ―Absolutely.‖ Defense counsel subsequently asked, ―Can\nyou, sir, see yourself returning a verdict of life without the possibility of parole for\na person who has been convicted of first degree premeditated, intentional murder,\ntorture, burglary, sexual assault, strangulation and there is another homicide in\nHawaii of a similar nature that you as a juror, I am just telling you factually, have\nfound to be true that he is responsible for as well?‖ The court sustained the\nprosecutor‘s objection that the question ―calls for prejudgment and speculation as\nphrased.‖ Defense counsel then asked, ―Can you see yourself returning a verdict\nof life without the possibility of parole, depending upon the evidence that has been\npresented to you for a person who has been convicted of first degree murder,\ntorture and burglary and that that homicide involved a sexual assault,\nstrangulation, and you find as a juror that [defendant] is also responsible for a\nsimilar type of homicide in Hawaii?‖ The court again sustained the prosecutor‘s\nobjection. Defense counsel then asked, ―Are you open to considering the evidence\nin this case, mitigating factors that may be presented to you in this case and having\nthe possibility of returning a verdict of life without the possibility of parole?‖\nProspective Juror No. 166 replied, ―I am definitely open to considering all the\nfacts before I render any type of decision.‖ Defense counsel asked, ―Would you\nvote for the death penalty in every case in a situation where you have found a\nperson guilty of more than one homicide?‖ Prospective Juror No. 166 replied,\n―No, I would not.‖\n     ―Our decisions have explained that death-qualification voir dire must avoid\ntwo extremes. On the one hand, it must not be so abstract that it fails to identify\nthose jurors whose death penalty views would prevent or substantially impair the\nperformance of their duties as jurors in the case being tried. On the other hand, it\nmust not be so specific that it requires the prospective jurors to prejudge the\npenalty issue based on a summary of the mitigating and aggravating evidence\n\n                                          115\n\flikely to be presented.‖ (Cash, supra, 28 Cal.4th at pp. 721-722.) As can be seen,\ncontrary to defendant‘s claim, the prospective jurors here were well aware of the\ngeneralized facts regarding the two homicides, including the circumstance that\nthey involved torture, burglary, sexual assault with a foreign object, and\nstrangulation. On this record, the circumstance that the court sustained the\nprosecutor‘s objection to two questions to Prospective Juror No. 166, and one\nquestion to Prospective Juror No. 212, because they were deemed to improperly\nseek prejudgment of the facts, does not demonstrate that voir dire was improperly\nlimited.\n\n            2. Asserted error in ruling on challenges for cause\n\n                a. Prosecution challenge for cause\n     Defendant contends that the trial court erroneously excused Prospective Juror\nNo. 180 because of her views regarding the death penalty in violation of his rights\nunder the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the federal\nConstitution, and article I, sections 1, 7, and 15-17 of the state Constitution. We\ndisagree.\n\n                    1) Factual background\n     In her questionnaire, in response to a question about Prospective Juror No.\n180‘s general feelings regarding the death penalty, she stated: ―I think the death\npenalty satisfies an emotional need to dramatically express the seriousness of the\ncrime. I think it is unnecessary and not a deterrent to crime. I think it is not given\nequally. I would not want the burden of knowing my decision put a person to\ndeath.‖ In response to a question about whether the death penalty was used too\noften, too seldom, or randomly, she stated, ―I do think it is used randomly, and in\nsome places innocent people are put to death to ‗send a message.‘ ‖ When asked\nwhether she had such a conscientious opinion concerning the death penalty that\n\n\n                                         116\n\fshe would automatically refuse to vote for the death penalty in any case regardless\nof the evidence, she wrote, ―No, but I lean strongly in that direction and would not\nwant [to] make that choice for death.‖\n        During voir dire, the trial court asked the prospective jurors ―if any of you\nhave strong personal feelings concerning these possible penalties.‖ Prospective\nJuror No. 180 said, ―As I expressed in my questionnaire, I feel I would have a\ngreat deal of difficulty selecting the death penalty for a person.‖ The court said\nthat it had read her questionnaire, and asked if she had ―anything in addition to\nwhat you wrote there?‖ Prospective Juror No. 180 said, ―The more I think about it\nthe less I think I could vote for the death penalty.‖ After further colloquy with the\ncourt, she added, ―[P]ersonally I just feel that I shouldn‘t . . . be the one to decide\nthat somebody should die and other considerations that I put in the questionnaire.‖\nThe court subsequently asked, ―Could you ever vote for a penalty of death\ndepending upon the evidence and the law that I read to you?‖ Prospective Juror\nNo. 180 replied, ―I really think I would have a very hard time living with that\nvote.‖ The court said, ―Okay. That really wasn‘t my question. Okay. We‘ll get\nback to you.‖ Prospective Juror No. 180 said, ―Then I will say no.‖ The court\nsaid, ―I don‘t want you to say anything. I want you to tell me what your thoughts\nare.‖\n        During sequestered voir dire, the trial court noted Prospective Juror No. 180\nhad been through the process of voir dire with other jurors, and asked, ―Has your\nposition changed at all as to an appropriate penalty as to your ability to come up\nwith a penalty in this case?‖ Prospective Juror No. 180 answered, ―I don‘t think\nso.‖ The court asked, ―You would vote for a penalty of life without possibility of\nparole?‖ She answered, ―I think that is probably as high as I could go.‖ After\nfurther colloquy, the court asked, ―Could you ever vote for a penalty of death?‖\nProspective Juror No. 180 said, ―What I feel is . . . I might feel that the person\n\n                                           117\n\fdeserves that, but at the same time, I would feel that it is not for me to judge – it is\nnot for me to decide that. And that there are cases where it is not even handed.\nAnd I feel being in the situation, being forced to choose in the jury situation, that I\nwould find that extremely stressful. . . . I really don‘t think that in my conscience I\nwould want to vote for death. I think I might come to a place where . . . I could\nnot make any decision.‖ The court asked, ―Are you saying that you would either\nvote for life without possibility of parole or not even vote at all?‖ Prospective\nJuror No. 180 replied, ―I am saying that sometimes I find decision making\nextremely stressful. And it may be it might come to that. Sometime I get very\ndepressed when I have to make hard decisions.‖ The court asked, ―Your views on\nthe death penalty have not changed at all from the moment you came in until\nnow?‖ Prospective Juror No. 180 replied, ―No.‖\n     Defense counsel gave Prospective Juror No. 180 background on the weighing\nprocess at the penalty phase, and said that a juror was never required to vote for\ndeath. She then asked, ―In that framework . . . will you consider both of those\npenalties in making your decision, will you consider them both?‖ Prospective\nJuror No. 180 replied, ―I don‘t think I can.‖ Defense counsel urged Prospective\nJuror No. 180 not to get upset, and asked, ―[C]an you even consider both penalties\nbefore you make a decision?‖ She answered, ―I think, no, I can‘t.‖ Defense\ncounsel subsequently asked, ―Can you see yourself weighing aggravating and\nmitigating factors and finding the aggravating outweighing mitigating and\nconsidering death as a potential penalty?‖ Prospective Juror No. 180 replied, ―I\ncould consider it, but I don‘t want to vote for it.‖\n     The prosecutor asked Prospective Juror No. 180, ―Before you came in the\nother week, had you spent a lot of time thinking about [this issue] or not?‖ She\nreplied, ―I think about it. It is one thing to sit home and read about a crime and\nsay that person deserves to die, and it is another thing to sit there and be one of the\n\n                                          118\n\f12 people who says this person will die.‖ The prosecutor said, ―Right.‖\nProspective Juror No. 180 said, ―And I think I am pretty clear where I stand on\nthat.‖ After further colloquy, the prosecutor asked, ―The bottom line, Juror\nNumber 180, if you are back in the jury room, and even in your own mind you are\nsaying you know what, under the law this is a case that does deserve the death\npenalty, but you are not going to vote for the death penalty are you? That is the\nbottom line here, correct? Isn‘t that what you have been saying here all along?‖\nShe replied, ―I think so.‖\n     The prosecutor challenged Prospective Juror No. 180, and the defense\nattorney argued she was ―very, very equivocal,‖ and cause had not been\nestablished. The trial court sustained the challenge: ―See, that is the problem,\n[defense counsel], we know where it lies. We can play with words on the record\nall we want. Here is where it lies: This lady was very emotional and was to my\nquestions, to [defense counsel‘s] questions and to [the prosecutor‘s] questions,\nvery emotional. And if you watched her walk back to the jury room, she was near\ntears. We are talking about a stressful event. There is no way, no matter what the\nevidence, no matter what the law, that this lady could ever vote for a penalty of\ndeath. No way. Or vote at all. That is another problem. She indicated or vote at\nall. Not in those words, but that is the concept.‖\n\n                    2) Analysis\n     ―The federal constitutional standard for dismissing a prospective juror for\ncause based on his or her views of capital punishment is ‗ ―[w]hether the juror‘s\nviews would prevent or substantially impair the performance of his duties as a\njuror in accordance with his instructions and his oath.‖ ‘ ‖ (People v.

The\nrecord demonstrates that this prospective juror‘s responses were consistent with\nrespect to her ability to follow the law concerning imposition of the death penalty,\nand substantial evidence supports the court‘s ruling. Prospective Juror No. 180\nsaid she ―would not want the burden of knowing my decision put a person to\ndeath,‖ she could not consider both penalties before making a decision, and when\nasked if she could ever ―vote for a penalty of death depending upon the evidence\nand the law‖ she ultimately said ―[N]o.‖ Moreover, even if her responses could be\ndeemed equivocal, the trial court was in a position, which we are not, to view her\ndemeanor. ―Deference to the trial court is appropriate because it is in a position to\nassess the demeanor of the venire, and of the individuals who compose it, a factor\nof critical importance in assessing the attitude and qualifications of potential\njurors.‖ (Uttecht v. Brown, supra, 551 U.S. at p. 9.) The court observed that\nProspective Juror No. 180 was very emotional during questioning and near tears\nwhen she returned to the jury room, and concluded there was ―no way‖ she could\never vote for the death penalty. This determination of her state of mind is binding.\n\n                b. Defense challenges for cause\n     Defendant contends the trial court erred in denying a defense challenge to\nProspective Juror No. 254 for cause, in violation of his right to an impartial jury\nunder the Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the federal Constitution.\nFollowing the court‘s refusal to excuse Prospective Juror No. 254 for cause,\ndefendant used a peremptory challenge to excuse her.\n\n\n\n                                          120\n\f     Defendant has not preserved this claim on appeal because, as he concedes, he\ndid not use all of his peremptory challenges. (People v. Farley (2009) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2575291\"><a href=\"/opinion/2575291/people-v-farley/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1053</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1095-1096.) Defendant asserts that ―trial counsel had no reason to believe\nthat the exercise of additional peremptory challenges would produce a jury that\nwas more fairly disposed‖ because the trial court had improperly restricted voir\ndire, and consequently ―his ability to judge the qualifications of the panel was\nfatally impaired.‖ We have concluded above that the trial court did not improperly\nrestrict voir dire. (See ante, at pt. II.C.1.) Moreover, even assuming the trial court\nerred in denying the challenge for cause, defendant does not claim that any sitting\njuror was biased. ―So long as the jury that sits is impartial, the fact that the\ndefendant had to use a peremptory challenge to achieve that result does not mean\nthe Sixth Amendment was violated.‖ (Ross v.

Admission of other crimes evidence\n\n                a. Testimony of N.T.\n     Defendant contends the trial court erred in admitting the testimony of N.T.\nNot so.\n     At the first penalty trial, N.T. testified in a manner substantially similar to her\ntestimony at the second penalty phase trial. (See ante, at p. 24.) Before her\ntestimony at the retrial, defendant asserted that N.T.‘s testimony that she awoke to\nfind defendant trying to penetrate her vaginally and anally with a bottle did not\ndemonstrate a crime within the meaning of section 190.3, factor (b), and was\nunduly prejudicial because of its similarities to the circumstances of the capital\n\n\n\n                                          121\n\fcrime. The court, which had heard and since reread N.T.‘s testimony at the first\npenalty phase trial, admitted the evidence.\n     In determining whether to admit challenged other-crimes evidence, the trial\ncourt considers whether the prosecution has adduced substantial evidence to prove\neach element of the other crime activity. (People v. Griffin (2004) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">33</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">536</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n584; People v.

Boyer,\nsupra, 38 Cal.4th at p. 477, fn. 51.)\n     Here, defendant does not advance any reason why N.T.‘s testimony did not\ndescribe criminal activity, but merely asserts that no rational trier of fact would\nhave found N.T.‘s testimony true beyond a reasonable doubt. He relies on the\ncircumstances that her testimony was uncorroborated, no testimony was elicited\nfrom defendant that the incident ever took place, N.T. did not contemporaneously\nfile a complaint with law enforcement, and she had a motive to fabricate the\nincident because she was defendant‘s former girlfriend and ―displayed obvious\ndisdain and anger towards [defendant] during her testimony.‖ These\ncircumstances, however, merely demonstrate weaknesses in the testimony, not its\ninsufficiency.\n\n                 b. Alleged jail misconduct\n     Defendant contends the trial court erred in admitting evidence defendant\npossessed a shank in the Orange County jail. ― ‗It is settled that a defendant‘s\nknowing possession of a potentially dangerous weapon in custody is admissible\n\n\n\n                                         122\n\funder [section 190.3,] factor (b).

Defendant asserts, however, that we should\nreach a different result here because his possession of the shank was transitory,\nand ―his spotless disciplinary record in prison was utterly inconsistent‖ with any\nfinding other than ―he intended to use it, if at all, for self-defense and not to\nengage in criminal activity.‖ Neither defendant‘s explanation at trial that he did\nnot intend to use the weapon, but merely thought others would be less likely to\nattack him if they knew he was armed, nor the circumstance that defendant was\nnot cited for weapon possession on any other occasion, affects the admissibility of\nthe evidence. (Id., at pp. 1002-1003.)\n\n           4. Admission of victim impact testimony\n     Defendant contends the trial court erred in admitting victim impact testimony\nin violation of his rights under the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth\nAmendments to the federal Constitution, and analogous provisions of the state\nConstitution. We disagree.\n     ―Prior to 1991, evidence of a murder‘s impact on a victim and the victim‘s\nfamily and friends was not admissible in the penalty phase of a capital trial.\n(Booth v.

Admission of expert testimony regarding blackouts and defendant’s\n              mental state\n     Defendant contends the trial court erred in admitting the expert testimony of\nDr. Dietz on rebuttal in violation of his rights under the Fifth, Eighth, and\nFourteenth Amendments to the federal Constitution, and article I, sections 7, 15,\n17, and 24 of the state Constitution. We disagree.\n     During the defense penalty case, defendant testified he did not recall\ncommitting the murders, and defendant, Janice Hunt, and William Farmer testified\nto occasions on which defendant could not later remember events that occurred\nwhile he was drinking. In addition, Dr. Stalcup testified that during a blackout, an\nindividual generally has immediate memory or awareness of what he or she is\ndoing, but alcohol, tranquilizers, and barbiturates block the transfer of the memory\nto long-term memory. In moderate blackouts, individuals wake up the next day\nand cannot remember what they did the previous day, and in severe blackouts,\nindividuals cannot remember what they are doing at that moment. Father\nMcAndrew testified that blackouts are often symptomatic of the disease of\naddiction, and that he had experienced alcoholic blackouts, and was ashamed of\nthe things he was told he had done during them. Linda Lauer, a registered nurse\nand certified substance abuse counselor, testified that alcoholic blackouts are a\nhallmark symptom of alcoholism, and did not involve passing out, but more of a\n―walking amnesia.‖\n     On rebuttal, the prosecutor called Dr. Park Dietz, a clinical professor of\npsychiatry and biobehavioral sciences at the University of California at Los\nAngeles School of Medicine. Defendant objected to Dr. Dietz‘s testimony, and\nthe court held an evidentiary hearing at which Dr. Dietz testified outside the\n\n\n                                         125\n\fpresence of the jury. The court ruled that Dr. Dietz could testify as to what a\nblackout is, and that an individual in a blackout state would have a present\nmemory and act consciously, intentionally, and meaningfully in making choices.\nThe court precluded testimony regarding sexual sadism and the circumstance that\nsome individuals later reacquire memory of events that occurred while they were\nintoxicated. Although the record is unclear, the court also appeared to rule that\nDr. Dietz could not opine that based upon the crime scenes in this case the\nperpetrator‘s acts were voluntary and intentional. Dr. Dietz then testified before\nthe jury. (See ante, at pp. 39-40.)\n     Defendant contends that Dr. Dietz‘s testimony was inadmissible under\nEvidence Code section 801, subdivision (a), because the jury could easily draw the\nsame conclusions without an expert‘s testimony. As noted above, ―Evidence Code\nsection 801 qualifies a matter as the proper subject for expert testimony if it is\n‗sufficiently beyond common experience that the opinion of an expert would assist\nthe trier of fact.‘ That is not to say, however, that the jury need be wholly ignorant\nof the subject matter of the expert opinion in order for it to be admissible.\n[Citation.] Rather, expert opinion testimony ‗ ―will be excluded only when it\nwould add nothing at all to the jury‘s common fund of information, i.e., when ‗the\nsubject of inquiry is one of such common knowledge that men of ordinary\neducation could reach a conclusion as intelligently as the witness‘ ‖ [citation].‘ ‖\n(Jones, supra, 54 Cal.4th at p. 60.) Here, Dr. Dietz‘s testimony regarding what a\nblackout is, and what an individual is aware of during an event that he or she\ncannot later remember, was beyond the common experience of the jury and\nassisted it in determining defendant‘s culpability for his actions.\n     Defendant further contends that because no defense expert testified defendant\nwas in a blackout state during the crimes, Dr. Dietz‘s testimony was improper\nrebuttal. We disagree. As can be seen, during the defense case numerous lay and\n\n                                         126\n\fexpert witnesses testified regarding blackouts and defendant‘s apparent experience\nof such a phenomenon.\n     Defendant also contends that Dr. Dietz‘s testimony was substantially more\nprejudicial than probative or, phrased another way, that his testimony posed an\nintolerable risk to the fairness of the proceedings or the reliability of the outcome.\n(Riggs, supra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 290.) In particular, defendant contends the jury‘s\nfunction as the trier of fact on the issue of intent was usurped by Dr. Dietz‘s\nimpermissible expert opinion that defendant was in a conscious and deliberate\nframe of mind at the time of the homicide. Although defendant does not cite to\nthe record, we assume he is referring to Dr. Dietz‘s testimony: ―[A]s he is\ncommitting the homicides, . . . he is behaving intentionally [and] voluntarily. He\nknows where he is, what he is doing, who he is with, why he is engaging in each\naction, what he wants to do next, which things please him and which things don‘t.\n. . . Now, he may not know what he did five minutes ago or ten minutes ago. He\nmay be in a blackout already for those. But for what he just did and what he is\ngoing to do next, he is not in any blackout at all. He is right there in the present\ntense in the moment doing as he pleases.‖ The testimony was relevant to rebut the\napparent defense that because defendant was experiencing a blackout when he\ncommitted the offenses, he was less culpable. Nor was it unduly prejudicial.\nContrary to defendant‘s assertion, the testimony was in response to a hypothetical\nquestion by the prosecutor, and hence was not an expert opinion regarding\ndefendant‘s state of mind. Moreover, at the penalty phase the jury was no longer\nmaking factual determinations regarding defendant‘s intent, but rather was\ndetermining his appropriate sentence.\n\n\n\n\n                                         127\n\f           6. Exclusion of evidence of remorse and mitigating victim impact\n              testimony\n     Defendant contends the trial court erred in excluding testimony regarding\ndefendant‘s remorse, and testimony from Deeble‘s son that he did not want\ndefendant executed, in violation of his rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth\nAmendment to the federal Constitution. Not so.\n\n               a. Evidence of remorse\n     During the defense penalty case, Sergeant Morris testified that in 1993, while\ndefendant was at the Maui Community Correctional Facility, there were two\nescape attempts from defendant‘s housing area. As to the first escape, Morris\ntestified: ―There was an escape, and he wasn‘t even involved. He could have\ngone with them, I guess, but he chose not to.‖ Counsel asked, ―[D]id you find\n[defendant] still to be there and the other people gone?‖ Morris replied, ―Yes.‖\nCounsel asked, ―Did you ever discuss that with him?‖ Morris replied, ―I talked to\nhim. He says, I am going to do my time.‖ The prosecutor‘s hearsay objection was\nsustained. As to the second escape, counsel asked, ―And the second time did\n[defendant] go?‖ Morris said, ―No.‖ Counsel asked, ―Other inmates left the\nfacility?‖ Morris replied, ―Yes, they did.‖ The individuals who escaped were\nrecovered on both occasions.\n     Sergeant Aguiar similarly testified that in 1993 four inmates escaped from\ndefendant‘s module. Aguiar found defendant sitting in his cell with the door\nlocked. Counsel asked, ―Did he say anything at that time?‖ The trial court\nsustained the prosecutor‘s objection on grounds of relevance and hearsay. Aguiar\nsubsequently testified that at the time he saw defendant after the escape there were\nno guards in defendant‘s area. Defense counsel asked, ―So, in essence, there was\nnobody to stop [defendant] from leaving?‖ Aguiar replied, ―No, ma‘am.‖\nCounsel asked, ―But he remained behind?‖ Aguiar said, ―Yes, ma‘am.‖\n\n\n                                        128\n\f     Defendant testified that he now believed he had killed Deeble and Delbecq,\nalthough he had no recollection of their murders. Defendant felt ―horrible,‖\nfasted, meditated, and prayed on the dates of the murders, and ―always pray[ed]\nfor the families.‖\n     Family friend Bridget Briggs testified that when defendant arrived at the\nOrange County jail in 1994, he told Briggs that he ―didn‘t remember doing any of\nthe things that they were saying that he did. But if he did, . . . he should be\npunished accordingly.‖\n     Over the prosecutor‘s objection, Reverend Winter testified that sometimes\ndefendant would break down and cry because he said he did not remember what\nhe had done. Defendant said that if he had killed Delbecq, he was a ―monster.‖\nHe also said, ―if I had done that . . . it is horrible, I shouldn‘t be allowed to live in\nsociety.‖ Defendant would ask Winter ―to pray for the family,‖ and ―we would\npray together, and he would cry.‖ Defendant took full responsibility for his\naddiction, and did not offer drugs and alcohol as an excuse for his situation.\n       Later that same day, William Farmer, a friend of defendant‘s, testified that\nshortly after defendant‘s arrest in Hawaii he spoke with defendant by telephone.\nDefense counsel asked, ―[W]hat was it that he told you in that conversation?‖ The\nprosecutor‘s hearsay objection was sustained. Counsel argued that the testimony\nwent to defendant‘s state of mind. The court said, ―It‘s redundant.‖ Counsel then\nasked Farmer about a conversation he had with defendant while visiting him in\njail. Farmer asked defendant ―if he knew that he committed these crimes.‖\nCounsel asked, ―And what was his response?‖ The court sustained the\nprosecutor‘s objection that the question called for hearsay and was cumulative.\nCounsel asserted that this was ―the same issue we had this morning‖ on\ndefendant‘s state of mind. The court said, ―But you got it in this morning.‖\n\n\n\n                                           129\n\fCounsel said, ―This is a different witness.‖ The court said, ―The objection is\nsustained.‖\n       Lynn Pendzik subsequently testified that once while defendant was on trial\nin Hawaii he refused a visit with her. Defendant subsequently wrote to her:\n―Remember during the trial when it was at the most horrible testimony? You\ncame up that weekend and I refused your visit. Do you know why I did that? I\ndid it because I was utterly appalled by what they had shown in court and that I\nwas responsible for it. And I hated myself, and I felt that you certainly must hate\nme. I was ashamed and I did not want to face you.‖\n       Defendant‘s sister Elena testified that after defendant was arrested in\nHawaii, she visited him in jail every weekend. During one visit, defendant looked\ndown and told Elena, ―[I]f I did do this, I don‘t ever want to get out.‖\n       Near the end of the defense penalty case, Father McAndrew was asked by\ndefense counsel, ―In the conversations that you had with [defendant], did he ever\nexpress to you any remorse for the homicide that he was in custody here on?‖ The\nprosecutor‘s objection that the question called for hearsay and was cumulative was\nsustained. Counsel asked, ―Just with respect to the homicide in Los Alamitos that\noccurred in 1986, did he ever express any remorse to you?‖ The prosecutor‘s\nobjection on the same grounds was again sustained.\n       ―The Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments require that the sentencer in a\ncapital case not be precluded from considering any relevant mitigating evidence,\nthat is, evidence regarding ‗any aspect of a defendant‘s character or record and any\nof the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a\nsentence less than death.‘ ‖ (Frye, supra, 18 Cal.4th at p. 1015.) Nonetheless,\n―the United States Supreme Court never has suggested that this right precludes the\nstate from applying ordinary rules of evidence to determine whether such evidence\nis admissible.‖ (Smithey, supra, 20 Cal.4th at p. 995; see Romano v. Oklahoma\n\n                                         130\n\f(1994) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117851\"><a href=\"/opinion/117851/romano-v-oklahoma/\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 12 [―The Eighth Amendment does not establish a federal code\nof evidence to supersede state evidentiary rules in capital sentencing\nproceedings‖].)\n     Here, defendant relies on Green v.

Kaurish (1990)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1351466\"><a href=\"/opinion/1351466/people-v-kaurish/\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">648</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 704.) In Green, the evidence was ―highly probative of the\ndefendant‘s innocence.‖ (Smithey, supra, 20 Cal.4th at p. 996.) ―By contrast, we\nhave held that if the exculpatory value of the excluded evidence is tangential, or\ncumulative of other evidence admitted at trial, exclusion of the evidence does not\ndeny the accused due process of law.‖ (Ibid.) Here, even assuming reliability, the\nmitigating value of the excluded testimony was cumulative to the ample evidence\nof defendant‘s remorse adduced through the testimony of defendant, Bridget\nBriggs, Reverend Winter, Elena Edwards, and Lynn Pendzik. Hence, exclusion of\nthis testimony ―did not violate the Eighth Amendment or deprive defendant of due\nprocess of law.‖ (Id., at p. 997.)\n\n                b. Scott Deeble’s testimony\n     Scott Deeble, Marjorie Deeble‘s son, testified that in the 12 years since his\nmother‘s death, he had learned that ―I cannot appreciate the ecstasy of my joy if I\ndo not embrace the depth of my grief. I have learned the big lesson in\nforgiveness.‖ Counsel then asked Scott what he meant by forgiveness, and\nwhether he felt forgiveness for defendant, and after each question the court\nsustained the prosecutor‘s relevance objection. Scott subsequently was asked how\n\n\n\n                                          131\n\fhe had personally been affected by his mother‘s death. He replied that it was a\nhuge loss, ―[b]ut I‘ve had to search for . . . meaning. I‘ve had to . . . find what I\nneed in life. I need compassion and I need forgiveness. And I‘m only entitled if I\ndon‘t deny someone else the same.‖ The prosecutor objected, and the last portion\nof Scott‘s response was stricken. Counsel then asked if Scott felt ―sympathy or\ncompassion‖ for defendant. The prosecutor‘s objection was overruled, and Scott\nreplied, ―I do feel compassion.‖\n     Defendant contends that the trial court improperly precluded him from\nintroducing ―mitigating victim impact testimony.‖ The trial court‘s rulings did not\nprevent defendant from showing the jury the effect of the murder on Scott Deeble,\nwhich is all defendant was entitled to do under Penal Code section 190, factor (a).\n\n           7. Asserted prosecutorial misconduct\n     Defendant contends that the prosecutor committed prejudicial misconduct in\nviolation of his federal and state rights to a fair trial and reliable determination of\npenalty. We disagree. As noted above, ―A prosecutor commits misconduct when\nhis or her conduct either infects the trial with such unfairness as to render the\nsubsequent conviction a denial of due process, or involves deceptive or\nreprehensible methods employed to persuade the trier of fact.‖ (Avila, supra, 46\nCal.4th at p. 711.) In evaluating such a claim, we determine whether there is a\nreasonable likelihood the jury construed the remarks in an objectionable fashion.\n(Cash, supra, 28 Cal.4th at p. 733.) We conclude no prejudicial prosecutorial\nmisconduct occurred.\n\n                a. Dr. Dietz’s testimony\n     As noted above, the trial court allowed Dr. Dietz to testify on rebuttal\nregarding what a blackout is, and that an individual in a blackout state would have\na present memory and act consciously, intentionally, and meaningfully in making\n\n\n\n                                          132\n\fchoices. The court precluded testimony regarding sexual sadism and the\ncircumstance that some individuals later reacquire memory of events that occurred\nwhile they were intoxicated. Although the record is unclear, the court also\nappeared to rule that Dr. Dietz could not opine that based upon the crime scenes in\nthis case the perpetrator‘s acts were voluntary and intentional.\n     The prosecutor asked Dr. Dietz to consider the two murder scenes and the\nacts that were committed on the victims, and ―assuming that the defendant in this\ncase . . . is the perpetrator of both those crimes, has been found guilty by a jury\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, how would an alcoholic blackout, if he had been in\none, . . . have affected what he did during those murders?‖ After the court\noverruled defense counsel‘s foundation objection, Dr. Dietz answered that\nassuming defendant committed both homicides, and ―assuming that he now has no\nmemory whatsoever of either homicide‖ because of the effects of alcohol, ―that\nwould mean that he is now in a blackout for both homicides. But it doesn‘t tell us\nanything about his mental state at the time of the homicides except that he was\ndrunk.‖ Dr. Dietz continued, ―And looking at what happened in each homicide,\nwe learn a lot about his mental state at the time of the homicides that shows if\nintoxicated he wasn‘t too intoxicated to engage in a very orderly sequence of\ncomplicated behaviors.‖\n     The prosecutor subsequently asked, ―When you talk about the sequence of\nevents, you are referring to the various things . . . that were done to the two\nvictims, correct?‖ After the court overruled defendant‘s objection, Dr. Dietz\nreplied: ―The things done to gain access to each victim, to do things to the victims\nand their property and to leave the scene. The whole sequence of events.‖ The\nprosecutor then asked, ―[A]ssuming . . . that the defendant was in an actual —\nwhen he says he doesn‘t remember, assuming that that is truthful, you have said\nthat . . . the blackout does not affect his mental state while he was perpetuating the\n\n                                         133\n\facts?‖ Dr. Dietz replied, ―Correct, the blackout doesn‘t begin until later.‖ He\nexplained, ―[It] begins at least seconds after each action, maybe minutes, but the\nblackout is what he is later in. It is not something he is in while he is doing it.‖\n     The prosecutor subsequently asked, ―[S]o as he is committing the various\nacts during the homicide, how do we characterize his mental state at this point?‖\nDr. Dietz replied, ―Well as he is committing the homicides, I think it is fair to say\nthat he is behaving intentionally voluntarily. He knows where he is, what he is\ndoing, who he is with, why he is engaging in each action, what he wants to do\nnext, which things please him and which things don‘t. . . . Now, he may not know\nwhat he did five minutes ago or ten minutes ago, He may be in a blackout already\nfor those. But for what he just did and what he is going to do next, he is not in any\nblackout at all. He is right there . . . in the moment doing as he pleases.‖\n     At about this point, the prosecutor asked Dr. Dietz the two questions\ndefendant challenges on appeal. He first asked, ―[A]ssuming that the defendant\nlater suffered a blackout of these murders and as you mentioned that doesn‘t affect\nhim knowing what he is doing, an example of that would be . . . in the Maui\nhomicide, that there was a comforter placed up over the window that — so\nwhether he ever suffered a blackout or not, clearly at that moment he knows what\nhe is doing is wrong. He is trying to hide it from the outside world, correct?‖ The\ncourt overruled defense counsel‘s objection that the question called for speculation\nand lacked foundation. Dr. Dietz replied, ―Yes, that is correct.‖\n     The prosecutor then asked, ―Was there evidence that actually indicated to\nyou that this defendant did not suffer [a] blackout?‖ Dr. Dietz answered, ―Yes,‖\nand the prosecutor asked, ―[C]ould you tell us what that is?‖ Defense counsel\nobjected that the question was ―outside the scope.‖ At sidebar, the prosecutor\nexplained that he sought to elicit testimony apparently about the circumstance that\ndefendant was not in possession of any jewelry nor did he have any blood on him\n\n                                          134\n\fwhen he woke up the morning after the Deeble murder. The court ruled that the\ninquiry was ―highly speculative‖ because defendant could have disposed of these\nitems at or immediately after the murder and ―still have no memory of them,‖ and\ntherefore the inquiry sought information precluded by its earlier order.\n     Defendant contends that the prosecutor violated the court‘s order when he\nasked whether there was evidence defendant knew what he was doing when he\nplaced the comforter over the window. Defendant did not object on the ground\nthat the question sought information precluded by the court‘s order, and that claim\nis therefore forfeited on appeal. (See Schmeck, supra, 37 Cal.4th at p. 286.)\nMoreover, the question was simply a continuation of a line of questioning\nregarding a set of assumed facts that was proper under the court‘s ruling.\n     Defendant further contends that the prosecutor violated the court‘s order\nwhen he asked Dr. Dietz whether there was ―evidence that actually indicated to\nyou that this defendant did not suffer [a] blackout?‖ Contrary to defendant‘s\nassertion, Dr. Dietz did not opine that defendant did not suffer a blackout. Rather,\nhe testified that there was evidence to that effect, but never delineated what that\nevidence was or its relative strength. In any event, the court‘s order did not\npreclude opinion testimony that defendant was not in a blackout. Rather, it\nprecluded Dr. Dietz from testifying regarding ―reacquired memory‖ and how such\na phenomenon would demonstrate defendant did not experience a blackout. No\nmisconduct is apparent.\n     Defendant further contends that the prosecutor ―made extensive use of\nDr. Dietz‘s impermissible testimony during his closing argument.‖ We have\nconcluded the testimony was not impermissible. To the extent defendant also\nchallenges the prosecutor‘s argument that defendant‘s assertion he did not\nremember the crimes should not be credited, such argument was fair comment on\nthe state of the evidence and fell well ―within the bounds of the ‗wide latitude‘\n\n                                         135\n\fgiven to prosecutors during closing argument‖ at the penalty phase.

Claim prosecutor stated he had undisclosed knowledge of\n                    defendant’s guilt\n     Defendant contends the prosecutor committed misconduct when he explicitly\ntold the second penalty phase jury he had undisclosed knowledge of defendant‘s\nguilt. Not so.\n     In the challenged comment, the prosecutor said during his opening statement:\n―[T]here is not evidence at the [Deeble] crime scene that indicated the killer. The\npolice knew who the defendant was. They knew that he had dated the victim‘s\ndaughter, but at that point in time nothing linked him to the case. And I am telling\nyou this for a couple of reasons. Number one, I am not going to retry, as I\nmentioned to you folks early on, I am not going to retry the guilt phase of this\ncase. And you have accepted that he has been proven guilty. I am not going to\nbring in every bit of evidence. But I don‘t want to mislead you either, and I won‘t\ndo that. So although I am not bringing in all the evidence, I am not going to tell\nyou that there was something there that wasn‘t or leave you with that inference. I\ndon‘t want you to infer that either because all these years I mentioned to you that\ncase was unsolved.‖\n     Defendant did not object to this portion of the prosecutor‘s opening\nstatement, no exception to the general requirement of an objection is applicable,\nand his claim is therefore forfeited on appeal. (Schmeck, supra, 37 Cal.4th at\n\n\n                                           136\n\fp. 286.) The claim is also meritless. Nothing in the challenged comment indicates\nany ―undisclosed‖ knowledge of guilt. The prosecutor simply asserted that the\njury should not infer holes in the guilt phase evidence just because the prosecutor\nwas not presenting all of the guilt phase evidence, and that no physical evidence\ntied defendant to the crime scene. Moreover, the issue of defendant‘s guilt for the\ncapital crime was not before the jury.\n\n                c. Claim the prosecutor told the jury that Hawaii did not have the\n                   death penalty\n     During cross-examination of Jimmy Ekstrom, the prosecutor established that\nEkstrom had served only about six months in jail in Hawaii for vehicular\nmanslaughter. The prosecutor then asked Ekstrom, ―There‘s no death penalty in\nHawaii, is there?‖ The court sustained defense counsel‘s relevance objection.\nContrary to defendant‘s assertion, the prosecutor did not tell the jury that Hawaii\ndid not have a death penalty statute. The jury was instructed that statements by the\nattorneys during the trial were not evidence, and that ―[i]f an objection was\nsustained to a question, do not guess what the answer might have been.‖ We\npresume it followed these instructions. (Dement, supra, 53 Cal.4th at p. 36.)\n\n                d. Additional asserted misconduct during closing argument\n     Defendant asserts that the prosecutor made impermissibly inflammatory\nremarks during closing argument. Defendant did not object to these portions of\nthe prosecutor‘s argument, no exception to the general requirement of an objection\nis applicable, and his claim is therefore forfeited on appeal. (Schmeck, supra, 37\nCal.4th at p. 286.)\n     Moreover, ―[t]here is a wide range of permissible argument at the penalty\nphase.

Rather, we have held that ―the standard instructions on capital sentencing\nfactors, together with counsel‘s closing argument, are sufficient to convey the\nlingering doubt concept to the jury.‖ (Hartsch, at p. 513; see Thomas, at p. 826.)\nDefendant cites no persuasive reason to revisit this conclusion.\n\n                b. Circumstantial evidence instruction\n     Defendant requested, and the court gave, instruction in the modified language\nof CALJIC No. 2.02, which addresses the sufficiency of circumstantial evidence to\nprove a defendant‘s specific intent or mental state. Defendant did not request and\nthe jury was not instructed in the language of CALJIC No. 2.01, which generally\naddresses the sufficiency of circumstantial evidence to prove a defendant‘s guilt of\na crime. Defendant here contends the trial court erred in failing to so instruct the\njury sua sponte. Not so.\n     ―CALJIC No. 2.01 is required only where the prosecution substantially relies\non circumstantial evidence. ‗[W]here circumstantial inference is not the primary\nmeans by which the prosecution seeks to establish that the defendant engaged in\ncriminal conduct, the instruction may confuse and mislead, and thus should not be\ngiven.‘ ‖ (People v.

Here, at the penalty\nphase, neither the sexual assault of N.T., nor the observation of defendant with a\nshank in jail, relied on circumstantial evidence.\n     To the extent defendant claims the trial court should have instructed in the\nlanguage of CALJIC No. 2.01 because counsel argued a lingering doubt theory\nwith regard to the murder of Deeble, for which the evidence was circumstantial,\nthat assertion is also meritless. Because there is no federal or state right to an\ninstruction on lingering doubt (see ante, at pt.

(Dungo, at p.\n621.) This case demonstrates why the Dungo rule is unworkable.\n       In Dungo, as here, a witness described findings made by a nontestifying\npathologist. Both the majority and Justice Werdegar‘s concurring opinion in\nDungo emphasized that the statements attributable to the absent pathologist were\nlimited to ―anatomical and physiological observations‖ of the victim‘s body at the\nautopsy. (Dungo, supra, 55 Cal.4th at p. 619; id. at p. 621 (conc. opn. of\nWerdegar, J.).) Justice Werdegar suggested, ―[t]he process of systematically\nexamining the decedent‘s body and recording the resulting observations is . . .\ngoverned primarily by medical standards rather than by legal requirements of\nformality or solemnity‖ and that such observations do not ―resemble the ex parte\nexaminations of historical example or the structured police interrogations of\nCrawford [v. Washington (2004) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134724\"><a href=\"/opinion/134724/crawford-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">] and Davis [v. Washington (2006)\n547 U.S. 813].‖ (Dungo, at p. 624 (conc. opn. of Werdegar, J.).) The suggestion\nis that the recordation of medical observations is purely objective and mechanical.\nMy colleagues contrast them with medical conclusions, which result from\napplying a pathologist‘s expertise to a set of objective facts, in order to draw\n\n\n                                          1\n\fparticular conclusions. There is no debate that admission of testimony as to\nmedical conclusions reached by a nontestifying expert would violate the\nconfrontation clause. The Dungo majority and concurrences concluded, however,\nthat hearsay statements about medical observations may be admissible.\n       The line between an inadmissible statement amounting to a conclusion, and\nan admissible statement about an observation, is not as bright as Dungo suggests.\nThis case further blurs that distinction. As examples, Dr. Fukumoto testified\nregarding the following statements Dr. Richards made in his report. The victim\n(a) had suffered an incisional tear in her left eardrum, suggesting it had been\ncaused by a sharp instrument; (b) had ankle lacerations ―going in an upward\ndirection,‖ suggesting it was caused by a ligature; (c) had a ―crescent‖ on the\nbridge of her nose consistent with a fracture, even though Richards saw no\nindication of a fracture on an x-ray; and (d) had residue near her mouth consistent\nwith adhesive tape.\n       The defense contested all of these statements. Its expert, Dr. Wolf, testified\nthe victim‘s eardrums could have been torn from increased pressure during\nstrangulation, rather than incised by an instrument. Wolf concluded one could not\ndetermine whether a tear was ―incisional‖ without a microscopic examination,\nwhich Dr. Richards did not perform. Defense counsel argued that defendant could\nnot have had the intent to torture because he immediately rendered the victim\nunconscious by delivering a blow hard enough to break her nose. This scenario\nwas inconsistent with defendant binding the victim‘s ankles. Regarding the nose\ninjury, Dr. Fukumoto testified that Richards did not see a fracture on the X-ray.\nYet, Fukumoto testified he saw one, thus augmenting Richards‘s credibility.\nRichards had failed to obtain microscopic slides of the area or to make an incision\nthat might have confirmed a break. Finally, the defense noted that Richards never\ntested the substance on the victim‘s face to confirm the presence of an adhesive.\n\n                                          2\n\f       Even if some of Richards‘s statements can be accurately described as mere\nobservations, the underlined portions are clearly opinions or conclusions drawn\nfrom observations. The extensive testimony1 and argument2 regarding the\n\n1       At the guilt phase, the prosecutor began his questioning of Dr. Fukumoto\nregarding the autopsy by stating, ―I would like to go through with you some of Dr.\nRichards[‘s] specific findings, and I wanted to ask you some questions as well.‖\nThe prosecutor then repeatedly asked Fukumoto about Richards’s findings and\nconclusions. For example, Fukumoto testified that the victim had ―a break on the\nleft ear drum which was described by Dr. Richards as incisional in type. . . . It is\nnot a tear. It is something that is caused by a sharp instrument or an instrument\nthat has a point.‖ When asked how Richards described the victim‘s ankle\nlacerations, Fukumoto answered, ―He described them as being caused by the wires\nprobably coming together and inflicting the injury.‖ As to the victim‘s nose,\nFukumoto testified that ―[t]here was a crescent, in other words, in the area of the\nbridge of the nose, which was consistent to him [i.e., Richards] as fracturing of the\nbridge of the nose.‖ Fukumoto described Richards‘s findings as to the genital\nregion, noting ―the area of the vagina shows bruises primarily on the labia and also\nthe vaginal vault‖ and ―[t]here was hemorrhage as well as a laceration in the area\nof the posterior fourchette.‖ Fukumoto also recounted that Richards found\n―mucosal lacerations of the rectum‖ and that the anus was dilated, though\nRichards ―did not measure it.‖\n        On cross-examination, Dr. Fukumoto confirmed that Dr. Richards did not\nsee in an X-ray that the victim‘s nose was broken. Defense counsel inquired how\nFukumoto would have performed the autopsy differently from Richards, eliciting\nthat Fukumoto would have taken more measurements, produced more slide\nsamples, and made an incision in the victim‘s nose to confirm a break. Defense\ncounsel asked about a notation by Richards on one slide reflecting his finding of\nan ― ‗underlying submucosal hemorrhage‘ ‖ in the victim‘s vagina. Defense\ncounsel elicited that Richards made no notation regarding blood in the vagina or\nrectum, or damage to the victim‘s breasts. Defense counsel also sought\nclarification regarding Richards‘s findings as to the tear of the victim‘s eardrum\nand injuries to her vagina.\n        On redirect examination, the prosecutor sought to clarify that ―Dr. Richards\nin his summary doesn‘t say that there is maybe a fractured nose. He says there is a\nfractured nose; is that correct?‖ Dr. Fukumoto agreed. Fukumoto also agreed that\nRichards‘s report ―noted an area extending from the mouth over to the lower left\ncheek that appeared as a residual of adhesive tape.‖\n2       The prosecutor expressly relied upon Dr. Richards‘s credibility throughout\njury argument. For example, the prosecutor belittled the opinion of defense expert\n\n\n                                         3\n\fcredibility of the absent Richards shows how an application of Dungo can run\nafoul of the core purpose behind the confrontation clause. ― ‗The main and\nessential purpose of confrontation is to secure for the opponent the opportunity of\ncross-examination.‘ ‖ (Davis v.

Under the Roberts rule, hearsay\ncould be admitted if it bore ―adequate ‗indicia of reliability.‘ Reliability can be\ninferred without more in a case where the evidence falls within a firmly rooted\nhearsay exception.

The prosecutor stated Wolf was\n―quoting literature‖ in forming his opinions and did not ―hav[e] any experience.‖\nThe prosecutor noted that ―it came out very clearly that he is not a sheriff-coroner,\nnot working for the coroner‘s office,‖ and argued that ―[h]e hasn‘t seen what Dr.\nFukumoto had seen or what Dr. Richards had seen before he retired.‖ Similarly,\nwith respect to Wolf‘s opinion that it could not be determined whether the victim\nsuffered an incision to the eardrum, the prosecutor argued: ―Well, the autopsy\nsurgeon who did the autopsy, who is experienced in violent death autopsies says it\nis not. He talks about other injuries to the ears being tearing. He differentiates\nbetween the two. But he said the one injury was from a sharp instrument.‖ In\naddressing Wolf‘s assertion that the victim‘s vaginal injuries could not have been\nvisible to the eye, the prosecutor argued: ―When asked then what about the\ninjuries that were visible to Dr. Richards‘ eyes? Well, there weren‘t any of those.\nDr. Richards is wrong. That is the best [the defense] can do on this.‖\n\n\n                                           4\n\f―Reliability is an amorphous, if not entirely subjective, concept.

The majority here similarly rejects defendant‘s claim that Dr.\nFukumoto improperly recounted Dr. Richards‘s opinions about the ―incisional‖\ntear in the eardrum, the fractured nose, and the presence of adhesive tape residue\non the victim‘s face. The majority reasons: ―This testimony by Dr. Fukumoto did\nnot, however, recount Dr. Richards‘ opinions, but rather [Richards‘s] objective\nmedical observations.‖ (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 55.) The majority does not explain\nthe difference between ―objective medical observations‖ and ―opinions.‖ To do so\nundermines the analysis. That some substance is present on the face may be an\nobservation. That it is adhesive residue is a conclusion. That the eardrum is\nruptured may be an observation. That the wound was caused by a sharp\ninstrument is an opinion based on interpretation.\n       In light of Melendez-Diaz v.

(See Bullcoming, supra, 564 U.S. at p. __ [131 S.Ct. at p.\n2715 [―the comparative reliability of an analyst‘s testimonial report drawn from\nmachine-produced data does not overcome the Sixth Amendment bar‖]; Melendez-\nDiaz, supra, 557 U.S. at p. 318 [―Nor is it evident that what respondent calls\n‗neutral scientific testing‘ is as neutral or as reliable as respondent suggests.\nForensic evidence is not uniquely immune from the risk of manipulation.‖];\n\n                                           5\n\fDungo, supra, 55 Cal.4th at pp. 639-640 (dis. opn. of Corrigan, J.).) But even if\nthe distinction is permitted, Dr. Fukumoto repeatedly testified to Dr. Richards‘s\nhearsay statements recounting his observations. Defendant had the right to cross-\nexamine Richards on the methods and reasoning he used. It is ultimately the\njury‘s role to evaluate the credibility of the person who drew the conclusions and\ndecide for itself whether to accept them. (See Commonwealth v. Rivera (Mass.\n2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">981</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">171</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 189 [decided after Dungo; ― ‗[A] testifying medical\nexaminer called by the Commonwealth is not permitted to testify, on direct\nexamination, to the underlying factual findings contained in the autopsy report\nprepared by a different medical examiner, because such testimony would violate a\ndefendant‘s confrontation rights.‘ [Citations.]‖].)\n       In a decision after Dungo, the New Mexico Supreme Court recently\nreached a similar conclusion: ―[I]n material respects, the autopsy findings do not\ninvolve objective markers that any third party can examine in order to express an\nindependent opinion as to the existence or non-existence of soot or stippling. Such\nobservations are not based on any scientific technique that produces raw data, but\ndepend entirely on the subjective interpretation of the observer, who in this case\nwas [the nontestifying] Dr. Dudley. How Dr. Dudley reached the conclusion that\nthere was no evidence of soot or stippling on Reynaldo‘s body or clothing should\nhave been the subject of cross-examination. Inquiry into her training, the\nequipment used to arrive at her subjective conclusion, whether the evidence of\nsoot or stippling might have been masked by blood, or any other variables that\nwould influence her decision should have been tested in the crucible of cross-\nexamination.‖ (State v. Navarette (N.M. 2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">294</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">435</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 443.) Likewise,\nU.S. v. Ignasiak (11th Cir. 2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">667</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1217</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, reasoned: ―Medical examiners\nare not mere scriveners reporting machine generated raw-data. . . . [T]he\nobservational data and conclusions contained in the autopsy reports are the\n\n                                          6\n\fproduct of the skill, methodology, and judgment of the highly trained examiners\nwho actually performed the autopsy.‖ (Id. at p. 1232, fn. omitted.) Similarly, Dr.\nRichards‘s conclusions here depended on his skill and interpretation of what he\nsaw.\n       The majority acknowledges that Dr. Fukumoto recounted some of Dr.\nRichards‘s opinions, including that the victim was strangled to death and that her\nankle lacerations were caused by a wire ligature. However, the majority concludes\n―no prejudice was possible under any standard‖ because ―Dr. Fukumoto\nindependently agreed with Dr. Richards‘s opinions, and neither the cause of death\nnor the source of the lacerations on Deeble‘s ankle was in dispute at trial.‖ (Maj.\nopn., ante, at p. 55.) Such reasoning misses the mark. That Fukumoto reviewed\nmicroscopic slides and autopsy photographs in addition to Richards’s autopsy\nreport hardly establishes that Fukumoto derived his opinions ―independently‖ of\nRichards. As the West Virginia Supreme Court reasoned under similar\ncircumstances: ―[T]o the extent that Dr. Sabet served as a ‗transmitter‘ for Dr.\nLivingston‘s opinions regarding cause of death by reading or reiterating the\nconclusions contained from the report, such testimony is precisely the type of\n‗surrogate‘ testimony that is violative of the Confrontation Clause per Bullcoming.\nDr. Sabet‘s seeming concurrence with the cause of death, does not transform it\ninto his own opinion, capable of cross-examination sufficient for Confrontation\nClause purposes.‖ (State v. Kennedy (W.Va. 2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">735</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">905</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 920-921.)\nPhotos and X-rays are not hearsay. (See Evid. Code, §§ 225 [defining\n―statement‖]; 1200 [defining ―hearsay evidence‖].) Fukumoto could have\nexamined photos and X-rays and given his own opinion about their significance.\nWhat he could not do is tell the jury what the absent Richards concluded.\nFukumoto‘s testimony that his opinions were ―consistent‖ with Richards‘s served\nto bolster his own credibility based on hearsay not subject to cross-examination.\n\n                                         7\n\f       For the reasons set out in my Dungo dissent, Dr. Fukumoto‘s testimony\nviolated the confrontation clause because he relayed to the jury the observations\nand conclusions of the nontestifying autopsy pathologist. Dr. Richards‘s\nstatements were recorded in a six-page autopsy record and a two-page histology\nreport. Each page of both documents bears the letterhead of the Orange County\nSheriff‘s Department, and names Brad Gates as the sheriff-coroner. Each page\nbears the victim‘s name, the case number, and Richards‘s signature. The autopsy\nwas attended by a criminalist employed by the Orange County Sheriff-Coroner, as\nwell as two members each from the Orange County Sheriff‘s Department and the\nLos Angeles Police Department. These documents and the circumstances under\nwhich they were created indicate they were sufficiently formal and made with the\nprimary purpose of establishing facts for possible use in a criminal trial.\nAccordingly, they are testimonial hearsay. (Dungo, supra, 55 Cal.4th at pp. 634-\n646 (dis. opn. of Corrigan, J.).)\n       Dr. Fukumoto‘s testimony was prejudicial with respect to the torture-\nmurder special circumstance. ― ‗Confrontation clause violations are subject to\nfederal harmless-error analysis under Chapman v.

Nor did Fukumoto so limit his testimony. ―To prove a torture-\nmurder special circumstance, the prosecution must show that defendant intended\nto kill and had a torturous intent, i.e., an intent to cause extreme pain or suffering\nfor the purpose of revenge, extortion, persuasion, or another sadistic purpose.‖\n(People v. Streeter (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">205</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 237.) The prosecutor argued that\ndefendant achieved sexual pleasure from his victim‘s suffering, while the defense\nvigorously urged that defendant did not intend to torture. According to the\nprosecution, the victim‘s injuries reflected that she suffered extreme pain,\nincluding the ―incisional‖ tear to her eardrum, the deep furrows in her neck caused\nby struggling against the ligature, and bruising deep within the body cavity. The\ndefense urged that the evidence reflected the victim was struck in the face and\nrendered unconscious shortly after strangulation. The defense argued a person\nintending to torture would not immediately render his victim unconscious and\nimpervious to pain. The condition of the victim‘s body was critical evidence.\nFukumoto repeatedly recounted Dr. Richards‘s statements. As a result, deciding\nbetween the prosecution and defense theories depended in great measure on the\ncredibility and accuracy of Richards‘s reports.\n       However, the error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt in all other\nrespects. The defense did not contest that the victim had been strangled, instead\narguing defendant was not the killer or, alternatively, that he did not act with an\nintent to torture. Ample evidence aside from Dr. Fukumoto‘s testimony supported\nboth first degree felony murder based upon burglary and the burglary-murder\n\n                                           9\n\fspecial circumstance. The jury could have found burglary based upon an entry\nwith intent to steal or to commit sexual assault. Deeble‘s daughter identified\njewelry missing after Deeble‘s death, supporting an inference that defendant, who\nknew Deeble and had been in her home, entered the house with intent to steal.\nDeeble‘s body was found without underwear, with her legs spread apart, and her\nnightgown pushed above her waist. A mousse can was found nearby with\napparent blood on it, and a substance found on Deeble‘s leg could have been dried\nsemen. These circumstances suggest a sexual assault. Further, defendant‘s\nundisputed commission of a similar murder in Hawaii strongly supported a finding\nthat defendant entered Deeble‘s home with a similar intent.\n       In sum, this case illustrates the difficulty of applying Dungo‘s rule allowing\nadmission of testimony regarding ―objective facts‖ derived from an autopsy report\nby a pathologist who does not testify. The distinction between an admissible\nstatement of objective ―fact‖ and an inadmissible medical ―conclusion‖ is too\namorphous to be workable. Application of the confrontation clause should not\ndepend upon a court‘s judgment about which side of that blurry line a statement\nfalls. For the foregoing reasons, I would reverse the torture-murder special\ncircumstance and affirm the convictions in all other respects.\n                                                 CORRIGAN, J.\nI CONCUR:\nLIU, J.\n\n\n\n\n                                         10\n\fSee next page for addresses and telephone numbers for counsel who argued in Supreme Court.\n\nName of Opinion People v.
