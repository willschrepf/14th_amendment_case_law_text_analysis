The district court abused its discretion in failing to follow the test\n         established by the Supreme Court of Texas for determining\n         reasonable attorney’s fees. ............................................................................... 7\n         A.        The Supreme Court of Texas has directed that a reasonable\n                   fee is fair and moderate, not excessive or extreme. ..............................7\n         B.        There is very little disagreement in the record about what\n                   an award of reasonable fees should be. ...............................................10\n                   1.       Time and labor required, novelty and difficulty of\n                            the questions, skill required to perform the legal\n                            services properly .......................................................................10\n                   2.       Likelihood that the acceptance of the particular\n                            employment will preclude other employment by the\n                            lawyer ........................................................................................14\n                   3.       Fee customarily charged in the locality for similar\n                            legal services .............................................................................14\n                   4.       Amount involved and results obtained .....................................15\n                   5.       The time limitations imposed by client or\n                            circumstances ............................................................................16\n                   6.       Nature and length of professional relationship\n                            between lawyer and client .........................................................16\n                   7.       Experience, reputation, and ability of the lawyers ...................17\n                   8.       Whether the fee is fixed or contingent on results\n                            obtained or uncertainty of collection ........................................17\n\n                                                             ii\n\f      C.     The district court failed to apply the law correctly and\n             acted without reference to guiding principles. ....................................17\nII.   The district court’s judgment must be reversed because there is\n      no evidence to support Findings of Fact 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. ............................... 20\n      A.     The district court abused its discretion and failed to apply\n             the law correctly in sustaining Abraham’s objections. .......................21\n             1.       There is evidence of the fees customarily charged in\n                      the locality for similar services. ................................................22\n             2.       Sullivan offered ample evidence from which both\n                      Abraham and the district court could engage in a\n                      meaningful review of the fees sought. ......................................22\n             3.       It was an abuse of discretion to sustain Abraham’s\n                      testimonial objections. ..............................................................23\n             4.       Blended rates are commonplace and comply with\n                      the Texas Disciplinary Rules. ...................................................24\n             5.       Abraham’s litigation tactics, not the amounts\n                      Sullivan seeks, disincentivize the cessation of\n                      litigation. In any event, this is not a recognized basis\n                      for a legal objection...................................................................25\n      B.     There is no evidence to support Findings of Fact 5, 6, 7, 8,\n             and 9. ...................................................................................................26\n             1.       Salem Abraham sued Sullivan for defamation\n                      despite knowing prior to filing suit that Sullivan was\n                      not Greer’s source. ....................................................................26\n             2.       No evidence supports a relationship between\n                      Sullivan and Greer such that it was proper to infer\n                      that Sullivan could have been Greer’s source...........................28\n             3.       The award to Michael Quinn Sullivan of $35,000 in\n                      attorney’s fees through remand from the Supreme\n                      Court relies on an incorrect legal standard and has\n                      no evidence to support it. ..........................................................29\n             4.       The award to Michael Quinn Sullivan of $7,200 in\n                      attorney’s fees for work after remand relies on an\n                      incorrect legal standard and has no evidence to\n                      support it. ..................................................................................31\n\n\n                                                       iii\n\fIII.     In Findings of Fact 8 and 9, the trial court reversibly erred by\n         commingling in a broad-form finding multiple damages elements\n         that are legally insufficient. ........................................................................... 32\n         A.       Reversible error is presumed under Casteel and its\n                  progeny. ...............................................................................................32\n         B.       Casteel and its progeny apply to findings of fact................................33\n         C.       Finding of Fact 8 .................................................................................35\n         D.       Finding of Fact 9 .................................................................................39\nIV.      The district court erred in failing to award conditional appellate\n         attorney’s fees. ............................................................................................... 42\nConclusion and Prayer .............................................................................................44\nCertificate of Compliance ........................................................................................46\nCertificate of Service ...............................................................................................46\nAppendix\n     Tab A                           Final Judgment, signed February 27, 2017\n         Tab B                       Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\n         Tab C                       Motion to Abate Appeal for Findings of Fact and\n                                     Conclusions of Law\n         Tab D                       Order of July 5, 2017, denying Motion to Abate\n         Tab E                       Order Awarding Attorney Fees and Sanctions, McGibney\n                                     v.

(CR2:439; CR1:768).\nTrial Court information:    31st Judicial District Court,\n                            Hemphill County, Texas\n                            The Honorable Steven Emmert\nCourse of proceedings:      The trial court dismissed Salem Abraham’s\n                            defamation claim, awarded approximately 10% of\n                            the attorney’s fees, costs, and expenses sought by\n                            Michael Quinn Sullivan, and refused to award any\n                            sanction against Salem Abraham. (CR1:768–69).\n                            In the first appeal, this Court reversed in part,\n                            holding that an award of sanctions was mandatory\n                            under the TCPA. Sullivan v. Abraham, 472 S.W.3d\n                            677, 683 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 2014), re’vd on\n                            other grounds, 488 S.W.3d 294 (Tex. 2016). The\n                            Court affirmed the remainder of the judgment.\n                            The Supreme Court of Texas reversed, holding that\n                            considerations of justice and equity do not inform\n                            an award of costs or reasonable attorney’s fees\n                            under the TCPA. Sullivan v. Abraham, 488 S.W.3d\n                            294, 299–300. The supreme court remanded for an\n                            award of costs, reasonable attorney’s fees, other\n                            expenses as justice and equity require, and a\n                            sanction.\nTrial Court disposition:    On remand, the trial court awarded Michael Quinn\n                            Sullivan $35,000 in attorney’s fees for services\n                            performed prior to remand by the Supreme Court of\n                            Texas, $7,200 in attorney’s fees for services\n                            performed after remand by the Supreme Court of\n                            Texas, $1,621.60 in costs, $17,240.03 in other\n                            expenses as justice and equity require, and a\n                            $15,000 sanction against Abraham. (CR2:439–40).\n\n\n\n                                        xi\n\f                      ISSUES PRESENTED\n\n1.   The trial court abused its discretion because it misapplied\n     the law and acted without reference to guiding principles\n     in awarding an extreme and excessively low amount of\n     reasonable attorney’s fees to Michael Quinn Sullivan.\n\n2.   No evidence supports the trial court’s award of $35,000\n     in attorney’s fees as damages before remand.\n\n3.   No evidence supports the trial court’s award of $7,200 in\n     attorney’s fees as damages after remand.\n\n4.   The trial court reversibly erred in commingling legally\n     insufficient damage elements with the broad-form\n     damage finding in Finding of Fact 8.\n\n5.   The trial court reversibly erred in commingling legally\n     insufficient damage elements with the broad-form\n     damage finding in Finding of Fact 9.\n\n6.   The trial court reversibly erred in failing to award\n     conditional appellate fees.\n\n\n\n\n                                 xii\n\f                            STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n      This defamation case was dismissed under Chapter 27 of the Texas Civil\n\nPractice and Remedies Code, the Texas Citizens Participation Act (TCPA). Salem\n\nAbraham sued Michael Quinn Sullivan based upon Abraham’s speculation that\n\nSullivan was the source for a news article regarding Abraham’s activities at a\n\npolitical rally. (CR1:5).\n\n      The rally was a campaign event for then-State Representative Jim\n\nLandtroop. Abraham, a member of the board of trustees of the Canadian\n\nIndependent School District, attended the event as a public servant to “make the\n\ntrue facts known” about an ongoing debate in the campaign. (CR1:6–9). The\n\ncontroversy was whether Landtroop’s opponent increased spending while serving\n\non the board of CISD. (CR1:615).\n\n      Daniel Greer, a reporter for AgendaWise, who did not attend the event,\n\nreported on Abraham’s activities in a July 27, 2012 article. (CR1:9–10, 17). In the\n\narticle, statements were made indicating that Abraham was asked to leave the\n\nmeeting for improper conduct. (CR1:17).\n\n      In August 2012, Abraham contacted Greer and requested a correction to the\n\narticle. (CR1:11). Despite Greer’s making the correction, Abraham sued Greer and\n\nAgendaWise. (CR1:18–19, 537). Salem Abraham v. Daniel Greer & Fix the Facts\n\fFoundation d/b/a AgnedaWise (31st Dist., Hemphill Cnty.) (hereinafter “First\n\nLawsuit”).\n\n      Abraham’s First Lawsuit was dismissed under the TCPA. (CR1:534 Ex. 2 &\n\n3). On appeal, the Supreme Court of Texas clarified the constitutional standard for\n\napplying the New York Times actual malice rule to public officials in the context of\n\npublication on the internet of allegedly defamatory statements, and remanded to\n\nthis Court for a determination of Abraham’s open-courts and due process\n\nchallenges. Greer v. Abraham, 489 S.W.3d 440 (Tex. 2016). This Court held that\n\n(1) Abraham did not preserve his complaint regarding Greer’s invocation of the\n\njournalist’s privilege, (2) Abraham did not preserve his argument that the district\n\ncourt erred in ruling that Greer and AgendaWise were journalists, and (3) neither\n\nthe TCPA, nor the Reporter’s Shield Law, nor the two working in concert violate\n\nthe Open Courts provision of the Texas Constitution. Abraham v. Greer, 509\n\nS.W.3d 609, 612, 613, 617 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 2016, pet. denied).\n\n      In April 2013, Abraham filed this lawsuit based on the same statements as in\n\nthe dismissed First Lawsuit. (CR1:5). Abraham alleged that Sullivan could have\n\nbeen the source who provided information about Abraham’s activities at the rally\n\nto Greer and AgendaWise. (CR1:14). Abraham admitted in his petition that there\n\nwas no evidence that Sullivan was Greer’s source or that the two ever discussed\n\nAbraham. It is also undisputed that, like Greer, Sullivan was not in attendance at\n\n\n\n                                         2\n\fthe Levelland rally. Abraham alleged only that “it is a reasonable inference that the\n\nperson informing Daniel Greer about Salem [Abraham] was Michael Quinn\n\nSullivan” because they have daily discussions about politics. (CR1:15). Greer set\n\nthe record straight in Abraham’s First lawsuit when he testified that Sullivan did\n\nnot tell him anything about the Levelland meeting. (RR1:7–9).\n\n         Sullivan moved to dismiss this lawsuit under the TCPA. (CR1:534).\n\nPursuant to section 27.009 of the TCPA, Sullivan also requested reasonable\n\nattorney’s fees, costs, expenses, and a sanction against Abraham.1 (CR1:544, 732–\n\n38).\n\n         After conducting an evidentiary hearing, the trial court dismissed Abraham’s\n\ndefamation claim under the TCPA. (CR1:768). However, the trial court awarded\n\nSullivan only $6,500 in attorney’s fees and $1,500 in costs and expenses—a small\n\nfraction of the fees, costs, and expenses that Sullivan proved. (CR1:768).\n\nSullivan appealed the award of attorney’s fees, costs, and expenses, as well as the\n\ntrial court’s refusal to award any sanctions, which the TCPA makes mandatory.\n\nThis Court affirmed in part and reversed and remanded in part. Sullivan v.\n\nAbraham, 472 S.W.3d 677 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 2014), rev’d in part, 488 S.W.3d\n\n294 (Tex. 2016). This Court affirmed the $6,500 attorney’s fees award on the basis\n\nthat considerations of equity and justice inform the determination of an attorney’s\n\n1\n    TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE § 27.009.\n\n\n\n                                            3\n\ffees award under the TCPA. Id. at 682. This Court also concluded that Sullivan’s\n\nevidence had not detailed every task performed and did not reflect the prevailing\n\nlegal rates in the Texas Panhandle. Id. at 683. The Court then remanded for the\n\ntrial court to award Sullivan mandatory sanctions against Abraham. Id. at 683.\n\n      The Supreme Court of Texas reversed, holding that considerations of justice\n\nand equity do not inform the determination of an award of reasonable attorney’s\n\nfees under the TCPA. Sullivan v. Abraham, 488 S.W.3d 294, 298–99 (Tex. 2016).\n\nThe case was then remanded to the trial court for a determination of (1) costs, (2)\n\nreasonable attorney’s fees, and (3) other expenses as justice and equity require, (4)\n\nplus a sanction against Abraham in an amount sufficient to deter him from filing\n\nfrivolous lawsuits in the future. Id. at 300.\n\n      On remand, Sullivan offered detailed time entries that identified the work\n\nperformed, the time required, the date on which the work was performed, the\n\nlawyer who performed the work, and that lawyer’s hourly rate. (CR2:33–69). In\n\ntotal, Sullivan sought:\n\n      $1,621.60            in costs;\n\n   $296,805.00             in attorney’s fees before remand;\n\n     $12,358.50            in attorney’s fees after remand by the Supreme Court of\n                           Texas;\n\n      $17,240.03           in other expenses incurred by Sullivan that justice and\n                           equity require to be awarded.\n\n\n\n                                            4\n\f(CR2:412, 420).\n\n          The district court conducted another evidentiary hearing. This time, the trail\n\ncourt awarded Sullivan:\n\n         $1,621.60               in costs;\n\n        $35,000.00               in attorney’s fees from the beginning of the case\n                                 until remand by the Supreme Court of Texas;\n\n         $7,200.00               in attorney’s fees after remand by the Supreme\n                                 Court of Texas; and,\n\n        $17,240.03               in other expenses incurred by Sullivan that justice\n                                 and equity require to be awarded.\n\n(CR2:439–40).2\n\n          Sullivan timely requested Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law.\n\n(CR2:441). The trial court’s Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, which were\n\ndrafted by Abraham, were filed on March 20, 2017. (CR2:443). Sullivan then\n\ntimely objected to the trial court’s Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and\n\nrequested additional and amended findings and conclusions. (CR2:447). The trial\n\ndid not amend or supplement its findings and conclusions as requested by Sullivan\n\nand thus overruled Sullivan’s objections.3 This appeal ensued. (CR2:480).\n\n\n\n\n2\n Pursuant to the judgment, post-judgment interest at the rate of 5% per annum accrues on all\namounts awarded until paid. (CR2:439–40)\n3\n    See TEX. R. APP. P. 33.1(a)(2).\n\n\n\n                                                5\n\f      Sullivan moved to abate the appeal for remand to the district court for entry\n\nof more specific findings of fact and conclusions of law. (App. C) This Court\n\ndenied Sullivan’s motion to abate on July 4, 2017. (App. D)\n\n                       SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\n      The district court had a mandatory duty to exercise sound discretion in\n\nawarding Michael Quinn Sullivan reasonable attorney’s fees pursuant to the Texas\n\nCitizens Participation Act (TCPA) and the mandate of the Supreme Court of\n\nTexas. A reasonable fee is one that is moderate and fair, not excessive or extreme.\n\nThe district court awarded an excessively low and extreme fee of $35,000 for legal\n\nservices performed from the inception of this case through an appeal to this Court\n\nand an appeal to the Supreme Court of Texas, and $7,200 for legal services\n\nperformed on remand from the supreme court. This was an abuse of discretion\n\nbecause the trial court acted without reference to guiding principles—the test\n\nestablished by the Supreme Court of Texas, the Arthur Andersen factors, and the\n\nevidence adduced by the parties.\n\n      Also, no probative evidence supports Findings of Fact 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9,\n\nwhich themselves emanate from several reversibly erroneous evidentiary rulings.\n\nThere is simply no way for a reasonable factfinder to consider the record in this\n\ncase and reach the decision that the trial court reached.\n\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\f      Reversal is required for the additional reason that the broad-form damages\n\nfindings in Findings 8 and 9 commingle invalid and/or legally insufficient elements\n\nof damages, in violation of Crown Life Ins. Co. v. Casteel and its progeny. Finally,\n\nthe trial court reversibly erred in refusing to award Michael Quinn Sullivan\n\nconditional appellate fees. When an award of trial court attorney’s fees is made\n\nmandatory by statute, conditional appellate attorney’s fees in an amount supported\n\nby the evidence are also mandatory.\n\n                                  ARGUMENT\n\nI.     The district court abused its discretion in failing to follow the test\n       established by the Supreme Court of Texas for determining reasonable\n       attorney’s fees.\n\n      A.    The Supreme Court of Texas has directed that a reasonable fee is\n            fair and moderate, not excessive or extreme.\n\n      The supreme court held in this case that the TCPA requires an award of\n\nreasonable attorney’s fees to a successful movant. Sullivan v. Abraham, 488\n\nS.W.3d 294, 299 (Tex. 2016). The supreme court therefore remanded this case to\n\nthe district court for determination of reasonable attorney’s fees, with the\n\ninstruction that a reasonable attorney’s fee “‘is one that is not excessive or\n\nextreme, but rather moderate or fair.’” Id. (citing Garcia v. Gomez, 319 S.W.3d\n\n638, 642 (Tex. 2010)). Reasonable means fair, proper, or moderate under the\n\ncircumstances. Garcia v. Gomez, 319 S.W.3d 638, 642 n.3 (Tex. 2010) (citing\n\nReasonable, BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY 1272 (7th ed. 1999)).\n\n\n                                         7\n\f      The reasonableness of a fee award requires a factfinder to consider the\n\nfactors set out in Arthur Andersen & Co. v. Perry Equipment Corp. 945 S.W.2d\n\n812, 818 (Tex. 1997). Those factors include:\n\n      (1)   the time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the\n            questions involved, and the skill required to perform the legal\n            services properly;\n\n      (2)   the likelihood that the acceptance of the particular employment\n            will preclude other employment by the lawyer;\n\n      (3)   the fee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal\n            services;\n\n      (4)   the amount involved and the results obtained;\n\n      (5)   the time limitations imposed by the client or by the\n            circumstances;\n\n      (6)   the nature and length of the professional relationship with the\n            client;\n\n      (7)   the experience, reputation, and ability of the lawyer or lawyers\n            performing the services; and,\n\n      (8)   whether the fee is fixed or contingent on results obtained or\n            uncertainty of collection before the legal services have been\n            rendered.\n\n945 S.W.2d at 818; TEX. DISCIPLINARY R. PROF’L CONDUCT 1.04. A party seeking\n\nto recover a reasonable attorney’s fee under the lodestar method must offer\n\nevidence of the services performed, who performed them and at what hourly rate,\n\nwhen they were performed, and how much time the work required. Long v. Griffin,\n\n\n\n\n                                        8\n\f442 S.W.3d 253, 255 (Tex. 2014). This information provides the trial court\n\nsufficient information to review a fee request. Id.\n\n      For example, when an attorney testified that she used a billing system to\n\ntrack and bill her time in a case, that she had billed her client for her work, and\n\nspecified the number of hours she had spent on the case as well as the hourly rate\n\nin her client contract, the supreme court held that was sufficient evidence on which\n\nto base an award of attorney’s fees. City of Lardeo v. Montano, 414 S.W.3d 731,\n\n737 (Tex. 2013).\n\n      The reasonableness of an award of attorney’s fees is ordinarily left to the\n\nsound discretion of the factfinder, and a reviewing court may not substitute its\n\njudgment for that of the factfinder. Expelled Grain Prods., LLC v. Corn Mill\n\nEnters, LLC, No. 07-14-00398-CV, 2016 WL 4413323, at *9 (Tex. App.—\n\nAmarillo Aug. 17, 2016, pet. denied). To calculate reasonable attorney’s fees, the\n\nfactfinder should multiply the number of hours worked by the attorney’s hourly\n\nrate. Lopez v. Bailon, No. 07-14-00442-CV, 2016 WL 4158034, at *5 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Amarillo Aug. 4, 2016, no pet.).\n\n      Sullivan provided far more evidence than the supreme court approved in\n\nMontano. He offered detailed time entries from the inception of the case through\n\nproceedings on remand. (CR2:36–59, 419–20). Sullivan also offered expert\n\ntestimony regarding the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved; the skill\n\n\n\n                                          9\n\frequired to perform the legal services properly; the fees customarily charged for\n\nsimilar services (including fees customarily charged in the locality); the amount\n\ninvolved and the results obtained; the time limitations imposed; and, the\n\nexperience, reputation, and ability of the lawyers performing the services.\n\n(CR2:66–67, 414–17).\n\n      B.    There is very little disagreement in the record about what an\n            award of reasonable fees should be.\n\n            1.     Time and labor required, novelty and difficulty of the\n                   questions, skill required to perform the legal services\n                   properly\n\n      Despite the vitriol, the record before the district court does not disclose\n\nsignificant disagreement about what a reasonable attorney’s fee award should be in\n\nthis case. Mr. Lovell, Abraham’s expert on attorney’s fees, opined that the number\n\nof “hours incurred by an opposing party in litigation” is “relevant evidence to\n\nconsider in determining” a reasonable attorney’s fee. (CR2:86 ¶39). Abraham’s\n\nexpert then compares the hours Abraham’s lawyer spent on this litigation to those\n\nspent by Sullivan’s counsel, offering the hours Abraham’s lawyers spent on the\n\ncase as a yardstick by which to measure reasonableness. (CR2:86 ¶¶39–40;\n\nCR2:100).\n\n      Attorneys for the respective parties spent, apples to apples, a very similar\n\nnumber of hours on this case—except when Abraham’s legal team spent far more\n\nhours on the case. In the original trial court proceedings, Abraham’s counsel spent\n\n\n                                        10\n\f177.2 hours on the case in addition to 23.85 paralegal hours. (CR2:82). Sullivan’s\n\ncounsel spent 140.9 hours on the case during that same period. (CR2:59, 82). The\n\nonly quibble Abraham ever offered about the number of hours Sullivan’s counsel\n\nspent on this case in the original trial court proceedings pertained to 16 hours of\n\nattorney time incurred on a Motion to Recuse. (CR2:87).4 Accordingly, there is no\n\nreasonable disagreement in the record about the reasonableness of Sullivan’s legal\n\nteam spending 141 hours on this case in the original trial court proceedings—\n\nduring which time Abraham’s legal team spent 201 hours.\n\n      The record discloses no meaningful criticism or dispute by Abraham about\n\nthe reasonableness of the number of hours Sullivan’s counsel spent on this case in\n\nthe original trial court proceedings. Nor, in light of the evidence, could there be.\n\n(CR2:86 (Abraham admitting that his counsel’s hours are relevant to determining\n\nhours reasonably spent and using his counsel’s time as a yardstick by which to\n\nmeasure the time Sullivan’s counsel spent on the case))\n\n      In the earlier proceedings in this Court:\n\n          • Abraham’s legal team spent 127.85 hours; and,\n\n          • Sullivan’s attorneys spent 172.3 hours.\n\n\n\n\n4\n  In total, Sullivan’s counsel incurred $6,187.50 in legal fees on the Motion to Recuse.\n(CR2:405) Abraham never disputed that this amount was incurred on that Motion.\n\n\n\n                                          11\n\f(CR2:82). This discrepancy was reasonably explained by the fact that, as the\n\nappellant, Sullivan reasonably filed a reply brief. Comparing apples to apples, the\n\nhours spent by the parties on their respective principal briefs and oral argument are\n\nremarkably similar:\n\n          • Abraham’s legal team spent 127.85 hours; and,\n\n          • Sullivan’s attorneys spent 131.2 hours.\n\n(CR2:406–07). The 41-hour discrepancy between the two sides’ hours is due\n\nentirely to the reply brief, as a meaningful examination of the detailed time entries\n\ndemonstrates. (CR2:407). No facts or evidence tend to contradict this explanation.\n\n      The hours the parties spent on this case in the Supreme Court of Texas\n\nfollow the same pattern. For the petition, response, the respective principal merits\n\nbriefs, and oral argument:\n\n          • Abraham’s legal team spent 250.72 hours; and,\n\n          • Sullivan’s attorneys spent 246.2 hours.\n\n(CR2:407). The difference in the overall number of hours spent by the parties is\n\nentirely accounted for by the Reply in Support of Sullivan’s Petition for Review\n\n(51 hours) and Sullivan’s Reply Brief on the Merits (92.7 hours). (CR2:407).\n\nSullivan pointed out in detail to the district court that the discrepancies in the hours\n\nspent on this case were explained by the preparation and filing of replies (which\n\nappellants and petitioners are required to do under the Rules of Appellate\n\n\n                                          12\n\fProcedure). (CR2:405–07). No facts or evidence tends to contradict this\n\nexplanation.\n\n      Accordingly, on the record before the district court, there was no meaningful\n\ndispute about the reasonableness of Sullivan’s counsel’s having spent 128 hours on\n\nthis case in the original district court proceedings, or 131.2 hours on this case in the\n\nfirst appeal in this Court, or 246.2 hours in the Supreme Court of Texas.\n\n      Regarding the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved and the skill\n\nrequired to perform the legal services properly, it cannot be escaped that, on the\n\nevidence before the district court, this Court had never used the term “anti-SLAPP”\n\nin an opinion, and had cited Section 27.003 only once—in Abraham’s case against\n\nDaniel Greer. (CR2:415). Abraham v. Greer, 474 S.W.3d 731 (Tex. App.—\n\nAmarillo 2014), rev’d, 484 S.W.3d 440 (Tex. 2016). The district court’s decision\n\nin this case was reversed in part by this Court, and in other respects by the\n\nSupreme Court of Texas. Prior to the supreme court’s clarification of Texas law in\n\nthis case, there was considerable confusion among courts of appeal in Texas about\n\nwhat considerations inform a determination of reasonable attorney’s fees under the\n\nTCPA and how to review those awards. See, e.g., Rauhauser v. McGibney, 508\n\nS.W.3d 377, 389–90 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2014, no pet.); Cruz v. Van Sickle,\n\n452 S.W.3d 503, 526 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2014, pet. denied). On these facts, any\n\n\n\n\n                                          13\n\fsuggestion that the issues involved were not novel or the services required were not\n\ndifficult, (CR2:90), cannot be entertained.5\n\n              2.      Likelihood that the acceptance of the particular\n                      employment will preclude other employment by the lawyer\n\n       Abraham’s expert opined that, because the likelihood that Sullivan’s\n\nattorneys would ever be retained by Abraham, this factor did not merit an upward\n\nadjustment of fees. (CR2:91). Sullivan did not seek an upward adjustment of fees\n\nbased on this factor. (CR2:66).\n\n              3.      Fee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal\n                      services\n\n       There is little disagreement about rates in the record, too. Abraham admitted\n\nthat a rate of $375 would be reasonable for an experienced attorney, and $225\n\nwould be reasonable for an associate. (CR2:91). In the context of the evidence,\n\nAbraham complained about partner rates in the district court and in this Court, and\n\nabout associate rates in the supreme court. Even if the district court agreed with\n\nAbraham’s expert’s testimony about rates, the evidence supports, at most, an 8%\n\ndiscount—$24,528 off of the $296,805 in fees at issue. (CR2:404–05).\n\n\n5\n  Indeed, the statistics from the Texas Office of Court Administration demonstrate that it is\nextraordinarily difficult to convince the Supreme Court of Texas to grant a petition for review,\nlike Sullivan did in this case. The supreme court grants only about 11% of the petitions filed in\nthat court in a fiscal year. OFFICE OF COURT ADMIN., ANNUAL STATISTICAL REPORT FOR THE\nTEXAS JUDICIARY (FISCAL YEAR 2016) at Court-Level 3 (2016). By definition, all of the cases\ngranted involve important questions of law that impact the jurisprudence of the state. TEX.\nGOV’T CODE § 22.001.\n\n\n\n                                               14\n\f                 4.        Amount involved and results obtained\n\n         Abraham sought tens of millions of dollars in damages in his defamation\n\nsuit. (RR1:66. See also CR1:325 (claiming to have been damaged in “very large\n\namounts of money”)) Abraham’s expert’s testimony avoided acknowledging this\n\nindisputable fact, instead preferring to cast the first appeal as an attempt to recover\n\nthe trial fees not awarded in the first judgment. (CR2:91–92). That evidence is\n\nincorrect and incomplete; no reasonable factfinder could have credited it as a\n\nmatter of law.\n\n         Even after the dismissal of Abraham’s defamation claim, significant issues\n\nremained. They included an award of costs, reasonable attorney’s fees, other\n\nexpenses, and a sanction—potentially very large—that Texas law required be\n\nawarded to Sullivan. Sullivan v. Abraham, 472 S.W.3d 677, 683 (Tex. App.—\n\nAmarillo 2014), rev’d on other grounds, 488 S.W.3d 294 (Tex. 2016). See, e.g.,\n\nOrder, McGibney v. Retzlaff, No. 67-270669-14, 2016 WL 1703694, at *4 (67th\n\nDist. Ct., Tarrant Cnty.) (Apr. 14, 2016).6 Three significant legal issues also\n\nremained: (1) whether a district court had discretion under the TCPA to refuse to\n\naward a sanction that the TCPA says “shall” be awarded, TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.\n\nCODE § 27.009(a)(2); and, (2) whether considerations of justice and equity properly\n\ninform an award of costs, id. § 27.009(a)(1); and, (3) whether considerations of\n\n6\n    Available at App. E.\n\n\n                                             15\n\fjustice and equity properly inform a district court’s determination of a reasonable\n\nattorney’s fee, id. § 27.009(a)(1).\n\n      Regarding the results obtained, Sullivan prevailed on all three legal issues.\n\nSullivan, 472 S.W.3d at 683 (issue 1); Sullivan, 488 S.W.3d at 299 (issues 2 and\n\n3). Sullivan also obtained a $15,000 sanction, Sullivan has now been awarded the\n\nentirety of his costs and other expenses up through the time of the district court’s\n\njudgment, and Sullivan obtained a significantly increased award of attorney’s fees.\n\n(CR2:439–40).\n\n             5.     The time limitations imposed by client or circumstances\n\n      Neither party sought an adjustment of attorney’s fees on the basis of any\n\ntime limitation. (CR2:67, 92).\n\n             6.     Nature and length of professional relationship between\n                    lawyer and client\n\n      There is no basis in the record for any specific adjustment of an attorney’s\n\nfee award based on the nature and length of the professional relationship between\n\nSullivan and his counsel. (CR2:67, 93). Nor did Abraham’s expert provide any\n\nspecific basis for his opinion that Sullivan’s counsel had represented him for any\n\nlength of time, or that the rates sought were not discounted. There is no evidence\n\nanywhere that Sullivan’s counsel represented him in any litigation before Salem\n\nAbraham sued Sullivan; they did not.\n\n\n\n\n                                        16\n\f             7.    Experience, reputation, and ability of the lawyers\n\n      There is no dispute between the parties regarding an adjustment of the\n\nattorney’s fee award based on the experience, reputation, or ability of any lawyer\n\ninvolved in this case. (CR2:67, 93).\n\n             8.    Whether the fee is fixed or contingent on results obtained or\n                   uncertainty of collection\n\n      Neither party sought an adjustment of fees based on a contingency of\n\ncollection before the legal services were performed. (CR2:67, 93).\n\n      C.     The district court failed to apply the law correctly and acted\n             without reference to guiding principles.\n\n      The determination of whether a trial court abused its discretion is a question\n\nof law. Jackson v. VanWinkle, 660 S.W.2d 807, 810 (Tex. 1983). A trial court\n\nabuses its discretion when it acts arbitrarily and unreasonably, without reference to\n\nguiding rules or principles, or when it misapplies the law to the established facts of\n\nthe case. Beaumont Bank, N.A. v. Buller, 806 S.W.2d 223, 226 (Tex. 1991). A trial\n\ncourt has no discretion to determine what the law is or in applying the law to the\n\nfacts and, consequently, the trial court’s failure to analyze or apply the law\n\ncorrectly is an abuse of discretion. In re Am. Homestar of Lancaster, Inc., 50\n\nS.W.3d 480, 483 (Tex. 2001).\n\n      The district court’s determination that a reasonable attorney’s fee for\n\ndefeating a claim that sought tens of millions of dollars in damages, and then\n\n\n\n                                         17\n\fprevailing on two successive appeals was $35,000 is an abuse of discretion that\n\nresulted from the district court’s acting without reference to guiding principles and\n\nfailing to apply the law as instructed by the Supreme Court of Texas in this very\n\ncase correctly. The award of attorney’s fees is extreme and excessively low and\n\nmust be reversed.\n\n      As demonstrated above, there was little disagreement between the parties\n\nregarding what would be a reasonable attorney’s fee in this case. As shown above:\n\n   • Comparing similar tasks, the parties spent nearly the same number of\n     hours on this case.\n\n   • The hours discrepancy between the parties comes entirely from the\n     reply brief in the first appeal in this Court (41.1 hours, CR2:34–56,\n     407), the Reply in Support of Sullivan’s Petition for Review (51\n     hours, CR2:34–56, 407), and Sullivan’s Reply Brief on the Merits in\n     the Supreme Court of Texas (92.7 hours, CR2:34–56, 407). Because\n     of the procedural posture of this case, Abraham’s counsel did not\n     prepare replies. They performed substantially less work, and\n     nevertheless incurred in excess of $130,000 in attorney’s fees prior to\n     remand. (CR2:82–83).\n\n   • Among the Arthur Andersen factors, there was material divergence\n     between the parties’ positions only with respect to the amount at issue\n     and the results obtained. But no expert opinion can undo the fact that\n     Abraham himself sued for tens of millions of dollars, or that Sullivan\n     prevailed on the legal issues, clarified important Texas law, and stood\n     to gain significant sums by virtue of the original appeal. Abraham’s\n     expert’s testimony was incorrect as a matter of law, as the opinions of\n     this Court and the supreme court show, and as the judgment of the\n     district court also demonstrates.\n\n      If the district court had considered the Arthur Andersen factors in order to\n\naward a fair or moderate attorney’s fee as instructed by the Supreme Court of\n\n\n                                         18\n\fTexas, it could not have awarded $35,000 for all work done prior to remand\n\nbecause:\n\n             • The $35,000 award is substantially less than the attorney’s fees\n               Abraham says he reasonably incurred in the original trial court\n               proceedings. (CR2:82);\n\n             • When awarding trial attorney’s fees is mandated by statute, an\n               award of conditional appellate fees supported by evidence is\n               also mandatory. Ventling v. Johnson, 466 S.W.3d 143, 154\n               (Tex. 2015) (concluding that a prevailing party in the district\n               court who successfully appeals is entitled to appellate\n               attorney’s fees)7;\n\n             • Any evaluation of the results obtained must necessarily take\n               into account the facts: (1) Abraham himself put tens of millions\n               of dollars at issue; (2) Sullivan prevailed on appeal in this Court\n               and in the supreme court; and, (3) Sullivan has obtained more\n               favorable rulings from the district court on every issue in the\n               case;\n\n             • Even using the lowest number of hours any party said was\n               reasonable and the lowest rate for any attorney that any\n               evidence suggested was reasonable for every single one of\n               those hours, the award would have had to be more than triple\n               what it was; and,\n\n             • Using rates Abraham acknowledges are reasonable yields an\n               8% discount from $296,805 in pre-remand fees. The district\n               court acted without reference to guiding principles and entered\n               a judgment that reflected an 88% discount on the reasonable\n               attorney’s fees Sullivan proved.\n\n          To calculate reasonable attorney’s fees, the factfinder should multiply the\n\nnumber of hours worked by the attorney’s hourly rate. Lopez v. Bailon, No. 07-14-\n\n7\n    See infra Section IV.\n\n\n\n                                            19\n\f00442-CV, 2016 WL 4158034, at *5 (Tex. App.—Amarillo Aug. 4, 2016, no pet.).\n\nWhen a district court gives lip service to some of the relevant factors, but fails to\n\nact with reasoned reference to them, the proper course is to reverse. Lowe v.\n\nJohnson Cnty., No. 03A01-9309-CH-00321, 1995 WL 306166, at *8 (Tenn. Ct.\n\nApp. May 19, 1995).\n\nII.     The district court’s judgment must be reversed because there is no\n        evidence to support Findings of Fact 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.\n\n        There is no evidence to support the district court’s Findings of Fact 5, 6, 7,\n\n8, or 9. (CR2:444–45). Findings 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 would not have been made absent\n\nerroneously sustaining Abraham’s objections to Sullivan’s evidence. (CR2:397–98,\n\n439).\n\n        In a nonjury trial, findings of fact have the same force and dignity as a jury's\n\nverdict. Dallas Cnty. Constable Precinct No. 5 v. Garden City Boxing Club, Inc.,\n\n219 S.W.3d 613, 615–16 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2007, no pet.). When a complete\n\nreporter's record is filed, a trial court's findings of fact are reviewed for legal\n\nsufficiency under the same standard as is applied to a jury verdict. Green v. Alford,\n\n274 S.W.3d 5, 23 (Tex. Ap.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2008, pet. denied).\n\n        In conducting a legal sufficiency review, an appellate court reviews the\n\nrecord in the light most favorable to the challenged finding, crediting favorable\n\nevidence if a reasonable factfinder could and disregarding contrary evidence unless\n\na reasonable factfinder could not. See City of Keller v. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d 802,\n\n\n                                           20\n\f827 (Tex. 2005). Evidence is legally sufficient if it “rises to a level that would\n\nenable reasonable and fair-minded people to differ in their conclusions.” Ford\n\nMotor Co. v. Ridgway, 135 S.W.3d 598, 601 (Tex. 2004) (quoting Merrell Dow\n\nPharms., Inc. v. Havner, 953 S.W.3d 706, 711 (Tex. 1997)).\n\n       Evidence is legally insufficient when (a) there is a complete absence of\n\nevidence of a vital fact, (b) the court is barred by rules of law or evidence from\n\ngiving weight to the only evidence offered to prove a vital fact, (c) the evidence\n\noffered to prove a vital fact is no more than a mere scintilla, or (d) the evidence\n\nconclusively establishes the opposite of a vital fact. City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at\n\n810.\n\n       Accordingly, an unsupported or generalized conclusion has no probative\n\nforce and is legally insufficient. See Hancock v. Variyam, 400 S.W.3d 59, 69 (Tex.\n\n2013); Coastal Transp. Co. v. Crown Cent. Petroleum Corp., 136 S.W.3d 227, 232\n\n(Tex. 2004).   As a result, a finding based on an unsupported or generalized\n\nconclusion cannot survive a no evidence challenge. See Roger v. Zanetti, ___\n\nS.W.3d ____, 2017 WL 1553154, at *7 (Tex. 2017); Kindred v. Con/Chem, Inc.,\n\n650 S.W.2d 61, 63 (Tex. 1983).\n\n       A.    The district court abused its discretion and failed to apply the law\n             correctly in sustaining Abraham’s objections.\n\n       The district court summarily sustained Abraham’s objections to Sullivan’s\n\nattorney’s fees application. (CR2:439). This was reversible error.\n\n\n                                         21\n\f             1.    There is evidence of the fees customarily charged in the\n                   locality for similar services.\n\n      Contrary to Abraham’s objections 1 and 2, (CR2:397, 439), Sullivan offered\n\nevidence of fees customarily charged in the locality for similar services. (CR2:34,\n\n66; CR2:410 (issue preserved)). Abraham’s own expert also offered this evidence.\n\n(CR2:91). Because there is evidence of reasonable rates in the locality—from both\n\nparties’ respective experts, there is some evidence of a reasonable rate in the\n\nlocality. City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 827.\n\n             2.    Sullivan offered ample evidence from which both Abraham\n                   and the district court could engage in a meaningful review\n                   of the fees sought.\n\n      Sustaining Abraham’s objection 3, (CR2:397, 439), was an abuse of\n\ndiscretion because the Supreme Court of Texas has explicitly permitted recovery of\n\nfees under the lodestar method when actual billing records did not even exist. Long,\n\n442 S.W.3d at 255–56; El Apple I, Ltd. v. Olivas, 370 S.W.3d 757, 764 (Tex.\n\n2012).\n\n      Sullivan provided detailed information about work performed, who\n\nperformed the work, when, how long it took, and the rate of the attorney\n\nperforming the work by expert testimony on June 24, 2016. (CR2:21, 34–56).\n\nTexas law requires no more. Long, 442 S.W.3d at 255.\n\n      The district court signed its final judgment eight months later, on February\n\n28, 2017. (CR2:440). In the eight months between Sullivan’s expert’s testimony\n\n\n                                         22\n\fand the final judgment, the record discloses no evidence that Abraham ever sought\n\nto discover Sullivan’s counsel’s billing records. This is an independent reason for\n\nwhich the district court’s sustaining Abraham’s objection was an abuse of\n\ndiscretion. Abraham v. Greer, 509 S.W.3d 609, 617 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 2016,\n\npet. denied).\n\n      Nor did Abraham ever identify any specific testimony—in more than 20\n\npages of time descriptions—that was objectionable for any reason. A global, non-\n\nspecific objection constitutes no objection as a matter of law. Objections must raise\n\na specific failure to comply with the rules of procedure or evidence to the attention\n\nof the court. Wilkins v. Royal Indemn. Co., 592 S.W.2d 64, 68 (Tex. Civ. App.—\n\nTyler 1979, no writ). Because Abraham’s objection failed to provide a specific\n\nbasis for the district court to make an intelligent decision, Abraham’s objection\n\nwas no objection as a matter of law and it was an abuse of discretion for the district\n\ncourt to sustain it. Sciarrilla v. Osborne, 946 S.W.2d 919, 924 (Tex. App.—\n\nBeaumont 1997, pet. denied).\n\n                3.   It was an abuse of discretion to sustain Abraham’s\n                     testimonial objections.\n\n      The district court also abused its discretion in sustaining Abraham’s\n\nobjections 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 12 because they do not offer a legal basis for\n\nexcluding evidence. (CR2:398, 439). Instead, they are in the nature of expert\n\n\n\n\n                                         23\n\fopinion testimony that, in effect, seeks discounts of the reasonable attorney’s fees\n\nsought by Sullivan:\n\n      Motion to Recuse                                            $ 6,187.50\n\n      Partner rates in the first district court proceedings       $ 13,159.50\n\n      Partner rates in the court of appeals                       $ 5,604.00\n\n      Associate rates in the Supreme Court of Texas               $ 5,764.50\n\n       “Objections” 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 12 are mere comments on the weight of\n\nevidence or attempts to cloak expert testimony as a legal objection. They fail to\n\nspecify a legal basis, no legal basis is apparent from the context, and no legal basis\n\nexists for sustaining these “objections.” It was therefore an abuse of discretion for\n\nthe district court to sustain them. Sciarrilla v. Osborne, 946 S.W.2d 919, 924 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Beaumont 1997, pet. denied) (General objections are no objection at all.).\n\n             4.    Blended rates are commonplace and comply with the Texas\n                   Disciplinary Rules.\n\n      The district court failed to apply the law correctly in sustaining Abraham’s\n\nobjection 6. (CR2:398, 439). Blended rates are commonplace and comply with the\n\nTexas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct. See, e.g., Khan v. Chaudhry,\n\nNo. 09-14-0479-CV, 2016 WL 1158734, at *5–6 (Tex. App.—Beaumont Mar. 24,\n\n2016, pet. denied); D’Lux Movers & Storage v. Fulton, No. 02-06-0019-CV, 2007\n\nWL 1299400, at *4–5 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth May 3, 2007, pet. denied); 1 TEX.\n\nPRAC. GUIDE WILLS,     TRUSTS   & ESTATE PLANNING § 2:63 (Dec. 2016); Mark D.\n\n\n                                          24\n\fWhite & L. Hayes Fuller, III, Attorney Fees Update, 66 THE ADVOC. (TEXAS) 144,\n\n173 (Spring 2014) (acknowledging the frequency with which blended rates are\n\nemployed); Robert B. Gilbreath, Caught in a Crossfire, TEX. TECH L. REV. 139,\n\n178 (1996) (recommending the increased use of blended rates).\n\n             5.     Abraham’s litigation tactics, not the amounts Sullivan\n                    seeks, disincentivize the cessation of litigation. In any event,\n                    this is not a recognized basis for a legal objection.\n\n      Nowhere in the rules of procedure or evidence is there an objection for the\n\ndisincentivization of the cessation of litigation. Sustaining an objection that lacks a\n\nbasis in law was an abuse of discretion. See, e.g., Simmons v. State, 100 S.W.3d\n\n484, 492–93 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2003, pet. ref’d).\n\n      Moreover, the evidence in this case is clear regarding the cessation of\n\nlitigation. Abraham defended an award of $6,500 in attorney’s fees all the way to\n\nthe Supreme Court of Texas, all the while knowing that he had incurred nearly\n\n$50,000 in fees in the original trial court proceedings. (CR2:82). Now, having\n\nacknowledged that the hours his legal team spent on this litigation are a relevant\n\nfactor in ascertaining a reasonable number of hours for Sullivan’s legal team to\n\nhave spent, and knowing that, apples to apples, the parties spent nearly an identical\n\nnumber of hours on this case, Abraham defends an award of $35,000 in attorney’s\n\nfees while knowing that his legal team incurred 3.4 times that amount. (CR2:82–\n\n83). Abraham’s own unreasonable positions—themselves a lagniappe on his\n\n\n\n                                          25\n\fadmission that his defamation claim was frivolous from the start—have prohibited\n\nthe cessation of this litigation. (RR3:94–95).\n\n      B.     There is no evidence to support Findings of Fact 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.\n\n             1.    Salem Abraham sued Sullivan for defamation despite\n                   knowing prior to filing suit that Sullivan was not Greer’s\n                   source.\n\n      No evidence supports Finding of Fact 5 or 6. (CR2:444; CR2:448\n\n(preserved)) Abraham himself admitted facts that necessarily mean this lawsuit\n\nwas filed in violation of Rule 13 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. Abraham’s\n\nfiling this lawsuit was an effort to punish Michael Quinn Sullivan for Daniel\n\nGreer’s actions. (CR1:9–12). Abraham’s pleadings acknowledge that Michael\n\nQuinn Sullivan was not present at the Honeycomb Pie Shop event that was the\n\nsubject of Daniel Greer’s blog post. (CR1:14–15). Abraham also acknowledges\n\nthat Michael Quinn Sullivan published a story about the same event. (CR1:14).\n\nAbraham sued Sullivan for alleged libel done by Greer and AgendaWise, not for\n\nanything Sullivan himself did. (CR1:9–12).\n\n      When Abraham filed this lawsuit, Daniel Greer had already sworn under\n\noath that Michael Quinn Sullivan was not his source. (RR3:94). Abraham was\n\npresent when Greer made such testimony. (RR3:94). Abraham admitted that he had\n\nno facts tending to contradict Greer’s sworn testimony. (RR3:94).\n\n\n\n\n                                          26\n\f      Michael Quinn Sullivan had also already sworn under oath that he had\n\nprovided no information to Greer regarding Greer’s story. (RR3:95). Abraham was\n\npresent during this testimony, too. (RR3:95). Abraham admitted that he had no\n\nfacts tending to contradict Sullivan’s sworn testimony. (RR3:95).\n\n      Abraham further admitted that, even after filing this lawsuit, he had no\n\ninformation tending to inculpate Michael Quinn Sullivan. (RR3:93). He sued him\n\nanyway. Based on Abraham’s own admissions, Abraham’s purpose for suing\n\nMichael Quinn Sullivan cannot have been to recover damages from Sullivan, as he\n\npled. (CR1:15).\n\n      Abraham also admitted in his pleadings that he wanted to discover how\n\nMichael Quinn Sullivan had learned about the Levelland meeting. (CR1:15). That\n\ninformation, however, would not make any fact in the case—whether background\n\nor material—more or less likely to be true. This case was filed as a fishing\n\nexpedition unrelated to any concern about Sullivan’s having defamed Abraham, as\n\nAbraham’s own pleadings demonstrate as a matter of law. This is an improper\n\npurposes for filing a lawsuit as a matter of law. See In re Alford Chevrolet-Geo,\n\n997 S.W.2d 173, 180–81 (Tex. 1999).\n\n      Finally, the judgment dismissing Abraham’s defamation claim against\n\nSullivan was entered because the lawsuit was based on, related to, or in response to\n\nMichael Quinn Sullivan’s exercise of the right to speak on a matter of public\n\n\n\n                                        27\n\fconcern and Abraham had no evidence to support one or more essential elements\n\nof his claim. (CR1:534, 768). TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE § 27.003(a). Findings\n\n5 and 6 are contrary to Conclusion of Law 13. (CR2:445). Furthermore, the district\n\ncourt lost plenary power to alter or amend that judgment years ago, and lacked\n\npower to enter findings contrary to the portions of that judgment that became final\n\nyears ago. No evidence supports the district court’s Finding 5 or Finding 6 that this\n\nlawsuit emanated from any sincere and justifiable concern about Abraham’s\n\nreputation.\n\n              2.   No evidence supports a relationship between Sullivan and\n                   Greer such that it was proper to infer that Sullivan could\n                   have been Greer’s source.\n\n      No evidence supports Finding 7. (CR2:444; CR2:448 (preserved)) When he\n\nfiled this lawsuit, Abraham had only surmise and suspicion about any relationship\n\nbetween Greer and Sullivan. Sullivan published a non-defamatory article about the\n\nLevelland meeting in one forum two days before Greer published an allegedly\n\ndefamatory article in a different forum. (CR1:14). Sullivan was not present at the\n\nLevelland meeting and Abraham knew it. (CR1:14–15). Sullivan denied under oath\n\nhaving been Greer’s source before this lawsuit was filed, and Greer denied under\n\noath that Sullivan was his source before this lawsuit was filed. (RR1:93–95).\n\nAbraham admitted that he had “no facts” to support his surmise and suspicion.\n\n(RR1:93). No evidence supports Finding 7.\n\n\n\n                                         28\n\f             3.    The award to Michael Quinn Sullivan of $35,000 in\n                   attorney’s fees through remand from the Supreme Court\n                   relies on an incorrect legal standard and has no evidence to\n                   support it.\n\n      The district court’s Finding 8 determines that “reasonable and necessary\n\nattorneys’ fees for the services of [Sullivan’s] attorneys, from the beginning of this\n\ncase until remand by the Supreme Court of Texas to this Court, is [sic] in the\n\namount of $35,000. (CR2:444–45).\n\n      First, the district court applied the incorrect legal standard to the evidence in\n\nfinding an amount of “reasonable and necessary” attorney’s fees. (CR2:444;\n\nCR2:449 (preserved)) The TCPA requires an award of “reasonable attorney’s\n\nfees,” but the district court added “necessary”—an element not present in the\n\nTCPA. TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE § 27.009(a)(1). “Reasonable” is distinct\n\nfrom “reasonable and necessary,” as this Court has previously held. Busteed v.\n\nColdspring Oakhurst Consol. Indep. Sch. Dist., No. 07-02-00103-CV, 2002 WL\n\n31549428, at *3 (Tex. App.—Amarillo Nov. 18, 2002, no pet.). See also Murrco\n\nAgency, Inc. v. Ryan, 800 S.W.2d 600, 606 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1990, no writ)\n\n(holding that, unlike the provisions of TEX. BUS. & COM. CODE § 17.50(d), which\n\nrequires that attorney’s fees must be necessary in a DTPA proceeding, Civil\n\nPractice & Remedies Code section 38.001 requires only that the amount of\n\nattorney’s fees be reasonable); Prairie Valley Ind. Sch. Dist. v. Sawyer, 665\n\nS.W.2d 606, 611 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 1984, writ ref’d n.r.e.) (holding that\n\n\n                                         29\n\fformer article 2226 of the Texas Revised Civil Statutes required testimony that\n\nattorney’s fees are reasonable and did not require evidence of necessity). Applying\n\nan incorrect legal standard is, without more, reversible error. Sullivan, 488 S.W.3d\n\nat 299.\n\n      In addition, no evidence supports Finding 8. (CR2:444). As shown above,\n\nthe parties’ respective evidence regarding the amount that constitutes a reasonable\n\nattorney’s fee in this case does not diverge significantly. The discrepancies in the\n\nparties’ evidence were:\n\n      •     Abraham sought some $30,715.50 in discounts off of the\n            $296,805 in reasonable fees prior to remand. (CR2:403–10);\n\n      •     There was no dispute that, at a minimum, 589 hours was a\n            reasonable number of hours to have spent on this case prior to\n            remand. (CR2:59, 82–83, 86); and,\n\n      •     The unrefuted basis for the difference in the number of hours\n            spent on this case by the parties is, based on the evidence,\n            entirely attributable to the prior reply brief in this Court, the\n            reply in support of Sullivan’s petition for review, and Sullivan’s\n            reply brief on the merits in the supreme court. Supra subsection\n            I.B.(1).\n\n      There is no basis in the evidence for reducing the reasonable attorney’s fees\n\nthat Sullivan proved according to the evidentiary standards established by the\n\nsupreme court by some $260,000. The district court nevertheless disregarded the\n\nevidence and awarded an arbitrary sum. Because no evidence supports this\n\n\n\n\n                                        30\n\fFinding, Finding 8 and the portion of the judgment that directly flows from it must\n\nbe reversed. (CR2:439 ¶2, 444).\n\n            4.     The award to Michael Quinn Sullivan of $7,200 in\n                   attorney’s fees for work after remand relies on an incorrect\n                   legal standard and has no evidence to support it.\n\n      Like Finding 8, Finding 9 discloses that the district court applied an\n\nincorrect legal standard by determining “reasonable and necessary” attorney’s fees,\n\nin contravention of the TCPA, which mandates an award of reasonable attorney’s\n\nfees. (CR2:444; CR2:449 (preserved)). TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE § 27.009(a);\n\nBusteed v. Coldspring Oakhurst Consol. Indep. Sch. Dist., No. 07-02-00103-CV,\n\n2002 WL 31549428, at *3 (Tex.

App.—Fort\n\nWorth 1984, writ ref’d n.r.e.). Applying an incorrect legal standard is, without\n\nmore, reversible error. Sullivan, 488 S.W.3d at 299.\n\n      Additionally, no evidence supports reducing the amount of reasonable\n\nattorney’s fees Sullivan proved to the standard required by the supreme court from\n\n$12,358.50 to $7,200. Abraham never controverted, questioned, or challenged any\n\ntime or task entry or rate charged supporting this award of fees. (CR2:419–20).\n\nAccordingly, there was no evidence supporting Finding 9 or the portion of the final\n\njudgment that flows directly from it. (CR2:439 ¶3, 444).\n\n\n\n                                        31\n\fIII.   In Findings of Fact 8 and 9, the trial court reversibly erred by\n       commingling in a broad-form finding multiple damages elements that\n       are legally insufficient.\n\n       A.    Reversible error is presumed under Casteel and its progeny.\n\n       Reversible error is presumed when a broad-form finding commingles\n\nelements that are legally insufficient. Thota v. Young, 366 S.W.3d 678, 680 (Tex.\n\n2012); Zaidi v. Shah, 502 S.W.3d 434, 439–40 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.]\n\n2016, pet. denied). Reversible error is presumed because the reviewing court\n\ncannot determine whether the finding is based on an invalid element. Crown Life\n\nIns. Co., v. Casteel, 22 S.W.3d 378, 389 (Tex. 2000). The Supreme Court of Texas\n\nin Casteel explained as follows:\n\n            It is fundamental to our system of justice that parties have the\n            right to be judged by a jury properly instructed in the law. Yet,\n            when a jury based a finding of liability on a single broad-form\n            question that commingles invalid theories of liability with valid\n            theories, the appellate court is often unable to determine the\n            effect of this error. The best the court can do is determine that\n            some evidence could have supported the jury’s conclusion on a\n            legally valid theory. To hold this error harmless would allow a\n            defendant to be held liable without a judicial determination that\n            a factfinder actually found that the defendant should be held\n            liable on proper, legal grounds.\n            Accordingly, we hold that when a trial court submits a single\n            broad-form liability question incorporating multiple theories of\n            liability, the error is harmful and a new trial is required when\n            the appellate court cannot determine whether the jury based its\n            verdict on an improperly submitted invalid theory.\n                                          ...\n            [I]t is impossible for us to conclude that the jury’s answer was\n            not based on one of the improperly submitted theories.\n\n\n                                         32\n\fId. at 388-89.\n\n      The supreme court subsequently expanded Casteel to apply to a broad-form\n\ndamages finding that includes legally insufficient elements.\n\n            A trial court’s error in instructing a jury to consider erroneous\n            matters, whether an invalid liability theory or an unsupported\n            element of damage, prevents the appellant from demonstrating\n            the consequences of the error on appeal.\n                                             ...\n            We hold that Casteel’s reasoning applies equally to broad-form\n            damage questions, and under its rationale we conclude that the\n            charge error in this case was harmful.\n\nHarris Cnty. v. Smith, 96 S.W.3d 230, 236 (Tex. 2002); see Thota, 366 S.W.3d at\n\n680 (“We have held that reversible error is presumed when a … broad-form\n\nquestion comingles damage elements that are unsupported by legally sufficient\n\nevidence.”).\n\n      B.       Casteel and its progeny apply to findings of fact.\n\n      Although Casteel and Harris County arose in the context of jury trials, at\n\nleast four appellate courts in Texas have recognized that their principles also apply\n\nto findings of fact made by a trial court after a bench trial.8 The most notable of\n\nthose cases is Zaidi v. Shah, where the Fourteenth Court of Appeals reversed on\n\nthat basis and explained as follows:\n\n8\n See Zaidi v. Shah, 502 S.W.3d 434, 440 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2016, pet. denied);\nTown Ctr. Mall, L.P. v. Dyer, 2015 WL 5770583, at *7 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2015, pet.\ndenied); In re Marriage of C.A.S and D.P.S., 405 S.W.3d 373, 394-95 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2013,\nno pet.); Tagle v. Galvan, 155 S.W.3d 510, 516 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2004, no pet.).\n\n\n                                            33\n\f           Casteel and its progeny are intended to remedy the trial court’s\n           error in failing to eliminate—or at to segregate—the\n           factfinder’s consideration of invalid claims [or elements]. The\n           error is harmful when it results in a broad-form finding that\n           prevents the reviewing court from determining whether the\n           finding is based on valid claims [or elements]. The same error\n           can arise, with the same resulting harm, when the trial court is\n           the factfinder.\n\n502 S.W.3d 434, 440 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2016, pet. denied); see\n\nHarris Cnty., 96 S.W.3d at 233.\n\n      In Zaidi, the trial court made findings of fact that included a cumulative\n\ndamage award for multiple causes of action. Id. at 438–39. Because many of the\n\nliability findings were legally insufficient, it was impossible for the court of\n\nappeals to know whether the broad-form damage finding was based on a legally\n\ninsufficient claim. Id. at 439, 441, 442–44, 445. The appellants in Zaidi requested\n\nthe trial court to issue additional findings of fact identifying the specific damages\n\nawarded for each claim, but the trial court refused. Id. at 437, 440–41. As a result,\n\nthe court of appeals reversed, based on the Casteel line of cases, and reasoned as\n\nfollows:\n\n           The trial court’s global findings were burdened with more\n           causes of action that the evidence would bear, so we must\n           reverse and remand unless we are ‘reasonably certain that the\n           [factfinder] was not significantly influenced’ by the inclusion of\n           invalid theories of recovery. Because it is impossible determine\n           the extent to which the trial court awarded actual and punitive\n           damages on an invalid basis, we have no such reasonable\n           certainty. We instead conclude that the trial court’s error … ‘is\n\n\n\n                                         34\n\f            harmful because it prevent[ed] proper presentation of the case\n            on appeal.’\n                                                ...\n            As in the Casteel line of cases, we must remand the cause for a\n            new trial.\n\nId. at 444–45.\n\n       This case, like Zaidi, also requires reversal based on Casteel and its progeny\n\nbecause the trial court made two findings of fact (No. 8 and No. 9) that award\n\nattorney’s fees as actual damages under the TCPA, and many of the elements\n\naccompanying each damage finding are legally insufficient.9 (CR2:444–45).\n\n       C.     Finding of Fact 8\n\n       Finding of Fact 8 awards Sullivan attorney’s fees as actual damages “from\n\nthe beginning of this case until remand by the Supreme Court of Texas to this\n\nCourt … in the amount of $35,000.” (CR2:444). This damages finding is “based\n\nupon” the following elements:\n\n     (1)      “the Court’s knowledge of attorney’s fees, including the rates\n              customarily charged in the locality for similar services;”\n\n     (2)      “the evidence presented on the fees customarily charged in the\n              locality for similar services;”\n\n\n9\n  TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE § 27.009 (“Damages and Costs”) (the actual “damages” that a\ncourt shall award under Section 27.009(a) include “reasonable attorney’s fees, and other\nexpenses incurred in defending against the legal action as justice an equity may require.”); see\nWoodhaven Partners, Ltd. v. Shamoun & Norman, L.L.P., 422 S.W.3d 821, 837 (Tex. App.—\nDallas 2014, no pet.) (recognizing that attorney’s fees may be recovered as actual damages when\nprovided for by statute) (quoting Eberts v. Businesspeople Personnel Servs., Inc., 620 S.W.2d\n861, 863 (Tex. Civ. App.—Dallas 1975, writ ref’d n.r.e.)).\n\n\n\n                                              35\n\f     (3)      “the Court’s observation and evaluation of what amount of legal\n              services were provided by the attorneys for the parties;”\n\n     (4)      “this Court’s evaluation of what level of attorney services were\n              reasonable and necessary in this case;”\n\n     (5)      “this Court’s evaluation of the duplication of legal services, and”\n\n     (6)      “the legal services which this Court believes and finds were\n              excessive, unreasonable and unnecessary.” (CR2:444).\n\n       The vast majority of these damage elements are conclusory and unsupported\n\nby any detail or specification. Elements 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 broadly reference the trial\n\ncourt’s “knowledge,” “evaluation,” “observation and evaluation,” and, what the\n\ntrial court “believes and finds;” but none of the Elements sets forth what the trial\n\ncourt’s “knowledge,” “evaluation,” “observation and evaluation,” and “belief”\n\nactually is for the respective elements and they are not contained in the post-\n\nremand record.10 (CR2; RR3).\n\n       Additionally, Elements 3, 4, and 5 each reference an “evaluation” that was\n\nmade by the trial court about “what amount of legal services were provided by the\n\nattorneys for the parties” [Element 3]; “what level of attorney services were\n\n\n\n\n10\n   Element 2 references the “evidence” that was “presented on the fees customarily charged in\nthe locality for similar legal services.” That evidence shows that the rates charged by Abraham’s\ncounsel were within $10 dollars an hour of the blended rate charged by Sullivan’s counsel.\n(CR2:453–54) That evidence also shows that the total fees charged by Abraham’s counsel from\nthe inception of the case through the time that the case was remanded to the trial court by the\nSupreme Court of Texas was $131,402.58. (CR2:449) As a result, Element 2 also does not\nsupport the trial court’s finding of $35,000 in fees as actual damages under the TCPA.\n(C2R:445)\n\n\n                                               36\n\freasonable and necessary in this case” [Element 4]; and, “the duplication of legal\n\nservices.” [Element 5]. (CR2:444).\n\n      The plain, ordinary meaning of “evaluation” is to “determine” or “assess.”11\n\nHowever, Elements 3, 4, and 5 do not set forth the trial court’s actual\n\ndetermination or assessment about the matters listed in each element, and, again,\n\nthat determination or assessment is not in the reporter’s record from the post-\n\nremand hearing. (CR2; RR3). As a result, this Court can only speculate about what\n\nthe trial court’s “evaluation” is that is referenced in Elements 3, 4, and 5.\n\n      The same problem exists for Element 6. (CR2:444). It references “the legal\n\nservices which [the trial court] believes and finds were excessive, unreasonable,\n\nand unnecessary.” However, there is no specification in Element 6 about what the\n\ntrial court’s “belief” and “finding” actually is with respect to any legal services that\n\n“were excessive [and] unnecessary.” (CR2:444). That “belief” and “finding” is\n\nalso not included the post-remand record. (CR2; RR3). Once again, this Court\n\nmust guess about the trial court’s “belief” and “finding” that is referenced in\n\nElement 6 and speculate how that “belief” and “finding” might support the broad-\n\nform damages finding of $35,000.\n\n      Accordingly, Elements 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 that accompany the broad-form\n\ndamage finding in Finding of Fact Number 8 are unsupported, generalized\n\n11\n   Webster’s New World Dictionary, Second College Edition at 484; The New Roget’s Thesaurus\nin Dictionary Form at 175.\n\n\n                                            37\n\fconclusions and are legally insufficient. (CR: 444–45). See Hancock, 400 S.W.3d\n\nat 69; Coastal Transp. Co., 136 S.W.3d at 232.\n\n       In addition, Elements 4 and 6 explicitly include the consideration of\n\nnecessity, which is not part of the controlling legal standard under the TCPA. TEX.\n\nCIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE § 27.009(a)(1); Busteed, 2002 WL 31549428, at *3.\n\n       Like in Zaidi, Sullivan objected to the trial court that the damage elements\n\naccompanying Finding of Fact Number 8 are conclusory, inadequate, and legally\n\ninsufficient. (CR2:449–55).         Sullivan also requested the trial court to issue\n\nadditional findings of fact that specifically identify the basis for an award of\n\nattorneys’ fees as damages in Finding of Fact 8, but the trial court refused.12\n\n(CR2:449-55). Sullivan further objected to the consideration of the necessity of\n\nlegal services as not related to the applicable legal standard under the TCPA.\n\n(CR2:449). The trial court’s error in overruling Sullivan’s objection and refusing\n\nhis request for additional, specific findings resulted in a broad-form damage\n\nfinding accompanied by six damage elements; five of which are legally\n\ninsufficient.13 (CR2:444).\n\n\n12\n   See Zaidi, 502 S.W.3d at 440 (“The Turnaround parties requested additional findings of fact,\nasking the trial court to identify the damages awarded to each of the Borrowers for each cause of\naction, but the trial court did not do so. This issue therefore has been preserved for our\nreview.”).\n13\n   Sullivan also asked this Court to abate this appeal and require the trial court to make more\nspecific findings of fact in lieu of these conclusory damage elements. This Court denied\nSullivan’s request on July 5, 2017.\n\n\n\n                                               38\n\f      This error is reversible under Casteel and its progeny because it prevents the\n\nCourt from determining the extent to which the finding of $35,000 in attorney’s\n\nfees as damages in Finding of Fact No. 8 is based on an invalid/legally insufficient\n\nelement. Thota, 366 S.W.3d at 680; Harris County, 96 S.W.3d at 231, 233–34;\n\nZaidi, 502 S.W.3d at 439–41.\n\n      D.     Finding of Fact 9\n\n      That same problem exists with Finding of Fact 9. It awards attorneys’ fees\n\nas actual damages “after remand by the Supreme Court” in the amount of $7,200.”\n\n(CR2:445). This damages finding is “based upon” the following elements:\n\n    (1)      “the Court’s knowledge of fees customarily charged in the\n             locality for similar legal services;”\n\n    (2)      “the evidence presented on the fees customarily charged in the\n             locality for similar services;”\n\n    (3)      “[the] evidence of the reasonable number of hours worked for\n             similar work;”\n\n    (4)      “the Court’s evaluation of what level of services was necessary;”\n             and\n\n    (5)      “the Court’s evaluation of … what rendered services were\n             unnecessary.”\n\n(CR2:445).\n\n      Like with Finding of Fact No. 8, several of these damage elements are\n\ngeneralized conclusions and unsupported by any detail or specification.\n\nSpecifically, Elements 1, 4 and 5 broadly reference the trial court’s “knowledge”\n\n\n\n                                        39\n\fand “evaluation;” but none of these damage elements sets forth what the trial\n\ncourt’s “knowledge” and “evaluation” actually is with respect to that element.\n\n         In that regard, Elements 4 and 5 each reference an “evaluation” by the trial\n\ncourt about “what level of services was necessary” and “what rendered services\n\nwere unnecessary,” But, neither damage element includes the trial court’s actual\n\n“determination” or “assessment” about the matters listed in each element.14\n\n(CR2:445). That “determination” or “assessment” is also not included in the post-\n\nremand record. (CR2; RR3).\n\n         Additionally, Elements 4 and 5 explicitly incorporate considerations of\n\nnecessity, which are not part of the applicable legal standard under the TCPA. TEX.\n\nCIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE § 27.009(a)(1); Busteed, 2002 WL 31549428, at *3. As a\n\nresult, this Court must speculate about what the trial court’s “evaluation” is that is\n\nreferenced in Elements 4 and 5, which accompany Finding of Fact No. 9.\n\n         Accordingly, damage elements 1, 4, and 5 that accompany the broad-form\n\ndamage finding in Finding of Fact Number 9 are unsupported, generalized\n\nconclusions and are legally insufficient. (CR2:445). See Hancock, 400 S.W.3d at\n\n69; Coastal Transp. Co., 136 S.W.3d at 232.\n\n         Sullivan objected to the trial court that these damage elements are\n\nconclusory, inadequate, and legally insufficient. (CR2:449–55).        Sullivan also\n\n\n14\n     Supra note 11.\n\n\n                                          40\n\frequested the trial court to issue additional findings of fact that specifically identify\n\nthe basis for an award of attorneys’ fees as actual damages in Finding of Fact No.\n\n9, but the trial court refused.15 (CR2:449-55). Sullivan further objected to the trial\n\ncourt’s use of inapplicable elements in the legal standard. (CR2:449). The trial\n\ncourt’s error in overruling Sullivan’s objection and refusing his request for\n\nadditional, amended, specific findings resulted in a broad-form damage finding\n\naccompanied by five damage elements, three of which are legally insufficient.16\n\n(CR2:445).\n\n         Just like with Finding of Fact No. 8, this error is presumed reversible under\n\nCasteel and its progeny. See Thota, 366 S.W.3d at 680. It prevents this Court from\n\ndetermining the extent to which the trial court’s award of $7,200 in attorneys’ fees\n\nas actual damages in Finding of Fact 9 is based on an invalid/legally insufficient\n\nelement and prevents proper presentation of the case on appeal. See Harris County,\n\n96 S.W.3d at 231, 233–34; Zaidi, 502 S.W.3d at 439–41.\n\n\n\n\n15\n   See Zaidi, 502 S.W.3d at 440 (“The Turnaround parties requested additional findings of fact,\nasking the trial court to identify the damages awarded to each of the Borrowers for each cause of\naction, but the trial court did not do so. This issue therefore has been preserved for our\nreview.”).\n16\n     Supra note 13.\n\n\n\n                                               41\n\fIV.    The district court erred in failing to award conditional appellate\n       attorney’s fees.\n\n      Sullivan offered evidence of a reasonable amount of attorney’s fees\n\nconditioned on a successful appeal in this Court and, if necessary, a further\n\nsuccessful appeal in the Supreme Court of Texas. (CR2:68). The district court\n\nabused its discretion in refusing to award them.\n\n      An award of reasonable attorney’s fees is mandatory for a successful movant\n\nunder the TCPA. TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE § 27.009(a); Bocquet v. Herring,\n\n972 S.W.2d 19, 21 (Tex. 1998); Sullivan, 472 S.W.3d at 680. When an award of\n\ntrial attorney’s fees is made mandatory by statute, an award of appellate attorney’s\n\nfees is also mandatory. Ventling v. Johnson, 466 S.W.3d 143, 154 (Tex. 2015);\n\nDaimlerChrysler Motors Co. v. Manuel, 362 S.W.3d 160, 198–99 (Tex. App.—\n\nFort Worth 2012, no pet.).\n\n      Abraham has argued that Sullivan is entitled to fees only for defending\n\nagainst Abraham’s frivolous legal action, not to fees incurred in Sullivan’s\n\nsuccessfully appealing the erroneous judgment procured by Abraham. The Dallas\n\ncourt of appeals rejected the argument Abraham makes in Cruz v. Van Sickle, 452\n\nS.W.3d 503, 526–27 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2014, no pet.) in the context of the\n\nTCPA. Sullivan’s argument would undermine the purpose of the TCPA, which is,\n\nin part, to deter frivolous litigation and to provide a mechanism for prompt\n\n\n\n\n                                         42\n\fdismissal of strategic lawsuits against public participation. TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.\n\nCODE § 27.009.\n\n      In Ventling, the supreme court explicitly rejected the argument that a\n\nprevailing party in the trial court was not entitled to appellate attorney’s fees as a\n\nsuccessful appellant.\n\n      Because Civil Practice and Remedies Code Chapter 38 directs courts to\n\ninterpret that chapter to promote its underlying purpose, a significant motivating\n\nfactor in the court’s analysis was the purpose of section 38.001: to encourage\n\nparties to pay their just debts and to discourage vexatious and unnecessary\n\nlitigation. Ventling, 466 S.W.3d at 155; Gates v. City of Dallas, 704 S.W.2d 737,\n\n740 (Tex. 1986). Interpreting Chapter 38 such that a prevailing party in the trial\n\ncourt cannot obtain appellate attorney’s fees for a successful appeal of a trial\n\ncourt’s error, said the supreme court, would defeat the purpose of the statute.\n\n      The same analysis applies to the TCPA. Like Chapter 38, the TCPA\n\nmandates that it “be construed liberally to effectuate its purpose and intent fully.”\n\nTEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE § 27.011(b). An award of reasonable attorney’s fees\n\nis mandated by the TCPA. Id. § 27.009(a)(1). Strategic lawsuits against public\n\nparticipation (SLAPP suits) chill public debate because defendants often incur\n\nsubstantial legal fees in defending against frivolous suits. Laura Lee Prather, Five\n\nYears of Anti-SLAPP in Texas 3 (2016). The purpose of the attorney’s fees\n\n\n\n                                         43\n\fprovision in the TCPA is to discourage parties from filing frivolous lawsuits\n\nintended to inflict litigation expenses on an adversary in retaliation for engaging in\n\npublic discourse, and to encourage the prompt disposition of these frivolous\n\nlawsuits. TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE § 27.002; Hersh v. Tatum, ___ S.W.3d\n\n____, 2017 WL 2839873, at *1 (Tex. 2017). It would defeat the purpose of the\n\nTCPA to hold that Sullivan cannot obtain reasonable attorney’s fees for\n\nsuccessfully appealing the district court’s erroneous judgment.\n\n      As the Fifth Circuit has explained,\n\n                    It is unbecoming . . . to hail the defendant into\n             court by means of false allegations and then to complain\n             when the defendant hires skillful, experienced and\n             expensive advocates to defend against those allegations.\n             Having wrongfully kicked the snow loose at the top,\n             [Abraham] must bear the consequences of the avalanche\n             at the bottom.\n\nSchwartz v. Folloder, 767 F.2d 126, 133–34 (5th Cir. 1985). See also Deutsch v.\n\nHenry, 2016 WL 7165993, at *23 (W.D. Tex. Dec. 7, 2016). Accordingly, the\n\ndistrict court’s refusal to award Sullivan conditional appellate fees for successfully\n\nprosecuting this appeal must be reversed.\n\n                         CONCLUSION AND PRAYER\n\n      For the foregoing reasons, as well as for the reasons specified in Sullivan’s\n\nprior briefs in this Court and in the Supreme Court of Texas, Sullivan respectfully\n\nprays that this Court reverse the trial court’s judgment and findings of fact and\n\n\n\n                                         44\n\fconclusions of law and render judgment for Sullivan awarding him the amount of\n\nreasonable attorney’s fees, costs, expenses, and the sanction that he proved in the\n\nrecord. Sullivan alternatively requests that the Court reverse and remand this case\n\nto the trial court for a proper determination of reasonable attorney’s fees, costs,\n\nexpenses, and the sanction as proven by Sullivan. Sullivan additionally prays for\n\nall other and further relief, both at law and in equity, to which he may be justly\n\nentitled.\n\n                                             Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                             AKERMAN LLP\n\n                                              /s/ N.

The Court provided Salem\n\nAbraham additional time after the hearing to offer evidence upon submission, with Michael Quinn\n\nSullivan also having additional time to reply and offer evidence upon submission. Abraham responded\n\non July 11,2016, and Sullivan replied on July 21,2016. After considering the pleadings, the mandate\n\nand opinion of the Texas Supreme Court, the evidence, and the arguments and authorities presented by\n\ncounsel, the Court, in response to a request from Defendant, makes it findings of fact and conclusions\n\noflaw as follows:\n\n                                                                                A.

This suit was filed April9, 2013.\n\n               3.             The underlying statements made by Daniel Greer and Agendawise, which are the subject\n\nof Plaintiff's petition in this case, were completely false, without any factual basis, and were per se\n\ndefamatory to Salem Abraham.\n\n\n\n\nF1NDINOS OF fACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW                                                                                           Page 1\nL:\\1\"1.1111\\IM.

With Salem Abraham's profession being a \"hedge fund\" manager, who is often\n\nthoroughly investigated by prospective. investors or clients, the fake and defamatory statements of\n\nDaniel Greer and Agendawise had the potential to be quite harmful to Salem Abraham and to his\n\nbusiness.\n\n             5.           Salem Abraham brought this legal action out of a sincere and justifiable concern for his\n\nreputation among his clients and investors, and among potential clients and investors.\n\n             6.           This legal action was not brought by Abraham to deter or prevent Sullivan from\n\nel(ercising constitutional rights, nor for any improper pUiposes. Abraham did not bring tbe legal action\n\nto harass, to cause unnecessary delay, or to increase the cost oflitigation. Rather, tbe Court fmds that\n\nAbraham brought this suit for the purposes of (I) exercising his constitutionally-protected right to\n\nprotect his reputation, and (2) to determine how and by whom the utterly false defamatory statements\n\nabout him originated, and were transmitted.\n\n             7.          The Court further finds that the relationship of Michael Quinn Sullivan to AgendaWise\n\nand Daniel Greer, and Michael Quinn Sullivan's prior publication about the Levelland meeting, were\n\nsuch as would lead a reasonable person to suspect that Michael Quinn Sullivan may have been involved\n\nin the transmission of false information regarding Abraham.\n\n             8.           Based upon the Court's knowledge of attorney's fees, including the rates customarily\n\ncharged in the locality for similar legal services, the evidence presented on tbe fees customarily charged\n\nin the locality for similar services, the Court's observation and evaluation of what amount of legal\n\nservices were provided by the attorneys for the parties, and this Court's evaluation of what level of\n\nattorney's services were reasonable and necessary in this case, as well as this Court's evaluation of the\n\nduplication oflegal services, and the legal services which this Court believes and finds were excessive,\n\nunreasonable and unnecessary, the Court finds that reasonable and necessary attorneys' fees for the\n\n\n\nf!NDINOS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW                                                                    Page2\n.1.:111111111\\DATA\\A-.......m.Sallina.illl!i 1.10\\f'~iadiap of Fld and CandJaWm uf~ -~\n\n\n                                                                                                             444\n\fservices of Defendant's attorneys, from the beginning of this case until remand by the Supreme Court\n\nof Texas to this Court, is in the amount of$35,000.00.\n\n             9.           Based upon the Court's knowledgeoffees customarily charged in the locality for similar\n\nlegal services, the evidence presented on the fees customarily charged in the locality for similar services,\n\nplus evidence of the reasonable number of hours worked for similar work, and the Court's evaluation\n\nofwhat level of services was necessary, and what rendered services were unnecessary, the Court finds\n\nthat reasonable and necessary attorneys' fees for the services ofDefendant's attorneys, after remand by\n\nthe Supreme Court, is in the amount of$7,200,00.\n\n             I 0.          Based upon the evidence submitted, and the Court's knowledge of what expenses are\n\nnormally incurred by attorneys and billed to fee-paying clients, Defendant incurred other expenses in\n\ndefending against the legal action that justice and equity require to be awarded to Defendant, in the\n\namount of$17,240.03.\n\n             II.

(CR2:439)1\n\n\n1\n  This is an appeal after remand. The Clerk’s Record for this appeal is in two volumes, one\ncontaining items filed prior to the first appeal (“Volume 1”), and the other containing items filed\non remand (“Volume 2”). Volume 1, containing 790 pages, was filed in in the first appeal (No.\n07-13-00396-CV) by the Hemphill County District Clerk on September 25, 2013, and in this\ncause by order of the Court on April 25, 2017. Volume 2 contains 485 pages, and was filed in\nthis cause by the Hemphill County District Clerk on May 25, 2017. For citations to the Clerk’s\nRecord, Appellant uses the familiar citation format (CR[volume]:[page])\n\f                                    SUMMARY\n\n      This is an appeal from an award of attorney’s fees, costs, expenses, and a\n\nsanction—all in favor of Michael Quinn Sullivan and against Salem Abraham.\n\nMichael Quinn Sullivan proved that he incurred $296,805 in attorney’s fees from\n\nthe inception of the case until the supreme court remanded the case to the district\n\ncourt. The district court awarded Sullivan $35,000 in attorney’s fees for work prior\n\nto remand.\n\n      This result is highly unusual. In offering his attorney’s fees as a yardstick by\n\nwhich to measure reasonableness, Salem Abraham admitted that he spent nearly 4\n\ntimes the amount awarded to Sullivan by the district court. Considering the entirety\n\nof the evidence, Abraham offered a basis to challenge only about 10% of the fees\n\nSullivan proved were reasonable and necessary. The district court’s judgment,\n\n(CR2:439–40), represents a 73% downward departure from the lowest attorney’s\n\nfees figure offered by any party in this case.\n\n      Exercising his rights under Texas law, Sullivan timely requested findings of\n\nfact and conclusions of law. (CR2:441) The purpose of findings and conclusions is\n\nso that an appellant can understand the basis for a trial court’s decision and not\n\nhave to guess at the reasons. The district court did not perform its ministerial duty\n\nbecause the district court’s findings and conclusions shed no light on the reasons\n\nfor its decision. They leave Sullivan in the position of having to guess, which\n\n\n\n                                           2\n\feviscerates Sullivan’s rights to the findings and conclusions and defeats the\n\npurpose of the Rules.\n\n      Because Sullivan has a right under Texas law to obtain meaningful findings\n\nof fact and conclusions of law regarding the highly unusual judgment in this case,\n\nTEX. R. CIV. P. 297, Sullivan asks this Court to abate the appeal, refer this case to\n\nthe district court, and direct the district court to enter proper findings of fact and\n\nconclusions of law.2 This request is not made for delay, but only so that justice\n\nmay be done.\n\n                                    ARGUMENT\n\n1.    Background\n\n      This appeal follows an earlier appeal from a judgment signed by the 31st\n\nDistrict Court on August 16, 2013. (CR1:768–69) That judgment was appealed to\n\nthis Court and then to the Supreme Court of Texas. (CR1:772; CR2:4; CR2:16;\n\nCR2:18) This Court held that it was error for the district court to fail to award\n\nsanctions, which are mandatory under the Texas Citizens Participation Act.\n\nSullivan v. Abraham, 472 S.W.3d 677, 683 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 2014), rev’d in\n\npart, 488 S.W.3d 294 (Tex. 2016).\n\n      The Supreme Court of Texas further held that it was error for the district\n\ncourt to import considerations of justice and equity into the determination of\n\n2\n  Sullivan timely objected below and requested additional and amended findings of fact and\nconclusions of law. (CR2:447)\n\n\n                                            3\n\freasonable attorney’s fees. Sullivan v. Abraham, 488 S.W.3d 294, 299 (Tex. 2016).\n\nThe case was thereafter remanded to the district court for entry of judgment\n\nawarding Michael Quinn Sullivan a sanction against Salem Abraham as well as\n\ncosts, reasonable attorney’s fees, and other expenses as justice and equity require.\n\nId. at 300.\n\n2.    The “findings of fact and conclusions of law” filed by the district court\n      do not satisfy the district court’s ministerial duty to enter proper\n      findings and conclusions.\n\n      The primary purpose for findings of fact and is for a party to ascertain the\n\ntrue basis for the trial court’s decision. Rush v. Barrios, 56 S.W.3d 88, 96 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2001, pet. denied). A mere conclusion is inadequate.\n\nThompson v. Railroad Comm’n, 240 S.W.2d 759, 761–62 (Tex. 1951).\n\n      The Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law leave Michael Quinn Sullivan\n\nand this Court in the position of having to guess—in the same position he would be\n\nin if there were no findings and conclusions. When requested, trial courts must\n\nmake findings and conclusions adequate to provide an appellate court a basis upon\n\nwhich to review the trial court’s application of the law to the facts. State v. Saenz,\n\n411 S.W.3d 488, 495 (Tex. Crim. App. 2013). Error with regard to Findings of\n\nFact is harmful if it prevents an appellant from properly presenting a case to the\n\nappellate court. TEX. R. APP. P. 44.1(a)(2); Tenery v. Tenery, 932 S.W.2d 29, 30\n\n(Tex. 1996).\n\n\n\n                                          4\n\f      In this case, the trial court’s findings of fact and conclusions of law force\n\nSullivan to guess at the reasons the district court reached its decision. For example,\n\nthe text of the judgment is:\n\n             [A]fter considering the Motion, the pleadings, all of the\n             evidence before the Court, and the argument of counsel,\n             and following the mandate of the Supreme Court of\n             Texas and Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code\n             § 27.009 et seq., hereby finds that . . . Michael Quinn\n             Sullivan (“Sullivan”), shall have and recover from\n             Plaintiff, Salem Abraham (“Plaintiff”) as follows: . . .\n             Reasonable attorney’s fees from the beginning of the\n             case until remand by the Supreme Court of Texas to this\n             Court in the amount of $35,000, plus post-judgment\n             interest thereon at the statutory rate of 5% per annum\n             until paid.\n\n(CR2:439 ¶2) The trial court’s explanation in its findings sheds no\n\nlight on why the court reached this decision. It says merely:\n\n             Based upon the Court’s knowledge of attorney’s fees,\n             including the rates customarily charged in the locality for\n             similar legal services, the evidence presented on the fees\n             customarily charged in the locality for similar services,\n             the Court’s observation and evaluation of what amount of\n             legal services were provided by the attorneys for the\n             parties, and this Court’s evaluation of what level of\n             attorney’s services were reasonable and necessary in this\n             case, as well as this Court’s evaluation of the duplication\n             of legal services, and the legal services which this Court\n             believes and finds were excessive, unreasonable and\n             unnecessary, the Court finds that reasonable and\n             necessary attorney’s fees for the services of Defendant’s\n             attorneys, from the beginning of this case until remand\n             by the Supreme Court of Texas, is in the amount of\n             $35,000.00.\n\n\n\n                                          5\n\f(CR2:444–45 ¶8) The district courts findings are similarly unhelpful regarding\n\npost-remand attorney’s fees. The final judgment says:\n\n             [A]fter considering the Motion, the pleadings, all of the\n             evidence before the Court, and the argument of counsel,\n             and following the mandate of the Supreme Court of\n             Texas and Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code\n             § 27.009 et seq., hereby finds that . . . Michael Quinn\n             Sullivan (“Sullivan”), shall have and recover from\n             Plaintiff, Salem Abraham (“Plaintiff”) as follows: . . .\n             Reasonable attorney’s fees from the beginning of the\n             case until remand by the Supreme Court of Texas to this\n             Court in the amount of $35,000, plus post-judgment\n             interest thereon at the statutory rate of 5% per annum\n             until paid.\n\n(CR2:439 ¶3) The court’s explanation in its findings sheds no light on why the\n\ncourt reached this decision. It says merely:\n\n             Based upon the Court’s knowledge of fees customarily\n             charged in the locality for similar legal services, the\n             evidence presented on the fees customarily charged in the\n             locality for similar legal services, the evidence presented\n             on the fees customarily charged in the locality for similar\n             services, plus evidence of the reasonable number of hours\n             worked for similar work, and the Court’s evaluation of\n             what level of services was necessary, and what rendered\n             services were unnecessary, the Court finds that\n             reasonable and necessary attorneys’ fees for the services\n             of Defendant’s attorneys, after remand by the Supreme\n             Court, is in the amount of $7,200.00.\n\n(CR2:445 ¶9) When a trial court makes findings that are so incomplete that an\n\nappellant is forced to guess and an appellate court is unable to make a legal\n\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\fdetermination, abatement for adequate findings of fact and conclusions of law is\n\nrequired. Saenz, 411 S.W.3d at 495.\n\n3.    Abatement at this stage is proper and necessary.\n\n      Abatement at this stage of the appeal is the proper vehicle for obtaining the\n\nrequired findings and conclusions. Saenz, 411 S.W.3d at 495; Order of Abatement,\n\nChevron Phillips Chem. Co. LP v. Kingwood Crossroads LP, No. 09-14-00316-CV\n\n(Sep. 18, 2014), attached as Appendix A. If this Court abates the appeal at this\n\nearly stage, the parties will be able to brief the issues of attorney’s fees and\n\nsanctions efficiently and this Court’s ability to review the reasons for the trial\n\ncourt’s judgment will be enhanced, all with little delay and minimal wasted effort.\n\n4.    Abatement for findings of fact will help explain the basis for the highly\n      unusual judgment.\n\n      The unusual nature of the judgment is best highlighted by three\n\nconsiderations. First, the attorney’s fees provisions in the Texas Citizens\n\nParticipation Act are entitled “Damages and Costs.” TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE\n\n§ 27.009. The purpose of this portion of the Texas Citizens Participation Act is to\n\nensure that parties who are targeted by frivolous strategic lawsuits against public\n\nparticipation are made whole. Indeed, for frivolous lawsuits intended to silence\n\npublic participation and speech on issues of public concern, forcing an opponent to\n\nincur such large sums of attorney’s fees is the intended consequence: The rap is the\n\nride, because the substantive claims lack merit.\n\n                                          7\n\f         It is unbecoming to hail a defendant into court by means of false allegations\n\nand then complaint when the defendant hires skillful, experienced and expensive\n\nadvocates to defend against those allegations. Having wrongfully kicked the snow\n\nloose at the top, Salem Abraham must bear the consequences of the avalanche at\n\nthe bottom. Schwartz v. Folloder, 767 F.2d 125, 133–34 (5th Cir. 1985).\n\n         Fee awards in similar cases have been very close to the amount of fees\n\nSullivan seeks. For example, a Tarrant County district court awarded Rauhauser\n\n$300,383.94 plus a $150,000.00 sanction. McGibney v. Retzlaff, No. 67-270669-\n\n14, in the 67th District Court, Tarrant County, Texas (Apr. 14, 2016).\n\n         Second, the lowest amount of attorney’s fees incurred by either party\n\nexceeds $130,000. The district court here, without explanation or argument,\n\nawarded barely more than 25% of that amount. The district court’s fee award to\n\nSullivan represents a mere 12% of his attorneys fees. Nor are Sullivan’s fees in any\n\nway unusual or unexpected. Rauhauser’s fees in a similar case amounted to\n\napproximately $300,000 too. Id.\n\n         Finally, the discrepancy in the hours spent by the respective sides’ attorneys\n\nare, apples-to-apples, quite similar. The table below, based on evidence that was\n\nbefore the district court when it ruled, summarizes an apples-to-apples comparison\n\nof the time spent on this case by the respective sides.3\n\n\n3\n    (CR2:36–60; CR2:82–83; CR2:406–07)\n\n\n                                            8\n\fPhase                             Plaintiff Abraham            Defendant Sullivan\n\nDistrict Court                       177.2 hours                   140.9 hours\n\nSeventh Court of Appeals            127.85 hours                   131.2 hours\n\nSupreme Court of Texas               246.2 hours                  250.72 hours\n\nTotal, apples-to-apples             551.25 hours                  523.82 hours\n\n\n        The only hours excluded from this apples-to-apples comparison are the\n\nhours incurred by Sullivan’s counsel in preparing the reply brief in this court, the\n\nreply in support of Sullivan’s petition for review in the supreme court, and\n\nSullivan’s reply brief on the merits in the supreme court. In total, Sullivan’s\n\ncounsel spent 184.8 hours on these three briefs. (CR2:36–60) As shown to the\n\ndistrict court (CR2:406–07) and summarized above, the discrepancy in the\n\nnumbers of hours spent on this case by the respective parties’ counsel is entirely\n\nattributable to the procedural posture of this case. Sullivan was the appellant in this\n\ncourt and the petitioner in the supreme court. Appellants reasonably and routinely\n\nfile reply briefs, and Petitioners in the supreme court reasonably and routinely file\n\nboth a Reply in Support of their Petition for Review as well as a Reply Brief on the\n\nMerits. Salem Abraham himself has followed this practice. Reply Brief of Salem\n\nAbraham, Abraham v. Greer, No. 07-12-00494-CV (Apr. 5, 2013).\n\n\n\n\n                                          9\n\f      These three considerations, separately and together, suggest that the district\n\ncourt’s judgment is highly unusual in light of the applicable law and the facts\n\nbefore that court when it ruled.\n\n5.    Abatement for findings of fact will permit the district court to analyze\n      Texas law and identify how the court applied the facts to the law.\n\n      Pursuant to TEX. R. CIV. P. 296, Michael Quinn Sullivan filed a request for\n\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law on March 7, 2017. (CR2:441) When\n\nrequested, Findings of Fact and Conclusions of law are required by Texas law in\n\ncases, like this one, where the trial court decides attorneys’ fees without a jury.\n\nHeafner & Assocs. v. Koecher, 851 S.W.2d 309, 313 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st\n\nDist.] 1992, no writ). The primary purpose for findings of fact and is for a party to\n\nascertain the true basis for the trial court’s decision. Rush v. Barrios, 56 S.W.3d\n\n88, 96 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2001, pet. denied). Therefore, the trial\n\ncourt was required to file adequate findings of fact and conclusions of law\n\nexplaining the true basis for its decision on or before March 27, 2017, twenty days\n\nafter Sullivan’s timely request. TEX. R. CIV. P. 297.\n\n      The district court was required to award Sullivan reasonable attorney’s\n\nfees—that is, a fee that is not excessive or extreme, but moderate or fair. Sullivan\n\nv. Abraham, 488 S.W.3d at 299. The district court was therefore required to\n\nexplain the basis of its attorney’s fee award in light of the time and labor involved,\n\nthe novelty and difficulty involved, the skill required to perform the legal services\n\n                                          10\n\fproperly, the exclusion from other employment by the attorneys because they\n\naccepted this case, the customary fee, time limitations, the experience and\n\nreputation of the counsel, awards in similar cases, the amount in controversy, the\n\nnature and length of the relationship between attorney and counsel, and the results\n\nobtained. Arthur Andersen & Co. v. Perry Equip. Corp., 945 S.W.2d 812, 818\n\n(Tex. 1997).\n\n      In the event the district court found a particular rate as unreasonable, in\n\norder to explain its decision, the court would need to say that rate was\n\nunreasonable as well as the basis on which the court concluded that a different rate\n\nwas reasonable—specifying that rate, too. The only way for the respective parties\n\nto know what work the district court may have considered unnecessary,\n\nunreasonable, or duplicative, it was the district court’s ministerial duty to specify\n\nwhat work the court considered unnecessary or duplicative.\n\n      Sullivan provided to the district court every single time entry for every\n\nsingle timekeeper from the beginning of this case. But nowhere in the district\n\ncourt’s findings and conclusions did it identify a single duplicative time entry.\n\nNowhere in the district court’s findings and conclusions did it specify what\n\nservices were excessive, unreasonable, or unnecessary. For that matter, Abraham’s\n\nown evidence and argument never identified a single time entry wherein the\n\nservices offered were duplicative, unreasonable, or unnecessary.\n\n\n\n                                         11\n\f       Nowhere in the district court’s “findings and conclusions” did it identify\n\nwhat a reasonable hourly rate is for legal services of the kind provided in this case.\n\nNowhere in the district court’s “findings and conclusions” did that court identify\n\nthe number of hours that would have been reasonable to expend in defense of a\n\nFirst Amendment case seeking millions of dollars in damages, achieve success in\n\npart on appeal to an intermediate court, and then achieve success on the remaining\n\nlegal issues in the court of last resort in Texas.4\n\n                            CONCLUSION AND PRAYER\n\n       Under Texas law, appellants cannot be forced to guess at the reasons\n\nmotivating a trial court’s judgment. However, that is precisely the scenario created\n\nby the findings and conclusions entered in this case. They shed no light on why the\n\ntrial court entered judgment by departing downward 73% from the lowest figure\n\noffered by any party for pre-remand attorney’s fees. In fact, the trial court’s\n\nfindings and conclusions recite the judgment nearly verbatim.\n\n       The controlling issue is whether, under the circumstances of the case, the\n\nappellant is required to guess at the reasons for the trial court’s decision. Elliott v.\n\nKraft Foods N. Am., Inc., 118 S.W.3d 50, 54–55 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.]\n\n2003, no pet.). Based on the factors identified above and in light of the highly\n\nunusual decision, Sullivan is left to guess and this court could not meaningfully\n\n4\n Sullivan timely objected and requested additional and amended findings of fact and conclusions\nof law. (CR2:447)\n\n\n                                              12\n\freview the district court’s findings and conclusions. Sullivan is left as though no\n\nFindings of Fact or Conclusions of Law were ever filed and the trial court simply\n\nrefused to fulfill its ministerial duty to enter findings and conclusions explaining\n\nthe true basis for its decision.5 Brooks v. Housing Auth. of El Paso, 926 S.W.2d\n\n316, 319 (Tex. App.—El Paso 1996, no writ).\n\n       Therefore, Michael Quinn Sullivan respectfully asks this Court to:\n\n       1. Abate this appeal for 40 days;\n\n       2. Direct the district court to:\n\n             (a) file proper findings of fact and conclusions of law within 20\n       days of an order by this Court granting this motion, pursuant to TEX.\n       R. CIV. P. 297;\n\n             (b) Allow the parties 10 days after the filing of Findings of Fact\n       and Conclusions of Law to request additional and amended Findings\n       of Fact and Conclusions of Law, pursuant to TEX. R. CIV. P. 298;\n\n             (c) File any additional or amended findings and conclusions\n       within 10 days after such request is filed, pursuant to TEX. R. CIV. P.\n       298;\n\n       3. Suspend all appellate deadlines while the case is abated; and,\n\n       4. Grant any other relief necessary to facilitate the preparation and filing of\n\nadequate Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law.\n5\n  This motion to abate focuses for illustrative purposes on the award of $35,000 in attorney’s fees\nto Sullivan for defending this case in the district court and then successfully prosecuting an\nappeal in this court and for successfully prosecuting a further appeal to the Supreme of Texas.\nSullivan provides this focus for brevity and for illustrative purposes only, and without waiver of\nhis other arguments. Sullivan is also entitled to have the district court explain why the court\nawarded only $7,200 in attorney’s fees on remand, and only a $15,000 sanction in a case filed\nafter Plaintiff Abraham knew he could not recover damages from Michael Quinn Sullivan, but\nsought tens of millions of dollars anyway.\n\n\n                                                13\n\fRespectfully submitted,\n\nAKERMAN LLP\n\nBy:_/s/ Nicholas D.

In an earlier appeal from the underlying trial, the\n\nappellate court reversed part of the judgment on the jury’s verdict and remanded\n\nthe case to the trial court “for determination of the amount of attorneys’ fees\n\nKingwood CrossRoads[, L.P.] is entitled to recover for its defense of CP Chem’s\n\nbreach-of-contract claim.” See Chevron Phillips Chem. Co. LP v. Kingwood\n\n                                        1\n\fCrossRoads, L.P., 346 S.W.3d 37, 78 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2011, pet.\n\ndenied). The Court of Appeals instructed that the case was remanded “for\n\nKingwood CrossRoads to segregate these fees or demonstrate segregation is not\n\nrequired and for the trial court to determine the amount of fees recoverable for\n\ndefense of CP Chem’s contract claim.” Id. at 70. On remand, the trial court\n\ndetermined that the amount of attorneys’ fees recoverable by Kingwood\n\nCrossroads, L.P. (“KCR”) for its defense of CP Chem’s contract claim is\n\n$2,648,101.50 plus post-judgment interest and additional sums in the event of\n\nfurther appeals. The trial court denied CP Chem’s request for findings of fact and\n\nconclusions of law. In its response filed in opposition to the appellant’s motion to\n\nabate, KCR argues that CP Chem is not entitled to findings of fact and conclusions\n\nof law because the proceeding on remand was not evidentiary in nature.\n\n      We abate the appeal and remand the case to the trial court for entry of\n\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 298. If the trial court\n\nresolved all issues as questions of law, without deciding any facts, it shall so state\n\nin its conclusions of law. The trial court shall allow the parties ten days after the\n\ntrial court signs its findings of fact and conclusions of law to request additional\n\nfindings and conclusions. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 298. The appeal is abated and all\n\nappellate timetables are suspended while the case is before the trial court.

McGibney, 2014 Tex. App. LEXIS 13290 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth\n2014, no pet.) (remanding this case for award of attorney's fees and sanctions), defendant Neal Rauhauser's motion\nto award attorney's fees and sanctions pursuant to TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE § 27.001, et seq., Rauhauser's\n“Notice of Plaintiffs' New Criminal Aggravating Misconduct and Request for Nonmonetary Sanctions,” the original\nand supplemental affidavits for attorney's fees of Rauhauser attorney Jeffrey L. Dorrell and fee statements appended\nthereto, the “liberal construction” directive to Texas courts in TEX. Civ. PRAC. & REM. CODE § 27.011(b), plaintiffs'\nresponse to Rauhauser's motion, the pleadings, and other affidavits and evidence on file, the Court finds:\n(i) Plaintiffs' brought this suit against Rauhauser willfully and maliciously to injure Rauhauser by deterring Rauhauser\nfrom exercising his constitutional rights—specifically, to truthfully criticize plaintiffs;\n\n(ii) Plaintiffs brought this suit against Rauhauser with objective substantial certainty that the suit would inflict litigation\ncosts on Rauhauser;\n\n(iii) Plaintiffs filed multiple lawsuits in two states at substantially the same time making substantially the same allegations;\n\n(iv) Plaintiffs brought their suits against Rauhauser in conscious disregard of plaintiffs' duties or of Rauhauser's rights\nand without just cause or excuse;\n\n(v) Plaintiffs' filing of multiple SLAPP suits in two states at substantially the same time making substantially the same\nallegations manifests plaintiffs' intent to continue using baseless suits to retaliate against, punish, and deter plaintiffs'\nenemies, and necessitates a significant deterrent sanction;\n\n(vi) Plaintiffs engaged in aggravating misconduct by willfully and intentionally harassing—and using confederates to\nwillfully and intentionally harass—both Rauhauser and Rauhauser's attorney, the objective of which was to punish the\nexercise of Rauhauser's constitutional rights in the past, deter the exercise of Rauhausr's constitutional rights in the\nfuture, and impair Rauhauser's ability to retain legal counsel in defense of plaintiffs' baseless claims; and\n\n(vii) Plaintiffs' aggressive filing of multiple lawsuits and aggravating misconduct caused Rauhauser to incur $300,383.84\nin attorney's fees to defend through trial and appeal.\n\n\n\nAs to Rauhauser's requested attorney's fees, the Court finds that affidavit evidence of Rauhauser's attorney's fees\nsubmitted complies with TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE § 18.001(c) and was not controverted pursuant to §\n\n\n\n               © 2017 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                           1\n\fMcGibney v. Retzlaff, 2016 WL 1703694 (2016)\n\n\n18.001(e). Accordingly, the Court admits into evidence for purposes of this order the original and supplemental affidavits\nof attorney Jeffrey L. Dorrell and finds the amounts of attorney's fees stated therein to be reasonable in accordance with\nTEX. Civ. PRAC. & REM. CODE § 18.001(b). The Court has considered the factors set forth in TEX. DISCIPLINARY\nR. PROF. CONDUCT 1.04, STATE BAR RULES, Art. 10 § 9, Rule 1.04; see Arthur Andersen & Co. v. Perry Equip.\nCorp., 945 S.W.2d 812, 818 (Tex. 1997). As a result, the Court makes the following specific findings as to each:\n\n\n                                              (i) The time and labor required.\n\n *2 The time spent by each attorney or staff member rendering services to Rauhauser on each specific task was\ncontemporaneously logged and quantified to the nearest one-tenth of an hour, and totaled over 600 hours as of September\n6, 2015, for trial, appeal, and remand.\n\n\n                                  (ii) The novelty and difficulty of the questions involved.\n\nThe TCPA is a relatively new statute enacted on June 17, 2011. Many issues have arisen in Texas appellate courts\nregarding interpretation and application of its provisions. These include the constitutionality of the TCPA itself, whether\na plaintiff's nonsuit can defeat application of the TCPA, whether the TCPA's provision for awarding attorney's fees is\nmandatory, whether the TCPA's provision for awarding sanctions “sufficient to deter the filing of similar actions” is\nmandatory, whether review of a trial court's failure to rule on the motion is by interlocutory appeal or petition for writ\nof mandamus, whether the TCPA applies to “non-public” speech, and what constitutes a “matter of public concern,”\nand whether an appellate court can reverse and render judgment on attorney's fees and sanctions or must remand to the\ntrial court for further proceedings. Several of these were presented in the case at bar, including, without limitation:\n\n(A) Plaintiffs argued both in this Court and on appeal that they were immunized from the TCPA's remedies because\nRauhauser chose to appear and defend their defamation SLAPP suit without ever having been served. This was an\nissue on which no appellate court had spoken in the context of the TCPA at the time plaintiffs raised it. The issue\nrequired extensive research and briefing in order for Rauhauser to prevail over plaintiffs' argument in the court of appeals.\nRauhauser v. McGibney is now extensively cited in law review articles and practice manuals on this point.\n\n(B) Plaintiffs argued both in this Court and on appeal that they were immunized from the TCPA's remedies because\nplaintiffs nonsuited their claims approximately 5 hours after Rauhauser filed his TCPA motion to dismiss. This was\nalso an issue on which no appellate court had spoken in the context of the TCPA at the time plaintiffs raised it. The\nissue required extensive research and briefing in order for Rauhauser to prevail over plaintiffs' argument in the court of\nappeals. Rauhauser v. McGibney is now extensively cited in law review articles and practice manuals on this point, too.\n\n(C) It was necessary for Rauhauser to show that plaintiff McGibney was a “public figure” in order for the TCPA to apply\nto the defamation claims made in the case at bar. This issue required extensive research into James McGibney's personal\nbackground, prior statements, and litigation. This research ultimately resulted in discovery of extensive evidence of\nMcGibney's many media appearances, and even the affidavit of a McGibney expert filed in a Nevada lawsuit admitting\nthat McGibney was a public figure.\n\nAs a result, the novelty and difficult of the questions presented in the case at bar justifies both the more-than-600 hours\nexpended in trial, appeal, and on remand, and the hourly rates charged.\n\n\n                                  (iii) The skill requisite to perform the service properly.\n\nThe area of free speech, defamation claims, and the TCPA is highly specialized and complex.

Retzlaff, 2016 WL 1703694 (2016)\n\n\nproved and which party has the burden of proof took on a complexity not seen in any other tort practice. The enactment\nof the TCPA in 2011 added a new layer of complexity, magnified by the fact that new appellate opinions changing\nor clarifying the interpretation of the statute are released on an almost weekly basis. These are not topics or issues\non which “canned” briefing is available or on which the law is well-settled. Each issue requires independent research\nand meticulous briefing. This practice area requires an extremely high degree of skill to perform services properly. The\nattorneys performing services for Rauhauser possessed the high degree of skill required.\n\n\n                              (iv) The likelihood, if apparent to the client, that acceptance of\n                             the representation will preclude other employment by the lawyer.\n\n *3 The over-600 hours of time expended by attorneys and staff of Hanszen Laporte over the 20 months in which\nthat firm represented Rauhauser— through trial, then through an appeal (including oral argument), and on remand for\nattorney's fees and sanctions—precluded employment on other cases. Most of this time was been expended by attorney\nJeffrey L. Dorrell, and represents approximately 25% of all time expended by that attorney on all legal matters during\nthe relevant time period. Hanszen Laporte has 11 attorneys and a steady supply of paying clients on whose cases or\nmatters Dorrell could have worked if he had not chosen to render services to Rauhauser. This is proven by the fact that\nHanszen Laporte's revenues have grown by 178% during the three years immediately preceding the date of this affidavit,\nranking it 50 th out of all companies in Houston in revenue growth (the “Houston Fast 100”) and 28 th out of all Houston\ncompanies owned or managed by graduates of the University of Houston (the “Cougar 100”).\n\n\n                         (v) The fee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal services.\n\nIn cases of defamation, First Amendment, and TCPA motions, there is no “locality” in the sense that attorneys in one\n“locality” might charge a higher price or hourly rate to draft a will for a client than attorneys in another “locality.” The\npractice is so complex and specialized that only a small number of Texas attorneys are qualified to perform services for\nclients. Those highly-qualified attorneys travel to where a case is pending. Here, the “locality” is more accurately seen\nas the entire state of Texas. The hourly rate of $550.00 is comparable to that of the small number of similarly-qualified\nattorneys in this field practicing in Texas.\n\n\n                                    (vi) The amount involved and the results obtained.\n\nPlaintiffs sued Rauhauser for $1,000,000.00 in federal and state courts of two different states, including the case at bar.\nThe Court takes judicial notice that, as a direct result of the efforts and highly competent representation of Hanszen\nLaporte, all claims against Rauhauser in all suits were ultimately disposed in his favor. Considerations of the amount in\ncontroversy and results obtained weigh heavily in favor of the Court's finding that the fee charged to Rauhauser in the\ncase at bar was reasonable and that justice and equity require it to be awarded to Rauhauser.\n\n\n                           (vii) Time limitations imposed by the client or by the circumstances.\n\nThe “circumstances” of the TCPA impose several accelerated deadlines, both in the trial and appellate phases of litigation\npractice. These inflexible deadlines must be recognized and complied with, and take priority over more common deadlines\nin normal litigation. These deadlines thus require special efforts that necessarily increase the amount of attorney's\nfees that can be said to be “reasonable.” Other circumstances include plaintiffs' aggressive abuse and harassment of\nRauhauser's defense attorney—designed to deprive Rauhauser of the benefit of legal representation.\n\n\n                        (viii) The nature and length of the professional relationship with the client.\n\n\n\n               © 2017 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                       3\n\fMcGibney v. Retzlaff, 2016 WL 1703694 (2016)\n\n\nNeither attorney Jeffrey L. Dorrell nor any member of Hanszen Laporte, LLP, or its staff has any prior professional\nrelationship with defendant Neal Rauhauser. After 19 months of representation, attorney Dorrell has never met\nRauhauser, who does not reside in Texas. After plaintiffs sued Rauhauser, Rauhauser's online research of Dorrell's\npast SLAPP-suit appellate victories led him to request Dorrell's representation. The representation was an arm's-length\ntransaction, with no attendant considerations to call into question the reasonableness of the hourly rates charged or the\nnumber of hours expended. This was not “pro bono” representation of a past or existing client as a courtesy for past\nbusiness.\n\n\n               (ix) The experience, reputation, and ability of the lawyer or lawyers performing the services.\n\nThe experience, reputations, and abilities of the lawyers performing the services for Rauhauser were of the highest caliber\nand were readily apparent to the Court at all phases of the litigation.\n\n\n                              (x) Whether the fee is fixed or contingent on results obtained or\n                             uncertainty of collection before legal services have been rendered.\n\n *4 The fee negotiated in the engagement letter signed by Neal Rauhauser called for payment of an initial retainer of\n$1,500.00, which Rauhauser paid, and for future billings at a rate of $550.00 per hour for Dorrell's services. Hanszen\nLaporte, LLP, sent Rauhauser regular monthly bills showing services provided and amounts incurrerd. Rauhauser is\ncontractually liable to pay these amounts. The firm of Hanszen Laporte advanced expenses on Rauhauser's behalf\nand carried a receivable of over $300,000.00 with a significant risk that no payment would ever be collected. This was\nanticipated at the time the representation was commenced (although not to the extent it ultimately reached), and the\nfirm's usual hourly rates for noncontingent fee cases were adjusted upward by approximately 50% to reflect this risk.\nThese facts, too, weigh heavily in favor of the Court's finding that the fee charged in the case at bar was reasonable, and\nthat the interests of justice and equity require that it be awarded to Rauhauser from plaintiffs in full measure.\n\nTherefore, the Court GRANTS Rauhauser's motion and orders that plaintiffs James McGibney and ViaView, Inc., shall,\njointly and severally, pay to defendant Neal Rauhauser the following amounts:\n(i) Total reasonable attorney's fees, litigation expenses, and court costs for the trial and first appeal of $300,383.84, as\njustice and equity require;\n\n(ii) Sanctions sufficient to deter the filing of similar actions by plaintiffs in the future of $150,000.00.\n\n(iii) Conditional appellate attorney's fees of $50,000.00 for a second appeal to the court of appeals, which such appeal\ndoes not result in a complete reversal of all amounts awarded; and\n\n(iv) Conditional appellate attorney's fees of $25,000.00 if a petition for review is filed in the Texas Supreme Court, which\nsuch petition does not result in a complete reversal of all amounts awarded.\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs shall pay the foregoing amounts, except for the conditional awards of appellate attorney's fees, to Neal\nRauhauser not later than 30 days after the date this order is signed.\n\nFurthermore, in view of plaintiffs' history of filing numerous lawsuits with the willful, malicious intent to injure those\nwho have spoken critically of plaintiffs, the Court finds that monetary sanctions alone will not be sufficient to deter\nplaintiffs from filing similar such suits in the future. Therefore, in addition to the monetary sanctions awarded above,\nthe Court orders the following nonmonetary sanctions:\n\n\n\n\n               © 2017 Thomson Reuters.

Retzlaff, 2016 WL 1703694 (2016)\n\n\n(i) Plaintiffs shall disclose and transfer to Rauhauser the following domain names registered and used by plaintiffs days\nafter the date on which the Court signs its order;\n\nnealrauhauser.com\n\nnealrauhauser.exposed\n\nrauhauserunmasked.com\n\nnealrauhauser.org\n\nnealrauhauser.net\n\nnealrauhauser.info\n\n(ii) Plaintiffs shall disclose all domain names that plaintiffs or their agents have registered using, any form of the name\nof attorney “Jeffrey L. Dorrell” no later than 5 days after the date on which the Court signs its order:\n\n(iii) Plaintiffs shall publish for 365 consecutive days a written apology on the first page of all websites owned by either\nplaintiff for calling Rauhauser a “woman beater” and “pedophile supporter” and admitting that plaintiffs had no\nevidence to support such accusations when they made them.\n\n(iv) Plaintiffs shall publish for 365 consecutive days a written apology on the first page of all websites owned by either\nplaintiff for calling Dorrell a “pedophile” and admitting that plaintiffs had no evidence to support such an accusation\nwhen they made it.\n\n\n\nThis is a final, appealable order that disposes of all parties and claims in this suit.\n\n\nSIGNED the 14 th day of April, of 2016.\n\n<<signature>>\n\nPRESIDING JUDGE\n\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                © 2017 Thomson Reuters.

Salem\n\nAbraham sued Michael Quinn Sullivan based upon Abraham’s speculation that\n\nSullivan was the source for a news article regarding Abraham’s activities at a\n\npolitical rally. (CR1:5).\n\n      The rally was a campaign event for then-State Representative Jim\n\nLandtroop. Abraham, a member of the board of trustees of the Canadian\n\nIndependent School District, attended the event as a public servant to “make the\n\ntrue facts known” about an ongoing debate in the campaign. (CR1:6–9). The\n\ncontroversy was whether Landtroop’s opponent increased spending while serving\n\non the board of CISD. (CR1:615).\n\n      Daniel Greer, a reporter for AgendaWise, who did not attend the event,\n\nreported on Abraham’s activities in a July 27, 2012 article. (CR1:9–10, 17). In the\n\narticle, statements were made indicating that Abraham was asked to leave the\n\nmeeting for improper conduct. (CR1:17).\n\n      In August 2012, Abraham contacted Greer and requested a correction to the\n\narticle. (CR1:11). Despite Greer’s making the correction, Abraham sued Greer and\n\nAgendaWise. (CR1:18–19, 537). Salem Abraham v. Daniel Greer & Fix the Facts\n\fFoundation d/b/a AgnedaWise (31st Dist., Hemphill Cnty.) (hereinafter “First\n\nLawsuit”).\n\n      Abraham’s First Lawsuit was dismissed under the TCPA. (CR1:534 Ex. 2 &\n\n3). On appeal, the Supreme Court of Texas clarified the constitutional standard for\n\napplying the New York Times actual malice rule to public officials in the context of\n\npublication on the internet of allegedly defamatory statements, and remanded to\n\nthis Court for a determination of Abraham’s open-courts and due process\n\nchallenges.

This Court held that\n\n(1) Abraham did not preserve his complaint regarding Greer’s invocation of the\n\njournalist’s privilege, (2) Abraham did not preserve his argument that the district\n\ncourt erred in ruling that Greer and AgendaWise were journalists, and (3) neither\n\nthe TCPA, nor the Reporter’s Shield Law, nor the two working in concert violate\n\nthe Open Courts provision of the Texas Constitution.

App.—Amarillo 2016, pet. denied).\n\n      In April 2013, Abraham filed this lawsuit based on the same statements as in\n\nthe dismissed First Lawsuit. (CR1:5). Abraham alleged that Sullivan could have\n\nbeen the source who provided information about Abraham’s activities at the rally\n\nto Greer and AgendaWise. (CR1:14). Abraham admitted in his petition that there\n\nwas no evidence that Sullivan was Greer’s source or that the two ever discussed\n\nAbraham. It is also undisputed that, like Greer, Sullivan was not in attendance at\n\n\n\n                                         2\n\fthe Levelland rally. Abraham alleged only that “it is a reasonable inference that the\n\nperson informing Daniel Greer about Salem [Abraham] was Michael Quinn\n\nSullivan” because they have daily discussions about politics. (CR1:15). Greer set\n\nthe record straight in Abraham’s First lawsuit when he testified that Sullivan did\n\nnot tell him anything about the Levelland meeting. (RR1:7–9).\n\n         Sullivan moved to dismiss this lawsuit under the TCPA. (CR1:534).\n\nPursuant to section 27.009 of the TCPA, Sullivan also requested reasonable\n\nattorney’s fees, costs, expenses, and a sanction against Abraham.1 (CR1:544, 732–\n\n38).\n\n         After conducting an evidentiary hearing, the trial court dismissed Abraham’s\n\ndefamation claim under the TCPA. (CR1:768). However, the trial court awarded\n\nSullivan only $6,500 in attorney’s fees and $1,500 in costs and expenses—a small\n\nfraction of the fees, costs, and expenses that Sullivan proved. (CR1:768).\n\nSullivan appealed the award of attorney’s fees, costs, and expenses, as well as the\n\ntrial court’s refusal to award any sanctions, which the TCPA makes mandatory.\n\nThis Court affirmed in part and reversed and remanded in part.

This Court also concluded that Sullivan’s\n\nevidence had not detailed every task performed and did not reflect the prevailing\n\nlegal rates in the Texas Panhandle. Id. at 683. The Court then remanded for the\n\ntrial court to award Sullivan mandatory sanctions against Abraham. Id. at 683.\n\n      The Supreme Court of Texas reversed, holding that considerations of justice\n\nand equity do not inform the determination of an award of reasonable attorney’s\n\nfees under the TCPA.

Id. at 300.\n\n      On remand, Sullivan offered detailed time entries that identified the work\n\nperformed, the time required, the date on which the work was performed, the\n\nlawyer who performed the work, and that lawyer’s hourly rate. (CR2:33–69). In\n\ntotal, Sullivan sought:\n\n      $1,621.60            in costs;\n\n   $296,805.00             in attorney’s fees before remand;\n\n     $12,358.50            in attorney’s fees after remand by the Supreme Court of\n                           Texas;\n\n      $17,240.03           in other expenses incurred by Sullivan that justice and\n                           equity require to be awarded.\n\n\n\n                                            4\n\f(CR2:412, 420).\n\n          The district court conducted another evidentiary hearing. This time, the trail\n\ncourt awarded Sullivan:\n\n         $1,621.60               in costs;\n\n        $35,000.00               in attorney’s fees from the beginning of the case\n                                 until remand by the Supreme Court of Texas;\n\n         $7,200.00               in attorney’s fees after remand by the Supreme\n                                 Court of Texas; and,\n\n        $17,240.03               in other expenses incurred by Sullivan that justice\n                                 and equity require to be awarded.\n\n(CR2:439–40).2\n\n          Sullivan timely requested Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law.\n\n(CR2:441). The trial court’s Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, which were\n\ndrafted by Abraham, were filed on March 20, 2017. (CR2:443). Sullivan then\n\ntimely objected to the trial court’s Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and\n\nrequested additional and amended findings and conclusions. (CR2:447). The trial\n\ndid not amend or supplement its findings and conclusions as requested by Sullivan\n\nand thus overruled Sullivan’s objections.3 This appeal ensued. (CR2:480).\n\n\n\n\n2\n Pursuant to the judgment, post-judgment interest at the rate of 5% per annum accrues on all\namounts awarded until paid. (CR2:439–40)\n3\n    See TEX. R. APP. P. 33.1(a)(2).\n\n\n\n                                                5\n\f      Sullivan moved to abate the appeal for remand to the district court for entry\n\nof more specific findings of fact and conclusions of law. (App. C) This Court\n\ndenied Sullivan’s motion to abate on July 4, 2017. (App. D)\n\n                       SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\n      The district court had a mandatory duty to exercise sound discretion in\n\nawarding Michael Quinn Sullivan reasonable attorney’s fees pursuant to the Texas\n\nCitizens Participation Act (TCPA) and the mandate of the Supreme Court of\n\nTexas. A reasonable fee is one that is moderate and fair, not excessive or extreme.\n\nThe district court awarded an excessively low and extreme fee of $35,000 for legal\n\nservices performed from the inception of this case through an appeal to this Court\n\nand an appeal to the Supreme Court of Texas, and $7,200 for legal services\n\nperformed on remand from the supreme court. This was an abuse of discretion\n\nbecause the trial court acted without reference to guiding principles—the test\n\nestablished by the Supreme Court of Texas, the Arthur Andersen factors, and the\n\nevidence adduced by the parties.\n\n      Also, no probative evidence supports Findings of Fact 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9,\n\nwhich themselves emanate from several reversibly erroneous evidentiary rulings.\n\nThere is simply no way for a reasonable factfinder to consider the record in this\n\ncase and reach the decision that the trial court reached.\n\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\f      Reversal is required for the additional reason that the broad-form damages\n\nfindings in Findings 8 and 9 commingle invalid and/or legally insufficient elements\n\nof damages, in violation of Crown Life Ins. Co. v. Casteel and its progeny. Finally,\n\nthe trial court reversibly erred in refusing to award Michael Quinn Sullivan\n\nconditional appellate fees. When an award of trial court attorney’s fees is made\n\nmandatory by statute, conditional appellate attorney’s fees in an amount supported\n\nby the evidence are also mandatory.\n\n                                  ARGUMENT\n\nI.     The district court abused its discretion in failing to follow the test\n       established by the Supreme Court of Texas for determining reasonable\n       attorney’s fees.\n\n      A.    The Supreme Court of Texas has directed that a reasonable fee is\n            fair and moderate, not excessive or extreme.\n\n      The supreme court held in this case that the TCPA requires an award of\n\nreasonable attorney’s fees to a successful movant.

He offered detailed time entries from the inception of the case through\n\nproceedings on remand. (CR2:36–59, 419–20). Sullivan also offered expert\n\ntestimony regarding the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved; the skill\n\n\n\n                                          9\n\frequired to perform the legal services properly; the fees customarily charged for\n\nsimilar services (including fees customarily charged in the locality); the amount\n\ninvolved and the results obtained; the time limitations imposed; and, the\n\nexperience, reputation, and ability of the lawyers performing the services.\n\n(CR2:66–67, 414–17).\n\n      B.    There is very little disagreement in the record about what an\n            award of reasonable fees should be.\n\n            1.     Time and labor required, novelty and difficulty of the\n                   questions, skill required to perform the legal services\n                   properly\n\n      Despite the vitriol, the record before the district court does not disclose\n\nsignificant disagreement about what a reasonable attorney’s fee award should be in\n\nthis case. Mr. Lovell, Abraham’s expert on attorney’s fees, opined that the number\n\nof “hours incurred by an opposing party in litigation” is “relevant evidence to\n\nconsider in determining” a reasonable attorney’s fee. (CR2:86 ¶39). Abraham’s\n\nexpert then compares the hours Abraham’s lawyer spent on this litigation to those\n\nspent by Sullivan’s counsel, offering the hours Abraham’s lawyers spent on the\n\ncase as a yardstick by which to measure reasonableness. (CR2:86 ¶¶39–40;\n\nCR2:100).\n\n      Attorneys for the respective parties spent, apples to apples, a very similar\n\nnumber of hours on this case—except when Abraham’s legal team spent far more\n\nhours on the case. In the original trial court proceedings, Abraham’s counsel spent\n\n\n                                        10\n\f177.2 hours on the case in addition to 23.85 paralegal hours. (CR2:82). Sullivan’s\n\ncounsel spent 140.9 hours on the case during that same period. (CR2:59, 82). The\n\nonly quibble Abraham ever offered about the number of hours Sullivan’s counsel\n\nspent on this case in the original trial court proceedings pertained to 16 hours of\n\nattorney time incurred on a Motion to Recuse. (CR2:87).4 Accordingly, there is no\n\nreasonable disagreement in the record about the reasonableness of Sullivan’s legal\n\nteam spending 141 hours on this case in the original trial court proceedings—\n\nduring which time Abraham’s legal team spent 201 hours.\n\n      The record discloses no meaningful criticism or dispute by Abraham about\n\nthe reasonableness of the number of hours Sullivan’s counsel spent on this case in\n\nthe original trial court proceedings. Nor, in light of the evidence, could there be.\n\n(CR2:86 (Abraham admitting that his counsel’s hours are relevant to determining\n\nhours reasonably spent and using his counsel’s time as a yardstick by which to\n\nmeasure the time Sullivan’s counsel spent on the case))\n\n      In the earlier proceedings in this Court:\n\n          • Abraham’s legal team spent 127.85 hours; and,\n\n          • Sullivan’s attorneys spent 172.3 hours.\n\n\n\n\n4\n  In total, Sullivan’s counsel incurred $6,187.50 in legal fees on the Motion to Recuse.\n(CR2:405) Abraham never disputed that this amount was incurred on that Motion.\n\n\n\n                                          11\n\f(CR2:82). This discrepancy was reasonably explained by the fact that, as the\n\nappellant, Sullivan reasonably filed a reply brief. Comparing apples to apples, the\n\nhours spent by the parties on their respective principal briefs and oral argument are\n\nremarkably similar:\n\n          • Abraham’s legal team spent 127.85 hours; and,\n\n          • Sullivan’s attorneys spent 131.2 hours.\n\n(CR2:406–07). The 41-hour discrepancy between the two sides’ hours is due\n\nentirely to the reply brief, as a meaningful examination of the detailed time entries\n\ndemonstrates. (CR2:407). No facts or evidence tend to contradict this explanation.\n\n      The hours the parties spent on this case in the Supreme Court of Texas\n\nfollow the same pattern. For the petition, response, the respective principal merits\n\nbriefs, and oral argument:\n\n          • Abraham’s legal team spent 250.72 hours; and,\n\n          • Sullivan’s attorneys spent 246.2 hours.\n\n(CR2:407). The difference in the overall number of hours spent by the parties is\n\nentirely accounted for by the Reply in Support of Sullivan’s Petition for Review\n\n(51 hours) and Sullivan’s Reply Brief on the Merits (92.7 hours). (CR2:407).\n\nSullivan pointed out in detail to the district court that the discrepancies in the hours\n\nspent on this case were explained by the preparation and filing of replies (which\n\nappellants and petitioners are required to do under the Rules of Appellate\n\n\n                                          12\n\fProcedure). (CR2:405–07). No facts or evidence tends to contradict this\n\nexplanation.\n\n      Accordingly, on the record before the district court, there was no meaningful\n\ndispute about the reasonableness of Sullivan’s counsel’s having spent 128 hours on\n\nthis case in the original district court proceedings, or 131.2 hours on this case in the\n\nfirst appeal in this Court, or 246.2 hours in the Supreme Court of Texas.\n\n      Regarding the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved and the skill\n\nrequired to perform the legal services properly, it cannot be escaped that, on the\n\nevidence before the district court, this Court had never used the term “anti-SLAPP”\n\nin an opinion, and had cited Section 27.003 only once—in Abraham’s case against\n\nDaniel Greer. (CR2:415). Abraham v. Greer, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">731</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.

The district court’s decision\n\nin this case was reversed in part by this Court, and in other respects by the\n\nSupreme Court of Texas. Prior to the supreme court’s clarification of Texas law in\n\nthis case, there was considerable confusion among courts of appeal in Texas about\n\nwhat considerations inform a determination of reasonable attorney’s fees under the\n\nTCPA and how to review those awards. See, e.g., Rauhauser v. McGibney, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">377</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 389–90 (Tex.

App.—Dallas 2014, pet. denied). On these facts, any\n\n\n\n\n                                          13\n\fsuggestion that the issues involved were not novel or the services required were not\n\ndifficult, (CR2:90), cannot be entertained.5\n\n              2.      Likelihood that the acceptance of the particular\n                      employment will preclude other employment by the lawyer\n\n       Abraham’s expert opined that, because the likelihood that Sullivan’s\n\nattorneys would ever be retained by Abraham, this factor did not merit an upward\n\nadjustment of fees. (CR2:91). Sullivan did not seek an upward adjustment of fees\n\nbased on this factor. (CR2:66).\n\n              3.      Fee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal\n                      services\n\n       There is little disagreement about rates in the record, too. Abraham admitted\n\nthat a rate of $375 would be reasonable for an experienced attorney, and $225\n\nwould be reasonable for an associate. (CR2:91). In the context of the evidence,\n\nAbraham complained about partner rates in the district court and in this Court, and\n\nabout associate rates in the supreme court. Even if the district court agreed with\n\nAbraham’s expert’s testimony about rates, the evidence supports, at most, an 8%\n\ndiscount—$24,528 off of the $296,805 in fees at issue. (CR2:404–05).\n\n\n5\n  Indeed, the statistics from the Texas Office of Court Administration demonstrate that it is\nextraordinarily difficult to convince the Supreme Court of Texas to grant a petition for review,\nlike Sullivan did in this case. The supreme court grants only about 11% of the petitions filed in\nthat court in a fiscal year.

Amount involved and results obtained\n\n         Abraham sought tens of millions of dollars in damages in his defamation\n\nsuit. (RR1:66. See also CR1:325 (claiming to have been damaged in “very large\n\namounts of money”)) Abraham’s expert’s testimony avoided acknowledging this\n\nindisputable fact, instead preferring to cast the first appeal as an attempt to recover\n\nthe trial fees not awarded in the first judgment. (CR2:91–92). That evidence is\n\nincorrect and incomplete; no reasonable factfinder could have credited it as a\n\nmatter of law.\n\n         Even after the dismissal of Abraham’s defamation claim, significant issues\n\nremained. They included an award of costs, reasonable attorney’s fees, other\n\nexpenses, and a sanction—potentially very large—that Texas law required be\n\nawarded to Sullivan. Sullivan v.

Ct., Tarrant Cnty.) (Apr. 14, 2016).6 Three significant legal issues also\n\nremained: (1) whether a district court had discretion under the TCPA to refuse to\n\naward a sanction that the TCPA says “shall” be awarded, TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.\n\nCODE § 27.009(a)(2); and, (2) whether considerations of justice and equity properly\n\ninform an award of costs, id. § 27.009(a)(1); and, (3) whether considerations of\n\n6\n    Available at App. E.\n\n\n                                             15\n\fjustice and equity properly inform a district court’s determination of a reasonable\n\nattorney’s fee, id. § 27.009(a)(1).\n\n      Regarding the results obtained, Sullivan prevailed on all three legal issues.\n\nSullivan, 472 S.W.3d at 683 (issue 1); Sullivan, 488 S.W.3d at 299 (issues 2 and\n\n3). Sullivan also obtained a $15,000 sanction, Sullivan has now been awarded the\n\nentirety of his costs and other expenses up through the time of the district court’s\n\njudgment, and Sullivan obtained a significantly increased award of attorney’s fees.\n\n(CR2:439–40).\n\n             5.     The time limitations imposed by client or circumstances\n\n      Neither party sought an adjustment of attorney’s fees on the basis of any\n\ntime limitation. (CR2:67, 92).\n\n             6.     Nature and length of professional relationship between\n                    lawyer and client\n\n      There is no basis in the record for any specific adjustment of an attorney’s\n\nfee award based on the nature and length of the professional relationship between\n\nSullivan and his counsel. (CR2:67, 93). Nor did Abraham’s expert provide any\n\nspecific basis for his opinion that Sullivan’s counsel had represented him for any\n\nlength of time, or that the rates sought were not discounted. There is no evidence\n\nanywhere that Sullivan’s counsel represented him in any litigation before Salem\n\nAbraham sued Sullivan; they did not.\n\n\n\n\n                                        16\n\f             7.    Experience, reputation, and ability of the lawyers\n\n      There is no dispute between the parties regarding an adjustment of the\n\nattorney’s fee award based on the experience, reputation, or ability of any lawyer\n\ninvolved in this case. (CR2:67, 93).\n\n             8.    Whether the fee is fixed or contingent on results obtained or\n                   uncertainty of collection\n\n      Neither party sought an adjustment of fees based on a contingency of\n\ncollection before the legal services were performed. (CR2:67, 93).\n\n      C.     The district court failed to apply the law correctly and acted\n             without reference to guiding principles.\n\n      The determination of whether a trial court abused its discretion is a question\n\nof law. Jackson v. VanWinkle, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1677311\"><a href=\"/opinion/1677311/jackson-v-van-winkle/\"><span class=\"volume\">660</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">807</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 810 (Tex. 1983). A trial court\n\nabuses its discretion when it acts arbitrarily and unreasonably, without reference to\n\nguiding rules or principles, or when it misapplies the law to the established facts of\n\nthe case.

A trial\n\ncourt has no discretion to determine what the law is or in applying the law to the\n\nfacts and, consequently, the trial court’s failure to analyze or apply the law\n\ncorrectly is an abuse of discretion.

The award of attorney’s fees is extreme and excessively low and\n\nmust be reversed.\n\n      As demonstrated above, there was little disagreement between the parties\n\nregarding what would be a reasonable attorney’s fee in this case. As shown above:\n\n   • Comparing similar tasks, the parties spent nearly the same number of\n     hours on this case.\n\n   • The hours discrepancy between the parties comes entirely from the\n     reply brief in the first appeal in this Court (41.1 hours, CR2:34–56,\n     407), the Reply in Support of Sullivan’s Petition for Review (51\n     hours, CR2:34–56, 407), and Sullivan’s Reply Brief on the Merits in\n     the Supreme Court of Texas (92.7 hours, CR2:34–56, 407). Because\n     of the procedural posture of this case, Abraham’s counsel did not\n     prepare replies. They performed substantially less work, and\n     nevertheless incurred in excess of $130,000 in attorney’s fees prior to\n     remand. (CR2:82–83).\n\n   • Among the Arthur Andersen factors, there was material divergence\n     between the parties’ positions only with respect to the amount at issue\n     and the results obtained. But no expert opinion can undo the fact that\n     Abraham himself sued for tens of millions of dollars, or that Sullivan\n     prevailed on the legal issues, clarified important Texas law, and stood\n     to gain significant sums by virtue of the original appeal. Abraham’s\n     expert’s testimony was incorrect as a matter of law, as the opinions of\n     this Court and the supreme court show, and as the judgment of the\n     district court also demonstrates.\n\n      If the district court had considered the Arthur Andersen factors in order to\n\naward a fair or moderate attorney’s fee as instructed by the Supreme Court of\n\n\n                                         18\n\fTexas, it could not have awarded $35,000 for all work done prior to remand\n\nbecause:\n\n             • The $35,000 award is substantially less than the attorney’s fees\n               Abraham says he reasonably incurred in the original trial court\n               proceedings. (CR2:82);\n\n             • When awarding trial attorney’s fees is mandated by statute, an\n               award of conditional appellate fees supported by evidence is\n               also mandatory.

Abraham defended an award of $6,500 in attorney’s fees all the way to\n\nthe Supreme Court of Texas, all the while knowing that he had incurred nearly\n\n$50,000 in fees in the original trial court proceedings. (CR2:82). Now, having\n\nacknowledged that the hours his legal team spent on this litigation are a relevant\n\nfactor in ascertaining a reasonable number of hours for Sullivan’s legal team to\n\nhave spent, and knowing that, apples to apples, the parties spent nearly an identical\n\nnumber of hours on this case, Abraham defends an award of $35,000 in attorney’s\n\nfees while knowing that his legal team incurred 3.4 times that amount. (CR2:82–\n\n83). Abraham’s own unreasonable positions—themselves a lagniappe on his\n\n\n\n                                          25\n\fadmission that his defamation claim was frivolous from the start—have prohibited\n\nthe cessation of this litigation.

Salem Abraham sued Sullivan for defamation despite\n                   knowing prior to filing suit that Sullivan was not Greer’s\n                   source.\n\n      No evidence supports Finding of Fact 5 or 6. (CR2:444; CR2:448\n\n(preserved)) Abraham himself admitted facts that necessarily mean this lawsuit\n\nwas filed in violation of Rule 13 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. Abraham’s\n\nfiling this lawsuit was an effort to punish Michael Quinn Sullivan for Daniel\n\nGreer’s actions. (CR1:9–12). Abraham’s pleadings acknowledge that Michael\n\nQuinn Sullivan was not present at the Honeycomb Pie Shop event that was the\n\nsubject of Daniel Greer’s blog post. (CR1:14–15). Abraham also acknowledges\n\nthat Michael Quinn Sullivan published a story about the same event. (CR1:14).\n\nAbraham sued Sullivan for alleged libel done by Greer and AgendaWise, not for\n\nanything Sullivan himself did. (CR1:9–12).\n\n      When Abraham filed this lawsuit, Daniel Greer had already sworn under\n\noath that Michael Quinn Sullivan was not his source. (RR3:94). Abraham was\n\npresent when Greer made such testimony. (RR3:94). Abraham admitted that he had\n\nno facts tending to contradict Greer’s sworn testimony. (RR3:94).\n\n\n\n\n                                          26\n\f      Michael Quinn Sullivan had also already sworn under oath that he had\n\nprovided no information to Greer regarding Greer’s story. (RR3:95). Abraham was\n\npresent during this testimony, too. (RR3:95). Abraham admitted that he had no\n\nfacts tending to contradict Sullivan’s sworn testimony. (RR3:95).\n\n      Abraham further admitted that, even after filing this lawsuit, he had no\n\ninformation tending to inculpate Michael Quinn Sullivan. (RR3:93). He sued him\n\nanyway. Based on Abraham’s own admissions, Abraham’s purpose for suing\n\nMichael Quinn Sullivan cannot have been to recover damages from Sullivan, as he\n\npled. (CR1:15).\n\n      Abraham also admitted in his pleadings that he wanted to discover how\n\nMichael Quinn Sullivan had learned about the Levelland meeting. (CR1:15). That\n\ninformation, however, would not make any fact in the case—whether background\n\nor material—more or less likely to be true. This case was filed as a fishing\n\nexpedition unrelated to any concern about Sullivan’s having defamed Abraham, as\n\nAbraham’s own pleadings demonstrate as a matter of law.

(CR2:444; CR2:448 (preserved)) When he\n\nfiled this lawsuit, Abraham had only surmise and suspicion about any relationship\n\nbetween Greer and Sullivan. Sullivan published a non-defamatory article about the\n\nLevelland meeting in one forum two days before Greer published an allegedly\n\ndefamatory article in a different forum. (CR1:14). Sullivan was not present at the\n\nLevelland meeting and Abraham knew it. (CR1:14–15). Sullivan denied under oath\n\nhaving been Greer’s source before this lawsuit was filed, and Greer denied under\n\noath that Sullivan was his source before this lawsuit was filed. (RR1:93–95).\n\nAbraham admitted that he had “no facts” to support his surmise and suspicion.\n\n(RR1:93).

The Supreme Court of Texas\n\nin Casteel explained as follows:\n\n            It is fundamental to our system of justice that parties have the\n            right to be judged by a jury properly instructed in the law. Yet,\n            when a jury based a finding of liability on a single broad-form\n            question that commingles invalid theories of liability with valid\n            theories, the appellate court is often unable to determine the\n            effect of this error. The best the court can do is determine that\n            some evidence could have supported the jury’s conclusion on a\n            legally valid theory. To hold this error harmless would allow a\n            defendant to be held liable without a judicial determination that\n            a factfinder actually found that the defendant should be held\n            liable on proper, legal grounds.\n            Accordingly, we hold that when a trial court submits a single\n            broad-form liability question incorporating multiple theories of\n            liability, the error is harmful and a new trial is required when\n            the appellate court cannot determine whether the jury based its\n            verdict on an improperly submitted invalid theory.\n                                          ...\n            [I]t is impossible for us to conclude that the jury’s answer was\n            not based on one of the improperly submitted theories.\n\n\n                                         32\n\fId. at 388-89.\n\n      The supreme court subsequently expanded Casteel to apply to a broad-form\n\ndamages finding that includes legally insufficient elements.\n\n            A trial court’s error in instructing a jury to consider erroneous\n            matters, whether an invalid liability theory or an unsupported\n            element of damage, prevents the appellant from demonstrating\n            the consequences of the error on appeal.\n                                             ...\n            We hold that Casteel’s reasoning applies equally to broad-form\n            damage questions, and under its rationale we conclude that the\n            charge error in this case was harmful.\n\nHarris Cnty. v.

Casteel and its progeny apply to findings of fact.\n\n      Although Casteel and Harris County arose in the context of jury trials, at\n\nleast four appellate courts in Texas have recognized that their principles also apply\n\nto findings of fact made by a trial court after a bench trial.8 The most notable of\n\nthose cases is Zaidi v.

The same error\n           can arise, with the same resulting harm, when the trial court is\n           the factfinder.\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">434</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 440 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2016, pet. denied); see\n\nHarris Cnty., 96 S.W.3d at 233.\n\n      In Zaidi, the trial court made findings of fact that included a cumulative\n\ndamage award for multiple causes of action. Id. at 438–39. Because many of the\n\nliability findings were legally insufficient, it was impossible for the court of\n\nappeals to know whether the broad-form damage finding was based on a legally\n\ninsufficient claim. Id. at 439, 441, 442–44, 445. The appellants in Zaidi requested\n\nthe trial court to issue additional findings of fact identifying the specific damages\n\nawarded for each claim, but the trial court refused. Id. at 437, 440–41. As a result,\n\nthe court of appeals reversed, based on the Casteel line of cases, and reasoned as\n\nfollows:\n\n           The trial court’s global findings were burdened with more\n           causes of action that the evidence would bear, so we must\n           reverse and remand unless we are ‘reasonably certain that the\n           [factfinder] was not significantly influenced’ by the inclusion of\n           invalid theories of recovery. Because it is impossible determine\n           the extent to which the trial court awarded actual and punitive\n           damages on an invalid basis, we have no such reasonable\n           certainty. We instead conclude that the trial court’s error … ‘is\n\n\n\n                                         34\n\f            harmful because it prevent[ed] proper presentation of the case\n            on appeal.’\n                                                ...\n            As in the Casteel line of cases, we must remand the cause for a\n            new trial.\n\nId. at 444–45.\n\n       This case, like Zaidi, also requires reversal based on Casteel and its progeny\n\nbecause the trial court made two findings of fact (No. 8 and No. 9) that award\n\nattorney’s fees as actual damages under the TCPA, and many of the elements\n\naccompanying each damage finding are legally insufficient.9 (CR2:444–45).\n\n       C.     Finding of Fact 8\n\n       Finding of Fact 8 awards Sullivan attorney’s fees as actual damages “from\n\nthe beginning of this case until remand by the Supreme Court of Texas to this\n\nCourt … in the amount of $35,000.” (CR2:444). This damages finding is “based\n\nupon” the following elements:\n\n     (1)      “the Court’s knowledge of attorney’s fees, including the rates\n              customarily charged in the locality for similar services;”\n\n     (2)      “the evidence presented on the fees customarily charged in the\n              locality for similar services;”\n\n\n9\n  TEX.

Elements 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 broadly reference the trial\n\ncourt’s “knowledge,” “evaluation,” “observation and evaluation,” and, what the\n\ntrial court “believes and finds;” but none of the Elements sets forth what the trial\n\ncourt’s “knowledge,” “evaluation,” “observation and evaluation,” and “belief”\n\nactually is for the respective elements and they are not contained in the post-\n\nremand record.10 (CR2; RR3).\n\n       Additionally, Elements 3, 4, and 5 each reference an “evaluation” that was\n\nmade by the trial court about “what amount of legal services were provided by the\n\nattorneys for the parties” [Element 3]; “what level of attorney services were\n\n\n\n\n10\n   Element 2 references the “evidence” that was “presented on the fees customarily charged in\nthe locality for similar legal services.” That evidence shows that the rates charged by Abraham’s\ncounsel were within $10 dollars an hour of the blended rate charged by Sullivan’s counsel.\n(CR2:453–54) That evidence also shows that the total fees charged by Abraham’s counsel from\nthe inception of the case through the time that the case was remanded to the trial court by the\nSupreme Court of Texas was $131,402.58. (CR2:449) As a result, Element 2 also does not\nsupport the trial court’s finding of $35,000 in fees as actual damages under the TCPA.\n(C2R:445)\n\n\n                                               36\n\freasonable and necessary in this case” [Element 4]; and, “the duplication of legal\n\nservices.” [Element 5]. (CR2:444).\n\n      The plain, ordinary meaning of “evaluation” is to “determine” or “assess.”11\n\nHowever, Elements 3, 4, and 5 do not set forth the trial court’s actual\n\ndetermination or assessment about the matters listed in each element, and, again,\n\nthat determination or assessment is not in the reporter’s record from the post-\n\nremand hearing. (CR2; RR3). As a result, this Court can only speculate about what\n\nthe trial court’s “evaluation” is that is referenced in Elements 3, 4, and 5.\n\n      The same problem exists for Element 6. (CR2:444). It references “the legal\n\nservices which [the trial court] believes and finds were excessive, unreasonable,\n\nand unnecessary.” However, there is no specification in Element 6 about what the\n\ntrial court’s “belief” and “finding” actually is with respect to any legal services that\n\n“were excessive [and] unnecessary.” (CR2:444). That “belief” and “finding” is\n\nalso not included the post-remand record. (CR2; RR3). Once again, this Court\n\nmust guess about the trial court’s “belief” and “finding” that is referenced in\n\nElement 6 and speculate how that “belief” and “finding” might support the broad-\n\nform damages finding of $35,000.\n\n      Accordingly, Elements 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 that accompany the broad-form\n\ndamage finding in Finding of Fact Number 8 are unsupported, generalized\n\n11\n   Webster’s New World Dictionary, Second College Edition at 484; The New Roget’s Thesaurus\nin Dictionary Form at 175.\n\n\n                                            37\n\fconclusions and are legally insufficient.

Interpreting Chapter 38 such that a prevailing party in the trial\n\ncourt cannot obtain appellate attorney’s fees for a successful appeal of a trial\n\ncourt’s error, said the supreme court, would defeat the purpose of the statute.\n\n      The same analysis applies to the TCPA. Like Chapter 38, the TCPA\n\nmandates that it “be construed liberally to effectuate its purpose and intent fully.”\n\nTEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE § 27.011(b).

This suit was filed April9, 2013.\n\n               3.             The underlying statements made by Daniel Greer and Agendawise, which are the subject\n\nof Plaintiff's petition in this case, were completely false, without any factual basis, and were per se\n\ndefamatory to Salem Abraham.\n\n\n\n\nF1NDINOS OF fACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW                                                                                           Page 1\nL:\\1\"1.1111\\IM.

With Salem Abraham's profession being a \"hedge fund\" manager, who is often\n\nthoroughly investigated by prospective. investors or clients, the fake and defamatory statements of\n\nDaniel Greer and Agendawise had the potential to be quite harmful to Salem Abraham and to his\n\nbusiness.\n\n             5.           Salem Abraham brought this legal action out of a sincere and justifiable concern for his\n\nreputation among his clients and investors, and among potential clients and investors.\n\n             6.           This legal action was not brought by Abraham to deter or prevent Sullivan from\n\nel(ercising constitutional rights, nor for any improper pUiposes. Abraham did not bring tbe legal action\n\nto harass, to cause unnecessary delay, or to increase the cost oflitigation. Rather, tbe Court fmds that\n\nAbraham brought this suit for the purposes of (I) exercising his constitutionally-protected right to\n\nprotect his reputation, and (2) to determine how and by whom the utterly false defamatory statements\n\nabout him originated, and were transmitted.\n\n             7.          The Court further finds that the relationship of Michael Quinn Sullivan to AgendaWise\n\nand Daniel Greer, and Michael Quinn Sullivan's prior publication about the Levelland meeting, were\n\nsuch as would lead a reasonable person to suspect that Michael Quinn Sullivan may have been involved\n\nin the transmission of false information regarding Abraham.\n\n             8.           Based upon the Court's knowledge of attorney's fees, including the rates customarily\n\ncharged in the locality for similar legal services, the evidence presented on tbe fees customarily charged\n\nin the locality for similar services, the Court's observation and evaluation of what amount of legal\n\nservices were provided by the attorneys for the parties, and this Court's evaluation of what level of\n\nattorney's services were reasonable and necessary in this case, as well as this Court's evaluation of the\n\nduplication oflegal services, and the legal services which this Court believes and finds were excessive,\n\nunreasonable and unnecessary, the Court finds that reasonable and necessary attorneys' fees for the\n\n\n\nf!NDINOS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW                                                                    Page2\n.1.:111111111\\DATA\\A-.......m.Sallina.illl!i 1.10\\f'~iadiap of Fld and CandJaWm uf~ -~\n\n\n                                                                                                             444\n\fservices of Defendant's attorneys, from the beginning of this case until remand by the Supreme Court\n\nof Texas to this Court, is in the amount of$35,000.00.\n\n             9.

(CR2:439)1\n\n\n1\n  This is an appeal after remand. The Clerk’s Record for this appeal is in two volumes, one\ncontaining items filed prior to the first appeal (“Volume 1”), and the other containing items filed\non remand (“Volume 2”). Volume 1, containing 790 pages, was filed in in the first appeal (No.\n07-13-00396-CV) by the Hemphill County District Clerk on September 25, 2013, and in this\ncause by order of the Court on April 25, 2017. Volume 2 contains 485 pages, and was filed in\nthis cause by the Hemphill County District Clerk on May 25, 2017. For citations to the Clerk’s\nRecord, Appellant uses the familiar citation format (CR[volume]:[page])\n\f                                    SUMMARY\n\n      This is an appeal from an award of attorney’s fees, costs, expenses, and a\n\nsanction—all in favor of Michael Quinn Sullivan and against Salem Abraham.\n\nMichael Quinn Sullivan proved that he incurred $296,805 in attorney’s fees from\n\nthe inception of the case until the supreme court remanded the case to the district\n\ncourt. The district court awarded Sullivan $35,000 in attorney’s fees for work prior\n\nto remand.\n\n      This result is highly unusual. In offering his attorney’s fees as a yardstick by\n\nwhich to measure reasonableness, Salem Abraham admitted that he spent nearly 4\n\ntimes the amount awarded to Sullivan by the district court. Considering the entirety\n\nof the evidence, Abraham offered a basis to challenge only about 10% of the fees\n\nSullivan proved were reasonable and necessary. The district court’s judgment,\n\n(CR2:439–40), represents a 73% downward departure from the lowest attorney’s\n\nfees figure offered by any party in this case.\n\n      Exercising his rights under Texas law, Sullivan timely requested findings of\n\nfact and conclusions of law. (CR2:441) The purpose of findings and conclusions is\n\nso that an appellant can understand the basis for a trial court’s decision and not\n\nhave to guess at the reasons. The district court did not perform its ministerial duty\n\nbecause the district court’s findings and conclusions shed no light on the reasons\n\nfor its decision. They leave Sullivan in the position of having to guess, which\n\n\n\n                                           2\n\feviscerates Sullivan’s rights to the findings and conclusions and defeats the\n\npurpose of the Rules.\n\n      Because Sullivan has a right under Texas law to obtain meaningful findings\n\nof fact and conclusions of law regarding the highly unusual judgment in this case,\n\nTEX. R. CIV. P. 297, Sullivan asks this Court to abate the appeal, refer this case to\n\nthe district court, and direct the district court to enter proper findings of fact and\n\nconclusions of law.2 This request is not made for delay, but only so that justice\n\nmay be done.\n\n                                    ARGUMENT\n\n1.    Background\n\n      This appeal follows an earlier appeal from a judgment signed by the 31st\n\nDistrict Court on August 16, 2013. (CR1:768–69) That judgment was appealed to\n\nthis Court and then to the Supreme Court of Texas. (CR1:772; CR2:4; CR2:16;\n\nCR2:18) This Court held that it was error for the district court to fail to award\n\nsanctions, which are mandatory under the Texas Citizens Participation Act.\n\nSullivan v.

The “findings of fact and conclusions of law” filed by the district court\n      do not satisfy the district court’s ministerial duty to enter proper\n      findings and conclusions.\n\n      The primary purpose for findings of fact and is for a party to ascertain the\n\ntrue basis for the trial court’s decision.

When requested, trial courts must\n\nmake findings and conclusions adequate to provide an appellate court a basis upon\n\nwhich to review the trial court’s application of the law to the facts.

For example,\n\nthe text of the judgment is:\n\n             [A]fter considering the Motion, the pleadings, all of the\n             evidence before the Court, and the argument of counsel,\n             and following the mandate of the Supreme Court of\n             Texas and Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code\n             § 27.009 et seq., hereby finds that . . .

It says merely:\n\n             Based upon the Court’s knowledge of attorney’s fees,\n             including the rates customarily charged in the locality for\n             similar legal services, the evidence presented on the fees\n             customarily charged in the locality for similar services,\n             the Court’s observation and evaluation of what amount of\n             legal services were provided by the attorneys for the\n             parties, and this Court’s evaluation of what level of\n             attorney’s services were reasonable and necessary in this\n             case, as well as this Court’s evaluation of the duplication\n             of legal services, and the legal services which this Court\n             believes and finds were excessive, unreasonable and\n             unnecessary, the Court finds that reasonable and\n             necessary attorney’s fees for the services of Defendant’s\n             attorneys, from the beginning of this case until remand\n             by the Supreme Court of Texas, is in the amount of\n             $35,000.00.\n\n\n\n                                          5\n\f(CR2:444–45 ¶8) The district courts findings are similarly unhelpful regarding\n\npost-remand attorney’s fees. The final judgment says:\n\n             [A]fter considering the Motion, the pleadings, all of the\n             evidence before the Court, and the argument of counsel,\n             and following the mandate of the Supreme Court of\n             Texas and Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code\n             § 27.009 et seq., hereby finds that . . .

It says merely:\n\n             Based upon the Court’s knowledge of fees customarily\n             charged in the locality for similar legal services, the\n             evidence presented on the fees customarily charged in the\n             locality for similar legal services, the evidence presented\n             on the fees customarily charged in the locality for similar\n             services, plus evidence of the reasonable number of hours\n             worked for similar work, and the Court’s evaluation of\n             what level of services was necessary, and what rendered\n             services were unnecessary, the Court finds that\n             reasonable and necessary attorneys’ fees for the services\n             of Defendant’s attorneys, after remand by the Supreme\n             Court, is in the amount of $7,200.00.\n\n(CR2:445 ¶9) When a trial court makes findings that are so incomplete that an\n\nappellant is forced to guess and an appellate court is unable to make a legal\n\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\fdetermination, abatement for adequate findings of fact and conclusions of law is\n\nrequired. Saenz, 411 S.W.3d at 495.\n\n3.    Abatement at this stage is proper and necessary.\n\n      Abatement at this stage of the appeal is the proper vehicle for obtaining the\n\nrequired findings and conclusions. Saenz, 411 S.W.3d at 495; Order of Abatement,\n\nChevron Phillips Chem. Co. LP v. Kingwood Crossroads LP, No. 09-14-00316-CV\n\n(Sep. 18, 2014), attached as Appendix A. If this Court abates the appeal at this\n\nearly stage, the parties will be able to brief the issues of attorney’s fees and\n\nsanctions efficiently and this Court’s ability to review the reasons for the trial\n\ncourt’s judgment will be enhanced, all with little delay and minimal wasted effort.\n\n4.    Abatement for findings of fact will help explain the basis for the highly\n      unusual judgment.\n\n      The unusual nature of the judgment is best highlighted by three\n\nconsiderations. First, the attorney’s fees provisions in the Texas Citizens\n\nParticipation Act are entitled “Damages and Costs.” TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE\n\n§ 27.009. The purpose of this portion of the Texas Citizens Participation Act is to\n\nensure that parties who are targeted by frivolous strategic lawsuits against public\n\nparticipation are made whole. Indeed, for frivolous lawsuits intended to silence\n\npublic participation and speech on issues of public concern, forcing an opponent to\n\nincur such large sums of attorney’s fees is the intended consequence: The rap is the\n\nride, because the substantive claims lack merit.\n\n                                          7\n\f         It is unbecoming to hail a defendant into court by means of false allegations\n\nand then complaint when the defendant hires skillful, experienced and expensive\n\nadvocates to defend against those allegations. Having wrongfully kicked the snow\n\nloose at the top, Salem Abraham must bear the consequences of the avalanche at\n\nthe bottom. Schwartz v. Folloder, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"454817\"><a href=\"/opinion/454817/charles-n-schwarz-jr-v-harry-folloder-alexander-grant-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">767</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">125</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 133–34 (5th Cir. 1985).\n\n         Fee awards in similar cases have been very close to the amount of fees\n\nSullivan seeks. For example, a Tarrant County district court awarded Rauhauser\n\n$300,383.94 plus a $150,000.00 sanction. McGibney v. Retzlaff, No. 67-270669-\n\n14, in the 67th District Court, Tarrant County, Texas (Apr. 14, 2016).\n\n         Second, the lowest amount of attorney’s fees incurred by either party\n\nexceeds $130,000. The district court here, without explanation or argument,\n\nawarded barely more than 25% of that amount. The district court’s fee award to\n\nSullivan represents a mere 12% of his attorneys fees. Nor are Sullivan’s fees in any\n\nway unusual or unexpected. Rauhauser’s fees in a similar case amounted to\n\napproximately $300,000 too. Id.\n\n         Finally, the discrepancy in the hours spent by the respective sides’ attorneys\n\nare, apples-to-apples, quite similar. The table below, based on evidence that was\n\nbefore the district court when it ruled, summarizes an apples-to-apples comparison\n\nof the time spent on this case by the respective sides.3\n\n\n3\n    (CR2:36–60; CR2:82–83; CR2:406–07)\n\n\n                                            8\n\fPhase                             Plaintiff Abraham            Defendant Sullivan\n\nDistrict Court                       177.2 hours                   140.9 hours\n\nSeventh Court of Appeals            127.85 hours                   131.2 hours\n\nSupreme Court of Texas               246.2 hours                  250.72 hours\n\nTotal, apples-to-apples             551.25 hours                  523.82 hours\n\n\n        The only hours excluded from this apples-to-apples comparison are the\n\nhours incurred by Sullivan’s counsel in preparing the reply brief in this court, the\n\nreply in support of Sullivan’s petition for review in the supreme court, and\n\nSullivan’s reply brief on the merits in the supreme court. In total, Sullivan’s\n\ncounsel spent 184.8 hours on these three briefs. (CR2:36–60) As shown to the\n\ndistrict court (CR2:406–07) and summarized above, the discrepancy in the\n\nnumbers of hours spent on this case by the respective parties’ counsel is entirely\n\nattributable to the procedural posture of this case. Sullivan was the appellant in this\n\ncourt and the petitioner in the supreme court. Appellants reasonably and routinely\n\nfile reply briefs, and Petitioners in the supreme court reasonably and routinely file\n\nboth a Reply in Support of their Petition for Review as well as a Reply Brief on the\n\nMerits. Salem Abraham himself has followed this practice. Reply Brief of Salem\n\nAbraham, Abraham v. Greer, No. 07-12-00494-CV (Apr. 5, 2013).\n\n\n\n\n                                          9\n\f      These three considerations, separately and together, suggest that the district\n\ncourt’s judgment is highly unusual in light of the applicable law and the facts\n\nbefore that court when it ruled.\n\n5.    Abatement for findings of fact will permit the district court to analyze\n      Texas law and identify how the court applied the facts to the law.\n\n      Pursuant to TEX. R. CIV. P. 296, Michael Quinn Sullivan filed a request for\n\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law on March 7, 2017. (CR2:441) When\n\nrequested, Findings of Fact and Conclusions of law are required by Texas law in\n\ncases, like this one, where the trial court decides attorneys’ fees without a jury.\n\nHeafner & Assocs. v.

Therefore, the trial\n\ncourt was required to file adequate findings of fact and conclusions of law\n\nexplaining the true basis for its decision on or before March 27, 2017, twenty days\n\nafter Sullivan’s timely request. TEX. R. CIV. P. 297.\n\n      The district court was required to award Sullivan reasonable attorney’s\n\nfees—that is, a fee that is not excessive or extreme, but moderate or fair. Sullivan\n\nv. Abraham, 488 S.W.3d at 299. The district court was therefore required to\n\nexplain the basis of its attorney’s fee award in light of the time and labor involved,\n\nthe novelty and difficulty involved, the skill required to perform the legal services\n\n                                          10\n\fproperly, the exclusion from other employment by the attorneys because they\n\naccepted this case, the customary fee, time limitations, the experience and\n\nreputation of the counsel, awards in similar cases, the amount in controversy, the\n\nnature and length of the relationship between attorney and counsel, and the results\n\nobtained.

The only way for the respective parties\n\nto know what work the district court may have considered unnecessary,\n\nunreasonable, or duplicative, it was the district court’s ministerial duty to specify\n\nwhat work the court considered unnecessary or duplicative.\n\n      Sullivan provided to the district court every single time entry for every\n\nsingle timekeeper from the beginning of this case. But nowhere in the district\n\ncourt’s findings and conclusions did it identify a single duplicative time entry.\n\nNowhere in the district court’s findings and conclusions did it specify what\n\nservices were excessive, unreasonable, or unnecessary. For that matter, Abraham’s\n\nown evidence and argument never identified a single time entry wherein the\n\nservices offered were duplicative, unreasonable, or unnecessary.\n\n\n\n                                         11\n\f       Nowhere in the district court’s “findings and conclusions” did it identify\n\nwhat a reasonable hourly rate is for legal services of the kind provided in this case.\n\nNowhere in the district court’s “findings and conclusions” did that court identify\n\nthe number of hours that would have been reasonable to expend in defense of a\n\nFirst Amendment case seeking millions of dollars in damages, achieve success in\n\npart on appeal to an intermediate court, and then achieve success on the remaining\n\nlegal issues in the court of last resort in Texas.4\n\n                            CONCLUSION AND PRAYER\n\n       Under Texas law, appellants cannot be forced to guess at the reasons\n\nmotivating a trial court’s judgment. However, that is precisely the scenario created\n\nby the findings and conclusions entered in this case. They shed no light on why the\n\ntrial court entered judgment by departing downward 73% from the lowest figure\n\noffered by any party for pre-remand attorney’s fees. In fact, the trial court’s\n\nfindings and conclusions recite the judgment nearly verbatim.\n\n       The controlling issue is whether, under the circumstances of the case, the\n\nappellant is required to guess at the reasons for the trial court’s decision.

McGibney, 2014 Tex. App. LEXIS 13290 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth\n2014, no pet.) (remanding this case for award of attorney's fees and sanctions), defendant Neal Rauhauser's motion\nto award attorney's fees and sanctions pursuant to TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE § 27.001, et seq., Rauhauser's\n“Notice of Plaintiffs' New Criminal Aggravating Misconduct and Request for Nonmonetary Sanctions,” the original\nand supplemental affidavits for attorney's fees of Rauhauser attorney Jeffrey L. Dorrell and fee statements appended\nthereto, the “liberal construction” directive to Texas courts in TEX. Civ. PRAC. & REM. CODE § 27.011(b), plaintiffs'\nresponse to Rauhauser's motion, the pleadings, and other affidavits and evidence on file, the Court finds:\n(i) Plaintiffs' brought this suit against Rauhauser willfully and maliciously to injure Rauhauser by deterring Rauhauser\nfrom exercising his constitutional rights—specifically, to truthfully criticize plaintiffs;\n\n(ii) Plaintiffs brought this suit against Rauhauser with objective substantial certainty that the suit would inflict litigation\ncosts on Rauhauser;\n\n(iii) Plaintiffs filed multiple lawsuits in two states at substantially the same time making substantially the same allegations;\n\n(iv) Plaintiffs brought their suits against Rauhauser in conscious disregard of plaintiffs' duties or of Rauhauser's rights\nand without just cause or excuse;\n\n(v) Plaintiffs' filing of multiple SLAPP suits in two states at substantially the same time making substantially the same\nallegations manifests plaintiffs' intent to continue using baseless suits to retaliate against, punish, and deter plaintiffs'\nenemies, and necessitates a significant deterrent sanction;\n\n(vi) Plaintiffs engaged in aggravating misconduct by willfully and intentionally harassing—and using confederates to\nwillfully and intentionally harass—both Rauhauser and Rauhauser's attorney, the objective of which was to punish the\nexercise of Rauhauser's constitutional rights in the past, deter the exercise of Rauhausr's constitutional rights in the\nfuture, and impair Rauhauser's ability to retain legal counsel in defense of plaintiffs' baseless claims; and\n\n(vii) Plaintiffs' aggressive filing of multiple lawsuits and aggravating misconduct caused Rauhauser to incur $300,383.84\nin attorney's fees to defend through trial and appeal.\n\n\n\nAs to Rauhauser's requested attorney's fees, the Court finds that affidavit evidence of Rauhauser's attorney's fees\nsubmitted complies with TEX.

Perry Equip.\nCorp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2427543\"><a href=\"/opinion/2427543/arthur-andersen-v-perry-equipment-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">945</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">812</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 818 (Tex. 1997). As a result, the Court makes the following specific findings as to each:\n\n\n                                              (i) The time and labor required.\n\n *2 The time spent by each attorney or staff member rendering services to Rauhauser on each specific task was\ncontemporaneously logged and quantified to the nearest one-tenth of an hour, and totaled over 600 hours as of September\n6, 2015, for trial, appeal, and remand.\n\n\n                                  (ii) The novelty and difficulty of the questions involved.\n\nThe TCPA is a relatively new statute enacted on June 17, 2011. Many issues have arisen in Texas appellate courts\nregarding interpretation and application of its provisions. These include the constitutionality of the TCPA itself, whether\na plaintiff's nonsuit can defeat application of the TCPA, whether the TCPA's provision for awarding attorney's fees is\nmandatory, whether the TCPA's provision for awarding sanctions “sufficient to deter the filing of similar actions” is\nmandatory, whether review of a trial court's failure to rule on the motion is by interlocutory appeal or petition for writ\nof mandamus, whether the TCPA applies to “non-public” speech, and what constitutes a “matter of public concern,”\nand whether an appellate court can reverse and render judgment on attorney's fees and sanctions or must remand to the\ntrial court for further proceedings. Several of these were presented in the case at bar, including, without limitation:\n\n(A) Plaintiffs argued both in this Court and on appeal that they were immunized from the TCPA's remedies because\nRauhauser chose to appear and defend their defamation SLAPP suit without ever having been served. This was an\nissue on which no appellate court had spoken in the context of the TCPA at the time plaintiffs raised it. The issue\nrequired extensive research and briefing in order for Rauhauser to prevail over plaintiffs' argument in the court of appeals.\nRauhauser v. McGibney is now extensively cited in law review articles and practice manuals on this point.\n\n(B) Plaintiffs argued both in this Court and on appeal that they were immunized from the TCPA's remedies because\nplaintiffs nonsuited their claims approximately 5 hours after Rauhauser filed his TCPA motion to dismiss. This was\nalso an issue on which no appellate court had spoken in the context of the TCPA at the time plaintiffs raised it. The\nissue required extensive research and briefing in order for Rauhauser to prevail over plaintiffs' argument in the court of\nappeals. Rauhauser v. McGibney is now extensively cited in law review articles and practice manuals on this point, too.\n\n(C) It was necessary for Rauhauser to show that plaintiff McGibney was a “public figure” in order for the TCPA to apply\nto the defamation claims made in the case at bar. This issue required extensive research into James McGibney's personal\nbackground, prior statements, and litigation. This research ultimately resulted in discovery of extensive evidence of\nMcGibney's many media appearances, and even the affidavit of a McGibney expert filed in a Nevada lawsuit admitting\nthat McGibney was a public figure.\n\nAs a result, the novelty and difficult of the questions presented in the case at bar justifies both the more-than-600 hours\nexpended in trial, appeal, and on remand, and the hourly rates charged.\n\n\n                                  (iii) The skill requisite to perform the service properly.\n\nThe area of free speech, defamation claims, and the TCPA is highly specialized and complex. After the U.S. Supreme\nCourt began to “constitutionalize” the tort of defamation with New York Times v. Sullivan in 1964, the elements to be\n\n\n               © 2017 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                        2\n\fMcGibney v. Retzlaff, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2016</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1703694</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2016)\n\n\nproved and which party has the burden of proof took on a complexity not seen in any other tort practice. The enactment\nof the TCPA in 2011 added a new layer of complexity, magnified by the fact that new appellate opinions changing\nor clarifying the interpretation of the statute are released on an almost weekly basis. These are not topics or issues\non which “canned” briefing is available or on which the law is well-settled. Each issue requires independent research\nand meticulous briefing. This practice area requires an extremely high degree of skill to perform services properly. The\nattorneys performing services for Rauhauser possessed the high degree of skill required.\n\n\n                              (iv) The likelihood, if apparent to the client, that acceptance of\n                             the representation will preclude other employment by the lawyer.\n\n *3 The over-600 hours of time expended by attorneys and staff of Hanszen Laporte over the 20 months in which\nthat firm represented Rauhauser— through trial, then through an appeal (including oral argument), and on remand for\nattorney's fees and sanctions—precluded employment on other cases. Most of this time was been expended by attorney\nJeffrey L. Dorrell, and represents approximately 25% of all time expended by that attorney on all legal matters during\nthe relevant time period. Hanszen Laporte has 11 attorneys and a steady supply of paying clients on whose cases or\nmatters Dorrell could have worked if he had not chosen to render services to Rauhauser. This is proven by the fact that\nHanszen Laporte's revenues have grown by 178% during the three years immediately preceding the date of this affidavit,\nranking it 50 th out of all companies in Houston in revenue growth (the “Houston Fast 100”) and 28 th out of all Houston\ncompanies owned or managed by graduates of the University of Houston (the “Cougar 100”).\n\n\n                         (v) The fee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal services.\n\nIn cases of defamation, First Amendment, and TCPA motions, there is no “locality” in the sense that attorneys in one\n“locality” might charge a higher price or hourly rate to draft a will for a client than attorneys in another “locality.” The\npractice is so complex and specialized that only a small number of Texas attorneys are qualified to perform services for\nclients. Those highly-qualified attorneys travel to where a case is pending. Here, the “locality” is more accurately seen\nas the entire state of Texas. The hourly rate of $550.00 is comparable to that of the small number of similarly-qualified\nattorneys in this field practicing in Texas.\n\n\n                                    (vi) The amount involved and the results obtained.\n\nPlaintiffs sued Rauhauser for $1,000,000.00 in federal and state courts of two different states, including the case at bar.\nThe Court takes judicial notice that, as a direct result of the efforts and highly competent representation of Hanszen\nLaporte, all claims against Rauhauser in all suits were ultimately disposed in his favor. Considerations of the amount in\ncontroversy and results obtained weigh heavily in favor of the Court's finding that the fee charged to Rauhauser in the\ncase at bar was reasonable and that justice and equity require it to be awarded to Rauhauser.\n\n\n                           (vii) Time limitations imposed by the client or by the circumstances.\n\nThe “circumstances” of the TCPA impose several accelerated deadlines, both in the trial and appellate phases of litigation\npractice. These inflexible deadlines must be recognized and complied with, and take priority over more common deadlines\nin normal litigation. These deadlines thus require special efforts that necessarily increase the amount of attorney's\nfees that can be said to be “reasonable.” Other circumstances include plaintiffs' aggressive abuse and harassment of\nRauhauser's defense attorney—designed to deprive Rauhauser of the benefit of legal representation.\n\n\n                        (viii) The nature and length of the professional relationship with the client.\n\n\n\n               © 2017 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                       3\n\fMcGibney v. Retzlaff, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2016</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1703694</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2016)\n\n\nNeither attorney Jeffrey L. Dorrell nor any member of Hanszen Laporte, LLP, or its staff has any prior professional\nrelationship with defendant Neal Rauhauser. After 19 months of representation, attorney Dorrell has never met\nRauhauser, who does not reside in Texas. After plaintiffs sued Rauhauser, Rauhauser's online research of Dorrell's\npast SLAPP-suit appellate victories led him to request Dorrell's representation. The representation was an arm's-length\ntransaction, with no attendant considerations to call into question the reasonableness of the hourly rates charged or the\nnumber of hours expended. This was not “pro bono” representation of a past or existing client as a courtesy for past\nbusiness.\n\n\n               (ix) The experience, reputation, and ability of the lawyer or lawyers performing the services.\n\nThe experience, reputations, and abilities of the lawyers performing the services for Rauhauser were of the highest caliber\nand were readily apparent to the Court at all phases of the litigation.\n\n\n                              (x) Whether the fee is fixed or contingent on results obtained or\n                             uncertainty of collection before legal services have been rendered.\n\n *4 The fee negotiated in the engagement letter signed by Neal Rauhauser called for payment of an initial retainer of\n$1,500.00, which Rauhauser paid, and for future billings at a rate of $550.00 per hour for Dorrell's services. Hanszen\nLaporte, LLP, sent Rauhauser regular monthly bills showing services provided and amounts incurrerd. Rauhauser is\ncontractually liable to pay these amounts. The firm of Hanszen Laporte advanced expenses on Rauhauser's behalf\nand carried a receivable of over $300,000.00 with a significant risk that no payment would ever be collected. This was\nanticipated at the time the representation was commenced (although not to the extent it ultimately reached), and the\nfirm's usual hourly rates for noncontingent fee cases were adjusted upward by approximately 50% to reflect this risk.\nThese facts, too, weigh heavily in favor of the Court's finding that the fee charged in the case at bar was reasonable, and\nthat the interests of justice and equity require that it be awarded to Rauhauser from plaintiffs in full measure.\n\nTherefore, the Court GRANTS Rauhauser's motion and orders that plaintiffs James McGibney and ViaView, Inc., shall,\njointly and severally, pay to defendant Neal Rauhauser the following amounts:\n(i) Total reasonable attorney's fees, litigation expenses, and court costs for the trial and first appeal of $300,383.84, as\njustice and equity require;\n\n(ii) Sanctions sufficient to deter the filing of similar actions by plaintiffs in the future of $150,000.00.\n\n(iii) Conditional appellate attorney's fees of $50,000.00 for a second appeal to the court of appeals, which such appeal\ndoes not result in a complete reversal of all amounts awarded; and\n\n(iv) Conditional appellate attorney's fees of $25,000.00 if a petition for review is filed in the Texas Supreme Court, which\nsuch petition does not result in a complete reversal of all amounts awarded.\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs shall pay the foregoing amounts, except for the conditional awards of appellate attorney's fees, to Neal\nRauhauser not later than 30 days after the date this order is signed.\n\nFurthermore, in view of plaintiffs' history of filing numerous lawsuits with the willful, malicious intent to injure those\nwho have spoken critically of plaintiffs, the Court finds that monetary sanctions alone will not be sufficient to deter\nplaintiffs from filing similar such suits in the future. Therefore, in addition to the monetary sanctions awarded above,\nthe Court orders the following nonmonetary sanctions:\n\n\n\n\n               © 2017 Thomson Reuters.
