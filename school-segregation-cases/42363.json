We affirm.\n\n              I.   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n     Plaintiff-appellant Jason W. (represented in this action by\n\nhis next friends and parents, to whom we refer collectively as\n\nJason) is a special education student in the Houston Independent\n\nSchool District (the District).   He has been diagnosed with\n\fattention deficit disorder and a speech impairment that cause him\n\nsignificant academic and social difficulty.   Since early 1994,\n\nJason has qualified for special education services, and the\n\nDistrict has created individualized education plans for him.\n\nThese entail, inter alia, providing resource instruction and\n\nconsultation, modifying the regular education program to meet\n\nJason’s needs, and developing behavior management plans designed\n\nto control his disruptive behavior.   During the 1994-95 school\n\nyear, Jason’s parents became dissatisfied with Jason’s special\n\neducation program and requested a hearing under the Individuals\n\nwith Disabilities in Education Act (IDEA), 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400-\n\n1491, which conditions federal aid to state special education\n\nprograms on a state’s assurance to all children with disabilities\n\n“an opportunity to present complaints with respect to any matter\n\nrelating to the identification, evaluation, or educational\n\nplacement of the child, or the provision of a free appropriate\n\neducation to such child.”   20 U.S.C. § 1415(b)(1)(E).1   Jason\n\nrejected the District’s official settlement offer, and a hearing\n\nwas held on May 25 and June 12-16, 1995 before James Holtz, an\n\nattorney appointed as a hearing officer by the state of Texas.\n\nOn July 22, 1995, Holtz filed a written decision finding that\n\n(1) Jason’s parents were entitled to reimbursement for the fees\n\nof two psychologists whom they had retained to help the District\n\ndevelop a behavior management plan for Jason, (2) that the\n\n     1\n        This opinion cites to the version of the IDEA in effect\nat the time of the events in this case. The IDEA was completely\nrevised in 1997 by Pub. L. No. 105-17, 111 Stat. 37.\n\n                                 2\n\fbehavior management plan ultimately adopted by the District was\n\nnot appropriate, and (3) that Jason’s placement in a resource\n\nclass from January 10, 1995 to February 2, 1995 was not\n\nappropriate and denied him a free appropriate public education\n\n(FAPE).\n\n     On July 26, 1995, Daniel McCall, Jason’s attorney, wrote to\n\nJennifer Jacobs, the District’s attorney, demanding $32,943.97, a\n\nsum representing the total amount of attorneys’ fees and costs.\n\nAfter McCall rejected two settlement offers of $7500.00 and\n\n$10,000.00, Jason filed an action in the federal district court\n\nfor the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, seeking\n\nrecovery of all attorneys’ fees and costs incurred in the special\n\neducation hearing and in federal court under the IDEA, 20 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1415(e)(4)(B).    On April 26, 1996, the District made an\n\nofficial offer of judgment under Federal Rule of Procedure Rule\n\n68 in the amount of $24,429.00, which Jason failed to accept.\n\nAfter a bench trial, the district court found that nineteen\n\nspecific issues had been presented to the hearing officer and\n\nthat Jason had prevailed on only three.    The court also found\n\nthat the hearing afforded Jason some specific relief that he\n\nwould not have received had he accepted the District’s settlement\n\noffer.    The court ruled that Jason was a prevailing party, but\n\nawarded him only a fraction of the attorneys’ fees he demanded.\n\nBecause it found that at least half of the time and effort\n\nexpended in the hearing had been devoted to three issues relating\n\nto a new school placement for Jason--issues on which Jason did\n\n\n                                  3\n\fnot prevail--the district court first reduced the hours his\n\nattorney claimed to have spent by half.       Of the remaining sixteen\n\nissues, the court found that Jason prevailed on only three and\n\nthat even success on these three afforded Jason little relief\n\nbeyond what the District had offered prior to the hearing.       Based\n\non these factors, the court again reduced the number of hours by\n\nhalf.   In addition, the district court ruled, based on its\n\nfinding that Jason was entitled only to total fees, costs, and\n\nexpenses in the amount of $8340.49 on the date of the District’s\n\n$10,000.00 settlement offer, that Jason had unreasonably\n\nprotracted the controversy by refusing to settle.       It declined to\n\naward Jason any fees or costs beyond $8340.49.       Jason thus did\n\nnot receive fees or costs for the federal lawsuit.\n\n     The District filed a motion to amend final judgment,\n\ncontending that under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68, it was\n\nentitled to its costs after April 26, 1996.       The District argued\n\nthat because it had made an offer of judgment on April 26, 1996\n\nin the amount of $24,429.00, which was more than the $8340.49\n\nthat Jason ultimately obtained at trial, it was entitled to all\n\ncosts after that date.   The district court granted the motion and\n\nawarded the District $2322.05.    Jason filed a motion for new\n\ntrial, which the district court denied.       Jason appeals.\n\n                          II.    DISCUSSION\n\n     Jason argues that the district court erred in awarding\n\nattorneys’ fees in a reduced amount and in granting costs to the\n\nDistrict.   We address each of these issues in turn.\n\n\n                                   4\n\fA.   Standard of Review\n\n     We review an award of attorneys’ fees for abuse of\n\ndiscretion and the factual findings upon which the award is based\n\nfor clear error.   See Brady v. Fort Bend County, 145 F.3d 691,\n\n716 (5th Cir. 1998); Migis v. Pearle Vision, Inc., 135 F.3d 1041,\n\n1047 (5th Cir. 1998) (citing Louisiana Power & Light Co. v.\n\nKellstrom, 50 F.3d 319, 324, 329 (5th Cir. 1995)).     Although we\n\ngenerally review a district court’s award of costs for abuse of\n\ndiscretion, see Alberti v. Klevenhagen, 46 F.3d 1347, 1358 (5th\n\nCir. 1995), interpretation of Rule 68 is an issue of law that we\n\nreview de novo, see Louisiana Power & Light Co., 50 F.3d at 333.\n\nB.   Attorneys’ Fees\n\n     In any action or proceeding brought under the IDEA, the\n\ncourt “may award reasonable attorneys’ fees as part of the costs\n\nto the parents or guardian of a child or youth with a disability\n\nwho is the prevailing party.”   20 U.S.C. § 1415(e)(4)(B).    The\n\nlegislative history of the IDEA indicates that this attorneys’\n\nfees provision should be interpreted in accordance with Hensley\n\nv. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424 (1983), a federal civil rights\n\ndecision.2   See H.R. REP. NO. 105-95, at 105-06.   Therefore, we\n\napply the principles outlined in Hensley and its progeny to this\n\n\n     2\n        Technically, this statement refers to the attorneys’ fees\nprovision in the post-1997 version of the IDEA, but Congress\nreenacted the identical language of 20 U.S.C. § 1415(e)(4)(B) as\n20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(3)(B) when it revised the IDEA in 1997.\nBecause the amendment did not change the language of the\nattorneys’ fees provision, we believe that Congress also intended\n20 U.S.C. § 1415(e)(4)(B) to be interpreted consistent with\nHensley v. Eckerhart.\n\n                                 5\n\fcase.\n\n     The calculation of attorneys’ fees involves a well-\n\nestablished process.   First, the court calculates a “lodestar”\n\nfee by multiplying the reasonable number of hours expended on the\n\ncase by the reasonable hourly rates for the participating\n\nlawyers.   See Louisiana Power & Light Co., 50 F.3d at 324.    The\n\ncourt then considers whether the lodestar figure should be\n\nadjusted; in making such an adjustment, the court looks to the\n\ntwelve factors established in Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express,\n\nInc., 488 F.2d 714, 717-19 (5th Cir. 1974): (1) the time and\n\nlabor required for the litigation; (2) the novelty and difficulty\n\nof the questions presented; (3) the skill required to perform the\n\nlegal services properly; (4) the preclusion of other employment\n\nby the attorney due to acceptance of the case; (5) the customary\n\nfee; (6) whether the fee is fixed or contingent; (7) time\n\nlimitations imposed by the client or the circumstances; (8) the\n\namount involved and the result obtained; (9) the experience,\n\nreputation, and ability of the attorneys; (10) the\n\n“undesirability” of the case; (11) the nature and length of the\n\nprofessional relationship with the client; and (12) awards in\n\nsimilar cases.   See Louisiana Power & Light Co., 50 F.3d at 329.\n\nMany of these factors usually are subsumed within the initial\n\ncalculation of hours reasonably expended at a reasonable hourly\n\nrate, see Hensley, 461 U.S. at 434 n.9, and should not be double-\n\ncounted, see Shipes v. Trinity Indus., 987 F.2d 311, 320 (5th\n\nCir. 1993).   Moreover, some Johnson factors deserve more weight\n\n\n                                 6\n\fthan others.   The Supreme Court held that “the most critical\n\nfactor” in determining the reasonableness of a fee award “is the\n\ndegree of success obtained.”    Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S. 103, 114\n\n(1992) (quoting Hensley, 461 U.S. at 436); see also Von Clark v.\n\nButler, 916 F.2d 255, 258 (5th Cir. 1990).   This factor is\n\nparticularly crucial when, as in this case, a plaintiff is deemed\n\n“prevailing” even though he succeeded on only some of his claims.\n\nSee Hensley, 436 U.S. at 434.\n\n     Both parties agree that Jason is a prevailing party.\n\nHensley noted that a “typical” definition of “prevailing party”\n\nfor attorneys’ fees purposes is a party who “succeed[s] on any\n\nsignificant issue in litigation which achieves some of the\n\nbenefit the parties sought in bringing suit.”   461 U.S. at 433\n\n(quoting Nadeau v. Helgemoe, 581 F.2d 275, 278-79 (1st Cir.\n\n1978)).   This circuit has specifically held that in IDEA cases, a\n\nprevailing party is one that attains a remedy that both (1)\n\nalters the legal relationship between the school district and the\n\nhandicapped child and (2) fosters the purposes of the IDEA.      See\n\nAngela L. v. Pasadena Indep. Sch. Dist., 918 F.2d 1188, 1193-94\n\n(5th Cir. 1990).3   The hearing altered the legal relationship\n\nbetween Jason and the District, which was ordered to reimburse\n\nhis parents for the fees of both psychologists, adjust his\n\n     3\n        This circuit adopted a narrower definition of “prevailing\nparty” in the context of § 1988 attorneys’ fees cases, holding\nthat prevailing parties must succeed on the central issue of\ntheir suit and obtain the primary relief sought, see Texas State\nTeachers Ass’n v. Garland Indep. Sch. Dist., 837 F.2d 190, 192\n(5th Cir. 1988), but we need not consider that definition because\nthe Angela L. standard explicitly applies to IDEA cases.\n\n                                 7\n\fbehavior modification plan to include positive reinforcement, and\n\ntrain his teachers to implement the behavior modification plan\n\nproperly.   Furthermore, the remedy that Jason obtained fosters\n\nthe purposes of the IDEA by providing him with a free and\n\nappropriate public education.\n\n     A finding that a party   is a prevailing party only makes him\n\neligible to receive attorneys’ fees under the IDEA; it does not\n\nautomatically entitle him to recover the full amount that he\n\nspent on legal representation.     See 20 U.S.C. § 1415(e)(4)(B)\n\n(“In any action or proceeding brought under this subsection, the\n\ncourt, in its discretion, may award reasonable attorneys’\n\nfees . . . .”) (emphasis added).       Jason contends that all the\n\nJohnson factors support his application for the full amount of\n\nattorneys’ fees.   The district court, however, reduced the fees\n\nbased only on its finding that the action did not involve novel\n\nor difficult questions of fact or law and that Jason achieved\n\nlimited success at the hearing.    Because we find that the\n\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in reducing the\n\nattorneys’ fees from $32,943.97 to $8340.49 on the grounds of\n\nthese two factors, we find it unnecessary to examine the others.\n\n     First, Jason offers only bald assertions in support of his\n\ncontention that his case involved novel and difficult questions.\n\nHe states that the District is the largest public school district\n\nin the state of Texas, that the hearing was requested by the\n\nparents to contest all of the District’s decisions concerning\n\nJason’s education, and that five special education experts\n\n\n                                   8\n\ftestified at the hearing.   The size of the District or the\n\nhearing does not show that the suit involved novel or difficult\n\nlegal and factual issues, however, and Jason’s claim that the\n\nparents filed an appeal of all of the District’s decisions on\n\nJason’s education is simply inaccurate, as Holtz testified at\n\ntrial that he explicitly limited the issues to those arising out\n\nof the 1994-95 school year.   We cannot say that the district\n\ncourt committed clear error in finding that Jason’s case did not\n\ninvolve novel and difficult issues.\n\n     Second, attorneys’ fees must reflect the degree of success\n\nobtained.   The District contends that the parties presented\n\nnineteen issues to Holtz, of which Jason prevailed on three;\n\ntherefore, it contends that Jason achieved only limited success\n\nat the hearing, and his attorneys’ fees should be reduced\n\naccordingly.   Jason asserts that (1) the nineteen issues the\n\ndistrict court identified were not all presented at the hearing;\n\n(2) the question of whether Jason was receiving a FAPE, on which\n\nJason prevailed, was the primary and subsuming issue at the\n\nhearing; and (3) the issues in this suit were so interrelated\n\nthat it is impossible to allocate time among the individual\n\nissues.\n\n     We find that the district court did not commit clear error\n\nin determining that there were nineteen issues, of which Jason\n\nprevailed only on three, and did not abuse its discretion in\n\nawarding attorneys’ fees accordingly.   There is ample evidence in\n\nthe record to support the district court’s findings that Jason\n\n\n                                 9\n\fachieved limited success.     James Holtz, the hearing officer at\n\nJason’s due process hearing, testified that nineteen issues were\n\npresented to him in Jason’s case and that Jason did not prevail\n\non all those issues.   Holtz’s testimony confirmed that of Nona\n\nMatthews, the District’s expert witness, who analyzed transcripts\n\nof the hearing and concluded that nineteen issues were presented.\n\n     Moreover, both Holtz and Matthews testified at trial that\n\nJason’s primary objective was to secure placement at another\n\nschool.   Holtz also testified, and the district court found, that\n\nmore than half of the time and testimony at the hearing involved\n\nthe issue of whether Jason would be placed in another school.\n\nHoltz further testified that although another major issue was\n\nwhether the District had provided Jason with a free appropriate\n\npublic education during the 1994-95 school year, this issue did\n\nnot subsume all others, and Jason was not entirely successful on\n\nhis claim that he had been denied a FAPE:\n\n     Holtz:     The major issue--\n\n     McCall:    Yes.\n\n     Holtz:     --before me involved I guess the alternate\n                determination, whether or not there was a Free\n                Appropriate Public Education being provided to the\n                student during that school year. But this did not\n                include all of the issues that were raised by the\n                parties.\n\n     McCall:    And did the petitioner prevail on the major issue\n                of whether there was denial of F.A.P.E.?\n\n     Holtz:     Partially.4\n\n     4\n        Jason argues that the district court erred in striking\nseveral post-trial exhibits, one of which was an affidavit from\nJames Holtz in support of Jason’s application for attorneys’\n\n                                     10\n\fFurthermore, the language of the IDEA itself demonstrates that\n\nnot all of the nineteen issues that Holtz identified can be\n\nsubsumed under the general heading of denial of a FAPE.    The IDEA\n\nguarantees “an opportunity to present complaints with respect to\n\nany matter relating to the identification, evaluation, or\n\neducational placement of the child, or the provision of a free\n\nappropriate public education to such child.”   20 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1415(b)(1)(E) (emphasis added).    The IDEA thus treats placement\n\nand denial of a FAPE as separate issues; moreover, it implies\n\nthat identification and evaluation of the child also should be\n\nconsidered distinct issues.   Even assuming that the remaining\n\nissues do fall under the FAPE umbrella, it is undisputed that\n\nJason prevailed only on three of those issues; thus, as Holtz\n\ntestified, he was only partially successful on the issue of\n\nwhether he was denied a FAPE.\n\n     Jason also contends that the nature of a special education\n\ncase is such that the issues are so interrelated that it is\n\nimpossible to determine how much time was spent on each issue.\n\n\nfees. Although Jason includes this question in his statement of\nthe issues, he provides no argument or authority in support of\nhis position. We have held that failure to provide any legal or\nfactual analysis of an issue on appeal waives that issue. See\nCavallini v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., 44 F.3d 256, 260 n.9\n(5th Cir. 1995); see also Fed. R. App. P. 28(a)(6)(“The argument\nmust contain the contentions of the appellant on the issues\npresented, and the reasons therefor, with citations to the\nauthorities, statutes, and parts of the record relied on.”); Gann\nv. Fruehauf Corp., 52 F.3d 1320, 1328 (5th Cir. 1995) (holding\nthat appellant waived claims on appeal by failing to advance\narguments in support of them in the body of his brief). The\ndistrict court struck these exhibits, Jason provides no argument\nas to why we should find that it erred in doing so, and we\ntherefore decline to address them.\n\n                                11\n\fThis argument lacks merit; indeed, we have rejected a similar\n\nclaim in an analogous case.     See Migis v. Pearle Vision, Inc.,\n\n135 F.3d 1041, 1048 (5th Cir. 1998).       In Migis, the plaintiff\n\nalleged four acts of discrimination on the basis of sex or\n\npregnancy.   She prevailed only on one, and only on the basis of\n\npregnancy discrimination.     See id.    The district court reduced\n\nthe amount of attorneys’ fees.     See id. at 1047.    On appeal,\n\nMigis argued that her case could not be segregated into discrete\n\nclaims because all of her contentions involved a common core of\n\nfacts and because she only prosecuted a single, discrete claim of\n\npregnancy discrimination.     See id. at 1048.    We rejected this\n\nargument, holding that even where “a plaintiff has achieved only\n\npartial or limited success, the product of hours reasonably\n\nexpended on the litigation as a whole times a reasonable hourly\n\nrate may be an excessive amount.       This will be true even where\n\nthe plaintiff’s claims were interrelated, nonfrivolous, and\n\nraised in good faith.”   Id. (quoting Hensley, 461 U.S. at 436).\n\n     The district court did not commit clear error in finding\n\nthat Jason prevailed on only three of nineteen issues before the\n\nhearing officer and that he lost on an issue on which the parties\n\nspent more than half of the time at the hearing.       The district\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in reducing the requested fees\n\nby half to account for the time spent on pursuing the\n\nunsuccessful placement claim and by half again to reflect Jason’s\n\nlimited success on the other issues.\n\n     Jason also contends that the district court erred in cutting\n\n\n                                  12\n\foff fees for Jason’s attorney on the grounds that he unreasonably\n\nprotracted litigation.   Under the IDEA, whenever a court finds\n\nthat a fee applicant seeking attorneys’ fees under the statute\n\nhas “unreasonably protracted the final resolution of the\n\ncontroversy,” the court “shall reduce, accordingly, the amount of\n\nattorneys’ fees awarded.”   20 U.S.C. § 1415(e)(4)(F)(i).    Jason\n\nargues that the protraction provision applies only to the actions\n\ntaken by a party during the underlying hearing.    Alternatively,\n\nhe contends that failing to accept a settlement offer during the\n\nfee collection process does not constitute protraction.     We\n\ndisagree.\n\n     Jason cites no authority, and we can find none, for the\n\nproposition that the IDEA’s protraction provision applies only to\n\nthe underlying action and not to the attorneys’ fees suit.       The\n\nstatute refers generally to “the action or proceeding,” language\n\nthat covers both the administrative hearing proceeding and\n\nrelated action for attorneys’ fees.    Moreover, the protraction\n\nprovision applies to any action that hinders the “final\n\nresolution of the controversy.”    In this case, the controversy\n\nbetween Jason and the District will not be finally resolved until\n\nthe matter of attorneys’ fees is settled.    Thus, it seems clear\n\nto us that § 1415(e)(4)(F)(i) is not limited to the underlying\n\nproceedings.\n\n     This court and a number of other federal courts have held\n\nthat failing to settle can constitute protraction under\n\n§ 1415(e)(4)(F).   See Shelly C. v. Venus Indep. Sch. Dist., 878\n\n\n                                  13\n\fF.2d 862, 863 (5th Cir. 1989) (reversing grant of summary\n\njudgment for plaintiff in attorneys’ fee action under the IDEA in\n\npart because district court failed to consider whether\n\nplaintiff’s attorney unnecessarily protracted proceedings where\n\nparties ultimately settled); see also Fischer v. Rochester Comm.\n\nSchs., 780 F. Supp. 1142, 1150 (E.D. Mich. 1991) (holding that\n\nfailure to accept settlement can constitute protraction); Howey\n\nv. Tippecanoe Sch. Corp., 734 F. Supp. 1485, 1492-93 (N.D. Ind.\n\n1990) (finding that plaintiff’s counsel engaged in “a pattern of\n\ndeliberate conduct to extend these proceedings” in a case under\n\nthe Education of the Handicapped Act, the predecessor to the\n\nIDEA, by, inter alia, failing to accept a highly favorable\n\nsettlement).   Although Jason asserts in his brief that the\n\nsettlement offer of $10,000.00 was not a firm offer and thus\n\ncould not trigger § 1415(e)(4)(F)(i), he neither briefs the issue\n\nnor presents any evidence to support his contention.    We\n\ntherefore consider the issue waived.    See Fed. R. App. P.\n\n28(a)(6); Gann, 52 F.3d at 1328; Cavallini, 44 F.3d at 260 n.9.\n\nC.   Costs\n\n     Jason contends that the district court erred in awarding\n\ncosts to the District under Federal of Civil Procedure 68 because\n\nthat Rule does not apply to cases brought under the IDEA.\n\nAwarding costs to the District, Jason argues, would contravene\n\nthe IDEA’s purpose of protecting the rights of the parent and the\n\ndisabled child.   We disagree.   The policy behind Rule 68 is to\n\n“encourage settlement and avoid litigation.”    See Marek v.\n\n\n                                 14\n\fChesny, 473 U.S. 1, 5 (1985).   We see no conflict between this\n\ngoal and that of protecting the welfare of children with\n\ndisabilities and their parents.    Cf. id. at 11 (“Section 1988\n\nencourages plaintiffs to bring meritorious civil rights suits;\n\nRule 68 simply encourages settlements.   There is nothing\n\nincompatible in these two objectives.”).   Indeed, the IDEA\n\nencourages settlement in, for example, § 1415(e)(4)(F)(i), which\n\nrequires the court to reduce attorneys’ fees for a parent or\n\nguardian who unreasonably protracts the final resolution of the\n\ncontroversy.   Moreover, we have explicitly approved awards of\n\ncosts to a school district under the IDEA.    See Cypress-Fairbanks\n\nIndep. Sch. Dist. v. Michael F., 118 F.3d 245, 256-57 (5th Cir.\n\n1997) (affirming an award of costs to a school district in an\n\nIDEA case despite the parents’ argument that doing so would have\n\na chilling effect on the willingness of parents to contest school\n\ndecisions vitally affecting their children), cert. denied, 118 S.\n\nCt. 690 (1998); cf. Bonnie Ann F. v. Calallen Indep. Sch. Dist.,\n\n835 F. Supp. 340, 351-52 (S.D. Tex. 1993) (granting costs to\n\nschool district as a sanction under Federal Rules of Civil\n\nProcedure 11 and 16(f)), aff’d, 40 F.3d 386 (5th Cir. 1994).\n\n     Finally, Jason challenges the amount of the district court’s\n\naward of costs.   Specifically, he asserts that the court should\n\nnot have granted copying costs for 19,638 copies because that\n\ncopying was not a necessity but a convenience for the District’s\n\nattorneys.   He also claims that the court should not have granted\n\nfees for the testimony of Nona Matthews, who he contends was\n\n\n                                  15\n\fneither an expert in the area of special education law, as the\n\nDistrict represented, nor was reasonably necessary for the\n\nadjudication of the legal issues before the court.   According to\n\nSouthern District of Texas Local Rule 4(B), objections to a bill\n\nof costs must be filed within five days after the filing of the\n\nbill itself.   See S. Dist. Tex. Local R. 4(B).   The District\n\nfiled a bill of costs and a brief in support of the bill of costs\n\non December 5, 1996.   The next day, the District filed a\n\nsupplemental bill of costs.   All three filings contained requests\n\nfor Matthews’s witness fees and the District’s copying costs.\n\nJason did not respond until January 13, 1997, well after the\n\nfive-day time limit for filing an objection.   We therefore find\n\nthat the district court properly awarded these costs to the\n\nDistrict.\n\nD.   Other Issues\n\n     Jason raises three other issues in his brief, but does not\n\ndiscuss them at all: (1) that his parents were entitled to\n\nreimbursement for child care expenses incurred while they\n\nattended the hearing before James Holtz, (2) that the district\n\ncourt erred when it found that the District “made an official\n\noffer of settlement” to Jason on May 12, 1995, and (3) that the\n\ndistrict court abused its discretion in not awarding prejudgment\n\ninterest on the outstanding attorneys’ fees from the time of the\n\nentry of Holtz’s decision.    Jason does not present arguments or\n\nauthority to support his position on these issues, however, and\n\nwe therefore consider them waived.    See Fed. R. App. P. 28(a)(6);\n\n\n                                 16\n\fGann, 52 F.3d at 1328; Cavallini, 44 F.3d at 260 n.9.\n\n                        III.   CONCLUSION\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the\n\ndistrict court.\n\n\n\n\n                                17\n\f",

We affirm.\n\n              I.   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n     Plaintiff-appellant Jason W. (represented in this action by\n\nhis next friends and parents, to whom we refer collectively as\n\nJason) is a special education student in the Houston Independent\n\nSchool District (the District).   He has been diagnosed with\n\fattention deficit disorder and a speech impairment that cause him\n\nsignificant academic and social difficulty.   Since early 1994,\n\nJason has qualified for special education services, and the\n\nDistrict has created individualized education plans for him.\n\nThese entail, inter alia, providing resource instruction and\n\nconsultation, modifying the regular education program to meet\n\nJason’s needs, and developing behavior management plans designed\n\nto control his disruptive behavior.   During the 1994-95 school\n\nyear, Jason’s parents became dissatisfied with Jason’s special\n\neducation program and requested a hearing under the Individuals\n\nwith Disabilities in Education Act (IDEA), 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400-\n\n1491, which conditions federal aid to state special education\n\nprograms on a state’s assurance to all children with disabilities\n\n“an opportunity to present complaints with respect to any matter\n\nrelating to the identification, evaluation, or educational\n\nplacement of the child, or the provision of a free appropriate\n\neducation to such child.”   20 U.S.C. § 1415(b)(1)(E).1   Jason\n\nrejected the District’s official settlement offer, and a hearing\n\nwas held on May 25 and June 12-16, 1995 before James Holtz, an\n\nattorney appointed as a hearing officer by the state of Texas.\n\nOn July 22, 1995, Holtz filed a written decision finding that\n\n(1) Jason’s parents were entitled to reimbursement for the fees\n\nof two psychologists whom they had retained to help the District\n\ndevelop a behavior management plan for Jason, (2) that the\n\n     1\n        This opinion cites to the version of the IDEA in effect\nat the time of the events in this case. The IDEA was completely\nrevised in 1997 by Pub. L. No. 105-17, 111 Stat. 37.\n\n                                 2\n\fbehavior management plan ultimately adopted by the District was\n\nnot appropriate, and (3) that Jason’s placement in a resource\n\nclass from January 10, 1995 to February 2, 1995 was not\n\nappropriate and denied him a free appropriate public education\n\n(FAPE).\n\n     On July 26, 1995, Daniel McCall, Jason’s attorney, wrote to\n\nJennifer Jacobs, the District’s attorney, demanding $32,943.97, a\n\nsum representing the total amount of attorneys’ fees and costs.\n\nAfter McCall rejected two settlement offers of $7500.00 and\n\n$10,000.00, Jason filed an action in the federal district court\n\nfor the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, seeking\n\nrecovery of all attorneys’ fees and costs incurred in the special\n\neducation hearing and in federal court under the IDEA, 20 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1415(e)(4)(B).    On April 26, 1996, the District made an\n\nofficial offer of judgment under Federal Rule of Procedure Rule\n\n68 in the amount of $24,429.00, which Jason failed to accept.\n\nAfter a bench trial, the district court found that nineteen\n\nspecific issues had been presented to the hearing officer and\n\nthat Jason had prevailed on only three.    The court also found\n\nthat the hearing afforded Jason some specific relief that he\n\nwould not have received had he accepted the District’s settlement\n\noffer.    The court ruled that Jason was a prevailing party, but\n\nawarded him only a fraction of the attorneys’ fees he demanded.\n\nBecause it found that at least half of the time and effort\n\nexpended in the hearing had been devoted to three issues relating\n\nto a new school placement for Jason--issues on which Jason did\n\n\n                                  3\n\fnot prevail--the district court first reduced the hours his\n\nattorney claimed to have spent by half.       Of the remaining sixteen\n\nissues, the court found that Jason prevailed on only three and\n\nthat even success on these three afforded Jason little relief\n\nbeyond what the District had offered prior to the hearing.       Based\n\non these factors, the court again reduced the number of hours by\n\nhalf.   In addition, the district court ruled, based on its\n\nfinding that Jason was entitled only to total fees, costs, and\n\nexpenses in the amount of $8340.49 on the date of the District’s\n\n$10,000.00 settlement offer, that Jason had unreasonably\n\nprotracted the controversy by refusing to settle.       It declined to\n\naward Jason any fees or costs beyond $8340.49.       Jason thus did\n\nnot receive fees or costs for the federal lawsuit.\n\n     The District filed a motion to amend final judgment,\n\ncontending that under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68, it was\n\nentitled to its costs after April 26, 1996.       The District argued\n\nthat because it had made an offer of judgment on April 26, 1996\n\nin the amount of $24,429.00, which was more than the $8340.49\n\nthat Jason ultimately obtained at trial, it was entitled to all\n\ncosts after that date.   The district court granted the motion and\n\nawarded the District $2322.05.    Jason filed a motion for new\n\ntrial, which the district court denied.       Jason appeals.\n\n                          II.    DISCUSSION\n\n     Jason argues that the district court erred in awarding\n\nattorneys’ fees in a reduced amount and in granting costs to the\n\nDistrict.   We address each of these issues in turn.\n\n\n                                   4\n\fA.

Attorneys’ Fees\n\n     In any action or proceeding brought under the IDEA, the\n\ncourt “may award reasonable attorneys’ fees as part of the costs\n\nto the parents or guardian of a child or youth with a disability\n\nwho is the prevailing party.”   20 U.S.C. § 1415(e)(4)(B).    The\n\nlegislative history of the IDEA indicates that this attorneys’\n\nfees provision should be interpreted in accordance with Hensley\n\nv. Eckerhart, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110929\"><a href=\"/opinion/110929/hensley-v-eckerhart/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">424</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1983), a federal civil rights\n\ndecision.2   See H.R. REP. NO. 105-95, at 105-06.   Therefore, we\n\napply the principles outlined in Hensley and its progeny to this\n\n\n     2\n        Technically, this statement refers to the attorneys’ fees\nprovision in the post-1997 version of the IDEA, but Congress\nreenacted the identical language of 20 U.S.C. § 1415(e)(4)(B) as\n20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(3)(B) when it revised the IDEA in 1997.\nBecause the amendment did not change the language of the\nattorneys’ fees provision, we believe that Congress also intended\n20 U.S.C. § 1415(e)(4)(B) to be interpreted consistent with\nHensley v. Eckerhart.\n\n                                 5\n\fcase.\n\n     The calculation of attorneys’ fees involves a well-\n\nestablished process.   First, the court calculates a “lodestar”\n\nfee by multiplying the reasonable number of hours expended on the\n\ncase by the reasonable hourly rates for the participating\n\nlawyers.   See Louisiana Power & Light Co., 50 F.3d at 324.    The\n\ncourt then considers whether the lodestar figure should be\n\nadjusted; in making such an adjustment, the court looks to the\n\ntwelve factors established in Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express,\n\nInc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"315529\"><a href=\"/opinion/315529/7-fair-emplpraccas-1-7-empl-prac-dec-p-9079-richard-johnson-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">714</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 717-19 (5th Cir. 1974): (1) the time and\n\nlabor required for the litigation; (2) the novelty and difficulty\n\nof the questions presented; (3) the skill required to perform the\n\nlegal services properly; (4) the preclusion of other employment\n\nby the attorney due to acceptance of the case; (5) the customary\n\nfee; (6) whether the fee is fixed or contingent; (7) time\n\nlimitations imposed by the client or the circumstances; (8) the\n\namount involved and the result obtained; (9) the experience,\n\nreputation, and ability of the attorneys; (10) the\n\n“undesirability” of the case; (11) the nature and length of the\n\nprofessional relationship with the client; and (12) awards in\n\nsimilar cases.   See Louisiana Power & Light Co., 50 F.3d at 329.\n\nMany of these factors usually are subsumed within the initial\n\ncalculation of hours reasonably expended at a reasonable hourly\n\nrate, see Hensley, 461 U.S. at 434 n.9, and should not be double-\n\ncounted, see Shipes v. Trinity Indus., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"601519\"><a href=\"/opinion/601519/forest-henry-shipes-on-behalf-of-himself-and-others-similarly-situated-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">987</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">311</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 320 (5th\n\nCir. 1993).   Moreover, some Johnson factors deserve more weight\n\n\n                                 6\n\fthan others.   The Supreme Court held that “the most critical\n\nfactor” in determining the reasonableness of a fee award “is the\n\ndegree of success obtained.”    Farrar v. Hobby, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112798\"><a href=\"/opinion/112798/farrar-v-hobby/\"><span class=\"volume\">506</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">103</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 114\n\n(1992) (quoting Hensley, 461 U.S. at 436); see also Von Clark v.\n\nButler, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"549779\"><a href=\"/opinion/549779/jerry-von-clark-v-james-bruce-butler/\"><span class=\"volume\">916</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">255</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 258 (5th Cir. 1990).   This factor is\n\nparticularly crucial when, as in this case, a plaintiff is deemed\n\n“prevailing” even though he succeeded on only some of his claims.\n\nSee Hensley, 436 U.S. at 434.\n\n     Both parties agree that Jason is a prevailing party.\n\nHensley noted that a “typical” definition of “prevailing party”\n\nfor attorneys’ fees purposes is a party who “succeed[s] on any\n\nsignificant issue in litigation which achieves some of the\n\nbenefit the parties sought in bringing suit.”   461 U.S. at 433\n\n(quoting Nadeau v. Helgemoe, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"358671\"><a href=\"/opinion/358671/larry-nadeau-v-raymond-a-helgemoe-warden-new-hampshire-state-prison/\"><span class=\"volume\">581</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">275</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 278-79 (1st Cir.\n\n1978)).   This circuit has specifically held that in IDEA cases, a\n\nprevailing party is one that attains a remedy that both (1)\n\nalters the legal relationship between the school district and the\n\nhandicapped child and (2) fosters the purposes of the IDEA.      See\n\nAngela L. v. Pasadena Indep. Sch. Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"551496\"><a href=\"/opinion/551496/angela-l-bnf-mrs-zeta-l-v-pasadena-independent-school-district/\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1188</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1193-94\n\n(5th Cir. 1990).3   The hearing altered the legal relationship\n\nbetween Jason and the District, which was ordered to reimburse\n\nhis parents for the fees of both psychologists, adjust his\n\n     3\n        This circuit adopted a narrower definition of “prevailing\nparty” in the context of § 1988 attorneys’ fees cases, holding\nthat prevailing parties must succeed on the central issue of\ntheir suit and obtain the primary relief sought, see Texas State\nTeachers Ass’n v.

Furthermore, the remedy that Jason obtained fosters\n\nthe purposes of the IDEA by providing him with a free and\n\nappropriate public education.\n\n     A finding that a party   is a prevailing party only makes him\n\neligible to receive attorneys’ fees under the IDEA; it does not\n\nautomatically entitle him to recover the full amount that he\n\nspent on legal representation.     See 20 U.S.C. § 1415(e)(4)(B)\n\n(“In any action or proceeding brought under this subsection, the\n\ncourt, in its discretion, may award reasonable attorneys’\n\nfees . . . .”) (emphasis added).       Jason contends that all the\n\nJohnson factors support his application for the full amount of\n\nattorneys’ fees.   The district court, however, reduced the fees\n\nbased only on its finding that the action did not involve novel\n\nor difficult questions of fact or law and that Jason achieved\n\nlimited success at the hearing.    Because we find that the\n\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in reducing the\n\nattorneys’ fees from $32,943.97 to $8340.49 on the grounds of\n\nthese two factors, we find it unnecessary to examine the others.\n\n     First, Jason offers only bald assertions in support of his\n\ncontention that his case involved novel and difficult questions.\n\nHe states that the District is the largest public school district\n\nin the state of Texas, that the hearing was requested by the\n\nparents to contest all of the District’s decisions concerning\n\nJason’s education, and that five special education experts\n\n\n                                   8\n\ftestified at the hearing.   The size of the District or the\n\nhearing does not show that the suit involved novel or difficult\n\nlegal and factual issues, however, and Jason’s claim that the\n\nparents filed an appeal of all of the District’s decisions on\n\nJason’s education is simply inaccurate, as Holtz testified at\n\ntrial that he explicitly limited the issues to those arising out\n\nof the 1994-95 school year.   We cannot say that the district\n\ncourt committed clear error in finding that Jason’s case did not\n\ninvolve novel and difficult issues.\n\n     Second, attorneys’ fees must reflect the degree of success\n\nobtained.   The District contends that the parties presented\n\nnineteen issues to Holtz, of which Jason prevailed on three;\n\ntherefore, it contends that Jason achieved only limited success\n\nat the hearing, and his attorneys’ fees should be reduced\n\naccordingly.   Jason asserts that (1) the nineteen issues the\n\ndistrict court identified were not all presented at the hearing;\n\n(2) the question of whether Jason was receiving a FAPE, on which\n\nJason prevailed, was the primary and subsuming issue at the\n\nhearing; and (3) the issues in this suit were so interrelated\n\nthat it is impossible to allocate time among the individual\n\nissues.\n\n     We find that the district court did not commit clear error\n\nin determining that there were nineteen issues, of which Jason\n\nprevailed only on three, and did not abuse its discretion in\n\nawarding attorneys’ fees accordingly.   There is ample evidence in\n\nthe record to support the district court’s findings that Jason\n\n\n                                 9\n\fachieved limited success.     James Holtz, the hearing officer at\n\nJason’s due process hearing, testified that nineteen issues were\n\npresented to him in Jason’s case and that Jason did not prevail\n\non all those issues.   Holtz’s testimony confirmed that of Nona\n\nMatthews, the District’s expert witness, who analyzed transcripts\n\nof the hearing and concluded that nineteen issues were presented.\n\n     Moreover, both Holtz and Matthews testified at trial that\n\nJason’s primary objective was to secure placement at another\n\nschool.   Holtz also testified, and the district court found, that\n\nmore than half of the time and testimony at the hearing involved\n\nthe issue of whether Jason would be placed in another school.\n\nHoltz further testified that although another major issue was\n\nwhether the District had provided Jason with a free appropriate\n\npublic education during the 1994-95 school year, this issue did\n\nnot subsume all others, and Jason was not entirely successful on\n\nhis claim that he had been denied a FAPE:\n\n     Holtz:     The major issue--\n\n     McCall:    Yes.\n\n     Holtz:     --before me involved I guess the alternate\n                determination, whether or not there was a Free\n                Appropriate Public Education being provided to the\n                student during that school year. But this did not\n                include all of the issues that were raised by the\n                parties.\n\n     McCall:    And did the petitioner prevail on the major issue\n                of whether there was denial of F.A.P.E.?\n\n     Holtz:     Partially.4\n\n     4\n        Jason argues that the district court erred in striking\nseveral post-trial exhibits, one of which was an affidavit from\nJames Holtz in support of Jason’s application for attorneys’\n\n                                     10\n\fFurthermore, the language of the IDEA itself demonstrates that\n\nnot all of the nineteen issues that Holtz identified can be\n\nsubsumed under the general heading of denial of a FAPE.    The IDEA\n\nguarantees “an opportunity to present complaints with respect to\n\nany matter relating to the identification, evaluation, or\n\neducational placement of the child, or the provision of a free\n\nappropriate public education to such child.”   20 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1415(b)(1)(E) (emphasis added).    The IDEA thus treats placement\n\nand denial of a FAPE as separate issues; moreover, it implies\n\nthat identification and evaluation of the child also should be\n\nconsidered distinct issues.   Even assuming that the remaining\n\nissues do fall under the FAPE umbrella, it is undisputed that\n\nJason prevailed only on three of those issues; thus, as Holtz\n\ntestified, he was only partially successful on the issue of\n\nwhether he was denied a FAPE.\n\n     Jason also contends that the nature of a special education\n\ncase is such that the issues are so interrelated that it is\n\nimpossible to determine how much time was spent on each issue.\n\n\nfees. Although Jason includes this question in his statement of\nthe issues, he provides no argument or authority in support of\nhis position. We have held that failure to provide any legal or\nfactual analysis of an issue on appeal waives that issue. See\nCavallini v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins.

The\ndistrict court struck these exhibits, Jason provides no argument\nas to why we should find that it erred in doing so, and we\ntherefore decline to address them.\n\n                                11\n\fThis argument lacks merit; indeed, we have rejected a similar\n\nclaim in an analogous case.     See Migis v. Pearle Vision, Inc.,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"751557\"><a href=\"/opinion/751557/78-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1379-73-empl-prac-dec-p-45308-melissa/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1041</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1048 (5th Cir. 1998).       In Migis, the plaintiff\n\nalleged four acts of discrimination on the basis of sex or\n\npregnancy.   She prevailed only on one, and only on the basis of\n\npregnancy discrimination.     See id.    The district court reduced\n\nthe amount of attorneys’ fees.     See id. at 1047.    On appeal,\n\nMigis argued that her case could not be segregated into discrete\n\nclaims because all of her contentions involved a common core of\n\nfacts and because she only prosecuted a single, discrete claim of\n\npregnancy discrimination.     See id. at 1048.    We rejected this\n\nargument, holding that even where “a plaintiff has achieved only\n\npartial or limited success, the product of hours reasonably\n\nexpended on the litigation as a whole times a reasonable hourly\n\nrate may be an excessive amount.       This will be true even where\n\nthe plaintiff’s claims were interrelated, nonfrivolous, and\n\nraised in good faith.”   Id. (quoting Hensley, 461 U.S. at 436).\n\n     The district court did not commit clear error in finding\n\nthat Jason prevailed on only three of nineteen issues before the\n\nhearing officer and that he lost on an issue on which the parties\n\nspent more than half of the time at the hearing.       The district\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in reducing the requested fees\n\nby half to account for the time spent on pursuing the\n\nunsuccessful placement claim and by half again to reflect Jason’s\n\nlimited success on the other issues.\n\n     Jason also contends that the district court erred in cutting\n\n\n                                  12\n\foff fees for Jason’s attorney on the grounds that he unreasonably\n\nprotracted litigation.   Under the IDEA, whenever a court finds\n\nthat a fee applicant seeking attorneys’ fees under the statute\n\nhas “unreasonably protracted the final resolution of the\n\ncontroversy,” the court “shall reduce, accordingly, the amount of\n\nattorneys’ fees awarded.”   20 U.S.C. § 1415(e)(4)(F)(i).    Jason\n\nargues that the protraction provision applies only to the actions\n\ntaken by a party during the underlying hearing.    Alternatively,\n\nhe contends that failing to accept a settlement offer during the\n\nfee collection process does not constitute protraction.     We\n\ndisagree.\n\n     Jason cites no authority, and we can find none, for the\n\nproposition that the IDEA’s protraction provision applies only to\n\nthe underlying action and not to the attorneys’ fees suit.       The\n\nstatute refers generally to “the action or proceeding,” language\n\nthat covers both the administrative hearing proceeding and\n\nrelated action for attorneys’ fees.    Moreover, the protraction\n\nprovision applies to any action that hinders the “final\n\nresolution of the controversy.”    In this case, the controversy\n\nbetween Jason and the District will not be finally resolved until\n\nthe matter of attorneys’ fees is settled.    Thus, it seems clear\n\nto us that § 1415(e)(4)(F)(i) is not limited to the underlying\n\nproceedings.\n\n     This court and a number of other federal courts have held\n\nthat failing to settle can constitute protraction under\n\n§ 1415(e)(4)(F).

Although Jason asserts in his brief that the\n\nsettlement offer of $10,000.00 was not a firm offer and thus\n\ncould not trigger § 1415(e)(4)(F)(i), he neither briefs the issue\n\nnor presents any evidence to support his contention.    We\n\ntherefore consider the issue waived.    See Fed. R. App. P.\n\n28(a)(6); Gann, 52 F.3d at 1328; Cavallini, 44 F.3d at 260 n.9.\n\nC.   Costs\n\n     Jason contends that the district court erred in awarding\n\ncosts to the District under Federal of Civil Procedure 68 because\n\nthat Rule does not apply to cases brought under the IDEA.\n\nAwarding costs to the District, Jason argues, would contravene\n\nthe IDEA’s purpose of protecting the rights of the parent and the\n\ndisabled child.   We disagree.   The policy behind Rule 68 is to\n\n“encourage settlement and avoid litigation.”    See Marek v.\n\n\n                                 14\n\fChesny, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111495\"><a href=\"/opinion/111495/marek-v-chesny/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 5 (1985).   We see no conflict between this\n\ngoal and that of protecting the welfare of children with\n\ndisabilities and their parents.    Cf. id. at 11 (“Section 1988\n\nencourages plaintiffs to bring meritorious civil rights suits;\n\nRule 68 simply encourages settlements.   There is nothing\n\nincompatible in these two objectives.”).   Indeed, the IDEA\n\nencourages settlement in, for example, § 1415(e)(4)(F)(i), which\n\nrequires the court to reduce attorneys’ fees for a parent or\n\nguardian who unreasonably protracts the final resolution of the\n\ncontroversy.   Moreover, we have explicitly approved awards of\n\ncosts to a school district under the IDEA.    See Cypress-Fairbanks\n\nIndep. Sch. Dist. v. Michael F., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"743507\"><a href=\"/opinion/743507/cypress-fairbanks-independent-school-district-v-michael-f-bnf-mr-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">245</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 256-57 (5th Cir.\n\n1997) (affirming an award of costs to a school district in an\n\nIDEA case despite the parents’ argument that doing so would have\n\na chilling effect on the willingness of parents to contest school\n\ndecisions vitally affecting their children), cert. denied, 118 S.\n\nCt. 690 (1998); cf.

Specifically, he asserts that the court should\n\nnot have granted copying costs for 19,638 copies because that\n\ncopying was not a necessity but a convenience for the District’s\n\nattorneys.   He also claims that the court should not have granted\n\nfees for the testimony of Nona Matthews, who he contends was\n\n\n                                  15\n\fneither an expert in the area of special education law, as the\n\nDistrict represented, nor was reasonably necessary for the\n\nadjudication of the legal issues before the court.   According to\n\nSouthern District of Texas Local Rule 4(B), objections to a bill\n\nof costs must be filed within five days after the filing of the\n\nbill itself.   See S. Dist. Tex. Local R. 4(B).   The District\n\nfiled a bill of costs and a brief in support of the bill of costs\n\non December 5, 1996.   The next day, the District filed a\n\nsupplemental bill of costs.   All three filings contained requests\n\nfor Matthews’s witness fees and the District’s copying costs.\n\nJason did not respond until January 13, 1997, well after the\n\nfive-day time limit for filing an objection.   We therefore find\n\nthat the district court properly awarded these costs to the\n\nDistrict.\n\nD.   Other Issues\n\n     Jason raises three other issues in his brief, but does not\n\ndiscuss them at all: (1) that his parents were entitled to\n\nreimbursement for child care expenses incurred while they\n\nattended the hearing before James Holtz, (2) that the district\n\ncourt erred when it found that the District “made an official\n\noffer of settlement” to Jason on May 12, 1995, and (3) that the\n\ndistrict court abused its discretion in not awarding prejudgment\n\ninterest on the outstanding attorneys’ fees from the time of the\n\nentry of Holtz’s decision.    Jason does not present arguments or\n\nauthority to support his position on these issues, however, and\n\nwe therefore consider them waived.    See Fed. R. App. P. 28(a)(6);\n\n\n                                 16\n\fGann, 52 F.3d at 1328; Cavallini, 44 F.3d at 260 n.9.\n\n                        III.   CONCLUSION\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the\n\ndistrict court.\n\n\n\n\n                                17\n\f</pre>",
