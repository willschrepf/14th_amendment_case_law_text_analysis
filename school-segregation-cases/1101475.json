They seek to enjoin Governor Edmund G. Brown and\nMark Yudof, President of the University of California, from\nenforcing section 31. Yudof asserts that he is immune from\nsuit under the Eleventh Amendment and that he is an\nimproper defendant pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Proce-\ndure 21. Although we hold that Plaintiffs’ suit against Yudof\nis not barred by Eleventh Amendment immunity, we also hold\nthat Plaintiffs’ equal protection challenge to section 31 is pre-\ncluded by Coalition for Economic Equity v. Wilson (Wilson\nII), 122 F.3d 692 (9th Cir. 1997), where we previously upheld\n\f3562              COALITION TO DEFEND v. BROWN\nthe constitutionality of section 31. The district court correctly\ndismissed the complaint against the governor and Yudof for\nfailure to state a claim.\n\n  I.     FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n   The University of California is a public university system\ngoverned by the Regents of the University of California\n(“U.C. Regents”), a board with “full powers of organization\nand government,” including the authority to set the Universi-\nty’s admission policy. Cal. Const. art. IX, § 9. Plaintiffs allege\nthat, as a result of the civil rights movement, the U.C. Regents\nadopted affirmative action programs to increase the number of\nAfrican American, Latino, and Native American students. The\nprograms were effective in rapidly and significantly increas-\ning the number of underrepresented minorities.\n\n  In November 1996, Californian voters adopted Proposition\n209, which amended the California Constitution to provide:\n\n       (a) The state shall not discriminate against, or grant\n       preferential treatment to, any individual or group on\n       the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national\n       origin in the operation of public employment, public\n       education, or public contracting.\n\n       ....\n\n       (f) For the purposes of this section, “state” shall\n       include, but not necessarily be limited to, the state\n       itself, any city, county, city and county, public uni-\n       versity system, including the University of Califor-\n       nia, community college district, school district,\n       special district, or any other political subdivision or\n       governmental instrumentality of or within the state.\n\nCal. Const. art. I, § 31.\n\f                 COALITION TO DEFEND v. BROWN                  3563\n   Several individuals and groups immediately brought suit\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against state officials and political\nsubdivisions of the state, alleging, inter alia, that section 31\nviolated the Equal Protection Clause. See Coal. for Econ.\nEquity v. Wilson (Wilson I), 946 F. Supp. 1480, 1488-90\n(N.D. Cal. 1996). The district court in Wilson I granted the\nrequested relief by the plaintiffs, holding that section 31 was\nlikely unconstitutional and granting a preliminary injunction\nenjoining its enforcement. Id. at 1520.\n\n   On appeal, we vacated the preliminary injunction and\nremanded the matter because the plaintiffs had shown no like-\nlihood of success on the merits of their claims. Wilson II, 122\nF.3d at 710-11. In so doing, we rejected the plaintiffs’ equal\nprotection claim under both a conventional equal protection\nanalysis and a political-structure equal protection analysis. Id.\nat 701-09. Under a conventional analysis, the court “focuses\non whether the government has classified individuals on the\nbasis of impermissible criteria.” Valeria v. Davis, 307 F.3d\n1036, 1039 (9th Cir. 2002). We held in Wilson II that section\n31 is constitutional under a conventional equal protection\nanalysis because it “prohibits the State from classifying indi-\nviduals by race or gender” and, therefore, it “a fortiori does\nnot classify individuals” impermissibly. 122 F.3d at 702.\nUnder a political-structure analysis, the question is whether a\nstate action creates “a political structure that treats all individ-\nuals as equals . . . [but] place[s] special burdens on the ability\nof minority groups to achieve beneficial legislation.” Wash-\nington v. Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1, 458 U.S. 457, 467 (1982)\n(citation and quotation marks omitted). Applying this analy-\nsis, we determined that section 31 was constitutional because\nthe law “addresse[d] in neutral-fashion race-related and\ngender-related matters.” 122 F.3d at 707. Section 31 prohib-\nited preferential treatment, we held, not “equal protection\nrights against political obstructions to equal treatment.” Id. at\n708.\n\n   After section 31 became law, the University ceased consid-\nering race or sex in student admissions. The year after section\n\f3564            COALITION TO DEFEND v. BROWN\n31 passed, the number of African American, Latino, and\nNative American freshmen at UCLA and U.C. Berkeley\ndropped by over 50%. The U.C. Regents have attempted to\nmitigate the drop in underrepresented minorities by adopting\na “comprehensive review” of applicants, utilizing different\nstandardized tests, admitting the top 4% of graduates from\nany high school, and decreasing the weight of standardized\ntests. It is alleged that these measures have had only a minor\nimpact on the number of underrepresented minority students.\n\n   Plaintiffs initiated the instant putative class action to once\nagain challenge the constitutionality of section 31 under con-\nventional and political-structure equal protection analyses.\nDefendants U.C. Regents, then-Governor Arnold Schwar-\nzenegger, and Yudof moved to dismiss the complaint, assert-\ning (along with other defenses) that they were immune from\nsuit under the Eleventh Amendment and that they were not\nproper defendants. Former U.C. Regent Ward Connerly, the\nAmerican Civil Rights Foundation, and the California Associ-\nation of Scholars then moved to intervene as defendants and\nfiled a motion to dismiss the complaint under Rule 12(b)(6).\n\n   The district court allowed Connerly and the American Civil\nRights Foundation to intervene. The court dismissed the U.C.\nRegents on sovereign immunity grounds, which Plaintiffs\nhave not appealed. The district court then denied the motions\nto dismiss by former Governor Schwarzenegger and Yudof.\nThe court ruled that the governor and Yudof were not immune\nfrom suit and were proper defendants because they were suffi-\nciently connected to the enforcement of section 31 through\ntheir respective roles as President of the U.C. Regents and\nPresident of the University. In a separate order, the district\ncourt dismissed with prejudice both of Plaintiffs’ claims,\nholding that it was bound by Wilson II to uphold the constitu-\ntionality of section 31.\n\n  Plaintiffs appeal the dismissal of their claims, and Yudof\ncross-appeals the district court’s decision to deny him state\n\f                 COALITION TO DEFEND v. BROWN                  3565\nimmunity and to keep him in the suit. Governor Brown was\nthen substituted as a defendant.\n\n  II.   JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n   We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291. We “re-\nview de novo a district court’s order granting a motion to dis-\nmiss under Rule 12(b)(6),” Cook v. Brewer, 637 F.3d 1002,\n1004 (9th Cir. 2011). A denial of Eleventh Amendment\nimmunity is also reviewed de novo. Eason v. Clark Cnty. Sch.\nDist., 303 F.3d 1137, 1140 (9th Cir. 2002). We review a dis-\ntrict court’s decision to dismiss with prejudice for abuse of\ndiscretion. Stearns v. Ticketmaster Corp., 655 F.3d 1013,\n1018 (9th Cir. 2011).\n\n                      III.   DISCUSSION\n\n                                A.\n\n   Because our precedent dictates that we resolve an Eleventh\nAmendment immunity claim before reaching the merits, we\nfirst address Yudof’s cross-appeal. See In re Jackson, 184\nF.3d 1046, 1048 (9th Cir. 1999). Yudof argues that the district\ncourt erred in denying him Eleventh Amendment immunity.\nWe disagree.\n\n   [1] “The Eleventh Amendment erects a general bar against\nfederal lawsuits brought against a state.” Porter v. Jones, 319\nF.3d 483, 491 (9th Cir. 2003). It does not, however, bar\nactions for prospective declaratory or injunctive relief against\nstate officers in their official capacities for their alleged viola-\ntions of federal law. See Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123,\n155-56 (1908); Alden v. Maine, 527 U.S. 706, 747 (1999).\nThe individual state official sued “must have some connection\nwith the enforcement of the act.” Ex parte Young, 209 U.S.\nat 157. In addition, that connection “must be fairly direct; a\ngeneralized duty to enforce state law or general supervisory\npower over the persons responsible for enforcing the chal-\n\f3566            COALITION TO DEFEND v. BROWN\nlenged provision will not subject an official to suit.” L.A.\nCnty. Bar Ass’n v. Eu, 979 F.2d 697, 704 (9th Cir. 1992).\n\n   [2] Relying primarily on Snoeck v. Brussa, 153 F.3d 984\n(9th Cir. 1998), Yudof contends that the district court improp-\nerly denied him Eleventh Amendment immunity. Snoeck held\nthat members of a judicial discipline commission were\nimmune from suit under the Eleventh Amendment because\nthey had no enforcement power over the challenged rule. Id.\nat 987. The plaintiffs in Snoeck alleged that the commission-\ners violated their First Amendment rights by prohibiting them\nfrom disclosing the facts contained in their complaints against\ntwo Nevada judges. Id. at 985. Pursuant to the Nevada Consti-\ntution, the Nevada Supreme Court adopted judicial rules that\nrequired confidentiality, and that allowed it to hold in con-\ntempt those who breached confidentiality. Id. We held that the\ncommissioners were immune from suit because the commis-\nsion had no power of contempt and could not amend the judi-\ncial rules. Id. at 987.\n\n   Analogizing the instant case to Snoeck, Yudof argues that\nhe lacks authority to amend, repeal, deviate from, or enforce\nsection 31. He asserts that he can only comply with section\n31, but cannot punish those who do not, just like the commis-\nsioners in Snoeck. Without a connection to the enforcement of\nsection 31, he claims he cannot be sued.\n\n   The district court correctly denied Eleventh Amendment\nimmunity pursuant to Eu, 979 F.2d at 704. In Eu, the plaintiff\nalleged that a statute limiting the number of superior court\njudges caused delays in civil litigation and deprived litigants\nof access to the courts. Id. at 699. The governor and secretary\nof state contended that they lacked a connection with the\nenforcement of the statute. Id. at 704. This court rejected that\nargument and held that the officials had a “fairly direct” and\n“specific connection” to enforcement of the law because they\nappointed judges to newly created positions and certified sub-\nsequent elections for those positions. Id. The statute was\n\f                COALITION TO DEFEND v. BROWN                3567\n“being given effect” by the officials, and therefore the state\nofficials were not immune from suit. Id.\n\n   [3] Applying Ex parte Young and Eu, we hold that Yudof\nis not immune from Plaintiff ’s suit seeking prospective\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief relating to the admission\ncriteria of the university of which he is president. Yudof has\na “fairly direct” connection, to say the least, to the enforce-\nment of section 31. See Eu, 979 F.2d at 704. As the head of\nthe University of California, he does more than just “live\nwith” section 31. He enforces it. He is duty-bound to ensure\nthat his employees follow it and refrain from using race as a\ncriterion in admission decisions. Yudof’s argument that he is\nmerely “implementing,” not “enforcing” section 31, mini-\nmizes his role as President of the University and is inconsis-\ntent with Eu. Lastly, Yudof’s reliance on Snoeck is\nunavailing. Unlike Snoeck, where the Nevada Supreme Court\nwas expressly charged with enforcement, 153 F.3d at 987,\nsection 31 does not designate any entity to commence\nenforcement proceedings. At the University of California, the\nbuck stops with Yudof.\n\n                               B.\n\n   Turning to the merits, Plaintiffs argue that section 31 is\nunconstitutional under a “conventional equal protection analy-\nsis” because it allows admission officials to depart from the\nUniversity’s baseline admission criteria for any purpose—\nveteran status, income, geographical background, athleticism,\nor legacy—but not for “racial diversity” or to address “de\nfacto racial segregation and inequality.” This, Plaintiffs argue,\n“driv[es] down minority admissions” and treats African\nAmerican, Latino, and Native American students unequally\nfrom their Asian American and white counterparts. Plaintiffs\nalso allege that section 31 is unconstitutional because it cre-\nated an “unequal political structure” that prevents racial\nminorities from “using the normal democratic process to seek\nvotes by the [U.C.] Regents to reverse . . . [the] ban on affir-\n\f3568             COALITION TO DEFEND v. BROWN\nmative action in admissions.” While other individuals and\ngroups may petition the U.C. Regents to change the admission\npolicy, African Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans\nmust persuade the electorate to repeal or amend section 31.\n\n   [4] Our prior decision in Wilson II dealt with and rejected\nboth of these arguments. In Wilson II, this court held that,\n“[a]s a matter of ‘conventional’ equal protection analysis,\nthere is simply no doubt that Proposition 209 is constitution-\nal.” 122 F.3d at 701. Wilson II further held that section 31,\nunder a political-structure equal protection analysis, did not\nviolate the Fourteenth Amendment. 122 F.3d at 704-09.\n\n   [5] We are bound by Wilson II. See Santamaria v. Horsley,\n110 F.3d 1352, 1355 (9th Cir. 1997) (“It is settled law that\none three-judge panel of this court cannot ordinarily recon-\nsider or overrule the decision of a prior panel.”). Pursuant to\nWilson II, we affirm the district court’s dismissal of Plaintiffs’\nclaims with prejudice. See Polich v. Burlington N., Inc., 942\nF.2d 1467, 1472 (9th Cir. 1991) (holding that dismissal with\nprejudice is proper when “it is clear, upon de novo review,\nthat the complaint could not be saved by any amendment”).\n\n   Plaintiffs argue that Wilson II is inapposite because it was\na facial challenge of section 31, whereas Plaintiffs here bring\nan as-applied constitutional challenge. They assert that the\nWilson II court did not contemplate section 31’s effects on\nhigher education.\n\n   [6] As the district court noted, however, the Wilson II court\nconsidered the very scenario Plaintiffs now allege. In Wilson\nII, we “accept[ed] without question[ ] the district court’s find-\nings that [section 31] burdens members of insular minorities\n. . . who otherwise would seek to obtain race-based and\ngender-based preferential treatment from local entities.” 122\nF.3d at 705. The district court in Wilson I made specific find-\nings regarding the effects section 31 would have on higher\neducation and expressly found that the number of African\n\f                   COALITION TO DEFEND v. BROWN                       3569\nAmerican and Native American students across the University\nwould fall by as much as 50%. 946 F. Supp. at 1497. This fac-\ntual finding by the district court is in line with the facts\nalleged in the complaint. The Wilson II court clearly relied on\nthe district court’s findings. See Wilson II, 122 F.3d at 698\n(“It further would cause enrollment of African-American,\nLatino, and American Indian students in public colleges to fall\n. . . .”). Thus, Plaintiffs’ contention that Wilson II did not\naddress and therefore does not foreclose their as-applied equal\nprotection challenge fails.\n\n   To try to get out from under Wilson II’s binding precedent,\nPlaintiffs also argue that Wilson II is irreconcilable with Grut-\nter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306, 325 (2003), which held that\nstudent body diversity is a compelling state interest and that\nthe Constitution permits narrowly tailored race-based admis-\nsion policies. Wilson II and Grutter, however, are easily rec-\nonciled.\n\n   Grutter upheld as permissible certain race-based affirma-\ntive action programs. Id. It did not hold that such programs\nare constitutionally required. See Coal. to Defend Affirmative\nAction v. Granholm, 473 F.3d 237, 249 (6th Cir. 2006)\n(“Grutter never said, or even hinted, that state universities\nmust do what they narrowly may do.”).1 Furthermore, as the\ndistrict court pointed out,\n\n      [In Grutter,] the Supreme Court cited the “race-\n      neutral alternatives” to racial preferences used by\n      “Universities in California, Florida, and Washington\n      State, where racial preferences are prohibited by\n  1\n    The Supreme Court appears poised to reconsider whether race-based\naffirmative action programs are even permissible at all. On February 21,\n2012, the Court granted certiorari in Fisher v. University of Texas, No. 11-\n345, 2012 WL 538328 (U.S. Feb. 21, 2012). The question presented is:\n“Whether . . . [its] decisions interpreting the Equal Protection Clause of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment, including Grutter . . . permit the University\nof Texas at Austin’s use of race in undergraduate admissions decisions.”\n\f3570            COALITION TO DEFEND v. BROWN\n    state law.” [539 U.S. at 342.] The Court suggested\n    that California and other states were “laboratories”\n    experimenting with alternatives to racial preferences,\n    writing: “Universities in other States can and should\n    draw on the most promising aspects of these race-\n    neutral alternatives as they develop.” Id. This discus-\n    sion refutes Plaintiffs’ contention that the Supreme\n    Court intended Grutter to overrule Wilson [II].\n\nBecause Grutter spoke only to whether race-based affirmative\naction programs are permitted, and not to whether they can be\nprohibited as was the case in Wilson II, it is impossible to\nhold that Grutter overrules Wilson II.\n\n  The bottom line is that Wilson II remains the law of the cir-\ncuit, and the district court faithfully applied it.\n\n  The district court’s order dismissing the complaint is\nAFFIRMED.\n\n\n\nTASHIMA, Circuit Judge, specially concurring in part and\ndissenting in part:\n\n   Judge Silverman is, of course, entirely correct that Plain-\ntiffs’ challenge to Proposition 209 is foreclosed by Coalition\nfor Economic Equity v. Wilson, 122 F.3d 692 (9th Cir. 1997)\n(“Wilson II”). I continue to believe now, as I did when the\ncase was decided, that Wilson II was wrongly decided. See\nWilson II, 122 F.3d at 711-12 (Schroeder, J., dissenting from\nthe denial of rehearing en banc); id. at 712-18 (Norris, J.,\nrespecting the denial of rehearing en banc). Because, how-\never, Wilson II remains the law of the circuit and, as Judge\nSilverman states, “[w]e are bound by Wilson II,” I concur in\nPart III.B. of the majority opinion.\n\n   Part III.A is a different matter. I disagree with the majori-\nty’s conclusion that the district court correctly denied Elev-\n\f                    COALITION TO DEFEND v. BROWN                         3571\nenth Amendment immunity to defendant Mark Yudof, as\nPresident of the University of California. Maj. Op. at 3567. I\ntherefore dissent from Part III.A.\n\n   The majority relies on L.A. Cnty. Bar Ass’n v. Eu, 979 F.2d\n697 (9th Cir. 1992), to hold that because Yudof has a “fairly\ndirect connection” with enforcement of § 31,1 he therefore is\nnot immune from suit pursuant to Ex parte Young. Id. at 704\n(citing Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 157 (1908)). But with\nregard to Yudof’s claim of Eleventh Amendment immunity,\nthis case is more like Snoeck v. Brussa, 153 F.3d 984 (9th Cir.\n1998), than Eu. In Eu, we addressed a statute that was “simply\nnot the type that gives rise to enforcement proceedings.” Id.\nIn contrast, and contrary to the majority’s assertion, the law\ndoes provide for § 31 enforcement proceedings. Cf. Snoeck,\n153 F.3d at 987. Although § 31 itself does not designate a\nspecific state entity to commence proceedings, other provi-\nsions of the California Constitution expressly charge the Gov-\nernor and the Attorney General with the duty and authority to\nenforce the law.2 Cal. Const. art. V, §§ 1, 13. Those State\nexecutive officers, not Yudof, are the state officials responsi-\nble for enforcement of § 31. See Coal. for Econ. Equity v.\nWilson, 946 F. Supp. 1480, 1492 (N.D. Cal. 1996).\n\n   In Snoeck, we held that the Eleventh Amendment barred\nsuit against members of the Nevada Commission on Judicial\nDiscipline who lacked authority to enforce the challenged\nrules through the exercise of contempt power or disciplinary\nauthority. 153 F.3d at 987. We held that it was “only collat-\neral, and of no consequence” that Commission members\napplied the rules and engaged in “ministerial, administrative\n  1\n     Proposition 209, upon its approval by the California electorate, became\nCal. Const. art I, § 31 (hereinafter “§ 31”).\n   2\n     In certain circumstances, private litigants may also bring suit to enforce\n§ 31. See Cal. Const. art. I, § 31(g) (“The remedies available for violations\nof this section shall be the same . . . as are otherwise available for viola-\ntions of then-existing California antidiscrimination law.”).\n\f3572            COALITION TO DEFEND v. BROWN\npractices designed to remind citizens of their duties under the\nrules.” Id. Like the Commission members in Snoeck, Yudof\nlacks the authority to execute enforcement proceedings; his\nstatutory duty is not to punish violations of the law, but to\n“accept and apply [the law] . . . however much [he] might dis-\nagree with [it].” Id. Although Yudof must implement § 31 like\nany other state law applicable to the University in the course\nof carrying out his duties as President, Snoeck holds that such\n“general administrative responsibilities” do not establish the\ndirect connection with enforcement of the statute required by\nEx parte Young. Id.\n\n   Because Snoeck is binding, I would hold that the district\ncourt erred in denying Yudof immunity. Unable to distinguish\nSnoeck, in the end the majority simply relies on the conclu-\nsory statement that “[a]t the University, the buck stops with\nYudof.” Maj. Op. at 3567. But that assertion is mistaken as\na matter of California law, under which The Regents of the\nUniversity of California administer the University and are\ngranted the “full powers of organization and government” to\ndo so. See Cal. Const. art. IX, § 9. See also, e.g., Campbell v.\nRegents of the Univ. of Calif., 106 P.3d 976 (Cal. 2005) (not-\ning that the Regents “as a constitutionally created arm of the\nstate have virtual autonomy in self-governance” (internal quo-\ntation marks and citation omitted). Recognizing this, the dis-\ntrict court granted the Regents’ motion to dismiss on Eleventh\nAmendment immunity grounds, which dismissal has not been\nappealed. It is a mystery to me then, why the Regents —\nwhere the buck does stop — are entitled to Eleventh Amend-\nment immunity, but its subordinate officer, the President of\nthe University, is not.\n\n   As should be evident, I have never agreed with Snoeck’s\nholding or the rationale on which it is based. See Snoeck, 153\nF.3d at 988-91 (Tashima, J., dissenting). Still, it remains the\nlaw of the circuit and this three-judge panel should give it the\nrespect it is due. Because I conclude that Snoeck, rather than\nEu, controls this case, I would reverse the district court’s\n\f                COALITION TO DEFEND v. BROWN               3573\ndenial of Eleventh Amendment immunity to defendant Yudof.\nI therefore respectfully dissent from Part III.A of the majority\nopinion.\n\f",

SILVERMAN, Circuit Judges, and MARVIN J. GARBIS, Senior District Judge.<sup>[*]</sup></p>\n<p>Opinion by Judge SILVERMAN; Partial Concurrence and Partial Dissent by Judge TASHIMA.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>OPINION</h2>\n<p>SILVERMAN, Circuit Judge:</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs are California high school and college students who allege that section 31 of article I of the California Constitution violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and causes the unfair exclusion of African American, Latino, and Native American students from higher education. They seek to enjoin Governor Edmund G. Brown and Mark Yudof, President of the University of California, from enforcing section 31. Yudof asserts that he is immune from suit under the Eleventh Amendment and that he is an improper defendant pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 21. Although we hold that Plaintiffs' suit against Yudof is not barred by Eleventh Amendment immunity, we also hold that Plaintiffs' equal protection challenge to section 31 is precluded by <i>Coalition for Economic Equity v. Wilson (Wilson II),</i> 122 F.3d 692 (9th Cir.1997), where we previously upheld the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1132</span> constitutionality of section 31. The district court correctly dismissed the complaint against the governor and Yudof for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The University of California is a public university system governed by the Regents of the University of California (\"U.C. Regents\"), a board with \"full powers of organization and government,\" including the authority to set the University's admission policy. Cal. Const. art. IX, § 9. Plaintiffs allege that, as a result of the civil rights movement, the U.C. Regents adopted affirmative action programs to increase the number of African American, Latino, and Native American students. The programs were effective in rapidly and significantly increasing the number of underrepresented minorities.</p>\n<p>In November 1996, Californian voters adopted Proposition 209, which amended the California Constitution to provide:</p>\n<blockquote>(a) The state shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public employment, public education, or public contracting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(f) For the purposes of this section, \"state\" shall include, but not necessarily be limited to, the state itself, any city, county, city and county, public university system, including the University of California, community college district, school district, special district, or any other political subdivision or governmental instrumentality of or within the state.</blockquote>\n<p>Cal. Const. art. I, § 31.</p>\n<p>Several individuals and groups immediately brought suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against state officials and political subdivisions of the state, alleging, inter alia, that section 31 violated the Equal Protection Clause. <i>See </i><i>Coal. for Econ. Equity v. Wilson (Wilson I),</i> 946 F.Supp. 1480, 1488-90 (N.D.Cal.1996). The district court in <i>Wilson I</i> granted the requested relief by the plaintiffs, holding that section 31 was likely unconstitutional and granting a preliminary injunction enjoining its enforcement. <i>Id.</i> at 1520.</p>\n<p>On appeal, we vacated the preliminary injunction and remanded the matter because the plaintiffs had shown no likelihood of success on the merits of their claims. <i>Wilson II,</i> 122 F.3d at 710-11. In so doing, we rejected the plaintiffs' equal protection claim under both a conventional equal protection analysis and a political-structure equal protection analysis. <i>Id.</i> at 701-09. Under a conventional analysis, the court \"focuses on whether the government has classified individuals on the basis of impermissible criteria.\" <i>Valeria v. Davis,</i> 307 F.3d 1036, 1039 (9th Cir.2002). We held in <i>Wilson II</i> that section 31 is constitutional under a conventional equal protection analysis because it \"prohibits the State from classifying individuals by race or gender\" and, therefore, it \"<i>a fortiori</i> does not classify individuals\" impermissibly. 122 F.3d at 702. Under a political-structure analysis, the question is whether a state action creates \"a political structure that treats all individuals as equals ... [but] place[s] special burdens on the ability of minority groups to achieve beneficial legislation.\" <i>Washington v. Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1,</i> 458 U.S. 457, 467, 102 S.Ct. 3187, 73 L.Ed.2d 896 (1982) (citation and quotation marks omitted). Applying this analysis, we determined that section 31 was constitutional because the law \"addresse[d] in neutral-fashion race-related and gender-related matters.\" 122 F.3d at 707. Section 31 prohibited preferential treatment, we held, not \"equal protection <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1133</span> rights against political obstructions to equal treatment.\" <i>Id.</i> at 708.</p>\n<p>After section 31 became law, the University ceased considering race or sex in student admissions. The year after section 31 passed, the number of African American, Latino, and Native American freshmen at UCLA and U.C. Berkeley dropped by over 50%. The U.C. Regents have attempted to mitigate the drop in underrepresented minorities by adopting a \"comprehensive review\" of applicants, utilizing different standardized tests, admitting the top 4% of graduates from any high school, and decreasing the weight of standardized tests. It is alleged that these measures have had only a minor impact on the number of underrepresented minority students.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs initiated the instant putative class action to once again challenge the constitutionality of section 31 under conventional and political-structure equal protection analyses. Defendants U.C. Regents, then-Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Yudof moved to dismiss the complaint, asserting (along with other defenses) that they were immune from suit under the Eleventh Amendment and that they were not proper defendants. Former U.C. Regent Ward Connerly, the American Civil Rights Foundation, and the California Association of Scholars then moved to intervene as defendants and filed a motion to dismiss the complaint under Rule 12(b)(6).</p>\n<p>The district court allowed Connerly and the American Civil Rights Foundation to intervene. The court dismissed the U.C. Regents on sovereign immunity grounds, which Plaintiffs have not appealed. The district court then denied the motions to dismiss by former Governor Schwarzenegger and Yudof. The court ruled that the governor and Yudof were not immune from suit and were proper defendants because they were sufficiently connected to the enforcement of section 31 through their respective roles as President of the U.C. Regents and President of the University. In a separate order, the district court dismissed with prejudice both of Plaintiffs' claims, holding that it was bound by <i>Wilson II</i> to uphold the constitutionality of section 31.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs appeal the dismissal of their claims, and Yudof cross-appeals the district court's decision to deny him state immunity and to keep him in the suit. Governor Brown was then substituted as a defendant.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291. We \"review de novo a district court's order granting a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6),\" <i>Cook v. Brewer,</i> 637 F.3d 1002, 1004 (9th Cir.2011). A denial of Eleventh Amendment immunity is also reviewed de novo. <i>Eason v. Clark Cnty. Sch. Dist.,</i> 303 F.3d 1137, 1140 (9th Cir.2002). We review a district court's decision to dismiss with prejudice for abuse of discretion. <i>Stearns v. Ticketmaster Corp.,</i> 655 F.3d 1013, 1018 (9th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>DISCUSSION</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A.</h2>\n<p>Because our precedent dictates that we resolve an Eleventh Amendment immunity claim before reaching the merits, we first address Yudof's cross-appeal. <i>See </i><i>In re Jackson,</i> 184 F.3d 1046, 1048 (9th Cir.1999). Yudof argues that the district court erred in denying him Eleventh Amendment immunity. We disagree.</p>\n<p>\"The Eleventh Amendment erects a general bar against federal lawsuits brought against a state.\" <i>Porter v.</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1134</span> <i>Jones,</i> 319 F.3d 483, 491 (9th Cir.2003). It does not, however, bar actions for prospective declaratory or injunctive relief against state officers in their official capacities for their alleged violations of federal law. <i>See </i><i>Ex parte Young,</i> 209 U.S. 123, 155-56, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908); <i>Alden v. Maine,</i> 527 U.S. 706, 747, 119 S.Ct. 2240, 144 L.Ed.2d 636 (1999). The individual state official sued \"must have some connection with the enforcement of the act.\" <i>Ex parte Young,</i> 209 U.S. at 157, 28 S.Ct. 441. In addition, that connection \"must be fairly direct; a generalized duty to enforce state law or general supervisory power over the persons responsible for enforcing the challenged provision will not subject an official to suit.\" <i>L.A. Cnty. Bar Ass'n v. Eu,</i> 979 F.2d 697, 704 (9th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p>Relying primarily on <i>Snoeck v. Brussa,</i> 153 F.3d 984 (9th Cir.1998), Yudof contends that the district court improperly denied him Eleventh Amendment immunity. <i>Snoeck</i> held that members of a judicial discipline commission were immune from suit under the Eleventh Amendment because they had no enforcement power over the challenged rule. <i>Id.</i> at 987. The plaintiffs in <i>Snoeck</i> alleged that the commissioners violated their First Amendment rights by prohibiting them from disclosing the facts contained in their complaints against two Nevada judges. <i>Id.</i> at 985. Pursuant to the Nevada Constitution, the Nevada Supreme Court adopted judicial rules that required confidentiality, and that allowed it to hold in contempt those who breached confidentiality. <i>Id.</i> We held that the commissioners were immune from suit because the commission had no power of contempt and could not amend the judicial rules. <i>Id.</i> at 987.</p>\n<p>Analogizing the instant case to <i>Snoeck,</i> Yudof argues that he lacks authority to amend, repeal, deviate from, or enforce section 31. He asserts that he can only comply with section 31, but cannot punish those who do not, just like the commissioners in <i>Snoeck.</i> Without a connection to the enforcement of section 31, he claims he cannot be sued.</p>\n<p>The district court correctly denied Eleventh Amendment immunity pursuant to <i>Eu,</i> 979 F.2d at 704. In <i>Eu,</i> the plaintiff alleged that a statute limiting the number of superior court judges caused delays in civil litigation and deprived litigants of access to the courts. <i>Id.</i> at 699. The governor and secretary of state contended that they lacked a connection with the enforcement of the statute. <i>Id.</i> at 704. This court rejected that argument and held that the officials had a \"fairly direct\" and \"specific connection\" to enforcement of the law because they appointed judges to newly created positions and certified subsequent elections for those positions. <i>Id.</i> The statute was \"being given effect\" by the officials, and therefore the state officials were not immune from suit. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Applying <i>Ex parte Young</i> and <i>Eu,</i> we hold that Yudof is not immune from Plaintiff's suit seeking prospective declaratory and injunctive relief relating to the admission criteria of the university of which he is president. Yudof has a \"fairly direct\" connection, to say the least, to the enforcement of section 31. <i>See </i><i>Eu,</i> 979 F.2d at 704. As the head of the University of California, he does more than just \"live with\" section 31. He enforces it. He is duty-bound to ensure that his employees follow it and refrain from using race as a criterion in admission decisions. Yudof's argument that he is merely \"implementing,\" not \"enforcing\" section 31, minimizes his role as President of the University and is inconsistent with <i>Eu.</i> Lastly, Yudof's reliance on <i>Snoeck</i> is unavailing. Unlike <i>Snoeck,</i> where the Nevada Supreme Court was expressly charged with enforcement, 153 F.3d at 987, section 31 does not designate <i>any</i> entity to commence enforcement <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1135</span> proceedings. At the University of California, the buck stops with Yudof.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B.</h2>\n<p>Turning to the merits, Plaintiffs argue that section 31 is unconstitutional under a \"conventional equal protection analysis\" because it allows admission officials to depart from the University's baseline admission criteria for any purpose veteran status, income, geographical background, athleticism, or legacybut not for \"racial diversity\" or to address \"<i>de facto</i> racial segregation and inequality.\" This, Plaintiffs argue, \"driv[es] down minority admissions\" and treats African American, Latino, and Native American students unequally from their Asian American and white counterparts. Plaintiffs also allege that section 31 is unconstitutional because it created an \"unequal political structure\" that prevents racial minorities from \"using the normal democratic process to seek votes by the [U.C.] Regents to reverse ... [the] ban on affirmative action in admissions.\" While other individuals and groups may petition the U.C. Regents to change the admission policy, African Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans must persuade the electorate to repeal or amend section 31.</p>\n<p>Our prior decision in <i>Wilson II</i> dealt with and rejected both of these arguments. In <i>Wilson II,</i> this court held that, \"[a]s a matter of `conventional' equal protection analysis, there is simply no doubt that Proposition 209 is constitutional.\" 122 F.3d at 701. <i>Wilson II</i> further held that section 31, under a political-structure equal protection analysis, did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment. 122 F.3d at 704-09.</p>\n<p>We are bound by <i>Wilson II. See </i><i>Santamaria v. Horsley,</i> 110 F.3d 1352, 1355 (9th Cir.1997) (\"It is settled law that one three-judge panel of this court cannot ordinarily reconsider or overrule the decision of a prior panel.\"). Pursuant to <i>Wilson II,</i> we affirm the district court's dismissal of Plaintiffs' claims with prejudice. <i>See </i><i>Polich v. Burlington N., Inc.,</i> 942 F.2d 1467, 1472 (9th Cir.1991) (holding that dismissal with prejudice is proper when \"it is clear, upon <i>de novo</i> review, that the complaint could not be saved by any amendment\").</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs argue that <i>Wilson II</i> is inapposite because it was a facial challenge of section 31, whereas Plaintiffs here bring an as-applied constitutional challenge. They assert that the <i>Wilson II</i> court did not contemplate section 31's effects on higher education.</p>\n<p>As the district court noted, however, the <i>Wilson II</i> court considered the very scenario Plaintiffs now allege. In <i>Wilson II,</i> we \"accept[ed] without question[] the district court's findings that [section 31] burdens members of insular minorities ... who otherwise would seek to obtain race-based and gender-based preferential treatment from local entities.\" 122 F.3d at 705. The district court in <i>Wilson I</i> made specific findings regarding the effects section 31 would have on higher education and expressly found that the number of African American and Native American students across the University would fall by as much as 50%. 946 F.Supp. at 1497. This factual finding by the district court is in line with the facts alleged in the complaint. The <i>Wilson II</i> court clearly relied on the district court's findings. <i>See </i><i>Wilson II,</i> 122 F.3d at 698 (\"It further would cause enrollment of African-American, Latino, and American Indian students in public colleges to fall....\"). Thus, Plaintiffs' contention that <i>Wilson II</i> did not address and therefore does not foreclose their as-applied equal protection challenge fails.</p>\n<p>To try to get out from under <i>Wilson II</i>'s binding precedent, Plaintiffs also argue that <i>Wilson II</i> is irreconcilable with <i>Grutter v. Bollinger,</i> 539 U.S. 306, 325, 123 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1136</span> S.Ct. 2325, 156 L.Ed.2d 304 (2003), which held that student body diversity is a compelling state interest and that the Constitution permits narrowly tailored race-based admission policies. <i>Wilson II</i> and <i>Grutter,</i> however, are easily reconciled.</p>\n<p><i>Grutter</i> upheld as <i>permissible</i> certain race-based affirmative action programs. <i>Id.</i> It did not hold that such programs are constitutionally <i>required. See </i><i>Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action v. Granholm,</i> 473 F.3d 237, 249 (6th Cir.2006) (\"<i>Grutter</i> never said, or even hinted, that state universities <i>must</i> do what they narrowly <i>may</i> do.\").<sup>[1]</sup> Furthermore, as the district court pointed out,</p>\n<blockquote>[In <i>Grutter,</i>] the Supreme Court cited the \"race-neutral alternatives\" to racial preferences used by \"Universities in California, Florida, and Washington State, where racial preferences are prohibited by state law.\" [539 U.S. at 342, 123 S.Ct. 2325.] The Court suggested that California and other states were \"laboratories\" experimenting with alternatives to racial preferences, writing: \"Universities in other States can and should draw on the most promising aspects of these race-neutral alternatives as they develop.\" <i>Id.</i> This discussion refutes Plaintiffs' contention that the Supreme Court intended <i>Grutter</i> to overrule <i>Wilson</i> [<i>II</i>].</blockquote>\n<p>Because <i>Grutter</i> spoke only to whether race-based affirmative action programs are permitted, and not to whether they can be prohibited as was the case in <i>Wilson II,</i> it is impossible to hold that <i>Grutter</i> overrules <i>Wilson II.</i></p>\n<p>The bottom line is that <i>Wilson II</i> remains the law of the circuit, and the district court faithfully applied it.</p>\n<p>The district court's order dismissing the complaint is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p>TASHIMA, Circuit Judge, specially concurring in part and dissenting in part:</p>\n<p>Judge Silverman is, of course, entirely correct that Plaintiffs' challenge to Proposition 209 is foreclosed by <i>Coalition for Economic Equity v. Wilson,</i> 122 F.3d 692 (9th Cir.1997) (\"<i>Wilson II</i>\"). I continue to believe now, as I did when the case was decided, that <i>Wilson II</i> was wrongly decided. <i>See </i><i>Wilson II,</i> 122 F.3d at 711-12(Schroeder, J., dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc); <i>id.</i> at 712-18(Norris, J., respecting the denial of rehearing en banc). Because, however, <i>Wilson II</i> remains the law of the circuit and, as Judge Silverman states, \"[w]e are bound by <i>Wilson II,</i>\" I concur in Part III.B. of the majority opinion.</p>\n<p>Part III.A is a different matter. I disagree with the majority's conclusion that the district court correctly denied Eleventh Amendment immunity to defendant Mark Yudof, as President of the University of California. Maj. Op. at 1134-35. I therefore dissent from Part III.A.</p>\n<p>The majority relies on <i>L.A. Cnty. Bar Ass'n v. Eu,</i> 979 F.2d 697 (9th Cir.1992), to hold that because Yudof has a \"fairly direct connection\" with enforcement of § 31,<sup>[1]</sup> he therefore is not immune from suit pursuant to <i>Ex parte Young. Id.</i> at 704 (citing <i>Ex parte Young,</i> 209 U.S. 123, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1137</span> 157, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908)). But with regard to Yudof's claim of Eleventh Amendment immunity, this case is more like <i>Snoeck v. Brussa,</i> 153 F.3d 984(9th Cir.1998), than <i>Eu.</i> In <i>Eu,</i> we addressed a statute that was \"simply not the type that gives rise to enforcement proceedings.\" <i>Id.</i> In contrast, and contrary to the majority's assertion, the law does provide for § 31 enforcement proceedings. <i>Cf. </i><i>Snoeck,</i> 153 F.3d at 987. Although § 31 itself does not designate a specific state entity to commence proceedings, other provisions of the California Constitution expressly charge the Governor and the Attorney General with the duty and authority to enforce the law.<sup>[2]</sup> Cal. Const. art. V, §§ 1, 13. Those State executive officers, not Yudof, are the state officials responsible for enforcement of § 31. <i>See </i><i>Coal. for Econ. Equity v. Wilson,</i> 946 F.Supp. 1480, 1492 (N.D.Cal.1996).</p>\n<p>In <i>Snoeck,</i> we held that the Eleventh Amendment barred suit against members of the Nevada Commission on Judicial Discipline who lacked authority to enforce the challenged rules through the exercise of contempt power or disciplinary authority. 153 F.3d at 987. We held that it was \"only collateral, and of no consequence\" that Commission members applied the rules and engaged in \"ministerial, administrative practices designed to remind citizens of their duties under the rules.\" <i>Id.</i> Like the Commission members in <i>Snoeck,</i> Yudof lacks the authority to execute enforcement proceedings; his statutory duty is not to punish violations of the law, but to \"accept and apply [the law] ... however much [he] might disagree with [it].\" <i>Id.</i> Although Yudof must implement § 31 like any other state law applicable to the University in the course of carrying out his duties as President, <i>Snoeck</i> holds that such \"general administrative responsibilities\" do not establish the direct connection with enforcement of the statute required by <i>Ex parte Young. Id.</i></p>\n<p>Because <i>Snoeck</i> is binding, I would hold that the district court erred in denying Yudof immunity. Unable to distinguish <i>Snoeck,</i> in the end the majority simply relies on the conclusory statement that \"[a]t the University, the buck stops with Yudof.\" Maj. Op. at 1135. But that assertion is mistaken as a matter of California law, under which The Regents of the University of California administer the University and are granted the \"full powers of organization and government\" to do so. <i>See</i> Cal. Const. art. IX, § 9. <i>See also, e.g., </i><i>Campbell v. Regents of the Univ. of Calif.,</i> 35 Cal.4th 311, 25 Cal.Rptr.3d 320, 106 P.3d 976 (2005) (noting that the Regents \"as a constitutionally created arm of the state have virtual autonomy in self-governance\" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). Recognizing this, the district court granted the Regents' motion to dismiss on Eleventh Amendment immunity grounds, which dismissal has not been appealed. It is a mystery to me then, why the Regentswhere the buck does stop are entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity, but its subordinate officer, the President of the University, is not.</p>\n<p>As should be evident, I have never agreed with <i>Snoeck</i>'s holding or the rationale on which it is based. <i>See </i><i>Snoeck,</i> 153 F.3d at 988-91 (Tashima, J., dissenting). Still, it remains the law of the circuit and this three-judge panel should give it the respect it is due. Because I conclude that <i>Snoeck,</i> rather than <i>Eu,</i> controls this case, I would reverse the district court's denial <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1138</span> of Eleventh Amendment immunity to defendant Yudof. I therefore respectfully dissent from Part III.A of the majority opinion.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  The Honorable Marvin J.

SILVERMAN, Circuit Judges, and MARVIN J. GARBIS, Senior District Judge.<sup>[*]</sup></p>\n<p>Opinion by Judge SILVERMAN; Partial Concurrence and Partial Dissent by Judge TASHIMA.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>OPINION</h2>\n<p>SILVERMAN, Circuit Judge:</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs are California high school and college students who allege that section 31 of article I of the California Constitution violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and causes the unfair exclusion of African American, Latino, and Native American students from higher education. They seek to enjoin Governor Edmund G. Brown and Mark Yudof, President of the University of California, from enforcing section 31. Yudof asserts that he is immune from suit under the Eleventh Amendment and that he is an improper defendant pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 21. Although we hold that Plaintiffs' suit against Yudof is not barred by Eleventh Amendment immunity, we also hold that Plaintiffs' equal protection challenge to section 31 is precluded by <i>Coalition for Economic Equity v. Wilson (Wilson II),</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"744846\"><a href=\"/opinion/744846/the-coalition-for-economic-equity-california-naacp-northern-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">692</span></a></span> (9th Cir.1997), where we previously upheld the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1132</span> constitutionality of section 31. The district court correctly dismissed the complaint against the governor and Yudof for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The University of California is a public university system governed by the Regents of the University of California (\"U.C. Regents\"), a board with \"full powers of organization and government,\" including the authority to set the University's admission policy. Cal. Const. art. IX, § 9. Plaintiffs allege that, as a result of the civil rights movement, the U.C. Regents adopted affirmative action programs to increase the number of African American, Latino, and Native American students. The programs were effective in rapidly and significantly increasing the number of underrepresented minorities.</p>\n<p>In November 1996, Californian voters adopted Proposition 209, which amended the California Constitution to provide:</p>\n<blockquote>(a) The state shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public employment, public education, or public contracting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(f) For the purposes of this section, \"state\" shall include, but not necessarily be limited to, the state itself, any city, county, city and county, public university system, including the University of California, community college district, school district, special district, or any other political subdivision or governmental instrumentality of or within the state.</blockquote>\n<p>Cal. Const. art. I, § 31.</p>\n<p>Several individuals and groups immediately brought suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against state officials and political subdivisions of the state, alleging, inter alia, that section 31 violated the Equal Protection Clause. <i>See </i><i>Coal. for Econ. Equity v. Wilson (Wilson I),</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">946</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1480</span></span>, 1488-90 (N.D.Cal.1996). The district court in <i>Wilson I</i> granted the requested relief by the plaintiffs, holding that section 31 was likely unconstitutional and granting a preliminary injunction enjoining its enforcement. <i>Id.</i> at 1520.</p>\n<p>On appeal, we vacated the preliminary injunction and remanded the matter because the plaintiffs had shown no likelihood of success on the merits of their claims. <i>Wilson II,</i> 122 F.3d at 710-11. In so doing, we rejected the plaintiffs' equal protection claim under both a conventional equal protection analysis and a political-structure equal protection analysis. <i>Id.</i> at 701-09. Under a conventional analysis, the court \"focuses on whether the government has classified individuals on the basis of impermissible criteria.\" <i>Valeria v. Davis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"779522\"><a href=\"/opinion/779522/g-valeria-through-her-parent-and-next-friend-g-yolanda-rosalinda-o/\"><span class=\"volume\">307</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1036</span></a></span>, 1039 (9th Cir.2002). We held in <i>Wilson II</i> that section 31 is constitutional under a conventional equal protection analysis because it \"prohibits the State from classifying individuals by race or gender\" and, therefore, it \"<i>a fortiori</i> does not classify individuals\" impermissibly. 122 F.3d at 702. Under a political-structure analysis, the question is whether a state action creates \"a political structure that treats all individuals as equals ... [but] place[s] special burdens on the ability of minority groups to achieve beneficial legislation.\" <i>Washington v. Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110784\"><a href=\"/opinion/110784/washington-v-seattle-school-dist-no-1/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">457</span></a></span>, 467, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110784\"><a href=\"/opinion/110784/washington-v-seattle-school-dist-no-1/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">3187</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110784\"><a href=\"/opinion/110784/washington-v-seattle-school-dist-no-1/\"><span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">896</span></a></span> (1982) (citation and quotation marks omitted). Applying this analysis, we determined that section 31 was constitutional because the law \"addresse[d] in neutral-fashion race-related and gender-related matters.\" 122 F.3d at 707. Section 31 prohibited preferential treatment, we held, not \"equal protection <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1133</span> rights against political obstructions to equal treatment.\" <i>Id.</i> at 708.</p>\n<p>After section 31 became law, the University ceased considering race or sex in student admissions. The year after section 31 passed, the number of African American, Latino, and Native American freshmen at UCLA and U.C. Berkeley dropped by over 50%. The U.C. Regents have attempted to mitigate the drop in underrepresented minorities by adopting a \"comprehensive review\" of applicants, utilizing different standardized tests, admitting the top 4% of graduates from any high school, and decreasing the weight of standardized tests. It is alleged that these measures have had only a minor impact on the number of underrepresented minority students.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs initiated the instant putative class action to once again challenge the constitutionality of section 31 under conventional and political-structure equal protection analyses. Defendants U.C. Regents, then-Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Yudof moved to dismiss the complaint, asserting (along with other defenses) that they were immune from suit under the Eleventh Amendment and that they were not proper defendants. Former U.C. Regent Ward Connerly, the American Civil Rights Foundation, and the California Association of Scholars then moved to intervene as defendants and filed a motion to dismiss the complaint under Rule 12(b)(6).</p>\n<p>The district court allowed Connerly and the American Civil Rights Foundation to intervene. The court dismissed the U.C. Regents on sovereign immunity grounds, which Plaintiffs have not appealed. The district court then denied the motions to dismiss by former Governor Schwarzenegger and Yudof. The court ruled that the governor and Yudof were not immune from suit and were proper defendants because they were sufficiently connected to the enforcement of section 31 through their respective roles as President of the U.C. Regents and President of the University. In a separate order, the district court dismissed with prejudice both of Plaintiffs' claims, holding that it was bound by <i>Wilson II</i> to uphold the constitutionality of section 31.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs appeal the dismissal of their claims, and Yudof cross-appeals the district court's decision to deny him state immunity and to keep him in the suit. Governor Brown was then substituted as a defendant.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291. We \"review de novo a district court's order granting a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6),\" <i>Cook v. Brewer,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"212527\"><a href=\"/opinion/212527/cook-v-brewer/\"><span class=\"volume\">637</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1002</span></a></span>, 1004 (9th Cir.2011). A denial of Eleventh Amendment immunity is also reviewed de novo. <i>Eason v. Clark Cnty. Sch.

Brussa,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"757523\"><a href=\"/opinion/757523/98-cal-daily-op-serv-6659-98-daily-journal-dar-9265-arthur-snoeck/\"><span class=\"volume\">153</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">984</span></a></span> (9th Cir.1998), Yudof contends that the district court improperly denied him Eleventh Amendment immunity. <i>Snoeck</i> held that members of a judicial discipline commission were immune from suit under the Eleventh Amendment because they had no enforcement power over the challenged rule. <i>Id.</i> at 987. The plaintiffs in <i>Snoeck</i> alleged that the commissioners violated their First Amendment rights by prohibiting them from disclosing the facts contained in their complaints against two Nevada judges. <i>Id.</i> at 985. Pursuant to the Nevada Constitution, the Nevada Supreme Court adopted judicial rules that required confidentiality, and that allowed it to hold in contempt those who breached confidentiality. <i>Id.</i> We held that the commissioners were immune from suit because the commission had no power of contempt and could not amend the judicial rules. <i>Id.</i> at 987.</p>\n<p>Analogizing the instant case to <i>Snoeck,</i> Yudof argues that he lacks authority to amend, repeal, deviate from, or enforce section 31. He asserts that he can only comply with section 31, but cannot punish those who do not, just like the commissioners in <i>Snoeck.</i> Without a connection to the enforcement of section 31, he claims he cannot be sued.</p>\n<p>The district court correctly denied Eleventh Amendment immunity pursuant to <i>Eu,</i> 979 F.2d at 704. In <i>Eu,</i> the plaintiff alleged that a statute limiting the number of superior court judges caused delays in civil litigation and deprived litigants of access to the courts. <i>Id.</i> at 699. The governor and secretary of state contended that they lacked a connection with the enforcement of the statute. <i>Id.</i> at 704. This court rejected that argument and held that the officials had a \"fairly direct\" and \"specific connection\" to enforcement of the law because they appointed judges to newly created positions and certified subsequent elections for those positions. <i>Id.</i> The statute was \"being given effect\" by the officials, and therefore the state officials were not immune from suit. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Applying <i>Ex parte Young</i> and <i>Eu,</i> we hold that Yudof is not immune from Plaintiff's suit seeking prospective declaratory and injunctive relief relating to the admission criteria of the university of which he is president. Yudof has a \"fairly direct\" connection, to say the least, to the enforcement of section 31. <i>See </i><i>Eu,</i> 979 F.2d at 704. As the head of the University of California, he does more than just \"live with\" section 31. He enforces it. He is duty-bound to ensure that his employees follow it and refrain from using race as a criterion in admission decisions. Yudof's argument that he is merely \"implementing,\" not \"enforcing\" section 31, minimizes his role as President of the University and is inconsistent with <i>Eu.</i> Lastly, Yudof's reliance on <i>Snoeck</i> is unavailing. Unlike <i>Snoeck,</i> where the Nevada Supreme Court was expressly charged with enforcement, 153 F.3d at 987, section 31 does not designate <i>any</i> entity to commence enforcement <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1135</span> proceedings. At the University of California, the buck stops with Yudof.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B.</h2>\n<p>Turning to the merits, Plaintiffs argue that section 31 is unconstitutional under a \"conventional equal protection analysis\" because it allows admission officials to depart from the University's baseline admission criteria for any purpose veteran status, income, geographical background, athleticism, or legacybut not for \"racial diversity\" or to address \"<i>de facto</i> racial segregation and inequality.\" This, Plaintiffs argue, \"driv[es] down minority admissions\" and treats African American, Latino, and Native American students unequally from their Asian American and white counterparts. Plaintiffs also allege that section 31 is unconstitutional because it created an \"unequal political structure\" that prevents racial minorities from \"using the normal democratic process to seek votes by the [U.C.] Regents to reverse ... [the] ban on affirmative action in admissions.\" While other individuals and groups may petition the U.C. Regents to change the admission policy, African Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans must persuade the electorate to repeal or amend section 31.</p>\n<p>Our prior decision in <i>Wilson II</i> dealt with and rejected both of these arguments. In <i>Wilson II,</i> this court held that, \"[a]s a matter of `conventional' equal protection analysis, there is simply no doubt that Proposition 209 is constitutional.\" 122 F.3d at 701. <i>Wilson II</i> further held that section 31, under a political-structure equal protection analysis, did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment. 122 F.3d at 704-09.</p>\n<p>We are bound by <i>Wilson II. See </i><i>Santamaria v. Horsley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"739336\"><a href=\"/opinion/739336/97-cal-daily-op-serv-2641-97-daily-journal-dar-4633-jose-napolean/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1352</span></a></span>, 1355 (9th Cir.1997) (\"It is settled law that one three-judge panel of this court cannot ordinarily reconsider or overrule the decision of a prior panel.\"). Pursuant to <i>Wilson II,</i> we affirm the district court's dismissal of Plaintiffs' claims with prejudice. <i>See </i><i>Polich v. Burlington N., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"567273\"><a href=\"/opinion/567273/victor-j-polich-v-burlington-northern-inc-burlington-northern-railroad/\"><span class=\"volume\">942</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1467</span></a></span>, 1472 (9th Cir.1991) (holding that dismissal with prejudice is proper when \"it is clear, upon <i>de novo</i> review, that the complaint could not be saved by any amendment\").</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs argue that <i>Wilson II</i> is inapposite because it was a facial challenge of section 31, whereas Plaintiffs here bring an as-applied constitutional challenge. They assert that the <i>Wilson II</i> court did not contemplate section 31's effects on higher education.</p>\n<p>As the district court noted, however, the <i>Wilson II</i> court considered the very scenario Plaintiffs now allege. In <i>Wilson II,</i> we \"accept[ed] without question[] the district court's findings that [section 31] burdens members of insular minorities ... who otherwise would seek to obtain race-based and gender-based preferential treatment from local entities.\" 122 F.3d at 705. The district court in <i>Wilson I</i> made specific findings regarding the effects section 31 would have on higher education and expressly found that the number of African American and Native American students across the University would fall by as much as 50%. 946 F.Supp. at 1497. This factual finding by the district court is in line with the facts alleged in the complaint. The <i>Wilson II</i> court clearly relied on the district court's findings. <i>See </i><i>Wilson II,</i> 122 F.3d at 698 (\"It further would cause enrollment of African-American, Latino, and American Indian students in public colleges to fall....\"). Thus, Plaintiffs' contention that <i>Wilson II</i> did not address and therefore does not foreclose their as-applied equal protection challenge fails.</p>\n<p>To try to get out from under <i>Wilson II</i>'s binding precedent, Plaintiffs also argue that <i>Wilson II</i> is irreconcilable with <i>Grutter v. Bollinger,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130155\"><a href=\"/opinion/130155/grutter-v-bollinger/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">306</span></a></span>, 325, 123 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1136</span> S.Ct. 2325, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130155\"><a href=\"/opinion/130155/grutter-v-bollinger/\"><span class=\"volume\">156</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">304</span></a></span> (2003), which held that student body diversity is a compelling state interest and that the Constitution permits narrowly tailored race-based admission policies. <i>Wilson II</i> and <i>Grutter,</i> however, are easily reconciled.</p>\n<p><i>Grutter</i> upheld as <i>permissible</i> certain race-based affirmative action programs. <i>Id.</i> It did not hold that such programs are constitutionally <i>required. See </i><i>Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action v. Granholm,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"796435\"><a href=\"/opinion/796435/coalition-to-defend-affirmative-action-v-jennifer-granholm-michael-cox/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">237</span></a></span>, 249 (6th Cir.2006) (\"<i>Grutter</i> never said, or even hinted, that state universities <i>must</i> do what they narrowly <i>may</i> do.\").<sup>[1]</sup> Furthermore, as the district court pointed out,</p>\n<blockquote>[In <i>Grutter,</i>] the Supreme Court cited the \"race-neutral alternatives\" to racial preferences used by \"Universities in California, Florida, and Washington State, where racial preferences are prohibited by state law.\" [539 U.S. at 342, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130155\"><a href=\"/opinion/130155/grutter-v-bollinger/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2325</span></a></span>.] The Court suggested that California and other states were \"laboratories\" experimenting with alternatives to racial preferences, writing: \"Universities in other States can and should draw on the most promising aspects of these race-neutral alternatives as they develop.\" <i>Id.</i> This discussion refutes Plaintiffs' contention that the Supreme Court intended <i>Grutter</i> to overrule <i>Wilson</i> [<i>II</i>].</blockquote>\n<p>Because <i>Grutter</i> spoke only to whether race-based affirmative action programs are permitted, and not to whether they can be prohibited as was the case in <i>Wilson II,</i> it is impossible to hold that <i>Grutter</i> overrules <i>Wilson II.</i></p>\n<p>The bottom line is that <i>Wilson II</i> remains the law of the circuit, and the district court faithfully applied it.</p>\n<p>The district court's order dismissing the complaint is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p>TASHIMA, Circuit Judge, specially concurring in part and dissenting in part:</p>\n<p>Judge Silverman is, of course, entirely correct that Plaintiffs' challenge to Proposition 209 is foreclosed by <i>Coalition for Economic Equity v. Wilson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"744846\"><a href=\"/opinion/744846/the-coalition-for-economic-equity-california-naacp-northern-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">692</span></a></span> (9th Cir.1997) (\"<i>Wilson II</i>\"). I continue to believe now, as I did when the case was decided, that <i>Wilson II</i> was wrongly decided. <i>See </i><i>Wilson II,</i> 122 F.3d at 711-12(Schroeder, J., dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc); <i>id.</i> at 712-18(Norris, J., respecting the denial of rehearing en banc). Because, however, <i>Wilson II</i> remains the law of the circuit and, as Judge Silverman states, \"[w]e are bound by <i>Wilson II,</i>\" I concur in Part III.B. of the majority opinion.</p>\n<p>Part III.A is a different matter. I disagree with the majority's conclusion that the district court correctly denied Eleventh Amendment immunity to defendant Mark Yudof, as President of the University of California. Maj. Op. at 1134-35. I therefore dissent from Part III.A.</p>\n<p>The majority relies on <i>L.A. Cnty. Bar Ass'n v. Eu,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"594763\"><a href=\"/opinion/594763/los-angeles-county-bar-association-a-non-profit-mutual-benefit-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">979</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">697</span></a></span> (9th Cir.1992), to hold that because Yudof has a \"fairly direct connection\" with enforcement of § 31,<sup>[1]</sup> he therefore is not immune from suit pursuant to <i>Ex parte Young. Id.</i> at 704 (citing <i>Ex parte Young,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"96819\"><a href=\"/opinion/96819/ex-parte-young/\"><span class=\"volume\">209</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">123</span></a></span>, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1137</span> 157, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"96819\"><a href=\"/opinion/96819/ex-parte-young/\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">714</span></a></span> (1908)). But with regard to Yudof's claim of Eleventh Amendment immunity, this case is more like <i>Snoeck v. Brussa,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"757523\"><a href=\"/opinion/757523/98-cal-daily-op-serv-6659-98-daily-journal-dar-9265-arthur-snoeck/\"><span class=\"volume\">153</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">984</span></a></span>(9th Cir.1998), than <i>Eu.</i> In <i>Eu,</i> we addressed a statute that was \"simply not the type that gives rise to enforcement proceedings.\" <i>Id.</i> In contrast, and contrary to the majority's assertion, the law does provide for § 31 enforcement proceedings. <i>Cf. </i><i>Snoeck,</i> 153 F.3d at 987. Although § 31 itself does not designate a specific state entity to commence proceedings, other provisions of the California Constitution expressly charge the Governor and the Attorney General with the duty and authority to enforce the law.<sup>[2]</sup> Cal. Const. art. V, §§ 1, 13. Those State executive officers, not Yudof, are the state officials responsible for enforcement of § 31. <i>See </i><i>Coal. for Econ. Equity v. Wilson,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">946</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1480</span></span>, 1492 (N.D.Cal.1996).</p>\n<p>In <i>Snoeck,</i> we held that the Eleventh Amendment barred suit against members of the Nevada Commission on Judicial Discipline who lacked authority to enforce the challenged rules through the exercise of contempt power or disciplinary authority. 153 F.3d at 987. We held that it was \"only collateral, and of no consequence\" that Commission members applied the rules and engaged in \"ministerial, administrative practices designed to remind citizens of their duties under the rules.\" <i>Id.</i> Like the Commission members in <i>Snoeck,</i> Yudof lacks the authority to execute enforcement proceedings; his statutory duty is not to punish violations of the law, but to \"accept and apply [the law] ... however much [he] might disagree with [it].\" <i>Id.</i> Although Yudof must implement § 31 like any other state law applicable to the University in the course of carrying out his duties as President, <i>Snoeck</i> holds that such \"general administrative responsibilities\" do not establish the direct connection with enforcement of the statute required by <i>Ex parte Young. Id.</i></p>\n<p>Because <i>Snoeck</i> is binding, I would hold that the district court erred in denying Yudof immunity. Unable to distinguish <i>Snoeck,</i> in the end the majority simply relies on the conclusory statement that \"[a]t the University, the buck stops with Yudof.\" Maj. Op. at 1135. But that assertion is mistaken as a matter of California law, under which The Regents of the University of California administer the University and are granted the \"full powers of organization and government\" to do so. <i>See</i> Cal. Const. art. IX, § 9. <i>See also, e.g., </i><i>Campbell v. Regents of the Univ. of Calif.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2508480\"><a href=\"/opinion/2508480/campbell-v-regents-of-univ-of-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">35</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">311</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2508480\"><a href=\"/opinion/2508480/campbell-v-regents-of-univ-of-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Recognizing this, the district court granted the Regents' motion to dismiss on Eleventh Amendment immunity grounds, which dismissal has not been appealed. It is a mystery to me then, why the Regentswhere the buck does stop are entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity, but its subordinate officer, the President of the University, is not.</p>\n<p>As should be evident, I have never agreed with <i>Snoeck</i>'s holding or the rationale on which it is based. <i>See </i><i>Snoeck,</i> 153 F.3d at 988-91 (Tashima, J., dissenting). Still, it remains the law of the circuit and this three-judge panel should give it the respect it is due. Because I conclude that <i>Snoeck,</i> rather than <i>Eu,</i> controls this case, I would reverse the district court's denial <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1138</span> of Eleventh Amendment immunity to defendant Yudof. I therefore respectfully dissent from Part III.A of the majority opinion.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  The Honorable Marvin J.
