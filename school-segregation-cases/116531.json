(“DCHRA”). (See Complaint, May 15, 2012 [Dkt. No.1]\n\n(“Compl.”).) Defendant has moved to dismiss plaintiff’s claims pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n12(b)(6).

Wolff instead attended the tour with a friend who provided interpretation. (Compl.\n\n¶ 9.) Wolff told the school that she would like to enroll at the Aveda Institute and asked the\n\nschool to provide interpreter services for classes. (Compl. ¶ 10.) On January 18, 2012, Wolff\n\nreceived an email from Anna Kiesnowski, Director of the Aveda Institute DC, stating in relevant\n\npart:\n\n         I am writing you today to discuss your inquiry for future enrollment at our\n         campus for Cosmetology. Unfortunately, we are unable to provide an interpreter\n         due to the great expenses it would require of our Institute and company. We are\n         only able to provide reasonable accommodations, but we would hope that you\n         will still be able to find accommodations to join our Cosmetology class in March.\n\n(Defendant Beauty Basics, Inc.’s Errata to Motion to Dismiss, July 19, 2012 [Dkt. No. 8], Ex. A\n(Jan. 18, 2012 Email from Anna Kiesnowski to Debra Wolff) (“Kiesnowski Email”); see Compl.\n¶ 10.)\n         On May 15, 2012, Wolff filed suit, alleging discrimination on the basis of disability\n\nunder the ADA, Section 504, and the DCHRA and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and\n\ncompensatory damages.\n\n                                                 ANALYSIS\nI.       STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n         A complaint need only contain “‘a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the\n\npleader is entitled to relief,’” Bell Atlantic Corporation v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007)\n\n(quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)), “in order to ‘give the defendant fair notice of what the . . . claim is\n\n                                                   2\n\fand the grounds upon which it rests.’” Id. (alteration in the original) (quoting Conley v. Gibson,\n\n355 U.S. 41, 47 (1957)). The notice pleading rules are “not meant to impose a great burden on a\n\nplaintiff,” Dura Pharmaceuticals, Incorporated v. Broudo, 544 U.S. 336, 347 (2005) (citing\n\nSwierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A., 534 U.S. 506, 513–515 (2002)), and “detailed factual allegations”\n\nare not necessary to withstand a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555. Nor is it\n\nnecessary for a plaintiff alleging discrimination to “plead every fact necessary to establish a\n\nprima facie case.” Jones v. Air Line Pilots Ass’n, Int'l, 642 F.3d 1100, 1104 (D.C. Cir. 2011)\n\n(citing Swierkiewicz, 534 U.S. at 511). Nevertheless, a plaintiff must furnish “more than labels\n\nand conclusions” or “a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action,” id. at 555, and\n\nhis “complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief\n\nthat is plausible on its face.’” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1949 (2009) (quoting Twombly,\n\n550 U.S. at 570). “A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that\n\nallows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct\n\nalleged.” Id. (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556). “The plausibility standard is not akin to a\n\n‘probability requirement,’ but it asks for more than a sheer possibility that defendant has acted\n\nunlawfully.” Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556. In determining whether the factual allegations which\n\nare entitled to an assumption of truth in Wolff’s complaint are “enough to raise a right to relief\n\nabove the speculative level,” id. at 555, the Court must grant Wolff “‘the benefit of all inferences\n\nthat can be derived from the facts alleged.’” Am. Nat’l Ins. Co. v. F.D.I.C., 642 F.3d 1137, 1139\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2011) (quoting Thomas v. Principi, 394 F.3d 970, 972 (D.C. Cir. 2005)).\n\nII.    THE SUFFICIENCY OF WOLFF’S CLAIMS\n\n       Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) provides that:\n\n       No individual shall be discriminated against on the basis of disability in the full and equal\n       enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of\n\n                                                  3\n\f       any place of public accommodation by any person who owns, leases (or leases to), or\n       operates a place of public accommodation.\n\n41 U.S.C. § 12182(a). It further provides that:\n\n       It shall be discriminatory to subject an individual . . . on the basis of a disability . . . to a\n       denial of the opportunity of the individual . . . to participate in or benefit from the goods,\n       services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of an entity.\n\n41 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(1)(A).\n\n       The ADA specifies that, in interpreting the general rule, discrimination includes such\n\nthings as “the imposition or application of eligibility criteria that screen out or tend to screen out\n\nan individual with a disability . . . from fully and equally enjoying any goods, services, facilities,\n\nprivileges, advantages, or accommodations, unless such criteria can be shown to be necessary for\n\nthe provision of” those things,” id. § 12182(b)(2)(A)(i); “a failure to make reasonable\n\nmodifications in policies, practices, or procedures, when such modifications are necessary to\n\nafford such goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations to individuals\n\nwith disabilities, unless the entity can demonstrate that making such modifications would\n\nfundamentally alter the nature of” those things, id. § 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii); and “a failure to take\n\nsuch steps as may be necessary to ensure that no individual with a disability is excluded, denied\n\nservices, segregated or otherwise treated differently than other individuals because of the\n\nabsence of auxiliary aids and services, unless the entity can demonstrate that taking such steps\n\nwould fundamentally alter the nature of the good, service, facility, privilege, advantage, or\n\naccommodation being offered or would result in an undue burden.” Id. § 12182(b)(2)(A)(iii).\n\n       Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act is similar to the ADA. It provides that:\n\n       No otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United States . . . shall, solely\n       by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the\n       benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving\n       Federal financial assistance.\n\n\n\n                                                   4\n\f29 U.S.C. § 794(a).\n\n       Finally, the DCHRA, in relevant part, provides:\n\n       It is an unlawful discriminatory practice . . . for an educational institution to deny,\n       restrict, or to abridge or condition the use of, or access to, any of its facilities, services,\n       programs, or benefits of any program or activity to any person otherwise qualified,\n       wholly or partially, for a discriminatory reason, based upon the . . . disability of any\n       individual.\n\nD.C. Code § 2-1402.41.\n\n       Defendant does not dispute that it is subject to the ADA, Section 504, and the DCHRA,\n\nnor does it dispute that Wolff is a disabled individual for purposes of the statutes. Rather,\n\ndefendant asserts that plaintiff has failed to state a claim because (1) “she has not established that\n\nshe is otherwise qualified for” the Aveda program or that she was excluded based on a\n\ndisability,” and (2) because she has not demonstrated that she was excluded from participation\n\nin, denied the benefits of, or subjected to discrimination under defendant’s beauty-school\n\nprogram because she never submitted a formal application, but instead only made inquiries with\n\na view toward future enrollment. (See Def. Mot. at 4–9). The Court disagrees, and concludes\n\nthat Wolff’s claims suffice to withstand defendant’s Rule 12(b)(6) motion.\n\n       In order to prevail on her claims, Wolff must show, inter alia, that (1) she has a\n\ndisability, (2) she was excluded from the Aveda Institute program because of the disability, and\n\n(2) she is otherwise qualified to be admitted to the program. See Steere v. George Washington\n\nUniv., 368 F. Supp. 52, 55 (D.D.C. 2005) (ADA analysis); Equal Rights Ctr. v. Dist. of\n\nColumbia, 741 F. Supp. 2d 273, 283 n.6 (D.D.C. 2010) (cases interpreting the ADA, Section\n\n504, and DCHRA are interchangeable for certain purposes).\n\n       Notwithstanding that she does not have to plead every fact necessary to establish a prima\n\nfacie case in order to withstand a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, see Jones, 642 F.3d at 1104,\n\n\n\n                                                   5\n\fWolff has pleaded the necessary facts here. Her claim is “facially plausible” in that, assuming\n\nthe truth of all the facts alleged in the complaint, the complaint pleads factual content that\n\npermits a claim of disability discrimination. It is undisputed that she has alleged that she is\n\ndisabled, that defendant is subject to the ADA, Section 504, and the DCHRA, and that, when she\n\nrequested an auxiliary service (interpretation) that she required, defendants declined to provide\n\nher with it.\n\n        As to the “otherwise qualified” prong of Wolff’s prima facie case, the Court, at the\n\npleading stage, will draw the reasonable inference from the facts alleged that Wolff is qualified\n\nto attend a cosmetology program. The email that Wolff received from Kiesnowski—stating that\n\nthe Aveda Institute “[is] only able to provide reasonable accommodations, but we would hope\n\nthat you will still be able to find accommodations to join our Cosmetology class in March”\n\n(Kiesnowski Email)—demonstrates that the lack of available accommodations was the only\n\nbarrier to her enrollment at the Aveda Institute.\n\n        Defendant’s claim that the complaint is legally insufficient as to Wolff’s ADA claim\n\nbecause “plaintiff . . . has not demonstrated that she . . . was excluded from participation”\n\nbecause she never submitted a formal application (see Def. Mot. at 9) is similarly unpersuasive.\n\nDefendant told Wolff that it did not intend to provide her with the accommodation she requested,\n\nand the “futile gesture” principle makes clear that this is sufficient to state a claim if she was\n\neffectively excluded from participation. 42 U.S.C. § 12188(a)(1) (“Nothing in this section shall\n\nrequire a person with a disability to engage in a futile gesture if such person has actual notice that\n\na person or organization covered by this subchapter does not intend to comply with its\n\nprovisions”); see Equal Rights Ctr. v. Hilton Hotels Corp., No. 07–cv–1528, 2009 WL 6067336,\n\nat *3 (D.D.C. Mar. 25, 2009) (in the ADA Title III context, “disabled individuals do not have to\n\n\n\n                                                    6\n\fclaim that they would return to a place with known accessibility barriers simply to establish that\n\nthey are likely to experience a future violation of their rights”; rather, a “plaintiff must simply\n\nallege that she has ‘become aware of discriminatory conditions existing at a public\n\naccommodation, and is thereby deterred from visiting or patronizing that accommodation’”\n\n(quoting Pickern v. Holiday Quality Foods, Inc., 293 F.3d 1133, 1136–37 (9th Cir. 2002))).\n\n       Finally, with regard to the DCHRA, that law bars as “an unlawful discriminatory\n\npractice” any educational institution from not only “deny[ing] . . . the use of, or access to, any of\n\nits . . . programs” based upon disability, but also on “abridg[ing] or condition[ing]” such use or\n\naccess based upon disability. D.C. Code § 2-1402.41. Wolff has sufficiently alleged that the\n\nAveda Institute conditioned Wolff’s ability to participate in the program on her ability to find her\n\nown ASL interpreter.\n\n                                          CONCLUSION\n \n       For the reasons set forth above, the Court will deny defendant’s motion to dismiss. A\n\nseparate Order accompanies this Memorandum Opinion.\n\n                                                                    /s/\n                                                       ELLEN SEGAL HUVELLE\n                                                       United States District Judge\n\nDate: August 24, 2012\n\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\f",

Cir. 2005)).\n\nII.    THE SUFFICIENCY OF WOLFF’S CLAIMS\n\n       Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) provides that:\n\n       No individual shall be discriminated against on the basis of disability in the full and equal\n       enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of\n\n                                                  3\n\f       any place of public accommodation by any person who owns, leases (or leases to), or\n       operates a place of public accommodation.\n\n41 U.S.C. § 12182(a). It further provides that:\n\n       It shall be discriminatory to subject an individual . . . on the basis of a disability . . . to a\n       denial of the opportunity of the individual . . . to participate in or benefit from the goods,\n       services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of an entity.\n\n41 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(1)(A).\n\n       The ADA specifies that, in interpreting the general rule, discrimination includes such\n\nthings as “the imposition or application of eligibility criteria that screen out or tend to screen out\n\nan individual with a disability . . . from fully and equally enjoying any goods, services, facilities,\n\nprivileges, advantages, or accommodations, unless such criteria can be shown to be necessary for\n\nthe provision of” those things,” id. § 12182(b)(2)(A)(i); “a failure to make reasonable\n\nmodifications in policies, practices, or procedures, when such modifications are necessary to\n\nafford such goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations to individuals\n\nwith disabilities, unless the entity can demonstrate that making such modifications would\n\nfundamentally alter the nature of” those things, id. § 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii); and “a failure to take\n\nsuch steps as may be necessary to ensure that no individual with a disability is excluded, denied\n\nservices, segregated or otherwise treated differently than other individuals because of the\n\nabsence of auxiliary aids and services, unless the entity can demonstrate that taking such steps\n\nwould fundamentally alter the nature of the good, service, facility, privilege, advantage, or\n\naccommodation being offered or would result in an undue burden.” Id. § 12182(b)(2)(A)(iii).\n\n       Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act is similar to the ADA. It provides that:\n\n       No otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United States . . . shall, solely\n       by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the\n       benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving\n       Federal financial assistance.\n\n\n\n                                                   4\n\f29 U.S.C. § 794(a).\n\n       Finally, the DCHRA, in relevant part, provides:\n\n       It is an unlawful discriminatory practice . . . for an educational institution to deny,\n       restrict, or to abridge or condition the use of, or access to, any of its facilities, services,\n       programs, or benefits of any program or activity to any person otherwise qualified,\n       wholly or partially, for a discriminatory reason, based upon the . . . disability of any\n       individual.\n\nD.C. Code § 2-1402.41.\n\n       Defendant does not dispute that it is subject to the ADA, Section 504, and the DCHRA,\n\nnor does it dispute that Wolff is a disabled individual for purposes of the statutes. Rather,\n\ndefendant asserts that plaintiff has failed to state a claim because (1) “she has not established that\n\nshe is otherwise qualified for” the Aveda program or that she was excluded based on a\n\ndisability,” and (2) because she has not demonstrated that she was excluded from participation\n\nin, denied the benefits of, or subjected to discrimination under defendant’s beauty-school\n\nprogram because she never submitted a formal application, but instead only made inquiries with\n\na view toward future enrollment. (See Def. Mot. at 4–9). The Court disagrees, and concludes\n\nthat Wolff’s claims suffice to withstand defendant’s Rule 12(b)(6) motion.\n\n       In order to prevail on her claims, Wolff must show, inter alia, that (1) she has a\n\ndisability, (2) she was excluded from the Aveda Institute program because of the disability, and\n\n(2) she is otherwise qualified to be admitted to the program.

Her claim is “facially plausible” in that, assuming\n\nthe truth of all the facts alleged in the complaint, the complaint pleads factual content that\n\npermits a claim of disability discrimination. It is undisputed that she has alleged that she is\n\ndisabled, that defendant is subject to the ADA, Section 504, and the DCHRA, and that, when she\n\nrequested an auxiliary service (interpretation) that she required, defendants declined to provide\n\nher with it.\n\n        As to the “otherwise qualified” prong of Wolff’s prima facie case, the Court, at the\n\npleading stage, will draw the reasonable inference from the facts alleged that Wolff is qualified\n\nto attend a cosmetology program. The email that Wolff received from Kiesnowski—stating that\n\nthe Aveda Institute “[is] only able to provide reasonable accommodations, but we would hope\n\nthat you will still be able to find accommodations to join our Cosmetology class in March”\n\n(Kiesnowski Email)—demonstrates that the lack of available accommodations was the only\n\nbarrier to her enrollment at the Aveda Institute.\n\n        Defendant’s claim that the complaint is legally insufficient as to Wolff’s ADA claim\n\nbecause “plaintiff . . . has not demonstrated that she . . . was excluded from participation”\n\nbecause she never submitted a formal application (see Def. Mot. at 9) is similarly unpersuasive.\n\nDefendant told Wolff that it did not intend to provide her with the accommodation she requested,\n\nand the “futile gesture” principle makes clear that this is sufficient to state a claim if she was\n\neffectively excluded from participation. 42 U.S.C. § 12188(a)(1) (“Nothing in this section shall\n\nrequire a person with a disability to engage in a futile gesture if such person has actual notice that\n\na person or organization covered by this subchapter does not intend to comply with its\n\nprovisions”); see Equal Rights Ctr. v.

D.C. Code § 2-1402.41.
