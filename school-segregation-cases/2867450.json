Pursuant to 42 U.S.C.\n12134(a) and 42 U.S.C. 12206(c)(3), the Department has issued\nregulations and a Technical Assistance Manual interpreting Title\nII.    See 28 C.F.R. part 35 (1993); The Americans with\nDisabilities Act Title II Technical Assistance Manual (1993).\n     2\n      Although Karen F. Snider is the named defendant in this\nlawsuit, she was sued in her capacity as the Secretary of the\nPennsylvania Department of Public Welfare. We will, therefore,\nrefer to the defendant as the Department of Public Welfare\n(\"DPW\"), rather than Snider.\n\f12132, by the manner in which it operates its attendant care and\n\nnursing home programs.   Idell S. alleges that DPW is violating\n\nthe ADA by requiring that she receive required care services in\n\nthe segregated setting of a nursing home rather than through\n\nDPW's attendant care program.   That program would allow her to\n\nreceive those services in her own home where she could reside\n\nwith her children.   The district court ruled that DPW is not\n\nviolating the ADA because it is not discriminating against Idell\n\nS.   For the reasons that follow we will reverse.\n\n\n                                I.\n\n\n\n\n      In January of 1994, Idell S. filed an uncontested motion to\n\njoin a lawsuit which had previously been filed by Beverly D., and\n\nIlene F., who were also nursing home residents.3 The suit alleged\n\n     3\n       Helen L., the original plaintiff in this law suit, was a\npatient at Norristown State Hospital when her suit was filed.\nShe asserted a constitutional claim against Albert DiDario (the\nSuperintendent of that facility) for alleged violations of her\nFourteenth Amendment rights for failing to place her in an\nappropriate community setting and for unnecessarily maintaining\nher in Norristown State Hospital. Although she alleged a claim\nunder the ADA, she has since been discharged from Norristown\nState Hospital and thereafter pursed only a claim for damages for\nthe alleged violation of her constitutional rights. Memorandum\nOpinion, at 15-6.\n     In November of 1992, Beverly D. and Ilene F., joined Helen\nL.'s law suit and an Amended Complaint was filed asserting a\nclaim on their behalf against Karen F. Snider, as the Secretary\nof the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare.    In April of\n1993, they filed a motion for a preliminary injunction on their\nADA claim. After the parties agreed to a Stipulation of Facts,\nthe motion for preliminary injunction was converted to one for\n\fthat DPW had violated Title II of the ADA by providing services\n\nin a nursing home rather than in the “most integrated setting\n\nappropriate\" to the plaintiffs' needs, and sought declaratory and\n\ninjunctive relief.\n\n     Thereafter, Beverly D. and Ilene F. filed for an uncontested\n\nvoluntary dismissal of their claim because they had been\n\ndischarged from the nursing home. At the same time, Idell S.\n\nmoved for summary judgment based upon an Amended Stipulation of\n\nFacts.   Prior to ruling on the joinder and voluntary dismissal\n\nmotions, the district court issued a Memorandum and Order dated\n\nJanuary 27, 1994, granting summary judgment against Beverly D.\n\nand Ilene F. and in favor of DPW.        On February 2, 1994, the\n\ndistrict court issued an Order dismissing Beverly D. and Eileen\n\nF. as plaintiffs and adding Idell S. as a plaintiff.         The court\n\nalso ruled that “[f]or the reasons stated in the Memorandum filed\n\nJanuary 27, 1994, the motion for summary judgment of Idell S. is\n\ndenied and judgment is entered in favor of defendants and against\n\n. . . Idell S. . . . .\"\n\n     Idell S. then filed this appeal.4\n\n\nsummary judgment,    and   DPW   filed    a   cross-motion   for   summary\njudgment.\n     4\n       In the same Memorandum and Order which denied Idell S.’s\nmotion for summary judgment, the district court denied a motion\nfor summary judgment filed by DiDario and DiDario appealed.\nDiDario’s appeal did not involve any questions of law or fact in\ncommon with Idell S.’s appeal. On May 13, 1994, we entered an\nOrder dismissing DiDario’s appeal for lack of appellate\njurisdiction because the district court Order appealed from was\nnot a final order.\n\f                                 II.\n\n        Idell S. is 43 years old and the mother of two children ages\n\n22 and 14.5    In 1973 she contracted meningitis which left her\n\nparalyzed from the waist down and greatly reduced her ability to\n\ncare for herself.    As a result, she has been a patient at the\n\nPhiladelphia Nursing Home since December 26, 1989.    Idell S. uses\n\na wheelchair for locomotion and requires assistance with certain\n\nactivities of daily living including bathing, laundry, shopping,\n\ngetting in and out of bed, and house cleaning.    She is able to\n\ncook, dress herself (except for her shoes and socks), attend to\n\nher personal hygiene (using a transfer board to access the\n\ntoilet) and to her grooming.    The parties agree that, although\n\nIdell S. is not capable of fully independent living, she is not\n\nso incapacitated that she needs the custodial care of a nursing\n\nhome.\n\n\n     Following the issuance of the February 2, 1994 Order\ngranting summary judgment in favor of Snider and against Idell\nS., the district court issued a Rule 54(b) Certification and\nOrder on February 8, 1994, directing the Clerk to enter final\njudgment in favor of defendant Snider against Idell S. Because\nIdell S.’s sole claim was disposed of, the certification creates\na final judgment subject to appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1291.\nSee, Tilden Financial Corp. v. Palo Tire Service, 596 F.2d 604,\n607 (3d Cir. 1979).\n     Plaintiffs Florence H. and ADAPT were not parties to the\nsummary judgment motions in the district court. ADAPT’s motion\nfor voluntary dismissal was granted by the district court on\nFebruary 18, 1994.\n        5\n      The essential facts surrounding this controversy are not in\ndispute. They are contained in an Amended Stipulation of Facts\nsubmitted to the district court in January of 1994.\n\f     DPW operates two different programs that provide physically\n\ndisabled persons with assistance in daily living.   DPW funds\n\nnursing home residence through the Medical Assistance program\n\n(“Medicaid”), and it operates an “attendant care program” under\n\n62 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. §§ 3051-3055 (the “Care Act”).   The\n\nattendant care program provides “[t]hose basic and ancillary\n\nservices which enable an individual [with physical disabilities]\n\nto live in his[/her] home and community rather than in an\n\ninstitution and to carry out functions of daily living, self care\n\nand mobility.” 62 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. §§ 3052, 3054.    DPW's\n\naverage cost of caring for a person in a nursing home is $45,000\n\nper year.   The Commonwealth pays 44% of this amount ($19,800) and\n\nthe difference ($24,200) is paid by the federal government.\n\nDPW’s average cost of caring for a person in the attendant care\n\nprogram is $10,500 per year.   That amount is totally borne by the\n\nCommonwealth.\n\n     Homemaker Service of the Metropolitan Area, Inc. (“HSMA\")\n\ncontracts with DPW to operate an attendant care program.    “The\n\n[s]ervice [provided by HSMA] consists of those basic and\n\nancillary services which enable eligible individuals to live in\n\ntheir own homes and communities rather than in institutions and\n\nto carry out functions of daily living, self-care and mobility.”\n\nAmended Stipulation of Facts, ¶ 35.   The program thus allows\n\neligible individuals: “1. [t]o live in the least restrictive\n\nenvironment as independently as possible; 2. [t]o remain in their\n\fhomes and to prevent their inappropriate institutionalization. .\n\n. .” Id. at ¶36.\n\n     In 1993, HSMA evaluated Idell S. and determined that she was\n\neligible for attendant care services.   However, because of a lack\n\nof funding, she was placed on a waiting list for that program and\n\ncontinues living in a nursing home, separated from her children.\n\nThe parties agree that if Idell S. were enrolled in the attendant\n\ncare program, nursing home care would be inappropriate.6   Except\n\nfor access to skilled nursing care which she neither needs nor\n\nwants, Idell S. receives the same kind of services in the nursing\n\nhome that the attendant care program would provide.   “DPW has not\n\napplied for reimbursement under the Medical Assistance statute\n\nfor personal care/attendant care services in the community,”\n\nAmended Stipulation of Facts ¶41, nor has it “requested Medical\n\nAssistance dollars be available for Attendant Care Services in\n\nthe Community.” Id. at ¶37.   Consequently, the Commonwealth\n\ncontinues to spend approximately $45,000 a year to keep Idell S.\n\nconfined in a nursing home rather then spend considerably less to\n\nprovide her with appropriate care in her own home.\n\n     Because she is required to receive services in a nursing\n\nhome, Idell S. has no contacts with non-disabled persons other\n\n\n     6\n       The parties have stipulated that “[t]he setting for the\nprovision of attendant care services appropriate to the needs of\nIdell S. is in the community.” Amended Stipulation of Facts ¶29.\nThe parties further agree that “[w]ith attendant care services in\nthe community, nursing home care would not be appropriate for\nIdell S.” Id., at ¶32.\n\fthan the staff of the nursing home and visits from her two\n\nchildren. Idell S. claims that this violates Title II of the ADA.\n                                III.\n\n     The standard of review applicable to a grant of summary\n\njudgment is plenary.   Bixler v. Central Pa. Teamsters Health &\n\nWelfare Fund, 12 F.3d 1292, 1297 (3d Cir. 1993).     \"On review, the\n\nappellate court is required to apply the same test the district\n\ncourt should have utilized initially.\"      Goodman v. Mead Johnson &\n\nCo., 535 F.2d 566, 573 (3d Cir. 1976), cert. denied, 429 U.S.\n\n1038 (1977).   A motion for summary judgment shall be granted if\n\nthe court determines \"that there is no genuine issue as to any\n\nmaterial fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment\n\nas a matter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).      The district court's\n\ninterpretation of a federal regulation is a question of law\n\nsubject to plenary review.    ADAPT v. Skinner, 881 F.2d 1184, 1191\n\nn. 6 (3d Cir. 1989).\n\n     The district court ruled that Idell S. was\n\n          [d]enied attendant care services because of a\n          lack of funds. [The record] does not\n          demonstrate that [she has] been denied\n          funding for attendant care services because\n          [she] is disabled. [Her] failure to show\n          that [she] has been excluded from the\n          attendant care services program on the basis\n          of [her] disability is fatal to [her] claim.\n\n\nMemorandum Opinion at 11.    We disagree.\n\n\n                                 A.\n\f     In order to appreciate the scope of the ADA and its\n\nattendant   regulations, it is necessary to examine the\n\ncircumstances leading to its enactment.    Section 504 of the\n\nRehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794, was the first broad\n\nfederal statute aimed at eradicating discrimination against\n\nindividuals with disabilities.7   “Section 504 of the\n\nRehabilitation Act of 1973, [is] commonly known as the civil\n\nrights bill of the disabled.” ADAPT v. Skinner, 881 F.2d at 1187.\n\nSection 504 now reads in relevant part:\n          No otherwise qualified individual with a\n          disability...shall, solely by reason of her\n          or his disability, be excluded from the\n          participation in, be denied the benefits of,\n          or be subjected to discrimination under any\n          program or activity receiving Federal\n          financial assistance....\n\n\n29 U.S.C. § 794 (Supp. 1994).8    Section 504's sponsors described\n\nit as a response to \"’previous societal neglect’\" and introduced\n     7\n       The law developed under section 504 of the Rehabilitation\nAct is applicable to Title II of the ADA. See, Easley v. Snider,\n36 F.3d 297 (3d. Cir. 1994).     See also,    28 C.F.R. § 35.103\n(\"[T]his part [applying to the ADA] shall not be construed to\napply a lesser standard than the standards applied under title V\nof the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 791)\").\n     8\n         The   general   prohibition    against   disability-based\ndiscrimination contained in §504 was first proposed in the 92nd\nCongress as an amendment to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of\n1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d et seq.       Although it was ultimately\nenacted by the 93rd Congress as part of a pending Vocational\nRehabilitation Act, its language was patterned after other civil\nrights statutes. Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 296 n. 13\n(1985).   The language of section 504 is virtually identical to\nthat of section 601 of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\nthat bars discrimination based upon race, color or national\norigin in federally-assisted programs.    Consolidated Rail Corp.\nv. Darrone, 465 U.S. 624, 626 (1984).\n\fit to    rectify “the country’s ‘shameful oversights’ which caused\n\nthe handicapped to live among society ‘shunted aside, hidden and\n\nignored.’\" Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 296 (1985).\n\n        On April 26, 1976 then-President Gerald Ford signed\n\nExecutive Order No. 11914, 3 C.F.R. 117 (1977), which authorized\n\nthe Department of Health, Education and Welfare to coordinate\n\nenforcement of section 504 and which required the Secretary of\n\nHEW to promulgate regulations for enforcement.9    Subsequently,\n\nHEW's section 504 rulemaking and enforcement authority was\n\ntransferred to the Department of Health and Human Services\n\n(“HHS”).    See 20 U.S.C. § 3508.\n\n        On November 2, 1980, President Carter signed Executive Order\n\nNo. 12250, 45 Fed. Reg. 72995, entitled \"Leadership and\n\nCoordination of Nondiscrimination Laws\".    That Executive Order\n\ntransferred HHS’s coordination and enforcement authority to the\n\nAttorney General.    Section 1-105 of that Executive Order provided\n\n\n     As   originally   enacted,   section  504   referred  to a\n\"handicapped\" individual being discriminated against solely by\nreason of a \"handicap\".        The change in nomenclature from\n“handicap” to “disability” reflects Congress’ awareness that\nindividuals with disabilities find the term “handicapped\"\nobjectionable.   Burgdorf, The Americans with Disabilities Act:\nAnalysis and Implication of a Second-Generation Civil Rights\nStatute, 26 Harv. C.R. - C.L. L.Rev. 413, 522 n. 7 (1991).\n\n     9\n        The Rehabilitation Act did not mandate that any\nregulations be promulgated. Accordingly the Department of Health,\nEducation and Welfare (now the Department of Health and Human\nServices), did not promulgate any regulations to implement that\nAct. Southeastern Community College v. Davis, 442 U.S. 397, 404\nn. 4 (1979).\n\fthat the HHS guidelines \"shall be deemed to have been issued by\n\nthe Attorney General pursuant to this Order and shall continue in\n\neffect until revoked or modified by the Attorney General.\"\n\nThereafter, the Department of Justice adopted the HHS\n\ncoordination and enforcement regulations and transferred them\n\nfrom 45 C.F.R. part 84 to 28 C.F.R. part 41, 46 Fed. Reg. 40686.\n\n(the “coordination regulations.\")   The section 504 coordination\n\nregulations begin by stating that the purpose of 28 C.F.R. part\n\n41 is to “implement Executive Order 12250, which requires the\n\nDepartment of Justice to coordinate the implementation of section\n\n504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.\" 28 C.F.R. § 41.1.    A\n\nsubsequent section requires all federal agencies to issue\n\nregulations “to implement section 504 with respect to programs\n\nand activities to which it provides assistance.\"   28 C.F.R. §\n\n41.4.   The coordination regulations contain a separate section\n\nwhich lists a number of general prohibitions against disability-\n\nbased discrimination.   28 C.F.R. § 41.51.   That section mandates\n\nthat all recipients of federal financial assistance “shall\n\nadminister programs and activities in the most integrated setting\n\nappropriate to the needs of qualified handicapped persons.\"      28\n\nC.F.R. § 41.51(d).\n\n     Although Section 504 has been called “the cornerstone of the\n\ncivil rights movement of the mobility-impaired\", ADAPT v.\n\nSkinner, 881 F.2d at 1205 (3d Cir. 1989) (concurring opinion),\n\nits shortcomings and deficiencies quickly became apparent.       See,\n\fe.g., Cook, The Americans with Disabilities Act: The Move to\n\nIntegration,   64 Temp. L. Rev. 393, 394-408 (1991) (The\n\nRehabilitation Act and its regulations have been practically a\n\ndead letter as a remedy for segregated public services).    One\n\ncommentator has written that the weaknesses of section 504 arise\n\nfrom its statutory language,10 the limited extent of its\n\ncoverage, inadequate enforcement mechanisms and erratic judicial\n\ninterpretations.   Burgdorf, The Americans with Disabilities Act:\n\nAnalysis and Implications of a Second-Generation Civil Rights\n\nStatute, 26 Harv. C.R. - C.L. L. Rev. 413, 431 (1991).\n\n     Toward the end of the 1980's the United States Senate and\n\nthe House of Representatives both recognized that then current\n\nlaws were \"inadequate\" to combat \"the pervasive problems of\n\ndiscrimination that people with disabilities are facing.\"   S.\n\nRep. No. 116, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. 18 (1989); H.R. Rep. No. 485\n\n(II), 101st Cong., 2d Sess. 47 (1990).   The Senate recognized the\n\nneed for \"omnibus civil rights legislation\" for the disabled. S.\n\nRep. No. 116, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. 19 (1989).   Similarly, the\n\nHouse addressed the need for legislation that “will finally set\n\nin place the necessary civil rights protections for people with\n\ndisabilities.\"   H. R. Rep. No. 485 (II), 101st Cong., 2d Sess. 40\n\n(1990).   Both branches of Congress concluded:\n           [T]here is a compelling need to provide a\n           clear and comprehensive national mandate for\n\n     10\n        We have also noted that section 504 \"is both ambiguous\nand lacking in specifics.\" Disabled in Action of Pennsylvania\nv.Sykes, 833 F.2d 1113, 1117 (3d Cir. 1987), cert. denied, ___\nU.S. ___, 108 S.Ct. 1293 (1988).\n\f           the elimination of discrimination against\n           individuals with disabilities and for the\n           integration of persons with disabilities into\n           the economic and social mainstream of\n           American life. Further, there is a need to\n           provide clear, strong, consistent,\n           enforceable standards addressing\n           discrimination against individuals with\n           disabilities.\n\n\nS. Rep. No. 116, 20; H. R. Rep. No. 485 (II), 50 (emphasis\n\nadded).   It was against this backdrop that the ADA was enacted.11\n                                B.\n\n     Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12134, incorporates\n\nthe \"non-discrimination principles\" of section 504 of the\n\nRehabilitation Act12 and extends them to state and local\n\ngovernments.   Easley v. Snider, 36 F.3d 297, 300 (3d Cir. 1994).\n\nSection 202 of Title II provides:\n          [N]o qualified individual with a disability\n          shall, by reason of such disability, be\n          excluded from participation in or be denied\n          the benefits of the services, programs, or\n          activities of a public entity, or be\n          subjected to discrimination by any such\n          entity.\n\n\n42 U.S.C. § 12132. The Act directs the Attorney General to\n\npromulgate regulations necessary to implement Title II.    See 42\n\nU.S.C. § 12134(a).   The Act further commands that those\n\nregulations “be consistent with this chapter and with the\n\ncoordination regulations under part 41 of title 28, Code of\n     11\n        For a concise history of the ADA’s “tortuous legislative\njourney\", see Jones, Overview and Essential Requirements of the\nAmericans with Disabilities Act, 64 Temp. L. Rev. 471, 472-475\n(1991).\n     12\n        See 28 C.F.R. § 28.103.\n\fFederal Regulations . . . applicable . . . [under §504 of the\n\nRehabilitation Act of 1973].” 42 U.S.C. § 12134(b).    Accordingly,\n\nthe regulations that the Department of Justice promulgated under\n\nTitle II are patterned after the section 504 coordination\n\nregulations.\n\n       Because Title II was enacted with broad language and\n\ndirected the Department of Justice to promulgate regulations as\n\nset forth above, the regulations which the Department promulgated\n\nare entitled to substantial deference.    Blum v. Bacon, 457 U.S.\n\n132, 141 (1982).    (\"[T]he interpretation of [the] agency charged\n\nwith the administration of [this] statute is entitled to\n\nsubstantial deference.\")    \"[C]onsiderable weight should be\n\naccorded to an executive department's construction of a statutory\n\nscheme it is entrusted to administer.\"    Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v.\n\nNatural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 844\n\n(1984).     Unless the regulations are “arbitrary, capricious or\n\nmanifestly contrary to the statute\", the agency's regulations are\n\n“given controlling weight\".    Chevron, U.S.A., Inc., 467 U.S. at\n\n844.\n\n       Moreover, because Congress mandated that the ADA regulations\n\nbe patterned after the section 504 coordination regulations, the\n\nformer regulations have the force of law.    When Congress re-\n\nenacts a statute and voices its approval of an administrative\n\ninterpretation of that statute, that interpretation acquires the\n\nforce of law and courts are bound by the regulation.    United\n\fStates v. Board of Comm'rs of Sheffield, Alabama, 435 U.S. 110,\n\n134 (1978).   The same is true when Congress agrees with an\n\nadministrative interpretation of a statute which Congress is re-\n\nenacting.   See Don E. Williams Co. v. Commissioner, 429 U.S. 569,\n\n574-577 (1977).   Although Title II of the ADA is not a re-\n\nenactment of section 504, it does extend section 504's anti-\n\ndiscrimination principles to public entities.    Furthermore, the\n\nlegislative history of the ADA shows that Congress agreed with\n\nthe coordination regulations promulgated under section 504.     See,\n\ne.g., S. Rep. No. 116, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. 44 (1989) (\"The\n\nfirst purpose of [Title II] is to make applicable the prohibition\n\nagainst discrimination on the basis of disability, currently set\n\nout in regulations implementing section 504 of the Rehabilitation\n\nAct of 1973, to. . . state and local governments. . . . \");      H.R.\n\nRep. No. 485 (III), 101st Cong., 2d. Sess. 50.    (\"The general\n\nprohibitions set forth in the section 504 regulations are\n\napplicable to all programs and activities in Title II\").\n\n      Idell S.’s challenge to DPW’s treatment of her is based\n\nupon 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d).   That ADA regulation states that: “A\n\npublic entity shall administer services, programs, and activities\n\nin the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of\n\nqualified individuals with disabilities.”   This regulation is\n\nalmost identical to the section 504 integration regulation which\n\nhas been in effect since 1981.   See 28 C.F.R. § 41.51(d)\n\f(1981).13   As Congress has voiced its approval of that\n\ncoordination regulation, 28 C.F.R. § 130.35(d) has the force of\n\nlaw.\n\n\n                                 C.\n\n\n\n       In enacting the ADA, Congress found that \"[h]istorically,\n\nsociety has tended to isolate and segregate individuals with\n\ndisabilities, and...such forms of discrimination...continue to be\n\na serious and pervasive social problem.\"    42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(2)\n\n(emphasis added).    Congress also concluded that “[i]ndividuals\n\nwith disabilities continually encounter various forms of\n\ndiscrimination, including. . . segregation. . . .\", 42 U.S.C.\n\n§12101(a)(5) (emphasis added).    The House Report on the ADA noted\n\nthat: \"Unlike the other titles in this Act, title II does not\n\nlist all of the forms of discrimination that the title is\n\nintended to prohibit.    Therefore, the purpose of [section 204] is\n\nto direct the Attorney General to issue regulations setting forth\n\nthe forms of discrimination prohibited.\"    H.R. Rep. No. 485\n\n(III), 101st Cong., 2d Sess., 52 (1990) (emphasis added).\n\n       In furtherance of the objective of eliminating\n\ndiscrimination against the disabled, Congress stated that “the\n\nNation’s proper goals regarding individuals with disabilities are\n\n\n       13\n       The section 504 integration regulation had been in effect\nfor 8 years when, in 1989,     the 101st Congress began holding\nhearings on the proposed ADA.\n\fto assure equality of opportunity, full participation,\n\nindependent living, and economic self-sufficiency for such\n\nindividuals[.]” 42 U.S.C. §12101(a)(8) (emphasis added).\n\nSimilarly, in response to its mandate, the Department of Justice\n\nstated “[i]ntegration is fundamental to the purposes of the\n\nAmericans with Disabilities Act.” 28 C.F.R. Part 35, App. A. §\n\n35.130.14   Accordingly, the integration mandate of § 35.130(d) is\n\ncontained under 28 C.F.R. § 35.130 which is entitled “[g]eneral\n\nprohibitions against discrimination.”\n\n     Thus, the ADA and its attendant regulations clearly define\n\nunnecessary segregation as a form of illegal discrimination\n\nagainst the disabled.15 Accordingly, the district court erred in\n\nholding that the applicable provisions of the ADA “may not be\n\n\n\n     14\n       We note that this is consistent with the Fair Housing Act\nof 1988, 52 U.S.C. §3604(f), another predecessor of the ADA. In\nenacting that act, the House Judiciary Committee stated \"[t]he\nFair    Housing  Amendments  Act,   like  Section   504  of   the\nRehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, is a clear pronouncement\nof a national commitment to end the unnecessary exclusion of\npersons with handicaps from the American mainstream.\" H. Rep. No.\n711, 100th Cong., 2d Sess., 18 (1988), reprinted in 1988\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 2173, 2179 (emphasis added; footnote omitted).\n     15\n       Even if it could be argued that the Act and its\nregulations are ambiguous on this point, the heading of the\nregulation at issue here, and the legislative history of the ADA\nconfirm that Congress intended to define unnecessary segregation\nof the disabled as a form of illegal discrimination. See Crandon\nv. United States, 494 U.S. 152, 158 (1990) (Where there is\nambiguity \"[i]n determining the meaning of [a] statute, we look\nnot only to the particular statutory language, but to the design\nof the statute as a whole and to its object and policy.\"); See\nalso INS v.

Secretary of the Executive Office of\n\nHuman Services, 609 N.E.2d 447 (Ma. 1993).16 In Williams, the\n\nMassachusetts Supreme Court held, inter alia, that the ADA does\n\nnot require a specific proportion of that state’s mental health\n\nservice placements to be in integrated housing.   The court\n\nstated:\n             The focus of Federal disability\n          discrimination statutes is to address\n          discrimination in relation to nondisabled\n          persons, rather than to eliminate all\n          differences in levels or proportions of\n          resources allocated and services provided to\n          individuals with differing types of\n          disabilities. In other words, the purpose of\n          the ADA is to provide an equal opportunity\n          for disabled citizens.\n\n\nWilliams, 609 N.E.2d at 559. (citations omitted).\n\n     We are not persuaded by the analysis in   Williams.   That\n\ncourt based its decision in part upon our own decision in Clark\n\nv. Cohen 794 F.2d 79 (3rd Cir. 1986), cert denied, 479 U.S. 962\n\n          16\n              The   district   court   also  cited   Pinnock   v.\nInternational House of Pancakes, 844 F.Supp. 574, 582-3 (S.D. Ca.\n1993), to support its ruling that 28 C.F.R. § 130(d) is not\napplicable unless there is a specific finding of discrimination.\nId. at 12. However, Pinnock concerned an action under Title III\nof the ADA (public accommodations) and the discussion cited in\nthe district court's opinion dealt with the Title III integration\nregulation which the Pinnock court held is \"intended to prevent\nsegregation based on fears and stereotypes about persons with\ndisabilities.\" Id. Idell S.'s suit does not implicate Title III.\n\f(1986) and the Supreme Court’s decision in Alexander v. Choate,\n\nsupra.    Our holding in Clark is not based upon the ADA nor\n\nsection 504, but upon the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment.   There, a forty-five year old, mentally retarded woman\n\nhad been committed to a state-run mental institution since she\n\nwas fifteen years old.   She filed a complaint against the\n\nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania and the County of Philadelphia\n\nalleging various Constitutional violations as well as a violation\n\nof section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.   She alleged that her\n\nconfinement was illegal and sought placement in a community-\n\nliving arrangement supervised by the County of Philadelphia.\n\nClark based her Rehabilitation Act claim upon the fact that the\n\nCommonwealth was providing community living arrangements to\n\npersons with disabilities similar to hers while requiring her to\n\nremain in an institution.\n\n     The district court ruled that Clark had not established\n\ndisability-based discrimination, but ruled that her confinement\n\nwas unconstitutional.17 619 F. Supp. at 696-705.    In affirming\n\nthe district court’s judgment we stated “[s]ection 504 prohibits\n\ndiscrimination against the handicapped in federally funded\n\nprograms[,] [i]t imposes no affirmative obligations on the states\n\nto furnish services.\" Clark v. Cohen, 794 F. 2d at 85, n.3.\n\nHowever, we were not there concerned with the integration mandate\n\n     17\n        Clark had been continuously confined even though the\nresponsible professionals at the institution admitted that her\ncondition did not warrant confinement, and her case had never\nbeen reviewed by anyone with authority to release her.\n\fof the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act.   Plaintiff in Clark relied\n\nprimarily upon section 504 and 45 C.F.R. §§ 84.4(b)(1)(i)-(iv).\n\nThe prohibitions contained in the later regulations are under a\n\nregulation which states \"Discriminatory actions prohibited.\" 45\n\nU.S.C. § 84.4(b).   That regulation does not state that the\n\nactions set forth are prohibited per se.   Rather, it states that\n\nrecipients of federal funds may not engage in the enumerated acts\n\n\"on the basis of handicap.\"   45 U.S.C §84.4(b)(1).   Thus, the\n\nsection 504 inquiry in Clark had to include a determination of\n\nthe basis for the allegedly discriminatory actions.    The language\n\nof 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d) is very different.\n\n     In addition, we note that the court in Williams was troubled\n\nby difficulties of proof that are not present here.    The\n\nplaintiffs in Williams had attempted to use a statistical\n\nanalysis to establish that disabled persons were more likely to\n\nbe adversely affected by the state’s policy than non-disabled\n\npersons.   The court rejected that proof stating:\n\n           The plaintiffs’ use of a system-wide\n           percentage of DMH clients . . . ignores the\n           fact that the ADA does not mandate particular\n           system-wide percentages for allocations of\n           community placements. Further, the\n           plaintiffs’ figures did not show that any\n           particular client’s placement was\n           inappropriate, or that they themselves were\n           inappropriately placed in a segregated\n           setting. . . A mere percentage, standing\n           alone, does not establish a presumption of\n           inappropriate placement.\n\fId., at 414 Mass. 551, 557-8, 609 N.E.2d. 447, 453.   We encounter\n\nno such problem as the parties have stipulated that Idell S.’s\n\nplacement would be inappropriate if there was an opening in the\n\nattendant care program.18\n\n     The court in Williams was also troubled by pragmatic\n\nconcerns of granting relief.   The court stated that \"any\n\ninterpretation of the ADA must consider the same practicalities\n\nthat the United States Supreme Court acknowledged in its\n\nexamination of the Federal Rehabilitation Act.   See, e.g.\n\nAlexander v. Choate, . . . \". Id. at 557, 453 (citations\n\nomitted).   Choate did not involve 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d).    The\n\nclaim there was based upon plaintiffs’ assertion that Tennessee’s\n\nplanned cutbacks in Medicaid reimbursement for in-patient\n\nhospital stays would disproportionately disadvantage handicapped\n\npersons in violation of section 504.   However, to the extent that\n\nChoate is relevant to our analysis, it supports our holding that\n\nCongress did not intend to condition the protection of the ADA\n\nupon a finding of “discrimination”.\n\n     In Choate, the Supreme Court emphasized the factors which\n\nled to enactment of section 504.\n          Discrimination against the handicapped was\n          perceived by Congress to be most often the\n          product, not of invidious animus, but rather\n          of thoughtfulness and indifference -- of\n     18\n         The precise question raised by Idell S. has not\npreviously been decided by an appellate court. Similarly, the\ncases from other circuits that DPW relies upon to support its\nassertion that neither §504 nor Title II of the ADA require\ncommunity care were not decided on the basis of 28 C.F.R. §\n35.130(d). Brief of Appellee, at 10-11.\n\f            benign neglect. Thus, Representative Vanik,\n            introducing the predecessor to § 504 in the\n            House described the treatment of the\n            handicapped as one of the country’s ‘shameful\n            oversights’ which caused the handicapped to\n            live among society ‘shunted aside, hidden,\n            and ignored.’ Similarly, Senator Humphrey . .\n            . asserted that, ‘we can no longer tolerate\n            the invisibility of the handicapped in\n            America. . . .’ And Senator Cranston . . .\n            described the Act as a response to ‘previous\n            societal neglect’ . . . Federal agencies and\n            commentators on the plight of the handicapped\n            similarly have found that discrimination\n            against the handicapped is primarily the\n            result of apathetic attitudes rather than\n            affirmative animus.\n\n\n469 U.S. at 295 (emphasis added) (citations and footnotes\n\nomitted).19\n\n     Because the ADA evolved from an attempt to remedy the\n\neffects of “benign neglect” resulting from the “invisibility” of\n\nthe disabled, Congress could not have intended to limit the Act’s\n\nprotections and prohibitions to circumstances involving\n\ndeliberate discrimination. Such discrimination arises from\n\n“affirmative animus” which was not the focus of the ADA or\n\nsection 504.     The Supreme court elaborates upon this distinction\n\nnoting that, although discrimination against the disabled\n\nnormally results from “thoughtfulness” and “indifference”, not\n\n“invidious animus”, such “animus” did exist.     469 U.S. at 295 at\n\nn.12.     (“To be sure, well-cataloged instances of invidious\n     19\n       The court ruled that the challenged cutbacks were neutral\non their face and that, therefore, plaintiffs could not recover.\nHowever, the court noted that a plaintiff need not establish that\nthere has been an intent to discriminate in order to prevail\nunder section 504. 469 U.S. at 295-297.\n\fdiscrimination against the handicapped do exist”).     However,\n\nthat was not the focus of section 504, or the ADA.     Rather, the\n\nADA attempts to eliminate the effects of that “benign neglect,\"\n\n“apathy,\" and “indifference.\"   The 504 coordination regulations,\n\nand the ADA “make clear that the unnecessary segregation of\n\nindividuals with disabilities in the provision of public services\n\nis itself a form of discrimination within the meaning of those\n\nstatutes, independent of the discrimination that arises when\n\nindividuals with disabilities receive different services than\n\nthose provided to individuals without disabilities.”    Brief of\n\nAmicus at 7.\n\n     The ADA is intended to insure that qualified individuals\n\nreceive services in a manner consistent with basic human dignity\n\nrather than a manner which shunts them aside, hides, and ignores\n\nthem.20   “[M]uch of the conduct that Congress sought to alter in\n\npassing the Rehabilitation Act [and the ADA] would be difficult\n\nif not impossible to reach were the Act[s] construed to proscribe\n\nonly conduct fueled by a discriminatory intent.”   Alexander v.\n\nChoate, 469 U.S. at 296-7.   Thus, we will not eviscerate the ADA\n\nby conditioning its protections upon a finding of intentional or\n\novert “discrimination.”\n\n\n\n\n     20\n      However, as discussed infra, the Act does not require\nfundamental changes in the nature of a service or program.\n\f                               IV.\n\n    DPW quotes Traynor v. Turnage, 485 U.S. 535, 548 (1988) to\nargue that there can be no improper discrimination here because\n\nthe services at issue are only provided to persons with\n\ndisabilities.   See Brief of Appellee at 25-6.    However, Traynor\n\nis easily distinguished.   Traynor concerned the legality of 38\n\nU.S.C.A. § 1662 which allowed for an extension of time to use\n\nveteran’s benefits if a disability precluded the veteran from\n\nusing the benefits within the time frame established by law.\n\nHowever, the veteran only qualified if he/she could establish “a\n\nphysical or mental disorder which was not the result of [his/her]\n\nown willful misconduct.”   Id. at 535.    Traynor was an honorably\n\ndischarged veteran who suffered from alcoholism unrelated to any\n\npsychiatric disorder. Under applicable V.A. regulations, such\n\nalcoholism   was defined as “willful misconduct” thus precluding\n\nhim from relying upon his “disorder” to enlarge the period of\n\ntime that he could use his benefits.     Traynor challenged this\n\nlimitation on behalf of himself, and other similarly situated\n\nveterans.\n\n     In denying the claim, the court noted that section 504 had\n\nbeen part of the amendments to the Rehabilitation Act which were\n\npassed in 1978 and which extended the scope of that legislation\n\nto “any program or activity conducted by any Executive Agency.”\n\nId. at 547. The court noted that\n          petitioners can prevail under the Rehab-\n          ilitation Act claim only if the 1978\n          legislation can be deemed to have implicitly\n\f           repealed the willful misconduct provision of\n           the 1977 legislation or forbade the Veterans’\n           Administration to classify primary alcoholism\n           as willful misconduct. They must thereby\n           overcome the cardinal rule. . . that repeals\n           by implication are not favored.\n\n\nId. (citations and internal quotes omitted).     The court reasoned\n\nthat it was not at liberty to assume that the subsequent\n\nenactment of the Rehabilitation Act implicitly repealed the prior\n\nact unless “such a construction is absolutely necessary . . . in\n\norder that [the] words [of the latter statute] shall have any\n\nmeaning at all.”   Id. (brackets in original).    These two\n\nenactments were “capable of co-existence” as the “willful\n\nmisconduct” provision did not undermine the central purpose of\n\nsection 504.   That purpose was to “assure that handicapped\n\nindividuals receive ‘evenhanded treatment’ in relation to\n\nnonhandicapped individuals.”    Id. at 548 (citing Alexander v.\n\nChoate).\n\n     The court then noted that the program at issue did not treat\n\nhandicapped persons less favorably than nonhandicapped persons as\n\nonly handicapped persons could apply for an extension of time.\n\n“In other words § 1662(a)(1) merely provides a special benefit to\n\ndisabled veterans who bear no responsibility for their\n\ndisabilities that is not provided to other disabled veterans or\n\nto any able-bodied veterans.”   Id.   The court then stated\n\n“[t]here is nothing in the Rehabilitation Act that requires that\n\nany benefit extended to one category of handicapped persons also\n\nbe extended to all other categories of handicapped persons.”      Id.\n\fHowever, the court was not concerned with the application of the\n\nintegration mandate, or anything analogous to it, and the holding\n\nis not germane to our analysis. As noted above, Congress has\n\nstated that “discrimination against individuals with disabilities\n\npersists in such critical areas as . . . institutionalization.”\n\n42 U.S.C. §12101 (3).    If Congress were only concerned about\n\ndisparate treatment of the disabled as compared to their\n\nnondisabled counterparts, this statement would be a non sequitur\n\nas only disabled persons are institutionalized.\n\n       DPW also relies upon Johnson v. Thompson, 971 F.2d 1487,\n\n1494 (10th Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 113 S.Ct. 1255 (1993).\n\n(\"[W]here the handicapping condition is related to the\n\ncondition(s) being treated, it will rarely, if ever, be possible\n\nto say. . . that a particular decision was ‘discriminatory’\")\n\n(citation omitted)).    See Brief of Appellee at 7.   Johnson is\n\nalso inapposite.    There, the court was asked to hold that\n\ndifferent levels of medical treatment given to differently\n\nclassified infants affected with spina bifida violated section\n\n504.    The case did not involve any claim that the integration\n\nmandate of 504 or the ADA had been violated.21\n\n       DPW also attempts to defeat Idell S.’s claim by labelling it\n\na claim for “community care” or “deinstitutionalization” --\n\n\n\n\n       21\n       See Martin v. Voinovich, 840 F. Supp. 1175, 1191-92 (S.D.\nOhio 1993) (Under §504 and the ADA, discrimination between people\nwith different disabilities may be actionable).\n\fsomething which the ADA does not require.22 See Brief of Appellee\n\nat 10. Idell S. is not asserting a right to community care or\n\ndeinstitutionalization per se.   She properly concedes that DPW is\n\nunder no obligation to provide her with any care at all.    She is\n\nmerely claiming that, since she qualifies for DPW’s attendant\n\ncare program, DPW’s failure to provide those services in the\n\n“most integrated setting appropriate” to her needs (without a\n\nproper justification) violates the ADA.\n                                 V.\n\n     DPW’s obligation to provide appropriately integrated\n\nservices is not absolute as the ADA does not require that DPW\n\nmake fundamental alterations in its program.\n          A public entity shall make reasonable\n          modifications in policies, practices, or\n          procedures when the modifications are\n          necessary to avoid discrimination on the\n          basis of disability, unless the public entity\n          can demonstrate that making the modifications\n          would fundamentally alter the nature of the\n          service, program, or activity\n\n\n\n28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7).   In Southeastern Community College v.\nDavis, 442 U.S. 397 (1979), and Alexander v. Choate, supra, the\n\nSupreme Court attempted to define the limits of the requirements\n\nunder the ADA.\n\n     In Southeastern, Southeastern Community College refused to\n\nadmit an   applicant to its nursing school program because of her\n     22\n       See Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451\nU.S. 1, 24 (1981) (deinstitutionalization involves \"massive\"\nchanges in a state's programs and is not required absent a clear\nstatutory command).\n\fhearing impairment.    The college argued that a registered nurse\n\nhad to meet certain physical requirements, and asserted that\n\nDavis’ disability compromised her ability to effectively\n\nparticipate in critical training programs and safely care for\n\npatients.   Davis countered that section 504 required that the\n\nschool take certain measures to allow her to enjoy the benefits\n\nof the nursing program.   The Court disagreed and held that\n\nsection 504 imposes no obligation to engage in “affirmative\n\naction.” Id. at 411.   In Choate, the Court explained that\n\n“affirmative action” as used in Davis \"[r]eferred to those\n\n‘changes,' ‘adjustments,' or ‘modifications' to existing programs\n\nthat would be ‘substantial' or that would constitute ‘fundamental\n\nalteration[s]' in the nature of a program . . .,' rather than to\n\nthose changes that would be reasonable accommodations.\"\n\n(citations omitted). Id. at 300 n. 20.\n            In attempting to discern what is required\n          by the language of section 504, we must view\n          it in light of two countervailing legislative\n          concerns: (1) effectuation of the statute’s\n          objectives of assisting the handicapped; and\n          (2) the need to impose reasonable boundaries\n          in accomplishing this legislative purpose.\n          See Alexander v. Choate.\n\n\nADAPT v. Skinner, 881 F.2d at 1191.   “The test to determine the\n\nreasonableness of a modification is whether it alters the\n\nessential nature of the program or imposes an undue burden or\n\nhardship in light of the overall program.”    Easely v. Snider, 36\n\nF.3d at 305.\n\f     Here, DPW agrees that “the most integrated setting\n\nappropriate to [Idell S.]” is her home but argues that it cannot\n\ncomply with Idell S.'s request for the “most integrated services\n\nappropriate\" absent a fundamental alteration of its program.\n\nBrief of Appellee, at 13-17.   The only explanation DPW has\n\noffered for this position is its assertion that funding for\n\nnursing home and attendant care for fiscal year 1993-1994 has\n\nalready been appropriated by the General Assembly of Pennsylvania\n\nand that it cannot, under state constitutional law, shift funds\n\nfrom the nursing care appropriation to attendant care.    Brief of\n\nAppellee, at 14-15.   However, Idell S. is not asking that DPW\n\nalter its requirements for admission to the program, nor is she\n\nrequesting that the substance of the program be altered to\n\naccommodate her.23 Even if we assume that DPW cannot (or will\n\nnot) cause the necessary shift of funds under its current\n\nprocedures and practices, it is clear from this record that\n\nproviding attendant care services to Idell S. in her home would\n\nnot be a fundamental alteration of the attendant care program or\n\nthe nursing home program.\n\n     As previously noted, DPW administers its attendant care\n\nprogram under the Care Act, 62 Pa. Stat. Ann. § 3052 et seq.\n\n(1994).   That Act states:\n\n\n     23\n        See Easley v. Snider, supra (The ADA does not require\nthat the Commonwealth extend its attendant care services to\nphysically disabled individuals who were not mentally alert as\ndoing so would result in an unreasonable modification of the\nprogram).\n\f           The General Assembly declares it is the\n           policy of this Commonwealth that:\n\n              (1) The increased availability of\n           attendant care services for adults will\n           enable them to live in their own homes and\n           communities.\n              (2) Priority recipients of attendant care\n           services under this act shall be those\n           mentally alert but severely physically\n           disabled who are in the greatest risk of\n           being in an institutional setting.\n\n\n     We have previously noted that the attendant care program\n          enables physically disabled persons to\n          \"better control their lives and reach maximum\n          independence when they are able to direct\n          their own personal care and manage their\n          home, business, and social lives. Attendant\n          [c]are in Pennsylvania continues to be seen\n          as part of the wider independent living\n          movement whose fundamental goals are to\n          enable the physically disabled to: a)\n          maintain a less restrictive and/or\n          independent living arrangement; b) maintain\n          employment; and/or c) remain in their homes.\"\n\n\nEasley, 36 F.3d at 304.   This is remarkably similar to the policy\n\nand purpose of the ADA in general, and 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d) in\n\nparticular.   We fail to see how compliance with 28 C.F.R. §\n\n35.130(d) requires DPW to fundamentally alter its attendant care\n\nprogram.   Nor do we perceive how the requested moderation would\n\nplace an undue burden on DPW.   On the contrary, the relief that\n\nIdell S. is requesting merely requires DPW to fulfill its own\n\nobligations under state law. This is not “unreasonable.\"\n          As with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation\n          Act, integrated services are essential to\n          accomplishing the purposes of title II [of\n          the ADA]. As stated by Judge Mansmann in\n          Adapt v. Skinner, the goal [is to] eradicate\n\f            the ‘invisibility of the handicapped'\" . . .\n            [s]eparate-but-equal services do not\n            accomplish this central goal and should be\n            rejected.\n\n              The fact that it is more convenient, either\n            administratively or fiscally, to provide\n            services in a segregated manner, does not\n            constitute a valid justification for separate\n            or different services under Section 504 of\n            the Rehabilitation Act, or under [title II of\n            the ADA].\n\n\nH. R. Rep. 485 (III), 101st Cong. 2d Sess. 50. reprinted in 1990\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. at 73, (emphasis added).\n\n       Ironically, DPW asserts a justification of administrative\n\nconvenience to resist an accommodation which would save an\n\naverage of $34,500 per year, would allow Idell S. to live at home\n\nwith her children, and which would not require a single\n\nsubstantive change in its attendant care or nursing home\n\nprograms.    DPW’s resistance to such an accommodation is totally\n\ninconsistent with Congress’ pronouncement that “[t]he Nation's\n\nproper goals regarding individuals with disabilities are to\n\nassure equality of opportunity, full participation, [and]\n\nindependent living. . . .” 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(8).\n\n       DPW asserts that it cannot change Idell S.'s care because\n\nthe nursing home and attendant care programs are currently funded\n\non two separate lines of its budget.24   The General\n\nAppropriations Act.   Act 1-A of 1993, at 104, 115. DPW asserts\n\nthat    “[u]nder state constitutional law, Secretary Snider cannot\n\n       24\n      This, of course, does not explain why DPW has not changed\nher status in a new budget year.\n\fmove funds from one line to another.”   See Brief of Appellee at\n\n14-15 (citing Ashbourne School v. Commonwealth, Department of\n\nEducation, 43 Pa. Com. 593, 403 A.2d 161 (1979).   It is not now\n\nup to us to invent a funding mechanism whereby the Commonwealth\n\ncan properly finance its nursing home and attendant care\n\nprograms.   However, the ADA applies to the General Assembly of\n\nPennsylvania, and not just to DPW. DPW can not rely upon a\n\nfunding mechanism of the General Assembly to justify\n\nadministering its attendant care program in a manner that\n\ndiscriminates and then argue that it can not comply with the ADA\n\nwithout fundamentally altering its program.   We dismissed a\n\nsimilar contention in Delaware Valley Citizen’s Council for Clean\n\nAir v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 678 F.2d 470 (3rd Cir.\n\n1982).   There, plaintiff sought to hold certain members of the\n\nexecutive branch of state government in contempt for failing to\n\ncomply with a consent decree in which the officials had agreed to\n\nestablish an admissions inspection program. After the consent\n\ndecree had been executed, the General Assembly enacted\n\nlegislation which specifically “prohibited the expenditure of\n\nstate funds by the executive branch for the implementation of\n\n[that program].   Although the Governor vetoed the bill, the\n\nlegislature overrode the veto and enacted [the legislation] into\n\nlaw.” Id. at 473-4.   Thereafter, the Department of Transportation\n\n“ceased all efforts toward implementing the [program].” Id.\n\nThere, as here, the defendants relied upon Ashbourne, to argue\n\fthat their hands were tied by the power of appropriations vested\n\nin the General Assembly.     We rejected that position.   “These\n\narguments disregard the fact that the Commonwealth itself was and\n\nremains bound by the consent decree.”     Delaware Valley Citizen’s\n\nCouncil, 678 F.2d at 475. We stated:\n          Because the Commonwealth, including all its\n          branches, is bound by the decree, the\n          argument of inability to comply rings hollow.\n          Even if the executive branch defendants were\n          physically or legally incapable of complying\n          with the decree, those Commonwealth officials\n          sitting in the General Assembly certainly are\n          not incapable of insuring the Commonwealth’s\n          compliance.\n\n\n678 F.2d at 476-6.   The same applies here:   since the\n\nCommonwealth has chosen to provide services to Idell S. under the\n\nADA, it must do so in a manner which comports with the\n\nrequirements of that statute.\n\n\n                                 VI.\n\n     Generally, an appellate court reversing a grant of summary\n\njudgment will not direct the district court to enter summary\n\njudgment in favor of appellant because a genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact will remain.     First National Bank v. Lincoln\n\nNational Life Insurance Co., 824 F.2d 277, 281 (3d Cir. 1987).\n\nHowever, when an appeal concerns only issues of law, we are free\n\nto enter an order directing the district court to enter summary\n\njudgment in favor of the appellant.    Kreimer v. Bureau of Police\n\nfor the Town of Morristown, 958 F.2d 1242, 1250 (3d Cir. 1992).\n\f     Here, there are no genuine issues of material fact because\n\nof the Amended Stipulation entered into by the parties.   The only\n\nissue that remains is the interpretation and application of the\n\nADA and 28 C.F.R. § 130.35(d).   Accordingly, we will vacate the\n\norder granting summary judgment in favor of defendant and remand\n\nthis case to the district court for entry of an order granting\n\nsummary judgment to Idell S. and against DPW.\n\f",

Pursuant to 42 U.S.C.\n12134(a) and 42 U.S.C. 12206(c)(3), the Department has issued\nregulations and a Technical Assistance Manual interpreting Title\nII.    See 28 C.F.R. part 35 (1993); The Americans with\nDisabilities Act Title II Technical Assistance Manual (1993).\n     2\n      Although Karen F. Snider is the named defendant in this\nlawsuit, she was sued in her capacity as the Secretary of the\nPennsylvania Department of Public Welfare. We will, therefore,\nrefer to the defendant as the Department of Public Welfare\n(\"DPW\"), rather than Snider.\n\f12132, by the manner in which it operates its attendant care and\n\nnursing home programs.   Idell S. alleges that DPW is violating\n\nthe ADA by requiring that she receive required care services in\n\nthe segregated setting of a nursing home rather than through\n\nDPW's attendant care program.   That program would allow her to\n\nreceive those services in her own home where she could reside\n\nwith her children.   The district court ruled that DPW is not\n\nviolating the ADA because it is not discriminating against Idell\n\nS.   For the reasons that follow we will reverse.\n\n\n                                I.\n\n\n\n\n      In January of 1994, Idell S. filed an uncontested motion to\n\njoin a lawsuit which had previously been filed by Beverly D., and\n\nIlene F., who were also nursing home residents.3 The suit alleged\n\n     3\n       Helen L., the original plaintiff in this law suit, was a\npatient at Norristown State Hospital when her suit was filed.\nShe asserted a constitutional claim against Albert DiDario (the\nSuperintendent of that facility) for alleged violations of her\nFourteenth Amendment rights for failing to place her in an\nappropriate community setting and for unnecessarily maintaining\nher in Norristown State Hospital. Although she alleged a claim\nunder the ADA, she has since been discharged from Norristown\nState Hospital and thereafter pursed only a claim for damages for\nthe alleged violation of her constitutional rights. Memorandum\nOpinion, at 15-6.\n     In November of 1992, Beverly D. and Ilene F., joined Helen\nL.'s law suit and an Amended Complaint was filed asserting a\nclaim on their behalf against Karen F. Snider, as the Secretary\nof the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare.    In April of\n1993, they filed a motion for a preliminary injunction on their\nADA claim. After the parties agreed to a Stipulation of Facts,\nthe motion for preliminary injunction was converted to one for\n\fthat DPW had violated Title II of the ADA by providing services\n\nin a nursing home rather than in the “most integrated setting\n\nappropriate\" to the plaintiffs' needs, and sought declaratory and\n\ninjunctive relief.\n\n     Thereafter, Beverly D. and Ilene F. filed for an uncontested\n\nvoluntary dismissal of their claim because they had been\n\ndischarged from the nursing home. At the same time, Idell S.\n\nmoved for summary judgment based upon an Amended Stipulation of\n\nFacts.   Prior to ruling on the joinder and voluntary dismissal\n\nmotions, the district court issued a Memorandum and Order dated\n\nJanuary 27, 1994, granting summary judgment against Beverly D.\n\nand Ilene F. and in favor of DPW.        On February 2, 1994, the\n\ndistrict court issued an Order dismissing Beverly D. and Eileen\n\nF. as plaintiffs and adding Idell S. as a plaintiff.         The court\n\nalso ruled that “[f]or the reasons stated in the Memorandum filed\n\nJanuary 27, 1994, the motion for summary judgment of Idell S. is\n\ndenied and judgment is entered in favor of defendants and against\n\n. . . Idell S. . . . .\"\n\n     Idell S. then filed this appeal.4\n\n\nsummary judgment,    and   DPW   filed    a   cross-motion   for   summary\njudgment.\n     4\n       In the same Memorandum and Order which denied Idell S.’s\nmotion for summary judgment, the district court denied a motion\nfor summary judgment filed by DiDario and DiDario appealed.\nDiDario’s appeal did not involve any questions of law or fact in\ncommon with Idell S.’s appeal. On May 13, 1994, we entered an\nOrder dismissing DiDario’s appeal for lack of appellate\njurisdiction because the district court Order appealed from was\nnot a final order.\n\f                                 II.\n\n        Idell S. is 43 years old and the mother of two children ages\n\n22 and 14.5    In 1973 she contracted meningitis which left her\n\nparalyzed from the waist down and greatly reduced her ability to\n\ncare for herself.    As a result, she has been a patient at the\n\nPhiladelphia Nursing Home since December 26, 1989.    Idell S. uses\n\na wheelchair for locomotion and requires assistance with certain\n\nactivities of daily living including bathing, laundry, shopping,\n\ngetting in and out of bed, and house cleaning.    She is able to\n\ncook, dress herself (except for her shoes and socks), attend to\n\nher personal hygiene (using a transfer board to access the\n\ntoilet) and to her grooming.    The parties agree that, although\n\nIdell S. is not capable of fully independent living, she is not\n\nso incapacitated that she needs the custodial care of a nursing\n\nhome.\n\n\n     Following the issuance of the February 2, 1994 Order\ngranting summary judgment in favor of Snider and against Idell\nS., the district court issued a Rule 54(b) Certification and\nOrder on February 8, 1994, directing the Clerk to enter final\njudgment in favor of defendant Snider against Idell S. Because\nIdell S.’s sole claim was disposed of, the certification creates\na final judgment subject to appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1291.\nSee, Tilden Financial Corp. v.

ADAPT’s motion\nfor voluntary dismissal was granted by the district court on\nFebruary 18, 1994.\n        5\n      The essential facts surrounding this controversy are not in\ndispute. They are contained in an Amended Stipulation of Facts\nsubmitted to the district court in January of 1994.\n\f     DPW operates two different programs that provide physically\n\ndisabled persons with assistance in daily living.   DPW funds\n\nnursing home residence through the Medical Assistance program\n\n(“Medicaid”), and it operates an “attendant care program” under\n\n62 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. §§ 3051-3055 (the “Care Act”).   The\n\nattendant care program provides “[t]hose basic and ancillary\n\nservices which enable an individual [with physical disabilities]\n\nto live in his[/her] home and community rather than in an\n\ninstitution and to carry out functions of daily living, self care\n\nand mobility.” 62 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. §§ 3052, 3054.    DPW's\n\naverage cost of caring for a person in a nursing home is $45,000\n\nper year.   The Commonwealth pays 44% of this amount ($19,800) and\n\nthe difference ($24,200) is paid by the federal government.\n\nDPW’s average cost of caring for a person in the attendant care\n\nprogram is $10,500 per year.   That amount is totally borne by the\n\nCommonwealth.\n\n     Homemaker Service of the Metropolitan Area, Inc. (“HSMA\")\n\ncontracts with DPW to operate an attendant care program.    “The\n\n[s]ervice [provided by HSMA] consists of those basic and\n\nancillary services which enable eligible individuals to live in\n\ntheir own homes and communities rather than in institutions and\n\nto carry out functions of daily living, self-care and mobility.”\n\nAmended Stipulation of Facts, ¶ 35.   The program thus allows\n\neligible individuals: “1. [t]o live in the least restrictive\n\nenvironment as independently as possible; 2. [t]o remain in their\n\fhomes and to prevent their inappropriate institutionalization. .\n\n. .” Id. at ¶36.\n\n     In 1993, HSMA evaluated Idell S. and determined that she was\n\neligible for attendant care services.   However, because of a lack\n\nof funding, she was placed on a waiting list for that program and\n\ncontinues living in a nursing home, separated from her children.\n\nThe parties agree that if Idell S. were enrolled in the attendant\n\ncare program, nursing home care would be inappropriate.6   Except\n\nfor access to skilled nursing care which she neither needs nor\n\nwants, Idell S. receives the same kind of services in the nursing\n\nhome that the attendant care program would provide.   “DPW has not\n\napplied for reimbursement under the Medical Assistance statute\n\nfor personal care/attendant care services in the community,”\n\nAmended Stipulation of Facts ¶41, nor has it “requested Medical\n\nAssistance dollars be available for Attendant Care Services in\n\nthe Community.” Id. at ¶37.   Consequently, the Commonwealth\n\ncontinues to spend approximately $45,000 a year to keep Idell S.\n\nconfined in a nursing home rather then spend considerably less to\n\nprovide her with appropriate care in her own home.\n\n     Because she is required to receive services in a nursing\n\nhome, Idell S. has no contacts with non-disabled persons other\n\n\n     6\n       The parties have stipulated that “[t]he setting for the\nprovision of attendant care services appropriate to the needs of\nIdell S. is in the community.” Amended Stipulation of Facts ¶29.\nThe parties further agree that “[w]ith attendant care services in\nthe community, nursing home care would not be appropriate for\nIdell S.” Id., at ¶32.\n\fthan the staff of the nursing home and visits from her two\n\nchildren.

Although Title II of the ADA is not a re-\n\nenactment of section 504, it does extend section 504's anti-\n\ndiscrimination principles to public entities.    Furthermore, the\n\nlegislative history of the ADA shows that Congress agreed with\n\nthe coordination regulations promulgated under section 504.     See,\n\ne.g., S. Rep. No. 116, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. 44 (1989) (\"The\n\nfirst purpose of [Title II] is to make applicable the prohibition\n\nagainst discrimination on the basis of disability, currently set\n\nout in regulations implementing section 504 of the Rehabilitation\n\nAct of 1973, to. . . state and local governments. . . . \");      H.R.\n\nRep.

That ADA regulation states that: “A\n\npublic entity shall administer services, programs, and activities\n\nin the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of\n\nqualified individuals with disabilities.”   This regulation is\n\nalmost identical to the section 504 integration regulation which\n\nhas been in effect since 1981.   See 28 C.F.R. § 41.51(d)\n\f(1981).13   As Congress has voiced its approval of that\n\ncoordination regulation, 28 C.F.R. § 130.35(d) has the force of\n\nlaw.\n\n\n                                 C.\n\n\n\n       In enacting the ADA, Congress found that \"[h]istorically,\n\nsociety has tended to isolate and segregate individuals with\n\ndisabilities, and...such forms of discrimination...continue to be\n\na serious and pervasive social problem.\"    42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(2)\n\n(emphasis added).

The House Report on the ADA noted\n\nthat: \"Unlike the other titles in this Act, title II does not\n\nlist all of the forms of discrimination that the title is\n\nintended to prohibit.    Therefore, the purpose of [section 204] is\n\nto direct the Attorney General to issue regulations setting forth\n\nthe forms of discrimination prohibited.\"    H.R. Rep.

However, Pinnock concerned an action under Title III\nof the ADA (public accommodations) and the discussion cited in\nthe district court's opinion dealt with the Title III integration\nregulation which the Pinnock court held is \"intended to prevent\nsegregation based on fears and stereotypes about persons with\ndisabilities.\" Id. Idell S.'s suit does not implicate Title III.\n\f(1986) and the Supreme Court’s decision in Alexander v. Choate,\n\nsupra.    Our holding in Clark is not based upon the ADA nor\n\nsection 504, but upon the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment.   There, a forty-five year old, mentally retarded woman\n\nhad been committed to a state-run mental institution since she\n\nwas fifteen years old.   She filed a complaint against the\n\nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania and the County of Philadelphia\n\nalleging various Constitutional violations as well as a violation\n\nof section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.   She alleged that her\n\nconfinement was illegal and sought placement in a community-\n\nliving arrangement supervised by the County of Philadelphia.\n\nClark based her Rehabilitation Act claim upon the fact that the\n\nCommonwealth was providing community living arrangements to\n\npersons with disabilities similar to hers while requiring her to\n\nremain in an institution.\n\n     The district court ruled that Clark had not established\n\ndisability-based discrimination, but ruled that her confinement\n\nwas unconstitutional.17 619 F. Supp. at 696-705.    In affirming\n\nthe district court’s judgment we stated “[s]ection 504 prohibits\n\ndiscrimination against the handicapped in federally funded\n\nprograms[,] [i]t imposes no affirmative obligations on the states\n\nto furnish services.\" Clark v. Cohen, 794 F. 2d at 85, n.3.\n\nHowever, we were not there concerned with the integration mandate\n\n     17\n        Clark had been continuously confined even though the\nresponsible professionals at the institution admitted that her\ncondition did not warrant confinement, and her case had never\nbeen reviewed by anyone with authority to release her.\n\fof the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act.   Plaintiff in Clark relied\n\nprimarily upon section 504 and 45 C.F.R. §§ 84.4(b)(1)(i)-(iv).\n\nThe prohibitions contained in the later regulations are under a\n\nregulation which states \"Discriminatory actions prohibited.\" 45\n\nU.S.C. § 84.4(b).   That regulation does not state that the\n\nactions set forth are prohibited per se.   Rather, it states that\n\nrecipients of federal funds may not engage in the enumerated acts\n\n\"on the basis of handicap.\"   45 U.S.C §84.4(b)(1).   Thus, the\n\nsection 504 inquiry in Clark had to include a determination of\n\nthe basis for the allegedly discriminatory actions.    The language\n\nof 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d) is very different.\n\n     In addition, we note that the court in Williams was troubled\n\nby difficulties of proof that are not present here.    The\n\nplaintiffs in Williams had attempted to use a statistical\n\nanalysis to establish that disabled persons were more likely to\n\nbe adversely affected by the state’s policy than non-disabled\n\npersons.   The court rejected that proof stating:\n\n           The plaintiffs’ use of a system-wide\n           percentage of DMH clients . . . ignores the\n           fact that the ADA does not mandate particular\n           system-wide percentages for allocations of\n           community placements. Further, the\n           plaintiffs’ figures did not show that any\n           particular client’s placement was\n           inappropriate, or that they themselves were\n           inappropriately placed in a segregated\n           setting. . . A mere percentage, standing\n           alone, does not establish a presumption of\n           inappropriate placement.\n\fId., at </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2243597\"><a href=\"/opinion/2243597/williams-v-secr-of-executive-office-of-human-serv/\"><span class=\"volume\">414</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">551</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 557-8, 609 N.E.2d. 447, 453.   We encounter\n\nno such problem as the parties have stipulated that Idell S.’s\n\nplacement would be inappropriate if there was an opening in the\n\nattendant care program.18\n\n     The court in Williams was also troubled by pragmatic\n\nconcerns of granting relief.   The court stated that \"any\n\ninterpretation of the ADA must consider the same practicalities\n\nthat the United States Supreme Court acknowledged in its\n\nexamination of the Federal Rehabilitation Act.   See, e.g.\n\nAlexander v. Choate, . . . \". Id. at 557, 453 (citations\n\nomitted).   Choate did not involve 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d).    The\n\nclaim there was based upon plaintiffs’ assertion that Tennessee’s\n\nplanned cutbacks in Medicaid reimbursement for in-patient\n\nhospital stays would disproportionately disadvantage handicapped\n\npersons in violation of section 504.   However, to the extent that\n\nChoate is relevant to our analysis, it supports our holding that\n\nCongress did not intend to condition the protection of the ADA\n\nupon a finding of “discrimination”.\n\n     In Choate, the Supreme Court emphasized the factors which\n\nled to enactment of section 504.\n          Discrimination against the handicapped was\n          perceived by Congress to be most often the\n          product, not of invidious animus, but rather\n          of thoughtfulness and indifference -- of\n     18\n         The precise question raised by Idell S. has not\npreviously been decided by an appellate court. Similarly, the\ncases from other circuits that DPW relies upon to support its\nassertion that neither §504 nor Title II of the ADA require\ncommunity care were not decided on the basis of 28 C.F.R. §\n35.130(d).

Thus, Representative Vanik,\n            introducing the predecessor to § 504 in the\n            House described the treatment of the\n            handicapped as one of the country’s ‘shameful\n            oversights’ which caused the handicapped to\n            live among society ‘shunted aside, hidden,\n            and ignored.’ Similarly, Senator Humphrey . .\n            . asserted that, ‘we can no longer tolerate\n            the invisibility of the handicapped in\n            America. . . .’ And Senator Cranston . . .\n            described the Act as a response to ‘previous\n            societal neglect’ . . . Federal agencies and\n            commentators on the plight of the handicapped\n            similarly have found that discrimination\n            against the handicapped is primarily the\n            result of apathetic attitudes rather than\n            affirmative animus.\n\n\n469 U.S. at 295 (emphasis added) (citations and footnotes\n\nomitted).19\n\n     Because the ADA evolved from an attempt to remedy the\n\neffects of “benign neglect” resulting from the “invisibility” of\n\nthe disabled, Congress could not have intended to limit the Act’s\n\nprotections and prohibitions to circumstances involving\n\ndeliberate discrimination. Such discrimination arises from\n\n“affirmative animus” which was not the focus of the ADA or\n\nsection 504.     The Supreme court elaborates upon this distinction\n\nnoting that, although discrimination against the disabled\n\nnormally results from “thoughtfulness” and “indifference”, not\n\n“invidious animus”, such “animus” did exist.     469 U.S. at 295 at\n\nn.12.     (“To be sure, well-cataloged instances of invidious\n     19\n       The court ruled that the challenged cutbacks were neutral\non their face and that, therefore, plaintiffs could not recover.\nHowever, the court noted that a plaintiff need not establish that\nthere has been an intent to discriminate in order to prevail\nunder section 504. 469 U.S. at 295-297.\n\fdiscrimination against the handicapped do exist”).     However,\n\nthat was not the focus of section 504, or the ADA.     Rather, the\n\nADA attempts to eliminate the effects of that “benign neglect,\"\n\n“apathy,\" and “indifference.\"   The 504 coordination regulations,\n\nand the ADA “make clear that the unnecessary segregation of\n\nindividuals with disabilities in the provision of public services\n\nis itself a form of discrimination within the meaning of those\n\nstatutes, independent of the discrimination that arises when\n\nindividuals with disabilities receive different services than\n\nthose provided to individuals without disabilities.”    Brief of\n\nAmicus at 7.\n\n     The ADA is intended to insure that qualified individuals\n\nreceive services in a manner consistent with basic human dignity\n\nrather than a manner which shunts them aside, hides, and ignores\n\nthem.20   “[M]uch of the conduct that Congress sought to alter in\n\npassing the Rehabilitation Act [and the ADA] would be difficult\n\nif not impossible to reach were the Act[s] construed to proscribe\n\nonly conduct fueled by a discriminatory intent.”   Alexander v.\n\nChoate, 469 U.S. at 296-7.   Thus, we will not eviscerate the ADA\n\nby conditioning its protections upon a finding of intentional or\n\novert “discrimination.”\n\n\n\n\n     20\n      However, as discussed infra, the Act does not require\nfundamental changes in the nature of a service or program.\n\f                               IV.\n\n    DPW quotes Traynor v. Turnage, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112041\"><a href=\"/opinion/112041/traynor-v-turnage/\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">535</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 548 (1988) to\nargue that there can be no improper discrimination here because\n\nthe services at issue are only provided to persons with\n\ndisabilities.   See Brief of Appellee at 25-6.    However, Traynor\n\nis easily distinguished.   Traynor concerned the legality of 38\n\nU.S.C.A. § 1662 which allowed for an extension of time to use\n\nveteran’s benefits if a disability precluded the veteran from\n\nusing the benefits within the time frame established by law.\n\nHowever, the veteran only qualified if he/she could establish “a\n\nphysical or mental disorder which was not the result of [his/her]\n\nown willful misconduct.”   Id. at 535.    Traynor was an honorably\n\ndischarged veteran who suffered from alcoholism unrelated to any\n\npsychiatric disorder. Under applicable V.A. regulations, such\n\nalcoholism   was defined as “willful misconduct” thus precluding\n\nhim from relying upon his “disorder” to enlarge the period of\n\ntime that he could use his benefits.     Traynor challenged this\n\nlimitation on behalf of himself, and other similarly situated\n\nveterans.\n\n     In denying the claim, the court noted that section 504 had\n\nbeen part of the amendments to the Rehabilitation Act which were\n\npassed in 1978 and which extended the scope of that legislation\n\nto “any program or activity conducted by any Executive Agency.”\n\nId. at 547. The court noted that\n          petitioners can prevail under the Rehab-\n          ilitation Act claim only if the 1978\n          legislation can be deemed to have implicitly\n\f           repealed the willful misconduct provision of\n           the 1977 legislation or forbade the Veterans’\n           Administration to classify primary alcoholism\n           as willful misconduct. They must thereby\n           overcome the cardinal rule. . . that repeals\n           by implication are not favored.\n\n\nId. (citations and internal quotes omitted).     The court reasoned\n\nthat it was not at liberty to assume that the subsequent\n\nenactment of the Rehabilitation Act implicitly repealed the prior\n\nact unless “such a construction is absolutely necessary . . . in\n\norder that [the] words [of the latter statute] shall have any\n\nmeaning at all.”   Id. (brackets in original).    These two\n\nenactments were “capable of co-existence” as the “willful\n\nmisconduct” provision did not undermine the central purpose of\n\nsection 504.   That purpose was to “assure that handicapped\n\nindividuals receive ‘evenhanded treatment’ in relation to\n\nnonhandicapped individuals.”    Id. at 548 (citing Alexander v.\n\nChoate).\n\n     The court then noted that the program at issue did not treat\n\nhandicapped persons less favorably than nonhandicapped persons as\n\nonly handicapped persons could apply for an extension of time.\n\n“In other words § 1662(a)(1) merely provides a special benefit to\n\ndisabled veterans who bear no responsibility for their\n\ndisabilities that is not provided to other disabled veterans or\n\nto any able-bodied veterans.”   Id.   The court then stated\n\n“[t]here is nothing in the Rehabilitation Act that requires that\n\nany benefit extended to one category of handicapped persons also\n\nbe extended to all other categories of handicapped persons.”      Id.\n\fHowever, the court was not concerned with the application of the\n\nintegration mandate, or anything analogous to it, and the holding\n\nis not germane to our analysis. As noted above, Congress has\n\nstated that “discrimination against individuals with disabilities\n\npersists in such critical areas as . . . institutionalization.”\n\n42 U.S.C. §12101 (3).    If Congress were only concerned about\n\ndisparate treatment of the disabled as compared to their\n\nnondisabled counterparts, this statement would be a non sequitur\n\nas only disabled persons are institutionalized.\n\n       DPW also relies upon Johnson v.

She is\n\nmerely claiming that, since she qualifies for DPW’s attendant\n\ncare program, DPW’s failure to provide those services in the\n\n“most integrated setting appropriate” to her needs (without a\n\nproper justification) violates the ADA.\n                                 V.\n\n     DPW’s obligation to provide appropriately integrated\n\nservices is not absolute as the ADA does not require that DPW\n\nmake fundamental alterations in its program.\n          A public entity shall make reasonable\n          modifications in policies, practices, or\n          procedures when the modifications are\n          necessary to avoid discrimination on the\n          basis of disability, unless the public entity\n          can demonstrate that making the modifications\n          would fundamentally alter the nature of the\n          service, program, or activity\n\n\n\n28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7).   In Southeastern Community College v.\nDavis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110104\"><a href=\"/opinion/110104/southeastern-community-college-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">442</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">397</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1979), and Alexander v. Choate, supra, the\n\nSupreme Court attempted to define the limits of the requirements\n\nunder the ADA.\n\n     In Southeastern, Southeastern Community College refused to\n\nadmit an   applicant to its nursing school program because of her\n     22\n       See Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110458\"><a href=\"/opinion/110458/pennhurst-state-school-and-hospital-v-halderman/\"><span class=\"volume\">451</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 24 (1981) (deinstitutionalization involves \"massive\"\nchanges in a state's programs and is not required absent a clear\nstatutory command).\n\fhearing impairment.    The college argued that a registered nurse\n\nhad to meet certain physical requirements, and asserted that\n\nDavis’ disability compromised her ability to effectively\n\nparticipate in critical training programs and safely care for\n\npatients.   Davis countered that section 504 required that the\n\nschool take certain measures to allow her to enjoy the benefits\n\nof the nursing program.   The Court disagreed and held that\n\nsection 504 imposes no obligation to engage in “affirmative\n\naction.” Id. at 411.   In Choate, the Court explained that\n\n“affirmative action” as used in Davis \"[r]eferred to those\n\n‘changes,' ‘adjustments,' or ‘modifications' to existing programs\n\nthat would be ‘substantial' or that would constitute ‘fundamental\n\nalteration[s]' in the nature of a program . . .,' rather than to\n\nthose changes that would be reasonable accommodations.\"\n\n(citations omitted). Id. at 300 n. 20.\n            In attempting to discern what is required\n          by the language of section 504, we must view\n          it in light of two countervailing legislative\n          concerns: (1) effectuation of the statute’s\n          objectives of assisting the handicapped; and\n          (2) the need to impose reasonable boundaries\n          in accomplishing this legislative purpose.\n          See Alexander v. Choate.\n\n\nADAPT v. Skinner, 881 F.2d at 1191.   “The test to determine the\n\nreasonableness of a modification is whether it alters the\n\nessential nature of the program or imposes an undue burden or\n\nhardship in light of the overall program.”    Easely v. Snider, 36\n\nF.3d at 305.\n\f     Here, DPW agrees that “the most integrated setting\n\nappropriate to [Idell S.]” is her home but argues that it cannot\n\ncomply with Idell S.'s request for the “most integrated services\n\nappropriate\" absent a fundamental alteration of its program.\n\nBrief of Appellee, at 13-17.   The only explanation DPW has\n\noffered for this position is its assertion that funding for\n\nnursing home and attendant care for fiscal year 1993-1994 has\n\nalready been appropriated by the General Assembly of Pennsylvania\n\nand that it cannot, under state constitutional law, shift funds\n\nfrom the nursing care appropriation to attendant care.    Brief of\n\nAppellee, at 14-15.   However, Idell S. is not asking that DPW\n\nalter its requirements for admission to the program, nor is she\n\nrequesting that the substance of the program be altered to\n\naccommodate her.23 Even if we assume that DPW cannot (or will\n\nnot) cause the necessary shift of funds under its current\n\nprocedures and practices, it is clear from this record that\n\nproviding attendant care services to Idell S. in her home would\n\nnot be a fundamental alteration of the attendant care program or\n\nthe nursing home program.\n\n     As previously noted, DPW administers its attendant care\n\nprogram under the Care Act, 62 Pa. Stat. Ann. § 3052 et seq.\n\n(1994).   That Act states:\n\n\n     23\n        See Easley v. Snider, supra (The ADA does not require\nthat the Commonwealth extend its attendant care services to\nphysically disabled individuals who were not mentally alert as\ndoing so would result in an unreasonable modification of the\nprogram).\n\f           The General Assembly declares it is the\n           policy of this Commonwealth that:\n\n              (1) The increased availability of\n           attendant care services for adults will\n           enable them to live in their own homes and\n           communities.\n              (2) Priority recipients of attendant care\n           services under this act shall be those\n           mentally alert but severely physically\n           disabled who are in the greatest risk of\n           being in an institutional setting.\n\n\n     We have previously noted that the attendant care program\n          enables physically disabled persons to\n          \"better control their lives and reach maximum\n          independence when they are able to direct\n          their own personal care and manage their\n          home, business, and social lives. Attendant\n          [c]are in Pennsylvania continues to be seen\n          as part of the wider independent living\n          movement whose fundamental goals are to\n          enable the physically disabled to: a)\n          maintain a less restrictive and/or\n          independent living arrangement; b) maintain\n          employment; and/or c) remain in their homes.\"\n\n\nEasley, 36 F.3d at 304.   This is remarkably similar to the policy\n\nand purpose of the ADA in general, and 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d) in\n\nparticular.   We fail to see how compliance with 28 C.F.R. §\n\n35.130(d) requires DPW to fundamentally alter its attendant care\n\nprogram.   Nor do we perceive how the requested moderation would\n\nplace an undue burden on DPW.   On the contrary, the relief that\n\nIdell S. is requesting merely requires DPW to fulfill its own\n\nobligations under state law. This is not “unreasonable.\"\n          As with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation\n          Act, integrated services are essential to\n          accomplishing the purposes of title II [of\n          the ADA]. As stated by Judge Mansmann in\n          Adapt v. Skinner, the goal [is to] eradicate\n\f            the ‘invisibility of the handicapped'\" . . .\n            [s]eparate-but-equal services do not\n            accomplish this central goal and should be\n            rejected.\n\n              The fact that it is more convenient, either\n            administratively or fiscally, to provide\n            services in a segregated manner, does not\n            constitute a valid justification for separate\n            or different services under Section 504 of\n            the Rehabilitation Act, or under [title II of\n            the ADA].\n\n\nH. R. Rep. 485 (III), 101st Cong. 2d Sess. 50. reprinted in 1990\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. at 73, (emphasis added).\n\n       Ironically, DPW asserts a justification of administrative\n\nconvenience to resist an accommodation which would save an\n\naverage of $34,500 per year, would allow Idell S. to live at home\n\nwith her children, and which would not require a single\n\nsubstantive change in its attendant care or nursing home\n\nprograms.    DPW’s resistance to such an accommodation is totally\n\ninconsistent with Congress’ pronouncement that “[t]he Nation's\n\nproper goals regarding individuals with disabilities are to\n\nassure equality of opportunity, full participation, [and]\n\nindependent living. . . .” 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(8).\n\n       DPW asserts that it cannot change Idell S.'s care because\n\nthe nursing home and attendant care programs are currently funded\n\non two separate lines of its budget.24   The General\n\nAppropriations Act.   Act 1-A of 1993, at 104, 115. DPW asserts\n\nthat    “[u]nder state constitutional law, Secretary Snider cannot\n\n       24\n      This, of course, does not explain why DPW has not changed\nher status in a new budget year.\n\fmove funds from one line to another.”   See Brief of Appellee at\n\n14-15 (citing Ashbourne School v. Commonwealth, Department of\n\nEducation, 43 Pa. Com. 593, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">403</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">161</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1979).   It is not now\n\nup to us to invent a funding mechanism whereby the Commonwealth\n\ncan properly finance its nursing home and attendant care\n\nprograms.   However, the ADA applies to the General Assembly of\n\nPennsylvania, and not just to DPW. DPW can not rely upon a\n\nfunding mechanism of the General Assembly to justify\n\nadministering its attendant care program in a manner that\n\ndiscriminates and then argue that it can not comply with the ADA\n\nwithout fundamentally altering its program.   We dismissed a\n\nsimilar contention in Delaware Valley Citizen’s Council for Clean\n\nAir v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"403781\"><a href=\"/opinion/403781/delaware-valley-citizens-council-for-clean-air-american-lung-association/\"><span class=\"volume\">678</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">470</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3rd Cir.\n\n1982).   There, plaintiff sought to hold certain members of the\n\nexecutive branch of state government in contempt for failing to\n\ncomply with a consent decree in which the officials had agreed to\n\nestablish an admissions inspection program. After the consent\n\ndecree had been executed, the General Assembly enacted\n\nlegislation which specifically “prohibited the expenditure of\n\nstate funds by the executive branch for the implementation of\n\n[that program].   Although the Governor vetoed the bill, the\n\nlegislature overrode the veto and enacted [the legislation] into\n\nlaw.” Id. at 473-4.   Thereafter, the Department of Transportation\n\n“ceased all efforts toward implementing the [program].” Id.\n\nThere, as here, the defendants relied upon Ashbourne, to argue\n\fthat their hands were tied by the power of appropriations vested\n\nin the General Assembly.     We rejected that position.   “These\n\narguments disregard the fact that the Commonwealth itself was and\n\nremains bound by the consent decree.”     Delaware Valley Citizen’s\n\nCouncil, 678 F.2d at 475. We stated:\n          Because the Commonwealth, including all its\n          branches, is bound by the decree, the\n          argument of inability to comply rings hollow.\n          Even if the executive branch defendants were\n          physically or legally incapable of complying\n          with the decree, those Commonwealth officials\n          sitting in the General Assembly certainly are\n          not incapable of insuring the Commonwealth’s\n          compliance.\n\n\n678 F.2d at 476-6.   The same applies here:   since the\n\nCommonwealth has chosen to provide services to Idell S. under the\n\nADA, it must do so in a manner which comports with the\n\nrequirements of that statute.\n\n\n                                 VI.\n\n     Generally, an appellate court reversing a grant of summary\n\njudgment will not direct the district court to enter summary\n\njudgment in favor of appellant because a genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact will remain.
