The\nPermit is governed by a complex state and federal statutory scheme regulating pollutant\ndischarge into waterways under the federal Clean Water Act and the California Porter-\nCologne Water Act. The Permit‘s subvention status is subject to initial determination by the\nCommission on State Mandates (Commission). Real parties in interest filed a test claim\nbefore the Commission, seeking to determine whether four requirements of the Permit (to\ninstall trash receptacles at transit stops and to conduct inspections of commercial, industrial,\nand construction sites) constituted unfunded state mandates subject to reimbursement under\nthe California Constitution, article XIII B, section 6 because although the Permit was\ngoverned by both federal law and state law, the County asserted the Permit contained\nadditional state requirements not found in the governing federal statutes and regulations. The\nCommission agreed and found that the requirements constituted state mandates, although it\n\n\n\n                                                2\n\fconcluded subvention was required only for the trash receptacles because the County had the\nability to levy fees to pay for the inspections.\n       The Department of Finance filed a petition for writ of mandate in the trial court,\nseeking to overturn the Commission‘s ruling, contending that the requirements were solely\nfederal mandates because they implemented the directive of the federal statutes and\nregulations and thus were not subject to state subvention. The trial court agreed and found\nthat the Commission erred in finding the Permit requirements were state mandates because it\ndid not apply the applicable federal ―maximum extent practicable‖ standard, and issued a writ\nof mandate ordering the Commission to vacate its decision.\n       On appeal, the dispute centers on whether the federal standard requiring the reduction\nof pollutants to the maximum extent practicable encompassed the specific four requirements\nof the Permit, given that the federal regulations at issue did not expressly spell out such\nrequirements. The amici parties California Stormwater Quality Association et al. (collectively\nCSQA) join in the County‘s arguments that the trial court erred in finding the maximum\nextent practicable standard controlled. The amicus party Building Association Legal Defense\nFoundation (Building Association) asserts that the issue is one of preemption, and the trial\ncourt erred in finding that the federal regulations governed the court‘s mandate analysis. We\nagree with the trial court‘s conclusion that the Commission failed to apply the controlling\nmaximum extent practicable standard, that the Permit‘s mandates implement the maximum\nextent practicable objective, and thus are federal mandates. We affirm the judgment.\n             FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n       A.      Regulatory Structure\n       The Permit was issued as a ―National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System‖\n(NPDES) permit pursuant to the Clean Water Act, Title 33 United States Code section 1342.\nThe Clean Water Act requires operators of municipal separate storm sewer systems to obtain\nNPDES permits that contain controls to ―reduce the discharge of pollutants to the maximum\nextent practicable.‖ (33 U.S.C. § 1342(p)(3)(B)(iii).) The Commission did not consider this\nstandard in evaluating the Permit‘s requirements, instead looking solely to whether the\n\n\n                                                   3\n\frequirements were expressly set forth in the implementing federal regulation at 40 Code of\nFederal Regulations, part 122.26(d)(2)(iv)(A)–(D) (a copy of appendix A is attached).\n       1.       Federal Framework\n       In 1972, Congress passed the Clean Water Act. (33 U.S.C. § 1251 et seq.) The Clean\nWater Act‘s national goal was to eliminate discharge of pollutants into navigable waters of the\nUnited States by 1985. (PUD No. 1 of Jefferson County v. Washington Dept. of Ecology\n(1994) 511 U.S. 700, 704 [114 S.Ct. 1900, 128 L.Ed.2d 716]; City of Burbank v. State Water\nResources Control Board (2005) 35 Cal.4th 613, 619–620 (City of Burbank).) To achieve\nthis goal, the Clean Water Act ―established restrictions on the ‗quantities, rates, and\nconcentrations of chemical, physical, biological, and other constituents‘‖ that could be\ndischarged into the nation‘s waterways. ―[T]hese effluent limitations permit the discharge of\npollutants only when the water has been satisfactorily treated to conform to federal water\nquality standards. (33 U.S.C. §§ 1311 1362(11).)‖ (City of Burbank, at p. 620.)\n       ―The Clean Water Act employs the basic strategy of prohibiting emissions from ‗point\n\nsources,‘[1] unless the [emitter] obtains . . . an NPDES permit.‖ (Building Industry Assn. of\nSan Diego County v. State Water Resources Control Bd. (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 866, 872,\nfns. omitted (Building Industry).) NPDES permits are required for ―a discharge from a\nmunicipal separate storm sewer system serving a population of 250,000 or more.‖ (33 U.S.C.\n§ 1342(p)(2)(C).) NPDES permits have ―‗five components: technology-based limitations,\nwater-quality based limitations, monitoring and reporting requirements, standard conditions,\nand special conditions.‘‖ (WaterKeepers Northern California v. State Water Resources\nControl Bd. (2002) 102 Cal.App.4th 1448, 1452.)\n       Special rules apply to storm sewers. In 1987, Congress amended the Clean Water Act\nto require operators of ―municipal separate storm sewer systems‖ (MS4)2 to control or reduce\n\n       1A ―point source‖ is ―any discernable, confined and discrete conveyance‖ and\nincludes ―any pipe, ditch, channel . . . from which pollutants . . . may be discharged.‖ (33\nU.S.C. § 1362(14).)\n       2   MS4‘s fall under the definition of ―point source.‖ (33 U.S.C. § 1362(14).)\n\n                                                4\n\fthe discharge of pollutants to the ―maximum extent practicable‖ (MEP). 3 (33 U.S.C.\n§ 1342(p)(3)(B)(iii).) Congress ―clarified that the EPA [Environmental Protection Agency\n(EPA)] had the authority to fashion NPDES permit requirements to meet water quality\nstandards without specific numerical effluent limits and instead to impose ‗controls to reduce\nthe discharge of pollutants to the maximum extent practicable . . . .‘‖ (Building Industry,\nsupra, 124 Cal.App.4th at p. 874; 33 U.S.C. § 1342(p)(3)(B)(iii).) Stormwater discharge is a\nsignificant source of water pollution, and contains suspended metals, sediments, algae-\npromoting nutrients, trash, used motor oil, raw sewage, pesticides, and other toxic\ncontaminants. Sources of polluted stormwater discharge are ―urban development, industrial\nfacilities, construction sites, and illicit discharges and connections to storm sewer systems.‖\n(Environmental Defense Center, Inc. v. U.S.E.P.A. (9th Cir. 2003) 344 F.3d 832, 840.) Unlike\na sanitary sewer system, which transports sewage for treatment at a wastewater facility, MS4‘s\nconvey only stormwater. (Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. County of Los Angeles\n(2013) 725 F.3d 1194, 1197, fn. 2.) As a result, the flexible maximum extent practicable\nstandard is designed to permit MS4 dischargers to comply with such requirement on a permit-\nby-permit basis.\n       The EPA promulgated regulations to provide guidance to stormwater system\npermittees concerning requirements for MS4 permits. The regulations contain certain\nrequirements, such as requiring MS4 permittees to include a program to monitor discharge\nfrom municipal landfills, hazardous waste treatment plants, but otherwise allow permittees to\ndevelop their own programs to meet the maximum extent practicable standard. (See 40\n\n       3 Title 33 United States Code section 1342(p)(3)(B)(iii) requires operators of\nmunicipal storm sewer systems permits to ―require controls to reduce the discharge of\npollutants to the maximum extent practicable, including management practices, control\ntechniques and system, design and engineering methods, and such other provisions as the\nAdministrator or the State determines appropriate for the control of such pollutants.‖ The\nClean Water Act does not define the ―maximum extent practicable‖ standard. (City of\nArcadia v. State Water Resources Control Bd. (2006) 135 Cal.App.4th 1392, 1427, fn. 13.)\nIndeed, the EPA has expressly declined to directly define the standard. (40 C.F.R. § 122.2; 64\nFed.Reg. 68722, 68754 (Dec. 8, 1999).)\n\n                                                5\n\fC.F.R. § 122.26(d)(2)(iv)(A)–(C).) Before an NPDES permit is issued, the federal or state\nregulatory agency must follow an extensive administrative hearing procedure. (See, e.g., 40\nC.F.R. §§ 124.3, 124.6, 124.8, 124.10.)\n              2.      State Framework\n       With respect to concurrent state regulation, ―[t]he Clean Water Act anticipates a\npartnership between the States and the Federal Government, animated by a shared objective:\n‗to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation‘s\nwaters.‘ [Citation.]‖ (Arkansas v. Oklahoma (1992) 503 U.S. 91, 101 [112 S.Ct. 1046, 117\nL.Ed.2d 239].) The Clean Water Act permits states to adopt more stringent standards than\nthose under the Clean Water Act itself. (33 U.S.C. § 1370.) ―Nothing in this part precludes a\nState from: (1) Adopting or enforcing requirements which are more stringent or more\nextensive than those required under this part; (2) Operating a program with a greater scope of\ncoverage than that required under this part.‖ (40 C.F.R. § 123.l(i).)\n       Under California law, the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act (Porter-Cologne\nAct), enacted in 1969, predates the Clean Water Act and establishes a statewide program for\nwater quality control. (Wat. Code, § 13000 et seq.) Nine regional boards, overseen by the\nState Water Resources Control Board (State Board), administer the state program in their\nrespective regions. (Wat. Code, §§ 13140, 13200 et seq., 13240, 13301.) After enactment of\nthe Clean Water Act, the Legislature ―amended the Porter-Cologne Act to require the State\nBoard and regional boards to issue discharge permits that ensure compliance with the Clean\nWater Act. (See Wat. Code, § 13370 et seq.)‖ (WaterKeepers Northern California, supra,\n102 Cal.App.4th at p. 1452.) The Clean Water Act thus permits NPDES permits to be issued\neither by the EPA or an EPA-approved state. (33 U.S.C. § 1342(a)(1), (b); Wat. Code,\n§§ 13374, 13377.) The EPA has issued guidance documents discussing best management\npractices (BMP) to be included in MS4 permits. Under the Clean Water Act, the proper scope\nof the controls in an NPDES permit depends on the applicable state water quality standards\nfor the affected water bodies. (See Communities for a Better Environment v. State Water\nResources Control Bd. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 1089, 1092.) Thus, the Clean Water Act\n\n\n                                               6\n\festablishes a partnership between the EPA and the various states through the NPDES permit\nsystem for addressing pollution problems. The Clean Water Act envisions the use of both\nstate and federal law to remedy pollution problems. (International Paper Co. v. Ouellette\n(1986) 479 U.S. 481, 490 [107 S.Ct. 805, 93 L.Ed.2d 883].)\n       Regional boards are authorized to issue NPDES permits for five-year periods. (33\nU.S.C. § 1342(b)(1)(B); Wat. Code, § 13378; City of Rancho Cucamonga v. Regional Water\nQuality Control Bd. (2006) 135 Cal.App.4th 1377, 1381.) Thus, in California, wastewater\ndischarge requirements established by the regional boards also serve as the NPDES permits\nrequired by federal law. (Wat. Code, § 13374; City of Burbank, supra, 35 Cal.4th at p. 621;\nBuilding Industry, supra, 124 Cal.App.4th at p. 875.) The state issuing a permit must insure it\ncomplies with federal requirements and provide for continued monitoring and inspection. (33\nU.S.C. §§ 1342(b)(1), (b)(2), 1311, 1312, 1316, 1317.) When a permit is renewed, modified,\nor reissued, it must be at least as stringent as the prior permit. (33 U.S.C. § 1342(o).)\n       The EPA retains veto power over a state-issued NPDES permit if the EPA does not\nfind compliance with any applicable federal requirements. (33 U.S.C. § 1342(d); 40 C.F.R.\n§ 123.44.) Further, the EPA may withdraw its approval of a state NPDES program if it\ndetermines the state is not administering the program in compliance with the federal\nrequirement. (33 U.S.C. § 1342(c)(3); 40 C.F.R. §§ 123.63, 123.64.) If a state repeatedly\nissues permits that are vetoed by the EPA, the EPA may find this constitutes grounds for\nwithdrawal of the state‘s program approval. (40 C.F.R. § 123.63(a)(2)(ii).)\n       B.      The Commission on State Mandates\n       The California Constitution, article XIII B, section 6(a), provides, in relevant part:\n―Whenever the Legislature or any state agency mandates a new program or higher level of\n\nservice on any local government, the state shall provide a subvention[4] of funds to reimburse\nthat local government for the costs of such program or increased level of service . . . .‖ (See\n\n       4 ―‗Subvention‘ generally means a grant of financial aid or assistance, or a subsidy.\n[Citation.]‖ (Hayes v. Commission on State Mandates (1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 1564, 1577\n(Hayes).)\n\n                                                7\n\falso Gov. Code, § 17514.) The purpose of this provision ―is to preclude the state from\nshifting financial responsibility for carrying out governmental functions to local agencies,\nwhich are ‗ill equipped‘ to assume increased financial responsibilities because of the taxing\nand spending limitations that articles XIII A and XIII B impose. [Citations.]‖ (County of San\nDiego v. State of California (1997) 15 Cal.4th 68, 81.)\n       After the adoption of article XIII B by the voters in November 1979, the Legislature\nenacted a statutory and administrative scheme for implementing article XIII B, section 6, and\nresolving claims and disputes arising out of its provisions. (Gov. Code, § 17500 et seq.;\nKinlaw v. State of California (1991) 54 Cal.3d 326, 331–333.) In 1984, the Legislature\ncreated the Commission as a quasi-judicial body to carry out a comprehensive administrative\nprocedure to resolve disputes over the existence of state-mandated local programs. (Gov.\nCode, § 17500; California School Boards Assn. v. State (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 1183, 1199–\n1200.) The Commission process uses a ―test claim,‖ which must be filed within one year of\nthe effective date of the mandate or incursion of costs. (Gov. Code, § 17551, subd. (c);\nGrossmont Union High School Dist. v. State Dept. of Education (2008) 169 Cal.App.4th 869,\n877.) The Commission acts on the test claim at a public hearing where evidence may be\npresented. (Gov. Code, § 17553.)\n       In order to qualify for subvention, the required activity or task must constitute a new\nprogram or higher level of service. (San Diego Unified School Dist. v. Commission on State\nMandates (2004) 33 Cal.4th 859, 874.) The courts have defined a ―program‖ subject to article\nXIII B, section 6, of the California Constitution, as one that carries out the governmental\nfunction of providing public services, or a law that imposes unique requirements on local\nagencies or school districts to implement a state policy, but does not apply generally to all\nresidents and entities in the state. (San Diego Unified School Dist., at p. 874.) To determine if\nthe program is new or imposes a higher level of service, the test claim legislation must be\ncompared with the legal requirements in effect immediately before the enactment of the test\nclaim legislation. A ―higher level of service‖ occurs when the new ―requirements were\nintended to provide an enhanced service to the public.‖ (Ibid.) Finally, the newly required\n\n\n                                                8\n\factivity or increased level of service must impose costs mandated by the state. (County of\nFresno v. State of California (1991) 53 Cal.3d 482, 487.)\n       The subvention requirement does not extend to federally mandated programs. (Cal.\nConst., art. XIII B, § 9, subd. (b); Gov. Code, §§ 17513, 17556, subd. (c); City of Sacramento\nv. State of California (1990) 50 Cal.3d 51, 57–58 (City of Sacramento).) Further, even if the\nprogram requires a higher level of service, if the local agency has the authority to levy\ncharges, fees, or assessments sufficient to pay for the program, it will not constitute a mandate\nwithin the meaning of article XIII B. (Gov. Code, § 17556, subd. (d).)\n       The Commission has the sole and exclusive authority to adjudicate whether a state\nmandate exists. (Redevelopment Agency v. Commission on State Mandates (1996) 43\nCal.App.4th 1188, 1192–1193.) The Commission‘s authority is limited only by judicial\nreview. ―A claimant or the state may commence a proceeding in accordance with the\nprovisions of Section 1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure to set aside a decision of the\ncommission on the ground that the commission‘s decision is not supported by substantial\nevidence. . . .‖ (Gov. Code, § 17559, subd. (b).)\n       C.      The Permit\n               1.     Background\n       To obtain the permit, the County of Los Angeles, on behalf of itself and the cities,\nsubmitted on January 31, 2001 a Report of Waste Discharge (ROWD), which constituted a\npermit application, and a Stormwater Quality Management Program, which constituted the\npermittees proposal for best management practices that would be required in the permit. The\nROWD contained a Storm Water Management Program as set forth in 40 Code of Federal\nRegulations, part 122.26(d), which in turn included a Storm Water Quality Management\nProgram (SQMP).\n       The Regional Board issued notices to the permitees and interested agencies and\npersons of its intent to issue the Permit, and provided an opportunity for comment and\nrecommendations. In addition, the Regional Board conducted public workshops to discuss\n\n\n\n                                                9\n\fdrafts of the Permit, and held a public hearing at which it heard and considered all comments\npertaining to the Permit‘s requirements.\n       The Permit was issued pursuant to section 402 of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C.\n§ 1342), and was originally adopted by the Regional Board on December 13, 2001 as NPDES\nPermit No. CAS004001, and amended on September 14, 2006 and August 9, 2007.5 The\nPermit established waste discharge requirements for municipal storm water and urban runoff\ndischarges within the County of Los Angeles and the incorporated cities therein, except the\nCity of Long Beach.\n       The 72-page permit is divided into six parts. The County, the flood control district,\nand the 84 cities are designated in the permit as the permittees. The Permit incorporated the\nRegional Board‘s factual findings regarding the nature of the harms occurring because of\nstorm water discharge, surface water runoff, and pollutants. The Permit found ―[t]he\nregulations require that permittees establish priorities and procedures for inspection of\nindustrial facilities and priority commercial establishments. This permit, consistent with\n[EPA] policy, incorporates a cooperative partnership, including the specification of minimum\nexpectations, between the Regional Board and the permittees for the inspection of industrial\nfacilities and priority commercial establishments to control pollutants in storm water\ndischarges (58 Fed. Reg. 61157).‖ Further, ―Section 402 of the [Clean Water Act] (33 U.S.C.\n§ 1342(p)) provides that MS4 permits must ‗require controls to reduce the discharge of\npollutants to the maximum extent practicable, including management practices, control\ntechniques and systems, design engineering methods and such other provisions as the [EPA]\nAdministrator or the State determines appropriate for the control of such pollutants.‘ The\nState Water Resources Control Board‘s (State Board) Office of Chief Counsel (OCC) has\nissued a memorandum interpreting the meaning of MEP to include technical feasibility, cost,\nand benefit derived with the burden being on the municipality to demonstrate compliance with\n\n\n\n\n       5   The Permit was originally issued in 1990 and renewed in 1996.\n\n                                               10\n\fMEP by showing that a BMP [best management practice] is not technically feasible in the\nlocality or that BMP[] costs would exceed any benefit to be derived. . . .‖\n       Separately, to facilitate compliance with federal regulations, the State Board has\npreviously issued two statewide general NPDES permits for stormwater discharges: (1) for\nstormwater from industrial sites [NPDES No. CAS000001, General Industrial Activity Storm\nWater Permit (GIASP)] and (2) for stormwater from construction sites [NPDES\nNo. CAS000002, General Construction Activity Storm Water Permit (GCASP)], originally\nissued in 1997 and 1999, respectively. Facilities discharging stormwater associated with\nindustrial activities and construction sites of five acres or more of disturbed area were required\nto obtain individualized NPDES permits, or to be covered by a statewide general permit. The\nPermit sets forth that ―[t]he USEPA guidance anticipates coordination of the state-\nadministered programs for industrial and construction activities with the local agency program\nto reduce pollutants in storm water discharges to the MS4.‖\n       The GCASP was issued to address effluent limitations promulgated under the Clean\nWater Act and as specified in the applicable federal regulations. Under the GCASP, the state\nrequires inspections of construction sites prior to anticipated storm events to identify areas\ncontributing to the discharge of stormwater, and to ensure that BMPs were properly installed\nand functioned adequately during the storm. In addition, the site must permit the Regional\nBoard, the State Board, the EPA, and the operator of the storm sewer into which the site\ndischarges stormwater to inspect the site. The GIASP was likewise issued to address effluent\nlimitations promulgated under the Clean Water Act and as specified in the federal regulations\napplicable to the Clean Water Act. With respect to inspections, the GIASP has an extensive\nmonitoring program that is facility-specific and requires visual inspections and water\nsampling and analysis. Under the GIASP, the facility operator may, if it meets certain\nconditions, certify compliance with the GIASP and reduce the number of sampling events.\nPreventative maintenance must also be conducted by the facility‘s operators, and includes\ninspection of structural storm water controls (catch basins, oil/water separators, etc.) as well as\nother facility equipment and systems. In addition, there must be an inspection schedule of all\n\n\n                                                11\n\fpotential pollutant sources. The site must also permit Regional Board, State Board, EPA and\nany local storm water agency to enter into the site for inspections. The GIASP specifically\nnotes that it ―does not preempt or supersede the authority of local agencies to prohibit, restrict,\nor control storm water discharges and authorized non-storm water discharges to storm drain\nsystems or other water-courses within their jurisdictions as allowed by State and Federal law.‖\nThe Regional Board has the authority to enforce the GIASP and GCASP.\n       The Los Angeles County Flood Control District was designated as the principal\npermittee and was to, among other things, coordinate permit activities among the permittees\nand provide technical and administrative support.\n               2.      Permit Requirements\n       The County challenged before the Commission parts 4C2a (inspections of commercial\nfacilities), 4C2b (inspection of industrial facilities), 4E (inspection of construction sites) and\n4F5c3 (installation of trash receptacles) of the Permit.\n                       A.     Commercial Facilities. (Part 4C2a)\n       Restaurants, automotive service facilities, retail gasoline stores and automotive\ndealerships were to be inspected by the permittees twice during the five-year term of the\nPermit, with a minimum of one year between inspections.\n       With respect to restaurants, the Permit required each permittee to inspect all restaurants\nwithin its jurisdiction to confirm that stormwater BMP‘s were being effectively implemented,\nand included verification that the restaurant operator: ―has received educational materials on\nstormwater pollution prevention practices; [¶] []does not pour oil and grease or oil and grease\nresidue onto a parking lot, street or adjacent catch basin; [¶] [] keeps the trash bin area clean\nand trash bin lids closed, and does not fill trash bins with washout water or any other liquid;\n[¶] [] does not allow illicit discharges, such as discharge of washwater from floormats, floors,\nporches, parking lots, alleys, sidewalks and street areas (in the immediate vicinity of the\nestablishment), filters or garbage/trash containers; [¶] [] removes food waste, rubbish or\nother materials from parking lot areas in a sanitary manner that does not create a nuisance or\ndischarge to the storm drain.‖\n\n\n                                                12\n\f       With respect to automotive service facilities, the Permit required that each permittee\n―inspect all automotive service facilities within its jurisdiction to confirm that stormwater\nBMPs are effectively implemented.‖ At each automotive service facility, inspectors were to\nverify that each operator: ―maintains the facility area so that it is clean and dry without\nevidence of excessive staining; [¶] [] implements housekeeping BMPs to prevent spills and\nleaks; [¶] [] properly discharges wastewaters to a sanitary sewer and/or contains wastewaters\nfor transfer to a legal point of disposal; [¶] [] is aware of the prohibition on discharge of non-\nstormwater to the storm drain; [¶] [] properly manages raw and waste materials including\nproper disposal of hazardous waste; [¶] [] protects outdoor work and storage areas to prevent\ncontact of pollutants with rainfall and runoff; [¶] [] labels, inspects, and routinely cleans\nstorm drain inlets that are located on the facility‘s property; and [¶] [] trains employees to\nimplement stormwater pollution prevention practices.‖\n       With respect to retail gasoline outlets and automotive dealerships, the Permit required\neach permittee to confirm that BMP‘s were being effectively implemented at each retail\ngasoline outlet and automotive dealership within its jurisdiction. The permittee was to verify\nthat each operator: ―routinely sweeps fuel-dispensing areas for removal of litter and debris,\nand keeps rags and absorbents ready for use in case of leaks and spills; [¶] [] was aware that\nwashdown of facility area to the storm drain is prohibited; [¶] [] [was] aware of design flaws\n(such as grading that does not prevent run-on, or inadequate roof covers and berms), and that\nequivalent BMP‘s are implemented; [¶] [] inspects and cleans storm drain inlets and catch\nbasins within each facility‘s boundaries no later than October 1st of each year; [¶] [] posts\nsigns close to fuel dispensers, which warn vehicle owners/operators against ‗topping off‘ of\nvehicle fuel tanks and installation of automatic shutoff fuel dispensing nozzles; [¶] []\nroutinely checks outdoor waste receptacle and air/water supply areas, cleans leaks and drips,\nand ensures that only watertight waste receptacles are used and that lids are closed; and [¶] []\ntrains employees to properly manage hazardous materials and wastes as well as to implement\nother stormwater pollution prevention practices.‖\n\n\n\n                                                13\n\f                       B.     Industrial Facilities. (Part 4C2b)\n       Generally, the Permit required inspections twice during the five-year term of the\nPermit, with more than one year between inspections. Each permittee was required to confirm\nthat each operator had ―a current Waste Discharge Identification (WDID) number for facilities\ndischarging stormwater associated with industrial activity, and that a Storm Water Pollution\nPrevention Plan is available on-site,‖ and the facility was effectively implementing the plan.\n                       C.     Construction Facilities. (Part 4E)\n       The Permit required each permittee to implement a program to control runoff from\nconstruction activity: ―Sediments generated on the construction site were to be retained using\nadequate Treatment Control and Structural BMP‘s‖; construction related materials, spills, and\nresidues were to be contained at the construction site to avoid runoff to streets; nonstormwater\nrunoff from equipment and vehicle washing was to be retained at the site; erosion from slopes\nand channels was to be controlled by implementing BMP‘s, such as limiting grading during\nthe wet season, inspecting graded areas during rain, planting and maintenance of slopes, and\ncovering erosion susceptible slopes. For sites one acre or larger, each was to be inspected a\nminimum of once during the wet season.\n                       D.     Trash Receptacles. (Part 4F5c3)\n       The trash receptacle requirement at Part 4, Special Provisions, F. Public Agency\nActivities Program, 5. Storm Drain Operation and Management, c (Part 4F5c3) required trash\nreceptacles to be placed at all transit stops within the permittee‘s jurisdiction. ―Permittees not\n\nsubject to a trash TMDL[6] shall: [¶]…[¶] (3) Place trash receptacles at all transit stops\nwithin its jurisdiction that have shelters no later than August 1, 2002, and at all transit stops\nwithin its jurisdiction no later than February 3, 2003. All trash receptacles shall be maintained\nas necessary.‖\n\n\n\n\n       6 Total Maximum Daily Load, or TMDL, is a calculation of the maximum amount\nof a pollutant that a waterbody can receive and still safely meet water quality standards.\n\n                                                14\n\f               D.      Proceedings Before the Commission\n                       1.       The Hearing\n       In September 2003, the County of Los Angeles and several cities within the county\nfiled a test claim.7 The County sought reimbursement for the inspection requirement of\ncommercial facilities, industrial facilities, and commercial facilities, and the trash receptacle\nrequirement at parts 4C2a, 4C2b, 4E, and 4F5c3 of the Permit. The Commission initially\nrefused jurisdiction over the permit based on Government Code section 17516‘s definition of\n―executive order‖ that excluded permits issued by the State Board or a regional board. In\nCounty of Los Angeles v. Commission on State Mandates (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 898,\nDivision Three of this court held that exclusions of these entities from the definition of an\nexecutive order was unconstitutional. The court issued a writ directing the Commission to\nhear the claim on the merits. (Id. at p. 921.) The county and the cities refiled the test claim in\nOctober and November 2007.\n       The County asserted that it did not have fee authority to collect trash from trash\nreceptacles that must be placed at transit stops. Further, the County asserted it had no\nauthority to collect fees to conduct the inspections, and before the state delegated such\ninspections, the state had performed them. At the hearing on the test claim held July 31, 2009,\nthe County presented evidence consisting of:\n       (1) Several EPA permits for MS4 showed that many of the permits did not contain a\ntrash receptacle requirement;\n       (2) The trash receptacle obligation was new and had not been included in prior permits\nissued by the Regional Board that were approved by the EPA;\n\n       7  Originally, test claims 03-TC-04 (Transit Trash Receptacles) and 03-TC-19\n(Inspection of Industrial/Commercial Facilities) were filed by the County of Los Angeles in\nSeptember 2003. Test claim 03-TC-21 (Stormwater Pollution Requirements) was filed by the\nCities of Baldwin Park, Bellflower, Cerritos, Covina, Downey, Monterey Park, Pico Rivera,\nSignal Hill, South Pasadena, and West Covina on September 30, 2003. Test claim 03-TC-20\n(Waste Discharge Requirements) was filed by Cities of Artesia, Beverly Hills, Carson, La\nMirada, Monrovia, Norwalk, Rancho Palos Verdes, San Marino, and Westlake Village on\nSeptember 30, 2003.\n\n                                                15\n\f       (3) Letters dated April and July 2001 from the EPA assertedly stating that the State of\nCalifornia had the obligation to inspect facilities for state-issued permits;8\n       (4) Evidence that the Regional Board had previously negotiated with the county to pay\nthe county to perform inspections of industrial facilities on the Regional Board‘s behalf—\nbefore the Regional Board imposed that requirement on the county and cities without\npayment.\n       The Department of Finance asserted that the Permit did not impose a reimbursable\nmandate because the Permit conditions imposed on the local agencies were required under the\nNPDES program and were enforceable under the federal Clean Water Act. The Department\nof Finance also argued that the claimants had discretion over the activities and conditions\nincluded in the Permit and thus any resulting costs were ―downstream‖ of the permittee‘s\ndecision to include the provision and hence not state-mandated.\n       The County responded that whether or not an agency places trash receptacles at transit\nstops was not relevant to the mandate determination because if a local agency has been\nincurring costs that are later mandated by the state, such costs are reimbursable as a mandate.\nFurther, the inspection duties were imposed for state-permitted industrial and commercial\nfacilities and construction sites, and the state had been responsible for such inspections since\n1969 under the Porter-Cologne Act; and the inspections were not required under the Clean\nWater Act.\n               2.      The Commission’s Conclusions\n                       (a)    Not Discretionary\n       The Commission found that because the permittees were required by state and federal\nlaw to obtain the Permit, it was not discretionary.\n                       (b)    Not a Federal Mandate\n       The Commission observed that ―[w]hen federal law imposes a mandate on the state,\nhowever, and the state ‗freely [chooses] to impose the costs upon the local agency as a means\n\n       8 The letters state that the local government and the state have a tandem duty to\ninsure inspection requirements are fulfilled.\n\n                                                16\n\fof implementing a federal program, then the costs are the result of a reimbursable state\nmandate regardless whether the costs were imposed upon the state by the federal\ngovernment,‘‖ citing Hayes, supra, 11 Cal.App.4th at page 1593 and Government Code\nsection 17556, subdivision (c).9 Further, the Commission found the state could enforce its\nown water quality laws as long as such laws were as stringent as the Clean Water Act. (33\nU.S.C. § 1342(p)(3)(B)(iii).)\n                                (i)   Trash Receptacles\n       The Commission found the trash receptacle obligation was not a federal mandate\nbecause federal law contained no such requirement, nor did federal law require inspections of\nrestaurants, automotive facilities, or retail gasoline outlets. The Commission observed that\nnothing in the Clean Water Act indicated that California was required to have a NPDES\nprogram or issue stormwater permits; the EPA would require permits if California had no\nsuch program. Further, the plain language of the federal regulation at 40 Code of Federal\nRegulations, part 122.26(d)(2)(iv)(A)(3) was generally worded to require ―[a] description of\npractices for operating and maintaining public streets, roads and highways and procedures for\nreducing the impact on receiving waters of discharges from municipal storm sewer systems,\nincluding pollutants discharged as a result of deicing activities‖ and this language did not\nrequire the permittees to install and maintain trash receptacles at transit stops. The\nCommission relied on Long Beach Unified Sch. Dist. v. State of California (1990) 225\nCal.App.3d 155 (Long Beach Unified) for the proposition that NPDES permits may contain a\nstate mandate even though they are formulated to comply with federal law. In Long Beach\nUnified, Division Five of this court held that although the school district was under a federal\nconstitutional obligation to desegregate schools, the state executive order promulgating\nregulations providing desegregation guidelines to schools was a state mandate because it\n\n       9 Government Code section 17556, subdivision (c), states that the Commission\nshall not find costs mandated by the state if ―[t]he statute or executive order imposes a\nrequirement that is mandated by a federal law or regulation and results in costs mandated\nby the federal government, unless the statute or executive order mandates costs that\nexceed the mandate in that federal law or regulation.‖\n\n                                               17\n\frequired specific actions to be taken that went beyond the federal constitutional obligation as\nset forth in case law. (Long Beach Unified, at p. 173.) The Commission found that as in Long\nBeach Unified, the Permit‘s mandates went beyond federal requirements and thus constituted\na state mandate.\n                              (ii)    Inspection Requirement.\n       With respect to the inspection obligations of commercial, industrial and construction\nfacilities, the Commission analyzed the requirements of 40 Code of Federal Regulations, part\n122.26(d)(2)(iv)(B) and (C). Those sections generally required the ―description of a program,\nincluding inspections, to implement and enforce an ordinance, orders or similar means to\nprevent illicit discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system,‖ (40 C.F.R.\n§ 122.26(d)(2)(iv)(B)(1)), or a requirement that permittees ―[i]dentify priorities and\nprocedures for inspections and establishing and implementing control measures for such\ndischarges.‖ (40 C.F.R. § 122.26(d)(2)(iv)(C)(1)). However, the federal regulations\ncontained no express requirement to inspect restaurants, automotive service facilities, retail\ngasoline stations, automobile dealerships, or construction and industrial sites. Thus, this\nrequirement was not a federal mandate.\n       The Commission also found that this same language in 40 Code of Federal\nRegulations, part 122.26(d)(2)(iv)(B)(1) and (C)(1) did not prevent the state, rather than local\nagencies, from inspecting industrial facilities. The statewide GIASP was administered by the\nState Board, and the State Board collected fees for the regional boards for performing\nobligations under the GIASP pursuant to Water Code section 13260, subd. (d)(2)(B)(ii). The\nCommission found that ―[i]nasmuch as the federal regulation (40 C.F.R. § 122.26(c))\nauthorizes coverage under a statewide general permit for the inspections of industrial\nactivities, and the federal regulation (40 C.F.R. § 122.26(d)(2)(iv)(D)) does not expressly\nrequire those inspections to be performed by the county or cities (or the ‗owner or operator of\nthe discharge‘), . . . the state has freely chosen to impose these activities on the permittees‖\nand no federal mandate existed. (Fn. omitted.)\n\n\n\n                                                18\n\f                 (c)    ―New Program‖ or ―Higher Level of Service‖\n          With respect to whether the Permit requirements ―imposed a new program or a higher\nlevel of service,‖ the Commission observed that to determine whether the permit is a new\nprogram or higher level of service, it needed to compare the Permit to the legal requirements\nin effect immediately before its adoption. In that regard, the Commission found that local\nagencies were not required by state or federal law to place and maintain trash receptacles at\ntransit stops before the permit was adopted, as a result, it was a new program or higher level\nof service to place trash receptacles at transit stops and maintain them as specified in the\npermit.\n          For the same reason, the Commission found that the inspections and enforcement\nduties at industrial and commercial facilities, including restaurants, automotive service\nfacilities, retail gasoline outlets, and automotive dealerships, was a new program or higher\nlevel of service because these were not required activities of the permittees prior to the\npermit‘s adoption.\n          E.     Proceedings Before the Trial Court\n                 1.     Petition and Cross-Petition\n          On February 17, 2011, the Department of Finance, the State Board, and the Regional\nBoard filed a petition for administrative mandamus pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure\nsection 1094.5 against the Commission, with the County of Los Angeles and the cities of\nArtesia, Azusa, Bellflower, Beverly Hills, Carson, Commerce, Covina, Downey, Monterey\nPark, Norwalk, Rancho Palos Verdes, Signal Hill, Vernon, and Westlake Village as real\nparties in interest.\n          The Department of Finance argued that that the Permit was a federal mandate and not\nsubject to subvention because California‘s administration of the mandate did not transform the\nClean Water Act requirements into a state mandate. Under City of Sacramento, supra, 50\nCal.3d at pages 73–74, ―certain regulatory standards imposed by the federal government\nunder ‗cooperative federalism‘ schemes are coercive on the states and localities in every\npractical sense‖; similarly here, the NDPES program was coercive on the state and local\n\n\n                                               19\n\fgovernments because regardless of whether the state or the EPA issued the Permit, it was not\nvoluntary because the County had to comply with the maximum extent practicable standards\nand thus the Permit did not constitute a shifting of state costs to localities. Congress\nestablished the maximum extent practicable standard because municipal storm water runoff,\nunlike other pollutant discharges, could not be adequately addressed by blanket effluent\nlimitations. Thus, the Commission erred in ignoring this standard and by looking solely to\nfederal statutes and regulations to define the scope of federal law. Finally, the Department of\nFinance argued the Regional Board‘s findings regarding what was necessary to implement the\nmaximum extent practicable standard had previously been litigated in County of Los Angeles\nv. State Water Resources Control Bd. (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 985 and previously upheld by\nDivision Five.\n       The County argued that it did not have fee authority to pay for the trash receptacles or\nthe inspections, and the State Board‘s fee for inspections of industrial and construction\nfacilities preempted any fee the County might charge. The cities of Bellflower, Carson,\nCommerce, Covina, Downey and Signal Hill argued that the Commission properly applied the\nmaximum extent practicable standard; whether the activities constituted a state mandate was\nwithin the Commission‘s purview, not the Regional Board‘s, and the Commission‘s decision\nwas supported by substantial evidence. With respect to industrial facilities, the State Board\nalready administered such facilities through the state-wide GIASP, which required the state to\nenforce its provisions; the State Board could collect fees to cover inspections of such\nfacilities, the Regional Board entered into a contract in 2001 whereby the Regional Board paid\nthe County to conduct inspections; and the plain language of the governing statutes and\nregulations do not require inspections. With respect to construction sites, the State Board\nalready administered such facilities through the state-wide GCASP, which is enforced by the\nstate and authorizes the State Board to collect fees for inspections; the inspection obligation\nwas not in prior permits, and the plain language of the governing statutes and regulations do\nnot require inspections.\n\n\n\n                                                20\n\f       In reply, the Department asserted that the maximum extent practicable standard\ngoverned whether the mandate was of federal or state origin, and there was no evidence the\nPermit requirements went beyond federal law. The mere fact the standard was flexible did not\nmean that the Permit exceeded those standards, and asserted the EPA requirements were not\ndeterminative under the Clean Water Act because under federal law, each permit must be\ntailored to the unique surroundings of the waterways: the language of Title 33 United States\nCode section 1342(p)(3)(B)(iii) contemplates that, because of the fundamentally different\ncharacteristics of many municipalities, municipalities will have permits tailored to meet\nparticular geographical, hydrological, and climactic conditions. (55 Fed. Reg. 47990, 48053\n(Nov. 16, 1990).) Further, the fact prior permits did not have the requirements of the most\nrecent permit was not relevant because a new permit must be at least as stringent as the prior\none (33 U.S.C. § 1342(o); 40 C.F.R. § 122.44(l)), and the EPA anticipates that stormwater\nmanagement will evolve over time.\n       The County of Los Angeles and the cities of Bellflower, Carson, Commerce, Covina,\nDowney and Signal Hill filed a cross-petition10 for writ of administrative mandamus,\nchallenging the Commission‘s finding that although the inspection requirements of parts\n4C2a, 4C2b, and 4E were state mandates, the County had the authority to levy fees pursuant to\nGovernment Code section 17556, subdivision (d) to pay for such programs and was thus not\nentitled to subvention.\n               2.     Trial Court’s Statement of Decision\n       On August 15, 2011, the trial court issued its statement of decision in which it found\nthe trash receptacle requirement was a federal mandate. The trial court rejected the\nCommission‘s conclusion that the state freely chose to implement the NPDES permit as\nlegally incorrect because the fact that California was not required to issue permits and\nvoluntarily did so did not lead to the conclusion the NPDES program was optional and thus\nmandated by the state. The trial court rejected the argument that there needed to be a federal\n\n       10The petition and cross-petition were initially filed in Sacramento County, but\nwere transferred to Los Angeles County.\n\n                                               21\n\fregulation particularly on point for the activity to be mandated because such an argument\nignored and misplaced the flexibility built into the federal maximum extent practicable\nstandard. Thus, the trial court found the Commission erred in isolating specific requirements\nto conclude that the Permit was a state mandate because one permit provision could not\nexceed the maximum extent practicable standard where the Regional Board had concluded the\npermit as a whole did not. The failure to include these provisions in prior permits did not\nconvert the requirements into state mandates due to the evolving nature of the Clean Water\nAct‘s requirements. Further, the inspection requirements were likewise pursuant to the\nmaximum extent practicable standard of the Clean Water Act and hence federal mandates. ―A\nfederal mandate does not require explicit mention of every mandated activity. Rather, the\nrelevant inquiry is whether these inspection activities fall within the Clean Water Act‘s\nmaximum extent practicable standard. As there is nothing in the record to suggest that they\nexceed this standard, the Commission‘s conclusions to the contrary must fail.‖ The trial court\ndid not address the County‘s cross-petition, but noted that it would fail for the same reasons as\nthe petition.11\n       The court entered judgment granting the petition, and remanded the matter to the\nCommission to set aside and vacate its decision.\n                                        DISCUSSION\nI.     Standard of Review\n       In reviewing the Commission‘s decision under Code of Civil Procedure section\n1094.5, the trial court determines whether the agency proceeded in excess of jurisdiction,\nthere was a fair hearing, and there was any prejudicial abuse of discretion. (Code Civ. Proc.,\n§ 1094.5, subd. (b).) Abuse of discretion is established if the Commission has not proceeded\nin the manner required by law, the order or decision is not supported by the findings, or its\nfindings are not supported by substantial evidence. (Voices of the Wetlands v. State Water\n\n\n\n\n       11   The County does not challenge the denial of the cross-petition in this appeal.\n\n                                               22\n\fResources Control Bd. (2011) 52 Cal.4th 499, 516; Fukuda v. City of Angels (1999) 20\nCal.4th 805, 810.)\n       We presume the Commission‘s findings and actions are supported by substantial\nevidence. (Desmond v. County of Contra Costa (1993) 21 Cal.App.4th 330, 335–336;\nMcAllister v. California Coastal Com. (2008) 169 Cal.App.4th 912, 921–922.) We resolve all\nconflicts in the evidence and draw all legitimate and reasonable inferences in favor of the\ndecision made by the trial court. Where the evidence supports multiple inferences, we may\nnot substitute our deductions for those made by the trial court. The trial court‘s factual\nfindings only may be disturbed if the evidence, as a matter of law, is insufficient to support\nthem. (Arthur v. Department of Motor Vehicles (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1199, 1205.)\n       The trial court‘s conclusions and disposition of the issues are not conclusive, and we\nand the trial court ―must determine whether the record is free from legal error.‖ (Alberstone v.\nCalifornia Coastal Com. (2008) 169 Cal.App.4th 859, 863.) We examine the interpretation of\nlegal matters utilizing a de novo standard of review. (County of Los Angeles v. State Water\nResources Control Bd., supra, 143 Cal.App.4th at p. 997.)\nII.    Federal Mandates and “Maximum Extent Practicable”\n       The County contends that the trial court erred in finding that the Permit obligations\nwere federal mandates because (1) the court in County of Los Angeles v. Commission on State\nMandates, supra, 150 Cal.App.4th 898, previously determined the mandate issue; (2) the trial\ncourt erred in finding that the Commission failed to consider the maximum extent practicable\nstandard; and (3) the Commission‘s decision is supported by substantial evidence.\n       Specifically, the County argues that the trial court failed to analyze whether the\nRegional Board specifically included certain activities not required by the federal regulations,\nand erred in failing to do so because the relevant federal regulations do not require\ninspections. The County asserts that in Long Beach Unified, supra, 225 Cal.App.3d 155, the\ncourt held that a state mandate may arise if the state, in implementing a federal requirement,\nrequires specific actions and imposes additional burdens on a local agency beyond the federal\nrequirements. (Id. at pp. 172–173.) As a result, the County contends, the Permit‘s inspection\n\n\n                                               23\n\fobligations exceeded the scope of the federal regulations, both in number and required content\nof the inspections as well as the type of facilities to be inspected. (See, e.g., 40 C.F.R.\n122.26(d)(2)(iv)(B), (C) & (D).) Further, in Hayes, the court held that even where federal law\nimposes a mandate, if the state freely chooses to shift responsibility for compliance from itself\nto a local agency, the resulting costs are a state mandate regardless of whether the costs were\nimposed upon the state by the federal government. (Hayes, supra, 11 Cal.App.4th at\npp. 1593–1594.) However, the County contends, the trial court failed to apply this analysis,\nand if it had, it would have found that the Regional Board had a choice whether to impose the\ninspection obligations. First, under the Porter-Cologne Act, the Regional Board had the\nauthority to regulate the discharge of pollutants into waterways. (See, e.g., Wat. Code,\n§§ 13050, subds. (d), (e), 13260, 13263.) In addition, the Porter-Cologne Act authorizes the\nRegional Board to require any person to furnish technical and monitoring reports describing\ndischarges into waterways. (See Wat. Code, § 13267, subds. (b), (c).) The Porter-Cologne\nAct does not exempt commercial, industrial, or construction facilities from its reach. Finally,\nthe Regional Board had the obligation to enforce the GIASP and GCASP pertaining to\nconstruction and industrial sites, which contain provisions for inspections. Under both GIASP\nand GCASP, the state can impose inspection fees. (See, e.g., Wat. Code, § 13260,\nsubd. (d)(1)(A).)\n       The Department of Finance contends that the trial court correctly found that reliance\non Long Beach Unified, supra, 225 Cal.App.3d 155 was misplaced because in that case, a\nstate mandate was found because there was no federal law specifying how desegregation of\nschools should take place. (Id. at p. 173.) In contrast, applicable to the Permit is the Clean\nWater Act specifying the maximum extent practicable standard, and the Commission was\nrequired to analyze the federal maximum extent practicable standard, which it did not. In\naddition, the Department of Finance argues that the Regional Board‘s duty to inspect facilities\ndoes not substitute for the County‘s‘ obligations under an NPDES permit, and the state‘s\ninspection obligations under GIASP and GCASP impose independent duties to perform\ncompliance inspections.\n\n\n                                                24\n\f       A.     Holding of County of Los Angeles v. Commission on State Mandates\n       The County contends that in County of Los Angeles v. Commission on State Mandates,\nsupra, 150 Cal.App.4th 898, the first time this court addressed this case, the Regional Board\nargued that the trash receptacle and inspection obligations were federal mandates as a matter\nof law, contending that ―the federal mandate nature of its NPDES permits remains constant\nalthough it exercises discretion to control the discharge of pollutants through municipal\nstormwater programs not appearing in federal regulations.‖ (Id. at p. 914.) However, the\nCounty contends the court in County of Los Angeles v. Commission on State Mandates\nrejected these arguments, finding that because an NPDES permit could contain both federal\nand state requirements, whether the requirements constituted state or federal mandates was a\nfact question which must be addressed by the Commission. (Id. at pp. 917–918.) As a result\nof this holding, the County contends that this court has already rejected the federal mandate\nargument as a matter of law. The Department of Finance argues that the Commission should\nhave deferred to both the Regional Board‘s findings in designing the Permit and the prior\njudicial review of those findings. (See County of Los Angeles v. State Water Resources\nControl Bd., supra, 143 Cal.App.4th at p. 997.) The Commission, while an expert in\nmandate, is not an expert in water quality law.\n       We disagree. First, County of Los Angeles v. Commission on State Mandates, supra,\n150 Cal.App.4th 898 did not address the issue of state mandates. The County and certain\ncities filed a test claim challenging the Permit. The Commission returned the claims\nunadjudicated because they did not involve an executive order subject to subvention under\nGovernment Code section 17516, subdivision (c). (Commission on State Mandates, at\npp. 903–904.) On appeal, the court addressed whether section 17516, subdivision (c) was\nunconstitutional because it expressly exempted the Regional Board from the constitutional\nstate mandate subvention requirement. (Commission on State Mandates, at p. 904.) After\nconcluding that the statute was unconstitutional (id. at pp. 919–920), the court of appeal found\nthe trial court properly issued a writ of mandate directing the Commission to review the test\nclaims. (Id. at p. 921.) As the court did not address the issue of mandates, or make any\n\n\n                                              25\n\ffindings regarding the Permit, County of Los Angeles v. Commission on State Mandates is not\nbinding on this court. (See Boeken v. Philip Morris USA, Inc. (2010) 48 Cal.4th 788, 797.)\n       B.      The Maximum Extent Practicable Standard\n       The County argues that trial court erred in finding that the Commission failed to\nconsider the maximum extent practicable standard in making its ruling.12 The County asserts\nthe federal regulations are quite specific; with respect to others, the regulations are more\nflexible and leave the design of the permit to the permittees. Thus, according to the County,\nthe general language of the regulations permits flexibility in designing programs; however,\nwhen the Regional Board demands a specific activity, it removes that flexibility and creates a\nmandate. Similarly, amicus CSQA asserts that the federal regulations at issue are flexible and\npermit the local agencies to identify and propose the components of the program that they\nbelieve are appropriate for meeting the maximum extent practicable standard. Here, the 2001\nPermit removed such flexibility because it included new specific terms and conditions not\nfound in the prior permits, similar to the situation in Long Beach Unified. Amicus Building\nIndustry asserts that the EPA‘s reserved veto power does not transform the Regional Board‘s\nexercise of discretion into a federal mandate.\n\n\n       12 As a threshold concern, the County asserts that the trial court erroneously\nasserted that the MEP standard was a ―technology-forcing requirement designed to foster\ninnovation,‖ citing Chemical Manufacturer’s Assn. v. NRDC (1985) 470 U.S. 116, 155–\n156. We disagree. As explained in Pronsolino v. Marcus (N.D. Cal. 2000) 91 F.Supp.2d\n1337, ―[t]he 1972 [Clean Water] Act represented a major shift in enforcement policy—\naway from primary reliance on water-quality standards and toward primary reliance on\nspecific effluent limits on all point sources, the latter being any discernible, confined and\ndiscrete conveyance such as a pipe or ditch. [Citation] The [Clean Water] Act\nestablished the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (‗NPDES‘) and required\nan NPDES permit for any discharge by any point source into any navigable water of the\nUnited States, interstate or intrastate. The new strategy sought to force the best\ntechnology practicable or achievable on dischargers. . . . Instead of solely working\nbackwards from the water-quality standards to develop acceptable levels of effluent from\npoint sources, the new lead strategy was to require point sources to employ state-of-the-\nart treatment, even if it led, as a happy circumstance, to even cleaner water than called for\nby the standards.‖ (Id. at p. 1341.)\n\n                                                 26\n\f       The Department of Finance counters that the Commission‘s analysis ignored the\nmaximum extent practicable standard entirely. Instead, the Commission looked only to\nwhether federal law specifically required certain individual measures to be in the Permit. As a\nresult, the Commission‘s analysis erroneously found that where the federal regulations\nimposed a flexible standard, any state action to implement the federal mandate is\nautomatically converted into a state mandate.\n               1.     Federal Mandates\n       The subvention requirement of article XIII B, section 6 is triggered if ―the Legislature\nor any state agency‖ mandates a new program or higher level of service. (Cal. Const., art.\nXIII B, § 6.) Subvention is inapplicable where the additional costs on local governments are\nimposed by a federal mandate, i.e., the federal government. Article XIII B, section 9,\nsubdivision (b), defines federally mandated appropriations as those ―required to comply with\nmandates of the courts or the federal government which, without discretion, require an\nexpenditure for additional services or which unavoidably make the provision of existing\nservices more costly.‖ In 1980, after the adoption of article XIII B, the Legislature amended\nthe statutory definition of ―costs mandated by the federal government‖ to provide that such\ncosts included ―‗costs resulting from enactment of a state law or regulation where failure to\nenact such law or regulation to meet specific federal program or service requirements would\nresult in substantial monetary penalties or loss of funds to public or private persons in the\nstate.‘‖ (City of Sacramento, supra, 50 Cal.3d at p. 75, italics omitted.)\n       As the case before us demonstrates, there is no precise rule or formula for determining\nwhether a cost imposed on a local government or agency is a federal mandate. ―Given the\nvariety of cooperative federal-state-local programs, we here attempt no final test for\n‗mandatory‘ versus ‗optional‘ compliance with federal law. A determination in each case\nmust depend on such factors as the nature and purpose of the federal program; whether its\ndesign suggests an intent to coerce; when state and/or local participation began; the penalties,\nif any, assessed for withdrawal or refusal to participate or comply; and any other legal and\npractical consequences of nonparticipation, noncompliance, or withdrawal. Always, the\n\n\n                                                27\n\fcourts and the Commission must respect the governing principle of article XIII B, section\n9(b): neither state nor local agencies may escape their spending limits when their participation\nin federal programs is truly voluntary.‖ (City of Sacramento, supra, 50 Cal.3d at p. 76.)\n       In Hayes, supra, 11 Cal.App.4th 1564, two county school superintendents sought\nreimbursement for costs incurred in connection with state special education programs enacted\nin 1977 and 1980.13 (Id. at pp. 1570–1574.) The counties asserted that the state statutes\nimposed special education requirements in excess of the federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973\nand the subsequent Education of the Handicapped Act. (Hayes, at pp. 1574–1575.) The\nBoard of Control (precursor to the Commission) determined that federal statutes were\ndiscretionary, and that the state statutes imposed state-mandated costs in excess of the federal\nprograms. (Id. at p. 1576.) Hayes observed that ―[i]n order to gain state and local acceptance\nof its substantive provisions, the Education of the Handicapped Act employs a ‗cooperative\nfederalism‘ scheme, which has also been referred to as the ‗carrot and stick‘ approach.\n[Citations.] As an incentive Congress made substantial federal financial assistance available\nto states and local educational agencies that would agree to adhere to the substantive and\nprocedural terms of the act.‖ (Id. at p. 1588.)\n       Finding that the Education of the Handicapped Act imposed a federal mandate under\nCity of Sacramento, Hayes recognized that while the Education of the Handicapped Act\nincluded certain substantive and procedural requirements which must be included in a state‘s\nplan for implementation of the act, it left primary responsibility for implementation to the\nstate. ―In short, even though the state had no real choice in deciding whether to comply with\nthe federal act, the act did not necessarily require the state to impose all of the costs of\nimplementation upon local school districts. To the extent the state implemented the act by\nfreely choosing to impose new programs or higher levels of service upon local school\ndistricts, the costs of such programs or higher levels of service are state mandated and subject\nto subvention.‖ (Hayes, supra, 11 Cal.App.4th at p. 1594.)\n\n\n       13   Statutes 1977, chapter 1247 and Statutes 1980, chapter 797.\n\n                                                  28\n\f       In Long Beach Unified, supra, 225 Cal.App.3d 155, the state issued an executive order\nadopting regulations providing guidelines for school districts to desegregate their schools. (Id.\nat p. 165.) The Long Beach Unified School District claimed the costs associated with the\norder were state mandates, even though the school district was under a federal constitutional\nobligation to desegregate. (Id. at pp. 163, 172.) In spite of this federal constitutional mandate,\nLong Beach Unified found a state mandate because the requirements of the executive order\nwent beyond constitutional and case law requirements because while courts had suggested\nthat certain steps and approaches may be helpful in complying with federal law, the executive\norder and guidelines required specific actions. ―For example, school districts are to conduct\nmandatory biennial racial and ethnic surveys, develop a ‗reasonably feasible‘ plan every four\nyears to alleviate and prevent segregation, include certain specific elements in each plan, and\ntake mandatory steps to involve the community, including public hearings which have been\nadvertised in a specific manner.‖ While these steps fit within the federal constitutional\n―reasonably feasible‖ standard of United States Supreme Court cases, the steps were ―no\nlonger merely being suggested as options which the local school district may wish to consider\nbut are required acts. These requirements constitute a higher level of service.‖ (Id. at p. 173.)\n               2.     The Maximum Extent Practicable Standard\n       Title 33 United States Code section 1342(p)(3)(B)(iii) provides that permits for\ndischarges from municipal storm sewers ―shall require controls to reduce the discharge of\npollutants to the maximum extent practicable, including management practices, control\ntechniques and system, design and engineering methods, and such other provisions as the\nAdministrator or the State determines appropriate for the control of such pollutants.‖\n       The evolution of this section, and the concept of maximum extent practicable, were\ndiscussed at length in Building Industry, supra, 124 Cal.App.4th 866, which observed that\nwhen ―Congress first enacted the Federal Water Pollution Control Act in 1948, it relied\nprimarily on state and local enforcement efforts to remedy water pollution problems.\n[Citations.] However, by the early 1970‘s it became apparent that this reliance on local\nenforcement was ineffective and had resulted in the ‗acceleration of environmental\n\n\n                                               29\n\fdegradation of rivers, lakes, and streams . . . . [Citations.] In response, in 1972 Congress\nsubstantially amended [the Clean Water Act] by mandating compliance with various\nminimum technological effluent standards established by the federal government and creating\na comprehensive regulatory scheme to implement these laws. [Citation.] The objective of\nthis law . . . was to ‗restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the\nNation‘s waters.‘‖ (Building Industry, supra, 124 Cal.App.4th at p. 872; 33 U.S.C.\n§ 1251(a).)\n         As enacted in 1972, the Clean Water Act mandated that an NPDES permit require\ncompliance with state water quality standards and that this goal be met by setting forth a\nspecific ―effluent limitation,‖ which is a restriction on the amount of pollutants that may be\ndischarged at the point source. (33 U.S.C. §§ 1311, 136(11).) Shortly after the 1972\nlegislation, the EPA promulgated regulations exempting most municipal storm sewers from\nthe NPDES permit requirements. However, the District of Columbia Circuit held a storm\nsewer is a point source and the EPA did not have the authority to exempt categories of point\nsources from the Clean Water Act‘s NPDES permit requirements. (Natural Resources\nDefense Council, Inc. v. Costle (D.C. Cir. 1977) 568 F.2d 1369, 1374–1377.) Costle rejected\nthe EPA‘s argument that effluent-based storm sewer regulation was administratively\ninfeasible because of the variable nature of storm water pollution and the number of affected\nstorm sewers throughout the country. Although Costle acknowledged the practical problems\nrelating to storm sewer regulation, the court found the EPA had the flexibility under the Clean\nWater Act to design regulations that would overcome these problems. (Costle, at pp. 1377–\n1383.)\n         During the next 15 years, the EPA made numerous attempts to reconcile the statutory\nrequirement of point source regulation with the practical problem of regulating possibly\nmillions of diverse point source discharges of storm water. Eventually, in 1987, Congress\namended the Clean Water Act to add provisions that specifically concerned NPDES permit\nrequirements for storm sewer discharges. (33 U.S.C. § 1342(p).) In these amendments,\nenacted as part of the Water Quality Act of 1987, Congress distinguished between industrial\n\n\n                                                30\n\fand municipal storm water discharges. With respect to municipal storm water discharges,\nCongress clarified that the EPA had the authority to fashion NPDES permit requirements to\nmeet water quality standards without specific numerical effluent limits and instead to impose\n―controls to reduce the discharge of pollutants to the maximum extent practicable . . . .‖ (33\nU.S.C. § 1342(p)(3)(B)(iii); Building Industry, supra, 124 Cal.App.4th at p. 884.)\n       Building Industry, supra, 124 Cal.App.4th 866 observed that section\n1342(p)(3)(B)(iii)‘s statutory language and legislative history showed that Congress added the\nNPDES storm sewer requirements to strengthen the Clean Water Act by making its mandate\ncorrespond to the practical realities of municipal storm sewer regulation. ―[A]lthough\nCongress was reacting to the physical differences between municipal storm water runoff and\nother pollutant discharges that made the 1972 legislation‘s blanket effluent limitations\napproach impractical and administratively burdensome, the primary point of the legislation\nwas to address these administrative problems while giving the administrative bodies the tools\nto meet the fundamental goals of the Clean Water Act in the context of stormwater pollution.\n[Citations.] This legislative history supports that in identifying a maximum extent practicable\nstandard Congress did not intend to substantively bar the EPA/state agency from imposing a\nmore stringent water quality standard if the agency, based on its expertise and technical\nfactual information and after the required administrative hearing procedure, found this\nstandard to be a necessary and workable enforcement mechanism to achieving the goals of the\nClean Water Act.‖ (Building Industry, at p. 884.)\n       Building Industry, supra, 124 Cal.App.4th 866 concluded, ―The federal maximum\nextent practicable standard is not defined in the Clean Water Act or applicable\nregulations . . . . [T]he maximum extent practicable standard is a highly flexible concept that\ndepends on balancing numerous factors, including the particular control‘s technical feasibility,\ncost, public acceptance, regulatory compliance, and effectiveness. . . . [The] maximum extent\npracticable standard is a term of art, and is not a phrase that can be interpreted solely by\nreference to its everyday or dictionary meaning.‖ (Id. at p. 889.)\n\n\n\n                                                31\n\f       The maximum extent practicable standard is necessarily flexible given the interplay\nbetween state and federal law and the unique issues presented by large municipal storm sewer\nsystems. The Clean Water Act uses two water-quality-performance standards by which a\ndischarger of water may be evaluated: ―effluent limitations‖ and ―water quality standards.‖\n(Arkansas v. Oklahoma, supra, 503 U.S. at p. 101.) An effluent limitation is ―any restriction\nestablished by a State or the [EPA] Administrator on quantities, rates, and concentrations of\nchemical, physical, biological, and other constituents which are discharged from point sources\ninto navigable waters . . . .‖ (33 U.S.C. § 1362(11).) An effluent limitation guideline is\ndetermined in light of ―‗the best practicable control technology currently available.‘‖ (Our\nChildren’s Earth Foundation v. U.S. E.P.A. (9th Cir. 2008) 527 F.3d 842, 849 quoting 33\nU.S.C. § 1311(b)(1)(A).)\n       On the other hand, water-quality standards are state-based and are used as a\nsupplementary basis for effluent limitations, so that numerous dischargers, despite their\nindividual compliance with technology-based limitations, can be regulated to prevent water\nquality from falling below acceptable levels. (PUD No. 1 of Jefferson County, supra, 511\nU.S. at p. 704.) Water-quality standards are developed in a two-step process. First, the EPA,\nor state water authorities establish a waterway‘s ―‗[b]eneficial use.‘‖ (Wat. Code, § 13050,\nsubd. (f); Natural Resources Defense Council v. U.S.E.P.A. (4th Cir. 1993) 16 F.3d 1395,\n1400.) Once the beneficial use is determined, water quality criteria that will yield the desired\nwater conditions are formulated and implemented. (See Natural Resources Defense Council,\nat p. 1400; see also 33 U.S.C. § 1313(a), (c)(2)(A); 40 C.F.R. § 131.3(i).)\n       Unlike effluent limitations, which are promulgated by the EPA to achieve a certain\nlevel of pollution reduction in light of available technology, water-quality standards emanate\nfrom the state boards charged with managing their domestic water resources. (See Arkansas\nv. Oklahoma, supra, 503 U.S. at p. 101.) The EPA gives the states guidance in drafting water-\nquality standards and ―state authorities periodically review water quality standards and secure\nthe EPA‘s approval of any revisions in the standards.‖ (Ibid.)\n\n\n\n                                               32\n\f       Finally, the maximum extent practicable standard is designed to require states to meet\ntheir Clean Water Act obligations. In Environmental Defense Center, Inc. v. U.S.E.P.A. (9th\nCir. 2003) 344 F.3d 832 (Environmental Defense Center), the Ninth Circuit considered a\nchallenge to a ―Phase II‖ EPA rule for small municipal storm sewer systems. Among other\nthings, the Phase II Rule allowed small municipal storm sewer systems to seek permission to\ndischarge pollutants by submitting an individualized set of best management practices\ndesigned by each municipal storm sewer system (―stormwater management plans‖), either in\nthe form of an individual permit application or in the form of a notice of intent (NOI) to\ncomply with a general permit. (Id. at p. 842.) As long as an NOI included a stormwater\nmanagement plan, the EPA deemed a municipal storm sewer system to be in compliance with\nthe relevant standards of the Clean Water Act, including the standard that municipal\nstormwater pollution be reduced to the ―maximum extent practicable.‖ (Id. at p. 855; 33\nU.S.C. § 1342(p)(3)(B)(iii); 40 C.F.R. § 123.35.) The Phase II Rule did not require NPDES\nauthorities to review the stormwater management plans themselves. The Ninth Circuit held,\nhowever, that the failure to require permitting authority review of the stormwater management\nplans violated the Clean Water Act. While the Ninth Circuit lauded the involvement of\nregulated parties in the development of individual stormwater pollution control programs, it\nemphasized that ―programs that are designed by regulated parties must, in every instance, be\nsubject to meaningful review by an appropriate regulating entity to ensure that each such\nprogram reduces the discharge of pollutants to the maximum extent practicable [i.e., the\nrelevant statutory standard].‖ (Environmental Defense Center, at p. 856.) The Phase II Rule,\nby contrast, failed to require that the relevant permitting authorities review the stormwater\nmanagement plans to ―ensure that the measures that any given operator of a [small municipal\nstorm sewer system] has decided to undertake will in fact reduce discharges to the maximum\nextent practicable.‖ (Id. at p. 855.) Accordingly, Environmental Defense Center held the\nPhase II Rule provided no safeguard against a municipal storm sewer system‘s\n―misunderstanding or misrepresenting its own stormwater situation and proposing a set of\nminimum measures for itself that would reduce discharges by far less than the maximum\n\n\n                                               33\n\fextent practicable.‖ (Ibid.) The Ninth Circuit concluded that the EPA‘s failure to require\nreview of NOI‘s and the EPA‘s failure to make NOI‘s available to the public or subject to\npublic hearings contravened the express requirements of the Clean Water Act, and vacated\nthose portions of the Phase II Rule that addressed procedural issues relating to the issuance of\nNOI‘s under the small municipal storm sewer general permit option, and remanded to the\nEPA to permit the EPA to take appropriate action to comply with the Clean Water Act. (Id. at\npp. 858, 879.)\n       Balancing the standards of Building Industry, supra, 124 Cal.App.4th 866, we\nconclude the Permit‘s requirements for the trash receptacles and inspection of\ncommercial, industrial, and construction sites as a matter of law constitute federal\nmandates. We do not disagree with the holdings of Hayes, supra, 11 Cal.App.4th 1564\nand Long Beach Unified, supra, 225 Cal.App.3d 155 that as a general proposition, where a\nstate goes beyond a federal law and imposes additional state-based requirements, a state\nmandate may exist to the extent federal law is exceeded. However, Title 33 United States\nCode section 1342(p)(3)(B)(iii) is a unique statute and imposes a broad standard in\nrecognition of developing clean water technology; thus, general-purpose mandate analysis\nis of limited utility in the area of clean water law precisely because the Clean Water Act\nrecognizes that the states function, for practical purposes, as arms of the EPA in\nimplementing the Clean Water Act. Thus, when a state implements the federal maximum\nextent practicable standard in an NPDES permit, we cannot say the state is acting in the\ntraditional governmental role of a state; rather, although the state provides the\ninfrastructure necessary to meet clean water standards, it acts on behalf of the EPA in\ndoing so.\n       The EPA‘s oversight and veto control of the NPDES program, and the Clean Water\nAct‘s goal of permitting each locality to fashion the appropriate measure to address pollution\nproblems by applying evolving clean water technology, convince us that Building Industry,\nsupra, 124 Cal.App.4th 866 guides us in evaluating, for purposes of subvention analysis, what\nthe state may put in its NDPES permit to meet the maximum extent practicable standard and\n\n\n                                               34\n\fwhat the federal government requires. The states and local agencies are required by their own\nunique waterway conditions to adopt requirements to alleviate pollution; the federal\nregulations recognize that the federal government has a limited role in specifying what the\nspecific measures must be.\n       Administrative agency decisions come to court with a strong presumption of\ncorrectness based on Evidence Code section 664 that ―official duty has been regularly\nperformed.‖ (Fukuda v. City of Angels, supra, 20 Cal.4th at p. 812.) ―‗Obviously,\nconsiderable weight should be given to the findings of experienced administrative bodies\nmade after a full and formal hearing, especially in cases involving technical and scientific\nevidence.‘‖ (Ibid., quoting Drummey v. State Bd. of Funeral Directors (1939) 13 Cal.2d\n75, 86.) Inherent in a Regional Board‘s determination is a recognition that the specific action\nrequirements under the Permit have been decided to be within the ―maximum extent\npracticable‖ standard of the Clean Water Act. However, this is not to say that any action\nrequirement that might advance the objectives of the Clean Water Act is automatically within\nthe maximum extent practicable standard.\n       In reviewing whether particular mandates fall within the maximum extent practicable\nstandard, with respect to the trash receptacle and inspection provisions at issue, we apply\nBuilding Industry, supra, 124 Cal.App.4th 866 and balance numerous factors, including the\nparticular requirement‘s technical feasibility, cost, public acceptance, regulatory compliance,\nand effectiveness. (Id. at p. 889.) Trash receptacles are a simple method of keeping\nstormwater clean because they prevent trash and other debris from entering storm drains and\nentering the ocean and local rivers and drainage canals. Inspections to insure that the\ncommercial, industrial and construction sites likewise maintain careful practices to prevent\nstormwater from becoming contaminated is a first line of defense; indeed, insuring\ncompliance in these areas places some of the burden for maintaining clean water on private\nparties. As a result, those provisions further the state Clean Water Act goal of reducing\npollution to the maximum extent practicable and thus constitute federal mandates. However,\n\n\n\n                                               35\n\fgiven the flexibility and mutability of the maximum extent practicable standard, of necessity\nour decision is limited to the specific mandates addressed here.\n       The County argues that the Regional Board is empowered to enforce the provisions of\nthe state-issued GIASP and GCASP and to charge fees for inspections under Water Code\nsection 13260, subdivision (d), and shifted this obligation to the County by including the\ninspection requirements in the Permit. We disagree that the Permit improperly shifted the\ninspection requirements of the GIASP and GCASP. The County‘s argument assumes\n(without evidentiary or logical support) that the inspection obligations in the GIASP and\nGCASP are purely state mandates or a combination of federal and state mandates. We\ndisagree; the GIASP and GCASP expressly and solely provide that they are issued to comply\nwith the Clean Water Act and EPA regulations. Thus, shifting the federally-mandated GIASP\nand GCASP inspection obligations via the Permit‘s inspections could not constitute the\nshifting of a state mandate.\n               C.     Substantial Evidence\n       The County argues that the Commission‘s decision that the trash receptacle obligation\nwas not a federal mandate was supported by substantial evidence, as was its finding that the\ninspection obligations were not federal mandates. We have concluded that the Commission\nerred in the first instance in failing to consider the proper legal framework for analyzing the\nsubvention question, the Permit‘s requirements are not state mandates as a matter of law, and\nthus do not reach the issue of whether substantial evidence supports its conclusions.14\n\n       14 The Department of Finance contends the court addressed the mandate issue of\nthe trash receptacles and inspection requirements in an unpublished portion of County of\nLos Angeles v. State Water Resources Control Bd., supra, 143 Cal.App.4th 985. To rebut\nthis argument and to establish that they appropriately raised the issue of unfunded state\nmandates, the County requests that we take judicial notice of two orders issued by the\nSuperior Court in County of Los Angeles v. Regional Quality Control Board for the Los\nAngeles Region (2005, No. BS080758), in which the court sustained demurrers to the\nCounty‘s claim that the permit requirements at issue were unfunded state mandates. In\nthose orders, the trial court held that the appropriate vehicle for challenging the permit\nrequirements was to file a test claim with the Commission. We take judicial notice of\nthose documents. (Evid. Code, §§ 452, 459.) We conclude the trial court did not address\n\n                                               36\n\fIII.   Preemption\n       Amicus Building Association argues that we should apply federal preemption analysis\nto the question and determine that federal law does not preempt state law; therefore, the\nadditional requirements, being creatures of state law and the Regional Board‘s exercise of its\nown discretion, constitute state mandates because they exceed the prior permits. Further,\nBuilding Association argues that the federal statutes and regulations constitute a federal\ndirective to exercise unfettered state discretion; thus, the proper question before the trial court\nwas whether the Regional Board exceeded its state discretion when it determined the\nmaximum extent practicable relative to the MS4 permits. As a result, no MS4 permit would\nexceed the maximum extent practicable because that maximum extent practicable is whatever\nthe Regional Board divines it to be. The Department of Finance responds that federal\npreemption is not relevant where the issue to be decided is whether a federal or a state\nmandate exists. Rather, the inquiry is on the scope of the requirements of federal law.\n       ―The supremacy clause of the United States Constitution establishes a constitutional\nchoice-of-law rule, makes federal law paramount, and vests Congress with the power to\npreempt state law.‖ (Viva! Internat. Voice for Animals v. Adidas Promotional Retail\nOperations, Inc. (2007) 41 Cal.4th 929, 935.) ―There is a presumption against federal\npreemption in those areas traditionally regulated by the states.‖ (Id. at p. 938.) Therefore,\n―‗[w]e start with the assumption that the historic police powers of the States were not to be\nsuperseded by the Federal Act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.‘\n[Citations.]‖ (Ibid.) ―There are four species of federal preemption: express, conflict,\nobstacle, and field.‖ (Id. at p. 935.)\n\n\n\n\nthe issue of whether the Permit‘s requirements were state mandates; rather, the trial court\nheld that the Commission was the appropriate vehicle for determination of state\nmandates. Further, the appellate court in County of Los Angeles v. State Water Resources\nControl Bd., supra, 143 Cal.App.4th 985 did not decide the issue. Thus, the opinion was\nnot binding on the Commission or any other adjudicatory entity on the issue of state\nmandates. (See Boeken v. Philip Morris USA, Inc., supra, 48 Cal.4th at p. 797.)\n\n                                                37\n\f       As our discussion of the federal mandate issue demonstrates, the Permit, although\nissued by a state agency under enabling Water Code provisions, is a federal permit that\nimplements federal law in the form of the maximum extent practicable standard. As a result,\nthere is no California law that might be preempted, and federal preemption analysis is\ninapposite.\nIV.    Removal of Commission’s Discretion; Remand\n       The County contends the trial court erred in reversing the Commission‘s decision; but\neven if the Commission erred in its analysis of the test claims, the trial court should have\nremanded the matter for further proceedings to permit the Commission to exercise its\ndiscretion properly. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1094.5, subd. (f); National Auto. & Cas. Ins. Co. v.\nDowney (1950) 98 Cal.App.2d 586, 594.) The Department of Finance contends remand is\ninappropriate because there is nothing for the Commission to exercise its discretion over\nbecause its decision was based upon faulty legal conclusions. As we conclude that the trial\ncourt correctly applied the maximum extent practicable standard and found the Permit‘s\nrequirements did not, as a matter of law, constitute unfunded state mandates because those\nrequirements originated in the federal maximum extent practicable standard, remand to the\nCommission is unnecessary.\n                                        DISPOSITION\n       The judgment is affirmed. The parties are to bear their own costs on appeal.\n       CERTIFIED FOR PUBLICATION.\n\n\n                                             JOHNSON, J.\n\n\nWe concur:\n\n\n               MALLANO, P.

The\nPermit is governed by a complex state and federal statutory scheme regulating pollutant\ndischarge into waterways under the federal Clean Water Act and the California Porter-\nCologne Water Act. The Permit‘s subvention status is subject to initial determination by the\nCommission on State Mandates (Commission). Real parties in interest filed a test claim\nbefore the Commission, seeking to determine whether four requirements of the Permit (to\ninstall trash receptacles at transit stops and to conduct inspections of commercial, industrial,\nand construction sites) constituted unfunded state mandates subject to reimbursement under\nthe California Constitution, article XIII B, section 6 because although the Permit was\ngoverned by both federal law and state law, the County asserted the Permit contained\nadditional state requirements not found in the governing federal statutes and regulations. The\nCommission agreed and found that the requirements constituted state mandates, although it\n\n\n\n                                                2\n\fconcluded subvention was required only for the trash receptacles because the County had the\nability to levy fees to pay for the inspections.\n       The Department of Finance filed a petition for writ of mandate in the trial court,\nseeking to overturn the Commission‘s ruling, contending that the requirements were solely\nfederal mandates because they implemented the directive of the federal statutes and\nregulations and thus were not subject to state subvention. The trial court agreed and found\nthat the Commission erred in finding the Permit requirements were state mandates because it\ndid not apply the applicable federal ―maximum extent practicable‖ standard, and issued a writ\nof mandate ordering the Commission to vacate its decision.\n       On appeal, the dispute centers on whether the federal standard requiring the reduction\nof pollutants to the maximum extent practicable encompassed the specific four requirements\nof the Permit, given that the federal regulations at issue did not expressly spell out such\nrequirements. The amici parties California Stormwater Quality Association et al. (collectively\nCSQA) join in the County‘s arguments that the trial court erred in finding the maximum\nextent practicable standard controlled. The amicus party Building Association Legal Defense\nFoundation (Building Association) asserts that the issue is one of preemption, and the trial\ncourt erred in finding that the federal regulations governed the court‘s mandate analysis. We\nagree with the trial court‘s conclusion that the Commission failed to apply the controlling\nmaximum extent practicable standard, that the Permit‘s mandates implement the maximum\nextent practicable objective, and thus are federal mandates. We affirm the judgment.\n             FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n       A.      Regulatory Structure\n       The Permit was issued as a ―National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System‖\n(NPDES) permit pursuant to the Clean Water Act, Title 33 United States Code section 1342.\nThe Clean Water Act requires operators of municipal separate storm sewer systems to obtain\nNPDES permits that contain controls to ―reduce the discharge of pollutants to the maximum\nextent practicable.‖ (33 U.S.C. § 1342(p)(3)(B)(iii).) The Commission did not consider this\nstandard in evaluating the Permit‘s requirements, instead looking solely to whether the\n\n\n                                                   3\n\frequirements were expressly set forth in the implementing federal regulation at 40 Code of\nFederal Regulations, part 122.26(d)(2)(iv)(A)–(D) (a copy of appendix A is attached).\n       1.

As a result, the flexible maximum extent practicable\nstandard is designed to permit MS4 dischargers to comply with such requirement on a permit-\nby-permit basis.\n       The EPA promulgated regulations to provide guidance to stormwater system\npermittees concerning requirements for MS4 permits. The regulations contain certain\nrequirements, such as requiring MS4 permittees to include a program to monitor discharge\nfrom municipal landfills, hazardous waste treatment plants, but otherwise allow permittees to\ndevelop their own programs to meet the maximum extent practicable standard. (See 40\n\n       3 Title 33 United States Code section 1342(p)(3)(B)(iii) requires operators of\nmunicipal storm sewer systems permits to ―require controls to reduce the discharge of\npollutants to the maximum extent practicable, including management practices, control\ntechniques and system, design and engineering methods, and such other provisions as the\nAdministrator or the State determines appropriate for the control of such pollutants.‖ The\nClean Water Act does not define the ―maximum extent practicable‖ standard.

(33 U.S.C. § 1370.) ―Nothing in this part precludes a\nState from: (1) Adopting or enforcing requirements which are more stringent or more\nextensive than those required under this part; (2) Operating a program with a greater scope of\ncoverage than that required under this part.‖ (40 C.F.R. § 123.l(i).)\n       Under California law, the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act (Porter-Cologne\nAct), enacted in 1969, predates the Clean Water Act and establishes a statewide program for\nwater quality control. (Wat. Code, § 13000 et seq.) Nine regional boards, overseen by the\nState Water Resources Control Board (State Board), administer the state program in their\nrespective regions. (Wat. Code, §§ 13140, 13200 et seq., 13240, 13301.) After enactment of\nthe Clean Water Act, the Legislature ―amended the Porter-Cologne Act to require the State\nBoard and regional boards to issue discharge permits that ensure compliance with the Clean\nWater Act. (See Wat. Code, § 13370 et seq.)‖ (WaterKeepers Northern California, supra,\n102 Cal.App.4th at p. 1452.) The Clean Water Act thus permits NPDES permits to be issued\neither by the EPA or an EPA-approved state. (33 U.S.C. § 1342(a)(1), (b); Wat. Code,\n§§ 13374, 13377.) The EPA has issued guidance documents discussing best management\npractices (BMP) to be included in MS4 permits. Under the Clean Water Act, the proper scope\nof the controls in an NPDES permit depends on the applicable state water quality standards\nfor the affected water bodies. (See Communities for a Better Environment v. State Water\nResources Control Bd.

The state issuing a permit must insure it\ncomplies with federal requirements and provide for continued monitoring and inspection. (33\nU.S.C. §§ 1342(b)(1), (b)(2), 1311, 1312, 1316, 1317.) When a permit is renewed, modified,\nor reissued, it must be at least as stringent as the prior permit. (33 U.S.C. § 1342(o).)\n       The EPA retains veto power over a state-issued NPDES permit if the EPA does not\nfind compliance with any applicable federal requirements. (33 U.S.C. § 1342(d); 40 C.F.R.\n§ 123.44.) Further, the EPA may withdraw its approval of a state NPDES program if it\ndetermines the state is not administering the program in compliance with the federal\nrequirement. (33 U.S.C. § 1342(c)(3); 40 C.F.R. §§ 123.63, 123.64.) If a state repeatedly\nissues permits that are vetoed by the EPA, the EPA may find this constitutes grounds for\nwithdrawal of the state‘s program approval.

(San Diego Unified School Dist., at p. 874.) To determine if\nthe program is new or imposes a higher level of service, the test claim legislation must be\ncompared with the legal requirements in effect immediately before the enactment of the test\nclaim legislation. A ―higher level of service‖ occurs when the new ―requirements were\nintended to provide an enhanced service to the public.‖ (Ibid.) Finally, the newly required\n\n\n                                                8\n\factivity or increased level of service must impose costs mandated by the state. (County of\nFresno v.

Further, even if the\nprogram requires a higher level of service, if the local agency has the authority to levy\ncharges, fees, or assessments sufficient to pay for the program, it will not constitute a mandate\nwithin the meaning of article XIII B.

Background\n       To obtain the permit, the County of Los Angeles, on behalf of itself and the cities,\nsubmitted on January 31, 2001 a Report of Waste Discharge (ROWD), which constituted a\npermit application, and a Stormwater Quality Management Program, which constituted the\npermittees proposal for best management practices that would be required in the permit. The\nROWD contained a Storm Water Management Program as set forth in 40 Code of Federal\nRegulations, part 122.26(d), which in turn included a Storm Water Quality Management\nProgram (SQMP).\n       The Regional Board issued notices to the permitees and interested agencies and\npersons of its intent to issue the Permit, and provided an opportunity for comment and\nrecommendations. In addition, the Regional Board conducted public workshops to discuss\n\n\n\n                                                9\n\fdrafts of the Permit, and held a public hearing at which it heard and considered all comments\npertaining to the Permit‘s requirements.\n       The Permit was issued pursuant to section 402 of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C.\n§ 1342), and was originally adopted by the Regional Board on December 13, 2001 as NPDES\nPermit No. CAS004001, and amended on September 14, 2006 and August 9, 2007.5 The\nPermit established waste discharge requirements for municipal storm water and urban runoff\ndischarges within the County of Los Angeles and the incorporated cities therein, except the\nCity of Long Beach.\n       The 72-page permit is divided into six parts. The County, the flood control district,\nand the 84 cities are designated in the permit as the permittees. The Permit incorporated the\nRegional Board‘s factual findings regarding the nature of the harms occurring because of\nstorm water discharge, surface water runoff, and pollutants. The Permit found ―[t]he\nregulations require that permittees establish priorities and procedures for inspection of\nindustrial facilities and priority commercial establishments. This permit, consistent with\n[EPA] policy, incorporates a cooperative partnership, including the specification of minimum\nexpectations, between the Regional Board and the permittees for the inspection of industrial\nfacilities and priority commercial establishments to control pollutants in storm water\ndischarges (58 Fed. Reg. 61157).‖ Further, ―Section 402 of the [Clean Water Act] (33 U.S.C.\n§ 1342(p)) provides that MS4 permits must ‗require controls to reduce the discharge of\npollutants to the maximum extent practicable, including management practices, control\ntechniques and systems, design engineering methods and such other provisions as the [EPA]\nAdministrator or the State determines appropriate for the control of such pollutants.‘ The\nState Water Resources Control Board‘s (State Board) Office of Chief Counsel (OCC) has\nissued a memorandum interpreting the meaning of MEP to include technical feasibility, cost,\nand benefit derived with the burden being on the municipality to demonstrate compliance with\n\n\n\n\n       5   The Permit was originally issued in 1990 and renewed in 1996.\n\n                                               10\n\fMEP by showing that a BMP [best management practice] is not technically feasible in the\nlocality or that BMP[] costs would exceed any benefit to be derived. . . .‖\n       Separately, to facilitate compliance with federal regulations, the State Board has\npreviously issued two statewide general NPDES permits for stormwater discharges: (1) for\nstormwater from industrial sites [NPDES No. CAS000001, General Industrial Activity Storm\nWater Permit (GIASP)] and (2) for stormwater from construction sites [NPDES\nNo. CAS000002, General Construction Activity Storm Water Permit (GCASP)], originally\nissued in 1997 and 1999, respectively. Facilities discharging stormwater associated with\nindustrial activities and construction sites of five acres or more of disturbed area were required\nto obtain individualized NPDES permits, or to be covered by a statewide general permit. The\nPermit sets forth that ―[t]he USEPA guidance anticipates coordination of the state-\nadministered programs for industrial and construction activities with the local agency program\nto reduce pollutants in storm water discharges to the MS4.‖\n       The GCASP was issued to address effluent limitations promulgated under the Clean\nWater Act and as specified in the applicable federal regulations. Under the GCASP, the state\nrequires inspections of construction sites prior to anticipated storm events to identify areas\ncontributing to the discharge of stormwater, and to ensure that BMPs were properly installed\nand functioned adequately during the storm. In addition, the site must permit the Regional\nBoard, the State Board, the EPA, and the operator of the storm sewer into which the site\ndischarges stormwater to inspect the site. The GIASP was likewise issued to address effluent\nlimitations promulgated under the Clean Water Act and as specified in the federal regulations\napplicable to the Clean Water Act. With respect to inspections, the GIASP has an extensive\nmonitoring program that is facility-specific and requires visual inspections and water\nsampling and analysis. Under the GIASP, the facility operator may, if it meets certain\nconditions, certify compliance with the GIASP and reduce the number of sampling events.\nPreventative maintenance must also be conducted by the facility‘s operators, and includes\ninspection of structural storm water controls (catch basins, oil/water separators, etc.) as well as\nother facility equipment and systems. In addition, there must be an inspection schedule of all\n\n\n                                                11\n\fpotential pollutant sources. The site must also permit Regional Board, State Board, EPA and\nany local storm water agency to enter into the site for inspections. The GIASP specifically\nnotes that it ―does not preempt or supersede the authority of local agencies to prohibit, restrict,\nor control storm water discharges and authorized non-storm water discharges to storm drain\nsystems or other water-courses within their jurisdictions as allowed by State and Federal law.‖\nThe Regional Board has the authority to enforce the GIASP and GCASP.\n       The Los Angeles County Flood Control District was designated as the principal\npermittee and was to, among other things, coordinate permit activities among the permittees\nand provide technical and administrative support.\n               2.      Permit Requirements\n       The County challenged before the Commission parts 4C2a (inspections of commercial\nfacilities), 4C2b (inspection of industrial facilities), 4E (inspection of construction sites) and\n4F5c3 (installation of trash receptacles) of the Permit.\n                       A.     Commercial Facilities. (Part 4C2a)\n       Restaurants, automotive service facilities, retail gasoline stores and automotive\ndealerships were to be inspected by the permittees twice during the five-year term of the\nPermit, with a minimum of one year between inspections.\n       With respect to restaurants, the Permit required each permittee to inspect all restaurants\nwithin its jurisdiction to confirm that stormwater BMP‘s were being effectively implemented,\nand included verification that the restaurant operator: ―has received educational materials on\nstormwater pollution prevention practices; [¶] []does not pour oil and grease or oil and grease\nresidue onto a parking lot, street or adjacent catch basin; [¶] [] keeps the trash bin area clean\nand trash bin lids closed, and does not fill trash bins with washout water or any other liquid;\n[¶] [] does not allow illicit discharges, such as discharge of washwater from floormats, floors,\nporches, parking lots, alleys, sidewalks and street areas (in the immediate vicinity of the\nestablishment), filters or garbage/trash containers; [¶] [] removes food waste, rubbish or\nother materials from parking lot areas in a sanitary manner that does not create a nuisance or\ndischarge to the storm drain.‖\n\n\n                                                12\n\f       With respect to automotive service facilities, the Permit required that each permittee\n―inspect all automotive service facilities within its jurisdiction to confirm that stormwater\nBMPs are effectively implemented.‖ At each automotive service facility, inspectors were to\nverify that each operator: ―maintains the facility area so that it is clean and dry without\nevidence of excessive staining; [¶] [] implements housekeeping BMPs to prevent spills and\nleaks; [¶] [] properly discharges wastewaters to a sanitary sewer and/or contains wastewaters\nfor transfer to a legal point of disposal; [¶] [] is aware of the prohibition on discharge of non-\nstormwater to the storm drain; [¶] [] properly manages raw and waste materials including\nproper disposal of hazardous waste; [¶] [] protects outdoor work and storage areas to prevent\ncontact of pollutants with rainfall and runoff; [¶] [] labels, inspects, and routinely cleans\nstorm drain inlets that are located on the facility‘s property; and [¶] [] trains employees to\nimplement stormwater pollution prevention practices.‖\n       With respect to retail gasoline outlets and automotive dealerships, the Permit required\neach permittee to confirm that BMP‘s were being effectively implemented at each retail\ngasoline outlet and automotive dealership within its jurisdiction. The permittee was to verify\nthat each operator: ―routinely sweeps fuel-dispensing areas for removal of litter and debris,\nand keeps rags and absorbents ready for use in case of leaks and spills; [¶] [] was aware that\nwashdown of facility area to the storm drain is prohibited; [¶] [] [was] aware of design flaws\n(such as grading that does not prevent run-on, or inadequate roof covers and berms), and that\nequivalent BMP‘s are implemented; [¶] [] inspects and cleans storm drain inlets and catch\nbasins within each facility‘s boundaries no later than October 1st of each year; [¶] [] posts\nsigns close to fuel dispensers, which warn vehicle owners/operators against ‗topping off‘ of\nvehicle fuel tanks and installation of automatic shutoff fuel dispensing nozzles; [¶] []\nroutinely checks outdoor waste receptacle and air/water supply areas, cleans leaks and drips,\nand ensures that only watertight waste receptacles are used and that lids are closed; and [¶] []\ntrains employees to properly manage hazardous materials and wastes as well as to implement\nother stormwater pollution prevention practices.‖\n\n\n\n                                                13\n\f                       B.     Industrial Facilities. (Part 4C2b)\n       Generally, the Permit required inspections twice during the five-year term of the\nPermit, with more than one year between inspections. Each permittee was required to confirm\nthat each operator had ―a current Waste Discharge Identification (WDID) number for facilities\ndischarging stormwater associated with industrial activity, and that a Storm Water Pollution\nPrevention Plan is available on-site,‖ and the facility was effectively implementing the plan.\n                       C.     Construction Facilities. (Part 4E)\n       The Permit required each permittee to implement a program to control runoff from\nconstruction activity: ―Sediments generated on the construction site were to be retained using\nadequate Treatment Control and Structural BMP‘s‖; construction related materials, spills, and\nresidues were to be contained at the construction site to avoid runoff to streets; nonstormwater\nrunoff from equipment and vehicle washing was to be retained at the site; erosion from slopes\nand channels was to be controlled by implementing BMP‘s, such as limiting grading during\nthe wet season, inspecting graded areas during rain, planting and maintenance of slopes, and\ncovering erosion susceptible slopes. For sites one acre or larger, each was to be inspected a\nminimum of once during the wet season.\n                       D.     Trash Receptacles. (Part 4F5c3)\n       The trash receptacle requirement at Part 4, Special Provisions, F. Public Agency\nActivities Program, 5. Storm Drain Operation and Management, c (Part 4F5c3) required trash\nreceptacles to be placed at all transit stops within the permittee‘s jurisdiction. ―Permittees not\n\nsubject to a trash TMDL[6] shall: [¶]…[¶] (3) Place trash receptacles at all transit stops\nwithin its jurisdiction that have shelters no later than August 1, 2002, and at all transit stops\nwithin its jurisdiction no later than February 3, 2003. All trash receptacles shall be maintained\nas necessary.‖\n\n\n\n\n       6 Total Maximum Daily Load, or TMDL, is a calculation of the maximum amount\nof a pollutant that a waterbody can receive and still safely meet water quality standards.\n\n                                                14\n\f               D.      Proceedings Before the Commission\n                       1.       The Hearing\n       In September 2003, the County of Los Angeles and several cities within the county\nfiled a test claim.7 The County sought reimbursement for the inspection requirement of\ncommercial facilities, industrial facilities, and commercial facilities, and the trash receptacle\nrequirement at parts 4C2a, 4C2b, 4E, and 4F5c3 of the Permit. The Commission initially\nrefused jurisdiction over the permit based on Government Code section 17516‘s definition of\n―executive order‖ that excluded permits issued by the State Board or a regional board.

Commission on State Mandates (2007) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2254765\"><a href=\"/opinion/2254765/county-of-la-v-comn-on-state-mandates/\"><span class=\"volume\">150</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">898</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\nDivision Three of this court held that exclusions of these entities from the definition of an\nexecutive order was unconstitutional. The court issued a writ directing the Commission to\nhear the claim on the merits. (Id. at p. 921.) The county and the cities refiled the test claim in\nOctober and November 2007.\n       The County asserted that it did not have fee authority to collect trash from trash\nreceptacles that must be placed at transit stops. Further, the County asserted it had no\nauthority to collect fees to conduct the inspections, and before the state delegated such\ninspections, the state had performed them. At the hearing on the test claim held July 31, 2009,\nthe County presented evidence consisting of:\n       (1) Several EPA permits for MS4 showed that many of the permits did not contain a\ntrash receptacle requirement;\n       (2) The trash receptacle obligation was new and had not been included in prior permits\nissued by the Regional Board that were approved by the EPA;\n\n       7  Originally, test claims 03-TC-04 (Transit Trash Receptacles) and 03-TC-19\n(Inspection of Industrial/Commercial Facilities) were filed by the County of Los Angeles in\nSeptember 2003. Test claim 03-TC-21 (Stormwater Pollution Requirements) was filed by the\nCities of Baldwin Park, Bellflower, Cerritos, Covina, Downey, Monterey Park, Pico Rivera,\nSignal Hill, South Pasadena, and West Covina on September 30, 2003. Test claim 03-TC-20\n(Waste Discharge Requirements) was filed by Cities of Artesia, Beverly Hills, Carson, La\nMirada, Monrovia, Norwalk, Rancho Palos Verdes, San Marino, and Westlake Village on\nSeptember 30, 2003.\n\n                                                15\n\f       (3) Letters dated April and July 2001 from the EPA assertedly stating that the State of\nCalifornia had the obligation to inspect facilities for state-issued permits;8\n       (4) Evidence that the Regional Board had previously negotiated with the county to pay\nthe county to perform inspections of industrial facilities on the Regional Board‘s behalf—\nbefore the Regional Board imposed that requirement on the county and cities without\npayment.\n       The Department of Finance asserted that the Permit did not impose a reimbursable\nmandate because the Permit conditions imposed on the local agencies were required under the\nNPDES program and were enforceable under the federal Clean Water Act. The Department\nof Finance also argued that the claimants had discretion over the activities and conditions\nincluded in the Permit and thus any resulting costs were ―downstream‖ of the permittee‘s\ndecision to include the provision and hence not state-mandated.\n       The County responded that whether or not an agency places trash receptacles at transit\nstops was not relevant to the mandate determination because if a local agency has been\nincurring costs that are later mandated by the state, such costs are reimbursable as a mandate.\nFurther, the inspection duties were imposed for state-permitted industrial and commercial\nfacilities and construction sites, and the state had been responsible for such inspections since\n1969 under the Porter-Cologne Act; and the inspections were not required under the Clean\nWater Act.\n               2.      The Commission’s Conclusions\n                       (a)    Not Discretionary\n       The Commission found that because the permittees were required by state and federal\nlaw to obtain the Permit, it was not discretionary.\n                       (b)    Not a Federal Mandate\n       The Commission observed that ―[w]hen federal law imposes a mandate on the state,\nhowever, and the state ‗freely [chooses] to impose the costs upon the local agency as a means\n\n       8 The letters state that the local government and the state have a tandem duty to\ninsure inspection requirements are fulfilled.\n\n                                                16\n\fof implementing a federal program, then the costs are the result of a reimbursable state\nmandate regardless whether the costs were imposed upon the state by the federal\ngovernment,‘‖ citing Hayes, supra, 11 Cal.App.4th at page 1593 and Government Code\nsection 17556, subdivision (c).9 Further, the Commission found the state could enforce its\nown water quality laws as long as such laws were as stringent as the Clean Water Act. (33\nU.S.C. § 1342(p)(3)(B)(iii).)\n                                (i)   Trash Receptacles\n       The Commission found the trash receptacle obligation was not a federal mandate\nbecause federal law contained no such requirement, nor did federal law require inspections of\nrestaurants, automotive facilities, or retail gasoline outlets. The Commission observed that\nnothing in the Clean Water Act indicated that California was required to have a NPDES\nprogram or issue stormwater permits; the EPA would require permits if California had no\nsuch program. Further, the plain language of the federal regulation at 40 Code of Federal\nRegulations, part 122.26(d)(2)(iv)(A)(3) was generally worded to require ―[a] description of\npractices for operating and maintaining public streets, roads and highways and procedures for\nreducing the impact on receiving waters of discharges from municipal storm sewer systems,\nincluding pollutants discharged as a result of deicing activities‖ and this language did not\nrequire the permittees to install and maintain trash receptacles at transit stops. The\nCommission relied on Long Beach Unified Sch. Dist. v. State of California (1990) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2145265\"><a href=\"/opinion/2145265/long-beach-unified-sch-dist-v-state-of-calif/\"><span class=\"volume\">225</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">155</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Long Beach Unified) for the proposition that NPDES permits may contain a\nstate mandate even though they are formulated to comply with federal law. In Long Beach\nUnified, Division Five of this court held that although the school district was under a federal\nconstitutional obligation to desegregate schools, the state executive order promulgating\nregulations providing desegregation guidelines to schools was a state mandate because it\n\n       9 Government Code section 17556, subdivision (c), states that the Commission\nshall not find costs mandated by the state if ―[t]he statute or executive order imposes a\nrequirement that is mandated by a federal law or regulation and results in costs mandated\nby the federal government, unless the statute or executive order mandates costs that\nexceed the mandate in that federal law or regulation.‖\n\n                                               17\n\frequired specific actions to be taken that went beyond the federal constitutional obligation as\nset forth in case law. (Long Beach Unified, at p. 173.) The Commission found that as in Long\nBeach Unified, the Permit‘s mandates went beyond federal requirements and thus constituted\na state mandate.\n                              (ii)    Inspection Requirement.\n       With respect to the inspection obligations of commercial, industrial and construction\nfacilities, the Commission analyzed the requirements of 40 Code of Federal Regulations, part\n122.26(d)(2)(iv)(B) and (C). Those sections generally required the ―description of a program,\nincluding inspections, to implement and enforce an ordinance, orders or similar means to\nprevent illicit discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system,‖ (40 C.F.R.\n§ 122.26(d)(2)(iv)(B)(1)), or a requirement that permittees ―[i]dentify priorities and\nprocedures for inspections and establishing and implementing control measures for such\ndischarges.‖ (40 C.F.R. § 122.26(d)(2)(iv)(C)(1)). However, the federal regulations\ncontained no express requirement to inspect restaurants, automotive service facilities, retail\ngasoline stations, automobile dealerships, or construction and industrial sites. Thus, this\nrequirement was not a federal mandate.\n       The Commission also found that this same language in 40 Code of Federal\nRegulations, part 122.26(d)(2)(iv)(B)(1) and (C)(1) did not prevent the state, rather than local\nagencies, from inspecting industrial facilities. The statewide GIASP was administered by the\nState Board, and the State Board collected fees for the regional boards for performing\nobligations under the GIASP pursuant to Water Code section 13260, subd. (d)(2)(B)(ii). The\nCommission found that ―[i]nasmuch as the federal regulation (40 C.F.R. § 122.26(c))\nauthorizes coverage under a statewide general permit for the inspections of industrial\nactivities, and the federal regulation (40 C.F.R. § 122.26(d)(2)(iv)(D)) does not expressly\nrequire those inspections to be performed by the county or cities (or the ‗owner or operator of\nthe discharge‘), . . . the state has freely chosen to impose these activities on the permittees‖\nand no federal mandate existed. (Fn. omitted.)\n\n\n\n                                                18\n\f                 (c)    ―New Program‖ or ―Higher Level of Service‖\n          With respect to whether the Permit requirements ―imposed a new program or a higher\nlevel of service,‖ the Commission observed that to determine whether the permit is a new\nprogram or higher level of service, it needed to compare the Permit to the legal requirements\nin effect immediately before its adoption. In that regard, the Commission found that local\nagencies were not required by state or federal law to place and maintain trash receptacles at\ntransit stops before the permit was adopted, as a result, it was a new program or higher level\nof service to place trash receptacles at transit stops and maintain them as specified in the\npermit.\n          For the same reason, the Commission found that the inspections and enforcement\nduties at industrial and commercial facilities, including restaurants, automotive service\nfacilities, retail gasoline outlets, and automotive dealerships, was a new program or higher\nlevel of service because these were not required activities of the permittees prior to the\npermit‘s adoption.\n          E.     Proceedings Before the Trial Court\n                 1.     Petition and Cross-Petition\n          On February 17, 2011, the Department of Finance, the State Board, and the Regional\nBoard filed a petition for administrative mandamus pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure\nsection 1094.5 against the Commission, with the County of Los Angeles and the cities of\nArtesia, Azusa, Bellflower, Beverly Hills, Carson, Commerce, Covina, Downey, Monterey\nPark, Norwalk, Rancho Palos Verdes, Signal Hill, Vernon, and Westlake Village as real\nparties in interest.\n          The Department of Finance argued that that the Permit was a federal mandate and not\nsubject to subvention because California‘s administration of the mandate did not transform the\nClean Water Act requirements into a state mandate. Under City of Sacramento, supra, 50\nCal.3d at pages 73–74, ―certain regulatory standards imposed by the federal government\nunder ‗cooperative federalism‘ schemes are coercive on the states and localities in every\npractical sense‖; similarly here, the NDPES program was coercive on the state and local\n\n\n                                               19\n\fgovernments because regardless of whether the state or the EPA issued the Permit, it was not\nvoluntary because the County had to comply with the maximum extent practicable standards\nand thus the Permit did not constitute a shifting of state costs to localities. Congress\nestablished the maximum extent practicable standard because municipal storm water runoff,\nunlike other pollutant discharges, could not be adequately addressed by blanket effluent\nlimitations. Thus, the Commission erred in ignoring this standard and by looking solely to\nfederal statutes and regulations to define the scope of federal law. Finally, the Department of\nFinance argued the Regional Board‘s findings regarding what was necessary to implement the\nmaximum extent practicable standard had previously been litigated in County of Los Angeles\nv. State Water Resources Control Bd. (2006) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2249791\"><a href=\"/opinion/2249791/county-of-los-angeles-v-california-st-water-resources-control-bd/\"><span class=\"volume\">143</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">985</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> and previously upheld by\nDivision Five.\n       The County argued that it did not have fee authority to pay for the trash receptacles or\nthe inspections, and the State Board‘s fee for inspections of industrial and construction\nfacilities preempted any fee the County might charge. The cities of Bellflower, Carson,\nCommerce, Covina, Downey and Signal Hill argued that the Commission properly applied the\nmaximum extent practicable standard; whether the activities constituted a state mandate was\nwithin the Commission‘s purview, not the Regional Board‘s, and the Commission‘s decision\nwas supported by substantial evidence. With respect to industrial facilities, the State Board\nalready administered such facilities through the state-wide GIASP, which required the state to\nenforce its provisions; the State Board could collect fees to cover inspections of such\nfacilities, the Regional Board entered into a contract in 2001 whereby the Regional Board paid\nthe County to conduct inspections; and the plain language of the governing statutes and\nregulations do not require inspections. With respect to construction sites, the State Board\nalready administered such facilities through the state-wide GCASP, which is enforced by the\nstate and authorizes the State Board to collect fees for inspections; the inspection obligation\nwas not in prior permits, and the plain language of the governing statutes and regulations do\nnot require inspections.\n\n\n\n                                                20\n\f       In reply, the Department asserted that the maximum extent practicable standard\ngoverned whether the mandate was of federal or state origin, and there was no evidence the\nPermit requirements went beyond federal law. The mere fact the standard was flexible did not\nmean that the Permit exceeded those standards, and asserted the EPA requirements were not\ndeterminative under the Clean Water Act because under federal law, each permit must be\ntailored to the unique surroundings of the waterways: the language of Title 33 United States\nCode section 1342(p)(3)(B)(iii) contemplates that, because of the fundamentally different\ncharacteristics of many municipalities, municipalities will have permits tailored to meet\nparticular geographical, hydrological, and climactic conditions. (55 Fed. Reg. 47990, 48053\n(Nov. 16, 1990).) Further, the fact prior permits did not have the requirements of the most\nrecent permit was not relevant because a new permit must be at least as stringent as the prior\none (33 U.S.C. § 1342(o); 40 C.F.R. § 122.44(l)), and the EPA anticipates that stormwater\nmanagement will evolve over time.\n       The County of Los Angeles and the cities of Bellflower, Carson, Commerce, Covina,\nDowney and Signal Hill filed a cross-petition10 for writ of administrative mandamus,\nchallenging the Commission‘s finding that although the inspection requirements of parts\n4C2a, 4C2b, and 4E were state mandates, the County had the authority to levy fees pursuant to\nGovernment Code section 17556, subdivision (d) to pay for such programs and was thus not\nentitled to subvention.\n               2.     Trial Court’s Statement of Decision\n       On August 15, 2011, the trial court issued its statement of decision in which it found\nthe trash receptacle requirement was a federal mandate. The trial court rejected the\nCommission‘s conclusion that the state freely chose to implement the NPDES permit as\nlegally incorrect because the fact that California was not required to issue permits and\nvoluntarily did so did not lead to the conclusion the NPDES program was optional and thus\nmandated by the state. The trial court rejected the argument that there needed to be a federal\n\n       10The petition and cross-petition were initially filed in Sacramento County, but\nwere transferred to Los Angeles County.\n\n                                               21\n\fregulation particularly on point for the activity to be mandated because such an argument\nignored and misplaced the flexibility built into the federal maximum extent practicable\nstandard. Thus, the trial court found the Commission erred in isolating specific requirements\nto conclude that the Permit was a state mandate because one permit provision could not\nexceed the maximum extent practicable standard where the Regional Board had concluded the\npermit as a whole did not. The failure to include these provisions in prior permits did not\nconvert the requirements into state mandates due to the evolving nature of the Clean Water\nAct‘s requirements. Further, the inspection requirements were likewise pursuant to the\nmaximum extent practicable standard of the Clean Water Act and hence federal mandates. ―A\nfederal mandate does not require explicit mention of every mandated activity. Rather, the\nrelevant inquiry is whether these inspection activities fall within the Clean Water Act‘s\nmaximum extent practicable standard. As there is nothing in the record to suggest that they\nexceed this standard, the Commission‘s conclusions to the contrary must fail.‖ The trial court\ndid not address the County‘s cross-petition, but noted that it would fail for the same reasons as\nthe petition.11\n       The court entered judgment granting the petition, and remanded the matter to the\nCommission to set aside and vacate its decision.\n                                        DISCUSSION\nI.     Standard of Review\n       In reviewing the Commission‘s decision under Code of Civil Procedure section\n1094.5, the trial court determines whether the agency proceeded in excess of jurisdiction,\nthere was a fair hearing, and there was any prejudicial abuse of discretion. (Code Civ. Proc.,\n§ 1094.5, subd. (b).) Abuse of discretion is established if the Commission has not proceeded\nin the manner required by law, the order or decision is not supported by the findings, or its\nfindings are not supported by substantial evidence. (Voices of the Wetlands v. State Water\n\n\n\n\n       11   The County does not challenge the denial of the cross-petition in this appeal.\n\n                                               22\n\fResources Control Bd.

Federal Mandates and “Maximum Extent Practicable”\n       The County contends that the trial court erred in finding that the Permit obligations\nwere federal mandates because (1) the court in County of Los Angeles v. Commission on State\nMandates, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2254765\"><a href=\"/opinion/2254765/county-of-la-v-comn-on-state-mandates/\"><span class=\"volume\">150</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

The County asserts that in Long Beach Unified, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2145265\"><a href=\"/opinion/2145265/long-beach-unified-sch-dist-v-state-of-calif/\"><span class=\"volume\">225</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

(Id. at pp. 172–173.) As a result, the County contends, the Permit‘s inspection\n\n\n                                               23\n\fobligations exceeded the scope of the federal regulations, both in number and required content\nof the inspections as well as the type of facilities to be inspected. (See, e.g., 40 C.F.R.\n122.26(d)(2)(iv)(B), (C) & (D).) Further, in Hayes, the court held that even where federal law\nimposes a mandate, if the state freely chooses to shift responsibility for compliance from itself\nto a local agency, the resulting costs are a state mandate regardless of whether the costs were\nimposed upon the state by the federal government. (Hayes, supra, 11 Cal.App.4th at\npp. 1593–1594.) However, the County contends, the trial court failed to apply this analysis,\nand if it had, it would have found that the Regional Board had a choice whether to impose the\ninspection obligations. First, under the Porter-Cologne Act, the Regional Board had the\nauthority to regulate the discharge of pollutants into waterways. (See, e.g., Wat. Code,\n§§ 13050, subds. (d), (e), 13260, 13263.) In addition, the Porter-Cologne Act authorizes the\nRegional Board to require any person to furnish technical and monitoring reports describing\ndischarges into waterways. (See Wat. Code, § 13267, subds. (b), (c).) The Porter-Cologne\nAct does not exempt commercial, industrial, or construction facilities from its reach. Finally,\nthe Regional Board had the obligation to enforce the GIASP and GCASP pertaining to\nconstruction and industrial sites, which contain provisions for inspections. Under both GIASP\nand GCASP, the state can impose inspection fees. (See, e.g., Wat. Code, § 13260,\nsubd. (d)(1)(A).)\n       The Department of Finance contends that the trial court correctly found that reliance\non Long Beach Unified, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2145265\"><a href=\"/opinion/2145265/long-beach-unified-sch-dist-v-state-of-calif/\"><span class=\"volume\">225</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

(Id. at p. 173.) In contrast, applicable to the Permit is the Clean\nWater Act specifying the maximum extent practicable standard, and the Commission was\nrequired to analyze the federal maximum extent practicable standard, which it did not. In\naddition, the Department of Finance argues that the Regional Board‘s duty to inspect facilities\ndoes not substitute for the County‘s‘ obligations under an NPDES permit, and the state‘s\ninspection obligations under GIASP and GCASP impose independent duties to perform\ncompliance inspections.\n\n\n                                                24\n\f       A.

App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">898</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, the first time this court addressed this case, the Regional Board\nargued that the trash receptacle and inspection obligations were federal mandates as a matter\nof law, contending that ―the federal mandate nature of its NPDES permits remains constant\nalthough it exercises discretion to control the discharge of pollutants through municipal\nstormwater programs not appearing in federal regulations.‖ (Id. at p. 914.) However, the\nCounty contends the court in County of Los Angeles v. Commission on State Mandates\nrejected these arguments, finding that because an NPDES permit could contain both federal\nand state requirements, whether the requirements constituted state or federal mandates was a\nfact question which must be addressed by the Commission. (Id. at pp. 917–918.) As a result\nof this holding, the County contends that this court has already rejected the federal mandate\nargument as a matter of law. The Department of Finance argues that the Commission should\nhave deferred to both the Regional Board‘s findings in designing the Permit and the prior\njudicial review of those findings. (See County of Los Angeles v. State Water Resources\nControl Bd., supra, 143 Cal.App.4th at p. 997.) The Commission, while an expert in\nmandate, is not an expert in water quality law.\n       We disagree. First, County of Los Angeles v.

The Commission returned the claims\nunadjudicated because they did not involve an executive order subject to subvention under\nGovernment Code section 17516, subdivision (c). (Commission on State Mandates, at\npp. 903–904.) On appeal, the court addressed whether section 17516, subdivision (c) was\nunconstitutional because it expressly exempted the Regional Board from the constitutional\nstate mandate subvention requirement. (Commission on State Mandates, at p. 904.) After\nconcluding that the statute was unconstitutional (id. at pp. 919–920), the court of appeal found\nthe trial court properly issued a writ of mandate directing the Commission to review the test\nclaims. (Id. at p. 921.) As the court did not address the issue of mandates, or make any\n\n\n                                              25\n\ffindings regarding the Permit, County of Los Angeles v.

The Maximum Extent Practicable Standard\n       The County argues that trial court erred in finding that the Commission failed to\nconsider the maximum extent practicable standard in making its ruling.12 The County asserts\nthe federal regulations are quite specific; with respect to others, the regulations are more\nflexible and leave the design of the permit to the permittees. Thus, according to the County,\nthe general language of the regulations permits flexibility in designing programs; however,\nwhen the Regional Board demands a specific activity, it removes that flexibility and creates a\nmandate. Similarly, amicus CSQA asserts that the federal regulations at issue are flexible and\npermit the local agencies to identify and propose the components of the program that they\nbelieve are appropriate for meeting the maximum extent practicable standard. Here, the 2001\nPermit removed such flexibility because it included new specific terms and conditions not\nfound in the prior permits, similar to the situation in Long Beach Unified. Amicus Building\nIndustry asserts that the EPA‘s reserved veto power does not transform the Regional Board‘s\nexercise of discretion into a federal mandate.\n\n\n       12 As a threshold concern, the County asserts that the trial court erroneously\nasserted that the MEP standard was a ―technology-forcing requirement designed to foster\ninnovation,‖ citing Chemical Manufacturer’s Assn. v.

[Citation] The [Clean Water] Act\nestablished the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (‗NPDES‘) and required\nan NPDES permit for any discharge by any point source into any navigable water of the\nUnited States, interstate or intrastate. The new strategy sought to force the best\ntechnology practicable or achievable on dischargers. . . . Instead of solely working\nbackwards from the water-quality standards to develop acceptable levels of effluent from\npoint sources, the new lead strategy was to require point sources to employ state-of-the-\nart treatment, even if it led, as a happy circumstance, to even cleaner water than called for\nby the standards.‖ (Id. at p. 1341.)\n\n                                                 26\n\f       The Department of Finance counters that the Commission‘s analysis ignored the\nmaximum extent practicable standard entirely. Instead, the Commission looked only to\nwhether federal law specifically required certain individual measures to be in the Permit. As a\nresult, the Commission‘s analysis erroneously found that where the federal regulations\nimposed a flexible standard, any state action to implement the federal mandate is\nautomatically converted into a state mandate.\n               1.     Federal Mandates\n       The subvention requirement of article XIII B, section 6 is triggered if ―the Legislature\nor any state agency‖ mandates a new program or higher level of service. (Cal. Const., art.\nXIII B, § 6.) Subvention is inapplicable where the additional costs on local governments are\nimposed by a federal mandate, i.e., the federal government. Article XIII B, section 9,\nsubdivision (b), defines federally mandated appropriations as those ―required to comply with\nmandates of the courts or the federal government which, without discretion, require an\nexpenditure for additional services or which unavoidably make the provision of existing\nservices more costly.‖ In 1980, after the adoption of article XIII B, the Legislature amended\nthe statutory definition of ―costs mandated by the federal government‖ to provide that such\ncosts included ―‗costs resulting from enactment of a state law or regulation where failure to\nenact such law or regulation to meet specific federal program or service requirements would\nresult in substantial monetary penalties or loss of funds to public or private persons in the\nstate.‘‖ (City of Sacramento, supra, 50 Cal.3d at p. 75, italics omitted.)\n       As the case before us demonstrates, there is no precise rule or formula for determining\nwhether a cost imposed on a local government or agency is a federal mandate. ―Given the\nvariety of cooperative federal-state-local programs, we here attempt no final test for\n‗mandatory‘ versus ‗optional‘ compliance with federal law. A determination in each case\nmust depend on such factors as the nature and purpose of the federal program; whether its\ndesign suggests an intent to coerce; when state and/or local participation began; the penalties,\nif any, assessed for withdrawal or refusal to participate or comply; and any other legal and\npractical consequences of nonparticipation, noncompliance, or withdrawal.

The counties asserted that the state statutes\nimposed special education requirements in excess of the federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973\nand the subsequent Education of the Handicapped Act. (Hayes, at pp. 1574–1575.) The\nBoard of Control (precursor to the Commission) determined that federal statutes were\ndiscretionary, and that the state statutes imposed state-mandated costs in excess of the federal\nprograms. (Id. at p. 1576.) Hayes observed that ―[i]n order to gain state and local acceptance\nof its substantive provisions, the Education of the Handicapped Act employs a ‗cooperative\nfederalism‘ scheme, which has also been referred to as the ‗carrot and stick‘ approach.\n[Citations.] As an incentive Congress made substantial federal financial assistance available\nto states and local educational agencies that would agree to adhere to the substantive and\nprocedural terms of the act.‖ (Id. at p. 1588.)\n       Finding that the Education of the Handicapped Act imposed a federal mandate under\nCity of Sacramento, Hayes recognized that while the Education of the Handicapped Act\nincluded certain substantive and procedural requirements which must be included in a state‘s\nplan for implementation of the act, it left primary responsibility for implementation to the\nstate. ―In short, even though the state had no real choice in deciding whether to comply with\nthe federal act, the act did not necessarily require the state to impose all of the costs of\nimplementation upon local school districts. To the extent the state implemented the act by\nfreely choosing to impose new programs or higher levels of service upon local school\ndistricts, the costs of such programs or higher levels of service are state mandated and subject\nto subvention.‖ (Hayes, supra, 11 Cal.App.4th at p. 1594.)\n\n\n       13   Statutes 1977, chapter 1247 and Statutes 1980, chapter 797.\n\n                                                  28\n\f       In Long Beach Unified, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2145265\"><a href=\"/opinion/2145265/long-beach-unified-sch-dist-v-state-of-calif/\"><span class=\"volume\">225</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

(Id.\nat p. 165.) The Long Beach Unified School District claimed the costs associated with the\norder were state mandates, even though the school district was under a federal constitutional\nobligation to desegregate. (Id. at pp. 163, 172.) In spite of this federal constitutional mandate,\nLong Beach Unified found a state mandate because the requirements of the executive order\nwent beyond constitutional and case law requirements because while courts had suggested\nthat certain steps and approaches may be helpful in complying with federal law, the executive\norder and guidelines required specific actions. ―For example, school districts are to conduct\nmandatory biennial racial and ethnic surveys, develop a ‗reasonably feasible‘ plan every four\nyears to alleviate and prevent segregation, include certain specific elements in each plan, and\ntake mandatory steps to involve the community, including public hearings which have been\nadvertised in a specific manner.‖ While these steps fit within the federal constitutional\n―reasonably feasible‖ standard of United States Supreme Court cases, the steps were ―no\nlonger merely being suggested as options which the local school district may wish to consider\nbut are required acts. These requirements constitute a higher level of service.‖ (Id. at p. 173.)\n               2.     The Maximum Extent Practicable Standard\n       Title 33 United States Code section 1342(p)(3)(B)(iii) provides that permits for\ndischarges from municipal storm sewers ―shall require controls to reduce the discharge of\npollutants to the maximum extent practicable, including management practices, control\ntechniques and system, design and engineering methods, and such other provisions as the\nAdministrator or the State determines appropriate for the control of such pollutants.‖\n       The evolution of this section, and the concept of maximum extent practicable, were\ndiscussed at length in Building Industry, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2274816\"><a href=\"/opinion/2274816/bldg-indus-assn-v-water-resources-bd/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

[Citations.] In response, in 1972 Congress\nsubstantially amended [the Clean Water Act] by mandating compliance with various\nminimum technological effluent standards established by the federal government and creating\na comprehensive regulatory scheme to implement these laws. [Citation.] The objective of\nthis law . . . was to ‗restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the\nNation‘s waters.‘‖ (Building Industry, supra, 124 Cal.App.4th at p. 872; 33 U.S.C.\n§ 1251(a).)\n         As enacted in 1972, the Clean Water Act mandated that an NPDES permit require\ncompliance with state water quality standards and that this goal be met by setting forth a\nspecific ―effluent limitation,‖ which is a restriction on the amount of pollutants that may be\ndischarged at the point source. (33 U.S.C. §§ 1311, 136(11).) Shortly after the 1972\nlegislation, the EPA promulgated regulations exempting most municipal storm sewers from\nthe NPDES permit requirements. However, the District of Columbia Circuit held a storm\nsewer is a point source and the EPA did not have the authority to exempt categories of point\nsources from the Clean Water Act‘s NPDES permit requirements. (Natural Resources\nDefense Council, Inc. v. Costle (D.C.

Costle rejected\nthe EPA‘s argument that effluent-based storm sewer regulation was administratively\ninfeasible because of the variable nature of storm water pollution and the number of affected\nstorm sewers throughout the country. Although Costle acknowledged the practical problems\nrelating to storm sewer regulation, the court found the EPA had the flexibility under the Clean\nWater Act to design regulations that would overcome these problems. (Costle, at pp. 1377–\n1383.)\n         During the next 15 years, the EPA made numerous attempts to reconcile the statutory\nrequirement of point source regulation with the practical problem of regulating possibly\nmillions of diverse point source discharges of storm water. Eventually, in 1987, Congress\namended the Clean Water Act to add provisions that specifically concerned NPDES permit\nrequirements for storm sewer discharges. (33 U.S.C. § 1342(p).)

An effluent limitation is ―any restriction\nestablished by a State or the [EPA] Administrator on quantities, rates, and concentrations of\nchemical, physical, biological, and other constituents which are discharged from point sources\ninto navigable waters . . . .‖ (33 U.S.C. § 1362(11).)

(PUD No. 1 of Jefferson County, supra, 511\nU.S. at p. 704.) Water-quality standards are developed in a two-step process.

In Environmental Defense Center, Inc. v. U.S.E.P.A. (9th\nCir. 2003) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783666\"><a href=\"/opinion/783666/environmental-defense-center-inc-natural-resources-defense-council/\"><span class=\"volume\">344</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">832</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Environmental Defense Center), the Ninth Circuit considered a\nchallenge to a ―Phase II‖ EPA rule for small municipal storm sewer systems. Among other\nthings, the Phase II Rule allowed small municipal storm sewer systems to seek permission to\ndischarge pollutants by submitting an individualized set of best management practices\ndesigned by each municipal storm sewer system (―stormwater management plans‖), either in\nthe form of an individual permit application or in the form of a notice of intent (NOI) to\ncomply with a general permit. (Id. at p. 842.) As long as an NOI included a stormwater\nmanagement plan, the EPA deemed a municipal storm sewer system to be in compliance with\nthe relevant standards of the Clean Water Act, including the standard that municipal\nstormwater pollution be reduced to the ―maximum extent practicable.‖ (Id. at p. 855; 33\nU.S.C. § 1342(p)(3)(B)(iii); 40 C.F.R. § 123.35.) The Phase II Rule did not require NPDES\nauthorities to review the stormwater management plans themselves. The Ninth Circuit held,\nhowever, that the failure to require permitting authority review of the stormwater management\nplans violated the Clean Water Act. While the Ninth Circuit lauded the involvement of\nregulated parties in the development of individual stormwater pollution control programs, it\nemphasized that ―programs that are designed by regulated parties must, in every instance, be\nsubject to meaningful review by an appropriate regulating entity to ensure that each such\nprogram reduces the discharge of pollutants to the maximum extent practicable [i.e., the\nrelevant statutory standard].‖ (Environmental Defense Center, at p. 856.) The Phase II Rule,\nby contrast, failed to require that the relevant permitting authorities review the stormwater\nmanagement plans to ―ensure that the measures that any given operator of a [small municipal\nstorm sewer system] has decided to undertake will in fact reduce discharges to the maximum\nextent practicable.‖ (Id. at p. 855.) Accordingly, Environmental Defense Center held the\nPhase II Rule provided no safeguard against a municipal storm sewer system‘s\n―misunderstanding or misrepresenting its own stormwater situation and proposing a set of\nminimum measures for itself that would reduce discharges by far less than the maximum\n\n\n                                               33\n\fextent practicable.‖ (Ibid.) The Ninth Circuit concluded that the EPA‘s failure to require\nreview of NOI‘s and the EPA‘s failure to make NOI‘s available to the public or subject to\npublic hearings contravened the express requirements of the Clean Water Act, and vacated\nthose portions of the Phase II Rule that addressed procedural issues relating to the issuance of\nNOI‘s under the small municipal storm sewer general permit option, and remanded to the\nEPA to permit the EPA to take appropriate action to comply with the Clean Water Act.

However, Title 33 United States\nCode section 1342(p)(3)(B)(iii) is a unique statute and imposes a broad standard in\nrecognition of developing clean water technology; thus, general-purpose mandate analysis\nis of limited utility in the area of clean water law precisely because the Clean Water Act\nrecognizes that the states function, for practical purposes, as arms of the EPA in\nimplementing the Clean Water Act. Thus, when a state implements the federal maximum\nextent practicable standard in an NPDES permit, we cannot say the state is acting in the\ntraditional governmental role of a state; rather, although the state provides the\ninfrastructure necessary to meet clean water standards, it acts on behalf of the EPA in\ndoing so.\n       The EPA‘s oversight and veto control of the NPDES program, and the Clean Water\nAct‘s goal of permitting each locality to fashion the appropriate measure to address pollution\nproblems by applying evolving clean water technology, convince us that Building Industry,\nsupra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2274816\"><a href=\"/opinion/2274816/bldg-indus-assn-v-water-resources-bd/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

The states and local agencies are required by their own\nunique waterway conditions to adopt requirements to alleviate pollution; the federal\nregulations recognize that the federal government has a limited role in specifying what the\nspecific measures must be.\n       Administrative agency decisions come to court with a strong presumption of\ncorrectness based on Evidence Code section 664 that ―official duty has been regularly\nperformed.‖ (Fukuda v. City of Angels, supra, 20 Cal.4th at p. 812.) ―‗Obviously,\nconsiderable weight should be given to the findings of experienced administrative bodies\nmade after a full and formal hearing, especially in cases involving technical and scientific\nevidence.‘‖ (Ibid., quoting Drummey v. State Bd. of Funeral Directors (1939) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1122172\"><a href=\"/opinion/1122172/drummey-v-state-board-of-funeral-directors/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">75</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 86.) Inherent in a Regional Board‘s determination is a recognition that the specific action\nrequirements under the Permit have been decided to be within the ―maximum extent\npracticable‖ standard of the Clean Water Act. However, this is not to say that any action\nrequirement that might advance the objectives of the Clean Water Act is automatically within\nthe maximum extent practicable standard.\n       In reviewing whether particular mandates fall within the maximum extent practicable\nstandard, with respect to the trash receptacle and inspection provisions at issue, we apply\nBuilding Industry, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2274816\"><a href=\"/opinion/2274816/bldg-indus-assn-v-water-resources-bd/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">866</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> and balance numerous factors, including the\nparticular requirement‘s technical feasibility, cost, public acceptance, regulatory compliance,\nand effectiveness. (Id. at p. 889.) Trash receptacles are a simple method of keeping\nstormwater clean because they prevent trash and other debris from entering storm drains and\nentering the ocean and local rivers and drainage canals. Inspections to insure that the\ncommercial, industrial and construction sites likewise maintain careful practices to prevent\nstormwater from becoming contaminated is a first line of defense; indeed, insuring\ncompliance in these areas places some of the burden for maintaining clean water on private\nparties. As a result, those provisions further the state Clean Water Act goal of reducing\npollution to the maximum extent practicable and thus constitute federal mandates. However,\n\n\n\n                                               35\n\fgiven the flexibility and mutability of the maximum extent practicable standard, of necessity\nour decision is limited to the specific mandates addressed here.\n       The County argues that the Regional Board is empowered to enforce the provisions of\nthe state-issued GIASP and GCASP and to charge fees for inspections under Water Code\nsection 13260, subdivision (d), and shifted this obligation to the County by including the\ninspection requirements in the Permit. We disagree that the Permit improperly shifted the\ninspection requirements of the GIASP and GCASP. The County‘s argument assumes\n(without evidentiary or logical support) that the inspection obligations in the GIASP and\nGCASP are purely state mandates or a combination of federal and state mandates. We\ndisagree; the GIASP and GCASP expressly and solely provide that they are issued to comply\nwith the Clean Water Act and EPA regulations. Thus, shifting the federally-mandated GIASP\nand GCASP inspection obligations via the Permit‘s inspections could not constitute the\nshifting of a state mandate.\n               C.     Substantial Evidence\n       The County argues that the Commission‘s decision that the trash receptacle obligation\nwas not a federal mandate was supported by substantial evidence, as was its finding that the\ninspection obligations were not federal mandates. We have concluded that the Commission\nerred in the first instance in failing to consider the proper legal framework for analyzing the\nsubvention question, the Permit‘s requirements are not state mandates as a matter of law, and\nthus do not reach the issue of whether substantial evidence supports its conclusions.14\n\n       14 The Department of Finance contends the court addressed the mandate issue of\nthe trash receptacles and inspection requirements in an unpublished portion of County of\nLos Angeles v. State Water Resources Control Bd., supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2249791\"><a href=\"/opinion/2249791/county-of-los-angeles-v-california-st-water-resources-control-bd/\"><span class=\"volume\">143</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">985</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. To rebut\nthis argument and to establish that they appropriately raised the issue of unfunded state\nmandates, the County requests that we take judicial notice of two orders issued by the\nSuperior Court in County of Los Angeles v. Regional Quality Control Board for the Los\nAngeles Region (2005, No. BS080758), in which the court sustained demurrers to the\nCounty‘s claim that the permit requirements at issue were unfunded state mandates. In\nthose orders, the trial court held that the appropriate vehicle for challenging the permit\nrequirements was to file a test claim with the Commission. We take judicial notice of\nthose documents. (Evid. Code, §§ 452, 459.) We conclude the trial court did not address\n\n                                               36\n\fIII.   Preemption\n       Amicus Building Association argues that we should apply federal preemption analysis\nto the question and determine that federal law does not preempt state law; therefore, the\nadditional requirements, being creatures of state law and the Regional Board‘s exercise of its\nown discretion, constitute state mandates because they exceed the prior permits. Further,\nBuilding Association argues that the federal statutes and regulations constitute a federal\ndirective to exercise unfettered state discretion; thus, the proper question before the trial court\nwas whether the Regional Board exceeded its state discretion when it determined the\nmaximum extent practicable relative to the MS4 permits. As a result, no MS4 permit would\nexceed the maximum extent practicable because that maximum extent practicable is whatever\nthe Regional Board divines it to be. The Department of Finance responds that federal\npreemption is not relevant where the issue to be decided is whether a federal or a state\nmandate exists. Rather, the inquiry is on the scope of the requirements of federal law.\n       ―The supremacy clause of the United States Constitution establishes a constitutional\nchoice-of-law rule, makes federal law paramount, and vests Congress with the power to\npreempt state law.‖ (Viva! Internat. Voice for Animals v. Adidas Promotional Retail\nOperations, Inc. (2007) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2586360\"><a href=\"/opinion/2586360/viva-international-voice-v-adidas-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">929</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 935.) ―There is a presumption against federal\npreemption in those areas traditionally regulated by the states.‖ (Id. at p. 938.) Therefore,\n―‗[w]e start with the assumption that the historic police powers of the States were not to be\nsuperseded by the Federal Act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.‘\n[Citations.]‖ (Ibid.) ―There are four species of federal preemption: express, conflict,\nobstacle, and field.‖ (Id. at p. 935.)\n\n\n\n\nthe issue of whether the Permit‘s requirements were state mandates; rather, the trial court\nheld that the Commission was the appropriate vehicle for determination of state\nmandates. Further, the appellate court in County of Los Angeles v. State Water Resources\nControl Bd., supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2249791\"><a href=\"/opinion/2249791/county-of-los-angeles-v-california-st-water-resources-control-bd/\"><span class=\"volume\">143</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">985</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> did not decide the issue. Thus, the opinion was\nnot binding on the Commission or any other adjudicatory entity on the issue of state\nmandates. (See Boeken v. Philip Morris USA, Inc., supra, 48 Cal.4th at p. 797.)\n\n                                                37\n\f       As our discussion of the federal mandate issue demonstrates, the Permit, although\nissued by a state agency under enabling Water Code provisions, is a federal permit that\nimplements federal law in the form of the maximum extent practicable standard. As a result,\nthere is no California law that might be preempted, and federal preemption analysis is\ninapposite.\nIV.    Removal of Commission’s Discretion; Remand\n       The County contends the trial court erred in reversing the Commission‘s decision; but\neven if the Commission erred in its analysis of the test claims, the trial court should have\nremanded the matter for further proceedings to permit the Commission to exercise its\ndiscretion properly. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1094.5, subd. (f); National Auto. & Cas. Ins. Co. v.\nDowney (1950) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1409571\"><a href=\"/opinion/1409571/national-auto-cas-ins-co-v-downey/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">586</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 594.) The Department of Finance contends remand is\ninappropriate because there is nothing for the Commission to exercise its discretion over\nbecause its decision was based upon faulty legal conclusions. As we conclude that the trial\ncourt correctly applied the maximum extent practicable standard and found the Permit‘s\nrequirements did not, as a matter of law, constitute unfunded state mandates because those\nrequirements originated in the federal maximum extent practicable standard, remand to the\nCommission is unnecessary.\n                                        DISPOSITION\n       The judgment is affirmed.
