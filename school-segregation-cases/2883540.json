On the\nother hand, Hartford Insurance Company, the plan administrator\n(who also happens to fund the plan), has hired reviewing\nphysicians who maintain that Post is not disabled. In other\nwords, the central issue in this case—whether Post is\ndisabled—is a “battle of the experts.”\n\n       “Battle-of-the-experts” cases are often easy for a\nreviewing court. If the trial court’s standard of review is\narbitrary and capricious, then Hartford usually wins when it has\nproduced sufficient evidence supporting its position. It cannot\nbe said to have acted arbitrarily, and summary judgment in its\nfavor is appropriate. On the other hand, if the standard is de\nnovo, then summary judgment for either party must be vacated\nbecause there is credible evidence on both sides of the key fact\nquestion.\n\n        But this case, a claim that ERISA benefits were\nimproperly denied, is anything but easy, for the trial court’s\nstandard of review is neither arbitrary and capricious (at least in\nits traditional form) nor de novo. In these cases, district courts\nmust select a standard of review that accords with the extent to\nwhich the plan administrator operates under a conflict of\ninterest. Here we conclude that the District Court did not select\nthe proper standard of review, and so we vacate and remand for\nconsideration under the standard we deem to apply.\n\n       We affirm, however, the Court’s grant of summary\n\n                                3\n\fjudgment on Post’s claim for breach of fiduciary duty because\nit is barred by res judicata.\n\nI.     Facts and Procedural History\n\n       Carol Post was in a serious car accident in November\n1993, just a few days after having major dental surgery. At the\ntime, she was employed as a dentist by Overlook Hospital in\nSummit, New Jersey. She sustained a whiplash injury in the\naccident, but she nonetheless attempted to return to work soon\nafterward. After six days of working, she was forced to stop\nbecause of intractable pain. Overlook, however, offered for her\nto try working as a pharmacist for a while (as she has both\ndentistry and pharmacy degrees), and she accepted. She\nreturned to work in December 1993, but was forced to take\nnearly a day off each week because of pain. After nine months\nof off-and-on working, she resigned due to pain in September\n1994. During this period, she tried numerous physical therapy\ntreatments, none of which significantly improved her condition.\nShe returned to work again in January 1995, but resigned four\nmonths later because of continuing pain. She has not worked\nsince.\n\n       Post’s medical record is voluminous. Between 1993 and\n2003, she visited 14 doctors. Her pain management regimens\nranged from traditional treatments like prescription drug\ncombinations, trigger-point injections, and various forms of\nphysical therapy, to more exotic treatments like acupuncture and\n\n                               4\n\fbiofeedback. She reports that none has given her significant\nrelief. Her primary treating physician is currently Dr. Carolyn\nBritton, a professor of neurology at Columbia University.\nAccording to Dr. Britton, Post suffers from chronic post-\ntraumatic pain syndrome characterized by severe myofacial\npain; regular, debilitating headaches accompanied by sensitivity\nto light, nausea, and vomiting; irritable bowel syndrome; and\ninsomnia. Dr. Britton believes that this syndrome is directly\nattributable to Post’s car accident and that it renders her disabled\nfrom any sustained employment.\n\n       In keeping with Dr. Britton’s determination, Post’s view\nof the record is that it indicates that she sustained a traumatic\nwhiplash injury that sensitized her central nervous system, thus\ntriggering the development of chronic pain syndrome. This is\nDr. Britton’s diagnosis, and it is supported by a number of other\nevaluations in the record.\n\n        Hartford, on the other hand, believes that the record\nindicates that Post suffered no more than a whiplash injury that\nhas now healed. While it concedes that Post continues to report\npain, it contends that the record contains no reliable diagnosis of\na recognized debilitating condition. In support of its view,\nHartford primarily relies on the reports of Dr. Ekaterina\nMalievskaia, its reviewing physician, and Dr. Christopher\nLynch, who performed an independent medical examination.\nHartford also cites the opinions of Drs. Michael John Fiore and\n\n\n\n                                 5\n\fJoel Harris,1 who evaluated Post in 1994 and 1996, respectively.\n\n\n   1\n     Dr. Harris’s conclusion on the issue of disability is, at best,\nunclear. On a Hartford form, he indicated that Post could sit,\nstand, walk, and drive for one hour each in an eight-hour\nworkday. The form asked that he circle for each activity a\nnumber between one and eight. Zero was not an option. In any\nevent, his responses indicate that she could sit, stand, walk, and\ndrive for a total of four of eight hours. It is unclear how she\ncould maintain employment without sitting, standing, walking,\nor driving for the other four hours of a typical day.\n         In addition Dr. Harris noted that Post could not lift or\ncarry any weight at all, not even one pound. Nor could she\nclimb, balance, stoop, kneel, crouch, crawl, reach, handle,\nfinger, or feel.\n         Hartford and our dissenting colleague focus on the fact\nthat, in a section asking what degree of work Post could tolerate,\nHarris checked “sedentary work.” This was the least intensive\noption available. The form did not provide a way of responding\nthat the patient could not tolerate work at all.\n         In the comments section of the form, Dr. Harris wrote:\n                Severe pain — head, neck, & lower jaw.\n                Back pain limits any mobility without\n                severe pain. Cannot sit in chair for\n                treatment without pain.\nThese comments and responses render the form, at the least,\nambiguous as to Post’s condition. Read most fairly, the great\nweight of the form indicates a significant level of disability. It\ntakes a highly selective reading to conclude that it indicates that\nPost was capable of working (without sitting, standing, walking,\n\n                                 6\n\f       This case is governed by the Employee Retirement\nIncome Security Act (“ERISA”), 29 U.S.C. §§ 1001–1461,\nbecause Overlook Hosiptal’s disability plan (the “Plan”) is an\n“employee welfare benefit plan” as defined by 29 U.S.C.\n§ 1002(1). Post filed a disability claim with Hartford,\nOverlook’s disability carrier, soon after she ceased working in\n1995. Hartford approved her claim, subject to periodic renewal.\nTo be considered “totally disabled” under the Plan after\nDecember 6, 1997, she had to be “prevented by [d]isability from\ndoing any occupation or work for which [she was] or could\nbecome qualified.”\n\n       From 1995 until 2002, Hartford paid out benefits. In\nAugust 1998, the Social Security Administration approved\nPost’s application for disability benefits, citing intractable\ncervical pain, chronic pain syndrome, and fibromyalgia 2 as the\n\n\nor driving, for half of the workday).\n   2\n       In the words of Judge Posner, fibromyalgia is\n          a common, but elusive and mysterious, disease,\n          much like chronic fatigue syndrome, with which\n          it shares a number of features. See Frederick\n          Wolfe et al., “The American College of\n          Rheumatology 1990 Criteria for the Classification\n          of Fibromyalgia: Report of the Multicenter\n          Criteria Committee,” 33 Arthritis & Rheumatism\n          160 (1990); Lawrence M. Tierney, Jr., Stephen J.\n          McPhee & Maxine A. Papadakis, Current\n\n                                 7\n\frelevant diagnoses. Soon after Post was approved for Social\nSecurity benefits, Hartford asked her to submit a copy of the\nadministrative decision so that it could offset her benefits. She\nresponded through counsel that Hartford was not entitled to an\noffset under the plain language of the Plan, but she did provide\nHartford with a copy of the decision. Hartford eventually\nrelented and accepted Post’s reading of the Plan.\n\n       For reasons not apparent from the record, sometime in\n\n\n\n      Medical Diagnosis & Treatment 1995 708-09\n      (1995). Its cause or causes are unknown, there is\n      no cure, and, of greatest importance to disability\n      law, its symptoms are entirely subjective. There\n      are no laboratory tests for the presence or severity\n      of fibromyalgia. The principal symptoms are\n      “pain all over,” fatigue, disturbed sleep, stiffness,\n      and—the only symptom that discriminates\n      between it and other diseases of a rheumatic\n      character—multiple tender spots, more precisely\n      18 fixed locations on the body (and the rule of\n      thumb is that the patient must have at least 11 of\n      them to be diagnosed as having fibromyalgia) that\n      when pressed firmly cause the patient to flinch.\n      All these symptoms are easy to fake, although few\n      applicants for disability benefits may yet be aware\n      of the specific locations that if palpated will cause\n      the patient who really has fibromyalgia to flinch.\nSarchet v. Charter, 78 F.3d 305, 306–07 (7th Cir. 1996).\n\n                               8\n\flate 1999 Hartford took a renewed interest in Post’s claim. The\ncompany surveilled her and reported in its claim notes that\nsurveillance was unsuccessful, as she was not seen leaving her\nhouse. Hartford also began requesting copies of Post’s tax\nrecords, ostensibly to take a non-Social Security income offset,\nas the Plan allowed. It provides that “Hartford has the right to\nrequire, as part of Proof of Loss: (1) your [Post’s] signed\nstatement identifying all Other Income Benefits, and (2)\n[s]atisfactory proof to the Hartford that you and your\nDependents have duly applied for all Other Income Benefits\nwhich are available. The Hartford reserves the right to\ndetermine if proof of loss is satisfactory.” Hartford contends\nthat the “proof . . . that you . . . have duly applied for all Other\nIncome Benefits” language gives it the right to demand tax\nreturns, though it is not clear how a tax return would reflect\nwhether Post had applied for other income benefits. The plain\nlanguage of this provision does not authorize the review of tax\nreturns. (Incidentally, the tax returns confirm that Post was not\nreceiving any income during the disputed period.)\n\n       In June 2001, Hartford determined that Post should\nsubmit to an independent functional capacity evaluation to\nconfirm her disability. This was permissible under the Plan.\nHartford hired a third-party service to notify Post of its request\nand to set up the evaluation. Because Post had requested that all\ncommunication go through counsel, the service’s operator\nphoned her attorney to schedule the evaluation. Here, the\nconfusion began. As Hartford’s counsel explained at oral\n\n                                 9\n\fargument, apparently the service’s operator told Post’s attorney\nthat Post had requested that he be phoned to schedule the\nevaluation—meaning simply that Post had requested that all\ncommunication go through him. Post’s attorney took the\nstatement to mean that Post had requested the evaluation; thus,\nwhen he spoke with Post and found that she knew nothing about\nit, he relayed to the service that she had not requested it. It then\nreported to Hartford that Post had refused an evaluation in\nviolation of the Plan. No written request was ever made.\n\n       In lieu of a functional capacity evaluation, Hartford\nreferred Post’s file to its medical director, Dr. Malievskaia. She\nconducted a paper review and concluded that Post was not\ndisabled because of a lack of objective findings, specifically the\nabsence of 11 of 18 potential trigger points that would support\na diagnosis of fibromyalgia.\n\n        In January 2002, Hartford terminated Post’s benefits. In\nits termination letter, Hartford quoted the Plan’s termination\ntriggers, putting the following in bold font: “the date you refuse\nto be examined, if The Hartford requires an examination.” The\nletter went on to cite as the bases for termination Post’s alleged\nfailure to submit to an evaluation at Hartford’s request and Dr.\nMalievskaia’s conclusion that Post was not disabled. The letter\nalso invited Post to file an appeal within 60 days and to send any\ndocuments that she believed relevant. In March 2002, Hartford\ndenied Post’s appeal. Hartford, however, recognized the\nconfusion over scheduling the evaluation and offered to revisit\n\n                                10\n\fits decision if she agreed to one. In the meantime, Post had sued\nHartford for wrongful denial of benefits, and undergoing an\nevaluation became part of a settlement agreement. The\nsettlement fully resolved that lawsuit.\n\n        Because Post’s treating physicians refused to write a\nprescription for a full-scale functional capacity evaluation, citing\nthe damage it might cause given Post’s condition, Hartford\nagreed to a less strenuous examination. To perform the exam,\nHartford hired Dr. Christopher Lynch. The record does not\nreflect any board certifications or specialties, only that he is a\nphysician. His examination consisted primarily of testing Post\nfor the 18 trigger points for fibromyalgia. Finding tenderness\nbut no definite trigger points, Dr. Lynch concluded that she did\nnot have fibromyalgia or any other disabling condition. After he\nsubmitted his report, Hartford issued a final denial of Post’s\nclaim. Hartford specifically directed Dr. Lynch not to submit\nhis report to Post, so she had no opportunity to respond to it.\n\n        Post then filed this suit in the District Court. In it, she\nclaims that Hartford violated 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(1) and (2).\nSubparagraph 1132(a)(1)(B) allows an ERISA plan beneficiary\nto sue “to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his\nplan, to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan, or to\nclarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.”\nParagraph 1132(a)(2) allows a beneficiary to sue for breaches of\nfiduciary duties that cause losses to the plan.\n\n\n\n                                11\n\f       The District Court granted summary judgment in\nHartford’s favor on the § 1132(a)(1)(B) claim, ruling that Post\ncould not establish that Hartford acted arbitrarily and\ncapriciously in denying her benefits. The Court also granted\nHartford summary judgment on the § 1132(a)(2) claim on the\nground that it was barred by res judicata. Specifically, the\nCourt noted that it had dismissed that claim with prejudice in\nPost’s previous suit, and so she could not revive it in this suit.\nPost appeals both rulings.3\n\nII.       Deciding § 1132(a)(1)(B) Claims\n\n          A.    The Sliding Scale Standard of Review\n\n        ERISA does not specify the standard of review that a trial\ncourt should apply in an action for wrongful denial of benefits.\nIn Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v. Bruch, 489 U.S. 101, 113\n(1989), the Supreme Court held that the default standard of\nreview in all § 1132(a)(1)(B) cases is de novo. The Court noted\nin a dictum that when a plan by its terms gives the administrator\ndiscretion, which the plan at issue in Firestone did not, the\nadministrator’s decisions are upheld unless they abuse that\n\n\n      3\n    The District Court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331;\nwe have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291. Because this is an\nappeal from a grant of summary judgment, our review is\nplenary. Vitale v. Latrobe Area Hosp., 420 F.3d 278, 281 (3d\nCir. 2005).\n\n                               12\n\fdiscretion. Id. at 115. On the issue of conflicts of interest, the\nCourt noted that “if a benefit plan gives discretion to an\nadministrator or fiduciary who is operating under a conflict of\ninterest, that conflict must be weighed as a ‘facto[r] in\ndetermining whether there is an abuse of discretion.’” Id.\n(quoting Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 187 cmt. d (1959)).\n\n        Addressing conflicts of interest in the post-Firestone era,\nmost courts of appeals have adopted a “sliding scale” standard\nof review. This approach grants the administrator deference in\naccordance with the level of conflict. Thus, if the level of\nconflict is slight, most of the administrator’s deference remains\nintact, and the court applies something similar to traditional\narbitrary and capricious review; conversely, if the level of\nconflict is high, then most of its discretion is stripped away.\nDoe v. Group Hospitalization & Med. Servs., 3 F.3d 80, 87 (4th\nCir. 1993).\n\n        In Judge Becker’s scholarly opinion in Pinto v. Reliance\nStandard Life Insurance Co., 214 F.3d 377, 392 (3d Cir. 2000),\nwe cast our lot with the sliding scale approach. Among the\neleven courts of appeals that have reported decisions in this\narea, six have adopted some version of the sliding scale.4 Id.;\n\n\n      4\n         The Tenth and Eleventh Circuit Courts, rather than\nadjusting the level of scrutiny, shift the burden of proof to the\nadministrator when the employee presents evidence of a conflict\nof interest. Fought v. UNUM Life Ins. Co. of Am., 379 F.3d 997,\n\n                                13\n\fVega v. Nat’l Life Ins. Servs., Inc., 188 F.3d 287, 296 (5th Cir.\n1999) (en banc); Woo v. Deluxe Corp., 144 F.3d 1157, 1161–62\n(8th Cir. 1998); Chojnacki v. Georgia-Pacific Corp., 108 F.3d\n810, 815 (7th Cir. 1997); Doe, 3 F.3d at 87; Miller v. Metro. Life\nIns. Co., 925 F.2d 979, 984 (6th Cir. 1991). In addition, the\nNinth Circuit Court of Appeals follows a “substantially similar”\napproach, though it rejects the sliding-scale metaphor. Abatie\nv. Alta Health & Life Ins. Co., 458 F.3d 955, 967 (9th Cir. 2006)\n(en banc) (choosing simply to note that “[a] district court, when\n\n\n\n1004–07 (10th Cir. 2004); Williams v. BellSouth Telecomms.,\nInc., 373 F.3d 1132, 1138 (11th Cir. 2004). The Second Circuit\nCourt of Appeals holds that once the claimant has shown the\npotential for bias, the court strips away the administrator’s\ndiscretion and reviews its decision de novo. Sullivan v. LTV\nAerospace & Defense Co., 82 F.3d 1251, 1256 (2d Cir. 1996).\nThe First Circuit Court of Appeals applies unvarnished arbitrary\nand capricious review, Doe v. Travelers Ins. Co., 167 F.3d 53,\n57 (1st Cir. 1999), though two of the six active judges on that\nCourt have criticized this approach. Denmark v. Liberty Life\nAssur. Co. of Boston, 481 F.3d 16, 31 (1st Cir. 2007) (Opinion\nof Lipez, J.) (urging adoption of the sliding scale); id. at 41\n(Howard, J., dissenting) (agreeing that the arbitrary and\ncapricious standard should be reconsidered). But see id. at 40\n(Opinion of Selya, J.) (defending arbitrary and capricious\nreview). The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals has not yet decided\nthe issue. See Wagener v. SBC Pension Beneit Plan—Non\nBargained Program, 407 F.3d 395, 402 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (noting\nthe circuit split).\n\n                               14\n\ffaced with all the facts and circumstances, must decide in each\ncase how much or how little to credit the plan administrator's\nreason for denying insurance coverage”). In Pinto, we held that\nthe sliding scale approach was most faithful to Firestone’s\ncommand that the level of conflict be considered as a factor in\nshaping arbitrary and capricious review. 214 F.3d at 392.\n\n       B.     Contours of the Sliding Scale\n\n       The premise of the sliding scale approach is that courts\nshould examine benefit denials on their facts to determine\nwhether the administrator abused its discretion. Id. at 391. To\napply the approach, courts first consider the evidence that the\nadministrator acted from an improper motive and heighten their\nlevel of scrutiny appropriately. Id. at 392. Second, they review\nthe merits of the decision and the evidence of impropriety\ntogether to determine whether the administrator properly\nexercised the discretion accorded it. Id. at 394. If so, its\ndecision stands; if not, the court steps into the shoes of the\nadministrator and rules on the merits itself.\n\n       At its best, the sliding scale reduces to making a\ncommon-sense decision based on the evidence whether the\nadministrator appropriately exercised its discretion. This theme,\nrather than getting bogged down in trying to find the perfect\npoint on the sliding scale, should be district courts’ touchstone.\n\n\n\n\n                               15\n\f       C.      Sorting Individual Cases\n\n       Determining how to apply heightened arbitrary and\ncapricious review requires considering both structural and\nprocedural factors. Pinto, 214 F.3d at 392–93. The structural\ninquiry focuses on the financial incentives created by the way\nthe plan is organized, whereas the procedural inquiry focuses on\nhow the administrator treated the particular claimant. While\nthere is no magic to the order in which these inquiries are\nconducted, our previous cases have considered structure first.\nWe do the same.\n\n               1.     Structural factors\n\n        Our concern with structure derives from the common law\nof trusts. As the Supreme Court noted in Firestone, the law of\ntrusts requires that courts take a trustee’s self-interest into\naccount. 489 U.S. at 115 (quoting Restatement (Second) of\nTrusts § 187 cmt. d (1959)).               The Court based this\npronouncement primarily on the Second Restatement. Since\nthen, the ALI has published the Third Restatement, which\nfurther clarifies that while it is permissible for a trustee to act\nunder a structural conflict of interest, its discretionary decisions\n“will be subject to especially careful scrutiny.” Restatement\n(Third) of Trusts § 37 cmt. f(1) (2003). Under ERISA, plan\nadministrators are, for most purposes, treated like common-law\ntrustees. Firestone, 489 U.S. at 110. Like common-law\ntrustees, plan administrators are accorded discretion and judicial\n\n                                16\n\fdeference (if the plan so provides); in return, they assume\nfiduciary duties of care and loyalty to their beneficiaries. 29\nU.S.C. § 1104(a). So long as we have no reason to doubt the\nadministrator’s faithfulness to those duties, this model works\nwell. We, however, are wary of according a fiduciary deference\nwhen the structure of the plan gives it financial incentives to act\nagainst the participants’ interest. See Restatement (Third) of\nTrusts § 50 illus. 1.\n\n        As an initial note, federal courts of appeals are split on\nthe issue of what is a structural conflict. We have long held that\na structural conflict arises when the administrator has a non-\ntrivial financial incentive to act against the interests of the\nbeneficiaries. Pinto, 214 F.3d at 389. Such a conflict is, by\nitself, sufficient to heighten our review.5 Id. at 390. Our\nCourt’s holdings are in line with black-letter trust law. The\nSecond Restatement, on which the Supreme Court relied in\nFirestone, defines a “conflict” as merely “an interest in the\ntrustee conflicting with that of the beneficiaries.” Restatement\n(Second) of Trusts § 187 cmt. d (1959). This statement is\nworded broadly—almost to the point of being tautological—but\n\n\n    5\n       In this regard, we share the view of the Fourth, Fifth,\nEighth, Tenth, and Eleventh Circuit Courts of Appeals. See\nFought, 379 F.3d at 1006; Vega, 188 F.3d at 295 n.8; Armstrong\nv. Aetna Life Ins. Co., 128 F.3d 1263, 1265 (8th Cir. 1997); Doe,\n3 F.3d at 86; Brown v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Alabama,\nInc., 898 F.2d 1556, 1561 (11th Cir. 1990).\n\n                                17\n\fit applies by its own terms to a situation in which the\nadministrator has an interest (e.g., in profit or a better bottom\nline) that is adverse to the interests of beneficiaries seeking\npayment.\n\n        In sharp disagreement, the Court of Appeals for the\nSeventh Circuit holds that it is improper to label those situations\n“conflicts of interest.” See Rud v. Liberty Life Assur. Co. of\nBoston, 438 F.3d 772, 776 (7th Cir 2006) (Posner, J.). The\nproblem, it argues, is that we generally assume that parties to a\ncontract are self-interested, and it is inimical to the law of\ncontracts to confuse self-interest with a conflict of interest. Id.\nThis is no doubt logical, yet the Supreme Court has held that\nERISA places us in the realm of trust law, not contract law.\nFirestone, 489 U.S. at 110–11. Moreover, were we to apply\ncontract law, we would review plans de novo from the start, for\nthere is no analog to fiduciary discretion in the common law of\ncontracts. But we are not, and our position, in strict accordance\nwith Supreme Court precedent, follows the common law of\ntrusts.\n\n       Pinto listed four non-exclusive structural factors for\ncourts to consider: (1) the sophistication of the parties, (2) the\ninformation accessible to the beneficiary, (3) the financial\narrangement between the employer and administrator, and (4)\nthe financial status of the administrator. 214 F.3d at 392. In\nsubsequent cases, we have also considered the administrator’s\nclaim evaluation process, according more deference to\n\n                                18\n\fadministrators that use an independent body to evaluate claims\n(thus lessening the effect of any conflict). Stratton v. E.I.\nDuPont De Nemours & Co., 363 F.3d 250, 255 (3d Cir. 2004).\nAll of these factors relate to whether the plan is set up so that the\nadministrator has strong financial incentives routinely to deny\nclaims in close cases—in short, whether the administrator’s\nincentives make treating it as an unbiased fiduciary\ncounterintuitive. Pinto, 214 F.3d at 388. We emphasize that\ncourts should focus on this question and not get bogged down in\nfactors, for this is anything but a mechanistic test. Rather, it is\na broad-based inquiry into whether the structure of the plan\nraises concerns about the administrator’s financial incentive to\ndeny coverage improperly. This makes sense, as ERISA plans\ncome in many forms.\n\n       We have held that two aspects of some plans’ financial\nstructure raise particular concern: (1) when a plan is funded on\na case-by-case basis, Skretvedt v. E.I. DuPont & De Nemours\nCo., 268 F.3d 167, 174 (3d Cir. 2001), and (2) when it is funded\nand administered by an outside insurer, Pinto, 214 F.3d at 390.\nCase-by-case funding simply means that the administrator pays\nclaims out of its operating budget, rather than from segregated\nmonies that the employer sets aside according to an actuarial\nformula. This raises concerns because it means that each dollar\npaid out is a dollar out of the administrator’s pocket. Stratton,\n363 F.3d at 254. Thus, the administrator has a financial\nincentive to deny claims.\n\n\n\n                                 19\n\f        This concern is compounded when it is an outside\ninsurer, rather than the employer, that funds and administers the\nplan, for we presume that employers have at least some self-\ninterest in seeing that benefits are paid fairly. After all,\nemployees’ morale will suffer if they perceive that their benefits\nare illusory. When the plan is funded by an outside insurer,\nhowever, the employer is a step removed from the process,\nmaking it less likely to feel the full effects of employee\ndissatisfaction with claims handling. Pinto, 214 F.3d at 389.6\n\n         We have also noted that when the claimant is a former\nemployee, any dissatisfaction with the claims handling process\nis less likely to translate into a significant financial disincentive\nfor the employer. Id. at 388. In addition, when the employer is\nin financial difficulty, the dissatisfaction of employees is less\nlikely to be an incentive favoring them because paying off\ncreditors will probably take priority over keeping up employee\nmorale. Id. at 392.\n\n       Importantly, under Pinto, the structural analysis does not\n\n\n  6\n    It is worth noting that we have held that when the employer\nboth funds and administers the plan, but pays benefits out of a\nfully funded and segregated ERISA trust fund rather than its\noperating budget, no structural conflict of interest is created.\nVitale, 420 F.3d at 282; Bill Gray Enters., Inc. Employee Health\n& Welfare Plan v. Gourley, 248 F.3d 206, 217–18 (3d Cir.\n2001).\n\n                                 20\n\fask about the administrator’s behavior. Indeed, as Pinto held,\nthe structure alone can require heightened review. 214 F.3d at\n390. Pinto itself concerned a structure in which the plan\nadministrator was an outside insurance company that received\nan actuarial premium from the employer. Id. Thus, what the\ninsurer/administrator paid out came directly off its bottom line.\nPinto noted that this structure creates a high level of financial\nconflict of interest, as the insurer/administrator has a strong\nincentive to construe claims in a light most favorable to it. Id.\nat 389. Thus, Pinto held that this structure alone gives rise to\nheightened scrutiny. Id. at 390.\n\n       When there is a structural conflict of interest mitigated by\nindependent claim evaluation and no evidence of procedural\nbias, we have heightened our review only slightly. Stratton, 363\nF.3d at 254–56. The animating logic of that case is that while\nthere was a conflict of interest, there was also good reason to\nbelieve that it was of little moment, and so we held that we\nwould defer to the administrator unless its decision was clearly\nunreasonable or not a product of an exercise of discretion at all.\n\n       When structural bias is not mitigated by independent\nclaim evaluation, we have heightened our review a bit more.\nSee Smathers v. Multi-Tool, Inc./Multi-Plastics, Inc. Employee\nHealth & Welfare Plan, 298 F.3d 191, 199 (3d Cir. 2002).\nThere, we emphasized that we were not free to substitute our\njudgment for that of the fiduciary. Nevertheless, because the\nrecord revealed that the administrator had not adequately\n\n                                21\n\fsupported its decision, we concluded that it had not properly\nexercised its discretion. Id. at 200.\n\n        It is worth noting that we have not reported a case in\nwhich structural factors alone warranted anything more than\nmoderately heightening our review. This is not fortuitous.\nStructural conflicts of interest warrant more searching review,\nbut in the absence of evidence that bias infected the particular\ndecision at issue, we defer to an administrator’s reasonable and\ncarefully considered conclusions. See Orvosh v. Program of\nGroup Ins. for Salaried Employees of Volkswagen of Am., Inc.,\n222 F.3d 123, 129 (3d Cir. 2000).\n\n               2.     Procedural Factors\n\n        As Pinto held, courts must also examine the process by\nwhich the administrator came to its decision to determine\nwhether there is evidence of bias. 214 F.3d at 393. This sort of\nevidence can come in many forms, and a review of the caselaw\nreveals that we have identified numerous procedural\nirregularities that can raise suspicion. The following is an\nillustrative, not exhaustive, list of the irregularities identified:\n(1) reversal of position without additional medical evidence, id.;\n(2) self-serving selectivity in the use and interpretation of\nphysicians’ reports, id.; (3) disregarding staff recommendations\nthat benefits be awarded, id. at 394; and (4) requesting a medical\nexamination when all of the evidence indicates disability,\nKosiba v. Merck & Co., 384 F.3d 58, 67 (3d Cir. 2004).\n\n                                22\n\f        In considering procedural factors, the focus is whether,\nin this claimant’s case, the administrator has given the court\nreason to doubt its fiduciary neutrality. If it has, then the court\nmust decide how much to heighten its scrutiny. If the\nirregularities are minor, few in number, and not sustained, then\nthey may not counsel for raising the level much at all, for minor\nglitches reasonably can be chalked up to low-level carelessness.\nIf, however, they are more serious, numerous, or regular, then\nthey should raise more suspicion. Kosiba, 384 F.3d at 66; Pinto,\n214 F.3d at 393. Given the administrator’s familiarity with the\nclaims process and the duties of a fiduciary, marked deviations\nfrom procedural norms cannot but raise questions about its\nneutrality.\n\n       In the face of significant evidence of procedural bias, we\nhave reviewed its decision closely. Pinto, 214 F.3d at 394.\nWhen an ERISA administrator is not acting in accord with its\nfiduciary status, we are naturally wary of according it much of\nthe deference that it would otherwise receive as a result of that\nstatus. Id. Evidence that an administrator’s decision was\nincorrect, coupled with evidence it was biased, can add up to a\nconclusion that its decision was not the product of reasoned\ndiscretion, but of anti-claimant bias, in which case the decision\nshould be reversed. Id. at 395.\n\n       In the face of non-trivial evidence of procedural bias, the\nstandard of review should be raised; the more difficult question\nis how much. In Kosiba, we discerned non-trivial evidence of\n\n                                23\n\fprocedural bias but, as it was neither egregious nor coupled with\nevidence of structural bias, we heightened our scrutiny only a\nmoderate amount. 384 F.3d at 68. In Pinto, on the other hand,\nwe found that the evidence of procedural bias was coupled with\nevidence of structural bias, and so we heightened our review\nsubstantially. 214 F.3d at 394.\n\nIII.   Applying the Sliding Scale to This Case\n\n       A.      Structural Factors\n\n       Addressing the structural factors, the District Court\nseemed to confuse the structural analyses in Pinto and Stratton.\nPinto held that a non-trivial structural conflict gives rise to\nheightened scrutiny—that is, it pushes the standard of review\nabove the low end of the sliding scale. 214 F.3d at 393.\nStratton added that when the structural conflict is trivial, the low\nend of the scale is appropriate. 363 F.3d at 254–55. What made\nt h e c o n f l ic t triv ia l in S tr a tto n w a s t h a t t h e\nemployer/administrator, while conflicted, was a step removed\nfrom the claim evaluation process. Id. Here, on the other hand,\nthe administrator is an outside insurer that makes claims\ndecisions itself. This is the very sort of conflict that Pinto\ndeclared to be substantial and worthy of raising the standard of\nreview. 214 F.3d at 393. In addition, Post is a former\nemployee, so it is doubtful that her dissatisfaction with the\nclaims-handling process will filter back to Overlook and\ntranslate into pressure on Hartford to deal more precisely with\n\n                                24\n\fclaims.\n\n       The District Court correctly noted that the other factors\nmentioned in Pinto—sophistication of the parties, accessibility\nof information, and the financial status of the\nadministrator—seem not to counsel in favor of heightened\nscrutiny. Following Pinto, however, the structural factors that\ndo present a conflict of interest are sufficient to require at least\nmoderately heightened review. Id. We now proceed to whether\nprocedural factors counsel us to increase even more our degree\nof review.\n\n       B.      Procedural Factors\n\n        On the issue of procedural irregularities, the District\nCourt wrote that “procedural anomalies appear to form a pattern\nof Hartford being overly aggressive in its attempts to reduce or\neliminate Post’s [disability] benefits and then attempting to\nrectify the situation when it realized its error.” The Court named\nfour aspects of the process that appeared irregular, yet it\nultimately concluded that they were too minor to heighten\nfurther its scrutiny. We address each in turn and two additional\nmatters brought up by Post.\n\n       First, Hartford attempted to use Post’s Social Security\nbenefits to offset her disability benefits, despite the Plan not\nallowing such an offset. After Post’s attorney protested,\nHartford relented. This, of course, may have been a good-faith\n\n                                25\n\fmistake on Hartford’s part, but it is a plan administrator’s\nresponsibility to know the contents of the plan. Our dissenting\ncolleague believes that the Plan itself was confusing enough that\nHartford’s mistake was understandable. But Hartford is a large,\nsophisticated insurance company, and the Plan is its own design.\nThus, we are less willing to draw such benign inferences\n(particularly at the summary judgment stage, where we draw all\nreasonable inferences in Post’s favor) from Hartford’s supposed\nconfusion about the contents of its own contract.\n\n       Second, Hartford terminated Post’s benefits in part\nbecause she allegedly refused to undergo a functional capacity\nevaluation. The record suggests, however, that Post had not\nrefused an evaluation and that Hartford was quick to conclude\nthat she had despite never making a written request. During the\nappeals process, however, Hartford relented and agreed to\nreconsider Post’s appeal if she would agree to undergo an\nevaluation. Of concern is that Hartford did not allow Post to see\nDr. Lynch’s report before making its final decision to terminate.\nThus she had no opportunity to allow her treating physicians to\ncomment on it.\n\n       Third, Hartford’s decision to terminate benefits relied\nheavily on Dr. Malievskaia’s report, which was not based on a\nphysical examination. While the District Court correctly noted\nthat ERISA does not require that plan administrators give the\nopinions of treating physicians special weight, Black & Decker\nDisability Plan v. Nord, 538 U.S. 822, 823–24 (2003), courts\n\n                               26\n\fmust still consider the circumstances that surround an\nadministrator ordering a paper review. On one hand, nothing in\nthe record specifically suggests that Hartford ordered this review\nin bad faith, as, we assume, periodic reviews are typical in the\nindustry. On the other hand, we note that at the time of the\nreview the overwhelming weight of evidence in Post’s record\nargued in her favor.7\n\n       Fourth, Hartford surveilled Post. As the District Court\nnoted, while surveillance is an aggressive tactic, nothing\nprohibits its use. Post argues that the bothersome point is that\nHartford continued to investigate her claim despite its\nsurveillance revealing that she did not leave her home. We\nagree. The fact that Post did not leave her home while she was\nunder surveillance is perfectly consistent with, and corroborative\nof, her claim for disability. Yet Hartford was undeterred in\n\n\n\n   7\n      Our dissenting colleague views the record differently on\nthis point as well. At the time of the paper review, all of Post’s\ntreating physicians’ reports save one argued in her favor. It is\ntrue that Dr. Fiore in 1994 (before she filed for, and was\ngranted, disability benefits the first time) labeled her “not\ndisabled” after a single examination, but every other\ndoctor—and we include Dr. Harris in this group, see supra note\n1—indicated a high level of disability through Hartford’s 2002\ndenial of benefits. Given the regular reports indicating disability\nfrom her treating physicians, we believe that the record was far\nin Post’s favor at the time of Hartford’s paper review.\n\n                                27\n\fcontinuing to pursue evidence that Post was not disabled.\nIndeed, the very fact that its employees characterized the results\nof the surveillance as “unsuccessful” suggests that its motive\nwas to find evidence to deny Post’s claim.\n\n         In addition to these incidents, Post cites Hartford’s\nrequest for her tax returns as evidence of bad faith. As the\nDistrict Court pointed out, the Plan did allow Hartford to reduce\nPost’s benefits by the amount of any income she was receiving\nfrom working; thus Hartford’s request for proof that she was\nreceiving none was not beyond the pale. Nonetheless,\nHartford’s pursuit of Post’s tax returns in the face of ambiguous\nPlan language is accurately characterized as an aggressive\ntactic.8\n\n\n  8\n     In this context we note that on February 29, 2000, Hartford\ndemanded that Post submit her 1999 tax return within 30 days.\nAs any taxpayer knows, that return was not due to the IRS until\nApril 15, 2000. Perhaps this was an oversight on Hartford’s\npart, but it reinforces the impression that Hartford was on the\noffense in its demands for information.\n        We further note that we cannot agree with our dissenting\ncolleague that the Plan clearly allowed demanding tax returns on\npenalty of forfeiture. In the Plan, Hartford specifically reserved\nitself “the right to require, as part of Proof of Loss: (1) your\n[Post’s] signed statement identifying all Other Income Benefits,\nand (2) [s]atisfactory proof to the Hartford that you and your\nDependents have duly applied for all Other Income Benefits\nwhich are available.” Tax returns do not easily fit into either\n\n                               28\n\f        Post also cites Hartford’s denial of benefits despite a\nfavorable Social Security decision as evidence of bad faith. Our\nCourt has not passed on the relevance of Social Security\ndecisions in determining the appropriate standard of review, but\nother courts of appeals and some district courts have held that a\ndisagreement with the Social Security Administration is a\nrelevant—though not dispositive—factor. See Glenn v. MetLife,\nInc., 461 F.3d 660, 669 (6th Cir. 2006) (“[A]n ERISA plan\nadministrator’s failure to address the Social Security\nAdministration’s finding that the claimant was ‘totally disabled’\nis yet another factor that can render the denial of further long-\nterm disability benefits arbitrary and capricious.”); Lopes v.\nMetro. Life Ins. Co., 332 F.3d 1, 6 n.9 (1st Cir. 2003); Whatley\nv. CNA Ins. Co., 189 F.3d 1310, 1314 n.8 (11th Cir. 1999) (per\ncuriam); Edgerton v. CNA Ins. Co., 215 F. Supp. 2d 541, 549\n(E.D. Pa. 2002); Dorsey v. Provident Life & Accident Ins. Co.,\n167 F. Supp. 2d 846, 856 n.11 (E.D. Pa. 2001). We agree that\na disagreement is relevant though not dispositive, particularly\n(as here) when the administrator rejects the very diagnoses on\n\n\n\n\ncategory. As this was Hartford’s contract, it had every\nopportunity expressly to provide for the right to demand tax\nreturns if it wished to do so. But it did not require this\nexpressly. Thus, we believe that threatening forfeiture for\nrefusing to provide information to which the Plan did not give\nit a right was, at the least, aggressive.\n\n                               29\n\fwhich the Social Security benefits determination is based.9\n\n       In sum, we agree with the District Court that, on this\nrecord, each irregularity here may appear minor. But given their\nnumber and regularity, the standard of review should be further\nheightened. As in Kosiba, we recognize that Hartford may offer\nplausible explanations for those irregularities, but in setting the\nstandard of review the issue is merely whether the process raises\nquestions. See 384 F.3d at 68. In this case, the sheer number of\nirregularities coupled with Hartford’s aggressive posture raise\nconcerns, and so the standard of review must be heightened.\nThis procedural posture suggests that we move toward the high\nend of the sliding scale, much as we did in Pinto. 214 F.3d at\n394.\n\n\n     9\n       Hartford argues that its conclusion is not necessarily\ninconsistent with the Social Security Administration’s\ndetermination, as Post’s intractable cervical pain, chronic pain\nsyndrome, and fibromyalgia might have healed between 1998\n(when the Social Security Administration awarded her benefits)\nand 2002 (when Hartford denied them). Perhaps, but neither Dr.\nMalievskaia nor Dr. Lynch directly addressed the Social\nSecurity decision, nor did either of them posit that Post had\nthese disorders but recovered from them. Rather, both seemed\nto conclude that Post was never totally disabled. J.A. 296 (Dr.\nLynch’s conclusions) & 343–44 (Dr. Malievskaia’s\nconclusions). As their conclusions appear to be in tension with\nthose of the Social Security Administration, we believe the\ndisagreement is relevant.\n\n                                30\n\f       C.     Conclusion\n\n        Both structural and procedural factors favor a more\nsearching standard of review than was used here. In light of\nwhat we believe the standard of review should be, the District\nCourt erred by applying only slightly heightened review.\nMoving toward the high end of the sliding scale, the District\nCourt must searchingly review both the merits and the process\nto determine if Hartford’s decision was not the product of\nreasoned, disinterested discretion. No doubt the evidence on the\nmerits appears close. But a factfinder reviewing the merits\ncould yet determine that the weight of the medical evidence\nsupports Post and that it, coupled with the evidence of bias,\nyields the conclusion that Hartford did not properly exercise its\ndiscretion.\n\nIV.    Other Issues\n\n       A.     Closure of the Record\n\n       Generally, only evidence in the administrative record is\nadmissible for the purpose of determining whether the plan\nadministrator’s decision was arbitrary and capricious. Kosiba,\n384 F.3d at 67 n.5; Mitchell v. Eastman Kodak Co., 113 F.3d\n433, 440 (3d Cir. 1997); Abnathya v. Hoffman-La Roche, Inc.,\n2 F.3d 40, 48 n.8 (3d Cir. 1993).\n\n       In the wake of Pinto, however, we have modified that\n\n                               31\n\fholding to allow the consideration of extrinsic evidence when\ndeciding how much to heighten our review. Kosiba, 384 F.3d\nat 67 n.5. That evidence must show “potential biases and\nconflicts.” Id. In particular, we have noted that considering\nevidence of a plan’s funding mechanism would be appropriate.\nId. Here, however, Post’s supplemental exhibits are all medical\nreports. The first five are reports from doctors that Post\nconsulted between 1993 (just after the accident) and 1996. See\nAppellant’s Br. 6–9. The last two are summaries of Post’s\ncondition prepared by her current doctors at the request of\ncounsel in May 2005 (nearly two years after Hartford issued its\nfinal denial of benefits). Id. at 18–19, 28. Post has provided no\nexplanation why the reports produced between 1993 and 1996\nwere not sent to Hartford for its consideration. Similarly, if she\nwanted Hartford to consider her treating physicians’ responses\nto Dr. Lynch’s report or their summaries of her medical\ncondition, she should have submitted them (and thus made them\npart of the administrative record) soon after she received\nHartford’s denial of benefits, but she did not. Because all of\nthese documents are medical reports, they are not relevant to the\nissue of bias; rather, they are only relevant to whether Hartford\nreached the right decision. Under Mitchell, they cannot be\nconsidered for that purpose because they were not submitted to\nHartford and made part of the record. 113 F.3d at 440. Thus,\nthe District Court acted properly in not considering them.\n\n\n\n\n                               32\n\f       B.     The Section 1132(a)(2) Claim\n\n       The doctrine of res judicata “protect[s] litigants from the\nburden of relitigating an identical issue with the same party or\nhis privy and . . . promot[es] judicial economy by preventing\nneedless litigation.” Parklane Hoisery Co. v. Shore, 439 U.S.\n322, 327 (1979). To apply, the following three prongs must be\nmet: “(1) a final judgment on the merits in a prior suit involving\n(2) the same parties or their privies and (3) a subsequent suit\nbased on the same cause of action.” Lubrizol Corp. v. Exxon\nCorp., 929 F.2d 960, 963 (3d Cir. 2001). Here, the parties agree\nthat prongs two and three are met; their dispute is over whether\nthe Court rendered a final judgment on the merits in their\nprevious suit.\n\n       In that suit, the District Court dismissed a cause of action\nalleging violation of 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(2) for failure to state\na claim. See Post v. Hartford Life & Accident Ins. Co., No.\nCIV.A. 02-1917, 2002 WL 31741470, at *2 (E.D. Pa. Dec. 6,\n2002). Dismissal for failure to state a claim is a final judgment\non the merits for res judicata purposes. Federated Dep’t Stores\nv. Moitie, 452 U.S. 394, 399 n.3 (1981). Moreover, res judicata\nbars not only claims that were brought in the previous action,\nbut also claims that could have been brought. CoreStates Bank,\nN.A. v. Huls America, Inc., 176 F.3d 187, 194 (3d Cir. 1999).\nThus, for Post to maintain a § 1132(a)(2) claim, she would have\nto explain to the Court why it could not have been brought in\n2002. She has made no attempt to do so.\n\n                                33\n\f       As Hartford notes, Post’s claim has the additional\nproblem that it, too, fails properly to allege a violation of\n§ 1132(a)(2). Post seeks to recover individually for Hartford’s\nalleged breach of fiduciary duty. Under § 1132(a)(2) this is\nimpossible, for that section allows beneficiaries to recover assets\non behalf of the plan only. Mass. Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Russell,\n473 U.S. 134, 140 (1985). In other words, § 1132(a)(2) does not\nauthorize suits for the recovery of individual benefits. Hozier v.\nMidwest Fasteners, Inc., 908 F.2d 1155, 1162 n.7 (3d Cir. 1990)\n(“Because plaintiffs here seek to recover benefits allegedly\nowed to them in their individual capacities, their action is\nplainly not authorized by either § 409 or § 502(a)(2).”).10\n\nV.        Conclusion\n\n       We conclude that the District Court should have applied\na more searching review to this case because of the non-trivial\nevidence of structural and procedural bias. Because that was not\nthe standard applied here, we vacate the District Court’s grant\nof summary judgment in Hartford’s favor on the § 1132(a)(1)(B)\nclaim and remand for further proceedings.\n\n\n\n     10\n      While we have held that individuals can recover in their\nown capacity for breaches of fiduciary duties under\n§ 1132(a)(3), see Bixler v. Cent. Pa. Teamsters Health &\nWelfare Fund, 12 F.3d 1292, 1298 (3d Cir. 1993), Post brought\nher claims only under § 1132(a)(1)(B) and (a)(2).\n\n                                34\n\f       We affirm, however, its grant of summary judgment on\nthe § 1132(a)(2) claim because principles of res judicata bar that\nclaim.\n\n\n\n\n                               35\n\fPOST v. HARTFORD INSURANCE COMPANY\n\nNo. 05-4927\n\n\n\n\nSTAPLETON, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\n\n\n\n       I agree with the Court that Post’s claim under ERISA §\n502(a)(2) is barred by principles of res judicata and that in\ndetermining whether an administrator’s denial of benefits is\narbitrary or capricious—as contrasted with deciding the\nappropriate standard of review—a district court is limited to\nconsideration of the evidence that was before the administrator.\nI therefore join Section IV of the Court’s opinion. I disagree,\nhowever, with the Court’s analysis of Post’s claim under ERISA\n§ 502(a)(1)(B), and with the Court’s decision to reverse and\nremand the summary judgment on that claim. I would affirm the\njudgment of the District Court.\n\n\n\n\n                     I. Merits Evidence\n\n\n\n\n                              36\n\f        The benefits decision we are asked to review was\ncommunicated to Post in a letter dated October 2, 2003. That\nletter explains at length the administrator’s reasons for declining\nto continue disability benefits. It describes and principally relies\nupon an investigation conducted by Dr. Christopher G. Lynch,\nM.D. Dr. Lynch was engaged by Hartford in order to secure\nindependent evaluation of Post’s claim to “total disability”\nbenefits. 11 In the course of his investigation, Dr. Lynch\nphysically examined Post and reviewed all of the medical\nrecords accumulated over the preceding ten years.\n\n\n\n\n       The administrator’s letter accurately reflects Dr. Lynch’s\nreport and, like that report, is reasoned, thorough and makes a\npersuasive case for the conclusion that Post, while suffering\nfrom chronic pain syndrome, is not totally disabled. It\n\n\n\n    11\n      Under the Plan, to be considered “totally disabled” after\nDecember 6, 1997, Post would have to be “prevented by\nDisability from doing any occupation or work for which [she is]\nor could become qualified by: (1) training; (2) education; or (3)\nexperience.” JA 77. When Post was originally granted benefits,\nthe applicable definition of “totally disabled” was that she was\n“prevented by Disability from doing all the material and\nsubstantial duties of [her] own occupation.” Under the terms of\nthe Plan, the definition changed once Post had been disabled for\n24 months plus 180 days. JA 76-77, 83.\n\n                                37\n\fconcludes with the following quotations from Dr. Lynch’s\nreport:\n\n\n\n\n        Dr. Lynch found that “multiple physical exams\n        have shown nothing more than tender muscles at\n        times and occasional trigger points.” According\n        to Dr. Lynch: “An equal number of examinations\n        have found no tender muscles or trigger points.\n        Thus, there can be no consistent physical\n        disability over this period of time.”\n\n\n\n\n        With respect to the need to assign physical\n        restrictions and limitations, Dr. Lynch provided\n        these remarks: “Given the multiple normal\n        examinations, including my own of today,12 I feel\n\n\n   12\n    Dr. Lynch’s report described his observations during his\nexamination of Post as follows:\n\n        On examination today, she is alert, cooperative\n        and in no distress. Affect is a bit flat. She\n        appeared to be in no distress although she stated\n        she had total body pain.\n\n\n                               38\n\f      she could perform sedentary to light work as\n      usually defined – light work, lifting up to 20\n      pounds maximum with frequent lifting or carrying\n      of objects weighing up to 10 pounds. She should\n      have the ability to change posture at fairly\n\n\n      Examination of the upper extremities reveals no\n      deformities. There is no focal motor, reflex or\n      sensory loss. She has normal pain free range of\n      motion in all upper extremity joints including the\n      shoulders. There was no tenderness over the\n      forearm or upper arm musculature.\n\n      Examination of the head, neck and back reveals\n      no deformities. Range of motion in the cervical\n      spine was 15-20 degrees of left and right lateral\n      rotation with normal flexion and extension.\n      Range of motion in the low back was 60+ degrees\n      of flexion with 5-10 degrees of extension.\n      Palpation over the cervical and thoracic regions\n      reveals no definite tenderness and no trigger\n      points were palpated.        Palpation over the\n      lumbosacral spine reveals no tenderness. She was\n      somewhat tender over the greater trochanters\n      bilaterally. Motor, reflex and sensory exams were\n      normal in the lower extremities. She has normal\n      pain free range of motion in all lower extremity\n      joints. Gait is normal.\n\nJA 292-93.\n\n                             39\n\f       frequent intervals.”\n\n\n\n\n       Citing the restrictions and limitations identified by\n       Dr. Lynch, Ms. Post would not be prevented by\n       disability from doing any occupation or work for\n       which she is qualified by training, education or\n       experience.\n\n\n\n\nJA 289-90 (footnote added).\n\n\n\n\n       While Post stresses that several treating physicians had\nexpressed the opinion that she was unable to work and that the\nSocial Security Administration found her disabled in 1998, she\ndoes not point to any segment of her medical records that\ncontradicts Dr. Lynch’s characterizations of those records in\nthese quotations. Nor can Post dispute the fact that Dr. Lynch\nis the only physician having no continuing relationship with\nHartford or Post who physically examined her and studied all of\nher medical records.\n\n\n\n\n                                40\n\f              II. Standard of Review Evidence\n\n                    A. Structural Factors\n\n\n\n\n       Under the teachings of Pinto, it is clear that Hartford has\na material conflict of interest. It serves as both payor and\ndecision maker and there are no other factors that ameliorate the\nincentive thus created to deny benefits. This calls for a\n“heightening” of the “arbitrary or capricious” standard of review\nwhich is applicable in all cases where an ERISA plan vests\ndiscretion in the administrator.\n\n\n\n\n       [A] heightened standard of review would appear\n       to be appropriate when a plan funder like an\n       insurance company “incurs a direct expense,” the\n       consequences to it are direct and contemporary,\n       and, while it has incentives to maintain good\n       business relationships, it lacks the incentive to\n       “avoid the loss of morale and higher wage\n       demands that result [for an employer] from a\n       denial of benefits.”\n\n\n\n\n                               41\n\f                               ***\n\n\n\n\n               For all the foregoing reasons, we believe\n       that a higher standard of review is required when\n       reviewing benefits denials of insurance companies\n       paying ERISA benefits out of their own funds.\n\n\n\n\nPinto, 214 F.3d at 389, 390; see also Kosiba v. Merck & Co.,\n384 F.3d 58, 65-66 (3d Cir. 2004).\n\n\n\n\n                    B. Procedural Factors\n\n\n\n\n       It is equally clear from Pinto that the “heightened”\nreview arising from this structural conflict of interest would be\n“ratcheted upward” if there were anomalies in the procedure by\nwhich the administrator’s decision was reached that give the\nCourt reason to doubt its fiduciary neutrality. Pinto, 214 F.3d\nat 394; Kosiba, 384 F.3d at 66. I believe a fair reading of the\nrecord in this case fails to suggest anything other than neutrality,\nhowever. To the contrary, the record affirmatively suggests that\nHartford’s search for the answer to the “total disability” issue\n\n                                42\n\fwas conducted in a fair, impartial and cooperative manner.\nEach of the anomalies that trouble the Court appear troubling\nonly if one engages in speculation having no record support.\n\n\n\n\n          It is true, as the Court notes, that Hartford requested a\ncopy of Post’s social security award so that it could offset her\nsocial security benefits against her disability benefits. This\nmistake was understandable, however, and promptly corrected\nwhen the error was called to Hartford’s attention. The ERISA\nplan of Post’s former employer, which Hartford administers,\nappears to be a standard form, but with an attached state-specific\nsection titled “Statutory Provisions,” which, the Plan states, “are\nincluded to bring your booklet-certificate into conformity with\n. . . state law.” JA 78. If one reads Post’s benefits Plan without\npaying careful attention to the statutory provisions, the Plan\nwould appear to allow Hartford to use Post’s Social Security\nbenefits to offset her disability benefits. In the portion of the\nPlan titled “Calculation of Monthly Benefit,” part of step 2 of\nthe calculation is to “subtract all Other Income Benefits,\nincluding those for which you could collect but did not apply.”\nJA 99. In the definitions section of the Plan, “Other Income\nBenefits” is defined by a list, of which item (4) of the first\nparagraph is “[t]he amount of disability or retirement benefits\nunder the United States Social Security Act to which you may be\nentitled because of disability retirement.” JA 86. The “statutory\nprovisions” of the Plan – reflecting New Jersey law – state,\nhowever, that “[i]tems (3) and (4) of the first paragraph of the\ndefinition of Other Income Benefits are deleted.” JA 78. After\nHartford requested the award letter, Post’s counsel responded\n\n                                43\n\fwith a letter calling Hartford’s attention to the error:\n\n\n\n\n               As promised, here is the Notice of Award,\n       and the language in the policy deleting Social\n       Security Benefits from the definition of “Other\n       Income Benefits,” as well as the deleted language\n       itself. As you can see, pursuant to New Jersey\n       law, the situs of this contract, Hartford has no\n       right to take a credit or deduction for or from its\n       obligation due to Social Security’s payments.\n\n\n\n\nJA 216. An internal communication at Hartford reflects that\nHartford then researched the issue, agreed with Post’s counsel’s\nassessment, and determined to “change case management”\naccordingly “so that [it could] correctly administer claims under\nthis Policy.” JA 231.\n\n\n\n\n       It is also true, as the Court notes, that Hartford at one\npoint stated that benefits were being terminated in part because\nPost had declined to undergo a functional capacity evaluation\n(“FCE”). While Post had not at that point declined to take an\nFCE, Hartford’s error clearly cannot be attributed to a lack of\nneutrality on its part. On June 18, 2001, Hartford was advised\nin writing by Empire Medical Management (“EMM”), an\nindependent medical firm that had attempted to arrange an FCE\n\n                                44\n\fthrough Post’s counsel, that she had refused such an\nexamination. In short, Hartford was not a party to the\nmiscommunication that led to this misunderstanding and\nultimately revised its position. Moreover, when one of Post’s\nphysicians later expressed concern about whether an FCE would\naggravate her symptoms, Hartford accommodated those\nconcerns by agreeing to settle for the less strenuous independent\nmedical evaluation (“IME”) that was conducted by Dr. Lynch.\n\n\n\n\n       The Court cites as its second anomaly Hartford’s failure\nto afford Post an opportunity to comment on Dr. Lynch’s report\nbefore sending its October 3, 2003, letter. While the Court\ncorrectly notes that no explanation for this appears in the record,\nthat is not surprising in light of the fact that Post did not\nmaintain before the District Court or before us that this was a\nmatter of concern for her. Post was given a full opportunity to\ndevelop a record before the administrator, and neither the\nsection of the Plan addressing her appeal rights nor\nERISA § 503(2) (addressing internal appeal rights) provides a\nright to comment on the report of an independent medical\nconsultant under the circumstances of this case.\n\n\n\n\n       Third, the majority finds evidence of bad faith in the fact\nthat Hartford’s initial decision to terminate Post’s benefits\n“relied heavily on Dr. Malievskaia’s report,” because (1) Dr.\nMalievskaia’s report was not based on a physical examination,\nand (2) “the overwhelming weight of evidence in Post’s record\n\n                                45\n\fargued in her favor.” Dr. Malievskaia was an Associate Medical\nDirector of Medical Advisory Group (“MAG”), a medical\nconsulting firm that Hartford engaged in the summer of 2001\nfollowing EMM’s June 18, 2001, letter advising of Post’s\nrefusal to submit to an FCE, to “review [Post’s] medical records\nand speak to [Post’s] primary care physician in order to identify\n[her] functional capabilities and address the claimant’s ability to\nperform [a] sedentary to light occupation.” JA 339. Dr.\nMalievskaia did interview two treating physicians and submitted\nher report on September 20, 2001. That report was not relied\nupon in the October 3, 2003, decision letter that we are\nreviewing. It was, however, relied upon in Hartford’s original\ndecision letter of January 4, 2002, the same letter that relied in\npart on what Hartford then understood to be Post’s refusal to be\nexamined. This context, in my view, precludes drawing an\ninference against Hartford from its reliance on Dr.\nMalievskaia’s report. Given that Hartford believed that Post had\nrefused to be examined, and that that fact alone was a sufficient\nreason to terminate her benefits, it makes little sense to penalize\nHartford for taking additional steps to ascertain Post’s medical\ncondition. Moreover, as that report and Hartford’s January 4th\nletter evidence, the overwhelming weight of evidence in Post’s\nrecord did not argue in her favor.13\n\n\n    13\n      While the evidence in Post’s record indicated that she\nsuffered from chronic pain, to be eligible for benefits at that\npoint, Post had to be “prevented by Disability from doing any\noccupation or work for which [she is] or could become qualified\nby: (1) training; (2) education; or (3) experience.” JA 77\n(emphasis added). In 1994, ten months after her initial injury,\n\n                                46\n\fDr. Michael Fiore noted that Post had no lacerations, bruises,\nswelling or broken bones, diagnosed her with a “cervical\nsprain/strain,” and concluded that she was “not disabled” and\n“may participate in full activity as tolerated.” JA 196-98. In\n1996, Dr. Joel Harris examined Post and concluded that\nalthough she had severe pain in her head and neck area, she was\ncapable of doing sedentary work. JA 265. The Court notes that\nsedentary work was the “least intensive option available,” but\nnothing prevented Dr. Harris from indicating, as Dr. Britton did\non the same form, JA256, that Post was incapable of doing\nsedentary work. New Jersey’s medical examiner found that Post\n“could perform medium exertional work with limited reaching.”\nJA 46.\n        Although several of Post’s doctors tested her for “trigger\npoints” and diagnosed her with fibromyalgia, their ultimate\ndiagnoses were based on self-reported symptoms, and none of\nthe doctors ever found the requisite eleven of eighteen trigger\npoints needed to support such a diagnosis. There are several\nreferences in Post’s medical records to “trigger points,” all of\nwhich indicate that she had fewer than eleven. JA 262 (Dr.\nMulford in March 1995, finding “some trigger points in the\nsternocleidomastoid and scalenes”); JA 259 (Dr. Mulford in\nNovember 1995, finding “several trigger points in the upper\ncervical spine at the occiput and over the cervical facets”); JA\n258 (Dr. Mulford in 1996, finding “no palpable muscle spasm\nor trigger points at this time”); JA 318-19 (Dr. Kaufman in May\n2000, finding “trigger points on the right side . . . [and] Another\ntrigger point in the infraspinatous region on the left side,” but\nnone in several other places); JA 317 (Dr. Kaufman in October\n\n                                47\n\f       Fourth, the Court holds that a Hartford employee’s use of\nthe term “unsuccessful” in an internal e-mail to describe\n\n\n2000 finding two trigger points); JA 293-95.0 The “trigger\npoint” test is recognized in the case law and the medical\nliterature as a prerequisite to a diagnosis of fibromyalgia. See\nSarchet v. Carter, 78 F.3d 305, 306-07 (7th Cir. 1996)\n(discussing the trigger point test); Chronister v. Baptist Health,\n442 F.3d 648, 656 (8th Cir. 2006) (same, citing Sarchet); Stup\nv. UNUM Life Ins. Co. of Am., 390 F.3d 301, 303 (4th Cir. 2004)\n(same); Hawkins v. First Union Corporation Long-Term\nDisability, 326 F.3d 914, 919 (7th Cir. 2003) (same); Stedman’s\nConcise Medical Dictionary for the Health Profession 361 (4th\ned. 2001) (defining fibromyalgia as “a condition of chronic\ndiffuse widespread aching and stiffness affecting muscles and\nsoft tissues; diagnosis requires 11 of 18 specific tender\npoints . . . .”). Admittedly, Post’s file contained the opinions of\nseveral treating physicians to the effect that she was completely\ndisabled, but it is not a fair assessment of the record to say that\nthe evidence in her favor was sufficiently overwhelming as to\nraise a legitimate inference of bad faith when Hartford’s\nadministrator disagreed with those conclusions. This is not,\ntherefore, a situation like Kosiba, where the claimant’s\n“physician’s reports uniformly supported her contentions” of\ndisability, and there was no comparable evidence supporting the\ninsurer’s contrary view at the time it ordered an examination.”\n384 F.3d at 67.\n\n\n                                48\n\fHartford’s surveillance of Post counsels heightened review. The\nonly evidence in the record on this point is one line of an\ninternal e-mail stating “Surveillance was unsuccessful as the\nclaimant was not observed leaving her home.” JA227. In the\nCourt’s view, the use of the word “unsuccessful” suggests that\nHartford’s “motive was to find evidence to deny Post’s claim.”\nI do not agree.\n\n\n\n\n        As the Court recognizes, surveillance by an insurance\ncompany is not per se suspicious. See, e.g., Delta Family-Care\nDisability & Survivorship Plan v. Marshall, 258 F.3d 834, 841\n(8th Cir. 2001) (“[T]here is nothing procedurally improper about\nthe use of surveillance.”); Tsoulas v. Liberty Life Assurance Co.\nof Boston, 454 F.3d 69, 76-77 (1st Cir. 2006) (district court\nproperly held that surveillance was for the purpose of objective\ndocumentation of disability rather than to deny benefits).\nHartford’s employee’s description of the surveillance as\n“unsuccessful” may support an inference of bias only if one\nsupposes that Post’s leaving her home could only produce\nevidence that would undermine her claim. If Post left her home\nto jog or play sports, that would certainly undermine her claim\nto disability benefits. On the other hand, if she used a\nwheelchair to move from her door to a waiting wheelchair\ntransport vehicle, or hobbled gingerly on crutches, that would\nsupport her claim to disability benefits. The only reasonable\ninference—if any inference may be drawn with confidence—is\nthat the use of the word “unsuccessful” meant that Hartford’s\nsurveilleur was unable to observe Post at all due to the fact that\nshe did not leave her home, and thus could neither confirm nor\n\n                               49\n\fdeny her disability.\n\n\n\n\n        Unlike the Court, I am unwilling to characterize\nHartford’s request for tax returns as an “aggressive tactic.” The\nPlan entitles Hartford to reduce Post’s benefits by the amount of\nincome she received from working. Contrary to the majority’s\nsuggestion, there is nothing “ambiguous” about the Plan in that\nrespect. In Hartford’s May 12 and June 19, 2000, letters to Post\nand her attorneys requesting tax returns, Hartford quoted the\nlanguage of the policy pertaining to the calculation of Post’s\nbenefits, specifically emphasizing the text that directed Hartford\nto subtract “all other income from any employer or for any\nwork.” JA 214, 219. At the time Hartford requested Post’s\nreturns, Post was collecting “total disability” benefits under the\ntheory that she was prevented from doing any work by a\ndisabling condition. In that light, it hardly seems unreasonable\nor suggestive of bad faith for Hartford to request tax returns, as\nPost’s report to the government of her employment status during\nher period of alleged total disability would be probative\nevidence of whether Post was in fact “prevented by Disability\nfrom doing any occupation or work for which [she is] or could\nbecome qualified.”\n\n\n\n\n       Finally, the Court suggests that a disagreement between\nHartford’s October 3, 2003, decision and the August 11, 1998,\ndecision of the Social Security Administration “is relevant\nthough not dispositive” of whether the former was arbitrary and\n\n                               50\n\fcapricious. Op. at 29. Suffice it to say, the administrative law\njudge in 1998 did not have the benefit of the record before\nHartford in 2003, and no review of Post’s continued eligibility\nfor social security benefits has been undertaken since 1998. See\nPari-Fasano v. ITT Hartford Life & Acc. Ins. Co., 230 F.3d 415,\n420 (1st Cir. 2000). In Pinto and other cases in which courts\nhave applied heightened scrutiny to an administrator’s denial of\nbenefits in the face of a social security award, they have done so\nnot because of the mere fact of conflict with the SSA’s\ndetermination, but because there is something suspicious about\nthe manner in which the SSA decision is disregarded or\ndisagreed with. In Pinto, for example, we were concerned with\nthe fact that the administrator showed inexplicably greater\ndeference to the SSA’s determination that the claimant was not\ndisabled than to the SSA’s subsequent reversal of its initial\ndetermination. Pinto, 214 F.3d 393-94. Similarly, in Harden v.\nAm. Express Fin. Corp., 384 F.3d 498, 500 (8th Cir. 2004), the\ncourt applied greater scrutiny where the insurance company led\nthe claimant to believe that it was considering his SSA records\nwhen it in fact was not. In other instances, where a plan\nrequires the beneficiary to apply for Social Security benefits and\ntakes an offset if the Social Security claim succeeds—which\nHartford does not do here because of New Jersey state\nlaw—courts have applied heightened scrutiny to ensure that the\nadministrator does not make self-servingly selective use of the\nSSA’s determinations by giving weight only to those\ndeterminations that go against the claimant. See Calvert v.\nFirstar Fin., Inc., 409 F.3d 286, 294-95 (6th Cir. 2005) (finding\nthat where the plan at issue had such a requirement, an\nadministrator’s disagreement with the SSA’s determination\n“counsel[ed] a certain scepticism” that the court should consider\n\n                               51\n\fas a factor in determining whether the administrator’s decision\nwas arbitrary and capricious); Wilkerson v. Reliance Std. Life\nIns. Co., No. 99-4799, 2001 WL 484126 at *1 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 6,\n2001) (“[D]efendant is in the seemingly anomalous position of\nrequiring plaintiff to refund some of the disability benefits\nreceived from the defendant because offset by Social Security\ndisability benefits, and then failing to give any consideration to\nthe continuation of Social Security benefits as evidence of\ncontinued total disability.”)\n\n\n\n\n       I disagree with the Court’s suggestion that any of these\n“anomalies,” either alone or in combination, should alter our\nstandard of review in this case.\n\n\n\n\n              C. Resulting Standard of Review\n\n\n\n\n        I thus view this as a case in which the decision maker had\na material, inherent conflict of interest, but in which there is no\nsignificant evidence regarding its processing of the claim to\nbenefits which suggests anything other than an impartial\nexercise of fiduciary discretion. It is clear from Pinto that such\na situation calls for a “heightened” application of the arbitrary\nand capricious standard of review.\n\n\n\n                                52\n\f         In Pinto, we adopted a “sliding scale” approach that\n“allows each case to be examined on its facts.” It teaches that\ndistrict courts “should consider the nature and degree of\napparent conflicts with a view to shaping their arbitrary and\ncapricious review of benefit determinations of discretionary\ndecisionmakers.” Pinto, 214 F.3d at 393. As Pinto expressly\nacknowledged, however, “the routine legal meaning of an\narbitrary and capricious decision is . . . a decision ‘without\nreason, unsupported by substantial evidence or erroneous as a\nmatter of law,’” and “[o]nce the conflict becomes a ‘factor’ . .\n. it is not clear how the process required by the typical arbitrary\nand capricious review changes.” Id. at 392. The standard of\nreview we ultimately adopted in Pinto was of necessity an\nimprecise one: the review is to be “more penetrating the greater\nthe suspicion of partiality, less penetrating the smaller the\nsuspicion is.” Id. at 392-93 (quoting from Wildbur v. ARCO\nChem. Co., 974 F.2d 631 (5th Cir. 1992)). District courts, we\ninstructed, must “approximately calibrat[e] the intensity of\n[their] review to the intensity of the conflict.” Id. at 393.\n\n\n\n\n        It must be kept in mind, however, that the arbitrary and\ncapricious standard, even when heightened, remains a\ndeferential one. See Stratton v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Co.,\n363 F.3d 250, 256 (3d Cir. 2004); Gritzer v. CBS, Inc., 275 F.3d\n291, 295 & n.3 (3d Cir. 2002). The sliding scale, throughout its\nentire range, measures the deference to be afforded the decision\nof an administrator upon whom the plan has conferred discretion\nregarding benefits. Even where the conflict and/or procedural\nirregularities are most serious, this means only that the Court\n\n                                53\n\fwill “require that the record contain substantial evidence\nbordering on a preponderance to uphold [the administrator’s]\ndecision.” Woo v. Deluxe Corp., 144 F.3d 1157, 1162 (8th Cir.\n1998). Stated conversely, if the evidence in the administrative\nrecord renders it more likely than not that the administrator’s\ndecision is correct, it necessarily follows that the decision must\nstand wherever on the arbitrary and capricious sliding scale the\ncase may fall. In short, if the decision withstands de novo\nreview, it matters not how little deference is accorded. See\nWilliams v. BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc., 373 F.3d 1132,\n1139 (11th Cir. 2004) (“Because no grounds exist to disturb\nKemper’s determination under the de novo review standard, we\nneed not review it under the more deferential (‘mere’ or\n‘heightened’ arbitrary and capricious) standard.”).\n\n\n\n\n       As the Court recognizes, while Hartford’s structural\nconflict calls for “heightened” review, in the absence of\nevidence of procedural bias it does not place this case at the\nupper end of the scale. Under our case law, as the Court\nexplains, “[s]tructural conflicts of interest warrant more\nsearching review, but in the absence of evidence that bias\ninfected the particular decision at issue, we defer to an\nadministrator’s reasonable and carefully considered\nconclusions.” Op. at 21. I agree with this reading of our\njurisprudence, and because I believe no court reviewing the\nrecord before Hartford and affording its decision this kind of\ndeference, or indeed deference of any significant degree, could\nappropriately overturn that decision, I would affirm the\nsummary judgment in its favor.\n\n                               54\n\f                        III. Disposition\n\n\n\n\n        Post’s case presented difficult issues for an administrator\nto resolve. She originally suffered a “whiplash injury,” which\nDr. Fiore described as a “cervical [neck] sprain/strain.” JA 196-\n98. She had no bruises, lacerations, or broken bones, and\nmagnetic resonance imagery revealed no tears, nerve damage, or\nslipped or herniated discs. Post nevertheless complained, over\nthe next decade, of total body pain sufficiently severe to prevent\nher from any employment. Throughout that period, she was\ntreated by physicians who prescribed medications and other\ntherapy which were expected by them to alleviate this pain, but\nto no avail. Her condition did not improve. Post’s treating\nphysicians did not reach a consensus with regard to the cause of\nher pain. Several suggested psychiatric or psychological\ntherapies be undertaken, but Post declined to pursue that course.\nTwo physicians suggested Post suffered from fibromyalgia, but\ntheir records did not reflect anything approaching the clinical\nevidence necessary to support that diagnosis. While several\ntreating physicians expressed the opinion that Post was unable\nto perform any work, those opinions were based solely upon the\npatient’s report of her symptoms. No clinical or other personal\nobservations of Post were reported in support of those opinions.\n\n\n\n\n       Given this medical history, Hartford reasonably sought\ninformation to confirm or negate Post’s claims to continued\nbenefits. It did so by requesting additional information from\n\n                                55\n\fPost and her treating physicians and by seeking the counsel of\nan independent consultant, Dr. Lynch. As I have earlier noted,\nhis report indicates that his investigation was thorough and\nimpartial. Dr. Lynch addressed the conclusions of Post’s prior\ntreating physicians, contrasted those conclusions with the\nmedical records and with his own findings after a physical\nexamination, and ultimately concluded that although she was\ndisabled by some kind of pain disorder, she was not sufficiently\ndisabled as to meet the plan definition of total disability. Dr.\nLynch’s report is not unassailable, but it is reasoned, consistent\nwith the rest of Post’s medical records, persuasively establishes\nthat there is no objective evidence to support Post’s claim of\ntotal disability, and clearly provides a rational basis for\nconcluding that she is able to perform sedentary work.\n\n\n\n\n       In short, the administrative record before Hartford on\nOctober 3, 2003 provides clear and convincing support for the\nconclusion that Post had not established entitlement to\ncontinuing benefits. That conclusion of the administrator was\nreasonable and carefully considered, and I believe any reviewing\ncourt would be required by our case law to defer to it.\nAccordingly, I would affirm the District Court’s summary\njudgment in favor of Hartford.14\n\n\n  14\n    I would not remand for further proceedings. Our review of\nthe District Court’s summary judgment is plenary and, as the\nCourt recognizes, the merits decision must be made on the basis\nof the administrative record. Given that record, the District\n\n                               56\n\fCourt would have no basis on remand for doing anything other\nthan accepting Hartford’s decision. While it is not material to\nmy decision to affirm, rather than remand, I note that Post, of\ncourse, has no right to a jury review of the administrator’s\ndecision. Turner v. CF&I Steel Corp., 770 F.2d 43 (3d Cir.\n1985).\n\n                              57\n\f",

On the\nother hand, Hartford Insurance Company, the plan administrator\n(who also happens to fund the plan), has hired reviewing\nphysicians who maintain that Post is not disabled. In other\nwords, the central issue in this case—whether Post is\ndisabled—is a “battle of the experts.”\n\n       “Battle-of-the-experts” cases are often easy for a\nreviewing court. If the trial court’s standard of review is\narbitrary and capricious, then Hartford usually wins when it has\nproduced sufficient evidence supporting its position. It cannot\nbe said to have acted arbitrarily, and summary judgment in its\nfavor is appropriate. On the other hand, if the standard is de\nnovo, then summary judgment for either party must be vacated\nbecause there is credible evidence on both sides of the key fact\nquestion.\n\n        But this case, a claim that ERISA benefits were\nimproperly denied, is anything but easy, for the trial court’s\nstandard of review is neither arbitrary and capricious (at least in\nits traditional form) nor de novo. In these cases, district courts\nmust select a standard of review that accords with the extent to\nwhich the plan administrator operates under a conflict of\ninterest. Here we conclude that the District Court did not select\nthe proper standard of review, and so we vacate and remand for\nconsideration under the standard we deem to apply.\n\n       We affirm, however, the Court’s grant of summary\n\n                                3\n\fjudgment on Post’s claim for breach of fiduciary duty because\nit is barred by res judicata.\n\nI.     Facts and Procedural History\n\n       Carol Post was in a serious car accident in November\n1993, just a few days after having major dental surgery. At the\ntime, she was employed as a dentist by Overlook Hospital in\nSummit, New Jersey. She sustained a whiplash injury in the\naccident, but she nonetheless attempted to return to work soon\nafterward. After six days of working, she was forced to stop\nbecause of intractable pain. Overlook, however, offered for her\nto try working as a pharmacist for a while (as she has both\ndentistry and pharmacy degrees), and she accepted. She\nreturned to work in December 1993, but was forced to take\nnearly a day off each week because of pain. After nine months\nof off-and-on working, she resigned due to pain in September\n1994. During this period, she tried numerous physical therapy\ntreatments, none of which significantly improved her condition.\nShe returned to work again in January 1995, but resigned four\nmonths later because of continuing pain. She has not worked\nsince.\n\n       Post’s medical record is voluminous. Between 1993 and\n2003, she visited 14 doctors. Her pain management regimens\nranged from traditional treatments like prescription drug\ncombinations, trigger-point injections, and various forms of\nphysical therapy, to more exotic treatments like acupuncture and\n\n                               4\n\fbiofeedback. She reports that none has given her significant\nrelief. Her primary treating physician is currently Dr. Carolyn\nBritton, a professor of neurology at Columbia University.\nAccording to Dr. Britton, Post suffers from chronic post-\ntraumatic pain syndrome characterized by severe myofacial\npain; regular, debilitating headaches accompanied by sensitivity\nto light, nausea, and vomiting; irritable bowel syndrome; and\ninsomnia. Dr. Britton believes that this syndrome is directly\nattributable to Post’s car accident and that it renders her disabled\nfrom any sustained employment.\n\n       In keeping with Dr. Britton’s determination, Post’s view\nof the record is that it indicates that she sustained a traumatic\nwhiplash injury that sensitized her central nervous system, thus\ntriggering the development of chronic pain syndrome. This is\nDr. Britton’s diagnosis, and it is supported by a number of other\nevaluations in the record.\n\n        Hartford, on the other hand, believes that the record\nindicates that Post suffered no more than a whiplash injury that\nhas now healed. While it concedes that Post continues to report\npain, it contends that the record contains no reliable diagnosis of\na recognized debilitating condition. In support of its view,\nHartford primarily relies on the reports of Dr. Ekaterina\nMalievskaia, its reviewing physician, and Dr. Christopher\nLynch, who performed an independent medical examination.\nHartford also cites the opinions of Drs. Michael John Fiore and\n\n\n\n                                 5\n\fJoel Harris,1 who evaluated Post in 1994 and 1996, respectively.\n\n\n   1\n     Dr. Harris’s conclusion on the issue of disability is, at best,\nunclear. On a Hartford form, he indicated that Post could sit,\nstand, walk, and drive for one hour each in an eight-hour\nworkday. The form asked that he circle for each activity a\nnumber between one and eight. Zero was not an option. In any\nevent, his responses indicate that she could sit, stand, walk, and\ndrive for a total of four of eight hours. It is unclear how she\ncould maintain employment without sitting, standing, walking,\nor driving for the other four hours of a typical day.\n         In addition Dr. Harris noted that Post could not lift or\ncarry any weight at all, not even one pound. Nor could she\nclimb, balance, stoop, kneel, crouch, crawl, reach, handle,\nfinger, or feel.\n         Hartford and our dissenting colleague focus on the fact\nthat, in a section asking what degree of work Post could tolerate,\nHarris checked “sedentary work.” This was the least intensive\noption available. The form did not provide a way of responding\nthat the patient could not tolerate work at all.\n         In the comments section of the form, Dr. Harris wrote:\n                Severe pain — head, neck, & lower jaw.\n                Back pain limits any mobility without\n                severe pain. Cannot sit in chair for\n                treatment without pain.\nThese comments and responses render the form, at the least,\nambiguous as to Post’s condition. Read most fairly, the great\nweight of the form indicates a significant level of disability. It\ntakes a highly selective reading to conclude that it indicates that\nPost was capable of working (without sitting, standing, walking,\n\n                                 6\n\f       This case is governed by the Employee Retirement\nIncome Security Act (“ERISA”), 29 U.S.C. §§ 1001–1461,\nbecause Overlook Hosiptal’s disability plan (the “Plan”) is an\n“employee welfare benefit plan” as defined by 29 U.S.C.\n§ 1002(1). Post filed a disability claim with Hartford,\nOverlook’s disability carrier, soon after she ceased working in\n1995. Hartford approved her claim, subject to periodic renewal.\nTo be considered “totally disabled” under the Plan after\nDecember 6, 1997, she had to be “prevented by [d]isability from\ndoing any occupation or work for which [she was] or could\nbecome qualified.”\n\n       From 1995 until 2002, Hartford paid out benefits. In\nAugust 1998, the Social Security Administration approved\nPost’s application for disability benefits, citing intractable\ncervical pain, chronic pain syndrome, and fibromyalgia 2 as the\n\n\nor driving, for half of the workday).\n   2\n       In the words of Judge Posner, fibromyalgia is\n          a common, but elusive and mysterious, disease,\n          much like chronic fatigue syndrome, with which\n          it shares a number of features. See Frederick\n          Wolfe et al., “The American College of\n          Rheumatology 1990 Criteria for the Classification\n          of Fibromyalgia: Report of the Multicenter\n          Criteria Committee,” 33 Arthritis & Rheumatism\n          160 (1990); Lawrence M. Tierney, Jr., Stephen J.\n          McPhee & Maxine A. Papadakis, Current\n\n                                 7\n\frelevant diagnoses. Soon after Post was approved for Social\nSecurity benefits, Hartford asked her to submit a copy of the\nadministrative decision so that it could offset her benefits. She\nresponded through counsel that Hartford was not entitled to an\noffset under the plain language of the Plan, but she did provide\nHartford with a copy of the decision. Hartford eventually\nrelented and accepted Post’s reading of the Plan.\n\n       For reasons not apparent from the record, sometime in\n\n\n\n      Medical Diagnosis & Treatment 1995 708-09\n      (1995). Its cause or causes are unknown, there is\n      no cure, and, of greatest importance to disability\n      law, its symptoms are entirely subjective. There\n      are no laboratory tests for the presence or severity\n      of fibromyalgia. The principal symptoms are\n      “pain all over,” fatigue, disturbed sleep, stiffness,\n      and—the only symptom that discriminates\n      between it and other diseases of a rheumatic\n      character—multiple tender spots, more precisely\n      18 fixed locations on the body (and the rule of\n      thumb is that the patient must have at least 11 of\n      them to be diagnosed as having fibromyalgia) that\n      when pressed firmly cause the patient to flinch.\n      All these symptoms are easy to fake, although few\n      applicants for disability benefits may yet be aware\n      of the specific locations that if palpated will cause\n      the patient who really has fibromyalgia to flinch.\nSarchet v. Charter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"714168\"><a href=\"/opinion/714168/50-socsecrepser-323-unemplinsrep-cch-p-15128b-marlin-sarchet-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">305</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 306–07 (7th Cir. 1996).\n\n                               8\n\flate 1999 Hartford took a renewed interest in Post’s claim. The\ncompany surveilled her and reported in its claim notes that\nsurveillance was unsuccessful, as she was not seen leaving her\nhouse. Hartford also began requesting copies of Post’s tax\nrecords, ostensibly to take a non-Social Security income offset,\nas the Plan allowed. It provides that “Hartford has the right to\nrequire, as part of Proof of Loss: (1) your [Post’s] signed\nstatement identifying all Other Income Benefits, and (2)\n[s]atisfactory proof to the Hartford that you and your\nDependents have duly applied for all Other Income Benefits\nwhich are available. The Hartford reserves the right to\ndetermine if proof of loss is satisfactory.” Hartford contends\nthat the “proof . . . that you . . . have duly applied for all Other\nIncome Benefits” language gives it the right to demand tax\nreturns, though it is not clear how a tax return would reflect\nwhether Post had applied for other income benefits. The plain\nlanguage of this provision does not authorize the review of tax\nreturns. (Incidentally, the tax returns confirm that Post was not\nreceiving any income during the disputed period.)\n\n       In June 2001, Hartford determined that Post should\nsubmit to an independent functional capacity evaluation to\nconfirm her disability. This was permissible under the Plan.\nHartford hired a third-party service to notify Post of its request\nand to set up the evaluation. Because Post had requested that all\ncommunication go through counsel, the service’s operator\nphoned her attorney to schedule the evaluation. Here, the\nconfusion began. As Hartford’s counsel explained at oral\n\n                                 9\n\fargument, apparently the service’s operator told Post’s attorney\nthat Post had requested that he be phoned to schedule the\nevaluation—meaning simply that Post had requested that all\ncommunication go through him. Post’s attorney took the\nstatement to mean that Post had requested the evaluation; thus,\nwhen he spoke with Post and found that she knew nothing about\nit, he relayed to the service that she had not requested it. It then\nreported to Hartford that Post had refused an evaluation in\nviolation of the Plan. No written request was ever made.\n\n       In lieu of a functional capacity evaluation, Hartford\nreferred Post’s file to its medical director, Dr. Malievskaia. She\nconducted a paper review and concluded that Post was not\ndisabled because of a lack of objective findings, specifically the\nabsence of 11 of 18 potential trigger points that would support\na diagnosis of fibromyalgia.\n\n        In January 2002, Hartford terminated Post’s benefits. In\nits termination letter, Hartford quoted the Plan’s termination\ntriggers, putting the following in bold font: “the date you refuse\nto be examined, if The Hartford requires an examination.” The\nletter went on to cite as the bases for termination Post’s alleged\nfailure to submit to an evaluation at Hartford’s request and Dr.\nMalievskaia’s conclusion that Post was not disabled. The letter\nalso invited Post to file an appeal within 60 days and to send any\ndocuments that she believed relevant. In March 2002, Hartford\ndenied Post’s appeal. Hartford, however, recognized the\nconfusion over scheduling the evaluation and offered to revisit\n\n                                10\n\fits decision if she agreed to one. In the meantime, Post had sued\nHartford for wrongful denial of benefits, and undergoing an\nevaluation became part of a settlement agreement. The\nsettlement fully resolved that lawsuit.\n\n        Because Post’s treating physicians refused to write a\nprescription for a full-scale functional capacity evaluation, citing\nthe damage it might cause given Post’s condition, Hartford\nagreed to a less strenuous examination. To perform the exam,\nHartford hired Dr. Christopher Lynch. The record does not\nreflect any board certifications or specialties, only that he is a\nphysician. His examination consisted primarily of testing Post\nfor the 18 trigger points for fibromyalgia. Finding tenderness\nbut no definite trigger points, Dr. Lynch concluded that she did\nnot have fibromyalgia or any other disabling condition. After he\nsubmitted his report, Hartford issued a final denial of Post’s\nclaim. Hartford specifically directed Dr. Lynch not to submit\nhis report to Post, so she had no opportunity to respond to it.\n\n        Post then filed this suit in the District Court. In it, she\nclaims that Hartford violated 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(1) and (2).\nSubparagraph 1132(a)(1)(B) allows an ERISA plan beneficiary\nto sue “to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his\nplan, to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan, or to\nclarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.”\nParagraph 1132(a)(2) allows a beneficiary to sue for breaches of\nfiduciary duties that cause losses to the plan.\n\n\n\n                                11\n\f       The District Court granted summary judgment in\nHartford’s favor on the § 1132(a)(1)(B) claim, ruling that Post\ncould not establish that Hartford acted arbitrarily and\ncapriciously in denying her benefits. The Court also granted\nHartford summary judgment on the § 1132(a)(2) claim on the\nground that it was barred by res judicata. Specifically, the\nCourt noted that it had dismissed that claim with prejudice in\nPost’s previous suit, and so she could not revive it in this suit.\nPost appeals both rulings.3\n\nII.

This approach grants the administrator deference in\naccordance with the level of conflict.

In Pinto, we held that\nthe sliding scale approach was most faithful to Firestone’s\ncommand that the level of conflict be considered as a factor in\nshaping arbitrary and capricious review. 214 F.3d at 392.\n\n       B.     Contours of the Sliding Scale\n\n       The premise of the sliding scale approach is that courts\nshould examine benefit denials on their facts to determine\nwhether the administrator abused its discretion. Id. at 391. To\napply the approach, courts first consider the evidence that the\nadministrator acted from an improper motive and heighten their\nlevel of scrutiny appropriately. Id. at 392. Second, they review\nthe merits of the decision and the evidence of impropriety\ntogether to determine whether the administrator properly\nexercised the discretion accorded it. Id. at 394. If so, its\ndecision stands; if not, the court steps into the shoes of the\nadministrator and rules on the merits itself.\n\n       At its best, the sliding scale reduces to making a\ncommon-sense decision based on the evidence whether the\nadministrator appropriately exercised its discretion. This theme,\nrather than getting bogged down in trying to find the perfect\npoint on the sliding scale, should be district courts’ touchstone.\n\n\n\n\n                               15\n\f       C.      Sorting Individual Cases\n\n       Determining how to apply heightened arbitrary and\ncapricious review requires considering both structural and\nprocedural factors. Pinto, 214 F.3d at 392–93. The structural\ninquiry focuses on the financial incentives created by the way\nthe plan is organized, whereas the procedural inquiry focuses on\nhow the administrator treated the particular claimant. While\nthere is no magic to the order in which these inquiries are\nconducted, our previous cases have considered structure first.\nWe do the same.\n\n               1.     Structural factors\n\n        Our concern with structure derives from the common law\nof trusts. As the Supreme Court noted in Firestone, the law of\ntrusts requires that courts take a trustee’s self-interest into\naccount. 489 U.S. at 115 (quoting Restatement (Second) of\nTrusts § 187 cmt. d (1959)).               The Court based this\npronouncement primarily on the Second Restatement. Since\nthen, the ALI has published the Third Restatement, which\nfurther clarifies that while it is permissible for a trustee to act\nunder a structural conflict of interest, its discretionary decisions\n“will be subject to especially careful scrutiny.” Restatement\n(Third) of Trusts § 37 cmt. f(1) (2003). Under ERISA, plan\nadministrators are, for most purposes, treated like common-law\ntrustees. Firestone, 489 U.S. at 110. Like common-law\ntrustees, plan administrators are accorded discretion and judicial\n\n                                16\n\fdeference (if the plan so provides); in return, they assume\nfiduciary duties of care and loyalty to their beneficiaries. 29\nU.S.C. § 1104(a). So long as we have no reason to doubt the\nadministrator’s faithfulness to those duties, this model works\nwell. We, however, are wary of according a fiduciary deference\nwhen the structure of the plan gives it financial incentives to act\nagainst the participants’ interest. See Restatement (Third) of\nTrusts § 50 illus. 1.\n\n        As an initial note, federal courts of appeals are split on\nthe issue of what is a structural conflict. We have long held that\na structural conflict arises when the administrator has a non-\ntrivial financial incentive to act against the interests of the\nbeneficiaries. Pinto, 214 F.3d at 389. Such a conflict is, by\nitself, sufficient to heighten our review.5 Id. at 390. Our\nCourt’s holdings are in line with black-letter trust law. The\nSecond Restatement, on which the Supreme Court relied in\nFirestone, defines a “conflict” as merely “an interest in the\ntrustee conflicting with that of the beneficiaries.” Restatement\n(Second) of Trusts § 187 cmt. d (1959). This statement is\nworded broadly—almost to the point of being tautological—but\n\n\n    5\n       In this regard, we share the view of the Fourth, Fifth,\nEighth, Tenth, and Eleventh Circuit Courts of Appeals.

Liberty Life Assur. Co. of\nBoston, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"793385\"><a href=\"/opinion/793385/allan-e-rud-v-liberty-life-assurance-company-of-boston/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">772</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 776 (7th Cir 2006) (Posner, J.). The\nproblem, it argues, is that we generally assume that parties to a\ncontract are self-interested, and it is inimical to the law of\ncontracts to confuse self-interest with a conflict of interest. Id.\nThis is no doubt logical, yet the Supreme Court has held that\nERISA places us in the realm of trust law, not contract law.\nFirestone, 489 U.S. at 110–11. Moreover, were we to apply\ncontract law, we would review plans de novo from the start, for\nthere is no analog to fiduciary discretion in the common law of\ncontracts. But we are not, and our position, in strict accordance\nwith Supreme Court precedent, follows the common law of\ntrusts.\n\n       Pinto listed four non-exclusive structural factors for\ncourts to consider: (1) the sophistication of the parties, (2) the\ninformation accessible to the beneficiary, (3) the financial\narrangement between the employer and administrator, and (4)\nthe financial status of the administrator. 214 F.3d at 392.

Pinto, 214 F.3d at 388. We emphasize that\ncourts should focus on this question and not get bogged down in\nfactors, for this is anything but a mechanistic test. Rather, it is\na broad-based inquiry into whether the structure of the plan\nraises concerns about the administrator’s financial incentive to\ndeny coverage improperly. This makes sense, as ERISA plans\ncome in many forms.\n\n       We have held that two aspects of some plans’ financial\nstructure raise particular concern: (1) when a plan is funded on\na case-by-case basis, Skretvedt v. E.I. DuPont & De Nemours\nCo., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">268</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">167</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 174 (3d Cir. 2001), and (2) when it is funded\nand administered by an outside insurer, Pinto, 214 F.3d at 390.\nCase-by-case funding simply means that the administrator pays\nclaims out of its operating budget, rather than from segregated\nmonies that the employer sets aside according to an actuarial\nformula. This raises concerns because it means that each dollar\npaid out is a dollar out of the administrator’s pocket. Stratton,\n363 F.3d at 254. Thus, the administrator has a financial\nincentive to deny claims.\n\n\n\n                                 19\n\f        This concern is compounded when it is an outside\ninsurer, rather than the employer, that funds and administers the\nplan, for we presume that employers have at least some self-\ninterest in seeing that benefits are paid fairly. After all,\nemployees’ morale will suffer if they perceive that their benefits\nare illusory. When the plan is funded by an outside insurer,\nhowever, the employer is a step removed from the process,\nmaking it less likely to feel the full effects of employee\ndissatisfaction with claims handling. Pinto, 214 F.3d at 389.6\n\n         We have also noted that when the claimant is a former\nemployee, any dissatisfaction with the claims handling process\nis less likely to translate into a significant financial disincentive\nfor the employer. Id. at 388. In addition, when the employer is\nin financial difficulty, the dissatisfaction of employees is less\nlikely to be an incentive favoring them because paying off\ncreditors will probably take priority over keeping up employee\nmorale. Id. at 392.\n\n       Importantly, under Pinto, the structural analysis does not\n\n\n  6\n    It is worth noting that we have held that when the employer\nboth funds and administers the plan, but pays benefits out of a\nfully funded and segregated ERISA trust fund rather than its\noperating budget, no structural conflict of interest is created.\nVitale, 420 F.3d at 282; Bill Gray Enters., Inc.

Indeed, as Pinto held,\nthe structure alone can require heightened review. 214 F.3d at\n390. Pinto itself concerned a structure in which the plan\nadministrator was an outside insurance company that received\nan actuarial premium from the employer. Id. Thus, what the\ninsurer/administrator paid out came directly off its bottom line.\nPinto noted that this structure creates a high level of financial\nconflict of interest, as the insurer/administrator has a strong\nincentive to construe claims in a light most favorable to it. Id.\nat 389. Thus, Pinto held that this structure alone gives rise to\nheightened scrutiny. Id. at 390.\n\n       When there is a structural conflict of interest mitigated by\nindependent claim evaluation and no evidence of procedural\nbias, we have heightened our review only slightly. Stratton, 363\nF.3d at 254–56. The animating logic of that case is that while\nthere was a conflict of interest, there was also good reason to\nbelieve that it was of little moment, and so we held that we\nwould defer to the administrator unless its decision was clearly\nunreasonable or not a product of an exercise of discretion at all.\n\n       When structural bias is not mitigated by independent\nclaim evaluation, we have heightened our review a bit more.\nSee Smathers v. Multi-Tool, Inc./Multi-Plastics, Inc. Employee\nHealth & Welfare Plan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"778520\"><a href=\"/opinion/778520/william-reed-smathers-v-multi-tool-incmulti-plastics-inc-employee/\"><span class=\"volume\">298</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">191</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 199 (3d Cir. 2002).\nThere, we emphasized that we were not free to substitute our\njudgment for that of the fiduciary.

Id. at 200.\n\n        It is worth noting that we have not reported a case in\nwhich structural factors alone warranted anything more than\nmoderately heightening our review. This is not fortuitous.\nStructural conflicts of interest warrant more searching review,\nbut in the absence of evidence that bias infected the particular\ndecision at issue, we defer to an administrator’s reasonable and\ncarefully considered conclusions.

Procedural Factors\n\n        As Pinto held, courts must also examine the process by\nwhich the administrator came to its decision to determine\nwhether there is evidence of bias. 214 F.3d at 393. This sort of\nevidence can come in many forms, and a review of the caselaw\nreveals that we have identified numerous procedural\nirregularities that can raise suspicion. The following is an\nillustrative, not exhaustive, list of the irregularities identified:\n(1) reversal of position without additional medical evidence, id.;\n(2) self-serving selectivity in the use and interpretation of\nphysicians’ reports, id.; (3) disregarding staff recommendations\nthat benefits be awarded, id. at 394; and (4) requesting a medical\nexamination when all of the evidence indicates disability,\nKosiba v. Merck & Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"787805\"><a href=\"/opinion/787805/michaeleen-kosiba-celeslie-epps-malloy-v-merck-company-unum-life/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">58</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 67 (3d Cir. 2004).\n\n                                22\n\f        In considering procedural factors, the focus is whether,\nin this claimant’s case, the administrator has given the court\nreason to doubt its fiduciary neutrality. If it has, then the court\nmust decide how much to heighten its scrutiny. If the\nirregularities are minor, few in number, and not sustained, then\nthey may not counsel for raising the level much at all, for minor\nglitches reasonably can be chalked up to low-level carelessness.\nIf, however, they are more serious, numerous, or regular, then\nthey should raise more suspicion. Kosiba, 384 F.3d at 66; Pinto,\n214 F.3d at 393. Given the administrator’s familiarity with the\nclaims process and the duties of a fiduciary, marked deviations\nfrom procedural norms cannot but raise questions about its\nneutrality.\n\n       In the face of significant evidence of procedural bias, we\nhave reviewed its decision closely. Pinto, 214 F.3d at 394.\nWhen an ERISA administrator is not acting in accord with its\nfiduciary status, we are naturally wary of according it much of\nthe deference that it would otherwise receive as a result of that\nstatus. Id. Evidence that an administrator’s decision was\nincorrect, coupled with evidence it was biased, can add up to a\nconclusion that its decision was not the product of reasoned\ndiscretion, but of anti-claimant bias, in which case the decision\nshould be reversed. Id. at 395.\n\n       In the face of non-trivial evidence of procedural bias, the\nstandard of review should be raised; the more difficult question\nis how much. In Kosiba, we discerned non-trivial evidence of\n\n                                23\n\fprocedural bias but, as it was neither egregious nor coupled with\nevidence of structural bias, we heightened our scrutiny only a\nmoderate amount. 384 F.3d at 68. In Pinto, on the other hand,\nwe found that the evidence of procedural bias was coupled with\nevidence of structural bias, and so we heightened our review\nsubstantially. 214 F.3d at 394.\n\nIII.   Applying the Sliding Scale to This Case\n\n       A.      Structural Factors\n\n       Addressing the structural factors, the District Court\nseemed to confuse the structural analyses in Pinto and Stratton.\nPinto held that a non-trivial structural conflict gives rise to\nheightened scrutiny—that is, it pushes the standard of review\nabove the low end of the sliding scale. 214 F.3d at 393.\nStratton added that when the structural conflict is trivial, the low\nend of the scale is appropriate. 363 F.3d at 254–55. What made\nt h e c o n f l ic t triv ia l in S tr a tto n w a s t h a t t h e\nemployer/administrator, while conflicted, was a step removed\nfrom the claim evaluation process. Id. Here, on the other hand,\nthe administrator is an outside insurer that makes claims\ndecisions itself. This is the very sort of conflict that Pinto\ndeclared to be substantial and worthy of raising the standard of\nreview. 214 F.3d at 393. In addition, Post is a former\nemployee, so it is doubtful that her dissatisfaction with the\nclaims-handling process will filter back to Overlook and\ntranslate into pressure on Hartford to deal more precisely with\n\n                                24\n\fclaims.\n\n       The District Court correctly noted that the other factors\nmentioned in Pinto—sophistication of the parties, accessibility\nof information, and the financial status of the\nadministrator—seem not to counsel in favor of heightened\nscrutiny. Following Pinto, however, the structural factors that\ndo present a conflict of interest are sufficient to require at least\nmoderately heightened review. Id. We now proceed to whether\nprocedural factors counsel us to increase even more our degree\nof review.\n\n       B.      Procedural Factors\n\n        On the issue of procedural irregularities, the District\nCourt wrote that “procedural anomalies appear to form a pattern\nof Hartford being overly aggressive in its attempts to reduce or\neliminate Post’s [disability] benefits and then attempting to\nrectify the situation when it realized its error.” The Court named\nfour aspects of the process that appeared irregular, yet it\nultimately concluded that they were too minor to heighten\nfurther its scrutiny. We address each in turn and two additional\nmatters brought up by Post.\n\n       First, Hartford attempted to use Post’s Social Security\nbenefits to offset her disability benefits, despite the Plan not\nallowing such an offset. After Post’s attorney protested,\nHartford relented. This, of course, may have been a good-faith\n\n                                25\n\fmistake on Hartford’s part, but it is a plan administrator’s\nresponsibility to know the contents of the plan. Our dissenting\ncolleague believes that the Plan itself was confusing enough that\nHartford’s mistake was understandable. But Hartford is a large,\nsophisticated insurance company, and the Plan is its own design.\nThus, we are less willing to draw such benign inferences\n(particularly at the summary judgment stage, where we draw all\nreasonable inferences in Post’s favor) from Hartford’s supposed\nconfusion about the contents of its own contract.\n\n       Second, Hartford terminated Post’s benefits in part\nbecause she allegedly refused to undergo a functional capacity\nevaluation. The record suggests, however, that Post had not\nrefused an evaluation and that Hartford was quick to conclude\nthat she had despite never making a written request. During the\nappeals process, however, Hartford relented and agreed to\nreconsider Post’s appeal if she would agree to undergo an\nevaluation. Of concern is that Hartford did not allow Post to see\nDr. Lynch’s report before making its final decision to terminate.\nThus she had no opportunity to allow her treating physicians to\ncomment on it.\n\n       Third, Hartford’s decision to terminate benefits relied\nheavily on Dr. Malievskaia’s report, which was not based on a\nphysical examination. While the District Court correctly noted\nthat ERISA does not require that plan administrators give the\nopinions of treating physicians special weight, Black & Decker\nDisability Plan v. Nord, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"127929\"><a href=\"/opinion/127929/black-decker-disability-plan-v-nord/\"><span class=\"volume\">538</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">822</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 823–24 (2003), courts\n\n                               26\n\fmust still consider the circumstances that surround an\nadministrator ordering a paper review. On one hand, nothing in\nthe record specifically suggests that Hartford ordered this review\nin bad faith, as, we assume, periodic reviews are typical in the\nindustry. On the other hand, we note that at the time of the\nreview the overwhelming weight of evidence in Post’s record\nargued in her favor.7\n\n       Fourth, Hartford surveilled Post. As the District Court\nnoted, while surveillance is an aggressive tactic, nothing\nprohibits its use. Post argues that the bothersome point is that\nHartford continued to investigate her claim despite its\nsurveillance revealing that she did not leave her home. We\nagree. The fact that Post did not leave her home while she was\nunder surveillance is perfectly consistent with, and corroborative\nof, her claim for disability. Yet Hartford was undeterred in\n\n\n\n   7\n      Our dissenting colleague views the record differently on\nthis point as well. At the time of the paper review, all of Post’s\ntreating physicians’ reports save one argued in her favor. It is\ntrue that Dr. Fiore in 1994 (before she filed for, and was\ngranted, disability benefits the first time) labeled her “not\ndisabled” after a single examination, but every other\ndoctor—and we include Dr. Harris in this group, see supra note\n1—indicated a high level of disability through Hartford’s 2002\ndenial of benefits. Given the regular reports indicating disability\nfrom her treating physicians, we believe that the record was far\nin Post’s favor at the time of Hartford’s paper review.\n\n                                27\n\fcontinuing to pursue evidence that Post was not disabled.\nIndeed, the very fact that its employees characterized the results\nof the surveillance as “unsuccessful” suggests that its motive\nwas to find evidence to deny Post’s claim.\n\n         In addition to these incidents, Post cites Hartford’s\nrequest for her tax returns as evidence of bad faith. As the\nDistrict Court pointed out, the Plan did allow Hartford to reduce\nPost’s benefits by the amount of any income she was receiving\nfrom working; thus Hartford’s request for proof that she was\nreceiving none was not beyond the pale. Nonetheless,\nHartford’s pursuit of Post’s tax returns in the face of ambiguous\nPlan language is accurately characterized as an aggressive\ntactic.8\n\n\n  8\n     In this context we note that on February 29, 2000, Hartford\ndemanded that Post submit her 1999 tax return within 30 days.\nAs any taxpayer knows, that return was not due to the IRS until\nApril 15, 2000. Perhaps this was an oversight on Hartford’s\npart, but it reinforces the impression that Hartford was on the\noffense in its demands for information.\n        We further note that we cannot agree with our dissenting\ncolleague that the Plan clearly allowed demanding tax returns on\npenalty of forfeiture. In the Plan, Hartford specifically reserved\nitself “the right to require, as part of Proof of Loss: (1) your\n[Post’s] signed statement identifying all Other Income Benefits,\nand (2) [s]atisfactory proof to the Hartford that you and your\nDependents have duly applied for all Other Income Benefits\nwhich are available.” Tax returns do not easily fit into either\n\n                               28\n\f        Post also cites Hartford’s denial of benefits despite a\nfavorable Social Security decision as evidence of bad faith. Our\nCourt has not passed on the relevance of Social Security\ndecisions in determining the appropriate standard of review, but\nother courts of appeals and some district courts have held that a\ndisagreement with the Social Security Administration is a\nrelevant—though not dispositive—factor.

We agree that\na disagreement is relevant though not dispositive, particularly\n(as here) when the administrator rejects the very diagnoses on\n\n\n\n\ncategory. As this was Hartford’s contract, it had every\nopportunity expressly to provide for the right to demand tax\nreturns if it wished to do so. But it did not require this\nexpressly. Thus, we believe that threatening forfeiture for\nrefusing to provide information to which the Plan did not give\nit a right was, at the least, aggressive.\n\n                               29\n\fwhich the Social Security benefits determination is based.9\n\n       In sum, we agree with the District Court that, on this\nrecord, each irregularity here may appear minor. But given their\nnumber and regularity, the standard of review should be further\nheightened. As in Kosiba, we recognize that Hartford may offer\nplausible explanations for those irregularities, but in setting the\nstandard of review the issue is merely whether the process raises\nquestions. See 384 F.3d at 68. In this case, the sheer number of\nirregularities coupled with Hartford’s aggressive posture raise\nconcerns, and so the standard of review must be heightened.\nThis procedural posture suggests that we move toward the high\nend of the sliding scale, much as we did in Pinto. 214 F.3d at\n394.\n\n\n     9\n       Hartford argues that its conclusion is not necessarily\ninconsistent with the Social Security Administration’s\ndetermination, as Post’s intractable cervical pain, chronic pain\nsyndrome, and fibromyalgia might have healed between 1998\n(when the Social Security Administration awarded her benefits)\nand 2002 (when Hartford denied them). Perhaps, but neither Dr.\nMalievskaia nor Dr. Lynch directly addressed the Social\nSecurity decision, nor did either of them posit that Post had\nthese disorders but recovered from them. Rather, both seemed\nto conclude that Post was never totally disabled. J.A. 296 (Dr.\nLynch’s conclusions) & 343–44 (Dr. Malievskaia’s\nconclusions). As their conclusions appear to be in tension with\nthose of the Social Security Administration, we believe the\ndisagreement is relevant.\n\n                                30\n\f       C.     Conclusion\n\n        Both structural and procedural factors favor a more\nsearching standard of review than was used here. In light of\nwhat we believe the standard of review should be, the District\nCourt erred by applying only slightly heightened review.\nMoving toward the high end of the sliding scale, the District\nCourt must searchingly review both the merits and the process\nto determine if Hartford’s decision was not the product of\nreasoned, disinterested discretion. No doubt the evidence on the\nmerits appears close. But a factfinder reviewing the merits\ncould yet determine that the weight of the medical evidence\nsupports Post and that it, coupled with the evidence of bias,\nyields the conclusion that Hartford did not properly exercise its\ndiscretion.\n\nIV.    Other Issues\n\n       A.     Closure of the Record\n\n       Generally, only evidence in the administrative record is\nadmissible for the purpose of determining whether the plan\nadministrator’s decision was arbitrary and capricious.

Kosiba, 384 F.3d\nat 67 n.5. That evidence must show “potential biases and\nconflicts.” Id. In particular, we have noted that considering\nevidence of a plan’s funding mechanism would be appropriate.\nId. Here, however, Post’s supplemental exhibits are all medical\nreports. The first five are reports from doctors that Post\nconsulted between 1993 (just after the accident) and 1996. See\nAppellant’s Br. 6–9. The last two are summaries of Post’s\ncondition prepared by her current doctors at the request of\ncounsel in May 2005 (nearly two years after Hartford issued its\nfinal denial of benefits). Id. at 18–19, 28. Post has provided no\nexplanation why the reports produced between 1993 and 1996\nwere not sent to Hartford for its consideration. Similarly, if she\nwanted Hartford to consider her treating physicians’ responses\nto Dr. Lynch’s report or their summaries of her medical\ncondition, she should have submitted them (and thus made them\npart of the administrative record) soon after she received\nHartford’s denial of benefits, but she did not. Because all of\nthese documents are medical reports, they are not relevant to the\nissue of bias; rather, they are only relevant to whether Hartford\nreached the right decision. Under Mitchell, they cannot be\nconsidered for that purpose because they were not submitted to\nHartford and made part of the record. 113 F.3d at 440. Thus,\nthe District Court acted properly in not considering them.\n\n\n\n\n                               32\n\f       B.

That\nletter explains at length the administrator’s reasons for declining\nto continue disability benefits. It describes and principally relies\nupon an investigation conducted by Dr. Christopher G. Lynch,\nM.D. Dr. Lynch was engaged by Hartford in order to secure\nindependent evaluation of Post’s claim to “total disability”\nbenefits. 11 In the course of his investigation, Dr. Lynch\nphysically examined Post and reviewed all of the medical\nrecords accumulated over the preceding ten years.\n\n\n\n\n       The administrator’s letter accurately reflects Dr. Lynch’s\nreport and, like that report, is reasoned, thorough and makes a\npersuasive case for the conclusion that Post, while suffering\nfrom chronic pain syndrome, is not totally disabled. It\n\n\n\n    11\n      Under the Plan, to be considered “totally disabled” after\nDecember 6, 1997, Post would have to be “prevented by\nDisability from doing any occupation or work for which [she is]\nor could become qualified by: (1) training; (2) education; or (3)\nexperience.” JA 77. When Post was originally granted benefits,\nthe applicable definition of “totally disabled” was that she was\n“prevented by Disability from doing all the material and\nsubstantial duties of [her] own occupation.” Under the terms of\nthe Plan, the definition changed once Post had been disabled for\n24 months plus 180 days. JA 76-77, 83.\n\n                                37\n\fconcludes with the following quotations from Dr. Lynch’s\nreport:\n\n\n\n\n        Dr. Lynch found that “multiple physical exams\n        have shown nothing more than tender muscles at\n        times and occasional trigger points.” According\n        to Dr. Lynch: “An equal number of examinations\n        have found no tender muscles or trigger points.\n        Thus, there can be no consistent physical\n        disability over this period of time.”\n\n\n\n\n        With respect to the need to assign physical\n        restrictions and limitations, Dr. Lynch provided\n        these remarks: “Given the multiple normal\n        examinations, including my own of today,12 I feel\n\n\n   12\n    Dr. Lynch’s report described his observations during his\nexamination of Post as follows:\n\n        On examination today, she is alert, cooperative\n        and in no distress. Affect is a bit flat. She\n        appeared to be in no distress although she stated\n        she had total body pain.\n\n\n                               38\n\f      she could perform sedentary to light work as\n      usually defined – light work, lifting up to 20\n      pounds maximum with frequent lifting or carrying\n      of objects weighing up to 10 pounds. She should\n      have the ability to change posture at fairly\n\n\n      Examination of the upper extremities reveals no\n      deformities. There is no focal motor, reflex or\n      sensory loss. She has normal pain free range of\n      motion in all upper extremity joints including the\n      shoulders. There was no tenderness over the\n      forearm or upper arm musculature.\n\n      Examination of the head, neck and back reveals\n      no deformities. Range of motion in the cervical\n      spine was 15-20 degrees of left and right lateral\n      rotation with normal flexion and extension.\n      Range of motion in the low back was 60+ degrees\n      of flexion with 5-10 degrees of extension.\n      Palpation over the cervical and thoracic regions\n      reveals no definite tenderness and no trigger\n      points were palpated.        Palpation over the\n      lumbosacral spine reveals no tenderness. She was\n      somewhat tender over the greater trochanters\n      bilaterally. Motor, reflex and sensory exams were\n      normal in the lower extremities. She has normal\n      pain free range of motion in all lower extremity\n      joints. Gait is normal.\n\nJA 292-93.\n\n                             39\n\f       frequent intervals.”\n\n\n\n\n       Citing the restrictions and limitations identified by\n       Dr. Lynch, Ms. Post would not be prevented by\n       disability from doing any occupation or work for\n       which she is qualified by training, education or\n       experience.\n\n\n\n\nJA 289-90 (footnote added).\n\n\n\n\n       While Post stresses that several treating physicians had\nexpressed the opinion that she was unable to work and that the\nSocial Security Administration found her disabled in 1998, she\ndoes not point to any segment of her medical records that\ncontradicts Dr. Lynch’s characterizations of those records in\nthese quotations. Nor can Post dispute the fact that Dr. Lynch\nis the only physician having no continuing relationship with\nHartford or Post who physically examined her and studied all of\nher medical records.\n\n\n\n\n                                40\n\f              II. Standard of Review Evidence\n\n                    A. Structural Factors\n\n\n\n\n       Under the teachings of Pinto, it is clear that Hartford has\na material conflict of interest. It serves as both payor and\ndecision maker and there are no other factors that ameliorate the\nincentive thus created to deny benefits. This calls for a\n“heightening” of the “arbitrary or capricious” standard of review\nwhich is applicable in all cases where an ERISA plan vests\ndiscretion in the administrator.\n\n\n\n\n       [A] heightened standard of review would appear\n       to be appropriate when a plan funder like an\n       insurance company “incurs a direct expense,” the\n       consequences to it are direct and contemporary,\n       and, while it has incentives to maintain good\n       business relationships, it lacks the incentive to\n       “avoid the loss of morale and higher wage\n       demands that result [for an employer] from a\n       denial of benefits.”\n\n\n\n\n                               41\n\f                               ***\n\n\n\n\n               For all the foregoing reasons, we believe\n       that a higher standard of review is required when\n       reviewing benefits denials of insurance companies\n       paying ERISA benefits out of their own funds.\n\n\n\n\nPinto, 214 F.3d at 389, 390; see also Kosiba v. Merck & Co.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"787805\"><a href=\"/opinion/787805/michaeleen-kosiba-celeslie-epps-malloy-v-merck-company-unum-life/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">58</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 65-66 (3d Cir. 2004).\n\n\n\n\n                    B. Procedural Factors\n\n\n\n\n       It is equally clear from Pinto that the “heightened”\nreview arising from this structural conflict of interest would be\n“ratcheted upward” if there were anomalies in the procedure by\nwhich the administrator’s decision was reached that give the\nCourt reason to doubt its fiduciary neutrality. Pinto, 214 F.3d\nat 394; Kosiba, 384 F.3d at 66. I believe a fair reading of the\nrecord in this case fails to suggest anything other than neutrality,\nhowever. To the contrary, the record affirmatively suggests that\nHartford’s search for the answer to the “total disability” issue\n\n                                42\n\fwas conducted in a fair, impartial and cooperative manner.\nEach of the anomalies that trouble the Court appear troubling\nonly if one engages in speculation having no record support.\n\n\n\n\n          It is true, as the Court notes, that Hartford requested a\ncopy of Post’s social security award so that it could offset her\nsocial security benefits against her disability benefits. This\nmistake was understandable, however, and promptly corrected\nwhen the error was called to Hartford’s attention. The ERISA\nplan of Post’s former employer, which Hartford administers,\nappears to be a standard form, but with an attached state-specific\nsection titled “Statutory Provisions,” which, the Plan states, “are\nincluded to bring your booklet-certificate into conformity with\n. . . state law.” JA 78. If one reads Post’s benefits Plan without\npaying careful attention to the statutory provisions, the Plan\nwould appear to allow Hartford to use Post’s Social Security\nbenefits to offset her disability benefits. In the portion of the\nPlan titled “Calculation of Monthly Benefit,” part of step 2 of\nthe calculation is to “subtract all Other Income Benefits,\nincluding those for which you could collect but did not apply.”\nJA 99. In the definitions section of the Plan, “Other Income\nBenefits” is defined by a list, of which item (4) of the first\nparagraph is “[t]he amount of disability or retirement benefits\nunder the United States Social Security Act to which you may be\nentitled because of disability retirement.” JA 86. The “statutory\nprovisions” of the Plan – reflecting New Jersey law – state,\nhowever, that “[i]tems (3) and (4) of the first paragraph of the\ndefinition of Other Income Benefits are deleted.” JA 78. After\nHartford requested the award letter, Post’s counsel responded\n\n                                43\n\fwith a letter calling Hartford’s attention to the error:\n\n\n\n\n               As promised, here is the Notice of Award,\n       and the language in the policy deleting Social\n       Security Benefits from the definition of “Other\n       Income Benefits,” as well as the deleted language\n       itself. As you can see, pursuant to New Jersey\n       law, the situs of this contract, Hartford has no\n       right to take a credit or deduction for or from its\n       obligation due to Social Security’s payments.\n\n\n\n\nJA 216. An internal communication at Hartford reflects that\nHartford then researched the issue, agreed with Post’s counsel’s\nassessment, and determined to “change case management”\naccordingly “so that [it could] correctly administer claims under\nthis Policy.” JA 231.\n\n\n\n\n       It is also true, as the Court notes, that Hartford at one\npoint stated that benefits were being terminated in part because\nPost had declined to undergo a functional capacity evaluation\n(“FCE”). While Post had not at that point declined to take an\nFCE, Hartford’s error clearly cannot be attributed to a lack of\nneutrality on its part. On June 18, 2001, Hartford was advised\nin writing by Empire Medical Management (“EMM”), an\nindependent medical firm that had attempted to arrange an FCE\n\n                                44\n\fthrough Post’s counsel, that she had refused such an\nexamination. In short, Hartford was not a party to the\nmiscommunication that led to this misunderstanding and\nultimately revised its position. Moreover, when one of Post’s\nphysicians later expressed concern about whether an FCE would\naggravate her symptoms, Hartford accommodated those\nconcerns by agreeing to settle for the less strenuous independent\nmedical evaluation (“IME”) that was conducted by Dr. Lynch.\n\n\n\n\n       The Court cites as its second anomaly Hartford’s failure\nto afford Post an opportunity to comment on Dr. Lynch’s report\nbefore sending its October 3, 2003, letter. While the Court\ncorrectly notes that no explanation for this appears in the record,\nthat is not surprising in light of the fact that Post did not\nmaintain before the District Court or before us that this was a\nmatter of concern for her. Post was given a full opportunity to\ndevelop a record before the administrator, and neither the\nsection of the Plan addressing her appeal rights nor\nERISA § 503(2) (addressing internal appeal rights) provides a\nright to comment on the report of an independent medical\nconsultant under the circumstances of this case.\n\n\n\n\n       Third, the majority finds evidence of bad faith in the fact\nthat Hartford’s initial decision to terminate Post’s benefits\n“relied heavily on Dr. Malievskaia’s report,” because (1) Dr.\nMalievskaia’s report was not based on a physical examination,\nand (2) “the overwhelming weight of evidence in Post’s record\n\n                                45\n\fargued in her favor.” Dr. Malievskaia was an Associate Medical\nDirector of Medical Advisory Group (“MAG”), a medical\nconsulting firm that Hartford engaged in the summer of 2001\nfollowing EMM’s June 18, 2001, letter advising of Post’s\nrefusal to submit to an FCE, to “review [Post’s] medical records\nand speak to [Post’s] primary care physician in order to identify\n[her] functional capabilities and address the claimant’s ability to\nperform [a] sedentary to light occupation.” JA 339. Dr.\nMalievskaia did interview two treating physicians and submitted\nher report on September 20, 2001. That report was not relied\nupon in the October 3, 2003, decision letter that we are\nreviewing. It was, however, relied upon in Hartford’s original\ndecision letter of January 4, 2002, the same letter that relied in\npart on what Hartford then understood to be Post’s refusal to be\nexamined. This context, in my view, precludes drawing an\ninference against Hartford from its reliance on Dr.\nMalievskaia’s report. Given that Hartford believed that Post had\nrefused to be examined, and that that fact alone was a sufficient\nreason to terminate her benefits, it makes little sense to penalize\nHartford for taking additional steps to ascertain Post’s medical\ncondition. Moreover, as that report and Hartford’s January 4th\nletter evidence, the overwhelming weight of evidence in Post’s\nrecord did not argue in her favor.13\n\n\n    13\n      While the evidence in Post’s record indicated that she\nsuffered from chronic pain, to be eligible for benefits at that\npoint, Post had to be “prevented by Disability from doing any\noccupation or work for which [she is] or could become qualified\nby: (1) training; (2) education; or (3) experience.” JA 77\n(emphasis added). In 1994, ten months after her initial injury,\n\n                                46\n\fDr. Michael Fiore noted that Post had no lacerations, bruises,\nswelling or broken bones, diagnosed her with a “cervical\nsprain/strain,” and concluded that she was “not disabled” and\n“may participate in full activity as tolerated.” JA 196-98. In\n1996, Dr. Joel Harris examined Post and concluded that\nalthough she had severe pain in her head and neck area, she was\ncapable of doing sedentary work. JA 265. The Court notes that\nsedentary work was the “least intensive option available,” but\nnothing prevented Dr. Harris from indicating, as Dr. Britton did\non the same form, JA256, that Post was incapable of doing\nsedentary work. New Jersey’s medical examiner found that Post\n“could perform medium exertional work with limited reaching.”\nJA 46.\n        Although several of Post’s doctors tested her for “trigger\npoints” and diagnosed her with fibromyalgia, their ultimate\ndiagnoses were based on self-reported symptoms, and none of\nthe doctors ever found the requisite eleven of eighteen trigger\npoints needed to support such a diagnosis. There are several\nreferences in Post’s medical records to “trigger points,” all of\nwhich indicate that she had fewer than eleven. JA 262 (Dr.\nMulford in March 1995, finding “some trigger points in the\nsternocleidomastoid and scalenes”); JA 259 (Dr. Mulford in\nNovember 1995, finding “several trigger points in the upper\ncervical spine at the occiput and over the cervical facets”); JA\n258 (Dr. Mulford in 1996, finding “no palpable muscle spasm\nor trigger points at this time”); JA 318-19 (Dr. Kaufman in May\n2000, finding “trigger points on the right side . . . [and] Another\ntrigger point in the infraspinatous region on the left side,” but\nnone in several other places); JA 317 (Dr. Kaufman in October\n\n                                47\n\f       Fourth, the Court holds that a Hartford employee’s use of\nthe term “unsuccessful” in an internal e-mail to describe\n\n\n2000 finding two trigger points); JA 293-95.0 The “trigger\npoint” test is recognized in the case law and the medical\nliterature as a prerequisite to a diagnosis of fibromyalgia.

Admittedly, Post’s file contained the opinions of\nseveral treating physicians to the effect that she was completely\ndisabled, but it is not a fair assessment of the record to say that\nthe evidence in her favor was sufficiently overwhelming as to\nraise a legitimate inference of bad faith when Hartford’s\nadministrator disagreed with those conclusions. This is not,\ntherefore, a situation like Kosiba, where the claimant’s\n“physician’s reports uniformly supported her contentions” of\ndisability, and there was no comparable evidence supporting the\ninsurer’s contrary view at the time it ordered an examination.”\n384 F.3d at 67.\n\n\n                                48\n\fHartford’s surveillance of Post counsels heightened review. The\nonly evidence in the record on this point is one line of an\ninternal e-mail stating “Surveillance was unsuccessful as the\nclaimant was not observed leaving her home.” JA227. In the\nCourt’s view, the use of the word “unsuccessful” suggests that\nHartford’s “motive was to find evidence to deny Post’s claim.”\nI do not agree.\n\n\n\n\n        As the Court recognizes, surveillance by an insurance\ncompany is not per se suspicious. See, e.g., Delta Family-Care\nDisability & Survivorship Plan v. Marshall, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"774209\"><a href=\"/opinion/774209/delta-family-care-disability-and-survivorship-plan-v-harold-marshall/\"><span class=\"volume\">258</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">834</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 841\n(8th Cir. 2001) (“[T]here is nothing procedurally improper about\nthe use of surveillance.”); Tsoulas v.

If Post left her home\nto jog or play sports, that would certainly undermine her claim\nto disability benefits. On the other hand, if she used a\nwheelchair to move from her door to a waiting wheelchair\ntransport vehicle, or hobbled gingerly on crutches, that would\nsupport her claim to disability benefits. The only reasonable\ninference—if any inference may be drawn with confidence—is\nthat the use of the word “unsuccessful” meant that Hartford’s\nsurveilleur was unable to observe Post at all due to the fact that\nshe did not leave her home, and thus could neither confirm nor\n\n                               49\n\fdeny her disability.\n\n\n\n\n        Unlike the Court, I am unwilling to characterize\nHartford’s request for tax returns as an “aggressive tactic.” The\nPlan entitles Hartford to reduce Post’s benefits by the amount of\nincome she received from working. Contrary to the majority’s\nsuggestion, there is nothing “ambiguous” about the Plan in that\nrespect. In Hartford’s May 12 and June 19, 2000, letters to Post\nand her attorneys requesting tax returns, Hartford quoted the\nlanguage of the policy pertaining to the calculation of Post’s\nbenefits, specifically emphasizing the text that directed Hartford\nto subtract “all other income from any employer or for any\nwork.” JA 214, 219. At the time Hartford requested Post’s\nreturns, Post was collecting “total disability” benefits under the\ntheory that she was prevented from doing any work by a\ndisabling condition. In that light, it hardly seems unreasonable\nor suggestive of bad faith for Hartford to request tax returns, as\nPost’s report to the government of her employment status during\nher period of alleged total disability would be probative\nevidence of whether Post was in fact “prevented by Disability\nfrom doing any occupation or work for which [she is] or could\nbecome qualified.”\n\n\n\n\n       Finally, the Court suggests that a disagreement between\nHartford’s October 3, 2003, decision and the August 11, 1998,\ndecision of the Social Security Administration “is relevant\nthough not dispositive” of whether the former was arbitrary and\n\n                               50\n\fcapricious. Op. at 29. Suffice it to say, the administrative law\njudge in 1998 did not have the benefit of the record before\nHartford in 2003, and no review of Post’s continued eligibility\nfor social security benefits has been undertaken since 1998.

In Pinto and other cases in which courts\nhave applied heightened scrutiny to an administrator’s denial of\nbenefits in the face of a social security award, they have done so\nnot because of the mere fact of conflict with the SSA’s\ndetermination, but because there is something suspicious about\nthe manner in which the SSA decision is disregarded or\ndisagreed with. In Pinto, for example, we were concerned with\nthe fact that the administrator showed inexplicably greater\ndeference to the SSA’s determination that the claimant was not\ndisabled than to the SSA’s subsequent reversal of its initial\ndetermination. Pinto, 214 F.3d 393-94. Similarly, in Harden v.\nAm. Express Fin.

In other instances, where a plan\nrequires the beneficiary to apply for Social Security benefits and\ntakes an offset if the Social Security claim succeeds—which\nHartford does not do here because of New Jersey state\nlaw—courts have applied heightened scrutiny to ensure that the\nadministrator does not make self-servingly selective use of the\nSSA’s determinations by giving weight only to those\ndeterminations that go against the claimant.

It is clear from Pinto that such\na situation calls for a “heightened” application of the arbitrary\nand capricious standard of review.\n\n\n\n                                52\n\f         In Pinto, we adopted a “sliding scale” approach that\n“allows each case to be examined on its facts.” It teaches that\ndistrict courts “should consider the nature and degree of\napparent conflicts with a view to shaping their arbitrary and\ncapricious review of benefit determinations of discretionary\ndecisionmakers.” Pinto, 214 F.3d at 393. As Pinto expressly\nacknowledged, however, “the routine legal meaning of an\narbitrary and capricious decision is . . . a decision ‘without\nreason, unsupported by substantial evidence or erroneous as a\nmatter of law,’” and “[o]nce the conflict becomes a ‘factor’ . .\n. it is not clear how the process required by the typical arbitrary\nand capricious review changes.” Id. at 392. The standard of\nreview we ultimately adopted in Pinto was of necessity an\nimprecise one: the review is to be “more penetrating the greater\nthe suspicion of partiality, less penetrating the smaller the\nsuspicion is.” Id. at 392-93 (quoting from Wildbur v. ARCO\nChem. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"590264\"><a href=\"/opinion/590264/kenneth-e-wildbur-sr-v-arco-chemical-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">974</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">631</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Cir. 1992)). District courts, we\ninstructed, must “approximately calibrat[e] the intensity of\n[their] review to the intensity of the conflict.” Id. at 393.\n\n\n\n\n        It must be kept in mind, however, that the arbitrary and\ncapricious standard, even when heightened, remains a\ndeferential one. See Stratton v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Co.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"785664\"><a href=\"/opinion/785664/melanie-stratton-jeffrey-stratton-her-husband-v-ei-dupont-de-nemours/\"><span class=\"volume\">363</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">250</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 256 (3d Cir. 2004); Gritzer v.

The sliding scale, throughout its\nentire range, measures the deference to be afforded the decision\nof an administrator upon whom the plan has conferred discretion\nregarding benefits. Even where the conflict and/or procedural\nirregularities are most serious, this means only that the Court\n\n                                53\n\fwill “require that the record contain substantial evidence\nbordering on a preponderance to uphold [the administrator’s]\ndecision.” Woo v.

Stated conversely, if the evidence in the administrative\nrecord renders it more likely than not that the administrator’s\ndecision is correct, it necessarily follows that the decision must\nstand wherever on the arbitrary and capricious sliding scale the\ncase may fall. In short, if the decision withstands de novo\nreview, it matters not how little deference is accorded. See\nWilliams v. BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"76629\"><a href=\"/opinion/76629/marcia-williams-v-bellsouth-telecommunications/\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1132</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1139 (11th Cir. 2004) (“Because no grounds exist to disturb\nKemper’s determination under the de novo review standard, we\nneed not review it under the more deferential (‘mere’ or\n‘heightened’ arbitrary and capricious) standard.”).\n\n\n\n\n       As the Court recognizes, while Hartford’s structural\nconflict calls for “heightened” review, in the absence of\nevidence of procedural bias it does not place this case at the\nupper end of the scale. Under our case law, as the Court\nexplains, “[s]tructural conflicts of interest warrant more\nsearching review, but in the absence of evidence that bias\ninfected the particular decision at issue, we defer to an\nadministrator’s reasonable and carefully considered\nconclusions.” Op. at 21. I agree with this reading of our\njurisprudence, and because I believe no court reviewing the\nrecord before Hartford and affording its decision this kind of\ndeference, or indeed deference of any significant degree, could\nappropriately overturn that decision, I would affirm the\nsummary judgment in its favor.\n\n                               54\n\f                        III. Disposition\n\n\n\n\n        Post’s case presented difficult issues for an administrator\nto resolve. She originally suffered a “whiplash injury,” which\nDr. Fiore described as a “cervical [neck] sprain/strain.” JA 196-\n98. She had no bruises, lacerations, or broken bones, and\nmagnetic resonance imagery revealed no tears, nerve damage, or\nslipped or herniated discs. Post nevertheless complained, over\nthe next decade, of total body pain sufficiently severe to prevent\nher from any employment. Throughout that period, she was\ntreated by physicians who prescribed medications and other\ntherapy which were expected by them to alleviate this pain, but\nto no avail. Her condition did not improve. Post’s treating\nphysicians did not reach a consensus with regard to the cause of\nher pain. Several suggested psychiatric or psychological\ntherapies be undertaken, but Post declined to pursue that course.\nTwo physicians suggested Post suffered from fibromyalgia, but\ntheir records did not reflect anything approaching the clinical\nevidence necessary to support that diagnosis. While several\ntreating physicians expressed the opinion that Post was unable\nto perform any work, those opinions were based solely upon the\npatient’s report of her symptoms. No clinical or other personal\nobservations of Post were reported in support of those opinions.\n\n\n\n\n       Given this medical history, Hartford reasonably sought\ninformation to confirm or negate Post’s claims to continued\nbenefits. It did so by requesting additional information from\n\n                                55\n\fPost and her treating physicians and by seeking the counsel of\nan independent consultant, Dr. Lynch. As I have earlier noted,\nhis report indicates that his investigation was thorough and\nimpartial. Dr. Lynch addressed the conclusions of Post’s prior\ntreating physicians, contrasted those conclusions with the\nmedical records and with his own findings after a physical\nexamination, and ultimately concluded that although she was\ndisabled by some kind of pain disorder, she was not sufficiently\ndisabled as to meet the plan definition of total disability. Dr.\nLynch’s report is not unassailable, but it is reasoned, consistent\nwith the rest of Post’s medical records, persuasively establishes\nthat there is no objective evidence to support Post’s claim of\ntotal disability, and clearly provides a rational basis for\nconcluding that she is able to perform sedentary work.\n\n\n\n\n       In short, the administrative record before Hartford on\nOctober 3, 2003 provides clear and convincing support for the\nconclusion that Post had not established entitlement to\ncontinuing benefits. That conclusion of the administrator was\nreasonable and carefully considered, and I believe any reviewing\ncourt would be required by our case law to defer to it.\nAccordingly, I would affirm the District Court’s summary\njudgment in favor of Hartford.14\n\n\n  14\n    I would not remand for further proceedings. Our review of\nthe District Court’s summary judgment is plenary and, as the\nCourt recognizes, the merits decision must be made on the basis\nof the administrative record. Given that record, the District\n\n                               56\n\fCourt would have no basis on remand for doing anything other\nthan accepting Hartford’s decision. While it is not material to\nmy decision to affirm, rather than remand, I note that Post, of\ncourse, has no right to a jury review of the administrator’s\ndecision. Turner v.
