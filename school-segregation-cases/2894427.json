The complaint alleges that defendants have\nfailed to comply with procedural and substantive require-\nments of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, 20\nU.S.C. § 1400 et seq.1 The Parks expressly challenge the\naward of compensatory services and the denial of attorney’s\nfees. The district court affirmed the decisions of the Hearing\nOfficer of the California Special Education Hearing Office in\npart and modified minor details in part.\n\n\n\n\n  1\n    All references and citations to the Individuals with Disabilities Educa-\ntion Act refer to the statute as in force at the time period in dispute (2001-\n2002).\n\f4226     PARK v. ANAHEIM UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT\n   We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291 and we\naffirm.\n\n                                I\n\n   Joseph was born in 1990 with a genetic defect known as cri\ndu chat, cry of the cat, or 5p-syndrome. Deficits attributed to\nhis disability include developmental delay, deficient cognitive\nability, poor muscle tone, speech and language delay, gross\nand fine motor delay, difficulty in muscle training and coordi-\nnation, difficulty assimilating toilet training, self-care diffi-\nculty, drooling and behavioral difficulties. Joseph has below\naverage cognitive ability; his I.Q. is below 70. His family’s\nprimary language is Korean.\n\n  Joseph entered the Greater Anaheim public school district\nas a special day class student at age three. He attended Salk\nElementary School within the Magnolia Elementary School\nDistrict. A satisfactory individualized education plan was\nadopted and implemented for him. The Magnolia District\nannually reviewed the individualized education plan.\n\n   In March 2002, the Magnolia District conducted a triennial\nreview. Members of the Anaheim District participated to\nfacilitate Joseph’s anticipated transition at the end of the\nschool year. An audiology assessment was scheduled during\nthis review. An audiologist administered a HEAR Kit test as\npart of the assessment. The audiologist could not reconcile\ninconsistent results because of a buildup of cerumen (earwax)\nin the subject’s ear canal. The district informed Joseph’s\nmother that it was her obligation to remove the cerumen or\nhave it removed by a medical professional before the assess-\nment could be completed. The cerumen was not removed and\nthe assessment was never completed.\n\n   A special education consultant, qualified to administer cer-\ntain vision tests, conducted a vision assessment and found that\nJoseph’s vision was not hindering his education. The Parks\n\f          PARK v. ANAHEIM UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT      4227\nbelieve that Joseph is afflicted with double vision and optic\nnerve damage which the assessment failed to identify.\n\n   Based in part on the completed assessments, the Anaheim\nDistrict and Special Education Local Plan Area recommended\nthat Joseph be placed in a special education school for the\n2001-2002 extended school year and the 2002-2003 school\nyear. Joseph’s parents contested the recommended placement\nand had Joseph attend a summer camp during the 2001-2002\nextended school year. Joseph’s mother requested new psycho-\nlogical, occupational therapy, physical therapy and speech\nand language assessments. The requested assessments took\nplace over the summer and during the fall. There were no fur-\nther attempts to administer the audiology and vision assess-\nments.\n\n   In June 2002, the Parks requested a due process hearing\nnaming Magnolia and Anaheim Districts as respondents.2\nJoseph attended a special day class at Lexington Junior High\nSchool pursuant to a confidential mediated interim agreement.\nJoseph’s mother, along with her attorney and a translator, par-\nticipated in October and November meetings to develop an\nindividualized education plan, which the Anaheim District\nimplemented in November 2002. The District conducted a\nfunctional behavior assessment and then created a proposed\nbehavior intervention plan that it presented at a November\nindividualized education plan meeting. The behavior interven-\ntion plan was not implemented because Joseph’s mother con-\ntested the program’s suitability.\n\n   A Hearing Officer of the California Special Education\nHearing Office conducted a full hearing with both sides pre-\nsenting witnesses and evidence. The Hearing Officer found:\n(1) the District conducted appropriate assessments and tested\nJoseph in all areas of suspected disability, (2) Joseph was\ndenied a free and appropriate public education for the 2001-\n  2\n   Appellants later settled with the Magnolia District.\n\f4228     PARK v. ANAHEIM UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT\n2002 extended school year because the District failed to\nestablish that it made a clear written offer of placement at the\nHope School for that period, (3) Joseph was denied a free and\nappropriate public education from the first week of September\nthrough November 6, 2002 because the individualized educa-\ntion plan had not been implemented, (4) the proposed individ-\nualized education plan, in place as of November 6, 2002, was\nappropriate but the District needed to add self-help goals for\nbuttoning, zipping and toilet training, (5) the District must\nprovide compensatory education services to Joseph’s teachers\nfor Joseph’s benefit and (6) the District prevailed on every\nissue but provision of a free and appropriate public education\nfor extended school year 2001-2002 and September through\nNovember 2002 and compensatory services. The parties are in\nagreement on other issues.\n\n   Appellants brought suit in district court. The parties filed\ncross-motions for summary judgment and after a hearing the\ncourt entered final judgment. Appellants now challenge the\nfollowing district court determinations: (1) Joseph was not\nprejudiced by any of the alleged violations of the Individuals\nwith Disabilities Education Act’s procedural safeguards, (2)\nthe individualized education plan implemented in November\n2002 does not deny Joseph a free and appropriate public edu-\ncation, (3) compensatory education services were properly\nawarded directly to the school teachers and (4) the District is\nnot required to pay attorney’s fees to Appellants for the costs\nof the due process hearing.\n\n                               II\n\n   The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act is satisfied\nif the State complies with the Act’s procedures and an “indi-\nvidualized educational program developed through the Act’s\nprocedures [is] reasonably calculated to enable the child to\nreceive educational benefits[.]” Amanda J. ex rel. Annette J.\nv. Clark County Sch. Dist., 267 F.3d 877, 890 (9th Cir. 2001)\n\f         PARK v. ANAHEIM UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT        4229\n(quoting Bd. of Educ. of Hendrick Hudson Cent. Sch. Dist. v.\nRowley, 458 U.S. 176, 207 (1982)).\n\n   We accord the Hearing Officer’s determinations due weight\nbecause they were thorough and careful: the hearing lasted\nover eight days, the Hearing Officer was engaged in the hear-\ning and questioned the witnesses to ensure the record con-\ntained complete information and that he understood the\ntestimony. The decision entered by the Hearing Officer con-\ntains a complete factual background as well as a discrete anal-\nysis supporting the ultimate conclusions. See Seattle Sch.\nDist., No. 1 v. B.S., 82 F.3d 1493, 1499 (9th Cir. 1996).\n\n                               A\n\n   [1] Individuals with Disabilities Education Act relief is\nappropriate if procedural violations deprive Joseph of an edu-\ncational opportunity (prejudice) or seriously infringe his par-\nents’ opportunity to participate in the formulation of the\nindividualized education plan. W.G. v. Bd. of Trs. of Target\nRange Sch. Dist., No. 23, 960 F.2d 1479, 1484 (9th Cir. 1992)\n(“Target Range”). Appellants assert procedural violations\nwhich caused a denial of a free and appropriate public educa-\ntion. These include: (1) failure to undertake a medical exami-\nnation for diagnostic or evaluation purposes leading to a\ncompletion of the audiology assessment, (2) failure to address\nthe suspected vision disorder, (3) failure to consult or invite\npersons most knowledgeable about Joseph to assist in devel-\noping the individualized education plan, (4) development of\nthe behavior intervention plan without considering the views\nof the individualized education plan team or Joseph’s parents\nand (5) failure to assess Joseph using his primary language\nwhen it was feasible to do so.\n\n   [2] First, California Education Code § 56320(f) requires a\nstudent be tested in all areas related to the suspected disabil-\nity. Cal. Educ. Code § 56320(f). The District undertook an\naudiology assessment and administered a HEAR Kit test. An\n\f4230     PARK v. ANAHEIM UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT\nexcessive buildup of cerumen (earwax) prevented the\naudiologist from reconciling inconsistent results. The District\nfulfilled its duty by notifying Joseph’s mother (who was pres-\nent and later reminded) that it was her obligation to remove\nthe cerumen or have it removed by a medical professional as\na condition for test completion. There was no procedural vio-\nlation.\n\n   [3] Second, Appellants allege the vision assessment was\nflawed because the special education consultant was unquali-\nfied to assess for double vision or optic nerve damage. The\nDistrict is not required to assess double vision or optic nerve\ndamage if it does not affect a child’s educational needs. See\nCal. Educ. Code § 56320. Because the District’s consultant\nfound that Joseph’s vision was not hindering his education,\nthere was no procedural violation.\n\n   [4] Third, Appellants allege the District violated their pro-\ncedural rights and denied Joseph an educational opportunity.\nThe Appellants believe that failure to include and consider all\navailable information from people knowledgeable about\nJoseph in the development of the individualized education\nplan violated the Act. Joseph has received that to which he is\nentitled. An individualized education plan has been developed\nfor him as a result of his records, observations, assessments\nby qualified individuals and participation by his parents. See\n20 U.S.C. § 1415(b)(1); Cal. Educ. Code § 56320(g); Target\nRange, 960 F.2d at 1484; 34 C.F.R. § 300.533(a)(1). A quali-\nfied administrator conducted a thorough hearing to review the\nindividual education plan and, after considering testimony\nfrom Joseph’s mother and the child’s personal physician,\nlargely approved of the District’s proposal but supplemented\nthe plan with further goals. See 20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(1)(B)(vi).\nThere was no procedural violation.\n\n  [5] Fourth, the District did not violate the Individuals with\nDisabilities Education Act’s procedures when it conducted a\nsuitable functional behavioral assessment and subsequently\n\f           PARK v. ANAHEIM UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT                 4231\nproposed a behavior intervention plan. See 34 C.F.R.\n§ 300.346. The individualized education plan team and\nJoseph’s parents had an opportunity to discuss the plan when\nit was proposed. Joseph’s mother exercised her rights by con-\ntesting the behavior intervention plan and then challenging the\nplan through the statutory procedures. There was no proce-\ndural violation.\n\n   [6] Fifth, Appellants allege the District’s failure to assess\nJoseph in his primary language when it was feasible to do so\nwas a procedural error that caused Joseph prejudice. The Indi-\nviduals with Disabilities Education Act requires assessment\nmaterials be “provided and administered in the child’s native\nlanguage or other mode of communication, unless it is not\nfeasible to do so.” 20 U.S.C. § 1414(b)(3)(A)(ii) (emphasis\nadded); accord Cal. Educ. Code § 56320(b)(1); 34 C.F.R.\n§ 300.532; Cal. Code Regs. tit. 5, § 3023(a). Five assessments\nare at issue: speech and language, occupational therapy, phys-\nical therapy, vision and psychological. Joseph’s mother con-\nsented to the assessment plan, which specified that the speech\nand language assessment was to be conducted in English.\nThere was no procedural violation. The occupational therapy,\nphysical therapy and vision assessments were nonverbal.\nThere was no procedural violation. The psychological assess-\nment was largely nonverbal. A Korean interpreter was present\nduring the verbal portions of the assessment but direct verbal\ncues were not given in Korean. The Hearing Officer agreed\nwith the psychologist that giving Korean cues would have dis-\nturbed the validity of the test; native language administration\nwas not feasible. There was no procedural violation.3\n  3\n   Even if we disagreed with the Hearing Officer and assumed without\ndeciding that it was feasible (i.e., not detrimental to the assessment’s\nvalidity) to give verbal cues in Korean, this limited portion of the psycho-\nlogical assessment would be the only evidence of procedural error. Such\na procedural violation entitles Joseph to relief only if Appellants show it\ncaused Joseph prejudice. See Target Range, 960 F.2d at 1484. Appellants\noffer no evidence that Joseph did not understand the cues given. There is\nno evidence that the results of the psychological assessment caused Joseph\nto be denied a suitable educational opportunity.\n\f4232     PARK v. ANAHEIM UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT\n                               B\n\n   [7] Joseph has received a free and appropriate education if\nhis instruction (1) addresses his unique needs, (2) provides\nadequate support services so he can take advantage of the\neducational opportunities and (3) is in accord with the indi-\nvidualized education program. Capistrano Unified Sch. Dist.\nv. Wartenberg ex rel. Wartenberg, 59 F.3d 884, 893 (9th Cir.\n1995) (citing Rowley, 458 U.S. at 188-89). The parties do not\ndispute Joseph’s needs or that the instruction is in accord with\nthe individualized education plan that has been developed for\nJoseph. Appellants contend that the District failed to provide\nadequate support services to allow Joseph to meet the pro-\nposed educational goals. The Hearing Officer carefully con-\nsidered testimony by the District and Appellants on the issue\nof related services. Though Appellants’ witnesses testified\nthat related therapy services could benefit Joseph, the District\npresented evidence that such services were not necessary for\nJoseph to reach the individualized education plan goals. The\nHearing Officer’s decision partially discredited Appellants’\nwitnesses for using unreliable or invalid methods of testing.\nThe Hearing Officer also agreed with the District that Joseph\ncould achieve the goals of the individualized education plan\nthrough alternative communications, ongoing practice at\nhome with his mother and ongoing adaptive physical educa-\ntion. Because we accord the Hearing Officer’s findings due\nweight and the evidence does not conclusively demonstrate\nrelated therapy services are necessary to ensure Joseph\nreceives “some educational benefit,” we agree that there was\nno substantive violation of the Individuals with Disabilities\nEducation Act. Rowley, 458 U.S. at 198-201.\n\n                              III\n\n   [8] Compensatory education services can be awarded as\nappropriate equitable relief. 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(2)(B)(iii)\n(“shall grant such relief as the court determines appropriate”);\nParents of Student W. v. Puyallup Sch. Dist., 31 F.3d 1489,\n\f         PARK v. ANAHEIM UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT        4233\n1496-97 (9th Cir. 1994). “Appropriate relief is relief designed\nto ensure the student is appropriately educated within the\nmeaning of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.”\nParents of Student W., 31 F.3d at 1497. The courts have dis-\ncretion on how to craft the relief and “[t]here is no obligation\nto provide a day-for-day compensation for time missed.” Id.\nWe review the Hearing Officer’s and the district court’s\naward of compensatory education services for abuse of discre-\ntion. Id. at 1496.\n\n   After balancing the parties’ conduct, the Hearing Officer\nconcluded that while it was appropriate for Joseph to receive\ncompensatory education it would be speculative to award ser-\nvices directly to Joseph. The testimony was unclear whether\nJoseph would benefit from direct compensatory education.\nThe Hearing Officer decided to direct that the services be\nmade available to Joseph’s special education teacher in the\namount of thirty minutes per week for the remainder of the\n2002-2003 school year and to his Anaheim Union High\nSchool District teacher for the 2002-2003 extended school\nyear. The Hearing Officer ordered that the services address\nthe implementation of the individualized education plan’s\nself-help goals and objectives. The district court affirmed the\nrelief as ordered for Joseph’s unique needs and the District’s\nconduct.\n\n   [9] The award was designed to compensate Joseph for the\nDistrict’s violations by better training his teachers to meet\nJoseph’s particular needs. The Individuals with Disabilities\nEducation Act does not require compensatory education ser-\nvices to be awarded directly to the student. The Hearing Offi-\ncer and the district court did not abuse their discretion when\nthey awarded compensatory education services to Joseph in\nthe form of individualized instruction for Joseph’s teachers\nthat addressed the implementation of the individualized edu-\ncation plan’s self-help goals and objectives.\n\f4234     PARK v. ANAHEIM UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT\n                               IV\n\n   [10] “[T]he court, in its discretion, may award reasonable\nattorneys’ fees as part of the costs to the parents of a child\nwith a disability who is the prevailing party.” 20 U.S.C.\n§ 1415(i)(3)(B). Because the determination on an award of\nattorney’s fees is solely with the district court, we review for\nabuse of discretion. Shapiro ex rel. Shapiro v. Paradise Valley\nUnified Sch. Dist., 374 F.3d 857, 861 (9th Cir. 2004).\n\n   [11] The district court did not abuse its discretion by find-\ning that the District prevailed on “all significant issues” and\nthe Appellants prevailed only “on some minor issues.”\nThough Appellants obtained some relief (a finding of denial\nof a free and appropriate public education for one extended\nschool year and one period of less than three months, limited\ncompensatory services awarded directly to the teachers, sup-\nplemented self-help goals and requiring the District to con-\nduct a new functional behavior assessment and implement a\nbehavior intervention plan), the District prevailed on all pro-\ncedural violations issues and the larger substantive free and\nappropriate public education issue (the proposed individual-\nized education plan of November 2002). The district court did\nnot abuse its discretion by determining the Appellants’ relief\nwas de minimis. See Shapiro, 374 F.3d at 865 (citing Parents\nof Student W., 31 F.3d at 1498). Though the district court\nmight have been within its discretion to award Appellants\nattorney’s fees, we cannot say the district court abused its dis-\ncretion in not awarding fees.\n\n  AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\nWARDLAW, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting\nin part:\n\n   I respectfully dissent from the majority’s conclusions that\n(1) Park prevailed only on “minor” issues, and (2) the district\n\f         PARK v. ANAHEIM UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT          4235\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in denying his attorney’s\nfees. The district court’s determination that Park was not the\nprevailing party was an abuse of discretion. See Shapiro v.\nParadise Valley Unified Sch. Dist. No. 69, 374 F.3d 857, 865\n(9th Cir. 2004). The majority mischaracterizes the issues on\nwhich Park prevailed as “minor” or “de minimis,” even while\nconceding that “the district court might have been within its\ndiscretion to award [Joseph] attorney’s fees.” Given the very\nnarrow discretion a district court has to deny fees in claims\nbrought under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act\n(IDEA), the majority opinion ignores not only the letter of the\nlaw, but also the spirit and purpose of allowing attorney’s fees\nin cases where parents have been forced to litigate for years\nagainst school districts to get all or part of what the IDEA\nrequires in the first place.\n\n                                I.\n\n   When Joseph Park was three years old, he was diagnosed\nwith a rare genetic defect known as 5p-syndrome (also known\nas Cri du Chat syndrome), which is caused by a deletion on\nchromosome 5. At that time, according to Joseph’s father,\nJoseph was able to speak only two words, and he was not yet\nwalking. As a result of this disorder, Joseph has low muscle\ntone, suffers from speech and language delays and gross and\nfine motors skills delays, has difficulty in muscle training and\ncoordination, and has deficient cognitive ability, limited ver-\nbal ability, and behavioral difficulties. Joseph has difficulty\ntoilet training, is unable to control his drooling, and has diffi-\nculties buttoning and zipping his clothing and tying his shoes\non his own.\n\n   Joseph attended elementary school within a special day\nclass at the mainstream elementary school in the Magnolia\nDistrict from the time he was three until June 2002, when he\nwas twelve. In the spring of 2002, the Magnolia District con-\nducted a triennial assessment of Joseph. The District con-\ncluded that for the 2001-2002 extended school year (ESY)\n\f4236     PARK v. ANAHEIM UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT\nand the 2002-2003 school year, Joseph should be placed in\nthe Hope School, a special education school on a small cam-\npus that is separated from the other local schools. Joseph’s\nmother had concerns about the District’s assessment of\nJoseph, and after visiting the Hope School in May 2002, she\ndecided that Hope was not appropriate for Joseph. In June\n2002, Joseph’s mother exercised her right to request a due\nprocess hearing before the California Special Education Hear-\ning Office. Because Joseph’s mother did not agree with the\nplacement in the restrictive Hope School, Joseph spent that\nsummer at a church-operated summer camp program. During\nthis time, Joseph’s mother also arranged for Joseph to be eval-\nuated by an independent speech-language therapist and an\noccupational therapist. In August 2002, the Anaheim District\nentered into a mediated interim agreement with Joseph. Pur-\nsuant to the agreement, Joseph was enrolled in a special day\nclass for disabled children at the Lexington Junior High\nSchool, and the District formulated a plan for assessments of\nJoseph. The District’s assessments of Joseph took place dur-\ning September and October 2002 (and formed the basis for\nsome of the claims Joseph Park presented before us). In\nNovember 2002, the District again concluded that the Hope\nSchool was an appropriate placement for Joseph, and it for-\nmulated Joseph’s full educational plan and goals.\n\n   The due process hearing commenced later that month. The\nHearing Officer rendered his decision four months later, in\nMarch 2003, determining that because it was not the least\nrestrictive environment available, the Hope School was\nindeed not an appropriate placement for Joseph, as Joseph’s\nmother had determined almost one year earlier, and holding\nthat the District was required to supplement Joseph’s self-help\ngoals and objectives. Joseph’s mother then exercised her right\nto pursue a civil action. In February 2004, the district court\nordered the District to comply with the Hearing Officer’s\norder. As a result, the District was required to formulate new\ngoals and objectives for Joseph, to compensate Joseph’s spe-\ncial education teacher for providing weekly occupational ther-\n\f         PARK v. ANAHEIM UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT         4237\napy consultative services to Joseph, to undertake a new\nfunctional behavior assessment of Joseph, and to develop a\nbehavior intervention plan for Joseph. Because of Joseph’s\nmother’s efforts in advocating for her son, Joseph obtained\nplacement in a special day class at Lexington Junior High\nSchool. Instead of being cloistered in a segregated special\neducation school, as the District had deemed acceptable,\nJoseph was able to attend a mainstream school and integrate\ninto society as best he can, as is required by the IDEA. At the\ntime of the due process hearing, Joseph was twelve years old.\nHe is now sixteen and still fighting to obtain what is under the\nIDEA his statutory right.\n\n                               II.\n\n   The IDEA is the primary federal legislation that supports\nspecial education and related services for children with dis-\nabilities. The IDEA is premised on the notion that\n“[i]mproving educational results for children with disabilities\nis an essential element of our national policy of ensuring\nequality of opportunity, full participation, independent living,\nand economic self-sufficiency for individuals with disabili-\nties.” 20 U.S.C. § 1400(c)(1). With that principle guiding the\nlegislation, the IDEA seeks to “ensure that all children with\ndisabilities have available to them a free appropriate public\neducation that emphasizes special education and related ser-\nvices designed to meet their unique needs and prepare them\nfor further education, employment, and independent living”;\n“to ensure that the rights of children with disabilities and par-\nents of such children are protected”; and “to assist States,\nlocalities, educational service agencies, and Federal agencies\nto provide for the education of all children with disabilities.”\nId. § 1400(d)(1).\n\n   Federal funding for state and local educational agencies\nunder the IDEA is conditioned on the requirement that states\nprovide a free appropriate public education (FAPE) to each\ndisabled child. 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a). When Congress enacted\n\f4238     PARK v. ANAHEIM UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT\nthe IDEA’s predecessor, the Education for the Handicapped\nAct, in 1975, it authorized the federal government to pay up\nto 40% of the “excess” cost of educating a child with\ndisabilities—the difference between the cost of educating a\nchild with disabilities and the cost of educating a child with-\nout disabilities. See Congressional Research Service, Individ-\nuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA): Current Funding\nTrends, Feb. 11, 2005, at 8, available at http://digital.library.\nunt.edu/govdocs/crs//data/2005/upl-meta-crs-6209/RL32085_\n2005Feb11.pdf?PHPSESSID=a8756a35fe20505c3d9cd827\nb6100443. Despite the authorization, however, federal fund-\ning has never matched the 40% goal. In FY 1995, Congress\nappropriated only $2,322,915,000 to states for education of\nschool-aged with disabilities—only 7.80% of estimated\nexcess cost. Id. at 9. Had Congress appropriated the amount\nit aspired to, the eligible states would have received\n$11,872,137,000. In FY 2002, at the time Joseph’s struggle to\nobtain an appropriate education began, Congress appropriated\n$7,512,533,000, some 15.45% of excess cost, rather than\n$19,446,407,000, which would have totaled 40% of excess\ncost. While the percentage of excess cost that the federal gov-\nernment has provided to eligible states has continually\nincreased throughout the years, appropriations still do not\nreach even 20% of increased cost despite numerous congres-\nsional pleas for “full funding” of the 40% goal. See id.; see\nalso IDEA Full Funding Act, S. 2185, 109th Cong. (2006);\nMandatory IDEA Full Funding Compromise Act, H.R. 3145,\n109th Cong. (2005); Mandatory IDEA Full Funding Compro-\nmise Act, H.R. 3802, 108th Cong. (2004); IDEA Full-\nFunding Act of 2003, S. 939, 108th Cong. (2003); Full Fund-\ning for IDEA Now Act of 2003, H.R. 823, 108th Cong.\n(2003); Helping Children Succeed by Fully Funding the Indi-\nviduals with Disability Education Act (IDEA), S. 466, 107th\nCong. (2001); IDEA Full Funding Act of 2000, S. 2341,\n106th Cong. (2000).\n\n  Given the failure to reach the goals set out when the IDEA\nand its predecessor were enacted, it is no surprise that states\n\f         PARK v. ANAHEIM UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT        4239\nand local school districts appear reluctant to provide truly\nappropriate public education for children with disabilities. At\nthe time of the initiation of this action, school districts were\nbeing forced to pay for more than 85% of the cost of educat-\ning children with disabilities. At a time when general educa-\ntion in most school districts is increasingly underfunded,\nshouldering the burden of costly evaluations and education\nprograms for disabled children grows more difficult every\nyear. But the failure of Congress to reach 40% funding does\nnot give states and school districts license to deny disabled\nchildren the education to which they are entitled. Under the\nIDEA, states receiving federal funding are required to provide\nevery disabled child a free public education that is appropriate\nfor the child’s needs, no matter how inadequate that federal\nfunding may be. That the districts are strapped for cash does\nnot entitle them to skimp on an individual’s education. Nor\nshould it suggest to courts that they can decline to award\nattorney’s fees in cases such as this where the parents of dis-\nabled children clearly prevail on significant issues.\n\n                              III.\n\n   For the purpose of attorney’s fees awards, a prevailing\nparty is defined as “a party which ‘succeed[s] on any signifi-\ncant issue in litigation which achieves some of the benefit the\nparties sought in bringing the suit.’ ” Parents of Student W. v.\nPuyallup Sch. Dist., No. 3, 31 F.3d 1489, 1498 (9th Cir. 1994)\n(alteration in original) (emphasis added) (quoting Hensley v.\nEckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 433 (1988)). Park succeeded on sev-\neral issues and achieved much of the benefit he sought in\nexercising his rights to a due process hearing and to bring a\ncivil suit. The Hearing Officer determined, and the district\ncourt affirmed, that the District had denied Joseph a FAPE for\nthe 2001-2002 extended school year (ESY) and for September\n2002 through November 2002. To remedy the denial of a\nFAPE, the Hearing Officer required the District to provide\ncompensatory education, which was awarded to Joseph in the\nform of services provided by his classroom teacher for thirty\n\f4240     PARK v. ANAHEIM UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT\nminutes per week for the remainder of the 2002-2003 school\nyear and ESY, relief which the district court affirmed. In addi-\ntion, the Hearing Officer found that although the goals and\nobjectives the District formulated were generally appropriate\nfor Joseph, the District needed to supplement the proposed\nIEP for Joseph that was in place beginning in November 2002\nby adding self-help goals for buttoning, zipping, and toilet\ntraining. Finally, the Hearing Officer agreed with Joseph’s\ncontention that the District had failed to offer Joseph an\nappropriate program at the Hope School and that the Hope\nSchool was not Joseph’s “least restrictive environment.” See\n20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(5)(A) (conditioning state eligibility for\nfederal funding on requirement that states educate disabled\nchildren with nondisabled children and remove disabled chil-\ndren “from the regular educational environment . . . only\nwhen the nature or severity of the disability of a child is such\nthat education in regular classes with the use of supplemen-\ntary aids and services cannot be achieved satisfactorily”).\nAccordingly, the Hearing Officer called for implementation of\na new functional behavior assessment (FBA) and behavioral\nintervention plan (BIP).\n\n   Park’s successes cannot be regarded as insufficient to ren-\nder Park a “prevailing party,” even acknowledging that the\nDistrict also prevailed on some issues. A party is “prevailing”\nwhere it can “point to a resolution of the dispute which\nchanges the legal relationship between itself and the defen-\ndant.” Texas State Teachers Ass’n v. Garland Indep. Sch.\nDist., 489 U.S. 782, 792 (1989), quoted in Kletzelman v.\nCapistrano Unified Sch. Dist., 91 F.3d 68, 71 (9th Cir. 1996);\nsee also Texas State Teachers Ass’n, 489 U.S. at 792-93\n(“The touchstone of the prevailing party inquiry must be the\nmaterial alteration of the legal relationship of the parties.”).\nPark’s successes satisfy this standard. As a result of Park’s\nclaim, the District was obligated to provide for consultative\nservices by Joseph’s special education teacher, to formulate\nself-help goals, to undertake an FBA, and to implement a new\nBIP. Park’s litigation successes resulted in a significant\n\f          PARK v. ANAHEIM UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT                 4241\nchange in the District’s legal obligations toward Park, which\nrenders Park a prevailing party.\n\n   That Park failed to prevail on all of his claims does not pre-\nclude a determination that he was the prevailing party. A pre-\nvailing party need not succeed on all issues, but only on\n“ ‘any significant issue.’ ” Parents of Student W., 31 F.3d at\n1498 (emphasis added) (quoting Hensley, 461 U.S. at 433).\nMoreover, a prevailing party need not achieve all of the relief\nclaimed, but merely “some of the benefit the parties sought in\nbringing the suit.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted); see\nalso Shapiro, 374 F.3d at 865 (“[I]t is also true that a party\nmay be accorded prevailing party status by being awarded\n‘some relief by the court,’ ” (quoting Buckhannon Bd. & Care\nHome, Inc. v. W. Va. Dep’t of Health & Human Res., 532\nU.S. 598, 603-04 (2001))); Me. Sch. Admin. Dist. No. 35 v.\nMr. & Mrs. R., 321 F.3d 9, 15 (1st Cir. 2003) (noting that a\nprevailing party must “succeed on the merits of a claim or\ndefense,” but that “a party may be considered ‘prevailing’\neven without obtaining a favorable final judgment on all (or\neven the most crucial) of her claims”), quoted in Shapiro, 374\nF.3d at 865. Here, Park has clearly prevailed in obtaining\nsome of the relief he sought.\n\n   Moreover, a prevailing party need not prevail on what may\nbe considered the “central” issue of the case. In Texas State\nTeachers Ass’n, the Supreme Court found that the teachers’\nunion was the prevailing party in its § 1983 claim challenging\na school board policy, even though the union had not been\ngranted relief on what was identified by a divided panel of the\nFifth Circuit Court of Appeals as the “main thrust” of the action.1\n489 U.S. at 787 (internal quotation marks omitted). Rejecting\nthe “central issue” test for determining prevailing party status,\nthe Court held that a party could be deemed “prevailing” even\n  1\n    While Texas State Teachers Ass’n is a § 1983 case deciding a motion\nfor attorney’s fees under § 1988, the Ninth Circuit has adopted its reason-\ning and result in IDEA cases. See, e.g., Kletzelman, 91 F.3d at 71.\n\f4242     PARK v. ANAHEIM UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT\ndespite failure on a “central” issue as long as the party had\nprevailed on “any significant issue in litigation which\nachieve[d] some of the benefit the parties sought in bringing\nsuit.” Id. at 792-93 (alteration in original) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). The Court noted that distinguishing between\nsuccess on primary and secondary issues, or on central and\ntangential issues, is “essentially unhelpful” in defining a pre-\nvailing party. Thus, whether Park’s successes are on “central”\nor “primary” issues is irrelevant; the only salient question is\nwhether the claims on which he prevailed are significant.\n\n   Of course, despite the general rule that the degree of suc-\ncess does not bear on the threshold question of eligibility for\nan attorney’s fees award, the Ninth Circuit has held that if\nsuccess is insignificant, then a court may find that a party that\nsucceeds on some claims is nonetheless not a prevailing party.\nSpecifically, attorney’s fees may be properly denied “[w]here\nthe plaintiff’s success on a legal claim can be characterized as\npurely technical or de minimis.” Kletzelman, 91 F.3d at 71\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Here, however, Park’s\nsuccesses materially altered the education he receives.\nBecause he chose to exercise his rights under the IDEA, the\nDistrict was forced to reassess the objectives and plan for\nJoseph Park’s education and to provide for compensatory edu-\ncation to remedy its failure to provide a FAPE during several\nmonths of his education.\n\n   The issues on which Joseph prevailed are not technical or\nde minimis, as the majority would have it; rather, they go to\nthe very essence of the IDEA. The determination by the Hear-\ning Officer and the district court that Joseph was denied a\nFAPE the 2001-2002 ESY and for September 2002 through\nNovember 2002—even setting aside the other issues on which\nJoseph prevailed—is the most significant of successes possi-\nble under the IDEA. At the heart of the Act is the requirement\nthat each disabled child receive a free appropriate public edu-\ncation that is tailored to his or her unique individual needs,\nsee 20 U.S.C. § 1400(d)(1)(A), and the necessity of providing\n\f         PARK v. ANAHEIM UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT          4243\neducation that is effective in “ensuring equality of opportu-\nnity, full participation, independent living, and economic self-\nsufficiency for individuals with disabilities,” see id.\n§ 1400(c)(1), (d)(4). It is impossible to reconcile the majori-\nty’s conclusion that Joseph’s success was “minor” with the\ngoals and statutory framework of the IDEA.\n\n   The majority’s decision to affirm the district court’s denial\nof fees, even though Joseph succeeded in proving that the\nDistrict denied him a FAPE and has obtained significant\nrelief, offers only discouragement to families with disabled\nchildren. Denial of attorney’s fees chills the exercise of their\nrights to pursue due process hearings and civil actions on sim-\nilarly meritorious claims. It only encourages school districts\nto spend their resources fighting families who wish to vindi-\ncate their rights under the IDEA, rather than spending these\nresources where they should be spent—on providing public\neducation to the disabled. Fee awards are generally the only\nmechanism through which disabled litigants with limited\nresources are able to vindicate their rights under the IDEA.\nThe ability of plaintiffs to recover fees when they prove they\nhave been denied their rights under the IDEA is central to the\nstatutory framework of the Act. The fee provision of the\nIDEA, which originated in Congress’s enactment of the\nHandicapped Children’s Protection Act to overrule the\nSupreme Court holding in Smith v. Robinson, 468 U.S. 992\n(1984), that the Education for the Handicapped Act (the\nIDEA’s predecessor) did not allow attorney’s fees for prevail-\ning parties, allows plaintiffs to act as private attorneys general\nto exercise their rights. This is precisely why “[a] district\ncourt’s discretion to deny a request for attorneys’ fees is nar-\nrow.” Kletzelman, 91 F.3d at 70 (citing Abu-Sahyun v. Palo\nAlto Unified Sch. Dist., 843 F.2d 1250, 1252 (9th Cir. 1988)).\nIf a district court’s discretion to deny requests for attorneys’\nfees were not so narrow, attorneys would be loath to take on\nany IDEA claim in which the client may be unable to pay for\nrepresentation. Joseph had a valid claim, which the Hearing\nOfficer recognized, and for which the district court affirmed\n\f4244     PARK v. ANAHEIM UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT\nJoseph merited relief. Lawyers will only bring these cases if\nthey know that they will be compensated when they prevail.\nThe majority’s decision to affirm the denial of attorney’s fees\nto a party which clearly prevailed on significant issues,\ndespite the majority’s own acknowledgment that fees “might\nhave been” within the discretion of the district court, will\nserve not only to deny Joseph Park the relief he deserves, but\nalso to encourage school districts to violate the IDEA, while\nfurther discouraging families of disabled children from fight-\ning for their rights under the IDEA.\n\f",

The complaint alleges that defendants have\nfailed to comply with procedural and substantive require-\nments of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, 20\nU.S.C. § 1400 et seq.1 The Parks expressly challenge the\naward of compensatory services and the denial of attorney’s\nfees. The district court affirmed the decisions of the Hearing\nOfficer of the California Special Education Hearing Office in\npart and modified minor details in part.\n\n\n\n\n  1\n    All references and citations to the Individuals with Disabilities Educa-\ntion Act refer to the statute as in force at the time period in dispute (2001-\n2002).\n\f4226     PARK v. ANAHEIM UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT\n   We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291 and we\naffirm.\n\n                                I\n\n   Joseph was born in 1990 with a genetic defect known as cri\ndu chat, cry of the cat, or 5p-syndrome. Deficits attributed to\nhis disability include developmental delay, deficient cognitive\nability, poor muscle tone, speech and language delay, gross\nand fine motor delay, difficulty in muscle training and coordi-\nnation, difficulty assimilating toilet training, self-care diffi-\nculty, drooling and behavioral difficulties. Joseph has below\naverage cognitive ability; his I.Q. is below 70. His family’s\nprimary language is Korean.\n\n  Joseph entered the Greater Anaheim public school district\nas a special day class student at age three. He attended Salk\nElementary School within the Magnolia Elementary School\nDistrict. A satisfactory individualized education plan was\nadopted and implemented for him. The Magnolia District\nannually reviewed the individualized education plan.\n\n   In March 2002, the Magnolia District conducted a triennial\nreview. Members of the Anaheim District participated to\nfacilitate Joseph’s anticipated transition at the end of the\nschool year. An audiology assessment was scheduled during\nthis review. An audiologist administered a HEAR Kit test as\npart of the assessment. The audiologist could not reconcile\ninconsistent results because of a buildup of cerumen (earwax)\nin the subject’s ear canal. The district informed Joseph’s\nmother that it was her obligation to remove the cerumen or\nhave it removed by a medical professional before the assess-\nment could be completed. The cerumen was not removed and\nthe assessment was never completed.\n\n   A special education consultant, qualified to administer cer-\ntain vision tests, conducted a vision assessment and found that\nJoseph’s vision was not hindering his education. The Parks\n\f          PARK v. ANAHEIM UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT      4227\nbelieve that Joseph is afflicted with double vision and optic\nnerve damage which the assessment failed to identify.\n\n   Based in part on the completed assessments, the Anaheim\nDistrict and Special Education Local Plan Area recommended\nthat Joseph be placed in a special education school for the\n2001-2002 extended school year and the 2002-2003 school\nyear. Joseph’s parents contested the recommended placement\nand had Joseph attend a summer camp during the 2001-2002\nextended school year. Joseph’s mother requested new psycho-\nlogical, occupational therapy, physical therapy and speech\nand language assessments. The requested assessments took\nplace over the summer and during the fall. There were no fur-\nther attempts to administer the audiology and vision assess-\nments.\n\n   In June 2002, the Parks requested a due process hearing\nnaming Magnolia and Anaheim Districts as respondents.2\nJoseph attended a special day class at Lexington Junior High\nSchool pursuant to a confidential mediated interim agreement.\nJoseph’s mother, along with her attorney and a translator, par-\nticipated in October and November meetings to develop an\nindividualized education plan, which the Anaheim District\nimplemented in November 2002. The District conducted a\nfunctional behavior assessment and then created a proposed\nbehavior intervention plan that it presented at a November\nindividualized education plan meeting. The behavior interven-\ntion plan was not implemented because Joseph’s mother con-\ntested the program’s suitability.\n\n   A Hearing Officer of the California Special Education\nHearing Office conducted a full hearing with both sides pre-\nsenting witnesses and evidence. The Hearing Officer found:\n(1) the District conducted appropriate assessments and tested\nJoseph in all areas of suspected disability, (2) Joseph was\ndenied a free and appropriate public education for the 2001-\n  2\n   Appellants later settled with the Magnolia District.\n\f4228     PARK v. ANAHEIM UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT\n2002 extended school year because the District failed to\nestablish that it made a clear written offer of placement at the\nHope School for that period, (3) Joseph was denied a free and\nappropriate public education from the first week of September\nthrough November 6, 2002 because the individualized educa-\ntion plan had not been implemented, (4) the proposed individ-\nualized education plan, in place as of November 6, 2002, was\nappropriate but the District needed to add self-help goals for\nbuttoning, zipping and toilet training, (5) the District must\nprovide compensatory education services to Joseph’s teachers\nfor Joseph’s benefit and (6) the District prevailed on every\nissue but provision of a free and appropriate public education\nfor extended school year 2001-2002 and September through\nNovember 2002 and compensatory services. The parties are in\nagreement on other issues.\n\n   Appellants brought suit in district court. The parties filed\ncross-motions for summary judgment and after a hearing the\ncourt entered final judgment. Appellants now challenge the\nfollowing district court determinations: (1) Joseph was not\nprejudiced by any of the alleged violations of the Individuals\nwith Disabilities Education Act’s procedural safeguards, (2)\nthe individualized education plan implemented in November\n2002 does not deny Joseph a free and appropriate public edu-\ncation, (3) compensatory education services were properly\nawarded directly to the school teachers and (4) the District is\nnot required to pay attorney’s fees to Appellants for the costs\nof the due process hearing.\n\n                               II\n\n   The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act is satisfied\nif the State complies with the Act’s procedures and an “indi-\nvidualized educational program developed through the Act’s\nprocedures [is] reasonably calculated to enable the child to\nreceive educational benefits[.]” Amanda J. ex rel.

Cal. Educ. Code § 56320(f). The District undertook an\naudiology assessment and administered a HEAR Kit test. An\n\f4230     PARK v. ANAHEIM UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT\nexcessive buildup of cerumen (earwax) prevented the\naudiologist from reconciling inconsistent results. The District\nfulfilled its duty by notifying Joseph’s mother (who was pres-\nent and later reminded) that it was her obligation to remove\nthe cerumen or have it removed by a medical professional as\na condition for test completion. There was no procedural vio-\nlation.\n\n   [3] Second, Appellants allege the vision assessment was\nflawed because the special education consultant was unquali-\nfied to assess for double vision or optic nerve damage. The\nDistrict is not required to assess double vision or optic nerve\ndamage if it does not affect a child’s educational needs. See\nCal. Educ. Code § 56320. Because the District’s consultant\nfound that Joseph’s vision was not hindering his education,\nthere was no procedural violation.\n\n   [4] Third, Appellants allege the District violated their pro-\ncedural rights and denied Joseph an educational opportunity.\nThe Appellants believe that failure to include and consider all\navailable information from people knowledgeable about\nJoseph in the development of the individualized education\nplan violated the Act. Joseph has received that to which he is\nentitled. An individualized education plan has been developed\nfor him as a result of his records, observations, assessments\nby qualified individuals and participation by his parents. See\n20 U.S.C. § 1415(b)(1); Cal. Educ. Code § 56320(g); Target\nRange, 960 F.2d at 1484; 34 C.F.R. § 300.533(a)(1). A quali-\nfied administrator conducted a thorough hearing to review the\nindividual education plan and, after considering testimony\nfrom Joseph’s mother and the child’s personal physician,\nlargely approved of the District’s proposal but supplemented\nthe plan with further goals. See 20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(1)(B)(vi).\nThere was no procedural violation.\n\n  [5] Fourth, the District did not violate the Individuals with\nDisabilities Education Act’s procedures when it conducted a\nsuitable functional behavioral assessment and subsequently\n\f           PARK v. ANAHEIM UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT                 4231\nproposed a behavior intervention plan. See 34 C.F.R.\n§ 300.346. The individualized education plan team and\nJoseph’s parents had an opportunity to discuss the plan when\nit was proposed. Joseph’s mother exercised her rights by con-\ntesting the behavior intervention plan and then challenging the\nplan through the statutory procedures. There was no proce-\ndural violation.\n\n   [6] Fifth, Appellants allege the District’s failure to assess\nJoseph in his primary language when it was feasible to do so\nwas a procedural error that caused Joseph prejudice. The Indi-\nviduals with Disabilities Education Act requires assessment\nmaterials be “provided and administered in the child’s native\nlanguage or other mode of communication, unless it is not\nfeasible to do so.” 20 U.S.C. § 1414(b)(3)(A)(ii) (emphasis\nadded); accord Cal. Educ. Code § 56320(b)(1); 34 C.F.R.\n§ 300.532; Cal. Code Regs. tit. 5, § 3023(a). Five assessments\nare at issue: speech and language, occupational therapy, phys-\nical therapy, vision and psychological. Joseph’s mother con-\nsented to the assessment plan, which specified that the speech\nand language assessment was to be conducted in English.\nThere was no procedural violation. The occupational therapy,\nphysical therapy and vision assessments were nonverbal.\nThere was no procedural violation. The psychological assess-\nment was largely nonverbal. A Korean interpreter was present\nduring the verbal portions of the assessment but direct verbal\ncues were not given in Korean. The Hearing Officer agreed\nwith the psychologist that giving Korean cues would have dis-\nturbed the validity of the test; native language administration\nwas not feasible. There was no procedural violation.3\n  3\n   Even if we disagreed with the Hearing Officer and assumed without\ndeciding that it was feasible (i.e., not detrimental to the assessment’s\nvalidity) to give verbal cues in Korean, this limited portion of the psycho-\nlogical assessment would be the only evidence of procedural error. Such\na procedural violation entitles Joseph to relief only if Appellants show it\ncaused Joseph prejudice. See Target Range, 960 F.2d at 1484. Appellants\noffer no evidence that Joseph did not understand the cues given. There is\nno evidence that the results of the psychological assessment caused Joseph\nto be denied a suitable educational opportunity.\n\f4232     PARK v.

Appellants contend that the District failed to provide\nadequate support services to allow Joseph to meet the pro-\nposed educational goals. The Hearing Officer carefully con-\nsidered testimony by the District and Appellants on the issue\nof related services. Though Appellants’ witnesses testified\nthat related therapy services could benefit Joseph, the District\npresented evidence that such services were not necessary for\nJoseph to reach the individualized education plan goals. The\nHearing Officer’s decision partially discredited Appellants’\nwitnesses for using unreliable or invalid methods of testing.\nThe Hearing Officer also agreed with the District that Joseph\ncould achieve the goals of the individualized education plan\nthrough alternative communications, ongoing practice at\nhome with his mother and ongoing adaptive physical educa-\ntion. Because we accord the Hearing Officer’s findings due\nweight and the evidence does not conclusively demonstrate\nrelated therapy services are necessary to ensure Joseph\nreceives “some educational benefit,” we agree that there was\nno substantive violation of the Individuals with Disabilities\nEducation Act.

Id. at 1496.\n\n   After balancing the parties’ conduct, the Hearing Officer\nconcluded that while it was appropriate for Joseph to receive\ncompensatory education it would be speculative to award ser-\nvices directly to Joseph. The testimony was unclear whether\nJoseph would benefit from direct compensatory education.\nThe Hearing Officer decided to direct that the services be\nmade available to Joseph’s special education teacher in the\namount of thirty minutes per week for the remainder of the\n2002-2003 school year and to his Anaheim Union High\nSchool District teacher for the 2002-2003 extended school\nyear.

The district court affirmed the\nrelief as ordered for Joseph’s unique needs and the District’s\nconduct.\n\n   [9] The award was designed to compensate Joseph for the\nDistrict’s violations by better training his teachers to meet\nJoseph’s particular needs. The Individuals with Disabilities\nEducation Act does not require compensatory education ser-\nvices to be awarded directly to the student.

The majority mischaracterizes the issues on\nwhich Park prevailed as “minor” or “de minimis,” even while\nconceding that “the district court might have been within its\ndiscretion to award [Joseph] attorney’s fees.” Given the very\nnarrow discretion a district court has to deny fees in claims\nbrought under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act\n(IDEA), the majority opinion ignores not only the letter of the\nlaw, but also the spirit and purpose of allowing attorney’s fees\nin cases where parents have been forced to litigate for years\nagainst school districts to get all or part of what the IDEA\nrequires in the first place.\n\n                                I.\n\n   When Joseph Park was three years old, he was diagnosed\nwith a rare genetic defect known as 5p-syndrome (also known\nas Cri du Chat syndrome), which is caused by a deletion on\nchromosome 5. At that time, according to Joseph’s father,\nJoseph was able to speak only two words, and he was not yet\nwalking. As a result of this disorder, Joseph has low muscle\ntone, suffers from speech and language delays and gross and\nfine motors skills delays, has difficulty in muscle training and\ncoordination, and has deficient cognitive ability, limited ver-\nbal ability, and behavioral difficulties. Joseph has difficulty\ntoilet training, is unable to control his drooling, and has diffi-\nculties buttoning and zipping his clothing and tying his shoes\non his own.\n\n   Joseph attended elementary school within a special day\nclass at the mainstream elementary school in the Magnolia\nDistrict from the time he was three until June 2002, when he\nwas twelve. In the spring of 2002, the Magnolia District con-\nducted a triennial assessment of Joseph. The District con-\ncluded that for the 2001-2002 extended school year (ESY)\n\f4236     PARK v. ANAHEIM UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT\nand the 2002-2003 school year, Joseph should be placed in\nthe Hope School, a special education school on a small cam-\npus that is separated from the other local schools. Joseph’s\nmother had concerns about the District’s assessment of\nJoseph, and after visiting the Hope School in May 2002, she\ndecided that Hope was not appropriate for Joseph. In June\n2002, Joseph’s mother exercised her right to request a due\nprocess hearing before the California Special Education Hear-\ning Office. Because Joseph’s mother did not agree with the\nplacement in the restrictive Hope School, Joseph spent that\nsummer at a church-operated summer camp program. During\nthis time, Joseph’s mother also arranged for Joseph to be eval-\nuated by an independent speech-language therapist and an\noccupational therapist. In August 2002, the Anaheim District\nentered into a mediated interim agreement with Joseph. Pur-\nsuant to the agreement, Joseph was enrolled in a special day\nclass for disabled children at the Lexington Junior High\nSchool, and the District formulated a plan for assessments of\nJoseph. The District’s assessments of Joseph took place dur-\ning September and October 2002 (and formed the basis for\nsome of the claims Joseph Park presented before us). In\nNovember 2002, the District again concluded that the Hope\nSchool was an appropriate placement for Joseph, and it for-\nmulated Joseph’s full educational plan and goals.\n\n   The due process hearing commenced later that month. The\nHearing Officer rendered his decision four months later, in\nMarch 2003, determining that because it was not the least\nrestrictive environment available, the Hope School was\nindeed not an appropriate placement for Joseph, as Joseph’s\nmother had determined almost one year earlier, and holding\nthat the District was required to supplement Joseph’s self-help\ngoals and objectives. Joseph’s mother then exercised her right\nto pursue a civil action. In February 2004, the district court\nordered the District to comply with the Hearing Officer’s\norder. As a result, the District was required to formulate new\ngoals and objectives for Joseph, to compensate Joseph’s spe-\ncial education teacher for providing weekly occupational ther-\n\f         PARK v. ANAHEIM UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT         4237\napy consultative services to Joseph, to undertake a new\nfunctional behavior assessment of Joseph, and to develop a\nbehavior intervention plan for Joseph. Because of Joseph’s\nmother’s efforts in advocating for her son, Joseph obtained\nplacement in a special day class at Lexington Junior High\nSchool. Instead of being cloistered in a segregated special\neducation school, as the District had deemed acceptable,\nJoseph was able to attend a mainstream school and integrate\ninto society as best he can, as is required by the IDEA. At the\ntime of the due process hearing, Joseph was twelve years old.\nHe is now sixteen and still fighting to obtain what is under the\nIDEA his statutory right.\n\n                               II.\n\n   The IDEA is the primary federal legislation that supports\nspecial education and related services for children with dis-\nabilities. The IDEA is premised on the notion that\n“[i]mproving educational results for children with disabilities\nis an essential element of our national policy of ensuring\nequality of opportunity, full participation, independent living,\nand economic self-sufficiency for individuals with disabili-\nties.” 20 U.S.C. § 1400(c)(1). With that principle guiding the\nlegislation, the IDEA seeks to “ensure that all children with\ndisabilities have available to them a free appropriate public\neducation that emphasizes special education and related ser-\nvices designed to meet their unique needs and prepare them\nfor further education, employment, and independent living”;\n“to ensure that the rights of children with disabilities and par-\nents of such children are protected”; and “to assist States,\nlocalities, educational service agencies, and Federal agencies\nto provide for the education of all children with disabilities.”\nId. § 1400(d)(1).\n\n   Federal funding for state and local educational agencies\nunder the IDEA is conditioned on the requirement that states\nprovide a free appropriate public education (FAPE) to each\ndisabled child. 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a). When Congress enacted\n\f4238     PARK v. ANAHEIM UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT\nthe IDEA’s predecessor, the Education for the Handicapped\nAct, in 1975, it authorized the federal government to pay up\nto 40% of the “excess” cost of educating a child with\ndisabilities—the difference between the cost of educating a\nchild with disabilities and the cost of educating a child with-\nout disabilities. See Congressional Research Service, Individ-\nuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA): Current Funding\nTrends, Feb. 11, 2005, at 8, available at http://digital.library.\nunt.edu/govdocs/crs//data/2005/upl-meta-crs-6209/RL32085_\n2005Feb11.pdf?PHPSESSID=a8756a35fe20505c3d9cd827\nb6100443. Despite the authorization, however, federal fund-\ning has never matched the 40% goal. In FY 1995, Congress\nappropriated only $2,322,915,000 to states for education of\nschool-aged with disabilities—only 7.80% of estimated\nexcess cost. Id. at 9. Had Congress appropriated the amount\nit aspired to, the eligible states would have received\n$11,872,137,000. In FY 2002, at the time Joseph’s struggle to\nobtain an appropriate education began, Congress appropriated\n$7,512,533,000, some 15.45% of excess cost, rather than\n$19,446,407,000, which would have totaled 40% of excess\ncost. While the percentage of excess cost that the federal gov-\nernment has provided to eligible states has continually\nincreased throughout the years, appropriations still do not\nreach even 20% of increased cost despite numerous congres-\nsional pleas for “full funding” of the 40% goal. See id.; see\nalso IDEA Full Funding Act, S. 2185, 109th Cong. (2006);\nMandatory IDEA Full Funding Compromise Act, H.R. 3145,\n109th Cong. (2005); Mandatory IDEA Full Funding Compro-\nmise Act, H.R. 3802, 108th Cong. (2004); IDEA Full-\nFunding Act of 2003, S. 939, 108th Cong. (2003); Full Fund-\ning for IDEA Now Act of 2003, H.R. 823, 108th Cong.\n(2003); Helping Children Succeed by Fully Funding the Indi-\nviduals with Disability Education Act (IDEA), S. 466, 107th\nCong. (2001); IDEA Full Funding Act of 2000, S. 2341,\n106th Cong. (2000).\n\n  Given the failure to reach the goals set out when the IDEA\nand its predecessor were enacted, it is no surprise that states\n\f         PARK v. ANAHEIM UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT        4239\nand local school districts appear reluctant to provide truly\nappropriate public education for children with disabilities. At\nthe time of the initiation of this action, school districts were\nbeing forced to pay for more than 85% of the cost of educat-\ning children with disabilities. At a time when general educa-\ntion in most school districts is increasingly underfunded,\nshouldering the burden of costly evaluations and education\nprograms for disabled children grows more difficult every\nyear. But the failure of Congress to reach 40% funding does\nnot give states and school districts license to deny disabled\nchildren the education to which they are entitled. Under the\nIDEA, states receiving federal funding are required to provide\nevery disabled child a free public education that is appropriate\nfor the child’s needs, no matter how inadequate that federal\nfunding may be. That the districts are strapped for cash does\nnot entitle them to skimp on an individual’s education. Nor\nshould it suggest to courts that they can decline to award\nattorney’s fees in cases such as this where the parents of dis-\nabled children clearly prevail on significant issues.\n\n                              III.\n\n   For the purpose of attorney’s fees awards, a prevailing\nparty is defined as “a party which ‘succeed[s] on any signifi-\ncant issue in litigation which achieves some of the benefit the\nparties sought in bringing the suit.’ ” Parents of Student W. v.\nPuyallup Sch.

Park succeeded on sev-\neral issues and achieved much of the benefit he sought in\nexercising his rights to a due process hearing and to bring a\ncivil suit. The Hearing Officer determined, and the district\ncourt affirmed, that the District had denied Joseph a FAPE for\nthe 2001-2002 extended school year (ESY) and for September\n2002 through November 2002. To remedy the denial of a\nFAPE, the Hearing Officer required the District to provide\ncompensatory education, which was awarded to Joseph in the\nform of services provided by his classroom teacher for thirty\n\f4240     PARK v. ANAHEIM UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT\nminutes per week for the remainder of the 2002-2003 school\nyear and ESY, relief which the district court affirmed. In addi-\ntion, the Hearing Officer found that although the goals and\nobjectives the District formulated were generally appropriate\nfor Joseph, the District needed to supplement the proposed\nIEP for Joseph that was in place beginning in November 2002\nby adding self-help goals for buttoning, zipping, and toilet\ntraining. Finally, the Hearing Officer agreed with Joseph’s\ncontention that the District had failed to offer Joseph an\nappropriate program at the Hope School and that the Hope\nSchool was not Joseph’s “least restrictive environment.” See\n20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(5)(A) (conditioning state eligibility for\nfederal funding on requirement that states educate disabled\nchildren with nondisabled children and remove disabled chil-\ndren “from the regular educational environment . . . only\nwhen the nature or severity of the disability of a child is such\nthat education in regular classes with the use of supplemen-\ntary aids and services cannot be achieved satisfactorily”).\nAccordingly, the Hearing Officer called for implementation of\na new functional behavior assessment (FBA) and behavioral\nintervention plan (BIP).\n\n   Park’s successes cannot be regarded as insufficient to ren-\nder Park a “prevailing party,” even acknowledging that the\nDistrict also prevailed on some issues.

In Texas State\nTeachers Ass’n, the Supreme Court found that the teachers’\nunion was the prevailing party in its § 1983 claim challenging\na school board policy, even though the union had not been\ngranted relief on what was identified by a divided panel of the\nFifth Circuit Court of Appeals as the “main thrust” of the action.1\n489 U.S. at 787 (internal quotation marks omitted). Rejecting\nthe “central issue” test for determining prevailing party status,\nthe Court held that a party could be deemed “prevailing” even\n  1\n    While Texas State Teachers Ass’n is a § 1983 case deciding a motion\nfor attorney’s fees under § 1988, the Ninth Circuit has adopted its reason-\ning and result in IDEA cases. See, e.g., Kletzelman, 91 F.3d at 71.\n\f4242     PARK v. ANAHEIM UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT\ndespite failure on a “central” issue as long as the party had\nprevailed on “any significant issue in litigation which\nachieve[d] some of the benefit the parties sought in bringing\nsuit.” Id. at 792-93 (alteration in original) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). The Court noted that distinguishing between\nsuccess on primary and secondary issues, or on central and\ntangential issues, is “essentially unhelpful” in defining a pre-\nvailing party. Thus, whether Park’s successes are on “central”\nor “primary” issues is irrelevant; the only salient question is\nwhether the claims on which he prevailed are significant.\n\n   Of course, despite the general rule that the degree of suc-\ncess does not bear on the threshold question of eligibility for\nan attorney’s fees award, the Ninth Circuit has held that if\nsuccess is insignificant, then a court may find that a party that\nsucceeds on some claims is nonetheless not a prevailing party.\nSpecifically, attorney’s fees may be properly denied “[w]here\nthe plaintiff’s success on a legal claim can be characterized as\npurely technical or de minimis.” Kletzelman, 91 F.3d at 71\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Here, however, Park’s\nsuccesses materially altered the education he receives.\nBecause he chose to exercise his rights under the IDEA, the\nDistrict was forced to reassess the objectives and plan for\nJoseph Park’s education and to provide for compensatory edu-\ncation to remedy its failure to provide a FAPE during several\nmonths of his education.\n\n   The issues on which Joseph prevailed are not technical or\nde minimis, as the majority would have it; rather, they go to\nthe very essence of the IDEA. The determination by the Hear-\ning Officer and the district court that Joseph was denied a\nFAPE the 2001-2002 ESY and for September 2002 through\nNovember 2002—even setting aside the other issues on which\nJoseph prevailed—is the most significant of successes possi-\nble under the IDEA. At the heart of the Act is the requirement\nthat each disabled child receive a free appropriate public edu-\ncation that is tailored to his or her unique individual needs,\nsee 20 U.S.C. § 1400(d)(1)(A), and the necessity of providing\n\f         PARK v. ANAHEIM UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT          4243\neducation that is effective in “ensuring equality of opportu-\nnity, full participation, independent living, and economic self-\nsufficiency for individuals with disabilities,” see id.\n§ 1400(c)(1), (d)(4). It is impossible to reconcile the majori-\nty’s conclusion that Joseph’s success was “minor” with the\ngoals and statutory framework of the IDEA.\n\n   The majority’s decision to affirm the district court’s denial\nof fees, even though Joseph succeeded in proving that the\nDistrict denied him a FAPE and has obtained significant\nrelief, offers only discouragement to families with disabled\nchildren. Denial of attorney’s fees chills the exercise of their\nrights to pursue due process hearings and civil actions on sim-\nilarly meritorious claims. It only encourages school districts\nto spend their resources fighting families who wish to vindi-\ncate their rights under the IDEA, rather than spending these\nresources where they should be spent—on providing public\neducation to the disabled. Fee awards are generally the only\nmechanism through which disabled litigants with limited\nresources are able to vindicate their rights under the IDEA.\nThe ability of plaintiffs to recover fees when they prove they\nhave been denied their rights under the IDEA is central to the\nstatutory framework of the Act. The fee provision of the\nIDEA, which originated in Congress’s enactment of the\nHandicapped Children’s Protection Act to overrule the\nSupreme Court holding in Smith v. Robinson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111264\"><a href=\"/opinion/111264/smith-v-robinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">992</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(1984), that the Education for the Handicapped Act (the\nIDEA’s predecessor) did not allow attorney’s fees for prevail-\ning parties, allows plaintiffs to act as private attorneys general\nto exercise their rights. This is precisely why “[a] district\ncourt’s discretion to deny a request for attorneys’ fees is nar-\nrow.” Kletzelman, 91 F.3d at 70 (citing Abu-Sahyun v. Palo\nAlto Unified Sch. Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"504086\"><a href=\"/opinion/504086/lana-abu-sahyun-by-and-through-feryal-abu-sahyun-her-guardian-ad-litem/\"><span class=\"volume\">843</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1250</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1252 (9th Cir. 1988)).\nIf a district court’s discretion to deny requests for attorneys’\nfees were not so narrow, attorneys would be loath to take on\nany IDEA claim in which the client may be unable to pay for\nrepresentation. Joseph had a valid claim, which the Hearing\nOfficer recognized, and for which the district court affirmed\n\f4244     PARK v. ANAHEIM UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT\nJoseph merited relief. Lawyers will only bring these cases if\nthey know that they will be compensated when they prevail.\nThe majority’s decision to affirm the denial of attorney’s fees\nto a party which clearly prevailed on significant issues,\ndespite the majority’s own acknowledgment that fees “might\nhave been” within the discretion of the district court, will\nserve not only to deny Joseph Park the relief he deserves, but\nalso to encourage school districts to violate the IDEA, while\nfurther discouraging families of disabled children from fight-\ning for their rights under the IDEA.\n\f</pre>",
