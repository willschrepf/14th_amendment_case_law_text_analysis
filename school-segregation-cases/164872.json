After\n\ncareful consideration of the parties’ filings, the relevant legal authorities, and the entire record in\n\nthis case, by Order of September 28, 2012, the Court granted the defendant’s motion to dismiss,\n\ngranted the plaintiffs’ motion to amend, and dismissed all but one count of the amended\n\ncomplaint. See Order (Sept. 28, 2012). This Opinion explains the reasoning behind that Order.2\n\n\n       1\n                Mayor Vincent Gray has been substituted as the defendant for former Mayor\nAdrian Fenty pursuant to Rule 25(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See Order at 1 n.1\n(Sept. 28, 2012). While Mayor Fenty was sued in both his individual and official capacities, the\nplaintiffs have not targeted any particular action by former Mayor Fenty but focus only on actions\nby the District of Columbia government. See Opinion at 3 n.2 (Dec. 17, 2010). Accordingly,\nAdrian Fenty has been dismissed as a defendant in this case.\n        2\n                The papers reviewed in connection with this matter include the following:\nplaintiffs’ motion to amend (“Mot. Am.”) [Dkt. No. 68]; defendant’s opposition (“Opp. Am.”)\n[Dkt. No. 69]; plaintiffs’ reply (“Reply Am.”) [Dkt. No. 71]; defendant’s motion to dismiss\nand/or motion for summary judgment (“MTD”) [Dkt. No. 29]; plaintiffs’ opposition to that\nmotion (“Opp. MTD”) [Dkt. No. 34]; defendant’s reply (“Reply MTD”) [Dkt. No. 46]; plaintiffs’\nproposed second amended complaint (“2d. Am. Compl.”) [Dkt. No. 68-1] and the exhibits\nattached thereto; and plaintiffs’ current amended complaint (“Am. Compl.”) [Dkt. No. 15].\n\f                                        I. BACKGROUND\n\n               This action was commenced in October 2010 on behalf of nine individual\n\nplaintiffs who formerly inhabited La Casa Shelter, an emergency, low-barrier housing facility for\n\nthe homeless that was located in the Columbia Heights neighborhood of the District of\n\nColumbia. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 2-14. La Casa, the facilities of which consisted of portable trailers,\n\nwas operated by a contractor of the District of Columbia until October 15, 2010, when the shelter\n\nwas closed at the direction of the District. See Memorandum Opinion and Order at 2 (Aug. 3,\n\n2011). The District says that its closure of La Casa was part of its efforts to expand its\n\nPermanent Supportive Housing (“PSH”) program, which involves the placement of chronically\n\nhomeless individuals in permanent housing where they can gain access to long-term supportive\n\nservices. Id. According to the plaintiffs, the District uses the PSH program “as an excuse for\n\nclosing the shelters in the predominantly white parts of the city.” Id. The plaintiffs brought\n\nclaims of discrimination based on race, disability, and place of residence under the Fair Housing\n\nAct, 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601 et seq., the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 et seq.,\n\nand the District of Columbia Human Rights Act, D.C. Code §§ 2-1401.01 et seq., alleging that\n\nthe District is “systematically removing persons who are disabled, indigent, and predominantly\n\nminority” from areas inhabited by “the most affluent, white populations” in the city, and placing\n\nthose homeless individuals in poorer neighborhoods “with the least resources available.” Id. at\n\n2-3. In support of these claims, the plaintiffs have noted that La Casa was the “last remaining\n\npublic shelter in Ward 1” and that Wards 2, 3, and 4 of the District already lacked public shelters.\n\nId.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  2\n\f                The plaintiffs’ complaint was accompanied by a motion requesting a temporary\n\nrestraining order and both preliminary and permanent injunctive relief. See Plaintiffs[’] Motion\n\nfor Temporary Restraining Order, Preliminary and Permanent Injunctions [Dkt. No. 11].\n\nTreating the motion as a request for an immediate temporary restraining order, a motions judge\n\npromptly denied it, stating that the plaintiffs’ asserted injuries “provides no basis for entering an\n\nemergency injunction before the District may be heard on the matter.” Memorandum and Order\n\nat 2 (Oct. 22, 2010). The plaintiffs filed an amended motion in November 2010, seeking\n\npreliminary injunctive relief. This Court denied that motion upon concluding that the plaintiffs\n\nhad not satisfied the four-part standard necessary to obtain such relief. See Opinion (Dec. 17,\n\n2010). In particular, the Court found no substantial likelihood that the plaintiffs were likely to\n\nsucceed on their claims. Id. at 6-11.\n\n               In December 2010, the District of Columbia filed its motion to dismiss or, in the\n\nalternative, for summary judgment. Over the next several months, however, the plaintiffs filed\n\nfour separate motions to amend their complaint, which they already had amended once as of\n\nright.3 Explaining that it did not intend to review four separate and likely redundant motions, the\n\nCourt denied without prejudice the motions to amend and directed the plaintiffs instead to file a\n\nsingle motion specifically identifying all proposed changes to the complaint. See Memorandum\n\n\n\n\n       3\n                The plaintiffs also filed a motion to reconsider the Court’s denial of the plaintiffs’\nmotion for a preliminary injunction, a motion for leave to file a reply out of time, a motion for\nleave to file documents under seal, two motions for discovery, and one motion “to supplement\nthe record” — prompting the District to file a motion to preclude the plaintiffs from filing further\nmotions without the Court’s leave, which the Court denied without prejudice. See Memorandum\nOpinion and Order (Aug. 3, 2011).\n\n                                                  3\n\fOpinion and Order at 3-4 (Aug. 3, 2011). The plaintiffs subsequently filed their pending motion\n\nto amend.\n\n               In their proposed second amended complaint, the plaintiffs seek to add thirty-three\n\nnew plaintiffs to the action, to provide additional information relating to their claims, and to add\n\ntwo new claims, arising under the District of Columbia’s Homeless Services Reform Act, D.C.\n\nCode § 4-751 et seq., and the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution. Mot. Am. at\n\n2, 5-7; see 2d Am. Compl.4 The District opposes the plaintiffs’ motion, arguing that the\n\nproposed amendment is futile.\n\n\n                                    II. LEGAL STANDARDS\n\n               “Whether to grant a motion to amend is within the sound discretion of the district\n\ncourt.” Gerlich v. United States DOJ, 828 F. Supp. 2d 284, 290-91 (D.D.C. 2011). Under Rule\n\n15(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a court should “freely give leave” to amend a\n\npleading “when justice so requires.” FED . R. CIV . P. 15(a). “However, a district court may\n\nproperly deny a motion to amend if the amended pleading would not survive a motion to\n\ndismiss.” In re Interbank Funding Corp. Sec. Litig., 629 F.3d 213, 218 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (citing\n\nFoman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962)); accord Nat’l Wrestling Coaches Ass’n v. Dep’t of\n\nEduc., 366 F.3d 930, 945 (D.C. Cir. 2004). Where granting a motion to amend would “waste\n\ntime and judicial resources” because the complaint “must fail, as a matter of law, in light of the\n\nrecord in the case,” justice does not require permitting amendment. Ross v. DynCorp, 362 F.\n\n\n\n       4\n             Because the plaintiffs’ motion to amend and supporting memorandum are\ncombined within the same filing but not separately paginated, the page numbers used here for\nthose documents refer to the page numbers generated by the Court’s ECF system.\n\n                                                  4\n\fSupp. 2d 344, 364 n.11 (D.D.C. 2005). “In other words, if the proposed amendment would still\n\nrender the complaint deficient, courts need not grant leave.” S.K. Innovation, Inc. v. Finpol, 854\n\nF. Supp. 2d 99, 106-07 (D.D.C. 2012). Leave to amend also may be denied based on “undue\n\ndelay, bad faith, undue prejudice to the opposing party, [or] repeated failure to cure deficiencies.”\n\nRichardson v. United States, 193 F.3d 545, 548-49 (D.C. Cir. 1999).\n\n                Rule 12(b)(6) allows dismissal of a complaint if a plaintiff fails “to state a claim\n\nupon which relief can be granted.” FED . R. CIV . P. 12(b)(6). “Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n\n8(a)(2) requires only ‘a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled\n\nto relief,’ in order to ‘give the defendant fair notice of what the . . . claim is and the grounds upon\n\nwhich it rests[.]’” Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007) (quoting Conley v.\n\nGibson, 355 U.S. 41, 47 (1957)). Although “detailed factual allegations” are not necessary to\n\nwithstand a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, id., the complaint “must contain sufficient factual\n\nmatter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’” Ashcroft v.\n\nIqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quotations omitted). “A claim has facial plausibility when the\n\nplaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the\n\ndefendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.” In re Interbank Funding Corp. Sec. Litig., 629\n\nF.3d 213, 218 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (quoting Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678). The Court “must\n\naccept as true all of the factual allegations contained in the complaint.” Erickson v. Pardus, 551\n\nU.S. 89, 94 (2007); see also Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555. The complaint “is\n\nconstrued liberally in the [plaintiff’s] favor, and [the Court should] grant [the plaintiff] the\n\nbenefit of all inferences that can be derived from the facts alleged.” Kowal v. MCI Commc’ns\n\nCorp., 16 F.3d 1271, 1276 (D.C. Cir. 1994). Nevertheless, the Court need not accept inferences\n\n\n                                                   5\n\fdrawn by the plaintiff if those inferences are unsupported by facts alleged in the complaint, nor\n\nmust the Court accept the plaintiff’s legal conclusions. See id.; Browning v. Clinton, 292 F.3d\n\n235, 242 (D.C. Cir. 2002).\n\n               In deciding a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the Court “may consider the\n\nfacts alleged in the complaint, documents attached to the complaint as exhibits or incorporated by\n\nreference, and matters about which the [C]ourt may take judicial notice.” Cole v. Boeing Co.,\n\n845 F. Supp. 2d 277, 283 (D.D.C. 2012) (citing Abhe & Svoboda, Inc. v. Chao, 508 F.3d 1052,\n\n1059 (D.C. Cir. 2007)). “In determining whether to dismiss, courts treat documents attached to a\n\ncomplaint as if they are part of the complaint.” In re Cheney, 406 F.3d 723, 729 (D.C. Cir. 2005)\n\n(citing EEOC v. St. Francis Xavier Parochial Sch., 117 F.3d 621, 624-25 (D.C. Cir. 1997)).5\n\n\n       5\n                The plaintiffs have attached seventeen exhibits to their proposed complaint,\nincluding declarations from certain plaintiffs and from other former residents of La Casa,\ngovernment reports, census data, news articles, photographs, and other matter. See 2d Am.\nCompl., Exhs. 1-17 [Dkt. Nos. 68-2, 68-3]. “A copy of a written instrument that is an exhibit to\na pleading is a part of the pleading for all purposes,” FED . R. CIV . P. 10(c), and may be\nconsidered by the Court on a motion to dismiss without converting the motion into one for\nsummary judgment. Abhe & Svoboda, Inc. v. Chao, 508 F.3d at 1059. It is apparent that certain\ndocuments and other material attached to a pleading do not qualify as a “written instrument” and\ntherefore do not fall within the meaning of the language in Rule 10(c). 5A WRIGHT & MILLER,\nFEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE § 1327 (3d ed. 2004); see Perkins v. Silverstein, 939 F.2d\n463, 467 (7th Cir. 1991) (“The newspaper articles, commentaries and editorial cartoons which\nPerkins attached to the complaint . . . are not the type of documentary evidence or ‘written\ninstrument[s]’ which Fed. R. Civ. P. 10(c) intended to be incorporated into, and made a part of,\nthe complaint.”); Murphy v. Cadillac Rubber & Plastics, Inc., 946 F. Supp. 1108, 1115\n(W.D.N.Y. 1996) (“A ‘written instrument’ is a document evidencing legal rights or duties or\ngiving formal expression to a legal act or agreement, such as a deed, will, bond, lease, insurance\npolicy or security agreement.”) (citing BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY 801, 1612 (6th ed. 1990)); 5A\nFEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE § 1327 (“Of course, lengthy or numerous exhibits\ncontaining extraneous or evidentiary material should not be attached to the pleadings.”) (citing\ncases). The Court will consider only those materials attached by the plaintiffs as exhibits to their\ncomplaint that it determines fairly fall within the scope of Rule 10(c).\n\n\n\n                                                 6\n\f                                          III. DISCUSSION\n\n                A. Disparate Treatment Based on Race under the FHA (Count I)6\n\n                                   1. “Dwellings” under the FHA\n\n                The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in the sale and rental of properties\n\nand also makes it unlawful to “otherwise make unavailable or deny[] a dwelling to any person\n\nbecause of race, color, religion, sex, familial status, or national origin.” 42 U.S.C. § 3604. If La\n\nCasa qualifies as a “dwelling” under this provision, then its closure would appear to “make [it]\n\nunavailable” to its former inhabitants and “deny” them a dwelling there within the meaning of\n\nthe FHA. Cf. 2922 Sherman Ave. Tenants’ Ass’n v. District of Columbia, 444 F.3d 673, 685\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2006) (holding that instructing tenants that their occupancy is prohibited and that they\n\nmust seek alternative housing qualifies as making a dwelling “unavailable” under the FHA);\n\nGreater New Orleans Fair Hous. Action Ctr. v. U.S. Dept. of Hous. & Urban Dev., 723 F. Supp.\n\n\n\n                In addition, the plaintiffs’ proposed amended complaint purports to “incorporate[]\nby reference in their entirety . . . [p]laintiffs’ evidence previously filed, and points and authorities\nand facts provided in Plaintiffs’ Reply to Defendant’s Opposition to injunctive and declaratory\nrelief, filed December 6, 2010, and the evidence filed Dec. 26, 2010 in Plaintiffs’ Motion for\nReconsideration.” 2d Am. Compl. at 8 n.3. There is no basis in the Federal Rules for\nincorporating these materials into the plaintiffs’ complaint. Rule 10 provides only that a\n“statement in a pleading may be adopted by reference . . . in any other pleading or motion.” FED .\nR. CIV . P. 10(c) (emphasis added). The plaintiffs’ prior memoranda and attachments thereto are\nnot statements in a pleading, see FED . R. CIV . P. 7(a) (listing documents that constitute pleadings)\nand may not be incorporated by reference into a complaint. Finally, in assessing the sufficiency\nof this complaint, the Court will not consider factual allegations made by the plaintiffs\nexclusively in their briefing, as opposed to within the proposed complaint itself. The plaintiffs\nhave had ample opportunity to fashion a comprehensive complaint, and ample warnings about\nthe consequences of failing to do so.\n        6\n             Unless otherwise noted, references to counts in the complaint are to the proposed\nsecond amended complaint [Dkt. No. 68-1], which is attached to the plaintiffs’ motion to amend.\n\n                                                   7\n\f2d 14, 22-23 (D.D.C. 2010) (“[T]he D.C. Circuit has made clear that ‘make unavailable’ means\n\nnot just preventing access to new housing by prospective buyers and renters but also the loss of\n\nhousing to those who already occupy it.”).\n\n               As a preliminary matter, the Court rejects — at least at this stage of the\n\nproceedings — the District’s contention that La Casa was not a “dwelling” within the meaning of\n\nthe FHA and that the plaintiffs’ FHA claims must fail on that basis alone.7 The District\n\nmaintains that “several” courts “have found that the FHA does not apply to low barrier homeless\n\nshelters because such shelters do not fall within the FHA’s definition of a ‘dwelling.’” MTD at\n\n22; see Opp. Am. at 7 n.6. In support, the District cites only two decisions, one of which did not\n\nrule on the issue at all, but instead assumed without deciding that homeless shelters do qualify as\n\ndwellings under the Act, while expressing some doubt about that point. See Johnson v. Dixon,\n\n786 F. Supp. 1, 4 (D.D.C. 1991). The other decision found that a particular homeless shelter did\n\nnot qualify as a “dwelling” based on ten context-specific factors regarding the terms of residence\n\nat that shelter — information that was presented at summary judgment. See Intermountain Fair\n\nHous. Council v. Boise Rescue Mission Ministries, 717 F. Supp. 2d 1101, 1111 (D. Idaho 2010).\n\nHere, such detailed information about the terms of residence at La Casa shelter has not been\n\nprovided.\n\n               The District cites the definition of a “low barrier shelter” under D.C. Code\n\n§ 4-751.01(26) in support of its contention that such shelters constitute “transient” housing\n\n\n       7\n               The FHA defines a “dwelling” as “any building, structure, or portion thereof\nwhich is occupied as, or designed or intended for occupancy as, a residence by one or more\nfamilies, and any vacant land which is offered for sale or lease for the construction or location\nthereon of any such building, structure, or portion thereof.” 42 U.S.C. § 3602(b). The statute\ndoes not define the term “residence,” however.\n\n                                                 8\n\fsimilar to “hotels and bed and breakfasts,” but the District fails to note that the provision it cites\n\ndefines low-barrier facilities as offering shelter “without imposition of . . . time limits.” Id. This\n\ndefinition undermines the District’s argument that La Casa “was neither intended nor designed\n\nfor long term stay,” MTD at 24, a claim that is further belied by the plaintiffs’ declarations\n\nattesting to their habitual and regular stay at La Casa. See 2d Am. Compl., Exh. 1.; cf.\n\nIntermountain Fair Hous. Council v. Boise Rescue Mission Ministries, 717 F. Supp. 2d at 1111\n\n(relying in part on fact that residents of shelter in question “generally are allowed to stay for a\n\nmaximum of seventeen consecutive nights”). Furthermore, the District concedes that at least\n\nthree decisions have applied the FHA to homeless shelters, while maintaining that these\n\ndecisions “have not squarely addressed whether all homeless shelters constitute a ‘dwelling’\n\nunder the FHA.” MTD at 23.\n\n               Mindful that “the FHA should be broadly construed to effectuate its remedial\n\npurpose,” Nat’l Fair Hous. Alliance, Inc. v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 208 F. Supp. 2d 46, 55\n\n(D.D.C. 2002) (citing Trafficante v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 409 U.S. 205, 211-12 (1972)),\n\nand lacking evidence about La Casa of the type that was relied on in Intermountain Fair Housing\n\nCouncil, the Court does not find the FHA categorically inapplicable based on its definition of the\n\nword “dwelling.”\n\n\n                            2. Sufficiency of the Plaintiffs’ Allegations\n\n               “[P]laintiffs alleging disparate treatment must establish . . . that the defendant\n\nintentionally discriminated against them on the basis of race or ethnicity.” 2922 Sherman Ave.\n\nTenants’ Ass’n v. Dist. of Columbia, 444 F.3d at 682; see id. at 684 (“In disparate treatment\n\ncases . . . we focus on the defendant’s motivation, not the effects of its actions.”). In disparate\n\n                                                   9\n\ftreatment claims under the FHA, this circuit has utilized the burden-shifting framework\n\nestablished in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-04 (1973), for employment\n\ndiscrimination cases. 2922 Sherman Ave. Tenants’ Ass’n v. Dist. of Columbia, 444 F.3d at 682.\n\nThat framework applies “where direct evidence of discriminatory intent is not available,” Hall v.\n\nGiant Food, Inc., 175 F.3d 1074, 1077 (D.C. Cir. 1999), and plaintiffs may proceed by\n\n“present[ing] sufficient evidence to permit an inference of discrimination,” which the defendant\n\nmust rebut by articulating “a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions,” which in turn\n\nmay be rebutted “by showing that the defendant’s proffered reason was pretext for\n\ndiscrimination.” Id. (citing McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. at 802-04). The\n\nplaintiff “may meet her burden of proof by either direct or circumstantial evidence.” Dunaway v.\n\nInt’l Broth. of Teamsters, 310 F.3d 758, 763 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (citing U.S. Postal Serv. Bd. of\n\nGovernors v. Aikens, 460 U.S. 711, 714 n.3 (1983)).\n\n               That having been said, under the burden-shifting framework the question of\n\nwhether a prima facie case has been established “is almost always irrelevant. At the motion to\n\ndismiss stage, the district court cannot throw out a complaint even if the plaintiff did not plead\n\nthe elements of a prima facie case.” Brady v. Office of Sergeant at Arms, 520 F.3d 490, 493\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2008) (citing Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A., 534 U.S. 506, 510-11 (2002)). Rather,\n\n“the ordinary rules for assessing the sufficiency of a complaint apply.” Swierkiewicz v. Sorema\n\nN. A., 534 U.S. at 511. “To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient\n\nfactual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face,” meaning\n\nthat “the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference\n\nthat the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.” In re Interbank Funding Corp. Sec.\n\n\n\n                                                  10\n\fLitig., 629 F.3d at 218 (quoting Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678). The Supreme Court has\n\nexplained that “a court considering a motion to dismiss can choose to begin by identifying\n\npleadings that, because they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of\n\ntruth. While legal conclusions can provide the framework of a complaint, they must be\n\nsupported by factual allegations.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679.\n\n               Here, the plaintiffs allege that the District intentionally discriminated against them\n\nbased on their race. 2d Am. Compl. ¶ 85. In support of this claim, they offer only the bare\n\nassertion that the District’s PSH program “has been used as an excuse for closing the shelters in\n\nthe predominantly white parts of the city.” Id. ¶ 69. The plaintiffs describe in detail the\n\nhardships suffered by former residents of La Casa, and they make a number of allegations\n\nregarding the general state of homelessness and poverty in Washington, D.C., and the inadequate\n\nimplementation of the PSH program. Id. ¶¶ 54-55, 61, 63-67, 71-79. Entirely missing are any\n\nfactual allegations that would support their stark accusation of intentional discrimination based\n\non race. A complaint does not suffice “if it tenders ‘naked assertion[s]’ devoid of ‘further factual\n\nenhancement.’” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550\n\nU.S. at 557). The plaintiffs have made no allegations that, accepted as true, could serve as\n\n“direct evidence of discriminatory intent,” Hall v. Giant Food, Inc., 175 F.3d at 1077, nor that\n\ncould “permit an inference of discrimination.” Id. Without any supporting factual allegations,\n\nthe plaintiffs’ assertions reduce to mere legal conclusions that are not entitled to the assumption\n\nof truth. See Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556-57 (holding that “bare assertion of\n\nconspiracy” and “conclusory allegation of agreement at some unidentified point does not supply\n\nfacts adequate to show illegality”); Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 680 (stating that in Twombly,\n\n\n\n                                                 11\n\f“the plaintiffs’ assertion of an unlawful agreement was a ‘legal conclusion’ and, as such, was not\n\nentitled to the assumption of truth”). The scant facts alleged in the plaintiffs’ proposed second\n\namended complaint do not “plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.” Id.\n\n               The plaintiffs’ proposed new complaint (unlike their earlier efforts) includes the\n\nrace of each plaintiff, all of whom are African American or Hispanic, with the exception of one\n\nindividual who is described as Pakastani. 2d Am. Compl. ¶¶ 2-43. Aside from this, the only\n\ninformation of any relevance that the plaintiffs propose adding is to include “more specific\n\nallegations of the racial composition areas in which La Casa and other recently closed shelters\n\nwere located as compared with the racial composition of the areas in which the remaining\n\nshelters and PSH placements that have been disclosed are located.” Mot. Am. at 2; see 2d Am.\n\nCompl., Exh. 4. The Court already has explained why such demographic information, without\n\nmore, fails to supply either direct evidence of discriminatory intent or an inference of\n\ndiscrimination. Opinion at 8-9 (Dec. 17, 2010). The plaintiffs therefore are merely proposing to\n\nadd “more specific allegations” about a matter that cannot alone prove their claim. The facts\n\nalleged in the proposed second amended complaint about the racial composition of various\n\ncensus tracks within the city do not satisfy “[t]he need at the pleading stage for allegations\n\nplausibly suggesting (not merely consistent with)” intentional racial discrimination on the part of\n\nthe District. Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. at 557. Because this information does not\n\nprovide “enough fact[s] to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of\n\nillegal [conduct],” therefore “without some further factual enhancement it stops short of the line\n\nbetween possibility and plausibility of ‘entitle[ment] to relief.’” Id. (quoting FED . R. CIV . P.\n\n8(a)(2)).\n\n\n\n                                                  12\n\f               The plaintiffs seek to add other new information in support of their claim,\n\ncontained in exhibits to the proposed complaint, but this information patently does not possess\n\nthe significance they attribute to it. The plaintiffs, for instance, provide a Mayor’s Report on\n\nSupportive Housing Placements and Emergency Shelter, purportedly from September 2010,\n\nwhich is offered to show “the census tracks of relocations in Permanent Supportive Housing of\n\nFormer La Casa Shelter inhabitants.” 2d. Am. Compl., Exh. 5. The geographic disbursement\n\nwithin the city of people who formerly resided at La Casa could indeed help demonstrate that\n\n“homeless individuals, predominantly people of color, have been forced to move in significant\n\nnumbers from Wards 1 or 2 ‘to wards which are highest in minority population’ because of the\n\nclosures of La Casa.” Opinion at 9 (Dec. 17, 2010) (quoting plaintiffs’ reply memorandum). In\n\nconjunction with other factual allegations, perhaps such information might support an inference\n\nof discriminatory intent behind the policies that led to this disbursal. But the report offered by\n\nthe plaintiffs is actually from September 2008, predating the closure of La Casa by two years.\n\nTherefore it cannot shed light on the disbursement within the city of individuals who formerly\n\nresided at La Casa through the PSH program. Similarly, the plaintiffs cite a press release from\n\nthe Downtown DC Business Improvement District describing the efforts of its Downtown\n\nHomeless Outreach Team, which according to the plaintiffs “report[s] a decrease in the homeless\n\non the streets of downtown DC at night from 93 in 2009 to 73 in 2010.” See 2d Am. Compl.,\n\nExh. 6. This report also covers the period before the closure of La Casa (and attributes the\n\ndecrease to the outreach team’s engagement efforts). Id. The point here is not that the plaintiffs\n\nhave failed to meet an evidentiary burden, but rather that, in lieu of the needed factual allegations\n\n\n\n\n                                                 13\n\fsupporting the plausibility of their claim for intentional racial discrimination, they have supplied\n\ndata contributing nothing to support that claim’s plausibility.\n\n                None of the other information that the plaintiffs seek to add to their complaint has\n\nany bearing on the District’s allegedly discriminatory intent. See Mot. Am. at 2, 5-7; 2d Am.\n\nCompl., Exhs. 1-16. The Court finds that the plaintiffs’ claim for disparate treatment under the\n\nFHA based on race lacks the plausibility required to survive a motion to dismiss.\n\n\n              B. Disparate Treatment Based on Disability under the FHA (Count II)\n\n                The plaintiffs allege that in closing La Casa the District intentionally\n\ndiscriminated against them because of their disabilities. The declarations submitted by eight\n\nproposed plaintiffs indicate that they suffer from health problems that may or may not qualify as\n\na “handicap” within the meaning of the FHA. See 2d Am. Compl., Exh. 1.8\n\n                At the outset, it is not entirely clear to the Court how the plaintiffs’ claim is\n\ncognizable within the language of the FHA. It is unlawful under the Act “[t]o discriminate in the\n\nsale or rental, or to otherwise make unavailable or deny, a dwelling to any buyer or renter\n\nbecause of a handicap of . . . a person residing in or intending to reside in that dwelling after it is\n\n. . . made available.” 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(1)(B). The former residents of La Casa were neither\n\nbuyers nor renters of that property, which the parties agree was owned by the District until it was\n\nsold to a private developer. 2d Am. Compl. ¶¶ 46, 47. The FHA also makes it unlawful “[t]o\n\n       8\n                “‘Handicap’ means, with respect to a person . . . a physical or mental impairment\nwhich substantially limits one or more of such person's major life activities, a record of having\nsuch an impairment, or being regarded as having such an impairment.” 42 U.S.C. § 3602(h).\nThe District contends that none of the plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged their possession of a\n“handicap” within the meaning of the FHA. That contention is addressed below, infra at 25-26,\nin the context of the plaintiffs’ claims under the ADA, which employs a nearly identical\ndefinition for “disability.”\n\n                                                  14\n\fdiscriminate against any person . . . in the provision of services or facilities in connection with [a]\n\ndwelling, because of a handicap of . . . that person.” 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(2)(A). Assuming again\n\nthat La Casa qualifies as a “dwelling” under the FHA, see supra at 7-9, if the District closed La\n\nCasa in order to discriminate against its residents on the basis of their disabilities, then that act\n\nperhaps could qualify as discriminating against La Casa’s disabled residents “in the provision of\n\nservices or facilities in connection with” their former dwelling because of their handicap. While\n\nthe Court will assume that such a reading is tenable, it notes that the language of the provision as\n\na whole appears to evince an exclusive concern with the sale and rental of properties and the\n\nprovision of services to renters.9\n\n                Even if the plaintiffs’ claim for intentional disability discrimination is cognizable\n\nwithin the FHA, however, the claim suffers from the same flaw as their claim for intentional race\n\ndiscrimination under the Act: the plaintiffs have not alleged “sufficient factual matter, accepted\n\nas true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678\n\n(quoting Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570). Indeed, the plaintiffs’ claim of\n\nintentional disability discrimination is even more infirm than their claim of intentional race\n\ndiscrimination. Whereas the plaintiffs make at least some effort to cite information from which\n\n\n\n        9\n                The statute provides that “it shall be unlawful:\n\n        (2) To discriminate against any person in the terms, conditions, or privileges of sale or\n        rental of a dwelling, or in the provision of services or facilities in connection with such\n        dwelling, because of a handicap of —\n                (A) that person; or\n                (B) a person residing in or intending to reside in that dwelling after it is so sold,\n                rented, or made available; or\n                (C) any person associated with that person.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 3604(f).\n\n                                                  15\n\fone might infer that the closure of La Casa was motivated by a desire to reduce the minority\n\npopulation of Northwest Washington, see supra at 12-13, the plaintiffs have proffered absolutely\n\nno allegations supporting a plausible inference that the District closed La Casa because of the\n\ndisabilities of its residents. This “naked assertion,” devoid of “further factual enhancement,” is\n\ninsufficient and cannot survive a motion to dismiss. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678.\n\n\n                 C. Disparate Impact Based on Race under the FHA (Count III)\n\n               Although the D.C. Circuit has not yet decided whether disparate impact claims are\n\navailable under the Fair Housing Act, every other circuit has concluded that they are. Greater\n\nNew Orleans Fair Hous. Action Ctr. v. U.S. Dept. of Hous. & Urban Dev., 639 F.3d 1078, 1085\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2011) (citing 2922 Sherman Avenue Tenants’ Ass’n v. District of Columbia, 444 F.3d\n\nat 679). Because this circuit has yet to resolve the question, it also has not decided which of the\n\ntwo “leading tests for applying disparate impact” under the FHA should be used to evaluate such\n\nclaims. Id. (citing “the four-factor balancing test of the Seventh Circuit, Metropolitan Housing\n\nDevelopment Corp. v. Village of Arlington Heights, 558 F.2d 1283, 1290 (7th Cir. 1977), [and]\n\nthe burden-shifting test of the Second Circuit, Huntington Branch, NAACP v. Town of\n\nHuntington, 844 F.2d 926, 935-36 (2nd Cir. 1988)”). Our circuit has noted, however, that in\n\nsome cases “the success of plaintiffs’ claim doesn’t turn on the details of the legal test” because\n\n“either approach requires proof of disproportionate impact, measured in some plausible way.”\n\nId. (citing 2922 Sherman Avenue Tenants’ Ass’n v. Dist. of Columbia, 444 F.3d at 679-80); see\n\nMt. Holly Gardens Citizens in Action, Inc. v. Twp. of Mount Holly, 658 F.3d 375, 382 (3d Cir.\n\n2011) (“‘[N]o single test controls in measuring disparate impact,’ but the Residents must offer\n\n\n\n\n                                                 16\n\fproof of disproportionate impact, measured in a plausible way.”) (quoting Hallmark Developers,\n\nInc. v. Fulton Cnty., 466 F.3d 1276, 1286 (11th Cir. 2006)).\n\n\n                                    1. Disproportionate Effect\n\n               “[T]o prove a disparate impact claim . . . a plaintiff must first demonstrate that the\n\nchallenged policy or practice has a disproportionate effect on a protected class.” 2922 Sherman\n\nAvenue Tenants’ Ass’n v. Dist. of Columbia, 444 F.3d at 679. The parties express different\n\nviews on the correct framework for that inquiry in this case. The plaintiffs appear to allege that\n\nsimply because the homeless population that frequented La Casa was predominantly African\n\nAmerican and Hispanic, the closure of that shelter had a disproportionate effect on those two\n\nracial groups. See 2d Am. Compl. ¶¶ 95-97. The District suggests that the plaintiffs instead\n\nmust show “that the closing of La Casa disproportionately affected minorities . . . either vis-à-vis\n\nthe population at the La Casa shelter or vis-à-vis the homeless population within the District as a\n\nwhole.” Opp. Am. at 11; see MTD at 19 (stating that plaintiffs must articulate supporting facts\n\nsuggesting that members of racial minorities “frequent[ed] La Casa at a higher rate than other\n\nshelters in the city”). In other words, the District contends that a finding of disparate impact\n\nrequires showing that the closure of La Casa (1) affected its minority residents more than its\n\nCaucasian residents, or (2) disproportionately affected minorities within the overall homeless\n\npopulation as compared with the Caucasians in that population.\n\n               Other circuits have held that where the population relying on or in need of\n\nhousing assistance is disproportionately composed of racial minorities, a decision adversely\n\naffecting the availability of that assistance has a disproportionate impact on a protected class,\n\nsubjecting the decision to disparate impact analysis. “Where a plaintiff demonstrates that a\n\n\n                                                 17\n\fprotected group depends on low-income housing to a greater extent than the non-protected\n\npopulation . . . courts have found it reasonable to infer that the protected group will experience a\n\ndisproportionate adverse effect from a policy or decision that reduces low-income housing.”\n\nGallagher v. Magner, 619 F.3d 823, 835 (8th Cir. 2010); see id. (because racial minorities in city\n\nare disproportionately in need of affordable housing, housing code enforcement that decreases\n\navailability of such housing has disproportionate adverse effect on racial minorities); Keith v.\n\nVolpe, 858 F.2d 467, 484 (9th Cir. 1988) (because two-thirds of population that would benefit\n\nfrom state-assisted housing are minority, failure to build projects has twice the adverse impact on\n\nminorities as it had on whites); Huntington Branch, NAACP v. Town of Huntington, 844 F.2d at\n\n929 (because higher percentage of families in subsidized housing and on waiting list are\n\nminority, restricting location of housing projects has disproportionate effect); Metropolitan\n\nHousing Development Corp. v. Village of Arlington Heights, 558 F.2d at 1288 (because greater\n\nnumber of blacks than whites in metropolitan area qualify for subsidized housing, refusal to\n\npermit construction of new subsidized units has disproportionate effect); Resident Advisory Bd.\n\nv. Rizzo, 564 F.2d 126, 142 (3d Cir. 1977) (because waiting list for public housing is composed\n\nprimarily of racial minorities, cancellation of housing project has disproportionate effect).\n\n               Our circuit appears to have at least hinted an approval of this approach. In 2922\n\nSherman Avenue Tenants’ Ass’n v. Dist. of Columbia, 444 F.3d at 681, the court cited the\n\nSecond Circuit’s Huntington Branch decision as an example of a case in which the plaintiffs\n\ndemonstrated disproportionate effect. See id. (stating that the Huntington plaintiffs “presented\n\nevidence that although only 5 percent of the town’s population was minority, each of the town’s\n\nthree housing projects had between 30 and 95 percent minority residents”) (citing Huntington\n\n\n\n                                                 18\n\fBranch, NAACP v. Town of Huntington, 844 F.2d at 929). The court in 2922 Sherman Avenue\n\nrejected the disparate impact claim before it because the plaintiffs did not prove at trial, as they\n\nhad alleged, that certain buildings targeted for closure by the District were disproportionately\n\nHispanic. Id.10\n\n                  In light of the available case law and the absence of precedent from our circuit, the\n\nCourt is not convinced that the plaintiffs can succeed, as the District contends, only by showing\n\nthat white residents of La Casa were more affected by its closure than were minority residents, or\n\nthat La Casa housed a higher percentage of minorities than other shelters. If a disproportionately\n\nhigh percentage of the homeless population in Washington, D.C., is minority, then action by the\n\nDistrict adversely affecting that population could state a claim for disparate impact. Cf.\n\nMetropolitan Housing Development Corp. v. Village of Arlington Heights, 558 F.2d at 1288\n\n(“Because a greater number of black people than white people in the Chicago metropolitan area\n\nsatisfy the income requirements for federally subsidized housing, the Village’s refusal to permit\n\nMHDC to construct the project had a greater impact on black people than on white people.”).11\n\n\n       10\n                Note, however, the court’s statement that because it reached this conclusion, it\n“need not consider the District’s argument that the tenants’ disparate impact claim fails for lack\nof ‘evidence of a relevant comparison group — i.e., persons unaffected by the policy who were\nnot in the protected group and who were similarly [situated].’” 2922 Sherman Ave. Tenants’\nAss’n v. Dist. of Columbia, 444 F.3d at 681 (quoting the District’s brief).\n       11\n                 The Court acknowledges that the cases discussed above involve government\naction affecting all persons within a community who need low-income housing, and that these\ncases do not necessarily apply with equal force to government action that affects a much smaller\nportion of the community. In the former scenario, because of the relatively large percentage of\npeople affected by the government’s action (out of the entire community), any racial imbalance\nin the effect of that action “makes housing options significantly more restrictive for members of a\nprotected group than for persons outside that group.” Hallmark Developers, Inc. v. Fulton\nCounty, Ga., 466 F.3d at 1286. The smaller the affected population, however, the less readily it\ncan be said that a racially disproportionate effect within that population affects housing options\nfor the racial group as a whole.\n\n                                                   19\n\f                                      2. “Segregative Effect”\n\n               In addition, other circuits have held that demonstrating a disproportionate effect\n\non a protected class is only one way to make out a disparate impact housing discrimination claim.\n\nThese circuits hold that there are “two types of discriminatory effects which a facially neutral\n\nhousing decision can have.” Graoch Associates # 33, L.P. v. Louisville/Jefferson County Metro\n\nHuman Relations Comm’n, 508 F.3d 366, 378 (6th Cir. 2007). The first, just discussed, “occurs\n\nwhen [a] decision has a greater adverse impact on one racial group than on another.” Id. “The\n\nsecond is the effect which the decision has on the community involved; if it perpetuates\n\nsegregation and thereby prevents interracial association it will be considered invidious under the\n\nFair Housing Act independently of the extent to which it produces a disparate effect on different\n\nracial groups.” Id. (quoting Arthur v. City of Toledo, Ohio, 782 F.2d 565, 575 (6th Cir. 1986));\n\nsee Hallmark Developers, Inc. v. Fulton County, Ga., 466 F.3d at 1286 (“A plaintiff can\n\ndemonstrate a discriminatory effect in two ways: it can demonstrate that the decision has a\n\nsegregative effect or that it makes housing options significantly more restrictive for members of a\n\nprotected group than for persons outside that group.”) (internal quotation omitted); Metropolitan\n\nHousing Development Corp. v. Village of Arlington Heights, 558 F.2d at 1290 (same);\n\nHuntington Branch, NAACP v. Town of Huntington, 844 F.2d at 937 (“The discriminatory effect\n\nof a rule arises in two contexts: adverse impact on a particular minority group and harm to the\n\ncommunity generally by the perpetuation of segregation. . . . [T]he lower court concentrated on\n\nthe harm to blacks as a group, [but] failed to consider the segregative effect of maintaining a\n\nzoning ordinance that restricts private multi-family housing to an area with a high minority\n\nconcentration.”).\n\n\n\n                                                 20\n\f               Viewing the plaintiffs’ allegations in the context of this second theory, the\n\nplaintiffs allege that the PSH program has had the effect of “closing the shelters in the\n\npredominantly white parts of the city,” 2d Am. Compl. ¶ 69, and forcing the homeless “to seek\n\nshelter in the far flung parts of the city in Anacostia, and the desolate warehouse districts of Ward\n\n5.” Id. ¶ 54. Specifically, they say that by closing La Casa (and other low-barrier shelters in the\n\nnorthwest quadrant of the city), while leaving such shelters open in the northeast and southeast\n\nquadrants and focusing its PSH placements there, the District is concentrating the predominantly\n\nminority homeless population in the areas of the city with the highest minority populations and\n\nremoving them from the areas with a higher Caucasian population. Through an exhibit attached\n\nto their complaint, the plaintiffs seek to demonstrate that former La Casa residents have been\n\ndisplaced from census tracks characterized by a diverse (and significantly Caucasian) population\n\nto census tracks where the remaining low-barrier shelters are located that are between 94% and\n\n99% Black. 2d Am. Compl., Exh. 4. The plaintiffs also seek to show that homeless individuals\n\nwho have been placed in permanent supportive housing have been assigned to census tracks that\n\nrange from 94% to 98% Black. Id.12 These are allegations of a racially segregative effect, which\n\ncourts have recognized as a form of disparate impact under the FHA.\n\n               Whether or not the plaintiffs ultimately can succeed in proving their disparate\n\nimpact claim, on either a disproportionate effect or segregative effect theory, the claim can\n\nsurvive a motion to dismiss. To be sure, in order to prevail the plaintiffs likely will need to\n\nprovide statistical analyses supporting their allegation that the District’s conduct has had a\n\n\n\n       12\n                 See also 2d Am. Compl. ¶ 72 (“Former residents are relegated to now seek shelter\n. . . in the most distant and poorest parts of the city.”); id. ¶ 77 (“Most PSH placements have\noccurred in the poorest and most violent parts of town[.]”).\n\n                                                 21\n\fracially disproportionate or segregative effect. See Cinnamon Hills Youth Crisis Ctr., Inc. v.\n\nSaint George City, 685 F.3d 917, 922 (10th Cir. 2012); Hallmark Developers, Inc. v. Fulton\n\nCounty, Ga., 466 F.3d 1276, 1286 (11th Cir. 2006); Tsombanidis v. W. Haven Fire Dept., 352\n\nF.3d 565, 575 (2d Cir. 2003); Graoch Associates # 33, L.P. v. Louisville/Jefferson County Metro\n\nHuman Relations Comm’n, 508 F.3d at 378. With respect to any segregative effect theory,\n\nproving the displacement of homeless persons will not suffice; rather, the plaintiffs will need to\n\ndemonstrate that the closure of La Casa had a measurable impact on the racial composition of the\n\ncity’s wards or neighborhoods. As skeptical as the Court is that the plaintiffs’ claim has any\n\nchance of success, that is a matter for summary judgment. See Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550\n\nU.S. at 556 (stating that a complaint alleging sufficient facts may proceed even if it strikes a\n\njudge that “actual proof of those facts is improbable, and ‘that a recovery is very remote and\n\nunlikely’”) (quoting Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232, 236 (1974)).\n\n               The Court therefore concludes that the plaintiffs’ claim for disparate impact based\n\non race under the FHA can survive a motion to dismiss.\n\n\n               D. Disparate Impact Based on Disability under the FHA (Count IV)\n\n               Courts that recognize the availability of disparate impact claims under the FHA\n\nhave permitted such claims with respect to disability discrimination as well as racial\n\ndiscrimination. E.g., Reg’l Econ. Cmty. Action Program, Inc. v. City of Middletown, 294 F.3d\n\n35, 48 (2d Cir. 2002); Keys Youth Services, Inc. v. City of Olathe, KS, 248 F.3d 1267, 1272\n\n(10th Cir. 2001); Smith & Lee Assocs., Inc. v. City of Taylor, 102 F.3d 781, 790 (6th Cir. 1996).\n\nThe plaintiffs in this case, however, have alleged no facts that would support a disparate impact\n\ndisability claim, nor have they articulated any viable theory by which such a claim can succeed.\n\n\n                                                 22\n\f               The proposed second amended complaint states in a conclusory fashion that\n\n“[p]laintiffs are a protected class under the FHA, mentally disabled, physically disabled and\n\nsuffering from substance abuse.” 2d Am. Compl. ¶¶ 89, 101; see also id. ¶ 54 (listing disabilities\n\nallegedly suffered by “[n]umerous residents” of La Casa, but making no allegations about the\n\nplaintiffs). The complaint provides no detailed allegations about any disabilities suffered by any\n\nof the plaintiffs; the closest it comes to doing so is by providing declarations in which some\n\nplaintiffs identify health conditions from which they suffer but provide no further information.\n\nThe complaint makes no allegations about what percentage of La Casa residents were disabled,\n\nnor about the percentage among the city’s homeless population at large. It simply states that\n\n“[f]ormer residents of La Casa Shelter include those with compromised physical and mental\n\ncapacities[.]” 2d Am. Compl. ¶ 75.\n\n               The mere fact that many residents of La Casa may have possessed a disability —\n\nwhich is all that the plaintiffs have alleged — does not mean that the closure of the shelter had a\n\ndisproportionate effect on the disabled under the FHA. See HDC, LLC v. City of Ann Arbor,\n\n675 F.3d 608, 613 (6th Cir. 2012) (“While the developers allegedly sought to build housing for\n\nhandicapped individuals, the developers’ project also planned to house the chronic homeless and\n\nother low-income individuals. Given the breadth of the type of individuals that the developers’\n\nproposed project would have housed, the mere fact that Ann Arbor terminated the contract . . .\n\nwould not necessarily have caused handicapped individuals to suffer disproportionately more\n\nthan other individuals[.]”); Tsombanidis v. W. Haven Fire Dept., 352 F.3d at 576 (“The district\n\ncourt merely required plaintiffs to show they could not live in the house they desired because of\n\nthe [zoning] code and that plaintiffs needed this type of housing due to their handicap. The\n\n\n\n                                                23\n\fcourt’s analysis would appear to apply to any facially neutral housing policy that prevents a\n\nhandicapped person from living in a particular house. Such a standard is not sufficient for\n\ndisparate impact purposes.”).\n\n               The plaintiffs’ allegations, accepted as true, thus cannot support a finding that the\n\nclosure of La Casa had a disproportionate effect on the disabled. None of the plaintiffs’\n\nallegations support a “segregative effect” theory with respect to disability, as opposed to race, see\n\nsupra at 20-21, nor does such a theory appear to have been adopted by other courts with respect\n\nto disability or make sense in that context. The plaintiffs’ claim for disparate impact\n\ndiscrimination under the FHA based on disability, therefore, does not state a claim upon which\n\nrelief can be granted and cannot survive a motion to dismiss.\n\n\n                        E. Disparate Treatment under the ADA (Count V)\n\n               Title II of the ADA provides that “no qualified individual with a disability shall,\n\nby reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the\n\nservices, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such\n\nentity.” 42 U.S.C. § 12132. The term “public entity” includes state and local governments and\n\nany department or agency thereof, 42 U.S.C. § 12131(1), and the term “disability” means “a\n\nphysical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such\n\nindividual,” “a record of such an impairment,” or “being regarded as having such an\n\nimpairment.” 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1); see Singh v. George Washington Univ. Sch. of Med. &\n\nHealth Sciences, 508 F.3d 1097, 1099 (D.C. Cir. 2007).13 A major life activity within the\n\n       13\n               The term “qualified individual with a disability” means “an individual with a\ndisability who, with or without reasonable modifications to rules, policies, or practices, the\nremoval of architectural, communication, or transportation barriers, or the provision of auxiliary\n\n                                                 24\n\fmeaning of the statute is one that is “central importance to most people’s daily lives,” and the\n\nimpairment “must also be permanent or long term.” Toyota Motor Mfg., Kentucky, Inc. v.\n\nWilliams, 534 U.S. 184, 198 (2002). In order to prove that a public program violates Title II, a\n\nplaintiff must show that (1) he or she is a qualified individual with a disability; (2) he or she was\n\neither excluded from participation in or denied the benefits of a public entity’s services, programs\n\nor activities, or was otherwise discriminated against by the public entity; and (3) such exclusion,\n\ndenial of benefits, or discrimination was by reason of his or her disability. Equal Rights Ctr. v.\n\nDist. of Columbia, 741 F. Supp. 2d 273, 283 (D.D.C. 2010).\n\n               The District contends that the plaintiffs’ ADA claims must fail at the outset\n\nbecause the plaintiffs “have made no factual allegations that would enable the Court to find that a\n\nsingle plaintiff is a member of a protected class on the basis of his disability.” Opp. Am. at 3.\n\nAs described above, supra at 23, the plaintiffs have provided only minimal information about\n\ntheir alleged disabilities, in the form of declarations from several plaintiffs that name a health\n\ncondition without providing more detail about the nature or severity of that condition.\n\nHighlighting this paucity of information, the District argues that the plaintiffs “fail to provide any\n\nallegations or evidence demonstrating that they are substantially limited by their alleged\n\ndisabilities.” Op. Am. at 3. These “generalized statements,” according to the District, “are\n\ninsufficient to identify even [these] plaintiffs as disabled” because the statements do not “provide\n\nany information from which one can conclude that their physical or psychological complaints\n\n\n\n\naids and services, meets the essential eligibility requirements for the receipt of services or the\nparticipation in programs or activities provided by a public entity.” 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131(2).\n\n                                                 25\n\fsubstantially limit one or more major life activities as the [ADA] require[s].” Id. at 3, 8.14\n\n               In the District’s view, to survive a motion to dismiss a plaintiff cannot merely\n\nclaim to suffer from a particular impairment, but instead must specifically plead that the\n\nimpairment substantially limits one or more major life activities of the plaintiff, or allege facts\n\nsupporting such a finding. The District cites no authority imposing such a requirement at the\n\nmotion to dismiss stage. As it turns out, authority is mixed on that question, see E.E.O.C. v. J.H.\n\nRouth Packing Co., 246 F.3d 850, 852 (6th Cir. 2001), and the contrary view appears to have the\n\nbetter of the argument, having garnered support from several federal circuits. See Fowler v.\n\nUPMC Shadyside, 578 F.3d 203, 213-14 (3d Cir. 2009); E.E.O.C. v. J.H. Routh Packing Co.,\n\n246 F.3d at 854; Menkowitz v. Pottstown Memorial Medical Center, 154 F.3d 113, 117-18 n.2\n\n(3d Cir. 1998); E.E.O.C. v. Browning Ferris, Inc., 225 F.3d 653 (4th Cir. 2000) (unpublished);\n\nDuda v. Bd. of Educ. of Franklin Park Pub. Sch. Dist. No. 84, 133 F.3d 1054, 1059 (7th Cir.\n\n1998); see also Rohm v. Homer, 367 F. Supp. 2d 1278, 1283 (N.D. Cal. 2005); E.E.O.C. v. Nw.\n\nAirlines, Inc., 216 F. Supp. 2d 935, 938-39 (D. Minn. 2002); but see Puckett v. Park Place\n\nEntm’t Corp., 332 F. Supp. 2d 1349, 1355 (D. Nev. 2004); Chille v. United Airlines, 192 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 27, 29-30 (W.D.N.Y. 2001); Saunders v. Baltimore County, Md., 163 F. Supp. 2d 564,\n\n567-69 (D. Md. 2001). This Court is persuaded by the decisions holding that specific allegations\n\nabout the limitation of a major life activity caused by the plaintiff’s impairment are not required\n\nto survive a motion to dismiss.15\n\n\n       14\n           The District makes the same argument with respect to the plaintiffs’ FHA and\nDCHRA disability claims. Opp. Am. at 3.\n       15\n               While some of these decisions expressly rely on pre-Iqbal pleading standards, the\nThird Circuit has stated that its conclusion is valid “even after Twombly and Iqbal.” Fowler v.\nUPMC Shadyside, 578 F.3d at 214.\n\n                                                 26\n\f                This conclusion does not help the plaintiffs, however, because the Court\n\nconcludes that their claim fails for a different reason: it is indistinguishable from the plaintiffs’\n\nclaim for disparate treatment based on disability under the FHA, which the Court already has\n\nconcluded fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. See supra at 14-16. For the\n\nsame reasons, the plaintiffs’ disparate treatment ADA claim cannot survive a motion to dismiss.\n\n\n                          F. Disparate Impact under the ADA (Count VI)\n\n                Disparate impact claims are cognizable under the ADA. Raytheon Co. v.\n\nHernandez, 540 U.S. 44, 53 (2003). Where such claims involve housing, courts have applied the\n\nsame analysis used for disparate impact claims based on disability under the FHA. E.g.,\n\nTsombanidis v. W. Haven Fire Dept., 352 F.3d at 574-78. In this case, the plaintiffs’ disparate\n\nimpact ADA claim suffers from the same flaw as their disparate impact FHA disability claim —\n\nnamely the absence of any allegations in the complaint plausibly supporting a claim for disparate\n\nimpact discrimination on the basis of disability. See supra at 22-24. This claim therefore cannot\n\nsurvive a motion to dismiss.\n\n\n         G. Place of Residence Discrimination under the DCHRA (Counts VII and VIII)\n\n                The plaintiffs bring claims for disparate treatment and disparate impact based on\n\nplace of residence under the DCHRA. See D.C. Code § 2-1401.01 et seq. Recovery is available\n\nunder the DCHRA on both disparate treatment and disparate impact theories. 2922 Sherman\n\nAvenue Tenants’ Ass’n v. Dist. of Columbia, 444 F.3d at 685 (citing Gay Rights Coal. v.\n\nGeorgetown Univ., 536 A.2d 1, 29 (D.C. 1987)); see Am. Fed’n of State, County, Mun.\n\nEmployees Local 2401 v. Dist. of Columbia, 796 F. Supp. 2d 136, 144 (D.D.C. 2011). The\n\n\n\n                                                  27\n\fplaintiffs identify themselves as residents of “Northwest Washington, D.C.” and allege that the\n\nDistrict “intentionally discriminate[d] against [them] by closing La Casa Shelter,” and that\n\n“[o]ther similarly situated shelters in remote areas of Wards 7 and 8 were treated differently” by\n\nthe District. 2d Am. Compl. ¶¶ 122-24. They also allege that the closure of La Casa “had a\n\ndisproportionate impact on the residents of Northwest Washington, D.C.” Id. ¶ 129.\n\n               Although the plaintiffs do not identify the provision on which their claims are\n\nbased, it appears that their claims are cognizable, if at all, within either of two provisions. Under\n\nD.C. Code § 2-1402.31(a)(1), it is “an unlawful discriminatory practice” to “deny, directly or\n\nindirectly, any person the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges,\n\nadvantages, and accommodations of any place of public accommodations” if the denial is made\n\n“wholly or partially for a discriminatory reason based on the actual or perceived . . . place of\n\nresidence . . . of any individual.”16 The wholesale closure of a place of accommodation, which\n\nprevents all individuals from utilizing its benefits, does not appear to be an act that deprives any\n\nindividual person of “the full and equal enjoyment” of that place. The statute’s language clearly\n\nimplies that a violation occurs where some individuals receive the benefit of a place of\n\naccommodation while others do not (or where some individuals receive greater benefits than\n\n\n\n       16\n                  The term “place of public accommodation” is defined “broadly” under the\nDCHRA, Blodgett v. Univ. Club, 930 A.2d 210, 218 (D.C. 2007), and would seem to include\nhomeless shelters. See D.C. Code § 2-1401.02(24) (“‘Places of public accommodation’ means,”\ninter alia, “all places including in the meaning of such terms as inns, taverns, road houses, hotels,\nmotels, whether conducted for the entertainment of transient guests or for the accommodation of\nthose seeking health, recreation or rest[,] establishments dealing with goods or services of any\nkind[, and] public halls[.]”); Dean v. Dist. of Columbia, 653 A.2d 307, 319 (D.C. 1995)\n(assuming without deciding that D.C. Marriage License Bureau is a place of public\naccommodation while noting amicus curiae argument by District Human Rights Commissioners\nthat “all District of Columbia agencies are places of public accommodation, within the meaning\nof the Human Rights Act, because they provide goods and services to District residents”).\n\n                                                 28\n\fothers). Unsurprisingly, in light of the text of Section 2-1402.31(a)(1), cases dealing with that\n\nprovision have involved defendants who denied the benefit of a place of accommodation to\n\ncertain individuals — during the scope of continuing operations — while providing that same\n\nbenefit to others. E.g., Mitchell v. DCX, Inc., 274 F. Supp. 2d 33, 49 (D.D.C. 2003) (finding\n\nliability where taxi company was “significantly less likely to pick up a person requesting services\n\nfrom Anacostia than it [was] to pick up a person requesting service from another part of the\n\ncity”); Sumes v. Andres, 938 F. Supp. 9, 12-13 (D.D.C. 1996); Boy Scouts of Am. v. District of\n\nColumbia Comm’n on Human Rights, 809 A.2d 1192, 1195-96 (D.C. 2002).\n\n                Separately, D.C. Code § 2-1402.73 states that “[e]xcept as otherwise provided for\n\nby District law or when otherwise lawfully and reasonably permitted,” it is “an unlawful\n\ndiscriminatory practice for a District government agency or office to limit or refuse to provide\n\nany facility, service, program, or benefit to any individual on the basis of an individual’s actual or\n\nperceived . . . place of residence.” There is a dearth of case law respecting this provision, which\n\nbecame effective in 2002, and the Court has not located any decisions applying it. See George\n\nWashington Univ. v. Dist. of Columbia Bd. of Adjustment, 831 A.2d 921, 941 n.16 (D.C. 2003)\n\n(briefly discussing Section 2-1402.73). Nevertheless, the Court believes that it does not speak to\n\nthe allegations made by the plaintiffs.\n\n                The plaintiffs allege that the District of Columbia discriminated against them by\n\nclosing La Casa while not closing low-barrier shelters in Wards 7 and 8. 2d Am. Compl.\n\n¶¶ 123-24. But it cannot be that Section 2-1402.73 is violated simply because the District closes\n\na public assistance facility in one part of the city while failing to close similar facilities in a\n\ndifferent part of the city. Under that reasoning, virtually any decision by the District limiting or\n\n\n\n                                                   29\n\frestricting services of any kind in one quadrant, ward, or neighborhood could be challenged as\n\ndiscriminatory under the DCHRA. The same logic would seemingly allow individuals to sue\n\nover a failure to construct facilities or provide services in one part of the city where such\n\nfacilities or services are available elsewhere. This broad interpretation, which would subject an\n\nunimaginable number of routine policy decisions to litigation, cannot credibly be derived from a\n\nprovision that bars discrimination “on the basis of” place of residence or eighteen other protected\n\ntraits. As with Section 2-1401.31(a)(1), the language of Section 2-1402.73 signals a focus on the\n\nselective denial of benefits to certain persons, based on their place of residence, while those\n\nbenefits remain available to other persons. See D.C. Code § 2-1402.73 (making it unlawfully\n\ndiscriminatory to deny services “to any individual on the basis of an individual’s actual or\n\nperceived . . . place of residence”) (emphasis added). The conduct challenged here by the\n\nplaintiffs simply is not encompassed within that definition.17\n\n               In sum, the Court concludes that the plaintiffs have not stated viable claims for\n\nplace of residence discrimination under the DCHRA; those claims accordingly cannot survive a\n\nmotion to dismiss.\n\n\n               H. Disability Discrimination under the DCHRA (Counts IX and X)\n\n               The plaintiffs also bring claims for disability discrimination under the DCHRA,\n\nalleging both disparate treatment and disparate impact. The definition of “disability” under the\n\nDCHRA is virtually identical to that under the ADA and to the definition of “handicap” under\n\n\n\n       17\n               A third conceivable vehicle for the plaintiffs’ claims is D.C. Code § 2-1401.21(a),\nwhich prohibits “place of residence” discrimination with respect to housing and commercial\nspace — but every subdivision under this section addresses real estate transactions or actions\naffecting tenants or lessees; none is applicable to the closure of a homeless shelter.\n\n                                                  30\n\fthe FHA. See D.C. Code § 2-1401.02(5A). “District of Columbia courts interpreting the\n\nDCHRA ‘have generally looked [for guidance] to cases from the federal courts’ arising under\n\nfederal civil rights statutes.” Whitbeck v. Vital Signs, Inc., 116 F.3d 588, 591 (D.C. Cir. 1997)\n\n(quoting Benefits Communication Corp. v. Klieforth, 642 A.2d 1299, 1301-02 (D.C. 1994)).\n\n“Therefore, the D.C. law is applied in the same manner as the parallel federal antidiscrimination\n\nprovisions.” Paralyzed Veterans of Am. v. Ellerbe Becket Architects & Engineers, P.C., 950 F.\n\nSupp. 393, 405 (D.D.C. 1996) (citing Benefits Communication Corp. v. Klieforth, 642 A.2d at\n\n1301-02); see Chang v. Inst. for Pub.-Private Partnerships, Inc., 846 A.2d 318, 324 (D.C. 2004)\n\n(“We have considered decisions construing the ADA as persuasive in our decisions construing\n\ncomparable sections of [the] DCHRA.”) (quotation omitted).\n\n               Presumably, the plaintiffs base their claims on D.C. Code § 2-1402.31(a)(1),\n\nwhich prohibits discrimination in public accommodations based on disability, or on § 2-1402.73,\n\nwhich prohibits District agencies from refusing to provide facilities, benefits, or services on the\n\nbasis of disability. Because the language contained in these two provisions is different from the\n\nprovisions of the ADA and FHA barring disability discrimination, the DCHRA may not be\n\nentirely parallel to a federal counterpart in this respect. Yet the same problems that doom the\n\nplaintiffs’ federal disability claims, see supra at 15-16, 22-24, 27, apply with equal force to any\n\ndisability claims the plaintiffs might bring under the DCHRA. The only potentially\n\ndistinguishing feature of the plaintiffs’ DCHRA claims is that under each count the plaintiffs\n\naver, among other things, that the District “refus[ed] to accommodate their needs and requests for\n\nadequate shelter” as well as “for accessible mental health and health care services, adequate\n\nnutrition, and employment opportunity availability.” 2d Am. Compl. ¶¶ 135, 143.\n\n\n\n                                                 31\n\fNotwithstanding the plaintiffs’ use of the phrase “refusal to accommodate” in these two\n\nparagraphs, nothing in their complaint alleges a viable claim for failure to provide reasonable\n\naccommodation; rather, the plaintiffs appear to be simply characterizing the closure of La Casa\n\nand the resulting unavailability of shelter as a failure to accommodate. That contention makes\n\nlittle sense.\n\n                The Court concludes that the plaintiffs’ allegations of disability discrimination\n\nunder the DCHRA do not state a claim upon which relief can be granted, and that these claims\n\ncannot survive a motion to dismiss.\n\n\n                   I. Violation of the Homeless Service Reform Act (Count XI)\n\n                The plaintiffs seek to add a new claim to their complaint, under the District of\n\nColumbia’s Homeless Services Reform Act (“HSRA”), D.C. Code § 4-751.01 et seq. But that\n\nAct expressly states that none of its provisions “shall be construed to create an entitlement (either\n\ndirect or implied) on the part of any individual or family to any services within the Continuum of\n\nCare, other than shelter in severe weather conditions,” as authorized in one particular provision.\n\nD.C. Code § 4-755(a); see also id. § 4-751.01(8) (defining “Continuum of Care” as “the\n\ncomprehensive system of services for individuals and families who are homeless or at imminent\n\nrisk of becoming homeless,” including “shelter, transitional housing, permanent supportive\n\nhousing, and supportive services”). The District of Columbia Court of Appeals has explained\n\nthat in light of this “unambiguous[]” provision, “it is clear that there is only one statutory\n\nentitlement conveyed by the act, and that is shelter in severe or frigid weather.” Baltimore v.\n\nDist. of Columbia, 10 A.3d 1141, 1151 (D.C. 2011).\n\n\n\n\n                                                  32\n\f               “Severe weather conditions” under the HRSA means “whenever the actual or\n\nforecasted temperature, including the wind chill factor or heat index, falls below 32 degrees\n\nFahrenheit or rises above 95 degrees Fahrenheit.” D.C. Code § 4-751.01(35). The statutory\n\nentitlement to shelter in such conditions is found in D.C. Code § 4-754.11(5). While the\n\ncomplaint alleges that unspecified former La Casa residents “and other homeless in the Columbia\n\nHeights area” were denied shelter during such conditions on February 21, 2011, see 2d Am.\n\nCompl. ¶ 63, the complaint pointedly does not allege that any of the current or proposed new\n\nplaintiffs were among those denied shelter during that night, nor do any of the declarations\n\nsubmitted by plaintiffs make such a claim. The plaintiffs therefore cannot prevail on any claim\n\nunder the HRSA based on the denial of shelter.\n\n               In their opposition to the District’s motion to dismiss — although not in their\n\nproposed amended complaint or in their briefing on their motion to amend — the plaintiffs also\n\nallege that the closure of La Casa violated certain procedural rights under the HRSA, specifically\n\nthe right to an administrative hearing. See Opp. MTD at 13-14. The D.C. Court of Appeals,\n\nhowever, has rejected virtually identical claims arising from the closure of another low-barrier\n\nshelter. Baltimore v. Dist. of Columbia, 10 A.3d at 1152-53. Contrary to the plaintiffs’\n\nargument, the HRSA does not create any right to a hearing before the closure of a shelter. See id.\n\nThe Court finds that the plaintiffs’ proposed claim under the HRSA cannot survive a motion to\n\ndismiss.\n\n\n                       J. Violation of Substantive Due Process (Count XII)\n\n               Finally, the plaintiffs seek to add a count for the violation of substantive due\n\nprocess under the United States Constitution, based on the District’s alleged denial of their right\n\n\n                                                 33\n\fto housing. 2d Am. Compl. ¶¶ 158-59. “Individuals are entitled to due process, however, only if\n\nthey have a constitutionally protected property interest,” Washington Legal Clinic for the\n\nHomeless v. Barry, 107 F.3d 32, 36 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (citing Brock v. Roadway Express, Inc., 481\n\nU.S. 252, 260 (1987)), and the plaintiffs cannot derive any constitutionally protected interest in\n\nshelter either from D.C. statute or directly from the Constitution. Baltimore v. Dist. of\n\nColumbia, 10 A.3d at 1154 (citing Lindsey v. Normet, 405 U.S. 56, 74 (1972)). Even where\n\nsuch a property interest exists, “the doctrine of substantive due process constrains only egregious\n\ngovernment misconduct,” which this circuit has described as preventing only “grave unfairness,”\n\nsuch as “‘a substantial infringement of state law prompted by personal or group animus’” or “‘a\n\ndeliberate flouting of the law that trammels significant personal or property rights[.]’”\n\nGeorge Washington Univ. v. Dist. of Columbia, 318 F.3d 203, 209 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (quoting\n\nSilverman v. Barry, 845 F.2d 1072, 1080 (D.C. Cir. 1988)). The plaintiffs’ claim for a violation\n\nof substantive due process cannot survive a motion to dismiss.\n\n\n                                        IV. CONCLUSION\n\n               For the foregoing reasons, the Court has determined that only the plaintiffs’ claim\n\nfor disparate impact based on race under the FHA (Count 3) can survive a motion to dismiss.\n\nAmendment of the plaintiffs’ complaint therefore is not futile, in that the proposed second\n\namended complaint adds plaintiffs and contains one viable count. The Court therefore grants the\n\nplaintiffs’ motion to amend their complaint but dismisses all counts of the second amended\n\n\n\n\n                                                 34\n\fcomplaint except Count 3. The Court grants the defendant’s motion to dismiss the existing\n\ncomplaint.18 An Order consistent with this Opinion was issued on September 28, 2012.\n\n               SO ORDERED.\n\n                                                      /s/\n                                                     PAUL L.

See, e.g., Fox v. District of Columbia, 851 F.\nSupp. 2d 20, 39 (D.D.C. 2012). The Court has taken the more expeditious procedural route of\ngranting the motion to amend in full — allowing the proposed complaint already submitted by\nthe plaintiffs along with their motion to be docketed as the second amended complaint — while\ndismissing the counts that the Court has determined are deficient under Rule 12(b)(6).\n\n                                                35\n\f",

After\n\ncareful consideration of the parties’ filings, the relevant legal authorities, and the entire record in\n\nthis case, by Order of September 28, 2012, the Court granted the defendant’s motion to dismiss,\n\ngranted the plaintiffs’ motion to amend, and dismissed all but one count of the amended\n\ncomplaint. See Order (Sept. 28, 2012). This Opinion explains the reasoning behind that Order.2\n\n\n       1\n                Mayor Vincent Gray has been substituted as the defendant for former Mayor\nAdrian Fenty pursuant to Rule 25(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See Order at 1 n.1\n(Sept. 28, 2012). While Mayor Fenty was sued in both his individual and official capacities, the\nplaintiffs have not targeted any particular action by former Mayor Fenty but focus only on actions\nby the District of Columbia government. See Opinion at 3 n.2 (Dec. 17, 2010). Accordingly,\nAdrian Fenty has been dismissed as a defendant in this case.\n        2\n                The papers reviewed in connection with this matter include the following:\nplaintiffs’ motion to amend (“Mot. Am.”) [Dkt. No. 68]; defendant’s opposition (“Opp. Am.”)\n[Dkt. No. 69]; plaintiffs’ reply (“Reply Am.”) [Dkt. No. 71]; defendant’s motion to dismiss\nand/or motion for summary judgment (“MTD”) [Dkt. No. 29]; plaintiffs’ opposition to that\nmotion (“Opp. MTD”) [Dkt. No. 34]; defendant’s reply (“Reply MTD”) [Dkt. No. 46]; plaintiffs’\nproposed second amended complaint (“2d. Am. Compl.”) [Dkt. No. 68-1] and the exhibits\nattached thereto; and plaintiffs’ current amended complaint (“Am. Compl.”) [Dkt. No. 15].\n\f                                        I. BACKGROUND\n\n               This action was commenced in October 2010 on behalf of nine individual\n\nplaintiffs who formerly inhabited La Casa Shelter, an emergency, low-barrier housing facility for\n\nthe homeless that was located in the Columbia Heights neighborhood of the District of\n\nColumbia. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 2-14. La Casa, the facilities of which consisted of portable trailers,\n\nwas operated by a contractor of the District of Columbia until October 15, 2010, when the shelter\n\nwas closed at the direction of the District. See Memorandum Opinion and Order at 2 (Aug. 3,\n\n2011). The District says that its closure of La Casa was part of its efforts to expand its\n\nPermanent Supportive Housing (“PSH”) program, which involves the placement of chronically\n\nhomeless individuals in permanent housing where they can gain access to long-term supportive\n\nservices. Id. According to the plaintiffs, the District uses the PSH program “as an excuse for\n\nclosing the shelters in the predominantly white parts of the city.” Id. The plaintiffs brought\n\nclaims of discrimination based on race, disability, and place of residence under the Fair Housing\n\nAct, 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601 et seq., the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 et seq.,\n\nand the District of Columbia Human Rights Act, D.C. Code §§ 2-1401.01 et seq., alleging that\n\nthe District is “systematically removing persons who are disabled, indigent, and predominantly\n\nminority” from areas inhabited by “the most affluent, white populations” in the city, and placing\n\nthose homeless individuals in poorer neighborhoods “with the least resources available.” Id. at\n\n2-3. In support of these claims, the plaintiffs have noted that La Casa was the “last remaining\n\npublic shelter in Ward 1” and that Wards 2, 3, and 4 of the District already lacked public shelters.\n\nId.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  2\n\f                The plaintiffs’ complaint was accompanied by a motion requesting a temporary\n\nrestraining order and both preliminary and permanent injunctive relief. See Plaintiffs[’] Motion\n\nfor Temporary Restraining Order, Preliminary and Permanent Injunctions [Dkt. No. 11].\n\nTreating the motion as a request for an immediate temporary restraining order, a motions judge\n\npromptly denied it, stating that the plaintiffs’ asserted injuries “provides no basis for entering an\n\nemergency injunction before the District may be heard on the matter.” Memorandum and Order\n\nat 2 (Oct. 22, 2010). The plaintiffs filed an amended motion in November 2010, seeking\n\npreliminary injunctive relief. This Court denied that motion upon concluding that the plaintiffs\n\nhad not satisfied the four-part standard necessary to obtain such relief. See Opinion (Dec. 17,\n\n2010). In particular, the Court found no substantial likelihood that the plaintiffs were likely to\n\nsucceed on their claims. Id. at 6-11.\n\n               In December 2010, the District of Columbia filed its motion to dismiss or, in the\n\nalternative, for summary judgment. Over the next several months, however, the plaintiffs filed\n\nfour separate motions to amend their complaint, which they already had amended once as of\n\nright.3 Explaining that it did not intend to review four separate and likely redundant motions, the\n\nCourt denied without prejudice the motions to amend and directed the plaintiffs instead to file a\n\nsingle motion specifically identifying all proposed changes to the complaint. See Memorandum\n\n\n\n\n       3\n                The plaintiffs also filed a motion to reconsider the Court’s denial of the plaintiffs’\nmotion for a preliminary injunction, a motion for leave to file a reply out of time, a motion for\nleave to file documents under seal, two motions for discovery, and one motion “to supplement\nthe record” — prompting the District to file a motion to preclude the plaintiffs from filing further\nmotions without the Court’s leave, which the Court denied without prejudice. See Memorandum\nOpinion and Order (Aug. 3, 2011).\n\n                                                  3\n\fOpinion and Order at 3-4 (Aug. 3, 2011). The plaintiffs subsequently filed their pending motion\n\nto amend.\n\n               In their proposed second amended complaint, the plaintiffs seek to add thirty-three\n\nnew plaintiffs to the action, to provide additional information relating to their claims, and to add\n\ntwo new claims, arising under the District of Columbia’s Homeless Services Reform Act, D.C.\n\nCode § 4-751 et seq., and the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution. Mot. Am. at\n\n2, 5-7; see 2d Am. Compl.4 The District opposes the plaintiffs’ motion, arguing that the\n\nproposed amendment is futile.\n\n\n                                    II.

If La\n\nCasa qualifies as a “dwelling” under this provision, then its closure would appear to “make [it]\n\nunavailable” to its former inhabitants and “deny” them a dwelling there within the meaning of\n\nthe FHA.

Rule 10 provides only that a\n“statement in a pleading may be adopted by reference . . . in any other pleading or motion.” FED .\nR. CIV . P. 10(c) (emphasis added).

Finally, in assessing the sufficiency\nof this complaint, the Court will not consider factual allegations made by the plaintiffs\nexclusively in their briefing, as opposed to within the proposed complaint itself. The plaintiffs\nhave had ample opportunity to fashion a comprehensive complaint, and ample warnings about\nthe consequences of failing to do so.\n        6\n             Unless otherwise noted, references to counts in the complaint are to the proposed\nsecond amended complaint [Dkt.

In support, the District cites only two decisions, one of which did not\n\nrule on the issue at all, but instead assumed without deciding that homeless shelters do qualify as\n\ndwellings under the Act, while expressing some doubt about that point.

Code\n\n§ 4-751.01(26) in support of its contention that such shelters constitute “transient” housing\n\n\n       7\n               The FHA defines a “dwelling” as “any building, structure, or portion thereof\nwhich is occupied as, or designed or intended for occupancy as, a residence by one or more\nfamilies, and any vacant land which is offered for sale or lease for the construction or location\nthereon of any such building, structure, or portion thereof.” 42 U.S.C. § 3602(b).

This\n\ndefinition undermines the District’s argument that La Casa “was neither intended nor designed\n\nfor long term stay,” MTD at 24, a claim that is further belied by the plaintiffs’ declarations\n\nattesting to their habitual and regular stay at La Casa. See 2d Am. Compl., Exh. 1.; cf.\n\nIntermountain Fair Hous. Council v. Boise Rescue Mission Ministries, 717 F.

Furthermore, the District concedes that at least\n\nthree decisions have applied the FHA to homeless shelters, while maintaining that these\n\ndecisions “have not squarely addressed whether all homeless shelters constitute a ‘dwelling’\n\nunder the FHA.” MTD at 23.\n\n               Mindful that “the FHA should be broadly construed to effectuate its remedial\n\npurpose,” Nat’l Fair Hous.

The Supreme Court has\n\nexplained that “a court considering a motion to dismiss can choose to begin by identifying\n\npleadings that, because they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of\n\ntruth. While legal conclusions can provide the framework of a complaint, they must be\n\nsupported by factual allegations.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679.\n\n               Here, the plaintiffs allege that the District intentionally discriminated against them\n\nbased on their race. 2d Am. Compl. ¶ 85. In support of this claim, they offer only the bare\n\nassertion that the District’s PSH program “has been used as an excuse for closing the shelters in\n\nthe predominantly white parts of the city.” Id. ¶ 69. The plaintiffs describe in detail the\n\nhardships suffered by former residents of La Casa, and they make a number of allegations\n\nregarding the general state of homelessness and poverty in Washington, D.C., and the inadequate\n\nimplementation of the PSH program. Id. ¶¶ 54-55, 61, 63-67, 71-79. Entirely missing are any\n\nfactual allegations that would support their stark accusation of intentional discrimination based\n\non race. A complaint does not suffice “if it tenders ‘naked assertion[s]’ devoid of ‘further factual\n\nenhancement.’” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550\n\nU.S. at 557). The plaintiffs have made no allegations that, accepted as true, could serve as\n\n“direct evidence of discriminatory intent,” Hall v. Giant Food, Inc., 175 F.3d at 1077, nor that\n\ncould “permit an inference of discrimination.” Id. Without any supporting factual allegations,\n\nthe plaintiffs’ assertions reduce to mere legal conclusions that are not entitled to the assumption\n\nof truth. See Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556-57 (holding that “bare assertion of\n\nconspiracy” and “conclusory allegation of agreement at some unidentified point does not supply\n\nfacts adequate to show illegality”); Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 680 (stating that in Twombly,\n\n\n\n                                                 11\n\f“the plaintiffs’ assertion of an unlawful agreement was a ‘legal conclusion’ and, as such, was not\n\nentitled to the assumption of truth”). The scant facts alleged in the plaintiffs’ proposed second\n\namended complaint do not “plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.” Id.\n\n               The plaintiffs’ proposed new complaint (unlike their earlier efforts) includes the\n\nrace of each plaintiff, all of whom are African American or Hispanic, with the exception of one\n\nindividual who is described as Pakastani. 2d Am. Compl. ¶¶ 2-43. Aside from this, the only\n\ninformation of any relevance that the plaintiffs propose adding is to include “more specific\n\nallegations of the racial composition areas in which La Casa and other recently closed shelters\n\nwere located as compared with the racial composition of the areas in which the remaining\n\nshelters and PSH placements that have been disclosed are located.” Mot. Am. at 2; see 2d Am.\n\nCompl., Exh. 4. The Court already has explained why such demographic information, without\n\nmore, fails to supply either direct evidence of discriminatory intent or an inference of\n\ndiscrimination. Opinion at 8-9 (Dec. 17, 2010). The plaintiffs therefore are merely proposing to\n\nadd “more specific allegations” about a matter that cannot alone prove their claim. The facts\n\nalleged in the proposed second amended complaint about the racial composition of various\n\ncensus tracks within the city do not satisfy “[t]he need at the pleading stage for allegations\n\nplausibly suggesting (not merely consistent with)” intentional racial discrimination on the part of\n\nthe District. Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. at 557. Because this information does not\n\nprovide “enough fact[s] to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of\n\nillegal [conduct],” therefore “without some further factual enhancement it stops short of the line\n\nbetween possibility and plausibility of ‘entitle[ment] to relief.’” Id. (quoting FED . R. CIV . P.\n\n8(a)(2)).\n\n\n\n                                                  12\n\f               The plaintiffs seek to add other new information in support of their claim,\n\ncontained in exhibits to the proposed complaint, but this information patently does not possess\n\nthe significance they attribute to it. The plaintiffs, for instance, provide a Mayor’s Report on\n\nSupportive Housing Placements and Emergency Shelter, purportedly from September 2010,\n\nwhich is offered to show “the census tracks of relocations in Permanent Supportive Housing of\n\nFormer La Casa Shelter inhabitants.” 2d. Am. Compl., Exh. 5. The geographic disbursement\n\nwithin the city of people who formerly resided at La Casa could indeed help demonstrate that\n\n“homeless individuals, predominantly people of color, have been forced to move in significant\n\nnumbers from Wards 1 or 2 ‘to wards which are highest in minority population’ because of the\n\nclosures of La Casa.” Opinion at 9 (Dec. 17, 2010) (quoting plaintiffs’ reply memorandum). In\n\nconjunction with other factual allegations, perhaps such information might support an inference\n\nof discriminatory intent behind the policies that led to this disbursal. But the report offered by\n\nthe plaintiffs is actually from September 2008, predating the closure of La Casa by two years.\n\nTherefore it cannot shed light on the disbursement within the city of individuals who formerly\n\nresided at La Casa through the PSH program. Similarly, the plaintiffs cite a press release from\n\nthe Downtown DC Business Improvement District describing the efforts of its Downtown\n\nHomeless Outreach Team, which according to the plaintiffs “report[s] a decrease in the homeless\n\non the streets of downtown DC at night from 93 in 2009 to 73 in 2010.” See 2d Am. Compl.,\n\nExh. 6. This report also covers the period before the closure of La Casa (and attributes the\n\ndecrease to the outreach team’s engagement efforts). Id. The point here is not that the plaintiffs\n\nhave failed to meet an evidentiary burden, but rather that, in lieu of the needed factual allegations\n\n\n\n\n                                                 13\n\fsupporting the plausibility of their claim for intentional racial discrimination, they have supplied\n\ndata contributing nothing to support that claim’s plausibility.\n\n                None of the other information that the plaintiffs seek to add to their complaint has\n\nany bearing on the District’s allegedly discriminatory intent. See Mot. Am. at 2, 5-7; 2d Am.\n\nCompl., Exhs. 1-16. The Court finds that the plaintiffs’ claim for disparate treatment under the\n\nFHA based on race lacks the plausibility required to survive a motion to dismiss.\n\n\n              B. Disparate Treatment Based on Disability under the FHA (Count II)\n\n                The plaintiffs allege that in closing La Casa the District intentionally\n\ndiscriminated against them because of their disabilities. The declarations submitted by eight\n\nproposed plaintiffs indicate that they suffer from health problems that may or may not qualify as\n\na “handicap” within the meaning of the FHA. See 2d Am. Compl., Exh. 1.8\n\n                At the outset, it is not entirely clear to the Court how the plaintiffs’ claim is\n\ncognizable within the language of the FHA. It is unlawful under the Act “[t]o discriminate in the\n\nsale or rental, or to otherwise make unavailable or deny, a dwelling to any buyer or renter\n\nbecause of a handicap of . . . a person residing in or intending to reside in that dwelling after it is\n\n. . . made available.” 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(1)(B). The former residents of La Casa were neither\n\nbuyers nor renters of that property, which the parties agree was owned by the District until it was\n\nsold to a private developer. 2d Am. Compl. ¶¶ 46, 47. The FHA also makes it unlawful “[t]o\n\n       8\n                “‘Handicap’ means, with respect to a person . . . a physical or mental impairment\nwhich substantially limits one or more of such person's major life activities, a record of having\nsuch an impairment, or being regarded as having such an impairment.” 42 U.S.C. § 3602(h).\nThe District contends that none of the plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged their possession of a\n“handicap” within the meaning of the FHA. That contention is addressed below, infra at 25-26,\nin the context of the plaintiffs’ claims under the ADA, which employs a nearly identical\ndefinition for “disability.”\n\n                                                  14\n\fdiscriminate against any person . . . in the provision of services or facilities in connection with [a]\n\ndwelling, because of a handicap of . . . that person.” 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(2)(A). Assuming again\n\nthat La Casa qualifies as a “dwelling” under the FHA, see supra at 7-9, if the District closed La\n\nCasa in order to discriminate against its residents on the basis of their disabilities, then that act\n\nperhaps could qualify as discriminating against La Casa’s disabled residents “in the provision of\n\nservices or facilities in connection with” their former dwelling because of their handicap. While\n\nthe Court will assume that such a reading is tenable, it notes that the language of the provision as\n\na whole appears to evince an exclusive concern with the sale and rental of properties and the\n\nprovision of services to renters.9\n\n                Even if the plaintiffs’ claim for intentional disability discrimination is cognizable\n\nwithin the FHA, however, the claim suffers from the same flaw as their claim for intentional race\n\ndiscrimination under the Act: the plaintiffs have not alleged “sufficient factual matter, accepted\n\nas true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678\n\n(quoting Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570). Indeed, the plaintiffs’ claim of\n\nintentional disability discrimination is even more infirm than their claim of intentional race\n\ndiscrimination.

Disproportionate Effect\n\n               “[T]o prove a disparate impact claim . . . a plaintiff must first demonstrate that the\n\nchallenged policy or practice has a disproportionate effect on a protected class.” 2922 Sherman\n\nAvenue Tenants’ Ass’n v. Dist. of Columbia, 444 F.3d at 679. The parties express different\n\nviews on the correct framework for that inquiry in this case. The plaintiffs appear to allege that\n\nsimply because the homeless population that frequented La Casa was predominantly African\n\nAmerican and Hispanic, the closure of that shelter had a disproportionate effect on those two\n\nracial groups. See 2d Am. Compl. ¶¶ 95-97. The District suggests that the plaintiffs instead\n\nmust show “that the closing of La Casa disproportionately affected minorities . . . either vis-à-vis\n\nthe population at the La Casa shelter or vis-à-vis the homeless population within the District as a\n\nwhole.” Opp. Am. at 11; see MTD at 19 (stating that plaintiffs must articulate supporting facts\n\nsuggesting that members of racial minorities “frequent[ed] La Casa at a higher rate than other\n\nshelters in the city”). In other words, the District contends that a finding of disparate impact\n\nrequires showing that the closure of La Casa (1) affected its minority residents more than its\n\nCaucasian residents, or (2) disproportionately affected minorities within the overall homeless\n\npopulation as compared with the Caucasians in that population.\n\n               Other circuits have held that where the population relying on or in need of\n\nhousing assistance is disproportionately composed of racial minorities, a decision adversely\n\naffecting the availability of that assistance has a disproportionate impact on a protected class,\n\nsubjecting the decision to disparate impact analysis. “Where a plaintiff demonstrates that a\n\n\n                                                 17\n\fprotected group depends on low-income housing to a greater extent than the non-protected\n\npopulation . . . courts have found it reasonable to infer that the protected group will experience a\n\ndisproportionate adverse effect from a policy or decision that reduces low-income housing.”\n\nGallagher v.

In 2922\n\nSherman Avenue Tenants’ Ass’n v. Dist. of Columbia, 444 F.3d at 681, the court cited the\n\nSecond Circuit’s Huntington Branch decision as an example of a case in which the plaintiffs\n\ndemonstrated disproportionate effect. See id. (stating that the Huntington plaintiffs “presented\n\nevidence that although only 5 percent of the town’s population was minority, each of the town’s\n\nthree housing projects had between 30 and 95 percent minority residents”) (citing Huntington\n\n\n\n                                                 18\n\fBranch, NAACP v. Town of Huntington, 844 F.2d at 929). The court in 2922 Sherman Avenue\n\nrejected the disparate impact claim before it because the plaintiffs did not prove at trial, as they\n\nhad alleged, that certain buildings targeted for closure by the District were disproportionately\n\nHispanic. Id.10\n\n                  In light of the available case law and the absence of precedent from our circuit, the\n\nCourt is not convinced that the plaintiffs can succeed, as the District contends, only by showing\n\nthat white residents of La Casa were more affected by its closure than were minority residents, or\n\nthat La Casa housed a higher percentage of minorities than other shelters. If a disproportionately\n\nhigh percentage of the homeless population in Washington, D.C., is minority, then action by the\n\nDistrict adversely affecting that population could state a claim for disparate impact. Cf.\n\nMetropolitan Housing Development Corp. v. Village of Arlington Heights, 558 F.2d at 1288\n\n(“Because a greater number of black people than white people in the Chicago metropolitan area\n\nsatisfy the income requirements for federally subsidized housing, the Village’s refusal to permit\n\nMHDC to construct the project had a greater impact on black people than on white people.”).11\n\n\n       10\n                Note, however, the court’s statement that because it reached this conclusion, it\n“need not consider the District’s argument that the tenants’ disparate impact claim fails for lack\nof ‘evidence of a relevant comparison group — i.e., persons unaffected by the policy who were\nnot in the protected group and who were similarly [situated].’” 2922 Sherman Ave. Tenants’\nAss’n v. Dist. of Columbia, 444 F.3d at 681 (quoting the District’s brief).\n       11\n                 The Court acknowledges that the cases discussed above involve government\naction affecting all persons within a community who need low-income housing, and that these\ncases do not necessarily apply with equal force to government action that affects a much smaller\nportion of the community. In the former scenario, because of the relatively large percentage of\npeople affected by the government’s action (out of the entire community), any racial imbalance\nin the effect of that action “makes housing options significantly more restrictive for members of a\nprotected group than for persons outside that group.” Hallmark Developers, Inc. v. Fulton\nCounty, Ga., 466 F.3d at 1286. The smaller the affected population, however, the less readily it\ncan be said that a racially disproportionate effect within that population affects housing options\nfor the racial group as a whole.\n\n                                                   19\n\f                                      2. “Segregative Effect”\n\n               In addition, other circuits have held that demonstrating a disproportionate effect\n\non a protected class is only one way to make out a disparate impact housing discrimination claim.\n\nThese circuits hold that there are “two types of discriminatory effects which a facially neutral\n\nhousing decision can have.” Graoch Associates # 33, L.P. v.

Compl. ¶ 69, and forcing the homeless “to seek\n\nshelter in the far flung parts of the city in Anacostia, and the desolate warehouse districts of Ward\n\n5.” Id. ¶ 54. Specifically, they say that by closing La Casa (and other low-barrier shelters in the\n\nnorthwest quadrant of the city), while leaving such shelters open in the northeast and southeast\n\nquadrants and focusing its PSH placements there, the District is concentrating the predominantly\n\nminority homeless population in the areas of the city with the highest minority populations and\n\nremoving them from the areas with a higher Caucasian population. Through an exhibit attached\n\nto their complaint, the plaintiffs seek to demonstrate that former La Casa residents have been\n\ndisplaced from census tracks characterized by a diverse (and significantly Caucasian) population\n\nto census tracks where the remaining low-barrier shelters are located that are between 94% and\n\n99% Black. 2d Am.

The plaintiffs also seek to show that homeless individuals\n\nwho have been placed in permanent supportive housing have been assigned to census tracks that\n\nrange from 94% to 98% Black.

With respect to any segregative effect theory,\n\nproving the displacement of homeless persons will not suffice; rather, the plaintiffs will need to\n\ndemonstrate that the closure of La Casa had a measurable impact on the racial composition of the\n\ncity’s wards or neighborhoods.

Am. at 3. These “generalized statements,” according to the District, “are\n\ninsufficient to identify even [these] plaintiffs as disabled” because the statements do not “provide\n\nany information from which one can conclude that their physical or psychological complaints\n\n\n\n\naids and services, meets the essential eligibility requirements for the receipt of services or the\nparticipation in programs or activities provided by a public entity.” 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131(2).\n\n                                                 25\n\fsubstantially limit one or more major life activities as the [ADA] require[s].” Id. at 3, 8.14\n\n               In the District’s view, to survive a motion to dismiss a plaintiff cannot merely\n\nclaim to suffer from a particular impairment, but instead must specifically plead that the\n\nimpairment substantially limits one or more major life activities of the plaintiff, or allege facts\n\nsupporting such a finding.

This Court is persuaded by the decisions holding that specific allegations\n\nabout the limitation of a major life activity caused by the plaintiff’s impairment are not required\n\nto survive a motion to dismiss.15\n\n\n       14\n           The District makes the same argument with respect to the plaintiffs’ FHA and\nDCHRA disability claims. Opp. Am. at 3.\n       15\n               While some of these decisions expressly rely on pre-Iqbal pleading standards, the\nThird Circuit has stated that its conclusion is valid “even after Twombly and Iqbal.” Fowler v.\nUPMC Shadyside, 578 F.3d at 214.\n\n                                                 26\n\f                This conclusion does not help the plaintiffs, however, because the Court\n\nconcludes that their claim fails for a different reason: it is indistinguishable from the plaintiffs’\n\nclaim for disparate treatment based on disability under the FHA, which the Court already has\n\nconcluded fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. See supra at 14-16. For the\n\nsame reasons, the plaintiffs’ disparate treatment ADA claim cannot survive a motion to dismiss.\n\n\n                          F. Disparate Impact under the ADA (Count VI)\n\n                Disparate impact claims are cognizable under the ADA.

Where such claims involve housing, courts have applied the\n\nsame analysis used for disparate impact claims based on disability under the FHA. E.g.,\n\nTsombanidis v. W. Haven Fire Dept., 352 F.3d at 574-78. In this case, the plaintiffs’ disparate\n\nimpact ADA claim suffers from the same flaw as their disparate impact FHA disability claim —\n\nnamely the absence of any allegations in the complaint plausibly supporting a claim for disparate\n\nimpact discrimination on the basis of disability. See supra at 22-24. This claim therefore cannot\n\nsurvive a motion to dismiss.\n\n\n         G. Place of Residence Discrimination under the DCHRA (Counts VII and VIII)\n\n                The plaintiffs bring claims for disparate treatment and disparate impact based on\n\nplace of residence under the DCHRA.

They also allege that the closure of La Casa “had a\n\ndisproportionate impact on the residents of Northwest Washington, D.C.” Id. ¶ 129.\n\n               Although the plaintiffs do not identify the provision on which their claims are\n\nbased, it appears that their claims are cognizable, if at all, within either of two provisions. Under\n\nD.C. Code § 2-1402.31(a)(1), it is “an unlawful discriminatory practice” to “deny, directly or\n\nindirectly, any person the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges,\n\nadvantages, and accommodations of any place of public accommodations” if the denial is made\n\n“wholly or partially for a discriminatory reason based on the actual or perceived . . . place of\n\nresidence . . . of any individual.”16 The wholesale closure of a place of accommodation, which\n\nprevents all individuals from utilizing its benefits, does not appear to be an act that deprives any\n\nindividual person of “the full and equal enjoyment” of that place. The statute’s language clearly\n\nimplies that a violation occurs where some individuals receive the benefit of a place of\n\naccommodation while others do not (or where some individuals receive greater benefits than\n\n\n\n       16\n                  The term “place of public accommodation” is defined “broadly” under the\nDCHRA, Blodgett v.

Unsurprisingly, in light of the text of Section 2-1402.31(a)(1), cases dealing with that\n\nprovision have involved defendants who denied the benefit of a place of accommodation to\n\ncertain individuals — during the scope of continuing operations — while providing that same\n\nbenefit to others.

Code § 2-1402.73 states that “[e]xcept as otherwise provided for\n\nby District law or when otherwise lawfully and reasonably permitted,” it is “an unlawful\n\ndiscriminatory practice for a District government agency or office to limit or refuse to provide\n\nany facility, service, program, or benefit to any individual on the basis of an individual’s actual or\n\nperceived . . . place of residence.” There is a dearth of case law respecting this provision, which\n\nbecame effective in 2002, and the Court has not located any decisions applying it. See George\n\nWashington Univ. v. Dist. of Columbia Bd. of Adjustment, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">831</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">921</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 941 n.16 (D.C. 2003)\n\n(briefly discussing Section 2-1402.73). Nevertheless, the Court believes that it does not speak to\n\nthe allegations made by the plaintiffs.\n\n                The plaintiffs allege that the District of Columbia discriminated against them by\n\nclosing La Casa while not closing low-barrier shelters in Wards 7 and 8. 2d Am. Compl.\n\n¶¶ 123-24. But it cannot be that Section 2-1402.73 is violated simply because the District closes\n\na public assistance facility in one part of the city while failing to close similar facilities in a\n\ndifferent part of the city. Under that reasoning, virtually any decision by the District limiting or\n\n\n\n                                                   29\n\frestricting services of any kind in one quadrant, ward, or neighborhood could be challenged as\n\ndiscriminatory under the DCHRA. The same logic would seemingly allow individuals to sue\n\nover a failure to construct facilities or provide services in one part of the city where such\n\nfacilities or services are available elsewhere. This broad interpretation, which would subject an\n\nunimaginable number of routine policy decisions to litigation, cannot credibly be derived from a\n\nprovision that bars discrimination “on the basis of” place of residence or eighteen other protected\n\ntraits. As with Section 2-1401.31(a)(1), the language of Section 2-1402.73 signals a focus on the\n\nselective denial of benefits to certain persons, based on their place of residence, while those\n\nbenefits remain available to other persons. See D.C. Code § 2-1402.73 (making it unlawfully\n\ndiscriminatory to deny services “to any individual on the basis of an individual’s actual or\n\nperceived . . . place of residence”) (emphasis added). The conduct challenged here by the\n\nplaintiffs simply is not encompassed within that definition.17\n\n               In sum, the Court concludes that the plaintiffs have not stated viable claims for\n\nplace of residence discrimination under the DCHRA; those claims accordingly cannot survive a\n\nmotion to dismiss.\n\n\n               H. Disability Discrimination under the DCHRA (Counts IX and X)\n\n               The plaintiffs also bring claims for disability discrimination under the DCHRA,\n\nalleging both disparate treatment and disparate impact. The definition of “disability” under the\n\nDCHRA is virtually identical to that under the ADA and to the definition of “handicap” under\n\n\n\n       17\n               A third conceivable vehicle for the plaintiffs’ claims is D.C. Code § 2-1401.21(a),\nwhich prohibits “place of residence” discrimination with respect to housing and commercial\nspace — but every subdivision under this section addresses real estate transactions or actions\naffecting tenants or lessees; none is applicable to the closure of a homeless shelter.\n\n                                                  30\n\fthe FHA.

Code § 2-1402.31(a)(1),\n\nwhich prohibits discrimination in public accommodations based on disability, or on § 2-1402.73,\n\nwhich prohibits District agencies from refusing to provide facilities, benefits, or services on the\n\nbasis of disability. Because the language contained in these two provisions is different from the\n\nprovisions of the ADA and FHA barring disability discrimination, the DCHRA may not be\n\nentirely parallel to a federal counterpart in this respect. Yet the same problems that doom the\n\nplaintiffs’ federal disability claims, see supra at 15-16, 22-24, 27, apply with equal force to any\n\ndisability claims the plaintiffs might bring under the DCHRA. The only potentially\n\ndistinguishing feature of the plaintiffs’ DCHRA claims is that under each count the plaintiffs\n\naver, among other things, that the District “refus[ed] to accommodate their needs and requests for\n\nadequate shelter” as well as “for accessible mental health and health care services, adequate\n\nnutrition, and employment opportunity availability.” 2d Am. Compl. ¶¶ 135, 143.\n\n\n\n                                                 31\n\fNotwithstanding the plaintiffs’ use of the phrase “refusal to accommodate” in these two\n\nparagraphs, nothing in their complaint alleges a viable claim for failure to provide reasonable\n\naccommodation; rather, the plaintiffs appear to be simply characterizing the closure of La Casa\n\nand the resulting unavailability of shelter as a failure to accommodate. That contention makes\n\nlittle sense.\n\n                The Court concludes that the plaintiffs’ allegations of disability discrimination\n\nunder the DCHRA do not state a claim upon which relief can be granted, and that these claims\n\ncannot survive a motion to dismiss.\n\n\n                   I. Violation of the Homeless Service Reform Act (Count XI)\n\n                The plaintiffs seek to add a new claim to their complaint, under the District of\n\nColumbia’s Homeless Services Reform Act (“HSRA”), D.C. Code § 4-751.01 et seq. But that\n\nAct expressly states that none of its provisions “shall be construed to create an entitlement (either\n\ndirect or implied) on the part of any individual or family to any services within the Continuum of\n\nCare, other than shelter in severe weather conditions,” as authorized in one particular provision.\n\nD.C. Code § 4-755(a); see also id. § 4-751.01(8) (defining “Continuum of Care” as “the\n\ncomprehensive system of services for individuals and families who are homeless or at imminent\n\nrisk of becoming homeless,” including “shelter, transitional housing, permanent supportive\n\nhousing, and supportive services”). The District of Columbia Court of Appeals has explained\n\nthat in light of this “unambiguous[]” provision, “it is clear that there is only one statutory\n\nentitlement conveyed by the act, and that is shelter in severe or frigid weather.” Baltimore v.\n\nDist. of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1141</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1151 (D.C. 2011).\n\n\n\n\n                                                  32\n\f               “Severe weather conditions” under the HRSA means “whenever the actual or\n\nforecasted temperature, including the wind chill factor or heat index, falls below 32 degrees\n\nFahrenheit or rises above 95 degrees Fahrenheit.” D.C. Code § 4-751.01(35). The statutory\n\nentitlement to shelter in such conditions is found in D.C. Code § 4-754.11(5). While the\n\ncomplaint alleges that unspecified former La Casa residents “and other homeless in the Columbia\n\nHeights area” were denied shelter during such conditions on February 21, 2011, see 2d Am.\n\nCompl. ¶ 63, the complaint pointedly does not allege that any of the current or proposed new\n\nplaintiffs were among those denied shelter during that night, nor do any of the declarations\n\nsubmitted by plaintiffs make such a claim. The plaintiffs therefore cannot prevail on any claim\n\nunder the HRSA based on the denial of shelter.\n\n               In their opposition to the District’s motion to dismiss — although not in their\n\nproposed amended complaint or in their briefing on their motion to amend — the plaintiffs also\n\nallege that the closure of La Casa violated certain procedural rights under the HRSA, specifically\n\nthe right to an administrative hearing.

Dist. of Columbia, 10 A.3d at 1152-53. Contrary to the plaintiffs’\n\nargument, the HRSA does not create any right to a hearing before the closure of a shelter.

CONCLUSION\n\n               For the foregoing reasons, the Court has determined that only the plaintiffs’ claim\n\nfor disparate impact based on race under the FHA (Count 3) can survive a motion to dismiss.\n\nAmendment of the plaintiffs’ complaint therefore is not futile, in that the proposed second\n\namended complaint adds plaintiffs and contains one viable count. The Court therefore grants the\n\nplaintiffs’ motion to amend their complaint but dismisses all counts of the second amended\n\n\n\n\n                                                 34\n\fcomplaint except Count 3. The Court grants the defendant’s motion to dismiss the existing\n\ncomplaint.18 An Order consistent with this Opinion was issued on September 28, 2012.\n\n               SO ORDERED.\n\n                                                      /s/\n                                                     PAUL L. FRIEDMAN\nDATE: October 4, 2012                                United States District Judge\n\n\n\n\n       18\n                 As an alternative means of achieving the same end, the Court could have granted\nin part and denied in part the motion to amend, while giving the plaintiffs specific instructions\nabout which count(s) could appear in their amended complaint and directing them to file such a\ncomplaint in conformity with those instructions. See, e.g., Fox v. District of Columbia, 851 F.\nSupp. 2d 20, 39 (D.D.C. 2012). The Court has taken the more expeditious procedural route of\ngranting the motion to amend in full — allowing the proposed complaint already submitted by\nthe plaintiffs along with their motion to be docketed as the second amended complaint — while\ndismissing the counts that the Court has determined are deficient under Rule 12(b)(6).\n\n                                                35\n\f</pre>",
