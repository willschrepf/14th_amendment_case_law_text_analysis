In Hubbard\nv. Taylor, 399 F.3d 150 (3d Cir. 2005) (Hubbard I), we held that\nwhen pretrial detainees challenge conditions of confinement,\ntheir claims must be analyzed under the Due Process Clause of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment. Because the District Court initially\nevaluated Plaintiffs’ claims under the Eighth Amendment’s\nprohibition against cruel and unusual punishment, we vacated\nthe order granting summary judgment to Defendants and\nremanded to the District Court for analysis under the Fourteenth\nAmendment. Furthermore, as the District Court had addressed\nthe merits of Plaintiffs’ claims without reaching Defendants’\nassertions of qualified immunity, we instructed the District\nCourt to resolve the qualified immunity issue first. Hubbard I,\n399 F.3d at 167.\n\n\n\n                               3\n\f       On remand, the District Court found that Defendants\nwere entitled to qualified immunity under either prong of the\nfamiliar two-step analysis established by the Supreme Court in\nSaucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194 (2001). See Hubbard v. Taylor,\n452 F. Supp. 2d 533 (D. Del. 2006). Plaintiffs filed this timely\nappeal and jurisdiction lies under 28 U.S.C. § 1291.1\n\n                               I.\n\n       Plaintiffs claim that they were punished in violation of\nthe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment when\nthey were “triple-celled,” or housed three-to-a-cell, in the West\nWing of the Multi-Purpose Criminal Justice Facility in\nWilmington, Delaware (commonly known as “Gander Hill”).\nThe facts of this case are set forth in Judge McKee’s\ncomprehensive opinion for the Court in Hubbard I. We assume\nfamiliarity with those facts and will not restate them here.\n\n       Pursuant to the Supreme Court’s decision in Saucier, we\nmust first resolve a “threshold question: Taken in the light most\nfavorable to the party asserting the injury, do the facts alleged\nshow the officer’s conduct violated a constitutional right?” 533\nU.S. at 201. If there has been a violation, we proceed to the\n\n\n\n       1\n          Former Delaware Attorney General M. Jane Brady\nappears in the caption as a Defendant and was discussed as such\nin the opinion below. We note that Plaintiffs’ Amended\nComplaint made no claims against her and failed to name her as\na Defendant.\n\n                               4\n\fsecond step of Saucier, which asks “whether the right was\nclearly established.” 2 Id.\n\n                                II.\n\n        In Hubbard I, we noted that when pretrial detainees\nchallenge their conditions of confinement, we must consider\nwhether there has been a violation of the Due Process Clause of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment. As the Supreme Court stated in\nBell v. Wolfish:\n\n       In evaluating the constitutionality of conditions or\n       restrictions of pretrial detention that implicate\n       only the protection against deprivation of liberty\n\n\n       2\n            We note that since Saucier was decided, several\njustices have questioned the propriety of rigidly obliging district\ncourts to consider the constitutional question first. See Morse v.\nFrederick, — U.S. —, 127 S. Ct. 2618, 2641 (2007) (Breyer, J.,\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part); see also Brousseau v.\nHaugen, 543 U.S. 194, 201-02 (2004) (Breyer, J., joined by\nScalia and Ginsburg, JJ., concurring); Bunting v. Mellen, 541\nU.S. 1019, 1019 (2004) (Stevens, J., joined by Ginsburg and\nBreyer, JJ., respecting denial of certiorari); id. at 1022-23\n(Scalia, J., joined by Rehnquist, C.J., dissenting). On March 24,\n2008, the Supreme Court granted certiorari in Pearson v.\nCallahan, 128 S. Ct. 1702, 2008 WL 754340 (U.S.), a case\narising under the Fourth Amendment in which the Court\ndirected the parties to brief and argue whether Saucier should be\noverruled.\n\n                                5\n\f      without due process of law, we think that the\n      proper inquiry is whether those conditions amount\n      to punishment of the detainee. For under the Due\n      Process Clause, a detainee may not be punished\n      prior to an adjudication of guilt in accordance\n      with due process of law.\n\n441 U.S. 520, 535 (1979).\n\n      Accordingly, we must determine whether the conditions\nimposed upon Plaintiffs at Gander Hill amount to punishment.\nIn making this determination:\n\n      A court must decide whether the disability is\n      imposed for the purpose of punishment or\n      whether it is but an incident of some other\n      legitimate governmental purpose. Absent a\n      showing of an expressed intent to punish on the\n      part of the detention facility officials, that\n      determination generally will turn on ‘whether [the\n      disability has] an alternative purpose . . . and\n      whether it appears excessive in relation to [that]\n      purpose.’ . . . Thus, if a particular condition or\n      restriction of pretrial detention is reasonably\n      related to a legitimate governmental objective, it\n      does not, without more, amount to ‘punishment.’\n      Conversely, if a restriction or condition is not\n      reasonably related to a legitimate goal — if it is\n      arbitrary or purposeless — a court permissibly\n      may infer that the purpose of the governmental\n\n\n                              6\n\f       action is punishment that may not constitutionally\n       be inflicted upon detainees qua detainees.\n\nId. at 538-39 (citations omitted). The Supreme Court further\nstated that:\n\n       In determining whether restrictions or conditions\n       are reasonably related to the Government’s\n       interest in maintaining security and order and\n       operating the institution in a manageable fashion,\n       courts must heed our warning that such\n       considerations are peculiarly within the province\n       and professional expertise of corrections officials,\n       and, in the absence of substantial evidence in the\n       record to indicate that the officials have\n       e x a g g e r a t e d t h e i r r e s p o n s e to th e s e\n       considerations, courts should ordinarily defer to\n       their expert judgment in such matters.\n\nId. at 540 n.23 (citations omitted). See also Block v. Rutherford,\n468 U.S. 576, 584 (1984) (emphasizing the “very limited role\nthat courts should play in the administration of detention\nfacilities”).\n\n       In Union County Jail Inmates v. Di Buono, 713 F.2d 984\n(3d Cir. 1983), this Court distilled the Supreme Court’s\nteachings in Bell into a two-part test. “[W]e must ask, first,\nwhether any legitimate purposes are served by these conditions,\nand second, whether these conditions are rationally related to\nthese purposes.” Id. at 992.\n\n\n                                   7\n\f                                A.\n\n        Before the District Court, Plaintiffs argued that they were\ntriple-celled for the illegitimate purpose of coercing them to\nenter into plea bargains. Here, however, Plaintiffs rely on “[a]n\nelementary mathematical calculation” in challenging the\nlegitimacy of triple-celling.\n\n       According to Plaintiffs, the East Wing of Gander Hill\ncontains 480 cells designed for two people, which amounts to\nspace for a total of 960 individuals. Noting that “[t]his is the\napproximate number of pretrial detainees housed three-to-a-cell\nin the 360 one-person cells of the West Wing (360 X 3 =\n1080),” Plaintiffs argue that “the average number of pretrial\ndetainees (about 1000) could have been housed two to a cell in\nthe East Wing without overcrowding.” Therefore, because\n“Gander Hill had ample space to comfortably house pretrial\ndetainees two-to-a-cell in the East Wing and triple cell\nsentenced prisoners in the West Wing,” Plaintiffs contend that\nthey were triple-celled needlessly.\n\n        As Defendants counter — and as Plaintiffs concede in\ntheir reply brief — this argument was based on the fallacy that\nthere are 480 cells in the East Wing when, in fact, there are only\n240 cells. The East Wing therefore has insufficient space to\nhouse the average number of pretrial detainees at Gander Hill\neven if they were triple-celled rather than double-celled. In light\nof the true capacity of the East Wing, we summarily reject\nPlaintiffs’ contention that there was “no need to triple cell\npretrial detainees at Gander Hill because there was ample room\nin the East Wing for the detainees.”\n\n                                8\n\f       Rather, it is clear that Defendants’ practice of triple-\ncelling pretrial detainees was a response to the severe\novercrowding at Gander Hill. Acknowledging this fact,\nPlaintiffs note in their Amended Complaint that prisoners and\ndetainees were sometimes housed in the facility’s gym, weight\nroom, and booking and receiving area. Furthermore, as we\nnoted in Hubbard I, Gander Hill receives approximately 18,000\nadmissions per year — a figure over which Defendants have no\ncontrol. 399 F.3d at 156.\n\n       In considering the validity of the governmental interest\nin managing this overcrowding, we note that in Bell the\nSupreme Court recognized the government’s “legitimate\ninterests that stem from its need to manage the facility in which\nthe individual is detained.” 441 U.S. at 540. Moreover, in\nUnion County, this Court explicitly recognized a county’s\ninterest in the “management of [an] overcrowded institution.”\n713 F.2d at 993. Thus, the District Court correctly concluded\nthat Defendants had a legitimate interest in trying to manage, as\nbest they could, the overcrowded conditions at Gander Hill.3\n\n\n\n       3\n            Our dissenting colleague states: “Once the courts\ndetermine that a constitutional violation exists, it is no answer\nthat the state or local government has insufficient funds to\nremedy the unconstitutional situation.” We agree. The fact that\nthe prison administrators in this case have a legitimate interest\nin managing overcrowding means that the first prong of the test\nis satisfied. It does not mean that fiscal concerns can serve as a\nproxy for constitutional standards.\n\n                                9\n\f                                B.\n\n        Having rejected Plaintiffs’ “elementary mathematical\ncalculation” and having recognized the validity of Defendants’\ninterest in managing an overcrowded prison, we now consider\nwhether the triple-celling of pretrial detainees is rationally\nrelated to this interest. As we noted in Union County, this\nanalysis involves a “further [] inquir[y] as to whether these\nconditions ‘cause inmates to endure such genuine privations and\nhardship over an extended period of time,’ that the adverse\nconditions become excessive in relation to the purposes assigned\nto them.” 713 F.2d at 992 (quoting Bell, 441 U.S. at 542)\n(alterations omitted).\n\n       In conducting this excessiveness analysis, “we do not\nassay separately each of the institutional practices, but [instead]\nlook to the totality of the conditions.” Hubbard I, 399 F.3d at\n160 (quoting Jones v. Diamond, 636 F.2d 1364, 1368 (5th Cir.\n1981), overruled on other grounds by Int’l Woodworkers of Am.\nv. Champion Int’l Corp., 790 F.2d 1174 (5th Cir. 1986) (en\nbanc)). See also Ferguson v. Cape Girardeau County, 88 F.3d\n647, 650 (8th Cir. 1996) (“[i]n evaluating the conditions, the\ncourt must look to a number of factors, including the size of the\ndetainee’s living space, the length of confinement, the amount\nof time spent in the confined area each day, and the opportunity\nfor exercise”) (citation omitted).\n\n      In claiming that triple-celling is excessive in relation to\nthe management of overcrowding at Gander Hill, Plaintiffs\nemphasize that each detainee had only sixteen square feet of net\n\n\n                                10\n\funencumbered cell space to himself.4 However, this lack of\nspace in individual cells is alleviated by the availability of large\ncommon areas, or “dayrooms.” As we noted in Hubbard I,\nGander Hill’s housing units have a “modular” design, in which\neach housing unit contains twenty cells that surround a dayroom\nof approximately 3,900 square feet. 399 F.3d at 154. Each\ndayroom contains a sink, tables, chairs, and a television, and\ninmates are generally free to leave their cells and access the\ndayroom between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 10:30 p.m. Id. In\nanalyzing a similar modular setup in Bell, the Supreme Court\nwrote that because “[d]etainees are required to spend only seven\nor eight hours each day in their rooms, during most or all of\nwhich they presumably are sleeping,” and because the detainees’\nrooms “provide more than adequate space for sleeping,” 441\nU.S. at 543, it thus “fail[ed] to understand the emphasis . . . on\nthe amount of walking space” in the cells. Id. at 543 n.26.\n\n        Plaintiffs also emphasize the fact that they had to sleep\non floor mattresses for extended periods of time as a result of\ntriple-celling, with most spending between three and seven\nmonths on a mattress while waiting for one of the bunk beds to\n\n\n\n\n       4\n         Cells in Gander Hill’s West Wing range in size from 69\nto 76 square feet; after accounting for the space occupied by a\nbunk bed, floor mattress, desk, and toilet, each detainee has\napproximately 16 square feet of individual free space in his cell.\nHubbard I, 399 F.3d at 154. Defendants note that the floor\nmattress can be placed underneath the bunk bed when not in use.\n\n                                11\n\fbecome available.5 They allege that this resulted in “extreme\ndiscomfort and disease” as well as the “regular splash[ing]” of\nurine and feces from the nearby toilet; moreover, two of the\nPlaintiffs claim to have suffered injuries as a result of the\nmattresses. Highlighting the aforementioned language from Bell\nand Union County — that conditions of confinement involving\n“genuine privations and hardship over an extended period of\ntime might raise serious questions under the Due Process\nClause” — Plaintiffs argue that being required to spend three to\nseven months on a floor mattress is excessive in relation to the\nmanagement of overcrowding at Gander Hill.\n\n       In support of their argument, Plaintiffs rely upon the\ndecision of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in\nLareau v. Manson, 651 F.2d 96 (2d Cir. 1981), in which pretrial\ndetainees challenged their conditions of confinement at the\nHartford Community Correctional Center (HCCC). Consistent\nwith the “totality of the circumstances” analysis described in\nHubbard I, the Second Circuit wrote that the question of\nwhether prison overcrowding constituted punishment “is one of\ndegree and must be considered in light of the particular\ncircumstances of each case and the particular facility in\nquestion” and that “the [Bell] court itself highlighted the factual\nsensitivity of the inquiry.” Id. at 103.\n\n\n\n       5\n         The newest arrival in a cell is required to sleep on the\nfloor mattress until one of the other inmates in the cell is\nreleased or moved, thereby freeing up a bunk. Hubbard I, 399\nF.3d at 154.\n\n                                12\n\f        In conducting this fact-based analysis, the Lareau court\ncontrasted the conditions at the HCCC with those in the\ndouble-bunked facility in Bell, noting that the 60 to 65 square\nfoot cells in the HCCC were 10 to 15 square feet smaller than\nthose at issue in Bell. Id. at 104. Though recognizing that cell\novercrowding could be “avoided” by the use of dayrooms, the\nLareau court indicated that the 225 to 262 square foot dayrooms\nin the HCCC were so tiny and overcrowded themselves that, “in\ncontrast to [Bell], the lack of living space in the doubled cells\n[was] compounded rather than alleviated by the situation in the\ncommon areas.” Id. Accordingly, the court held that “when a\ndetainee is subjected for a substantial length of time to the\ncombination of double-bunked cells, overcrowded dayrooms\nand strained prison services found in the HCCC, he is being\nunconstitutionally punished” and indicated that the maximum\namount of time that such conditions were constitutionally\npermissible was 15 days. Id. at 105. Without further analysis,\nthe Lareau court then indicated that the use of floor mattresses\nwas “too egregious to warrant any such leeway” and\n“constitute[d] punishment without regard to the number of days\nfor which a prisoner is so confined.” Id. This finding – in\nwhich the Second Circuit effectively held floor mattresses to be\nper se unconstitutional – is in considerable tension with\nLareau’s own statement that the punishment inquiry “is one of\ndegree and must be considered in light of the particular\ncircumstances of each case and the particular facility in\nquestion.” Id. at 103. It is also noteworthy that Lareau is the\nonly Court of Appeals decision to categorically prohibit the use\nof floor mattresses.\n\n\n\n                               13\n\f        Consistent with Hubbard I, we decline to follow\nLareau’s approach of “assay[ing] separately” the\nconstitutionality of floor mattresses, and instead consider them\nas part of the “totality of the circumstances within [the]\ninstitution.” Hubbard I, 399 F.3d at 160. Although many\npretrial detainees at Gander Hill did spend a substantial amount\nof time on floor mattresses, they also had access to 3,900 square\nfoot dayrooms that were more than twice the size of the\ndayrooms in Bell and approximately fifteen times the size of the\nlargest dayrooms in Lareau. Furthermore, though under Saucier\nthe facts alleged must be viewed in the light most favorable to\nthe party asserting the injury, the record does not substantiate\nPlaintiffs’ claims that the use of floor mattresses resulted in\ndisease or the splashing of human waste upon them. Finally, as\nthe District Court noted, “over $2.8 million dollars has been\nspent on capital improvements at Gander Hill during the past\nfive years to maintain or elevate the living conditions for\nprisoners,” resulting in improvements to the air conditioning\nsystem, fire alarm system, roofing, showers, hot water system,\nwater filtration system, kitchen floor, and ventilation ducts.\nHubbard, 452 F. Supp. 2d at 536 (D. Del. 2006).\n\n       In sum, based upon the totality of circumstances at\nGander Hill and bearing in mind the “very limited role that\ncourts should play in the administration of detention facilities,”\nBlock, 468 U.S. at 584, we hold that Plaintiffs were not\nsubjected to genuine privations and hardship over an extended\nperiod of time for purposes of their due process claim.\n\n\n\n\n                               14\n\f                                C.\n\n       Plaintiffs also rely heavily upon our decision in United\nStates ex rel. Tyrrell v. Speaker, 535 F.2d 823 (3d Cir. 1976), in\narguing that their conditions of confinement amount to\nunconstitutional punishment. In Tyrrell, we:\n\n       affirm[ed] the district court’s holding that the\n       state violated the due process clause of the\n       Fourteenth Amendment in arbitrarily imposing\n       materially greater restrictions on the freedom of\n       this pre-trial detainee than those imposed on\n       convicted prisoners at Graterford, since the only\n       legitimate state interest in the detention of an\n       accused who cannot raise bail is in guaranteeing\n       his presence at trial.\n\nId. at 827 (citations omitted). Plaintiffs therefore claim that the\npractice of triple-celling pretrial detainees at Gander Hill —\nwhich did involve the imposition of materially greater\nrestrictions upon detainees in the West Wing than upon the\nconvicted prisoners in the East Wing — was a violation of the\nDue Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n        We find several problems with Plaintiffs’ reliance upon\nTyrrell. First, the above-quoted statement was undermined by\nthe Supreme Court’s subsequent decision in Bell. See 441 U.S.\nat 539-40 (“we do not accept [the] argument that the\nGovernment’s interest in ensuring a detainee’s presence at trial\nis the only objective that may justify restraints and conditions\nonce the decision is lawfully made to confine a person. . . . [T]he\n\n                                15\n\feffective management of the detention facility . . . is [also] a\nvalid objective that may justify imposition of conditions and\nrestrictions of pretrial detention and dispel any inference that\nsuch restrictions are intended as punishment”) (emphasis in\noriginal). Thus, Plaintiffs were not triple-celled “arbitrarily” as\nsuggested by Tyrrell, but in furtherance of the government’s\nlegitimate interest in managing the severe overcrowding at\nGander Hill. See Section II.A., supra.\n\n       Furthermore, we note that nowhere in Bell did the\nSupreme Court suggest that if detainees are treated differently\nor worse than convicted inmates, they are ipso facto being\n“punished” in violation of the Due Process Clause. Rather, the\nultimate question under Bell is whether “a particular condition\nor restriction of pretrial detention is reasonably related to a\nlegitimate governmental objective,” 441 U.S. at 549; if so, it is\nirrelevant whether or not that condition is also imposed upon\nconvicted inmates.         Simply put, conditions that are\n“comparatively worse” or “less comfortable” for pretrial\ndetainees than for convicted inmates are not by themselves\ntantamount to punishment, and to the extent that Tyrrell\nsuggests otherwise, it is no longer valid after Bell.\n\n       In light of the foregoing analysis, we conclude that\nPlaintiffs were not punished in violation of the Due Process\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n                               III.\n\n      Even if we had found that Plaintiffs had been subjected\nto unconstitutional punishment, they can prevail only by\n\n                                16\n\fshowing under the second step of Saucier that the constitutional\nright violated was “clearly established” at the time it occurred.\n533 U.S. at 201. “[A] right is clearly established for purposes\nof qualified immunity when its contours are ‘sufficiently clear\nthat a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing\nviolates that right.’” Williams v. Bitner, 455 F.3d 186, 191 (3d\nCir. 2006) (quoting Saucier, 533 U.S. at 202). Thus, “[t]he\nqualified immunity standard ‘gives ample room for mistaken\njudgments by protecting all but the plainly incompetent or those\nwho knowingly violate the law.’” Gilles v. Davis, 427 F.3d 197,\n203 (3d Cir. 2005) (quoting Hunter v. Bryant, 502 U.S. 224, 229\n(1991)).\n\n        In their reply brief, Plaintiffs acknowledge that “Bell\nprovides scant guidance on what constitutes ‘punishment’ under\nthe Fourteenth Amendment”; indeed, the Supreme Court has not\nclearly established the right that Plaintiffs claim was violated in\nthis case. Likewise, our own precedents have never established\na right of pretrial detainees to be free from triple-celling or from\nsleeping on a mattress placed on the floor.6\n\n\n       6\n         In Union County, this Court concluded that the practice\nof double-celling detainees in bunk beds was constitutional in\npart because it avoided “the unsanitary and humiliating practice\nof forcing detainees to sleep on mattresses placed . . . on the\nfloor adjacent to the toilet and at the feet of their cellmates.”\n713 F.2d at 996. In Plaintiffs’ first appeal to this Court, they\nargued that the foregoing quotation from Union County dictated\na finding of unconstitutionality in this case. We disagreed,\nholding in Hubbard I that “the issue of the constitutionality of\n\n                                17\n\f        In addition to the absence of any clearly established\nappellate law, the overwhelming weight of district court\nauthority holds that pretrial detainees at Gander Hill have not\nbeen subjected to unconstitutional punishment. As we noted\npreviously, “every district court judge in the District of\nDelaware has ruled that having pre-trial detainees sleep on\nmattresses on the floor at Gander Hill is constitutionally\npermissible.” Hubbard I, 399 F.3d at 167. Plaintiffs counter by\nciting dicta from two other district courts to the effect that floor\nmattresses are unconstitutional. See Monmouth v. Lanzaro, 595\nF. Supp. 1417 (D.N.J. 1984); see also Newkirk v. Sheers, 834 F.\nSupp. 772 (E.D. Pa. 1993). Even if these dicta are read as\nholdings, they conflict with almost all of the holdings from the\nvery district in which Gander Hill is located. See, e.g., Brandon\nv. Taylor, 2000 WL 35547587 (D. Del. 2000) (no Eighth\nAmendment violation where plaintiff was forced to sleep on\nfloor mattress for eight days and suffered various other\nprivations); Bagwell v. Brewington-Carr, 2000 WL 1728148 (D.\nDel. 2000) (no Eighth Amendment violation where plaintiff was\ndouble-celled in cell built for one and alleged unsanitary and\nunsafe conditions resulting from overcrowding); Jackson v.\nBrewington-Carr, 1999 WL 27124 (D. Del. 1999) (no Eighth\nAmendment violation where plaintiff was temporarily confined\nto floor mattress); Bartley v. Taylor, Civ. No. 98-503 (D. Del.\n\n\nplacing floor mattresses adjacent to a toilet was simply not\nbefore [the Union County court] and we did not decide it.\nTherefore, it was dictum.” 399 F.3d at 163. Accordingly, our\ndecision in Union County does not establish a constitutional\nright to be free from the use of floor mattresses.\n\n                                18\n\fSept. 10, 1999) (in finding no Eighth Amendment violation,\ncourt noted that “in light of prison overcrowding problems,\nbudget restrictions, and the need for prison authorities to take\nmeasures to accommodate overcrowding, the fact that inmates\nare forced to sleep on the floor on a mattress instead of a bed is\nnot sufficient to state a claim of a constitutional violation”);\nAlbino Torres v. Brewington-Carr, Civ. No. 98-159 (D. Del.\nNov. 29, 1999) (no Eighth Amendment violation where plaintiff\nwas triple-celled); Martin v. Brewington-Carr, Civ. No. 98-04\n(D. Del. Dec. 31, 1997) (in finding no Eighth Amendment\nviolation, court noted that “in light of the prison over-crowding\nproblem and the need for prison authorities to take interim\nmeasures to house inmates within limited space, the fact [that]\nan inmate had to sleep on the floor in crowded or dirty\nconditions is insufficient to state a claim under Section 1983”).7\nBut see Harris v. Brewington-Carr, 49 F. Supp. 2d 378, 379 (D.\nDel. 1999) (plaintiff who “had to sleep on the floor for one week\nwhile being held in Booking and Receiving” and later “had to\nsleep on the floor for three weeks before receiving a bed” stated\nclaim upon which relief could be granted).\n\n\n       7\n           Nor are we persuaded by Plaintiffs’ argument that\nDefendants may not rely upon the District of Delaware decisions\nto establish qualified immunity because they were based upon\nan Eighth Amendment analysis that we found to be “fatally\nflawed” in Hubbard I. 399 F.3d at 164. While Hubbard I\nindicated that these decisions should have used a Fourteenth\nAmendment due process analysis, the decisions are nevertheless\nplainly relevant as to whether Plaintiffs’ alleged constitutional\nright was clearly established at the time it was violated.\n\n                               19\n\f        In the absence of direct authority from the Supreme Court\nor this Court, the Defendants in this case were not obliged to\nfamiliarize themselves with, and adhere to, the decisions of\ndistrict courts outside their jurisdiction when the very court to\nwhose jurisdiction they were subject repeatedly approved of\ntheir practices at Gander Hill. As the foregoing District of\nDelaware cases demonstrate, this is not a case where “the\nunlawfulness of the defendant’s conduct would have been\napparent to a reasonable official based on the current state of the\nlaw, [such that] it is not necessary that there be binding\nprecedent from this circuit so advising.” Williams, 455 F.3d at\n192 (quoting Brown v. Muhlenberg Twp., 269 F.3d 205, 211-12\n(3d Cir. 2001)). Accordingly, the District Court did not err in\nholding that the Defendants were entitled to qualified immunity.\n\n                                IV.\n\n       In sum, we find that under Saucier, Defendants did not\nviolate Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights and that those rights were\nnot clearly established in any event. Our holding in this case\nshould not be misconstrued as an endorsement of “triple-\ncelling” or the use of floor mattresses, however. Rather, we\nhold that based on the totality of the circumstances presented on\nthis factual record, Plaintiffs were not unconstitutionally\npunished in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nAccordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.\n\n\n\n\n                                20\n\fSLOVITER, Circuit Judge, dissenting in part and concurring in\nJudgment.\n\n\n\n\n        Appellants are pre-trial detainees housed at Delaware’s\nMultipurpose Criminal Justice Facility, known as “Gander Hill,”\nwho appeal the order of the District Court granting summary\njudgment in favor of prison officials (“prison officials” or\n“Appellees,” collectively) based on qualified immunity. The\ndetainees claim that certain conditions of confinement,\nspecifically the practice at Gander Hill of housing three\ndetainees in cells designed for one person (“triple-celling”),\nviolate their rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. When this\ncase was initially before this court, we held that the District\nCourt erred in applying the Eighth Amendment cruel and\nunusual punishment standard applicable to convicted prisoners.\nHubbard v. Taylor, 399 F.3d 150 (3d Cir. 2005) (Hubbard I).\nWe explained that because the prisoners were pre-trial detainees,\ntheir claim must be evaluated under the standards applicable\nunder the Fourteenth Amendment. We stated that under the\ncontrolling authority of Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979),\npre-trial detainees “are not yet at a stage of the criminal process\nwhere they can be punished because they have not as yet been\nconvicted of anything.” Hubbard I, 399 F.3d at 166. We\nremanded to the District Court for a proper analysis of the\ndetainees’ claim. We also noted that the District Court had not\nreached defendants’ entitlement to qualified immunity, and\ndirected the District Court to resolve that issue first.\n\n\n\n                                21\n\f       On remand, the prison officials renewed their motion for\nsummary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity. Hubbard\nv. Taylor, 452 F. Supp. 2d 533, 535 (D. Del. 2006). The District\nCourt found that triple-celling could not be considered\npunishment, as it was initiated in response to overcrowding at\nGander Hill. Id. at 541. Deferring to the prison officials’\ndetermination that triple-celling of pre-trial detainees is one way\nof dealing with overcrowded facilities, the Court found this\naction was not arbitrary or purposeless so as to constitute\npunishment.\n\n\n\n\n       The majority proceeds to follow the two-step analysis\nrequired to determine whether the prison officials are entitled to\nqualified immunity and holds that the triple-bunking to which\nthe detainees were subjected did not constitute a violation of\ntheir due process rights. I respectfully disagree.\n\n\n\n\n      The conditions at Gander Hill were fully described in\nHubbard I. I reiterate them because they form the basis for my\nconclusion contrary to that of my colleagues.\n\n\n\n\n       Plaintiffs claim that triple-celling requires\n       someone to sleep on a mattress that must be\n       placed on the cell floor adjacent to a toilet. . . .\n\n\n                                22\n\f        The defendants concede that an inmate\nmust sleep on a floor mattress when three are\nhoused in a given cell. When that happens, the\nnewest arrival is required to sleep on a mattress\non the floor until one of his cellmates is released\nor moved. That frees a bunk for the inmate who\nhad been on the floor mattress, and any new\narrival in that cell would then take his place on\nthe floor mattress.\n\n\n\n\n        The cells range in size from 69 to 76\nsquare feet, and the net unencumbered space in\nthe cell (gross footage of 69-76 square feet less\nspace required for a bed, mattress, desk and toilet)\nis less than 50 square feet or 16 square feet per\noccupant of each tripled cell. Plaintiffs claim that\nthe bunk bed and floor mattress leave extremely\nlimited space for three adult men to move about in\nthe cell. . . .\n\n\n\n\n       Plaintiffs claim that the deprivations are\nexacerbated because sleeping on the floor forces\ndetainees to sleep very near the open toilet. This\nhas purportedly resulted in urine and feces\nregularly splashing on whomever is relegated to\nthe floor mattress.\n\n\n                        23\n\f399 F.3d at 154-55.\n\n\n\n\n        Appellants claim that the conditions caused serious\ninjuries, including a broken leg and an infected shin, as well as\ndiscomfort and disease associated with sleeping on a concrete\nfloor. These conditions have repeatedly been brought to the\nattention of the district court judges of the District of Delaware\nbut no judge has characterized them as unconstitutional. In\ncontrast to those district court judges, the District Judge whose\norder is the subject of this appeal, and my colleagues in the\nmajority, I can reach no conclusion other than the conditions\nalleged meet the standard of the Fourteenth Amendment – that\nthe conditions “shock[] the conscience.” Rochin v. California,\n342 U.S. 165, 172 (1952). They shock my conscience,\nparticularly because the conditions apply to pre-trial detainees\nwho have not been convicted, some of whom are imprisoned\nbecause they cannot afford bail. Admittedly, judges have\nvarying consciences and I would not and do not comment on the\nconsciences of other judges. I merely state that when the status\nof Appellants as pre-trial detainees is combined with the\nunchallenged fact that at least some of the detainees are subject\nto these horrific conditions noted by this court in Hubbard I for\nas long as two to seven months, my conscience is shocked.\nThus, I believe that Appellants have adequately alleged a\nviolation of their constitutional right to due process.\n\n\n\n\n                               24\n\f        Once the courts determine that a constitutional violation\nexists, it is no answer that the state or local government has\ninsufficient funds to remedy the unconstitutional situation. This\nexcuse was tried and rejected in the aftermath of the decision in\nBrown v. Bd. of Educ., 347 U.S. 483 (1954). For example, in\nGriffin v. County Sch. Bd., 377 U.S. 218 (1964), a case\ninvolving a county which unconstitutionally closed its public\nschools and supported private segregated white schools to avoid\ncomplying with desegregation, the Supreme Court mentioned as\npart of the remedy that “the District Court may, if necessary to\nprevent further racial discrimination, require the [Board of]\nSupervisors to exercise the power that is theirs to levy taxes to\nraise funds adequate to reopen, operate, and maintain without\nracial discrimination a public school system” in the county. Id.\nat 233.\n\n\n\n\n       The issue has also arisen in connection with\novercrowding of prisons. In Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U.S. 337,\n339-41 (1981), the prisoners argued that “double celling”\ninmates, i.e., housing two inmates in a one-person cell, with\nbunk beds, violated their Eighth Amendment rights. The Court\nheld that the conditions in that case did not constitute cruel and\nunusual punishment. Justice Brennan’s concurrence noted that\nthe Court had “upheld the exercise of wide discretion by trial\ncourts to correct conditions of confinement found to be\nunconstitutional.” Id. at 356 n.4 (Brennan, J., concurring). His\nlanguage is particularly applicable here:\n\n\n\n                               25\n\fPublic apathy and the political powerlessness of\ninmates have contributed to the pervasive neglect\nof the prisons. . . . Prison inmates are “voteless,\npolitically unpopular, and socially threatening.”\nMorris, The Snail’s Pace of Prison Reform, in\nProceedings of the 100th Annual Congress of\nCorrections of the American Correctional Assn.\n36, 42 (1970). Thus, the suffering of prisoners,\neven if known, generally “moves the community\nin only the most severe and exceptional cases.”\nIbid. As a result even conscientious prison\nofficials are “[c]aught in the middle,” as state\nlegislatures refuse “to spend sufficient tax dollars\nto bring conditions in outdated prisons up to\nminimally acceptable standards.” Johnson v.\nLevine, 450 F. Supp. 648, 654 (Md.), aff’d in\npart, 588 F.2d 1378 (4th Cir. 1978). . . .\n\n\n\n\nUnder these circumstances, the courts have\nemerged as a critical force behind efforts to\nameliorate inhumane conditions. Insulated as\nthey are from political pressures, and charged\nwith the duty of enforcing the Constitution, courts\nare in the strongest position to insist that\nunconstitutional conditions be remedied, even at\nsignificant financial cost. Justice Blackmun, then\nserving on the Court of Appeals, set the tone in\nJackson v. Bishop, 404 F.2d 571, 580 (8th Cir.\n1968): “Humane considerations and constitutional\n\n                        26\n\f       requirements are not, in this day, to be measured\n       or limited by dollar considerations . . . .”\n\n\n\n\nId. at 358-59 (Brennan, J., concurring).\n\n\n\n\n       In Finney v. Ark. Bd. of Corr., 505 F.2d 194 (8th Cir.\n1974), the court held that “some compliance” with a previous\nremedial court decree to correct prison conditions was “not good\nenough.” Id. at 201. The court stated that:\n\n\n\n\n       [l]ack of funds is not an acceptable excuse for\n       unconstitutional conditions of incarceration. An\n       immediate answer, if the state cannot otherwise\n       resolve the problem of overcrowding, will be to\n       transfer or release some inmates. The district\n       court shall also satisfy itself that no additional\n       prisoners will be confined at the Cummins Prison\n       Farm if their confinement will result in continued\n       overcrowding and perpetuation of conditions\n       which fail to provide optimum safety and\n       sanitation for every inmate.\n\n\n\n\nId.\n\n                              27\n\f        I am satisfied that the first requirement for consideration\nof qualified immunity has been met, i.e., that the conditions\napplicable to pre-trial detainees violate their due process rights.\nOn the other hand, I cannot disagree with the majority’s\ndetermination that the constitutional right was not clearly\nestablished, and indeed has not been clearly established to this\nday.      The Supreme Court’s leading case on prison\novercrowding, Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 541, merely held that\ndouble-bunking of pre-trial detainees was not unconstitutional\nunder the conditions found there. The Court has not since been\npresented with a record such as that in this case where the pre-\ntrial detainees are triple-bunked, with the third detainee obliged\nto lie on the floor with a thin mattress. Because of the absence\nof any controlling authority, the prison officials are entitled to\nqualified immunity.\n\n\n\n\n       It is my hope that this court will hold that triple-bunking\nunder conditions such as those present here violate the due\nprocess rights of the pre-trial detainees. Once we render such an\nopinion, future prison officials would no longer be entitled to\nqualified immunity and the state would be obliged to exercise its\npower to raise the funds necessary to correct the prison\nconditions. Data recently published by the International Centre\nfor Prison Studies at King’s College London reported that the\nUnited States has almost 2.3 million individuals behind bars,\nmore than any other nation. See Adam Liptak, Inmate Count in\nU.S. Dwarfs Other Nations’, N.Y. Times, Apr. 23, 2008, at A1.\nSurely it is the responsibility of the courts to ensure that\n\n\n                                28\n\fprisoners are housed in facilities that meet constitutional\nstandards.\n\n\n\n\n                            29\n\f",

Here, however, Plaintiffs rely on “[a]n\nelementary mathematical calculation” in challenging the\nlegitimacy of triple-celling.\n\n       According to Plaintiffs, the East Wing of Gander Hill\ncontains 480 cells designed for two people, which amounts to\nspace for a total of 960 individuals. Noting that “[t]his is the\napproximate number of pretrial detainees housed three-to-a-cell\nin the 360 one-person cells of the West Wing (360 X 3 =\n1080),” Plaintiffs argue that “the average number of pretrial\ndetainees (about 1000) could have been housed two to a cell in\nthe East Wing without overcrowding.” Therefore, because\n“Gander Hill had ample space to comfortably house pretrial\ndetainees two-to-a-cell in the East Wing and triple cell\nsentenced prisoners in the West Wing,” Plaintiffs contend that\nthey were triple-celled needlessly.\n\n        As Defendants counter — and as Plaintiffs concede in\ntheir reply brief — this argument was based on the fallacy that\nthere are 480 cells in the East Wing when, in fact, there are only\n240 cells. The East Wing therefore has insufficient space to\nhouse the average number of pretrial detainees at Gander Hill\neven if they were triple-celled rather than double-celled. In light\nof the true capacity of the East Wing, we summarily reject\nPlaintiffs’ contention that there was “no need to triple cell\npretrial detainees at Gander Hill because there was ample room\nin the East Wing for the detainees.”\n\n                                8\n\f       Rather, it is clear that Defendants’ practice of triple-\ncelling pretrial detainees was a response to the severe\novercrowding at Gander Hill. Acknowledging this fact,\nPlaintiffs note in their Amended Complaint that prisoners and\ndetainees were sometimes housed in the facility’s gym, weight\nroom, and booking and receiving area. Furthermore, as we\nnoted in Hubbard I, Gander Hill receives approximately 18,000\nadmissions per year — a figure over which Defendants have no\ncontrol. 399 F.3d at 156.\n\n       In considering the validity of the governmental interest\nin managing this overcrowding, we note that in Bell the\nSupreme Court recognized the government’s “legitimate\ninterests that stem from its need to manage the facility in which\nthe individual is detained.” 441 U.S. at 540. Moreover, in\nUnion County, this Court explicitly recognized a county’s\ninterest in the “management of [an] overcrowded institution.”\n713 F.2d at 993. Thus, the District Court correctly concluded\nthat Defendants had a legitimate interest in trying to manage, as\nbest they could, the overcrowded conditions at Gander Hill.3\n\n\n\n       3\n            Our dissenting colleague states: “Once the courts\ndetermine that a constitutional violation exists, it is no answer\nthat the state or local government has insufficient funds to\nremedy the unconstitutional situation.” We agree. The fact that\nthe prison administrators in this case have a legitimate interest\nin managing overcrowding means that the first prong of the test\nis satisfied. It does not mean that fiscal concerns can serve as a\nproxy for constitutional standards.\n\n                                9\n\f                                B.\n\n        Having rejected Plaintiffs’ “elementary mathematical\ncalculation” and having recognized the validity of Defendants’\ninterest in managing an overcrowded prison, we now consider\nwhether the triple-celling of pretrial detainees is rationally\nrelated to this interest. As we noted in Union County, this\nanalysis involves a “further [] inquir[y] as to whether these\nconditions ‘cause inmates to endure such genuine privations and\nhardship over an extended period of time,’ that the adverse\nconditions become excessive in relation to the purposes assigned\nto them.” 713 F.2d at 992 (quoting Bell, 441 U.S. at 542)\n(alterations omitted).\n\n       In conducting this excessiveness analysis, “we do not\nassay separately each of the institutional practices, but [instead]\nlook to the totality of the conditions.” Hubbard I, 399 F.3d at\n160 (quoting Jones v.

Each\ndayroom contains a sink, tables, chairs, and a television, and\ninmates are generally free to leave their cells and access the\ndayroom between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 10:30 p.m. Id. In\nanalyzing a similar modular setup in Bell, the Supreme Court\nwrote that because “[d]etainees are required to spend only seven\nor eight hours each day in their rooms, during most or all of\nwhich they presumably are sleeping,” and because the detainees’\nrooms “provide more than adequate space for sleeping,” 441\nU.S. at 543, it thus “fail[ed] to understand the emphasis . . . on\nthe amount of walking space” in the cells. Id. at 543 n.26.\n\n        Plaintiffs also emphasize the fact that they had to sleep\non floor mattresses for extended periods of time as a result of\ntriple-celling, with most spending between three and seven\nmonths on a mattress while waiting for one of the bunk beds to\n\n\n\n\n       4\n         Cells in Gander Hill’s West Wing range in size from 69\nto 76 square feet; after accounting for the space occupied by a\nbunk bed, floor mattress, desk, and toilet, each detainee has\napproximately 16 square feet of individual free space in his cell.\nHubbard I, 399 F.3d at 154. Defendants note that the floor\nmattress can be placed underneath the bunk bed when not in use.\n\n                                11\n\fbecome available.5 They allege that this resulted in “extreme\ndiscomfort and disease” as well as the “regular splash[ing]” of\nurine and feces from the nearby toilet; moreover, two of the\nPlaintiffs claim to have suffered injuries as a result of the\nmattresses. Highlighting the aforementioned language from Bell\nand Union County — that conditions of confinement involving\n“genuine privations and hardship over an extended period of\ntime might raise serious questions under the Due Process\nClause” — Plaintiffs argue that being required to spend three to\nseven months on a floor mattress is excessive in relation to the\nmanagement of overcrowding at Gander Hill.\n\n       In support of their argument, Plaintiffs rely upon the\ndecision of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in\nLareau v. Manson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"391181\"><a href=\"/opinion/391181/donald-j-lareau-v-john-r-manson-commissioner-of-correction-state-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">651</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">96</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2d Cir. 1981), in which pretrial\ndetainees challenged their conditions of confinement at the\nHartford Community Correctional Center (HCCC). Consistent\nwith the “totality of the circumstances” analysis described in\nHubbard I, the Second Circuit wrote that the question of\nwhether prison overcrowding constituted punishment “is one of\ndegree and must be considered in light of the particular\ncircumstances of each case and the particular facility in\nquestion” and that “the [Bell] court itself highlighted the factual\nsensitivity of the inquiry.” Id. at 103.\n\n\n\n       5\n         The newest arrival in a cell is required to sleep on the\nfloor mattress until one of the other inmates in the cell is\nreleased or moved, thereby freeing up a bunk. Hubbard I, 399\nF.3d at 154.\n\n                                12\n\f        In conducting this fact-based analysis, the Lareau court\ncontrasted the conditions at the HCCC with those in the\ndouble-bunked facility in Bell, noting that the 60 to 65 square\nfoot cells in the HCCC were 10 to 15 square feet smaller than\nthose at issue in Bell. Id. at 104. Though recognizing that cell\novercrowding could be “avoided” by the use of dayrooms, the\nLareau court indicated that the 225 to 262 square foot dayrooms\nin the HCCC were so tiny and overcrowded themselves that, “in\ncontrast to [Bell], the lack of living space in the doubled cells\n[was] compounded rather than alleviated by the situation in the\ncommon areas.” Id. Accordingly, the court held that “when a\ndetainee is subjected for a substantial length of time to the\ncombination of double-bunked cells, overcrowded dayrooms\nand strained prison services found in the HCCC, he is being\nunconstitutionally punished” and indicated that the maximum\namount of time that such conditions were constitutionally\npermissible was 15 days. Id. at 105. Without further analysis,\nthe Lareau court then indicated that the use of floor mattresses\nwas “too egregious to warrant any such leeway” and\n“constitute[d] punishment without regard to the number of days\nfor which a prisoner is so confined.” Id. This finding – in\nwhich the Second Circuit effectively held floor mattresses to be\nper se unconstitutional – is in considerable tension with\nLareau’s own statement that the punishment inquiry “is one of\ndegree and must be considered in light of the particular\ncircumstances of each case and the particular facility in\nquestion.” Id. at 103. It is also noteworthy that Lareau is the\nonly Court of Appeals decision to categorically prohibit the use\nof floor mattresses.\n\n\n\n                               13\n\f        Consistent with Hubbard I, we decline to follow\nLareau’s approach of “assay[ing] separately” the\nconstitutionality of floor mattresses, and instead consider them\nas part of the “totality of the circumstances within [the]\ninstitution.” Hubbard I, 399 F.3d at 160. Although many\npretrial detainees at Gander Hill did spend a substantial amount\nof time on floor mattresses, they also had access to 3,900 square\nfoot dayrooms that were more than twice the size of the\ndayrooms in Bell and approximately fifteen times the size of the\nlargest dayrooms in Lareau. Furthermore, though under Saucier\nthe facts alleged must be viewed in the light most favorable to\nthe party asserting the injury, the record does not substantiate\nPlaintiffs’ claims that the use of floor mattresses resulted in\ndisease or the splashing of human waste upon them. Finally, as\nthe District Court noted, “over $2.8 million dollars has been\nspent on capital improvements at Gander Hill during the past\nfive years to maintain or elevate the living conditions for\nprisoners,” resulting in improvements to the air conditioning\nsystem, fire alarm system, roofing, showers, hot water system,\nwater filtration system, kitchen floor, and ventilation ducts.\nHubbard, 452 F. Supp. 2d at 536 (D. Del. 2006).\n\n       In sum, based upon the totality of circumstances at\nGander Hill and bearing in mind the “very limited role that\ncourts should play in the administration of detention facilities,”\nBlock, 468 U.S. at 584, we hold that Plaintiffs were not\nsubjected to genuine privations and hardship over an extended\nperiod of time for purposes of their due process claim.\n\n\n\n\n                               14\n\f                                C.\n\n       Plaintiffs also rely heavily upon our decision in United\nStates ex rel. Tyrrell v. Speaker, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"335440\"><a href=\"/opinion/335440/united-states-of-america-ex-rel-david-tyrrell-v-fred-speaker-former/\"><span class=\"volume\">535</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">823</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir. 1976), in\narguing that their conditions of confinement amount to\nunconstitutional punishment. In Tyrrell, we:\n\n       affirm[ed] the district court’s holding that the\n       state violated the due process clause of the\n       Fourteenth Amendment in arbitrarily imposing\n       materially greater restrictions on the freedom of\n       this pre-trial detainee than those imposed on\n       convicted prisoners at Graterford, since the only\n       legitimate state interest in the detention of an\n       accused who cannot raise bail is in guaranteeing\n       his presence at trial.\n\nId. at 827 (citations omitted). Plaintiffs therefore claim that the\npractice of triple-celling pretrial detainees at Gander Hill —\nwhich did involve the imposition of materially greater\nrestrictions upon detainees in the West Wing than upon the\nconvicted prisoners in the East Wing — was a violation of the\nDue Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n        We find several problems with Plaintiffs’ reliance upon\nTyrrell. First, the above-quoted statement was undermined by\nthe Supreme Court’s subsequent decision in Bell. See 441 U.S.\nat 539-40 (“we do not accept [the] argument that the\nGovernment’s interest in ensuring a detainee’s presence at trial\nis the only objective that may justify restraints and conditions\nonce the decision is lawfully made to confine a person. . . . [T]he\n\n                                15\n\feffective management of the detention facility . . . is [also] a\nvalid objective that may justify imposition of conditions and\nrestrictions of pretrial detention and dispel any inference that\nsuch restrictions are intended as punishment”) (emphasis in\noriginal). Thus, Plaintiffs were not triple-celled “arbitrarily” as\nsuggested by Tyrrell, but in furtherance of the government’s\nlegitimate interest in managing the severe overcrowding at\nGander Hill. See Section II.A., supra.\n\n       Furthermore, we note that nowhere in Bell did the\nSupreme Court suggest that if detainees are treated differently\nor worse than convicted inmates, they are ipso facto being\n“punished” in violation of the Due Process Clause. Rather, the\nultimate question under Bell is whether “a particular condition\nor restriction of pretrial detention is reasonably related to a\nlegitimate governmental objective,” 441 U.S. at 549; if so, it is\nirrelevant whether or not that condition is also imposed upon\nconvicted inmates.         Simply put, conditions that are\n“comparatively worse” or “less comfortable” for pretrial\ndetainees than for convicted inmates are not by themselves\ntantamount to punishment, and to the extent that Tyrrell\nsuggests otherwise, it is no longer valid after Bell.\n\n       In light of the foregoing analysis, we conclude that\nPlaintiffs were not punished in violation of the Due Process\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n                               III.\n\n      Even if we had found that Plaintiffs had been subjected\nto unconstitutional punishment, they can prevail only by\n\n                                16\n\fshowing under the second step of Saucier that the constitutional\nright violated was “clearly established” at the time it occurred.\n533 U.S. at 201. “[A] right is clearly established for purposes\nof qualified immunity when its contours are ‘sufficiently clear\nthat a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing\nviolates that right.’” Williams v.

The District\nCourt found that triple-celling could not be considered\npunishment, as it was initiated in response to overcrowding at\nGander Hill. Id. at 541. Deferring to the prison officials’\ndetermination that triple-celling of pre-trial detainees is one way\nof dealing with overcrowded facilities, the Court found this\naction was not arbitrary or purposeless so as to constitute\npunishment.\n\n\n\n\n       The majority proceeds to follow the two-step analysis\nrequired to determine whether the prison officials are entitled to\nqualified immunity and holds that the triple-bunking to which\nthe detainees were subjected did not constitute a violation of\ntheir due process rights. I respectfully disagree.\n\n\n\n\n      The conditions at Gander Hill were fully described in\nHubbard I. I reiterate them because they form the basis for my\nconclusion contrary to that of my colleagues.\n\n\n\n\n       Plaintiffs claim that triple-celling requires\n       someone to sleep on a mattress that must be\n       placed on the cell floor adjacent to a toilet. . . .\n\n\n                                22\n\f        The defendants concede that an inmate\nmust sleep on a floor mattress when three are\nhoused in a given cell. When that happens, the\nnewest arrival is required to sleep on a mattress\non the floor until one of his cellmates is released\nor moved. That frees a bunk for the inmate who\nhad been on the floor mattress, and any new\narrival in that cell would then take his place on\nthe floor mattress.\n\n\n\n\n        The cells range in size from 69 to 76\nsquare feet, and the net unencumbered space in\nthe cell (gross footage of 69-76 square feet less\nspace required for a bed, mattress, desk and toilet)\nis less than 50 square feet or 16 square feet per\noccupant of each tripled cell. Plaintiffs claim that\nthe bunk bed and floor mattress leave extremely\nlimited space for three adult men to move about in\nthe cell. . . .\n\n\n\n\n       Plaintiffs claim that the deprivations are\nexacerbated because sleeping on the floor forces\ndetainees to sleep very near the open toilet. This\nhas purportedly resulted in urine and feces\nregularly splashing on whomever is relegated to\nthe floor mattress.\n\n\n                        23\n\f399 F.3d at 154-55.\n\n\n\n\n        Appellants claim that the conditions caused serious\ninjuries, including a broken leg and an infected shin, as well as\ndiscomfort and disease associated with sleeping on a concrete\nfloor. These conditions have repeatedly been brought to the\nattention of the district court judges of the District of Delaware\nbut no judge has characterized them as unconstitutional. In\ncontrast to those district court judges, the District Judge whose\norder is the subject of this appeal, and my colleagues in the\nmajority, I can reach no conclusion other than the conditions\nalleged meet the standard of the Fourteenth Amendment – that\nthe conditions “shock[] the conscience.” Rochin v. California,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104943\"><a href=\"/opinion/104943/rochin-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">342</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">165</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 172 (1952). They shock my conscience,\nparticularly because the conditions apply to pre-trial detainees\nwho have not been convicted, some of whom are imprisoned\nbecause they cannot afford bail. Admittedly, judges have\nvarying consciences and I would not and do not comment on the\nconsciences of other judges. I merely state that when the status\nof Appellants as pre-trial detainees is combined with the\nunchallenged fact that at least some of the detainees are subject\nto these horrific conditions noted by this court in Hubbard I for\nas long as two to seven months, my conscience is shocked.\nThus, I believe that Appellants have adequately alleged a\nviolation of their constitutional right to due process.\n\n\n\n\n                               24\n\f        Once the courts determine that a constitutional violation\nexists, it is no answer that the state or local government has\ninsufficient funds to remedy the unconstitutional situation.

The Court\nheld that the conditions in that case did not constitute cruel and\nunusual punishment. Justice Brennan’s concurrence noted that\nthe Court had “upheld the exercise of wide discretion by trial\ncourts to correct conditions of confinement found to be\nunconstitutional.” Id. at 356 n.4 (Brennan, J., concurring). His\nlanguage is particularly applicable here:\n\n\n\n                               25\n\fPublic apathy and the political powerlessness of\ninmates have contributed to the pervasive neglect\nof the prisons. . . .

The court stated that:\n\n\n\n\n       [l]ack of funds is not an acceptable excuse for\n       unconstitutional conditions of incarceration. An\n       immediate answer, if the state cannot otherwise\n       resolve the problem of overcrowding, will be to\n       transfer or release some inmates. The district\n       court shall also satisfy itself that no additional\n       prisoners will be confined at the Cummins Prison\n       Farm if their confinement will result in continued\n       overcrowding and perpetuation of conditions\n       which fail to provide optimum safety and\n       sanitation for every inmate.\n\n\n\n\nId.\n\n                              27\n\f        I am satisfied that the first requirement for consideration\nof qualified immunity has been met, i.e., that the conditions\napplicable to pre-trial detainees violate their due process rights.\nOn the other hand, I cannot disagree with the majority’s\ndetermination that the constitutional right was not clearly\nestablished, and indeed has not been clearly established to this\nday.      The Supreme Court’s leading case on prison\novercrowding, Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 541, merely held that\ndouble-bunking of pre-trial detainees was not unconstitutional\nunder the conditions found there. The Court has not since been\npresented with a record such as that in this case where the pre-\ntrial detainees are triple-bunked, with the third detainee obliged\nto lie on the floor with a thin mattress. Because of the absence\nof any controlling authority, the prison officials are entitled to\nqualified immunity.\n\n\n\n\n       It is my hope that this court will hold that triple-bunking\nunder conditions such as those present here violate the due\nprocess rights of the pre-trial detainees. Once we render such an\nopinion, future prison officials would no longer be entitled to\nqualified immunity and the state would be obliged to exercise its\npower to raise the funds necessary to correct the prison\nconditions. Data recently published by the International Centre\nfor Prison Studies at King’s College London reported that the\nUnited States has almost 2.3 million individuals behind bars,\nmore than any other nation. See Adam Liptak, Inmate Count in\nU.S. Dwarfs Other Nations’, N.Y. Times, Apr. 23, 2008, at A1.\nSurely it is the responsibility of the courts to ensure that\n\n\n                                28\n\fprisoners are housed in facilities that meet constitutional\nstandards.\n\n\n\n\n                            29\n\f</pre>",
