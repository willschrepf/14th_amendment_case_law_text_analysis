Nanticoke Memorial defended its actions, citing\nconcerns about the quality of care Dr. Pamintuan had been\nproviding. On summary judgment, the District Court ruled\nthat Dr. Pamintuan did not have standing to sue Nanticoke\nMemorial under Title VII because she was not an employee\nof the hospital. In addition, the District Court held that Dr.\nPamintuan had failed to present sufficient evidence to\nsupport her claims of disparate treatment under 42 U.S.C.\nS 1981. Finally, the District Court found that the Health\nCare Quality Improvement Act, 42 U.S.C. S 11101 et seq.,\nprecluded a state law damage award. We will affirm.\n\nI.\n\nThe facts, stated in the light most favorable to Dr.\nPamintuan, are taken in large part from the District Court's\nopinion. See Pamintuan v. Nanticoke Mem'l Hosp. , C.A. 96-\n233, 1998 WL 743680 (D. Del. Oct. 15, 1998). Dr.\nPamintuan, who is of Filipino descent, has been licensed to\npractice medicine in Delaware since 1971, specializing in\nobstetrics and gynecology. Until her suspension, she had\nstaff privileges at Nanticoke Memorial. These privileges had\nbeen renewed periodically, most recently in 1992 for a two-\nyear period, and included admitting, treating, and\nconsulting patients at Nanticoke Memorial.\n\n                                 2\n\fA. Obstetrics and Gynecology Departmental\nMeetings\n\nBeginning in December 1990, the minutes of the\n 840<!>Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology1   monthly\n\nmeetings began to reflect concern with Dr. Pamintuan's\nperformance. Most of these notations indicate that she had\nfailed to comply with hospital policy concerning response\ntime and progress notes. For example, the minutes from the\nDecember 1990 meeting reveal that the nursing supervisor\nfiled a report documenting Dr. Pamintuan's failure, in\nviolation of hospital bylaws, to timely respond to a call\nregarding a cesarean section.2 Minutes from the December\n1991 and January 1992 meetings record Dr. Pamintuan's\nfailure to promptly enter a patient's progress notes; as a\nresult the OB/GYN Department sent Dr. Pamintuan a\nmemo regarding the need for timely charting.\n\nSimilar concerns regarding delinquent charting were\nraised at the September 1992 meeting:\n\n       This was a patient from the clinic admitted on 7/21/92\n       with acute pyelonephritis during pregnancy and stayed\n       in the hospital for five days. Problem: no H & P, no\n       progress notes and all orders were verbal except for\n       admission and discharge. This chart was incomplete\n       for two months. Only two entries were made. This\n       chart was needed for a second admission and no\n       documentation was present to assist with the second\n       admission.\n\nApp. at B-305. As before, Dr. Pamintuan was sent a memo\nabout the incident. At the next meeting, the OB/GYN\nDepartment voted to send the chart to Nanticoke\nMemorial's Quality Assurance Committee for further\ninvestigation because \"the Department of OB feels that\npatient care was compromised in this case because of the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. From 1990 through 1993, the OB/GYN Department consisted of five\nphysicians: Drs. Cabrera (Hispanic), Rupp (Caucasian), DeJesus-Jiloca\n(Filipino), Tierno (Caucasian), and Pamintuan (Filipino).\n\n2. The minutes indicate that further action on this matter was precluded\nbecause \"the OB nurses did not follow the Hospital Communication\nPolicy of beeping first or calling another physician.\"\n\n                                3\n\flack of information in the chart, which is a violation of the\nmedical staff practice in this institution.\"3 App. at B-307.\n\nConcerns about Dr. Pamintuan's timeliness, chart\ndeficiencies, and other complaints concerning her conduct\ncontinued to be documented at OB/GYN Department\nmeetings throughout 1993. In January 1993, the Director\nof Maternal/Fetal Nursing complained about Dr.\nPamintuan's response time (three hours) after being\nbeeped; Dr. Pamintuan contended that her beeper was\ndefective. In April 1993, the minutes reflect two complaints\nregarding Dr. Pamintuan. The first, from the Vice President\nof Nursing and Administration, accuses Dr. Pamintuan of\nimproperly arranging to admit a patient while she was on\nthe \"sanctions list\" for failure to keep her charts up-to-date.\nThe second, from the Director of OR Nursing, accused Dr.\nPamintuan of unnecessarily keeping the on-call team in the\noperating room from 1:45 am to 5:15 am. Dr. Pamintuan\ndenied both incidents. These incidents were discussed at\nthe May, June, July, and August 1993 meetings. Written\nstatements were requested of all parties, including Dr.\nPamintuan. In addition, the July 1993 meeting minutes\nreflect an additional complaint, from the chairperson of the\nOB/GYN Department, regarding Dr. Pamintuan's failure to\nanswer her beeper, which required that he cover the\ndelivery. Again, written statements of all those involved\nwere requested. All of these incidents were forwarded to the\nQuality Assurance Committee for review. In addition, Dr.\nRupp, the OB/GYN Department Chairperson, sent a letter\nto the Quality Assurance Committee reviewing the\ndiscussion concerning Dr. Pamintuan at the August\nOB/GYN Department meeting.\n\nIn March 1994, at the request of the Quality Assurance\nCommittee, the OB/GYN Department held a special\nmeeting to discuss Dr. Pamintuan's handling of two cases.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. With respect to this incident, Dr. Pamintuan admits that she left for\nvacation without completing the chart and, thus, the chart was\nincomplete at the time of the second admission. Dr. Pamintuan avers,\nhowever, that upon her return the chart remained incomplete because\nDr. Rupp, OB/GYN Department Chairperson, had thefile sequestered in\nhis office.\n\n                               4\n\fThe standard of care in the first case was deemed\nappropriate. The second case involved a threatened\nmiscarriage. Since only two physicians other than those\ninvolved in the case were present at the meeting, discussion\nwas tabled until the April meeting.\n\nAt the April meeting,\n\n       [i]t was unanimous department consensus that[Dr.\n       Pamintuan] should have performed a timely dilation\n       and evacuation for the patient in question. Her failure\n       to recognize and treat the apparent spontaneous\n       miscarriage was not consistent with appropriate\n       gynecological care. Action: A memo will be sent to the\n       Quality Assurance Committee of the Board with this\n       finding.\n\nApp. at B-377. The report concluded:\n\n       Administration has concern with the potential\n       demonstration of inappropriate judgment [by] the\n       above physician. Over the last 18 months there have\n       been continued questions about her judgment and\n       administration is concerned with safety of patients\n       under this physician's care.\n\nApp. at B-377.\n\nBesides Dr. Pamintuan's cases, other physicians' cases\nhaving complications were presented for review at the\nOB/GYN Department meetings. Like Dr. Pamintuan's, these\ncases were selected for review by the nurses. According to\nDr. Pamintuan, during the time period January 1, 1992\nthrough September 1994, there were \"at least\" twenty-four\ncases with complications involving OB/GYN physicians\nother than herself presented for \"Morbidity Quality\nAssurance Review.\" Of these twenty-four cases, Dr.\nPamintuan contended that \"fifteen . . . involved morbidities\nthat were more severe and reflected a lesser quality of care\nthan were reflected in the two cases for which[she] was\nsubjected to Professional Review Action by the Hospital\nAdministration and its subordinate boards and\ncommittees.\" According to Dr. Pamintuan, \"nearly all of the\nmorbidities resulted after care provided by the three . . .\nCaucasian physicians in the OB/GYN Department.\" The\n\n                               5\n\fminutes of the OB/GYN Department meetings, however, do\nnot indicate that either the OB/GYN Department or Dr.\nPamintuan (who was the reviewing physician in seven of\nthe twenty-four cases) found quality of care issues in these\ncases. The minutes state, for the most part, that the level\nof care administered was \"appropriate,\" there was \"no\nproblem,\" or the \"standard of care was met.\" According to\nthe minutes, Dr. Pamintuan was the only OB/GYN\nphysician whose conduct warranted review by the Quality\nAssurance Committee.4\n\nB. The Review Process\n\n       1. Quality Assurance Committee\n\nIn August 1993, upon the request of the OB/GYN\nDepartment, the Quality Assurance Committee5 reviewed\nDr. Pamintuan's cases for the previous three years. The\nQuality Assurance Committee identified several areas of\nconcern regarding Dr. Pamintuan's patient care.\nSubsequently, the Committee met with Dr. Pamintuan to\ndiscuss its findings and proposed recommendations.\nAlthough Dr. Pamintuan initially agreed with aspects of the\nQuality Assurance Committee's proposed recommendations,\nshe ultimately rejected them, claiming that confidentiality\nhad been breached. As a result, the matter was referred to\nthe Executive Committee for review and action.\n\n       2. The Executive Committee6\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4. The minutes indicate that Dr. Pamintuan was not the only physician\ncited for lack of availability. The April and May 1992 minutes record an\nincident involving a physician who failed to respond to a delivery\nbecause he was in surgery. In response, the OB/GYN Department\ndetermined that \" `it is the responsibility of the Obstetrician to be\npresent\nfor delivery or arrange for another Obstetrician to be present.' \"\n\n5. The Quality Assurance Committee is responsible for, inter alia, \"the\nduty to assure the safety of patients and that patient care and hospital\nservices, including the medical care provided by physicians at the\nHospital, are the most appropriate for the health of the patient and of\nhighest quality possible.\"\n\n6. The Executive Committee is comprised of the officers of the medical\nstaff, the chairpersons of each department, the ICU director, and the\nEmergency Department director.\n\n                               6\n\fIn May 1994, the Executive Committee, finding the\nQuality Assurance Committee's recommendations\nunworkable, voted unanimously to suspend Dr.\nPamintuan's clinical privileges pending further\ninvestigation. Dr. Pamintuan was notified by letter of the\nExecutive Committee's decision. In response to a \"Request\nfor Investigation Concerning Possible Professional Review\nAction\" submitted by the Quality Assurance Committee, the\nExecutive Committee met with Dr. Pamintuan to discuss\nher suspension and the need for a formal investigation. At\nthe meeting, the Executive Committee opted to reject Dr.\nPamintuan's proposal for an informal intervention and\nvoted unanimously to continue her suspension.\n\nRather than request a hearing, Dr. Pamintuan and\nNanticoke Memorial agreed that she would take a six-\nmonth leave of absence beginning July 1, 1994, during\nwhich her suspension would be terminated and the formal\ninvestigation held in abeyance.\n\n       3. Investigating Committee\n\nOn September 26, 1994, Dr. Pamintuan's attorney\nrequested that the Executive Committee proceed with a\nformal investigation. An Investigating Committee was\nformed to review Dr. Pamintuan's patient care. The\nmembers of the Investigating Committee were selected to\nensure broad representation with respect to gender,\nethnicity, and medical practice, where possible requesting\nfemale and Filipino physician participation.\n\nThe Investigating Committee was charged with reviewing\nsix of Dr. Pamintuan's cases, with each member assigned\nto one case (one physician was assigned to two cases). Of\nthe six cases reviewed, the Investigating Committee found\n\"quality issues\" in four and was unable to reach a\nconclusion regarding a fifth because of insufficient\ndocumentation of the complications that had occurred. On\nNovember 30, 1994, the Investigating Committee reported\nits findings to the Executive Committee.\n\nFollowing a review of the findings of the Investigating\nCommittee and the Quality Assurance Committee, the\nExecutive Committee recommended that Dr. Pamintuan's\n\n                                7\n\fprivileges be restored, conditioned on her completion of\neither an OB/GYN residency retraining program or a review\ncourse and recertification. Dr. Pamintuan was notified of\nthe Executive Committee's decision by letter, which also\ndocumented the Committee's findings with respect to the\ndeficiencies in Dr. Pamintuan's performance.\n\n       4. Judicial Review Committee\n\nIn January 1995, Dr. Pamintuan invoked her rights and\nrequested a hearing. A Judicial Review Committee 7 and\nhearing officer were appointed. Hearings took place over\nseveral days in April and May 1995, during which Dr.\nPamintuan was present and represented by counsel.\n\nThe Judicial Review Committee approved the Executive\nCommittee's recommendation that Dr. Pamintuan\nundertake one of two retraining options as a condition of\nreinstatement. The Judicial Review Committee based its\ndecision on a detailed and extensive review of the record,\nwhich led it to conclude that Dr. Pamintuan had\"exhibited\na pattern of inadequate record-keeping; unacceptable\ndelays in providing necessary treatments; exposing patients\nto unacceptable risks; poor medical judgment[;] and[ ]\ndisregard of hospital policies.\" App. at B-48.\n\n       5. Appeal Board\n\nDr. Pamintuan appealed the Judicial Review Committee\ndecision before the Appeal Board of Nanticoke Memorial.\nFollowing briefing and oral argument, the Appeal Board\naffirmed the decision of the Judicial Review Committee. In\nJanuary 1996, Nanticoke Memorial's governing body\nadopted the opinion of the Appeal Board. In addition, an\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n7. Like the Investigating Committee, the six members of the Judicial\nReview Committee were selected by the president of the medical staff and\nan attempt was made to include medical staff who had not previously\nevaluated Dr. Pamintuan and who were not in direct economic\ncompetition with her. Because of this latter provision, however, none of\nthe physicians who evaluated her performance specialized in obstetrics\nand gynecology.\n\n                               8\n\fadverse action report was filed with the Delaware Medical\nPractice Board.8\n\nC. Dr. Pamintuan's Contentions and Evidentiary\n       Support\n\n       1. Disparate Treatment\n\nDr. Pamintuan contends that Nanticoke Memorial used\nthe alleged deficiencies in her performance as a pretext for\nits actual discriminatory motive. She alleges that the\nactions taken against her were more severe than the\nsanctions imposed on non-Filipino physicians with similar\nrecords.\n\nRegarding charting, Dr. Pamintuan contends that record-\nkeeping problems at Nanticoke Memorial were long-\nstanding and involved many physicians, not just Dr.\nPamintuan. As early as March 1990, Executive Committee\nmeeting notes indicate that physicians were delinquent in\ntheir record keeping, with two (neither of them Dr.\nPamintuan) on the delinquent chart list for several months.\n\nAccording to the minutes, these latter physicians'\ncharting delinquencies were severe enough to jeopardize\ntheir reappointment. According to Dr. Pamintuan, during\nthe last two weeks of her summary suspension, thirty\npercent of the hospital's medical staff was delinquent in\ncompleting charts. Dr. Pamintuan contends that since her\ntermination the Nanticoke Memorial has indicated a\n\"willingness to positively respond to other physicians\"\nconcerning delinquent charting. Specifically, Dr. Pamintuan\npoints to two letters indicating that the charting\ndelinquency problem has continued to be a hospital-wide\nconcern since her suspension.\n\nLike the charting problem, Dr. Pamintuan contends that\nresponse time has been a long-standing concern at\nNanticoke Memorial. She points to the February 12, 1990\nminutes of the OB/GYN Department meeting, which record\nthat \"[t]he OB nursing staff has concerns in regard to\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n8. For a more detailed discussion of the review action, see Pamintuan v.\nNanticoke Mem'l Hosp., Inc., C.A. No. 96-233, 1997 WL 129338 (D. Del.\nFeb. 24, 1997).\n\n                                9\n\fhaving difficulty reaching some OB physicians by beeper\nand/or phone.\" In response, the OB/GYN Department\nadopted a policy whereby detailed records were to be kept\nregarding each physician's response time and availability,\nsuch that the Department would be able to review cases\nand correct any problems.\n\nDr. Pamintuan argues with respect to clinical evaluations\nthat Nanticoke Memorial failed to perform a valid\ncomparative review of her performance with that of her\ncolleagues. According to Dr. Pamintuan, the only way\nNanticoke Memorial can establish that she was \"in fact\"\nsubject to the same standard of quality review as other\nphysicians would be by a comparative review analysis. In\nsupport of her argument, Dr. Pamintuan proffers the\ntestimony of two physicians, Dr. Andrew Stiber9 and Dr.\nThomas Dyer,10 both of whom testified at the Judicial\nReview Committee hearings. According to Dr. Dyer,\n\n       in fairness I think that you have to review twenty-five\n       consecutive cases of any practitioner, and also\n       compare him to other people doing the same work. . ..\n       If the quality assurance is questioned, the statistical\n       consort that you could make a valid judgment on is\n       twenty-five consecutive cases. And then of course the\n       standard of care is what you're comparing it to, so you\n       want to find out what another practitioner or other\n       practitioners do with the same kind of case. I think\n       that anecdotes are a problem.\n\nApp. at B-423 to B-424. Dr. Stiber, who provided a written\nreview of Dr. Pamintuan's performance in the four cases\nbefore the Judicial Review Committee, found Dr.\nPamintuan's care in all instances to have been appropriate.\nHe concluded by stating:\n\n       Finally, after reviewing all four cases, I am very\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n9. Dr. Stiber is a clinical Associate Professor at New York University\nMedical Center and former Chairperson, Section 1, District II, of the\nAmerican College of Obstetrics and Gynecology.\n\n10. At the time of Dr. Pamintuan's review action, Dr. Dyer had been a\npracticing OG/GYN for nearly 30 years and Chairperson of the OB/GYN\nCommittee at Milford Memorial Hospital for more than 25 years.\n\n                                10\n\f       concerned that the issues here are not quality\n       assurance, but the issues of denying a doctor the right\n       to practice medicine.\n\nApp. at B-433.\n\nTo further substantiate her claim of disparate treatment,\nDr. Pamintuan points to the following excerpt from the\nExecutive Committee's January 19, 1994, meeting minutes:\n\n       QUALITY ASSURANCE: A representative from the\n       Quality Assurance Committee reported a problem with\n       a provider that caused a focus review on the provider's\n       care. Some timely action must be taken to move\n       forward and protect patients. A memo is being drafted\n       to outline steps to prevent professional review action\n       and allow this person to practice in an unencumbered\n       fashion. This type of intervention has worked in the\n       past. By the next Executive Committee meeting,\n       hopefully a volunteer program will be developed. The\n       concerns are: (1) 30% complication rate, (2) 30-40%\n       mortality rate post-op, and (3) 20-25% curative\n       infection rate. The trend will be sent to the Department\n       of Surgery. A process group with all involved will be\n       scheduled with a consensus standard developed. The\n       suggestion of a \"Pre-Op Conference\" could be helpful.\n\nApp. at B-436. Dr. Pamintuan alleges that the\naforementioned physician is Caucasian. Nanticoke\nMemorial, however, contends that all but the last three\nsentences of the excerpt refer to Dr. Pamintuan, with the\nlast three referring to a study on thoracotomy. 11\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n11. To further buttress her allegations of intentional discrimination, Dr.\nPamintuan points to instances in the past involving alleged\ndiscrimination on the part of Nanticoke Memorial towards its employees\nand its patients. Her evidence ranges from the testimony of a hospital\nemployee concerning segregation of patients in the 1950s and 1960s to\nan alleged study, a copy of which was not produced, prepared in 1979\nreporting \"community concern that there were too many foreign\nphysicians in the Emergency Room.\" Dr. Pamintuan contends that in\nresponse to the aforementioned survey, Nanticoke Memorial\ndiscriminatorily removed all of the Filipino physicians from its emergency\nroom. Dr. Pamintuan also proffers the testimony of several former\n\n                               11\n\fD. Nanticoke Memorial's Rebuttal Evidence\n\nTo rebut Dr. Pamintuan's allegations that she was\nsingled out for discipline because of her race, Nanticoke\nMemorial offered evidence that between 1990 and 1996, six\nphysicians other than Dr. Pamintuan were the subject of\nquality review that resulted in some form of action\n(voluntary or otherwise). One of the disciplined physicians\nwas Filipino; the other five were Caucasian. Dr. Pamintuan\ncontends that none of these physicians or situations is\ncomparable to the case at bar.\n\nNanticoke Memorial also proffers its history of Filipino\nleadership in the medical staff. Between 1972 and 1994,\nthe period when Dr. Pamintuan had privileges at the\nhospital, six Filipinos and five Caucasians served as\npresident of the medical staff. Persons elected to be\npresident serve a two-year term as president-elect and a\ntwo-year term as president. The president-elect and\npresident also serve on the board of directors of Nanticoke\nMemorial.\n\nII.\n\nSection 1981 prohibits \"racial\" discrimination in the\nmaking of private and public contracts. See St. Francis\nCollege v. Al-Khazraji, 481 U.S. 604, 609 (1987). We analyze\nsection 1981 claims under the familiar McDonnell Douglas\nshifting burden framework used in Title VII discrimination\ncases. See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792\n(1973); Stewart v. Rutgers, The State Univ., 120 F.3d 426,\n432 (3d Cir. 1997). Under this standard, Dr. Pamintuan\nhad the burden of presenting a prima facie case of\ndiscrimination. To establish such a case under section\n1981, Dr. Pamintuan was required to produce some\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nemployees of the hospital indicating that they may have been the victims\nof discrimination. Nanticoke Memorial disputes this evidence. As the\nDistrict Court correctly noted, because of the temporal remoteness of the\nsegregation, the failure to produce the study, and the absence of any\nconnection between the individuals involved in the alleged discrimination\nand those involved in the review of Dr. Pamintuan's performance, most,\nif not all, of this evidence would not be admissible at trial.\n\n                               12\n\fevidence that would demonstrate that Nanticoke Memorial\nintentionally discriminated against her because she\nbelonged to an \"identifiable class[ ] of persons who are\nsubjected to intentional discrimination solely because of\ntheir ancestry or ethnic characteristics.\" See St. Francis\nCollege, 481 U.S. at 612, 107 S. Ct. at 2028.12\n\nOnce Dr. Pamintuan established her prima facie case, the\nburden shifted to Nanticoke Memorial to provide legitimate\nnon-discriminatory reasons for the suspension of Dr.\nPamintuan's privileges. If Nanticoke Memorial was able to\nprovide such justification, the burden reverted back to Dr.\nPamintuan to provide some evidence that these reasons\nwere pretextual. We have previously stated that, on this\npoint:\n\n       [T]o avoid summary judgment, the plaintiff 's evidence\n       rebutting the employer's proffered legitimate reasons\n       must allow a factfinder reasonably to infer that each of\n       the employer's proffered non-discriminatory reasons\n       was either a post hoc fabrication or otherwise did not\n       actually motivate the employment action (that is, the\n       proffered reason is a pretext).\n\nFuentes v. Perskie, 32 F.3d 759, 764 (3d Cir. 1994)\n(citations omitted). We continued to note that the plaintiff\ncannot rely on a showing that \"the employer's decision was\nwrong or mistaken\" because the focus of the factual dispute\nis \"whether discriminatory animus motivated the employer,\nnot whether the employer is wise, shrewd, prudent, or\ncompetent.\" Id. at 765 (citations omitted). This means that\nthe plaintiff must\n\n       demonstrate such weaknesses, implausibilities,\n       inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the\n       employer's proffered legitimate reasons for its action\n       that a reasonable factfinder could rationallyfind them\n       \"unworthy of credence,\" and hence infer \"that the\n       employer did not act for [the asserted] non-\n       discriminatory reasons.\" While this standard places a\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n12. Because our analysis turns on other areas, we will assume, without\ndeciding, that Dr. Pamintuan presented a prima facie case of\ndiscrimination.\n\n                                13\n\f       difficult burden on the plaintiff, \"[i]t arises from an\n       inherent tension between the goal of all discrimination\n       law and our society's commitment to free\n       decisionmaking by the private sector in economic\n       affairs.\"\n\nId. (citations omitted). With this standard in mind, we turn\nto the specifics of this case.\n\nFirst, we must determine whether Nanticoke Memorial\nproffered legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for its\ndecision to suspend Dr. Pamintuan. The record shows that\nNanticoke Memorial engaged in a multi-level review of Dr.\nPamintuan's fitness before concluding that her privileges\nshould be suspended because of quality of care concerns.\nBy the end of the internal review process, approximately\ntwenty of her peers had reviewed Dr. Pamintuan's case and\nreached the conclusion that the suspension was justified by\nthe fact that her behavior presented serious quality of care\nconcerns for the patients of the hospital. Nanticoke\nMemorial pointed to these quality of care concerns, based\non Dr. Pamintuan's pattern of inadequate record-keeping,\ndelays in providing treatment, poor medical judgment, and\ndisregard of hospital policies, as the reasons supporting the\ndecision to suspend Dr. Pamintuan's privileges. In addition,\nNanticoke Memorial notes that it offered a plan whereby Dr.\nPamintuan could retain her privileges if she agreed to\nadditional training and supervising. It was only after Dr.\nPamintuan refused this compromise that Nanticoke\nMemorial took the final step of suspending her privileges.\n\nBecause Nanticoke Memorial has proffered these\nlegitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for its disciplinary\naction, the burden shifts back to Dr. Pamintuan under\nMcDonnell Douglas \"to demonstrate such weaknesses,\nimplausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or\ncontradictions\" in the hospital's proffered reasons that a\nreasonable fact-finder could conclude that the reasons were\npretextual and that the hospital had a discriminatory\nmotive. Id. Giving Dr. Pamintuan all reasonable inferences,\nshe cannot meet this burden.\n\nTo undermine Nanticoke Memorial's proffered reasons,\nDr. Pamintuan claims that Caucasian physicians had also\n\n                               14\n\fhad charting and timeliness problems, but had not been\ndisciplined as severely as her. We note, however, that Dr.\nPamintuan's suspension was not based solely on her\ndeficiencies concerning charting and timeliness, but was\ngrounded in large part on Nanticoke Memorial's concerns\nabout the quality of care she was providing to the hospital's\npatients.\n\nDr. Pamintuan asserts that her own statements that she\ndid not have significant clinical deficiencies were sufficient\nto create a question for the fact-finder. We have recognized\nthat a plaintiff's own affidavit providing circumstantial\nevidence of discrimination may in certain cases be\nsufficient by itself to withstand a defendant's motion for\nsummary judgment. See Weldon v. Kraft, Inc., 896 F.2d\n793, 800 (3d Cir. 1990); Jackson v. University of Pittsburgh,\n826 F.2d 230, 236 (3d Cir. 1987). However, this is not such\na case.\n\nThe testimony offered by the plaintiffs in Weldon and\nJackson is distinguishable from that offered by Dr.\nPamintuan. In both Weldon and Jackson, the plaintiffs\noffered testimony that, if believed, gave clear indication that\nthey were discriminated against and treated differently\nbecause of their race. Here, Dr. Pamintuan's testimony is\nessentially limited to the claim that her medical care was\nnot deficient. Notably, she does not claim that the\ncriticisms contained in the OB/GYN minutes were\nincorrect, nor does she claim that the internal review\nprocess produced findings that were untrue. Rather, her\ndeposition testimony merely asserts that the decision\nregarding her competence as a physician was wrong. As\nnoted, Dr. Pamintuan cannot survive summary judgment\nsimply by alleging that Nanticoke Memorial's decision was\n\"wrong or mistaken.\" Fuentes, 32 F.3d at 765. Therefore,\nthese two cases do not further our analysis beyond\nstanding for the fact that, in some cases, a plaintiff 's\ntestimony may be sufficient to proceed past summary\njudgment. However, were we to find that testimony such as\nPamintuan's was sufficient to survive summary judgment\non the issue of pretext, we would undermine the entire\nMcDonnell Douglas framework by drastically limiting the\npossibility that summary judgment could be granted\n\n                               15\n\fbecause virtually any contrary testimony by a plaintiff\nwould preclude a grant of summary judgment to the\ndefendants.\n\nDr. Pamintuan also alleges that she is entitled to an\ninference of pretext because the hospital did not conduct a\ncomparative review evaluating her performance in\ncomparison to that of other physicians at the hospital. This\nargument fails because she has not alleged or offered any\nevidence that any other physicians were granted a\ncomparative review when facing disciplinary proceedings.\nSo, rather than complaining that she was treated differently\nfrom others because of her race, she appears to be\ncomplaining that she was not treated differently. Indeed,\nDr. Pamintuan was accorded the same review process that\nall Nanticoke Memorial physicians received. The extensive\nmulti-tiered review process went on for several months. Dr.\nPamintuan was allowed to present evidence and make\narguments at all the appropriate procedural times. While\nDr. Pamintuan may claim that a comparative review would\nhave benefitted her cause, the lack of such a review does\nnothing to support her argument that she was\ndiscriminated against based on her race.\n\nDr. Pamintuan's evidence was, for the most part,\nanecdotal and inadmissable. Much of the evidence related\nto events that occurred several years before any action was\ntaken against her.13 In short, Dr. Pamintuan has pointed to\nno substantial evidence that contradicts or undermines\nNanticoke Hospital's legitimate reason for her suspension\n-- concern about the quality of care that she was providing.\n\nThus, Dr. Pamintuan has failed to submit evidence from\nwhich a reasonable factfinder could conclude that\nNanticoke Memorial's proffered legitimate, non-\ndiscriminatory reasons for her suspension were pretextual.\nDr. Pamintuan was accorded a lengthy and intense review\nprocess. Throughout the process, she was treated the same\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n13. The District Court correctly noted that much of the evidence relied\non by Dr. Pamintuan to show pretext would not be admissible at trial.\nTherefore, it is not proper to consider such evidence on summary\njudgment. See Pamintuan, 1998 WL 743680, at *11 (citing Wetzel v.\nTucker, 139 F.3d 380, 383 n.2 (2d Cir. 1998)).\n\n                               16\n\fas any other physician. Although she contends that the\nultimate decision reached by her peers was incorrect, more\nmust be shown to survive summary judgment. Therefore,\nwe affirm the District Court's grant of summary judgment\nto Nanticoke Memorial on her various claims of racial\ndiscrimination.14\n\nIII.\n\nDr. Pamintuan's final contention is that the District\nCourt erred when it held that Nanticoke Memorial was\nimmune from damages for the alleged violations of state law\nunder the Health Care Quality Improvement Act, 42 U.S.C.\nS 11101 et seq. (\"HCQIA\").15 Under the HCQIA, a health\ncare provider is immune from suit brought as the result of\na \"professional review action,\"16 see 42 U.S.C. S 11111(a), if\nthe review action was undertaken:\n\n         (1) in the reasonable belief that the action was in the\n         furtherance of quality health care,\n\n       (2) after a reasonable effort to obtain the facts of the\n       matter,\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n14. In light of our finding that Dr. Pamintuan failed to provide\nsufficient\nevidence that Nanticoke Memorial's proffered reasons were pretextual, we\nneed not address her argument that she was qualified as an employee\nfor Title VII purposes. The District Court ruled that she did not qualify\nas an employee, and so lacked standing to bring a Title VII suit.\nHowever, even if we were to favor Dr. Pamintuan's argument that she did\nin fact qualify as an employee under Title VII, her Title VII suit would\nalso fail because it is subject to the same shifting burdens test that her\nsection 1981 suit failed to fulfill.\n\n15. The HCQIA immunity provisions do not cover damages under section\n1981. See 42 U.S.C. S 11111(a)(1).\n\n16. A \"professional review action\" is defined as:\n\n         an action or recommendation of a professional review body which is\n         taken or made in the conduct of a professional review activity,\nwhich\n         is based on the competence or professional conduct of an individual\n         physician (which conduct affects or could affect adversely the\nhealth\n       or welfare of a patient or patients), and which affects (or may\naffect)\n       adversely the clinical privileges, or membership in a professional\n       society, of the physician.\n\f42 U.S.C. S 11151(9).\n\n                        17\n\f       (3) after adequate notice and hearing procedures are\n       afforded to the physician involved or after such other\n       procedure as are fair to the physician under the\n       circumstances, and\n\n       (4) in the reasonable belief that the action was\n       warranted by the facts known after such reasonable\n       effort to obtain facts and after meeting the requirement\n       of paragraph (3).\n\n       A professional review action shall be presumed to have\n       met the preceding standards necessary for [immunity]\n       unless the presumption is rebutted by a preponderance\n       of the evidence.\n\n42 U.S.C. S 11112(a) (emphasis added). Therefore, under\nthe HCQIA, Dr. Pamintuan had the burden of establishing\nthat the hospital did not meet the standard for immunity.\nSee Brader v. Allegheny Gen. Hosp., 167 F.3d 832, 839 (3d\nCir. 1999). In other words, the HCQIA alters the summary\njudgment burden because Dr. Pamintuan, the non-mover\nfor summary judgment, had the burden of demonstrating\nthat a reasonable fact finder could find by a preponderance\nof the evidence that Nanticoke Memorial had not met the\nabove requirements and had acted unreasonably. The\nDistrict Court found that she failed to meet this burden. We\nagree.\n\nIn the District Court, Dr. Pamintuan argued that\nNanticoke Memorial's refusal to undertake a comparative\nanalysis by examining the records of other physicians, and\nits refusal to credit the testimony of her expert, Dr. Dyer,\nsufficiently rebutted the statutory presumption. Dr.\nPamintuan also argues that the District Court'sfinding that\nshe had stated a claim for racial discrimination should\nentitle her to survive summary judgment because a\ndecision based on race is per se unreasonable.\n\nWe judge Nanticoke Memorial's actions using an objective\ntest, thus the good or bad faith (or subjective motivations)\nof the reviewers is irrelevant. See id. at 840. The\n\"reasonable belief \" standard is satisfied \"if the reviewers,\nwith the information available to them at the time of the\nprofessional review action, would reasonably have\nconcluded that their actions would restrict incompetent\n\n                               18\n\fbehavior or would protect patients.\" Id. (citations and\ninternal quotation marks omitted). Thus, Dr. Pamintuan's\nargument that her allegations of discriminatory motivation\nare sufficient to rebut the presumption of immunity under\nthe HCQIA is incorrect. Instead, under the first prong, Dr.\nPamintuan must show that the totality of the information\navailable to the Nanticoke Memorial reviewers did not\nprovide a basis for a reasonable belief that their actions\nwould further quality health care. Dr. Pamintuan failed to\nmake such a showing. Because the inquiry was reasonable,\nand a reasonable factfinder could not find an absence of a\nreasonable basis for the actions of Nanticoke Memorial and\nthe Committee, the District Court correctly held that the\nHCQIA precluded the award of state law damages to Dr.\nPamituan.\n\nDr. Pamintuan's arguments actually address the second\nrequirement -- \"after a reasonable effort to obtain the facts\nof the matter.\" First, she claims that the review was\nunreasonable because Nanticoke Memorial refused to\nconsider the records of other OB/GYNs at the hospital. The\nNinth Circuit Court of Appeals has previously dealt with\nthis argument under the HCQIA. See Smith v. Ricks, 31\nF.3d 1478 (9th Cir. 1994). The court stated:\n\n       [The doctor's] challenge to [the] investigation is that he\n       was not permitted to discover or introduce evidence\n       regarding the conduct of other doctors. [The doctor]\n       essentially claims he was not the worst doctor at[the\n       hospital]. However, nothing in the statute, legislative\n       history, or case law suggests the competency of other\n       doctors is relevant in evaluating whether [the hospital]\n       conducted a reasonable investigation into [a doctor's]\n       conduct.\n\nId. at 1486 (emphasis added). We agree with the Ninth\nCircuit Court of Appeals. The focus of our inquiry under the\nHCQIA is not whether Dr. Pamintuan was or was not a\nsubstandard doctor in comparison to the other OB/GYNs at\nNanticoke Memorial, but whether Nanticoke Memorial's\ndisciplinary actions were justified after a reasonable effort\nto obtain the facts of the matter. It was not necessary for\n\n                               19\n\fthe hospital to gather evidence of other doctors' records to\nfulfill the reasonable fact gathering requirement. 17\n\nLooking at the \"totality of the process leading up to\"\nNanticoke Memorial's professional review action, it is clear\nthat the hospital made a reasonable effort to obtain the\nfacts of the matter. Matthews v. Lancaster Gen. Hosp., 87\nF.3d 624, 637 (3d Cir. 1996). The lengthy review process\ntook place in front of several evaluators over a period of\nseveral months. The inquiry culminated with approximately\ntwenty-five hours of hearings before Nanticoke Memorial's\nJudicial Review Committee. Dr. Pamintuan was allowed to\npresent all of her evidence and arguments before the\nJudicial Review Committee made its decision. Because the\ninquiry was reasonable, and a reasonable fact finder could\nnot objectively find that either Nanticoke Memorial's or the\nCommittee's actions were not motivated by a reasonable\nbelief that the actions would be in furtherance of quality\nhealth care, the District Court correctly held that the\nHCQIA precluded the award of state law damages to Dr.\nPamintuan.\n\nIV.\n\nBecause Dr. Pamintuan failed to provide sufficient\nevidence that Nanticoke Memorial's decision to suspend her\nprivileges was pretextual and because she failed to rebut\nthe presumption of immunity under the HCQIA, we affirm\nthe District Court's grant of summary judgment to\nNanticoke Memorial.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n17. Dr. Pamintuan's other challenge to Nanticoke Memorial's fact\ngathering process is that the hospital improvidently rejected the\ntestimony of her expert, Dr. Dyer. In her brief, Dr. Pamintuan claims\nthat the Dr. Dyer's testimony was precluded by some objection by\nHospital counsel. Appellant's Brief at 28. However, looking at the record,\nit appears that the Hospital Committee simply chose not to adopt her\nexpert's testimony and suggestions to use more cases for evaluation.\n\n\n                               20\n\fA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n\n                               21\n\f",

Nanticoke Memorial defended its actions, citing\nconcerns about the quality of care Dr. Pamintuan had been\nproviding. On summary judgment, the District Court ruled\nthat Dr. Pamintuan did not have standing to sue Nanticoke\nMemorial under Title VII because she was not an employee\nof the hospital. In addition, the District Court held that Dr.\nPamintuan had failed to present sufficient evidence to\nsupport her claims of disparate treatment under 42 U.S.C.\nS 1981. Finally, the District Court found that the Health\nCare Quality Improvement Act, 42 U.S.C. S 11101 et seq.,\nprecluded a state law damage award. We will affirm.\n\nI.\n\nThe facts, stated in the light most favorable to Dr.\nPamintuan, are taken in large part from the District Court's\nopinion. See Pamintuan v. Nanticoke Mem'l Hosp. , C.A. 96-\n233, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">743680</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D. Del. Oct. 15, 1998). Dr.\nPamintuan, who is of Filipino descent, has been licensed to\npractice medicine in Delaware since 1971, specializing in\nobstetrics and gynecology. Until her suspension, she had\nstaff privileges at Nanticoke Memorial. These privileges had\nbeen renewed periodically, most recently in 1992 for a two-\nyear period, and included admitting, treating, and\nconsulting patients at Nanticoke Memorial.\n\n                                 2\n\fA. Obstetrics and Gynecology Departmental\nMeetings\n\nBeginning in December 1990, the minutes of the\n 840<!>Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology1   monthly\n\nmeetings began to reflect concern with Dr. Pamintuan's\nperformance. Most of these notations indicate that she had\nfailed to comply with hospital policy concerning response\ntime and progress notes. For example, the minutes from the\nDecember 1990 meeting reveal that the nursing supervisor\nfiled a report documenting Dr. Pamintuan's failure, in\nviolation of hospital bylaws, to timely respond to a call\nregarding a cesarean section.2 Minutes from the December\n1991 and January 1992 meetings record Dr. Pamintuan's\nfailure to promptly enter a patient's progress notes; as a\nresult the OB/GYN Department sent Dr. Pamintuan a\nmemo regarding the need for timely charting.\n\nSimilar concerns regarding delinquent charting were\nraised at the September 1992 meeting:\n\n       This was a patient from the clinic admitted on 7/21/92\n       with acute pyelonephritis during pregnancy and stayed\n       in the hospital for five days. Problem: no H & P, no\n       progress notes and all orders were verbal except for\n       admission and discharge. This chart was incomplete\n       for two months. Only two entries were made. This\n       chart was needed for a second admission and no\n       documentation was present to assist with the second\n       admission.\n\nApp. at B-305. As before, Dr. Pamintuan was sent a memo\nabout the incident. At the next meeting, the OB/GYN\nDepartment voted to send the chart to Nanticoke\nMemorial's Quality Assurance Committee for further\ninvestigation because \"the Department of OB feels that\npatient care was compromised in this case because of the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. From 1990 through 1993, the OB/GYN Department consisted of five\nphysicians: Drs. Cabrera (Hispanic), Rupp (Caucasian), DeJesus-Jiloca\n(Filipino), Tierno (Caucasian), and Pamintuan (Filipino).\n\n2. The minutes indicate that further action on this matter was precluded\nbecause \"the OB nurses did not follow the Hospital Communication\nPolicy of beeping first or calling another physician.\"\n\n                                3\n\flack of information in the chart, which is a violation of the\nmedical staff practice in this institution.\"3 App. at B-307.\n\nConcerns about Dr. Pamintuan's timeliness, chart\ndeficiencies, and other complaints concerning her conduct\ncontinued to be documented at OB/GYN Department\nmeetings throughout 1993. In January 1993, the Director\nof Maternal/Fetal Nursing complained about Dr.\nPamintuan's response time (three hours) after being\nbeeped; Dr. Pamintuan contended that her beeper was\ndefective. In April 1993, the minutes reflect two complaints\nregarding Dr. Pamintuan. The first, from the Vice President\nof Nursing and Administration, accuses Dr. Pamintuan of\nimproperly arranging to admit a patient while she was on\nthe \"sanctions list\" for failure to keep her charts up-to-date.\nThe second, from the Director of OR Nursing, accused Dr.\nPamintuan of unnecessarily keeping the on-call team in the\noperating room from 1:45 am to 5:15 am. Dr. Pamintuan\ndenied both incidents. These incidents were discussed at\nthe May, June, July, and August 1993 meetings. Written\nstatements were requested of all parties, including Dr.\nPamintuan. In addition, the July 1993 meeting minutes\nreflect an additional complaint, from the chairperson of the\nOB/GYN Department, regarding Dr. Pamintuan's failure to\nanswer her beeper, which required that he cover the\ndelivery. Again, written statements of all those involved\nwere requested. All of these incidents were forwarded to the\nQuality Assurance Committee for review. In addition, Dr.\nRupp, the OB/GYN Department Chairperson, sent a letter\nto the Quality Assurance Committee reviewing the\ndiscussion concerning Dr. Pamintuan at the August\nOB/GYN Department meeting.\n\nIn March 1994, at the request of the Quality Assurance\nCommittee, the OB/GYN Department held a special\nmeeting to discuss Dr. Pamintuan's handling of two cases.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. With respect to this incident, Dr. Pamintuan admits that she left for\nvacation without completing the chart and, thus, the chart was\nincomplete at the time of the second admission. Dr. Pamintuan avers,\nhowever, that upon her return the chart remained incomplete because\nDr. Rupp, OB/GYN Department Chairperson, had thefile sequestered in\nhis office.\n\n                               4\n\fThe standard of care in the first case was deemed\nappropriate. The second case involved a threatened\nmiscarriage. Since only two physicians other than those\ninvolved in the case were present at the meeting, discussion\nwas tabled until the April meeting.\n\nAt the April meeting,\n\n       [i]t was unanimous department consensus that[Dr.\n       Pamintuan] should have performed a timely dilation\n       and evacuation for the patient in question. Her failure\n       to recognize and treat the apparent spontaneous\n       miscarriage was not consistent with appropriate\n       gynecological care. Action: A memo will be sent to the\n       Quality Assurance Committee of the Board with this\n       finding.\n\nApp. at B-377. The report concluded:\n\n       Administration has concern with the potential\n       demonstration of inappropriate judgment [by] the\n       above physician. Over the last 18 months there have\n       been continued questions about her judgment and\n       administration is concerned with safety of patients\n       under this physician's care.\n\nApp. at B-377.\n\nBesides Dr. Pamintuan's cases, other physicians' cases\nhaving complications were presented for review at the\nOB/GYN Department meetings. Like Dr. Pamintuan's, these\ncases were selected for review by the nurses. According to\nDr. Pamintuan, during the time period January 1, 1992\nthrough September 1994, there were \"at least\" twenty-four\ncases with complications involving OB/GYN physicians\nother than herself presented for \"Morbidity Quality\nAssurance Review.\" Of these twenty-four cases, Dr.\nPamintuan contended that \"fifteen . . . involved morbidities\nthat were more severe and reflected a lesser quality of care\nthan were reflected in the two cases for which[she] was\nsubjected to Professional Review Action by the Hospital\nAdministration and its subordinate boards and\ncommittees.\" According to Dr. Pamintuan, \"nearly all of the\nmorbidities resulted after care provided by the three . . .\nCaucasian physicians in the OB/GYN Department.\" The\n\n                               5\n\fminutes of the OB/GYN Department meetings, however, do\nnot indicate that either the OB/GYN Department or Dr.\nPamintuan (who was the reviewing physician in seven of\nthe twenty-four cases) found quality of care issues in these\ncases. The minutes state, for the most part, that the level\nof care administered was \"appropriate,\" there was \"no\nproblem,\" or the \"standard of care was met.\" According to\nthe minutes, Dr. Pamintuan was the only OB/GYN\nphysician whose conduct warranted review by the Quality\nAssurance Committee.4\n\nB. The Review Process\n\n       1. Quality Assurance Committee\n\nIn August 1993, upon the request of the OB/GYN\nDepartment, the Quality Assurance Committee5 reviewed\nDr. Pamintuan's cases for the previous three years. The\nQuality Assurance Committee identified several areas of\nconcern regarding Dr. Pamintuan's patient care.\nSubsequently, the Committee met with Dr. Pamintuan to\ndiscuss its findings and proposed recommendations.\nAlthough Dr. Pamintuan initially agreed with aspects of the\nQuality Assurance Committee's proposed recommendations,\nshe ultimately rejected them, claiming that confidentiality\nhad been breached. As a result, the matter was referred to\nthe Executive Committee for review and action.\n\n       2. The Executive Committee6\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4. The minutes indicate that Dr. Pamintuan was not the only physician\ncited for lack of availability. The April and May 1992 minutes record an\nincident involving a physician who failed to respond to a delivery\nbecause he was in surgery. In response, the OB/GYN Department\ndetermined that \" `it is the responsibility of the Obstetrician to be\npresent\nfor delivery or arrange for another Obstetrician to be present.' \"\n\n5. The Quality Assurance Committee is responsible for, inter alia, \"the\nduty to assure the safety of patients and that patient care and hospital\nservices, including the medical care provided by physicians at the\nHospital, are the most appropriate for the health of the patient and of\nhighest quality possible.\"\n\n6. The Executive Committee is comprised of the officers of the medical\nstaff, the chairpersons of each department, the ICU director, and the\nEmergency Department director.\n\n                               6\n\fIn May 1994, the Executive Committee, finding the\nQuality Assurance Committee's recommendations\nunworkable, voted unanimously to suspend Dr.\nPamintuan's clinical privileges pending further\ninvestigation. Dr. Pamintuan was notified by letter of the\nExecutive Committee's decision. In response to a \"Request\nfor Investigation Concerning Possible Professional Review\nAction\" submitted by the Quality Assurance Committee, the\nExecutive Committee met with Dr. Pamintuan to discuss\nher suspension and the need for a formal investigation. At\nthe meeting, the Executive Committee opted to reject Dr.\nPamintuan's proposal for an informal intervention and\nvoted unanimously to continue her suspension.\n\nRather than request a hearing, Dr. Pamintuan and\nNanticoke Memorial agreed that she would take a six-\nmonth leave of absence beginning July 1, 1994, during\nwhich her suspension would be terminated and the formal\ninvestigation held in abeyance.\n\n       3. Investigating Committee\n\nOn September 26, 1994, Dr. Pamintuan's attorney\nrequested that the Executive Committee proceed with a\nformal investigation. An Investigating Committee was\nformed to review Dr. Pamintuan's patient care. The\nmembers of the Investigating Committee were selected to\nensure broad representation with respect to gender,\nethnicity, and medical practice, where possible requesting\nfemale and Filipino physician participation.\n\nThe Investigating Committee was charged with reviewing\nsix of Dr. Pamintuan's cases, with each member assigned\nto one case (one physician was assigned to two cases). Of\nthe six cases reviewed, the Investigating Committee found\n\"quality issues\" in four and was unable to reach a\nconclusion regarding a fifth because of insufficient\ndocumentation of the complications that had occurred. On\nNovember 30, 1994, the Investigating Committee reported\nits findings to the Executive Committee.\n\nFollowing a review of the findings of the Investigating\nCommittee and the Quality Assurance Committee, the\nExecutive Committee recommended that Dr. Pamintuan's\n\n                                7\n\fprivileges be restored, conditioned on her completion of\neither an OB/GYN residency retraining program or a review\ncourse and recertification. Dr. Pamintuan was notified of\nthe Executive Committee's decision by letter, which also\ndocumented the Committee's findings with respect to the\ndeficiencies in Dr. Pamintuan's performance.\n\n       4. Judicial Review Committee\n\nIn January 1995, Dr. Pamintuan invoked her rights and\nrequested a hearing. A Judicial Review Committee 7 and\nhearing officer were appointed. Hearings took place over\nseveral days in April and May 1995, during which Dr.\nPamintuan was present and represented by counsel.\n\nThe Judicial Review Committee approved the Executive\nCommittee's recommendation that Dr. Pamintuan\nundertake one of two retraining options as a condition of\nreinstatement. The Judicial Review Committee based its\ndecision on a detailed and extensive review of the record,\nwhich led it to conclude that Dr. Pamintuan had\"exhibited\na pattern of inadequate record-keeping; unacceptable\ndelays in providing necessary treatments; exposing patients\nto unacceptable risks; poor medical judgment[;] and[ ]\ndisregard of hospital policies.\" App. at B-48.\n\n       5. Appeal Board\n\nDr. Pamintuan appealed the Judicial Review Committee\ndecision before the Appeal Board of Nanticoke Memorial.\nFollowing briefing and oral argument, the Appeal Board\naffirmed the decision of the Judicial Review Committee. In\nJanuary 1996, Nanticoke Memorial's governing body\nadopted the opinion of the Appeal Board. In addition, an\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n7. Like the Investigating Committee, the six members of the Judicial\nReview Committee were selected by the president of the medical staff and\nan attempt was made to include medical staff who had not previously\nevaluated Dr. Pamintuan and who were not in direct economic\ncompetition with her. Because of this latter provision, however, none of\nthe physicians who evaluated her performance specialized in obstetrics\nand gynecology.\n\n                               8\n\fadverse action report was filed with the Delaware Medical\nPractice Board.8\n\nC. Dr. Pamintuan's Contentions and Evidentiary\n       Support\n\n       1. Disparate Treatment\n\nDr. Pamintuan contends that Nanticoke Memorial used\nthe alleged deficiencies in her performance as a pretext for\nits actual discriminatory motive. She alleges that the\nactions taken against her were more severe than the\nsanctions imposed on non-Filipino physicians with similar\nrecords.\n\nRegarding charting, Dr. Pamintuan contends that record-\nkeeping problems at Nanticoke Memorial were long-\nstanding and involved many physicians, not just Dr.\nPamintuan. As early as March 1990, Executive Committee\nmeeting notes indicate that physicians were delinquent in\ntheir record keeping, with two (neither of them Dr.\nPamintuan) on the delinquent chart list for several months.\n\nAccording to the minutes, these latter physicians'\ncharting delinquencies were severe enough to jeopardize\ntheir reappointment. According to Dr. Pamintuan, during\nthe last two weeks of her summary suspension, thirty\npercent of the hospital's medical staff was delinquent in\ncompleting charts. Dr. Pamintuan contends that since her\ntermination the Nanticoke Memorial has indicated a\n\"willingness to positively respond to other physicians\"\nconcerning delinquent charting. Specifically, Dr. Pamintuan\npoints to two letters indicating that the charting\ndelinquency problem has continued to be a hospital-wide\nconcern since her suspension.\n\nLike the charting problem, Dr. Pamintuan contends that\nresponse time has been a long-standing concern at\nNanticoke Memorial. She points to the February 12, 1990\nminutes of the OB/GYN Department meeting, which record\nthat \"[t]he OB nursing staff has concerns in regard to\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n8.

According to Dr. Pamintuan, the only way\nNanticoke Memorial can establish that she was \"in fact\"\nsubject to the same standard of quality review as other\nphysicians would be by a comparative review analysis. In\nsupport of her argument, Dr. Pamintuan proffers the\ntestimony of two physicians, Dr. Andrew Stiber9 and Dr.\nThomas Dyer,10 both of whom testified at the Judicial\nReview Committee hearings. According to Dr. Dyer,\n\n       in fairness I think that you have to review twenty-five\n       consecutive cases of any practitioner, and also\n       compare him to other people doing the same work. . ..\n       If the quality assurance is questioned, the statistical\n       consort that you could make a valid judgment on is\n       twenty-five consecutive cases. And then of course the\n       standard of care is what you're comparing it to, so you\n       want to find out what another practitioner or other\n       practitioners do with the same kind of case. I think\n       that anecdotes are a problem.\n\nApp. at B-423 to B-424. Dr. Stiber, who provided a written\nreview of Dr. Pamintuan's performance in the four cases\nbefore the Judicial Review Committee, found Dr.\nPamintuan's care in all instances to have been appropriate.\nHe concluded by stating:\n\n       Finally, after reviewing all four cases, I am very\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n9. Dr. Stiber is a clinical Associate Professor at New York University\nMedical Center and former Chairperson, Section 1, District II, of the\nAmerican College of Obstetrics and Gynecology.\n\n10. At the time of Dr. Pamintuan's review action, Dr. Dyer had been a\npracticing OG/GYN for nearly 30 years and Chairperson of the OB/GYN\nCommittee at Milford Memorial Hospital for more than 25 years.\n\n                                10\n\f       concerned that the issues here are not quality\n       assurance, but the issues of denying a doctor the right\n       to practice medicine.\n\nApp. at B-433.\n\nTo further substantiate her claim of disparate treatment,\nDr. Pamintuan points to the following excerpt from the\nExecutive Committee's January 19, 1994, meeting minutes:\n\n       QUALITY ASSURANCE: A representative from the\n       Quality Assurance Committee reported a problem with\n       a provider that caused a focus review on the provider's\n       care. Some timely action must be taken to move\n       forward and protect patients. A memo is being drafted\n       to outline steps to prevent professional review action\n       and allow this person to practice in an unencumbered\n       fashion. This type of intervention has worked in the\n       past. By the next Executive Committee meeting,\n       hopefully a volunteer program will be developed. The\n       concerns are: (1) 30% complication rate, (2) 30-40%\n       mortality rate post-op, and (3) 20-25% curative\n       infection rate. The trend will be sent to the Department\n       of Surgery. A process group with all involved will be\n       scheduled with a consensus standard developed. The\n       suggestion of a \"Pre-Op Conference\" could be helpful.\n\nApp. at B-436. Dr. Pamintuan alleges that the\naforementioned physician is Caucasian. Nanticoke\nMemorial, however, contends that all but the last three\nsentences of the excerpt refer to Dr. Pamintuan, with the\nlast three referring to a study on thoracotomy. 11\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n11. To further buttress her allegations of intentional discrimination, Dr.\nPamintuan points to instances in the past involving alleged\ndiscrimination on the part of Nanticoke Memorial towards its employees\nand its patients. Her evidence ranges from the testimony of a hospital\nemployee concerning segregation of patients in the 1950s and 1960s to\nan alleged study, a copy of which was not produced, prepared in 1979\nreporting \"community concern that there were too many foreign\nphysicians in the Emergency Room.\" Dr. Pamintuan contends that in\nresponse to the aforementioned survey, Nanticoke Memorial\ndiscriminatorily removed all of the Filipino physicians from its emergency\nroom. Dr. Pamintuan also proffers the testimony of several former\n\n                               11\n\fD. Nanticoke Memorial's Rebuttal Evidence\n\nTo rebut Dr. Pamintuan's allegations that she was\nsingled out for discipline because of her race, Nanticoke\nMemorial offered evidence that between 1990 and 1996, six\nphysicians other than Dr. Pamintuan were the subject of\nquality review that resulted in some form of action\n(voluntary or otherwise). One of the disciplined physicians\nwas Filipino; the other five were Caucasian. Dr. Pamintuan\ncontends that none of these physicians or situations is\ncomparable to the case at bar.\n\nNanticoke Memorial also proffers its history of Filipino\nleadership in the medical staff. Between 1972 and 1994,\nthe period when Dr. Pamintuan had privileges at the\nhospital, six Filipinos and five Caucasians served as\npresident of the medical staff. Persons elected to be\npresident serve a two-year term as president-elect and a\ntwo-year term as president. The president-elect and\npresident also serve on the board of directors of Nanticoke\nMemorial.\n\nII.\n\nSection 1981 prohibits \"racial\" discrimination in the\nmaking of private and public contracts.

Under this standard, Dr. Pamintuan\nhad the burden of presenting a prima facie case of\ndiscrimination. To establish such a case under section\n1981, Dr. Pamintuan was required to produce some\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nemployees of the hospital indicating that they may have been the victims\nof discrimination. Nanticoke Memorial disputes this evidence. As the\nDistrict Court correctly noted, because of the temporal remoteness of the\nsegregation, the failure to produce the study, and the absence of any\nconnection between the individuals involved in the alleged discrimination\nand those involved in the review of Dr. Pamintuan's performance, most,\nif not all, of this evidence would not be admissible at trial.\n\n                               12\n\fevidence that would demonstrate that Nanticoke Memorial\nintentionally discriminated against her because she\nbelonged to an \"identifiable class[ ] of persons who are\nsubjected to intentional discrimination solely because of\ntheir ancestry or ethnic characteristics.\" See St. Francis\nCollege, 481 U.S. at 612, 107 S. Ct. at 2028.12\n\nOnce Dr. Pamintuan established her prima facie case, the\nburden shifted to Nanticoke Memorial to provide legitimate\nnon-discriminatory reasons for the suspension of Dr.\nPamintuan's privileges. If Nanticoke Memorial was able to\nprovide such justification, the burden reverted back to Dr.\nPamintuan to provide some evidence that these reasons\nwere pretextual. We have previously stated that, on this\npoint:\n\n       [T]o avoid summary judgment, the plaintiff 's evidence\n       rebutting the employer's proffered legitimate reasons\n       must allow a factfinder reasonably to infer that each of\n       the employer's proffered non-discriminatory reasons\n       was either a post hoc fabrication or otherwise did not\n       actually motivate the employment action (that is, the\n       proffered reason is a pretext).\n\nFuentes v.

We continued to note that the plaintiff\ncannot rely on a showing that \"the employer's decision was\nwrong or mistaken\" because the focus of the factual dispute\nis \"whether discriminatory animus motivated the employer,\nnot whether the employer is wise, shrewd, prudent, or\ncompetent.\" Id. at 765 (citations omitted). This means that\nthe plaintiff must\n\n       demonstrate such weaknesses, implausibilities,\n       inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the\n       employer's proffered legitimate reasons for its action\n       that a reasonable factfinder could rationallyfind them\n       \"unworthy of credence,\" and hence infer \"that the\n       employer did not act for [the asserted] non-\n       discriminatory reasons.\" While this standard places a\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n12. Because our analysis turns on other areas, we will assume, without\ndeciding, that Dr. Pamintuan presented a prima facie case of\ndiscrimination.\n\n                                13\n\f       difficult burden on the plaintiff, \"[i]t arises from an\n       inherent tension between the goal of all discrimination\n       law and our society's commitment to free\n       decisionmaking by the private sector in economic\n       affairs.\"\n\nId. (citations omitted). With this standard in mind, we turn\nto the specifics of this case.\n\nFirst, we must determine whether Nanticoke Memorial\nproffered legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for its\ndecision to suspend Dr. Pamintuan. The record shows that\nNanticoke Memorial engaged in a multi-level review of Dr.\nPamintuan's fitness before concluding that her privileges\nshould be suspended because of quality of care concerns.\nBy the end of the internal review process, approximately\ntwenty of her peers had reviewed Dr. Pamintuan's case and\nreached the conclusion that the suspension was justified by\nthe fact that her behavior presented serious quality of care\nconcerns for the patients of the hospital. Nanticoke\nMemorial pointed to these quality of care concerns, based\non Dr. Pamintuan's pattern of inadequate record-keeping,\ndelays in providing treatment, poor medical judgment, and\ndisregard of hospital policies, as the reasons supporting the\ndecision to suspend Dr. Pamintuan's privileges. In addition,\nNanticoke Memorial notes that it offered a plan whereby Dr.\nPamintuan could retain her privileges if she agreed to\nadditional training and supervising. It was only after Dr.\nPamintuan refused this compromise that Nanticoke\nMemorial took the final step of suspending her privileges.\n\nBecause Nanticoke Memorial has proffered these\nlegitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for its disciplinary\naction, the burden shifts back to Dr. Pamintuan under\nMcDonnell Douglas \"to demonstrate such weaknesses,\nimplausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or\ncontradictions\" in the hospital's proffered reasons that a\nreasonable fact-finder could conclude that the reasons were\npretextual and that the hospital had a discriminatory\nmotive. Id. Giving Dr. Pamintuan all reasonable inferences,\nshe cannot meet this burden.\n\nTo undermine Nanticoke Memorial's proffered reasons,\nDr. Pamintuan claims that Caucasian physicians had also\n\n                               14\n\fhad charting and timeliness problems, but had not been\ndisciplined as severely as her. We note, however, that Dr.\nPamintuan's suspension was not based solely on her\ndeficiencies concerning charting and timeliness, but was\ngrounded in large part on Nanticoke Memorial's concerns\nabout the quality of care she was providing to the hospital's\npatients.\n\nDr. Pamintuan asserts that her own statements that she\ndid not have significant clinical deficiencies were sufficient\nto create a question for the fact-finder. We have recognized\nthat a plaintiff's own affidavit providing circumstantial\nevidence of discrimination may in certain cases be\nsufficient by itself to withstand a defendant's motion for\nsummary judgment. See Weldon v. Kraft, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536996\"><a href=\"/opinion/536996/52-fair-emplpraccas-355-29-wage-hour-cas-bn-1158-52-empl-prac/\"><span class=\"volume\">896</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">793</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 800 (3d Cir. 1990); Jackson v.

However, this is not such\na case.\n\nThe testimony offered by the plaintiffs in Weldon and\nJackson is distinguishable from that offered by Dr.\nPamintuan. In both Weldon and Jackson, the plaintiffs\noffered testimony that, if believed, gave clear indication that\nthey were discriminated against and treated differently\nbecause of their race. Here, Dr. Pamintuan's testimony is\nessentially limited to the claim that her medical care was\nnot deficient. Notably, she does not claim that the\ncriticisms contained in the OB/GYN minutes were\nincorrect, nor does she claim that the internal review\nprocess produced findings that were untrue. Rather, her\ndeposition testimony merely asserts that the decision\nregarding her competence as a physician was wrong. As\nnoted, Dr. Pamintuan cannot survive summary judgment\nsimply by alleging that Nanticoke Memorial's decision was\n\"wrong or mistaken.\" Fuentes, 32 F.3d at 765. Therefore,\nthese two cases do not further our analysis beyond\nstanding for the fact that, in some cases, a plaintiff 's\ntestimony may be sufficient to proceed past summary\njudgment. However, were we to find that testimony such as\nPamintuan's was sufficient to survive summary judgment\non the issue of pretext, we would undermine the entire\nMcDonnell Douglas framework by drastically limiting the\npossibility that summary judgment could be granted\n\n                               15\n\fbecause virtually any contrary testimony by a plaintiff\nwould preclude a grant of summary judgment to the\ndefendants.\n\nDr. Pamintuan also alleges that she is entitled to an\ninference of pretext because the hospital did not conduct a\ncomparative review evaluating her performance in\ncomparison to that of other physicians at the hospital. This\nargument fails because she has not alleged or offered any\nevidence that any other physicians were granted a\ncomparative review when facing disciplinary proceedings.\nSo, rather than complaining that she was treated differently\nfrom others because of her race, she appears to be\ncomplaining that she was not treated differently. Indeed,\nDr. Pamintuan was accorded the same review process that\nall Nanticoke Memorial physicians received. The extensive\nmulti-tiered review process went on for several months. Dr.\nPamintuan was allowed to present evidence and make\narguments at all the appropriate procedural times. While\nDr. Pamintuan may claim that a comparative review would\nhave benefitted her cause, the lack of such a review does\nnothing to support her argument that she was\ndiscriminated against based on her race.\n\nDr. Pamintuan's evidence was, for the most part,\nanecdotal and inadmissable. Much of the evidence related\nto events that occurred several years before any action was\ntaken against her.13 In short, Dr. Pamintuan has pointed to\nno substantial evidence that contradicts or undermines\nNanticoke Hospital's legitimate reason for her suspension\n-- concern about the quality of care that she was providing.\n\nThus, Dr. Pamintuan has failed to submit evidence from\nwhich a reasonable factfinder could conclude that\nNanticoke Memorial's proffered legitimate, non-\ndiscriminatory reasons for her suspension were pretextual.\nDr. Pamintuan was accorded a lengthy and intense review\nprocess. Throughout the process, she was treated the same\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n13. The District Court correctly noted that much of the evidence relied\non by Dr. Pamintuan to show pretext would not be admissible at trial.\nTherefore, it is not proper to consider such evidence on summary\njudgment. See Pamintuan, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">743680</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *11 (citing Wetzel v.\nTucker, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">139</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">380</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 383 n.2 (2d Cir. 1998)).\n\n                               16\n\fas any other physician. Although she contends that the\nultimate decision reached by her peers was incorrect, more\nmust be shown to survive summary judgment. Therefore,\nwe affirm the District Court's grant of summary judgment\nto Nanticoke Memorial on her various claims of racial\ndiscrimination.14\n\nIII.\n\nDr. Pamintuan's final contention is that the District\nCourt erred when it held that Nanticoke Memorial was\nimmune from damages for the alleged violations of state law\nunder the Health Care Quality Improvement Act, 42 U.S.C.\nS 11101 et seq. (\"HCQIA\").15 Under the HCQIA, a health\ncare provider is immune from suit brought as the result of\na \"professional review action,\"16 see 42 U.S.C. S 11111(a), if\nthe review action was undertaken:\n\n         (1) in the reasonable belief that the action was in the\n         furtherance of quality health care,\n\n       (2) after a reasonable effort to obtain the facts of the\n       matter,\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n14. In light of our finding that Dr. Pamintuan failed to provide\nsufficient\nevidence that Nanticoke Memorial's proffered reasons were pretextual, we\nneed not address her argument that she was qualified as an employee\nfor Title VII purposes. The District Court ruled that she did not qualify\nas an employee, and so lacked standing to bring a Title VII suit.\nHowever, even if we were to favor Dr. Pamintuan's argument that she did\nin fact qualify as an employee under Title VII, her Title VII suit would\nalso fail because it is subject to the same shifting burdens test that her\nsection 1981 suit failed to fulfill.\n\n15. The HCQIA immunity provisions do not cover damages under section\n1981. See 42 U.S.C. S 11111(a)(1).\n\n16. A \"professional review action\" is defined as:\n\n         an action or recommendation of a professional review body which is\n         taken or made in the conduct of a professional review activity,\nwhich\n         is based on the competence or professional conduct of an individual\n         physician (which conduct affects or could affect adversely the\nhealth\n       or welfare of a patient or patients), and which affects (or may\naffect)\n       adversely the clinical privileges, or membership in a professional\n       society, of the physician.\n\f42 U.S.C. S 11151(9).\n\n                        17\n\f       (3) after adequate notice and hearing procedures are\n       afforded to the physician involved or after such other\n       procedure as are fair to the physician under the\n       circumstances, and\n\n       (4) in the reasonable belief that the action was\n       warranted by the facts known after such reasonable\n       effort to obtain facts and after meeting the requirement\n       of paragraph (3).\n\n       A professional review action shall be presumed to have\n       met the preceding standards necessary for [immunity]\n       unless the presumption is rebutted by a preponderance\n       of the evidence.\n\n42 U.S.C. S 11112(a) (emphasis added). Therefore, under\nthe HCQIA, Dr. Pamintuan had the burden of establishing\nthat the hospital did not meet the standard for immunity.\nSee Brader v. Allegheny Gen. Hosp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"761706\"><a href=\"/opinion/761706/alan-h-brader-v-allegheny-general-hospital/\"><span class=\"volume\">167</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">832</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 839 (3d\nCir. 1999). In other words, the HCQIA alters the summary\njudgment burden because Dr. Pamintuan, the non-mover\nfor summary judgment, had the burden of demonstrating\nthat a reasonable fact finder could find by a preponderance\nof the evidence that Nanticoke Memorial had not met the\nabove requirements and had acted unreasonably. The\nDistrict Court found that she failed to meet this burden. We\nagree.\n\nIn the District Court, Dr. Pamintuan argued that\nNanticoke Memorial's refusal to undertake a comparative\nanalysis by examining the records of other physicians, and\nits refusal to credit the testimony of her expert, Dr. Dyer,\nsufficiently rebutted the statutory presumption. Dr.\nPamintuan also argues that the District Court'sfinding that\nshe had stated a claim for racial discrimination should\nentitle her to survive summary judgment because a\ndecision based on race is per se unreasonable.\n\nWe judge Nanticoke Memorial's actions using an objective\ntest, thus the good or bad faith (or subjective motivations)\nof the reviewers is irrelevant. See id. at 840. The\n\"reasonable belief \" standard is satisfied \"if the reviewers,\nwith the information available to them at the time of the\nprofessional review action, would reasonably have\nconcluded that their actions would restrict incompetent\n\n                               18\n\fbehavior or would protect patients.\" Id. (citations and\ninternal quotation marks omitted). Thus, Dr. Pamintuan's\nargument that her allegations of discriminatory motivation\nare sufficient to rebut the presumption of immunity under\nthe HCQIA is incorrect. Instead, under the first prong, Dr.\nPamintuan must show that the totality of the information\navailable to the Nanticoke Memorial reviewers did not\nprovide a basis for a reasonable belief that their actions\nwould further quality health care. Dr. Pamintuan failed to\nmake such a showing. Because the inquiry was reasonable,\nand a reasonable factfinder could not find an absence of a\nreasonable basis for the actions of Nanticoke Memorial and\nthe Committee, the District Court correctly held that the\nHCQIA precluded the award of state law damages to Dr.\nPamituan.\n\nDr. Pamintuan's arguments actually address the second\nrequirement -- \"after a reasonable effort to obtain the facts\nof the matter.\" First, she claims that the review was\nunreasonable because Nanticoke Memorial refused to\nconsider the records of other OB/GYNs at the hospital. The\nNinth Circuit Court of Appeals has previously dealt with\nthis argument under the HCQIA. See Smith v. Ricks, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"676054\"><a href=\"/opinion/676054/john-phillip-smith-v-william-b-ricks-john-phillip-smith-jerome-berg/\"><span class=\"volume\">31</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1478</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 1994). The court stated:\n\n       [The doctor's] challenge to [the] investigation is that he\n       was not permitted to discover or introduce evidence\n       regarding the conduct of other doctors. [The doctor]\n       essentially claims he was not the worst doctor at[the\n       hospital]. However, nothing in the statute, legislative\n       history, or case law suggests the competency of other\n       doctors is relevant in evaluating whether [the hospital]\n       conducted a reasonable investigation into [a doctor's]\n       conduct.\n\nId. at 1486 (emphasis added). We agree with the Ninth\nCircuit Court of Appeals. The focus of our inquiry under the\nHCQIA is not whether Dr. Pamintuan was or was not a\nsubstandard doctor in comparison to the other OB/GYNs at\nNanticoke Memorial, but whether Nanticoke Memorial's\ndisciplinary actions were justified after a reasonable effort\nto obtain the facts of the matter. It was not necessary for\n\n                               19\n\fthe hospital to gather evidence of other doctors' records to\nfulfill the reasonable fact gathering requirement. 17\n\nLooking at the \"totality of the process leading up to\"\nNanticoke Memorial's professional review action, it is clear\nthat the hospital made a reasonable effort to obtain the\nfacts of the matter. Matthews v. Lancaster Gen. Hosp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"720639\"><a href=\"/opinion/720639/robert-s-mathews-md-at-no-95-1391-v-lancaster-general-hospital/\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">624</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 637 (3d Cir. 1996). The lengthy review process\ntook place in front of several evaluators over a period of\nseveral months. The inquiry culminated with approximately\ntwenty-five hours of hearings before Nanticoke Memorial's\nJudicial Review Committee. Dr. Pamintuan was allowed to\npresent all of her evidence and arguments before the\nJudicial Review Committee made its decision. Because the\ninquiry was reasonable, and a reasonable fact finder could\nnot objectively find that either Nanticoke Memorial's or the\nCommittee's actions were not motivated by a reasonable\nbelief that the actions would be in furtherance of quality\nhealth care, the District Court correctly held that the\nHCQIA precluded the award of state law damages to Dr.\nPamintuan.\n\nIV.\n\nBecause Dr. Pamintuan failed to provide sufficient\nevidence that Nanticoke Memorial's decision to suspend her\nprivileges was pretextual and because she failed to rebut\nthe presumption of immunity under the HCQIA, we affirm\nthe District Court's grant of summary judgment to\nNanticoke Memorial.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n17. Dr. Pamintuan's other challenge to Nanticoke Memorial's fact\ngathering process is that the hospital improvidently rejected the\ntestimony of her expert, Dr. Dyer. In her brief, Dr. Pamintuan claims\nthat the Dr. Dyer's testimony was precluded by some objection by\nHospital counsel. Appellant's Brief at 28. However, looking at the record,\nit appears that the Hospital Committee simply chose not to adopt her\nexpert's testimony and suggestions to use more cases for evaluation.\n\n\n                               20\n\fA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n\n                               21\n\f</pre>",
