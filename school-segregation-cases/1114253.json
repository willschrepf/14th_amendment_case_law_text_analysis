The appeal presents an issue of first impression\n\nin our circuit regarding whether a disparate impact theory of\n\nliability is available to plaintiffs suing for age discrimination\n\nunder the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967.               The\n\ndistrict court ruled that, as a matter of law, claims of disparate\n\n\n                                  1\n\fimpact cannot be brought under the Act.               We agree and therefore\n\naffirm the judgment of the district court as to this issue.\n\nHowever, because the district court granted summary judgment in\n\nfavor of the defendants on the plaintiffs’ disparate treatment\n\nclaim before addressing pending motions related to the plaintiffs’\n\nability to fully develop the summary judgment record, we vacate the\n\ndistrict     court’s   final    judgment    insofar    as   it    dismissed    the\n\nplaintiffs’ disparate treatment claim.\n\n                                       I.\n\n                               PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n     On May 14, 2001, thirty police officers and public safety\n\ndispatchers – all over the age of forty and all employed by the\n\ndefendants – filed suit pursuant to the Age Discrimination in\n\nEmployment Act (“ADEA”), 29 U.S.C. § 621 et seq. (2000).                      They\n\nclaimed injuries as a result of an allegedly age-discriminatory\n\nperformance pay plan (“the plan”) implemented by the defendants in\n\norder to grant substantially larger salary increases to police\n\nofficers and public safety dispatchers (collectively “officers”)\n\nunder the age of forty.        The plan was implemented by the defendants\n\non October 1, 1998, and revised by the defendants on March 1, 1999.\n\nUnder the plan, those officers and dispatchers with five or fewer\n\nyears   of   tenure    with    the   department   received       proportionately\n\ngreater raises when compared to their former pay than those with\n\nmore than five years of tenure.          As stated by the district court:\n\n     The plan accordingly created three categories for the\n     purposes of the analysis of this case: 1) those officers\n\n                                        2\n\f      and dispatchers with less than five years of tenure,\n      most, if not all, of whom would have been under 40 years\n      of age; 2) those 40 years of age or older, most, if not\n      all, of whom would have had more than five years of\n      tenure, and; 3) those under 40 years of age with more\n      than five years of tenure.\n\n      On December 11, 2001, the plaintiffs moved to compel certain\n\nfiscal and personnel discovery related to the implementation and\n\nrevision of the plan; the magistrate judge overseeing disputes\n\nrelated to discovery in this matter granted this motion on January\n\n16, 2002, concluding that “the fiscal and personnel discovery\n\nrequested by the Plaintiffs is not privileged . . . and should be\n\nproduced.”      On June 5, 2002, the plaintiffs filed a “motion for\n\nsanctions, a default judgment, attorneys’ fees and expenses, expert\n\nwitness fees and a continuance,” seeking to have the defendants\n\ncomply with disclosure and discovery obligations as set forth in\n\nthe   Federal    Rules   of   Civil   Procedure   and   the   order   of   the\n\nmagistrate judge. Two days later, the defendants moved for summary\n\njudgment, and the plaintiffs thereafter moved to strike certain\n\nexhibits to the defendants’ motion, in part because the existence\nof the documents attached as exhibits had been previously denied by\n\nthe defendants.\n\n      On September 6, 2002, while the plaintiffs’ motions were\n\npending, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of\n\nthe defendants on the plaintiffs’ disparate impact and disparate\n\ntreatment claims and denied the plaintiffs’ pending motions as\n\nmoot.   Final judgment was entered on this same date.\n\n      The plaintiffs appeal this final judgment, maintaining that:\n\n                                       3\n\f(1) the district court erred in concluding that a disparate impact\n\ntheory of liability is not cognizable under the ADEA, and (2) the\n\ndistrict court erred in improvidently dismissing the plaintiffs’\n\ndisparate treatment claim pending production by the defendants of\n\nrequested discovery materials.\n\n                                  II.\n\n                          STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n     We review the grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the\n\nsame standards as did the district court.           Daniels v. City of\n\nArlington, 246 F.3d 500, 502 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 951\n\n(2001).   Summary judgment should be granted if there is no genuine\n\nissue of material fact for trial and the moving party is entitled\n\nto judgment as a matter of law.            FED. R. CIV. P. 56(c).       In\n\ndetermining if there is a genuine issue of material fact, this\n\ncourt reviews the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-\n\nmoving party.    Daniels, 246 F.3d at 502.\n\n                                  III.\n\n                THE PLAINTIFFS’ DISPARATE IMPACT CLAIM\n\n     The plaintiffs raise both disparate treatment and disparate\n\nimpact theories of liability here.          Regarding their disparate\n\ntreatment claim, the plaintiffs allege that the defendants were\n\nmotivated by age to implement a plan that discriminated against\n\nthem intentionally.    Regarding their disparate impact theory, the\n\nplaintiffs allege that the implementation of the facially neutral\n\nplan by the defendants gives rise to liability without a showing of\n\nintentional   age   motivation   because   the   plan   resulted   in   pay\n\n                                   4\n\fincreases to officers under forty years of age that were four\n\nstandard deviations higher than the raises received by officers\n\nover forty.      In support of their disparate impact theory, the\n\nplaintiffs    proffered    to     the    district        court       statistical    data\n\ndemonstrating that the average pay increases made pursuant to the\n\nplan differed by age and that older officers received smaller\n\nraises than their younger counterparts.\n\n     In a disparate treatment case, liability depends on whether\n\nthe protected trait – here, age – actually motivated the employer’s\n\ndecision.    Hazen Paper Co. v. Biggins, 507 U.S. 604, 610 (1993).\n\nThe employer may have relied on a facially discriminatory policy\n\nrequiring adverse treatment of older employees or may have been\n\nmotivated by age to discriminate against an individual on an ad hoc\n\nbasis   –   “[w]hatever    the    employer’s       decisionmaking          process,     a\n\ndisparate treatment claim cannot succeed unless the employee’s\n\nprotected trait actually played a role in that process and had a\n\ndeterminative    influence       on     the     outcome.”            Id.    Proof       of\n\ndiscriminatory    motive    is    thus        critical    to     the    success    of   a\n\nplaintiff’s discriminatory treatment claim.                    Id.     In contrast, in\n\na   disparate    impact    case,        liability        may     result    without      a\n\ndemonstration of discriminatory motive.                  Id. at 609.        Disparate\n\nimpact claims arise from “employment practices that are facially\n\nneutral in their treatment of different groups but that in fact\n\nfall more harshly on one group than another and cannot be justified\n\nby business necessity.”          Id. (quoting Int’l Bhd. of Teamsters v.\n\nUnited States, 431 U.S. 324, 335-36 n.15 (1977)).\n\n                                          5\n\f     In 1971, the Supreme Court held that plaintiffs may bring\n\ndisparate impact claims under Title VII. Griggs v. Duke Power Co.,\n\n401 U.S. 424, 430-31 (1971).    This judicial construction of the\n\nstatute was codified by Congress in 1991 to make clear that such a\n\ntheory was available to plaintiffs.   See Civil Rights Act of 1991,\n\nPub. L. No. 102-166, § 105(a), 105 Stat. 1071, 1074-75 (adding 42\n\nU.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)).1   The availability of a disparate impact\n\ntheory under the ADEA, however, is not so clear.    In Hazen Paper\n\nCo. v. Biggins, the Supreme Court expressly declined to weigh in on\n\nwhether the ADEA entitles a plaintiff to bring a disparate impact\n\ncause of action, stating that “we have never decided whether a\n\ndisparate impact theory of liability is available under the ADEA,\n\nand we need not do so here.”   507 U.S. at 610 (internal citation\n\nomitted).\n\n     This express reservation has led to a debate amongst the\n\ncourts of appeals regarding whether the ADEA, like Title VII,\n\nentitles a plaintiff to bring a disparate impact claim.      Those\n\n     1\n          We note that the same statute did not make a parallel\namendment to the ADEA, although it did amend the ADEA in other\nways. Some of our sister circuits have concluded that this\nomission (together with other factors) indicates a congressional\nintent that a disparate impact cause of action not be available\nunder the ADEA. See Mullin v. Raytheon Co., 164 F.3d 696, 703\n(1st Cir. 1999); Ellis v. United Airlines, Inc., 73 F.3d 999,\n1008 (10th Cir. 1996). Such congressional inaction is\nsusceptible of multiple interpretations, however, and so we\nshould hesitate before we draw inferences from it. See\nSchneidewind v. ANR Pipeline Co., 485 U.S. 293, 306 (1988). The\nCivil Rights Act of 1991 was mainly aimed at overriding certain\ninterpretations of Title VII, and so we do not find it especially\nprobative with respect to the question before us today.\nAccordingly, our interpretation of the ADEA, set forth later in\nthis opinion, rests on other grounds.\n\n                                6\n\fcourts of appeals extending the holding in Griggs to the ADEA do so\n\nbased on the textual similarities between the prohibitory sections\n\nof the ADEA and Title VII.     See Frank v. United Airlines, Inc., 216\n\nF.3d 845, 856 (9th Cir. 2000) (stating, post-Hazen, that “[w]e see\n\nno reason to depart from our conclusion . . . and we again hold\n\nthat a disparate impact claim is cognizable under the ADEA”);\n\nCriley v. Delta Air Lines Inc., 119 F.3d 102, 105 (2d Cir. 1997)\n\n(following, without discussion, pre-Hazen law in stating that “in\n\nour   circuit,   we   have   recognized   such   a[]   [disparate   impact]\n\naction”); Smith v. City of Des Moines, 99 F.3d 1466, 1470 (8th Cir.\n\n1996) (stating that “even if we believed that Hazen Paper cast\n\ndoubt on the validity of [pre-Hazen case law], Houghton [a post-\n\nHazen case] represents the law of this Circuit” and must therefore\n\nbe followed).     Those courts of appeals declining to hold that a\n\ndisparate impact theory is cognizable under the ADEA recognize the\n\nsignificant textual overlap in the prohibitory sections of the ADEA\n\nand Title VII, but they also look beyond this similarity, examining\n\nthe entire ADEA statute (and the purpose behind its enactment) and\n\nfinding important differences between the ADEA and Title VII that\n\ncounsel against extending the Griggs holding to the ADEA context.\n\nSee Adams v. Fla. Power Corp., 255 F.3d 1322, 1325-26 (11th Cir.)\n\n(holding that disparate impact claims may not be brought under the\n\nADEA, in part because “the history of the ADEA differs from the\n\nlegislative history of Title VII, which the Supreme Court in Griggs\n\nrelied on to find a cause of action for disparate impact”), cert.\n\ngranted, 534 U.S. 1054 (2001), cert. dismissed, 535 U.S. 228\n\n                                     7\n\f(2002); Mullin, 164 F.3d at 703 (“Congress never intended to make\n\na disparate impact cause of action available under the ADEA.”);\n\nMaier v. Lucent Tech., Inc., 120 F.3d 730, 735 (7th Cir. 1997)\n\n(“[S]uch a theory of liability [disparate impact] is not cognizable\n\nunder the ADEA.”); Ellis, 73 F.3d at 1001 (“[W]e hold that ADEA\n\nclaims     cannot      be   based     on   a   disparate    impact   theory   of\n\ndiscrimination.”).2\n\n     After surveying the well-traversed arguments on either side of\n\nthis debate, we hold that the ADEA was not intended to remedy age-\n\ndisparate effects that arise from the application of employment\n\nplans or practices that are not based on age.               Fundamental to our\n\ndecision    is   the    ADEA’s      express    exception   permitting   employer\n\nconduct based on “reasonable factors other than age” – an exception\n\nabsent from Title VII – and the inapplicability to the ADEA context\n\nof the policy justifications identified by the Supreme Court (in\n\nGriggs, 401 U.S. at 430-31) for recognizing a disparate impact\n\ncause of action in the Title VII context.\n\nA.   Similarities Between the ADEA and Title VII\n\n\n     2\n          After Hazen, the Third and the Sixth Circuits have both\nexpressed “considerable doubt” regarding whether a claim of age\ndiscrimination may be stated under a disparate impact theory.\nLyon v. Ohio Educ. Ass’n & Prof’l Staff Union, 53 F.3d 135, 139\nn.5 (6th Cir. 1995) (“The Court’s focus in Hazen Paper on\nCongress’s intent to prevent discrimination based on inaccurate\nand damaging stereotypes suggests that incidental discriminatory\neffects arising from facially age-neutral policies are not\nredressable.”); DiBiase v. SmithKline Beecham Corp., 48 F.3d 719,\n732 (3d Cir. 1995) (opinion of Greenberg, J.) (stating that “the\nanalysis in Hazen casts considerable doubt on the viability of\nthe theory”). However, in neither case was the issue directly\nbefore the court.\n\n                                           8\n\f       The construction of a statute begins with the text of the\n\nstatute itself.      The ADEA prohibits discrimination on the basis of\n\nage.       See 29 U.S.C. § 623 (2000).    It was enacted in 1967, before\n\nthe Supreme Court first interpreted Title VII to allow employees to\n\nprove discrimination by showing disparate impact.        See Griggs, 401\n\nU.S. at 431.       The plaintiffs correctly identify the core sections\n\nexpressly prohibiting discrimination “because of [an] individual’s\n\nage” in the ADEA – § 623(a)(1) and (a)(2) – as overlapping almost\n\nidentically       with   the   core   sections   expressly   prohibiting\n\ndiscrimination “because of [an] individual’s race, color, religion,\n\nsex, or national origin” in Title VII – 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1)\n\nand (2).3      This is no coincidence; “the prohibitions of the ADEA\n\n       3\n          Section 623’s prohibitory subsections provide, in\nrelevant part, that it is unlawful for an employer:\n\n            (1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any\n       individual or otherwise discriminate against any\n       individual with respect to his compensation, terms,\n       conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such\n       individual’s age;\n            (2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees\n       in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any\n       individual of employment opportunities or otherwise\n       adversely affect his status as an employee, because of\n       such individual’s age . . . .\n\n29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(1)-(2). The prohibitory subsections of Title\nVII provide, in relevant part, that it is unlawful for an\nemployer:\n\n            (1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any\n       individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any\n       individual with respect to his compensation, terms,\n       conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such\n       individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national\n       origin; or\n            (2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees\n       or applicants for employment in any way which would\n\n                                      9\n\fwere derived in haec verba from Title VII.”   Lorillard v. Pons, 434\n\nU.S. 575, 584 (1978).    The only differences in the prohibitory\n\nlanguage contained in these statutes are: (1) Title VII protects\n\nagainst discrimination on the basis of “race, color, religion, sex,\n\nor national origin,” while the ADEA protects against discrimination\n\non the basis of “age”; and (2) Title VII extends protection also to\n\n“applicants” for employment, while the ADEA does not.\n\n     Although the ADEA’s prohibitory provisions are at first blush\n\nread most naturally as outlawing only conduct motivated by age –\n\nthe statute refers to actions taken “because of” age – Griggs of\n\ncourse held that parallel language in Title VII prohibited actions\n\nthat had a race-disparate impact, irrespective of motive or intent.\n\nThe significant overlap between the prohibitory sections of the\n\nADEA and of Title VII persuaded the Second Circuit to hold early\n\non, with little discussion, that a disparate impact theory of\n\nliability is likewise available under the ADEA.       See Geller v.\n\nMarkham, 635 F.2d 1027, 1031-32 (2d Cir. 1980).4     The Eighth and\n\nNinth Circuits soon followed suit, again without any significant\n\n\n\n     deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment\n     opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as\n     an employee, because of such individual’s race, color,\n     religion, sex, or national origin.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1)-(2).\n     4\n          Then-Justice Rehnquist dissented from the denial of\ncertiorari in Geller. 451 U.S. 945 (1981). In so doing, he\nstated that “[i]n my opinion, the decision of the Court of\nAppeals is inconsistent with the express provisions of the ADEA\nand is not supported by any prior decision of this Court.” Id.\nat 947.\n\n                                 10\n\finquiry apart from drawing a parallel to Title VII.              See Leftwich\n\nv. Harris-Stowe State Coll., 702 F.2d 686, 690 (8th Cir. 1983);\n\nDouglas v. Anderson, 656 F.2d 528, 531 n.1 (9th Cir. 1981).5                   As\n\nnoted earlier, these circuits continue to follow that position.6\n\n     While the First, Seventh, Tenth, and Eleventh Circuits have\n\nlikewise approached the statutory construction of the ADEA by\n\nlooking at the text of the ADEA, they have (we think correctly)\n\ndeclined    to    limit   their    construction    calculus    solely   to    the\n\nprohibitory sections of the ADEA and Title VII.                Instead, as we\n\nexplore below, they look to the entire statute and legislative\n\nhistory of the ADEA to recognize important textual and policy-based\n\ndifferences between the ADEA and Title VII that demonstrate an\n\nintention    on    the    part    of   Congress   to   allow   for   claims    of\n\n\n     5\n          At around the same time, the EEOC issued new\ninterpretive guidelines for the conduct of ADEA cases. We note\nthat one portion of those guidelines seems to be based on the\nassumption that the Griggs framework applies to ADEA cases. See\n46 Fed. Reg. 47,724, 47,725 (1981) (Sept. 29, 1981) (amending 29\nC.F.R. § 1625.7(d)). Such guidelines are not entitled to Chevron\ndeference. Christensen v. Harris County, 529 U.S. 576, 587\n(2000); EEOC v. Arabian Am. Oil Co., 499 U.S. 244, 256-58 (1991).\nWe are of course still bound to treat them as having persuasive\nforce, to the extent that they are thoughtfully considered. See\nChristensen, 529 U.S. at 587. The guideline in question does not\npurport to affirmatively establish that a disparate impact theory\nis available. Instead, it simply assumes, on the basis of\nGriggs, that such a theory is available. See 46 Fed. Reg. at\n47,725. Given the absence of significant analysis, and in light\nof subsequent developments that have cast doubt on that\nassumption, we do not believe that this administrative guidance\nis convincing authority.\n     6\n          The Seventh Circuit, which had originally permitted\ndisparate impact suits under the ADEA, changed course after\nHazen. See EEOC v. Francis W. Parker Sch., 41 F.3d 1073 (7th\nCir. 1994).\n\n                                         11\n\fintentional age discrimination, but not for claims of disparate\n\nimpact discrimination.\n\nB.     Differences Between the ADEA and Title VII\n\n       (1)   Section 623(f)(1) of the ADEA\n\n       The   ADEA’s    prohibitions       against   age   discrimination      in\n\nemployment      are   qualified    by     several   exceptions    to   employer\n\nliability set forth in § 623(f).                 Pursuant to one of these\n\nexceptions, an employer can avoid liability under the ADEA if the\n\nadverse employment action is “based on reasonable factors other\n\nthan age.”      29 U.S.C. § 623(f)(1).7\n\n       Neither the “reasonable factors other than age” exception nor\n\na    parallel   provision   is    found    in   Title   VII.     Facially,   the\n\nexception appears to serve as a safe harbor for employers who can\n\ndemonstrate that they based their employment action on a reasonable\n\nnon-age factor, even if the decision leads to an age-disparate\n\nresult.      In a pre-Hazen dissenting opinion, Judge Easterbrook\n\nargues against recognizing a disparate impact theory of liability\n\nunder the ADEA based on this “reasonable factors other than age”\n\n\n       7\n             Section 623(f)(1) provides, in relevant part:\n\n       It shall not be unlawful for an employer,\n       employment agency, or labor organization –\n\n            (1) to take any action otherwise prohibited under\n       subsections (a), (b), (c), or (e) of this section where\n       age is a bona fide occupational qualification reasonably\n       necessary to the normal operation of the particular\n       business, or where the differentiation is based on\n       reasonable factors other than age . . . .\n\n29 U.S.C. § 623(f)(1).\n\n                                        12\n\fexception:\n\n     [Section (f)(1)], which says that “reasonable factors\n     other than age” may be the basis of decision – impl[ies]\n     strongly that the employer may use a ground of decision\n     that is not age, even if it varies with age. What else\n     could be the purpose of this language? Surely it does\n     not mean simply that “only age discrimination is age\n     discrimination.”   “The prohibition and the exception\n     appear identical.    The sentence is incomprehensible\n     unless the prohibition forbids disparate treatment and\n     the exception authorizes disparate impact.”\n\nMetz v. Transit Mix, Inc., 828 F.2d 1202, 1220 (7th Cir. 1987)\n\n(Easterbrook, J., dissenting) (quoting Douglas Laycock, Continuing\n\nViolations, Disparate Impact in Compensation, and Other Title VII\n\nIssues, 49 L. & CONTEMP. PROBS. 53, 55 (1986)).   Post-Hazen case law\n\nlikewise reads the inclusion of the “reasonable factors other than\n\nage” exception to imply a congressional intent to remedy only\n\nintentional discrimination because of age through the passage of\n\nthe ADEA.    For example, the First Circuit states:\n\n     A critical asymmetry in the texts of the ADEA and Title\n     VII counsels convincingly against recognizing a disparate\n     impact cause of action under the former statute . . . .\n     This [“reasonable factors other than age”] proviso\n     permits employers to utilize factors other than age as\n     grounds    for    employment-related    decisions    that\n     differentially impact members of the protected class\n     (individuals between the ages of 40 and 69). When this\n     exception is read with the ADEA’s general prohibition\n     against   age-based    discrimination,    the   resulting\n     construction   follows:   it   shall   be   unlawful   to\n     “discriminate against any individual . . . because of\n     such individual’s age,” except when “based on . . .\n     factors other than age.”       Thus, if the exception\n     contained in section 623(f)(1) is not understood to\n     preclude disparate impact liability, it becomes nothing\n     more than a bromide to the effect that “only age\n     discrimination is age discrimination.”\n\n\n                                 13\n\fMullin, 164 F.3d at 701-02.   We too find that the inclusion of the\n\n“reasonable factors other than age” exception to the ADEA creates\n\na critical “asymmetry” between the ADEA and Title VII.8          The\n\naddition of this broad exception to the ADEA, on its face, appears\n\nto preclude a disparate impact theory of liability under the ADEA;\n\nat a minimum, it amounts to a salient textual difference between\n\nthe substantive liability provisions of the ADEA and Title VII – a\n\ndifference not mentioned by any of the courts of appeals which have\n\nextended Griggs to the ADEA context.9\n\n     While we believe that the “reasonable factors other than age”\n\nprovision counsels against recognizing a disparate impact theory\n\n\n     8\n          In his dissent from the denial of certiorari in Geller,\nthen-Justice Rehnquist likewise focused on § 623(f)(1) to support\nhis view that Congress did not intend that a disparate impact\nclaim be cognizable under the ADEA:\n\n     In my view, Congress did not intend the ADEA to have the\n     restraining influence on local governments which will\n     result from the decision below. Congress revealed this\n     intention in 29 U.S.C. § 623(f)(1), which provides that\n     it shall not be unlawful for an employer to take any\n     action otherwise prohibited “where the differentiation is\n     based on reasonable factors other than age.”\n\nGeller, 451 U.S. at 948-49 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting from denial\nof cert.).\n     9\n          This difference between the statutes also means that\nthe rule of in pari materia, heavily relied upon by our colleague\nin dissent, is largely inapplicable to this case. For while we\nusually endeavor to give like language the same meaning, it is a\ncardinal rule of statutory interpretation that we are to consider\nthe whole act, reading each section in light of the others.\nE.g., United Sav. Ass’n of Tex. v. Timbers of Inwood Forest\nAssocs., 484 U.S. 365, 371 (1988) (“Statutory construction,\nhowever, is a holistic endeavor. A provision that may seem\nambiguous in isolation is often clarified by the remainder of the\nstatutory scheme . . . .”).\n\n                                14\n\funder the ADEA, we would not go so far as to say that it rules out\n\nany alternative reading.            As the dissent argues, the prohibitory\n\nsection and the “reasonable factors other than age” clause could\n\ntogether be read as announcing a general rule that disparate impact\n\nis actionable but then carving out a defense for adverse impacts\n\nthat can be justified as a business necessity.                     The dissent’s\n\nposition is, of course, essentially how the courts have treated\n\nclaims under Title VII.         We do not believe this course is open to\n\nus, however.       This circuit long ago held that § 623(f)(1)’s\n\n“reasonable factors other than age” provision does not create an\n\naffirmative defense to liability; rather, it allows the defendant\n\nto bring forward evidence to negate the plaintiff’s prima facie\n\ncase. See Marshall v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., 576 F.2d 588, 590-\n\n91 (5th Cir. 1978).        Furthermore, whether or not § 623(f)(1) is\n\ntechnically     treated   as    a    defense,    we   do   not   think    that   the\n\nreference to “reasonable factors other than age” can be taken to\n\nmean that all practices having a disparate impact are illegal\n\nunless   they    meet     the    stringent      requirements       of     “business\n\nnecessity.”     Indeed, the Supreme Court has suggested a different\n\nmeaning for the clause, stating that it “insure[s] that employers\n\n[are] permitted to use neutral criteria not directly dependent on\n\nage.”    EEOC v. Wyoming, 460 U.S. 226, 232-33 (1983) (emphasis\n\nadded); cf. Kimel v. Fla. Bd. of Regents, 528 U.S. 62, 88 (2000)\n\n(“The exception simply makes clear that ‘[t]he employer cannot rely\n\non age as a proxy for an employee’s remaining characteristics, such\n\nas   productivity,      but     must   instead     focus    on    those    factors\n\n                                         15\n\fdirectly.’” (quoting Hazen, 507 U.S. at 611)). Therefore, we would\n\nnot read the “reasonable factors other than age” clause as a\n\nlimited derogation from a general prohibition against disparate\n\nimpact. Instead, we believe that the soundest reading of the whole\n\ntext is that the ADEA does not prohibit employers from taking\n\nactions based on non-age factors, except when those non-age factors\n\nare so related to age that they are mere proxies.10                    This reading\n\nof   the   text   is   also    powerfully      supported    by   the    legislative\n\nhistory, to which we turn in Part III.B.2 of our opinion.\n\n      The conclusion that this “reasonable factors other than age”\n\nexception    textually        precludes    a    disparate    impact      theory   of\n\nliability under the ADEA is arguably strengthened by the Supreme\n\nCourt’s treatment of a similar exception to the Equal Pay Act.\n\nThe Equal Pay Act was originally enacted in 1963 (as an amendment\n\nto the Fair Labor Standards Act) to prohibit discrimination in\n\nwages based on gender.          Corning Glass Works v. Brennan, 417 U.S.\n\n188, 195 (1974).       Under subsection (d), entitled “Prohibition of\n\nsex discrimination,” in Title 29, section 206, the Equal Pay Act\n\ncontains an exception similar to the “reasonable factors other than\n\nage” exception found in the ADEA:\n\n           No employer having employees subject to any\n      provisions of this section shall discriminate, within any\n      establishment in which such employees are employed,\n\n\n      10\n          In order to resolve this case, we need not speculate on\nwhat such factors might be. The Supreme Court held in Hazen that\nadverse employment actions based on job tenure do not, without\nmore, amount to disparate treatment based on age. 507 U.S. at\n611-12.\n\n                                          16\n\f       between employees on the basis of sex . . . except where\n       such payment is made pursuant to (i) a seniority system;\n       (ii) a merit system; (iii) a system which measures\n       earnings by quantity or quality of production; or (iv) a\n       differential based on any other factor other than sex:\n       Provided, That an employer who is paying a wage rate\n       differential in violation of this subsection shall not,\n       in order to comply with the provisions of this\n       subsection, reduce the wage rate of any employee.\n\n29 U.S.C. § 206(d)(1) (emphasis added).          The Supreme Court has\n\ninterpreted this exception to preclude actions based on disparate\n\nimpact theories under the Equal Pay Act.        See County of Washington\nv. Gunther, 452 U.S. 161, 169-71 (1981); Los Angeles Dep’t of Water\n\n& Power v. Manhart, 435 U.S. 702, 710 (1978).           For example, in\n\nManhart, a class action was brought on behalf of female employees\n\nof the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power challenging the\n\nDepartment’s    requirement   that     female   employees   make   larger\n\ncontributions to its pension fund than male employees. 435 U.S. at\n\n704.    The requirement was based on a study of mortality tables\n\nwhich revealed that, on the average, the Department’s female\n\nemployees lived a few years longer than its male employees.        Id. at\n\n705.    In footnote 20, Justice Stevens, writing for the Court,\n\ninterpreted the “any factor other than sex” exception to the Equal\nPay Act:\n\n       A variation on the Department’s fairness theme is the\n       suggestion that a gender-neutral pension plan would\n       itself    violate    Title    VII   because   of    its\n       disproportionately heavy impact on male employees. Cf.\n       Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424. This suggestion\n       has no force in the sex discrimination context because\n       each retiree’s total pension benefits are ultimately\n       determined by his actual life span; any differential in\n       benefits paid to men and women in the aggregate is thus\n\n                                     17\n\f     “based on [a] factor other than sex,” and consequently\n     immune from challenge under the Equal Pay Act . . . .\n\nId. at 710 n.20 (alteration in original).\n\n     The Court’s willingness to find that the Equal Pay Act’s “any\n\nfactor    other    than   sex”   exception    precludes   disparate   impact\n\ntheories of liability under the Equal Pay Act is helpful to our\n\nstatutory construction of the ADEA.           Many provisions in the ADEA\n\nhave their roots in the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Equal Pay\n\nAct. See, e.g., Lorillard, 434 U.S. at 577-82 (discussing the Fair\n\nLabor Standards Act as the “model” for the enforcement and remedial\n\nprovisions    to    the   ADEA).     Although    legislative   history    on\n\n§ 623(f)(1) is slim, we find it likely that the ADEA’s “reasonable\n\nfactors other than age” exception was spawned from the Equal Pay\n\nAct’s “any factor other than sex” exception, especially given that\n\nno parallel exception is found in Title VII.11\n\n     We recognize that the exceptions found in the ADEA and the\n\nEqual Pay Act are not identical.             The most notable difference,\n\nemphasized by our colleague in dissent, is the inclusion of the\n\n\n     11\n           See Mack A. Player, Wards Cove Packing or Not Wards\nCove Packing? That Is Not the Question: Some Thoughts on Impact\nAnalysis Under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 31 U.\nRICH. L. REV. 819, 833-34 (1997) (“Note the similarity of the\nEqual Pay Act and ADEA ‘factor other than . . .’ defenses. Guess\nthe origins . . . . Until the mid-1970s the Secretary of Labor\nadministered and enforced the Equal Pay Act. The Secretary of\nLabor was charged by Congress . . . to prepare a report on age\ndiscrimination and recommend legislation to Congress. The\ninitial drafts of what eventually became the ADEA were thus\nprepared by the Secretary of Labor . . . . It would seem,\ntherefore, that the Secretary who was then enforcing the Equal\nPay Act, lifted language and concept from the Equal Pay Act and\nplaced it in the ADEA.”).\n\n                                      18\n\fword “reasonable” in the ADEA’s exception.            However, we, like the\n\nEleventh Circuit in Adams, decline to infer from the inclusion of\n\nthe word “reasonable” that Congress meant to create an implicit\n\nbackground rule that actions resulting in an age-disparate impact\n\nare as a general matter proscribed.          See 255 F.3d at 1325 n.6.        As\n\nwe explained above, we believe the better reading is not that the\n\nclause acts as a limited defense against disparate impact claims\n\nbut rather that the clause signals that impacts resulting from\n\nneutral criteria not directly dependent on age are not prohibited\n\nin   the   first   place.      At    the   very    least,   we   recognize   the\n\n“reasonable factors other than age” exception as a clear textual\n\ndifference between the ADEA and Title VII regarding employer\n\nliability    –     a   distinction   that,    if    nothing      else,   plainly\n\ncontradicts the argument that the cognizability of a disparate\n\nimpact claim under Title VII (as set forth in Griggs) controls the\n\ncognizability of a disparate impact claim under the ADEA.12\n\n      12\n          Before turning to the legislative history of the ADEA,\nwe note that we do not share the dissent’s view of the import of\nthe Older Workers Benefit Protection Act, Pub. L. No. 101-433,\n104 Stat. 978 (1990) (“OWBPA”). The OWBPA added a provision to\nthe ADEA requiring employers in certain circumstances to provide\nlaid off employees with data relating to the ages of employees\nwho are laid off versus those who retain their jobs. See 29\nU.S.C. § 626(f). According to the dissent, such statistics would\nhave little use if the ADEA did not allow a disparate impact\ncause of action. We would not draw that inference, however, for\nsuch statistical evidence is quite useful in disparate treatment\ncases. See Teamsters, 431 U.S. at 339; McDonnell Douglas Corp.\nv. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 805 (1973); Anderson v. Douglas & Lomason\nCo., 26 F.3d 1277, 1285 (5th Cir. 1994). Moreover, the\nlegislative history of the OWBPA shows that Congress believed\nthat such statistics would help to alert discharged employees to\nthe possibility that they might have suffered disparate treatment\nbased on age. See H.R. REP. NO. 101-664, at 22 (1990) (expressing\n\n                                      19\n\f        (2)   Legislative History and Policy Considerations\n\n        In addition to the § 623(f)(1) exception to the ADEA, strong\n\npolicy considerations, revealed in the legislative history of the\n\nADEA, underscore the differences between the ADEA and Title VII.\n\nBecause the broad remedial purpose behind Title VII was central to\n\nthe Court’s statutory construction of Title VII in Griggs, the\n\ndifference between the purposes behind the ADEA and Title VII is\n\ndirectly      relevant        to     whether     a   disparate   impact   theory     is\n\ncognizable under the ADEA.\n\n        Congress enacted the ADEA after receiving a 1965 report by the\n\nSecretary of Labor regarding the problems of older workers.                         See\n\nEEOC v. Wyoming, 460 U.S. at 230-31.                      For our purposes, it is\n\nsignificant that the Secretary’s report finds “no evidence of\n\nprejudice based on dislike or intolerance of the older worker” and\n\nconcludes      that     the        main   problem    older   workers   faced   in   the\n\nworkplace was arbitrary age discrimination — namely explicit age\n\nlimitations — based on misconceptions about the abilities of older\n\nworkers.      U.S. DEP’T      OF   LABOR, THE OLDER AMERICAN WORKER: AGE DISCRIMINATION\n\nIN   EMPLOYMENT 2, 6 (1965) (the “Report”), reprinted in EEOC, LEGISLATIVE\n\nHISTORY   OF THE   AGE DISCRIMINATION     IN   EMPLOYMENT ACT 16 (1981) (hereinafter\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY).      The Report further specifically finds that the\n\nconcept of age prejudice is unique and differs from the concept of\n\n\n\nthe concern that in large-scale layoffs, “an individual employee\nwould not reasonably be expected to know or suspect that age may\nhave played a role in the employer’s decision, or that the\nprogram may be designed to remove older workers from the labor\nforce”).\n\n                                                20\n\frace prejudice because the process of aging “is inescapable,\n\naffecting everyone who lives long enough,” regardless of distinct\n\nsocial and economic environments.      Id. at 6.     The Report likewise\n\ndistinguishes between “arbitrary discrimination” based on age and\n\nother institutional     arrangements   that   have   a   disproportionate\n\neffect on older workers, finding that different solutions were\n\nappropriate for these different problems.         Id. at 21-25; see also\n\nMullin, 164 F.3d at 703 (describing the Report as “recommend[ing]\n\nthat arbitrary discrimination be statutorily prohibited, but that\n\nsystemic disadvantages incidentally afflicting older workers be\n\naddressed    through     educational   programs      and   institutional\n\nrestructuring”).13     These findings were “confirmed throughout the\n\nextensive   factfinding   undertaken   by   the   Executive   Branch   and\n\nCongress” in conjunction with the enactment of the ADEA.

We disagree,\nhowever, with the dissent’s conclusion that Congress therefore\nmust have intended to create a cause of action for disparate\nimpact. The practices to which the Report was referring were age\nlimitations, a form of disparate treatment. See id. Age\nlimitations were, in fact, the dominant form of arbitrary\ndiscrimination addressed in the Report. Such restrictions are\n“arbitrary,” according to the Report, in that they are based on\nstereotype-driven assumptions about older workers rather than on\nolder workers’ actual abilities. Id. at 2, 8. When an\nemployer’s practices are motivated by neutral, non-age factors,\nhowever, “the problem of inaccurate and stigmatizing stereotypes\ndisappears.” Hazen, 507 U.S. at 611. The mischief identified in\nthe Report is therefore more accurately targeted by a disparate\ntreatment theory, not a disparate impact theory.\n\n                                  21\n\fproposed legislation entitled “Age Discrimination in Employment Act\n\nof 1967.”      Letter from W.

In this letter, the Secretary notes that the bill\n\n“provides for attention to be given to institutional arrangements\n\nwhich   work     to   the   disadvantage      of    older   workers,”    but   that\n\n“[r]easonable differentiations not based solely on age . . . would\n\nnot fall within the proscription” of the bill.

The Report, this proposed bill, and\n\nsubsequent factfinding by the Executive Branch and Congress led\n\nCongress    to    limit     the   purpose    of    the   ADEA   specifically    “to\n\nprohibit[ing] arbitrary age discrimination in employment.”                      29\n\nU.S.C. § 621(b).\n\n     In contrast to the refined purpose evidenced in the historical\n\nunderpinnings of the ADEA’s enactment, the Supreme Court’s opinion\n\nin Griggs discusses Title VII’s broad remedial purpose.                        The\n\ndefendant company in Griggs instituted a policy of permitting\n\nincumbent employees who lacked a high school education to qualify\n\nfor transfer from the labor and coal handling department to an\n\n“inside” department by passing two tests of general intelligence –\n\n“[n]either [of which] was directed or intended to measure the\n\nability to learn to perform a particular job or category of jobs.”\n\n401 U.S. at 427-28.         Prior to the effective date of Title VII, the\n\ndefendant had instituted a policy of “restricting Negroes” to the\n\n                                        22\n\flabor and coal handling department in 1965.           Id. at 427.\n\n     Chief   Justice   Burger,   writing      for   the   Court,   held   that\n\nCongress’s objective in enacting Title VII was to “achieve equality\n\nof employment opportunities and remove barriers that have operated\n\nin the past to favor an identifiable group of white employees over\n\nother employees.”      Id. at 429-30.    Based on this objective, the\n\nCourt held that “practices, procedures, or tests neutral on their\n\nface, and even neutral in terms of intent, cannot be maintained if\n\nthey operate to ‘freeze’ the status quo of prior discriminatory\n\nemployment practices.”     Id. at 430.\n\n     The cornerstone of Griggs’s holding that disparate impact is\n\ncognizable under Title VII is thus the link between the history of\n\neducational discrimination on the basis of race and the use of that\n\ndiscrimination to continue to disadvantage individuals on the basis\n\nof their race.   Id. at 432 (stating that “good intent or absence of\n\ndiscriminatory intent does not redeem employment procedures or\n\ntesting   mechanisms    that   operate   as    ‘built-in    headwinds’    for\n\nminority groups and are unrelated to measuring job capability”);\n\nsee also Gunther, 452 U.S. at 178 (describing the “broad approach”\n\nof Title VII as aimed at “overcoming and undoing the effect of\n\ndiscrimination”) (internal quotation marks omitted).                However,\n\nabsent from the scope of the ADEA are the historical and remedial\n\nconcerns that, in the Title VII context, led to the recognition of\n\ndisparate impact claims directed at overcoming the consequences of\n\npast societal discrimination.\n\n     As Justice Stevens explained in his concurring opinion in\n\n                                    23\n\fWashington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229 (1976), it is “inappropriate\n\nsimply to transplant . . . standards in their entirety into a\n\ndifferent statutory scheme having a different history.” Id. at 255\n\n(Stevens, J., concurring). We heed this advice today and therefore\n\nfollow the majority of circuit courts to have addressed this issue\n\nin holding that a disparate impact theory of liability is not\n\ncognizable under the ADEA.   We find insufficient textual support\n\nfor the recognition of a disparate impact theory of liability in\n\nthe ADEA.   Further, as we see it, the conclusion that the holding\n\nin Griggs should be extended to the ADEA context based on the\n\nsimilarities in the prohibitory sections of the ADEA and Title VII\n\nignores important considerations.    It ignores the existence of\n\n§ 623(f)(1) – an express exclusion of employer liability that is\n\npresent in the ADEA but not present in parallel form in Title VII\n\n– and it ignores the differing purposes behind the ADEA and Title\n\nVII.14\n\n     14\n          Although it was not essential to the Court’s holding in\nHazen Paper Co., there is language in the opinion that supports\nour conclusion that a disparate impact claim is not cognizable\nunder the ADEA. There, a discharged employee (who was 62)\nbrought suit against his employers after they discharged him only\na few weeks before his pension rights were to vest, contending\nthat the employers’ decision was motivated by his age. 507 U.S.\nat 606. The First Circuit affirmed the judgment for the\nplaintiff employee, entered by the district court consistent with\nthe jury verdict in favor of the employee. Id. at 607. In so\ndoing, the court of appeals gave “considerable emphasis” to the\nevidence of pension interference because, in the court of\nappeals’s view, the jury could reasonably have found that age was\ninextricably intertwined with the decision to fire the employee\nbefore his pension rights vested. Id. The Supreme Court vacated\nthis judgment. Id. at 617. Importantly, the employee did not\nbase his claim for relief on a disparate impact theory of\nliability. Id. at 610. Nonetheless, in holding that “an\n\n                                24\n\f                                     IV.\n\n                THE PLAINTIFFS’ DISPARATE TREATMENT CLAIM\n\n     In contrast to the plaintiffs’ disparate impact claim, the\n\nplaintiffs’ disparate treatment claim is cognizable under the ADEA.\n\nA.   McDonnell Douglas Framework\n\n     We    have    interpreted   the    now-familiar      McDonnell   Douglas\n\nframework to apply to disparate treatment claims brought under the\n\nADEA.    Tyler v. Union Oil Co. of Cal., 304 F.3d 379, 395 (5th Cir.\n\n2002).    To make out a prima facie case of discriminatory treatment\n\nbased on age, the plaintiffs are required to prove: (1) they are\n\nwithin    the   protected   class;     (2)   they   are   qualified   for   the\n\nposition; (3) they suffered an adverse employment decision; and\n\n(4) they were replaced by someone younger or treated less favorably\n\nthan similarly situated younger employees (i.e., suffered from\n\ndisparate treatment because of membership in the protected class).\n\nSandstad v. CB Richard Ellis, Inc., 309 F.3d 893, 897 (5th Cir.\n\n2002); see also Kelliher v. Veneman, 313 F.3d 1270, 1275 (11th Cir.\n\n2002).\n\n\nemployer does not violate the ADEA just by interfering with an\nolder employee’s pension benefits that would have vested by\nvirtue of the employee’s years of service,” id. at 613, the Court\nstated that “[d]isparate treatment . . . captures the essence of\nwhat Congress sought to prohibit in the ADEA.” Id. at 610.\nFurther, the Court specifically discussed the decided purpose of\nthe ADEA — i.e., to prevent “arbitrary” discrimination based on\ninaccurate stereotyping regarding older workers: “When the\nemployer’s decision is wholly motivated by factors other than\nage, the problem of inaccurate and stigmatizing stereotypes\ndisappears. This is true even if the motivating factor is\ncorrelated with age, as pension status typically is.” Id. at 611\n(emphasis omitted).\n\n                                       25\n\f     If the plaintiffs make out their prima facie case, then the\n\nburden of production shifts to the defendants to articulate a\n\nlegitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment\n\naction.   Tyler, 304 F.3d at 395.     If the defendants meet this\n\nburden of production, the inference of discrimination drops, and\n\nthe plaintiffs may then attempt to prove discrimination by offering\n\nevidence that the defendants’ stated reason is pretextual.     Id.\n\n(“In a disparate treatment case . . . a plaintiff must produce\n\nsufficient evidence to rebut a showing by the employer that there\n\nwas a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for [differentially\n\ntreating] a particular employee.”).\n\n     Here, the district court dismissed the plaintiffs’ disparate\n\ntreatment claim because the plaintiffs could not make out their\n\nprima facie case based on the evidence available to them at the\n\ntime their responsive briefing was filed. The district court cited\n\nthis evidence as consisting of: (1) evidence that the Personnel\n\nDirector for the City of Jackson, Dr. George Terry, represented\n\nthat the plan considered tenure only once; and (2) evidence that\n\ncertain officers were subjected to age-related comments by Dr.\n\nTerry, Officer Deric Hearn, and Deputy Chief Cleon Butler.     The\n\ndistrict court additionally held that the plaintiffs’ evidence, as\n\na matter of law, was insufficient to disprove the defendants’\n\nlegitimate nondiscriminatory reasons for their employment decision\n\n– to bring starting salaries for police officers up to the regional\n\naverage, to develop a more generous pay scale within the confines\n\nof the city budget, and to consider tenure in the pay scale.\n\n                                26\n\fB.   The Plaintiffs’ Pending Motions\n\n     When the district court dismissed the plaintiffs’ disparate\n\ntreatment claim, two motions were pending: (1) a “motion for\n\nsanctions, a default judgment, attorneys’ fees and expenses, expert\n\nwitness fees and a continuance,” filed by the plaintiffs on June 5,\n\n2002; and (2) a “motion to strike exhibits to defendants’ motion\n\nfor summary judgment,” filed by the plaintiffs on July 11, 2002.\n\n     The June 5, 2002, motion sought comparative wage data relating\n\nto the plan, as originally implemented in October 1998 and as\n\nrevised in March 1999.   It also sought to compel disclosure of any\n\nrelated fiscal and personnel discovery in accordance with the order\n\nof the magistrate judge granting the plaintiffs’ motion to compel.\n\nFinally, the motion sought a continuance of the discovery period in\n\norder to allow the defendants to produce discovery materials\n\npreviously requested and to allow the plaintiffs an opportunity to\n\nfurther develop their case based on this new evidence.\n\n     The July 11, 2002, motion sought to strike certain exhibits\n\nfrom the defendants’ motion for summary judgment, in part because\n\nas to certain of these data produced as exhibits, “[t]he counsel\n\nfor the Defendants [had] insisted that no such wage data existed,”\n\nand “these data’s purported existence and importance were never\n\nprovided to the Plaintiffs until it was utilized by an Expert for\n\nthe Defense.”\n\n     Curiously, the district court did not rule on these motions.\n\nInstead, in deciding to grant the defendants’ motion for summary\n\njudgment,   the   district   court   simply   considered   the   evidence\n\n                                     27\n\favailable   to   the   plaintiffs    at    the    time   of   their   responsive\n\nbriefing.     After    granting     summary      judgment     in   favor   of   the\n\ndefendants as to the plaintiffs’ disparate treatment claim, the\n\ncourt then disposed of the plaintiffs’ pending motions by stating\n\nthat “[b]ecause the Court finds that Plaintiffs cannot meet their\n\nburden of proof for claims of disparate treatment under the ADEA,\n\nthe other motions of Plaintiffs in opposition to the Motion of\n\nDefendant for Summary Judgment related to claims for disparate\n\ntreatment are moot.”\n\n     On appeal, the plaintiffs contend that the dismissal of their\n\ndisparate treatment claim was premature because they “were not\n\nallowed to enforce their requests for discovery or to complete\n\nscheduled depositions that had been recessed when the plaintiffs\n\nlearned that significant information had been willfully withheld\n\nfrom them.”\n\nC.   Analysis of the District Court’s Conclusions\n\n     The district court may have conflated the plaintiffs’ burdens\n\nof production and persuasion in concluding that the plaintiffs\n\nfailed to meet their burden of demonstrating a genuine fact issue\n\nregarding their disparate treatment claim.15             However, we need not\n\n     15\n          For example, although not ultimately relevant to our\ndetermination on appeal, the district court required that the\nplaintiffs prove, as part of their initial prima facie burden,\n“unlawful motive” to discriminate because of age instead of\nrequiring that the plaintiffs demonstrate replacement by someone\nyounger or differential treatment of younger, similarly situated\nofficers. See Sandstad, 309 F.3d at 897. The district court\nalso appears to have used pre-Reeves case law in discussing the\nplaintiffs’ ultimate burden of proving unlawful discrimination\nunder the ADEA. See, e.g., Ross v. Univ. of Tex. at San Antonio,\n\n                                      28\n\faddress   this   issue   because,    upon     review,    we   agree    with    the\n\nplaintiffs that summary judgment on the plaintiffs’ disparate\n\ntreatment claim was premature in light of the plaintiffs’ pending\n\nmotions   before   the    district      court,    particularly        given    the\n\nallegation included in these motions that the defendants have\n\nfailed to comply with the order of the magistrate judge.\n\n     The magistrate judge clearly ordered the defendants to turn\n\nover various discovery documents, including documents that were\n\nresponsive to the plaintiffs’ initial disclosure request.                     These\n\ndocuments apparently include the working papers used by city\n\nofficials in drafting the new and revised plans, as well as\n\nevidence regarding comparative wage data – including memoranda and\n\nother documentation related to the March 1, 1999, City of Jackson\n\nPay Plan Revision, signed by all pertinent department heads, the\n\nexistence of which was initially denied by the defendants.                      The\n\nplaintiffs   allege      that   this        evidence    provides      additional\n\ndocumentation verifying the extent of the disparity between wage\n\nincreases for officers under the age of forty and officers over the\n\nage of forty.      The plaintiffs also allege that this evidence\n\n\n\n139 F.3d 521, 525 (5th Cir. 1998). As the Supreme Court stated\nin Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 148\n(2000), “a plaintiff’s prima facie case, combined with sufficient\nevidence to find that the employer’s asserted justification is\nfalse, may permit the trier of fact to conclude that the employer\nunlawfully discriminated.” Further, the district court here\napparently declined, without discussion, to consider any of the\nplaintiffs’ evidence that the plan resulted in a disparity of\nfour standard deviations between workers over forty and workers\nunder forty. Such statistical evidence can be relevant to a\nclaim of intentional discrimination. See supra note 12.\n\n                                       29\n\fprovides   them   with   documentation        regarding   the     defendants’\n\nknowledge that, at least at the time the defendants revised the\n\nplan, the plan would result in inferior pay status for older\n\nworkers when compared to younger workers. This evidence appears to\n\nus to be relevant to the plaintiffs’ prima facie case and to their\n\nultimate burden required to counter the defendants’ proffered\n\nreasons for implementing the pay plan.8              While much of this\n\nevidence   relates    primarily   to    the    plaintiffs’      now-dismissed\n\ndisparate impact claim, the impact evidence may also support a\n\npermissible inference of intentional discrimination and, as the\n\nplaintiffs argue, may relate to whether one of the defendants’\n\nproffered justifications – to bring salaries up to the regional\n\naverage – is false.\n\n     We do not decide whether the defendants have, in fact, failed\n\nto comply with the magistrate judge’s order, whether the motion to\n\ncontinue discovery should be granted, or whether the plaintiffs’\n\nother pending motions have merit.       Rather, we simply hold that the\n\ndistrict court should have addressed these motions before it ruled,\n\non an apparently incomplete summary judgment record, that the\n\nplaintiffs had not met their burden of demonstrating the existence\n\nof genuine fact issues regarding their disparate treatment claim.\n\nIf the defendants did not comply with their discovery obligations\n\n     8\n          Our ability to determine the degree to which this\nrequested evidence will ultimately benefit the plaintiffs is made\ndifficult by the absence in the record of the parties’ briefs in\nsupport of and against the defendants’ motion for summary\njudgment and the failure of the plaintiffs to request that these\nbriefs be supplemented to the record on appeal.\n\n                                   30\n\fsuch that the plaintiffs were prohibited from presenting their best\n\ncase to the district court, summary judgment in favor of the\n\ndefendants improperly denied the plaintiffs an opportunity to\n\ncontinue discovery and supplement the record. Sunbelt Sav., FSB v.\n\nMontross, 923 F.2d 353, 357, 358 (5th Cir. 1991) (holding that\n\nsummary judgment was premature when discovery was still pending).\n\n     The history of the discovery disputes plaguing this case and\n\nthe existence of pending motions alleging that the plaintiffs’\n\nability to present their best case was significantly hindered by\n\nthe defendants’ failure to comply with their discovery obligations\n\nconvinces us that the summary judgment dismissal of the plaintiffs’\n\ndisparate treatment claim was premature.   On remand, the district\n\ncourt may want to take into account, in ruling on the pending\n\nmotions, our decision on the viability of the disparate impact\n\nclaim.\n\n                                V.\n\n                            CONCLUSION\n\n     We AFFIRM in part, VACATE in part, and REMAND the case to the\n\ndistrict court.   Costs shall be borne by appellees.\n\n\n\n\n                                31\n\fCARL E. STEWART, Circuit Judge, concurring in part, dissenting in\n\npart:\n\n\n\n      While I agree with the majority’s disposition of plaintiff’s\n\ndisparate treatment claim in Part IV of the opinion, I also believe\n\nthat the district court erred in improvidently dismissing the\n\nplaintiff’s disparate impact claim and, therefore, I must dissent\n\nwith regard to Part III.\n\n      This marks the first time our court has had to squarely\n\ndecide, in the aftermath of Hazen Paper v. Biggins, 507 U.S. 604\n\n(1993), whether a disparate impact claim may be formulated under\n\nthe   ADEA.   I,   however,   am   not   thoroughly   convinced   by   the\n\nmajority’s attempt to distinguish between two statutes–the ADEA and\n\nTitle VII–whose text is virtually the same, that Congress meant to\n\nimply a disparate impact claim to the latter, but to preclude such\n\na claim in the former.        Equally, I am not persuaded by the\n\nmajority’s emphasis on the “reasonable factors other than age”\n\n(“RFOA”) exception.    When Congress enacted the ADEA in 1967, the\n\ncourts had yet to develop a disparate impact theory.       Thus, at the\n\ntime of enactment, it appears that Congress most likely intended\n\nthe RFOA to apply solely to claims of disparate treatment.         Based\n\nupon a close reading of the text, the relevant legislative history,\n\nsubsequent legislative actions, and concerns of public policy, I\n\nsubmit that a proper interpretation of the ADEA allows a disparate\n\nimpact cause of action.\n\n              I. STATUTORY INTERPRETATION OF THE ADEA\n\f       The majority’s analysis begins with the premise that the RFOA\n\nexception     of   the   ADEA   facially       appears     as   a   safe    harbor   to\n\nemployers.     To the majority, the language of the RFOA exception\n\nclearly rejects the theory of disparate impact.                          The majority\n\nrelies in part on a pre-Hazen dissent by Judge Easterbrook in Metz\n\nv.Transit Mix, Inc., for the proposition that the RFOA exception is\n\n“incomprehensible        unless     the    prohibition          forbids     disparate\n\ntreatment and the exception authorizes disparate impact.” 828 F.2d\n\n1202, 1220 (7th Cir. 1987) (emphasis added).\n\n       Contrary to the majority’s conclusion, it is not at all clear\n\nfrom    the   text   that   the     RFOA       exception    has     no     alternative\n\ninterpretation other than to preclude disparate impact.                      The RFOA\n\nexception aside, the language of the ADEA and Title VII are similar\n\nin every other respect.         Thus, I cannot conclude, in the absence of\n\nexpressed language to the contrary, that Congress meant to apply\n\nthe disparate impact theory to Title VII, but not to the analogous\n\nlanguage of the ADEA.             Until the United States Supreme Court\n\nexpressly rules on this issue, I continue to believe that the\n\nmajority viewpoint is in error.            Despite the obvious similarities\n\nbetween Title VII and the ADEA, today’s majority joins our fellow\n\n\n\n\n                                          33\n\fcourts    of   the   First,9   Third,10    Sixth,11    Seventh,12   Tenth,13   and\n\nEleventh14 Circuits in disclaiming a disparate impact theory under\n\nthe ADEA.\n\n     As shown through persuasive precedent from other circuits,\n\nhowever, there is another side to this debate.              For example, while\n\nacknowledging that post-Hazen the availability of disparate impact\n\nclaims under the ADEA is unsettled among the circuits, the Second\n\nCircuit held that it “generally assesses claims brought under the\n\nADEA identically to those brought pursuant to Title VII, including\n\ndisparate impact.”      Smith v. Xerox, 196 F.3d 358, 367 n.5 (2d Cir.\n\n1999).    The Second Circuit is not alone.             The Eighth Circuit has\n\nalso stated that it “continues to recognize the viability of . . .\n\n[ADEA disparate impact] claims.”               Lewis v. Aerospace Cmty. Credit\n\nUnion, 114 F.3d 745, 750 (8th Cir.1997); See also EEOC v. McDonnell\n\nDouglass Corp., 191 F.3d 948, 950 (8th Cir. 1999) (stating that\n\n“the law of this circuit is that disparate impact claims are\n\n     9\n       Mullin v.

Thus, precedent from other circuits\n\nshow    that   a   contrary   facial   interpretation     of   the   RFOA   is\n\nreasonable.\n\n       Moreover, the strongest argument against the language of the\n\nRFOA exception precluding disparate impact lies in the substantive\n\nprovisions of the ADEA and Title VII.             In a similar case, a\n\nconcurrence by Eleventh Circuit Judge Barkett acutely noted:\n\n       [I]n every statutory discrimination case, a decision\n\n       based   upon   legitimate   business   necessity    will   never\n\n       support a claim for liability.       Griggs itself recognized\n\n       and repeatedly emphasized that disparate impact is a\n\n       basis for relief only if the practice in question is not\n\n       founded on “business necessity,” or lacks “a manifest\n\n       relationship to the employment.”       [401 U.S. 424, 430-31\n\n       (1971)].    [The RFOA exception] of the ADEA adds nothing\n\n       new.\n\n\n\n       . . . In light of the parallels between the substantive\n\nprovisions of the ADEA and          Title VII, and in light of the\n\nfact that Congress has amended the ADEA several times             but has\n\nnever    explicitly     excluded    disparate    impact    claims,     a\n\nreasonable interpretation           of the [RFOA exception] is that\n\nit codifies the business necessity exception to            disparate\n\nimpact claims.\n\n\n\nAdams, 255 F.3d at 1327-28 (Barkett, J., concurring).\n\n                                       35\n\fI find Judge Barkett’s reasoning fully persuasive.                 Under a theory\n\nof   disparate   impact,    employers     will       still    be   able     to   have\n\nemployment practices and policies that may burden over-age workers\n\nin a disproportionate way.        These practices will be permissible,\n\ndespite the disproportionate impact,           provided the employer shows\n\nthey are supported by a business necessity.                Upon proving business\n\nnecessity, the burden shifts to the employee to show that the\n\npractice in question was established not because of the legitimacy\n\nof   the   necessity,     but   merely    as     a    pretext      for    invidious\n\nstereotyping.     Therefore, I am not persuaded that adopting a\n\ndisparate impact theory will lead to any inconsistencies with the\n\nRFOA exception.\n\n      That said, the cornerstone of the majority’s holding relies on\n\nan analogous provision in the Equal Pay Act (“EPA”).                     Because the\n\nRFOA exception does not exist under Title VII, the majority looks\n\ninstead to the EPA, which precludes disparate impact claims via its\n\n“any factor other than sex” language.                The majority attempts to\n\nshow that the similarities between the RFOA and EPA “any factor”\n\nexception should be construed by courts to demonstrate that the\n\nRFOA should similarly prohibit disparate impact. See Washington v.\n\nGunther, 452 U.S. 161, 170 (1981) (juxtaposing the EPA’s “any\n\nfactor other than sex” language with Title VII’s broadly inclusive\n\nprohibition against gender discrimination and stating that the\n\nlanguage    “confine[d]     the   application         of     the   Act     to    wage\n\ndifferentials attributable to sex discrimination.”).\n\n\n\n                                     36\n\f     The flaw in the majority’s logic is that the terms “any” and\n\n“reasonable” are not synonymous.            Under the ADEA, an employer with\n\na disparate impact policy may be liable for age discrimination if\n\nfactors relied on were not reasonable.                Pursuant to the EPA,\n\nhowever, if an employment policy causes wage differences among men\n\nand women workers, the employer will not be liable unless the\n\npolicy in question was based solely on gender.                 Thus, the ADEA and\n\nEPA exceptions cannot be read to have the same meaning unless the\n\nword “reasonable” is omitted from the RFOA exception.                       In this\n\nlight, the premise of the majority opinion appears little more than\n\nironic in that when it compares statutory language of the ADEA and\n\nTitle VII to preclude disparate impact, the court advocates a\n\ndissimilar    reading   of    almost   identical      statutes.           Yet,    when\n\ncomparing the ADEA to the EPA, with the intent of precluding\n\ndisparate    impact,    the   majority      applies   a       similar   reading     of\n\nexceptions    which    differ   significantly.            I    disagree    with    the\n\nmajority’s analytical approach and its reading of Gunther as\n\nindicating that the ADEA cannot bar some “reasonable factors other\n\nthan age” practices which have a disparate impact on workers over\n\nforty.\n\n     Additionally, the majority’s contention that the ADEA and\n\nTitle VII are not similar statutes, insofar as their application of\n\nthe disparate impact theory, disregards the doctrine of in pari\n\nmateria.     It has long been held that judicial interpretations of\n\none statute may be informed by interpretations of similar statutes.\n\nLorillard v. Pons, 434 U.S. 575, 580-81 (1978) (“[When] Congress\n\n                                       37\n\fadopts a new law incorporating sections of a prior law, Congress\n\nnormally      can     be      presumed      to    have      had     knowledge         of     the\n\ninterpretation given to the incorporated law, at least insofar as\n\nit   affects    the     new    statute.”).          Under       this    well      established\n\nstatutory      canon,       “the    interpretation         of     one    statute      may    be\n\ninfluenced by language of other statutes which are not specifically\n\nrelated,      but     which        apply    to    similar       persons,          things,    or\n\nrelationships.”             Nat.    Fed’n    of   Fed.     Employees         v.     Dep’t.   of\n\nInterior, 119 S. Ct. 1003, 1013 (1999) (defining the doctrine of in\n\npari materia, citing several cases where the Court applied this\n\ndoctrine to aid in its construction of a variety of statutes, and\n\narguing that the doctrine was now “well established”) on remand,\n\n174 F.3d 393 (4th Cir. 1999).\n\n       In the context of the ADEA and Title VII, adhering to this\n\ncanon    is    particularly         well    suited       because,       as    the    majority\n\nconcedes, the ADEA grew out of debates on Title VII.                           Furthermore,\n\nin pari materia has relevance because both aforementioned statutes\n\napply to      similar       persons    (here,      the    employees)           and    similar\n\nrelationships (here, the employment context).                          Moreover, Congress\n\ncarefully chose identical language for its statutes dealing with\n\nboth    discrimination         against      older    workers       and       discrimination\n\nagainst those due to race or gender.                        Therefore, the majority\n\nshould have applied the doctrine of in pari materia and interpreted\n\nthe disparate impact theory as applicable to the ADEA.\n\n                      II.     THE ADEA LEGISLATIVE HISTORY\n\n\n\n                                             38\n\f       My second point of disagreement with the majority concerns its\n\nportrayal of the legislative history of the ADEA.                   The majority\n\nopinion subtly recognizes that the legislative history of the ADEA\n\nis not directly on point. Although the majority’s opinion properly\n\nrecognizes    that   the    Supreme     Court’s    1971    endorsement   of   the\n\ndisparate impact theory in Griggs, 401 U.S. at 430-31, was later in\n\ntime than Congress’s enactment of the ADEA in 1967, the majority\n\nattempts to support its position by focusing on the underlying\n\npurposes of the legislation.\n\n       Although the language of Title VII and the ADEA are almost\n\nidentical, the majority essentially dismisses Griggs as irrelevant\n\nto the calculus of age discrimination.             The majority distinguishes\n\nGriggs from    the   ADEA    on   the    grounds    that   Griggs    interpreted\n\nCongress’s intent underlying Title VII as sweeping in nature.                 The\n\nmajority argues, “[i]n contrast to the refined purpose evidenced in\n\nthe historical underpinnings to the ADEA’s enactment, the Supreme\n\nCourt’s opinion in Griggs discusses Title VII’s broad remedial\n\npurpose.”     While it is undoubtably true that Griggs recognized\n\ndisparate impact theory as an available tool in the employment\n\ndiscrimination toolbox to remedy past discrimination under Title\n\nVII, it does not necessarily follow, as the majority asserts, that\n\nthe disparate impact tool is available only in a remedial context.\n\n\n\n       I disagree in two respects with the majority’s holding that\n\ndisparate impact theory should be limited to the context of Title\n\nVII.   First, the textual similarity between Title VII and the ADEA\n\n                                        39\n\fevinces   a   congressional   intent    to   provide   similar   protection\n\nagainst employment discrimination under the two statutes.           Second,\n\nit is arguable whether historical discrimination should be a\n\nnecessary precondition for recognizing a disparate impact theory.\n\nI acknowledge, as the majority does, that the ADEA and Title VII\n\nare distinct because the former lacks a history tied to past\n\ndiscrimination.     In the absence of a clear statement to the\n\ncontrary, however, I cannot assume that Congress intended to limit\n\nthe remedial measures available under anti-discrimination statutes\n\nwith almost identical language merely because the statutes arose\n\nout of distinct historical contexts.         The Supreme Court in Griggs,\n\nfor example, did not posit historical discrimination as the sole\n\nreason for disparate impact under Title VII; Griggs merely held\n\nthat a showing of disparate impact was available to remedy this\n\ntype of discrimination.       See Jennifer J. Clemons and Richard A.\n\nBales, ADEA Disparate Impact in the Sixth Circuit, 27 Ohio N.U. L.\n\nRev. 1, 23 (2000).       Moreover, the majority’s emphasis on the\n\nhistorical posture of the ADEA and Title VII unduly minimizes the\n\nstatutes shared aim of ridding from the workplace an environment of\n\nconcealed discrimination.      Griggs, 401 U.S. at 431 (stating that\n\nTitle VII “proscribes not only overt discrimination but also\n\npractices that are fair in form, but discriminatory in operation”);\n\nEEOC v. Wyoming, 460 U.S. 226, 231 (1983) (stating that the ADEA\n\nseeks to remedy “arbitrary” forms of age discrimination “based in\n\nlarge part on stereotypes unsupported by objective facts, and often\n\ndefended on grounds different from its actual causes”). Consistent\n\n                                   40\n\fwith such an aim, a disparate impact theory may be a plaintiff’s\n\nonly        tool     in        counteracting        sophisticated       discrimination.\n\nTherefore,         due    to    the   similarity      of   the   ADEA   and   Title   VII\n\nlanguage, it is my view that the protection available under both\n\nstatutes, including that from disparate impact, should also be\n\nsimilar.\n\n       The majority ignores the fact that Griggs does not stand alone\n\nas the only relevant decision applying disparate impact theory.\n\nUnder Supreme Court precedent, the disparate impact theory has\n\ngrown       beyond        its    original      purpose     of    alleviating     racial\n\ndiscrimination claims.                See Dothard v. Rawlinson, 433 U.S. 321,\n\n329-32 (1977) (applying disparate impact theory to Title VII sex\n\ndiscrimination claims).               Furthermore, under the 1991 Civil Rights\n\nAct, 42 U.S.C. § 2000-e2(k)(1)(A)(I) (1994), disparate impact\n\nclaims are readily available not only to plaintiffs alleging racial\n\ndiscrimination, but also to those claiming discrimination on the\n\nbasis of gender, national origin, and religion.15 In light of these\n\n       15\n       Title VII            of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as\namended by the              Civil Rights Act of 1991, provides in\npertinent part:\n\n               Sec. 703. (k)(1)(A) An unlawful employment\n               practice based on disparate        impact is\n               established under this subchapter only if–\n\n               (i) a complaining party demonstrates that a\n               respondent   uses  a   particular   employment\n               practice that causes a disparate impact on the\n               basis of race, color, religion, sex, or\n                    national origin and the respondent fails\n               to demonstrate that the challenged practice is\n               job related for the position in question and\n               consistent with business necessity;\n\n                                               41\n\fdevelopments, I cannot agree with the majority that the ADEA must\n\nbe limited solely to disparate treatment claims.\n\n      I also do not agree with the majority’s interpretation of the\n\nmost prominent documentation of all ADEA legislative history, the\n\nWirtz Report.16          The majority uses the Report to bolster its\n\nargument that      the   ADEA   was   not   premised    on    eradicating    past\n\ndiscrimination.        The flaw with the majority’s use of this most\n\ncritical     evidence    of   congressional   intent     is    its    failure   to\n\nacknowledge the argument, embodied within the Wirtz Report, that\n\nage discrimination was in fact “based in large part on stereotypes\n\nunsupported by objective fact, and was often defended on grounds\n\ndifferent from its actual cause.”             See EEOC , 460 U.S. at 231.\n\nThe aforementioned conclusion seems to indicate that the ADEA’s\n\npurpose may not have been limited to eradicating animus, as the\n\nmajority suggests. Rather, and in contrast to the majority’s view,\n\nthe Wirtz Report indicates that Congress merely intended to utilize\n\nthe   ADEA   to   eliminate     stereotypes   that     workers’      productivity\n\n\n\n             . . . .\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2 (2003).\n      16\n      The term “Wirtz Report” refers to a congressional report\ncommissioned by the former Department of Labor Secretary W.\nWillard Wirtz which, pursuant to section 715 of Title VII,\ninstructed the Secretary of Labor to conduct a study with\nrecommendations for “legislation to prevent arbitrary\ndiscrimination in employment because of age.” The origins of\nthe ADEA’s rationales and objectives can be traced to the\nresulting report entitled, The Older American      Worker:    Age\nDiscrimination in Employment (1965).       See also EEOC, 460\nU.S. at 229-31 (tracing legislative history of the ADEA and\ncentral role of the Secretary of Labor Report).\n\n                                       42\n\fdeclines with age.        That said, I acknowledge that the Wirtz Report\n\nis supportive evidence of Congress’s intent concerning the ADEA and\n\nthat the Report did in fact distinguish age discrimination as\n\n“rarely based on the sort of animus motivating some other forms of\n\ndiscrimination.”          My position merely suggests that because the\n\nWirtz Report sheds the best light on Congress’s intent in enacting\n\nthe ADEA, a point the majority does not refute, this Report\n\narguably provides more support for affirming, rather than denying,\n\nthat the ADEA contains a disparate impact cause of action.\n\n       Furthermore, the legislative intent indicating that Congress\n\nmeant to allow the disparate impact theory in ADEA actions may be\n\ndiscerned from a Congressional amendment.                 In 1994, Congress\n\namended the ADEA by adding the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act\n\n(“OWBPA”).       29 U.S.C. § § 623, 626, 630(f) (1994).          The statute\n\nrequires an employer to provide the employee with information\n\nregarding the ages of workers offered severance pay and those who\n\nwere    not    let   go    before   the    employee   waives   any   potential\n\ndiscrimination claims.          29 U.S.C. § 626(f)(1)(E)-(G), (H)(ii)\n\n(1994).       These statistics, comparing the ages of those terminated\n\nand those retained, would be of little relevance if the employee\n\ncould not bring a disparate impact claim.             Therefore, the addition\n\nof the OWBPA is additional evidence that the disparate impact\n\ntheory should be available under the ADEA.\n\n                                III. CONCLUSION\n\n       The majority today fails to heed the Griggs recognition that\n\nin a complex society, not all discrimination is apparent or overt.\n\n                                          43\n\fOften, such discrimination will be subtle and concealed.             The\n\npractical consequence of the majority’s decision is that it will\n\nallow an employer to exclude older workers from lower-level jobs\n\nsimply on the basis of pretext, without an additional tool at the\n\nemployee’s disposal to counteract such sophisticated discriminatory\n\nacts.    Contrary to the majority’s stance, I agree with the Supreme\n\nCourt’s determination in Hazen that the disparate impact liability\n\nwas     designed   to   detect   employment   decisions   that   reflect\n\n“inaccurate and stigmatizing stereotypes.” 507 U.S. at 610. Thus,\n\nI find no incompatibility with using disparate impact theory to\n\nprove liability under the ADEA.\n\n      Instead, I am concerned that by not allowing a disparate\n\nimpact cause of action under the ADEA, the majority has essentially\n\nheld such plaintiffs to the heightened evidentiary standard of\n\nWashington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229 (1976), where sophisticated and\n\nconcealed discrimination must be proved solely through intentional\n\nacts.    The majority, however, fails to fully absorb the spirit of\n\nJustice Stevens’s concurrence in Davis that “the line between\n\npurpose and discriminatory impact is not nearly as bright, and\n\nperhaps not quite as critical, as the reader of the court’s opinion\n\nmay assume.”       Id. at 254.      Applied to our context, Justice\n\nStevens’s concurrence demonstrates that the majority’s opinion,\n\nwhich distinguishes between intentional discrimination based on\n\ndisparate treatment on the one hand and a disparate impact cause of\n\naction absent proof of intent on the other, may not be as clear as\n\n\n\n                                    44\n\fthe majority seems to opine.   Therefore, with regards to Part III\n\nof the majority opinion, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                                45\n\f",

The appeal presents an issue of first impression in our circuit regarding whether a disparate impact theory of liability is available to plaintiffs suing for age discrimination under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967. The district court ruled that, as a matter of law, claims of disparate impact cannot be brought under the Act. We agree and therefore affirm the judgment of the district court as to this issue.

They claimed injuries as a result of an allegedly age-discriminatory performance pay plan (\"the plan\") implemented by the defendants in order to grant substantially larger salary increases to police officers and public safety dispatchers (collectively \"officers\") under the age of forty. The plan was implemented by the defendants on October 1, 1998, and revised by the defendants on March 1, 1999. Under the plan, those officers and dispatchers with five or fewer years of tenure with the department received proportionately greater raises when compared to their former pay than those with more than five years of tenure. As stated by the district court:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plan accordingly created three categories for the purposes of the analysis of this case: 1) those officers and dispatchers with less than five years of tenure, most, if not all, of whom would have been under 40 years of age; 2) those 40 years of age or older, most, if not all, of whom would have had more than five years of tenure, and; 3) those under 40 years of age with more than five years of tenure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 11, 2001, the plaintiffs moved to compel certain fiscal and personnel discovery related to the implementation and revision of the plan; the magistrate judge overseeing disputes related to discovery in this matter granted this motion on January 16, 2002, concluding that \"the fiscal and personnel discovery requested by the Plaintiffs is not privileged... and should be produced.\" On June 5, 2002, the plaintiffs filed a \"motion for sanctions, a default judgment, attorneys' fees and expenses, expert witness fees and a continuance,\" seeking to have the defendants comply with disclosure and discovery obligations as set forth in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the order of the magistrate judge.

Regarding their disparate treatment claim, the plaintiffs allege that the defendants were motivated by age to implement a plan that discriminated against them intentionally. Regarding their disparate impact theory, the plaintiffs allege that the implementation of the facially neutral plan by the defendants gives rise to liability without a showing of intentional age motivation because the plan resulted in pay increases to officers under forty years of age that were four standard deviations higher than the raises received by officers over forty. In support of their disparate impact theory, the plaintiffs proffered to the district court statistical data demonstrating that the average pay increases made pursuant to the plan differed by age and that older officers received smaller raises than their younger counterparts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a disparate treatment case, liability depends on whether the protected trait &#8212; here, age &#8212; actually motivated the employer's decision. <i>Hazen Paper Co. v. Biggins,</i> 507 U.S. 604, 610, 113 S.Ct. 1701, 123 L.Ed.2d 338 (1993). The employer may have relied on a facially discriminatory policy requiring adverse treatment of older employees or may have been motivated by age to discriminate against an individual on an ad hoc basis &#8212; \"[w]hatever the employer's decisionmaking process, a disparate treatment claim cannot succeed unless the employee's protected trait actually played a role in that process and had a determinative influence on the outcome.\" <i>Id.</i> Proof of discriminatory motive is thus critical to the success of a plaintiff's discriminatory treatment claim. <i>Id.</i> In contrast, in a disparate impact case, liability may result without a demonstration of discriminatory motive. <i>Id.</i> at 609, 113 S.Ct. 1701. Disparate impact claims arise from \"employment practices that are facially neutral in their treatment of different groups but that in fact fall more harshly on one group than another and cannot be justified by business necessity.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters v.

Duke Power Co.,</i> 401 U.S. 424, 430-31, 91 S.Ct. 849, 28 L.Ed.2d 158 (1971). This judicial construction of the statute was codified by Congress in 1991 to make clear that such a theory was available to plaintiffs. <i>See</i> Civil Rights Act of 1991, Pub.L.

In <i>Hazen</i> <i>Paper Co. v. Biggins,</i> the Supreme Court expressly declined to weigh in on whether the ADEA entitles a plaintiff to bring a disparate impact cause of action, stating that \"we have never decided whether a disparate impact theory of liability is available under the ADEA, and we need not do so here.\" 507 U.S. at 610, 113 S.Ct. 1701 (internal citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This express reservation has led to a debate amongst the courts of appeals regarding whether the ADEA, like Title VII, entitles a plaintiff to bring a disparate impact claim. Those courts of appeals extending the holding in <i>Griggs</i> to the ADEA do so based on the textual similarities between the prohibitory sections of the ADEA and Title VII. <i>See Frank v. United Airlines, Inc.,</i> 216 F.3d 845, 856 (9th Cir.2000) (stating, post-<i>Hazen,</i> that \"[w]e see no reason to depart from our conclusion ... and we again hold that a disparate impact claim is cognizable under the ADEA\"); <i>Criley v. Delta Air Lines Inc.,</i> 119 F.3d 102, 105 (2d Cir.1997) (following, without discussion, pre-<i>Hazen</i> law in stating that \"in our circuit, we have recognized such a[ ] [disparate impact] action\"); <i>Smith v. City of Des Moines,</i> 99 F.3d 1466, 1470 (8th Cir.1996) (stating that \"even if we believed that <i>Hazen Paper</i> cast doubt on the validity of [pre-<i>Hazen</i> case law], <i>Houghton</i> [a post-<i>Hazen</i> case] represents the law of this Circuit\" and must therefore be followed). Those courts of appeals declining to hold that a disparate impact theory is cognizable under the ADEA recognize the significant textual overlap in the prohibitory sections of the ADEA and Title VII, but they also look beyond this similarity, examining the entire ADEA statute (and the purpose behind its enactment) and finding important differences between the ADEA and Title VII that counsel against extending the <i>Griggs</i> holding to the ADEA context. <i>See Adams v. Fla. Power Corp.,</i> 255 F.3d 1322, 1325-26 (11th Cir.) (holding that disparate impact claims may not be brought under the ADEA, in part because \"the history of the ADEA differs from the legislative history of Title VII, which the Supreme Court in <i>Griggs</i> relied on to find a cause of action for disparate impact\"), <i>cert. granted,</i> 534 U.S. 1054, 122 S.Ct. 643, 151 L.Ed.2d 561 (2001), <i>cert. dismissed,</i> 535 U.S. 228, 122 S.Ct. 1290, 152 L.Ed.2d 345 (2002); <i>Mullin,</i> 164 F.3d at 703 (\"Congress never intended to make a disparate impact cause of action available under the ADEA.\"); <i>Maier v.

Fundamental to our decision is the ADEA's express exception permitting employer conduct based on \"reasonable factors other than age\" &#8212; an exception absent from Title VII &#8212; and the inapplicability to the ADEA context of the policy justifications identified by the Supreme Court (in <i>Griggs,</i> 401 U.S. at 430-31, 91 S.Ct. 849) for recognizing a disparate impact cause of action in the Title VII context.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>A.

The ADEA prohibits discrimination on the basis of age. <i>See</i> 29 U.S.C. &#167; 623 (2000). It was enacted in 1967, before the Supreme Court first interpreted Title VII to allow employees to prove discrimination by showing disparate impact. <i>See Griggs,</i> 401 U.S. at 431, 91 S.Ct. 849. The plaintiffs correctly identify the core sections expressly prohibiting discrimination \"because of [an] individual's age\" in the ADEA &#8212; &#167; 623(a)(1) and (a)(2) &#8212; as overlapping almost identically with the core sections expressly prohibiting discrimination \"because of [an] individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin\" in Title VII &#8212; 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-2(a)(1) and (2).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> This is no coincidence; \"the prohibitions of the ADEA were derived <i>in haec verba</i> from Title VII.\" <i>Lorillard v. Pons,</i> 434 U.S. 575, 584, 98 S.Ct. 866, 55 L.Ed.2d 40 (1978). The only differences in the prohibitory language contained in these statutes are: (1) Title VII protects against discrimination on the basis of \"race, color, religion, sex, or national origin,\" while the ADEA protects against discrimination on the basis of \"age\"; and (2) Title VII extends protection also to \"applicants\" for employment, while the ADEA does not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the ADEA's prohibitory provisions are at first blush read most naturally as outlawing only conduct motivated by age &#8212; the statute refers to actions taken \"because of\" age &#8212; <i>Griggs</i> of course held that parallel language in Title VII prohibited actions that had a race-disparate impact, irrespective of motive or intent. The significant overlap between the prohibitory sections of the ADEA and of Title VII persuaded the Second Circuit to hold early on, with little discussion, that a disparate impact theory of liability is likewise available under the ADEA. <i>See Geller v. Markham,</i> 635 F.2d 1027, 1031-32 (2d Cir. 1980).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The Eighth and Ninth Circuits soon followed suit, again without any significant inquiry apart from drawing a parallel to Title VII. <i>See Leftwich v. Harris-Stowe</i> <i>State Coll.,</i> 702 F.2d 686, 690 (8th Cir.1983); <i>Douglas v. Anderson,</i> 656 F.2d 528, 531 n. 1 (9th Cir.1981).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> As noted earlier, these circuits continue to follow that position.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the First, Seventh, Tenth, and Eleventh Circuits have likewise approached the statutory construction of the ADEA by looking at the text of the ADEA, they have (we think correctly) declined to limit their construction calculus solely to the prohibitory sections of the ADEA and Title VII. Instead, as we explore below, they look to the entire statute and legislative history of the ADEA to recognize important textual and policy-based differences between the ADEA and Title VII that demonstrate an intention on the part of Congress to allow for claims of intentional age discrimination, but not for claims of disparate impact discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>B.

Pursuant to one of these exceptions, an employer can avoid liability under the ADEA if the adverse employment action is \"based on reasonable factors other than age.\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 623(f)(1).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither the \"reasonable factors other than age\" exception nor a parallel provision is found in Title VII. Facially, the exception appears to serve as a safe harbor for employers who can demonstrate that they based their employment action on a reasonable non-age factor, even if the decision leads to an age-disparate result. In a pre-<i>Hazen</i> dissenting opinion, Judge Easterbrook argues against recognizing a disparate impact theory of liability under the ADEA based on this \"reasonable factors other than age\" exception:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Section (f)(1)], which says that \"reasonable factors other than age\" may be the basis of decision &#8212; impl[ies] strongly that the employer may use a ground of decision that is not age, even if it varies with age. What else could be the purpose of this language? Surely it does not mean simply that \"only age discrimination is age discrimination.\" \"The prohibition and the exception appear identical. The sentence is incomprehensible unless the prohibition forbids disparate treatment and the exception authorizes disparate impact.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Metz v. Transit Mix, Inc.,</i> 828 F.2d 1202, 1220 (7th Cir.1987) (Easterbrook, J., dissenting) (quoting Douglas Laycock, <i>Continuing Violations, Disparate Impact in Compensation, and Other Title VII Issues,</i> 49 L. &amp; CONTEMP. PROBS. 53, 55 (1986)). Post-<i>Hazen</i> case law likewise reads the inclusion of the \"reasonable factors other than age\" exception to imply a congressional intent to remedy only intentional discrimination because of age through the passage of the ADEA. For example, the First Circuit states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A critical asymmetry in the texts of the ADEA and Title VII counsels convincingly against recognizing a disparate impact cause of action under the former statute.... This [\"reasonable factors other than age\"] proviso permits employers to utilize factors other than age as grounds for employment-related decisions that differentially impact members of the protected class (individuals between the ages of 40 and 69). When this exception is read with the ADEA's general prohibition against age-based discrimination, the resulting construction follows: it shall be unlawful to \"discriminate against any individual ... because of such individual's age,\" except when \"based on ... factors other than age.\" Thus, if the exception contained in section 623(f)(1) is not understood to preclude disparate impact liability, it becomes nothing more than a bromide to the effect that \"only age discrimination is age discrimination.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mullin,</i> 164 F.3d at 701-02. We too find that the inclusion of the \"reasonable factors other than age\" exception to the ADEA creates a critical \"asymmetry\" between the ADEA and Title VII.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> The addition of this broad exception to the ADEA, on its face, appears to preclude a disparate impact theory of liability under the ADEA; at a minimum, it amounts to a salient textual difference between the substantive liability provisions of the ADEA and Title VII&#8212;a difference not mentioned by any of the courts of appeals which have extended <i>Griggs</i> to the ADEA context.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While we believe that the \"reasonable factors other than age\" provision counsels against recognizing a disparate impact theory under the ADEA, we would not go so far as to say that it rules out any alternative reading. As the dissent argues, the prohibitory section and the \"reasonable factors other than age\" clause could together be read as announcing a general rule that disparate impact is actionable but then carving out a defense for adverse impacts that can be justified as a business necessity. The dissent's position is, of course, essentially how the courts have treated claims under Title VII. We do not believe this course is open to us, however. This circuit long ago held that &#167; 623(f)(1)'s \"reasonable factors other than age\" provision does not create an affirmative defense to liability; rather, it allows the defendant to bring forward evidence to negate the plaintiff's prima facie case. <i>See Marshall v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp.,</i> 576 F.2d 588, 590-91 (5th Cir.1978). Furthermore, whether or not &#167; 623(f)(1) is technically treated as a defense, we do not think that the reference to \"reasonable factors other than age\" can be taken to mean that all practices having a disparate impact are illegal unless they meet the stringent requirements of \"business necessity.\" Indeed, the Supreme Court has suggested a different meaning for the clause, stating that it \"insure[s] that employers [are] permitted to use <i>neutral criteria not directly dependent on age.\" EEOC v. Wyoming,</i> 460 U.S. 226, 232-33, 103 S.Ct. 1054, 75 L.Ed.2d 18 (1983) (emphasis added); <i>cf. Kimel v. Fla. Bd. of Regents,</i> 528 U.S. 62, 88, 120 S.Ct. 631, 145 L.Ed.2d 522 (2000) (\"The exception simply makes clear that `[t]he employer cannot rely on age as a proxy for an employee's remaining characteristics, such as productivity, but must instead focus on those factors directly.'\" (quoting <i>Hazen,</i> 507 U.S. at 611, 113 S.Ct. 1701)). Therefore, we would not read the \"reasonable factors other than age\" clause as a limited derogation from a general prohibition against disparate impact. Instead, we believe that the soundest reading of the whole text is that the ADEA does not prohibit employers from taking actions based on non-age factors, except when those non-age factors are so related to age that they are mere proxies.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> This reading of the text is also powerfully supported by the legislative history, to which we turn in Part III.B.2 of our opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The conclusion that this \"reasonable factors other than age\" exception textually precludes a disparate impact theory of liability under the ADEA is arguably strengthened by the Supreme Court's treatment of a similar exception to the Equal Pay Act. The Equal Pay Act was originally enacted in 1963 (as an amendment to the Fair Labor Standards Act) to prohibit discrimination in wages based on gender. <i>Corning Glass Works v. Brennan,</i> 417 U.S. 188, 195, 94 S.Ct. 2223, 41 L.Ed.2d 1 (1974). Under subsection (d), entitled \"Prohibition of sex discrimination,\" in Title 29, section 206, the Equal Pay Act contains an exception similar to the \"reasonable factors other than age\" exception found in the ADEA:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No employer having employees subject to any provisions of this section shall discriminate, within any establishment in which such employees are employed, between employees on the basis of sex ... except where such payment is made pursuant to (i) a seniority system; (ii) a merit system; (iii) a system which measures earnings by quantity or quality of production; or (iv) <i>a differential based on any other factor other than</i> <i>sex: Provided,</i> That an employer who is paying a wage rate differential in violation of this subsection shall not, in order to comply with the provisions of this subsection, reduce the wage rate of any employee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">29 U.S.C. &#167; 206(d)(1) (emphasis added). The Supreme Court has interpreted this exception to preclude actions based on disparate impact theories under the Equal Pay Act. <i>See County of Washington v. Gunther,</i> 452 U.S. 161, 169-71, 101 S.Ct. 2242, 68 L.Ed.2d 751 (1981); <i>Los Angeles Dep't of Water &amp; Power v. Manhart,</i> 435 U.S. 702, 710, 98 S.Ct. 1370, 55 L.Ed.2d 657 (1978). For example, in <i>Manhart,</i> a class action was brought on behalf of female employees of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power challenging the Department's requirement that female employees make larger contributions to its pension fund than male employees. 435 U.S. at 704, 98 S.Ct. 1370. The requirement was based on a study of mortality tables which revealed that, on the average, the Department's female employees lived a few years longer than its male employees. <i>Id.</i> at 705, 98 S.Ct. 1370. In footnote 20, Justice Stevens, writing for the Court, interpreted the \"any factor other than sex\" exception to the Equal Pay Act:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A variation on the Department's fairness theme is the suggestion that a gender-neutral pension plan would itself violate Title VII because of its disproportionately heavy impact on male employees. <i>Cf. Griggs v. Duke Power Co.,</i> 401 U.S. 424, 91 S.Ct. 849, 28 L.Ed.2d 158. This suggestion has no force in the sex discrimination context because each retiree's total pension benefits are ultimately determined by his <i>actual life span;</i> any differential in benefits paid to men and women in the aggregate is thus \"based on [a] factor other than sex,\" and consequently immune from challenge under the Equal Pay Act....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 710 n. 20, 98 S.Ct. 1370 (alteration in original).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court's willingness to find that the Equal Pay Act's \"any factor other than sex\" exception precludes disparate impact theories of liability under the Equal Pay Act is helpful to our statutory construction of the ADEA. Many provisions in the ADEA have their roots in the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Equal Pay Act. <i>See, e.g., Lorillard,</i> 434 U.S. at 577-82, 98 S.Ct. 866 (discussing the Fair Labor Standards Act as the \"model\" for the enforcement and remedial provisions to the ADEA). Although legislative history on &#167; 623(f)(1) is slim, we find it likely that the ADEA's \"reasonable factors other than age\" exception was spawned from the Equal Pay Act's \"any factor other than sex\" exception, especially given that no parallel exception is found in Title VII.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize that the exceptions found in the ADEA and the Equal Pay Act are not identical. The most notable difference, emphasized by our colleague in dissent, is the inclusion of the word \"reasonable\" in the ADEA's exception. However, we, like the Eleventh Circuit in <i>Adams,</i> decline to infer from the inclusion of the word \"reasonable\" that Congress meant to create an implicit background rule that actions resulting in an age-disparate impact are as a general matter proscribed. <i>See</i> 255 F.3d at 1325 n. 6. As we explained above, we believe the better reading is not that the clause acts as a limited defense against disparate impact claims but rather that the clause signals that impacts resulting from neutral criteria not directly dependent on age are not prohibited in the first place. At the very least, we recognize the \"reasonable factors other than age\" exception as a clear textual difference between the ADEA and Title VII regarding employer liability &#8212; a distinction that, if nothing else, plainly contradicts the argument that the cognizability of a disparate impact claim under Title VII (as set forth in <i>Griggs</i>) controls the cognizability of a disparate impact claim under the ADEA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>(2) Legislative History and Policy Considerations</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the &#167; 623(f)(1) exception to the ADEA, strong policy considerations, revealed in the legislative history of the ADEA, underscore the differences between the ADEA and Title VII. Because the broad remedial purpose behind Title VII was central to the Court's statutory construction of Title VII in <i>Griggs,</i> the difference between the purposes behind the ADEA and Title VII is directly relevant to whether a disparate impact theory is cognizable under the ADEA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress enacted the ADEA after receiving a 1965 report by the Secretary of Labor regarding the problems of older workers. <i>See EEOC v.

For our purposes, it is significant that the Secretary's report finds \"no evidence of prejudice based on dislike or intolerance of the older worker\" and concludes that the main problem older workers faced in the workplace was arbitrary age discrimination &#8212; namely explicit age limitations &#8212; based on misconceptions about the abilities of older workers. U.S. DEP'T OF LABOR, THE OLDER AMERICAN WORKER: AGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT 2, 6 (1965) (the \"Report\"), <i>reprinted in</i> EEOC, LEGISLATIVE HISTORY OF THE AGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT ACT 16 (1981) (hereinafter LEGISLATIVE HISTORY). The Report further specifically finds that the concept of age prejudice is unique and differs from the concept of race prejudice because the process of aging \"is inescapable, affecting everyone who lives long enough,\" regardless of distinct social and economic environments. <i>Id.</i> at 6. The Report likewise distinguishes between \"arbitrary discrimination\" based on age and other institutional arrangements that have a disproportionate effect on older workers, finding that different solutions were appropriate for these different problems. <i>Id.</i> at 21-25; <i>see also Mullin,</i> 164 F.3d at 703 (describing the Report as \"recommend[ing] that arbitrary discrimination be statutorily prohibited, but that systemic disadvantages incidentally afflicting older workers be addressed through educational programs and institutional restructuring\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> These findings were \"confirmed throughout the extensive factfinding undertaken by the Executive Branch and Congress\" in conjunction with the enactment of the ADEA. <i>EEOC v.

Willard Wirtz to Hon. John W. McCormack and Hon. Hubert H. Humphrey, Jan. 23, 1967, <i>reprinted in</i> LEGISLATIVE HISTORY at 62-63. In this letter, the Secretary notes that the bill \"provides for attention to be given to institutional arrangements which work to the disadvantage of older workers,\" but that \"[r]easonable differentiations not based solely on age ... would not fall within the proscription\" of the bill. <i>Id.</i> Instead, the Secretary recommended that \"research ... be undertaken and promoted with a view to reducing barriers to the employment of older workers.\" <i>Id.</i> at 63. The Report, this proposed bill, and subsequent factfinding by the Executive Branch and Congress led Congress to limit the purpose of the ADEA specifically \"to prohibit[ing] arbitrary age discrimination in employment.\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 621(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast to the refined purpose evidenced in the historical underpinnings of the ADEA's enactment, the Supreme Court's opinion in <i>Griggs</i> discusses Title VII's broad <i>remedial</i> purpose. The defendant company in <i>Griggs</i> instituted a policy of permitting incumbent employees who lacked a high school education to qualify for transfer from the labor and coal handling department to an \"inside\" department by passing two tests of general intelligence &#8212; \"[n]either [of which] was directed or intended to measure the ability to learn to perform a particular job or category of jobs.\" 401 U.S. at 427-28, 91 S.Ct. 849. Prior to the effective date of Title VII, the defendant had instituted a policy of \"restricting Negroes\" to the labor and coal handling department in 1965. <i>Id.</i> at 427, 91 S.Ct. 849.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chief Justice Burger, writing for the Court, held that Congress's objective in enacting Title VII was to \"achieve equality of employment opportunities and remove barriers that have operated in the past to favor an identifiable group of white employees over other employees.\" <i>Id.</i> at 429-30, 91 S.Ct. 849. Based on this objective, the Court held that \"practices, procedures, or tests neutral on their face, and even neutral in terms of intent, cannot be maintained if they operate to `freeze' the status quo of prior discriminatory employment practices.\" <i>Id.</i> at 430, 91 S.Ct. 849.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The cornerstone of <i>Griggs</i>'s holding that disparate impact is cognizable under Title VII is thus the link between the history of educational discrimination on the basis of race and the use of that discrimination to continue to disadvantage individuals on the basis of their race. <i>Id.</i> at 432, 91 S.Ct. 849 (stating that \"good intent or absence of discriminatory intent does not redeem employment procedures or testing mechanisms that operate as `built-in headwinds' for minority groups and are unrelated to measuring job capability\"); <i>see also Gunther,</i> 452 U.S. at 178, 101 S.Ct. 2242 (describing the \"broad approach\" of Title VII as aimed at \"overcoming and undoing the effect of discrimination\") (internal quotation marks omitted). However, absent from the scope of the ADEA are the historical and remedial concerns that, in the Title VII context, led to the recognition of disparate impact claims directed at overcoming the consequences of past societal discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As Justice Stevens explained in his concurring opinion in <i>Washington v. Davis,</i> 426 U.S. 229, 96 S.Ct. 2040, 48 L.Ed.2d 597 (1976), it is \"inappropriate simply to transplant... standards in their entirety into a different statutory scheme having a different history.\" <i>Id.</i> at 255, 96 S.Ct. 2040 (Stevens, J., concurring). We heed this advice today and therefore follow the majority of circuit courts to have addressed this issue in holding that a disparate impact theory of liability is not cognizable under the ADEA. We find insufficient textual support for the recognition of a disparate impact theory of liability in the ADEA. Further, as we see it, the conclusion that the holding in <i>Griggs</i> should be extended to the ADEA context based on the similarities in the prohibitory sections of the ADEA and Title VII ignores important considerations. It ignores the existence of &#167; 623(f)(1) &#8212; an express exclusion of employer liability that is present in the ADEA but not present in parallel form in Title VII &#8212; and it ignores the differing purposes behind the ADEA and Title VII.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">IV.</p>\n    <p>THE PLAINTIFFS' DISPARATE TREATMENT CLAIM</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast to the plaintiffs' disparate impact claim, the plaintiffs' disparate treatment claim is cognizable under the ADEA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\"><i>A.</i> <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> <i>Framework</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have interpreted the now-familiar <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> framework to apply to disparate treatment claims brought under the ADEA. <i>Tyler v. Union Oil Co. of Cal.,</i> 304 F.3d 379, 395 (5th Cir.2002). To make out a prima facie case of discriminatory treatment based on age, the plaintiffs are required to prove: (1) they are within the protected class; (2) they are qualified for the position; (3) they suffered an adverse employment decision; and (4) they were replaced by someone younger or treated less favorably than similarly situated younger employees (i.e., suffered from disparate treatment because of membership in the protected class). <i>Sandstad v. CB Richard Ellis, Inc.,</i> 309 F.3d 893, 897 (5th Cir.2002); <i>see also Kelliher v. Veneman,</i> 313 F.3d 1270, 1275 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the plaintiffs make out their prima facie case, then the burden of production shifts to the defendants to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action. <i>Tyler,</i> 304 F.3d at 395. If the defendants meet this burden of production, the inference of discrimination drops, and the plaintiffs may then attempt to prove discrimination by offering evidence that the defendants' stated reason is pretextual. <i>Id.</i> (\"In a disparate treatment case ... a plaintiff must produce sufficient evidence to rebut a showing by the employer that there was a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for [differentially treating] a particular employee.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the district court dismissed the plaintiffs' disparate treatment claim because the plaintiffs could not make out their prima facie case based on the evidence available to them at the time their responsive briefing was filed. The district court cited this evidence as consisting of: (1) evidence that the Personnel Director for the City of Jackson, Dr. George Terry, represented that the plan considered tenure only once; and (2) evidence that certain officers were subjected to age-related comments by Dr. Terry, Officer Deric Hearn, and Deputy Chief Cleon Butler. The district court additionally held that the plaintiffs' evidence, as a matter of law, was insufficient to disprove the defendants' legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons for their employment decision &#8212; to bring starting salaries for police officers up to the regional average, to develop a more generous pay scale within the confines of the city budget, and to consider tenure in the pay scale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>B. The Plaintiffs' Pending Motions</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the district court dismissed the plaintiffs' disparate treatment claim, two motions were pending: (1) a \"motion for sanctions, a default judgment, attorneys' fees and expenses, expert witness fees and a continuance,\" filed by the plaintiffs on June 5, 2002; and (2) a \"motion to strike exhibits to defendants' motion for summary judgment,\" filed by the plaintiffs on July 11, 2002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The June 5, 2002, motion sought comparative wage data relating to the plan, as originally implemented in October 1998 and as revised in March 1999. It also sought to compel disclosure of any related fiscal and personnel discovery in accordance with the order of the magistrate judge granting the plaintiffs' motion to compel. Finally, the motion sought a continuance of the discovery period in order to allow the defendants to produce discovery materials previously requested and to allow the plaintiffs an opportunity to further develop their case based on this new evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The July 11, 2002, motion sought to strike certain exhibits from the defendants' motion for summary judgment, in part because as to certain of these data produced as exhibits, \"[t]he counsel for the Defendants [had] insisted that no such wage data existed,\" and \"these data's purported existence and importance were never provided to the Plaintiffs until it was utilized by an Expert for the Defense.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Curiously, the district court did not rule on these motions. Instead, in deciding to grant the defendants' motion for summary judgment, the district court simply considered the evidence available to the plaintiffs at the time of their responsive briefing. After granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants as to the plaintiffs' disparate treatment claim, the court then disposed of the plaintiffs' pending motions by stating that \"[b]ecause the Court finds that Plaintiffs cannot meet their burden of proof for claims of disparate treatment under the ADEA, the other motions of Plaintiffs in opposition to the Motion of Defendant for Summary Judgment related to claims for disparate treatment are moot.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the plaintiffs contend that the dismissal of their disparate treatment claim was premature because they \"were not allowed to enforce their requests for discovery or to complete scheduled depositions that had been recessed when the plaintiffs learned that significant information had been willfully withheld from them.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>C. Analysis of the District Court's Conclusions</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court may have conflated the plaintiffs' burdens of production and persuasion in concluding that the plaintiffs failed to meet their burden of demonstrating a genuine fact issue regarding their disparate treatment claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> However, we need not address this issue because, upon review, we agree with the plaintiffs that summary judgment on the plaintiffs' disparate treatment claim was premature in light of the plaintiffs' pending motions before the district court, particularly given the allegation included in these motions that the defendants have failed to comply with the order of the magistrate judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge clearly ordered the defendants to turn over various discovery documents, including documents that were responsive to the plaintiffs' initial disclosure request. These documents apparently include the working papers used by city officials in drafting the new and revised plans, as well as evidence regarding comparative wage data &#8212; including memoranda and other documentation related to the March 1, 1999, City of Jackson Pay Plan Revision, signed by all pertinent department heads, the existence of which was initially denied by the defendants. The plaintiffs allege that this evidence provides additional documentation verifying the extent of the disparity between wage increases for officers under the age of forty and officers over the age of forty. The plaintiffs also allege that this evidence provides them with documentation regarding the defendants' knowledge that, at least at the time the defendants revised the plan, the plan would result in inferior pay status for older workers when compared to younger workers. This evidence appears to us to be relevant to the plaintiffs' prima facie case and to their ultimate burden required to counter the defendants' proffered reasons for implementing the pay plan.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> While much of this evidence relates primarily to the plaintiffs' now-dismissed disparate impact claim, the impact evidence may also support a permissible inference of intentional discrimination and, as the plaintiffs argue, may relate to whether one of the defendants' proffered justifications &#8212; to bring salaries up to the regional average &#8212; is false.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not decide whether the defendants have, in fact, failed to comply with the magistrate judge's order, whether the motion to continue discovery should be granted, or whether the plaintiffs' other pending motions have merit. Rather, we simply hold that the district court should have addressed these motions before it ruled, on an apparently incomplete summary judgment record, that the plaintiffs had not met their burden of demonstrating the existence of genuine fact issues regarding their disparate treatment claim. If the defendants did not comply with their discovery obligations such that the plaintiffs were prohibited from presenting their best case to the district court, summary judgment in favor of the defendants improperly denied the plaintiffs an opportunity to continue discovery and supplement the record. <i>Sunbelt Sav., FSB v. Montross,</i> 923 F.2d 353, 357, 358 (5th Cir.1991) (holding that summary judgment was premature when discovery was still pending).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The history of the discovery disputes plaguing this case and the existence of pending motions alleging that the plaintiffs' ability to present their best case was significantly hindered by the defendants' failure to comply with their discovery obligations convinces us that the summary judgment dismissal of the plaintiffs' disparate treatment claim was premature. On remand, the district court may want to take into account, in ruling on the pending motions, our decision on the viability of the disparate impact claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We AFFIRM in part, VACATE in part, and REMAND the case to the district court.

Some of our sister circuits have concluded that this omission (together with other factors) indicates a congressional intent that a disparate impact cause of action not be available under the ADEA<i>See Mullin v. Raytheon Co.,</i> 164 F.3d 696, 703 (1st Cir.1999); <i>Ellis v. United Airlines, Inc.,</i> 73 F.3d 999, 1008 (10th Cir. 1996). Such congressional inaction is susceptible of multiple interpretations, however, and so we should hesitate before we draw inferences from it. <i>See Schneidewind v. ANR Pipeline Co.,</i> 485 U.S. 293, 306, 108 S.Ct. 1145, 99 L.Ed.2d 316 (1988). The Civil Rights Act of 1991 was mainly aimed at overriding certain interpretations of Title VII, and so we do not find it especially probative with respect to the question before us today. Accordingly, our interpretation of the ADEA, set forth later in this opinion, rests on other grounds.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> After<i>Hazen,</i> the Third and the Sixth Circuits have both expressed \"considerable doubt\" regarding whether a claim of age discrimination may be stated under a disparate impact theory. <i>Lyon v.

The guideline in question does not purport to affirmatively establish that a disparate impact theory is available.

Given the absence of significant analysis, and in light of subsequent developments that have cast doubt on that assumption, we do not believe that this administrative guidance is convincing authority.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The Seventh Circuit, which had originally permitted disparate impact suits under the ADEA, changed course after<i>Hazen.

The OWBPA added a provision to the ADEA requiring employers in certain circumstances to provide laid off employees with data relating to the ages of employees who are laid off versus those who retain their jobs<i>See</i> 29 U.S.C. &#167; 626(f). According to the dissent, such statistics would have little use if the ADEA did not allow a disparate impact cause of action. We would not draw that inference, however, for such statistical evidence is quite useful in disparate treatment cases. <i>See Teamsters,</i> 431 U.S. at 339, 97 S.Ct. 1843; <i>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,</i> 411 U.S. 792, 805, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973); <i>Anderson v. Douglas &amp; Lomason Co.,</i> 26 F.3d 1277, 1285 (5th Cir.1994). Moreover, the legislative history of the OWBPA shows that Congress believed that such statistics would help to alert discharged employees to the possibility that they might have suffered disparate <i>treatment</i> based on age. <i>See</i> H.R. REP. No. 101-664, at 22 (1990) (expressing the concern that in large-scale layoffs, \"an individual employee would not reasonably be expected to know or suspect that age may have played a role in the employer's decision, or that the program may be designed to remove older workers from the labor force\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> We recognize that the Report found that discriminatory practices were often \"defended on grounds apparently different from their actual explanation.\" Report at 7. We disagree, however, with the dissent's conclusion that Congress therefore must have intended to create a cause of action for disparate impact. The practices to which the Report was referring were age limitations, a form of disparate treatment<i>See id.</i> Age limitations were, in fact, the dominant form of arbitrary discrimination addressed in the Report. Such restrictions are \"arbitrary,\" according to the Report, in that they are based on stereotype-driven assumptions about older workers rather than on older workers' actual abilities. <i>Id.</i> at 2, 8. When an employer's practices are motivated by neutral, non-age factors, however, \"the problem of inaccurate and stigmatizing stereotypes disappears.\" <i>Hazen,</i> 507 U.S. at 611, 113 S.Ct. 1701. The mischief identified in the Report is therefore more accurately targeted by a disparate treatment theory, not a disparate impact theory.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p> Although it was not essential to the Court's holding in<i>Hazen Paper Co.,</i> there is language in the opinion that supports our conclusion that a disparate impact claim is not cognizable under the ADEA. There, a discharged employee (who was 62) brought suit against his employers after they discharged him only a few weeks before his pension rights were to vest, contending that the employers' decision was motivated by his age. 507 U.S. at 606, 113 S.Ct. 1701. The First Circuit affirmed the judgment for the plaintiff employee, entered by the district court consistent with the jury verdict in favor of the employee. <i>Id.</i> at 607, 113 S.Ct. 1701. In so doing, the court of appeals gave \"considerable emphasis\" to the evidence of pension interference because, in the court of appeals's view, the jury could reasonably have found that age was inextricably intertwined with the decision to fire the employee before his pension rights vested. <i>Id.</i> The Supreme Court vacated this judgment. <i>Id.</i> at 617, 113 S.Ct. 1701. Importantly, the employee did not base his claim for relief on a disparate impact theory of liability. <i>Id.</i> at 610, 113 S.Ct. 1701. Nonetheless, in holding that \"an employer does not violate the ADEA just by interfering with an older employee's pension benefits that would have vested by virtue of the employee's years of service,\" <i>id.</i> at 613, 113 S.Ct. 1701, the Court stated that \"[d]isparate treatment ... captures the essence of what Congress sought to prohibit in the ADEA.\" <i>Id.</i> at 610, 113 S.Ct. 1701. Further, the Court specifically discussed the decided purpose of the ADEA &#8212; i.e., to prevent \"arbitrary\" discrimination based on inaccurate stereotyping regarding older workers: \"When the employer's decision is wholly motivated by factors other than age, the problem of inaccurate and stigmatizing stereotypes disappears. This is true even if the motivating factor is correlated with age, as pension status typically is.\" <i>Id.</i> at 611, 113 S.Ct. 1701 (emphasis omitted).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p> For example, although not ultimately relevant to our determination on appeal, the district court required that the plaintiffs prove, as part of their initial prima facie burden, \"unlawful motive\" to discriminate because of age instead of requiring that the plaintiffs demonstrate replacement by someone younger or differential treatment of younger, similarly situated officers<i>See Sandstad,</i> 309 F.3d at 897. The district court also appears to have used pre-<i>Reeves</i> case law in discussing the plaintiffs' ultimate burden of proving unlawful discrimination under the ADEA. <i>See, e.g., Ross v. Univ. of Tex. at San Antonio,</i> 139 F.3d 521, 525 (5th Cir.1998). As the Supreme Court stated in <i>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc.,</i> 530 U.S. 133, 148, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000), \"a plaintiff's prima facie case, combined with sufficient evidence to find that the employer's asserted justification is false, may permit the trier of fact to conclude that the employer unlawfully discriminated.\" Further, the district court here apparently declined, without discussion, to consider any of the plaintiffs' evidence that the plan resulted in a disparity of four standard deviations between workers over forty and workers under forty. Such statistical evidence can be relevant to a claim of intentional discrimination. <i>See supra</i> note 12.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn16\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16_ref\">16</a>\n        <p> Our ability to determine the degree to which this requested evidence will ultimately benefit the plaintiffs is made difficult by the absence in the record of the parties' briefs in support of and against the defendants' motion for summary judgment and the failure of the plaintiffs to request that these briefs be supplemented to the record on appeal</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CARL E.

Biggins,</i> 507 U.S. 604, 113 S.Ct. 1701, 123 L.Ed.2d 338 (1993), whether a disparate impact claim may be formulated under the ADEA. I, however, am not thoroughly convinced by the majority's attempt to distinguish between two statutes &#8212; the ADEA and Title VII &#8212; whose text is virtually the same, that Congress meant to imply a disparate impact claim to the latter, but to preclude such a claim in the former. Equally, I am not persuaded by the majority's emphasis on the \"reasonable factors other than age\" (\"RFOA\") exception. When Congress enacted the ADEA in 1967, the courts had yet to develop a disparate impact theory. Thus, at the time of enactment, it appears that Congress most likely intended the RFOA to apply solely to claims of disparate treatment. Based upon a close reading of the text, the relevant legislative history, subsequent legislative actions, and concerns of public policy, I submit that a proper interpretation of the ADEA allows a disparate impact cause of action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>STATUTORY INTERPRETATION OF THE ADEA</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority's analysis begins with the premise that the RFOA exception of the ADEA facially appears as a safe harbor to employers. To the majority, the language of the RFOA exception clearly rejects the theory of disparate impact. The majority relies in part on a pre-<i>Hazen</i> dissent by Judge Easterbrook in <i>Metz v. Transit Mix, Inc.,</i> for the proposition that the RFOA exception is \"<i>incomprehensible</i> unless the prohibition forbids disparate treatment and the exception authorizes disparate impact.\" 828 F.2d 1202, 1220 (7th Cir.1987) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contrary to the majority's conclusion, it is not at all clear from the text that the RFOA exception <i>has no alternative interpretation</i> other than to preclude disparate impact. The RFOA exception aside, the language of the ADEA and Title VII are similar in every other respect. Thus, I cannot conclude, in the absence of expressed language to the contrary, that Congress meant to apply the disparate impact theory to Title VII, but not to the analogous language of the ADEA. Until the United States Supreme Court expressly rules on this issue, I continue to believe that the majority viewpoint is in error. Despite the obvious similarities between Title VII and the ADEA, today's majority joins our fellow courts of the First,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1\" id=\"fn1-1_ref\">1</a> Third,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1\" id=\"fn2-1_ref\">2</a> Sixth,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-1\" id=\"fn3-1_ref\">3</a> Seventh,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-1\" id=\"fn4-1_ref\">4</a> Tenth,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5-1\" id=\"fn5-1_ref\">5</a> and Eleventh<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6-1\" id=\"fn6-1_ref\">6</a> Circuits in disclaiming a disparate impact theory under the ADEA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As shown through persuasive precedent from other circuits, however, there is another side to this debate. For example, while acknowledging that post-<i>Hazen</i> the availability of disparate impact claims under the ADEA is unsettled among the circuits, the Second Circuit held that it \"generally assesses claims brought under the ADEA identically to those brought pursuant to Title VII, including disparate impact.\" <i>Smith v. Xerox,</i> 196 F.3d 358, 367 n. 5 (2d Cir.1999). The Second Circuit is not alone. The Eighth Circuit has also stated that it \"continues to recognize the viability of ... [ADEA disparate impact] claims.\" <i>Lewis v. Aerospace Cmty. Credit Union,</i> 114 F.3d 745, 750 (8th Cir.1997); <i>See also EEOC v. McDonnell Douglas Corp.,</i> 191 F.3d 948, 950 (8th Cir.1999) (stating that \"the law of this circuit is that disparate impact claims are cognizable under the ADEA\"). Thus, precedent from other circuits show that a contrary facial interpretation of the RFOA is reasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the strongest argument against the language of the RFOA exception precluding disparate impact lies in the substantive provisions of the ADEA and Title VII. In a similar case, a concurrence by Eleventh Circuit Judge Barkett acutely noted:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[I]n every statutory discrimination case, a decision based upon legitimate business necessity will never support a claim for liability. <i>Griggs</i> itself recognized and repeatedly emphasized that disparate impact is a basis for relief only if the practice in question is not founded on \"business necessity,\" or lacks \"a manifest relationship to the employment.\" [401 U.S. 424, 430-31, 91 S.Ct. 849, 28 L.Ed.2d 158 (1971)]. [The RFOA exception] of the ADEA adds nothing new.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">... In light of the parallels between the substantive provisions of the ADEA and Title VII, and in light of the fact that Congress has amended the ADEA several times but has never explicitly excluded disparate impact claims, a reasonable interpretation of the [RFOA exception] is that it codifies the business necessity exception to disparate impact claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Adams,</i> 255 F.3d at 1327-28 (Barkett, J., concurring).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I find Judge Barkett's reasoning fully persuasive. Under a theory of disparate impact, employers will still be able to have employment practices and policies that may burden over-age workers in a disproportionate way. These practices will be permissible, despite the disproportionate impact, provided the employer shows they are supported by a business necessity. Upon proving business necessity, the burden shifts to the employee to show that the practice in question was established not because of the legitimacy of the necessity, but merely as a pretext for invidious stereotyping. Therefore, I am not persuaded that adopting a disparate impact theory will lead to any inconsistencies with the RFOA exception.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That said, the cornerstone of the majority's holding relies on an analogous provision in the Equal Pay Act (\"EPA\"). Because the RFOA exception does not exist under Title VII, the majority looks instead to the EPA, which precludes disparate impact claims via its \"any factor other than sex\" language. The majority attempts to show that the similarities between the RFOA and EPA \"any factor\" exception should be construed by courts to demonstrate that the RFOA should similarly prohibit disparate impact. <i>See Washington v. Gunther,</i> 452 U.S. 161, 170, 101 S.Ct. 2242, 68 L.Ed.2d 751 (1981) (juxtaposing the EPA's \"any factor other than sex\" language with Title VII's broadly inclusive prohibition against gender discrimination and stating that the language \"confine[d] the application of the Act to wage differentials attributable to sex discrimination.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The flaw in the majority's logic is that the terms \"any\" and \"reasonable\" are not synonymous. Under the ADEA, an employer with a disparate impact policy may be liable for age discrimination if factors relied on were not reasonable. Pursuant to the EPA, however, if an employment policy causes wage differences among men and women workers, the employer will not be liable unless the policy in question was based solely on gender. Thus, the ADEA and EPA exceptions cannot be read to have the same meaning unless the word \"reasonable\" is omitted from the RFOA exception. In this light, the premise of the majority opinion appears little more than ironic in that when it compares statutory language of the ADEA and Title VII to preclude disparate impact, the court advocates a dissimilar reading of almost identical statutes. Yet, when comparing the ADEA to the EPA, with the intent of precluding disparate impact, the majority applies a similar reading of exceptions which differ significantly. I disagree with the majority's analytical approach and its reading of <i>Gunther</i> as indicating that the ADEA cannot bar some \"reasonable factors other than age\" practices which have a disparate impact on workers over forty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, the majority's contention that the ADEA and Title VII are not similar statutes, insofar as their application of the disparate impact theory, disregards the doctrine of <i>in pari materia.</i> It has long been held that judicial interpretations of one statute may be informed by interpretations of similar statutes. <i>Lorillard v. Pons,</i> 434 U.S. 575, 580-81, 98 S.Ct. 866, 55 L.Ed.2d 40 (1978) (\"[When] Congress adopts a new law incorporating sections of a prior law, Congress normally can be presumed to have had knowledge of the interpretation given to the incorporated law, at least insofar as it affects the new statute.\"). Under this well established statutory canon, \"the interpretation of one statute may be influenced by language of other statutes which are not specifically related, but which apply to similar persons, things, or relationships.\" <i>Nat. Fed'n of Fed. Employees v. Dep't. of Interior,</i> 526 U.S. 86, 119 S.Ct. 1003, 1013, 143 L.Ed.2d 171 (1999) (defining the doctrine of <i>in pari materia,</i> citing several cases where the Court applied this doctrine to aid in its construction of a variety of statutes, and arguing that the doctrine was now \"well established\") <i>on remand,</i> 174 F.3d 393 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the context of the ADEA and Title VII, adhering to this canon is particularly well suited because, as the majority concedes, the ADEA grew out of debates on Title VII. Furthermore, <i>in pari materia</i> has relevance because both aforementioned statutes apply to similar persons (here, the employees) and similar relationships (here, the employment context). Moreover, Congress carefully chose identical language for its statutes dealing with both discrimination against older workers and discrimination against those due to race or gender. Therefore, the majority should have applied the doctrine of <i>in pari materia</i> and interpreted the disparate impact theory as applicable to the ADEA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>THE ADEA LEGISLATIVE HISTORY</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">My second point of disagreement with the majority concerns its portrayal of the legislative history of the ADEA. The majority opinion subtly recognizes that the legislative history of the ADEA is not directly on point. Although the majority's opinion properly recognizes that the Supreme Court's 1971 endorsement of the disparate impact theory in <i>Griggs,</i> 401 U.S. at 430-31, 91 S.Ct. 849, was later in time than Congress's enactment of the ADEA in 1967, the majority attempts to support its position by focusing on the underlying purposes of the legislation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the language of Title VII and the ADEA are almost identical, the majority essentially dismisses <i>Griggs</i> as irrelevant to the calculus of age discrimination. The majority distinguishes <i>Griggs</i> from the ADEA on the grounds that <i>Griggs</i> interpreted Congress's intent underlying Title VII as sweeping in nature. The majority argues, \"[i]n contrast to the refined purpose evidenced in the historical underpinnings to the ADEA's enactment, the Supreme Court's opinion in <i>Griggs</i> discusses Title VII's broad remedial purpose.\" While it is undoubtably true that <i>Griggs</i> recognized disparate impact theory as an available tool in the employment discrimination toolbox to remedy past discrimination under Title VII, it does not necessarily follow, as the majority asserts, that the disparate impact tool is available only in a remedial context.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I disagree in two respects with the majority's holding that disparate impact theory should be limited to the context of Title VII. First, the textual similarity between Title VII and the ADEA evinces a congressional intent to provide similar protection against employment discrimination under the two statutes. Second, it is arguable whether historical discrimination should be a necessary precondition for recognizing a disparate impact theory. I acknowledge, as the majority does, that the ADEA and Title VII are distinct because the former lacks a history tied to past discrimination. In the absence of a clear statement to the contrary, however, I cannot assume that Congress intended to limit the remedial measures available under anti-discrimination statutes with almost identical language merely because the statutes arose out of distinct historical contexts. The Supreme Court in <i>Griggs,</i> for example, did not posit historical discrimination as the sole reason for disparate impact under Title VII; <i>Griggs</i> merely held that a showing of disparate impact was available to remedy this type of discrimination. <i>See</i> Jennifer J. Clemons and Richard A. Bales, <i>ADEA Disparate Impact in the Sixth Circuit,</i> 27 Ohio N.U. L.Rev. 1, 23 (2000). Moreover, the majority's emphasis on the historical posture of the ADEA and Title VII unduly minimizes the statutes shared aim of ridding from the workplace an environment of <i>concealed</i> discrimination. <i>Griggs,</i> 401 U.S. at 431, 91 S.Ct. 849 (stating that Title VII \"proscribes not only overt discrimination but also practices that are fair in form, but discriminatory in operation\"); <i>EEOC v. Wyoming,</i> 460 U.S. 226, 231, 103 S.Ct. 1054, 75 L.Ed.2d 18 (1983) (stating that the ADEA seeks to remedy \"arbitrary\" forms of age discrimination \"based in large part on stereotypes unsupported by objective facts, and often defended on grounds different from its actual causes\"). Consistent with such an aim, a disparate impact theory may be a plaintiff's only tool in counteracting sophisticated discrimination. Therefore, due to the similarity of the ADEA and Title VII language, it is my view that the protection available under both statutes, including that from disparate impact, should also be similar.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority ignores the fact that <i>Griggs</i> does not stand alone as the only relevant decision applying disparate impact theory. Under Supreme Court precedent, the disparate impact theory has grown beyond its original purpose of alleviating racial discrimination claims. <i>See Dothard v. Rawlinson,</i> 433 U.S. 321, 329-32, 97 S.Ct. 2720, 53 L.Ed.2d 786 (1977) (applying disparate impact theory to Title VII sex discrimination claims). Furthermore, under the 1991 Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000-e2(k)(1)(A)(I) (1994), disparate impact claims are readily available not only to plaintiffs alleging racial discrimination, but also to those claiming discrimination on the basis of gender, national origin, and religion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7-1\" id=\"fn7-1_ref\">7</a> In light of these developments, I cannot agree with the majority that the ADEA must be limited solely to disparate treatment claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I also do not agree with the majority's interpretation of the most prominent documentation of all ADEA legislative history, the Wirtz Report.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8-1\" id=\"fn8-1_ref\">8</a> The majority uses the Report to bolster its argument that the ADEA was not premised on eradicating past discrimination. The flaw with the majority's use of this most critical evidence of congressional intent is its failure to acknowledge the argument, embodied within the Wirtz Report, that age discrimination was in fact \"based in large part on stereotypes unsupported by objective fact, and was often defended on grounds different from its actual cause.\" <i>See EEOC,</i> 460 U.S. at 231, 103 S.Ct. 1054. The aforementioned conclusion seems to indicate that the ADEA's purpose may not have been limited to eradicating animus, as the majority suggests. Rather, and in contrast to the majority's view, the Wirtz Report indicates that Congress merely intended to utilize the ADEA to eliminate stereotypes that workers' productivity declines with age. That said, I acknowledge that the Wirtz Report is supportive evidence of Congress's intent concerning the ADEA and that the Report did in fact distinguish age discrimination as \"rarely based on the sort of animus motivating some other forms of discrimination.\" My position merely suggests that because the Wirtz Report sheds the best light on Congress's intent in enacting the ADEA, a point the majority does not refute, this Report arguably provides more support for affirming, rather than denying, that the ADEA contains a disparate impact cause of action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the legislative intent indicating that Congress meant to allow the disparate impact theory in ADEA actions may be discerned from a Congressional amendment. In 1994, Congress amended the ADEA by adding the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act (\"OWBPA\"). 29 U.S.C. &#167; &#167; 623, 626, 630(f) (1994). The statute requires an employer to provide the employee with information regarding the ages of workers offered severance pay and those who were not let go before the employee waives any potential discrimination claims. 29 U.S.C. &#167; 626(f)(1)(E)-(G), (H)(ii) (1994). These statistics, comparing the ages of those terminated and those retained, would be of little relevance if the employee could not bring a disparate impact claim. Therefore, the addition of the OWBPA is additional evidence that the disparate impact theory should be available under the ADEA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III. <i>CONCLUSION</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority today fails to heed the <i>Griggs</i> recognition that in a complex society, not all discrimination is apparent or overt. Often, such discrimination will be subtle and concealed. The practical consequence of the majority's decision is that it will allow an employer to exclude older workers from lower-level jobs simply on the basis of pretext, without an additional tool at the employee's disposal to counteract such sophisticated discriminatory acts. Contrary to the majority's stance, I agree with the Supreme Court's determination in <i>Hazen</i> that the disparate impact liability was designed to detect employment decisions that reflect \"inaccurate and stigmatizing stereotypes.\" 507 U.S. at 610, 113 S.Ct. 1701. Thus, I find no incompatibility with using disparate impact theory to prove liability under the ADEA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead, I am concerned that by not allowing a disparate impact cause of action under the ADEA, the majority has essentially held such plaintiffs to the heightened evidentiary standard of <i>Washington v. Davis,</i> 426 U.S. 229, 96 S.Ct. 2040, 48 L.Ed.2d 597 (1976), where sophisticated and concealed discrimination must be proved solely through intentional acts. The majority, however, fails to fully absorb the spirit of Justice Stevens's concurrence in <i>Davis</i> that \"the line between purpose and discriminatory impact is not nearly as bright, and perhaps not quite as critical, as the reader of the court's opinion may assume.\" <i>Id.</i> at 254, 96 S.Ct. 2040. Applied to our context, Justice Stevens's concurrence demonstrates that the majority's opinion, which distinguishes between intentional discrimination based on disparate treatment on the one hand and a disparate impact cause of action absent proof of intent on the other, may not be as clear as the majority seems to opine. Therefore, with regards to Part III of the majority opinion, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> <i>Mullin v.

The appeal presents an issue of first impression in our circuit regarding whether a disparate impact theory of liability is available to plaintiffs suing for age discrimination under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967. The district court ruled that, as a matter of law, claims of disparate impact cannot be brought under the Act. We agree and therefore affirm the judgment of the district court as to this issue. However, because the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on the plaintiffs' disparate treatment claim before addressing pending motions related to the plaintiffs' ability to fully develop the summary judgment record, we vacate the district court's final judgment insofar as it dismissed the plaintiffs' disparate treatment claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 14, 2001, thirty police officers and public safety dispatchers &#8212; all over the age of forty and all employed by the defendants &#8212; filed suit pursuant to the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\"ADEA\"), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 621 <i>et seq.</i> (2000). They claimed injuries as a result of an allegedly age-discriminatory performance pay plan (\"the plan\") implemented by the defendants in order to grant substantially larger salary increases to police officers and public safety dispatchers (collectively \"officers\") under the age of forty. The plan was implemented by the defendants on October 1, 1998, and revised by the defendants on March 1, 1999. Under the plan, those officers and dispatchers with five or fewer years of tenure with the department received proportionately greater raises when compared to their former pay than those with more than five years of tenure. As stated by the district court:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plan accordingly created three categories for the purposes of the analysis of this case: 1) those officers and dispatchers with less than five years of tenure, most, if not all, of whom would have been under 40 years of age; 2) those 40 years of age or older, most, if not all, of whom would have had more than five years of tenure, and; 3) those under 40 years of age with more than five years of tenure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 11, 2001, the plaintiffs moved to compel certain fiscal and personnel discovery related to the implementation and revision of the plan; the magistrate judge overseeing disputes related to discovery in this matter granted this motion on January 16, 2002, concluding that \"the fiscal and personnel discovery requested by the Plaintiffs is not privileged... and should be produced.\" On June 5, 2002, the plaintiffs filed a \"motion for sanctions, a default judgment, attorneys' fees and expenses, expert witness fees and a continuance,\" seeking to have the defendants comply with disclosure and discovery obligations as set forth in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the order of the magistrate judge. Two days later, the defendants moved for summary judgment, and the plaintiffs thereafter moved to strike certain exhibits to the defendants' motion, in part because the existence of the documents attached as exhibits had been previously denied by the defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 6, 2002, while the plaintiffs' motions were pending, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on the plaintiffs' disparate impact and disparate treatment claims and denied the plaintiffs' pending motions as moot.

Regarding their disparate impact theory, the plaintiffs allege that the implementation of the facially neutral plan by the defendants gives rise to liability without a showing of intentional age motivation because the plan resulted in pay increases to officers under forty years of age that were four standard deviations higher than the raises received by officers over forty. In support of their disparate impact theory, the plaintiffs proffered to the district court statistical data demonstrating that the average pay increases made pursuant to the plan differed by age and that older officers received smaller raises than their younger counterparts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a disparate treatment case, liability depends on whether the protected trait &#8212; here, age &#8212; actually motivated the employer's decision. <i>Hazen Paper Co. v.

Post-<i>Hazen</i> case law likewise reads the inclusion of the \"reasonable factors other than age\" exception to imply a congressional intent to remedy only intentional discrimination because of age through the passage of the ADEA. For example, the First Circuit states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A critical asymmetry in the texts of the ADEA and Title VII counsels convincingly against recognizing a disparate impact cause of action under the former statute.... This [\"reasonable factors other than age\"] proviso permits employers to utilize factors other than age as grounds for employment-related decisions that differentially impact members of the protected class (individuals between the ages of 40 and 69). When this exception is read with the ADEA's general prohibition against age-based discrimination, the resulting construction follows: it shall be unlawful to \"discriminate against any individual ... because of such individual's age,\" except when \"based on ... factors other than age.\" Thus, if the exception contained in section 623(f)(1) is not understood to preclude disparate impact liability, it becomes nothing more than a bromide to the effect that \"only age discrimination is age discrimination.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mullin,</i> 164 F.3d at 701-02. We too find that the inclusion of the \"reasonable factors other than age\" exception to the ADEA creates a critical \"asymmetry\" between the ADEA and Title VII.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> The addition of this broad exception to the ADEA, on its face, appears to preclude a disparate impact theory of liability under the ADEA; at a minimum, it amounts to a salient textual difference between the substantive liability provisions of the ADEA and Title VII&#8212;a difference not mentioned by any of the courts of appeals which have extended <i>Griggs</i> to the ADEA context.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While we believe that the \"reasonable factors other than age\" provision counsels against recognizing a disparate impact theory under the ADEA, we would not go so far as to say that it rules out any alternative reading. As the dissent argues, the prohibitory section and the \"reasonable factors other than age\" clause could together be read as announcing a general rule that disparate impact is actionable but then carving out a defense for adverse impacts that can be justified as a business necessity. The dissent's position is, of course, essentially how the courts have treated claims under Title VII. We do not believe this course is open to us, however. This circuit long ago held that &#167; 623(f)(1)'s \"reasonable factors other than age\" provision does not create an affirmative defense to liability; rather, it allows the defendant to bring forward evidence to negate the plaintiff's prima facie case. <i>See Marshall v.

Furthermore, whether or not &#167; 623(f)(1) is technically treated as a defense, we do not think that the reference to \"reasonable factors other than age\" can be taken to mean that all practices having a disparate impact are illegal unless they meet the stringent requirements of \"business necessity.\" Indeed, the Supreme Court has suggested a different meaning for the clause, stating that it \"insure[s] that employers [are] permitted to use <i>neutral criteria not directly dependent on age.\" EEOC v.

Therefore, we would not read the \"reasonable factors other than age\" clause as a limited derogation from a general prohibition against disparate impact.

This suggestion has no force in the sex discrimination context because each retiree's total pension benefits are ultimately determined by his <i>actual life span;</i> any differential in benefits paid to men and women in the aggregate is thus \"based on [a] factor other than sex,\" and consequently immune from challenge under the Equal Pay Act....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 710 n. 20, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109834\"><a href=\"/opinion/109834/los-angeles-dept-of-water-and-power-v-manhart/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Many provisions in the ADEA have their roots in the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Equal Pay Act. <i>See, e.g., Lorillard,</i> 434 U.S. at 577-82, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109777\"><a href=\"/opinion/109777/lorillard-v-pons/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">866</span></a></span> (discussing the Fair Labor Standards Act as the \"model\" for the enforcement and remedial provisions to the ADEA). Although legislative history on &#167; 623(f)(1) is slim, we find it likely that the ADEA's \"reasonable factors other than age\" exception was spawned from the Equal Pay Act's \"any factor other than sex\" exception, especially given that no parallel exception is found in Title VII.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize that the exceptions found in the ADEA and the Equal Pay Act are not identical. The most notable difference, emphasized by our colleague in dissent, is the inclusion of the word \"reasonable\" in the ADEA's exception. However, we, like the Eleventh Circuit in <i>Adams,</i> decline to infer from the inclusion of the word \"reasonable\" that Congress meant to create an implicit background rule that actions resulting in an age-disparate impact are as a general matter proscribed. <i>See</i> 255 F.3d at 1325 n. 6. As we explained above, we believe the better reading is not that the clause acts as a limited defense against disparate impact claims but rather that the clause signals that impacts resulting from neutral criteria not directly dependent on age are not prohibited in the first place. At the very least, we recognize the \"reasonable factors other than age\" exception as a clear textual difference between the ADEA and Title VII regarding employer liability &#8212; a distinction that, if nothing else, plainly contradicts the argument that the cognizability of a disparate impact claim under Title VII (as set forth in <i>Griggs</i>) controls the cognizability of a disparate impact claim under the ADEA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>(2) Legislative History and Policy Considerations</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the &#167; 623(f)(1) exception to the ADEA, strong policy considerations, revealed in the legislative history of the ADEA, underscore the differences between the ADEA and Title VII. Because the broad remedial purpose behind Title VII was central to the Court's statutory construction of Title VII in <i>Griggs,</i> the difference between the purposes behind the ADEA and Title VII is directly relevant to whether a disparate impact theory is cognizable under the ADEA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress enacted the ADEA after receiving a 1965 report by the Secretary of Labor regarding the problems of older workers. <i>See EEOC v.

For our purposes, it is significant that the Secretary's report finds \"no evidence of prejudice based on dislike or intolerance of the older worker\" and concludes that the main problem older workers faced in the workplace was arbitrary age discrimination &#8212; namely explicit age limitations &#8212; based on misconceptions about the abilities of older workers.

If the defendants meet this burden of production, the inference of discrimination drops, and the plaintiffs may then attempt to prove discrimination by offering evidence that the defendants' stated reason is pretextual. <i>Id.</i> (\"In a disparate treatment case ... a plaintiff must produce sufficient evidence to rebut a showing by the employer that there was a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for [differentially treating] a particular employee.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the district court dismissed the plaintiffs' disparate treatment claim because the plaintiffs could not make out their prima facie case based on the evidence available to them at the time their responsive briefing was filed. The district court cited this evidence as consisting of: (1) evidence that the Personnel Director for the City of Jackson, Dr. George Terry, represented that the plan considered tenure only once; and (2) evidence that certain officers were subjected to age-related comments by Dr. Terry, Officer Deric Hearn, and Deputy Chief Cleon Butler. The district court additionally held that the plaintiffs' evidence, as a matter of law, was insufficient to disprove the defendants' legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons for their employment decision &#8212; to bring starting salaries for police officers up to the regional average, to develop a more generous pay scale within the confines of the city budget, and to consider tenure in the pay scale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>B.

It also sought to compel disclosure of any related fiscal and personnel discovery in accordance with the order of the magistrate judge granting the plaintiffs' motion to compel. Finally, the motion sought a continuance of the discovery period in order to allow the defendants to produce discovery materials previously requested and to allow the plaintiffs an opportunity to further develop their case based on this new evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The July 11, 2002, motion sought to strike certain exhibits from the defendants' motion for summary judgment, in part because as to certain of these data produced as exhibits, \"[t]he counsel for the Defendants [had] insisted that no such wage data existed,\" and \"these data's purported existence and importance were never provided to the Plaintiffs until it was utilized by an Expert for the Defense.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Curiously, the district court did not rule on these motions. Instead, in deciding to grant the defendants' motion for summary judgment, the district court simply considered the evidence available to the plaintiffs at the time of their responsive briefing. After granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants as to the plaintiffs' disparate treatment claim, the court then disposed of the plaintiffs' pending motions by stating that \"[b]ecause the Court finds that Plaintiffs cannot meet their burden of proof for claims of disparate treatment under the ADEA, the other motions of Plaintiffs in opposition to the Motion of Defendant for Summary Judgment related to claims for disparate treatment are moot.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the plaintiffs contend that the dismissal of their disparate treatment claim was premature because they \"were not allowed to enforce their requests for discovery or to complete scheduled depositions that had been recessed when the plaintiffs learned that significant information had been willfully withheld from them.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>C.

These documents apparently include the working papers used by city officials in drafting the new and revised plans, as well as evidence regarding comparative wage data &#8212; including memoranda and other documentation related to the March 1, 1999, City of Jackson Pay Plan Revision, signed by all pertinent department heads, the existence of which was initially denied by the defendants. The plaintiffs allege that this evidence provides additional documentation verifying the extent of the disparity between wage increases for officers under the age of forty and officers over the age of forty. The plaintiffs also allege that this evidence provides them with documentation regarding the defendants' knowledge that, at least at the time the defendants revised the plan, the plan would result in inferior pay status for older workers when compared to younger workers. This evidence appears to us to be relevant to the plaintiffs' prima facie case and to their ultimate burden required to counter the defendants' proffered reasons for implementing the pay plan.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> While much of this evidence relates primarily to the plaintiffs' now-dismissed disparate impact claim, the impact evidence may also support a permissible inference of intentional discrimination and, as the plaintiffs argue, may relate to whether one of the defendants' proffered justifications &#8212; to bring salaries up to the regional average &#8212; is false.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not decide whether the defendants have, in fact, failed to comply with the magistrate judge's order, whether the motion to continue discovery should be granted, or whether the plaintiffs' other pending motions have merit. Rather, we simply hold that the district court should have addressed these motions before it ruled, on an apparently incomplete summary judgment record, that the plaintiffs had not met their burden of demonstrating the existence of genuine fact issues regarding their disparate treatment claim. If the defendants did not comply with their discovery obligations such that the plaintiffs were prohibited from presenting their best case to the district court, summary judgment in favor of the defendants improperly denied the plaintiffs an opportunity to continue discovery and supplement the record. <i>Sunbelt Sav., FSB v.

I, however, am not thoroughly convinced by the majority's attempt to distinguish between two statutes &#8212; the ADEA and Title VII &#8212; whose text is virtually the same, that Congress meant to imply a disparate impact claim to the latter, but to preclude such a claim in the former. Equally, I am not persuaded by the majority's emphasis on the \"reasonable factors other than age\" (\"RFOA\") exception. When Congress enacted the ADEA in 1967, the courts had yet to develop a disparate impact theory. Thus, at the time of enactment, it appears that Congress most likely intended the RFOA to apply solely to claims of disparate treatment. Based upon a close reading of the text, the relevant legislative history, subsequent legislative actions, and concerns of public policy, I submit that a proper interpretation of the ADEA allows a disparate impact cause of action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>STATUTORY INTERPRETATION OF THE ADEA</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority's analysis begins with the premise that the RFOA exception of the ADEA facially appears as a safe harbor to employers. To the majority, the language of the RFOA exception clearly rejects the theory of disparate impact. The majority relies in part on a pre-<i>Hazen</i> dissent by Judge Easterbrook in <i>Metz v. Transit Mix, Inc.,</i> for the proposition that the RFOA exception is \"<i>incomprehensible</i> unless the prohibition forbids disparate treatment and the exception authorizes disparate impact.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"494179\"><a href=\"/opinion/494179/wayne-r-metz-v-transit-mix-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">828</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1202</span></a></span>, 1220 (7th Cir.1987) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contrary to the majority's conclusion, it is not at all clear from the text that the RFOA exception <i>has no alternative interpretation</i> other than to preclude disparate impact. The RFOA exception aside, the language of the ADEA and Title VII are similar in every other respect. Thus, I cannot conclude, in the absence of expressed language to the contrary, that Congress meant to apply the disparate impact theory to Title VII, but not to the analogous language of the ADEA. Until the United States Supreme Court expressly rules on this issue, I continue to believe that the majority viewpoint is in error. Despite the obvious similarities between Title VII and the ADEA, today's majority joins our fellow courts of the First,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1\" id=\"fn1-1_ref\">1</a> Third,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1\" id=\"fn2-1_ref\">2</a> Sixth,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-1\" id=\"fn3-1_ref\">3</a> Seventh,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-1\" id=\"fn4-1_ref\">4</a> Tenth,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5-1\" id=\"fn5-1_ref\">5</a> and Eleventh<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6-1\" id=\"fn6-1_ref\">6</a> Circuits in disclaiming a disparate impact theory under the ADEA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As shown through persuasive precedent from other circuits, however, there is another side to this debate. For example, while acknowledging that post-<i>Hazen</i> the availability of disparate impact claims under the ADEA is unsettled among the circuits, the Second Circuit held that it \"generally assesses claims brought under the ADEA identically to those brought pursuant to Title VII, including disparate impact.\" <i>Smith v. Xerox,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766733\"><a href=\"/opinion/766733/john-b-smith-harold-wado-john-s-bernhard-philip-d-cufari-salvatore/\"><span class=\"volume\">196</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">358</span></a></span>, 367 n. 5 (2d Cir.1999).

In light of the parallels between the substantive provisions of the ADEA and Title VII, and in light of the fact that Congress has amended the ADEA several times but has never explicitly excluded disparate impact claims, a reasonable interpretation of the [RFOA exception] is that it codifies the business necessity exception to disparate impact claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Adams,</i> 255 F.3d at 1327-28 (Barkett, J., concurring).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I find Judge Barkett's reasoning fully persuasive. Under a theory of disparate impact, employers will still be able to have employment practices and policies that may burden over-age workers in a disproportionate way. These practices will be permissible, despite the disproportionate impact, provided the employer shows they are supported by a business necessity. Upon proving business necessity, the burden shifts to the employee to show that the practice in question was established not because of the legitimacy of the necessity, but merely as a pretext for invidious stereotyping. Therefore, I am not persuaded that adopting a disparate impact theory will lead to any inconsistencies with the RFOA exception.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That said, the cornerstone of the majority's holding relies on an analogous provision in the Equal Pay Act (\"EPA\"). Because the RFOA exception does not exist under Title VII, the majority looks instead to the EPA, which precludes disparate impact claims via its \"any factor other than sex\" language. The majority attempts to show that the similarities between the RFOA and EPA \"any factor\" exception should be construed by courts to demonstrate that the RFOA should similarly prohibit disparate impact. <i>See Washington v. Gunther,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110512\"><a href=\"/opinion/110512/county-of-washington-v-gunther/\"><span class=\"volume\">452</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">161</span></a></span>, 170, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110512\"><a href=\"/opinion/110512/county-of-washington-v-gunther/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">751</span></a></span> (1981) (juxtaposing the EPA's \"any factor other than sex\" language with Title VII's broadly inclusive prohibition against gender discrimination and stating that the language \"confine[d] the application of the Act to wage differentials attributable to sex discrimination.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The flaw in the majority's logic is that the terms \"any\" and \"reasonable\" are not synonymous. Under the ADEA, an employer with a disparate impact policy may be liable for age discrimination if factors relied on were not reasonable. Pursuant to the EPA, however, if an employment policy causes wage differences among men and women workers, the employer will not be liable unless the policy in question was based solely on gender. Thus, the ADEA and EPA exceptions cannot be read to have the same meaning unless the word \"reasonable\" is omitted from the RFOA exception. In this light, the premise of the majority opinion appears little more than ironic in that when it compares statutory language of the ADEA and Title VII to preclude disparate impact, the court advocates a dissimilar reading of almost identical statutes. Yet, when comparing the ADEA to the EPA, with the intent of precluding disparate impact, the majority applies a similar reading of exceptions which differ significantly. I disagree with the majority's analytical approach and its reading of <i>Gunther</i> as indicating that the ADEA cannot bar some \"reasonable factors other than age\" practices which have a disparate impact on workers over forty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, the majority's contention that the ADEA and Title VII are not similar statutes, insofar as their application of the disparate impact theory, disregards the doctrine of <i>in pari materia.</i> It has long been held that judicial interpretations of one statute may be informed by interpretations of similar statutes. <i>Lorillard v. Pons,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109777\"><a href=\"/opinion/109777/lorillard-v-pons/\"><span class=\"volume\">434</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">575</span></a></span>, 580-81, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109777\"><a href=\"/opinion/109777/lorillard-v-pons/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Under this well established statutory canon, \"the interpretation of one statute may be influenced by language of other statutes which are not specifically related, but which apply to similar persons, things, or relationships.\" <i>Nat.

Furthermore, <i>in pari materia</i> has relevance because both aforementioned statutes apply to similar persons (here, the employees) and similar relationships (here, the employment context). Moreover, Congress carefully chose identical language for its statutes dealing with both discrimination against older workers and discrimination against those due to race or gender. Therefore, the majority should have applied the doctrine of <i>in pari materia</i> and interpreted the disparate impact theory as applicable to the ADEA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>THE ADEA LEGISLATIVE HISTORY</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">My second point of disagreement with the majority concerns its portrayal of the legislative history of the ADEA. The majority opinion subtly recognizes that the legislative history of the ADEA is not directly on point. Although the majority's opinion properly recognizes that the Supreme Court's 1971 endorsement of the disparate impact theory in <i>Griggs,</i> 401 U.S. at 430-31, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108284\"><a href=\"/opinion/108284/griggs-v-duke-power-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">849</span></a></span>, was later in time than Congress's enactment of the ADEA in 1967, the majority attempts to support its position by focusing on the underlying purposes of the legislation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the language of Title VII and the ADEA are almost identical, the majority essentially dismisses <i>Griggs</i> as irrelevant to the calculus of age discrimination. The majority distinguishes <i>Griggs</i> from the ADEA on the grounds that <i>Griggs</i> interpreted Congress's intent underlying Title VII as sweeping in nature. The majority argues, \"[i]n contrast to the refined purpose evidenced in the historical underpinnings to the ADEA's enactment, the Supreme Court's opinion in <i>Griggs</i> discusses Title VII's broad remedial purpose.\" While it is undoubtably true that <i>Griggs</i> recognized disparate impact theory as an available tool in the employment discrimination toolbox to remedy past discrimination under Title VII, it does not necessarily follow, as the majority asserts, that the disparate impact tool is available only in a remedial context.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I disagree in two respects with the majority's holding that disparate impact theory should be limited to the context of Title VII. First, the textual similarity between Title VII and the ADEA evinces a congressional intent to provide similar protection against employment discrimination under the two statutes. Second, it is arguable whether historical discrimination should be a necessary precondition for recognizing a disparate impact theory. I acknowledge, as the majority does, that the ADEA and Title VII are distinct because the former lacks a history tied to past discrimination. In the absence of a clear statement to the contrary, however, I cannot assume that Congress intended to limit the remedial measures available under anti-discrimination statutes with almost identical language merely because the statutes arose out of distinct historical contexts. The Supreme Court in <i>Griggs,</i> for example, did not posit historical discrimination as the sole reason for disparate impact under Title VII; <i>Griggs</i> merely held that a showing of disparate impact was available to remedy this type of discrimination. <i>See</i> Jennifer J. Clemons and Richard A. Bales, <i>ADEA Disparate Impact in the Sixth Circuit,</i> 27 Ohio N.U. L.Rev. 1, 23 (2000). Moreover, the majority's emphasis on the historical posture of the ADEA and Title VII unduly minimizes the statutes shared aim of ridding from the workplace an environment of <i>concealed</i> discrimination. <i>Griggs,</i> 401 U.S. at 431, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108284\"><a href=\"/opinion/108284/griggs-v-duke-power-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">849</span></a></span> (stating that Title VII \"proscribes not only overt discrimination but also practices that are fair in form, but discriminatory in operation\"); <i>EEOC v. Wyoming,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110881\"><a href=\"/opinion/110881/eeoc-v-wyoming/\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">226</span></a></span>, 231, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110881\"><a href=\"/opinion/110881/eeoc-v-wyoming/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span> (1983) (stating that the ADEA seeks to remedy \"arbitrary\" forms of age discrimination \"based in large part on stereotypes unsupported by objective facts, and often defended on grounds different from its actual causes\"). Consistent with such an aim, a disparate impact theory may be a plaintiff's only tool in counteracting sophisticated discrimination. Therefore, due to the similarity of the ADEA and Title VII language, it is my view that the protection available under both statutes, including that from disparate impact, should also be similar.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority ignores the fact that <i>Griggs</i> does not stand alone as the only relevant decision applying disparate impact theory. Under Supreme Court precedent, the disparate impact theory has grown beyond its original purpose of alleviating racial discrimination claims. <i>See Dothard v. Rawlinson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109725\"><a href=\"/opinion/109725/dothard-v-rawlinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">321</span></a></span>, 329-32, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109725\"><a href=\"/opinion/109725/dothard-v-rawlinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">786</span></a></span> (1977) (applying disparate impact theory to Title VII sex discrimination claims). Furthermore, under the 1991 Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000-e2(k)(1)(A)(I) (1994), disparate impact claims are readily available not only to plaintiffs alleging racial discrimination, but also to those claiming discrimination on the basis of gender, national origin, and religion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7-1\" id=\"fn7-1_ref\">7</a> In light of these developments, I cannot agree with the majority that the ADEA must be limited solely to disparate treatment claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I also do not agree with the majority's interpretation of the most prominent documentation of all ADEA legislative history, the Wirtz Report.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8-1\" id=\"fn8-1_ref\">8</a> The majority uses the Report to bolster its argument that the ADEA was not premised on eradicating past discrimination. The flaw with the majority's use of this most critical evidence of congressional intent is its failure to acknowledge the argument, embodied within the Wirtz Report, that age discrimination was in fact \"based in large part on stereotypes unsupported by objective fact, and was often defended on grounds different from its actual cause.\" <i>See EEOC,</i> 460 U.S. at 231, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110881\"><a href=\"/opinion/110881/eeoc-v-wyoming/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1054</span></a></span>. The aforementioned conclusion seems to indicate that the ADEA's purpose may not have been limited to eradicating animus, as the majority suggests. Rather, and in contrast to the majority's view, the Wirtz Report indicates that Congress merely intended to utilize the ADEA to eliminate stereotypes that workers' productivity declines with age. That said, I acknowledge that the Wirtz Report is supportive evidence of Congress's intent concerning the ADEA and that the Report did in fact distinguish age discrimination as \"rarely based on the sort of animus motivating some other forms of discrimination.\" My position merely suggests that because the Wirtz Report sheds the best light on Congress's intent in enacting the ADEA, a point the majority does not refute, this Report arguably provides more support for affirming, rather than denying, that the ADEA contains a disparate impact cause of action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the legislative intent indicating that Congress meant to allow the disparate impact theory in ADEA actions may be discerned from a Congressional amendment. In 1994, Congress amended the ADEA by adding the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act (\"OWBPA\"). 29 U.S.C. &#167; &#167; 623, 626, 630(f) (1994). The statute requires an employer to provide the employee with information regarding the ages of workers offered severance pay and those who were not let go before the employee waives any potential discrimination claims. 29 U.S.C. &#167; 626(f)(1)(E)-(G), (H)(ii) (1994). These statistics, comparing the ages of those terminated and those retained, would be of little relevance if the employee could not bring a disparate impact claim. Therefore, the addition of the OWBPA is additional evidence that the disparate impact theory should be available under the ADEA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III. <i>CONCLUSION</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority today fails to heed the <i>Griggs</i> recognition that in a complex society, not all discrimination is apparent or overt. Often, such discrimination will be subtle and concealed. The practical consequence of the majority's decision is that it will allow an employer to exclude older workers from lower-level jobs simply on the basis of pretext, without an additional tool at the employee's disposal to counteract such sophisticated discriminatory acts. Contrary to the majority's stance, I agree with the Supreme Court's determination in <i>Hazen</i> that the disparate impact liability was designed to detect employment decisions that reflect \"inaccurate and stigmatizing stereotypes.\" 507 U.S. at 610, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112844\"><a href=\"/opinion/112844/hazen-paper-co-v-biggins/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1701</span></a></span>. Thus, I find no incompatibility with using disparate impact theory to prove liability under the ADEA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead, I am concerned that by not allowing a disparate impact cause of action under the ADEA, the majority has essentially held such plaintiffs to the heightened evidentiary standard of <i>Washington v. Davis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109469\"><a href=\"/opinion/109469/washington-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">426</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">229</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109469\"><a href=\"/opinion/109469/washington-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">597</span></a></span> (1976), where sophisticated and concealed discrimination must be proved solely through intentional acts. The majority, however, fails to fully absorb the spirit of Justice Stevens's concurrence in <i>Davis</i> that \"the line between purpose and discriminatory impact is not nearly as bright, and perhaps not quite as critical, as the reader of the court's opinion may assume.\" <i>Id.</i> at 254, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109469\"><a href=\"/opinion/109469/washington-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2040</span></a></span>. Applied to our context, Justice Stevens's concurrence demonstrates that the majority's opinion, which distinguishes between intentional discrimination based on disparate treatment on the one hand and a disparate impact cause of action absent proof of intent on the other, may not be as clear as the majority seems to opine. Therefore, with regards to Part III of the majority opinion, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> <i>Mullin v.
