Brenda Elem participated, as an employee of AirTran, in a self-funded\n\nemployee welfare benefit plan. After Elem suffered injuries in a car accident and\n\nthe plan paid over $100,000 for her medical care, Elem sued the other driver and\n\nsettled for $500,000. AirTran sought reimbursement from Elem, but Elem’s\n\nattorney, Mark Link, misrepresented that Elem had settled for only $25,000. Link’s\n\nsin then found him out, see Numbers 32:23, when he accidentally sent the plan a\n\ncopy of a settlement check for $475,000. After AirTran sued Elem, Link, and Link\n\n& Smith, P.C., for violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of\n\n1974, 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(3), the district court granted summary judgment and\n\nawarded attorney’s fees and costs in favor of AirTran.\n\n      Elem, Link, and the law firm challenge three orders. They contest the\n\nsummary judgment on the ground that AirTran failed to satisfy the strict tracing\n\nrules of equitable restitution, but these rules do not apply to the equitable lien by\n\nagreement that the AirTran plan created. See Sereboff v. Mid Atlantic Med. Serv.,\n\nInc., 547 U.S. 356, 364–65, 126 S. Ct. 1869, 1875 (2006). Elem and Link argue\n\nthat the district court abused its discretion when it awarded AirTran attorney’s fees\n\nand costs, but the district court had the authority to sanction them for their bad\n\n                                           2\n\f              Case: 13-11738     Date Filed: 09/23/2014    Page: 3 of 39\n\n\nfaith. Elem and Link also complain that the district court misapplied Federal Rule\n\nof Civil Procedure 70 when the court ordered enforcement of the judgment, but\n\nthat issue became moot when Link and his law firm complied with the order. We\n\naffirm the summary judgment and award of fees and costs and dismiss as moot the\n\nappeal of the order to enforce the judgment.\n\n                                 I. BACKGROUND\n\n      In 2007, Brenda Elem sustained injuries in a car accident. Her employer,\n\nAirTran, paid $131,704.28 for her medical care as a result of her participation in its\n\nself-funded employee welfare benefit plan. The plan designated Elem as a\n\nconstructive trustee over any payments recovered from third parties and created an\n\nequitable lien for the amount of benefits paid by the plan. Under the plan, when\n\nElem accepted her medical benefits from AirTran, she acknowledged that AirTran\n\nhad a first priority claim to all payments made by a third party, even if that third\n\nparty failed to pay the full amount of her damages. Months after the accident, the\n\nplan administrator advised Elem that, if she sued the driver of the other vehicle,\n\nMigel Rizo, the terms of the plan required Elem to reimburse AirTran with\n\nproceeds from that suit. And the plan administrator also advised Rizo’s insurer,\n\nAIG, of that right to reimbursement.\n\n\n\n                                           3\n\f              Case: 13-11738    Date Filed: 09/23/2014    Page: 4 of 39\n\n\n      In September 2007, when Elem contacted AIG to settle the claim against\n\nRizo within his liability policy limits of $25,000, she misrepresented that the plan\n\nwould have no lien against any funds she would recover from AIG. [Id.] She also\n\nstated that she intended to sue Rizo for the full amount of her damages if AIG\n\nrefused to pay the $25,000. AIG responded that Rizo’s policy limit was $25,000\n\nand that it would be willing to issue a settlement check for that amount to Elem if\n\nher plan “waive[d] their subrogation lien” or to Elem and the plan if the plan did\n\nnot waive the lien.\n\n      Elem hired Mark Link of Link & Smith, P.C., as her attorney and sued Rizo\n\nfor the injuries she sustained in the accident. AIG advised Link that it had offered\n\n$25,000 to Elem, but that AIG had notice of a lien and a duty to protect its insured.\n\nIn December 2007, the plan administrator for AirTran notified Link of the lien in\n\nfavor of AirTran.\n\n      Rizo and Elem later settled their lawsuit for $500,000. During the\n\nnegotiation of their settlement agreement, Link asked AIG to prepare two releases:\n\none reflecting payment of the policy limit of $25,000 and another for $475,000 in\n\nsettlement of Rizo’s claim of bad faith. Link also requested two separate checks\n\nand demanded that the $25,000 release not mention Rizo’s release of his claim of\n\n\n\n                                          4\n\f             Case: 13-11738     Date Filed: 09/23/2014   Page: 5 of 39\n\n\nbad faith. AIG responded that “it seems deceptive” to omit Rizo’s release of his\n\nclaim, but Link got his way.\n\n      Elem executed a release in favor of AIG for $25,000 and another release for\n\n$475,000 signed also by Rizo. AIG issued two separate settlement checks to Elem,\n\nLink, and Link & Smith, one for $25,000 and another for $475,000. Elem later\n\nreceived $274,184.08; Link & Smith retained $190,000.00 for attorney’s fees and\n\n$10,815.92 for expenses; and Link & Smith kept the remaining funds of $4,500.00\n\nin an escrow account.\n\n      When Link informed the plan administrator about the settlement, he stated\n\nthat Elem had settled her claim against Rizo for the policy limit of $25,000 and\n\n“has abandoned any hope of recovering” more than that amount. Although Link\n\nintended to enclose a copy of the $25,000 check as proof of that settlement, he\n\ninadvertently enclosed a copy of the $475,000 check. The plan administrator\n\nnoticed the error and demanded reimbursement from “[a]ll [s]ettlements and\n\n[j]udgments.”\n\n      When Elem refused to reimburse the plan, AirTran filed suit against Elem,\n\nLink, and Link & Smith. The parties filed cross motions for summary judgment,\n\nand the district court granted summary judgment in favor of AirTran. The court\n\n\n\n                                         5\n\f              Case: 13-11738    Date Filed: 09/23/2014    Page: 6 of 39\n\n\nthen awarded AirTran attorney’s fees in the amount of $145,723.28 and costs in\n\nthe amount of $3,692.52.\n\n      When Link still refused to pay, AirTran filed a motion to enforce the\n\njudgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 70. Elem and Link responded that\n\nRule 70 was inapplicable because the judgment against them was for money\n\ndamages enforceable only through a writ of execution. The district court granted\n\nthe motion and ordered Elem and Link to satisfy the full amount of the judgment or\n\npost a bond. AirTran later moved to hold Elem and Link in contempt when they\n\nrefused to comply with the order, but AirTran withdrew the motion when Link and\n\nLink & Smith eventually paid the full amount of the judgment and attorney’s fees\n\nand costs. At oral argument, the parties stipulated that Link and his firm\n\nconditioned this payment on the disposition of the appeal of the summary\n\njudgment and the award of attorney’s fees and costs.\n\n                         II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n\n      Two standards of review govern us. First, we review de novo a summary\n\njudgment and draw all inferences and review all evidence in the light most\n\nfavorable to the nonmoving party. Hamilton v. Southland Christian Sch., Inc., 680\n\nF.3d 1316, 1318 (11th Cir. 2012). Summary judgment should be granted only\n\nwhen the movant establishes that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that\n\n                                          6\n\f              Case: 13-11738     Date Filed: 09/23/2014    Page: 7 of 39\n\n\nthe movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Id. We also review the\n\nmootness of an appeal de novo. Tanner Adver. Grp., L.L.C. v. Fayette Cnty., Ga.,\n\n451 F.3d 777, 784 (11th Cir. 2006). Second, we review for abuse of discretion an\n\naward of attorney’s fees and costs. Byars v. Coca-Cola Co., 517 F.3d 1256, 1263\n\n(11th Cir. 2008).\n\n                                 III. DISCUSSION\n\n      Elem and Link contest the summary judgment in favor of AirTran, the award\n\nof fees and costs, and the issuance of the Rule 70 order to enforce the judgment,\n\nbut their arguments fail. We discuss each order of the district court in turn.\n\nA. The District Court Correctly Granted Summary Judgment in Favor of AirTran.\n\n      We divide this section in two parts. We first discuss Elem and Link’s\n\nchallenge to the summary judgment in favor of AirTran on the ground that AirTran\n\nfailed to seek equitable relief. We second discuss Elem and Link’s attempts to\n\navoid liability based on four technicalities, none of which justify the breach of their\n\nfiduciary duty.\n\n                    1. AirTran seeks appropriate equitable redress.\n\n      The Act permits AirTran to file a civil action “to obtain . . . appropriate\n\nequitable relief . . . to redress” the misdeeds of Elem, Link, and Link & Smith. 29\n\nU.S.C. § 1132(a)(3) (B). “[A]ppropriate equitable relief” includes only “those\n\n                                           7\n\f              Case: 13-11738    Date Filed: 09/23/2014    Page: 8 of 39\n\n\ncategories of relief that were typically available in equity,” Great-West Life &\n\nAnnuity Ins. Co. v. Knudson, 534 U.S. 204, 210, 122 S. Ct. 708, 712 (2002). Elem\n\nand Link argue that AirTran cannot recover Elem’s medical costs because AirTran\n\nseeks money damages, a legal remedy, but AirTran contends that the plan created\n\nan equitable lien by agreement over the settlement funds. AirTran argues that it\n\nseeks to recover “specifically identifiable funds” in “the possession and control” of\n\nElem and Link, that the plan created an equitable lien by agreement, and that its\n\nclaim, therefore, falls within “appropriate equitable relief” allowed under the Act.\n\nSereboff, 547 U.S. at 362–63, 126 S. Ct. at 1874 (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).\n\n      This case sounds in equity. When AirTran filed suit against Elem and Link,\n\nit did so to enforce the equitable lien by agreement created by the plan. In “the\n\ndays of the divided bench,” this suit would have been equitable in nature. See id. at\n\n363–65, 126 S. Ct. at 1874–76. Like the plan in Sereboff, the unambiguous terms\n\nof the AirTran plan created an equitable lien against any settlement funds that\n\nElem received as a result of her accident. As soon as AIG gave Elem the settlement\n\nfunds, AirTran “could follow it into the hands of [Elem and Link].” Barnes v.\n\nAlexander, 232 U.S. 117, 123, 34 S. Ct. 276, 278 (1914).\n\n\n\n                                          8\n\f              Case: 13-11738     Date Filed: 09/23/2014   Page: 9 of 39\n\n\n      We must also ensure that the nature of the remedy AirTran seeks is\n\nequitable. Compare Sereboff, 547 U.S. at 361–63, 126 S. Ct. at 1873–74, with\n\nKnudson, 534 U.S. at 212–14, 122 S. Ct. at 714–15. Elem and Link are correct that\n\nthe remedy of money damages is quintessentially a remedy at law. For that reason,\n\na plan may not file suit against a beneficiary for reimbursement and seek recovery\n\nfrom “assets generally” of that beneficiary, because that suit would seek legal, not\n\nequitable, restitution. Sereboff, 547 U.S. at 363, 126 S. Ct. at 1874 (distinguishing\n\nKnudson). But when a plan seeks “specifically identifiable funds” in “the\n\npossession and control” of a beneficiary, such restitution of the funds is equitable\n\nin nature. Id. at 362–63, 126 S. Ct. at 1874 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n      AirTran seeks an equitable remedy. AirTran filed suit to enforce its\n\nequitable lien over “specifically identifiable funds” that Elem had in her\n\n“possession.” See Sereboff, 547 U.S. at 362–63, 126 S. Ct. at 1874 (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted). According to the plain terms of the plan, the settlement\n\nthat AIG paid to Elem constitutes the specifically identifiable funds over which\n\nAirTran had a lien. Elem and Link attempt to liken those settlement funds to the\n\nfunds in Knudson, but, unlike the beneficiary in Knudson, Elem possessed the\n\nfunds. Id. (distinguishing Knudson on the ground that the beneficiary never\n\npossessed the settlement fund); see also Thurber v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., 712 F.3d\n\n                                          9\n\f             Case: 13-11738     Date Filed: 09/23/2014    Page: 10 of 39\n\n\n654, 664 (2d Cir. 2013) (“[A]ll that matters is that the beneficiary did, at some\n\npoint, have possession and control of the specific portion of the particular fund\n\nsought by the insurer.”). Once she possessed those funds, the equitable lien by\n\nagreement attached to them, making them “specifically identifiable.” Sereboff, 547\n\nU.S. at 362–63, 126 S. Ct. at 1874.\n\n      We disagree with our dissenting colleague, who adopts the position of the\n\nNinth Circuit and concludes that AirTran cannot collect what it is owed because it\n\nhas not traced the settlement funds after Elem divided them with her attorney.\n\n(Dissenting Op. at 30–33). See Bilyeu v. Morgan Stanley Long Term Disability\n\nPlan, 683 F.3d 1083, 1095 (9th Cir. 2012) (“Nothing in Sereboff suggests that a\n\nfiduciary can enforce an equitable lien against a beneficiary’s general assets when\n\nspecifically identified funds are no longer in a beneficiary’s possession.”). It\n\nmatters not whether the settlement funds have since been disbursed or commingled\n\nwith other funds. In Sereboff, the Supreme Court made clear that AirTran need not\n\ntrace the settlement fund back to AirTran to enforce its equitable lien by\n\nagreement. Id. at 364–65, 126 S. Ct. at 1875–76. As soon as the settlement fund\n\nwas identified, the plan imposed an equitable lien over that fund even though it\n\nwas in the hands of the beneficiaries. Id. at 363–64, 126 S. Ct. at 1875. And in the\n\nwake of Sereboff, our sister circuits have concluded that “[p]roperty to which the\n\n                                          10\n\f              Case: 13-11738     Date Filed: 09/23/2014    Page: 11 of 39\n\n\nlien attached may be converted into other property without affecting the efficacy of\n\nthe lien.” Funk v. CIGNA Grp. Ins., 648 F.3d 182, 194 (3d Cir. 2011); see Cent.\n\nStates, Se. & Sw. Areas Health & Welfare Fund v. Lewis, 745 F.3d 283, 285 (7th\n\nCir. 2014) (“The defendants argued . . . that because the settlement funds have\n\nbeen dissipated, this really is a suit for damages . . . . But the defendants are\n\nwrong.”); Thurber, 712 F.3d at 663–64 (“[T]he beneficiary’s literal segregation of\n\nfunds is irrelevant when the terms of the . . . plan put the beneficiary on notice that\n\nshe would be required to reimburse the insurer for an amount equal to what she\n\nmight get from third-party sources.” (alterations and internal quotation marks\n\nomitted)); Cusson v. Liberty Life Assurance Co. of Boston, 592 F.3d 215, 231 (1st\n\nCir. 2010); Longaberger Co. v. Kolt, 586 F.3d 459, 466–67 (6th Cir. 2009); see\n\nalso Popowski v. Parrott, 461 F.3d 1367, 1374 n.8 (11th Cir. 2006) (“[T]he fact\n\nthat the third-party recovery triggering the [p]lan’s reimbursement provision was\n\ncomingled, even absent tracing, would not have disqualified an equitable lien had\n\nthat equitable lien been by agreement . . . .”). We join those circuit courts and\n\nconclude that, even though Elem willfully refused to abide by the terms of the\n\nAirTran plan, her dereliction as a constructive trustee could not destroy the lien\n\nthat attached before Elem divided the funds with her attorney. See Barnes, 232\n\nU.S. at 122, 34 S. Ct. at 278 (explaining that the lien often attaches before the\n\n                                           11\n\f             Case: 13-11738     Date Filed: 09/23/2014   Page: 12 of 39\n\n\nspecific funds exist). Elem and Link argue that AirTran may take only the\n\nremaining $4,500 of settlement funds left in the escrow account, but they\n\nmisunderstand that the plan imposed a lien for the entire $131,704.28 of medical\n\nbenefits paid, which attached when Elem obtained the settlement funds. Contrary\n\nto Elem and Link’s argument, these “specifically identifiable funds” did not\n\ndisappear when they divided the money.\n\n      By the terms of the plan, AirTran paid for Elem’s medical care and, as a\n\nresult, could enforce it the moment Elem possessed the settlement checks from\n\nAIG. Even though Elem and Link distributed the funds, the res remained the same:\n\nthe amount of the medical benefits paid to Elem. See Barnes, 232 U.S. at 122, 34\n\nS. Ct. at 278. Elem and Link cannot defeat the first priority lien of AirTran, and\n\nElem cannot abandon her duties as trustee under the constructive trust by\n\ncommingling the res with other funds. See Gutta v. Standard Select Trust Ins.\n\nPlans, 530 F.3d 614, 621 (7th Cir. 2008) (“[The insurer] may bring its\n\ncounterclaim [for reimbursement] even if the benefits it paid Gutta are not\n\nspecifically traceable to Gutta’s current assets because of commingling or\n\ndissipation.”). Their dishonesty and manipulation of the settlement funds cannot\n\ndestroy the lien of AirTran over the “specifically identifiable” monies.\n\n\n\n                                         12\n\f             Case: 13-11738     Date Filed: 09/23/2014   Page: 13 of 39\n\n\n    2. Elem and Link’s remaining arguments about the summary judgment are\n                                   meritless.\n\n      Elem and Link raise four additional arguments, none of which we find\n\npersuasive. First, Link and Link & Smith argue that AirTran cannot recover from\n\nthem as third-party attorneys. Second, Elem and Link argue that, when AIG funded\n\nthe $475,000 portion of the settlement, AIG no longer qualified as a “responsible\n\nparty” under the plan. Third, they argue that AirTran cannot force Elem to\n\nreimburse it because AirTran never disclosed to her the plan terms. Fourth, Elem\n\nseeks to avoid liability by arguing that, because the plan administrator provided\n\nhealthcare services, AirTran cannot sue to enforce its right to reimbursement. We\n\naddress each of these arguments in turn.\n\n      Link and Link & Smith argue that they are not proper defendants because\n\nAirTran cannot seek reimbursement from a third-party attorney, but that argument\n\nfails. A plan may recover from a nonfiduciary party in interest, even if that party\n\nhas not violated a duty expressly imposed by the Act. Harris Trust & Sav. Bank v.\n\nSaloman Smith Barney, Inc., 530 U.S. 238, 245, 120 S. Ct. 2180, 2186–87 (2000).\n\nBecause Elem breached her fiduciary duty as trustee and transferred the trust\n\nproperty to Link and Link & Smith, the attorneys took the property subject to the\n\ntrust, unless they purchased the property for value and without notice of the\n\nfiduciary’s breach of duty. Id. at 250, 120 S. Ct. at 2189. Even if Link and Link &\n                                           13\n\f             Case: 13-11738      Date Filed: 09/23/2014   Page: 14 of 39\n\n\nSmith were not the original wrongdoers, they are not insulated from liability for\n\nrestitution. Id. at 251, 120 S. Ct. at 2189; see also Bombardier Aerospace\n\nEmployee Welfare Benefits Plan v. Ferrer, Poirot & Wansbrough, 354 F.3d 348,\n\n357–58 (5th Cir. 2003), abrogated on other grounds, ACS Recovery Serv., Inc. v.\n\nGriffin, 723 F.3d 518 (5th Cir. 2013) (en banc). And Link and Link & Smith are\n\nhardly innocent parties. Link and his firm tried to hide the full amount of the\n\nsettlement agreement from AirTran. Link represented that the $25,000 would take\n\ncare of any liens on the settlement asserted by AirTran, but paid himself and his\n\nfirm $200,815.92. Even if they had not known of the first priority lien of AirTran,\n\nthey could not defeat the lien, but the record makes clear that the plan\n\nadministrator had repeatedly notified Link and Link & Smith that AirTran had an\n\nequitable lien and intended to enforce it.\n\n      Link and his firm knew that they took fees and costs subject to the lien held\n\nby AirTran, and they cannot now avoid liability by asserting that they did not agree\n\nto the terms of the plan. The lien arose before they entered into a contingency fee\n\narrangement with Elem, and Elem agreed to the terms of the plan long ago. She\n\nagreed that “[t]he Plan is not required to participate in or pay court costs or\n\nattorney fees to any attorney hired by [Elem] to pursue [Elem]’s damage claim.”\n\nThese obligations, which “precluded [Elem] from contracting away to the law firm\n\n                                             14\n\f             Case: 13-11738     Date Filed: 09/23/2014    Page: 15 of 39\n\n\nthat which [she] did not own [herself], namely, the right to all or any portion of the\n\n[sum] that rightfully belonged to the Plan,” predated her attorney-client\n\nrelationship with Link and his firm. Bombardier, 354 F.3d at 357. That Link and\n\nhis firm disregarded the first priority lien of AirTran and commingled the\n\nsettlement funds does not defeat the claim for equitable relief by AirTran because,\n\n“under Sereboff, [AirTran] was free to follow a portion of the settlement funds into\n\n[Link and Link & Smith’s] hands.” Longaberger Co., 586 F.3d at 469.\n\n      Elem and Link argue too that Elem could not have wrongfully transferred\n\nthe settlement funds because Elem never had “possession” of those funds. They\n\nexplain that AIG transferred the funds to Link and his firm. They argue that,\n\nbecause Elem never possessed the funds, her duty to reimburse AirTran was never\n\ntriggered.\n\n      Nonsense. Even if AIG wrote and delivered the checks to Link and his firm,\n\nElem “had at least constructive possession and control of the fund[s] to facilitate\n\nthe settlement.” Griffin, 723 F.3d at 529 (“Griffin’s attempt to divorce himself\n\nfrom the origin of the fund and its disposition is no more persuasive than if he had\n\ndirected the money to a close relative. . . . [H]e could not give away that which he\n\ndid not possess.”). And here, Elem likely had “actual possession” because her\n\nattorney, as her agent, received and deposited the checks.\n\n                                          15\n\f              Case: 13-11738    Date Filed: 09/23/2014    Page: 16 of 39\n\n\n        Elem and Link also argue that AirTran cannot seek reimbursement because\n\nAIG is not a “responsible party” under the terms of the plan. They argue that, when\n\nAIG paid the $475,000 check, AIG no longer qualified as a “responsible party” for\n\nthe purposes of reimbursement because AIG was no longer providing “liability\n\ncoverage” for Rizo, but this argument contravenes the plain terms of the plan.\n\n        The terms of the plan entitle AirTran to reimbursement from “any payment”\n\nfrom “any Responsible Party as a result of an injury, illness, or condition.” The\n\nplan defines “Responsible Party” as “any party actually, possibly, or potentially\n\nresponsible for making any payment to a Covered Person due to a Covered\n\nPerson’s injury, illness or condition[, which] includes the liability insurer of such\n\nparty or any insurance coverage.” Because AIG settled the lawsuit for $500,000, it\n\nmeets the definition of a “responsible party.” It matters not at all that Rizo’s policy\n\nlimits were only $25,000 because the terms of the plan allow AirTran to recover\n\n“any payment” to Elem “due to” her injury. AirTran now may seek its “specifically\n\nidentifiable” amount from the $500,000 for medical expenses paid on behalf of\n\nElem.\n\n        Elem and Link also attempt to evade liability by arguing that AirTran cannot\n\nforce Elem to reimburse AirTran because she never saw the plan documents, but\n\nElem accepted the benefits and is bound by the terms of the plan unless AirTran\n\n                                          16\n\f              Case: 13-11738     Date Filed: 09/23/2014    Page: 17 of 39\n\n\nprejudiced Elem by its failure to disclose them. Our Court has said that “the\n\nquantity of an employer’s procedural violations,” such as failure to abide by\n\ndisclosure requirements, “may work a substantive harm.” Harris v. Pullman\n\nStandard, Inc., 809 F.2d 1495, 1499 (11th Cir. 1987). But an employee must\n\nestablish that she was prejudiced by an infraction committed by the plan. See Hein\n\nv. TechAmerica Grp., Inc., 17 F.3d 1278, 1280–81 (10th Cir. 1994); see Kreutzer\n\nv. A.O. Smith Corp., 951 F.2d 739, 743 (7th Cir. 1991) (requiring bad faith, active\n\nconcealment, or inducement to rely on a faulty plan summary by an administrator\n\nbefore a court will award recovery for procedural violations).\n\n      Elem has not alleged that AirTran committed a multitude of procedural\n\nviolations or that she was prejudiced by any nondisclosure. Nor can she. The plan\n\nadministrator repeatedly sent letters expressing its intent to pursue reimbursement.\n\nAnd Elem allowed AirTran to pay over $130,000 of her medical bills. Elem knew\n\nof the lien before disbursing the funds to herself and to her attorney, and she\n\ncannot avoid liability on a technicality. See Weinreb v. Hosp. for Joint Diseases\n\nOrthopaedic Inst., 404 F.3d 167, 171–72 (2d Cir. 2005) (“Where a plan\n\nadministrator fails to fulfill its statutory duty . . . , but where the evidence shows\n\nthat the claimant had actual knowledge of the requirement at issue, the error is\n\nnecessarily harmless.”).\n\n                                           17\n\f             Case: 13-11738     Date Filed: 09/23/2014    Page: 18 of 39\n\n\n      Finally, Elem and Link argue that AirTran lacks standing to seek\n\nreimbursement of Elem’s medical costs that the plan administrator paid, but they\n\nmisunderstand the nature of the self-funded employee benefit plan offered by\n\nAirTran. Under the terms of the plan, AirTran provided various benefit options to\n\nits employees and contracted with the plan administrator to provide various\n\nservices, including network access, subrogation, and patient management services.\n\nIn the district court, Elem relied on language in the Benefits Enrollment Guide,\n\nwhich refers to healthcare services provided by the plan administrator, but the\n\nprovision of those administrative services does not give the plan administrator the\n\nright to seek reimbursement from Elem. Instead, AirTran still paid for all expenses\n\nincurred by its participants, including Elem. We reject Elem and Link’s argument\n\nthat AirTran cannot now recover its costs because it contracted with the plan\n\nadministrator.\n\n B. The District Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion by Awarding Attorney’s Fees\n                             and Costs to AirTran.\n       A district court, “in its discretion,” may award attorney’s fees to a party, 29\n\nU.S.C. § 1132(g)(1), if that party achieved “some degree of success on the merits,”\n\nHardt v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co., 560 U.S. 242, 255, 130 S. Ct. 2149, 2158\n\n(2010). We require district courts to consider five factors when deciding whether to\n\naward fees to a prevailing party:\n                                          18\n\f             Case: 13-11738      Date Filed: 09/23/2014    Page: 19 of 39\n\n\n      (1) the degree of the opposing parties’ culpability or bad faith; (2) the\n      ability of the opposing parties to satisfy an award of attorney’s fees;\n      (3) whether an award of attorney’s fees against the opposing parties\n      would deter other persons acting under similar circumstances; (4)\n      whether the parties requesting attorney’s fees sought to benefit all\n      participants and beneficiaries of an ERISA plan or to resolve a\n      significant legal question regarding ERISA itself; [and] (5) the\n      relative merits of the parties’ positions.\n\nFreeman v. Continental Ins. Co., 996 F.2d 1116, 1119 (11th Cir. 1993). We have\n\nexplained that “[n]o one of these factors is necessarily decisive, . . . but together\n\nthey are the nuclei of concerns that a court should address.” Iron Workers Local\n\nNo. 272 v. Bowen, 624 F.2d 1255, 1266 (5th Cir. 1980).\n\n      Elem and Link argue that the district court unjustly awarded AirTran\n\nattorney’s fees, but the five Freeman factors support the award. First, we rarely see\n\nsuch a textbook example of “bad faith.” Link intentionally attempted to deceive the\n\nplan administrator when he sent the letter stating that $25,000 represented the\n\nentire settlement amount. And he coerced AIG to draft two separate releases to\n\neffectuate his deception. Fortunately for AirTran, his scheme came crashing down\n\nwhen he sent a copy of the $475,000 check to the plan administrator. His actions\n\nno doubt evince bad faith. Second, Link and Link & Smith have already satisfied\n\nthe award, although conditionally. Third, an award of attorney’s fees in this\n\ncircumstance would help deter others from cheating their employee benefit plan.\n\nFourth, the award protects plan assets, which benefit all plan participants. And\n                                           19\n\f             Case: 13-11738     Date Filed: 09/23/2014   Page: 20 of 39\n\n\nfifth, the defense mounted by AirTran was highly meritorious. The district court\n\ndid not abuse its discretion when it awarded attorney’s fees to AirTran.\n\n C. The Payment of the Award of Fees and Costs Moots Any Argument About the\n              Entry of the Rule 70 Order by the District Court.\n\n      Elem and Link argue that the district court misinterpreted Federal Rule of\n\nCivil Procedure 70 when it ordered them to pay the full amount of the judgment\n\nand fees and costs. Rule 70 provides, “If a judgment requires a party to convey\n\nland, to deliver a deed or other document, or to perform any other specific act and\n\nthe party fails to comply within the time specified, the court may order the act to be\n\ndone—at the disobedient party’s expense—by another person appointed by the\n\ncourt.” Rule 70 “gives the district court a discrete and limited power to deal with\n\nparties who thwart final judgments by refusing to comply with orders to perform\n\nspecific acts.” Analytical Eng’g, Inc. v. Baldwin Filters, Inc., 425 F.3d 443, 449\n\n(7th Cir. 2005). Elem and Link contend that the district court erroneously\n\nconverted a final money judgment at law into an injunction and that the judgment\n\nwas enforceable only through a writ of execution.\n\n      This issue is no longer justiciable because the appeal of the order is now\n\nmoot. Instead of posting a supersedeas bond, Link and his firm paid the full\n\namount due to AirTran to avoid being held in contempt. Even if we agreed that the\n\ndistrict court erred when it issued that order, we could not grant any meaningful\n                                         20\n\f             Case: 13-11738     Date Filed: 09/23/2014    Page: 21 of 39\n\n\nrelief because the defendants have already complied with it. See Bradford Marine,\n\nInc. v. M/V Sea Falcon, 64 F.3d 585, 587 n.1 (11th Cir. 1995); Fidelcor Mortg.\n\nCorp. v. Ins. Co. of N. Am., 820 F.2d 367, 370 (11th Cir. 1987) (“When it executed\n\nthe satisfaction of the judgment, it included no reservation allowing it to proceed\n\nwith an appeal on some issues; it satisfied the judgment in toto. Therefore, there is\n\nnothing left from which it may appeal.”). No case or controversy about the merits\n\nof the Rule 70 order remains after the payment. See RES-GA Cobblestone, LLC v.\n\nBlake Constr. & Dev., LLC, 718 F.3d 1308, 1314 (11th Cir. 2013) (“Where no\n\nlegally cognizable interest is at stake between the parties, a case becomes moot. . . .\n\nThis is so no matter how vehemently the parties continue to dispute the issues that\n\nanimated the litigation.” (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).\n\n      We are befuddled by our dissenting colleague’s contrary conclusion.\n\n(Dissenting Op. at 36–39). At oral argument, when we asked counsel for Elem,\n\nLink, and Link & Smith what injury they now suffered as a result of the Rule 70\n\norder even though they had paid the judgment, he answered, “Any injury now,\n\nperhaps not.” We reiterate that because Link and Link & Smith have complied\n\nwith the Rule 70 order by paying the judgment, we cannot afford them any\n\nmeaningful relief even if that order was in error.\n\n\n\n                                          21\n\f            Case: 13-11738    Date Filed: 09/23/2014   Page: 22 of 39\n\n\n                             IV. CONCLUSION\n\n      We AFFIRM the summary judgment and award of attorney’s fees and costs\n\nin favor of AirTran and DISMISS as moot the appeal of the order under Rule 70.\n\n\n\n\n                                       22\n\f              Case: 13-11738     Date Filed: 09/23/2014     Page: 23 of 39\n\n\nMARTIN, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\n       AirTran Airways, Inc. (AirTran) says that its suit seeks equitable relief, but\n\nit fails to make a critical showing for purposes of equity: that the defendants\n\nremain in possession of the disputed property. For the reasons that follow, I have\n\ncome to understand that AirTran’s suit seeks a legal remedy which is not permitted\n\nunder the statute it relies on. Based on this understanding, I would reverse the\n\nDistrict Court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of AirTran, its order awarding\n\nattorney’s fees and costs, and its later Rule 70 order enforcing the judgment.\n\n  I.   THE DISTRICT COURT IMPROPERLY GRANTED SUMMARY\n         JUDGMENT BY CLASSIFYING AIRTRAN’S CLAIMS AS\n                          EQUITABLE.\n\n       At issue is whether AirTran’s suit against Brenda Elem, her attorney Mark\n\nLink, and his law firm Link & Smith, P.C. (Link & Smith) (collectively the\n\ndefendants) to recover settlement funds subject to an equitable lien by agreement is\n\npermitted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 29\n\nU.S.C. § 1132(a)(3)(B). This statute gives courts the power to grant “other\n\nappropriate equitable relief” only when enforcing a covered insurance plan.\n\nSpecifically, a plan fiduciary may bring a civil action under ERISA “to obtain\n\nother appropriate equitable relief . . . to enforce . . . the terms of the plan.” 29\n\nU.S.C. § 1132(a)(3)(B)(ii). The Supreme Court has construed this section to\n\n                                            23\n\f              Case: 13-11738     Date Filed: 09/23/2014    Page: 24 of 39\n\n\nauthorize only “those categories of relief that were typically available in equity.”\n\nMertens v. Hewitt Assocs., 508 U.S. 248, 256, 113 S. Ct. 2063, 2069 (1993).\n\nThus, the statute offers no relief for legal claims. Whether a remedy is “legal or\n\nequitable depends on the basis for [the plaintiff’s] claim and the nature of the\n\nunderlying remedies sought.” Great-West Life & Annuity Ins. Co. v. Knudson,\n\n534 U.S. 204, 213, 122 S. Ct. 708, 714 (2002) (alteration in original) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n      I certainly recognize that AirTran’s claim here is one arising in equity. The\n\nclear terms of the insurance plan created an equitable lien by agreement over the\n\nmoney Ms. Elem got as a result of her third party suit from the moment she had\n\nactual or constructive possession of that money. However, on the facts before us,\n\nthe only remedy available to AirTran is legal, not equitable, in nature. Money\n\ndamages are traditionally a remedy at law, but can be equitable if the plaintiff\n\nseeks: (1) “specifically identifiable funds” in (2) the defendant’s “possession and\n\ncontrol.” Sereboff v. Mid Atl. Med. Servs., Inc., 547 U.S. 356, 362–63, 126 S. Ct.\n\n1869, 1874 (2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). AirTran properly identified\n\nspecific funds, but failed to establish that the identifiable funds are “in the\n\npossession and control” of the defendants. The remedy AirTran seeks is therefore\n\na legal one and is not permitted under 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(3)(B).\n\n                                           24\n\f             Case: 13-11738     Date Filed: 09/23/2014    Page: 25 of 39\n\n\n          A. A MONEY DAMAGE AWARD IS ONLY EQUITABLE IF THE\n                   DEFENDANT REMAINS IN POSSESSION.\n\n      Supreme Court precedent makes clear that a plaintiff proceeding in equity to\n\nrecover funds from a defendant must, at a minimum, show that those funds are\n\npresently in the defendant’s possession. In Walker v. Brown, 165 U.S. 654, 17 S.\n\nCt. 453 (1897), the Supreme Court was asked to decide whether an equitable lien\n\nby agreement remained attached to certain Memphis city bonds in the hands of the\n\nwidow of a businessman who pledged the bonds to plaintiff J. H. Walker & Co.\n\n(Walker). That businessman, Mr. Brown, had actually pledged the bonds to\n\nWalker for the benefit of a third party. As that third party got into financial\n\ndifficulties, Mr. Brown paid its creditors the value of the bonds, retook possession\n\nof the bonds, and then gifted them to his wife before he passed away. The\n\nSupreme Court held that the lien by agreement was not extinguished when Mr.\n\nBrown bought them back, and that the “equitable lien will be enforced by a court\n\nof equity against the bonds in the hands of [Mrs.] Brown or against third persons\n\nwho are volunteers or have notice.” 165 U.S. at 664, 17 S. Ct. at 457 (emphasis\n\nadded). The Supreme Court’s discussion of available equitable relief turned on the\n\ncurrent location and possession of the bonds. See also Ketchum v. St. Louis, 101\n\nU.S. 306, 318 (1879) (“With that [equitable] lien the property itself was chargeable\n\nby whomsoever it or the funds accruing therefrom are or may be held.”).\n                                          25\n\f             Case: 13-11738      Date Filed: 09/23/2014   Page: 26 of 39\n\n\n      More recent cases also support the expectation that a defendant must still be\n\nin possession of the property subject to the lien to allow equitable recovery under\n\n29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(3)(B). The Supreme Court denied reimbursement in Knudson\n\nbecause the insurance company was not seeking to recover “particular funds or\n\nproperty in the defendant’s possession.” 534 U.S. at 213, 122 S. Ct. at 714. The\n\ncompany sued Ms. Knudson, the beneficiary, instead of the trustee in charge of the\n\nSpecial Needs Trust where the money was held pursuant to California law.\n\nBecause Ms. Knudson did not have the funds in her possession, the Court observed\n\nthat the plaintiff’s claim was “not that respondents hold particular funds that, in\n\ngood conscience, belong to petitioners, but that petitioners are contractually\n\nentitled to some funds for benefits that they conferred.” Id. at 214, 122 S. Ct. at\n\n715. The Court held “where ‘the property [sought to be recovered] or its proceeds\n\nhave been dissipated so that no product remains, [the plaintiff’s] claim is only that\n\nof a general creditor,’ and the plaintiff ‘cannot enforce a constructive trust of or an\n\nequitable lien upon other property of the [defendant].’” Id. at 213, 122 S. Ct. at\n\n714 (alteration in original) (quoting Restatement of Restitution § 215, cmt. a, at\n\n867); see also Restatement of Restitution § 215 cmt. b (“A person whose property\n\nis wrongfully taken by another is not entitled to priority over other creditors unless\n\nhe proves that the wrongdoer not only once had the property or its proceeds, but\n\n                                          26\n\f             Case: 13-11738      Date Filed: 09/23/2014    Page: 27 of 39\n\n\nstill has the property or its proceeds or property in which the claimant’s property or\n\nits proceeds have been mingled indistinguishably.”).\n\n      In Sereboff , the Supreme Court noted that the “impediment to\n\ncharacterizing the relief in Knudson as equitable” was not present. Id. at 362, 126\n\nS. Ct. at 1874. That is because, in contrast to Knudson, the plan administrator in\n\nSereboff sought “particular funds or property in the defendant’s possession,”\n\nKnudson, 534 U.S. at 214, 122 S. Ct. at 708, where the identified fund was\n\n“preserved [in the Sereboffs’] investment accounts.” Sereboff, 547 U.S. at 362–\n\n63, 126 S. Ct. at 1874 (alteration in original) (quoting Mid Atl. Med. Servs., LLC\n\nv. Sereboff, 407 F.3d 212, 214 (4th Cir. 2005), aff’d sub nom. Sereboff v. Mid Atl.\n\nMed. Servs., Inc., 547 U.S. 356, 126 S. Ct. 1869 (2006)).\n\n      This Court and other Circuit Courts have followed the Supreme Court’s\n\nguidance that a defendant’s current possession of the funds at issue is a necessary\n\nelement of an equitable claim. See, e.g., Popowski v. Parrott, 461 F.3d 1367, 1373\n\n(11th Cir. 2006) (“Unlike in Knudson, a significant portion of the funds specified\n\nwent directly into the [insureds’] bank account and, thereby, was in their\n\npossession for purposes of this case.

In disagreeing with a case cited\n\nfavorably by the majority, the Solicitor General of the United States also concluded\n\nthat a plaintiff must establish the defendant’s possession of the disputed funds to\n\nrecover under this provision. See Brief for the United States as Amicus Curiae at\n\n                                           28\n\f             Case: 13-11738     Date Filed: 09/23/2014    Page: 29 of 39\n\n\n9, Thurber v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., et al., ___ U.S. ___, 134 S. Ct. 2723 (2014) (No.\n\n13-130), 2014 WL 1783200 at *9 (“In the government’s view, the court of appeals\n\nin this case erred in concluding that a plan fiduciary can enforce an equitable lien\n\nregardless of whether the funds at issue have been dissipated.”).\n\n         B. AIRTRAN DID NOT ESTABLISH THAT DEFENDANTS HAVE\n                  POSSESSION OF THE SETTLEMENT FUNDS.\n\n      As soon as the settlement funds were transferred to the benefit of Ms. Elem,\n\nAirTran “could follow [those funds] into the hands” of the defendants. Panel Op.\n\nat 8 (quoting Barnes v. Alexander, 232 U.S. 117, 123, 34 S. Ct. 276, 278 (1914)).\n\nOnce AirTran established who had the funds, its recovery against the person\n\nholding the funds would rightfully be classified as “equitable” according to\n\nSupreme Court and common law precedent. Yet what AirTran is entitled to do in\n\nequity, and what it actually did here, are very different things.\n\n      AirTran’s complaint alleges “[u]pon information and belief, portion(s) of the\n\nfunds to which the Plan is entitled are in the possession of Defendant Elem,\n\nDefendant Link and/or the Defendant Firm.” AirTran’s statement of material facts\n\nsubmitted in connection with its motion for summary judgment fails to offer any\n\nsupport for the allegation about possession made in its complaint. Though AirTran\n\nhad ample opportunity in discovery to inquire about the exact location of the\n\ndistributed settlement money, it did not. Neither did AirTran ask the District Court\n                                          29\n\f             Case: 13-11738     Date Filed: 09/23/2014   Page: 30 of 39\n\n\nfor a restraining order or injunction to make sure that the funds were easy to\n\nidentify once the case was resolved, as had happened in other reimbursement\n\ncases. See, e.g., Sereboff, 547 U.S. at 360, 126 S. Ct. at 1873 (noting that the\n\nSereboffs agreed to preserve the disputed funds in an investment account until the\n\nsuit was resolved); Popowski, 461 F.3d at 1370 (“[T]hey filed this suit along with a\n\nmotion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to protect the\n\nsettlement proceeds.”). In its argument here, AirTran says that the “settlement\n\nfunds could be followed into the hands of Elem, Link, and Link & Smith, P.C.,”\n\nbut it does not point to the money’s current location. AirTran suggests that\n\ndefendants engaged in “chicanery” by “concealing and then quickly ‘spend[ing] all\n\nmoney received,’” but points to nothing in the record to support that proposition.\n\n        C. SEREBOFF’S LIMITATION ON “STRICT TRACING” DOES NOT\n                            IMPACT THIS CASE.\n\n      The majority forgives AirTran’s failure to show defendants’ possession of\n\nthe settlement funds by stating that disbursal or commingling of the settlement\n\nfunds is irrelevant to whether the claim is properly characterized as equitable. Ms.\n\nElem, Mr. Link, and Link & Smith challenged the District Court’s grant of\n\nsummary judgment in part because AirTran did not establish that the funds it\n\nrequested were still in the possession of any defendant. The majority says,\n\nmistakenly I believe, that the defendants’ challenge is one “on the ground that\n                                         30\n\f             Case: 13-11738     Date Filed: 09/23/2014    Page: 31 of 39\n\n\nAirTran failed to satisfy the strict tracing rules of equitable restitution.” Panel Op.\n\nat 2. The majority then relies on Sereboff to reject this appeal. 547 U.S. at 364,\n\n126 S. Ct. at 1875 (discussing the “strict tracing rules” that applied to equitable\n\nrestitution at common law). But I do not read Sereboff in the same way as the\n\nmajority.\n\n      In Sereboff, the beneficiaries of an ERISA-covered health insurance plan\n\nreceived payment from the plan to cover medical expenses resulting from a car\n\naccident. The Sereboffs later settled a lawsuit they had filed regarding the car\n\naccident, and the terms of the plan called for the money paid in settlement to go to\n\nreimburse the administrator. The Sereboffs argued that recovery of settlement\n\nfunds paid by a third party—and not directly from the plan—was not “equitable\n\nrelief” under 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(3)(B) because “[t]he money in [the\n\nbeneficiaries’] investment account cannot be traced to [the plan administrator].”\n\nRespondent Reply Brief at 9, Sereboff, 547 U.S. 356, 126 S. Ct. 1869 (No. 05-\n\n260), 2006 WL 717048 at *9. The Supreme Court rejected the Sereboffs’\n\nargument because “no tracing requirement of the sort asserted by the Sereboffs\n\napplies to equitable liens by agreement or assignment.” Sereboff, 547 U.S. at 365,\n\n126 S. Ct. at 1875. In support of its position, the Court turned to “case law from\n\nthe days of the divided bench”—meaning cases heard during the period when the\n\n                                          31\n\f             Case: 13-11738      Date Filed: 09/23/2014   Page: 32 of 39\n\n\nUnited States had two parallel courts, one of equity and one of law—which did not\n\nrequire the holder of an equitable lien by agreement to trace the res directly from\n\nthe defendant back to the plaintiff. Id. at 363–64, 126 S. Ct. at 1874–75\n\n(discussing Barnes, 232 U.S. at 199–23, 34 S. Ct. at 277–78).\n\n      In its discussion of strict tracing, the Supreme Court made a distinction\n\nbetween equitable liens sought as a matter of restitution and equitable liens by\n\nagreement. For equitable liens sought as a matter of restitution, strict tracing is\n\nrequired, but for equitable liens by agreement, it is not. Sereboff, 547 U.S. at 364–\n\n65, 126 S. Ct. at 1875–76. Further, the Court cabined its discussion of strict\n\ntracing to the type of tracing requirement “asserted by the Sereboffs.” Id. at 365,\n\n126 S. Ct. at 1875. As described above, the Sereboffs argued that equitable tracing\n\nrequired the plaintiff to trace the defendant’s funds back to the plaintiff himself,\n\nand not to a third party. The Supreme Court rejected this argument, and held that\n\nequitable relief was still available where the plaintiff could not “identify an asset\n\nthey originally possessed, which was improperly acquired and converted into\n\nproperty the defendant held.” Id. (emphasis added). Later, this Court interpreted\n\nSereboff’s tracing language to eliminate only the requirement that disputed funds\n\noriginate with the plaintiff. See Admin. Comm. for Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Assocs.’\n\nHealth & Welfare Plan v. Horton, 513 F.3d 1223, 1227 n.3 (11th Cir. 2008)\n\n                                          32\n\f             Case: 13-11738     Date Filed: 09/23/2014    Page: 33 of 39\n\n\n(“[T]he Sereboff Court explained that strict tracing rules need not apply for an\n\nequitable lien to properly attach to the settlement funds; that is, although the\n\ndisputed funds had never actually been in the possession of the plan, the plan could\n\nseek to ‘recover’ property that belonged to it in good conscience under the plan\n\nagreement.” (emphasis added)).\n\n      The majority relies on what I believe is a misapplication of Sereboff,\n\naccepted by some of our sister circuits, to characterize the recovery of assets no\n\nlonger in the defendant’s possession as equitable relief. See, e.g., Cusson v.\n\nLiberty Life Assurance Co. of Boston, 592 F.3d 215, 231 (1st Cir. 2010)\n\n(determining that an insurer need not identify a “specific account in which the\n\nfunds are kept or prove[] that they are still in [the defendant’s] possession”). I do\n\nnot accept this interpretation because the defendants in Sereboff were still in\n\npossession of the funds—the Sereboff parties had stipulated that the funds were\n\nsecurely set aside in an investment account. See Sereboff, 547 U.S. at 360, 126 S.\n\nCt. at 1873. So in Sereboff the Supreme Court was never asked to decide whether\n\na defendant’s possession at the time of the suit was necessary for an action in\n\nequity.\n\n\n\n\n                                          33\n\f             Case: 13-11738      Date Filed: 09/23/2014    Page: 34 of 39\n\n\n              D. EQUITABLE RELIEF IS NOT AVAILABLE AGAINST\n              DEFENDANTS WHO DO NOT HAVE POSSESSION OF THE\n                            DISPUTED PROPERTY.\n\n      If the settlement had instead been issued to Ms. Elem in the form of a luxury\n\nautomobile, AirTran could exercise its equitable lien only by locating the\n\nautomobile or the proceeds of the sale of the automobile and suing the person who\n\nhad possession. It would make no sense to sue in equity to recover a car from\n\nsomeone who does not have it. And, the result is the same when a plaintiff brings\n\na claim for “other equitable relief” without establishing who is in possession. At\n\ncore, a plaintiff’s ability to seek equitable relief over a res cannot be separated\n\nfrom the ongoing existence and location of that res or its proceeds. More to the\n\npoint, we, as a court sitting in equity, cannot reverse engineer what happened to the\n\nplaintiff’s property by assuming that one or more of the named defendants now has\n\nit. Yet, that is what the majority does here.\n\n      The District Court’s grant of summary judgment entitled AirTran to recover\n\nthe $131,704.28 it paid for Ms. Elem’s medical expenses. The District Court later\n\nclarified that its “[j]udgment requires reimbursement of AirTran by all Defendants\n\n. . . because all three possess settlement funds that belong ‘in good conscience’ to\n\nthe Plan.’” The majority opinion repeats this idea that the funds AirTran seeks to\n\nrecover are “in ‘the possession and control’ of Elem and Link.” Panel Op. at 8.\n\n                                           34\n\f             Case: 13-11738     Date Filed: 09/23/2014    Page: 35 of 39\n\n\nBut nothing in the record supports either conclusion. To the contrary, only Ms.\n\nElem and Link & Smith received distributions from the settlement amount, and\n\nAirTran made no assertions about whether the money remained in their possession\n\nwhen it filed its motion for summary judgment. The record before us simply tells\n\nus nothing about where the money is. It could be disbursed, it could be\n\ncommingled, or it could be tucked under Ms. Elem’s mattress. By the District\n\nCourt’s order, Mr. Link is liable in equity for a res that he does not possess.\n\nWhatever retribution is appropriate for Mr. Link’s “sin[s],” Panel Op. at 2, it\n\ncannot lie in equity. If Ms. Elem and Link & Smith no longer have the funds, they\n\ncontinue to be subject to legal claims, but the equitable claim has dissipated.\n\nAirTran’s claims simply fall outside the relief permitted by 29 U.S.C. §\n\n1132(a)(3)(B).\n\nII.   THE DISTRICT COURT IMPROPERLY GRANTED ATTORNEY’S\n                        FEES AND COSTS.\n\n      The defendants also challenge the District Court’s grant of attorney’s fees\n\nand costs. Under 29 U.S.C. § 1132(g), attorney’s fees may be awarded at the\n\nCourt’s discretion to a party who achieves “some success on the merits.” Hardt v.\n\nReliance Standard Life Ins. Co., 560 U.S. 242, 255, 130 S. Ct. 2149, 2158 (2010).\n\nBecause I view summary judgment as having been improperly granted in favor of\n\nAirTran, the District Court’s related award of attorney’s fees and costs should also\n                                          35\n\f              Case: 13-11738     Date Filed: 09/23/2014    Page: 36 of 39\n\n\nbe vacated. See Ogden v. Blue Bell Creameries U.S.A., Inc., 348 F.3d 1284, 1288\n\n(11th Cir. 2003) (vacating award of attorney’s fees after holding that the District\n\nCourt improperly awarded equitable relief under ERISA).\n\nIII.    DEFENDANTS’ APPEAL OF THE DISTRICT COURT’S RULE 70\n       ORDER IS NOT MOOT AND THE RULE 70 ORDER WAS GRANTED\n                TO ENFORCE AN INCORRECT JUDGMENT.\n   Finally, I turn to the defendants’ appeal of the District Court’s Rule 70 order\n\nenforcing judgment. The majority opinion dismisses the appeal as moot because\n\ndefendants paid the required amount to AirTran, eliminating any “case or\n\ncontroversy about the merits of the Rule 70 order.” Panel Op. at 21. I disagree\n\nwith this holding on both factual and legal bases.\n\n        The defendants’ payment to AirTran was conditioned in part on the outcome\n\nof the Rule 70 order appeal. The majority opinion highlights a purported\n\nstipulation by both parties at oral argument that the payments were subject to “the\n\ndisposition of the appeal of the summary judgment and the award of attorney’s fees\n\nand costs.” Id. at 6. I heard no such stipulation at oral argument. AirTran’s\n\ncounsel admitted that the payment “was subjectively conditioned on repayment if\n\nthere was a final ruling in favor of [defendants],” Oral Arg. Recording at 13:36\n\n(Feb. 28, 2014), while counsel for defendants stated that the money was “turned\n\nover to other side to hold in trust” and that if “we win, we get it [back],” id. at\n\n\n                                           36\n\f             Case: 13-11738     Date Filed: 09/23/2014   Page: 37 of 39\n\n\n00:52, 01:09. At no point did the parties mention that conditional repayment was\n\ntied only to the appeal challenging summary judgment and award of attorney’s fees\n\nand costs. This matters because defendants had two separate appeals before us:\n\none challenging the summary judgment grant and award of attorney’s fees and\n\ncosts, Case No. 13-11738-BB, and the other challenging the Rule 70 order, Case\n\nNo. 13-14912-BB. Everything I see indicates to me that defendants’ payment was\n\nconditioned on the outcome of both appeals. For example, in their response to\n\nAirTran’s motion for contempt, Mr. Link and Link & Smith state that they “are\n\npaying the amounts claimed under protest and threat of civil and/or criminal\n\ncontempt while the appeal of both Orders are pending in the 11th Circuit.”\n\nWithout explicit documentation or statements to the contrary, I see no basis for\n\nputting limitations on the defendants’ conditional payment in our evaluation of\n\nmootness.\n\n      I do not read our prior case law to comport with the majority’s analysis.\n\nWhile “payment of a judgment and an acknowledgement of satisfaction will moot\n\nan appeal from the judgment,” RES-GA Cobblestone, LLC v. Blake Const. and\n\nDev., LLC (Cobblestone), 718 F.3d 1308, 1315 (11th Cir. 2013), it is also true that\n\n“what matters is whether the parties’ actions objectively manifest an intent to\n\nabandon the issues on appeal.” Id. at 1315. In Cobblestone, we observed that the\n\n                                         37\n\f             Case: 13-11738     Date Filed: 09/23/2014   Page: 38 of 39\n\n\nappellant “never purported to reserve the right to continue to pursue [the] appeal,”\n\ndid not intend to “claw back the costs and fees he paid,” and signed a consent\n\nagreement settling the suit to determine that the appeal was mooted. Id. at 1315–\n\n16; see also Fidelcor Mortg. Corp. v. Ins. Co. of N. Am., 820 F.2d 367, 370 (11th\n\nCir. 1987) (mooting appeal where appellant made “no reservation allowing [him]\n\nto proceed with an appeal”); cf. Alvarez-Perez v. Sanford-Orlando Kennel Club,\n\nInc., 518 F.3d 1302, 1305–08 (11th Cir. 2008) (declining to dismiss an appeal as\n\nmoot where the parties “acted in all respects as though the appeal and cross-appeal\n\nwere alive and that they were awaiting a decision” and “continued to litigate the\n\ncase in this Court as though nothing had changed”); Ass’n for Disabled Ams., Inc.\n\nv. Integra Resort Mgmt., Inc., 387 F.3d 1241, 1243 (11th Cir. 2004) (holding that\n\nan appeal was not moot where appellants “specifically reserved their right to\n\nappeal” and there was no “evidence of some intent to end the litigation”). Like the\n\nappellants in Alvarez-Perez, here the defendants’ “actions speak loudly enough to\n\ndrown out” any indication that they regarded the conditional payment to terminate\n\neither of their appeals. 518 F.3d at 1307. Both parties briefed the Rule 70 order\n\nappeal after the payment was made to AirTran, and neither brief claimed mootness.\n\nThe majority offers no evidence that the parties “objectively manifest[ed] an intent\n\nto abandon the issues” as is necessary by this Court’s precedent.\n\n                                         38\n\f             Case: 13-11738    Date Filed: 09/23/2014   Page: 39 of 39\n\n\n      The defendants’ counsel made a statement at oral argument, only part of\n\nwhich is quoted by the majority to oppose the position I have taken here. See\n\nPanel Op. at 21. Though the attorney for Ms. Elem, Mr. Link and his law firm did\n\nsay there was “perhaps not” a current injury resulting from that order, he went on\n\nto explain “but it could cause injury in the future such as having to come back up\n\nhere again and fight that issue.” Oral Arg. Recording at 02:58–03:06 (Feb. 28,\n\n2014). Even accepting that counsel did not fully explain his clients’ ongoing\n\ninjury at that moment in the oral argument, the fact remains that, much like a\n\nsupersedeas bond, defendants have an ongoing injury in the form of their\n\nconditional payment suspended in escrow.\n\n      The Rule 70 order appeal is not mooted by defendants’ conditional payment\n\nmade under threat of contempt. The District Court’s grant of summary judgment\n\nimproperly awarded non-equitable relief to AirTran in violation of 29 U.S.C. §\n\n1132(a)(3)(B), thus an order enforcing that judgment cannot stand. Both the grant\n\nof summary judgment and the Rule 70 order should be vacated.\n\n      For these reasons I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                                         39\n\f",

Elem and Link also complain that the district court misapplied Federal Rule\n\nof Civil Procedure 70 when the court ordered enforcement of the judgment, but\n\nthat issue became moot when Link and his law firm complied with the order. We\n\naffirm the summary judgment and award of fees and costs and dismiss as moot the\n\nappeal of the order to enforce the judgment.\n\n                                 I. BACKGROUND\n\n      In 2007, Brenda Elem sustained injuries in a car accident. Her employer,\n\nAirTran, paid $131,704.28 for her medical care as a result of her participation in its\n\nself-funded employee welfare benefit plan. The plan designated Elem as a\n\nconstructive trustee over any payments recovered from third parties and created an\n\nequitable lien for the amount of benefits paid by the plan. Under the plan, when\n\nElem accepted her medical benefits from AirTran, she acknowledged that AirTran\n\nhad a first priority claim to all payments made by a third party, even if that third\n\nparty failed to pay the full amount of her damages. Months after the accident, the\n\nplan administrator advised Elem that, if she sued the driver of the other vehicle,\n\nMigel Rizo, the terms of the plan required Elem to reimburse AirTran with\n\nproceeds from that suit. And the plan administrator also advised Rizo’s insurer,\n\nAIG, of that right to reimbursement.\n\n\n\n                                           3\n\f              Case: 13-11738    Date Filed: 09/23/2014    Page: 4 of 39\n\n\n      In September 2007, when Elem contacted AIG to settle the claim against\n\nRizo within his liability policy limits of $25,000, she misrepresented that the plan\n\nwould have no lien against any funds she would recover from AIG. [Id.] She also\n\nstated that she intended to sue Rizo for the full amount of her damages if AIG\n\nrefused to pay the $25,000. AIG responded that Rizo’s policy limit was $25,000\n\nand that it would be willing to issue a settlement check for that amount to Elem if\n\nher plan “waive[d] their subrogation lien” or to Elem and the plan if the plan did\n\nnot waive the lien.\n\n      Elem hired Mark Link of Link & Smith, P.C., as her attorney and sued Rizo\n\nfor the injuries she sustained in the accident. AIG advised Link that it had offered\n\n$25,000 to Elem, but that AIG had notice of a lien and a duty to protect its insured.\n\nIn December 2007, the plan administrator for AirTran notified Link of the lien in\n\nfavor of AirTran.\n\n      Rizo and Elem later settled their lawsuit for $500,000. During the\n\nnegotiation of their settlement agreement, Link asked AIG to prepare two releases:\n\none reflecting payment of the policy limit of $25,000 and another for $475,000 in\n\nsettlement of Rizo’s claim of bad faith. Link also requested two separate checks\n\nand demanded that the $25,000 release not mention Rizo’s release of his claim of\n\n\n\n                                          4\n\f             Case: 13-11738     Date Filed: 09/23/2014   Page: 5 of 39\n\n\nbad faith. AIG responded that “it seems deceptive” to omit Rizo’s release of his\n\nclaim, but Link got his way.\n\n      Elem executed a release in favor of AIG for $25,000 and another release for\n\n$475,000 signed also by Rizo. AIG issued two separate settlement checks to Elem,\n\nLink, and Link & Smith, one for $25,000 and another for $475,000. Elem later\n\nreceived $274,184.08; Link & Smith retained $190,000.00 for attorney’s fees and\n\n$10,815.92 for expenses; and Link & Smith kept the remaining funds of $4,500.00\n\nin an escrow account.\n\n      When Link informed the plan administrator about the settlement, he stated\n\nthat Elem had settled her claim against Rizo for the policy limit of $25,000 and\n\n“has abandoned any hope of recovering” more than that amount. Although Link\n\nintended to enclose a copy of the $25,000 check as proof of that settlement, he\n\ninadvertently enclosed a copy of the $475,000 check. The plan administrator\n\nnoticed the error and demanded reimbursement from “[a]ll [s]ettlements and\n\n[j]udgments.”\n\n      When Elem refused to reimburse the plan, AirTran filed suit against Elem,\n\nLink, and Link & Smith. The parties filed cross motions for summary judgment,\n\nand the district court granted summary judgment in favor of AirTran. The court\n\n\n\n                                         5\n\f              Case: 13-11738    Date Filed: 09/23/2014    Page: 6 of 39\n\n\nthen awarded AirTran attorney’s fees in the amount of $145,723.28 and costs in\n\nthe amount of $3,692.52.\n\n      When Link still refused to pay, AirTran filed a motion to enforce the\n\njudgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 70. Elem and Link responded that\n\nRule 70 was inapplicable because the judgment against them was for money\n\ndamages enforceable only through a writ of execution. The district court granted\n\nthe motion and ordered Elem and Link to satisfy the full amount of the judgment or\n\npost a bond. AirTran later moved to hold Elem and Link in contempt when they\n\nrefused to comply with the order, but AirTran withdrew the motion when Link and\n\nLink & Smith eventually paid the full amount of the judgment and attorney’s fees\n\nand costs. At oral argument, the parties stipulated that Link and his firm\n\nconditioned this payment on the disposition of the appeal of the summary\n\njudgment and the award of attorney’s fees and costs.\n\n                         II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n\n      Two standards of review govern us. First, we review de novo a summary\n\njudgment and draw all inferences and review all evidence in the light most\n\nfavorable to the nonmoving party. Hamilton v. Southland Christian Sch., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"800017\"><a href=\"/opinion/800017/hamilton-v-southland-christian-school-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">680</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1316</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1318 (11th Cir. 2012). Summary judgment should be granted only\n\nwhen the movant establishes that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that\n\n                                          6\n\f              Case: 13-11738     Date Filed: 09/23/2014    Page: 7 of 39\n\n\nthe movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Id. We also review the\n\nmootness of an appeal de novo. Tanner Adver. Grp., L.L.C. v. Fayette Cnty., Ga.,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"77371\"><a href=\"/opinion/77371/tanner-advertising-group-v-fayette-county-ga/\"><span class=\"volume\">451</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">777</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 784 (11th Cir. 2006).

DISCUSSION\n\n      Elem and Link contest the summary judgment in favor of AirTran, the award\n\nof fees and costs, and the issuance of the Rule 70 order to enforce the judgment,\n\nbut their arguments fail. We discuss each order of the district court in turn.\n\nA. The District Court Correctly Granted Summary Judgment in Favor of AirTran.\n\n      We divide this section in two parts. We first discuss Elem and Link’s\n\nchallenge to the summary judgment in favor of AirTran on the ground that AirTran\n\nfailed to seek equitable relief. We second discuss Elem and Link’s attempts to\n\navoid liability based on four technicalities, none of which justify the breach of their\n\nfiduciary duty.\n\n                    1. AirTran seeks appropriate equitable redress.\n\n      The Act permits AirTran to file a civil action “to obtain . . . appropriate\n\nequitable relief . . . to redress” the misdeeds of Elem, Link, and Link & Smith. 29\n\nU.S.C. § 1132(a)(3) (B). “[A]ppropriate equitable relief” includes only “those\n\n                                           7\n\f              Case: 13-11738    Date Filed: 09/23/2014    Page: 8 of 39\n\n\ncategories of relief that were typically available in equity,” Great-West Life &\n\nAnnuity Ins. Co. v. Knudson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118471\"><a href=\"/opinion/118471/great-west-life-annuity-ins-co-v-knudson/\"><span class=\"volume\">534</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">204</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 210, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118471\"><a href=\"/opinion/118471/great-west-life-annuity-ins-co-v-knudson/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">708</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 712 (2002). Elem\n\nand Link argue that AirTran cannot recover Elem’s medical costs because AirTran\n\nseeks money damages, a legal remedy, but AirTran contends that the plan created\n\nan equitable lien by agreement over the settlement funds. AirTran argues that it\n\nseeks to recover “specifically identifiable funds” in “the possession and control” of\n\nElem and Link, that the plan created an equitable lien by agreement, and that its\n\nclaim, therefore, falls within “appropriate equitable relief” allowed under the Act.\n\nSereboff, 547 U.S. at 362–63, 126 S. Ct. at 1874 (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).\n\n      This case sounds in equity. When AirTran filed suit against Elem and Link,\n\nit did so to enforce the equitable lien by agreement created by the plan. In “the\n\ndays of the divided bench,” this suit would have been equitable in nature. See id. at\n\n363–65, 126 S. Ct. at 1874–76. Like the plan in Sereboff, the unambiguous terms\n\nof the AirTran plan created an equitable lien against any settlement funds that\n\nElem received as a result of her accident. As soon as AIG gave Elem the settlement\n\nfunds, AirTran “could follow it into the hands of [Elem and Link].” Barnes v.\n\nAlexander, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"98064\"><a href=\"/opinion/98064/barnes-v-alexander/\"><span class=\"volume\">232</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">117</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 123, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"98064\"><a href=\"/opinion/98064/barnes-v-alexander/\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">276</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 278 (1914).\n\n\n\n                                          8\n\f              Case: 13-11738     Date Filed: 09/23/2014   Page: 9 of 39\n\n\n      We must also ensure that the nature of the remedy AirTran seeks is\n\nequitable. Compare Sereboff, 547 U.S. at 361–63, 126 S. Ct. at 1873–74, with\n\nKnudson, 534 U.S. at 212–14, 122 S. Ct. at 714–15. Elem and Link are correct that\n\nthe remedy of money damages is quintessentially a remedy at law. For that reason,\n\na plan may not file suit against a beneficiary for reimbursement and seek recovery\n\nfrom “assets generally” of that beneficiary, because that suit would seek legal, not\n\nequitable, restitution. Sereboff, 547 U.S. at 363, 126 S. Ct. at 1874 (distinguishing\n\nKnudson). But when a plan seeks “specifically identifiable funds” in “the\n\npossession and control” of a beneficiary, such restitution of the funds is equitable\n\nin nature. Id. at 362–63, 126 S. Ct. at 1874 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n      AirTran seeks an equitable remedy. AirTran filed suit to enforce its\n\nequitable lien over “specifically identifiable funds” that Elem had in her\n\n“possession.” See Sereboff, 547 U.S. at 362–63, 126 S. Ct. at 1874 (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted). According to the plain terms of the plan, the settlement\n\nthat AIG paid to Elem constitutes the specifically identifiable funds over which\n\nAirTran had a lien. Elem and Link attempt to liken those settlement funds to the\n\nfunds in Knudson, but, unlike the beneficiary in Knudson, Elem possessed the\n\nfunds. Id. (distinguishing Knudson on the ground that the beneficiary never\n\npossessed the settlement fund); see also Thurber v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">712</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n                                          <span class=\"page\">9</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\f             Case: 13-11738     Date Filed: 09/23/2014    Page: 10 of 39\n\n\n654, 664 (2d Cir. 2013) (“[A]ll that matters is that the beneficiary did, at some\n\npoint, have possession and control of the specific portion of the particular fund\n\nsought by the insurer.”). Once she possessed those funds, the equitable lien by\n\nagreement attached to them, making them “specifically identifiable.” Sereboff, 547\n\nU.S. at 362–63, 126 S. Ct. at 1874.\n\n      We disagree with our dissenting colleague, who adopts the position of the\n\nNinth Circuit and concludes that AirTran cannot collect what it is owed because it\n\nhas not traced the settlement funds after Elem divided them with her attorney.\n\n(Dissenting Op. at 30–33). See Bilyeu v. Morgan Stanley Long Term Disability\n\nPlan, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">683</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1083</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1095 (9th Cir. 2012) (“Nothing in Sereboff suggests that a\n\nfiduciary can enforce an equitable lien against a beneficiary’s general assets when\n\nspecifically identified funds are no longer in a beneficiary’s possession.”). It\n\nmatters not whether the settlement funds have since been disbursed or commingled\n\nwith other funds. In Sereboff, the Supreme Court made clear that AirTran need not\n\ntrace the settlement fund back to AirTran to enforce its equitable lien by\n\nagreement. Id. at 364–65, 126 S. Ct. at 1875–76. As soon as the settlement fund\n\nwas identified, the plan imposed an equitable lien over that fund even though it\n\nwas in the hands of the beneficiaries. Id. at 363–64, 126 S. Ct. at 1875. And in the\n\nwake of Sereboff, our sister circuits have concluded that “[p]roperty to which the\n\n                                          10\n\f              Case: 13-11738     Date Filed: 09/23/2014    Page: 11 of 39\n\n\nlien attached may be converted into other property without affecting the efficacy of\n\nthe lien.” Funk v.

We join those circuit courts and\n\nconclude that, even though Elem willfully refused to abide by the terms of the\n\nAirTran plan, her dereliction as a constructive trustee could not destroy the lien\n\nthat attached before Elem divided the funds with her attorney. See Barnes, 232\n\nU.S. at 122, 34 S. Ct. at 278 (explaining that the lien often attaches before the\n\n                                           11\n\f             Case: 13-11738     Date Filed: 09/23/2014   Page: 12 of 39\n\n\nspecific funds exist). Elem and Link argue that AirTran may take only the\n\nremaining $4,500 of settlement funds left in the escrow account, but they\n\nmisunderstand that the plan imposed a lien for the entire $131,704.28 of medical\n\nbenefits paid, which attached when Elem obtained the settlement funds. Contrary\n\nto Elem and Link’s argument, these “specifically identifiable funds” did not\n\ndisappear when they divided the money.\n\n      By the terms of the plan, AirTran paid for Elem’s medical care and, as a\n\nresult, could enforce it the moment Elem possessed the settlement checks from\n\nAIG.

Elem and Link’s remaining arguments about the summary judgment are\n                                   meritless.\n\n      Elem and Link raise four additional arguments, none of which we find\n\npersuasive. First, Link and Link & Smith argue that AirTran cannot recover from\n\nthem as third-party attorneys. Second, Elem and Link argue that, when AIG funded\n\nthe $475,000 portion of the settlement, AIG no longer qualified as a “responsible\n\nparty” under the plan. Third, they argue that AirTran cannot force Elem to\n\nreimburse it because AirTran never disclosed to her the plan terms. Fourth, Elem\n\nseeks to avoid liability by arguing that, because the plan administrator provided\n\nhealthcare services, AirTran cannot sue to enforce its right to reimbursement. We\n\naddress each of these arguments in turn.\n\n      Link and Link & Smith argue that they are not proper defendants because\n\nAirTran cannot seek reimbursement from a third-party attorney, but that argument\n\nfails.

And Link and Link & Smith are\n\nhardly innocent parties. Link and his firm tried to hide the full amount of the\n\nsettlement agreement from AirTran. Link represented that the $25,000 would take\n\ncare of any liens on the settlement asserted by AirTran, but paid himself and his\n\nfirm $200,815.92. Even if they had not known of the first priority lien of AirTran,\n\nthey could not defeat the lien, but the record makes clear that the plan\n\nadministrator had repeatedly notified Link and Link & Smith that AirTran had an\n\nequitable lien and intended to enforce it.\n\n      Link and his firm knew that they took fees and costs subject to the lien held\n\nby AirTran, and they cannot now avoid liability by asserting that they did not agree\n\nto the terms of the plan. The lien arose before they entered into a contingency fee\n\narrangement with Elem, and Elem agreed to the terms of the plan long ago. She\n\nagreed that “[t]he Plan is not required to participate in or pay court costs or\n\nattorney fees to any attorney hired by [Elem] to pursue [Elem]’s damage claim.”\n\nThese obligations, which “precluded [Elem] from contracting away to the law firm\n\n                                             14\n\f             Case: 13-11738     Date Filed: 09/23/2014    Page: 15 of 39\n\n\nthat which [she] did not own [herself], namely, the right to all or any portion of the\n\n[sum] that rightfully belonged to the Plan,” predated her attorney-client\n\nrelationship with Link and his firm. Bombardier, 354 F.3d at 357. That Link and\n\nhis firm disregarded the first priority lien of AirTran and commingled the\n\nsettlement funds does not defeat the claim for equitable relief by AirTran because,\n\n“under Sereboff, [AirTran] was free to follow a portion of the settlement funds into\n\n[Link and Link & Smith’s] hands.” Longaberger Co., 586 F.3d at 469.\n\n      Elem and Link argue too that Elem could not have wrongfully transferred\n\nthe settlement funds because Elem never had “possession” of those funds. They\n\nexplain that AIG transferred the funds to Link and his firm. They argue that,\n\nbecause Elem never possessed the funds, her duty to reimburse AirTran was never\n\ntriggered.\n\n      Nonsense. Even if AIG wrote and delivered the checks to Link and his firm,\n\nElem “had at least constructive possession and control of the fund[s] to facilitate\n\nthe settlement.” Griffin, 723 F.3d at 529 (“Griffin’s attempt to divorce himself\n\nfrom the origin of the fund and its disposition is no more persuasive than if he had\n\ndirected the money to a close relative. . . . [H]e could not give away that which he\n\ndid not possess.”). And here, Elem likely had “actual possession” because her\n\nattorney, as her agent, received and deposited the checks.\n\n                                          15\n\f              Case: 13-11738    Date Filed: 09/23/2014    Page: 16 of 39\n\n\n        Elem and Link also argue that AirTran cannot seek reimbursement because\n\nAIG is not a “responsible party” under the terms of the plan. They argue that, when\n\nAIG paid the $475,000 check, AIG no longer qualified as a “responsible party” for\n\nthe purposes of reimbursement because AIG was no longer providing “liability\n\ncoverage” for Rizo, but this argument contravenes the plain terms of the plan.\n\n        The terms of the plan entitle AirTran to reimbursement from “any payment”\n\nfrom “any Responsible Party as a result of an injury, illness, or condition.” The\n\nplan defines “Responsible Party” as “any party actually, possibly, or potentially\n\nresponsible for making any payment to a Covered Person due to a Covered\n\nPerson’s injury, illness or condition[, which] includes the liability insurer of such\n\nparty or any insurance coverage.” Because AIG settled the lawsuit for $500,000, it\n\nmeets the definition of a “responsible party.” It matters not at all that Rizo’s policy\n\nlimits were only $25,000 because the terms of the plan allow AirTran to recover\n\n“any payment” to Elem “due to” her injury. AirTran now may seek its “specifically\n\nidentifiable” amount from the $500,000 for medical expenses paid on behalf of\n\nElem.\n\n        Elem and Link also attempt to evade liability by arguing that AirTran cannot\n\nforce Elem to reimburse AirTran because she never saw the plan documents, but\n\nElem accepted the benefits and is bound by the terms of the plan unless AirTran\n\n                                          16\n\f              Case: 13-11738     Date Filed: 09/23/2014    Page: 17 of 39\n\n\nprejudiced Elem by its failure to disclose them.

Nor can she. The plan\n\nadministrator repeatedly sent letters expressing its intent to pursue reimbursement.\n\nAnd Elem allowed AirTran to pay over $130,000 of her medical bills.

Under the terms of the plan, AirTran provided various benefit options to\n\nits employees and contracted with the plan administrator to provide various\n\nservices, including network access, subrogation, and patient management services.\n\nIn the district court, Elem relied on language in the Benefits Enrollment Guide,\n\nwhich refers to healthcare services provided by the plan administrator, but the\n\nprovision of those administrative services does not give the plan administrator the\n\nright to seek reimbursement from Elem. Instead, AirTran still paid for all expenses\n\nincurred by its participants, including Elem. We reject Elem and Link’s argument\n\nthat AirTran cannot now recover its costs because it contracted with the plan\n\nadministrator.\n\n B. The District Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion by Awarding Attorney’s Fees\n                             and Costs to AirTran.\n       A district court, “in its discretion,” may award attorney’s fees to a party, 29\n\nU.S.C. § 1132(g)(1), if that party achieved “some degree of success on the merits,”\n\nHardt v.

First, we rarely see\n\nsuch a textbook example of “bad faith.” Link intentionally attempted to deceive the\n\nplan administrator when he sent the letter stating that $25,000 represented the\n\nentire settlement amount. And he coerced AIG to draft two separate releases to\n\neffectuate his deception. Fortunately for AirTran, his scheme came crashing down\n\nwhen he sent a copy of the $475,000 check to the plan administrator. His actions\n\nno doubt evince bad faith. Second, Link and Link & Smith have already satisfied\n\nthe award, although conditionally. Third, an award of attorney’s fees in this\n\ncircumstance would help deter others from cheating their employee benefit plan.\n\nFourth, the award protects plan assets, which benefit all plan participants. And\n                                           19\n\f             Case: 13-11738     Date Filed: 09/23/2014   Page: 20 of 39\n\n\nfifth, the defense mounted by AirTran was highly meritorious. The district court\n\ndid not abuse its discretion when it awarded attorney’s fees to AirTran.\n\n C. The Payment of the Award of Fees and Costs Moots Any Argument About the\n              Entry of the Rule 70 Order by the District Court.\n\n      Elem and Link argue that the district court misinterpreted Federal Rule of\n\nCivil Procedure 70 when it ordered them to pay the full amount of the judgment\n\nand fees and costs. Rule 70 provides, “If a judgment requires a party to convey\n\nland, to deliver a deed or other document, or to perform any other specific act and\n\nthe party fails to comply within the time specified, the court may order the act to be\n\ndone—at the disobedient party’s expense—by another person appointed by the\n\ncourt.” Rule 70 “gives the district court a discrete and limited power to deal with\n\nparties who thwart final judgments by refusing to comply with orders to perform\n\nspecific acts.” Analytical Eng’g, Inc. v. Baldwin Filters, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"792108\"><a href=\"/opinion/792108/analytical-engineering-incorporated-v-baldwin-filters-incorporated/\"><span class=\"volume\">425</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">443</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 449\n\n(7th Cir. 2005). Elem and Link contend that the district court erroneously\n\nconverted a final money judgment at law into an injunction and that the judgment\n\nwas enforceable only through a writ of execution.\n\n      This issue is no longer justiciable because the appeal of the order is now\n\nmoot. Instead of posting a supersedeas bond, Link and his firm paid the full\n\namount due to AirTran to avoid being held in contempt. Even if we agreed that the\n\ndistrict court erred when it issued that order, we could not grant any meaningful\n                                         20\n\f             Case: 13-11738     Date Filed: 09/23/2014    Page: 21 of 39\n\n\nrelief because the defendants have already complied with it.

(AirTran) says that its suit seeks equitable relief, but\n\nit fails to make a critical showing for purposes of equity: that the defendants\n\nremain in possession of the disputed property. For the reasons that follow, I have\n\ncome to understand that AirTran’s suit seeks a legal remedy which is not permitted\n\nunder the statute it relies on. Based on this understanding, I would reverse the\n\nDistrict Court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of AirTran, its order awarding\n\nattorney’s fees and costs, and its later Rule 70 order enforcing the judgment.\n\n  I.   THE DISTRICT COURT IMPROPERLY GRANTED SUMMARY\n         JUDGMENT BY CLASSIFYING AIRTRAN’S CLAIMS AS\n                          EQUITABLE.\n\n       At issue is whether AirTran’s suit against Brenda Elem, her attorney Mark\n\nLink, and his law firm Link & Smith, P.C. (Link & Smith) (collectively the\n\ndefendants) to recover settlement funds subject to an equitable lien by agreement is\n\npermitted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 29\n\nU.S.C. § 1132(a)(3)(B). This statute gives courts the power to grant “other\n\nappropriate equitable relief” only when enforcing a covered insurance plan.\n\nSpecifically, a plan fiduciary may bring a civil action under ERISA “to obtain\n\nother appropriate equitable relief . . . to enforce . . . the terms of the plan.” 29\n\nU.S.C. § 1132(a)(3)(B)(ii). The Supreme Court has construed this section to\n\n                                            23\n\f              Case: 13-11738     Date Filed: 09/23/2014    Page: 24 of 39\n\n\nauthorize only “those categories of relief that were typically available in equity.”\n\nMertens v.

However, on the facts before us,\n\nthe only remedy available to AirTran is legal, not equitable, in nature.

H. Walker & Co.\n\n(Walker). That businessman, Mr. Brown, had actually pledged the bonds to\n\nWalker for the benefit of a third party. As that third party got into financial\n\ndifficulties, Mr. Brown paid its creditors the value of the bonds, retook possession\n\nof the bonds, and then gifted them to his wife before he passed away. The\n\nSupreme Court held that the lien by agreement was not extinguished when Mr.\n\nBrown bought them back, and that the “equitable lien will be enforced by a court\n\nof equity against the bonds in the hands of [Mrs.] Brown or against third persons\n\nwho are volunteers or have notice.” 165 U.S. at 664, 17 S.

The Court held “where ‘the property [sought to be recovered] or its proceeds\n\nhave been dissipated so that no product remains, [the plaintiff’s] claim is only that\n\nof a general creditor,’ and the plaintiff ‘cannot enforce a constructive trust of or an\n\nequitable lien upon other property of the [defendant].’” Id. at 213, 122 S.

Though AirTran\n\nhad ample opportunity in discovery to inquire about the exact location of the\n\ndistributed settlement money, it did not.

In its argument here, AirTran says that the “settlement\n\nfunds could be followed into the hands of Elem, Link, and Link & Smith, P.C.,”\n\nbut it does not point to the money’s current location. AirTran suggests that\n\ndefendants engaged in “chicanery” by “concealing and then quickly ‘spend[ing] all\n\nmoney received,’” but points to nothing in the record to support that proposition.\n\n        C. SEREBOFF’S LIMITATION ON “STRICT TRACING” DOES NOT\n                            IMPACT THIS CASE.\n\n      The majority forgives AirTran’s failure to show defendants’ possession of\n\nthe settlement funds by stating that disbursal or commingling of the settlement\n\nfunds is irrelevant to whether the claim is properly characterized as equitable. Ms.\n\nElem, Mr. Link, and Link & Smith challenged the District Court’s grant of\n\nsummary judgment in part because AirTran did not establish that the funds it\n\nrequested were still in the possession of any defendant. The majority says,\n\nmistakenly I believe, that the defendants’ challenge is one “on the ground that\n                                         30\n\f             Case: 13-11738     Date Filed: 09/23/2014    Page: 31 of 39\n\n\nAirTran failed to satisfy the strict tracing rules of equitable restitution.” Panel Op.\n\nat 2. The majority then relies on Sereboff to reject this appeal. 547 U.S. at 364,\n\n126 S. Ct. at 1875 (discussing the “strict tracing rules” that applied to equitable\n\nrestitution at common law). But I do not read Sereboff in the same way as the\n\nmajority.\n\n      In Sereboff, the beneficiaries of an ERISA-covered health insurance plan\n\nreceived payment from the plan to cover medical expenses resulting from a car\n\naccident. The Sereboffs later settled a lawsuit they had filed regarding the car\n\naccident, and the terms of the plan called for the money paid in settlement to go to\n\nreimburse the administrator. The Sereboffs argued that recovery of settlement\n\nfunds paid by a third party—and not directly from the plan—was not “equitable\n\nrelief” under 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(3)(B) because “[t]he money in [the\n\nbeneficiaries’] investment account cannot be traced to [the plan administrator].”\n\nRespondent Reply Brief at 9, Sereboff, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145657\"><a href=\"/opinion/145657/sereboff-v-mid-atlantic-medical-services-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">547</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">356</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145657\"><a href=\"/opinion/145657/sereboff-v-mid-atlantic-medical-services-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The Supreme Court rejected the Sereboffs’\n\nargument because “no tracing requirement of the sort asserted by the Sereboffs\n\napplies to equitable liens by agreement or assignment.” Sereboff, 547 U.S. at 365,\n\n126 S. Ct. at 1875. In support of its position, the Court turned to “case law from\n\nthe days of the divided bench”—meaning cases heard during the period when the\n\n                                          31\n\f             Case: 13-11738      Date Filed: 09/23/2014   Page: 32 of 39\n\n\nUnited States had two parallel courts, one of equity and one of law—which did not\n\nrequire the holder of an equitable lien by agreement to trace the res directly from\n\nthe defendant back to the plaintiff. Id. at 363–64, 126 S. Ct. at 1874–75\n\n(discussing Barnes, 232 U.S. at 199–23, 34 S. Ct. at 277–78).\n\n      In its discussion of strict tracing, the Supreme Court made a distinction\n\nbetween equitable liens sought as a matter of restitution and equitable liens by\n\nagreement. For equitable liens sought as a matter of restitution, strict tracing is\n\nrequired, but for equitable liens by agreement, it is not. Sereboff, 547 U.S. at 364–\n\n65, 126 S. Ct. at 1875–76. Further, the Court cabined its discussion of strict\n\ntracing to the type of tracing requirement “asserted by the Sereboffs.” Id. at 365,\n\n126 S. Ct. at 1875. As described above, the Sereboffs argued that equitable tracing\n\nrequired the plaintiff to trace the defendant’s funds back to the plaintiff himself,\n\nand not to a third party. The Supreme Court rejected this argument, and held that\n\nequitable relief was still available where the plaintiff could not “identify an asset\n\nthey originally possessed, which was improperly acquired and converted into\n\nproperty the defendant held.” Id. (emphasis added). Later, this Court interpreted\n\nSereboff’s tracing language to eliminate only the requirement that disputed funds\n\noriginate with the plaintiff. See Admin. Comm. for Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Assocs.’\n\nHealth & Welfare Plan v. Horton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"77914\"><a href=\"/opinion/77914/administrative-committee-for-wal-mart-v-horton/\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1223</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1227 n.3 (11th Cir. 2008)\n\n                                          32\n\f             Case: 13-11738     Date Filed: 09/23/2014    Page: 33 of 39\n\n\n(“[T]he Sereboff Court explained that strict tracing rules need not apply for an\n\nequitable lien to properly attach to the settlement funds; that is, although the\n\ndisputed funds had never actually been in the possession of the plan, the plan could\n\nseek to ‘recover’ property that belonged to it in good conscience under the plan\n\nagreement.” (emphasis added)).\n\n      The majority relies on what I believe is a misapplication of Sereboff,\n\naccepted by some of our sister circuits, to characterize the recovery of assets no\n\nlonger in the defendant’s possession as equitable relief. See, e.g., Cusson v.\n\nLiberty Life Assurance Co. of Boston, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"204137\"><a href=\"/opinion/204137/cusson-v-liberty-life-assur-co-of-boston/\"><span class=\"volume\">592</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">215</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 231 (1st Cir. 2010)\n\n(determining that an insurer need not identify a “specific account in which the\n\nfunds are kept or prove[] that they are still in [the defendant’s] possession”). I do\n\nnot accept this interpretation because the defendants in Sereboff were still in\n\npossession of the funds—the Sereboff parties had stipulated that the funds were\n\nsecurely set aside in an investment account. See Sereboff, 547 U.S. at 360, 126 S.\n\nCt. at 1873. So in Sereboff the Supreme Court was never asked to decide whether\n\na defendant’s possession at the time of the suit was necessary for an action in\n\nequity.\n\n\n\n\n                                          33\n\f             Case: 13-11738      Date Filed: 09/23/2014    Page: 34 of 39\n\n\n              D. EQUITABLE RELIEF IS NOT AVAILABLE AGAINST\n              DEFENDANTS WHO DO NOT HAVE POSSESSION OF THE\n                            DISPUTED PROPERTY.\n\n      If the settlement had instead been issued to Ms. Elem in the form of a luxury\n\nautomobile, AirTran could exercise its equitable lien only by locating the\n\nautomobile or the proceeds of the sale of the automobile and suing the person who\n\nhad possession. It would make no sense to sue in equity to recover a car from\n\nsomeone who does not have it. And, the result is the same when a plaintiff brings\n\na claim for “other equitable relief” without establishing who is in possession. At\n\ncore, a plaintiff’s ability to seek equitable relief over a res cannot be separated\n\nfrom the ongoing existence and location of that res or its proceeds. More to the\n\npoint, we, as a court sitting in equity, cannot reverse engineer what happened to the\n\nplaintiff’s property by assuming that one or more of the named defendants now has\n\nit. Yet, that is what the majority does here.\n\n      The District Court’s grant of summary judgment entitled AirTran to recover\n\nthe $131,704.28 it paid for Ms. Elem’s medical expenses. The District Court later\n\nclarified that its “[j]udgment requires reimbursement of AirTran by all Defendants\n\n. . . because all three possess settlement funds that belong ‘in good conscience’ to\n\nthe Plan.’” The majority opinion repeats this idea that the funds AirTran seeks to\n\nrecover are “in ‘the possession and control’ of Elem and Link.” Panel Op. at 8.\n\n                                           34\n\f             Case: 13-11738     Date Filed: 09/23/2014    Page: 35 of 39\n\n\nBut nothing in the record supports either conclusion. To the contrary, only Ms.\n\nElem and Link & Smith received distributions from the settlement amount, and\n\nAirTran made no assertions about whether the money remained in their possession\n\nwhen it filed its motion for summary judgment. The record before us simply tells\n\nus nothing about where the money is. It could be disbursed, it could be\n\ncommingled, or it could be tucked under Ms. Elem’s mattress. By the District\n\nCourt’s order, Mr. Link is liable in equity for a res that he does not possess.\n\nWhatever retribution is appropriate for Mr. Link’s “sin[s],” Panel Op. at 2, it\n\ncannot lie in equity. If Ms. Elem and Link & Smith no longer have the funds, they\n\ncontinue to be subject to legal claims, but the equitable claim has dissipated.\n\nAirTran’s claims simply fall outside the relief permitted by 29 U.S.C. §\n\n1132(a)(3)(B).\n\nII.   THE DISTRICT COURT IMPROPERLY GRANTED ATTORNEY’S\n                        FEES AND COSTS.\n\n      The defendants also challenge the District Court’s grant of attorney’s fees\n\nand costs. Under 29 U.S.C. § 1132(g), attorney’s fees may be awarded at the\n\nCourt’s discretion to a party who achieves “some success on the merits.” Hardt v.\n\nReliance Standard Life Ins.

DEFENDANTS’ APPEAL OF THE DISTRICT COURT’S RULE 70\n       ORDER IS NOT MOOT AND THE RULE 70 ORDER WAS GRANTED\n                TO ENFORCE AN INCORRECT JUDGMENT.\n   Finally, I turn to the defendants’ appeal of the District Court’s Rule 70 order\n\nenforcing judgment. The majority opinion dismisses the appeal as moot because\n\ndefendants paid the required amount to AirTran, eliminating any “case or\n\ncontroversy about the merits of the Rule 70 order.” Panel Op. at 21. I disagree\n\nwith this holding on both factual and legal bases.\n\n        The defendants’ payment to AirTran was conditioned in part on the outcome\n\nof the Rule 70 order appeal. The majority opinion highlights a purported\n\nstipulation by both parties at oral argument that the payments were subject to “the\n\ndisposition of the appeal of the summary judgment and the award of attorney’s fees\n\nand costs.” Id. at 6. I heard no such stipulation at oral argument. AirTran’s\n\ncounsel admitted that the payment “was subjectively conditioned on repayment if\n\nthere was a final ruling in favor of [defendants],” Oral Arg. Recording at 13:36\n\n(Feb. 28, 2014), while counsel for defendants stated that the money was “turned\n\nover to other side to hold in trust” and that if “we win, we get it [back],” id. at\n\n\n                                           36\n\f             Case: 13-11738     Date Filed: 09/23/2014   Page: 37 of 39\n\n\n00:52, 01:09. At no point did the parties mention that conditional repayment was\n\ntied only to the appeal challenging summary judgment and award of attorney’s fees\n\nand costs. This matters because defendants had two separate appeals before us:\n\none challenging the summary judgment grant and award of attorney’s fees and\n\ncosts, Case No. 13-11738-BB, and the other challenging the Rule 70 order, Case\n\nNo. 13-14912-BB. Everything I see indicates to me that defendants’ payment was\n\nconditioned on the outcome of both appeals. For example, in their response to\n\nAirTran’s motion for contempt, Mr. Link and Link & Smith state that they “are\n\npaying the amounts claimed under protest and threat of civil and/or criminal\n\ncontempt while the appeal of both Orders are pending in the 11th Circuit.”\n\nWithout explicit documentation or statements to the contrary, I see no basis for\n\nputting limitations on the defendants’ conditional payment in our evaluation of\n\nmootness.\n\n      I do not read our prior case law to comport with the majority’s analysis.\n\nWhile “payment of a judgment and an acknowledgement of satisfaction will moot\n\nan appeal from the judgment,” RES-GA Cobblestone, LLC v. Blake Const. and\n\nDev., LLC (Cobblestone), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">718</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1308</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1315 (11th Cir. 2013), it is also true that\n\n“what matters is whether the parties’ actions objectively manifest an intent to\n\nabandon the issues on appeal.” Id. at 1315. In Cobblestone, we observed that the\n\n                                         37\n\f             Case: 13-11738     Date Filed: 09/23/2014   Page: 38 of 39\n\n\nappellant “never purported to reserve the right to continue to pursue [the] appeal,”\n\ndid not intend to “claw back the costs and fees he paid,” and signed a consent\n\nagreement settling the suit to determine that the appeal was mooted.

Like the\n\nappellants in Alvarez-Perez, here the defendants’ “actions speak loudly enough to\n\ndrown out” any indication that they regarded the conditional payment to terminate\n\neither of their appeals. 518 F.3d at 1307. Both parties briefed the Rule 70 order\n\nappeal after the payment was made to AirTran, and neither brief claimed mootness.\n\nThe majority offers no evidence that the parties “objectively manifest[ed] an intent\n\nto abandon the issues” as is necessary by this Court’s precedent.\n\n                                         38\n\f             Case: 13-11738    Date Filed: 09/23/2014   Page: 39 of 39\n\n\n      The defendants’ counsel made a statement at oral argument, only part of\n\nwhich is quoted by the majority to oppose the position I have taken here. See\n\nPanel Op. at 21. Though the attorney for Ms. Elem, Mr. Link and his law firm did\n\nsay there was “perhaps not” a current injury resulting from that order, he went on\n\nto explain “but it could cause injury in the future such as having to come back up\n\nhere again and fight that issue.” Oral Arg. Recording at 02:58–03:06 (Feb. 28,\n\n2014). Even accepting that counsel did not fully explain his clients’ ongoing\n\ninjury at that moment in the oral argument, the fact remains that, much like a\n\nsupersedeas bond, defendants have an ongoing injury in the form of their\n\nconditional payment suspended in escrow.\n\n      The Rule 70 order appeal is not mooted by defendants’ conditional payment\n\nmade under threat of contempt. The District Court’s grant of summary judgment\n\nimproperly awarded non-equitable relief to AirTran in violation of 29 U.S.C. §\n\n1132(a)(3)(B), thus an order enforcing that judgment cannot stand. Both the grant\n\nof summary judgment and the Rule 70 order should be vacated.\n\n      For these reasons I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                                         39\n\f</pre>",
