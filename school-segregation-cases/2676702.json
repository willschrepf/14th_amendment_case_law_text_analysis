Regulatory Backdrop\n       The provision of public housing in the United States is authorized under\n42 U.S.C. § 1437 and administered by the United States Department of\nHousing and Urban Development (“HUD”). 2 HUD carries out this duty in part\nby distributing funds to local public housing authorities (“PHAs”) that, in turn,\nmanage housing projects. 3 The relationship between HUD and a PHA is\ngoverned by a standard written contract called an “annual contributions\ncontract” or “ACC.” 4 Under an ACC, HUD agrees to provide funds for housing\nassistance payments and administrative fees and in exchange the PHA “agrees\nto administer the program in accordance with HUD regulations and\nrequirements.” 5 A PHA may apply to HUD for authorization to demolish or\ndispose of a public housing project under 42 U.S.C. § 1437p. “[I]n cases where\nPHAs must demolish housing due to an emergency or natural disaster,”\nhowever, it “has been HUD’s practice, as reflected in the [standard form] ACC,”\nto allow demolition without prior authorization to ensure the health and safety\nof residents. 6 “If the PHA rebuilds less than all of the demolished structures or\nthe project, the PHA shall submit a demolition application . . . within one year\n\n\n\n       1  42 U.S.C. § 1437 et seq.\n       2  See 24 C.F.R. § 970.1 et seq.\n        3 Id. at § 982.151(a)(1).\n        4 Id.\n        5 Id.\n        6 Public Housing Program: Demolition or Disposition of Public Housing Projects, and\n\nConversion of Public Housing to Tenant-Based Assistance, 79 Fed.

The Demolition\n      The Galveston Housing Authority (“GHA”) is the PHA that manages and\nadministers public housing in Galveston County. In the wake of the storm, the\nCity of Galveston declared four public housing sites “unfit for human\noccupancy” and it ordered GHA to demolish Oleander Homes, Palm Terrace,\nMagnolia Homes, and Cedar Terrace. 8 Consistent with HUD’s practice in like\ncases, GHA sent a letter to HUD announcing its intent to demolish Oleander\nHomes and Palm Terrace without seeking prior authorization from HUD’s\nSpecial Applications Center under section 1437p. 9 Lone Star Legal Aid, a\nnonprofit legal organization, filed an administrative complaint with HUD\nopposing GHA’s demolition plan on behalf of displaced public housing tenants.\nGHA and LSLA reached a settlement of the complaint under which GHA\nagreed to provide replacement housing on a one-for-one basis for all residential\nunits destroyed by Ike and to incorporate the terms of an agreed upon\nreplacement plan. 10\n      Having satisfied LSLA’s concerns, GHA moved forward and demolished\nall four sites, including the housing units situated at the Magnolia Homes and\nCedar Terrace sites, on August 6, 2009. 11 It then submitted a formal demolition\napplication to HUD. 12 In a letter dated April 15, 2010, HUD approved GHA’s\napplication “as outlined in [an] enclosed memorandum from [HUD’s director of\n\n\n\n       7 Id. at 62,265.\n       8 R.3384-87.\n       9 R.3390, 4686-87; see 24 C.F.R. § 970.1 et seq.\n       10 R.3390-92.\n       11 R.4608.\n       12 See supra Note 6 and accompanying text (citing 79 Fed.

Procedural History\n       GHA’s effort to redevelop the Magnolia Homes and Cedar Terrace sites\nmet controversy. Individuals and the Galveston Open Government Project filed\nthis lawsuit, seeking to enjoin the plan and arguing that by proposing\nredevelopment on former public housing sites the plan would actively\nconcentrate poverty in already impoverished and racially segregated areas. 18\nThe original complaint named as defendants: the City of Galveston and GHA;\nGLO and the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs\n(collectively the “State Defendants”); and HUD and its secretary. 19\n       The second amended complaint added as an additional plaintiff\nTryshatel McCardell, an African-American resident of Galveston who lives\nnine blocks from the Cedar Terrace site. She claims injury from the\nconstruction of “public housing in [her] current neighborhood—a neighborhood\nthat is already segregated—[because it] will further add to the segregation of\nthe neighborhood—depriving her of interracial associations.” 20\n\n\n       17  Before Ike, Magnolia Homes and Cedar Terrace comprised 133 units and 136 units,\nrespectively—all 269 units were low-income public housing. The Magnolia Homes\nredevelopment would include 160 total units: 78 market rate unrestricted units; 18 project-\nbased section 8 voucher units; and 64 public housing units. The Cedar Terrace redevelopment\nwould include 121 total units: 59 market rate unrestricted units; 13 project-based section 8\nvoucher units; and 49 public housing units. R.4687; see R.2779-80. To achieve one-for-one\nreplacement of the 569 units lost, in complement to redeveloping the Magnolia Homes and\nCedar Terrace sites the master plan provides for the Texas General Land Office (“GLO”) to\ndevelop 385 public housing units at scattered sites, 50 of which may be developed outside\nGalveston city limits on the mainland of Galveston County. “GHA Reconstruction Plan,”\nGALVESTON                HOUSING              AUTHORITY,             available            at\nhttp://www.ghatx.org/dev_reconstruction.html (last visited April 1, 2015).\n        18 R.22.\n        19 Shaun Donovan was Secretary of HUD when this case was originally filed; Julian\n\nCastro later replaced Donovan at that post and was substituted for Donovan as a named\ndefendant.\n        20 R.2725-26.\n\n                                             5\n\f    Case: 14-40955        Document: 00513127196    Page: 6   Date Filed: 07/23/2015\n\n\n\n                                    No. 14-40955\n      Motions and orders ensued. In a thorough memorandum and order, the\ndistrict court dismissed for lack of standing all plaintiffs except for\nMcCardell. 21 McCardell then filed a third amended complaint, elaborating\nallegations in support of her “neighborhood standing” to challenge the plan 22\nand requesting declaratory and injunctive relief on claims under the\nconstitution, Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, and the Administrative\nProcedure Act. 23 The district court dismissed the State Defendants on\nsovereign immunity grounds, 24 dismissed the APA claim, 25 granted\nMcCardell’s motion to nonsuit the constitutional claim, 26 granted the\nremaining defendants’ joint motion for summary judgment on the Fair\nHousing Act claim, 27 and entered final judgment on August 13, 2014. 28\n      Only McCardell appeals. 29\n                                        II.\n      McCardell first challenges the district court’s dismissal of the Individual\nPlaintiffs and GOGP for lack of standing. As an initial matter, we hold that we\nlack jurisdiction to entertain these dismissals, for they did not appeal.\n      The Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure mandate that a notice of\nappeal must “specify the party or parties taking the appeal by naming each\none in the caption or body of the notice . . . [and] designate the judgment, order,\nor part thereof being appealed . . . .” 30 Failure to name a party in a notice of\nappeal constitutes a fatal defect in that it fails to confer upon our court\n\n\n      21 R.3728-63.\n      22 R.3846-47.\n      23 R.3857-60.\n      24 R.3872-74.\n      25 R.4460-63.\n      26 R.4514.\n      27 R.4685-97.\n      28 R.4698-99.\n      29 R.4700-02.\n      30 Fed.

Even assuming, without deciding, that McCardell would have\nstanding to bring such an appeal, we still would lack jurisdiction to review it.\nThe notice of appeal filed by McCardell names only McCardell as plaintiff in\nits caption and states the following in body text: “Notice is hereby given that\nTryshatel McCardell, Plaintiff in the above-named case, hereby appeals to the\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit the Final Judgment (D.E.\n148) entered in this action on the 13th day of August, 2014.” 33 The referenced\nfinal judgment names only McCardell as plaintiff and addresses only those\nclaims she alone brought in the third amended complaint. It does not mention\nthe Individual Plaintiffs or GOGP or any of the orders resulting in their\ndismissal from the suit. Although we “treat notices of appeal relatively liberally\n‘where the intent to appeal an unmentioned or mislabeled ruling is apparent\nand there is no prejudice to the adverse party,’” 34 no such intent is apparent\nhere. By specifically designating only the district court’s final judgment in her\nnotice of appeal, McCardell exhibited no intent to appeal the district court’s\ndismissal of the Individual Plaintiffs or GOGP. 35\n\n\n\n\n       31  Torres v.

Village of Bellwood, 53 the\nCourt took up the resulting challenge of scope—whether a “12- by 13-block\nresidential neighborhood” constituted a community from which residents\nenjoyed standing to challenge illegal racial steering practices. 54 Answering\nthat question affirmatively, the Court held that the inquiry is the same\nregardless whether a “community is defined in terms of city blocks [or]\napartment buildings”: standing depends on “[t]he presence of a genuine injury\nascertainable on the basis of discrete facts presented at trial.” 55 The Court held\nthat the plaintiffs had standing based on their allegations that racial steering\nhad negatively affected the racial composition of their “relatively compact\nneighborhood.” 56\n       In Havens Realty Corporation v. Coleman, 57 the Court reaffirmed its\nrecognition     of   neighborhood       standing      “based     on    the    effects   of\ndiscrimination . . . within a ‘relatively compact neighborhood.’” 58 There, two\nresidents of the Richmond, Virginia, metropolitan area alleged that a\nlandlord’s racial steering practices at an apartment complex in a Richmond\nsuburb had deprived them of “the important social, professional, business, and\neconomic, political, and aesthetic benefits of interracial associations that arise\nfrom living in integrated communities . . . .” 59 The Court, noting that it was\nimplausible to conclude that discrimination within a single housing complex\n\n\n\n       52 Id. at 209.

Serving this principle, we in\nturn have held that denying “benefits of interracial associations” and “racial\nbalance and stability” can constitute cognizable injury. 61 In Broadmoor, we\nheld “that individual residents who live[d] inside the area targeted by real\nestate brokers for racial steering” had standing to bring suit under the Fair\nHousing Act. 62\n                                            C.\n      In reviewing standing at the summary judgment stage, any “specific\nfacts . . . set forth by affidavit or other evidence . . . will be taken to be true.” 63\nThe third amended complaint alleged that McCardell “is an impoverished\nAfrican American resident” of Galveston who “currently lives approximately\nnine blocks from the proposed site of Magnolia Homes.” 64 It added the\nfollowing:\n      [McCardell’s] neighborhood is predominantly composed of racial\n      minorities, and the new tenants of the public housing units of [the\n      planned redevelopment] are estimated to be mostly racial\n      minorities.

The question remains whether Congress validly abrogated Texas’\nsovereign immunity in enacting the Fair Housing Act. McCardell cannot clear\nthe first hurdle of this inquiry. The language of the Fair Housing Act does not\nmake “unmistakably clear” that Congress intended to abrogate. It contains no\nprovision evidencing such intent. McCardell offers none, opting instead to\ndevote the whole of her briefing on this issue to the second prong: whether\nCongress passed the Fair Housing Act pursuant to a constitutionally valid\nexercise of its power. But whether Congress did so bridges beyond, as the Act\nlacks an explicit provision allowing its enforcement by private right of action\nagainst a state.\n       Its want is made the more clear, by contrast, in remedial provisions tied\nto other aspects of civil rights legislation. For example, with regard to Title VI\nof the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prevents discrimination by government\nagencies that receive federal funds, Congress provided by statute that “[a] state\nshall not be immune under the Eleventh Amendment of the Constitution of the\nUnited States from Suit in Federal court for a violation of . . . title VI of the\nCivil Rights Act of 1964 . . . .” 87 The Supreme Court has recognized that by this\nlanguage Congress “expressly abrogated States’ sovereign immunity against\nsuits brought . . . to enforce Title VI.” 88 No similar language exists in the\nprovisions of the Fair Housing Act.\n\n\n       86  Nevada Dep’t of Human Res. v.

The\nsection 1437p(d) safe harbor applies to the redevelopment of public housing on\na demolished site if (1) the demolition was carried out “in accordance with”\nsection 1437p and (2) “the number of replacement public housing units is\nsignificantly fewer than the number of units demolished.” 95 If these conditions\nare met, the safe harbor applies to preclude a Fair Housing Act claim.\nMcCardell does not contest on appeal that the number of replacement public\nhousing units in the planned redevelopment would be “significantly fewer”\nthan the number of units demolished as that standard is defined in relevant\nregulations. 96 Our inquiry is thus focused on the “in accordance with” prong.\nRelevant to this inquiry, the implementing regulations for section 1437p are\ncodified at 24 C.F.R. § 970.1 et seq. 97 Among the implementing regulations, the\n\n\n\n      91  Haverda v.

And relevant to this appeal, 24\nC.F.R. § 970.31 provides that the development of “replacement public housing\nunits . . . on the original public housing location . . . must [also] comply with\n[the provisions of] 24 [C.F.R. §] 905 . . . .”\n      The provisions of 24 C.F.R. § 905, in turn, contain general requirements\nrelated “to the development of public housing units to be included under an\nACC and which will receive funding from public housing funds.” 98 Part\n905.602(d) provides that “[e]ach proposed site . . . for construction or\nrehabilitation of public housing must be reviewed and approved by the [HUD]\nfield office as meeting [several] standards, as applicable.” 99 This language\nindicates that a reviewing court’s inquiry is limited to considering whether\nHUD reviewed and approved a proposed site as meeting each standard. It does\nnot require or permit a reviewing court to second-guess HUD’s determinations.\n      Part 905.602(d) lists eleven standards that HUD must consider with\nregard to a proposed site for construction. 100 The fifth listed standard tracks\nthe language of the section 1437p(d) safe harbor and provides that\n“[n]otwithstanding the foregoing [four standards], after demolition of public\nhousing units a PHA may construct public housing units on the original public\nhousing site or in the same neighborhood if the number of replacement public\nhousing units is significantly fewer than the number of public housing units\ndemolished.” 101 Because McCardell concedes that the planned redevelopment\n\n\n      98 24 C.F.R. § 905.600(a); see id. at § 905.602(d).\n      99 Id. at § 905.602(d) (emphasis added).\n      100 Id. at § 905.602(d)(1)-(11).\n      101 Id. at § 905.602(d)(5).

The remaining question for our purposes is whether\nHUD reviewed the proposed site for the planned redevelopment and approved\nit as meeting the standards listed at subparts (d)(6) through (d)(11). 102 The\ndistrict court, in holding that the section 1437p(d) safe harbor applied as a\nmatter of law, necessarily concluded that HUD did so and thus answered this\nquestion affirmatively.\n                                              C.\n       McCardell challenges the district court’s holding on two fronts. She first\nargues that a material fact issue remains as to whether the planned\nredevelopment complies with subpart (d)(6), 103 which requires HUD to affirm\n\n\n\n              public housing units is significantly fewer than the number of public\n              housing units demolished. One of the following criteria must be\n              satisfied:\n\n                     (i) The number of public housing units being constructed\n                     is not more than 50 percent of the number of public\n                     housing units in the original development; or\n\n                     (ii) In the case of replacing an occupied development, the\n                     number of public housing units being constructed is the\n                     number needed to house current residents who want to\n                     remain at the site, so long as the number of public\n                     housing units being constructed is significantly fewer\n                     than the number being demolished; or\n\n                     (iii) The public housing units         being   constructed\n                     constitute no more than 25 units.\n\n       102  Because McCardell does not appeal the dismissal of her APA claim challenging\nHUD’s determination that the standards listed at subparts (d)(6) through (d)(11) were\nsatisfied, we have no occasion to consider whether those standards were satisfied in actuality.\n        103 McCardell makes passing reference to subparts (d)(7) through (d)(11) in briefing,\n\nbut she offers no basis on which this court could conclude that summary judgment as to those\nsubparts was improper. Nor do we find any basis in the record. The record indicates that the\ndemolition and planned redevelopment complied with subparts (d)(7) through (d)(11).\n                                             21\n\f    Case: 14-40955       Document: 00513127196          Page: 22     Date Filed: 07/23/2015\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-40955\nthat “[t]he site shall promote greater choice of housing opportunities and avoid\nundue concentration of assisted persons in areas containing a high proportion\nof low-income persons.” We disagree. The record leaves no doubt that this\nrequirement was met. After demolishing the Magnolia Homes and Cedar\nTerrace sites, GHA applied to HUD for formal approval of the demolition and\nthe planned redevelopment. In its letter of approval, HUD explicitly considered\nthe requirements set forth in the implementing regulations for section 1437p\nand concluded that the relevant requirements had been met. 104 With regard to\nsubpart (d)(6), the provision at issue here, HUD later indicated that:\n        . . . the [planned] redevelopment of both the Cedar Terrace and\n       Magnolia Homes sites will affirmatively further fair housing\n       and . . . the [planned] redevelopment of both sites will reduce the\n       concentration of public housing units in operation on these two\n       sites and will also lower the concentration of poverty in these\n       neighborhoods.” 105\n\nThis record evidence indicates conclusively that HUD reviewed the proposed\nsite for the planned redevelopment and approved it as meeting the standard\nlisted at subpart (d)(6). McCardell offers no relevant contrary evidence.\nAlthough she points to several expert reports reaching conclusions different\nfrom that reached by HUD, such evidence goes not to whether HUD reviewed\nand approved the proposed site in compliance with subpart (d), but instead\nattacks the wisdom of HUD’s underlying determination. As discussed above,\n\n\n\n\n       104     R.4611-4616 (“Based upon our review, [we find] that the requirements of 24\n[C.F.R. §] 970 and Section 18 of the [United States Housing Act].”). As the district court\ncorrectly explained, Section 18 of the United States Housing Act of 1937, as amended by the\nQuality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998, is codified at 42 U.S.C. § 1437p. See\nVeterans Affairs and HUD Appropriations Act, Pub. L.

McCardell offers that the demolition might have been carried out\npursuant to section 1437v, which provides that demolition of public housing\nundertaken in conjunction with a “main street revitalization or redevelopment\nproject” 106 is not subject to the provisions of section 1437p, 107 and thus not\nentitled to the section 1437p(d) safe harbor. In support, McCardell points to a\nfragment of GHA’s demolition application and asserts that GHA’s use of the\nword “obsolete” in a general narrative heading, 108 without an express\ninvocation of section 1437p, makes ambiguous whether the application was\nsubmitted pursuant to section 1437p or section 1437v, both of which refer to\nthe demolition of “obsolete” public housing projects. 109\n\n\n\n       106  The purpose of section 1437v(a) “is to provide [grant] assistance to public housing\nagencies” to improve living environments, revitalize sites, provide low income housing, and\nbuild sustainable communities. See 42 U.S.C. § 1437v; see generally “Main Street Grants\nNotice         of      Funding         Availability,”      HUD.GOV,          available       at\n(http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/public_indian_housing/program\ns/ph/hope6/grants/mainstreet (last visited April 3, 2015) (providing an overview of the Main\nStreet program). Section 1437v allows HUD to award grants to “carry out revitalization\nprograms for severely distressed public housing.” 42 U.S.C. § 1437v(d)(1).\n        107 Section 1437v(g) provides:\n\n\n\n              Any severely distressed public housing disposed of pursuant to a\n              revitalization plan and any public housing developed in lieu of such\n              severely distressed housing, shall be subject to the provisions of section\n              1437p of this title. Severely distressed public housing demolished\n              pursuant to a revitalization plan shall not be subject to the provisions\n              of section 1437p of this title. (emphasis added).\n\n       108 The heading reads: “Circumstances that resulted in the units becoming vacant and\nrelocation of residents: Hurricane Ike made units obsolete[.]” R.4528.\n       109 42 U.S.C. § 1437p(a)(1)(A)(i); id. at § 1437v(a)(1).\n\n                                              23\n\f    Case: 14-40955       Document: 00513127196          Page: 24     Date Filed: 07/23/2015\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-40955\n       This second argument is without merit. The record contains a written\ndeclaration from the director of HUD’s Public and Indian Housing Office of\nUrban Revitalization stating that “42 U.S.C. § 1437v does not apply to the\ndevelopment proposals submitted . . . by GHA for Cedar Terrace and Magnolia\nHomes.” 110 The record contains no contrary evidence; nor does McCardell offer\nany. Finally, McCardell’s assertion that GHA’s use of the word “obsolete”\ncreates ambiguity in the record, while creative, is unavailing. 111 Summary\njudgment was proper.\n                                             VI.\n       The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n       110 R.4618-21\n       111 See Boudreaux, 402 F.3d at 540 (“Once the moving party has demonstrated the\nabsence of a material fact issue, the non-moving party must go beyond the pleadings and\ndesignate specific facts showing that there is a general issue for trial.

In the wake of the storm, the\nCity of Galveston declared four public housing sites “unfit for human\noccupancy” and it ordered GHA to demolish Oleander Homes, Palm Terrace,\nMagnolia Homes, and Cedar Terrace. 8 Consistent with HUD’s practice in like\ncases, GHA sent a letter to HUD announcing its intent to demolish Oleander\nHomes and Palm Terrace without seeking prior authorization from HUD’s\nSpecial Applications Center under section 1437p. 9 Lone Star Legal Aid, a\nnonprofit legal organization, filed an administrative complaint with HUD\nopposing GHA’s demolition plan on behalf of displaced public housing tenants.\nGHA and LSLA reached a settlement of the complaint under which GHA\nagreed to provide replacement housing on a one-for-one basis for all residential\nunits destroyed by Ike and to incorporate the terms of an agreed upon\nreplacement plan. 10\n      Having satisfied LSLA’s concerns, GHA moved forward and demolished\nall four sites, including the housing units situated at the Magnolia Homes and\nCedar Terrace sites, on August 6, 2009. 11 It then submitted a formal demolition\napplication to HUD. 12 In a letter dated April 15, 2010, HUD approved GHA’s\napplication “as outlined in [an] enclosed memorandum from [HUD’s director of\n\n\n\n       7 Id. at 62,265.\n       8 R.3384-87.\n       9 R.3390, 4686-87; see 24 C.F.R. § 970.1 et seq.\n       10 R.3390-92.\n       11 R.4608.\n       12 See supra Note 6 and accompanying text (citing 79 Fed.

Procedural History\n       GHA’s effort to redevelop the Magnolia Homes and Cedar Terrace sites\nmet controversy. Individuals and the Galveston Open Government Project filed\nthis lawsuit, seeking to enjoin the plan and arguing that by proposing\nredevelopment on former public housing sites the plan would actively\nconcentrate poverty in already impoverished and racially segregated areas. 18\nThe original complaint named as defendants: the City of Galveston and GHA;\nGLO and the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs\n(collectively the “State Defendants”); and HUD and its secretary. 19\n       The second amended complaint added as an additional plaintiff\nTryshatel McCardell, an African-American resident of Galveston who lives\nnine blocks from the Cedar Terrace site. She claims injury from the\nconstruction of “public housing in [her] current neighborhood—a neighborhood\nthat is already segregated—[because it] will further add to the segregation of\nthe neighborhood—depriving her of interracial associations.” 20\n\n\n       17  Before Ike, Magnolia Homes and Cedar Terrace comprised 133 units and 136 units,\nrespectively—all 269 units were low-income public housing. The Magnolia Homes\nredevelopment would include 160 total units: 78 market rate unrestricted units; 18 project-\nbased section 8 voucher units; and 64 public housing units. The Cedar Terrace redevelopment\nwould include 121 total units: 59 market rate unrestricted units; 13 project-based section 8\nvoucher units; and 49 public housing units. R.4687; see R.2779-80. To achieve one-for-one\nreplacement of the 569 units lost, in complement to redeveloping the Magnolia Homes and\nCedar Terrace sites the master plan provides for the Texas General Land Office (“GLO”) to\ndevelop 385 public housing units at scattered sites, 50 of which may be developed outside\nGalveston city limits on the mainland of Galveston County. “GHA Reconstruction Plan,”\nGALVESTON                HOUSING              AUTHORITY,             available            at\nhttp://www.ghatx.org/dev_reconstruction.html (last visited April 1, 2015).\n        18 R.22.\n        19 Shaun Donovan was Secretary of HUD when this case was originally filed; Julian\n\nCastro later replaced Donovan at that post and was substituted for Donovan as a named\ndefendant.\n        20 R.2725-26.\n\n                                             5\n\f    Case: 14-40955        Document: 00513127196    Page: 6   Date Filed: 07/23/2015\n\n\n\n                                    No. 14-40955\n      Motions and orders ensued. In a thorough memorandum and order, the\ndistrict court dismissed for lack of standing all plaintiffs except for\nMcCardell. 21 McCardell then filed a third amended complaint, elaborating\nallegations in support of her “neighborhood standing” to challenge the plan 22\nand requesting declaratory and injunctive relief on claims under the\nconstitution, Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, and the Administrative\nProcedure Act. 23 The district court dismissed the State Defendants on\nsovereign immunity grounds, 24 dismissed the APA claim, 25 granted\nMcCardell’s motion to nonsuit the constitutional claim, 26 granted the\nremaining defendants’ joint motion for summary judgment on the Fair\nHousing Act claim, 27 and entered final judgment on August 13, 2014. 28\n      Only McCardell appeals. 29\n                                        II.\n      McCardell first challenges the district court’s dismissal of the Individual\nPlaintiffs and GOGP for lack of standing. As an initial matter, we hold that we\nlack jurisdiction to entertain these dismissals, for they did not appeal.\n      The Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure mandate that a notice of\nappeal must “specify the party or parties taking the appeal by naming each\none in the caption or body of the notice . . . [and] designate the judgment, order,\nor part thereof being appealed . . . .” 30 Failure to name a party in a notice of\nappeal constitutes a fatal defect in that it fails to confer upon our court\n\n\n      21 R.3728-63.\n      22 R.3846-47.\n      23 R.3857-60.\n      24 R.3872-74.\n      25 R.4460-63.\n      26 R.4514.\n      27 R.4685-97.\n      28 R.4698-99.\n      29 R.4700-02.\n      30 Fed.

Even assuming, without deciding, that McCardell would have\nstanding to bring such an appeal, we still would lack jurisdiction to review it.\nThe notice of appeal filed by McCardell names only McCardell as plaintiff in\nits caption and states the following in body text: “Notice is hereby given that\nTryshatel McCardell, Plaintiff in the above-named case, hereby appeals to the\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit the Final Judgment (D.E.\n148) entered in this action on the 13th day of August, 2014.” 33 The referenced\nfinal judgment names only McCardell as plaintiff and addresses only those\nclaims she alone brought in the third amended complaint. It does not mention\nthe Individual Plaintiffs or GOGP or any of the orders resulting in their\ndismissal from the suit. Although we “treat notices of appeal relatively liberally\n‘where the intent to appeal an unmentioned or mislabeled ruling is apparent\nand there is no prejudice to the adverse party,’” 34 no such intent is apparent\nhere. By specifically designating only the district court’s final judgment in her\nnotice of appeal, McCardell exhibited no intent to appeal the district court’s\ndismissal of the Individual Plaintiffs or GOGP. 35\n\n\n\n\n       31  Torres v.

The question remains whether Congress validly abrogated Texas’\nsovereign immunity in enacting the Fair Housing Act. McCardell cannot clear\nthe first hurdle of this inquiry. The language of the Fair Housing Act does not\nmake “unmistakably clear” that Congress intended to abrogate. It contains no\nprovision evidencing such intent. McCardell offers none, opting instead to\ndevote the whole of her briefing on this issue to the second prong: whether\nCongress passed the Fair Housing Act pursuant to a constitutionally valid\nexercise of its power. But whether Congress did so bridges beyond, as the Act\nlacks an explicit provision allowing its enforcement by private right of action\nagainst a state.\n       Its want is made the more clear, by contrast, in remedial provisions tied\nto other aspects of civil rights legislation. For example, with regard to Title VI\nof the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prevents discrimination by government\nagencies that receive federal funds, Congress provided by statute that “[a] state\nshall not be immune under the Eleventh Amendment of the Constitution of the\nUnited States from Suit in Federal court for a violation of . . . title VI of the\nCivil Rights Act of 1964 . . . .” 87 The Supreme Court has recognized that by this\nlanguage Congress “expressly abrogated States’ sovereign immunity against\nsuits brought . . . to enforce Title VI.” 88 No similar language exists in the\nprovisions of the Fair Housing Act.\n\n\n       86  Nevada Dep’t of Human Res. v.

And relevant to this appeal, 24\nC.F.R. § 970.31 provides that the development of “replacement public housing\nunits . . . on the original public housing location . . . must [also] comply with\n[the provisions of] 24 [C.F.R. §] 905 . . . .”\n      The provisions of 24 C.F.R. § 905, in turn, contain general requirements\nrelated “to the development of public housing units to be included under an\nACC and which will receive funding from public housing funds.” 98 Part\n905.602(d) provides that “[e]ach proposed site . . . for construction or\nrehabilitation of public housing must be reviewed and approved by the [HUD]\nfield office as meeting [several] standards, as applicable.” 99 This language\nindicates that a reviewing court’s inquiry is limited to considering whether\nHUD reviewed and approved a proposed site as meeting each standard. It does\nnot require or permit a reviewing court to second-guess HUD’s determinations.\n      Part 905.602(d) lists eleven standards that HUD must consider with\nregard to a proposed site for construction. 100 The fifth listed standard tracks\nthe language of the section 1437p(d) safe harbor and provides that\n“[n]otwithstanding the foregoing [four standards], after demolition of public\nhousing units a PHA may construct public housing units on the original public\nhousing site or in the same neighborhood if the number of replacement public\nhousing units is significantly fewer than the number of public housing units\ndemolished.” 101 Because McCardell concedes that the planned redevelopment\n\n\n      98 24 C.F.R. § 905.600(a); see id. at § 905.602(d).\n      99 Id. at § 905.602(d) (emphasis added).\n      100 Id. at § 905.602(d)(1)-(11).\n      101 Id. at § 905.602(d)(5).

The remaining question for our purposes is whether\nHUD reviewed the proposed site for the planned redevelopment and approved\nit as meeting the standards listed at subparts (d)(6) through (d)(11). 102 The\ndistrict court, in holding that the section 1437p(d) safe harbor applied as a\nmatter of law, necessarily concluded that HUD did so and thus answered this\nquestion affirmatively.\n                                              C.\n       McCardell challenges the district court’s holding on two fronts. She first\nargues that a material fact issue remains as to whether the planned\nredevelopment complies with subpart (d)(6), 103 which requires HUD to affirm\n\n\n\n              public housing units is significantly fewer than the number of public\n              housing units demolished. One of the following criteria must be\n              satisfied:\n\n                     (i) The number of public housing units being constructed\n                     is not more than 50 percent of the number of public\n                     housing units in the original development; or\n\n                     (ii) In the case of replacing an occupied development, the\n                     number of public housing units being constructed is the\n                     number needed to house current residents who want to\n                     remain at the site, so long as the number of public\n                     housing units being constructed is significantly fewer\n                     than the number being demolished; or\n\n                     (iii) The public housing units         being   constructed\n                     constitute no more than 25 units.\n\n       102  Because McCardell does not appeal the dismissal of her APA claim challenging\nHUD’s determination that the standards listed at subparts (d)(6) through (d)(11) were\nsatisfied, we have no occasion to consider whether those standards were satisfied in actuality.\n        103 McCardell makes passing reference to subparts (d)(7) through (d)(11) in briefing,\n\nbut she offers no basis on which this court could conclude that summary judgment as to those\nsubparts was improper. Nor do we find any basis in the record. The record indicates that the\ndemolition and planned redevelopment complied with subparts (d)(7) through (d)(11).\n                                             21\n\f    Case: 14-40955       Document: 00513127196          Page: 22     Date Filed: 07/23/2015\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-40955\nthat “[t]he site shall promote greater choice of housing opportunities and avoid\nundue concentration of assisted persons in areas containing a high proportion\nof low-income persons.” We disagree. The record leaves no doubt that this\nrequirement was met. After demolishing the Magnolia Homes and Cedar\nTerrace sites, GHA applied to HUD for formal approval of the demolition and\nthe planned redevelopment. In its letter of approval, HUD explicitly considered\nthe requirements set forth in the implementing regulations for section 1437p\nand concluded that the relevant requirements had been met. 104 With regard to\nsubpart (d)(6), the provision at issue here, HUD later indicated that:\n        . . . the [planned] redevelopment of both the Cedar Terrace and\n       Magnolia Homes sites will affirmatively further fair housing\n       and . . . the [planned] redevelopment of both sites will reduce the\n       concentration of public housing units in operation on these two\n       sites and will also lower the concentration of poverty in these\n       neighborhoods.” 105\n\nThis record evidence indicates conclusively that HUD reviewed the proposed\nsite for the planned redevelopment and approved it as meeting the standard\nlisted at subpart (d)(6). McCardell offers no relevant contrary evidence.\nAlthough she points to several expert reports reaching conclusions different\nfrom that reached by HUD, such evidence goes not to whether HUD reviewed\nand approved the proposed site in compliance with subpart (d), but instead\nattacks the wisdom of HUD’s underlying determination. As discussed above,\n\n\n\n\n       104     R.4611-4616 (“Based upon our review, [we find] that the requirements of 24\n[C.F.R. §] 970 and Section 18 of the [United States Housing Act].”). As the district court\ncorrectly explained, Section 18 of the United States Housing Act of 1937, as amended by the\nQuality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998, is codified at 42 U.S.C. § 1437p. See\nVeterans Affairs and HUD Appropriations Act, Pub. L. No. 105-276, 112 Stat. 2461, 2573\n(1998) (“Section 18 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437p) . . . .”); see\nalso, e.g., 24 C.F.R. § 906.35 (“The provisions of section 18 of the 1937 Act (42 U.S.C. 1437p)\n. . . .”).\n           105 R.3547 (emphasis added).\n\n                                             22\n\f    Case: 14-40955       Document: 00513127196          Page: 23     Date Filed: 07/23/2015\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-40955\nthe plain text of 24 C.F.R. § 905.602(d) does not permit us to second-guess\nHUD’s conclusions in this context.\n       Arguing in the alternative, McCardell posits that even if record evidence\ndemonstrates conclusively that the demolition was approved under section\n1437p, it might have been carried out pursuant to a different section\naltogether. McCardell offers that the demolition might have been carried out\npursuant to section 1437v, which provides that demolition of public housing\nundertaken in conjunction with a “main street revitalization or redevelopment\nproject” 106 is not subject to the provisions of section 1437p, 107 and thus not\nentitled to the section 1437p(d) safe harbor. In support, McCardell points to a\nfragment of GHA’s demolition application and asserts that GHA’s use of the\nword “obsolete” in a general narrative heading, 108 without an express\ninvocation of section 1437p, makes ambiguous whether the application was\nsubmitted pursuant to section 1437p or section 1437v, both of which refer to\nthe demolition of “obsolete” public housing projects. 109\n\n\n\n       106  The purpose of section 1437v(a) “is to provide [grant] assistance to public housing\nagencies” to improve living environments, revitalize sites, provide low income housing, and\nbuild sustainable communities. See 42 U.S.C. § 1437v; see generally “Main Street Grants\nNotice         of      Funding         Availability,”      HUD.GOV,          available       at\n(http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/public_indian_housing/program\ns/ph/hope6/grants/mainstreet (last visited April 3, 2015) (providing an overview of the Main\nStreet program). Section 1437v allows HUD to award grants to “carry out revitalization\nprograms for severely distressed public housing.” 42 U.S.C. § 1437v(d)(1).\n        107 Section 1437v(g) provides:\n\n\n\n              Any severely distressed public housing disposed of pursuant to a\n              revitalization plan and any public housing developed in lieu of such\n              severely distressed housing, shall be subject to the provisions of section\n              1437p of this title. Severely distressed public housing demolished\n              pursuant to a revitalization plan shall not be subject to the provisions\n              of section 1437p of this title. (emphasis added).\n\n       108 The heading reads: “Circumstances that resulted in the units becoming vacant and\nrelocation of residents: Hurricane Ike made units obsolete[.]” R.4528.\n       109 42 U.S.C. § 1437p(a)(1)(A)(i); id. at § 1437v(a)(1).\n\n                                              23\n\f    Case: 14-40955       Document: 00513127196          Page: 24     Date Filed: 07/23/2015\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-40955\n       This second argument is without merit. The record contains a written\ndeclaration from the director of HUD’s Public and Indian Housing Office of\nUrban Revitalization stating that “42 U.S.C. § 1437v does not apply to the\ndevelopment proposals submitted . . . by GHA for Cedar Terrace and Magnolia\nHomes.” 110 The record contains no contrary evidence; nor does McCardell offer\nany. Finally, McCardell’s assertion that GHA’s use of the word “obsolete”\ncreates ambiguity in the record, while creative, is unavailing. 111 Summary\njudgment was proper.\n                                             VI.\n       The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n       110 R.4618-21\n       111 See Boudreaux, 402 F.3d at 540 (“Once the moving party has demonstrated the\nabsence of a material fact issue, the non-moving party must go beyond the pleadings and\ndesignate specific facts showing that there is a general issue for trial.
