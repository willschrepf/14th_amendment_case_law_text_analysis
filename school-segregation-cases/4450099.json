On July\n\n18, 2014, the Court abated the appeal and remanded the case to determine whether\n\ncertain trial exhibits were lost or destroyed and to determine the fault for the\n\ndestruction or loss. Trial court filed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\n\nstating the exhibits were lost or destroyed, by no fault of appellants. See 2nd\n\nsupplemental clerk’s record.    Duplicates of lost or destroyed exhibits were filed\n\nwith the appeals court by visiting court reporter in October 2014.\n\n      Proceedings before 9th Administrative Judicial Region: Appellants filed a\n\nmotion to disqualify and recuse Judge Abe Lopez from sitting in the hearing\n\nordered by the court of appeals, which was denied by the 9th regional\n\nadministrative Judge Kelly Moore in September 2014.\n\n\n\n\n                                         xi\n\f              STATEMENT REGARDING ORAL ARGUMENT\n\n      This is the second appeal in this case in the last 6 years. This case has been\n\nstrung along for years of intentional inaction and obstruction. Appellants believe\n\noral argument would be of benefit to the Court at this stage to clarify these facts\n\nand legal arguments.\n\n      An oral argument in the first appeal in this case was denied. An oral\n\nargument then, would have made it abundantly clear to the Court that PISD neither\n\nhad the intention, evidence, nor argument concerning whether “printing” notices\n\nchanged the electronic properties of the PDF documents in question – a matter on\n\nwhich this court remanded the case.\n\n      As our brief makes clear, this case involves several matters of first\n\nimpression in the history of TOMA jurisprudence e.g. document properties of\n\nwebsite internet notices concerning §551.056(b) and issues concerning\n\n§551.056(d). Appellants’ pro se status should not be a hindrance.\n\n\n\n\n                                        xii\n\f                              ISSUES PRESENTED\n\n1.   Trial court’s failure to hold trial on seven distinct causes of action violates\n     TOMA and appellants’ absolute constitutional rights.\n\n2.   TOMA requires Exact and Literal compliance with its provisions;\n     Further, good faith defense under §551.056(d) requires clear and convincing\n     standard.\n\n3.   Trial court erred in refusing to void PISD’s actions and meetings in violation\n     of TOMA. Terrell is entitled to voidance of her termination action done in\n     3/26/2009 meeting and entitled to mandamus ordering reinstatement of\n     Terrell to her previous position as a teacher and to back wages and benefits\n\n4.   All PISD actions taken in meetings held in violation of TOMA’s notice\n     provisions are voidable and plaintiffs are entitled to their voidance. Plaintiffs\n     are entitled to judgment in their favor on all causes of action.\n\n5.   Plaintiffs have proven their good faith under TOMA §551.142.\n\n6.   Trial court erred in ruling that front door is bulletin board within the\n     meaning of §551.051 under TOMA. PISD’s posting of board meeting\n     notices on the front door violates TOMA.\n\n7.   Trial court erred in refusing to void PISD’s actions for failure to comply for 9\n     months with internet posting requirement of §551.056(b).\n\n8.   Trial court erred in refusing to deny PISD’s claim of “Good Faith” exception\n     under §551.056(d) for 11 Meetings for five months in 2009. PISD’s good\n     faith claim is a fraud on citizens and courts requiring sanctions.\n\n9.   PISD’s meeting notices with incomplete description of Place violate notice\n     provisions of TOMA and such meetings and actions therein must be voided.\n\n10. §551.045(d) requires a designated or authorized person to sign and post board\n    meeting notices; alternatively, this violation is a disputed material fact.\n\n11. Trial court erroneously refused to void Terrell’s termination action in 3/26/09\n    Board meeting in violation of TOMA; whether or not Terrell had individual\n    notice and her attendance at the meeting are irrelevant.\n\n                                         xiii\n\f12. The trial court erred in denying requested relief when undisputed evidence\n    shows PISD illegally closed the 3/26/2009 meeting to public and violated\n    §551.074(b) by deliberating Terrell’s employment contract outside of\n    meeting.\n\n13. Trial court erred in denying plaintiffs’ second motion for summary judgment,\n    MSJ, and motions for new trial or grant continuance, to modify judgment, for\n    reconsideration, and denying request for amended and additional findings of\n    fact and conclusions of law. Further, trial court erred when it denied\n    hearing on the newly discovered evidence. Trial court erred when it denied\n    post-remand discovery and denied plaintiffs’ certain trial exhibits, such denial\n    causing rendition of incorrect judgment.\n\n14. Terrell is the substantially prevailing party and should be awarded litigation\n    costs, fees, and special damages.\n\n15. This Court should award Terrell special damages and impose sanctions on\n    PISD due to PISD’s systematic and conscious violations of TOMA and to\n    ensure voluntary and willing compliance with TOMA by government bodies.\n\n16. Award of attorney fees of $30,000 to PISD is invalid and unreasonable,\n    further PISD forfeited and waived attorney fees.\n\n17. Assigned trial judge Lopez was disqualified from conducting trial in this case.\n\n18. Plaintiffs are interested persons under TOMA\n\n19. Evidence concerning SchoolCenter, BoardBook, and Lee Carter must be\n    excluded, or continuance granted. Further, bare assertions, hearsay and\n    irrelevant evidence must be barred. Trial court erred in considering such\n    evidence.\n\n20. PISD’s missing link issue is irrelevant because PISD untimely created\n    internet notices in May 2009; and copying or transferring the link onto new\n    website was not a technical problem and was not beyond the control of PISD\n    for 5 months\n\n21. Plaintiffs are entitled to summary judgment on 7 distinct causes of action,\n    and declaratory relief under section 551.142(a).\n\n                                        xiv\n\fTO THE HONORABLE SEVENTH COURT OF APPEALS:\n\n      This appeal raises important issues for this Court and Texas citizens. This\n\nCourt will decide whether Texas Open Meetings Act still is worth the exact and\n\nliteral compliance standard citizens and taxpayers of Texas demanded a long time\n\nago. Citizens will decide whether they should and can rely on TOMA and can take\n\nits promise of sunshine law seriously and will courts even rule on the violations.\n\nWill citizens be heard against government bodies and their lawyers? Texas Open\n\nMeetings Act may yet prove to be a sunshine law.\n\n                           I. STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n      The following facts are admitted, undisputed, or supported by record.\n\n      Undisputed facts concerning untimely “created dates” of PISD’s website\ninternet notices for 22 Meetings\n\n      1.   PISD did not contest at trial that the internet notices of 22 Board\n\nmeetings beginning August 13, 2008 to January 2009 (22 Meetings) were untimely\n\ncreated in May 2009 and were posted on PISD’s internet website on May 19, 2009.\n\nThis Court acknowledged the untimely creation of TOMA notices in its opinion in\n\nthe First Appeal. Appendices 7, 19, 14; PX1.\n\n      2. PISD did not present timely created website internet notices for 22\n\nMeetings with document properties that showed that the website internet notices\n\nwere created 72 hours before the start of each of the 22 Meetings in question as\n\nrequired by §551.056(b).\n                                        1\n\f       3.     PISD’s evidence of “missing link” to website notices is irrelevant\n\nbecause PISD created website internet notices untimely after said meetings had\n\nalready taken place. Appendix7, PX1. Appendix19-Opinion Pgs.5-6.\n\n       4. Appellants reported violations of §551.056(b) to PISD on May 15, 2009.\n\nPISD admitted plaintiffs’ report caused the problem to be corrected. Appendix11-\n\nInterrogatory 7.\n\n       5. PISD represented to this Court that printing said notices “changed” the\n\ncreated dates of notices. This caused this Court to remand the case. Appendix 19.\n\nPISD did not produce evidence at trial that the untimely “created” dates of the PDF\n\nnotices of meetings in question were the dates when “PISD printed the notices for\n\ndelivery to plaintiffs.” Appendix19. Linder denied having any knowledge, stating\n\nit was just speculation. Transcript pg.199. PISD did not present evidence at the\n\ntrial showing that printing internet notices for delivery to plaintiffs caused created\n\ndates of notices to change. No internet notices were ever printed for delivery to\n\nplaintiffs.\n\n       Undisputed facts about BoardBook:\n\n       6.     BoardBook is not a computer program that can be owned. Yearly\n\nsubscription fee or renewal license fee must be paid every year for using its\n\nsubscription services. If renewal fees are not paid every year, use of BoardBook is\n\nterminated. Appendix22. PISD did not purchase a BoardBook program in 2007 or\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\fat any other time or made any license fee payment to BoardBook. PISD does not\n\nhave a purchase order for or contract with, or paid any consideration to BoardBook\n\nfor its service from 8/13/2008 to 5/19/2009. PISD did not supplement, amend\n\nresponses to written discovery concerning purchase orders and payments to\n\nBoardBook.    Appendices8-11.     Further PISD refused and failed to provide\n\ndocuments concerning payments to BoardBook to the Texas Attorney General\n\nunder a Texas Public Information Act, Gov’t Code Ch.552 Request by plaintiffs.\n\nCR388 (First Appeal).\n\n      7.   PISD did not have BoardBook service from 8/13/2008 to 5/19/2009.\n\nPISD did not execute contract or pay license fees or renewal fees to BoardBook for\n\n1/2009 to 5/19/2009. Appendix22. PISD admits documents evidencing payment to\n\nBoardBook do not exist. Appendix11 (PISD’s Response to Request for\n\nProduction15). The draft subscription agreement with BoardBook for 2007 is not\n\nsigned by BoardBook. Appendix22. Further it is undisputed that PISD does not\n\nclaim good faith exception for any period in 2007 or 2008. BoardBook program\n\ndoes not post notices of meetings on PISD’s website for public viewing.\n\nAppendix10-Interrogatory18.\n\n      8. PISD is solely responsible for notices appearing or not appearing on\n\nBoardBook or compliance with TOMA. Appendix22. Notices of meetings are\n\nposted on BoardBook website in PDF (Adobe) format. BoardBook terminates\n\n\n\n                                        3\n\fagreement in 30 days if money is not received when due. BoardBook does not\n\nstore or archive notices 30 days after termination. Appendix22.\n\n      9. Jameson was aware of the link to notices not being on the new website.\n\nAppendix16. Jameson did not think link to BoardBook was necessary and needed\n\nto go on the new website. In a maintenance update the link was dropped by\n\nJameson on 1/15/2009. Appendix11-Interrogatory5. On 5/19/2009, Jameson added\n\nthe link to notices when she found out that the link to notices was required.\n\nAppendix16.    PISD’s new website was up and running during 1/15/2009 to\n\n5/19/2009. Appendix 16.\n\n      10. PISD’s internet notices did not appear on BoardBook’s website without\n\na link to them on PISD website. PISD’s notices were not available for public\n\nviewing on Yahoo or Google search.\n\n      11. PISD did not timely post notices of meetings on its own website for 22\n\nMeetings.\n\n      12.   Linder did not post copies of internet notices of meetings on PISD’s\n\nwebsite. BoardBook did not and does not place or post meeting notices on PISD’s\n\nwebsite at any time. PISD admits that its internet notices were not posted on its or\n\nBoardBook’s website for 11 meetings from 1/15/2009 to 5/19/2009 in violation of\n\n§551.056(b). Appendix11-Interrogatories5,7.\n\n\n\n\n                                         4\n\f      13. PISD did not know or provide the exact dates when its old website was\n\ndiscontinued and the new website went live and when the link to BoardBook was\n\ndiscontinued. BoardBook is an agent of PISD (Appendix22).\n\n      14.    Linder had no training, education, or expertise in technology or\n\nsoftware. PISD presented no exhibits, documentary evidence, or witnesses from\n\nBoardBook or SchoolCenter at trial.\n\n      Undisputed facts about Third Party Contractor SchoolCenter:\n\n      15. SchoolCenter worked for PISD and is PISD’s agent. No person from\n\nSchoolCenter testified concerning the claim that SchoolCenter failed to transfer\n\nlink, services assigned to and performed by SchoolCenter, and the dates of service.\n\nPISD did not present a contract, proof of payment for service, vouchers, purchase\n\norders, consideration for contract, or any documentary evidence at trial concerning\n\nSchoolCenter that defines the services it provided for PISD. SchoolCenter is a\n\nwebhosting service and not a webmaster for PISD.\n\n      16.    PISD did not disclose the identity of SchoolCenter and its role in\n\nresponse to written discovery from plaintiffs and further did not timely\n\nsupplement, amend, or correct its response to written discovery. SchoolCenter’s\n\nidentity and role was not disclosed until the trial in this case. In the First Appeal in\n\nthis case, PISD did not disclose to the 7th Court of Appeals the existence, identity,\n\nand central role of SchoolCenter in this lawsuit.\n\n\n\n                                           5\n\f      17. SchoolCenter’s failure to transfer link did not force or require PISD to\n\ncreate untimely internet notices in BoardBook weeks and months after the 22\n\nmeetings took place as noted by this Court. Appendix19. SchoolCenter had no\n\nrole in PISD’s creation of new untimely internet notices in the month of May 2009\n\nfor 22 meetings which were posted on 5/19/2009. See Appendices 7, 14; PX1.\n\n      18.    PISD and Jameson dropped the hyperlink to internet notices on\n\nBoardBook and did not ask SchoolCenter to establish it. Jameson admitted that the\n\nlink was not there on the old website at the time it was being converted to a new\n\nwebsite. Transcript pg.144. She did not think the link was necessary on the new\n\nwebsite. Appendix16. Transcript pg.144. SchoolCenter had direct access to PISD’s\n\nold website and transferred links that were on the old website onto the new\n\nwebsite.    Transcript pg.135.   Jameson established the link to BoardBook on\n\n5/19/2009. Appendix16. PISD untimely created notices for the 22 meetings in\n\nMay 2009. Appendix19; PX1. PISD did not have a purchase order, did not have a\n\ncontract with or make any payment to SchoolCenter for its service to build a new\n\nformat or transition hyperlinks to a new website. Hyperlinked notices did not exist\n\non old website, and SchoolCenter was not responsible for transferring the link to\n\nBoardBook. SchoolCenter’s role was irrelevant to PISD’s good faith defense.\n\n      19. Jameson has no expertise in website operations. Transcript pages 132.\n\nLee Carter operated PISD’s website (Transcript page 116, 132) through January\n\n\n\n                                        6\n\f2009 when he was PISD’s webmaster using Adobe Go Live software. Appendix 1.\n\nPISD admitted that the internet notice of 1/15/2009 board meeting did not appear\n\non its or BoardBook’s website for public viewing. The link to website notices was\n\ndropped from PISD’s website before 1/15/2009 board meeting. PISD claims good\n\nfaith defense for 11 meetings from 1/2009 to 5/19/2009. Appendix11-\n\nInterrogatories 5, 7.\n\n      20.    Linder did not communicate, direct, interact with, nor manage\n\nSchoolCenter concerning link to notices. Linder did not know the identity of\n\nSchoolCenter and did not have personal knowledge of its role in this lawsuit.\n\nTranscript page 191.\n\n      21. It is undisputed that PISD did not verify that its internet notices actually\n\nappeared for 72 hours before each of the 22 Meetings on its website directly or\n\nthrough a link. Transcript 176-178. PISD further failed to verify whether or not\n\nthe link to internet notices was in fact transferred to its new website for 11\n\nmeetings for 5 months from 1/15/2009 to 5/19/2009. Transcript 176-178.\n\n      22.    To put a link to notices on the website is not difficult. Transcript\n\npg.150. Failure to verify whether such link was removed and not reestablished is\n\nnot difficult and is not a technical problem. Transcript Page150. Further,\n\nverification that the link to internet notices actually was transferred onto PISD’s\n\n\n\n\n                                          7\n\fnew website is not beyond the control of PISD for 5 months from 1/15/2009 to\n\n5/19/2009. PISD does not meet requirements of §551.056(d).\n\n      23. PISD did not verify even once whether the internet notices of meetings\n\nwere actually appearing and visible to public for viewing on its website for 11\n\nmeetings in question from 1/15/2009 to May 19, 2009. Transcript pg.178. PISD’s\n\nwebsite was up and running properly during entirety of this time. No\n\ncommunication occurred between Jameson and Linder concerning TOMA notices\n\nof board meetings appearing on its website from January 2009 until after Thanedar\n\ninformed Linder on 5/15/2009 that internet notices did not appear on PISD’s\n\nwebsite. Appendix11-Interrogatory7; Appendix16.\n\n      24.    PISD admits that internet website notices required under TOMA\n\n§551.056(b) did not “appear” in the prescribed time of 72 hours on PISD’s website\n\nfor 11 meetings from 1/15/2009 to 5/19/2009. Appendices 8, 11 (Interrogatory7).\n\n      25. The internet notice that PISD posted on its website for 3/26/2009 board\n\nmeeting in which Terrell’s termination action took place was untimely created on\n\nMay 8, 2009 and untimely posted to PISD’s website on 5/19/2009. Appendix 14.\n\nAt trial, PISD did not present an internet website notice that was timely created 72\n\nhours before the 3/26/2009 board meeting.\n\n\n\n\n                                         8\n\f      26. PISD presented no evidence at trial 1) when a “link” to internet notices\n\nactually existed on its website and the date on which it was dropped, and that 2)\n\nSchoolCenter was responsible for transferring said link to a new website.\n\n      27.    PISD managed and maintained its website on and before 1/15/2009.\n\nPISD managed its website 72 hours before the 1/15/2009 board meeting. The\n\ninternet notice for 1/15/2009 meeting did not appear on PISD’s website because\n\nPISD and Jameson dropped the link in a maintenance update.            Appendix11-\n\nInterrogatory5,7. There was no link on the old PISD website for SchoolCenter to\n\ntransfer to the new website. SchoolCenter was not involved in dropping the link.\n\nPISD’s new website went live in February 2009.\n\nFacts regarding plaintiffs’ causes of action:\n\n      28.    Terrell sued PISD on 5/29/2009 on eight distinct causes of action\n\narising out of PISD’s violations of TOMA and seeks to void her termination and\n\nfor reinstatement and back wages among other relief. Appendices5,6. PISD’s first\n\namended answer had no certificate of service and was not served on plaintiffs.\n\nCR282-284.\n\n      29. Trial Judge Lopez did not try plaintiffs’ distinct claims under sections\n\n551.041, 551.043, 551.051, 551.045(d), 551.74(b), 551.101, 551.142(a) (“7\n\nCauses”).    Further, Judge Lopez did not rule on said claims, nor ruled on\n\ndeclaratory, mandamus, or injunctive relief, and did not make Findings of Fact and\n\n\n\n                                         9\n\fConclusions of Law on 7 Causes. Appendix21. Physical posting of notices for\n\n3/26/2009 meeting and other 21 meetings was not the subject of trial.     PISD did\n\nnot comply with any of Gov’t Code Chapter 551’s notice provisions for 22 board\n\nmeetings in question.     PISD was not the substantially prevailing party under\n\nTOMA.\n\n      30. Plaintiffs did not announce ready and requested continuance of the trial\n\ndate due to the death of Thanedar’s mother. Transcript pg.6. Trial court failed to\n\nrule on admissibility of PX1, and denied PX13 (Audio Tapes-CDs), PX12, PX14,\n\nPX19, PX21, and PX25. Trial court did not provide a reasonable notice or 45-day\n\nnotice (TRCP 245) for the trial in this case on remand from the appeals court.\n\nPlaintiffs’ filings were not voluminous either in trial court or appeals court.\n\nFurther they were neither unreasonable nor improper. PISD did not respond to\n\nplaintiffs’ filings and no attorney fees were incurred by PISD on them. Trial court\n\nheld no hearings on plaintiffs’ motions or filings.\n\nUndisputed facts in plaintiffs’ claim under §551.051 (Bulletin Board)\n\n      31. PISD admits that it posted board meeting notices on the front door of its\n\nadministrative building for the time period in question from 8/13/2008 to\n\n5/19/2009 (22 Meetings). Public citizens were required to stand outside the central\n\noffice building to read the public meeting notices. PISD does not dispute that there\n\nwas an unused glass enclosed bulletin board inside its administrative office\n\n\n\n                                          10\n\fbuilding in the lobby area during 22 Meetings and that PISD relocated a glass\n\nenclosed bulletin board outside its administrative office building on 6/5/2009.\n\nAppendix9 (Admissions 5,7,8).\n\nUndisputed facts in plaintiffs’ claim under §551.041 (Place)\n\n      32. PISD admits that for both paper and internet notices it did not specify\n\nor include the name of the city. Appendix9 (Admission15). PISD’s notices merely\n\nstate “Pampa High School” or “Pampa Junior High School” without the address.\n\nSee CR70-71, CR75, CR89-90, CR129-130, CR147-148, CR156, CR167-168,\n\nCR170 (First Appeal).    PISD service boundaries defined by Texas Education\n\nAgency cover portions of Gray and Roberts Counties.\n\nUndisputed facts in plaintiffs’ claim under §551.043 (72 Hours)\n\n      33. The physical notice for 3/26/2009 meeting was not posted for 72 hours\n\nin a bulletin board inside the central administrative office.   CR60-66(Second\n\nAppeal).\n\n      The physical notice for 5/19/2009 meeting was not posted for 72 hours in a\n\nbulletin board. CR60-66(Second Appeal). Linder confirmed to plaintiff Thanedar\n\nthat there was an error in posting this notice because the meeting date changed to\n\n5/19/2009 and that Linder posted a corrected notice for a board meeting on 5/19/09\n\non the front door on 5/18/2009 because of the change. CR60-66(Second Appeal).\n\nUndisputed facts in plaintiffs’ claim under §551.101 (closed meeting)\n\n\n\n                                       11\n\f      34.   The presiding officer of the Board did not identify the section or\n\nsections under TOMA that authorized closing of the 3/26/2009 board meeting to\n\npublic. See PX14; PX13 (Audio CDs); Appendix9(Admission14).\n\nUndisputed facts in plaintiffs’ claim under §551.074(b) (deliberations)\n\n      35.   The audio recording of the closed meeting on 3/26/2009 shows\n\ndiscussion among Superintendent Haenisch and Board members on Terrell’s\n\ntermination. Terrell had specifically requested the action be deliberated in open\n\nmeeting per §551.074(b). PX13 (Audio CDs)(Tape 2 at Counter 43:45).\n\nUndisputed facts in plaintiffs’ claim under §551.045(d) (designated person)\n\n      36. PISD’s Board did not designate or authorize Karen Linder to sign\n\nmeeting notices or post board meeting notices on the Board’s behalf. CR609,\n\nCR832; CR821-823 (First Appeal). Appendix10 (Req. for Production 28). Linder\n\nsigned and posted board meeting notices without authorization from the Board of\n\nTrustees. Board retained authority with respect to calling, signing, and posting\n\nnotices of board meetings. CR821-823; CR832; CR834-836(FirstAppeal).\n\nUndisputed facts about attorney fees\n\n      37. PISD counsel refused and failed to testify at trial on PISD’s attorney\n\nfees concerning the amount and its reasonableness.         PISD made no valid\n\napplication for attorney fees under §551.142(b) at trial. Trial court asked PISD’s\n\nattorney Mr. Arnold whether he wanted to testify and present evidence concerning\n\n\n\n                                       12\n\fPISD’s request for attorney fees. PISD’s counsel refused to do so, instead asked\n\ntrial Judge Lopez to take notice of the file. Transcript page 238. PISD did not\n\npresent evidence concerning existence of PISD’s attorney fees, hours, hourly rate,\n\ntasks performed and by whom, difficulty level, and reasonableness of court’s\n\naward of attorney fees of $30,000.\n\nUndisputed facts about Bad Faith\n\n      38. At trial, PISD presented no evidence of plaintiffs’ bad faith in bringing\n\nthe lawsuit. PISD’s actions did not have reasonable basis under TOMA. TOMA\n\nrequires reasonable attorney fees to be proven at trial, and does not permit judicial\n\nnotice of file. PISD did not present factual evidence of voluminous pleadings and\n\nmotions in district court or appellate court or time spent by PISD defending against\n\nthem or the suit. Appellants were meritorious and prevailed in the first appeal with\n\nSeventh COA awarding costs to appellants. Appendix19. Judge Lopez does not\n\nhave power to grant appellate attorney fees.\n\nUndisputed facts about Plaintiffs’ Good Faith\n\n      39. Plaintiffs presented evidence of their good faith at trial. PISD admits\n\nthat plaintiffs’ report to PISD of non-appearance of website notices was the sole\n\nreason why PISD fixed its non-compliance with §551.056(b) for 11 meetings after\n\n5 month long of non-compliance. Appendix11-Interrogatory7.\n\n\n\n\n                                         13\n\fPlaintiffs’ employment, Standing, Back-Wages\n\n      40. Appellants are citizens and taxpayers of Texas for more than 15 years\n\n(4 years in Pampa beginning 2008), and are interested persons under TOMA and\n\npay sales taxes and other taxes that fund PISD and other school districts in Texas.\n\nPX15, PX21; Appendices5,6. TOMA does not require plaintiffs to reside within\n\nPISD’s boundaries. PISD, a school district created by the State of Texas, is a\n\ngovernment body subject to TOMA. Terrell was a first year beginning teacher at\n\nPampa High School and taught U.S. History, World History, and World\n\nGeography. Terrell’s probationary contract (PX6) does not automatically expire\n\nby its own terms under the Education Code. The Education Code §21.103 requires\n\nthat a probationary contract must be terminated in 45 days before the last day of\n\ninstruction or the contract automatically renews. Terrell’s probationary contract\n\nwas terminated by PISD in a Board meeting on 3/26/2009. Terrell was not given\n\nand did not have actual notice of termination of contract, nor was Terrell’s contract\n\nplaced on the notice/agenda of the 3/26/2009 meeting.          The legal notice of\n\n3/26/2009 board meeting required under TOMA was not in a bulletin board or on a\n\nfront door for 72 hours prior to said meeting. Terrell’s termination was not placed\n\non the agenda of the meeting.\n\n\n\n\n                                         14\n\f41.

Plaintiff Thanedar testified as an expert witness at trial\n\nin this case. Transcript pgs.75-86.\n\n                          II. SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\n      The trial on 10/9/2013 made mockery of Texas Open Meetings Act\n\n(TOMA).      Plaintiffs’ seven distinct causes of action under TOMA sections\n\n551.041, 551.043, 551.051, 551.45(d), 551.74(b), 551.101 and 551.142(a) were not\n\ntried or ruled on. Trial judge Abe Lopez blamed this Court for it. Plaintiffs’ are\n\nabsolutely entitled under law and Texas and U.S. Constitutions to declaratory\n\nrulings, mandamus, and injunctive relief on the above claims.      Judge Lopez was\n\ndisqualified to hold trial. PISD produced no legal evidence concerning its claim of\n\ngood faith under §551.056(d). Further forgetting to transfer or verifying transfer of\n\na link is not a technical problem and never beyond the control of PISD, a\n\ngovernment body, especially over 5 months.            PISD lied to this Court about\n\n“created dates” of internet notices and the “link.”\n\n      PISD is solely responsible for compliance with TOMA.             Any outside\n\nvendors are agents of PISD. PISD showed intentional ignorance concerning the\n\nuntimely internet notices posted after 5 months, got caught, and made things up.\n\nPISD’s good faith claim is a fraud on Texas citizens and courts. Attorney fee\n\n\n\n                                          15\n\faward to PISD is unlawful and unreasonable. Each cause of action by plaintiffs is\n\ndispositive of the whole case requiring reversal of trial court’s judgment and\n\nentitling plaintiffs judgment in her favor. This Court should reverse trial court’s\n\njudgment and render judgment for plaintiffs and grant their prayer.\n\n                          III. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n      A case is “tried” when a court holds an evidentiary hearing on a cause of\n\naction upon conflicting evidence. Besing v. Moffitt, 882 S.W.2d 79,81-82 (Tex.\n\nApp.-Amarillo,1994, no writ); Haddix, infra at 345. In cases tried without a jury,\n\nfindings of fact delineate facts that support the judgment and the legal reasoning\n\nunderlying the judgment. In such cases, findings of fact and conclusions of law are\n\nmandatory under TRCP Rule 296 and 297.\n\n      On appeal, findings of fact are reviewed for sufficiency of the evidence and\n\nconclusions of law are reviewed de novo. Haddix v. American Zurich Ins. Co., 253\n\nS.W.3d 339,345(Tex. App.—Eastland 2008, no pet.); IKB Indus. v. Pro-Line\n\nCorp.,938 S.W.2d 440,442 (Tex. 1997).\n\n      A request for additional findings is similar to an objection. Vickery v.\n\nCommission for Lawyer Discipline, 5 S.W.3d 241, 255-56 (Tex. App.—Houston\n\n[14th Dist.], pet. denied).    Thus a request for additional findings of fact has\n\nsignificance unrelated to the trial court actually filing additional findings of fact. A\n\nchallenge to the sufficiency of the evidence in a bench trial can be raised for the\n\n\n\n                                          16\n\ffirst time in appellant’s brief. There is no need to file a post-judgment motion\n\nraising it. TEX. R. APP. 33.1(d).\n\n      A no evidence point is sustained if the record discloses the following: (1)\n\nthere is complete absence of evidence of a vital fact; (2) the court is barred by rules\n\nof law or evidence from giving weight to the only evidence offered to prove a vital\n\nfact; (3) the evidence offered to prove a vital fact is no more than a scintilla of\n\nevidence; or (4) the evidence conclusively established the opposite of a vital fact.\n\nSee Hawkins v. Ehler, 100 S.W.3d 534, 539 (Tex. App.--Fort Worth 2003, no\n\npet.); Horton v. Horton, 965 S.W.2d 78, 85 (Tex. App.--Fort Worth 1998, no pet.).\n\n      An assertion that the evidence is \"insufficient\" to support a fact finding\n\nmeans that the evidence supporting the finding is so weak or the evidence to the\n\ncontrary is so overwhelming that the answer should be set aside and a new trial\n\nordered. Garza v. Alviar, 395 S.W.2d 821, 823 (Tex.1965).\n\n      When reviewing a factual sufficiency challenge, the appellate court\n\nconsiders all the evidence and determines whether the evidence supporting a\n\nfinding is so weak as to be clearly wrong and unjust or whether the evidence is so\n\nagainst the great weight and preponderance of the evidence to be clearly wrong and\n\nmanifestly unjust. Dow Chem. Co. v. Francis, 46 S.W.3d 237, 242 (Tex. 2001).\n\nAppellate court is required to consider all of the evidence in the case in making this\n\ndetermination. Hawkins, Id.\n\n\n\n                                          17\n\f      Exact and Literal Compliance Required under TOMA:\n\n      TOMA’s provisions are mandatory. Acker, Infra; Smith County, Infra.\n\nTOMA violations are not trivial or de minimis. The Texas Supreme Court has\n\nrequired Exact and Literal Compliance by governmental bodies, especially, with\n\nrespect to the notice provisions of TOMA. Acker v. Texas Water Commission, 790\n\nS.W.2d 299 (Tex. 1990) (“The explicit command of the statute is for openness at\n\nevery stage of the deliberations. Accordingly, we have demanded exact and\n\nliteral compliance with the terms of this statute.[citing] Smith County v.\n\nThornton, 726 S.W.2d 2, 3 (Tex. 1986)”); City of San Antonio v. Fourth Court of\n\nAppeals, 820 S.W.2d 762 (Tex. 1991). Thus, “substantial compliance” is not valid\n\nlaw in Texas. A governmental body’s actions taken in violation of TOMA are\n\nvoidable. §551.141. TOMA is not a scheme to provide due process to individuals.\n\nIt is not a legislative scheme for service of process; it has no due process\n\nimplications. Acker, Id.; City of San Antonio, Id.\n\n      Burden of Proof: Plain language of TOMA makes it clear that the burden\n\nof proof of “good faith” under §551.056(d) is on the government body and that it\n\nmust be “continuous” for each meeting. §551.056(d); §551.043 (b)(1) and (b)(3).\n\n                                 IV. ARGUMENT\n\n      Appellants repeat preceding paragraphs as if set forth verbatim herein.\n\n1. Trial court’s failure to hold trial on 7 distinct causes of action violates\nTOMA and appellants’ absolute Constitutional rights\n\n                                          18\n\f        By a slight of hand, the trial court rigged this case and denied trial on\n\nplaintiffs’ distinct causes of action under TOMA Sections 551.041, 551.043,\n\n551.045, 551.051, 551.074, 551.101, and 551.142(a)(7 Causes).3 Appendices 5,6,\n\nTranscript pages 11-12. Judge Lopez had an independent duty to try and rule on\n\nsaid causes of action under TOMA and the Texas and U.S. Constitutions, but failed\n\nto do so. Plaintiffs’ absolute constitutional rights of due process in this matter\n\ncannot be denied or waived, and plaintiffs did not waive their constitutional rights.\n\nMarin v. State, 851 S.W.2d 275, 279-280, Tex. Court of Criminal Appeals, En\n\nBanc (1993).\n\n\n\n3\n  PISD’s Board held a total of 22 meetings from 8/13/08 to 5/19/09. Violations of TOMA\nprovisions at Issue in this case:\n       §551.051: PISD violated §551.051 by failing to post notices of 22 Meetings in a\n        specifically designated place - Bulletin Board in its Central Administrative Office.\n       §551.056: PISD violated §551.056 by failing to concurrently post internet notices of 22\n        Meetings on its website for prescribed time and manner.\n       §551.043: PISD violated §551.043 by failing to post notices of 22 Meetings at a physical\n        location for prescribed time (72 hours) and manner.\n       §551.041: PISD violated §551.041 by failing to specify “place” in its notices of 22\n        Meetings.\n       §551.101 and §551.074(b): PISD violated §551.101 by failing to legally close the\n        3/26/09 Board meeting and violated §551.074(b) by deliberating on Terrell’s termination\n        in closed meeting.\n       §551.045(d): PISD violated §551.045(d) because PISD’s notices of 22 Meetings were\n        signed on behalf of the Board and posted by a person (Linder) not so designated nor\n        authorized by Board of Trustees.\n       §551.142(a): Declaratory, injunctive, and mandamus relief on all plaintiffs’ claims.\n\n\n                                                19\n\f      Further, plaintiffs filed timely objections and motions and brought trial\n\ncourt’s failure to try 7 Causes to its attention. Appendices1,2,3,4. Judge Lopez’s\n\ngeneral observations and comments are not rulings. Further, the trial court failed\n\nto make findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding 7 Causes and did not\n\nrule on plaintiffs’ request for amended or additional findings of Fact and\n\nconclusions of law in this regard. Appendix4.\n\n      The trial court stated that the appeals court remanded the case to hold trial\n\nonly in the matter of §551.056(d). Transcript Pgs.11-12. This is plainly false and\n\nan abdication of Judge Lopez’s independent duty to rule. The appeals court did not\n\nrule on or limit the causes of action on which trial could be held. Appendix19.\n\nTrial court was required to hold trial on all of them and specifically rule on them.\n\nTexas Rules of Civil Procedure require that the trial court’s judgment shall\n\nconform to pleadings. TRCP 301. TOMA §551.142(a) entitles plaintiffs to\n\ndeclaratory ruling and relief on every one of plaintiffs’ 7 untried causes of action.\n\nPlaintiffs objected and asked the Judge Lopez to grant new trial on 7 causes of\n\naction. Appendices 1,2,3,4. Trial court was required under TRCP 166a to either\n\ngrant plaintiffs’ second summary judgment motion on said 7 Causes or try them\n\nand rule on each one of them.\n\n      The Court’s failure and refusal to try the 7 Causes violates plaintiffs’\n\nconstitutional rights under Texas Constitution Article 1 Sections 3, 13, 19, and 27,\n\n\n\n                                         20\n\fand the 14th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution and is clear misconduct on Judge\n\nLopez’s part.\n\n      In the words of Justice Sandra Day O’Connor “this right to petition is one of\n\nthe most precious of the liberties safeguarded by the Bill of Rights.” BE&K\n\nConstruction, Infra. Appellants’ are absolutely entitled to trial on every single one\n\nof their 7 untried remaining causes of action under TOMA and have all of their\n\ncomplaints redressed and ruled on. Plaintiffs request that this Court uphold this\n\nright and vacate final judgment and grant new trial on all causes of action.\n\n2. Plaintiffs are entitled to Summary Judgment on 7 distinct causes of action\nand Declaratory Relief under §551.142(a)\n\n      Plaintiffs are entitled to declaratory, injunctive, mandamus relief under\n\nTOMA whether or not any other relief is granted and whether or not PISD's actions\n\nin violation of TOMA are voided.\n\nA. Plaintiffs are entitled to declaration that PISD violated TOMA §551.051.\n\n      PISD admits that it posted TOMA notices on the front door for 22 Meetings\n\nwhen there was an unused bulletin board inside the building. Statement of Fact\n\n(SOF) 31. §551.051 mandates the location for notices. Here it is clear common\n\nsense that “front door” is not “bulletin board” inside the building under §551.051.\n\n      This violation is particularly offensive and vile as it forces the “undesirable”\n\ncitizens to stand outside the entrance of the building in rain, snow, cold, hot\n\nweather and in poor lighting conditions and humiliate themselves standing in the\n\n\n                                         21\n\fway of the incoming and outgoing traffic. This is abuse of citizens. These notices\n\non the front door cannot be read from inside and certainly are neither safe, nor\n\nconvenient, thus do not meet the requirements of “convenient,” “accessible”\n\n“inside the building” and “bulletin board” and under §551.051 under Exact and\n\nLiteral compliance standard. Forcing citizens to stand outside the building to read\n\nnotices is an unwelcome mat to poor citizens and minorities all around the “Carver\n\nCenter” to prevent them from entering the building. Only PISD would have the\n\ngall in this day and age to engage in this insensitive divisive tactic against its own\n\ntaxpaying citizens. Why should or would taxpayers stand outside the building that\n\nthey paid for to read TOMA notices? What is next - notices on windows, plants,\n\nand restroom doors? This Court should prevent this abomination of §551.051 and\n\ndeclare that notices on front doors violate §551.051.\n\nB. Plaintiffs are entitled to declaration that PISD violated §551.041 when\nPISD failed to give notice of \"place.\"\n\n      PISD admits the facts in SOF32. PISD failed to notify the reader of the\n\n“place” under §551.041 for 22 meetings under the exact and literal compliance\n\nstandard. PISD forced citizens to guess about “place” with details missing from\n\nnotice e.g. street address, location, and other details. Thus plaintiffs are entitled to\n\nthe declaration that PISD violated §551.041.\n\nC. Plaintiffs are entitled to declaration by the court that PISD violated\n§551.045(d).\n\n\n\n                                          22\n\f      PISD admits that Board never authorized nor designated Karen Linder under\n\nTOMA to sign notices of meetings on behalf of the Board. SOF36. The language\n\nof §551.045(d) is clear that it applies to all notices not just emergency notices and\n\nit requires an authorized or designated person to post notices of meetings.\n\n§551.045(d). Thus plaintiffs are entitled to declaration that PISD violated\n\n§551.045(d).\n\nD. Plaintiffs are entitled to declaration that PISD violated TOMA §551.101 by\nimproperly closing its March 26, 2009 meeting and further violated 551.074(b)\n\n      It is not disputed that defendant's president, Mr. Charles Smith did not\n\nidentify the section or sections of TOMA that authorized closing the 3/26/09 board\n\nmeeting to the public under TOMA before closing the meeting. SOF34. PISD thus\n\ndid not comply with the §551.101(2). Therefore, plaintiffs are entitled to\n\ndeclaration that PISD unlawfully closed meeting on March 26, 2009 in violation of\n\n§551.101. Plaintiffs are entitled to all legal and equitable relief and that 3/26/09\n\nclosed meeting and actions taken in it be declared unlawful and contents of the\n\nclosed meeting be made public and allowed to be freely copied and distributed.\n\nPISD deliberated on Terrell's contract termination in the closed meeting on 3/26/09\n\nwhen Terrell had specifically requested the action be deliberated in open meeting\n\nper §551.074(b). SOF35. Plaintiffs are entitled to the declaration that PISD\n\nviolated §551.074(b).\n\n\n\n\n                                         23\n\fE. Plaintiffs are entitled to declaration by the court that PISD violated\n§551.043 concerning the 3/26/09 and 5/19/09 Board Meetings\n\n       Plaintiffs’ rely on SOF33. It is undisputed that the notice of 3/26/09 Board\n\nmeeting was not seen posted in the bulletin board in PISD’s Central Office nor on\n\nits front door at 5 P.M. and after 6 P.M. on 3/23/09 i.e. notice was posted less than\n\nthe prescribed 72 hours in violation of §551.043.4 PISD’s (Linder) vague claims\n\nand surmise do not specifically dispute plaintiffs’ sworn assertions e.g. a revised\n\nnotice for 3/26/2009 meeting was taped to the front door of central office building\n\non 3/24/09, less than 72 hours before the start of the meeting.\n\n       Similarly, the notice for 5/19/09 meeting was posted for less than 72 hours\n\nbecause the meeting date changed from 5/8/09 to 5/19/2009 causing the revised\n\nnotice to be reposted. Because PISD posted (paper) notices of 3/26/09 and 5/19/09\n\nBoard meetings for less than the prescribed 72 hours, PISD violated §551.043.\n\n       TOMA violations Are Distinct: The statutory language of TOMA is clear\n\nthat the above notice provisions are distinct, and failure to comply with any one of\n\nthe notice provisions renders the action(s) in violation of TOMA and thus voidable.\n\n§551.141.\n\n\n\n\n4\n  Whether or not Plaintiffs knew or attended the meeting (SOF40) is irrelevant. TOMA is not\nscheme for process of service and has no due process implications. Acker, Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                            24\n\f      No developed record:       Because there was no trial on 7 Causes, no trial\n\nrecord exists, thus Plaintiffs rely on the facts and arguments in their Second No-\n\nevidence and Traditional Summary Judgment motion herein. Appendix12.\n\n      A party moving for summary judgment must show that no genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact exists and that the party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n\nRandall's Food Mkts., Inc. v. Johnson, 891 S.W.2d 640, 644 (Tex. 1995); TRCP\n\n166a(c). Here. The facts are undisputed in the untried 7 Causes. Thus based on\n\nthe exact and literal compliance standard, plaintiffs are entitled to summary\n\njudgment in their favor.\n\nF. The sky is not falling if illegal actions are voided\n\n      PISD has repeatedly tried scare tactics by using the bogeyman of voidance.\n\nAll actions in violation of TOMA must be voided given PISD’s defiance,\n\nconscious indifference, obstruction of discovery, and systematic longstanding\n\nviolations of TOMA’s notice requirements. PISD can ratify the voided actions in a\n\nlegally held board meeting under TOMA. So far PISD has refused to ratify its\n\nactions as was properly done in ATSPAC v. Sierra Club, 843 S.W.2d 683 (Tex.\n\nApp.--Austin 1992), preferring instead to scare the courts.\n\nG. Terrell is entitled to back wages and voidance of her illegal termination:\n\n      Terrell was not terminated in a legally convened meeting under TOMA, thus\n\nthe termination action is voidable. §551.141. Given PISD’s outrageous misconduct\n\n\n\n                                         25\n\fand systematic violations of TOMA, and Terrell’s termination action should be\n\nvoided. Voidance of Terrell’s termination in 3/26/2009 meeting means Terrell\n\nlawfully continues to be an employee and is owed back wages. Courts have upheld\n\nvoidance of action involving employment termination, reinstatement upon\n\nvoidance, and granting back wages and benefits.       See Ferris v. Texas Board\n\nChiropractic Examiners, 808 S.W.2d 514, 519 (Tex.App—Austin 1991) (ordering\n\nback wages and benefits of $26,000 until the time Ms. Ferris was terminated in a\n\nlegally convened meeting under TOMA). Like Ferris, Terrell continues to be\n\nlawfully employed by defendant. Back wages and benefits are thus due Terrell,\n\ncurrently at about $262,000 for 5 years until Terrell is terminated lawfully in a\n\nsubsequent legally held meeting under TOMA. Ferris, Id. Further Terrell’s illegal\n\ntermination cannot be ratified retroactively because Education Code requires a 45\n\nday notice to Terrell before the last day of instruction (10 days for 2012-2013 and\n\nafter), failing which Terrell’s contract is automatically renewed and becomes, as\n\nhere, a continuing contract after 3 years. See Education Code§21.103.\n\n3.  Plaintiffs are entitled to exclusion of evidence on SchoolCenter,\nBoardBook, or are entitled to continuance\n\n      Exclusion of Evidence: TRCP 193.5 mandates that a party must amend or\n\nsupplement the party’s response to written discovery when the part learns that its\n\nresponse was incomplete or incorrect when made, or is no longer complete and\n\ncorrect. TRCP 193.5(a).

In its discovery responses PISD represented that only Jameson and\n\nLinder had knowledge of the “link” problem and Jameson caused the link to be\n\nsevered in a maintenance update. Appendix11.       In a flip flop, PISD identifies a\n\nnew culprit, SchoolCenter, and blames it for not transferring the link. PISD failed\n\nto identify, provide information on SchoolCenter in the written discovery, and\n\nfurther failed to amend, supplement, or correct written discovery concerning\n\nSchoolCenter. Appendices 8,9,10,11. SOF16. Plaintiffs’ are entitled to exclude\n\nany information concerning SchoolCenter from evidence under TRCP 193.6\n\nbecause PISD failed to comply with TRCP 193.5. Boothe v.

Trial court erred in denying plaintiffs’\n\nmotions to exclude in this regard. Transcript pgs 214-220.\n\n      PISD lied to this Court throughout the First Appeal process in its briefs by\n\nconcealing the identity of SchoolCenter and its alleged central role in this case\n\ncausing obstruction of justice.   Now after 6 years, there are more lies.       All\n\ninformation concerning SchoolCenter must be excluded from evidence as a\n\nsanction on PISD for failure to comply with TRCP 193.5.      Boothe v. Hausler, Id.\n\nThe sanction for failure to comply with this rule is exclusion of the evidence\n\naffected by the violation. TRCP 215(5); TRCP 193.6; PISD failed to establish\n\nbefore the trial court that good cause existed for allowing SchoolCenter related\n\nevidence. Boothe v. Hausler, at 789.\n\n      At trial, PISD claimed to have purchased BoardBook program, paid license\n\nfees and renewal fees to BoardBook for its service to post website notices since\n\n2007. But during discovery process PISD refused and failed to provide full and\n\ncomplete discovery and produce documents concerning payment of license fees\n\nand renewal fees to BoardBook. PISD refused and failed to supplement answers to\n\nwritten discovery in this regard. SOF6. All evidence concerning existence of\n\nBoardBook service should have been excluded and struck from evidence at trial.\n\nSee TRCP 215(5).; TRCP 193.6; Boothe v. Hausler at 789. The Court erred when\n\nit refused and failed to do so in response to motions from plaintiffs. CR111.\n\n\n\n                                         28\n\f      PISD concealed the above information from plaintiffs and the Attorney\n\nGeneral of Texas, obstructing justice. SOF6. Plaintiffs were severely compromised\n\nin their ability to show that non-compliance with §551.056(b) was actually due to\n\nthe fact PISD did not have BoardBook service during 8/13/2008 to 5/2009 or that\n\nPISD actually obtained it in May 2009 when and untimely created and posted prior\n\nmeeting notices to conceal violation of §551.056(b). Texas law is clear - without\n\nproof of payment of consideration, PISD did not have a contract with BoardBook\n\nor SchoolCenter. Advantage Physical Therapy, Inc. v. Cruse, 165 S.W. 3d 21, 24\n\n(Tex.App.--Houston [14th Dist.], 2005 no pet.) (without consideration, there is no\n\ncontract).\n\n      For violation of TRCP 193.5, information concerning existence of\n\nBoardBook service in this case must be excluded from evidence. TRCP 193.6; See\n\nBoothe v. Hausler at 789.\n\n       Similarly, because PISD concealed the identity of SchoolCenter until the\n\ntrial and SchoolCenter’s alleged failure in transporting “link” to PISD website\n\nnotices, plaintiffs were severely harmed and compromised in examining evidence\n\nand questioning witnesses, and would have subpoenaed SchoolCenter at trial for\n\ntestimony had PISD timely supplemented and amended written discovery.\n\n      In both instances, the issues were dispositive and not cumulative because\n\nthey related to the controlling and central issue of PISD’s good faith under\n\n\n\n                                       29\n\f§551.056(d) and why the link to website notices was missing for at least 5 months\n\nin 2009. Boothe v. Hausler, at 789. The trial court should have excluded evidence\n\nconcerning SchoolCenter and BoardBook, alternatively should have granted\n\ncontinuance of the trial as requested by plaintiffs to conduct further discovery.\n\nTRCP 193.6(c). Transcript pgs,214-220.\n\n4. Plaintiffs are entitled to judgment in their favor or their motions for new\ntrial, to modify judgment, and for reconsideration should be granted\n\n      A. PISD lied to this Court that printing changes “created dates” of\ninternet notices in the first appeal\n\n      PISD lied to this Court in the first appeal that “created date” means the date\n\nthe “particular notice was printed for delivery to appellants.” Appendix19. Based\n\non this misrepresentation, this Court remanded this case. It has been six long years\n\nof lies from PISD.       In the trial of this case, PISD admitted that the above\n\ncontention was not true, but “oops” it was only a speculation.\n\n      “I was just trying to give some reasons why that might have happened.”\n\nLinder testimony, Transcript pg, 201.\n\n      Such misconduct mocks this Court, TOMA, and the discovery process.\n\nNothing PISD says after this can be credible in the slightest. PISD must be\n\nsanctioned for this lie and judgment entered for plaintiffs.\n\nB. PISD lied to this Court again about SchoolCenter and concealed\nSchoolCenter’s identity and central role in the first appeal\n\n\n\n\n                                          30\n\f      PISD lied to this Court again when it concealed the identity and the role of\n\nSchoolCenter, a vendor, from this Court in its brief in the First Appeal. In the brief\n\nbefore this Court, PISD blamed Jameson. See PISD’s brief in the First Appeal (07-\n\n10-00212-CV). Appendix11-Interrogatory5. But now PISD blames SchoolCenter\n\nfor losing the “link.” Even a soap opera cannot be this phony and ridiculous. Both\n\nJameson and SchoolCenter are agents of PISD. It has been six long years of lies\n\nfrom PISD. PISD must be sanctioned for this concealment and lie from this Court\n\nand judgment entered for plaintiffs.\n\nC.    SchoolCenter, BoardBook evidence must be excluded, PISD’s good faith\ndefense thus fails\n\n      Plaintiffs rely on and repeat Argument 3 as if fully set forth herein. As\n\nexplained above, evidence and information concerning SchoolCenter and\n\nBoardBook must be excluded and barred from evidence because PISD failed to\n\ntimely amend, supplement, or correct written discovery concerning them. TRCP\n\n193.6; Boothe, Id. At trial, PISD flip-flopped and blamed SchoolCenter for the\n\nmissing link to notices.     However both SchoolCenter and BoardBook being\n\nvendors employed by PISD are PISD’s agents. The only evidence presented for\n\nPISD’s good faith claim related to SchoolCenter’s role. Because all evidence or\n\ninformation concerning SchoolCenter must be excluded, PISD’s good faith claim\n\nmust be rejected.    Similarly, any portion of good faith claim that relies on\n\nBoardBook and Lee Carter must also fail because such information or evidence\n\n                                         31\n\fmust be excluded and is barred. TRCP 193.6, Boothe, Id. PISD’s good faith\n\ndefense under §551.056(d) fails.\n\nD.    Hearsay and Irrelevant evidence of Linder and Jameson must be barred\n\n      PISD has the burden to prove good faith under §551.056(d). Texas Rules of\n\nEvidence (TRE) bars evidence that is irrelevant and is not personal knowledge of\n\nthe witness. TRE 402, 602, 802. Linder and Jameson’s testimony on good faith\n\ndefense under §551.056(d) was complete hearsay. PISD presented no documentary\n\nevidence concerning SchoolCenter, BoardBook, called no expert witnesses in\n\nsupport of its claim of good faith either on document properties e.g. “created dates”\n\nof internet notices or the missing link issue.     No one from SchoolCenter or\n\nBoardBook testified in support of PISD’s good faith.\n\n      Linder made it clear that she has no personal knowledge regarding the claim\n\nof missing link. Transcript pg.191. Further, her entire testimony about good faith\n\ndefense was nothing more than her general opinions and beliefs concerning her\n\nwork in BoardBook software which is irrelevant under TOMA because\n\n§551.056(b) or any other section of TOMA does not require work in BoardBook.\n\nTOMA requires concurrent internet notices to be posted on government body’s\n\nwebsite. §551.056(b). Linder admitted that she never clicked on the link on\n\nPISD’s website to verify that internet notices appeared for public viewing\n\n(Transcript pgs. 176-178) and does not know anything about created dates or\n\n\n\n                                         32\n\fAdobe PDF, she does not even know the name of SchoolCenter. Thus Linder’s\n\nentire testimony concerning her bare assertions about her “work” in BoardBook\n\nmust be struck and excluded from evidence as irrelevant, hearsay, and hearsay\n\nwithin hearsay. TRE 402, 602, 802.             Jameson’s testimony about what\n\nSchoolCenter did or did not do concerning the link is classic hearsay. TRE 402,\n\n602, 802. Transcript pgs.126-157; Appendix15. Her testimony was a sham and a\n\ncover-up to shield her when she removed the link because she thought it was not\n\nneeded. Appendix16. She could not even recall the name of the person she\n\nsupposedly worked with on the new website project that supposed to have\n\ntransferred PISD’s “thousands” of links. Transcript pg.133. Jameson admitted she\n\nhas no knowledge or expertise in website operations. Transcript pg.129. Under\n\nTRE, her testimony is full of bare assertions on what SchoolCenter did or did not\n\ndo, or failed to do is classic hearsay, lacks personal knowledge, thus must be struck\n\nand excluded from evidence. Her testimony concerning what Lee Carter, the\n\nwebmaster, did or did not do must also be struck as hearsay and excluded. TRE\n\n402, 602, 802.\n\n      At best, Linder and Jameson’s testimonies about BoardBook and\n\nSchoolCenter’s role are bare assertions, too weak, no more than speculation,\n\nsurmise, hearsay and less than a scintilla of evidence, therefore are not legal\n\nevidence concerning good faith. Kindred, infra at 63. Linder and Jameson’s bare\n\n\n\n                                         33\n\fassertions often contradicting overwhelming evidence to the contrary5 are not legal\n\nevidence. Kindred, infra at 63 and further they do not meet clear and convincing\n\nstandard this government entity, PISD, must meet to establish its good faith under\n\n§551.056(d).\n\n       Evidence by Linder, Jameson, and Haenisch on good faith was bare\n\nassertions, hearsay, incompetent, speculative, and immaterial as to whether PISD\n\nexercised good faith concerning its non-compliance with §551.056(b). Thus the\n\nevidence they presented was no more than scintilla, surmise, and speculation which\n\nis not legal evidence.\n\n       When the evidence offered to prove a vital fact is so weak as to do no\n       more than create a mere surmise or suspicion of its existence, the\n       evidence is no more than a scintilla and, in legal effect, is no evidence\n       at all.\n\n       Kindred v. Con/Chem, Inc. 650 S.W.2d 61,63 (Tex. 1983).\n\n       Karen Linder’s testimony was a sham because she admitted that her sworn\n\nanswers to plaintiffs’ interrogatories were nothing but speculation and she did not\n\nhave knowledge about technical matters in question. PISD’s Linder falsely\n\nrepresented to the appeals court that printing PDF notices changed the created\n\ndates of website notices. Appendix19. PISD now states at trial that it was just\n\nspeculation on their part. SOF5. Karen Linder’s assertion that she “worked in\n\n\n5\n Jameson admits that she thought the link was not needed on the new website. Appendix16.\nShe removed the link in a maintenance update. Appendix11-Interrogatories 5,7.\n\n\n                                            34\n\fBoardBook” on her computer was no more than bare opinion as PISD presented no\n\nevidence that it actually had BoardBook service during the period in question i.e.\n\n1/2009 to 5/18/2009 or at any time from 8/13/2008 to 5/19/2009.\n\n       Thus Linder’s and Jameson’s testimonies on good faith issue are no legal\n\nevidence and must be disregarded as no material fact question was raised or\n\nanswered by their testimonies and because the Court was barred by rules of law or\n\nevidence from giving weight to the only evidence they offered (hearsay, bare\n\nopinion, and speculation) to prove a vital fact of good faith under TOMA.\n\nKindred, Id. PISD’s good faith claim must fail.\n\nE.     Plaintiffs were entitled to hearing on newly discovered evidence\n\n       Trial court erred in denying a hearing on newly discovered evidence and\n\nmotion for new trial. Plaintiffs demonstrate the existence of factors6 in Jackson and\n\nKirkpatrick for grant of new trial in this regard. Jackson v. Van Winkle, 660\n\nS.W.2d 807, 809-10 (Tex. 1983); Kirkpatrick v. Memorial Hosp., 862 S.W.2d 762,\n\n775 (Tex.App.-Dallas 1993, writ denied). The weight and importance of the newly\n\ndiscovered evidence here and its bearing with respect to evidence received at trial\n\n\n6\n The factors are: (i) the evidence came to light since the time of trial or so late in the trial that it\nwas impossible to present the evidence before the trial closed; (ii) it was not because of a lack of\ndue diligence that the information did not come sooner; (iii) the new evidence is not merely\ncumulative to that already given and does not tend only to impeach the adversary's testimony;\nand (iv) the evidence is so material that it would probably produce a different result if the court\ngranted a new trial. Jackson v. Van Winkle, 660 S.W.2d 807, 809-10 (Tex. 1983).\n\n\n\n                                                  35\n\fis conclusive and is so material that it will probably produce a different result in\n\nthis case:\n\n      1. PISD did not have good faith because it removed the link from its\n\nwebsite itself before the creation of new website by SchoolCenter and\n\nSchoolCenter had no role to play in the removal or reestablishing the link. SOF18.\n\n      2. PISD’s Jameson’s testimony at trial was misleading and false. The newly\n\ndiscovered evidence would show that PISD was aware of the removal of link and\n\nwillfully violated §551.056(b).\n\n      The appendices 2 through 5 to motion for new trial (Appendix 1) are PISD’s\n\nwebsite archive pages and view source information of PISD’s website as of the\n\ndates noted i.e. 1/26/2009 and 2/5/2009. View source pages identify the software\n\nthat generated PISD’s website pages viz. “Adobe GoLive” software for the OLD\n\nwebsite and “SchoolCenter” version 8.0 used for the NEW website.\n\n      The newly discovered evidence shows that\n\n      a. PISD concealed the fact that the link to internet notices did not exist on the\n\nOLD website which was managed by PISD itself. The appendices 2 and 3 of\n\nMotion for new trial (Appendix 1) show that PISD managed its website itself\n\nthrough January 26, 2009. PISD has admitted that the TOMA internet notice did\n\nnot appear on its website for its January 15, 2009 meeting because the link was\n\nremoved. The missing link problem started with the January 15, 2009 meeting\n\n\n\n                                          36\n\fnotice when PISD managed the website. There was no link to be transferred to the\n\nnew website which went live after 1/26/2009.\n\n      b. PISD’s OLD website was managed by its webmaster Lee Carter at least\n\nthrough January 26, 2009. Motion for new trial’s appendix 2 (bottom left corner)\n\nand appendix 3 (page 2 of the appendix) clearly identify Lee Carter as PISD’s\n\nwebmaster and show that Lee Carter as an employee had PISD’s business email\n\naddress. PISD used Adobe GoLive software at least up to January 26, 2009 and\n\nmaintained its own website well after the time it admitted that January 15, 2009\n\nmeeting notice did not appear on its website because link was removed when PISD\n\nmanaged its website itself.      The newly discovered evidence shows that\n\nSchoolCenter was not at “fault” as falsely alleged by PISD because as admitted by\n\nPISD the link did not exist on its website on or before 1/15/2009 causing non-\n\nappearance of the internet notice for 1/15/2009 board meeting. PISD removed the\n\nlink in 1/2009 because it thought it was not “necessary.” Appendix 16.\n\n      c. Thus it is obvious PISD’s Suzie Jameson fabricated a story and gave false\n\ntestimony (Appendix 1) blaming SchoolCenter when PISD itself removed the link\n\nin January 2009 or before, on its own watch, before the new website was allegedly\n\ncreated by SchoolCenter in February 2009 (Motion for New trial -appendices 4-5).\n\nThe problem of admitted non-compliance on January 15, 2009 existed before\n\nSchoolCenter allegedly created the new website which was in February 2009.\n\n\n\n                                        37\n\f      d.   PISD concealed Lee Carter’s (PISD’s Technology Director) role in\n\nmaintaining and generating PISD’s website during the time period it claims good\n\nfaith under §551.056(d).     Lee Carter’s name was not disclosed during the\n\ndiscovery process in violation of discovery rules as a person who had knowledge\n\nor any role in this concerning this lawsuit. Appendices 8-11. Lee Carter’s name\n\nappears as webmaster on PISD’s website on January 26, 2009 well after PISD\n\nadmitted that January 15, 2009 meeting notice did not appear on its website due to\n\nalleged link problem. Motion for new trial-appendices 2-3.\n\n      PISD failed to timely disclose and supplement, amend, or correct its\n\nresponses to written discovery, concerning the identity and role of SchoolCenter\n\nand Lee Carter until the trial, the above evidence could not be obtained before trial\n\nand is not cumulative. SchoolCenter and Lee Carter’s roles are material in PISD’s\n\ngood faith defense in §551.056(d). .\n\n      Plaintiff Thanedar testified as expert in technology matters pertinent to this\n\nlawsuit. The above evidence however is obvious to an average person. Plaintiffs\n\naffirm that “Adobe GoLive” was a software product of Adobe Systems Inc. and is\n\nan HTML editor used to maintain and manage websites by its customers. The\n\nword “Generator” in appendix 3 of motion for new trial means what it says i.e.\n\nPISD generated its website using Adobe GoLive.\n\n\n\n\n                                         38\n\f       Refusal to receive newly discovered evidence and refusal to grant new trial\n\nwould be manifest abuse of discretion and permanent loss of plaintiffs’ substantive\n\nrights. A new trial is thus required under law on the good faith claim by PISD and\n\nan evidentiary hearing was required by trial court to receive evidence in the above\n\nmatters which will affirm that PISD’s good faith claim was made in bad faith and\n\nis a fraud. This Court should grant new trial in this case.\n\nF. Missing link to notices is irrelevant because internet notices for 22\nMeetings were untimely created in May 2009 for posting on website weeks\nand months after meetings took place\n\n       The “missing link” to internet notices is a smokescreen and is not relevant.\n\nThe undisputed fact is that PISD untimely created internet notices in May 2009,\n\nweeks and months after the 22 Meetings took place and then posted them untimely\n\non its website all at once on 5/19/2009. Created date of an Adobe PDF document\n\nmeans what it says i.e. the date when the PDF document was created. Transcript\n\npgs.75-86. This is not disputed by PISD. PISD did not produce timely created\n\ninternet notices for 22 Meetings at trial, there is no evidence that they were timely\n\ncreated. Whether or not the link was missing, PISD never timely created internet\n\nnotices for each of the 22 Meetings 72 hours before each meeting started. Because\n\nPISD did not create timely internet notices and untimely posted them, PISD’s good\n\nfaith claim fails.\n\n\n\n\n                                          39\n\f         Because PISD did not care to check for each meeting notice whether its\n\nnotices actually appeared on its website or not, it does not show good faith under\n\n§551.056(d) and its good faith claim must be rejected.\n\nG. PISD did not care or attempt to check if the internet notices actually\nappeared on its website for public viewing for each of the 22 Meetings in 72\nhours before each meeting\n\n         TOMA requires that the internet notices must be concurrently posted on the\n\nGovernment body’s website 72 hours before the start of a meeting. §551.056(b).\n\nThe evidence is undisputed that PISD did not attempt to or care to check that\n\ninternet notices were actually appearing on its website and were available for\n\npublic viewing for any of the 22 Meetings in question. Transcript pgs. 176-178.\n\nAn average person would exercise such care to comply with law. A government\n\nbody should be held to even higher standard. PISD fails even the lower average\n\nperson standard. Thus PISD did not make a good faith attempt under 551.056(d)7\n\nto verify its compliance with §551.056(b). If PISD had done so, it would have\n\nimmediately known and found out that notices were not appearing on its website\n\nand PISD would have presumably fixed its non-compliance with TOMA.\n\n\n\n\n7\n    TOMA §551.056(d) provides that:\n“The validity of a posted notice of a meeting or an agenda by a governmental body or economic\ndevelopment corporation subject to this section that made a good faith attempt to comply with\nthe requirements of this section that is due to a technical problem beyond the control of the\ngovernmental body or economic development corporation.”\n\n\n                                             40\n\f      The language of TOMA is plain and clear that compliance with TOMA must\n\nbe done in the prescribed 72 hours before a meetings starts and must be\n\ncontinuous. §551.043. This requires that a government body must check for each\n\nmeeting that the internet notice actually appears on its website for public viewing.\n\nPISD’s intentional ignorance defeated the purpose of TOMA’s prescribed 72 hour-\n\nrequirement. §551.043; §551.056(b).\n\n      PISD’s intentional ignorance and conscious indifference is not good faith\n\nbecause it did not even once attempt or care to verify that notices actually appeared\n\non its website from 1/2009 to 5/19/2009 in compliance with §551.056(b). It must\n\nbe noted that for meeting notices from 1/2009 to 5/19/2009 for which PISD claims\n\ngood faith, there is no evidence that its website was not up and was not working\n\nnormally.   Haenisch testified the new website had no disruptions. Transcript\n\npg.117. Thousands of other links were working perfectly. Transcript pg.135.\n\nPISD showed intentional ignorance and cover-up to hide its violations of\n\n§551.056(b).\n\n      If this Court does not reverse trial court’s judgment, every government body\n\nintentionally or not, will “ignore” to exercise sufficient care to comply with TOMA\n\nfor months or years and still claim good faith and will be granted exception under\n\n§551.056(d), making a laughing stock out of Texas Open Meetings Act.\n\n\n\n\n                                         41\n\fH. “Oops we forgot,” mistake, negligence, or incompetence is not a technical\n\nproblem\n\n        There is no evidence or insufficient evidence that forgetting to transfer a link\n\nto new website is a “technical”8 problem. §551.056(d). Here, PISD claims that\n\nSchoolCenter made a mistake and did not transfer the link to notices to new\n\nwebsite. Transcript pg.149-150. Jameson testified that the problem was that of a\n\n“missing link.” Transcript pg.149. Even if true, forgetting or making a mistake is\n\nnot a technical problem. There is no evidence that there was anything wrong with\n\nthe link itself. PISD presented no evidence that mistake is a technical problem. To\n\nthe contrary, Jameson herself testified that adding a link on the new website is not\n\ndifficult. Transcript pg.150. Jameson further testified the problem with the link\n\nwas just a “plain and simple oversight.” Jameson refused to even call the oversight\n\na “technical” problem even when prodded by plaintiffs. Transcript pg.150. Thus\n\noversight, negligence or “Oops we forgot” is not a technical problem under\n\nTOMA.\n\nI. “Oops we forgot” to transfer a link is not “beyond the control” of PISD\n\n\n\n\n8\n  Collins English Dictionary – Complete and Unabridged, HarperCollins Publishers, 2003 defines\n“technical” as 1) of, relating to, or specializing in industrial, practical, or mechanical arts and applied\nsciences.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    42\n\f         Even if forgetting to copy or transfer link is a technical problem, there is no\n\nevidence or insufficient evidence that transferring a link to new website was\n\n“beyond the control” of PISD for 5 long months from 1/2009 to 5/19/2009.\n\n§551.056(d). Jameson testified that failure to transfer the link in question was a\n\n“plain and simple oversight” and that it was not difficult. Transcript pgs.149-150.\n\n         Earthquake, snow, rain, hacking and virus attacks are beyond the control of a\n\ngovernment body while these events last.             Forgetting to verify mandatory\n\ncompliance with TOMA for 5 months is most certainly not “beyond the control” of\n\na school district. To suggest otherwise is an insult and fraud on citizens and\n\ntaxpayers of Texas. There is conclusive overwhelming evidence that the link\n\nproblem in question would have been fixed had PISD checked its new website just\n\nonce in 5 months as to whether legally required internet notices were actually\n\nappearing on its new website, but PISD did not do so. SOF21 and 23. All PISD\n\nneeded to do was to get off the chair and check that the link was transferred and\n\nfurther check that the legal meeting notices were actually appearing on its website\n\nfor public viewing. PISD has admitted that it never showed interest and due care\n\nto comply with §551.056(b). SOF21, 23, Transcript pg.146. PISD’s missing link\n\nwas neither a technical problem nor beyond its control. PISD’s good faith defense\n\nfails.\n\n\n\n\n                                            43\n\f      Here, PISD decided it was not going to comply with TOMA 551.056(b), but\n\ngot caught.    There is overwhelming evidence that PISD showed conscious\n\nindifference at best, or bad faith and fraudulent misconduct concerning its legal\n\nduty to comply with TOMA Sec. 551.056(b).\n\n      Jameson’s sham testimony\n\n      Jameson gave false testimony concerning SchoolCenter at trial to avoid\n\nblame on herself. PISD had admitted that Jameson performed duties with respect\n\nto “establishing BoardBook link” on PISD’s new website and not SchoolCenter.\n\nAppendix 16. Jameson’s May 19, 2009 E mail to Linder (Appendix 16) clearly\n\nstates (Emphasis provided):\n\n        I apologize for not having that link on the site. I have added it\n        on the School Board page. There were lots of things that were\n        on the old site that I did not realize needed to go on the new\n        one.\n\n      It is abundantly clear from the above email that PISD and Jameson knew\n\nabout the “link” but did not think it was “needed” on the new website. In written\n\ndiscovery PISD blamed Jameson for “severing” the link in a “maintenance\n\nupdate.” Appendix11-Interrogatories 5, 7. Jameson’s new testimony at trial is\n\ndiametrically contradictory with PISD’s written discover. Both are not credible.\n\nAs a result, Jameson dropped the “link” to BoardBook on PISD’s new website in\n\nJanuary 2009. This can only be described as a mistake, error or negligence, or lack\n\nof due care and diligence, or properly as willful disregard for compliance with\n\n                                        44\n\fTOMA for 5 months. There was no “severance” of the link, no “maintenance\n\nupdate” that “severed” the link, or “inadvertent” mistake here as Jameson clearly\n\nknew about the link and PISD and Jameson decided it was not needed on the new\n\nwebsite and therefore Jameson did not establish it on the new website.\n\nAppendix16. As a matter of law, negligence or lack of due care and diligence by a\n\nperson is not a “technical” problem as the word technical is commonly understood,\n\nand certainly not “beyond the control” of PISD. All PISD had to do was to check\n\nits own website to verify that Board meeting notices were “appearing” on its\n\nwebsite, as a reasonable person would have done. PISD failed to exercise this\n\nreasonable care for 5 months and at least 11 Meetings. PISD fails reasonable care\n\nstandard, which is never beyond PISD’s control.\n\n5. PISD’s good faith claim is a fraud on the citizens and tax payers and courts\nrequiring sanctions\n\n      PISD has obstructed discovery from the beginning concerning BoardBook\n\nand SchoolCenter. PISD lied to the Texas Attorney General and to this Court and\n\nsimply refused to provide documents concerning BoardBook and SchoolCenter to\n\nplaintiffs calling them “beyond the scope of TRCP.” SOF They knew they could\n\nget away with it. SOF6.\n\n      The alleged problem of “link” was only fixed when plaintiff Thanedar\n\nreported nonappearance of notices on 5/15/2009 to PISD in good faith. Appendix\n\n11-Interrogatory 7. Without plaintiffs’ report in good faith, PISD could have\n\n                                       45\n\fcontinued for several more months, or years, or even indefinitely without\n\ncomplying with Sec. 551.056.\n\nPost-remand discovery\n\n      Trial court erred in denying post-remand discovery on good faith. Post-\n\nremand discovery was consistent with the opinion and mandate of this Court. This\n\nis especially important for TOMA because post-remand discovery would have\n\ndiscovered that PISD’s contention that printing changes “created dates” of PDF\n\ndocuments was a fraud on this Court and citizens. Denying post-remand discovery\n\nonly shielded PISD and its obstruction of justice.\n\n      6. Denial of plaintiffs’ evidence led to rendition of incorrect judgment:\n\nThe Court failed to rule on admissibility of plaintiffs’ exhibit PX1 in the one day\n\ntrial excluding it from evidence. PX1 contains 22 board meeting website notices at\n\nissue in this lawsuit and their electronic document properties on Compact Disc.\n\nPlaintiffs rely on facts and argument in Argument 8 below regarding PX1. There\n\nwas no objection by defendant. This exhibit was admitted and authenticated by\n\nJudge Waters before and was reviewed by this Court in the first appeal and the\n\nuntimely “created dates” were central in determining PISD’s good faith. The CD in\n\nquestion is in the record and the record thereon has been reviewed on appeal by the\n\nappeals court. The Court clearly abused its discretion when it refused to rule on\n\nadmissibility of PX1 and thereby ignored the electronic properties of internet\n\n\n\n                                         46\n\fnotices leading to incorrect judgment. As PX1 and its electronic properties are\n\ncentral to violation of TOMA Sec. 551.056 and all other causes of action in\n\nplaintiffs’ live pleadings. Denial of PX1 caused rendition of incorrect judgment as\n\nthe untimely created dates of internet notices would have shown that PISD created\n\nthe internet notices weeks after the 22 meetings took place and untimely posted\n\nthem on 5/19/2009. This would show that PISD’s missing link good faith defense\n\nwas a fraud because the internet notices were not even created concurrently and\n\ntimely. Trial court erred in not ruling on PX1. It should have been admitted.\n\n      Further, trial court erred in denying admission of PX13 which is audio tapes\n\nof 3/26/2009 meeting that shows violation of 551.101, and 551.074(b) which are\n\ncauses of action in this lawsuit and directly relevant, resulting in court’s failing to\n\nrule on the above claims. PX13 should have been admitted.\n\n      Trial court erred in denying admission of PX12(notices of meetings) which\n\nconcerned violation of 551.043, PX14 (excerpt of transcript 3/26/2009 meeting),\n\nconcerned violation of 551.101, PX19(back pay benefits) and PX25(salary\n\nschedules) concerned claim of back pay and special damages, and PX21(sales tax\n\nreceipts) concerned the issue of standing), all central and relevant to TOMA issues.\n\nDenial of this evidence resulted in rendition of incorrect judgment on these issues.\n\nThe above exhibits should have been admitted into evidence.\n\n\n\n\n                                          47\n\f      Trial court’s judgment should be reversed and judgment entered for\n\nplaintiffs. Minimally, plaintiffs’ motions for new trial, to modify judgment, for\n\nreconsideration, and the request for amended and additional FOF and COL should\n\nbe granted on all causes of action.\n\n7. Attorney fee award to PISD is invalid and is not reasonable. PISD\nforfeited and waived attorney fees when it refused to testify\n\n      The trial court committed clear error in granting $30,000 in attorney fees to\n\nPISD by taking “judicial notice of the file” under TOMA. Appendices20, 21.\n\n      Texas law has not allowed recovery of attorney fees unless allowed by\n\nstatute or contract. “Absent a contract or statute, trial courts do not have inherent\n\nauthority to require a losing party to pay the prevailing party’s fees.” Tony Gullo\n\nMotors v. Chapa, 212 S.W.3d 299, 310-311 (Tex. 2006). Nothing in TOMA or its\n\npertinent case authority authorizes or empowers any court to take judicial notice of\n\nattorney fees and to award them without receiving evidence with respect to the\n\nattorney fees and their reasonableness. TOMA §551.142.\n\n      Plaintiffs challenge both the imposition and award of the attorney fees to\n\nPISD on the grounds that 1) PISD is not the substantially prevailing party, 2) the\n\naward of attorney fees is neither legally valid, nor proper, unjust, nor justified in\n\nthis case, and 3) the attorney fee award is not reasonable, manifestly too large and\n\nfurther, PISD forfeited and waived any attorney fees by refusing to testify.\n\n\n\n\n                                         48\n\f        PISD is not the substantially prevailing party:                       PISD is not the\n\nsubstantially prevailing party under TOMA§551.142(b) and cannot be awarded\n\nattorney fees. This is because trial court shockingly refused and failed to try 7\n\nCauses out of eight independent and distinct causes of action or main issues under\n\nTOMA sections 551.041, 551.043, 551.045(d), 551.051, 551.074, 551.101, and\n\n551.142(a) and further failed to rule and make finding of fact or conclusions of law\n\nwith respect to each of the above 7 above causes of action. Appendices 20,21.9\n\nThus PISD did not prevail on 7 out 8 separate and distinct causes of action or main\n\nissues and is not a substantially prevailing party. Hawkins v. Ehler, Infra at 544.\n\nAward of attorney fees to PISD is invalid and unreasonable\n\n       Under TOMA only reasonable attorney fees can be granted if certain\n\nconditions are met. §551.142(2). The reasonableness of attorneys' fees is question\n\nof fact that must be proven at the trial. City of Garland v. Dallas Morning News, 22\n\nS.W.3d 351, 367 (Tex. 2000). Thus PISD was required to testify concerning its\n\nattorney fees.\n\nPISD forfeited and waived attorney fees by refusing to testify and prove them\n\n       PISD refused and failed to testify on its attorney fees and refused and failed\n\nto prove them at trial even after Judge Lopez prompted PISD’s counsel to do so.\n9\n  Plaintiffs objected to this misconduct and brought this to trial court’s attention during trial and\nin motions. Appendices1,2,3,4. With 7 out of 8 causes of action never taken to trial and never\ndecided, Judge Lopez’s judgment is not final judgment in spite of the words used in it. Because\nthis was a deliberate conduct on Judge Lopez’s part, no implied findings can be made or\npresumed here. Appellants ask this Court to rule on all causes of action in this appeal.\n\n\n                                                 49\n\fTranscript Page 238. Thus there is no valid application for attorney fees here.\n\nFurther, it must be concluded that PISD forfeited and waived any claim to attorney\n\nfees by refusing and failing to prove and testify on its attorney fees. Thus there is\n\nno evidence or insufficient evidence in the record for the Court to award attorney\n\nfees to PISD of any amount. Court’s award of $30,000 has no basis in law under\n\nTOMA or evidence because there is no evidence or insufficient evidence of tasks\n\ncompleted, hours worked, level of difficulty, identity of attorneys, reasonable\n\nhourly rates of attorneys on the case and other necessary information on which\n\nattorney fees must be based on. See El Apple v. Olivas, Infra.\n\n      No “Judicial Notice of file” for attorney fees under TOMA: The plain\n\nand clear language of §551.142(b) does not permit trial judge to impose attorney\n\nfees by taking “judicial notice.”    It is clearly ascertainable that the award of\n\nattorney fees in this case does not arise under Texas Civil Practice and Remedies\n\nCode (CPRC) §38.001, thus this Court does not have power to take judicial notice\n\nof attorney fees under CPRC§38.004. See Valdez v. Valdez, 930 S.W.2d 725, 732-\n\n33 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 1996, no writ) (holding §38.004 only applies to\n\nclaims under §38.001).\n\n      Plaintiffs have proven their good faith in this case:\n\n      Attorney fees award here is legally improper because plaintiffs have\n\nundisputedly proven their good faith at the trial as their report of the violation of\n\n\n\n                                         50\n\fSec. 551.056(b) was the only reason said violation was finally corrected by PISD\n\nafter 5 months of admitted10 non-compliance with TOMA from 1/2009 to\n\n5/19/2009.     Appendix11 (Interrogatory7).         Further plaintiffs prevailed on first\n\nappeal in this case, this Court reversing trial court’s judgment and remanding the\n\ncase which proves conclusively that this lawsuit was in fact brought in good faith.\n\nSee §551.142(b). PISD did not claim nor produced any evidence or insufficient\n\nevidence of bad faith on appellants’ part at trial.\n\n     “Voluminous filings” is not bad faith and Plaintiffs cannot be penalized\nby imposing attorney fees for them\n\n       As explained in this brief, There is no factual evidence or legal basis\n\nwhatsoever for Judge Lopez’s erroneous FOF20 and COL4. Appellants do not\n\nshow bad faith because of “voluminous” filings. Even assuming filings are\n\nvoluminous, appellants cannot be penalized for them as there is no evidence that\n\nany filing was improper or unreasonable. Further, this argument is bogus and\n\nirrational because there is no evidence whatsoever that PISD ever incurred attorney\n\nfees due to filing responses, and Judge Lopez never held hearings and never ruled\n\non them. There is no cost or harm here to PISD.\n\n       Appellants have constitutional right to sue in court and file motions which is\n\nan aspect of the First Amendment right to petition the Government for redress of\n\n10\n   The document properties of PISD’s website notices prove that internet notices for 11 notices\nfrom 8/2008 to 12/2008 were also created in May 2009 and posted for public viewing on\n5/19/2009 after plaintiffs brought the non-compliance with 551.056(b) to PISD’s attention.\n\n\n                                              51\n\fgrievances. Justice Sandra Day O’Connor has noted “this right to petition is one\n\nof the most precious of the liberties safeguarded by the Bill of Rights.” Justice\n\nO’Connor further observed that the First Amendment petition clause says nothing\n\nabout success in petitioning. Thus there is absolutely nothing wrong in filing\n\nmotions and requesting relief that Judge Lopez rule on such motions.             Thus\n\nappellants cannot be penalized for filing motions, voluminous or not, in this\n\nlawsuit to redress grievances. See BE&K Construction v. NLRB, 536 U.S.516\n\n(2002); Bill Johnson’s Restaurants, Inc. v. NLRB, 461 U.S.731 (1983). Thus,\n\n“filings”, even if “voluminous,” are not “bad faith” under TOMA and plaintiffs\n\ncannot be punished with attorney fees for them.\n\n      Further Judge Lopez sitting by assignment has no personal knowledge of all\n\nof the proceedings in this case, being the third judge in this case after Judge Waters\n\nand Judge Vanderpool.\n\n      PISD does not meet prerequisites for attorney fees:        PISD never claimed\n\nthe element of bad faith on plaintiffs’ part which is a prerequisite for attorney fees\n\nunder TOMA §551.142(b), and further, notably, never presented any evidence at\n\nthe trial on the issue. PISD did not plead for attorney fees in its original answer-its\n\namended answer must be struck because it lacks a certificate of service and was\n\nnot served on plaintiffs. See CR285 which is not a certificate of service for the\n\namended answer but a duplicate of CR281(response to previous motion). Because\n\n\n\n                                          52\n\fPISD failed to claim bad faith and failed to present evidence on it, failed to plead\n\nfor attorney fees, it waived attorney fees and the issue of bad faith, thus cannot\n\nrecover attorney fees under §551.142(b) in this case. Nothing under law or TOMA\n\njurisprudence gives trial court the authority or power to advocate for PISD which\n\nfailed to meet prerequisites to attorney fees. The award to PISD must be vacated\n\nand denied.\n\n      Attorney fees for appellate filings must be vacated and denied: Judge\n\nLopez apparently granted attorney fees because plaintiffs made voluminous\n\nappellate filings-though he failed to segregate the amount. Appendices20,21. The\n\ntrial court has no power whatsoever to impose attorney fees for any proceedings or\n\nfilings in the appellate courts, with or without evidence being received. In fact,\n\nplaintiffs prevailed in the first appeal and this Court ordered that defendant pay\n\ncosts to Terrell for the appeal. Thus no attorney fees are due to PISD in the first\n\nappeal. PISD made no argument nor presented any evidence concerning this issue\n\nat trial and did not testify about its time and attorney fees incurred in this regard.\n\nThus there is no basis in law or fact for an award of attorney fees for plaintiffs’\n\nfilings in appeals court.\n\nHas TOMA’s “Sunshine” gone away?\n\n      Further plaintiffs do not have the ability to pay any attorney fees, thus award\n\nis not reasonable under TOMA’s lofty purpose of “sunshine law.” TOMA was\n\n\n\n                                         53\n\fheralded as the “Sunshine Law” to protect Texas citizens after the shockingly\n\ncorrupt scandals of Sharpstown. The deliberate arbitrary award indicates that\n\nJudge Lopez wielded TOMA as a sword to silence appellants and any future\n\ncitizens that dare to question a government body. This will have a chilling effect\n\non citizens and taxpayers who report violations of TOMA and seek redress.\n\n      Statutory attorney fees are not a “Bonanza”\n\n      Chief Justice Nathan Hecht has made it clear that an award of statutory\n\nattorney fees, as here, is not a “Bonanza,” but its amount and reasonableness is a\n\nquestion of fact and must be proven by a party at trial on factors such as reasonable\n\nrate, contract, billing records, fees paid by client, tasks performed, and hours\n\nworked. See El Apple v. Olivas, 370 S.W.3d 757 (Tex. 2012) citing the eight-\n\nfactor test in Arthur Andersen & Co. v. Perry Equip. Corp., 945 S.W.2d 812, 818\n\n(Tex. 1997); City of Laredo v. Monsanto, 414 S.W.3d 731 (Tex. 2013). Here, the\n\narbitrary and capricious award of statutory attorney fees of $30,000 to PISD by\n\nJudge Lopez without absolutely any substantiation as to the reasonableness is so\n\ngrossly in defiance of the overwhelming weight of law and the Texas Supreme\n\nCourt opinions that its only purpose was to intimidate pro se plaintiffs, obstruct,\n\nand prevent these pro se citizens from appealing this case and airing PISD’s dirty\n\nlaundry.\n\n\n\n\n                                         54\n\f       Violation of constitutional right of due process: An attorney fees award\n\nbased on no evidence or insufficient evidence of existence and reasonableness of\n\nattorney fees viz. identity of attorneys, hours worked, tasks performed, quality and\n\ndifficulty of work, hourly rate and other factors laid out by the Supreme Court in\n\nEl Apple violates plaintiffs’ constitutional rights of due process and equal\n\nprotection under Texas Constitution and 14th Amendment to the Unites States\n\nConstitution.     The award is arbitrary, capricious, manifestly too large and\n\nunreasonable imposition of attorney fees that has no support in law.\n\n       The judgment and the award of attorney fees of $30,000 and costs should be\n\nvacated and denied.\n\n8. Judge Lopez was disqualified from conducting trial\n\n       Disqualification11 can be raised at any time and for the first time on appeal,\n\nas here, and even in a motion for rehearing. See Buckholts Indep. Sch. Dist. V.\n\nGlaser, 632 S.W.2d 146, 148 (Tex. 1982).\n\n       Judge Lopez was disqualified from sitting in this case and was disqualified\n\nfrom conducting the final trial on 10/9/2013. The standard of review for the Court\n\nin this matter is de novo. See McElwee v.McElwee, 911 S.W.2d 182, 185-87 (Tex.\n\nApp.--Houston [1st Dist.]1995, writ denied).\n\n11\n  The original source for disqualification in Texas is the constitution. Article V, Section 11\nenumerates the circumstances in which a judge is disqualified from sitting in a case. TEX.\nCONST. art. V, § 11. The grounds have essentially been restated in TRCP 18(b)(a).\n\n\n                                             55\n\f      Judge Lopez conducted a meaningless trial on 10/9/2013 and rigged it in\nfavor of defendant:\n\n      Judge Lopez repeatedly failed to rule on trial exhibit PX1 during the trial\n\ninspite of numerous requests by plaintiffs in the one day trial. Transcript pages34,\n\n37, 44, 74, and 204. Defendant never made an objection to PX1. Judge Lopez’s\n\nmisconduct in failing to rule on PX1 has caused serious and permanent harm to\n\nplaintiffs in this case. This was an exhibit which was reviewed by the 7th court of\n\nappeals in the first appeal and formed the basis of the opinion and the reason for\n\nremand in the first appeal by the court of appeals.12 Appendix19. Thus PX1 was a\n\ncritical exhibit at the trial and should have been admitted by trial court. Judge\n\nLopez’s failure to rule on admissibility of PX1 was deliberate and a gross disregard\n\nof his judicial duty resulting in a deliberate damage done to plaintiffs’ case and\n\nobstruction of appeal.\n\n      The outcome was that the trial was a charade and was infected with chaos\n\nand confusion, and plaintiffs were prevented from properly and effectively\n\npresenting their case at trial concerning the deliberate violations of electronic\n\nwebsite internet notices of PISD’s meeting notices and concerning untimeliness of\n\nwebsite notices of 22 Meetings under TOMA §551.056(b) and PISD’s lack of good\n\nfaith under TOMA Sec. 551.056(d).\n12\n  This Court has confirmed that PISD indeed was untimely in creating and posting internet\nnotices in violation of TOMA §551.056(b) for 22 meetings in 2008-2009. These 22 electronic\nnotices and their electronic properties are contained in PX1. Appendix19.\n\n\n                                           56\n\f      PX1 was the cornerstone and basis of not only proving the untimeliness of\n\nthe website notices but proving that PISD’s claim of good faith defense was\n\nfraudulent because the internet notices of 22 notices were created in May 2009 and\n\nposted to website for public viewing on 5/19/2005 after plaintiffs informed PISD\n\nof its non-compliance with §551.056(b). Judge Lopez’s refusal to even rule on\n\nadmissibility of trial exhibit PX1 was purposeful, calculated, and inexcusable\n\nabdication of duty that derailed the entire case of plaintiffs. Further his refusal to\n\nrule on PX1 damaged appellants’ case as they were prevented and unable to\n\npresent their case properly without the critical exhibit PX1 which was central to the\n\ntrial in showing that PISD did not have a good faith defense and that such defense\n\nwas fraudulent i.e. the create dates of the internet notices on PX1 showed that the\n\nnotices were created untimely in violation of TOMA weeks after the meetings in\n\nquestion took place.\n\n      Failure to conduct trial or rule on 7 Causes: Plaintiffs rely on Argument\n\n1 which is set forth verbatim herein. Judge Lopez deliberately improperly failed to\n\ntry plaintiffs’ 7 Causes of action under TOMA and abdicated his independent duty\n\nto try and rule on 7 Causes. Such misconduct brings disrepute to justice system\n\nand violated plaintiffs’ absolute due process constitutional rights. Neither the\n\ndistrict court nor the appeals court has the power to order that plaintiffs’ causes of\n\naction cannot be tried.\n\n\n\n                                         57\n\f       What kind of judge returns evidence filed in the court?\n\n       Trial court conducted an evidentiary hearing ordered by this Court on lost or\n\ndestroyed exhibits on 9/26/2014 to determine fault in the matter.                      Plaintiffs\n\nsubmitted documentary evidence to Judge Lopez in the hearing.13 However, Judge\n\nLopez ordered court reporter to return the evidence to plaintiffs after receiving it in\n\nopen court.       The visiting court reporter mailed the evidence to plaintiffs.\n\nAppendix17.\n\n       What kind of judge returns evidence presented in an evidentiary hearing\n\nordered by this Court? But Judge Lopez did. Such misconduct shows that Judge\n\nLopez lacks judicial temperament, carried animus and bias against plaintiffs, and\n\nadvocated for defendant, and was unfit to preside at the trial in this case. His\n\nconduct and its severity were not known until after trial on 10/9/2013.\n\n       Bias that denies due process In McClenan v. State, 661 S.W.2d 108, 109\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1983) the Court of Criminal Appeals held that in criminal cases\n\nbias might be grounds for legal disqualification if that bias was “shown to be of\n\nsuch a nature and to such an extent as to deny a defendant due process of law.”\n\n       Due process is recognized in civil as well as the criminal context. Following\n\nMcClenan ruling in 1983, various Texas appeals courts have recognized McClenan\n\n\n13\n  Curiously, Judge Lopez took possession of all trial exhibits (Transcript page 56) and exhibits\nPX1, PX32, PX19, PX20, and PX25 were lost or destroyed and had to be replaced through\nanother remand and hearing in this case.\n\n\n                                               58\n\fand applied the “bias that denies due process” as bias that materially implicates\n\n“personal interest,” therefore meeting constitutional grounds for disqualification\n\nunder Texas Constitution. See Elam v. State, 841 S.W.2d 937, 939 (Tex. App.--\n\nAustin 1992, no pet.) (recognizing McClenan); Lovely v. State, 894 S.W.2d 99,103\n\n(Tex. App. --Beaumont 1995, pet. ref’d) (same); Stafford v. State, 948 S.W.2d 921,\n\n924 (Tex. App.--Texarkana 1997, pet. ref’d) (same).\n\n      Thus when a judge’s bias is of such nature and extent that it denies a party\n\ndue process of law, as here, the judge must be disqualified under Texas\n\nconstitutional grounds.\n\n      Here, Judge Lopez’s bias and conduct was unprecedented and shocking as\n\nhe deliberately set out to harm pro se plaintiffs and conduct a sham trial. Such\n\nconduct lowers citizens’ regard and confidence in the integrity of judges and the\n\njustice system. The due process violations outlined in this motion require Judge\n\nLopez’s disqualification from the trial on 10/9/2013.\n\n      Judge Lopez was not neutral, but was advocate for PISD and casting himself\n\nin adversarial role against plaintiffs causing damage to plaintiffs’ case –depriving\n\nthem of causes of action and in ensuring their loss at trial. Judge Lopez was\n\ndisqualified from conducting trial in this case.\n\n      9. Voidance and Special damages:\n\n\n\n\n                                          59\n\f      PISD’s actions in 22 Meetings held in violation of TOMA should be voided.\n\nCourts have repeatedly voided actions in violation of TOMA. Ferris v. Texas\n\nBoard of Chiropractic Examiners, Supra; City of Bells v. Greater Texoma Uti!.\n\nAuth., 744 S.W.2d 636,640 (Tex. App.-Dallas 1987, no writ); Point Isabel ISD v.\n\nHinojosa, 797 S.W.2d 176 (Tex.App-Corpus Christ 1990, writ denied).\n\nPISD’s willful defiance, misconduct, and a systematic pattern and practice of\n\nTOMA violations require that special damages and sanctions be imposed on PISD.\n\n      Courts have imposed special damages, as requested here, for conscious\n\nindifference and failure to comply with the Open Meetings Act, as in this case on\n\ndefendant’s part. See Wells v. Hutchinson, 499 F.Supp. 174, 198 (E.D. Tex. 1980).\n\nSpecial damages in the amount to be determined by the Court should be granted to\n\nplaintiffs. Plaintiffs will produce details of hours and money spent at Court’s\n\ndirection in this regard.\n\n                                  V. CONCLUSION\n\n      A famous U.S. President once asked his opponents “do you think we are\n\nstupid?” Citizens ask the same question to PISD. Defendant expects these pro se\n\ncitizens will be long gone and forgotten. Defendant is mistaken. Appellants think\n\nTexas citizens and tax payers will be interested in this case and will insist that their\n\ngovernment bodies function in exact and literal compliance with TOMA and that\n\ntheir complaints will be heard.\n\n\n\n                                          60\n\f      This court should not let citizens stand outside a school building in\n\nhumiliation just to read meeting notices in rain, snow, heat, and in poor lighting.\n\nThis Court should enforce exact and literal compliance standard or declare it dead.\n\n      The sky will not fall if PISD ratifies its actions in violation of Open\n\nMeetings Act inspite of what PISD claims. This Court should reverse trial court’s\n\njudgment and enter judgment for plaintiffs on all causes of action.\n\n                                   VI.

In doing\n\nso, appellants would further ask that the Court AWARD appellants the costs of this\n\nappeal and costs incurred in the district court.\n\n      Appellants request the Court GRANT declaratory and injunctive relief in all\n\ncauses of action whether or not any other relief is granted. Appellants further pray\n\nfor all other and further relief to which they may justly be entitled to receive.\n\n                                        Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                        /s/ Rebecca Terrell\n\n                                        Rebecca Terrell\n                                       /s/ Chandrashekhar Thanedar\n\n                                        Chandrashekhar Thanedar\n                                        Appellants\n\n                              Certificate of Compliance\n      I certify that the foregoing brief complies with Tex.

Plaintiffs rely on the following Appendices which are adopted and incorporated by\n\n         reference as if set forth verbatim herein.\n\n                Appendix 1      Suzie Jameson testimony.

Attached.\n\n                Plaintiffs' trial exhibits are denoted as PX followed by the exhibit number.\n\n                2. On October 9, 2013, the Court held trial only on plaintiffs' cause of action in Texas\n\n         Open Meetings Act (TOMA), Texas Gov't Code §551.056 (b) and (d) and declined to hold trial\n\n         on other six causes of action in TOMA Sections 551.041, 551.043, 551.045, 551.051, 551.074,\n\n         551.101. See original petition and two supplemental petitions filed in this case. The Court\n\n         signed judgment on 10/25/2013 and awarded costs and attorney fees of $30,000 by taking\n\n\n\n                                                       332\n\f•   333\n\n\n\n\n    judicial notice of the file. PISD refused to testify at the trial on its attorney fees, but asked the\n\n    Court to take judicial notice of attorney fees.\n\n            3. For the first time at trial, in violation of discovery rules, PISD disclosed that a \"third\n\n    party vendor\" was involved in transferring the link to its website notices on BoardBook. In\n\n    addition, for the first time at trial, in violation of discovery rules, PISD disclosed the identity of\n\n    the third party vendor - \"SchoolCenter\" which created a \"new website\" for PISD allegedly in\n\n    January 2009 and       allegedly failed to transfer said link to the new website causing non-\n\n    appearance of website notices from January 15, 2009 meeting to May 19, 2009 meeting. See\n\n    Appendix 1; PX 8-11.\n\n            Appendices 2 through 5 are PISD's website archive pages and view source information\n\n    of PISD's website as of the dates noted i.e. 1126/2009 and 2/5/2009, in the archive and view\n\n    source pages.     View source pages state software that generated PISD's website pages viz.\n\n    \"Adobe GoLive\" software for the OLD website and \"SchoolCenter\" version 8.0 used for the\n\n    NEW website. The newly discovered evidence clearly shows that PISD purposefully gave false\n\n    and misleading testimony at trial and in its answers to interrogatories and responses to other\n\n    discovery requests. PX 8-11; Appendix 1.\n\n            PISD concealed and falsified the dispositive facts that:\n\n            a. Said link in question did not exist on the OLD website which was managed by PISD\n\n    itself through January 26, 2009. PISD has admitted that the TOMA internet notice did not\n\n    appear on its website for its January 15, 2009 meeting because the link was removed. See PX 8-\n\n    11; Appendix 2, 3.\n\n            b. PISD's OLD website was managed by its webmaster Lee Carter at least through\n\n    January 26, 2009. Appendix 2 (bottom left comer) and Appendix 3 (page 2 of the appendix)\n\n\n\n\n    Motion for New Trial                    Cause No. 35621                           Page2 of24\n                                                      333\n\f334\n\n\n\n\nclearly identify Lee Carter as PISD's webmaster and show that Lee Carter as an employee or\n\ncontractor had PISD's business email address. PISD used Adobe GoLive software at least up to\n\nJanuary 26, 2009 and maintained its own website well after the time it admitted that January 15,\n\n2009 meeting notice did not appear on its website because link was removed when PISD\n\nmanaged its website itself. The newly discovered evidence shows that SchoolCenter was not at\n\n\"fault\" as falsely alleged by PISD because as admitted by PISD the link did not exist on its\n\nwebsite on or before 1115/2009 causing non-appearance of the internet notice for 1/15/2009\n\nboard meeting.\n\n        c. Thus it is obvious PISD's Suzie Jameson fabricated a story and gave false testimony\n\n(Appendix 1) blaming SchoolCenter when PISD itself removed the link in January 2009 or\n\nbefore, on its own watch, before the new website was allegedly generated by SchoolCenter in\n\nFebruary 2009 (Appendices 4-5).\n\n        d. PISD concealed Lee Carter's (PISD's Technology Director) role in maintaining and\n\ngenerating PISD's website during the time period it claims good faith under 551.056(d). Lee\n\nCarter's name was not disclosed during the discovery process in violation of discovery rules as a\n\nperson who had knowledge or any role in this concerning this lawsuit. PX 8-11. Lee Carter's\n\nname appears as webmaster on PISD's website on January 26, 2009 well after PISD admitted\n\nthat January 15, 2009 meeting notice did not appear on its website due to alleged link problem.\n\nAppendices 2-3.\n\n        The above newly discovered evidence is not cumulative and it could not be obtained\n\nbefore as the existence and identity of the \"third party vendor\" was concealed before, not\n\ndisclosed until during the trial on 10/9/2013.      Lee Carter's identity as a webmaster and\n\nTechnology Director was also not disclosed until during the trial itself which is material on the\n\n\n\n\nMotion for New Trial                  Cause No. 35621                          Page 3 of24\n                                              334\n\f335\n\n\n\n\nissue of good faith under Sec. 551.056(d). The newly discovered evidence clearly shows PISD\n\nmanaged its website when the 1/15/2009 meeting notice did not appear on its website as\n\nadmitted by PISD. Obviously, SchoolCenter could not transfer to the new website what did not\n\nexist on the OLD website that PISD maintained itself with Lee Carter as its webmaster. The\n\nnewly discovered evidence is material and dispositive, and is fatal to PISD's good faith claim.\n\nBecause PISD failed to supplement its interrogatory answers and failed to provide correct and\n\ncomplete answers to interrogatories and other discovery (PX 8·11 ), plaintiffs were not able to\n\nobtain the above evidence before trial.\n\n        Plaintiff Thanedar testified as expert in technology matters pertinent to this lawsuit. The\n\nabove evidence however is obvious to an average person. Plaintiffs affirm that \"Adobe GoLive\"\n\nwas a software product of Adobe Systems Inc. and· is an HTML editor used to maintain and\n\nmanage websites by its customers. The word \"Generator\" in Appendix 3 means what it says i.e.\n\nPISD generated its website using Adobe GoLive. Appendix 3.                The newly discovered evidence\n\nshows \"SchoolCenter\" was not responsible for NOT transferring or transporting said link to\n\ninternet notices as alleged by PISD at trial because PISD's website did not have the link in\n\nJanuary as admitted by PISD. Plaintiffs demonstrate the existence of factors 1 in Jackson and\n\nKirkpatrick for grant of new trial. Jackson v. Van Winkle, 660 S.W.2d 807, 809-10 (Tex. 1983);\n\nKirkpatrick v. Memorial Hosp., 862 S.W.2d 762, 775 (Tex.App.-Dallas 1993, writ denied). The\n\nweight and importance of the newly discovered evidence and its bearing with respect to evidence\n\n\n1\n  The factors are: (i) the evidence came to light since the time of trial or so late in the trial that it was\nimpossible to present the evidence before the trial closed; (ii) it was not because of a lack of due diligence\nthat the information did not come sooner; (iii) the new evidence is not merely cumulative to that already\ngiven and does not tend only to impeach the adversary's testimony; and (iv) the evidence is so material\nthat it would probably produce a different result if the court granted a new trial. Jackson v. Van Winkle,\n660 S.W.2d 807, 809-10 (Tex. 1983).\n\n\n\n\nMotion for New Trial                       Cause No. 35621                               Page4 of24\n                                                     335\n\f336\n\n\n\n\nreceived at trial is conclusive and is so material that it will probably produce a different result in\n\nthis case i.e. PISD did not have good faith because it removed the link from its website itself\n\nbefore the creation of new website by SchoolCenter- PISD's Jameson's testimony at trial and its\n\nresponses to discovery which were admitted into evidence being false, fabricated, and\n\nmisleading. Refusal to receive newly discovered evidence and refusal to grant new trial would\n\nbe manifest abuse of discretion and permanent loss of plaintiffs' substantive rights. A new trial\n\nis thus required under law on the good faith claim by PISD and an evidentiary hearing should be\n\nconducted by this Court to receive evidence in the above matters which will affirm that PISD's\n\ngood faith claim was made in bad faith and is a fraud. Plaintiffs request an evidentiary hearing\n\nfor the Court to receive evidence in this case on the newly discovered evidence above. The\n\nCourt should grant new trial.\n\n         4.   The Court clearly erred in granting $30,000 in attorney fees to PISD by taking\n\n''judicial notice of the file\" as asked by PISD. Texas law has not allowed recovery of attorney\n\nfees unless allowed by statute or contract. \"Absent a contract or statute, trial courts do not have\n\ninherent authority to require a losing party to pay the prevailing party's fees.\" Tony Gullo\n\nMotors v. Chapa, 212 S.W.3d 299,310-311 (Tex. 2006). Nothing in TOMA or its pertinent case\n\nauthority authorizes or empowers the Court to take judicial notice of attorney fees and to award\n\nthem without receiving evidence. See TOMA Sec. 551.142. 2 Plaintiffs challenge the imposition\n\n\n2\n    TOMA Section 551.142 provides as follows:\n(a) An interested person, including a member of the news media, may bring an action by\nmandamus or injunction to stop, prevent, or reverse a violation or threatened violation of this\nchapter by members of a governmental body.\n(b) The court may assess costs of litigation and reasonable attorney fees incurred by a plaintiff or\ndefendant who substantially prevails in an action under Subsection (a). In exercising its\ndiscretion, the court shall consider whether the action was brought in good faith and whether the\nconduct of the governmental body had a reasonable basis in law.\n\n\n\nMotion for New Trial                    Cause No. 35621                            Page 5 of24\n                                                 336\n\f•   337\n\n\n\n\n    of attorney fees as legally improper and further challenge the reasonableness of attorney fees\n\n    awarded to PISD. The reasonableness of attorneys' fees is question of fact that must be proven at\n\n    the trial. City of Garland v. Dallas Morning News, 22 S.W.3d 351, 367 (Tex. 2000). Thus PISD\n\n    was required to testify concerning its attorney fees. PISD refused and failed to testify on its\n\n    attorney fees and refused and failed to prove them. Thus PISD forfeited and waived any claim to\n\n    attorney fees. Because PISD refused and failed to prove and testify on its attorney fees, there is\n\n    no evidence or insufficient evidence in the record for the Court to award attorney fees to PISD.\n\n    Court's award of $30,000 has no basis in law or evidence because there is no evidence or\n\n    insufficient evidence of tasks completed, hours worked, level of difficulty, identity of attorneys,\n\n    reasonable hourly rates of attorneys on the case and other necessary information on which\n\n    attorney fees must be based on and can be determined. Further in this regard, plaintiffs rely on\n\n    and adopt and incorporate paragraph 2 of their Motion to Modify Judgment (which is filed\n\n    contemporaneously) by reference as if set forth verbatim herein.\n\n            It is clearly ascertainable that the award of attorney fees in this case does not arise under\n\n    Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code (CPRC) section 38.001, thus this Court does not have\n\n    power to take judicial notice of attorney fees under Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 38.004. See\n\n    Valdez v. Valdez, 930 S.W.2d 725, 732-33 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 1996, no writ)\n\n    (holding section 38.004 only applies to claims under section 38.001). Attorney fees award here\n\n    is legally improper because plaintiffs have undisputedly proven their good faith at the trial as\n\n    their report of the violation of Sec. 551.056(b) was the only reason said violation was finally\n\n    corrected by PISD after 5 months of non-compliance with TOMA from 112009 to 5/19/2009. PX\n\n    8-11.   Further this court sitting by assignment has no personal knowledge of all of the\n\n    proceedings in this case, being the third judge in this case after Judge Waters and Judge\n\n\n\n\n    Motion for New Trial                    Cause No. 35621                           Page 6 of24\n                                                     337\n\f338\n\n\n\n\nVanderpool. Further plaintiffs do not have the ability to pay attorney fees, thus award is not\n\nreasonable. PISD did not plead in its original or the amended answer the required prerequisites\n\nto attorney fees as required by TOMA Sec. 551.142. PISD's first amended answer is defective\n\nas it does not contain a proper certificate of service under TRCP and PISD failed to answer\n\nplaintiffs' second supplemental petition.\n\n        This Court has no authority or power under TOMA and no inherent authority or power to\n\nimpose attorney fees for any proceedings or filing in the appellate courts, with or without\n\nevidence being received. Defendant has provided no statutory support or case authority for it.\n\nFurther there is no evidence or insufficient evidence of filings by plaintiffs in the appellate court\n\non which to base attorney fees award on by this Court. Defendant made no argument concerning\n\nits attorney fees for appellate filings by plaintiffs. There is no evidence or insufficient evidence\n\nthat PISD made any responses to plaintiffs' appellate- filings and that they were accepted by\n\nappeals court. In fact, defendant's responses have been rejected by appeals court. In addition,\n\nplaintiffs prevailed on appeal in this case and the case was remanded back to trial court. Court's\n\nfinding that plaintiffs made voluminous filings is legally immaterial, arbitrary, and capricious\n\nbecause plaintiffs prevailed on appeal and defendant's responses were found defective by\n\nappeals court. Thus there is no basis in law or fact for an award of attorney fees for plaintiffs'\n\nfilings in appeals court. Further appeals court failed to segregate appeals court's portion of the\n\nattorney fees from trial court portion of the award and attorney fees before remand and after\n\nremand. Since, plaintiffs prevailed on appeal and were awarded costs by appeals court, no\n\nattorney fees and costs for proceedings before remand can be or should be awarded to PISD.\n\n        The attempt by PISD for attorney fees is a bald attempt to intimidate plaintiffs in not\n\nfiling an appeal of this Court's judgment. Such an attempt is an outrageous affront to the purpose\n\n\n\n\nMotion for New Trial                   Cause No. 35621                            Page 7 of24\n                                                338\n\f339\n\n\n\n\nof open government under TOMA and will have chilling effect on citizens and taxpayers who\n\nreport violations of TOMA and seek redress. PISD has refused to testify and prove its attorney\n\nfees before this Court (or appeals court), this Court failed to receive evidence concerning\n\nattorney fees, thus PISD waived and forfeited attorney fees.\n\n        It is clearly ascertainable that PISD did not respond to plaintiffs' motions or letters\n\nwhether or not they were \"voluminous,\" thus there is no evidence that PISD ever incurred\n\nattorney fees or insufficient evidence that PISD ever incurred attorney fees and to what extent\n\nwith respect to PISD's complaints about plaintiffs filings. Further, plaintiffs cannot be penalized\n\nor sanctioned for filing lawsuits or for their filings whether or not they were voluminous as they\n\na have constitutional right to seek redress of their grievances. The plain fact is there is no\n\nevidence or insufficient evidence ofPISD spending any time on plaintiffs' \"filings\" in this Court\n\nor in appeals court.\n\n        An attorney fees award based on no evidence ofexistence and reasonableness of attorney\n\nfees viz. identity of attorneys, hours worked, tasks performed, quality and difficulty of work,\n\nhourly rate and other factors; or insufficient evidence of existence viz. identity of attorneys,\n\nhours worked, tasks performed, quality and difficulty of work, hourly rate and other factors\n\nviolates plaintiffs' constitutional rights of due process and equal protection under Texas\n\nConstitution and 14th Amendment to the Unites States Constitution as such arbitrary and\n\ncapricious and manifestly too large and unreasonable imposition of attorney fees has no support\n\nin law or case authority. Therefore imposition of attorney fees without legal support under\n\nTOMA and without receiving evidence is not only a clear abuse of discretion but is abusive to\n\nTexas citizens and taxpayers such as plaintiffs. This Court should vacate its judgment and order\n\nnew trial. PISD did not offer argument at trial or in its pleadings about whether plaintiffs\n\n\n\n\nMotion for New Trial                   Cause No. 35621                          Page 8 of24\n                                               339\n\f340\n\n\n\n\nbrought this suit in good faith or being a prevailing party, or whether its actions had a reasonable\n\nbasis in law on all causes of action brought by plaintiffs. See Sec. 551.142. PISD failed to plead\n\nprerequisites to attorney fees in its amended answer.           Sec. 551.142. PISD's first amended\n\nanswer is defective as it does not have proper certificate of service under TRCP. Plaintiffs adopt\n\nand incorporate by reference their response to defendant's first amended answer and plaintiffs'\n\nspecial exceptions and affirmative defense to defendant's request for attorney fees and costs\n\n(which are on file) as if set forth verbatim herein.\n\n          As explained before, there is clear undisputed evidence of good faith on the part of\n\nplaintiffs in this case, thus imposition of costs is improper and unreasonable. See TOMA Sec.\n\n551.142. PX 8-11. The judgment and award of attorney fees of $30,000 and costs should be\n\nvacated and denied and new trial ordered. PISD offered no evidence of lack of good faith on the\n\npart of plaintiffs and did not even offer an argument on it.             Thus there is no evidence or\n\ninsufficient evidence of lack of good faith or bad faith in the record on the part of plaintiffs.\n\n          5. The Court erred when it denied trial on plaintiffs' remaining six (6) distinct causes of\n\naction under TOMA Sections 551.041, 551.043, 551.045, 551.051, 551.074, 551.101. 3 See\n\nplaintiffs' original petition and the two supplements on file.\n\n\n\n3\n PISD's Board of Trustees (Board) held 11 meetings each in 2008 and 2009 from 8/13/08 to 5/19/09.\nViolations of TOMA provisions at Issue in this case:\n      •   §551.051: PISD violated §551.051 by failing to post notices of 3/26/09 board meeting and 22\n          Meetings in a specifically designated place - Bulletin Board in its Central Administrative Office\n          (Central Office) as required by TOMA.\n      •   §551.056: PISD violated §551.056 by failing to concurrently post internet notices of 3/26/09\n          board meeting and 22 Meetings on its website for prescribed time and manner.\n      •   §551.043: PISD violated §551.043 by failing to post notices of 3/26/09 board meeting and 22\n          Meetings at a physical location for prescribed time (72 hours) and manner.\n      •   §551.041: PISD violated §551.041 by failing to specify \"place\" (Pampa, Texas) in its notices\n          (internet and paper notices) of 3/26/09 board meeting and 22 Meetings.\n\n\n\nMotion for New Trial                       Cause No. 35621                             Page9 of24\n                                                    340\n\f341\n\n\n\n\n          The Court stated that the appeals court remanded the case to hold trial only in the cause\n\nof action in Sec. 551.056(b) and (d). This is plainly incorrect. The appeals court did not state\n\nthe causes of action on which trial should be held. See the Opinion and Mandate of the appeals\n\ncourt on file in this case. The appeals court did not rule on said 6 causes of action in its opinion\n\nand this Court was required to hold trial on them and specifically rule on them. The Texas Rules\n\nof Civil Procedure require that the Court rule on all causes of action and the judgment conform\n\nto pleadings. The record of trial is clear - plaintiffs did not agree to forego their right to trial on\n\nsaid 6 causes of action. The Court has failed to make findings of fact and conclusions of law\n\nregarding said 6 causes of action. TOMA Sec. 551.142(a) entitles plaintiffs to ruling and relief\n\non their said 6 causes of action.        Plaintiffs refer to and rely on the facts, arguments, and\n\nauthorities presented and relief requested in regards to said 6 causes of action in plaintiffs'\n\nsecond no-evidence and traditional motion for summary judgment (filed in this case on\n\n10/3112012) as if set forth verbatim herein. If the Court is of the opinion that material fact\n\nquestion remains as to any of the said 6 causes of action, the Court was required to try them,\n\nalternatively, if the Court believes no material fact question remains, the Court is required to rule\n\non said six causes of action.        The Texas Supreme Court has demanded Exact and Literal\n\nCompliance with TOMA. See Acker v. Texas Water Commission, 790 S.W.2d 299 (Tex. 1990).\n\n(\"The explicit command of the statute is for openness at every stage of the deliberations.\n\nAccordingly, we have demanded exact and literal compliance with the terms of this statute.\"\n\n[citing] Smith County v. Thornton, 726 S.W.2d 2, 3 (Tex. 1986); City of San Antonio v. Fourth\n\n\n\n      •   §551.101 and §551.074(b): PISD violated §551.101 by failing to legally close the 3/26/09 Board\n          meeting and violated §551.074(b) by deliberating on Terrell's termination in closed meeting.\n      •   §551.045(d): PISD violated §551.045(d) because PISD's notices (website and physical location)\n          of 3/26/09 board meeting and 22 Meetings were signed on behalf of the Board and posted by a\n          person (Karen Linder) not so designated nor authorized by PISD's Board of Trustees (Board).\n\n\nMotion for New Trial                      Cause No. 35621                           Page 10 of24\n                                                   341\n\f342\n\n\n\n\nCourt ofAppeals, 820 S.W.2d 762 (Tex. 1991)). Thus, \"substantial compliance\" under TOMA,\n\nwhether done in good faith or not, is no longer sufficient nor valid law in Texas. This Court\n\nshould apply the Exact and Literal Standard to all causes of action in this TOMA lawsuit.\n\n        The Court's failure to rule or try the remaining six causes of action violates plaintiffs'\n\nconstitutional rights under Texas Constitution Article 1 Sections 3, 13, 19, and 27, and the 14th\n\nAmendment to the U. S. Constitution. Plaintiffs request that judgment be vacated and new trial\n\nbe granted on all causes of action.\n\n        6. The Court erred in denying plaintiffs' motions to exclude evidence concerning any\n\nperson or third party vendor's role or involvement about which full discovery was not provided\n\nor role and involvement not disclosed during the discovery process to plaintiffs in this case\n\nincluding SchoolCenter and BoardBook. The Court erred in denying plaintiffs' motion to strike\n\nand exclude Jameson's testimony regarding SchoolCenter as PISD had concealed and failed to\n\ndisclose its identity and role during discovery process.      PISD further failed to supplement\n\ndiscovery concerning the identity and role of SchoolCenter concerning its good faith defense\n\nunder Sec. 551.056(d).\n\n        For the first time at trial, PISD asserted that a third party vendor, SchoolCenter, made the\n\nmistake of not transporting the link to BoardBook to a new website. PISD engaged in trial by\n\nambush in this regard by concealing 1) that a third party vendor was involved in creating a new\n\nwebsite, 2) that this vendor School Center was responsible for the error of dropping the link to\n\ninternet notices on BoardBook. PISD during discovery process represented that only Jameson\n\nand Linder had knowledge of the link problem and did not disclose that any other person or\n\nvendor was involved in either creating the new website or transporting the link to the new\n\nwebsite. See PX 8-11; Appendix 1.\n\n\n\n\nMotion for New Trial                   Cause No. 35621                          Page 11 of24\n                                                342\n\f•\n    343\n\n\n\n\n            At trial, PISD admitted that it had a contract with SchoolCenter, but did not disclose its\n\n    existence and the role of SchoolCenter during discovery process and failed to supplement\n\n    discovery. PX 8-11. PISD divulged the identity and its claim that SchoolCenter played a central\n\n    role in its non-compliance with Sec. 551.056(b) for 5 months from 1115/2009 meeting to\n\n    5/19/2009 meeting by not transporting the link to PISD's website notices on BoardBook. PISD\n\n    disclosed the identity of SchoolCenter and its role for the first time in Jameson's testimony at\n\n    trial on 10/9/2013. Because PISD concealed the identity of SchoolCenter and its alleged crucial\n\n    role in PISD's non-compliance with TOMA during discovery process, the Court should have\n\n    excluded and struck Jameson's testimony relating to any and all evidence relating to\n\n    SchoolCenter as a sanction on PISD. Boothe v. Hausler, 166 S.W.2d 788, 789 (Tex. 1989).\n\n    Parties have an affirmative duty to supplement answers to discovery requests if an answer is no\n\n    longer true and complete.      TRCP 193.1, 193.5         PISD intentionally misled plaintiffs by\n\n    concealing SchoolCenter's identity and role until during the trial committing trial by ambush on\n\n    plaintiffs. The sanction for failure to comply with this rule is exclusion of the evidence affected\n\n    by the violation. Tex. R. Civ. P. 215(5).; TRCP 193.6; See Boothe v. Hausler at 789. PISD\n\n    failed to establish before the trial court that good cause existed for allowing SchoolCenter related\n\n    evidence. Boothe v. Hausler, at 789.\n\n            At trial, PISD claimed to have paid license fees and renewal fees to BoardBook for its\n\n    service to post website notices since 2007. But during discovery process PISD refused and failed\n\n    to provide full and complete discovery and produce documents concerning payment of license\n\n    fees and renewal fees to BoardBook. PX 8-11. PISD refused and failed to supplement answers to\n\n    interrogatories, to requests for admission, and produce documents concerning license fees and\n\n    renewal fees. Thus as explained above, all evidence concerning existence of BoardBook service\n\n\n\n\n    Motion for New Trial                   Cause No. 35621                          Page 12 of24\n                                                    343\n\f344\n\n\n\n\nshould have been excluded and struck from evidence at trial. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 215(5).; TRCP\n\n193.6; See Boothe v. Hausler at 789.     The Court erred when it refused and failed to do so in\n\nresponse to motions from plaintiffs. See notice of pending motions which is on file.\n\n        Because PISD failed to comply with discovery rules and concealed and obstructed\n\njustice, plaintiffs were severely compromised in their ability to show that non-compliance with\n\n551.056(b) for 5 months was actually due to the fact PISD did not have BoardBook service\n\nduring that time period and that PISD obtained it in May 2009 and retroactively posted meeting\n\nnotices to its websites to conceal its non-compliance with TOMA. Similarly, because PISD\n\nconcealed the identity of SchoolCenter until the trial and SchoolCenter's alleged failure in\n\ntransporting \"link\" to PISD website notices, plaintiffs were severely compromised in this regard.\n\nIn both instances, the testimony and the issues were dispositive and not cumulative because they\n\nrelated to the controlling and central issue ofPISD's good faith under Sec. 551.056(d) and why\n\nthe link to website notices was missing for 5 months in 2009. Boothe v. Hausler, at 789. The\n\nCourt should have excluded evidence concerning SchoolCenter and BoardBook, alternatively\n\nshould have granted continuance of the trial as requested by plaintiffs to conduct further\n\ndiscovery. TRCP 193.6(c).\n\n        7.   Plaintiff moves for new trial in this case on all causes of action as there is\n\noverwhelming evidence against the Court's judgment or no evidence to support it, alternatively,\n\ninsufficient evidence to support the Court's judgment in this case. Further, the record discloses\n\nthe following: (1) there is complete absence of evidence of a vital fact; (2) the court is barred by\n\nrules of law or evidence from giving weight to the only evidence offered to prove a vital fact; (3)\n\nthe evidence offered to prove a vital fact is no more than a scintilla of evidence; or (4) the\n\nevidence conclusively established the opposite of a vital fact. See Hawkins v. Ehler, 100 S.W.3d\n\n\n\n\nMotion for New Trial                   Cause No. 35621                          Page 13 of24\n                                                344\n\f345\n\n\n\n\n534, 539 (Tex. App.--Fort Worth 2003, no pet.); Horton v. Horton, 965 S.W.2d 78, 85 (Tex.\n\nApp.--Fort Worth 1998, no pet.).\n\n        PISD has admitted that website internet notices of its 11 board meetings did not appear\n\non its website from 112009 to 5/19/2009. It is clear from the plain language of TOMA Sec.\n\n551.056(d) that PISD has the burden of proof to prove good faith under Sec. 551.056(d) as to\n\nwhy its non-compliance with Sec. 551.056(b) was in good faith for 5 long months from 112009\n\nto 5/19/2009.\n\n        Karen Linder and Barry Haenisch in their testimonies engaged in surmise, speculation\n\nand had no personal knowledge concerning a ''third party vendor\" who they did not want to or\n\ncould not identify. Their testimony thus was bare opinion, hearsay, incompetent, speculative,\n\nand immaterial as to whether PISD exercised good faith concerning its non-compliance with Sec.\n\n551.056(b).     Thus the evidence they presented was no more than scintilla, surmise, and\n\nspeculation which is not legal evidence. \"When the evidence offered to prove a vital fact is so\n\nweak as to do no more than create a mere surmise or suspicion of its existence, the evidence is no\n\nmore than a scintilla and, in legal effect, is no evidence at all,\" Kindred v. Con/Chem, Inc. 650\n\nS.W.2d 61,63 (Tex. 1983). Karen Linder's testimony was a sham because she admitted that her\n\nsworn answers to plaintiffs' interrogatories were nothing but speculation and she did not have\n\nknowledge about technical matters in question. 4 PX 8-11. Karen Linder's assertion that she\n\n\"worked in BoardBook\" on her computer was no more than bare opinion as PISD presented no\n\nevidence that it actually had BoardBook service during the period in question i.e. 112009 to\n\n5/18/2009 or at any time from 8/13/2008 to 5/19/2009.                Thus their testimonies must be\n\n\n4\n  PISD falsely represented to the appeals court that printing PDF notices, opening, closing PDF notices by\nthemselves changed the create and modify dates of website notices. Based on this fraudulent\nmisrepresentation, appeals court remanded the case to determine the facts. PISD now states at trial that it\nwas just speculation on their part. This is plain obstruction of justice.\n\n\nMotion for New Trial                      Cause No. 35621                             Page 14 of24\n                                                   345\n\f•\n    346\n\n\n\n\n    disregarded as no material fact question was raised or answered by their testimonies and because\n\n    the Court was barred by rules of law or evidence from giving weight to the only evidence they\n\n    offered (hearsay, bare opinion, and speculation) to prove a vital fact of good faith under TOMA.\n\n            As previously explained above, Suzie Jameson's testimony concerning SchoolCenter\n\n    must be excluded and struck from evidence as a sanction foy violation of discovery rules. Even\n\n    otherwise, Jameson's testimony concerning SchoolCenter was no more than bare opinion and\n\n    hearsay, surmise, speculation, thus does not constitute legal evidence and must be disregarded\n\n    under rules of evidence. Kindred at 63. PISD presented no competent evidence (e.g. contract,\n\n    payment of license fee, renewal fee, executed contract, check register, service correspondence,\n\n    etc.) that it actually had SchoolCenter as vendor providing any kind of service. PISD and\n\n    Jameson concealed the identity of SchoolCenter and its role in transporting the link in question\n\n    to a \"new website\" allegedly managed by SchoolCenter. There is no evidence or insufficient\n\n    evidence that any third party vendor including SchoolCenter was a vendor for PISD and such\n\n    vendor including School Center provided any kind of service to PISD including creation of new\n\n    website or transporting the link in question. PISD chose to obstruct justice instead of complying\n\n    with the discovery rules, it should not be rewarded for it.\n\n            Further as explained in paragraph 3 above, the newly discovered evidence clearly shows\n\n    that PISD generated its own website through 1126/2009 and PISD has already admitted that its\n\n    January 15, 2009 board meeting's website notice did not appear on its website due to alleged link\n\n    being removed. Thus it is clear from PISD's own admission and newly discovered evidence that\n\n    the link problem already existed on PISD's old website which it generated itself by using Adobe\n\n    GoLive program by its own employee Lee Carter - webmaster and technology director.\n\n    Appendices 2-5. The problem of admitted non-compliance on January 15, 2009 existed before\n\n\n\n\n    Motion for New Trial                    Cause No. 35621                       Page 15 of24\n                                                     346\n\f347\n\n\n\n\nSchoolCenter allegedly created the new website which was in February 2009. Jameson's\n\ntestimony blaming SchoolCenter for not transferring the link was false and fraudulent as the link\n\ndid not exist on PISD's website in January 2009 when PISD and Lee Carter its webmaster\n\nmanaged its own website - hence there was no link to transfer. PISD falsified evidence at trial.\n\nThus an evidentiary hearing is warranted in this matter to receive evidence in this case. A new\n\ntrial should be granted on all causes of action. There is no evidence, alternatively insufficient\n\nevidence that SchoolCenter caused loss of link as alleged by PISD or that SchoolCenter was\n\nresponsible for not transferring the link in February 2009. This is because the newly discovered\n\nevidence shows that the link did not exist on PISD's website in January 2009 when PISD\n\nmanaged the website.      It is clear that the link was removed by PISD itself as it was not\n\n\"necessary\" as alleged by Jameson. PX 32; Appendix 1. At best, SchoolCenter's role is no more\n\nthan speculation, surmise which is not legal evidence in this case. See Kindred at 63. As\n\nexplained above, evidence at trial concerning SchoolCenter must be excluded. Further, evidence\n\nat trial concerning existence of BoardBook service during 1/2009 to 5/19/2009 must also be\n\nexcluded. This Court should set aside its judgment including award of attorney fees and costs,\n\norder new trial and further permit discovery concerning PISD's newly disclosed existence of a\n\nthird party vendor, SchoolCenter, who allegedly made the error of not transporting the \"link\" to\n\nthe legally required internet notices. Plaintiffs are entitled to discovery concerning SchoolCenter\n\nbecause its existence and its role was never disclosed before the trial.\n\n        8. Furthermore, there is no evidence or insufficient evidence that PISD's non-compliance\n\nwith TOMA Sec. 551.056(b) was in good faith.              On the contrary, there is overwhelming\n\n\n\n\nMotion for New Trial                    Cause No. 35621                        Page 16 of24\n                                                 347\n\f348\n\n\n\n\nevidence that its non-compliance was not in good faith. PISD has the burden of proof, but PISD\n\nfailed to meet its burden under TOMA Sec. 551.056(d). 5\n\n         a. There is no evidence or insufficient evidence that PISD made a good faith attempt to\n\npost internet notices to comply with Sec. 551.056(b) for 11 meetings from 1115/2009 to\n\n5/19/2009. PISD and its staff never checked its website for each of the 11 meetings to see\n\nwhether their each alleged attempt, if any, resulted in website notices actually appearing on its\n\nwebsite.    PISD (Haenisch, Linder and Jameson testimonies) admitted that it did not verify\n\ncompliance during said time period. See for example, Appendix 1. There is overwhelming\n\nevidence in the record that PISD did not exercise due diligence and care for any of the meetings\n\nthat took place from January 15, 2009 to 5/19/2009 because no one at PISD ever verified\n\nwhether or not TOMA notices actually appeared on PISD's website. If PISD had done so, it\n\nwould have immediately known and found out that notices were not appearing on its website and\n\nPISD would have presumably fixed its non-compliance with TOMA. PISD never checked its\n\nown website for compliance during January 2009 to 5/19/2009 for TOMA compliance with Sec.\n\n551.056(b) until plaintiffs informed them of the no-appearance. This is admitted by PISD. PX\n\n8-11. An average person with normal or average standard of care and due diligence would have\n\nchecked or verified PISD's website to ensure that the required legal notices actually appeared on\n\nthe new website when it was created in February 2009. In fact an average person with exercising\n\nstandard care would have verified appearance of legal notices on its website for every board\n\nmeeting since January 15, 2009 through 5/19/2009 (the period for which PISD admitted TOMA\n\n5\n    TOMA §551.056(d) provides that:\n\"The validity of a posted notice of a meeting or an agenda by a governmental body or economic\ndevelopment corporation subject to this section that made a good faith attempt to comply with\nthe requirements of this section that is due to a technical problem beyond the control of the\ngovernmental body or economic development corporation.\"\n\n\nMotion for New Trial                   Cause No. 35621                        Page 17 of24\n                                                348\n\f349\n\n\n\n\nnotices did not appear on its website and for which it claims good faith). The trial testimonies of\n\nHaenisch, Linder, and Jameson are clear that not one of them or any one else at PISD checked\n\neven once that TOMA legal notices actually appeared on PISD's website especially after\n\ncreating new website. Thus PISD did not exercise due diligence or care for 5 months in question\n\nand therefore its good faith defense fails and must be rejected. If this Court does not reverse its\n\njudgment, every government body intentionally or not, will \"fail\" to exercise sufficient care to\n\ncomply with TOMA for months or years and still claim good faith and will be granted exception\n\nunder Sec. 551.056(d), making a laughing stock out of Texas Open Meetings Act.\n\n        b.   There is no evidence or insufficient evidence that PISD's website contained the\n\nalleged link to website notices BEFORE SchoolCenter allegedly created a new website in\n\nFebruary 2009. Appendix 4-5. There is no evidence or insufficient evidence that negligence or\n\nincompetence on PISD's part concerning not transferring or transporting a link is a \"technical\n\nproblem.\" See Sec. 551.056(d). \"Oops we forgot\" is not a technical problem under TOMA.\n\n        c. There is no evidence or insufficient evidence that transferring a link to an alleged new\n\nwebsite was \"beyond the control\" of PISD for 5 long months from 112009 to 5/19/2009. See\n\nSec. 551.056(d). Jameson testified that failure to transfer the link in question was an \"oversight\"\n\nand negligence. Appendix I. There is overwhelming evidence that the link problem in question\n\nwould have been fixed had PISD checked its \"new\" website just once in 5 months as to whether\n\nlegally required internet notices were actually appearing on its website. There is overwhelming\n\nevidence that PISD showed conscious indifference at best or bad faith and fraudulent misconduct\n\nconcerning its legal duty to comply with TOMA Sec. 551.056(b).\n\n        The problem of link was only fixed when plaintiff Thanedar reported nonappearance of\n\nnotices on 5/15/2009 to PISD in good faith. PX 8-11. Without plaintiffs' report in good faith,\n\n\n\n\nMotion for New Trial                   Cause No. 35621                         Page 18 of24\n                                                349\n\f350\n\n\n\n\nPISD could have continued for several more months or even indefinitely without complying with\n\nSec. 551.056.\n\n        This government body presumes that the Court would take no action on its blatant\n\nmisconduct and concealment of evidence and Texas citizens will never find out about its bad\n\nfaith. PISD is mistaken. This Court should not condone such conduct.\n\n        9. The Court erred in denying plaintiffs' motions for continuance of trial. Plaintiffs\n\nadopt and incorporate by reference their application for continuance of final trial only but not of\n\npending motions (filed on or about 10/4/2013) and plaintiffs' expedited motion to reset trial date\n\nof October 9, 2013 (filed on or about 9/20/12013) as if set forth verbatim herein. Thus\n\ncontinuance was proper and this Court should grant this motion for new trial.\n\n        Further continuance of the trial was proper due to the death of plaintiff Thanedar' s\n\nmother (Terrell's mother in law) and Thanedar's travel to India during the month of September\n\n2013 leaving on 9/6/2013 and returning on 9/25/2013 less than two weeks before the trial. Due\n\nto death in the family, plaintiffs were thus not prepared physically or emotionally for the trial on\n\n10/9/2013.    Further, as explained before, crucial dispositive evidence concerning existence,\n\nidentity, and role of third party vendor SchoolCenter was introduced during trial in violation of\n\ndiscovery rules. Thus continuance was proper in this case. TRCP 193.6(c).\n\n        10. The Court erred when it stated during trial that it will rule on admissibility of PX1\n\n(22 board meeting website notices at issue in this lawsuit and their electronic document\n\nproperties on Compact Disc) at a later time but failed to do so during the length of 1 day trial on\n\n10/9/2013. Plaintiffs reminded and urged the Court to make a ruling however the Court failed to\n\ndo so thereby impliedly denying Admission of PX1. Plaintiff however made offer of proof,\n\nfurther stating that the CD in question was relevant in determining compliance with TOMA Sec.\n\n\n\n\nMotion for New Trial                   Cause No. 35621                          Page 19 of24\n                                                350\n\f351\n\n\n\n\n551.056 for the 22 meetings in question and the electronic properties on the CD were\n\nauthenticated by Judge Waters. PISD did not make a specific valid objection. The CD in\n\nquestion is in the record and the record thereon has been reviewed on appeal by the appeals\n\ncourt. The Court clearly abused its discretion when it refused to rule on admissibility ofPX1 As\n\nPX1 is central to violation of TOMA Sec. 551.056 and all other causes of action in plaintiffs'\n\nlive pleadings. PX2 which is the summary of PX 1 was admitted in the record. There are other\n\nerrors in admission of plaintiffs' trial exhibits e.g. PX32 which was actually admitted but does\n\nnot appear as admitted exhibit in record, thus the error should be corrected.       The Court further\n\nerred in not admitting plaintiffs Exhibit number 23 (concerning violation of Sec. 551.051 ),\n\nExhibit number 25 (salary schedules - back pay and benefits}, Exhibit 26 (disclosures to\n\nplaintiffs), Exhibit 27 (violation of Sec. 551.041 - requirement of Place) as these relate to\n\nplaintiffs' causes of action the Court refused to try or hear. Given the weight and importance of\n\nthese matters represented by the not-admitted exhibits above, led to incorrect judgment in this\n\ncase. Further refusing to admit PX1 and ignoring electronic properties of notices contained\n\ntherein which is at the center of violation of Sec.551.056 led to rendition of incorrect judgment.\n\nThus, the Court should grant new trial on all causes of action.\n\n        11. The Court erred in denying post-remand discovery including motions to compel\n\ndiscovery.    Plaintiffs have repeatedly made arguments before the Court that post-remand\n\ndiscovery is consistent with the opinion and mandate of the appeals Court. 6 Plaintiffs refer and\n\n\n6\n  This case was remanded by the 7th Court of Appeals for the sole reason to determine whether there is\nevidence for PISD's \"good faith\" claim under Texas Open Meetings Act (TOMA) with respect to the\nuntimeliness of its website notices posted on BoardBook and whether the \"create dates\" of its website\nnotices changed due to \"printing.\" See 7th Court of Appeals Opinion (pages 5-6) and Mandate on file;\nand Texas Gov't Code §551.056 (b) and (d). On remand, defendant has repeatedly refused to supplement\nits answers to interrogatories or other discovery requests. See PX 22 (letter requesting supplementation\nfrom PISD).\n\n\n\nMotion for New Trial                     Cause No. 35621                           Page20of24\n                                                  351\n\f352\n\n\n\n\nrely on arguments made in the following motions which are adopted and incorporated by\n\nreference as if set forth verbatim herein: Second no-evidence and traditional motion for summary\n\nJudgment, Motion to Reset Trial, Application for Continuance, Plaintiffs' Motion for Ruling on\n\nPost-Remand Discovery, to Exclude, for Inferences, to Compel discovery from defendant, and\n\nFor Sanctions Filed on 6/5/12, Motion to Vacate Court Order and for Oral Depositions and\n\nAdditional Discovery Filed on 11/16/2012. As explained before, without post-remand discovery,\n\nplaintiffs' ability to present their claims at trial was severely compromised causing permanent\n\nloss of their substantial rights. In addition, Texas citizens and taxpayers are entitled to know\n\nwhether PISD's good faith defense under TOMA 551.056(d) was a fraud on them and on the\n\nappeals court and this Court.    Post-remand discovery would have determined that question\n\nproperly and would have advanced the cause of open government. This Court should not close\n\nits eyes to the important purpose of Open Government under TOMA.\n\n        12. The Court erred in ruling for defendant PISD on the grounds that\n\n        a) Non-compliance with TOMA Sec. 551.056(b) was excused because legally required\n\nwebsite notices \"appeared on Google\" or were \"available on Google,\" for public and\n\n        b) Terrell attended the 3/26/20009 board meeting, spoke at the board meeting and was\n\naware of the proposed termination of her contract.\n\n        Both grounds Court cited in ruling for PISD are completely irrelevant as a matter of law\n\nand must be disregarded and have no legal support whatsoever either statutorily in TOMA or in\n\ncase law. TOMA mandates that the internet website notices for a government body's board\n\nmeetings must appear concurrently on the government body's website. See TOMA 551.056(b).\n\nThere is no legal support for the proposition that the website notices can appear \"on Google\" and\n\nmeet the requirements of Sec. 551.056(b) or (d). PISD's website notices appearing \"on Google,\"\n\n\n\n\nMotion for New Trial                  Cause No. 35621                          Page 21 of24\n                                               352\n\f•   353\n\n\n\n\n    even if true, is legally irrelevant in meeting the good faith exception under Sec. 551.056(d).\n\n    Testimony by Jameson in this regard is hearsay and speculation and must be disregarded.\n\n            Similarly, the case law is clearly established - Texas Open Meetings Act is not a scheme\n\n    to provide due process to individuals. The Open Meetings Act is not a legislative scheme for\n\n    service of process; it has no due process implications. Rather, its purpose is to provide \"openness\n\n    at every stage of [a governmental body's] deliberations.\" Acker v. Texas Water Comm'n, 790\n\n    S.W.2d 299, 300 (Tex.l990). City of San Antonio v. Fourth Court ofAppeals, 820 S.W.2d 762\n\n    (Tex.l991). Thus it is legally irrelevant whether or not plaintiffs Terrell and Thanedar knew\n\n    about the 3/26/2009 board meeting and whether they attended the meeting or not. The Court\n\n    should not make new law in this regard.\n\n            Concerning findings of fact made by the Court, there is either no evidence or insufficient\n\n    evidence to support them or they are not legally relevant or material. For example, there is no\n\n    evidence or insufficient evidence that PISD ever paid license fee or renewal fee for service to\n\n    BoardBook or SchoolCenter as PISD refused and failed to produce such information in response\n\n    to discovery requests by plaintiffs. To the contrary, BoardBook draft contract (PX31) clearly\n\n    states that unless license fee is paid or purchase order provided, the contract would not be\n\n    effective. See PX31. PISD provided no such evidence at trial. As explained before, PISD's\n\n    bare opinion at trial in this regard is not legal evidence. See Kindred, /d. At trial, PISD's\n\n    testimony concerning SchoolCenter was purposefully misleading, evasive, and obstructive hence\n\n    must be deemed not credible.\n\n            Concerning conclusions of law made by the Court there is simply no evidence in support\n\n    or insufficient evidence in support of them. For example, there is no evidence or insufficient\n\n    evidence that internet notices independently appeared on either BoardBook website or on\n\n\n\n\n    Motion for New Trial                   Cause No. 35621                         Page22 of24\n                                                    353\n\f•\n    354\n\n\n\n\n    Google. In addition, such evidence even if established would be legally irrelevant as there is no\n\n    statutory support nor case authority in support for such proposition. The Court's finding of fact\n\n    and conclusion of law that an unnamed third party vendor was at \"fault\" is legally invalid as the\n\n    Court does not even identify the name of the vendor, certainly because there is no evidence or\n\n    insufficient evidence as shown above that said link even existed on PISD's OLD website before\n\n    the alleged unnamed third party vendor generated the new website. Plaintiffs refer to paragraph\n\n    3 above and repeat it herein. There is no evidence or insufficient evidence for Court's finding\n\n    and conclusion that new website was created in January 2009. There is conclusive evidence\n\n    because of PISD's admission in this case that said link did not exist on PISD's old website in\n\n    January 2009 when 1115/2009 board meeting notice did not appear on PISD's website in\n\n    violation of Sec. 551.056(b). There is no evidence or insufficient evidence that a third party\n\n    vendor was at fault for not transferring said link to the new website and there is conclusive or\n\n    sufficient or overwhelming evidence that PISD removed the link itself because it believed it was\n\n    not \"necessary.\" See PX 32.\n\n            For the above reasons, the trial on 10/9/2013 was tarnished by new allegations of facts\n\n    introduced for the first time in 4 112 years in violation of discovery rules, gross hearsay in\n\n    violation of evidence rules presented and admitted as evidence over plaintiffs' objections,\n\n    defendant's unseemly defamatory tactics against plaintiffs by introducing irrelevant matters into\n\n    evidence in violation of rules of evidence to create bias in the record and before this judge, all of\n\n    which resulted in trial by ambush and in miscarriage of justice. The trial was neither fair nor\n\n    impartial. Thus the judgment should be set aside and new trial ordered on all causes of action in\n\n    the interest of justice and good cause.\n\n\n\n\n    Motion for New Trial                      Cause No. 35621                        Page 23 of24\n                                                       354\n\f355\n\n\n\n\n                                               Prayer\n\n        FOR THE FOREGOING REASONS, and in the interest of justice, fairness, and good\n\ncause, plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court vacate the judgment and vacate the award of\n\nattorney fees and costs entered in this case, set this motion for hearing, conduct an evidentiary\n\nhearing on newly discovered evidence, grant this motion, and grant new trial on all causes of\n\naction.

Plaintiffs refer to their motion for new trial including all its appendices 1 through 6,\n\n    timely filed on November 21, 2013 which is adopted and incorporated as if set forth verbatim\n\n    herein. Plaintiffs have attached their affidavit hereto concerning this motion as appendix 6.\n\n    Judgment is incorrect in stating that plaintiffs announced ready. Plaintiffs requested continuance\n\n    of trial only which was denied. The judgment should be corrected in this regard.\n\n            2. Court erred and clearly abused its discretion in granting award of attorney fees of\n\n    $30,000 to PISD and costs. The judgment should be modified and the award of attorney fees and\n\n    costs should be vacated and denied. Plaintiffs challenge the award of the attorney fees on the\n\n    grounds that the award is 1) not reasonable, manifestly too large, and 2) neither legally valid, nor\n\n    proper, nor justified in this case.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    379\n\f380\n\n\n\n\n       The Court clearly erred in granting $30,000 in attorney fees to PISD by taking \"judicial\n\nnotice of the file\" as asked by PISD. Texas law regarding attorney fees is clear and well\n\nestablished. Texas law has not allowed recovery of attorney fees unless allowed by statute or\n\ncontract. \"Absent a contract or statute, trial courts do not have inherent authority to require a\n\nlosing party to pay the prevailing party's fees.\" Tony Gullo Motors v. Chapa, 212 S.W.3d 299,\n\n310-311 (Tex. 2006). Nothing in TOMA or its pertinent case authority authorizes or empowers\n\nthe Court to take judicial notice of attorney fees and to award them without receiving evidence.\n\nSee TOMA Sec. 551.142. 1 Plaintiffs challenge the imposition of attorney fees as legally\n\nimproper and further challenge the reasonableness of attorney fees awarded to PISD.             The\n\nreasonableness of attorneys' fees is question of fact that must be proven at the trial. City of\n\nGarland v. Dallas Morning News, 22 S.W.3d 351, 367 (Tex. 2000). Arthur Andersen & Co. v.\n\nPerry Equip. Corp., 945 S.W.2d 812, 818 (Tex. 1997). Thus PISD was required to testify\n\nconcerning its attorney fees and reasonableness of the fees. PISD refused and failed to testify on\n\nits attorney fees and refused and failed to prove them. Therefore PISD forfeited and waived any\n\nclaim to attorney fees. Because PISD refused and failed to prove and testify on its attorney fees,\n\nthere is no evidence or insufficient evidence in the record for the Court to award attorney fees to\n\nPISD. Court's award of $30,000 has no basis in law or evidence because there is no evidence or\n\ninsufficient evidence of tasks completed, hours worked, timesheets, billing statements, level of\n\n\n1\n  TOMA Section 551.142 provides as follows:\n(a) An interested person, including a member of the news media, may bring an action by\nmandamus or injunction to stop, prevent, or reverse a violation or threatened violation of this\nchapter by members of a governmental body.\n(b) The court may assess costs of litigation and reasonable attorney fees incurred by a plaintiff or\ndefendant who substantially prevails in an action under Subsection (a). In exercising its\ndiscretion, the court shall consider whether the action was brought in good faith and whether the\nconduct of the governmental body had a reasonable basis in law.\n\n\nMotion to Modify Judgment              Cause No. 35621                           Page 2 oflO\n                                                380\n\f381\n\n\n\n\ndifficulty, identity of attorneys, reasonable hourly rates of attorneys on the case and other\n\nnecessary information on which attorney fees must be based on and can be determined.\n\n       The Court granted the award of attorney fees under TOMA Sec. 551.152. Thus it is\n\nclearly ascertainable that the award of attorney fees in this case does not arise under Texas Civil\n\nPractice and Remedies Code (CPRC) Section 38.001, thus this Court does not have power to\n\ntake judicial notice of attorney fees under Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code§ 38.004. See Valdez v.\n\nValdez, 930 S.W.2d 725, 732-33 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 1996, no writ) (holding section\n\n38.004 only applies to claims under section 38.001). Therefore, attorney fees award here is\n\nlegally improper.    Further the attorney fees award is improper here because plaintiffs have\n\nundisputedly proven their good faith at the trial as their report of the violation of Sec. 551.056(b)\n\nwas the only reason said violation was finally corrected by PISD after 5 months of non-\n\ncompliance with TOMA from 112009 to 5/19/2009. PX 8-11. Further this court sitting by\n\nassignment has no personal knowledge of all of the proceedings in this case, being the third\n\njudge in this case after Judge Waters and Judge Vanderpool. Further plaintiffs do not have the\n\nability to pay attorney fees, thus award is not reasonable. PISD did not plead in its original or\n\nthe amended answer the required prerequisites to attorney fees as required by TOMA Sec.\n\n551.142. PISD's first amended answer is defective as it does not contain a proper certificate of\n\nservice under TRCP and PISD failed to answer plaintiffs' second supplemental petition.\n\n       This Court has no authority or power under TOMA and no inherent authority or power to\n\nimpose attorney fees for any proceedings or filing in the appellate courts, with or without\n\nevidence being received. Defendant has provided no statutory support or case authority for it.\n\nFurther there is no evidence or insufficient evidence of filings by plaintiffs in the appellate court\n\non which to base attorney fees award on by this Court. Defendant made no argument at trial\n\n\n\n\nMotion to ModifY Judgment               Cause No. 35621                           Page 3   oflO\n                                                 381\n\f382\n\n\n\n\nconcerning its attorney fees to be based on appellate filings by plaintiffs. There is no evidence or\n\ninsufficient evidence that PISD made any responses to plaintiffs' appellate filings and that they\n\nwere accepted by appeals court. In fact, defendant's responses have been rejected by appeals\n\ncourt. In addition, plaintiffs prevailed on appeal in this case and the case was remanded back to\n\ntrial court.   Court's finding that plaintiffs made voluminous filings is legally immaterial,\n\narbitrary, and capricious because plaintiffs prevailed on appeal and defendant's responses were\n\nfound defective by appeals court. Thus there is no basis in law or fact for an award of attorney\n\nfees to PISD because plaintiffs' made filings in appeals court.        Further the court failed to\n\nsegregate appeals court's portion of the attorney fees from trial court portion of the award of\n\nattorney fees and attorney fees before remand and after remand. Since, plaintiffs prevailed on\n\nappeal and were awarded costs by appeals court, no attorney fees and costs for proceedings\n\nbefore remand can be or should be awarded to PISD.\n\n        The attempt by PISD for attorney fees is a bald attempt to intimidate plaintiffs in not\n\nfiling an appeal of this Court's judgment. Such an attempt is an outrageous affront to the purpose\n\nof open government under TOMA and will have chilling effect on citizens and taxpayers who\n\nreport violations of TOMA and seek redress. Further, issues and violations of TOMA before this\n\nCourt in this case are novel and there have not been cases involving electronic properties of\n\nboard meeting notices involving Sec. 551.056(b) and (d), technical problems, and burden of\n\nproof. This is clearly a case of first impression in these evolving legal areas. Attorney fee award\n\nthus is unjustified here and if not reversed will have chilling effect on citizens and will lead to\n\nconfusion and lack of development of the areas mentioned above. Further, government bodies\n\nwill emulate the tactics of PISD to intimidate citizens in to submission which will lead to\n\nevisceration of TOMA. PISD refused to testify and prove its attorney fees before this Court (or\n\n\n\n\nMotion to Modify Judgment              Cause No. 35621                           Page 4 oflO\n                                                382\n\f383\n\n\n\n\nappeals court), this Court failed to receive evidence concerning attorney fees, thus PISD waived\n\nand forfeited attorney fees.\n\n        Further, it is clearly ascertainable that PISD did not respond to plaintiffs' motions or\n\nletters in this Court whether or not they were \"voluminous,\" thus there is no evidence that PISD\n\never incurred attorney fees or insufficient evidence that PISD ever incurred attorney fees and to\n\nwhat extent with respect to PISD's complaints about plaintiffs filings. Further, plaintiffs cannot\n\nbe penalized or sanctioned for filing lawsuits or for their filings whether or not they were\n\nvoluminous as they a have constitutional right to seek redress of their grievances. The plain fact\n\nis there is no evidence or insufficient evidence of PISD spending any time on plaintiffs' \"filings\"\n\nin this Court or in appeals court.\n\n       An attorney fees award based on no evidence of existence and reasonableness of attorney\n\nfees viz. identity of attorneys, hours worked, tasks performed, quality and difficulty of work,\n\nhourly rate and other factors; or insufficient evidence of existence viz. identity of attorneys,\n\nhours worked, tasks performed, quality and difficulty of work, hourly rate and other factors\n\nviolates plaintiffs' constitutional rights of   due process and equal protection under Texas\n\nConstitution and 14th Amendment to the Unites States Constitution as such arbitrary and\n\ncapricious and manifestly too large and unreasonable imposition of attorney fees has no support\n\nin law or case authority. Therefore imposition of attorney fees without legal support under\n\nTOMA and without receiving evidence is not only a clear abuse of discretion but is abusive to\n\nTexas citizens and taxpayers such as plaintiffs. PISD did not offer argument at trial or in its\n\npleadings about whether plaintiffs brought this suit in good faith or being a prevailing party, or\n\nwhether its actions had a reasonable basis in law on all causes of action brought by plaintiffs.\n\nSee Sec. 551.142. PISD failed to plead prerequisites to attorney fees in its amended answer.\n\n\n\n\nMotion to Modify Judgment              Cause No. 35621                          Page 5 oflO\n                                                383\n\f384\n\n\n\n\nSec. 551.142. PISD's first amended answer is defective as it does not have proper certificate of\n\nservice under TRCP. Plaintiffs adopt and incorporate by reference their response to defendant's\n\nfirst amended answer and plaintiffs' special exceptions and affirmative defense to defendant's\n\nrequest for attorney fees and costs (which are on file) as if set forth verbatim herein.\n\n         As explained before, there is clear undisputed evidence of good faith on the part of\n\nplaintiffs in this case, thus imposition of costs is improper and unreasonable. See TOMA Sec.\n\n551.142. PX 8-11. C. Plaintiffs challenge imposition of costs on them. Plaintiffs have clearly\n\ndemonstrated good faith as shown above under TOMA. Thus under TOMA sec. 51.142, costs\n\nshould not be imposed on plaintiffs. Further even if costs were imposed, costs before remand\n\nshould be segregated from costs after remand and such costs before remand should be excluded\n\nfrom costs to be awarded to PISD. This is proper because plaintiffs prevailed on appeal before\n\nthe   th court of appeal and the appeals court granted costs to plaintiffs. Any costs associated with\nPISD's misguided summary judgment motion which was erroneously granted by the district\n\ncourt (Judge Waters) should be excluded from costs. PISD offered no evidence of lack of good\n\nfaith on the part of plaintiffs and did not even offer an argument on it. Thus there is no evidence\n\nor insufficient evidence of lack of good faith or bad faith in the record on the part of plaintiffs.\n\n         This Court which is sitting by assignment did not hold any proceeding before October\n\n2012 when two other Judges (Judge Vanderpool and Judge Waters) presided over the case. The\n\nCourt thus cannot take judicial notice of matters it is not knowledgeable about and which did not\n\noccur before it. Further, plaintiffs challenge the reasonableness of the attorney fees because the\n\ncurrent judge (Judge Lopez) only held one proceeding on 10/9/2013 for one day trial. PISD filed\n\nno response to several motions filed by plaintiffs. Thus PISD cannot recover attorney fees for\n\ntime it did not expend for one year in responding to plaintiffs' motions. Under Judge Vanderpool\n\n\n\n\nMotion to Modify Judgment                Cause No. 35621                            Page 6   oflO\n                                                  384\n\f385\n\n\n\n\nonly two brief hearings took place and PISD failed to file any responses to plaintiffs' motions.\n\nUnder Judge Waters only 1 brief hearing occurred. It is thus obvious, that in more than 4 years\n\nof this lawsuit, only minimal activity has occurred. Attorney fees in the amount of $30,000 are\n\nthus manifestly too large and unreasonable considering the lack of PISD's responses and only 3\n\nhearings and a 1 day trial.\n\n        Further, it is clearly ascertainable from the few responses PISD filed that they were\n\nunserious, lacked references to record, and failed to cite pertinent applicable case authorities.\n\nSome of the responses were found defective by the       th Court of appeals e.g. lacked proper\ncertificates of service and certificates of compliance and PISD was forced tore-file. The quality\n\nof the PISD's filings has been questionable. Thus the $30,000 attorney fees are unreasonable.\n\nThis Court cannot grant attorney fees for proceedings conducted in appellate court in which\n\nplaintiffs were granted costs of appeal on remand. Further plaintiffs prevailed on appeal before\n\nthe   th court of appeals, thus attorney fees and costs before remand of the case must be\nsegregated and excluded from any calculations of attorney fees that could possibly be awarded to\n\nPISD. Given the lack of evidence, it is not surprising that PISD counsel refused to testify\n\nconcerning attorney fees at trial.   As such, there is no evidence, alternatively insufficient\n\nevidence for this Court to base its award of attorney fees. Thus the award of attorney fees and\n\ncosts is legally improper, manifestly too large, unreasonable, and completely unsupported by\n\nevidence and should be vacated and denied. The judgment of the Court should be modified\n\naccordingly.\n\n3.      As explained previously, the Court erred in denying plaintiffs' motions to exclude\n\nevidence concerning SchoolCenter, BoardBook, and Lee Carter. The record clearly shows that\n\nPISD repeatedly refused, misled, obstructed discovery and further refused to supplement its\n\n\n\n\nMotion to ModifY Judgment             Cause No. 35621                          Page 7 oflO\n                                               385\n\f386\n\n\n\n\nanswers to interrogatories and other discovery requests concerning BoardBook service. See PX\n\n8-11. PISD even obstructed and misled the Attorney General of Texas when it knew that PISD\n\nallegedly had made payments to BoardBook and SchoolCenter and others for services. These\n\nand other records concerning SchoolCenter and BoardBook and other employees ot vendors such\n\nas Lee Carter should have been produced in the discovery process. PISD refused to do so\n\napparently fearing no sanctions for its obstruction. PISD even declared that BoardBook service\n\nand PISD's contract with it were irrelevant and outside of the purview of Texas Rules of Civil\n\nProcedure. Plaintiffs adopt and incorporate by reference Plaintiffs' Motion for Sanctions which\n\nwas filed on 9/9/2009 and their Motion for Order to Produce Documents without Objection filed\n\non 6/9/2009, Plaintiffs' Motion for Ruling Post-Remand Discovery, to Exclude, for Inferences,\n\nto Compel discovery from defendant, and For Sanctions Filed on 6/5/12, as if set forth verbatim\n\nherein. The Court's refusal to exclude set up plaintiffs for trial by ambush and surprise which\n\nviolates their due process, open courts, and equal protection rights under Texas Constitution and\n\nthe 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n\n          4. PISD's trial evidence in its support was no more than speculation, hearsay, surmise\n\nand bare opinions offering no substantiation or documents in support, which is no legal evidence\n\nat all.    Kindred v. Con/Chem., Inc., 650 S.W. 2d 61, 63 (Tex. 1983). PISD's evidence in its\n\nsupport must be struck and disregarded.\n\n          5.     As explained before, PISD did not carry its Burden of Proof in the matter of\n\nshowing good faith under TOMA Sec. 551.056(d). PISD admitted that its website notices did\n\nnot appear on its website for 11 meetings from 1/15/2009 to 5119/2009 for 5 long months. PISD\n\nfails the average person's due diligence standard here. After \"forgetting\" to check whether\n\ninternet notice for its 1115/2009 meeting actually appeared on its website, PISD continued to\n\n\n\n\nMotion to ModifY Judgment              Cause No. 35621                         Page 8 of 10\n                                                386\n\f387\n\n\n\n\n\"forget\" to check its website for 5 months to see whether it was complying with TOMA. \"Opps\n\nwe forgot\" and \"Oops we don't care to check\" fail average person's good faith standard and\n\ncertainly fail under TOMA Sec. 551.056(d) good faith standard. Negligence, forgetting is not a\n\ntechnical problem as PISD suggests and is certainly not beyond the control of PISD for 5\n\nmonths.\n\n       The judgment of the Court should be modified as requested below.\n\n                                              Prayer\n\n       FOR THE FOREGOING REASONS, plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court set this\n\nmotion for hearing, and upon hearing, grant plaintiffs' motion to modify judgment, modify\n\njudgment in accordance with this motion, and\n\n       Vacate the award of attorney fees in the amount of $30,000 to defendant PISD, vacate the\n\naward of costs to PISD, deny defendant's request for attorney fees and costs, and delay the award\n\nof attorney fees and costs until appellate process is completed.\n\n       Further plaintiffs request judgment be modified so that the judgment for defendant is set\n\naside and judgment for plaintiffs is entered on all causes of action, void all actions taken in\n\nviolation of TOMA, order reinstatement of Terrell as a teacher with defendant and award\n\ndamages of back wages and benefits to her, declare plaintiffs the prevailing party in this suit, and\n\ngrant all other relief requested by plaintiffs in their original petition and two supplemental\n\npetitions. Plaintiffs further request that Court grant all other and further relief, at law or in\n\nequity, to which they may justly be entitled to receive.\n\n                                                       Respectfully submitted,\n\n\n\n\n                                                       Rebecca Terrell\n\n\nMotion to Modify Judgment               Cause No. 35621                          Page 9 of 10\n                                                 387\n\f    388\n\n\n\n\nI                                                      Chandrashekhar Thanedar\n                                                       Plaintiffs\n                                                       6503 Dancing Ct.\n                                                       San Antonio, Texas 78244\n                                                       (956) 445-3107\n                                                       (512) 271-6840 Fax\n                                                       rterrell152@gmail.com\n\n                                  CERTIFICATE OF SERVICE\n\n           The undersigned certify that a true and correct copy of the foregoing document was\n\n    served upon the following by USPS Priority Mail on November 22, 2013 to\n\n    W.

We further request that the court reconsider its refusal to hold hearing on the\n\n                  newly discovered evidence as presented in the motion for new trial. We request that the court\n\n                  grant new trial on all causes of action and issues including imposition of attorney fees and costs.\n\n                  The court's plenary power has not expired and is still in force 30 days after said motions were\n\n                  denied by operation of law.        See Tex. R. Civ. Pro. 329b. We further request that the court\n\n                  provide and explain its reasons as to why it denied said motions so its decisions can be fully\n\n                  understood by parties so as to allow a meaningful appeal of this court's decisions and actions\n\n                  before the 7th court of appeals.\n\n                          1. Violation of Plaintiffs' Federal and Texas Constitutional Rights:                                       The record\n\n                  shows that this court, without any basis in fact or law, wrongly declared at trial that the appeals\n\n                  court only wanted trial on Sec. 551.056 of Texas Open Meetings Act (TOMA). This court then\n\n\n\n\n                                                                          403\n\fFrom: R Terrell         Fax: (512) 271-6840       To: Sandra Burkett     Fax: +1 (806) 669-805 3   Page 3 of 8 0210512014 10:08\n\n                  404\n\n\n\n\n                  denied and failed to hold trial on plaintiffs' other causes of action i.e. TOMA sections 551.041,\n\n                  551.051, 551.043, 551.045, 551.074, and 551.101. It is abundantly clear that the 7th court of\n\n                  appeals made no such ruling in its opinion on the first appeal in this case. This was pointed out\n\n                  to this court and plaintiffs have objected to the court's arbitrary declaration and refusal to hold\n\n                  trial on the above causes. This improper denial and failure violates plaintiffs' civil rights,\n\n                  fundamental rights, and federal Constitutional due process and equal rights under the 14th\n\n                  Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and violation of our rights under Texas Constitution Article\n\n                  1 Sections 3, 13, 19, and 27. This court closed it doors to plaintiffs by refusing to hold trial on\n\n                  plaintiffs' complaints under TOMA sections 551.041, 551.051, 551.043, 551.045, 551.074, and\n\n                  551.101 in violation of our constitutional rights. No objection to such plain blatant error and\n\n                  constitutional violation need be made, nor required. Such refusal and denial lowers the regard of\n\n                  Texas and United States Citizens towards the judges and the justice system. We as citizens and\n\n                  tax payers are greatly troubled that after 5 long years of being gamed, drawn out, punished, and\n\n                  impoverished, we got deprived of our constitutional and fundamental rights. What is the point in\n\n                  filing complaints if courts will ignore the citizens? We request the court to grant new trial on all\n\n                  matters and hear the newly discovered evidence presented in the motion for new trial.\n\n                          The record of the trial shows that this court refused and failed to rule on plaintiffs' certain\n\n                  trial exhibits during trial (e.g. plaintiffs' trial exhibit 1 concerning internet notices of meetings\n\n                  and their electronic properties) stating that court will rule on them later at some other time.\n\n                  Plaintiffs repeatedly objected and offered proof. This court attempted to rule, deny, and return\n\n                  the trial exhibits to plaintiffs outside of trial, after the trial was over and after the court had\n\n                  rendered judgment. We are greatly troubled by these actions of the court which were highly\n\n                  damaging and prejudicial to plaintiffs. Such actions lower citizens' regard for the judiciary.\n\n\n\n\n                  Motion for Reconsideration                 Cause No. 35621                                    Page 2 of7\n                                                                       404\n\fFrom: R Terrell          Fax: (512) 271-6840       To: Sandra Burkett     Fax: +1 (806) 669-8053   Page 4 of 8 0210512014 10:08\n\n                  405\n\n\n\n\n                  Court's refusal to rule on plaintiffs' certain trial exhibits during trial of this case infected the trial\n\n                  with chaos and confusion, greatly harming plaintiffs' case because plaintiffs were prevented\n\n                  from properly and effectively presenting their case. Court's actions above were arbitrary without\n\n                  any basis in law, biased for the defendant and violated our constitutional due process and equal\n\n                  protection rights under Texas Constitution (Art.l, Sees. 3, 13, 19,27) and the U.S. Constitution.\n\n                           The court wrongly permitted testimony over our repeated objections on a \"third party\n\n                  vendor\" which defendant claimed as allegedly causing legal violation of TOMA Sec. 551.056.\n\n                  As we have contended, such new evidence must be excluded because defendant PISD\n\n                  deliberately refused to provide discovery and deliberately refused and failed to supplement\n\n                  discovery with respect to the purported \"third party vendor.\" As explained previously, we are\n\n                  entitled to discovery and supplementation according to the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. See\n\n                  TRCP Rule 193.5, 193.6. This court should have excluded the testimony and should have\n\n                  granted new trial to obtain discovery concerning the \"third party vendor.\" Court's failure to do\n\n                  so was highly prejudicial and damaging to plaintiffs as we were prevented from effectively\n\n                  examining the witnesses and were prevented from presenting our side effectively. The court's\n\n                  failure to exclude evidence or allow discovery on the new evidence made the trial a trial by\n\n                  surprise and ambush violating our rights of equal rights and due process under Texas\n\n                  Constitution (Art. 1, Sees. 3,13,19,27) and 14th Amend. to U.S. Constitution. This is the reason\n\n                  why the case was remanded in the first place by the 7th Court.\n\n                           As explained in our motion to modifY judgment and motion for new trial above, it is clear\n\n                  that the Texas Open Meetings Act does not authorize this court to take ''judicial notice\" of\n\n                   defendant's attorney fees without receiving evidence as to the amount or reasonableness and\n\n                   further that court's award of fees is improper under TOMA. TOMA Sec. 551.142. There is\n\n\n\n\n                   Motion for Reconsideration                 Cause No. 35621                                   Page 3 of7\n                                                                        405\n\fFrom: R Terrell         Fax: (512) 271-6840       To: Sandra Burkett         Fax: +1 (806) 669-8053   Page 5 of 8 0210512014 10:08\n\n                  406\n\n\n\n\n                  absolutely no evidence in the record as to the reasonableness of the $30,000 the court granted\n\n                  PISD in attorney fees or the hours worked, tasks performed, and rates per hour, and by whom.\n\n                  Court's award of attorney fees of $30,000 under TOMA1 is arbitrary, capricious, punitive, and\n\n                  legally improper. Court's award violates plaintiffs' due process rights and equal rights under the\n\n                  Texas Constitution Article 1 Sections 3, 13, 19, and 27 and the 14th Amendment to the U.S.\n\n                  Constitution as we are entitled to the due process and equal rights of contesting the\n\n                  reasonableness of attorney fees awarded to defendant by examining and questioning defendant's\n\n                  attorney and any records proving the existence and reasonableness of the $30,000 award. We\n\n                  object to the attorney fee award because it has no basis in law, because it arbitrary, and because it\n\n                  is punitive in nature. Attorney fees are not mandatory, but if awarded under TOMA, TOMA\n\n                  only permits \"reasonable\" attorney fees and the reasonableness must be proven at trial. See\n\n                  TOMA Sec. 551.142. The language of TOMA is plain and clear that it does not authorize this\n\n                  court to award punitive attorney fees and does not permit a judge to be an advocate for defendant\n\n                  and for defendant's attorney fees. Here, this court granted attorney fees under TOMA, and not\n\n                  under the Texas Civil Practices and Remedies Code (TCPRC), thus TCPRC Sec. 38 does not\n\n                  apply here. Further, defendant waived and forfeited its claim to attorney fees when it expressly\n\n                  declined to testifY concerning its request for attorney fees.                         Defendant's subsequent\n\n                  correspondence with us makes it clear that its only interest was to stop the appeal currently\n\n                  before the 7th COA. This court should grant this motion and reverse its judgment with respect to\n\n                  the award of attorney fees to PISD, and grant new trial on the issue of attorney fees. The record\n\n\n                  1\n                    PISD's alleges its claim for attorney fees under TOMA Sec. 551.142. The award of attorneys' fees in\n                  this case does not arise under Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code (CPRC) section 38.001, thus this\n                  Court does not have power to take judicial notice of attorney fees under Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code §\n                  38.004. See Valdez v. Valdez, 930 S.W.2d 725, 732-33 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 1996, no writ)\n                  (holding section 38.004 only applies to claims under section 38.001).\n\n\n\n                  Motion for Reconsideration                Cause No. 35621                                        Page 4 of7\n                                                                       406\n\fFrom: R Terrell          Fax: (512) 271-6840      To: Sandra Burkett         Fax: +1 (806) 669-8053   Page 6 of 8 0210512014 10:08\n\n                  407\n\n\n\n\n                  is clear PISD attorneys maintained a very low amount of activity and work in this case and the\n\n                  award of $30,000 is grossly unreasonable.            PISD must be required under law, and TOMA\n\n                  requires that PISD prove its attorney fees at trial. Defendant refused to do so. Further judicial\n\n                  efficiency requires that award of attorney fees be delayed until appellate process is concluded.\n\n                           The court failed to provide detailed reasons as to why it found that we acted in bad faith\n\n                  when defendant presented no evidence or testimony at trial to show whether we brought the suit\n\n                  in bad faith. Court's detailed reasoning in this regard would assist the court of appeals and\n\n                  parties in arguing the reasons in a meaningful way before the 7th court of appeals. Defendant\n\n                  presented no evidence of bad faith or lack of good faith on our part in bringing this suit.                        The\n\n                  only evidence presented at the trial in this regard by us clearly showed that defendant's 5 month\n\n                  long legal violations of TOMA Sec. 551.056(b) got corrected only because of our report to\n\n                  defendant in that regard on May 15, 2009. How is this lack of good faith? This court held only\n\n                  one day hearing (final trial) in this case and lacks any personal knowledge of prior proceedings.\n\n                  Under TOMA, evidence and testimony at trial on \"bad faith\" or lack of good faith on our part in\n\n                  bringing suit and reasonableness and existence of the amount of attorney fees was absolutely\n\n                  necessary so plaintiffs would have the chance to examine, question, and challenge such\n\n                  testimony and evidence. This court cannot just assume or advocate for defendant concerning\n\n                  award of attorney fees or a lack of good faith. TOMA Sec. 551.142. Court's finding ofbad faith\n\n                  in bringing this suit and award of attorney fees is not only arbitrary, capricious and without basis\n\n                  in law or evidence, but it is biased for defendant and punishes and victimizes plaintiffs by further\n\n                  depriving us of due process and equal rights under the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution\n\n                  and Texas Constitution Article 1 Sections 3, 13, 19, and 27. There is no support in law or\n\n                  evidence for court's finding of\"bad faith\" in bringing this suit and for the attorney fee award to\n\n\n\n\n                   Motion for Reconsideration                Cause No. 35621                                       Page 5 of7\n                                                                       407\n\fFrom: R Terrell         Fax: (512) 271-6840       To: Sandra Burkett          Fax: +1 (806) 669-8053   Page 7 of 8 02105/2014 10:08\n\n                  408\n\n\n\n\n                  PISD and court actions deprive us of our good name and livelihood violating our fundamental\n\n                  and constitutional rights as stated above. Court should grant new trial on the issue of award of\n\n                  attorney fees to defendant and on the issue of its bad faith finding.\n\n                          How Texas citizens and taxpayers like us are treated by this court will be of interest to\n\n                  Texas citizens and will be watched for years to come. This court's decisions will have chilling\n\n                  effect on Texas citizens' participation in their government if not modified by this court and if\n\n                  new trial is not granted.

Pursuant to TRCP Rule 298, plaintiffs\n\n                  now request the following additional or amended findings of fact and conclusions oflaw be filed.\n\n                          Plaintiffs affirm that to the extent any Finding of Fact reflects a legal conclusion, it shall\n\n                  be to that extent deemed a Conclusion of Law, and vice versa.\n\n                                              ADDITIONAL OR AMENDED FINDINGS OF FACT\n\n                          1.     On October 9, 2013, at the trial in this case Court directed defendant Pampa\n\n                  Independent School District's (defendant or PISD) attorneys to testifY in the matter of\n\n                  defendant's claim for attorney fees as to the amount and reasonableness of attorney fees.\n\n\n\n                                                                          391\n\fFrom: R Terrell          Fax: (512) 271·6840         To: Sandra Burkett         Fax: +1 iS06) 669-8053   Page 3 of 1012102/2013 4:18\n\n                  392\n\n\n\n\n                  Defendant's attorney Mr. Arnold declined and failed to do so and asked the Court to take judicial\n\n                  notice of the file and award attorney fees to ·defendant.\n\n                           2. There is no evidence or insufficient evidence of defendant's claim for attorney fees for\n\n                   $30,000 or for any amount, its appropriateness, or its reasonableness.\n\n                           3. Plaintiffs' reported defendant's non-compliance with Texas Open Meetings Act\n\n                  (TOMA) Sec. 551.056(b) to defendant on May 15, 2009 and their report was the only reason said\n\n                  non-compliance was corrected after 5 months of non-compliance with TOMA by defendant.\n\n                   Plaintiffs' good faith was not disputed by defendant at trial. Defendant did not offer evidence of\n\n                   lack of good faith. There is no evidence that plaintiffs' brought this action in bad faith. To the\n\n                   contrary, plaintiffs prevailed on appeal in this lawsuit and the appeals court ordered defendant to\n\n                   pay costs in this case to plaintiffs. Plaintiffs' case clearly has merit. As a result of this lawsuit,\n\n                   defendant made several changes and reformed its practices to ensure compliance with TOMA.\n\n                   The record in this case shows that defendant mostly did not file responses to plaintiffs' motions\n\n                   or filings. There is no evidence or insufficient evidence that plaintiffs made voluminous filings\n\n                   or that they were not necessary to prosecute the case. Thus, there is no evidence of time spent by\n\n                   PISD on responding to plaintiffs motions either before trial court or appellate court. The Court\n\n                   finds that appeals court rejected PISD's filings and such filings often lacked compliance with\n\n                   appellate rules e.g. citation to record or legal authorities. There have been three judges who have\n\n                   presided over this case and this Court held no proceedings before the trial on October 9, 2013.\n\n                           4.    Court declined to rule on admissibility of plaintiffs' trial exhibits PX 1 (CD of\n\n                   electronic notices and document properties of 22 meetings at issue in this trial), 19, 20, 23, and\n\n                   25 during the trial. Court rules that said trial exhibits PX 1, 19, 20, 23, and 25 are now admitted.\n\n\n\n\n                   Request for Additional or Amended                Cause No. 35621                                     Page 2 of9\n                   Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\n                                                                          392\n\fFrom: R Terrell         Fax: (512) 271-6840          To: Sandra Burkett         Fax: +1 (806i 669-8053   Page 4 of 1012/0212013 4:18\n\n                  393\n\n\n\n\n                          5. PISD admitted at trial that internet notice for its 1115/2009 board meeting did not\n\n                  appear on its website. However, there is no evidence or insufficient evidence that defendant\n\n                  employed SchoolCenter to create a new website and or to transfer link to its internet notices to a\n\n                  new website before said meeting on 1115/2009.\n\n                          6. Defendant's claim that it employed SchoolCenter to create a new website, to transfer\n\n                  link to notices was made for the first time at trial. Defendant did not disclose this information\n\n                  during discovery process to plaintiffs, nor did it timely correct or supplement its discovery\n\n                  responses in this regard before trial under Texas Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\n                          7. Defendant maintained and managed its own website and posted website internet\n\n                  notices under TOMA Sec. 551.056(b) through at least January 15, 2009. There is no evidence or\n\n                  insufficient evidence that a link to BoardBook existed on defendant's website on or before\n\n                  January 15, 2009 or that internet notices under Sec. 551.056(b) appeared on defendant's website\n\n                  before defendant employed a third party vendor- SchoolCenter. Because PISD admitted that the\n\n                  internet notice for 1115/2009 did not appear on its website, Court finds that the link to internet\n\n                  notices did not exist on PISD's website before PISD allegedly employed SchoolCenter to create\n\n                  a new website.\n\n                          8. There is no evidence or insufficient evidence that defendant had BoardBook service to\n\n                  post internet notices under TOMA sec. 551.056(b) or payments to BoardBook for its service.\n\n                  There is no evidence or insufficient evidence that defendant executed a contract with BoardBook\n\n                  or that such contract was ever renewed, especially before or during the time period for which\n\n                  defendant claims good faith exception under Sec. 551.056(d).\n\n                          9. Defendant claimed at trial that it contracted a third party vendor SchoolCenter to\n\n                  create a new website and transfer link to internet notices. There is no evidence or insufficient\n\n\n\n                  Request for Additional or Amended                 Cause No. 35621                                     Page 3 of9\n                  Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\n                                                                          393\n\fFrom: R Terrell         Fax: (512) 271-6840          To: Sandra Burkett         Fax: +1 i806J 669-8053   Page 5 of 101210212013 4:18\n\n                  394\n\n\n\n\n                  evidence that defendant contracted a third party vendor School Center to create a new website for\n\n                  defendant or transfer or maintain a link to internet notices to the new website before the time\n\n                  period for which defendant claims good faith exception under Sec. 551.056(d).\n\n                          10. Defendant admitted that it did not comply with Sec.551.056(b) for 11 board meetings\n\n                  held from January 15, 2009 through May 19, 2009.\n\n                          11. Defendant maintained and managed its website through January 15, 2009 board\n\n                  meeting, however it did not comply with Sec.551.056(b) for the January 15, 2009 board meeting.\n\n                  Further, there is no evidence or insufficient evidence that defendant's new website was created\n\n                  72 hours before defendant's January 15, 2009 board meeting. Further there is no evidence that\n\n                  SchoolCenter was employed to create new website before the January 15, 2009 board meeting.\n\n                          12.      Plaintiffs (plaintiff Thanedar) reported to defendant on May 15, 2009 that\n\n                  defendant's internet board meeting notices did not appear on its website. Defendant fixed its\n\n                  non-compliance with TOMA due to plaintiffs' said report of non-compliance.\n\n                          13. There is no evidence or insufficient evidence that defendant verified or checked that\n\n                  its internet board meeting notices actually appeared on its website during the period from\n\n                  January 2009 through May 15, 2009.\n\n                          14. There is no evidence or insufficient evidence that defendant verified that it actually\n\n                  complied with TOMA Sec. 551.056(b) during the 5 month period for which it claims good faith\n\n                  exception under Sec. 551.056(d) until plaintiffs reported non-compliance on 5/15/2009.\n\n                          15. Lee Carter was PISD's webmaster and managed and maintained defendant's website\n\n                   in the month January 2009 and was responsible for maintaining the link to PISD's internet\n\n                  notices on its website during January 2009 or concerning the internet notice of the 1115/2009\n\n                  board meeting.\n\n\n\n                  Request for Additional or Amended                 Cause No. 35621                                     Page 4 of9\n                  Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\n                                                                          394\n\fFrom: R Terrell          Fax: (512) 271-6840          To: Sandra Burkett         Fax: +1 (S061 669-8053   Page 6 of 10 12/0212013 4:18\n\n                  395\n\n\n\n\n                           16.     Defendant concealed and failed to disclose the identity and the central role of\n\n                  SchoolCenter to Texas Attorney General and plaintiffs in response to plaintiffs' Open Records\n\n                  Request or Public Infonnation Request per Gov't Code Ch. 552. Defendant further concealed\n\n                  and failed to disclose documents to plaintiffs concerning license fee payments to BoardBook and\n\n                  SchoolCenter for the purpose of their Open records Request or during discovery process.\n\n                           17. Court finds that there is no material question of fact remaining concerning plaintiffs'\n\n                  causes of action in TOMA Sections 551.041, 551.043, 551.045(d), 551.051, 551.101, and\n\n                  551.074(b ). Court declined to try plaintiffs' said causes of action at the trial of this case and no\n\n                  evidence or insufficient evidence was pennitted or presented concerning said causes of action.\n\n                           18.     There is no evidence or insufficient evidence that defendant's internet notices\n\n                  independently appeared on Google or BoardBook. Court finds such infonnation or evidence\n\n                  legally irrelevant, speculative and that it does not comply with TOMA.\n\n                           19. There is no evidence or insufficient evidence that PISD \"released\" or checked\n\n                  internet notices in BoardBook during Jan. 2009 through May 19, 2009 regarding any or all its\n\n                  board meetings. Such infonnation even if true is legally irrelevant, speculative and immaterial.\n\n                           20. There is no evidence or insufficient evidence that defendant ever checked or verified\n\n                  that the link to internet notices was transferred over to its new website during January 2009 to\n\n                  May 15, 2009 or that defendant required the third party vendor SchoolCenter to timely transfer\n\n                  said link to internet notices to its new website.\n\n                           21. Plaintiff Terrell's employment contract was tenninated by defendant in the Board\n\n                  meeting held on 3/26/2009. Voidance of defendant's action terminating Terrell's employment\n\n                  requires reinstatement of Terrell and payment of back wages and benefits until she is legally\n\n                  terminated under the Ed. Code in compliance with TOMA in a legally convened Board meeting.\n\n\n\n                   Request for Additional or Amended                 Cause No. 35621                                      Page 5 of9\n                   Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\n                                                                           395\n\fFrom: R Terrell          Fax: (512) 271-6840          To: Sandra Burkett         Fax: +1 (806) 669-8053   Page 7 of 10 12/0212013 4:1 S\n\n                  396\n\n\n\n\n                                        ADDITIONAL OR AMENDED CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n\n                           1. Defendant did not meet the prerequisites for attorney fees and costs award under\n\n                  Texas Open Meetings Act.\n\n                           2. Defendant's claim for attorney fees does not arise from Sec. 38.001 of the Civil\n\n                  Practice and Remedies Code (CPRC). Further, Ch. 38 of the CPRC does not apply to this case.\n\n                           3. The Court does not have the power or discretion to take judicial notice of the file in\n\n                  this case under TOMAto award attorney fees without receiving evidence concerning attorney\n\n                  fees and its reasonableness. The Court does not have the power or discretion to award attorney\n\n                  fees incurred or claimed by PISD for appeals in this case.\n\n                           4. Plaintiffs affirmatively established good faith under TOMA and brought the action in\n\n                  good faith.        Defendant did not dispute plaintiffs' good faith assertion nor introduced any\n\n                  evidence to the contrary. There is no evidence of lack of good faith on 1he part of plaintiffs in\n\n                  bringing this action.\n\n                           5. PISD's claim for attorney fees is denied due to lack of evidence and because PISD\n\n                  forfeited its claim due to its refusal to testifY and because it is legally improper.\n\n                           6. Defendant had the burden ofproofunder Texas Open Meetings Act Sec. 551.056(d) to\n\n                  prove good faith as to its admitted non-compliance with Sec. 551.056(b) for defendant's 11\n\n                  board meetings held during the time period January 2009 to May 19, 2009.\n\n                           7. There is no evidence or insufficient evidence that defendant's non-compliance with\n\n                  TOMA Sec. 551.056(b) was done in good faith. Defendant failed to meet its burden of proof of\n\n                   good faith under Sec. 551.056(d).\n\n                           8. Defendant obstructed discovery in this lawsuit by concealing and failing to disclose\n\n                  the identity and role of School Center and further concealed and failed to disclose other discovery\n\n\n\n                   Request for Additional or Amended                 Cause No. 35621                                      Page 6 of9\n                   Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\n                                                                           396\n\fFrom: R Terrell          Fax: (512) 271-6840          To: Sandra Burkett         Fax: +1 (806) 669-8053   Page 8 of 10 1210212013 4:1 S\n\n                  397\n\n\n\n\n                   and license fee payments to BoardBook and SchoolCenter. Defendant's obstruction of justice is\n\n                   sanctionable. All evidence concerning SchoolCenter and BoardBook must be and is excluded\n\n                   from trial ofthe case and is disregarded. Boothe v. Hausler, 766 S.W.2d 788, 789 (Tex. 1989).\n\n                           9. Court rules for plaintiffs on all counts and grants all relief requested. Court orders that\n\n                   plaintiff Terrell is reinstated to her previous position as a teacher at PISD and awards back pay\n\n                   and benefits. Terrell's termination in the 3/26/2009 board meeting is voided.\n\n                           10. Court concludes that plaintiffs' claims must be decided based on the Exact and\n\n                   Literal compliance standard applied to TOMA cases by the Texas Supreme Court. The Court\n\n                   rules in favor of plaintiffs on all of their causes of action in this case whether or not tried before\n\n                   the court on October 9, 2013.\n\n                           11. Defendant's claim that its internet notices independently appeared on BoardBook's\n\n                   website or on \"Google,\" whether true or not, does not comply with TOMA Sec. 551.056(b).\n\n                           12. Defendant's claim that it worked in BoardBook or checked its work in BoardBook is\n\n                   irrelevant and does not comply with TOMA Sec. 551.056(b) and does not meet the burden of\n\n                   good faith because PISD failed to check its own website for compliance with Sec. 551.056(b)\n\n                   during the entire time period of 5 months in 2009 for which it claims good faith.\n\n                           13. Plaintiffs are interested persons under TOMA. Plaintiffs have a particularized injury\n\n                   caused by defendant by its action taken under TOMA terminating Terrell's contract. Plaintiffs\n\n                   have requested relief of reinstatement of Terrell to her teaching position at defendant and stated\n\n                   that Terrell will resume her teaching position upon reinstatement. Thus plaintiffs have standing\n\n                   to maintain this lawsuit and have had standing for the duration of the lawsuit. This court has\n\n                   jurisdiction through out the duration ofthis lawsuit. TOMA does not require a plaintiff to be a\n\n                   taxpayer ofthe government entity sued under TOMA. Further TOMA neither requires a litigant\n\n\n\n                   Request for Additional or Amended                 Cause No. 35621                                      Page 7 of9\n                   Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\n                                                                           397\n\fFrom: R Terrell          Fax: (512) 271-6840          To: Sandra Burkett         Fax: +1 (806) 669-8053   Page 9 of 10 1210212013 4:18\n\n\n                  398\n\n\n\n\n                  to live within the boundaries of the government body nor does it require for a litigant to prove\n\n                  interest over and above that of general public. Plaintiffs have shown that they are interested in\n\n                  defendant government body and its functioning. Plaintiffs lived in Pampa within the boundaries\n\n                  of defendant when the alleged violations of TOMA occurred and injury of termination to\n\n                  plaintiff Terrell occurred in the school year 2008-2009 by PISD's action taken under TOMA.\n\n                           14. TOMA is not a scheme for providing individual notice, nor does it have any due\n\n                  process implication. Thus whether or not plaintiffs attended the 3/26/2009 board meeting or had\n\n                  actual notice of it or of Terrell's termination in said meeting is irrelevant under TOMA.\n\n                           15. Plaintiffs presented sufficient evidence to prove that continuance of the trial was\n\n                  justified and should be granted. Plaintiffs' motions to reset trial date, compel discovery, to\n\n                  exclude evidence, and for post-remand discovery are justified and should be granted.\n\n                           16. Defendant's failure to competently oversee transfer of link is not a technical problem\n\n                  under TOMA and was not beyond the control of defendant for 5 months from January 2009 to\n\n                  May 19, 2009. A good faith attempt to post internet notice under TOMA 551.056 must involve\n\n                  verification as to whether such notice actually appears on government body's website. PISD did\n\n                  not do so even once in 5 months. PISD fails the reasonable person standard of due diligence.\n\n                  PISD did not attempt to post TOMA internet notices in good faith. Had defendant checked its\n\n                  website for internet notices even once during said 5 months as was its practice in 2008, it would\n\n                  have promptly discovered non-compliance with TOMA Sec. 551.056(b ). The Court finds that\n\n                   lack of due care and oversight or negligence or incompetence, as here, is not a technical problem\n\n                   and that it is not beyond PISD's control.                The Court finds that PISD exhibited conscious\n\n                   indifference to the required compliance with TOMA Sec.551.056(b) and with respect to other\n\n                  violations of TOMA asserted by plaintiffs. The Court concludes that given the extended long\n\n\n\n                   Request for Additional or Amended                 Cause No. 35621                                      Page 8 of9\n                   Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\n                                                                           398\n\fFrom: R Terrell         Fax: (512) 271-6840         To: Sandra Burkett         Fax: +1 (806) 669-8053   Page 10of 1012102/2013 4:18\n\n\n                  399\n\n\n\n\n                  time period involved in non-compliance with TOMA i.e. 5 months, any problem in this matter\n\n                  was not technical in nature, nor was it beyond the control of PISD. Court finds that the non-\n\n                  compliance with TOMA for 11 board meetings from 112009 thru 5/19/2009 was in bad faith.\n\n                          Plaintiffs request that Court file the above additional and amended findings of fact and\n\n                  conclusions of law in this case and declare that to the extent any Finding of Fact reflects a legal\n\n                  conclusion, it shall be to that extent deemed a Conclusion of Law, and vice versa.\n\n                                                                                  Respectfully submitted,\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                  Rebecca Terrell\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                  Chandrashekhar Thanedar, Plaintiffs\n                                                                                  6503 Dancing Ct., San Antonio, TX 78244\n                                                                                  (956) 445-3107; (512) 271-6840 Fax\n                                                                                  rterrell15 2@gmail.com\n\n                                                      CERTIFICATE OF SERVICE\n\n                          The undersigned certifY that a true and correct copy of the foregoing document was\n\n                  served by USPS first class mail on December 2, 2013 on W.

The front door as a place to post notices is\n\nneither secure, nor convenient, nor appropriate, nor in compliance with the Act The place of the\n\nnotice of meeting i.e. taping the notices to the front door is in violation of the Open Meetings\n\nAct. The Open Meetings Act expressly states where the notice of a meeting shall be posted and\n\nthe place varies depending on the governing body posting the notice. The place of posting for a\n\nSchool District is mandated to be a \"Bulletin Board.\"\n\n          The Tex. Gov't Code §551.051:      S~hool   District: Plaee of Posting Notice specifically\n\nstates:\n\n          \"A school district shall post notice of each meeting ·on a bulletin board at a place\n          convenient to the public in the central administrative office of the district.\" Tex.\n          Gov't Code §551.051\n\n          As Defendant tapes the notices to the front door of its administration building and does\n\nnot post notices on a bulletin board as mandated by the Act. defendant is in violation of the Act.\n\n          10.

Gov't Code Ch. 552 by Plaintiffs. This contrivance and\n\nmanipulation shows conscious guilt and willful conduct to disregard law. See Exhibits 1 ~thru 6.\n\n        (c) The above website notices were posted on May 19, 2009 on the Defendant's internet\n\nwebsite in the ''Board.Book\" nestled deep in the website so as to be less obvious and less\n\nconspicuous to public. On May 19, 2009, Defendant's Board was reorganized after a new board\n\nmember was elected and sworn in on that date.\n\n       (d) Defendant bas in fact admitted that it did not post any internet website notices of\n\nmeetings for the school year 2008..2009 with respect to the meetings referred above as of May\n\n15, 2009. The internet website notices posted for the said meetings on May 19, 2009 do not have\n\nthe name of the designated person under the Act posting it and/or such person's signature or\n\ncertificates of compliance with the Act, and dates and times of postings. See Exhibits 1 - 6.\n\nSuch postings of notices are in violation of the Act, Tex. Gov't Code §551.043(b) and §551.056.\n\n        12. Defendant taped a notice of meeting on its building's front door on Friday, May 15,\n\n2009 for a board meeting on May 18, 2009 and removed that taped notice on Monday, May 18,\n\n2009 and re~posted and re-taped a new notice to the front door on Monday, May 18, 2009 for a\n\nboard meeting on May 19, 2009. Plaintiff ThaDeda:r confirmed this with Defendant's personnel\n\nand obtained a copy of the notice of this meeting on May 18, 2009. The May 19, 2009 board\n\nmeeting was illegally convened in violation of the notice provisions of the Open Meetings Act,\n\nTex. Gov't Code subchapter C, Tex. Gov't Code §551.041, §551.043, and §551.056.\n\n\n\n\nTerrell v.

On May 26, 2009, two months after the Board Meeting held on March 26, 2009,\n\nDefendant Pampa Independent School District's superintendent Mr. Barry Haenisch by certified\n\nletter submitted to plaintiff Terrell another \"version\" of the \"original notice.\" This '•second\"\n\nversion of the \"original notice\" mailed to Temll is signed by Ms. Karen Linder and falsely dated\n\nMarch 20,2009. See Exhibit 3. It is undisputed that defendant's central office building (and the\n\nentire school district) was closed from March 14, 2009 through March 22, 2009 for \"Spring\n\nBreak.\" This notice dated March 20, 2009 is false, was never posted, nor distributed to public\n\nand was recreated only to obstruct justice and misrepresent compliance with the Act. Such\n\nobstruction ofjustice should not be countenanced by this Court.\n\n       14.   In fact, the original posting of notice for the March 26, 2009 was taped to\n\nDefendant's front office door on March 24, 2009 (after the March 23, 2009 taped notice fell or\n\nwas removed from the door per defendant's personnel.) This notice dated      March 23, 2009 for\nthe March 26, 2009 board meeting was in fact distributed to public and Plaintiffs on March 26,\n\n2009 during the said board meeting. Plaintiffs verified with defendant's personnel that no notice\n\nwas posted or remain posted on the front door on March 23, 2009 and obtained a copy of the\n\nnotice of the March 26, 2009 meeting on March 24,2009. There was no internet website posting\n\ndone by the Defendant for the March 26, 2009 for the prescribed time period under the Act. The\n\nMarch 26, 2009 meeting was illegally convened and this meeting and all actions taken in it are in\n\nviolation of the Open Meetings Act Subchapter C, Tex. Gov't Code §551.041; §551.043, and\n\n§551.056.\n\n       15. Defendant does not maintain or could not locate the signed originals of the notices\n\nand/or minutes of the board meetings from November 2008 through April 2009 as inspected\n\npursuant to a Public Information Request by Plaintiff Thanedar. Defendant admitted that the\n\n\nTerrell v.

Defendant's notices of board meetings taped to the front door of the administrative\n\nbuilding are signed by Ms. Karen Linder who is a secretary to Mr. Barry Haenisch,\n\nSuperintendent of Defendant Pampa Independent School District.            These postings are in\n\nviolation of the Act as follows:\n\n        1. The postings of the notices specifically including' notice for the March 26,\n\n            2009 meeting do not contain certificates of compliance by a \"designated or\n\n            authorized\" person that the .Postings are in compliance with the mandatory\n\n            requirements of the Open Meetings Act.\n\n       2. The Open Meetings Act has several notice provisions which must be\n\n           complied with and it is self-evident that a designated or an authorized person\n\n           must provide a certificate that the notice posted is in fact in compliance with\n\n           the Open Meetings Act.       This court should take judicial notice of how\n\n           governmental bodies and school districts properly post notices on their\n\n           internet website where designated personnel post and certify compliance with\n\n           the Open Meetings Act.\n\n       3. Defendant's taped front door notices are signed by Ms. Karen Linder who is\n\n           not designated nor authorized by the Defendant's policies legally approved by\n\n           its Board of Trustees to post public notices of meetings under the Act. It is\n\n           undisputed that as a secretary to the Superintendent of Defendant, Ms. Karen\n\n           Linder has neither the authority under law, district by-laws or approved\n\n           policies, nor any apparent or implied authority to post statutory notices on\n\n\nTerrell v.

Indeed, Ms. Karen Linder\n\n            does not even claim to have any authority to post legal notices, nor certify\n            compliance under the Act, nor sign the notices on behalf of the Board of\n\n            Trustees.   In fact, Ms. Linder makes no certifications whatsoever in the\n\n            notices she signed including the notice posted for the March 26, 2009 board\n\n            meeting.\n\n        4, No notices of board meetings are signed by the President of the Board of Trustees or\n\nthe Superintendent of Defendant Pampa Independent School District. This is in violation of the\n\nAct as the \"school district\" must post a notice of a meeting in compliance with the Act Tex.\n\nGov't Code subchapter C, Tex. Gov't Code §551.041, §551.043, and §55 1.056.\n\n        17. Defendant is in violation of the additional posting requirements of the Open\n\nMeetings Act Tex. Oov't Code §551.056 which requires that governmental bodies such as\n\ndefendant must post notices of meetings on their internet websites concUl'l'eD.tly for the\n\nprescribed minimum 72 hours before meetings. This requirement is in addition to other postings\n\nrequired by the Act. The Open Meetings Act defines \"notice\" as follows: \"A governmental\n\nbody shall give written notice of the date, hour, place, and subject of each meeting held by the\n\ngovernmental bOdy.\" Defendant is in violation of Tex. Gov't Code §551.041.              Further.\n\nDefendant is in violation of the time; requirement of the Open Meetings Act Tex. Oov't Code\n\n§551.043(b).\n\n       18. Posting notice is mandatory and actions taken at a meeting for which notice was\n\nposted incorrectly will be voidable.    Sierra Club v. Austin Transp. Study Policy Advisory\n\nComm 'n, 746 S.

Plaintiffs incorporate within this claim all of the allegations set forth in paragraphs 1·\n\n18,Supra.\n\n        20. Defendant is a government body which is subject to the provisions of the Texas\n\nOpen Meetings Act. Since the Board of Trustees for the Defendant Pampa Independent School\n\ndistrict is a body corpomte, members cannot perfonn any valid act except as a body at meetings\n\nproperly convened and conducted. See Toyah lSD v. Pecos-Barstow lSD. 466 S.W. 2d 377 (Tex.\n\nCiv. App.-San Antonio 1971), no writ; see also Buchele v. Woods, 528 S.W.2d 95 (Tex. Civ.\n\nApp.-Tyler, 1975, no writ).\n\n       21. Pursuant to Tex. Gov't Code §551.141 an action taken by a government body in\n\nviolation of the Texas Open Meetings Act is voidable. Governmental actions taken in violation\n\nof the notice requirements of the Act are voidable. Swate v. Medina Cmty. Hospital, 966 S.W.2d\n\n693, 699 (Tex. App.-San Antonio 1998, pet denied); Tex. Gov't Code §551.141. Governmental\n\nactions in violation of the Open Meetings Act have been judicially declared to ~ void. See e.g.\n\nPoint /sabelLS.D. v. Hinojosa. 191 S.W.2d 176, 179 (Tex. App. -Corpus Christi 1990, writ\n\ndenied).     By Defendant's violation of the notice provisions of the Open Meetings Act as\n\nexplained above, the respective illegally convened Board Meetings (see paragraph 11 above and\n\nExhibit I) and all actions taken therein are both illegal and therefore void. Plaintiffs request that\n\nall meetings, and thus actions in question, as noted above in paragraph 11 including the meeting\n\nheld on 3126/09 be declared void.\n\n       22. In this case, the Pampa Independent School District woefully failed to comply with\n\nthe statutory notice provisions of the Open Meetings Act as shown above and shown conscious\n\nguilt in its transparent attempts to misrepresent compliance and grossly obstruct justice.\n\nTerrell v. Pampa lSD                                                               Page9of16\n\n\n                                                                                                            9\n\f                         •                                         •\nDefendant has repeatedly demonstrated flagrant disregard for the public's right to know what\n\ntheir government is doing and for public's right to expect honest, voluntary, and full compliance\n\nwith law. Citizens do not have to file lawsuits to expect and enforce honest compliance with the\n\nlaw from their government.\n\n       23. It is plaintiffs' position that the board meeting of March 26, 2009 was not properly\n\nconvened and was in violation of the notice provisions of the Open Meetings Act as explained\n\nabove , and therefore, illegal. Plaintiffs request that the said meeting and all actions taken in the\n\nmeeting specifically the action terminating Rebecca Terrell's probationary contract be declared\n\nvoid by this Court. This court should not countenance the improper conduct and flagrant\n\ndisregard for law shown by the defendant (e.g. having three different fals versions of the notice\n\nof the board meeting held on March 26, 2009) and this court should consider such improper\n\nconduct in declaring the above referenced actions and meeting void and in further granting\n\nit\\junctive and mandamus relief to plaintiffs, specifically including reinstatement of Rebecca\n\nTerrell's employment contract and duties, responsibilities, and privileges appurtenant therein and\n\ngranting special damages.\n\n       24. It is plaintiffs' position that the board meetings outlined in paragraph ll above were\n\nnot properly convened and were in violation of the Open Meetings Act's notice provisions.\n\nPlaintiffs request that the said meetings and all actions taken in the said meetings be declared\n\nvoid by this CoW't.

Plaintiffs incorporate within this claim all of the allegations set forth in paragraphs 1-\n\n27, supra.\n\n       29. Plaintiffs are seeking temporary injunctive relief from the actions of Defendant.\n\n       30.

Plaintiffs request the Court to temporarily restrain Defendant Pampa Independent\n\nSchool District without notice and, after notice is given to Defendant and after hearing is held, to\n\ntemporarily enjoin Defendant Pampa Independent School District from proceeding with the\n\ntennination of Rebecca Terrell's employment contract and from terminating her duties, rights,\n\nand privileges as a classroom teacher.\n\n        32. The granting of the tempoi'aty injunctive relief requested by Plaintiffs will allow\nPlaintiffs to preserve the issues at hand until a final determination by the Court regarding the\n\nalleged violations of the Texas Open Meetinas Act can be made.\n\n       33. Additionally, the granting of the temporary injunctive relief requested by Plaintiffs\n\nwill only require Defendant Pampa Independent School District to comply with and abide by the\n\nOpen   Meetings Act and the employment contract with Rebecca Terrell until a final\n\ndetennination is made by the Court. The Defendant governmental entity Pampa Independent\n\nSchool District incy.rs no additional cost and bears no additional dutv but to comply with law or\n\nthe existing contractual obligations. Plaintiffs have made sufficient showing of violations and a\n\npattern of obstruction of justice and willful non compliance with the Open Meetings Act on the\n\npart of Defendant. Therefore, Plaintiffs pmy that the Court, in its discretion, should not require\n\ncash bond in this matter on the part of plaintiffs, or alternatively, if the court requires a bond,\n\nrequire the bond of a nominal amount.\n\n       34. Furthennore, the granting of temporary injunctive relief will prevent Defendant from\n\ntaking action that will cause further immediate and irreparable harm to Plaintiffs and all other\n\ncitizens and taxpayers of the Pampa Independent School District. Defendant's modifying,\n\naltering or changing in any way the paper or electronic record and documents, whether posted on\n\nthe Defendant's website or not, will make it impossible for the Plaintiffs to present their case to\n\n\nTerreJJ v.

Given the Defeudant's conduct so far, a temporary restraining order without notice is\n\nproper.\n\n          35. Plaintiffs have exercised and will exercise due diligence in prosecuting their claims.\n\nThe injury to Plaintiffs and all other citizens and taxpayers of the Pampa Independent School\n\nDistrict, if defendant is not temporarily enjoined from the conduct described above. would\n\noutweigh any injury that the temporary restraining order and the temporary injwtctions might\n\ncause Defendant.\n\n          36. The issuance of temporary restraining order and temporary injunctions would not be\n\nagainst the public's interests but are sought only to preserve the best interests of the public and\n\nsought in the interest of justice.\n\n          37.

As a direct and proximate result of the occurrences made the basis of this lawsuit,\n\nPlaintiffs, Terrell and Thanedat were caused to suffer as interested persons and concerned\n\ncitizens and taxpayer of the defendant Pampa Independent School District, and have incurred a\n\nloss of respect of the integrity of the administrators and elected representatives of the Pampa\n\nIndependent School District.\n\n          39. The Texas Supreme Court has demanded literal compliance with the Open Meetings\n\nAct in general and specifically with respect to its notice provisions.\n\n          40. The Attorney General of the State of Texas, Greg Abbott, has stated unequivocally\n\nthat \"The Texas Open Meetings Act commits public officials at all levels of government to the\n\nprinciple of government in the sunshine.

Special damages are appropriate in this case, given the obstruction of justice and\n\ngross and willful non compliance with the Open Meetings Act e.g. taping notices to the front\n\ndoor, lack of a bulletin board, lack of a properly designated person posting the notices of\n\nmeetings on behalf of the Board of Trustees of Defendant, new re-creation of false versions of\n\noriginal documents, and untimely and after-the--fact postings of notices of meetings by Defendant\n\nincluding on its internet website, weeks and months after the meetings were held.\n\n                                               PRAYER\n\n          42.

Plaintiffs pray that the court require defendant to abide by all laws, rules, regulations,\n\nand policies that are required of the defendant and its board members, officers, agents, servants,\n\nand employees.\n\n        45. Plaintiffs request that the court set a date and time for a hearing on plaintiffs' claim\n\nto declare the meetings outlined in No. 11 above of this petition and actions taken therein void,\n\nPlaintiffs' claim for a mandamus, Plaintiffs' claim for damages and special damages, Plaintiffs'\n\napplication for temporary and permanent injunctions and issue notice of this hearing to\n\ndefendant.\n\n        46. After holding a hearing, the court should declare the meetings outlined in No. 11\n\nabove (specifically including the meeting held on March 26, 2009) void and declare the actions\n\ntaken in the said meetings (including the termination of Rebecca Terrell's employment contract\n\non March 26, 2009) void and issue a writ of mandamus ordering the reinstatement of Rebecca\n\nTerrell's employment contract which would have renewed automatically by operation of law\n\n(Texas Education Code Sec. 21.103 (a) and (b)). Further, the Court should issue permanent\n\ninjunctions against Defendant to prevent future violations of law, specifically the Open Meetings\n\nAct.\n\n       47. Considering the systematic willful violations of the Open Meeting Law and the scant\n\nand perfunctory deliberation on Terrell's employment contract in the open meeting on March 26,\n\n2009 (Terrell had requested that all deliberations be conducted in the open meeting under the\n\nauthority of Tex.

Plaintiffs' original petition in this case was filed on May 29, 2009 which is adopted\n\nand incorporated by reference as if set forth verbatim herein.\n\n       2. Plaintiffs have a right to supplement their pleadings per TRCP 80. See Texas Assoc. of\n\nBusiness v. Texas Air Control Board, 852 S.W.2d 440,446 (Tex.1993). Plaintiffs have filed their\n\nfirst supplemental petition on June 11, 2012. This case is on remand from   th Court of Appeals.\n       3. Plaintiffs rely on the following exhibits which are adopted and incorporated as if set\n\nforth verbatim herein.\n\n       Exhibit 1: Second Supplemental Affidavit of Rebecca Terrell and Chandrashekhar\n                  Thanedar (Attached).\n\n       Exhibit 2: Plaintiff Terrell's employment contract for 2008-2009 with defendant Pampa\n                  Independent School District (PISD or Pampa lSD) (Attached).\n\n\n\n\n                                                189\n\f190\n\n\n\n\n        Exhibit 3: Annual Financial Report of Pampa ISD for 2008-2009 is adopted and\n                   incorporated as if set forth verbatim herein - Pages 18, 20, 80 of the report\n                   providing sources of defendant's funding and expenditures are Attached.\n\n        Exhibit 4: Texas Fact Book 2008 (the Fact Book) by State of Texas Legislative Budget\n                   Bo~rd is adopted and incorporated by reference as if set forth verbatim\n                   herein- Pages 33, 42, 46, 49, 53 from the Fact Book concerning the\n                   Sources of Revenue and Spending on public education in Texas for\n                   2008-2009 are Attached.\n\n        Exhibit 5: Defendant's salary schedules and information for years 2008-2009,\n                   2009-2010, 2010-2011, 2012-2013; and health insurance premium\n                   information for Year 2011-2012 (Attached).\n        4. Plaintiffs Rebecca Terrell and Chandrashekhar Thanedar (spouse) are currently Texas\n\nresidents, citizens, and taxpayers and have been so continuously for more than 12 years. Plaintiff\n\nTerrell was a first year beginning teacher teaching three subjects at the Pampa High School,\n\nPampa, Texas in 2008-2009 teaching U. S. History, World History, and World Geography. See\n\nExhibits 1, 2.\n\n        5. PISD receives a substantial amount of state taxpayer funding, more than $13.2 million\n\nin 2008-2009, from the State of Texas. See Exhibit 3 - PISD's Annual Financial Report for\n\n2008-2009 (page 18) posted on Texas Education Agency's public internet website which is\n\nadopted and incorporated by reference herein. Further PISD receives substantial funding - $3 .48\n\nmillion from the federal government each year. Exhibit 3- PISD's Annual Financial Report for\n\n2008-2009 (pages 18, 80). The State of Texas (e.g. taxpayers such as plaintiffs) provides more\n\nthan 50% ofPISD's General Fund operating expenditures. See Exhibit 3 (page20).\n\n        The State of Texas collects sales and other taxes from Texas citizens and spends a\n\nmajority of it on public school districts such as Pampa ISD and more than a thousand other\n\nschool districts in the State of Texas. Thus the sales taxes and other taxes paid by plaintiffs help\n\nsupport defendant Pampa ISD. See Exhibit 4 - The Texas Fact Book 2008 is published and\n\nmade publicly available on its website by the Texas Legislative Board which is a permanent joint\n\nPlaintiffs' Second Supplemental Petition   Cause No. 35621                        Page 2 of7\n\n                                                     190\n\f191\n\n\n\n\ncommittee of the Texas legislature performing its statutory responsibilities. The citizens and\n\ntaxpayers of Texas, such as plaintiffs, through laws regulate all aspects of operations of public\n\nschool districts. See Texas Education Code e.g. Chapters 11, 21, and 44. Thus as current Texas\n\nand Federal taxpayers and residents of Texas plaintiffs have interest in Pampa lSD and therefore\n\nhave continuous standing from the beginning of this lawsuit to present.\n\n        6. As taxpayers and residents of the State of Texas for more than 12 years, we are\n\nconcerned about the operations of Pampa Independent School District (PISD), its funding and\n\nuse of State of Texas taxpayers' money, and about PISD's violations of the Texas Open\n\nMeetings Act, (TOMA), Gov't Code Ch. 551. We are interested in and concerned about the\n\nopenness, integrity, full disclosures, and full and honest compliance with Texas Constitution and\n\nwith TOMA and other laws by all Texas Government entities and their administrators and\n\nemployees, and in particular by PISD, its Board of Trustees, its superintendent, and its\n\nemployees and administrators. Plaintiff Terrell is interested in and intends to resume teaching at\n\nPISD upon reinstatement, upon order of the court. Plaintiff Thanedar as spouse is interested in\n\nTerrell's reinstatement and resumption of teaching career at PISD. Exhibit 1.\n\n        7. Plaintiff Terrell's salary as a teacher for the school year 2008-2009 was $34,500 and\n\nPISD further provided plaintiff Terrell benefits including health insurance, life insurance,\n\nholidays, sick and vacation time, and employer contributions to retirement benefits. Exhibit 2.\n\nPISD's benefits amount to about 33% of Plaintiff Terrell's salary. Based on PISD's salary\n\nschedules plaintiff Terrell's salary would have been at least $37,900 for 2009-2010, $40,100 for\n\n2010-2011, $41,300 for 2011-2012, and $41,400 for 2012-2013. Exhibit 5.\n\n        8. As a direct and proximate result of defendant's action terminating plaintiff Terrell's\n\nteaching contract done in violation of TOMA, Plaintiff Terrell has suffered loss of full time\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs' Second Supplemental Petition   Cause No. 35621                      Page 3 of7\n\n                                                    191\n\f192\n\n\n\n\nregular teaching position and employment, and has further suffered damages due to lost back\n\nwages and benefits for the years 2009-2010, 2010-2011, 2011-2012, 2012-2013 and continuing,\n\ncurrently estimated at more than $209,000 and continuing.\n\n        9. Plaintiffs have spent more than 1,650 hours on prosecuting this case against PISD\n\nsince the middle of May 2009 up to the filing date of this supplemental petition (Exhibit 1)\n\nwhich is relevant in calculating part of special damages in this case - hours spent multiplied by\n\nhourly rate. It is plaintiffs' position that special damages are warranted here due to defendant\n\nPISD's misconduct, obstruction, and the nature and extent of persistent violations for 2008-2009.\n\n        10. It is plaintiffs' position that PISD did not have BoardBook service for the purpose of\n\npublic viewing of PISD's website internet notices required under TOMA §551.056(b) for the\n\nperiod in question from August 13, 2008 to May 19, 2009. Further it is plaintiffs' position that\n\nPISD did not have BoardBook service for the purpose of public viewing of PISD's website\n\ninternet notices required under TOMA §551.056(b) for the period from January 15, 2009 to May\n\n19, 2009 -a period for which PISD claims good faith exception under TOMA §551.056(d).\n\nDefendant PISD has steadfastly refused to produce evidence that the alleged contract with\n\nBoardBook was in fact executed and that the alleged contract and service with BoardBook was\n\nactually in effect for the period of January 15, 2009 to May 19, 2009 or for any other relevant\n\ntime period. Defendant PISD has defiantly refused and failed to supplement and or amend\n\ndiscovery in this regard as required under Tex. R. Civ. Pro. 193.5.\n\n        Defendant did not pay the first year license fee for BoardBook service for 2007-2008 or\n\nfor any subsequent years e.g. 2008-2009, as a result did not have BoardBook service for the\n\npurpose of public viewing ofPISD's website internet notices of Board meetings from 8113/2008\n\nto 5/19/2009.      Defendant has refused and failed to produce any evidence of payment (e.g.\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs' Second Supplemental Petition   Cause No. 35621                      Page 4 of7\n\n                                                     192\n\f193\n\n\n\n\ncancelled checks, approved check requests, vouchers, check registers, or general ledger extract,\n\nevidencing payment, statement of account with BoardBook, correspondence with BoardBook\n\nregarding payment of license fees and renewal of contract, etc.) for BoardBook service either for\n\nthe purported 2007 BoardBook service agreement or for subsequent years - 2008-2009 and\n\n2009-2010. PISD's good faith defense under TOMA is a fraud on this Court, the        ih Court of\nAppeals that heard this case, Texas Supreme Court, State of Texas, and its citizens and Texas\n\nand Federal taxpayers.\n\n        BoardBook service is a software marketed by Texas Association of School Boards, Inc.\n\n(a trade organization) to its members such as PISD in assisting PISD to display its website\n\ninternet notices of Board meetings for public viewing on BoardBook's website in Adobe\n\nSystems Inc.'s (Adobe) Portable Document Format or \"PDF.\" Adobe's PDF format shows\n\ndocument properties of PISD's website notices such as when the board meeting notices were\n\ncreated i.e. brought into existence in PDF format for public viewing or modified i.e. changed,\n\nthereafter. Document properties of defendant's website notices on BoardBook for 8113/2008 to\n\n5/19/2009 show to have been untimely created in May 2009 after PISD was informed of the\n\nfailure to comply with TOMA §551.056(b) by plaintiffs. Said notices did not \"appear\" on PISD\n\nwebsite (or BoardBook's website) timely for prescribed time (instead \"appearing\" days, weeks\n\nor months after the meetings in question were held) after 5/19/2009. PISD failed to provide\n\nevidence of timely creation, posting, and appearance of its website internet notices for public\n\nviewing for the period in question- 8/13/2008 to 5/19/2009.\n\n        PISD's good faith defense of\"severance of link to BoardBook\" for the period 1/15/2009\n\nto 5/19/2009 is a subterfuge made in bad faith and is a fraud on the public and the court. PISD\n\nand its counsel obstructed and delayed proceedings by filing a frivolous motion to dismiss\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs' Second Supplemental Petition   Cause No. 35621                      Page 5 of7\n\n                                                    193\n\f194\n\n\n\n\nwithout any support in fact or law. Similarly, PISD's motion to quash depositions is also wholly\n\nmeritless designed mainly to delay and obstruct proceedings. PISD deliberately misled the      th\ncourt of appeals concerning its good faith defense and then opposed discovery concerning its\n\ngood faith defense. PISD and its counsel's deliberate obstructive conduct especially against pro\n\nse citizen taxpayers warrants strong sanctions against PISD and its counsel as punishment and to\n\ndeter such misconduct in the future in TOMA lawsuits. Sanctions on PISD and its counsel are\n\nwarranted here to preserve the sanctity of TOMA and its purpose - openness, voluntary\n\ncompliance to laws, and integrity in government.\n\n                                           Supplemental Prayer\n\n        FOR THESE REASONS, plaintiffs respectfully request that plaintiffs' prayer in their\n\noriginal petition and first supplement should be granted in its entirety and further plaintiffs\n\nrequest as supplemental prayer that PISD's action terminating Terrell's employment contract be\n\nvoided, PISD be ordered to reinstate Terrell, and with reinstatement of Terrell as teacher, PISD\n\nbe ordered to pay plaintiff Rebecca Terrell damages in the form of back wages and benefits for\n\nthe school years 2009-2010, 2010-2011, 2011-2012, 2012-2013 and continuing up to and until\n\nthe time PISD fully reinstates Terrell as classroom teacher (currently, back pay and benefits\n\ncalculated at about $209,000 and continuing), and that this Court should grant special damages\n\ncalculated by the number of hours spent by plaintiffs on this case multiplied by a reasonable rate\n\nper hour to be fixed by the Court, and that plaintiffs be declared as the substantially prevailing\n\nparty and be granted costs, expenses, and attorney fees, damages, back pay and benefits for\n\nTerrell with reinstatement as teacher, special damages, and fees, and that the Court enter\n\ndeclaratory judgment that PISD's actions in question violated TOMA and void all such actions in\n\nviolation ofTOMA and enter a permanent injunction against PISD to prevent future violations of\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs' Second Supplemental Petition   Cause No. 35621                      Page 6 of7\n\n                                                    194\n\f•\n195\n\n\n\n\nTOMA.

In the 2006-07 school year,\n      Hispanic students comprised 46 percent of enrollment compared to 36\n      percent for Anglos. The number of Anglo students enrolled in public schools\n      began declining in the 1998-99 school year and has declined each year\n      since. African American students represented 14 percent of all students,\n      with Asian students and other ethnic groups rounding out the remaining 4\n      percent.\n\n      In the 2008-09 biennium,

Plaintiffs Rebecca Terrell and Chandrashekhar Thanedar (spouse) are currently Texas\n\nresidents, citizens, and taxpayers and have been so continuously for more than 12 years. Plaintiff\n\nTerrell was a first year beginning teacher teaching three subjects at the Pampa High School,\n\nPampa, Texas in 2008-2009 teaching U. S. History, World History, and World Geography.\n\nPISD gets a large amount of state taxpayer funding, more than $12.5 million in 2008-2009, from\n\nthe State of Texas. As citizens, taxpayers, and residents of the State of Texas for more than 12\n\nyears, we are concerned about the operations of Pampa Independent School District (PISD), its\n\nfunding and use of State of Texas taxpayers' money, and about PISD's violations of the Texas\n\nOpen Meetings Act, (TOMA), Gov't Code Ch. 551. We are interested in and concerned about\n\nthe openness, integrity, full disclosures, and full and honest compliance with Texas Constitution\n\nand with TOMA and other laws by all Texas Government entities and their administrators and\n\nemployees, and in particular by PISD, its Board of Trustees, its superintendent, and its\n\nemployees and administrators. Plaintiff Terrell is interested in and intends to resume teaching at\n\nPISD upon reinstatement, upon order of the court. Plaintiff Thanedar as spouse is interested in\n\nTerrell's reinstatement and resumption of teaching career at PISD.\n\n         6. Plaintiff Terrell's salary as a teacher for the school year 2008-2009 was $34,500 and\n\nPISD further provided plaintiff Terrell benefits including health insurance, life insurance,\n\nholidays, sick and vacation time, and employer contributions to retirement benefits. PISD's\n\nbenefits amount to about 33% of Plaintiff Terrell's salary. See Exhibits 1-2.\n\n         7. As a direct and proximate result of defendant's action terminating plaintiff Terrell's\n\nteaching contract done in violation of TOMA, plaintiff Terrell has suffered damages due to lost\n\nPlaintiffs' First Supplemental Petition   Cause No. 35621                        Page 2 of5\n                                                    166\n\f167\n\n\n\n\nback wages and benefits for the years 2009-2010, 2010-2011, and 2011-2012 and continuing,\n\ncurrently estimated at more than $155,000 and continuing.\n\n         8. Plaintiffs have spent more than 1,500 hours on prosecuting this case against PISD\n\nsince the middle of May 2009 up to the filing date of this supplemental petition (Exhibit 1)\n\nwhich is relevant in calculating part of special damages in this case - hours spent multiplied by\n\nhourly rate. It is plaintiffs' position that special damages are warranted here due to defendant\n\nPISD's conduct and the nature and extent of persistent violations for 2008-2009.\n\n         9. It is plaintiffs' position that PISD did not have BoardBook service for the purpose of\n\npublic viewing of PISD's website internet notices required under TOMA §551.056(b) for the\n\nperiod in question from August 13, 2008 to May 19, 2009. Exhibit 3.        Further it is plaintiffs'\n\nposition that PISD did not have BoardBook service for the purpose of public viewing ofPISD's\n\nwebsite internet notices required under TOMA §551.056(b) for the period from January 15,2009\n\nto May 19, 2009 - a period for which PISD claims good faith exception under TOMA\n\n§551.056(d). Exhibit 3. Upon opinion and order of the Attorney General of Texas, defendant\n\nproduced a purported BoardBook service agreement dated October 12, 2007 (without evidence\n\nthat it was executed). Exhibit 3. Defendant produced no executed BoardBook agreements and\n\nno evidence whatsoever ofBoardBook service for subsequent years- 2008-2009 and 2009-2010.\n\n         DeJendant did not pay the first year license fee for BoardBook service for 2007-2008 or\n\nfor any subsequent years e.g. 2008-2009 as a result did not have BoardBook service for the\n\npurpose of public viewing of PISD's website internet notices of Board meetings from 8/13/2008\n\nto 5/19/2009.       Defendant has refused and failed to produce any evidence of payment for\n\nBoardBook service either for the purported 2007 BoardBook service agreement or for\n\nsubsequent years- 2008-2009 and 2009-2010.\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs' First Supplemental Petition   Cause No. 35621                        Page 3 of5\n                                                    167\n\f168\n\n\n\n\n         BoardBook service is a software marketed by Texas Association of School Boards, Inc.\n\n(a trade organization) to its members such as PISD in assisting PISD to display its website\n\ninternet notices of Board meetings for public viewing on BoardBook's website in Adobe\n\nSystems Inc.'s (Adobe) Portable Document Format or \"PDF.\" Adobe's PDF format shows\n\ndocument properties of PISD's website notices such as when the board meeting notices were\n\ncreated i.e. brought into existence in PDF format for public viewing or modified i.e. changed,\n\nthereafter. Document properties of defendant's website notices on BoardBook for 8/13/2008 to\n\n5/19/2009 show to have been untimely created in May 2009 after PISD was informed of the\n\nfailure to comply with TOMA §551.056(b) by plaintiffs. Said notices did not \"appear\" on PISD\n\nwebsite (or BoardBook's website) timely for prescribed time (instead \"appearing\" days, weeks\n\nor months after the meetings in question were held) after 5/19/2009. PISD failed to provide\n\nevidence of timely creation, posting, and appearance of its website internet notices for public\n\nviewing for the period in question- 8/13/2008 to 5/19/2009. PISD's good faith defense of\n\n\"severance of link to BoardBook\" for the period 1/2009 to 5/19/2009 is a subterfuge and made in\n\nbad faith.\n\n                                          Supplemental Prayer\n\n         FOR THESE REASONS, plaintiffs respectfully request that plaintiffs' prayer in their\n\noriginal petition should be granted in its entirety and further plaintiffs request as supplemental\n\nprayer that PISD's action terminating Terrell's employment contract be voided, PISD be ordered\n\nto reinstate Terrell, and with reinstatement of Terrell as teacher, PISD be ordered to pay plaintiff\n\nRebecca Terrell damages in the form ofback wages and benefits for the school years 2009-2010,\n\n2010-2011, 2011-2012, and continuing up to and until the time PISD fully reinstates Terrell as\n\nclassroom teacher (currently, back pay and benefits calculated at about $155,000 and\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs' First Supplemental Petition   Cause No. 35621                         Page 4 of5\n                                                    168\n\f169\n                                                                                 J\ncontinuing), and that this Court should grant special damages calculated by the number of hours\n\nspent by plaintiffs on this case multiplied by a reasonable rate per hour to be fixed by the Court,\n\nand that plaintiffs be declared as the substantially prevailing party and be granted costs,\n\nexpenses, and attorney fees, damages, back pay and benefits for Terrell with reinstatement as\n\nteacher, special damages, and fees, and that the Court enter a permanent injunction against PISD\n\nto prevent future violations of TOMA. Plaintiffs further request that the Court grant all other and\n\nfurther relief, at law or in equity, to which they may justly be entitled to receive.\n\n                                                               Respectfully submitted,\n\n\n\n\n                                                               Rebecca Terrell\n\n\n                                                               Cl3~~~\n                                                               Chandrashekhar Thanedar\n                                                               Plaintiffs\n                                                               7618 Citadel Peak\n                                                               Converse, Texas 78109\n                                                               (956) 445-3107\n\n                                          CERTIFICATE OF SERVICE\n\n         The undersigned certify that a true and correct copy of the foregoing document has been\n\nserved upon the following by facsimile and USPS certified mail on the 11th day of June, 2012 as\n\nfollows: W.

Subject to this objection Defendant\n would state that Karen Linder would periodically check that status of the postings after\n first posting the Notices on the BoardBook which ~ould in tum send through an internet\n link the Notices to the District Website. Sometime in January of 2009 the District\n Technology Services Department updated the website but left off the link between the\n Boardbook and District Website. This technical problem was not discovered and\n corrected until approximately May 2009. Karen Linder was responSI\"ble for creating the\n internet board notices through the boardbook program. Once created on the boardbook\n template the Notices were delivered to the District Website via a link. This link worked\n properly from October 2007 until approximately January 2009 when the District Website\n was updated. Unbeknownst to anyone at the District, when the District Website was\n updated the link with Boardbook was terminated.\n\n\n\n\n Defendant's Answers to Plaintiffs' l.ote1TOgatorfs-Page 3\n#484036\n\f INTERROGATORY NO. 5: State all technical problems that you believe caused\n your failure to comply with the legal requirement of posting internet notices of your\n board meetings on your website per TOMA.\n\n ANSWER:           See Answer to Interrogatory No. 4.\n\n INTERROGATORY NO. 6: State all reasons why you believe the technical\n problem(s) identified in Interrogatory No. 5 herein above were beyond your control\n\n ANSWER:           See Answer to Interrogatory No. 4.\n\nINTERROGATORY NO. 7: State when and how you became aware of the technical\nproblem(s) identified in Interrogatory No. S herein above.\n\nANSWER: Defendant became aware when it was reported to Defendant by Plaintiffs\nherein that the notices were not online.\n\nINTERROGATORY NO. 8:               Identify the names of the persons who were aware of\nthe technical problem(s) identified in Interrogatory No. 5 herein above and of your efforts\nto resolve them between the time period August 13, 208 [sic] to May 19, 2009.\n\nANSWER: Karen Linder.

This technical issue was not discovered until May of 2009 at\n        which time the link was reestablished. The technical problem was the severance of the\n        link with the updating of the website.

REASON FOR THE SECOND MOTION\n\n                1. On remand of this case from the         ih   Court of Appeals, plaintiffs have filed two\n\n         supplemental petitions - first supplemental petition on June 11, 2012 and the second\n\n         supplemental petition on October 18, 2012. Plaintiffs' amended no-evidence and traditional\n\n         motion for summary judgment was denied by Judge Vanderpool on August 24,2012.\n\n                2. Plaintiffs filed their motion to recuse the 223rd district court Judge Phil Vanderpool on\n\n         September 24, 2012 due to partiality towards defendant PISD and violation of plaintiffs' due\n\n         process rights. On September 26, 2012, the district clerk entered an order of recusal by Judge\n\n         Vanderpool. On October 15, 2012, senior Judge Abe Lopez was assigned to this case.\n\n\n\n\n                                                        217\n\f•\n    218\n\n\n\n\n              3. The only fact question identified by the 7th Court of Appeals in its opinion was PISD's\n\n    claim of \"good faith\" regarding the untimely \"creation dates\" and the \"non-appearance\" of its\n\n    internet notices from Jan. 2009 through 5119/2009 on its website and/or on BoardBook's\n\n    website. Terrell vs. Pampa ISD, 345 S.W.3d 641 (Tex. App.--Amarillo 2011, pet. denied). See\n\n    TOMA §§551.056(b) and (d).\n\n              4. PISD's alleged \"good faith\" defense is a fraud on taxpayers of Texas, appeals\n\n    court, and this Court and a brazen obstruction of justice for the last 3 Y2 years. This defendant\n\n    governmental entity, a taxpayer funded school district no less, is under the mistaken impression\n\n    that it can continue to engage in this fraud against pro se Texas citizen taxpayers in this case.\n\n    Since the beginning of this lawsuit in May 2009, PISD deliberately engaged in obstruction of\n\n    justice by refusing and failing to produce documents in response to plaintiffs' discovery requests\n                                                                    1\n    that will show that PISD did not have BoardBook service for the period from January 15, 2009\n\n    to May 19, 2009 - period of 5 months for which it claims it had BoardBook service and for\n\n    which it claims \"good faith\" exception under §551.056(d) for \"non-appearance\" of its internet\n\n    notices. PISD admits the \"non-appearance\" of notices for said 5 months and blames the \"link\" to\n\n    BoardBook service for not working. CR807, CR814-816. CR766-767. 2 It further admits that the\n\n    untimely notices appeared on BoardBook's website on 5/19/2009 for the previous 5 months.\n\n    CR816. But PISD refuses to produce documents that show that it paid license fees or renewal\n\n    fees to BoardBook for 1/2009 to 5/19/2009 or for the relevant years 2008 and 2009 for\n\n\n\n    1\n     PISD frivolously refuses and resists discovery for the last 3 112 years objecting to such discovery as \"not\n    relevant\" and \"beyond the scope of Texas Rules of Civil Procedure\" while brazenly claiming good faith\n    exception based on the same BoardBook service. This is nothing but mockery of TOMA and the justice\n    system. PISD alleges that a link to BoardBook is necessary for public to view TOMA mandated internet\n    notices which reside on BoardBook's website.\n    2\n        The Clerk's Record is cited as \"CR[page],\" and Supplemental Clerk's Record cited as \"SCR[page].\"\n\n\n    Plaintiffs Second No-evidence and Traditional\n    Motion for Summary Judgment                        Cause No. 35621                    Page 2 of 43\n                                                       218\n\f219\n\n\n\n\nBoardBook service. Exhibits 20, 21. PISD refuses to produce requested documents and its\n\npersonnel for deposition. PISD's motion to quash depositions has been denied.\n\n        PISD has further refused to supplement discovery in violation of Tex. R. Civ. Pro 193.5\n\nconcerning its alleged contract for service with BoardBook for the period 1/2009 to 5/19/2009.\n\nPISD refused and failed to produce documents showing that it ever paid the initial licensing fee\n\nof$1,600 or any subsequent renewal fees for service to BoardBook. Exhibits 14, 20, and 21.\n\n        There is no evidence of an executed contract with BoardBook for the relevant time period\n\nin question- 1/2009 to 5/19/2009. Because there is no evidence of consideration moving from\n\nPISD to BoardBook for the above period and because PISD refuses to provide such evidence, as\n\na matter of law, the allegation of BoardBook service is legally invalid and at best speculation and\n\nnot legal evidence. Kindred v. Con!Chem., Inc., 650 S.W. 2d 61, 63 (Tex. 1983). Advantage\n\nPhysical Therapy, Inc. v. Cruse, 165 S.W. 3d 21, 24 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.], 2005 no\n\npet.) (without consideration, there is no contract). PISD could not and did not have an executed\n\ncontract and service with BoardBook for the period in question for which PISD claims good\n\nfaith. Notably, PISD does not claim good faith defense for 8/13/2008 through 12/2008 and there\n\nis no evidence in the record of consideration from PISD, valid contract or service with\n\nBoardBook for that period.\n\n        PISD further refused and failed to provide documents in response to discovery requests\n\nevidencing it paid license or renewal fees for BoardBook service and has refused to supplement\n\ndiscovery in violation of TRCP 193.5. The draft BoardBook agreemene (signed only by PISD,\n\n\n3\n  The Texas Attorney General's opinion (CR368-371) in favor of plaintiff Thanedar forced PISD to\nproduce this fabricated draft agreement. This draft agreement presumably covers a 12 month period from\n10/12/2007 to 10/12/2008. However this draft, even if presumed valid, would cover at the most only\nabout 2 months in question in this case - part of August 2008 to part of October 2008 and does not cover\nthe period Jan. 2009-May 19, 2009 for which PISD claims good faith defense under TOMA.\n\n\nPlaintiffs Second No-evidence and Traditional\nMotion for Summary Judgment                      Cause No. 35621                   Page 3 of 43\n                                                 219\n\f220\n\n\n\n\nbut not by BoardBook) clearly states that the subscription agreement is not effective until the\n\n$1,600 fee or a purchase order in that amount is received by BoardBook. Exhibit 14 (see \"Fees\"\n\nand \"Terms\"). Because there is absolutely no evidence in the record that PISD ever paid the\n\noriginal $1,600 (or a purchase order for $1 ,600) or subsequent renewal fees to BoardBook for\n\n2008 or 2009, PISD cannot as a matter of law prove that it had BoardBook service for the period\n\nin question from 8/13/2008 through 5/19/2009. Thus, there is not even a scintilla of evidence\n\nthat PISD had BoardBook service in effect from January 2009 through 5119/2009 - a period for\n\nwhich PISD claims good faith defense concerning why internet notices did not \"appear\" on\n\nPISD/BoardBook website.\n\n        PISD willfully engaged in subterfuge and obstruction of justice by fabricating a good\n\nfaith defense of missing \"link\" to BoardBook service in this lawsuit knowing full well that it did\n\nnot even have BoardBook service because it did not pay the license fees to BoardBook for the\n\nperiod in question. For this obstruction of justice and subterfuge PISD and its counsel deserve\n\nsubstantial sanctions as punishment for this misconduct.            In addition, this case concerns\n\npersistent willful pattern of violations of Texas Open Meetings Act, Gov't Code Ch. 551, for 22\n\nMeetings from 8/13/08 through 5/19/09 by defendant PISD.\n\n        5. PISD's misrepresentation concerning its unsupported assertion that \"create dates of\n\nBoardBook notices were in actuality print dates\" requires sanctions. PISD deliberately\n\nmisrepresented to the 7th Court of Appeals that the \"create dates\" of the untimely PDF internet\n\nnotices in BoardBook were in fact the dates on which website notices were \"printed\" for\n\nplaintiffs.   See Appeals Court's Opinion Pgs. 5-6; Exhibit 3.           PISD has failed to provide\n\nsupplementation in question in violation of the appeals court's opinion and TRCP 193.5 and\n\nfurther failed to indicate where in the record such evidence exists, if at all.\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs Second No-evidence and Traditional\nMotion for Summary Judgment                      Cause No. 35621                  Page 4 of 43\n                                                 220\n\f221\n\n\n\n\n          As noted by the appeals court, it does not. Opinion Pgs. 5-6. Thus PISD's argument\n\nbefore the appeals court was a deliberate misrepresentation made to delay this case and obstruct\n\njustice. Such misconduct on the part of PISD and counsel deserves substantial sanctions.\n\n                         II. PISD'S TOMA VIOLATIONS AND FRAUD\n\n          A. Actions Taken In 22 Board Meetings Are At Issue: PISD's violations of notice\n\nprovisions of TOMA concern the actions taken in the 22 meetings of the Board of Trustees of\n\nPISD between August 13, 2008 to May 19, 2009 (\"22 Meetings\"). Specifically, the 22 Meetings\n\nwere held on 8/13/08; 8/21/08; 9/4/08; 9/18/08; 10/2/08; 10/9/08; 10/23/08; 1116/08; 11120/08;\n\n12/4/08; 12/18/08; 1/15/09; 2/5/09; 2/19/09; 3/12/09; 3/26/09; 4/2/09; 4/16/09; 4/21/09; 4/23/09;\n\n517109; and 5/19/09. Exhibit 7, Exhibit 11 (Req. for Admission No. 19).\n\n          Thus, PISD's Board of Trustees (Board) held 11 meetings each in 2008 and 2009 from\n\n8/13/08 to 5/19/09.\n\n          B. Violations of TOMA provisions4 at Issue in this motion:\n\n      •   §551.051: PISD violated §551.051 by failing to post notices of 3/26/09 board meeting\n          and 22 Meetings in a specifically designated place - Bulletin Board in its Central\n          Administrative Office (Central Office) as required by TOMA.\n\n      •   §551.056: PISD violated §551.056 by failing to concurrently post internet notices of\n          3/26/09 board meeting and 22 Meetings on its website for prescribed time and manner.\n\n      •   §551.043: PISD violated §551.043 by failing to post notices of 3/26/09 board meeting\n          and 22 Meetings at a physical location for prescribed time (72 hours) and manner.\n\n      •   §551.041: PISD violated §551.041 by failing to specify \"place\" (Pampa, Texas) in its\n          notices (internet and paper notices) of 3/26/09 board meeting and 22 Meetings.\n\n      •   §551.101 and §551.074(b): PISD violated §551.101 by failing to legally close the\n          3/26/09 Board meeting and violated §551.074(b) by deliberating on Terrell's termination\n          in closed meeting.\n\n\n\n4\n References to the Texas Government Code Chapter 551 (TOMA) will be by reference to\"§ _ _\" or\n\"Sections_ _,\" or \"TOMA §_ _.\"\n\nPlaintiffs Second No-evidence and Traditional\nMotion for Summary Judgment                     Cause No. 35621               Page   5 of 43\n                                                221\n\f222\n\n\n\n\n      •   §551.045(d): PISD violated §551.045(d) because PISD's notices (website and physical\n          location) of 3/26/09 board meeting and 22 Meetings were signed on behalf of the Board\n          and posted by a person (Karen Linder) not so designated nor authorized by PISD's Board\n          of Trustees (Board).\n\n          C. TOMA Violations Are Distinct: The statutory language of TOMA is clear that the\n\nabove notice provisions are distinct, and failure to comply with any one of the notice provisions\n\nrenders the action(s) in violation ofTOMA and thus voidable. §551.141.\n\n                                        III. LEGAL STANDARD\n\nA. Post-Remand Proceedings\n\n          Reason for Remand: On appeal by plaintiffs, the 7th court of appeals acknowledged that\n\nPISD indeed was untimely in posting internet notices in violation of TOMA §551.056(b).\n\nHowever, appeals court reversed and remanded the case on the grounds that there is no evidence\n\nin the record concerning PISD's alleged argument that \"create\" dates of its electronic PDF\n\nnotices posted on PISD/BoardBook's website were in fact dates on which PISD printed the\n\nwebsite notices for plaintiffs for delivery to them. See appeals court's Opinion Pages 5-6, Terrell\n\nvs. Pampa ISD, ih District Court of Appeals, 07-10-00212-CV, 345 SW3d 641, 04-29-11.\n\nAppeals court has further ordered that post-remand proceedings be consistent with its opinion\n\nand reason for remand. See 7th court of appeals mandate dated 1/6/12.\n\n          It is well established that trial court lacks the power to deviate from the instructions in the\n\nmandate issued by the court of appeals. \"The [lower tribunal] on remand is ... required to proceed\n\nin accordance with the rules and reasoning stated in the appellate court's opinion, as both the\n\nletter and the spirit of the mandate is to be implemented.\" 5 Am. Jur. 2d, Appellate Review\n\n(1995), §785 at 454. Therefore, [a lower tribunal] is not free to ignore the mandate and opinion\n\nof the remanding appellate court, but instead must proceed in conformity with the v1ews\n\nexpressed by the appellate court. 5 Am. Jur. 2d, Appellate Review (1995), §786 at 455.\n\nPlaintiff's Second No-evidence and Traditional\nMotion for Summary Judgment                        Cause No. 35621                   Page 6   of43\n                                                    222\n\f223\n\n\n\n\n        As the appeals court has given specific reason for remand and instructions, the mandate\n\ncontrols the framework of post-remand proceedings.          The trial court is required to comply\n\nexactly with the mandate in effecting the remand. Hudson v. Wakefield, 711 S.W.2d 628, 630-\n\n631 (1986); ATSPAC v. Sierra Club, 843 S.W.2d 683, 690 (1992); Dallas County v. Sweitzer,\n\n971 S.W. 2d 629 (Texas. App.--Dallas 1998). Therefore in this case, trial court's jurisdiction\n\nextends to conducting proceedings and further discovery regarding the reason for remand and\n\napplying law to the record facts concerning all of the violations of TOMA alleged by plaintiffs in\n\nthis case.\n\nB. Summary Judgment Standard\n\n        Plaintiffs move for no-evidence and traditional summary judgment under Rule 166a of\n\nthe Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. A party moving for summary judgment must show that no\n\ngenuine issue of material fact exists and that the party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n\nTex. R. Civ. P. 166a(c); Randall's Food Mkts., Inc. v. Johnson, 891 S.W.2d 640, 644 (Tex.\n\n1995); Nixon v. Mr. Property Management Co., 690 S.W.2d 546, 548 (Tex. 1985). A party\n\nseeking to recover upon a claim may move for a summary judgment in his favor upon all or any\n\npart thereof and a summary judgment may be rendered on the issue of liability alone although\n\nthere is genuine issue as to the amount of damages. Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(a).\n\n        Under the no-evidence summary judgment standard, a court properly grants a no-\n\nevidence summary judgment if the non-movant fails to bring forth more than a scintilla of\n\nprobative evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to an essential element of the non-\n\nmovant's claim. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(i); Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Havner,\n\n953 S. W. 2d 706, 711 (Tex. 1997), cert. denied, 523 U.S. 119 (1998). Less than a scintilla of\n\nevidence exists when the evidence is \"so weak as to do no more than create a mere surmise or\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs Second No-evidence and Traditional\nMotion for Summary Judgment                     Cause No. 35621                 Page   7 of 43\n                                                223\n\f224\n\n\n\n\nsuspicion\" of a fact, and legal effect is that there is no evidence. Kindred v. Con/Chem., Inc.,\n\n650 S.W. 2d 61,63 (Tex. 1983). The party with the burden of proof at trial will have the same\n\nburden of proof in a summary judgment proceeding. Esco Oil & Gas, Inc. v. Sooner Pipe &\n\nSupply Corp., 962 S.W.2d 193, 197 n.3 (Tex. App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1998, writ denied). Thus\n\nplaintiffs without presenting summary judgment evidence may move for summary judgment on\n\nthe ground that there is no evidence of one or more essential elements of a defense on which\n\ndefendant has burden of proof at trial. See Tex. R. Civ. Proc. Rule 166a(i). Weiss v. Mechanical\n\nAssociated Serv., Inc., 989 S.W. 2d 120, 123 (Tex. App.-San Antonio 1999, writ denied).\n\nC. Texas Open Meetings Act, Government Code Ch. 551 (TOMA)\n\n        1. Standing under TOMA: §551.142(a) authorizes any interested person to bring a\n\ncivil action under TOMA. §551.142(a); see Cameron Cnty. Good Gov't League v. Ramon, 619\n\nS.W.2d 224, 230-31 (Tex. App.--Beaumont 1981, writ refd n.r.e.). In keeping with the purpose\n\nof TOMA, standing under TOMA is interpreted broadly. See Burks v. Yarbrough, 157 S.W.3d\n\n876, 880 (Tex. App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 2005, orig. proceeding; Hays Cnty. Water Planning\n\nP 'ship, 41 S. W.3d at 177. Also see City of San Antonio v. Fourth Court ofAppeals, 820 S. W.2d\n\n762,765 (Tex. 1991)(holding that the intended beneficiaries of the Open Meetings Act are\n\n\"members of the interested public\").\n\n        Standing conferred by TOMA is broader than taxpayer standing, and a citizen does not\n\nneed to prove an interest different from the general public, \"because 'the interest protected by the\n\nTexas Open Meetings Act is the interest of the general public.\"' See Hays Cnty. Water Planning\n\nP'ship, 41 S.W.3d at 177-78 (quoting Save Our Springs Alliance, Inc. v. Lowry, 934 S.W.2d\n\n161,163 (Tex. App.--Austin 1996, orig. proceeding). See also City of Fort Worth v. Groves, 746\n\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs Second No-evidence and Traditional\nMotion for Summary Judgment                     Cause No. 35621                 Page   8 of 43\n                                                224\n\f 225\n\n\n\n\nS.W.2d 907 (Tex.App.--Fort Worth 1988, no writ)(resident of Arlington had standing to bring\n\nsuit for declaratory judgment and injunction against City of Fort Worth for violation ofTOMA).\n\n        Plaintiffs have standing as members of the general public in Texas. Exhibits 7, 26. See\n\nBurks, !d.; Hays Cnty Water Planning P'ship, !d. Further plaintiffs have standing because they\n\nare interested persons under TOMA. Exhibit 7. See §551.142(a); Cameron Cnty Good Gov't\n\nLeague, !d. Further plaintiffs Terrell and Thanedar have standing in this case because they are\n\nTexas residents, citizens, and taxpayers that fund defendant PISD and all other public school\n\ndistricts, and who are interested in government entities' honest and voluntary compliance with\n\nTOMA and open government. Exhibits 7, 23, 24, 25 and 26. Further, Terrell and Thanedar are\n\ninterested persons under TOMA because PISD terminated Terrell's teaching contract (Exhibit\n\n22) in PISD's 3/26/2009 Board meeting which was held in violation of TOMA's notice\n\nprovisions as set forth in plaintiffs' original petition and in this motion. Terrell seeks the relief of\n\nreinstatement upon voidance of the unlawful Board action terminating her contract on 3/26/09.\n\nAs such Terrell is interested in resuming her employment with PISD as a Texas certified teacher\n\nupon successful conclusion of this legal action in her favor. §551.142(a). Exhibits 7, 25, 26.\n\n        2. Unlawful Actions Judicially Voided: An action taken by a governmental body in\n\nviolation of TOMA is voidable. Tex. Gov't Code §551.141. Swate v. Medina Cmty. Hospital,\n\n966 S. W.2d 693, 699 (Tex. App.--San Antonio 1998, pet denied). Governmental actions in\n\nviolation of the Texas Open Meetings Act have been judicially declared void. See Ferris v.\n\nTexas Board ofChiropractic Examiners, 808 S.W.2d 514, 518-519 (Tex. App.--Austin 1991,\n\nwrit denied); Also See Point JsabellS.D. v. Hinojosa, 797 S.W.2d 176, 179 (Tex. App.--Corpus\n\nChristi 1990, writ denied). An interested person may bring an action by mandamus or injunction\n\nto stop, prevent, or reverse a violation or threatened violation of TOMA. Texas Gov't Code §\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs Second No-evidence and Traditional\nMotion for Summary Judgment                      Cause No. 35621                   Page 9 of 43\n                                                  225\n\f•\n    226\n\n\n\n\n    551.142. Hays County Water Planning P'ship, 41 S.W.3d at 177-78 (quoting Save Our Springs\n\n    Alliance, Inc., 934 S.W. 2d at 163).\n\n            3. Texas Supreme Court has demanded Exact and Literal Compliance:                  The law\n\n    with respect to the compliance with the notice provisions of TOMA has been well settled for\n\n    more than 20 years. The Texas Supreme Court has demanded Exact and Literal Compliance\n\n    with TOMA. See Acker v. Texas Water Commission, 790 S.W.2d 299 (Tex. 1990). (\"The\n\n    explicit command of the statute is for openness at every stage of the deliberations. Accordingly,\n\n    we have demanded exact and literal compliance with the terms of this statute.\" [citing]\n\n    Smith County v. Thornton, 726 S.W.2d 2, 3 (Tex. 1986); City of San Antonio v. Fourth Court of\n\n    Appeals, 820 S.W.2d 762 (Tex. 1991)). Thus, \"substantial compliance\" under TOMA, whether\n\n    done in good faith or not, is no longer sufficient nor valid law in the State of Texas.\n\n    Nevertheless, the record shows that PISD does not even meet the overruled substantial\n\n    compliance standard concerning any of the TOMA violations alleged in this case.\n\n            Whether defendant's actions comply with TOMA is a matter of law and the controlling\n\n    material facts in this case are admitted or undisputed. This case is ripe for summary judgment in\n\n    plaintiffs' favor due to violations of TOMA detailed below. Plaintiffs are entitled to summary\n\n    judgment on facts and law presented herein.\n\n                                IV.

UNDISPUTED FACTS\n\n    1. Undisputed facts concerning untimeliness of PISD's website internet notices and\n       Good Faith exception under §551.056(b) and (d)\n\n            PISD admits that internet website notices required under TOMA §551.056(b) did not\n\n    \"appear\" in the prescribed time on PISD or BoardBook's website for 11 meetings from 1/2009 to\n\n    5/19/2009. CR814-816, CR767.\n\n            PISD did not pay any consideration to BoardBook for its service for the relevant period\n\n    from 1/2009 to 5/19/2009 for which PISD claims good faith exception, or for any other period\n\n    relevant to this lawsuit.\n\n            There is no evidence that PISD had BoardBook service from 1/2009 to 5/19/2009. There\n\n    is no evidence of an executed contract or payment of license fees or renewal fees to BoardBook\n\n    for 1/2009 to 5/19/2009. PISD has admitted no such documents exist. CR781 (PISD's Response\n\n    to Request for Production 15).\n\n            An alleged draft agreement with BoardBook for 2007 is not signed by BoardBook.\n\n    Exhibit 14. PISD does not claim good faith exception for any period in 2007 or 2008.\n\n            The properties of the website internet notices show untimeliness in violation of TOMA\n\n    from 1/2009 to 5/19/2009 for which PISD claims good faith exception. Opinion Pgs. 5-6.\n\n            There is no evidence that the untimely \"created\" dates of the PDF notices of meetings in\n\n    question were the dates when \"PISD [allegedly] printed the notices for delivery to plaintiffs.\"\n\n    Plaintiff's Second No-evidence and Traditional\n    Motion for Summary Judgment                      Cause No. 35621               Page   13 of 43\n                                                      229\n\f230\n\n\n\n\n2. Undisputed facts concerning notice requirement of posting meeting notices on Bulletin\nBoard - a specifically designated place for school districts under §551.051\n\n        PISD admits and does not dispute that it posted board meeting notices on the front door\n\nof its central administrative building for the time period in question from 8/13/2008 to 5/19/2009\n\n(22 Meetings). Exhibits 7, 17. See Exhibit 11- Req. for Admission nos. 5 and 7.\n\n3. Undisputed facts concerning \"place\" requirement under §551.041\n\n        PISD admits that for both paper and internet notices it did not specify or include the name\n\nof the city in its notices from the period 8/13/2008 to 5/19/2009 (22 Meetings). Exhibit 6,\n\nExhibit 11-Req. for Admission no. 15.            In certain cases, defendant's notices merely state\n\n\"Pampa High School\" or \"Pampa Junior High School\" without stating the address. PISD does\n\nnot dispute this. Exhibit 10- See CR70-71, CR75, CR89-90, CR129-130, CR147-148, CR156,\n\nCR167-168, CR170.\n\n4. Undisputed facts concerning \"72 Hour\" notice requirement under §551.043 concerning\n3/26/2009 and 5/19/2009 board meetings\n\n        Plaintiffs did not see the notice for 3/26/2009 meeting posted on the front door of the\n\ncentral administrative office or in a bulletin board inside the central administrative office at 5\n\np.m. or 6 p.m. on 3/23/2009. Exhibit 7. This is undisputed.\n\n        Plaintiffs saw the notice for 5/18/2009 meeting posted on the front door of the central\n\nadministrative building on Saturday, 5116/2009. Karen Linder confirmed to plaintiff Thanedar\n\nthat there was an error in posting this notice because the meeting date changed to 5/19/2009 and\n\nthat Linder posted a corrected notice for a board meeting on 5/19/09 on the front door of Carver\n\nCenter -central administrative office- on 5/18/2009 because the change in meeting date to\n\n5/19/09. Exhibit 7. No board meeting took place on 5/18/2009.\n\n5. Undisputed facts concerning requirement to identify section(s) authorizing closed\nmeeting under §551.101\n\nPlaintiff's Second No-evidence and Traditional\nMotion for Summary Judgment                       Cause No. 35621              Page   14 of 43\n                                                   230\n\f231\n\n\n\n\n        The presiding officer of the Board did not identify the section or sections under TOMA\n\nthat authorized closing of the 3/26/2009 board meeting to public. See Exhibit 11-Req. for\n\nAdmission no. 14; Exhibits 7, 16.\n\n6. Undisputed facts concerning requirement to deliberate in open session under §551.074(b)\n\n        The audio recording of the closed meeting on 3/26/2009 shows discussion among PISD\n\nSuperintendent Haenisch and the PISD board members on Terrell's termination. Terrell had\n\nspecifically requested the action be deliberated in open meeting per §551.074(b). Exhibits 15,\n\n16 (Tape 2 at Counter 43:45).\n\n7. Undisputed facts concerning \"designated person\" requirement under §551.045(d)\n\n        PISD's Board of Trustees did not designate or authorize Karen Linder to sign meeting\n\nnotices or post board meeting notices on Board of Trustees' behalf. PISD admits this. Exhibit\n\n12-Req. for Production 28. Karen Linder signed and posted board meeting notices on behalf of\n\nthe Board of Trustees ofPISD. See e.g. Exhibit 6.\n\n                                            VI. ARGUMENT\n\n        Plaintiffs repeat the preceding paragraphs in their entirety as if set forth verbatim herein.\n\nA. Declaratory Relief under TOMA\n\n        Plaintiffs are entitled to declaratory relief under TOMA whether or not any other relief is\n\ngranted and whether or not PISD's actions in violation ofTOMA are voided.\n\n1. Plaintiffs are entitled to declaration that PISD violated TOMA §551.056 specifically\nconcerning the 3/26/09 Board meeting and 22 Meetings.\n\n   a. PISD refused and failed to produce evidence that it paid the required $1,600 fee\n   and any renewal fees for service to BoardBook to post internet notices for PISD\n\n        PISD admits that from January 15, 2009 through May 19, 2009 internet website notices\n\ndid not appear on its website (or its agent BoardBook's website) as required by §551.056(b).\n\nPlaintiffs Second No-evidence and Traditional\nMotion for Summary Judgment                     Cause No. 35621                  Page   15 of 43\n                                                 231\n\f232\n\n\n\n\nCR816. PISD alleges that it had BoardBook service 5 to post internet website notices of its Board\n\nmeetings on BoardBook's website since 2007. CR772. Thus by PISD's admission, BoardBook\n\nis an agent of PISD and they were parties in joint enterprise to post PISD's Board meeting\n\nnotices as required in §551.056(b) on BoardBook website via a link on PISD website. See\n\nCR206; CR772. PISD claims good faith defense under TOMA §551.056(d) because it claims\n\nthat the \"Link\" to internet notices on BoardBook's website was not established in error for 5\n\nmonths until plaintiff Thanedar pointed out the problem to PISD on 5/15/2009. CR767. PISD\n\nhas the burden to produce evidence and persuade on its good faith statutory defense under\n\nTOMA. See §551.056(d); §§551.043(b)(l) and (b)(3).\n\n        Inspite of PISD's bare self-serving claim, PISD has steadfastly refused and failed to\n\nproduce absolutely any competent evidence that PISD in fact had BoardBook service for the\n\nperiod in question from 112009 to 5/19/2009 or from 8/13/08 to 5/19/2009 for 22 Meetings and\n\nthat PISD paid consideration ($1600 or any renewal fees) to BoardBook to have a valid\n\nagreement. Exhibit 14 (See \"Terms\" and \"Fees\"). PISD refuses to produce documents or\n\nchecks showing payment of license fees and their dates, renewal notices, purchase orders from\n\nBoardBook, or any document or communication between BoardBook and PISD showing that\n\nBoardBook service was in effect from 1/2009 thru 5/19/2009- the period for which PISD claims\n\na technical problem with \"Link\" to BoardBook internet notices.           In addition, PISD further\n\nrefused and failed to produce evidence of BoardBook service from 8/13/08 to 12/2008 - See\n\n\n5\n  It is not disputed that BoardBook software is licensed by Texas Association of School Boards, Inc.\n(TASB) to its members and that TASB is governed by its member school districts according to its public\nwebsite. Exhibit 2. BoardBook is an agent of PISD to post PISD's internet website notices to comply\nwith TOMA §551.056(b) as the internet notices are produced in PDF format by BoardBook and posted\nand presented for public view on BoardBook website on behalf on PISD. CR205-206. Further,\nBoardBook is a party in joint enterprise with PISD in posting PISD's TOMA internet notices on\nBoardBook's website. Tex. Dept. ofTransp. v. Able, 35 S.W.3d 608, 613 (Tex. 2000).\n\n\nPlaintiffs Second No-evidence and Traditional\nMotion for Summary Judgment                     Cause No. 35621                 Page   16 of 43\n                                                 232\n\f233\n\n\n\n\nPISD's objections to plaintiffs' subpoena duces tecum at CR356-357. Incredibly, PISD further\n\nstated no such documents exist. CR781 (PISD's Response to Request for Production 15).\n\n        Inspite of PISD's refusal, the Attorney General of Texas ordered PISD to produce\n\n\"BoardBook agreement\" pursuant to plaintiff Thanedar's Texas Public Information Act request.\n\nSee CR368-371 (Attorney General's Opinion); and CR367 (Thanedar's Open Records Request).\n\nIt is revealing that the \"BoardBook agreement\" PISD produced was a \"Draft\" agreement for\n\n2007 (Exhibit 14) which was not executed because there is NO evidence of payment of\n\nconsideration of $1 ,600 from PISD to BoardBook in the record. This \"draft\" or \"offer\" is not\n\nsigned by BoardBook and contains no space for BoardBook's signature. Thus the purported\n\nagreement (Exhibit 14) was not executed, and is invalid because no consideration was paid.\n\n        Further the alleged 2007 draft agreement with BoardBook clearly states that unless and\n\nuntil payment of fees (or a purchase order) is received by BoardBook, the BoardBook service\n\nwill not be in effect. Exhibit 14 (see \"Terms\" and \"Fees\"). Here, PISD produced no evidence\n\nwhatsoever that it ever paid the license fee for BoardBook service, nor issued a purchase order\n\nfor the license fees, for the period in question in this lawsuit from August 13, 2008 to May 19,\n\n2009. In fact, PISD refused to produce any evidence that it ever paid license fee for BoardBook\n\nservice for any year from 2007, 2008, and 2009. See CR356-357. Exhibits 20, 21. It further\n\nrefused and failed to produce renewal notices, payments, any correspondence concerning\n\ndelivery and execution of agreement, communication between PISD and BoardBook concerning\n\nthe alleged BoardBook service PISD claims it had for these years (CR356-357) further stating no\n\nsuch documents exist. CR781 (Response to Req. for Prod. 15). Exhibits 20, 21. Because PISD\n\nrefused and failed to show that it paid consideration for BoardBook service, and refused and\n\nfailed to show that it did delivery and execution of agreement, as a matter of law, there was no\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs Second No-evidence and Traditional\nMotion for Summary Judgment                     Cause No. 35621            Page   17 of43\n                                                 233\n\f•\n    234\n\n\n\n\n    agreement between PISD and BoardBook for BoardBook service to post internet notices under\n\n    TOMA. See Exhibit 14 (\"Terms and \"Fees\"). Advantage Physical Therapy, Inc. v. Cruse, 165\n\n    S.W. 3d 21, 24 (Tex.App.-Houston[14th Dis.], 2005 no pet.) (without consideration, there is no\n\n    contract). Thus as a matter of law, PISD's good faith defense based on the alleged link to\n\n    BoardBook service [which it did not have] for posting PISD's internet notices must fail.\n\n            PISD's bare unsupported assertion that it had BoardBook service from 8113/2008 through\n\n    5/19/2009 is hearsay, mere surmise, speculation which is not legal evidence.

Because PISD refused and failed to produce evidence of payment of\n\n    license fees for service posting internet notices to BoardBook, as a matter of law, PISD's good\n\n    faith defense under §551.056(d) must be rejected and it must be concluded that PISD's good\n\n    faith defense was subterfuge and obstruction of justice deserving sanctions by this Court.\n\n            b. \"Created\" Dates of Internet Notices Show Untimeliness:\n\n            The   ih Court of Appeals in its opinion on 4/29/2011 (\"Opinion\") on this matter has\n    found that internet notices of the 22 Meetings in question (including the 3/26/09 meeting) were\n\n    indeed untimely i.e. appeared on PISD/BoardBook's website well after the meetings in question\n\n    were held. See Opinion at 5-6. Also see Exhibit 13-CR814-815; Exhibit 12-CR802; Exhibit 7.\n\n    The appeals court, however, remanded the case due to PISD's alleged contention that the\n\n    \"created dates\" of its internet Adobe PDF notices on BoardBook website were in actuality the\n\n    dates on which PISD printed the internet notices for delivery to plaintiffs. See Opinion at 5-6.\n\n    On remand, plaintiffs requested supplementation on this issue (Exhibit 3), but PISD failed to\n\n    supplement written discovery concerning the above argument it made before the appeals court,\n\n    nor did it indicate where in the record it produced such pertinent evidence. Exhibits 20, 21.\n\n\n\n\n    Plaintiffs Second No-evidence and Traditional\n    Motion for Summary Judgment                     Cause No. 35621               Page   18 of 43\n                                                     234\n\f235\n\n\n\n\n        As explained above, there is no evidence that PISD even had BoardBook service, thus\n\n\"created\" dates being \"print\" dates in BoardBook is an issue created to divert court's attention\n\nand to mislead it- and is fraud on this Court and the appeals court. Importantly, this is an absurd\n\ncontention by PISD wholly unsupported in the \"PDF Reference version 1.3.\" See Exhibit 19.\n                                                     6\nCuriously, there is no evidence that \"created\"           dates in the document properties of PISD's\n\ninternet website notices are in actuality dates on which PISD \"printed\" notices for plaintiffs. In\n\nfact the record shows the opposite - PISD did not print PISD's [untimely] website internet\n\nnotices for plaintiffs. Exhibit 7-pgs 3-6. The copies plaintiffs obtained from Linder were paper\n\ncopies of signed originals made on PISD' s office copier in the presence of plaintiff Thanedar and\n\nhad nothing to do with printing website notices which are unsigned and undated. 7 Exhibit 7-pgs\n\n3-6; Exhibits 8, 10. Thus PISD's argument is frivolous.\n\n        The \"created\" date appearing in the \"document properties\" of PISD's own internet\n\nnotices posted and appearing on the BoardBook website effective 5/19/2009 means what it states\n\nin the document properties - 1) the document is in Adobe PDF format and 2) it was produced\n\n(\"created\") in that format at the stated date and time. See Exhibit 19. Similarly, \"Modified\"\n\nmeans what it states - the date and time on which the said document was \"modified\" or changed.\n\nCreated date and Modified date are standard properties in Adobe's PDF format and are\n\nautomatically generated information in Adobe PDF. Exhibits 7, 19. In fact PISD does not\n\n\n\n\n6\n  Collins English Dictionary-complete and unabridged, Harper Collins publishers, 1991-2003 defines\ncreate: ''to cause to come into existence.\" Merriam-Webster Dictionary 2012 defines create: \"to bring\ninto existence.\"\n7\n Plaintiffs filed PISD's internet notices with document properties on CD-ROM and Hardcopies of CD-\nROM in the record as they were posted by PISD on PISD's website. Plaintiffs downloaded the internet\nnotices to CD-ROM and printed hard copies for filing in the record of this case as evidence. Neither said\nCD-ROM nor Hardcopies of CD-ROM were given to plaintiffs by PISD. Exhibits 4, 5, 9, 10.\nPlaintiffs Second No-evidence and Traditional\nMotion for Summary Judgment                      Cause No. 35621                  Page   19 of 43\n                                                  235\n\f236\n\n\n\n\ndispute plaintiffs' assertion that plaintiffs printed the internet notices from PISD's public website\n\nthemselves. Exhibit 12-Interrogatory No. 24(CR804).\n\n        Further PISD's vague unsupported assertion that v1ewmg PDF notices changes the\n\n\"created\" and \"modify\" dates and times is mere surmise, incorrect, and speculation and is not\n\nevidence. Exhibit 12-Interrogatory No. 25; Kindred, Id at 63. Also see Exhibits 7, 19.\n\n        The competent summary judgment facts are indisputable that defendant's postings of its\n\ninternet notices of board meetings from August 13, 2008 through May 19, 2009 are untimely and\n\nthey were not posted during the prescribed period under TOMA in violation of Sections\n\n551.056(b); 551.041, 551.043(a). The web notice document properties posted by defendant\n\nPISD on its/BoardBook website for 22 Meetings unambiguously show that the web notices were\n\nproduced or created in May 2009 and then were posted on the website untimely on 5/19/09.\n\nExhibits 1, 7; CR807; CR816. The definition of\"created\" here means to prepare or produce the\n\ninternet notices in Adobe PDF format for posting to the website for public to view the internet\n\nnotices. See Exhibit 7; Exhibits 9, 10, 19. PISD admits that internet notices did not appear on its\n\nwebsite from 112009 until5/19/2009. Exhibit 1; Exhibit 13-CR814-815; Exhibit 12-CR802.\n\n        The properties of the website notice of the 3/26/09 meeting (Exhibits 4 and 5) show that\n\nthe web notice was created on 5/8/09 and untimely posted on defendant's/BoardBook's website\n\non 5/19/09 in violation of TOMA, Texas Gov't Code §551.0568 , §551.041 9, §551.043(a) 10 •\n\n\n\n8\n  The Open Meetings Act requires a school district to post notices of its board meetings on its website\nconcurrently for the prescribed 72 hours before the meetings. Texas Gov't Code §551.056\n9\n TOMA requires that \"A governmental body shall give written notice of the date, hour, place, and subject\nof each meeting held by the governmental body.\" Texas Gov't Code §551.041.\n10\n   The notice of a meeting of a governmental body must be posted in a place readily accessible to the\ngeneral public at all times for at least 72 hours before the scheduled time of the meeting, except as\nprovided by Sections 551.044-551.046.

PISD's Good Faith Defense Fails As A Matter Of Law:\n\n        Remarkably, notwithstanding the subterfuge and obstruction described above, PISD's\n\n\"good faith\" defense still fails as a matter of law. For the 11 out of 22 Meetings in question\n\nconcerning the violation of §551.056(b), PISD claims good faith defense under §551.056(d).\n\nTOMA §551.056(d) provides that:\n\n        The validity of a posted notice of a meeting or an agenda by a governmental body\n        or economic development corporation subject to this section that made a good\n        faith attempt to comply with the requirements of this section that is due to a\n        technical problem beyond the control of the governmental body or economic\n        development corporation.\n\n        The definition of \"Good faith\" is statutorily defined: A governmental body satisfies good\n\nfaith under TOMA when it \"makes a good faith attempt to continuously post the notice on the\n\ninternet during the prescribed period ... \" See TOMA §§551.043(b)(l) and (b)(3).\n\n        PISD admits that for 11 meetings from January 15 to May 19, 2009 (including the\n\n3/26/09 Board meeting) for about five months, the internet notices did not appear on its website,\n\nbut claims that it did not know that the \"link\" to the notices on BoardBook was not established or\n\nwas allegedly \"severed.\" The         ih   court of appeals did not find that a material fact question\n\nremains regarding the above assertion of good faith of the alleged \"severance\" of the \"link\" to\n\nnotices for 5 months. See Opinion 1-6. Thus good faith claim by PISD is ripe for summary\n\njudgment in plaintiffs favor for the following reasons.\n\n        1. Failure to Establish Link: Because PISD failed to show competent evidence that it\n\npaid for or had BoardBook service in January 2009, PISD's good faith defense fails. PISD failed\n\nto \"establish the link\" on its new website in 1/2009 to BoardBook because PISD did not have\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs Second No-evidence and Traditional\nMotion for Summary Judgment                        Cause No. 35621               Page   21 of 43\n                                                    237\n\f238\n\n\n\n\nBoardBook service.        Exhibit 1. As explained before, PISD refused and failed to produce\n\nevidence of payment to BoardBook for its service. Thus, the alleged claim of \"severance\" of\n\nlink to BoardBook is subterfuge. Suzie Jameson simply did not think the link to BoardBook\n\nnotices was necessary because there was no BoardBook service in January 2009 through\n\nMay 19, 2009. Exhibit 1. There was no \"accidental\" \"problem\" here. PISD admits that it\n\ndid not \"know\" of the severance of the link to BoardBook for 5 months until plaintiff Thanedar\n\ntold PISD (Linder) of the \"non-appearance\" of internet notices on 5/15/09. CR814-816. Such\n\nclaim of \"ignorance\" of the link problem for 5 months flies in the face of common sense and is\n\nfurther proof of subterfuge. Exhibits 1, 7.\n\n        2. PISD Failed to Verify \"Appearance\" of Internet Notices on its website and failed\n\nto Verify Compliance with TOMA for 5 Months: PISD's good faith defense fails because\n\nPISD failed to verify compliance with §551.056(b) for 5 months, and even notice or remedy the\n\nnon-establishment of \"link\" to notices for 5 months. This is in violation of §551.043(b)(1) and\n\n(3) which requires the continuous attempt to comply i.e. verify compliance and fix any problems\n\nduring the prescribed 72 hours. See §551.043(b)(l) and (b)(3); Exhibits 1, 7. The simple truth\n\nhere is that PISD did not verify \"appearance\" of its internet notices on BoardBook because it\n\nknew that it did not have BoardBook service during 1/2009 thru 5/19/2009- there was no need\n\nto verify what it already knew, that is, it was not posting internet notices on its website and was\n\nnot complying with §551.056(b).\n\n        3. Failure to Establish Link is not a \"Technical\" problem and is not \"Beyond the\n\nControl\" of PISD: PISD's good faith defense fails because the only evidence PISD produces is\n\nJameson's claim that she did not establish the link to internet notices on BoardBook because she\n\ndid not think it was necessary on PISD's new website. Exhibit 1. This belief, or negligence, or\n\n\n\nPlaintiff's Second No-evidence and Traditional\nMotion for Summary Judgment                      Cause No. 35621              Page   22 of43\n                                                 238\n\f239\n\n\n\n\nmistake by PISD (Jameson) is neither \"technical,\" nor \"beyond PISD's control\" for 5 months.\n\nDue diligence in compliance with TOMA is PISD's obligation under law and is well under the\n\ncontrol of PISD. Thus PISD fails the §551.056(d) test.\n\n        PISD tries mighty hard to pass its negligence or consciOus indifference to TOMA\n\n§551.056(b) as a \"technical problem\" \"beyond its control,\" but produces no evidence in support.\n\nPISD produces no authority or evidence to justify why negligence or mistake is a technical\n\nproblem beyond its control. The truth is PISD (Jameson) very quickly established the link when\n\ntold that it was \"necessary\" after 5 months. Exhibit 1. The above is merely subterfuge because\n\nPISD produces no evidence that it even had BoardBook service from Jan. 2009 to 5/19/2009.\n\n        4. Importantly, there is no evidence that PISD ~Checked its Website Even Once\n\nin 5 long months to verify whether or not its internet notices required under TOMA \"appeared\"\n\non its website so that public can actually see them. No one at PISD, not Linder, not Jameson, not\n\nsuperintendent Haenisch bothered to check the \"appearance\" of its internet notices on its website.\n\nCR807; CR768. There is no evidence of due diligence during the 5 months of non-appearance of\n\ninternet notices on PISD's website. CR807. This is \"conscious indifference\" or admission of\n\nguilt and cannot meet the good faith test under §551.056(d). Exhibit 1. CR768; CR807.\n\n      5. Plaintiffs objections to PISD's summary judgment evidence - Linder's Affidavits\nand Haenisch Affidavits and PISD's answers to interrogatories\n\n        Plaintiffs object to Karen Linder Affidavit at CR338-340 (\"Linder Affidavit 1\") and her\n\nsupplemental affidavit at CR726-729 (\"Linder Affidavit 2\") and further object to Barry Haenisch\n\nAffidavit at CR336-337 (\"Haenisch Affidavit 1\") and his supplemental affidavit at CR724-725\n\n(\"Haenisch Affidavit 2\") and PISD's answers to interrogatories.\n\n        A. Objections to Linder Affidavits (Exhibit 18): The Texas Supreme Court has held\n\nthat affidavits must be based exclusively on personal knowledge and a composite or hybrid\n\nPlaintiffs Second No-evidence and Traditional\nMotion for Summary Judgment                     Cause No. 35621              Page 23   of 43\n                                                239\n\f240\n\n\n\n\naffidavit must be disregarded.        See Humphreys v. Caldwell, 888 S.W.2d 469, 470-71 (Tex.\n\n1994). Linder Affidavit 1 and Linder Affidavit 2 are both defective substantively and in form as\n\nthey are not made exclusively from personal knowledge, make impermissible factual and legal\n\nconclusions, are based on hearsay, vague, contradictory conflicting information, and are\n\nirrelevant in part to the issues. Further, Linder is not competent to testify about any technology\n\nissues, or TOMA and its provisions, as she purports to do in Linder Affidavits 1 and 2 which are\n\nthus made in bad faith and must be disregarded. TRCP 166a(h); Also see Humphreys, id.,\n\nRyland Group, Inc. v. Hood, 924 S.W.2d 120, 122 (Tex.1996). Tex. R. Civ. Proc. 166a(c);\n\nCasso v Brand, 776 S.W.2d 551, 558 (Tex. 1989). Larson v. Family Violence & Sexual Assault\n\nPrevention Ctr. Of S. Tex., 64 S.W.3d 506, 514 n.6 (Tex. App.-Corpus Christi 2001, pet.\n\ndenied)( Affidavits must set forth facts, not legal conclusions.) These case authorities apply to all\n\nobjections below. Objections to Linder Affidavit 2 cover same issues in Linder Affidavit 1.\n\n        1) Assertions regarding authorization to post notices (Linder Affidavit 2, ,-3, ,-4): must\n\nbe disregarded as they are vague i.e. do not state who (Board or otherwise) authorized/designated\n\nLinder, make legal conclusions and opinions concerning compliance with TOMA which Linder\n\nis not competent to make.          Further, Linder's sworn statements are conclusively false and\n\ncontradict defendant's polices and bylaws viz. BE (Local) at CR821-823, BDAA (Local) at\n\nCR832, and BJA (Local) at CR834-836 show that the Board retained the authority to call, sign,\n\nand post board meeting notices to itself and did not delegate it to anyone.\n\n        2) Linder Affidavit 2, ,-5, ,-6, and ,-7 must be disregarded as they are composite and\n\nhybrid, not exclusively made from personal knowledge, are hearsay, irrelevant in part, and make\n\nimpermissible legal and factual conclusions. Specifically:\n\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs Second No-evidence and Traditional\nMotion for Summary Judgment                     Cause No. 35621                 Page24 of43\n                                                 240\n\f241\n\n\n\n\n        ~5-   \"Accessibility\" of front door posting: is hearsay, vague, irrelevant to the issues, and\n\nmakes impermissible legal and factual conclusions and subjective opinions. Linder's assertion\n\nthat \"[each notice] was posted on the front door at least 72 hours before each respective meeting\"\n\nis vague i.e. does not state the date and time and does not dispute that the notices of 3/26/09 and\n\n5/19/09 board meetings were not continuously posted for the entirety of 72 hours before the\n\nmeetings, and thus her assertions must be disregarded as they do not raise a fact issue regarding\n\nsaid meetings.\n\n        ~6   and   ~7   - Assertions about public complaints: are hearsay, vague, speculative, and\n\nirrelevant to the issues in this case, and make factual and legal conclusions and subjective\n\nopinions and must be disregarded. Linder is not competent, nor can make and express legal\n\nopinions in her affidavit regarding compliance with TOMA.\n\n        3) Assertions about 3/26/09 notice (Linder Affidavit 2, ,.8): Linder's statement- \"On or\n\nbefore March 23, 2009, I became aware that the notice had been taken or lost from the front\n\ndoor\" is vague, composite, hybrid including collected \"second hand\" information, speculative\n\nand must be disregarded. Linder's statement that she posted notice \"still more than 72 hours\" is\n\nvague and irrelevant to TOMA issues herein as Linder does not specifically dispute that 3/26/09\n\nmeeting notice was not on the front door continuously for 72 hours without revisions before the\n\nstart time of 3/26/09 meeting. Linder does not specify the time and the date on which she taped\n\nor re-taped the notices to the front door. Further 3/20/09 was a Board approved holiday-week of\n\n\"Spring Break\", and Linder fails to assert that she worked during \"Spring Break\" holiday.\n\n        4) Linder's assertions about website changes by Jameson and BoardBook problems:\n\n        Linder Affidavit 2,     ~9   lacks personal knowledge, is second hand information gathered\n\nfrom others, composite in nature and not exclusively from Linder's personal knowledge. As\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs Second No-evidence and Traditional\nMotion for Summary Judgment                       Cause No. 35621               Page 25   of 43\n                                                   241\n\f242\n\n\n\n\nsecretary to Haenisch, Linder is not competent to testify about BoardBook software or any\n\nalleged technical problems at issue here e.g. Jameson not establishing \"link\" to BoardBook\n\nwebsite concerning missing Board notices. Linder's statement - \"Once the notice was created I\n\nwould release it to the District website and the BoardBook software would send and\n\nautomatically place the notice on the district website\" must be disregarded as this is grossly\n\nvague, speculative, contradictory, and draws factual conclusions and is not competent summary\n\njudgment evidence as Linder is not competent to testify about the technology problems and\n\nsoftware technical matters between BoardBook software and PISD website.         For example,\n\nindisputable evidence shows that BoardBook software does not send internet notice to \"district\n\nwebsite.\" To the contrary, BoardBook displays an internet meeting notice on BoardBook's\n\nwebsite after a notice is released. See CR205-206 showing notices on www. boardbook.org.\n\n        Further, Linder fails to even aver whether she had personal knowledge that PISD did or\n\ndid not have BoardBook service at all during 112009 through 5/19/2009 for which PISD claims\n\ngood faith exception. Further, Linder's statement \"On or about January 15, 2009 Suzie Jameson\n\nof the Information Technology Department made some changes to the District website. In the\n\ncourse of making these changes the link between BoardBook and the website was severed\" is\n\nhearsay, lacks personal knowledge, is second hand collected information, and is based on vague\n\nspeculation.    Linder's hearsay testimony on behalf of Jameson is not competent summary\n\njudgment evidence and thus, must be disregarded. Linder's hearsay about \"some changes\" being\n\nmade and the link being \"severed\" is vague, misrepresent facts and are in contradiction with\n\nSuzie Jameson's email to Linder. See Exhibit 1. Linder's repetitive impermissible hearsay\n\nstatements about how BoardBook software worked are irrelevant to the issues in this case as\n\nthere is no competent evidence that PISD even had BoardBook software from 8/13/2008 through\n\n\n\nPlaintiff's Second No-evidence and Traditional\nMotion for Summary Judgment                      Cause No. 35621          Page26   of43\n                                                 242\n\f243\n\n\n\n\n5/19/2009, and Linder is not competent to testify about technical workings of BoardBook\n\nsoftware. Linder's statement \"However, I was unaware that the link between BoardBook and the\n\nwebsite had been severed and BoardBook did not indicate that the link had been severed.\n\nInstead, it appeared that the notices were still being posted to the website just as before. It was\n\nnot until May of 2009 that I was informed that the notices were not appearing on the website\"\n\nmust be disregarded as it is grossly vague, speculative, composite and hybrid in nature, lacking\n\npersonal knowledge of the facts. Thus the entire ~9 must be disregarded. Humphreys, id.\n\n        5) Assertions of appearance of Notices on website (Linder Affidavit 2, ,10): Linder's\n\nassertions are bare conclusions, vague, and speculative, thus are not admissible as evidence\n\nbecause Linder does not affirmatively state that she verified appearance of each of PISD's\n\ninternet website notices on PISD's website or BoardBook website for the public to view for the\n\nprescribed period for Board meetings from August 13, 2008 to January 15, 2009. Linder further\n\nfails to state how she \"knows it for a fact\" that postings were properly made to the website and\n\nhow many times and whether she checked the appearance of notices on PISD website or\n\nBoardBook website during the said time.         This is pertinent because there is absolutely no\n\ncompetent evidence that PISD even had BoardBook service until May 19, 2009 and further PISD\n\nhas admitted that TOMA notices did not \"appear\" on PISD website or BoardBook website for 11\n\nMeetings from January 2009 to May 19, 2009. Further defendant's own website postings\n\nconclusively show that the electronic TOMA notices posted on BoardBook's website were\n\nuntimely created in May, 2009, weeks or months after the board meetings in question took place.\n\nCR814-815. Thus the entire ~10 must be disregarded. Humphreys, id.\n\n        6) Linder's assertions about TOMA compliance (Affidavit 2., 11) must be disregarded\n\nas Linder makes impermissible legal conclusions and Linder is not competent to make them.\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs Second No-evidence and Traditional\nMotion for Summary Judgment                     Cause No. 35621               Page 27 of 43\n                                                243\n\f244\n\n\n\n\nThus, Linder's statement \"All of the notices for the meetings of the District's Board held\n\nbetween August 13, 2008 and May 19, 2009 meet the requirements or an exception set forth in\n\nthe Act\" must be disregarded.\n\n        Plaintiffs object to the entirety of Linder Affidavit 2 and Linder Affidavit 1 as they are\n\negregiously defective substantively and in form as explained above. PISD introduced Linder\n\nAffidavits in bad faith. Linder Affidavits are not in compliance with TRCP 166a(f). Linder\n\nAffidavits must be disregarded in this summary judgment proceeding.\n\n        B. Objections to Haenisch Affidavits (Exhibit 18): The Texas Supreme Court has held\n\nthat affidavits must be based exclusively on personal knowledge and a composite or hybrid\n\naffidavit must be disregarded. Humphreys v. Caldwell, 888 S.W.2d 469, 470-71(Tex. 1994).\n\nHaenisch Affidavit 1 and Haenisch Affidavit 2 both are not made exclusively from personal\n\nknowledge, are based on hearsay, vague, conclusory, and are irrelevant to the issues, thus must\n\nbe struck and disregarded. Objections to Haenisch Affidavit 2 cover same issues in Haenisch\n\nAffidavit 1. See Exhibit 18.\n\n        1) Assertion concerning Linder's authorization to post notices for 8 years (Haenisch\n\nAffidavit 2, ,3): is hearsay, vague and conclusory as Haenisch does not state who exactly\n\nauthorized Linder and how, lacks personal knowledge as Haenisch was not employed for 8 years.\n\nFurther, Haenisch's sworn affidavit is conclusively false and contradict PISD's polices and\n\nbylaws viz. BE (Local) at CR821-823, BDAA (Local) at CR832, and BJA (Local) at CR834-\n\n836 show that Board retained the authority to sign and post board meeting notices to itself and\n\ndid not delegate it. The entire    ~3   must be disregarded as vague, hearsay, composite, and lacking\n\npersonal knowledge.\n\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs Second No-evidence and Traditional\nMotion for Summary Judgment                        Cause No. 35621               Page 28   of 43\n                                                    244\n\f245\n\n\n\n\n         2) Legal conclusions about \"accessible,\" \"convenient\", \"visible,\" and \"place\" CHaenisch\n\nAffidavit 2,   ,4, ,7):   must be disregarded as they are vague, hearsay, and make impermissible\n\nfactual and legal conclusions concerning TOMA about - what is \"accessible,\" what is \"visible\"\n\nfor 24/7, the convenience of posting notices on the front door, what affords most access to\n\ngeneral public, and legal requirements of \"place.\" Haenisch' s opinions are hearsay as they make\n\nassumptions on behalf of the general public and Haenisch is not a competent authority to make\n\nthese legal conclusions or opinions. Further, Haenisch has not been employed by defendant for 8\n\nyears.   This paragraph must be disregarded in entirety.              Humphreys, id; Larson v. Family\n\nViolence & Sexual Assault Prevention Ctr. OfS. Tex., 64 S.W.3d 506, 514 n.6 (Tex.App.-Corpus\n\nChristi 2001, pet. denied) (Affidavits must set forth facts, not legal conclusions.)\n\n         3) Discussion of Terrell contract in closed meeting (Haenisch Affidavit 2, ,5) must be\n\ndisregarded as it is false and is conclusively contradicted by the audio tapes of the 3/26/09\n\nmeeting (2SCR3- Exhibit 8.3 at Counter 43:45 onwards, and Exhibit 8.2 at Counter 19.44\n\nwhich is the undisputed competent evidence in this case that show that Haenisch and the Board\n\nmembers discussed Terrell's employment status and contract in the closed session of the Board\n\nmeeting on 3/26/09.       ~5   must be disregarded as it is in bad faith and contradicted by undisputed\n\nevidence. Humphreys, id. Haenisch affidavits are not in compliance with TRCP 166a(f).\n\n         C. Objections to PISD's answers to interrogatories: PISD did not attach verification\n\nto its answers and supplemental answers to Terrell's interrogatories in compliance with TRCP\n\nRules 197.2(d) and 193.5(b). See CR764-769; CR685-690; CR708-711; CR800-811; CR812-\n\n817. TRCP 197.2(d) requires that \"A responding party- not an agent or attorney as otherwise\n\npermitted by Rule 14 - must sign the answers under oath ... \" The \"Responding Party\" here is\n\nPampa Independent School District.              PISD has attached Karen Linder's affidavit or PISD\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs Second No-evidence and Traditional\nMotion for Summary Judgment                         Cause No. 35621                Page29 of43\n                                                     245\n\f246\n\n\n\n\nattorney's signature to its answers to plaintiffs' interrogatories; however, her affidavit or\n\ncounsel's signature is not sufficient to comply with TRCP 197.2(d).\n\n        Linder performs clerical duties at PISD as secretary to Haenisch. Linder neither has real,\n\nexpress, implied, nor apparent authority to represent PISD, a government body, to make legal\n\nrepresentations on behalf of PISD. It is obvious here that Linder is being put up by PISD as a\n\nshield. As Linder Affidavits above must be struck, it is proper that answers to interrogatories\n\nverified by Linder and PISD counsel must also be struck. It is well established PISD can only\n\nact through its Board as a whole and did not grant any kind of authority to Linder in this matter.\n\nPISD's above answers and supplemental answers to plaintiffs' interrogatories should be struck\n\nand disregarded for failure to comply with TRCP 197.2(d) and 193.5(b).\n\n        Further, Linder's affidavits and PISD's assertions concerning BoardBook (CR800-811)\n\nare not legal evidence because Linder does not claim expertise, nor assert knowledge or\n\nexperience in technical matters relating to PISD's website or the alleged \"link\" issues, or\n\nBoardBook software. PISD's claims concerning how \"created\" dates in document properties of\n\nAdobe PDFs in BoardBook changed due to printing (refer to appeals court's opinion at 5-6) are\n\nfrivolous, vague, mere surmise and are not legal evidence. Kindred, Id at 63. Further, there is no\n\nevidence that Linder has any knowledge, responsibility, or experience concerning document\n\nproperties of internet notices or BoardBook software's technical or security functions.\n\n        Plaintiffs note that PISD has deleted the internet notice for 5/19/09 meeting and replaced\n\nit with a notice for meeting on 5/18/09. It is not disputed that no meeting ever took place on\n\n5/18/2009. Plaintiffs object to this tampering with evidence. The original correct internet notice\n\nfor 5/19/09 is in the record on CD-ROM and in Hardcopy formats. Exhibits 9, 10.\n\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs Second No-evidence and Traditional\nMotion for Summary Judgment                     Cause No. 35621               Page   30 of 43\n                                                246\n\f247\n\n\n\n\n        PISD's good faith defense under §551.056(d) is a fraud on the Court, a subterfuge and\n\nmust be rejected. Plaintiffs are entitled to summary judgment in their favor in this regard.\n\n2. Plaintiffs are entitled to declaration that PISD violated TOMA §551.051 specifically\nconcerning the 3/26/09 Board meeting and 22 Meetings.\n\n        TOMA §551.051: School District: Place of Posting Notice specifically states:\n\n        A school district shall post notice of each meeting on a bulletin board at a place\n        convenient to the public in the central administrative office of the district.\n\n        Tex. Gov't Code §551.051.\n\n        No material fact question remains here. It is undisputed that PISD taped TOMA notices\n\nto front door of its central administrative office (Central Office) for Board meetings for 3/26/09\n\nand 22 Meetings e.g. See Exhibits 7, 17. See Exhibit 11-Req. for Admission nos. 5 and 7.\n\n        TOMA mandates a physical location i.e. Bulletin Board in central administrative office,\n\nwhere PISD must post TOMA notices. §551.051. This is further emphasized by §§551.043(b)(2)\n\nand (b)(3).\n\n        The statutory language of \"Bulletin Board\" is clear and unambiguous. Therefore, the\n\ncourt lacks the power to interpret or change it and must apply the most obvious and common\n\nmeaning of the words. See the Tex. Dept. ofTransp. v. City of Sunset Valley, 146 S.W. 3d 637,\n\n642 (Tex. 2004) (If a statute is clear and unambiguous, courts should afford it its common\n                                                        11\nmeaning). The meaning of words \"Bulletin Board\"              has been well established for more than\n\n150 years as a board for posting notices at a school.\n\n\n\n\n11\n  Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, Eleventh Edition defining bulletin board ( 1831 ): \"a board\nfor posting notices (as at a school).\" Merriam-Webster, http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary (last\nvisited 3/16/2012) defining bulletin board (1831): \"a board for posting notices (as at a school).\"\n\n\nPlaintiffs Second No-evidence and Traditional\nMotion for Summary Judgment                     Cause No. 35621                  Page   31 of 43\n                                                 247\n\f248\n\n\n\n\n       The meaning of front door 12 has been well established for more than 250 years. It is\n\nobvious to a reasonable person that the predominant purpose of a \"door\" is to \"enter or leave a\n\nstructure\" or create a \"barrier\" to close or open an entry and the predominant purpose of a\n\n\"Bulletin Board\" is to \"post notices.\" Thus as a matter of law front door is not bulletin board and\n\ndoes not meet the requirement of §551.051.\n\n        PISD violated §551.051 by failing to post notices of the 3/26/09 meeting and the 22\n\nMeetings on a bulletin board in the Central Office. Further it is undisputed that PISD had a glass\n\nenclosed bulletin board inside the central administrative building that PISD did not use for\n\nTOMA notices. PISD taped notices on the front door of its Central Office building so that the\n\ngeneral public is forced to stand outside of the building to read notices of meetings. Exhibits 7,\n\n17. After this lawsuit was filed, defendant knowingly removed the bulletin board in the Central\n\nOffice lobby and placed it outside the front door of the Central Office building on or about\n\n6/5/09. See Exhibit 11-Req. for Admission 3 and 4; Exhibit 7. Thus it is obvious that PISD\n\nknows the difference between front door and bulletin board.\n\n        Front door is not bulletin board under TOMA. Even assuming arguendo, \"Front Door\" is\n\nbulletin board, front door of a central administrative office building as place to post TOMA\n\n\n\n\n12\n  Cambridge Dictionary of American English, http://dictionaries.cambridge.org (last visited l 0/21120 l 0)\ndefining 'the \"front door\" of a building, esp. a house, is the door on the side of the building that faces\nthe street, or the main entrance door.'\n\nDictionary.com, http://dictionary.reference.com (last visited 10/211201 0) defining \"front door (1740-\n1750): \"the main entrance to a house or other building, usually facing a street.\"\n\nMerriam-Webster (thesaurus), http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary (last visited 3/16/2012)\ndefining door: 1) \"a barrier by which an entry is closed and opened\"; 2) \"the opening through which one\ncan enter or leave a structure\" <a steady stream of visitors through the front door>.\n\nPlaintifrs Second No-evidence and Traditional\nMotion for Summary Judgment                       Cause No. 35621                  Page 32   of 43\n                                                  248\n\f•\n    249\n\n\n\n\n    notices is not \"convenient\" 13 and further is not \"accessible\" 14 under TOMA as a matter of law.\n\n    Forcing general public, citizens, and taxpayers to stand outside the administrative building\n\n    braving snow, rain, heat, cold, traffic in and out of the building is neither safe, accessible, easy,\n\n    comfortable, advantageous, nor suited to read notices, thus not convenient under TOMA\n\n    §551.051.\n\n              Further forcing taxpaying public to stand outside of the building they paid for is offensive\n\n    to the purpose of TOMA. Being forced to stand outside of a building is not proper, suitable, or\n\n    safe as it exposes readers to harm coming from the street's unsafe conditions including crime.\n\n              PISD's front door posting of notices of 3/26/09 and 22 Meetings does not comply with\n\n    the \"in\" the Central Administrative Office requirement of §551.051 because PISD's notice\n\n    cannot physically be read from inside PISD' s central administrative office. Exhibits 7, 17.\n\n    To read PISD's meeting notice posted on its Central Office front door, one must stand outside\n\n    the Central Office building to read the notice. The clear language and intent of §551.051 is that a\n\n    reader must be able to enter the Central Office and read a notice \"in\" the central administrative\n\n    office.    Because PISD's front door posting of notices of 3/26/09 and 22 Meetings fail this\n\n    requirement, PISD is in violation of §551.051.\n\n              Based on above, posting TOMA notices on front door does not meet \"convenient\" test of\n\n    §551.051 and further fails the \"readily accessible\" test under §551.043.\n\n              As explained above, PISD fails even the overruled \"substantial compliance\" standard\n\n    here - posting notices on front door does not meet reasonable standard of suitability for reading\n\n\n    13\n      The American Heritage Dictionary defining convenient: \"Suited or favorable to one's comfort,\n    purpose, or needs.\" Merriam-Webster Dictionary defining convenient: \"Suited to personal comfort or to\n    easy performance; suited to a particular situation; affording accommodation or advantage.\"\n    14\n      Merriam-Webster Dictionary defining accessible: \"capable of being used or seen.\" Collins English\n    Dictionary defining accessible: \"easy to approach, enter, or use.\"\n    Plaintiffs Second No-evidence and Traditional\n    Motion for Summary Judgment                      Cause No. 35621                 Page 33   of 43\n                                                      249\n\f250\n\n\n\n\nnotices and because it is an \"unwelcome mat\" to \"keep out\" or to discourage, frustrate taxpayers\n\nand public from entering the central administrative office to participate and observe their school\n\ndistrict. PISD fails the Texas Supreme Court law of the Exact and Literal compliance standard\n\nbecause PISD failed to post notices of the 3/26/09 and 22 Meetings in question in the place\n\nspecifically mandated for school districts by law- \"Bulletin Board.\" See §551.051; Acker, !d.\n\n        If this court were to permit PISD to make its own law and not comply with the\n\nspecifically designated place in TOMA, it would be an invitation to government entities\n\nthroughout the State of Texas to post TOMA notices on back doors, side doors, front/back/side\n\nwindows, on plants in central office, on restroom doors, office doors, and so on. This is not only\n\noffensive, but will eviscerate TOMA.\n\n        Plaintiffs are thus entitled to declaratory relief that PISD violated TOMA §551.051 for\n\nthe 3/26/09 Board meeting and 22 Meetings in question.\n\n3. Plaintiffs are entitled to declaration by the court that PISD violated §551.043 concerning\nthe 3/26/09 Board meeting and 5/19/09 Board Meetings\n\n        Plaintiffs' sworn testimony is undisputed that the notice of 3/26/09 Board meeting was\n\nnot witnessed or seen posted in the bulletin board in PISD's Central Office nor on its front door\n\nat 5 P.M. and after 6 P.M. on 3/23/09 i.e. notice was posted less than the prescribed 72 hours in\n\nviolation of §551.043. Exhibit 7. PISD's (Linder) vague claims and surmise that it posted all\n\nnotices on the front door more than 72 hours ahead of time are not competent summary judgment\n\nevidence or legal evidence and must be disregarded. Kindred, Supra, Further such conclusory\n\nassertions do not specifically dispute 1) Thanedar and Terrell's conversation with PISD's\n\nemployee Ramiro Soto that there was no board meeting notice posted at or immediately after 6\n\nP.M. on 3/23/09 and 2) that plaintiffs noticed that Linder was not at work at central office at\n\nPISD at 5 P.M. or at or after 6 P.M. on 3/23/09 and that 3) the notice appeared on the front door\n\n\nPlaintiffs Second No-evidence and Traditional\nMotion for Summary Judgment                     Cause No. 35621              Page 34   of 43\n                                                250\n\f251\n\n\n\n\nthe next day on 3/24/09 i.e. less than prescribed 72 hours (a \"revised\" notice was taped to the\n\nfront door of central office building on 3/24/09). Exhibit 7.\n\n        Similarly, plaintiff Thanedar's sworn testimony about his conversation with Linder\n\nregarding PISD's 5/19/09 Board meeting is undisputed i.e. Linder mentioned to Thanedar that\n\nthe notice for 5/19/09 meeting was posted on 5/18/09 because the date of the meeting had\n\nchanged. This caused the notice to be posted for less than the prescribed 72 hours in violation of\n\n§551.043 and the Exact and Literal Standard of compliance with TOMA promulgated by the\n\nSupreme Court in Acker. Exhibit 7. Because PISD posted (paper) notices of 3/26/09 and\n\n5/19/09 Board meetings at a physical location for less than the prescribed 72 hours, PISD\n\nviolated §551.043.\n\n4. Plaintiffs are entitled to declaration by the court that PISD violated §551.041 when\nPISD failed to give notice of \"place\" of its 3/26/09 Board meeting and 22 Meetings\n\n        There is no evidence and it is undisputed that PISD's notices of 3/26/09 board meeting\n\nand 22 Meetings refer to \"321 W. Albert\" and do not specify a city where the meeting will be\n\nheld. See e.g. Exhibit 6, Exhibit 11-Req. for Admission no.15. In certain cases, defendant's\n\nnotices merely state \"Pampa High School\" or \"Pampa Junior High School\" without stating the\n\naddress. PISD does not dispute this. Exhibit 10- See CR70-71, CR75, CR89-90, CR129-130,\n\nCR147-148, CR156, CR167-168, CR170. Such truncations require the general public to \"fill in\n\nthe blanks\" which is in violation of TOMA. TOMA §551.041 specifically requires that the\n\ngeneral public or a \"reader\" be notified of the \"place,\" but PISD failed to do so.          The Texas\n\nSupreme Court has \"demanded exact and literal compliance\" with the Open Meetings Act. See\n\nAcker v. Texas Water Commission, 790 S.W.2d 299 (Tex. 1990). Here defendant's truncations\n\nmentioned above violate the plain language of TOMA.               Further it is public record and is\n\nundisputed that PISD encompasses two counties - Gray county and parts of Roberts county,\n\nPlaintiffs Second No-evidence and Traditional\nMotion for Summary Judgment                     Cause No. 35621                 Page 35   of 43\n                                                251\n\f252\n\n\n\n\nwhere meetings could be held in different cities. 15 Thus plaintiffs are entitled to declaration that\n\nPISD violated §551.041 's \"place\" requirement in regards to 3/26/09 Board meeting and 22\n\nMeetings in question.\n\n5. Plaintiffs are entitled to declaration by the court that PISD violated §551.045(d)\nconcerning the notices of 3/26/09 Board meeting and 22 Meetings\n\n           It is undisputed that Karen Linder, secretary to Superintendent, signed notices of 3/26/09\n\nboard meeting and 22 Meetings on behalf of the Board of Trustees. 16 See e.g. Exhibit 6. There\n\nis no evidence that PISD Board of Trustees ever designated or authorized Linder to sign on its\n\nbehalf or post notices of its meetings. PISD admits that Board never authorized nor designated\n\nKaren Linder under TOMAto sign notices of meetings on behalf of the Board. Exhibit 12-Req.\n\nfor Production 28. §551.045(d) requires an authorized or designated person to post notices of\n\nmeetings. The language of the section in this regard is clear - it applies to all notices - not just\n\nemergency meetings. 17 See §551.045(d). Thus plaintiffs are entitled to declaration that PISD\n\nfailed to comply with §551.045(d) because Linder was neither authorized nor designated by\n\nBoard to post meeting notices when she did so for 3/26/09 meeting and 22 Meetings. Acker.\n\n6. Plaintiffs are entitled to declaration that PISD violated TOMA §551.101 by improperly\nclosing its March 26,2009 meeting and further violated §551.074(b)\n\n          It is not disputed that defendant's president, Mr. Charles Smith did not identify the\n\nsection or sections of TOMA that authorized closing the 3/26/09 board meeting to the public\n\n15\n  While it may seem possible to guess that \"321 W. Albert\" is in Pampa, Texas, there are over 1,030\nschool districts whose names do not necessarily lend to guessing names of the cities where the meetings\nmay be located e.g. Pharr-San Juan-Alamo (PSJA) lSD; Spring Branch lSD, etc.\n16\n     The internet notices required under §551.056(b) posted untimely by PISD were not signed by anyone.\n17\n   Tex. Gov't Code §551.045(d) requires: \"A person who is designated or authorized to post notice of a\nmeeting by a governmental body under this subchapter\" to post notice for the governmental body. The\n\"subchapter\" referenced above is unambiguously the \"Subchapter C: Notice of Meetings\" and the\nrequirement of an authorized or a designated person posting notices of meetings applies to all postings of\nnotices under TOMA and not just the emergency meetings.\n\n\nPlaintiffs Second No-evidence and Traditional\nMotion for Summary Judgment                        Cause No. 35621                  Page   36 of 43\n                                                    252\n\f•\n    253\n\n\n\n\n    under TOMA before closing the 3/26/09 meeting. See Exhibit 11-Req. for Admission no.14;\n\n    Exhibits 7, 16.     PISD thus did not comply with the Tex. Gov't Code §551.101(2). Therefore,\n\n    plaintiffs are entitled to declaration that PISD unlawfully closed meeting on March 26, 2009 in\n\n    violation of Tex. Gov't Code §551.1 01. Acker, Supra. Plaintiffs are entitled to all legal and\n\n    equitable relief and that 3/26/09 closed meeting and actions taken in it be declared unlawful and\n\n    contents of the closed meeting be made public and allowed to be freely copied and distributed.\n\n            PISD further violated §551.074(b) by deliberating on Terrell's contract termination in the\n\n    closed meeting on 3/26/09 when Terrell had specifically requested the action be deliberated in\n\n    open meeting per §551.074(b). Exhibits 15, 16 (Tape 2 at Counter 43:45.). Plaintiffs are\n\n    entitled to the declaration that PISD violated §551.074(b). Acker, Supra.\n\n    B. Voidance of PISD's unlawful actions is proper due to subterfuge, persistent conscious\n    and defiant violations of TOMA committed over numerous months\n\n            The action taken in 3/26/09 Board meeting terminating Terrell's contract violated\n\n    TOMA's notice provisions as shown before, thus it is voidable and should be voided. §551.141;\n\n    Ferris, Infra; Acker, Supra.\n\n            The 22 Meetings including the 3/26/09 meeting were unlawfully convened as shown\n\n    before. Since all the actions taken in the 3/26/09, 5/19/09 and 22 Meetings violate TOMA's\n\n    notice provisions as demonstrated before, said actions in 22 Meetings are voidable and should be\n\n    voided. §551.141; Ferris, Infra; Acker, Supra. See other additional case authorities below.\n\n            Therefore, upon voidance of the action terminating Terrell's employment contract\n\n    (Exhibit 15), this Court should issue mandamus ordering PISD to reinstate Terrell and pay her\n\n    damages for back pay and benefits, currently estimated at $209,000 to date and continuing\n\n    (Exhibits 25, 26). Ferris v.

App.--Austin 1991, writ denied) (Employee terminated in violation ofTOMA is entitled to\n\n     back pay and reinstatement).\n\n             Even if PISD's Board attempts a second time to terminate Terrell, such termination\n\n     cannot be retroactive to 3/26/09. Ferris, ld. Further, Terrell's termination cannot be retroactive\n\n     under Texas Education Code. Pursuant to Texas Education Code, Terrell's teacher contract\n\n     cannot be terminated without providing 45 days notice (for 2012-13 school year- 10 days)\n\n     before the last day of instruction in a school year.       Failure to provide 45 days notice and\n\n     termination in a lawfully convened meeting in compliance with TOMA automatically renews\n\n     Terrell's teaching contract for another year. See Texas Education Code §21.103.\n\n             This court should further issue injunction against PISD to stop and prevent further\n\n     violations ofTOMA's notice provisions. Plaintiffs should be granted litigation costs and attorney\n\n     fees as plaintiffs have substantially prevailed in this litigation having established TOMA\n\n     violations and prosecuting this case in good faith and for public good and to augment public\n\n     interest. §551.142(b).\n\n             Authority For Voidance Is Overwhelming:              There is overwhelming authority for\n\n     voidance of PISD's actions taken in violation of TOMA's notice provisions in unlawfully\n\n     convened Board meetings and for other relief requested in this suit. Courts have repeatedly\n\n     voided actions of governmental bodies taken in violation of TOMA. Ferris v. Texas Board of\n\n     Chiropractic Examiners, Supra; City of Bells v. Greater Texoma Uti!. Auth., 744 S.W.2d\n\n     636,640 (Tex. App.-Dallas 1987, no writ); Point Isabel ISD v. Hinojosa, 797 S.W.2d 176\n\n     (Tex.App-Corpus Christ 1990, writ denied).\n\n             There is not a single case in TOMA jurisprudence where a court did not void unlawful\n\n     actions under TOMA faced with subterfuge, a defiant willful persistent pattern of violations of\n\n\n\n     Plaintiffs Second No-evidence and Traditional\n     Motion for Summary Judgment                     Cause No. 35621              Page   38 of 43\n                                                     254\n\f..\n     255\n\n\n\n\n     TOMA and obstruction of justice as here. Further PISD has refused and failed to ratify its\n                                                                        18\n     unlawful actions in meetings held in compliance with TOMA.\n\n             Courts have also imposed special damages, as requested here, for conscious indifference\n\n     and failure to comply with the Open Meetings Act, as here. See Wells v. Hutchinson, 499\n\n     F.Supp. 174, 198 (E.D. Tex. 1980). As demonstrated in the record and in this motion, PISD has\n\n     engaged in frivolous arguments, subterfuge, and obstruction of justice: 1) claiming good faith\n\n     defense concerning BoardBook service while refusing to produce evidence that PISD ever paid\n\n     consideration to BoardBook i.e. license fees, maintenance/support fees as required by\n\n     BoardBook (Exhibit 14) for the period it claims good faith defense. For lack of proof of\n\n     consideration, the alleged 2007 contract (Exhibit 14) with BoardBook is invalid. There is simply\n\n     no evidence whatsoever that PISD even had BoardBook service from 8/13/2008 through\n\n     5/19/2009; 2) arguing before appeals court that printing notices for plaintiffs \"changed\" the\n\n     create dates of its internet website notices, and then refusing and failing to provide evidence of it.\n\n     Making this worse, PISD even admitted that plaintiffs printed the internet notices themselves\n\n     from PISD's public website. CR804.\n\n             PISD's defiant willful longstanding violations ofTOMA require voidance to demonstrate\n\n     to government entities that TOMA will be upheld and honored by Texas courts.                        Special\n\n     damages in the amount to be determined by the court should be granted to plaintiffs for\n\n     prosecuting this unduly protracted litigation pro se expending substantial money, energy, effort,\n\n\n\n\n     18\n       In Austin Transportation Study Policy Advisor Committee v. Sierra Club, 843 S.W.2d 683,686-87 (Tex.\n     App.--Austin 1992, writ denied), the court did not void the unlawful actions because the governmental\n     entity acknowledged its violations of TOMA on 33 occasions and ratified the actions in subsequent\n     meetings convened in compliance with TOMA upon admitting its violations. Sierra Club was granted\n     in excess of $146,000 in costs and attorney fees plus additional attorney fees for each stage of appeals,\n     because Sierra Club was found to have substantially prevailed.\n     Plaintiffs Second No-evidence and Traditional\n     Motion for Summary Judgment                      Cause No. 35621                  Page 39   of 43\n                                                       255\n\f..\n     256\n\n\n\n\n     and time (over 1,650 hours over 3       ~   years). Exhibit 26. Plaintiffs will produce details of hours\n\n     and money spent by plaintiffs for Court's review at the direction of the Court.\n\n     C. Special damages and Sanctions on PISD and counsel are appropriate in this case:\n\n             Special damages are warranted here due to the subterfuge and obstruction of justice by\n\n     defendant and counsel in this case. Plaintiffs rely on the facts and arguments in the preceding\n\n     paragraphs in this regard. PISD which is entirely funded by taxes from Texas citizens continues\n\n     to flaunt its defiance against TOMA and the will of Texas citizens, legislature, taxpayers, and the\n\n     Texas Supreme Court. Plaintiffs' urge sanctions on PISD.\n\n             This case isn't only about plaintiffs- it's about the Texas citizens who expect honesty and\n\n     voluntary compliance to openness, transparency, and integrity from their government.                  The\n\n     failure to void PISD's egregious and defiant violations of TOMA will eviscerate protections\n\n     granted to Texas citizens under TOMA, undermining and abrogating concepts of honest\n\n     voluntary compliance with the promise of open government and transparency, and further\n\n     lowering Texans' regard for democratic processes, judiciary, and the rule of law.\n\n                                                 VII. CONCLUSION\n\n             The appeals court identified only one fact question - PISD's good faith claim under\n\n     §551.056(d). However, as shown above, PISD's good faith claim is brazenly fraudulent and is\n\n     constructed to obstruct justice against pro se plaintiffs and Texas citizens and taxpayers. PISD\n\n     and its counsel deliberately misrepresented its good faith claim to the        7th   Court of Appeals to\n\n     improperly obtain remand of this case. After achieving its purpose of delay and obstruction,\n\n     PISD now has defiantly refused to supplement the discovery concerning its claim of good faith.\n\n             This Court should not countenance PISD's misconduct and perversion of TOMA's\n\n     purpose to foster openness and integrity in government.\n\n\n\n     Plaintiffs Second No-evidence and Traditional\n     Motion for Summary Judgment                         Cause No. 35621                  Page 40   of43\n                                                         256\n\f 257\n\n\n\n\n        For these reasons, plaintiffs ask for summary judgment on all their claims as set forth\n\nabove in their favor.\n\n                                                 VIII.

I don't remember exactly.          I -- most of my\n\n 6   conversations were with Angela.\n\n 7          Q.   But she's not a technology person.           Correct?\n\n 8          A.   She's not a programmer.\n\n 9          Q.   Now, for SchoolCenter -- correct me if I'm wrong,\n\n10   was interested with the responsibility of changing the\n\n11   website of PISD.        Correct?\n\n12          A.   Yes.\n\n13          Q.

Did you\n\n16   pass on that information to them?\n\n17          A.   They specialize in websites for school districts\n\n18   all over the country, so we provided them with the content\n\n19   from our previous website, the articles that we had\n\n20   already posted, the -- all of the data, and they went\n\n21   through that information and created the new site.\n\n22          Q.   They never came to PISD to have meetings with\n\n23   you?\n\n24          A.   No, they did not.\n\n25          Q.

So they downloaded -- apparently, they -- they\n\n12   worked with the access to your system, collected the\n\n13   information and created a new website.              Right?\n\n14       A.

What time -- do you recall any date in\n\n19   particular?\n\n20       A.     I don't recall the date.\n\n21       Q.     And this was a brand new website.             Right?\n\n22       A.

And how did you\n\n18   come to that understanding?\n\n19       A.    I'm sorry.     I don't understand your question.\n\n20       Q.

I didn't think that the link to the meeting\n\n24   notices was not needed.

We will reverse and remand.\n\n\n\n\n      1\n          Appellants are husband and wife.\n      2\n          See TEX. GOV’T. CODE ANN. §§ 551.001-.146 (West 2004 & Supp. 2010).\n\f                           Factual and Procedural Background\n\n\n       Appellant Terrell was a first-year teacher in the PISD whose probationary\n\ncontract of employment was terminated by action of the PISD School Board on March\n\n26, 2009. On May 29, 2009, appellants filed their original petition alleging numerous\n\nviolations of TOMA and requesting that the trial court issue a temporary restraining\n\norder against PISD, issue a temporary and permanent injunction against PISD, and\n\nenter an order declaring that all meetings of the School Board held between certain\n\nspecified dates to be void and that all actions taken by the School Board at those\n\nmeetings to be void, specifically identifying the termination of Terrell’s employment.\n\nFurther, appellants requested that the trial court enter a writ of mandamus ordering the\n\nSchool Board to reinstate Terrell.      Appellants requested an unspecified amount of\n\ndamages, costs of court, and attorneys fees.              PISD duly filed an answer to the\n\nallegations contained in appellants’ original petition.\n\n\n       Appellants obtained a setting for a hearing on the application for a temporary\n\ninjunction and, in connection with the setting, caused to be issued a subpoena duces\n\ntecum for PISD employee, Karen Linder.            PISD filed an objection to the subpoena\n\nduces tecum and to certain of the documents requested. Appellants subsequently filed\n\na motion to “show cause and strike defendant’s original answer.” The trial court granted\n\nPISD’s objections to the subpoena duces tecum and denied appellants’ motion to show\n\ncause and strike PISD’s original answer by order dated June 10, 2009. After the trial\n\ncourt refused to enter a temporary restraining order, appellants requested the trial court\n\nto vacate a setting on the temporary injunction.\n\n                                              2\n\f       On June 15, 2009, appellants filed a traditional motion for summary judgment\n\nand a no-evidence motion for summary judgment. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a; 166a(i).\n\nAfter PISD had filed a response to the motions, appellants subsequently filed objections\n\nto PISD’s summary judgment evidence. The trial court denied appellants’ motion for\n\nsummary judgment by order dated October 12, 2009. Appellants then filed a motion\n\nrequesting the trial court to reconsider its ruling on the summary judgment and to enter\n\na ruling on appellants’ objections to PISD’s summary judgment evidence. The trial court\n\ndenied both the motion to reconsider and the objections to PISD’s summary judgment\n\nevidence by order dated December 23, 2009. On that same day, PISD filed a traditional\n\nand no-evidence motion for summary judgment.          On May 14, 2010, the trial court\n\ngranted PISD’s motion for summary judgment without specifying upon which ground the\n\nmotion was granted.\n\n\n       Appellants appeal the order of the trial court, asserting an extensive number of\n\nreasons why the trial court’s judgment was in error. The issues presented may be\n\nbroken down into allegations that the trial court erred in not finding that PISD violated\n\nthe provisions of TOMA regarding: 1) posting of notice of meetings, 2) requirements for\n\nspecificity in the notice of meetings and the place of the meetings, 3) internet posting\n\nprovisions, 4) requirement that all deliberations of the type involved be held in a public\n\nmeeting, 5) allegations that the notices posted were not posted by a person with\n\nauthority to post notices of meetings. In addition to the alleged violations of TOMA,\n\nappellants allege that the trial court erred in: 6) ruling on various objections to some of\n\nPISD’s summary judgment evidence, 7) in granting PISD’s motion for summary\n\njudgment, and 8) in denying appellants’ motion for summary judgment. Because one of\n                                            3\n\fthe issues appellants raise regarding violations of TOMA is dispositive of this matter, we\n\nwill address it first.\n\n\n                                   Standard of Review\n\n\n        We review the granting or denial of a motion for summary judgment de novo.\n\nSee Valence Operating Co. v. Dorsett, 164 S.W.3d 656, 661 (Tex. 2005). When both\n\nparties file a motion for summary judgment, as in this case, and one is granted and one\n\nis denied then we, as the reviewing court, must determine all questions presented and\n\nrender the judgment that should have been rendered by the trial court. See HCBeck,\n\nLtd. v. Rice, 284 S.W.3d 349, 352 (Tex. 2009).\n\n\n                                Internet Posting of Notices\n\n\n        TOMA requires a school district, among other governmental bodies, to\n\nconcurrently post notice of a School Board meeting on the school district’s internet\n\nwebsite. TEX. GOV’T CODE ANN. § 551.056(b) (West 2010).3 Section 551.056 provides\n\nthat a good faith attempt to comply with the requirements is not affected when the\n\nfailure to comply with the requirement is due to a technical problem beyond the control\n\nof the school district. § 551.056(d).\n\n\n        The record before us clearly demonstrates that, for the period of time between\n\nJanuary 15, 2009, and May 19, 2009, the notices of the School Board meetings could\n\nnot have been posted on the PISD website.         Further, summary judgment evidence\n\nproves that the failure to post was due to a cutting of the link between the software\n\n        3\n        Further references to the Texas Government Code Annotated will be by\nreference to “section ___”, “Section ___” or “§ ____.”\n                                            4\n\fprogram used to post the notices, BoardBook, and the website.           PISD contends,\n\nthrough Linder’s affidavit, that, although the link was cut to the website, the notices\n\ncontinued to be posted as required. They simply did not appear on the website.\n\n\n      According to PISD’s theory, the failure to post was due to a technical problem\n\nbeyond its control and, therefore, PISD’s failure to post is excused under the good faith\n\nexception of the statute. Appellants, however, contend that the missing notices, when\n\nproduced by PISD, reflect that they were “created” not around the time of the original\n\nmeeting, but after PISD was notified of the failure of the connection between the\n\nsoftware and the website. Under appellants’ theory, this summary judgment evidence\n\nestablishes a material fact issue regarding the good faith attempt of PISD to post the\n\nnotices on its website as required by the statute. See § 551.056(d).\n\n\n      A review of the summary judgment evidence does, indeed, reflect that the\n\nnotices in question show to have been “created” after PISD was notified of the failure to\n\npost the required website notices.     Neither party offered any summary judgment\n\nevidence as to what the term “created,” as it appears under the properties tab of the\n\nnotice, means. Both parties have opined as to what it means. Appellants contend it\n\nmeans the notices were not prepared and entered until after the notification that PISD\n\nhad failed to post notices of the School Board meetings as required. PISD contends\n\n“created” means the date the particular notice was printed for delivery to appellants.\n\nWe, however, have no evidence to support either interpretation.\n\n\n      In our analysis of the summary judgment under the de novo standard of review,\n\nevidence favorable to appellants must be taken as true and every reasonable inference\n\n                                           5\n\fmust be indulged in favor of appellants. See Diversicare Gen. Partner, Inc. v. Rubio,\n\n185 S.W.3d 842, 846 (Tex. 2005). Accordingly, we find that there is a material fact\n\nissue about whether PISD actually attempted to post the notices and, therefore, met the\n\ngood faith exception to the requirement to concurrently post notices of the School Board\n\nmeetings on its website.\n\n\n       PISD argues that this case is similar to the allegations in Argyle Indep. Sch. Dist.\n\nv. Wolf in which the Fort Worth court determined that there was no evidence of bad faith\n\non the part of the school district. See 234 S.W.3d 229, 248-49 (Tex.App.—Fort Worth\n\n2007, no pet.). However, in Argyle the parties had a stipulation of evidence that the\n\nwebmaster had, in fact, received the notice of the meeting in question and attempted to\n\npost the same on the school district’s website. See id. at 248. Further, the parties\n\nstipulated that the failure of the notice to appear was beyond the control of the school\n\ndistrict and the problem was corrected a few hours before the meeting. See id. The\n\nevidence in Argyle is factually distinguishable from the summary judgment evidence in\n\nthis case and does not control our disposition of this matter.\n\n\n                                        Conclusion\n\n\n       Because the issue of concurrently posting notices on the PISD’s website involves\n\na genuine issue of material fact not established as a matter of law, we reverse the\n\njudgment of the trial court. We remand this matter for further proceedings consistent\n\nwith this opinion.\n\n\n                                                        Mackey K.

Plaintiffs represented themselves prose and were not represented by counsel at\n\ntrial or at any time during this litigation.\n\n        3.      Pampa Independent School District (\"PISD\")              IS   a School District with its\n\nAdministrative offices located in Pampa, Gray County, Texas.\n\n        4.      At the commencement of trial on October 9, 2013, Plaintiffs did not reside within\n\nthe PISD district boundaries but instead resided in Bexar County, Texas.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     326\n\f327\n\n\n\n\n        5.     Terrell was employed by PISD in 2008 under a probationary teaching contract\n\nwhose term was 10 months which expired by its own terms at the end of the 2008-2009 school\n\nyear.\n\n        6.     In March of 2009 Terrell was given actual notice that PISD intended to terminate\n\nher probationary contract as required by the Texas Education Code. Thereafter, the termination\n\nof Terrell's probationary contract was placed on the School Board agenda for the regularly\n\nscheduled meeting to take place on March 26, 2009. The written notice for the March 26, 2009\n\nschool board meeting was properly placed on the front door of the PISD administration building\n\nlocated in Pampa, Gray County, Texas more than 72 hours prior to the start of the meeting.\n\n        7.     Plaintiffs had actual notice of March 26, 2009 board meeting and each Plaintiff\n\npersonally attended the meeting. Further, Terrell spoke to the board during the public comment\n                                                                         :l\n\n\n\n\nsection of the board meeting regarding the termination of her probationary contract.\n\n        8.     At the March 26, 2009 board meeting the School Board voted unanimously to\n\nterminate Terrell's probationary contract.\n\n        9.     In 2007 PISD purchased a computer program called Boardbook which PISD used\n\nto create its school board meeting notices and to post these notices on its district website (the\n\n\"internet postings\"). PISD has used Boardbook for this purpose continuously since 2007 and has\n\npaid for the Boardbook program each year since 2007.\n\n        10.    Karen Linder, a PISD employee, was tasked with using the Boardbook program to\n\ncreate each school board meeting notice and to then place a copy of the notice on the district\n\nwebsite in conformance with the requirements of Section 551.056 of the Texas Government\n\nCode for internet postings.\n\n\n\n\n                                               327\n\f328\n\n\n\n\n       11.    Once Ms. Linder created the notice in Boardbook she then utilized the Boardbook\n\nprogram to \"release\" the notice to the public for viewing. The public was able to review the\n\nnotice on the district website through a hyperlink on the website which directed the public to\n\nBoardbook where the notice had been created and was available for viewing. This was the\n\nmanner in which internet postings were accomplished from the time PISD purchased the\n\nBoardbook program.\n\n       12.    In January of 2009 PISD transitioned its website to a new format. The new\n\nwebsite was built and maintained by an outside independent third party contractor hired by PISD\n\nfor this purpose. PISD instructed the contractor to make sure the new website had all of the same\n\nhyperlinks as the old website, including the hyperlink to Boardbook which allowed the public to\n\nview the school board meeting notices on the internet. The contractor failed to carry the\n\nBoardbook hyperlink from the old website to the new one and as a result the school board\n\nmeeting notices which formerly appeared on the internet through the PISD website were\n\nunavailable from the time the website switch occurred.in January 2009 through May 19, 2009\n\nwhich was the date that PISD was informed of the problem.\n\n       13.     The Boardbook school board meeting notices for PISD which were created by\n\nKaren Linder using the Boardbook program were available for viewing by the public from\n\nJanuary 2009 through May 19, 2009 on the Boardbook website even though they were not on\n\navailable on the PISD website during this time.\n\n       14.     Karen Linder and PISD were unaware that the Boardbook hyperlink was no\n\nlonger available on the PISD website as they had directed the contractor to carry forward to the\n\nnew website all such hyperlinks. Karen Linder continued to create the school board meeting\n\n\n\n\n                                              328\n\f329\n\n\n\n\nnotices in Boardbook and \"releasing\" them to the public when completed, all the while thinking\n\nthey were still available on the website through the Boardbook hyperlink on the website.\n\n        15.    The actions of Karen Linder and PISD in attempting to post the internet notices\n\nrequired by Section 551.056 of the Texas Government Code from January 2009 through May 19,\n\n2009 were all in good faith and any failure to comply with the statute was due to a technical\n\nproblem beyond the control ofPISD.\n\n        16.    PISD was unaware that that the Boardbook hyperlink was not carried over to the\n\nnew website and the independent contractor hired by PISD for the website conversion was at\n\nfault for failing to carry over the hyperlink.\n\n        17.    Plaintiffs' claims in this suit included a claim und\\er Section 551.142(a) of the\n\nTexas Government Code.\n\n        18.    PISD was the substantially prevailing party at trial in regards to any claims under\n\nChapter 551 of the Texas Government Code and in regards to any claims brought under Section\n\n551.142(a).\n                                                                       '\n        19.    PISD is entitled to an award of litigation costs and reasonable attorney fees\n\nincurred in defending the claims of Plaintiffs which were brought in bad faith.\n\n        20.    In awarding $30,000.00 in attorney fees the Court tpok judicial notice of the file\n\nand has considered that the actions of the Plaintiffs in bringing this suit were in bad faith and that\n\nthe actions of PISD in defending Plaintiffs claims were reasonable under the law and in\n\nparticular under Chapter 551 of the Texas Government Code. This award of attorney fees and\n\ncosts is both reasonable and just considering the time involved. in defending this suit, the\n                                                                       ~\n\nvoluminous number of pleadings and motions filed by Plaintiffs, boUt in the District Court and in\n\n\n\n\n                                                 329\n\f                                                                          (,---\"\"\n\n330\n\n\n\n\nthe Appellate Court, and in consideration of the bad faith exercised by Plaintiffs in bringing this\n\naction.\n\n          21.       Plaintiffs first filed their suit against PISD on May 29, 2009.\n\n          22.       PISD complied with all provisions of Chapter 551 of the Texas Government Code\n\nconcerning the posting of notice of PISD's school board meetings and in particular the meeting\n\nof March 26, 2009 which were the subject of trial.\n\n                                          B. Conclusions of Law\n\n          1.        PISD complied with all provisions of Chapter 551 of the Texas Government Code\n\nconcerning the posting of notice of PISD's school board meetings, both physical posting and\n\ninternet posting, and in particular the meeting of March 26, 2009 which were the subject of trial.\n\n               2.       Any failure on the part of PISD to post an internet notice of an upcoming\n\nschool board meeting on its website from January 2009 through May 19, 2009 as required by\n\nSection 551.056 of the Texas Government Code was due to a technical problem beyond the\n\ncontrol of PISD and PISD exercised good faith efforts to comply with the requirements of\n\nChapter 551 concerning internet posting notices.\n\n          3.        PISD was the substantially prevailing party at trial in the Section 551.142(a)\n\naction brought by Plaintiffs under the Texas Government Code and is entitled to an award of\n\nlitigation costs and reasonable attorney fees incurred in defending the claims of Plaintiffs which\n\nwere brought in bad faith.\n\n          4.        The award of $30,000.00 in attorney fees is both reasonable and just taking into\n\nconsideration the file, the time involved in defending this suit, the voluminous number of\n\npleadings and motions filed by Plaintiffs, both in the District Court and in the Appellate Court,\n\nand in consideration of the bad faith exercised by Plaintiffs in bringing this action.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     330\n\n\n                                                       -------------                  --   ---\n\f, ..   ..\n       331\n\n\n\n\n             SIGNED ON THIS   ~y OF NOVEMBER, 2013.\n\n\n\n\n                                      331\n\f      Appendix 22\nBoardBook Draft Agreement (PX31)\n\f•\n                                                                                                                                         0\n                                                                                                                                        :::0\n                                                                                                                                        J>.\n                                                                                                                                        --<\n~         Texas Association of School Boards                                                                                           C)\nlliliJ    BoardBook                                                                                                                   0\n                                                                                                                                      c:       '1\n          P.O.

Rebecca Terrell and Chandrashekhar Thanedar (appellants, plaintiffs,\n\nor Terrell) sued Pampa Independent School District (PISD) to void PISD’s actions\n\ntaken in violation of Sections 551.041, 551.043, 551.045, 551.051, 551.056(b) and\n\n(d), 551.074, and 551.101 for 22 Meetings from August 13, 2008 to May 19, 2009\n\nand to seek mandamus, declaratory relief, and permanent injunction under Sec.\n\n551.142(a) among other relief against PISD. (Appendices 5 and 6).1, 2\n\n       Trial Court: 223rd District Court, Gray County, Texas, Hon. Abe Lopez,\n\nassigned Judge. Previously presided by Judges Lee Waters and Phil Vanderpool.\n\n       Course of Proceedings: A summary judgment granted to PISD by Judge Lee\n\nWaters on 5/14/2010 was reversed by this Court and the case was remanded to trial\n\ncourt. Appendix19. Judge Waters retired during the pendency of the appeal.\n\n1\n  Clerk’s record and reporter’s record for this the second appeal are denoted as “CR” and “RR”\nrespectively, followed by page number(s). Supplemental clerk and reporter records are identified\nby the order in which they were filed.\n\nPlaintiffs’ exhibits for final trial on 10/9/2013 are denoted as “PX” followed by the exhibit\nnumber. The final trial transcript found in reporter’s record volume 2 filed on 3/24/14 is referred\nto as “Trial Transcript” followed by page numbers.\n\nPlease note trial exhibit PX1 (original) was filed on 10/8/14 along with supplemental reporter’s\nrecord. PX13 and PX15 were filed by the reporter on 10/9/14.\n2\n  The clerk’s record on appeal from the First Appeal (007-10-00212-CV) is already on file with\nthe Court and is denoted by “CR” followed by notation First Appeal. Plaintiffs request that the\nclerk’s record on file in First Appeal be considered in this appeal.\n\n\n                                                ix\n\f      The new presiding judge of the 223rd court Judge Phil Vanderpool recused\n\nhimself upon motion to recuse filed by appellants on September 26, 2012. Retired\n\nJudge Abe Lopez was assigned to the case on October 15, 2012. A trial was\n\nconducted in this case on October 9, 2013 on the issue of PISD’s violation of\n\nTOMA §551.056(b) only with respect to 11 meetings from January 15, 2009 to\n\nMay 19, 2009, but not for 11 meetings from 8/2008 to 12/2008. Judge Lopez\n\nrefused to conduct a trial on all other causes of action arising out of PISD’s distinct\n\nviolations of TOMA sections 551.041, 551.043, 551.045, 551.051, 551.074, and\n\n551.101 in this case. PISD’s counsel refused to testify or provide evidence of\n\nattorney fees at the trial. The final judgment for PISD was signed by Judge Lopez\n\non October 25, 2013 and he awarded PISD $30,000 in attorney fees and costs by\n\nreviewing the file. See Appendix20. Judge Lopez made Findings of Fact (FOF)\n\nand Conclusions of Law (COL) upon request by appellants. Appendix21.\n\nAppellants timely filed motion for new trial (Appendix1), motion to modify\n\njudgment (Appendix2), motion for reconsideration(Appendix3), and request for\n\namended FOF and COL (Appendix4). Trial court took no action on them. On\n\nSeptember 26, 2014, Judge Lopez held a hearing on lost or destroyed trial exhibits\n\nas ordered by the appeals court.\n\n      Proceedings in the Court of Appeals: Appellants filed their first appeal on\n\nMay 24, 2010 in the Seventh Court of Appeals, Amarillo. Trial court’s judgment\n\n\n\n                                          x\n\fwas reversed and remanded. Appendix19. A mandamus petition by appellants for\n\npost remand discovery and hearing on motions was denied by this Court in\n\nSeptember 2013.\n\n      On January 17, 2014, appellants filed their second appeal in this case.\n\nAppellants filed an amended notice of appeal in this case. Appendix18. On July\n\n18, 2014, the Court abated the appeal and remanded the case to determine whether\n\ncertain trial exhibits were lost or destroyed and to determine the fault for the\n\ndestruction or loss. Trial court filed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\n\nstating the exhibits were lost or destroyed, by no fault of appellants. See 2nd\n\nsupplemental clerk’s record.    Duplicates of lost or destroyed exhibits were filed\n\nwith the appeals court by visiting court reporter in October 2014.\n\n      Proceedings before 9th Administrative Judicial Region: Appellants filed a\n\nmotion to disqualify and recuse Judge Abe Lopez from sitting in the hearing\n\nordered by the court of appeals, which was denied by the 9th regional\n\nadministrative Judge Kelly Moore in September 2014.\n\n\n\n\n                                         xi\n\f              STATEMENT REGARDING ORAL ARGUMENT\n\n      This is the second appeal in this case in the last 6 years. This case has been\n\nstrung along for years of intentional inaction and obstruction. Appellants believe\n\noral argument would be of benefit to the Court at this stage to clarify these facts\n\nand legal arguments.\n\n      An oral argument in the first appeal in this case was denied. An oral\n\nargument then, would have made it abundantly clear to the Court that PISD neither\n\nhad the intention, evidence, nor argument concerning whether “printing” notices\n\nchanged the electronic properties of the PDF documents in question – a matter on\n\nwhich this court remanded the case.\n\n      As our brief makes clear, this case involves several matters of first\n\nimpression in the history of TOMA jurisprudence e.g. document properties of\n\nwebsite internet notices concerning §551.056(b) and issues concerning\n\n§551.056(d). Appellants’ pro se status should not be a hindrance.\n\n\n\n\n                                        xii\n\f                              ISSUES PRESENTED\n\n1.   Trial court’s failure to hold trial on seven distinct causes of action violates\n     TOMA and appellants’ absolute constitutional rights.\n\n2.   TOMA requires Exact and Literal compliance with its provisions;\n     Further, good faith defense under §551.056(d) requires clear and convincing\n     standard.\n\n3.   Trial court erred in refusing to void PISD’s actions and meetings in violation\n     of TOMA. Terrell is entitled to voidance of her termination action done in\n     3/26/2009 meeting and entitled to mandamus ordering reinstatement of\n     Terrell to her previous position as a teacher and to back wages and benefits\n\n4.   All PISD actions taken in meetings held in violation of TOMA’s notice\n     provisions are voidable and plaintiffs are entitled to their voidance. Plaintiffs\n     are entitled to judgment in their favor on all causes of action.\n\n5.   Plaintiffs have proven their good faith under TOMA §551.142.\n\n6.   Trial court erred in ruling that front door is bulletin board within the\n     meaning of §551.051 under TOMA. PISD’s posting of board meeting\n     notices on the front door violates TOMA.\n\n7.   Trial court erred in refusing to void PISD’s actions for failure to comply for 9\n     months with internet posting requirement of §551.056(b).\n\n8.   Trial court erred in refusing to deny PISD’s claim of “Good Faith” exception\n     under §551.056(d) for 11 Meetings for five months in 2009. PISD’s good\n     faith claim is a fraud on citizens and courts requiring sanctions.\n\n9.   PISD’s meeting notices with incomplete description of Place violate notice\n     provisions of TOMA and such meetings and actions therein must be voided.\n\n10. §551.045(d) requires a designated or authorized person to sign and post board\n    meeting notices; alternatively, this violation is a disputed material fact.\n\n11. Trial court erroneously refused to void Terrell’s termination action in 3/26/09\n    Board meeting in violation of TOMA; whether or not Terrell had individual\n    notice and her attendance at the meeting are irrelevant.\n\n                                         xiii\n\f12. The trial court erred in denying requested relief when undisputed evidence\n    shows PISD illegally closed the 3/26/2009 meeting to public and violated\n    §551.074(b) by deliberating Terrell’s employment contract outside of\n    meeting.\n\n13. Trial court erred in denying plaintiffs’ second motion for summary judgment,\n    MSJ, and motions for new trial or grant continuance, to modify judgment, for\n    reconsideration, and denying request for amended and additional findings of\n    fact and conclusions of law. Further, trial court erred when it denied\n    hearing on the newly discovered evidence. Trial court erred when it denied\n    post-remand discovery and denied plaintiffs’ certain trial exhibits, such denial\n    causing rendition of incorrect judgment.\n\n14. Terrell is the substantially prevailing party and should be awarded litigation\n    costs, fees, and special damages.\n\n15. This Court should award Terrell special damages and impose sanctions on\n    PISD due to PISD’s systematic and conscious violations of TOMA and to\n    ensure voluntary and willing compliance with TOMA by government bodies.\n\n16. Award of attorney fees of $30,000 to PISD is invalid and unreasonable,\n    further PISD forfeited and waived attorney fees.\n\n17. Assigned trial judge Lopez was disqualified from conducting trial in this case.\n\n18. Plaintiffs are interested persons under TOMA\n\n19. Evidence concerning SchoolCenter, BoardBook, and Lee Carter must be\n    excluded, or continuance granted. Further, bare assertions, hearsay and\n    irrelevant evidence must be barred. Trial court erred in considering such\n    evidence.\n\n20. PISD’s missing link issue is irrelevant because PISD untimely created\n    internet notices in May 2009; and copying or transferring the link onto new\n    website was not a technical problem and was not beyond the control of PISD\n    for 5 months\n\n21. Plaintiffs are entitled to summary judgment on 7 distinct causes of action,\n    and declaratory relief under section 551.142(a).\n\n                                        xiv\n\fTO THE HONORABLE SEVENTH COURT OF APPEALS:\n\n      This appeal raises important issues for this Court and Texas citizens. This\n\nCourt will decide whether Texas Open Meetings Act still is worth the exact and\n\nliteral compliance standard citizens and taxpayers of Texas demanded a long time\n\nago. Citizens will decide whether they should and can rely on TOMA and can take\n\nits promise of sunshine law seriously and will courts even rule on the violations.\n\nWill citizens be heard against government bodies and their lawyers? Texas Open\n\nMeetings Act may yet prove to be a sunshine law.\n\n                           I. STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n      The following facts are admitted, undisputed, or supported by record.\n\n      Undisputed facts concerning untimely “created dates” of PISD’s website\ninternet notices for 22 Meetings\n\n      1.   PISD did not contest at trial that the internet notices of 22 Board\n\nmeetings beginning August 13, 2008 to January 2009 (22 Meetings) were untimely\n\ncreated in May 2009 and were posted on PISD’s internet website on May 19, 2009.\n\nThis Court acknowledged the untimely creation of TOMA notices in its opinion in\n\nthe First Appeal. Appendices 7, 19, 14; PX1.\n\n      2. PISD did not present timely created website internet notices for 22\n\nMeetings with document properties that showed that the website internet notices\n\nwere created 72 hours before the start of each of the 22 Meetings in question as\n\nrequired by §551.056(b).\n                                        1\n\f       3.     PISD’s evidence of “missing link” to website notices is irrelevant\n\nbecause PISD created website internet notices untimely after said meetings had\n\nalready taken place. Appendix7, PX1. Appendix19-Opinion Pgs.5-6.\n\n       4. Appellants reported violations of §551.056(b) to PISD on May 15, 2009.\n\nPISD admitted plaintiffs’ report caused the problem to be corrected. Appendix11-\n\nInterrogatory 7.\n\n       5. PISD represented to this Court that printing said notices “changed” the\n\ncreated dates of notices. This caused this Court to remand the case. Appendix 19.\n\nPISD did not produce evidence at trial that the untimely “created” dates of the PDF\n\nnotices of meetings in question were the dates when “PISD printed the notices for\n\ndelivery to plaintiffs.” Appendix19. Linder denied having any knowledge, stating\n\nit was just speculation. Transcript pg.199. PISD did not present evidence at the\n\ntrial showing that printing internet notices for delivery to plaintiffs caused created\n\ndates of notices to change. No internet notices were ever printed for delivery to\n\nplaintiffs.\n\n       Undisputed facts about BoardBook:\n\n       6.     BoardBook is not a computer program that can be owned. Yearly\n\nsubscription fee or renewal license fee must be paid every year for using its\n\nsubscription services. If renewal fees are not paid every year, use of BoardBook is\n\nterminated. Appendix22. PISD did not purchase a BoardBook program in 2007 or\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\fat any other time or made any license fee payment to BoardBook. PISD does not\n\nhave a purchase order for or contract with, or paid any consideration to BoardBook\n\nfor its service from 8/13/2008 to 5/19/2009. PISD did not supplement, amend\n\nresponses to written discovery concerning purchase orders and payments to\n\nBoardBook.    Appendices8-11.     Further PISD refused and failed to provide\n\ndocuments concerning payments to BoardBook to the Texas Attorney General\n\nunder a Texas Public Information Act, Gov’t Code Ch.552 Request by plaintiffs.\n\nCR388 (First Appeal).\n\n      7.   PISD did not have BoardBook service from 8/13/2008 to 5/19/2009.\n\nPISD did not execute contract or pay license fees or renewal fees to BoardBook for\n\n1/2009 to 5/19/2009. Appendix22. PISD admits documents evidencing payment to\n\nBoardBook do not exist. Appendix11 (PISD’s Response to Request for\n\nProduction15). The draft subscription agreement with BoardBook for 2007 is not\n\nsigned by BoardBook. Appendix22. Further it is undisputed that PISD does not\n\nclaim good faith exception for any period in 2007 or 2008. BoardBook program\n\ndoes not post notices of meetings on PISD’s website for public viewing.\n\nAppendix10-Interrogatory18.\n\n      8. PISD is solely responsible for notices appearing or not appearing on\n\nBoardBook or compliance with TOMA. Appendix22. Notices of meetings are\n\nposted on BoardBook website in PDF (Adobe) format. BoardBook terminates\n\n\n\n                                        3\n\fagreement in 30 days if money is not received when due. BoardBook does not\n\nstore or archive notices 30 days after termination. Appendix22.\n\n      9. Jameson was aware of the link to notices not being on the new website.\n\nAppendix16. Jameson did not think link to BoardBook was necessary and needed\n\nto go on the new website. In a maintenance update the link was dropped by\n\nJameson on 1/15/2009. Appendix11-Interrogatory5. On 5/19/2009, Jameson added\n\nthe link to notices when she found out that the link to notices was required.\n\nAppendix16.    PISD’s new website was up and running during 1/15/2009 to\n\n5/19/2009. Appendix 16.\n\n      10. PISD’s internet notices did not appear on BoardBook’s website without\n\na link to them on PISD website. PISD’s notices were not available for public\n\nviewing on Yahoo or Google search.\n\n      11. PISD did not timely post notices of meetings on its own website for 22\n\nMeetings.\n\n      12.   Linder did not post copies of internet notices of meetings on PISD’s\n\nwebsite. BoardBook did not and does not place or post meeting notices on PISD’s\n\nwebsite at any time. PISD admits that its internet notices were not posted on its or\n\nBoardBook’s website for 11 meetings from 1/15/2009 to 5/19/2009 in violation of\n\n§551.056(b). Appendix11-Interrogatories5,7.\n\n\n\n\n                                         4\n\f      13. PISD did not know or provide the exact dates when its old website was\n\ndiscontinued and the new website went live and when the link to BoardBook was\n\ndiscontinued. BoardBook is an agent of PISD (Appendix22).\n\n      14.    Linder had no training, education, or expertise in technology or\n\nsoftware. PISD presented no exhibits, documentary evidence, or witnesses from\n\nBoardBook or SchoolCenter at trial.\n\n      Undisputed facts about Third Party Contractor SchoolCenter:\n\n      15. SchoolCenter worked for PISD and is PISD’s agent. No person from\n\nSchoolCenter testified concerning the claim that SchoolCenter failed to transfer\n\nlink, services assigned to and performed by SchoolCenter, and the dates of service.\n\nPISD did not present a contract, proof of payment for service, vouchers, purchase\n\norders, consideration for contract, or any documentary evidence at trial concerning\n\nSchoolCenter that defines the services it provided for PISD. SchoolCenter is a\n\nwebhosting service and not a webmaster for PISD.\n\n      16.    PISD did not disclose the identity of SchoolCenter and its role in\n\nresponse to written discovery from plaintiffs and further did not timely\n\nsupplement, amend, or correct its response to written discovery. SchoolCenter’s\n\nidentity and role was not disclosed until the trial in this case. In the First Appeal in\n\nthis case, PISD did not disclose to the 7th Court of Appeals the existence, identity,\n\nand central role of SchoolCenter in this lawsuit.\n\n\n\n                                           5\n\f      17. SchoolCenter’s failure to transfer link did not force or require PISD to\n\ncreate untimely internet notices in BoardBook weeks and months after the 22\n\nmeetings took place as noted by this Court. Appendix19. SchoolCenter had no\n\nrole in PISD’s creation of new untimely internet notices in the month of May 2009\n\nfor 22 meetings which were posted on 5/19/2009. See Appendices 7, 14; PX1.\n\n      18.    PISD and Jameson dropped the hyperlink to internet notices on\n\nBoardBook and did not ask SchoolCenter to establish it. Jameson admitted that the\n\nlink was not there on the old website at the time it was being converted to a new\n\nwebsite. Transcript pg.144. She did not think the link was necessary on the new\n\nwebsite. Appendix16. Transcript pg.144. SchoolCenter had direct access to PISD’s\n\nold website and transferred links that were on the old website onto the new\n\nwebsite.    Transcript pg.135.   Jameson established the link to BoardBook on\n\n5/19/2009. Appendix16. PISD untimely created notices for the 22 meetings in\n\nMay 2009. Appendix19; PX1. PISD did not have a purchase order, did not have a\n\ncontract with or make any payment to SchoolCenter for its service to build a new\n\nformat or transition hyperlinks to a new website. Hyperlinked notices did not exist\n\non old website, and SchoolCenter was not responsible for transferring the link to\n\nBoardBook. SchoolCenter’s role was irrelevant to PISD’s good faith defense.\n\n      19. Jameson has no expertise in website operations. Transcript pages 132.\n\nLee Carter operated PISD’s website (Transcript page 116, 132) through January\n\n\n\n                                        6\n\f2009 when he was PISD’s webmaster using Adobe Go Live software. Appendix 1.\n\nPISD admitted that the internet notice of 1/15/2009 board meeting did not appear\n\non its or BoardBook’s website for public viewing. The link to website notices was\n\ndropped from PISD’s website before 1/15/2009 board meeting. PISD claims good\n\nfaith defense for 11 meetings from 1/2009 to 5/19/2009. Appendix11-\n\nInterrogatories 5, 7.\n\n      20.    Linder did not communicate, direct, interact with, nor manage\n\nSchoolCenter concerning link to notices. Linder did not know the identity of\n\nSchoolCenter and did not have personal knowledge of its role in this lawsuit.\n\nTranscript page 191.\n\n      21. It is undisputed that PISD did not verify that its internet notices actually\n\nappeared for 72 hours before each of the 22 Meetings on its website directly or\n\nthrough a link. Transcript 176-178. PISD further failed to verify whether or not\n\nthe link to internet notices was in fact transferred to its new website for 11\n\nmeetings for 5 months from 1/15/2009 to 5/19/2009. Transcript 176-178.\n\n      22.    To put a link to notices on the website is not difficult. Transcript\n\npg.150. Failure to verify whether such link was removed and not reestablished is\n\nnot difficult and is not a technical problem. Transcript Page150. Further,\n\nverification that the link to internet notices actually was transferred onto PISD’s\n\n\n\n\n                                          7\n\fnew website is not beyond the control of PISD for 5 months from 1/15/2009 to\n\n5/19/2009. PISD does not meet requirements of §551.056(d).\n\n      23. PISD did not verify even once whether the internet notices of meetings\n\nwere actually appearing and visible to public for viewing on its website for 11\n\nmeetings in question from 1/15/2009 to May 19, 2009. Transcript pg.178. PISD’s\n\nwebsite was up and running properly during entirety of this time. No\n\ncommunication occurred between Jameson and Linder concerning TOMA notices\n\nof board meetings appearing on its website from January 2009 until after Thanedar\n\ninformed Linder on 5/15/2009 that internet notices did not appear on PISD’s\n\nwebsite. Appendix11-Interrogatory7; Appendix16.\n\n      24.    PISD admits that internet website notices required under TOMA\n\n§551.056(b) did not “appear” in the prescribed time of 72 hours on PISD’s website\n\nfor 11 meetings from 1/15/2009 to 5/19/2009. Appendices 8, 11 (Interrogatory7).\n\n      25. The internet notice that PISD posted on its website for 3/26/2009 board\n\nmeeting in which Terrell’s termination action took place was untimely created on\n\nMay 8, 2009 and untimely posted to PISD’s website on 5/19/2009. Appendix 14.\n\nAt trial, PISD did not present an internet website notice that was timely created 72\n\nhours before the 3/26/2009 board meeting.\n\n\n\n\n                                         8\n\f      26. PISD presented no evidence at trial 1) when a “link” to internet notices\n\nactually existed on its website and the date on which it was dropped, and that 2)\n\nSchoolCenter was responsible for transferring said link to a new website.\n\n      27.    PISD managed and maintained its website on and before 1/15/2009.\n\nPISD managed its website 72 hours before the 1/15/2009 board meeting. The\n\ninternet notice for 1/15/2009 meeting did not appear on PISD’s website because\n\nPISD and Jameson dropped the link in a maintenance update.            Appendix11-\n\nInterrogatory5,7. There was no link on the old PISD website for SchoolCenter to\n\ntransfer to the new website. SchoolCenter was not involved in dropping the link.\n\nPISD’s new website went live in February 2009.\n\nFacts regarding plaintiffs’ causes of action:\n\n      28.    Terrell sued PISD on 5/29/2009 on eight distinct causes of action\n\narising out of PISD’s violations of TOMA and seeks to void her termination and\n\nfor reinstatement and back wages among other relief. Appendices5,6. PISD’s first\n\namended answer had no certificate of service and was not served on plaintiffs.\n\nCR282-284.\n\n      29. Trial Judge Lopez did not try plaintiffs’ distinct claims under sections\n\n551.041, 551.043, 551.051, 551.045(d), 551.74(b), 551.101, 551.142(a) (“7\n\nCauses”).    Further, Judge Lopez did not rule on said claims, nor ruled on\n\ndeclaratory, mandamus, or injunctive relief, and did not make Findings of Fact and\n\n\n\n                                         9\n\fConclusions of Law on 7 Causes. Appendix21. Physical posting of notices for\n\n3/26/2009 meeting and other 21 meetings was not the subject of trial.     PISD did\n\nnot comply with any of Gov’t Code Chapter 551’s notice provisions for 22 board\n\nmeetings in question.     PISD was not the substantially prevailing party under\n\nTOMA.\n\n      30. Plaintiffs did not announce ready and requested continuance of the trial\n\ndate due to the death of Thanedar’s mother. Transcript pg.6. Trial court failed to\n\nrule on admissibility of PX1, and denied PX13 (Audio Tapes-CDs), PX12, PX14,\n\nPX19, PX21, and PX25. Trial court did not provide a reasonable notice or 45-day\n\nnotice (TRCP 245) for the trial in this case on remand from the appeals court.\n\nPlaintiffs’ filings were not voluminous either in trial court or appeals court.\n\nFurther they were neither unreasonable nor improper. PISD did not respond to\n\nplaintiffs’ filings and no attorney fees were incurred by PISD on them. Trial court\n\nheld no hearings on plaintiffs’ motions or filings.\n\nUndisputed facts in plaintiffs’ claim under §551.051 (Bulletin Board)\n\n      31. PISD admits that it posted board meeting notices on the front door of its\n\nadministrative building for the time period in question from 8/13/2008 to\n\n5/19/2009 (22 Meetings). Public citizens were required to stand outside the central\n\noffice building to read the public meeting notices. PISD does not dispute that there\n\nwas an unused glass enclosed bulletin board inside its administrative office\n\n\n\n                                          10\n\fbuilding in the lobby area during 22 Meetings and that PISD relocated a glass\n\nenclosed bulletin board outside its administrative office building on 6/5/2009.\n\nAppendix9 (Admissions 5,7,8).\n\nUndisputed facts in plaintiffs’ claim under §551.041 (Place)\n\n      32. PISD admits that for both paper and internet notices it did not specify\n\nor include the name of the city. Appendix9 (Admission15). PISD’s notices merely\n\nstate “Pampa High School” or “Pampa Junior High School” without the address.\n\nSee CR70-71, CR75, CR89-90, CR129-130, CR147-148, CR156, CR167-168,\n\nCR170 (First Appeal).    PISD service boundaries defined by Texas Education\n\nAgency cover portions of Gray and Roberts Counties.\n\nUndisputed facts in plaintiffs’ claim under §551.043 (72 Hours)\n\n      33. The physical notice for 3/26/2009 meeting was not posted for 72 hours\n\nin a bulletin board inside the central administrative office.   CR60-66(Second\n\nAppeal).\n\n      The physical notice for 5/19/2009 meeting was not posted for 72 hours in a\n\nbulletin board. CR60-66(Second Appeal). Linder confirmed to plaintiff Thanedar\n\nthat there was an error in posting this notice because the meeting date changed to\n\n5/19/2009 and that Linder posted a corrected notice for a board meeting on 5/19/09\n\non the front door on 5/18/2009 because of the change. CR60-66(Second Appeal).\n\nUndisputed facts in plaintiffs’ claim under §551.101 (closed meeting)\n\n\n\n                                       11\n\f      34.   The presiding officer of the Board did not identify the section or\n\nsections under TOMA that authorized closing of the 3/26/2009 board meeting to\n\npublic. See PX14; PX13 (Audio CDs); Appendix9(Admission14).\n\nUndisputed facts in plaintiffs’ claim under §551.074(b) (deliberations)\n\n      35.   The audio recording of the closed meeting on 3/26/2009 shows\n\ndiscussion among Superintendent Haenisch and Board members on Terrell’s\n\ntermination. Terrell had specifically requested the action be deliberated in open\n\nmeeting per §551.074(b). PX13 (Audio CDs)(Tape 2 at Counter 43:45).\n\nUndisputed facts in plaintiffs’ claim under §551.045(d) (designated person)\n\n      36. PISD’s Board did not designate or authorize Karen Linder to sign\n\nmeeting notices or post board meeting notices on the Board’s behalf. CR609,\n\nCR832; CR821-823 (First Appeal). Appendix10 (Req. for Production 28). Linder\n\nsigned and posted board meeting notices without authorization from the Board of\n\nTrustees. Board retained authority with respect to calling, signing, and posting\n\nnotices of board meetings. CR821-823; CR832; CR834-836(FirstAppeal).\n\nUndisputed facts about attorney fees\n\n      37. PISD counsel refused and failed to testify at trial on PISD’s attorney\n\nfees concerning the amount and its reasonableness.         PISD made no valid\n\napplication for attorney fees under §551.142(b) at trial. Trial court asked PISD’s\n\nattorney Mr. Arnold whether he wanted to testify and present evidence concerning\n\n\n\n                                       12\n\fPISD’s request for attorney fees. PISD’s counsel refused to do so, instead asked\n\ntrial Judge Lopez to take notice of the file. Transcript page 238. PISD did not\n\npresent evidence concerning existence of PISD’s attorney fees, hours, hourly rate,\n\ntasks performed and by whom, difficulty level, and reasonableness of court’s\n\naward of attorney fees of $30,000.\n\nUndisputed facts about Bad Faith\n\n      38. At trial, PISD presented no evidence of plaintiffs’ bad faith in bringing\n\nthe lawsuit. PISD’s actions did not have reasonable basis under TOMA. TOMA\n\nrequires reasonable attorney fees to be proven at trial, and does not permit judicial\n\nnotice of file. PISD did not present factual evidence of voluminous pleadings and\n\nmotions in district court or appellate court or time spent by PISD defending against\n\nthem or the suit. Appellants were meritorious and prevailed in the first appeal with\n\nSeventh COA awarding costs to appellants. Appendix19. Judge Lopez does not\n\nhave power to grant appellate attorney fees.\n\nUndisputed facts about Plaintiffs’ Good Faith\n\n      39. Plaintiffs presented evidence of their good faith at trial. PISD admits\n\nthat plaintiffs’ report to PISD of non-appearance of website notices was the sole\n\nreason why PISD fixed its non-compliance with §551.056(b) for 11 meetings after\n\n5 month long of non-compliance. Appendix11-Interrogatory7.\n\n\n\n\n                                         13\n\fPlaintiffs’ employment, Standing, Back-Wages\n\n      40. Appellants are citizens and taxpayers of Texas for more than 15 years\n\n(4 years in Pampa beginning 2008), and are interested persons under TOMA and\n\npay sales taxes and other taxes that fund PISD and other school districts in Texas.\n\nPX15, PX21; Appendices5,6. TOMA does not require plaintiffs to reside within\n\nPISD’s boundaries. PISD, a school district created by the State of Texas, is a\n\ngovernment body subject to TOMA. Terrell was a first year beginning teacher at\n\nPampa High School and taught U.S. History, World History, and World\n\nGeography. Terrell’s probationary contract (PX6) does not automatically expire\n\nby its own terms under the Education Code. The Education Code §21.103 requires\n\nthat a probationary contract must be terminated in 45 days before the last day of\n\ninstruction or the contract automatically renews. Terrell’s probationary contract\n\nwas terminated by PISD in a Board meeting on 3/26/2009. Terrell was not given\n\nand did not have actual notice of termination of contract, nor was Terrell’s contract\n\nplaced on the notice/agenda of the 3/26/2009 meeting.          The legal notice of\n\n3/26/2009 board meeting required under TOMA was not in a bulletin board or on a\n\nfront door for 72 hours prior to said meeting. Terrell’s termination was not placed\n\non the agenda of the meeting.\n\n\n\n\n                                         14\n\f41.   Document properties of a PDF document show various aspects of the\n\nelectronic document viz. when it was created (created date), when it was last\n\nmodified (modified date). Plaintiff Thanedar testified as an expert witness at trial\n\nin this case. Transcript pgs.75-86.\n\n                          II. SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\n      The trial on 10/9/2013 made mockery of Texas Open Meetings Act\n\n(TOMA).      Plaintiffs’ seven distinct causes of action under TOMA sections\n\n551.041, 551.043, 551.051, 551.45(d), 551.74(b), 551.101 and 551.142(a) were not\n\ntried or ruled on. Trial judge Abe Lopez blamed this Court for it. Plaintiffs’ are\n\nabsolutely entitled under law and Texas and U.S. Constitutions to declaratory\n\nrulings, mandamus, and injunctive relief on the above claims.      Judge Lopez was\n\ndisqualified to hold trial. PISD produced no legal evidence concerning its claim of\n\ngood faith under §551.056(d). Further forgetting to transfer or verifying transfer of\n\na link is not a technical problem and never beyond the control of PISD, a\n\ngovernment body, especially over 5 months.            PISD lied to this Court about\n\n“created dates” of internet notices and the “link.”\n\n      PISD is solely responsible for compliance with TOMA.             Any outside\n\nvendors are agents of PISD. PISD showed intentional ignorance concerning the\n\nuntimely internet notices posted after 5 months, got caught, and made things up.\n\nPISD’s good faith claim is a fraud on Texas citizens and courts. Attorney fee\n\n\n\n                                          15\n\faward to PISD is unlawful and unreasonable. Each cause of action by plaintiffs is\n\ndispositive of the whole case requiring reversal of trial court’s judgment and\n\nentitling plaintiffs judgment in her favor. This Court should reverse trial court’s\n\njudgment and render judgment for plaintiffs and grant their prayer.\n\n                          III. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n      A case is “tried” when a court holds an evidentiary hearing on a cause of\n\naction upon conflicting evidence. Besing v. Moffitt, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2465205\"><a href=\"/opinion/2465205/besing-v-moffitt/\"><span class=\"volume\">882</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,81-82 (Tex.\n\nApp.-Amarillo,1994, no writ); Haddix, infra at 345. In cases tried without a jury,\n\nfindings of fact delineate facts that support the judgment and the legal reasoning\n\nunderlying the judgment. In such cases, findings of fact and conclusions of law are\n\nmandatory under TRCP Rule 296 and 297.\n\n      On appeal, findings of fact are reviewed for sufficiency of the evidence and\n\nconclusions of law are reviewed de novo. Haddix v. American Zurich Ins. Co., 253\n\nS.W.3d 339,345(Tex. App.—Eastland 2008, no pet.); IKB Indus. v. Pro-Line\n\nCorp.,</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2369521\"><a href=\"/opinion/2369521/ikb-industries-v-pro-line-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">938</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">440</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,442 (Tex. 1997).\n\n      A request for additional findings is similar to an objection. Vickery v.\n\nCommission for Lawyer Discipline, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2192358\"><a href=\"/opinion/2192358/vickery-v-commission-for-lawyer-discipline/\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">241</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 255-56 (Tex. App.—Houston\n\n[14th Dist.], pet. denied).    Thus a request for additional findings of fact has\n\nsignificance unrelated to the trial court actually filing additional findings of fact. A\n\nchallenge to the sufficiency of the evidence in a bench trial can be raised for the\n\n\n\n                                          16\n\ffirst time in appellant’s brief. There is no need to file a post-judgment motion\n\nraising it. TEX. R. APP. 33.1(d).\n\n      A no evidence point is sustained if the record discloses the following: (1)\n\nthere is complete absence of evidence of a vital fact; (2) the court is barred by rules\n\nof law or evidence from giving weight to the only evidence offered to prove a vital\n\nfact; (3) the evidence offered to prove a vital fact is no more than a scintilla of\n\nevidence; or (4) the evidence conclusively established the opposite of a vital fact.\n\nSee Hawkins v. Ehler, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1491322\"><a href=\"/opinion/1491322/hawkins-v-ehler/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">534</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 539 (Tex.

App.--Fort Worth 1998, no pet.).\n\n      An assertion that the evidence is \"insufficient\" to support a fact finding\n\nmeans that the evidence supporting the finding is so weak or the evidence to the\n\ncontrary is so overwhelming that the answer should be set aside and a new trial\n\nordered. Garza v. Alviar, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2400279\"><a href=\"/opinion/2400279/garza-v-alviar/\"><span class=\"volume\">395</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">821</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 823 (Tex.1965).\n\n      When reviewing a factual sufficiency challenge, the appellate court\n\nconsiders all the evidence and determines whether the evidence supporting a\n\nfinding is so weak as to be clearly wrong and unjust or whether the evidence is so\n\nagainst the great weight and preponderance of the evidence to be clearly wrong and\n\nmanifestly unjust. Dow Chem. Co. v. Francis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1560611\"><a href=\"/opinion/1560611/dow-chemical-co-v-francis/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">237</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 242 (Tex. 2001).\n\nAppellate court is required to consider all of the evidence in the case in making this\n\ndetermination.

Acker, Id.; City of San Antonio, Id.\n\n      Burden of Proof: Plain language of TOMA makes it clear that the burden\n\nof proof of “good faith” under §551.056(d) is on the government body and that it\n\nmust be “continuous” for each meeting. §551.056(d); §551.043 (b)(1) and (b)(3).\n\n                                 IV.

Judge Lopez had an independent duty to try and rule on\n\nsaid causes of action under TOMA and the Texas and U.S. Constitutions, but failed\n\nto do so. Plaintiffs’ absolute constitutional rights of due process in this matter\n\ncannot be denied or waived, and plaintiffs did not waive their constitutional rights.\n\nMarin v.

Violations of TOMA\nprovisions at Issue in this case:\n       §551.051: PISD violated §551.051 by failing to post notices of 22 Meetings in a\n        specifically designated place - Bulletin Board in its Central Administrative Office.\n       §551.056: PISD violated §551.056 by failing to concurrently post internet notices of 22\n        Meetings on its website for prescribed time and manner.\n       §551.043: PISD violated §551.043 by failing to post notices of 22 Meetings at a physical\n        location for prescribed time (72 hours) and manner.\n       §551.041: PISD violated §551.041 by failing to specify “place” in its notices of 22\n        Meetings.\n       §551.101 and §551.074(b): PISD violated §551.101 by failing to legally close the\n        3/26/09 Board meeting and violated §551.074(b) by deliberating on Terrell’s termination\n        in closed meeting.\n       §551.045(d): PISD violated §551.045(d) because PISD’s notices of 22 Meetings were\n        signed on behalf of the Board and posted by a person (Linder) not so designated nor\n        authorized by Board of Trustees.\n       §551.142(a): Declaratory, injunctive, and mandamus relief on all plaintiffs’ claims.\n\n\n                                                19\n\f      Further, plaintiffs filed timely objections and motions and brought trial\n\ncourt’s failure to try 7 Causes to its attention.

Appendices 1,2,3,4. Trial court was required under TRCP 166a to either\n\ngrant plaintiffs’ second summary judgment motion on said 7 Causes or try them\n\nand rule on each one of them.\n\n      The Court’s failure and refusal to try the 7 Causes violates plaintiffs’\n\nconstitutional rights under Texas Constitution Article 1 Sections 3, 13, 19, and 27,\n\n\n\n                                         20\n\fand the 14th Amendment to the U.

Appellants’ are absolutely entitled to trial on every single one\n\nof their 7 untried remaining causes of action under TOMA and have all of their\n\ncomplaints redressed and ruled on. Plaintiffs request that this Court uphold this\n\nright and vacate final judgment and grant new trial on all causes of action.\n\n2. Plaintiffs are entitled to Summary Judgment on 7 distinct causes of action\nand Declaratory Relief under §551.142(a)\n\n      Plaintiffs are entitled to declaratory, injunctive, mandamus relief under\n\nTOMA whether or not any other relief is granted and whether or not PISD's actions\n\nin violation of TOMA are voided.\n\nA. Plaintiffs are entitled to declaration that PISD violated TOMA §551.051.\n\n      PISD admits that it posted TOMA notices on the front door for 22 Meetings\n\nwhen there was an unused bulletin board inside the building. Statement of Fact\n\n(SOF) 31. §551.051 mandates the location for notices. Here it is clear common\n\nsense that “front door” is not “bulletin board” inside the building under §551.051.\n\n      This violation is particularly offensive and vile as it forces the “undesirable”\n\ncitizens to stand outside the entrance of the building in rain, snow, cold, hot\n\nweather and in poor lighting conditions and humiliate themselves standing in the\n\n\n                                         21\n\fway of the incoming and outgoing traffic. This is abuse of citizens. These notices\n\non the front door cannot be read from inside and certainly are neither safe, nor\n\nconvenient, thus do not meet the requirements of “convenient,” “accessible”\n\n“inside the building” and “bulletin board” and under §551.051 under Exact and\n\nLiteral compliance standard. Forcing citizens to stand outside the building to read\n\nnotices is an unwelcome mat to poor citizens and minorities all around the “Carver\n\nCenter” to prevent them from entering the building. Only PISD would have the\n\ngall in this day and age to engage in this insensitive divisive tactic against its own\n\ntaxpaying citizens. Why should or would taxpayers stand outside the building that\n\nthey paid for to read TOMA notices? What is next - notices on windows, plants,\n\nand restroom doors? This Court should prevent this abomination of §551.051 and\n\ndeclare that notices on front doors violate §551.051.\n\nB. Plaintiffs are entitled to declaration that PISD violated §551.041 when\nPISD failed to give notice of \"place.\"\n\n      PISD admits the facts in SOF32. PISD failed to notify the reader of the\n\n“place” under §551.041 for 22 meetings under the exact and literal compliance\n\nstandard. PISD forced citizens to guess about “place” with details missing from\n\nnotice e.g. street address, location, and other details. Thus plaintiffs are entitled to\n\nthe declaration that PISD violated §551.041.\n\nC. Plaintiffs are entitled to declaration by the court that PISD violated\n§551.045(d).\n\n\n\n                                          22\n\f      PISD admits that Board never authorized nor designated Karen Linder under\n\nTOMA to sign notices of meetings on behalf of the Board. SOF36. The language\n\nof §551.045(d) is clear that it applies to all notices not just emergency notices and\n\nit requires an authorized or designated person to post notices of meetings.\n\n§551.045(d). Thus plaintiffs are entitled to declaration that PISD violated\n\n§551.045(d).\n\nD. Plaintiffs are entitled to declaration that PISD violated TOMA §551.101 by\nimproperly closing its March 26, 2009 meeting and further violated 551.074(b)\n\n      It is not disputed that defendant's president, Mr. Charles Smith did not\n\nidentify the section or sections of TOMA that authorized closing the 3/26/09 board\n\nmeeting to the public under TOMA before closing the meeting. SOF34. PISD thus\n\ndid not comply with the §551.101(2). Therefore, plaintiffs are entitled to\n\ndeclaration that PISD unlawfully closed meeting on March 26, 2009 in violation of\n\n§551.101. Plaintiffs are entitled to all legal and equitable relief and that 3/26/09\n\nclosed meeting and actions taken in it be declared unlawful and contents of the\n\nclosed meeting be made public and allowed to be freely copied and distributed.\n\nPISD deliberated on Terrell's contract termination in the closed meeting on 3/26/09\n\nwhen Terrell had specifically requested the action be deliberated in open meeting\n\nper §551.074(b). SOF35. Plaintiffs are entitled to the declaration that PISD\n\nviolated §551.074(b).\n\n\n\n\n                                         23\n\fE. Plaintiffs are entitled to declaration by the court that PISD violated\n§551.043 concerning the 3/26/09 and 5/19/09 Board Meetings\n\n       Plaintiffs’ rely on SOF33. It is undisputed that the notice of 3/26/09 Board\n\nmeeting was not seen posted in the bulletin board in PISD’s Central Office nor on\n\nits front door at 5 P.M. and after 6 P.M. on 3/23/09 i.e. notice was posted less than\n\nthe prescribed 72 hours in violation of §551.043.4 PISD’s (Linder) vague claims\n\nand surmise do not specifically dispute plaintiffs’ sworn assertions e.g. a revised\n\nnotice for 3/26/2009 meeting was taped to the front door of central office building\n\non 3/24/09, less than 72 hours before the start of the meeting.\n\n       Similarly, the notice for 5/19/09 meeting was posted for less than 72 hours\n\nbecause the meeting date changed from 5/8/09 to 5/19/2009 causing the revised\n\nnotice to be reposted. Because PISD posted (paper) notices of 3/26/09 and 5/19/09\n\nBoard meetings for less than the prescribed 72 hours, PISD violated §551.043.\n\n       TOMA violations Are Distinct: The statutory language of TOMA is clear\n\nthat the above notice provisions are distinct, and failure to comply with any one of\n\nthe notice provisions renders the action(s) in violation of TOMA and thus voidable.\n\n§551.141.\n\n\n\n\n4\n  Whether or not Plaintiffs knew or attended the meeting (SOF40) is irrelevant. TOMA is not\nscheme for process of service and has no due process implications.

The sky is not falling if illegal actions are voided\n\n      PISD has repeatedly tried scare tactics by using the bogeyman of voidance.\n\nAll actions in violation of TOMA must be voided given PISD’s defiance,\n\nconscious indifference, obstruction of discovery, and systematic longstanding\n\nviolations of TOMA’s notice requirements. PISD can ratify the voided actions in a\n\nlegally held board meeting under TOMA. So far PISD has refused to ratify its\n\nactions as was properly done in ATSPAC v. Sierra Club, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">843</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">683</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.\n\nApp.--Austin 1992), preferring instead to scare the courts.\n\nG. Terrell is entitled to back wages and voidance of her illegal termination:\n\n      Terrell was not terminated in a legally convened meeting under TOMA, thus\n\nthe termination action is voidable. §551.141.

Voidance of Terrell’s termination in 3/26/2009 meeting means Terrell\n\nlawfully continues to be an employee and is owed back wages. Courts have upheld\n\nvoidance of action involving employment termination, reinstatement upon\n\nvoidance, and granting back wages and benefits.       See Ferris v. Texas Board\n\nChiropractic Examiners, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2438303\"><a href=\"/opinion/2438303/ferris-v-tex-bd-of-chiropractic-exam/\"><span class=\"volume\">808</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">514</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 519 (Tex.App—Austin 1991) (ordering\n\nback wages and benefits of $26,000 until the time Ms. Ferris was terminated in a\n\nlegally convened meeting under TOMA).

Back wages and benefits are thus due Terrell,\n\ncurrently at about $262,000 for 5 years until Terrell is terminated lawfully in a\n\nsubsequent legally held meeting under TOMA. Ferris, Id. Further Terrell’s illegal\n\ntermination cannot be ratified retroactively because Education Code requires a 45\n\nday notice to Terrell before the last day of instruction (10 days for 2012-2013 and\n\nafter), failing which Terrell’s contract is automatically renewed and becomes, as\n\nhere, a continuing contract after 3 years.

Based\n\non this misrepresentation, this Court remanded this case. It has been six long years\n\nof lies from PISD.

However both SchoolCenter and BoardBook being\n\nvendors employed by PISD are PISD’s agents. The only evidence presented for\n\nPISD’s good faith claim related to SchoolCenter’s role. Because all evidence or\n\ninformation concerning SchoolCenter must be excluded, PISD’s good faith claim\n\nmust be rejected.    Similarly, any portion of good faith claim that relies on\n\nBoardBook and Lee Carter must also fail because such information or evidence\n\n                                         31\n\fmust be excluded and is barred. TRCP 193.6, Boothe, Id. PISD’s good faith\n\ndefense under §551.056(d) fails.\n\nD.    Hearsay and Irrelevant evidence of Linder and Jameson must be barred\n\n      PISD has the burden to prove good faith under §551.056(d). Texas Rules of\n\nEvidence (TRE) bars evidence that is irrelevant and is not personal knowledge of\n\nthe witness. TRE 402, 602, 802. Linder and Jameson’s testimony on good faith\n\ndefense under §551.056(d) was complete hearsay.

No one from SchoolCenter or\n\nBoardBook testified in support of PISD’s good faith.\n\n      Linder made it clear that she has no personal knowledge regarding the claim\n\nof missing link. Transcript pg.191. Further, her entire testimony about good faith\n\ndefense was nothing more than her general opinions and beliefs concerning her\n\nwork in BoardBook software which is irrelevant under TOMA because\n\n§551.056(b) or any other section of TOMA does not require work in BoardBook.\n\nTOMA requires concurrent internet notices to be posted on government body’s\n\nwebsite. §551.056(b).

Under\n\nTRE, her testimony is full of bare assertions on what SchoolCenter did or did not\n\ndo, or failed to do is classic hearsay, lacks personal knowledge, thus must be struck\n\nand excluded from evidence. Her testimony concerning what Lee Carter, the\n\nwebmaster, did or did not do must also be struck as hearsay and excluded. TRE\n\n402, 602, 802.\n\n      At best, Linder and Jameson’s testimonies about BoardBook and\n\nSchoolCenter’s role are bare assertions, too weak, no more than speculation,\n\nsurmise, hearsay and less than a scintilla of evidence, therefore are not legal\n\nevidence concerning good faith.

Plaintiffs were entitled to hearing on newly discovered evidence\n\n       Trial court erred in denying a hearing on newly discovered evidence and\n\nmotion for new trial.

PISD did not have good faith because it removed the link from its\n\nwebsite itself before the creation of new website by SchoolCenter and\n\nSchoolCenter had no role to play in the removal or reestablishing the link. SOF18.\n\n      2. PISD’s Jameson’s testimony at trial was misleading and false. The newly\n\ndiscovered evidence would show that PISD was aware of the removal of link and\n\nwillfully violated §551.056(b).\n\n      The appendices 2 through 5 to motion for new trial (Appendix 1) are PISD’s\n\nwebsite archive pages and view source information of PISD’s website as of the\n\ndates noted i.e. 1/26/2009 and 2/5/2009. View source pages identify the software\n\nthat generated PISD’s website pages viz. “Adobe GoLive” software for the OLD\n\nwebsite and “SchoolCenter” version 8.0 used for the NEW website.\n\n      The newly discovered evidence shows that\n\n      a. PISD concealed the fact that the link to internet notices did not exist on the\n\nOLD website which was managed by PISD itself. The appendices 2 and 3 of\n\nMotion for new trial (Appendix 1) show that PISD managed its website itself\n\nthrough January 26, 2009. PISD has admitted that the TOMA internet notice did\n\nnot appear on its website for its January 15, 2009 meeting because the link was\n\nremoved. The missing link problem started with the January 15, 2009 meeting\n\n\n\n                                          36\n\fnotice when PISD managed the website. There was no link to be transferred to the\n\nnew website which went live after 1/26/2009.\n\n      b. PISD’s OLD website was managed by its webmaster Lee Carter at least\n\nthrough January 26, 2009. Motion for new trial’s appendix 2 (bottom left corner)\n\nand appendix 3 (page 2 of the appendix) clearly identify Lee Carter as PISD’s\n\nwebmaster and show that Lee Carter as an employee had PISD’s business email\n\naddress. PISD used Adobe GoLive software at least up to January 26, 2009 and\n\nmaintained its own website well after the time it admitted that January 15, 2009\n\nmeeting notice did not appear on its website because link was removed when PISD\n\nmanaged its website itself.      The newly discovered evidence shows that\n\nSchoolCenter was not at “fault” as falsely alleged by PISD because as admitted by\n\nPISD the link did not exist on its website on or before 1/15/2009 causing non-\n\nappearance of the internet notice for 1/15/2009 board meeting. PISD removed the\n\nlink in 1/2009 because it thought it was not “necessary.” Appendix 16.\n\n      c. Thus it is obvious PISD’s Suzie Jameson fabricated a story and gave false\n\ntestimony (Appendix 1) blaming SchoolCenter when PISD itself removed the link\n\nin January 2009 or before, on its own watch, before the new website was allegedly\n\ncreated by SchoolCenter in February 2009 (Motion for New trial -appendices 4-5).\n\nThe problem of admitted non-compliance on January 15, 2009 existed before\n\nSchoolCenter allegedly created the new website which was in February 2009.\n\n\n\n                                        37\n\f      d.   PISD concealed Lee Carter’s (PISD’s Technology Director) role in\n\nmaintaining and generating PISD’s website during the time period it claims good\n\nfaith under §551.056(d).     Lee Carter’s name was not disclosed during the\n\ndiscovery process in violation of discovery rules as a person who had knowledge\n\nor any role in this concerning this lawsuit. Appendices 8-11. Lee Carter’s name\n\nappears as webmaster on PISD’s website on January 26, 2009 well after PISD\n\nadmitted that January 15, 2009 meeting notice did not appear on its website due to\n\nalleged link problem. Motion for new trial-appendices 2-3.\n\n      PISD failed to timely disclose and supplement, amend, or correct its\n\nresponses to written discovery, concerning the identity and role of SchoolCenter\n\nand Lee Carter until the trial, the above evidence could not be obtained before trial\n\nand is not cumulative. SchoolCenter and Lee Carter’s roles are material in PISD’s\n\ngood faith defense in §551.056(d). .\n\n      Plaintiff Thanedar testified as expert in technology matters pertinent to this\n\nlawsuit. The above evidence however is obvious to an average person. Plaintiffs\n\naffirm that “Adobe GoLive” was a software product of Adobe Systems Inc. and is\n\nan HTML editor used to maintain and manage websites by its customers. The\n\nword “Generator” in appendix 3 of motion for new trial means what it says i.e.\n\nPISD generated its website using Adobe GoLive.\n\n\n\n\n                                         38\n\f       Refusal to receive newly discovered evidence and refusal to grant new trial\n\nwould be manifest abuse of discretion and permanent loss of plaintiffs’ substantive\n\nrights. A new trial is thus required under law on the good faith claim by PISD and\n\nan evidentiary hearing was required by trial court to receive evidence in the above\n\nmatters which will affirm that PISD’s good faith claim was made in bad faith and\n\nis a fraud. This Court should grant new trial in this case.\n\nF. Missing link to notices is irrelevant because internet notices for 22\nMeetings were untimely created in May 2009 for posting on website weeks\nand months after meetings took place\n\n       The “missing link” to internet notices is a smokescreen and is not relevant.\n\nThe undisputed fact is that PISD untimely created internet notices in May 2009,\n\nweeks and months after the 22 Meetings took place and then posted them untimely\n\non its website all at once on 5/19/2009. Created date of an Adobe PDF document\n\nmeans what it says i.e. the date when the PDF document was created. Transcript\n\npgs.75-86. This is not disputed by PISD. PISD did not produce timely created\n\ninternet notices for 22 Meetings at trial, there is no evidence that they were timely\n\ncreated. Whether or not the link was missing, PISD never timely created internet\n\nnotices for each of the 22 Meetings 72 hours before each meeting started. Because\n\nPISD did not create timely internet notices and untimely posted them, PISD’s good\n\nfaith claim fails.\n\n\n\n\n                                          39\n\f         Because PISD did not care to check for each meeting notice whether its\n\nnotices actually appeared on its website or not, it does not show good faith under\n\n§551.056(d) and its good faith claim must be rejected.\n\nG. PISD did not care or attempt to check if the internet notices actually\nappeared on its website for public viewing for each of the 22 Meetings in 72\nhours before each meeting\n\n         TOMA requires that the internet notices must be concurrently posted on the\n\nGovernment body’s website 72 hours before the start of a meeting. §551.056(b).\n\nThe evidence is undisputed that PISD did not attempt to or care to check that\n\ninternet notices were actually appearing on its website and were available for\n\npublic viewing for any of the 22 Meetings in question. Transcript pgs. 176-178.\n\nAn average person would exercise such care to comply with law. A government\n\nbody should be held to even higher standard. PISD fails even the lower average\n\nperson standard. Thus PISD did not make a good faith attempt under 551.056(d)7\n\nto verify its compliance with §551.056(b). If PISD had done so, it would have\n\nimmediately known and found out that notices were not appearing on its website\n\nand PISD would have presumably fixed its non-compliance with TOMA.\n\n\n\n\n7\n    TOMA §551.056(d) provides that:\n“The validity of a posted notice of a meeting or an agenda by a governmental body or economic\ndevelopment corporation subject to this section that made a good faith attempt to comply with\nthe requirements of this section that is due to a technical problem beyond the control of the\ngovernmental body or economic development corporation.”\n\n\n                                             40\n\f      The language of TOMA is plain and clear that compliance with TOMA must\n\nbe done in the prescribed 72 hours before a meetings starts and must be\n\ncontinuous. §551.043. This requires that a government body must check for each\n\nmeeting that the internet notice actually appears on its website for public viewing.\n\nPISD’s intentional ignorance defeated the purpose of TOMA’s prescribed 72 hour-\n\nrequirement. §551.043; §551.056(b).\n\n      PISD’s intentional ignorance and conscious indifference is not good faith\n\nbecause it did not even once attempt or care to verify that notices actually appeared\n\non its website from 1/2009 to 5/19/2009 in compliance with §551.056(b). It must\n\nbe noted that for meeting notices from 1/2009 to 5/19/2009 for which PISD claims\n\ngood faith, there is no evidence that its website was not up and was not working\n\nnormally.   Haenisch testified the new website had no disruptions. Transcript\n\npg.117. Thousands of other links were working perfectly. Transcript pg.135.\n\nPISD showed intentional ignorance and cover-up to hide its violations of\n\n§551.056(b).\n\n      If this Court does not reverse trial court’s judgment, every government body\n\nintentionally or not, will “ignore” to exercise sufficient care to comply with TOMA\n\nfor months or years and still claim good faith and will be granted exception under\n\n§551.056(d), making a laughing stock out of Texas Open Meetings Act.\n\n\n\n\n                                         41\n\fH. “Oops we forgot,” mistake, negligence, or incompetence is not a technical\n\nproblem\n\n        There is no evidence or insufficient evidence that forgetting to transfer a link\n\nto new website is a “technical”8 problem. §551.056(d). Here, PISD claims that\n\nSchoolCenter made a mistake and did not transfer the link to notices to new\n\nwebsite. Transcript pg.149-150. Jameson testified that the problem was that of a\n\n“missing link.” Transcript pg.149. Even if true, forgetting or making a mistake is\n\nnot a technical problem. There is no evidence that there was anything wrong with\n\nthe link itself. PISD presented no evidence that mistake is a technical problem. To\n\nthe contrary, Jameson herself testified that adding a link on the new website is not\n\ndifficult. Transcript pg.150. Jameson further testified the problem with the link\n\nwas just a “plain and simple oversight.” Jameson refused to even call the oversight\n\na “technical” problem even when prodded by plaintiffs. Transcript pg.150. Thus\n\noversight, negligence or “Oops we forgot” is not a technical problem under\n\nTOMA.\n\nI. “Oops we forgot” to transfer a link is not “beyond the control” of PISD\n\n\n\n\n8\n  Collins English Dictionary – Complete and Unabridged, HarperCollins Publishers, 2003 defines\n“technical” as 1) of, relating to, or specializing in industrial, practical, or mechanical arts and applied\nsciences.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    42\n\f         Even if forgetting to copy or transfer link is a technical problem, there is no\n\nevidence or insufficient evidence that transferring a link to new website was\n\n“beyond the control” of PISD for 5 long months from 1/2009 to 5/19/2009.\n\n§551.056(d). Jameson testified that failure to transfer the link in question was a\n\n“plain and simple oversight” and that it was not difficult. Transcript pgs.149-150.\n\n         Earthquake, snow, rain, hacking and virus attacks are beyond the control of a\n\ngovernment body while these events last.             Forgetting to verify mandatory\n\ncompliance with TOMA for 5 months is most certainly not “beyond the control” of\n\na school district. To suggest otherwise is an insult and fraud on citizens and\n\ntaxpayers of Texas. There is conclusive overwhelming evidence that the link\n\nproblem in question would have been fixed had PISD checked its new website just\n\nonce in 5 months as to whether legally required internet notices were actually\n\nappearing on its new website, but PISD did not do so. SOF21 and 23. All PISD\n\nneeded to do was to get off the chair and check that the link was transferred and\n\nfurther check that the legal meeting notices were actually appearing on its website\n\nfor public viewing. PISD has admitted that it never showed interest and due care\n\nto comply with §551.056(b). SOF21, 23, Transcript pg.146. PISD’s missing link\n\nwas neither a technical problem nor beyond its control. PISD’s good faith defense\n\nfails.\n\n\n\n\n                                            43\n\f      Here, PISD decided it was not going to comply with TOMA 551.056(b), but\n\ngot caught.    There is overwhelming evidence that PISD showed conscious\n\nindifference at best, or bad faith and fraudulent misconduct concerning its legal\n\nduty to comply with TOMA Sec. 551.056(b).\n\n      Jameson’s sham testimony\n\n      Jameson gave false testimony concerning SchoolCenter at trial to avoid\n\nblame on herself. PISD had admitted that Jameson performed duties with respect\n\nto “establishing BoardBook link” on PISD’s new website and not SchoolCenter.\n\nAppendix 16. Jameson’s May 19, 2009 E mail to Linder (Appendix 16) clearly\n\nstates (Emphasis provided):\n\n        I apologize for not having that link on the site. I have added it\n        on the School Board page. There were lots of things that were\n        on the old site that I did not realize needed to go on the new\n        one.\n\n      It is abundantly clear from the above email that PISD and Jameson knew\n\nabout the “link” but did not think it was “needed” on the new website. In written\n\ndiscovery PISD blamed Jameson for “severing” the link in a “maintenance\n\nupdate.” Appendix11-Interrogatories 5, 7. Jameson’s new testimony at trial is\n\ndiametrically contradictory with PISD’s written discover. Both are not credible.\n\nAs a result, Jameson dropped the “link” to BoardBook on PISD’s new website in\n\nJanuary 2009. This can only be described as a mistake, error or negligence, or lack\n\nof due care and diligence, or properly as willful disregard for compliance with\n\n                                        44\n\fTOMA for 5 months. There was no “severance” of the link, no “maintenance\n\nupdate” that “severed” the link, or “inadvertent” mistake here as Jameson clearly\n\nknew about the link and PISD and Jameson decided it was not needed on the new\n\nwebsite and therefore Jameson did not establish it on the new website.\n\nAppendix16. As a matter of law, negligence or lack of due care and diligence by a\n\nperson is not a “technical” problem as the word technical is commonly understood,\n\nand certainly not “beyond the control” of PISD. All PISD had to do was to check\n\nits own website to verify that Board meeting notices were “appearing” on its\n\nwebsite, as a reasonable person would have done. PISD failed to exercise this\n\nreasonable care for 5 months and at least 11 Meetings. PISD fails reasonable care\n\nstandard, which is never beyond PISD’s control.\n\n5. PISD’s good faith claim is a fraud on the citizens and tax payers and courts\nrequiring sanctions\n\n      PISD has obstructed discovery from the beginning concerning BoardBook\n\nand SchoolCenter. PISD lied to the Texas Attorney General and to this Court and\n\nsimply refused to provide documents concerning BoardBook and SchoolCenter to\n\nplaintiffs calling them “beyond the scope of TRCP.” SOF They knew they could\n\nget away with it. SOF6.\n\n      The alleged problem of “link” was only fixed when plaintiff Thanedar\n\nreported nonappearance of notices on 5/15/2009 to PISD in good faith. Appendix\n\n11-Interrogatory 7. Without plaintiffs’ report in good faith, PISD could have\n\n                                       45\n\fcontinued for several more months, or years, or even indefinitely without\n\ncomplying with Sec. 551.056.\n\nPost-remand discovery\n\n      Trial court erred in denying post-remand discovery on good faith. Post-\n\nremand discovery was consistent with the opinion and mandate of this Court. This\n\nis especially important for TOMA because post-remand discovery would have\n\ndiscovered that PISD’s contention that printing changes “created dates” of PDF\n\ndocuments was a fraud on this Court and citizens. Denying post-remand discovery\n\nonly shielded PISD and its obstruction of justice.\n\n      6. Denial of plaintiffs’ evidence led to rendition of incorrect judgment:\n\nThe Court failed to rule on admissibility of plaintiffs’ exhibit PX1 in the one day\n\ntrial excluding it from evidence. PX1 contains 22 board meeting website notices at\n\nissue in this lawsuit and their electronic document properties on Compact Disc.\n\nPlaintiffs rely on facts and argument in Argument 8 below regarding PX1. There\n\nwas no objection by defendant. This exhibit was admitted and authenticated by\n\nJudge Waters before and was reviewed by this Court in the first appeal and the\n\nuntimely “created dates” were central in determining PISD’s good faith. The CD in\n\nquestion is in the record and the record thereon has been reviewed on appeal by the\n\nappeals court. The Court clearly abused its discretion when it refused to rule on\n\nadmissibility of PX1 and thereby ignored the electronic properties of internet\n\n\n\n                                         46\n\fnotices leading to incorrect judgment. As PX1 and its electronic properties are\n\ncentral to violation of TOMA Sec. 551.056 and all other causes of action in\n\nplaintiffs’ live pleadings. Denial of PX1 caused rendition of incorrect judgment as\n\nthe untimely created dates of internet notices would have shown that PISD created\n\nthe internet notices weeks after the 22 meetings took place and untimely posted\n\nthem on 5/19/2009. This would show that PISD’s missing link good faith defense\n\nwas a fraud because the internet notices were not even created concurrently and\n\ntimely. Trial court erred in not ruling on PX1. It should have been admitted.\n\n      Further, trial court erred in denying admission of PX13 which is audio tapes\n\nof 3/26/2009 meeting that shows violation of 551.101, and 551.074(b) which are\n\ncauses of action in this lawsuit and directly relevant, resulting in court’s failing to\n\nrule on the above claims. PX13 should have been admitted.\n\n      Trial court erred in denying admission of PX12(notices of meetings) which\n\nconcerned violation of 551.043, PX14 (excerpt of transcript 3/26/2009 meeting),\n\nconcerned violation of 551.101, PX19(back pay benefits) and PX25(salary\n\nschedules) concerned claim of back pay and special damages, and PX21(sales tax\n\nreceipts) concerned the issue of standing), all central and relevant to TOMA issues.\n\nDenial of this evidence resulted in rendition of incorrect judgment on these issues.\n\nThe above exhibits should have been admitted into evidence.\n\n\n\n\n                                          47\n\f      Trial court’s judgment should be reversed and judgment entered for\n\nplaintiffs. Minimally, plaintiffs’ motions for new trial, to modify judgment, for\n\nreconsideration, and the request for amended and additional FOF and COL should\n\nbe granted on all causes of action.\n\n7. Attorney fee award to PISD is invalid and is not reasonable. PISD\nforfeited and waived attorney fees when it refused to testify\n\n      The trial court committed clear error in granting $30,000 in attorney fees to\n\nPISD by taking “judicial notice of the file” under TOMA. Appendices20, 21.\n\n      Texas law has not allowed recovery of attorney fees unless allowed by\n\nstatute or contract. “Absent a contract or statute, trial courts do not have inherent\n\nauthority to require a losing party to pay the prevailing party’s fees.” Tony Gullo\n\nMotors v. Chapa, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">212</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">299</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 310-311 (Tex. 2006). Nothing in TOMA or its\n\npertinent case authority authorizes or empowers any court to take judicial notice of\n\nattorney fees and to award them without receiving evidence with respect to the\n\nattorney fees and their reasonableness. TOMA §551.142.\n\n      Plaintiffs challenge both the imposition and award of the attorney fees to\n\nPISD on the grounds that 1) PISD is not the substantially prevailing party, 2) the\n\naward of attorney fees is neither legally valid, nor proper, unjust, nor justified in\n\nthis case, and 3) the attorney fee award is not reasonable, manifestly too large and\n\nfurther, PISD forfeited and waived any attorney fees by refusing to testify.\n\n\n\n\n                                         48\n\f        PISD is not the substantially prevailing party:                       PISD is not the\n\nsubstantially prevailing party under TOMA§551.142(b) and cannot be awarded\n\nattorney fees. This is because trial court shockingly refused and failed to try 7\n\nCauses out of eight independent and distinct causes of action or main issues under\n\nTOMA sections 551.041, 551.043, 551.045(d), 551.051, 551.074, 551.101, and\n\n551.142(a) and further failed to rule and make finding of fact or conclusions of law\n\nwith respect to each of the above 7 above causes of action. Appendices 20,21.9\n\nThus PISD did not prevail on 7 out 8 separate and distinct causes of action or main\n\nissues and is not a substantially prevailing party. Hawkins v. Ehler, Infra at 544.\n\nAward of attorney fees to PISD is invalid and unreasonable\n\n       Under TOMA only reasonable attorney fees can be granted if certain\n\nconditions are met. §551.142(2). The reasonableness of attorneys' fees is question\n\nof fact that must be proven at the trial. City of Garland v. Dallas Morning News, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1376478\"><a href=\"/opinion/1376478/city-of-garland-v-dallas-morning-news/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">351</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 367 (Tex. 2000). Thus PISD was required to testify concerning its\n\nattorney fees.\n\nPISD forfeited and waived attorney fees by refusing to testify and prove them\n\n       PISD refused and failed to testify on its attorney fees and refused and failed\n\nto prove them at trial even after Judge Lopez prompted PISD’s counsel to do so.\n9\n  Plaintiffs objected to this misconduct and brought this to trial court’s attention during trial and\nin motions. Appendices1,2,3,4. With 7 out of 8 causes of action never taken to trial and never\ndecided, Judge Lopez’s judgment is not final judgment in spite of the words used in it. Because\nthis was a deliberate conduct on Judge Lopez’s part, no implied findings can be made or\npresumed here. Appellants ask this Court to rule on all causes of action in this appeal.\n\n\n                                                 49\n\fTranscript Page 238. Thus there is no valid application for attorney fees here.\n\nFurther, it must be concluded that PISD forfeited and waived any claim to attorney\n\nfees by refusing and failing to prove and testify on its attorney fees. Thus there is\n\nno evidence or insufficient evidence in the record for the Court to award attorney\n\nfees to PISD of any amount. Court’s award of $30,000 has no basis in law under\n\nTOMA or evidence because there is no evidence or insufficient evidence of tasks\n\ncompleted, hours worked, level of difficulty, identity of attorneys, reasonable\n\nhourly rates of attorneys on the case and other necessary information on which\n\nattorney fees must be based on. See El Apple v. Olivas, Infra.\n\n      No “Judicial Notice of file” for attorney fees under TOMA: The plain\n\nand clear language of §551.142(b) does not permit trial judge to impose attorney\n\nfees by taking “judicial notice.”    It is clearly ascertainable that the award of\n\nattorney fees in this case does not arise under Texas Civil Practice and Remedies\n\nCode (CPRC) §38.001, thus this Court does not have power to take judicial notice\n\nof attorney fees under CPRC§38.004.

App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 1996, no writ) (holding §38.004 only applies to\n\nclaims under §38.001).\n\n      Plaintiffs have proven their good faith in this case:\n\n      Attorney fees award here is legally improper because plaintiffs have\n\nundisputedly proven their good faith at the trial as their report of the violation of\n\n\n\n                                         50\n\fSec. 551.056(b) was the only reason said violation was finally corrected by PISD\n\nafter 5 months of admitted10 non-compliance with TOMA from 1/2009 to\n\n5/19/2009.     Appendix11 (Interrogatory7).         Further plaintiffs prevailed on first\n\nappeal in this case, this Court reversing trial court’s judgment and remanding the\n\ncase which proves conclusively that this lawsuit was in fact brought in good faith.\n\nSee §551.142(b). PISD did not claim nor produced any evidence or insufficient\n\nevidence of bad faith on appellants’ part at trial.\n\n     “Voluminous filings” is not bad faith and Plaintiffs cannot be penalized\nby imposing attorney fees for them\n\n       As explained in this brief, There is no factual evidence or legal basis\n\nwhatsoever for Judge Lopez’s erroneous FOF20 and COL4. Appellants do not\n\nshow bad faith because of “voluminous” filings. Even assuming filings are\n\nvoluminous, appellants cannot be penalized for them as there is no evidence that\n\nany filing was improper or unreasonable. Further, this argument is bogus and\n\nirrational because there is no evidence whatsoever that PISD ever incurred attorney\n\nfees due to filing responses, and Judge Lopez never held hearings and never ruled\n\non them. There is no cost or harm here to PISD.\n\n       Appellants have constitutional right to sue in court and file motions which is\n\nan aspect of the First Amendment right to petition the Government for redress of\n\n10\n   The document properties of PISD’s website notices prove that internet notices for 11 notices\nfrom 8/2008 to 12/2008 were also created in May 2009 and posted for public viewing on\n5/19/2009 after plaintiffs brought the non-compliance with 551.056(b) to PISD’s attention.\n\n\n                                              51\n\fgrievances. Justice Sandra Day O’Connor has noted “this right to petition is one\n\nof the most precious of the liberties safeguarded by the Bill of Rights.” Justice\n\nO’Connor further observed that the First Amendment petition clause says nothing\n\nabout success in petitioning. Thus there is absolutely nothing wrong in filing\n\nmotions and requesting relief that Judge Lopez rule on such motions.             Thus\n\nappellants cannot be penalized for filing motions, voluminous or not, in this\n\nlawsuit to redress grievances. See BE&K Construction v. NLRB, 536 U.S.516\n\n(2002); Bill Johnson’s Restaurants, Inc. v. NLRB, 461 U.S.731 (1983). Thus,\n\n“filings”, even if “voluminous,” are not “bad faith” under TOMA and plaintiffs\n\ncannot be punished with attorney fees for them.\n\n      Further Judge Lopez sitting by assignment has no personal knowledge of all\n\nof the proceedings in this case, being the third judge in this case after Judge Waters\n\nand Judge Vanderpool.\n\n      PISD does not meet prerequisites for attorney fees:        PISD never claimed\n\nthe element of bad faith on plaintiffs’ part which is a prerequisite for attorney fees\n\nunder TOMA §551.142(b), and further, notably, never presented any evidence at\n\nthe trial on the issue. PISD did not plead for attorney fees in its original answer-its\n\namended answer must be struck because it lacks a certificate of service and was\n\nnot served on plaintiffs. See CR285 which is not a certificate of service for the\n\namended answer but a duplicate of CR281(response to previous motion). Because\n\n\n\n                                          52\n\fPISD failed to claim bad faith and failed to present evidence on it, failed to plead\n\nfor attorney fees, it waived attorney fees and the issue of bad faith, thus cannot\n\nrecover attorney fees under §551.142(b) in this case. Nothing under law or TOMA\n\njurisprudence gives trial court the authority or power to advocate for PISD which\n\nfailed to meet prerequisites to attorney fees. The award to PISD must be vacated\n\nand denied.\n\n      Attorney fees for appellate filings must be vacated and denied: Judge\n\nLopez apparently granted attorney fees because plaintiffs made voluminous\n\nappellate filings-though he failed to segregate the amount. Appendices20,21. The\n\ntrial court has no power whatsoever to impose attorney fees for any proceedings or\n\nfilings in the appellate courts, with or without evidence being received. In fact,\n\nplaintiffs prevailed in the first appeal and this Court ordered that defendant pay\n\ncosts to Terrell for the appeal. Thus no attorney fees are due to PISD in the first\n\nappeal. PISD made no argument nor presented any evidence concerning this issue\n\nat trial and did not testify about its time and attorney fees incurred in this regard.\n\nThus there is no basis in law or fact for an award of attorney fees for plaintiffs’\n\nfilings in appeals court.\n\nHas TOMA’s “Sunshine” gone away?\n\n      Further plaintiffs do not have the ability to pay any attorney fees, thus award\n\nis not reasonable under TOMA’s lofty purpose of “sunshine law.” TOMA was\n\n\n\n                                         53\n\fheralded as the “Sunshine Law” to protect Texas citizens after the shockingly\n\ncorrupt scandals of Sharpstown. The deliberate arbitrary award indicates that\n\nJudge Lopez wielded TOMA as a sword to silence appellants and any future\n\ncitizens that dare to question a government body. This will have a chilling effect\n\non citizens and taxpayers who report violations of TOMA and seek redress.\n\n      Statutory attorney fees are not a “Bonanza”\n\n      Chief Justice Nathan Hecht has made it clear that an award of statutory\n\nattorney fees, as here, is not a “Bonanza,” but its amount and reasonableness is a\n\nquestion of fact and must be proven by a party at trial on factors such as reasonable\n\nrate, contract, billing records, fees paid by client, tasks performed, and hours\n\nworked.

Article V, Section 11\nenumerates the circumstances in which a judge is disqualified from sitting in a case. TEX.\nCONST. art. V, § 11. The grounds have essentially been restated in TRCP 18(b)(a).\n\n\n                                             55\n\f      Judge Lopez conducted a meaningless trial on 10/9/2013 and rigged it in\nfavor of defendant:\n\n      Judge Lopez repeatedly failed to rule on trial exhibit PX1 during the trial\n\ninspite of numerous requests by plaintiffs in the one day trial. Transcript pages34,\n\n37, 44, 74, and 204. Defendant never made an objection to PX1. Judge Lopez’s\n\nmisconduct in failing to rule on PX1 has caused serious and permanent harm to\n\nplaintiffs in this case. This was an exhibit which was reviewed by the 7th court of\n\nappeals in the first appeal and formed the basis of the opinion and the reason for\n\nremand in the first appeal by the court of appeals.12 Appendix19. Thus PX1 was a\n\ncritical exhibit at the trial and should have been admitted by trial court. Judge\n\nLopez’s failure to rule on admissibility of PX1 was deliberate and a gross disregard\n\nof his judicial duty resulting in a deliberate damage done to plaintiffs’ case and\n\nobstruction of appeal.\n\n      The outcome was that the trial was a charade and was infected with chaos\n\nand confusion, and plaintiffs were prevented from properly and effectively\n\npresenting their case at trial concerning the deliberate violations of electronic\n\nwebsite internet notices of PISD’s meeting notices and concerning untimeliness of\n\nwebsite notices of 22 Meetings under TOMA §551.056(b) and PISD’s lack of good\n\nfaith under TOMA Sec. 551.056(d).\n12\n  This Court has confirmed that PISD indeed was untimely in creating and posting internet\nnotices in violation of TOMA §551.056(b) for 22 meetings in 2008-2009. These 22 electronic\nnotices and their electronic properties are contained in PX1. Appendix19.\n\n\n                                           56\n\f      PX1 was the cornerstone and basis of not only proving the untimeliness of\n\nthe website notices but proving that PISD’s claim of good faith defense was\n\nfraudulent because the internet notices of 22 notices were created in May 2009 and\n\nposted to website for public viewing on 5/19/2005 after plaintiffs informed PISD\n\nof its non-compliance with §551.056(b). Judge Lopez’s refusal to even rule on\n\nadmissibility of trial exhibit PX1 was purposeful, calculated, and inexcusable\n\nabdication of duty that derailed the entire case of plaintiffs. Further his refusal to\n\nrule on PX1 damaged appellants’ case as they were prevented and unable to\n\npresent their case properly without the critical exhibit PX1 which was central to the\n\ntrial in showing that PISD did not have a good faith defense and that such defense\n\nwas fraudulent i.e. the create dates of the internet notices on PX1 showed that the\n\nnotices were created untimely in violation of TOMA weeks after the meetings in\n\nquestion took place.\n\n      Failure to conduct trial or rule on 7 Causes: Plaintiffs rely on Argument\n\n1 which is set forth verbatim herein. Judge Lopez deliberately improperly failed to\n\ntry plaintiffs’ 7 Causes of action under TOMA and abdicated his independent duty\n\nto try and rule on 7 Causes. Such misconduct brings disrepute to justice system\n\nand violated plaintiffs’ absolute due process constitutional rights. Neither the\n\ndistrict court nor the appeals court has the power to order that plaintiffs’ causes of\n\naction cannot be tried.\n\n\n\n                                         57\n\f       What kind of judge returns evidence filed in the court?\n\n       Trial court conducted an evidentiary hearing ordered by this Court on lost or\n\ndestroyed exhibits on 9/26/2014 to determine fault in the matter.                      Plaintiffs\n\nsubmitted documentary evidence to Judge Lopez in the hearing.13 However, Judge\n\nLopez ordered court reporter to return the evidence to plaintiffs after receiving it in\n\nopen court.       The visiting court reporter mailed the evidence to plaintiffs.\n\nAppendix17.\n\n       What kind of judge returns evidence presented in an evidentiary hearing\n\nordered by this Court? But Judge Lopez did. Such misconduct shows that Judge\n\nLopez lacks judicial temperament, carried animus and bias against plaintiffs, and\n\nadvocated for defendant, and was unfit to preside at the trial in this case. His\n\nconduct and its severity were not known until after trial on 10/9/2013.\n\n       Bias that denies due process In McClenan v.

Crim. App. 1983) the Court of Criminal Appeals held that in criminal cases\n\nbias might be grounds for legal disqualification if that bias was “shown to be of\n\nsuch a nature and to such an extent as to deny a defendant due process of law.”\n\n       Due process is recognized in civil as well as the criminal context. Following\n\nMcClenan ruling in 1983, various Texas appeals courts have recognized McClenan\n\n\n13\n  Curiously, Judge Lopez took possession of all trial exhibits (Transcript page 56) and exhibits\nPX1, PX32, PX19, PX20, and PX25 were lost or destroyed and had to be replaced through\nanother remand and hearing in this case.\n\n\n                                               58\n\fand applied the “bias that denies due process” as bias that materially implicates\n\n“personal interest,” therefore meeting constitutional grounds for disqualification\n\nunder Texas Constitution.

Such\n\nconduct lowers citizens’ regard and confidence in the integrity of judges and the\n\njustice system. The due process violations outlined in this motion require Judge\n\nLopez’s disqualification from the trial on 10/9/2013.\n\n      Judge Lopez was not neutral, but was advocate for PISD and casting himself\n\nin adversarial role against plaintiffs causing damage to plaintiffs’ case –depriving\n\nthem of causes of action and in ensuring their loss at trial.

This Court should reverse trial court’s\n\njudgment and enter judgment for plaintiffs on all causes of action.\n\n                                   VI.

Plaintiffs rely on the following Appendices which are adopted and incorporated by\n\n         reference as if set forth verbatim herein.\n\n                Appendix 1      Suzie Jameson testimony.

Attached.\n\n                Plaintiffs' trial exhibits are denoted as PX followed by the exhibit number.\n\n                2. On October 9, 2013, the Court held trial only on plaintiffs' cause of action in Texas\n\n         Open Meetings Act (TOMA), Texas Gov't Code §551.056 (b) and (d) and declined to hold trial\n\n         on other six causes of action in TOMA Sections 551.041, 551.043, 551.045, 551.051, 551.074,\n\n         551.101. See original petition and two supplemental petitions filed in this case. The Court\n\n         signed judgment on 10/25/2013 and awarded costs and attorney fees of $30,000 by taking\n\n\n\n                                                       332\n\f•   333\n\n\n\n\n    judicial notice of the file. PISD refused to testify at the trial on its attorney fees, but asked the\n\n    Court to take judicial notice of attorney fees.\n\n            3. For the first time at trial, in violation of discovery rules, PISD disclosed that a \"third\n\n    party vendor\" was involved in transferring the link to its website notices on BoardBook. In\n\n    addition, for the first time at trial, in violation of discovery rules, PISD disclosed the identity of\n\n    the third party vendor - \"SchoolCenter\" which created a \"new website\" for PISD allegedly in\n\n    January 2009 and       allegedly failed to transfer said link to the new website causing non-\n\n    appearance of website notices from January 15, 2009 meeting to May 19, 2009 meeting. See\n\n    Appendix 1; PX 8-11.\n\n            Appendices 2 through 5 are PISD's website archive pages and view source information\n\n    of PISD's website as of the dates noted i.e. 1126/2009 and 2/5/2009, in the archive and view\n\n    source pages.     View source pages state software that generated PISD's website pages viz.\n\n    \"Adobe GoLive\" software for the OLD website and \"SchoolCenter\" version 8.0 used for the\n\n    NEW website. The newly discovered evidence clearly shows that PISD purposefully gave false\n\n    and misleading testimony at trial and in its answers to interrogatories and responses to other\n\n    discovery requests. PX 8-11; Appendix 1.\n\n            PISD concealed and falsified the dispositive facts that:\n\n            a. Said link in question did not exist on the OLD website which was managed by PISD\n\n    itself through January 26, 2009. PISD has admitted that the TOMA internet notice did not\n\n    appear on its website for its January 15, 2009 meeting because the link was removed. See PX 8-\n\n    11; Appendix 2, 3.\n\n            b. PISD's OLD website was managed by its webmaster Lee Carter at least through\n\n    January 26, 2009. Appendix 2 (bottom left comer) and Appendix 3 (page 2 of the appendix)\n\n\n\n\n    Motion for New Trial                    Cause No. 35621                           Page2 of24\n                                                      333\n\f334\n\n\n\n\nclearly identify Lee Carter as PISD's webmaster and show that Lee Carter as an employee or\n\ncontractor had PISD's business email address. PISD used Adobe GoLive software at least up to\n\nJanuary 26, 2009 and maintained its own website well after the time it admitted that January 15,\n\n2009 meeting notice did not appear on its website because link was removed when PISD\n\nmanaged its website itself. The newly discovered evidence shows that SchoolCenter was not at\n\n\"fault\" as falsely alleged by PISD because as admitted by PISD the link did not exist on its\n\nwebsite on or before 1115/2009 causing non-appearance of the internet notice for 1/15/2009\n\nboard meeting.\n\n        c. Thus it is obvious PISD's Suzie Jameson fabricated a story and gave false testimony\n\n(Appendix 1) blaming SchoolCenter when PISD itself removed the link in January 2009 or\n\nbefore, on its own watch, before the new website was allegedly generated by SchoolCenter in\n\nFebruary 2009 (Appendices 4-5).\n\n        d. PISD concealed Lee Carter's (PISD's Technology Director) role in maintaining and\n\ngenerating PISD's website during the time period it claims good faith under 551.056(d). Lee\n\nCarter's name was not disclosed during the discovery process in violation of discovery rules as a\n\nperson who had knowledge or any role in this concerning this lawsuit. PX 8-11. Lee Carter's\n\nname appears as webmaster on PISD's website on January 26, 2009 well after PISD admitted\n\nthat January 15, 2009 meeting notice did not appear on its website due to alleged link problem.\n\nAppendices 2-3.\n\n        The above newly discovered evidence is not cumulative and it could not be obtained\n\nbefore as the existence and identity of the \"third party vendor\" was concealed before, not\n\ndisclosed until during the trial on 10/9/2013.      Lee Carter's identity as a webmaster and\n\nTechnology Director was also not disclosed until during the trial itself which is material on the\n\n\n\n\nMotion for New Trial                  Cause No. 35621                          Page 3 of24\n                                              334\n\f335\n\n\n\n\nissue of good faith under Sec. 551.056(d). The newly discovered evidence clearly shows PISD\n\nmanaged its website when the 1/15/2009 meeting notice did not appear on its website as\n\nadmitted by PISD. Obviously, SchoolCenter could not transfer to the new website what did not\n\nexist on the OLD website that PISD maintained itself with Lee Carter as its webmaster. The\n\nnewly discovered evidence is material and dispositive, and is fatal to PISD's good faith claim.\n\nBecause PISD failed to supplement its interrogatory answers and failed to provide correct and\n\ncomplete answers to interrogatories and other discovery (PX 8·11 ), plaintiffs were not able to\n\nobtain the above evidence before trial.\n\n        Plaintiff Thanedar testified as expert in technology matters pertinent to this lawsuit. The\n\nabove evidence however is obvious to an average person. Plaintiffs affirm that \"Adobe GoLive\"\n\nwas a software product of Adobe Systems Inc. and· is an HTML editor used to maintain and\n\nmanage websites by its customers. The word \"Generator\" in Appendix 3 means what it says i.e.\n\nPISD generated its website using Adobe GoLive. Appendix 3.                The newly discovered evidence\n\nshows \"SchoolCenter\" was not responsible for NOT transferring or transporting said link to\n\ninternet notices as alleged by PISD at trial because PISD's website did not have the link in\n\nJanuary as admitted by PISD.

Refusal to receive newly discovered evidence and refusal to grant new trial would\n\nbe manifest abuse of discretion and permanent loss of plaintiffs' substantive rights. A new trial\n\nis thus required under law on the good faith claim by PISD and an evidentiary hearing should be\n\nconducted by this Court to receive evidence in the above matters which will affirm that PISD's\n\ngood faith claim was made in bad faith and is a fraud.

The Court clearly erred in granting $30,000 in attorney fees to PISD by taking\n\n''judicial notice of the file\" as asked by PISD.

Thus PISD\n\n    was required to testify concerning its attorney fees. PISD refused and failed to testify on its\n\n    attorney fees and refused and failed to prove them. Thus PISD forfeited and waived any claim to\n\n    attorney fees. Because PISD refused and failed to prove and testify on its attorney fees, there is\n\n    no evidence or insufficient evidence in the record for the Court to award attorney fees to PISD.\n\n    Court's award of $30,000 has no basis in law or evidence because there is no evidence or\n\n    insufficient evidence of tasks completed, hours worked, level of difficulty, identity of attorneys,\n\n    reasonable hourly rates of attorneys on the case and other necessary information on which\n\n    attorney fees must be based on and can be determined.

Further this court sitting by assignment has no personal knowledge of all of the\n\n    proceedings in this case, being the third judge in this case after Judge Waters and Judge\n\n\n\n\n    Motion for New Trial                    Cause No. 35621                           Page 6 of24\n                                                     337\n\f338\n\n\n\n\nVanderpool. Further plaintiffs do not have the ability to pay attorney fees, thus award is not\n\nreasonable. PISD did not plead in its original or the amended answer the required prerequisites\n\nto attorney fees as required by TOMA Sec. 551.142. PISD's first amended answer is defective\n\nas it does not contain a proper certificate of service under TRCP and PISD failed to answer\n\nplaintiffs' second supplemental petition.\n\n        This Court has no authority or power under TOMA and no inherent authority or power to\n\nimpose attorney fees for any proceedings or filing in the appellate courts, with or without\n\nevidence being received. Defendant has provided no statutory support or case authority for it.\n\nFurther there is no evidence or insufficient evidence of filings by plaintiffs in the appellate court\n\non which to base attorney fees award on by this Court. Defendant made no argument concerning\n\nits attorney fees for appellate filings by plaintiffs. There is no evidence or insufficient evidence\n\nthat PISD made any responses to plaintiffs' appellate- filings and that they were accepted by\n\nappeals court. In fact, defendant's responses have been rejected by appeals court. In addition,\n\nplaintiffs prevailed on appeal in this case and the case was remanded back to trial court. Court's\n\nfinding that plaintiffs made voluminous filings is legally immaterial, arbitrary, and capricious\n\nbecause plaintiffs prevailed on appeal and defendant's responses were found defective by\n\nappeals court. Thus there is no basis in law or fact for an award of attorney fees for plaintiffs'\n\nfilings in appeals court. Further appeals court failed to segregate appeals court's portion of the\n\nattorney fees from trial court portion of the award and attorney fees before remand and after\n\nremand. Since, plaintiffs prevailed on appeal and were awarded costs by appeals court, no\n\nattorney fees and costs for proceedings before remand can be or should be awarded to PISD.\n\n        The attempt by PISD for attorney fees is a bald attempt to intimidate plaintiffs in not\n\nfiling an appeal of this Court's judgment. Such an attempt is an outrageous affront to the purpose\n\n\n\n\nMotion for New Trial                   Cause No. 35621                            Page 7 of24\n                                                338\n\f339\n\n\n\n\nof open government under TOMA and will have chilling effect on citizens and taxpayers who\n\nreport violations of TOMA and seek redress. PISD has refused to testify and prove its attorney\n\nfees before this Court (or appeals court), this Court failed to receive evidence concerning\n\nattorney fees, thus PISD waived and forfeited attorney fees.\n\n        It is clearly ascertainable that PISD did not respond to plaintiffs' motions or letters\n\nwhether or not they were \"voluminous,\" thus there is no evidence that PISD ever incurred\n\nattorney fees or insufficient evidence that PISD ever incurred attorney fees and to what extent\n\nwith respect to PISD's complaints about plaintiffs filings. Further, plaintiffs cannot be penalized\n\nor sanctioned for filing lawsuits or for their filings whether or not they were voluminous as they\n\na have constitutional right to seek redress of their grievances. The plain fact is there is no\n\nevidence or insufficient evidence ofPISD spending any time on plaintiffs' \"filings\" in this Court\n\nor in appeals court.\n\n        An attorney fees award based on no evidence ofexistence and reasonableness of attorney\n\nfees viz. identity of attorneys, hours worked, tasks performed, quality and difficulty of work,\n\nhourly rate and other factors; or insufficient evidence of existence viz. identity of attorneys,\n\nhours worked, tasks performed, quality and difficulty of work, hourly rate and other factors\n\nviolates plaintiffs' constitutional rights of due process and equal protection under Texas\n\nConstitution and 14th Amendment to the Unites States Constitution as such arbitrary and\n\ncapricious and manifestly too large and unreasonable imposition of attorney fees has no support\n\nin law or case authority. Therefore imposition of attorney fees without legal support under\n\nTOMA and without receiving evidence is not only a clear abuse of discretion but is abusive to\n\nTexas citizens and taxpayers such as plaintiffs. This Court should vacate its judgment and order\n\nnew trial. PISD did not offer argument at trial or in its pleadings about whether plaintiffs\n\n\n\n\nMotion for New Trial                   Cause No. 35621                          Page 8 of24\n                                               339\n\f340\n\n\n\n\nbrought this suit in good faith or being a prevailing party, or whether its actions had a reasonable\n\nbasis in law on all causes of action brought by plaintiffs. See Sec. 551.142. PISD failed to plead\n\nprerequisites to attorney fees in its amended answer.           Sec. 551.142. PISD's first amended\n\nanswer is defective as it does not have proper certificate of service under TRCP. Plaintiffs adopt\n\nand incorporate by reference their response to defendant's first amended answer and plaintiffs'\n\nspecial exceptions and affirmative defense to defendant's request for attorney fees and costs\n\n(which are on file) as if set forth verbatim herein.\n\n          As explained before, there is clear undisputed evidence of good faith on the part of\n\nplaintiffs in this case, thus imposition of costs is improper and unreasonable. See TOMA Sec.\n\n551.142. PX 8-11. The judgment and award of attorney fees of $30,000 and costs should be\n\nvacated and denied and new trial ordered. PISD offered no evidence of lack of good faith on the\n\npart of plaintiffs and did not even offer an argument on it.             Thus there is no evidence or\n\ninsufficient evidence of lack of good faith or bad faith in the record on the part of plaintiffs.\n\n          5. The Court erred when it denied trial on plaintiffs' remaining six (6) distinct causes of\n\naction under TOMA Sections 551.041, 551.043, 551.045, 551.051, 551.074, 551.101. 3 See\n\nplaintiffs' original petition and the two supplements on file.\n\n\n\n3\n PISD's Board of Trustees (Board) held 11 meetings each in 2008 and 2009 from 8/13/08 to 5/19/09.\nViolations of TOMA provisions at Issue in this case:\n      •   §551.051: PISD violated §551.051 by failing to post notices of 3/26/09 board meeting and 22\n          Meetings in a specifically designated place - Bulletin Board in its Central Administrative Office\n          (Central Office) as required by TOMA.\n      •   §551.056: PISD violated §551.056 by failing to concurrently post internet notices of 3/26/09\n          board meeting and 22 Meetings on its website for prescribed time and manner.\n      •   §551.043: PISD violated §551.043 by failing to post notices of 3/26/09 board meeting and 22\n          Meetings at a physical location for prescribed time (72 hours) and manner.\n      •   §551.041: PISD violated §551.041 by failing to specify \"place\" (Pampa, Texas) in its notices\n          (internet and paper notices) of 3/26/09 board meeting and 22 Meetings.\n\n\n\nMotion for New Trial                       Cause No. 35621                             Page9 of24\n                                                    340\n\f341\n\n\n\n\n          The Court stated that the appeals court remanded the case to hold trial only in the cause\n\nof action in Sec. 551.056(b) and (d). This is plainly incorrect. The appeals court did not state\n\nthe causes of action on which trial should be held. See the Opinion and Mandate of the appeals\n\ncourt on file in this case. The appeals court did not rule on said 6 causes of action in its opinion\n\nand this Court was required to hold trial on them and specifically rule on them. The Texas Rules\n\nof Civil Procedure require that the Court rule on all causes of action and the judgment conform\n\nto pleadings. The record of trial is clear - plaintiffs did not agree to forego their right to trial on\n\nsaid 6 causes of action. The Court has failed to make findings of fact and conclusions of law\n\nregarding said 6 causes of action. TOMA Sec. 551.142(a) entitles plaintiffs to ruling and relief\n\non their said 6 causes of action.        Plaintiffs refer to and rely on the facts, arguments, and\n\nauthorities presented and relief requested in regards to said 6 causes of action in plaintiffs'\n\nsecond no-evidence and traditional motion for summary judgment (filed in this case on\n\n10/3112012) as if set forth verbatim herein. If the Court is of the opinion that material fact\n\nquestion remains as to any of the said 6 causes of action, the Court was required to try them,\n\nalternatively, if the Court believes no material fact question remains, the Court is required to rule\n\non said six causes of action.

S. Constitution. Plaintiffs request that judgment be vacated and new trial\n\nbe granted on all causes of action.\n\n        6. The Court erred in denying plaintiffs' motions to exclude evidence concerning any\n\nperson or third party vendor's role or involvement about which full discovery was not provided\n\nor role and involvement not disclosed during the discovery process to plaintiffs in this case\n\nincluding SchoolCenter and BoardBook. The Court erred in denying plaintiffs' motion to strike\n\nand exclude Jameson's testimony regarding SchoolCenter as PISD had concealed and failed to\n\ndisclose its identity and role during discovery process.      PISD further failed to supplement\n\ndiscovery concerning the identity and role of SchoolCenter concerning its good faith defense\n\nunder Sec. 551.056(d).\n\n        For the first time at trial, PISD asserted that a third party vendor, SchoolCenter, made the\n\nmistake of not transporting the link to BoardBook to a new website. PISD engaged in trial by\n\nambush in this regard by concealing 1) that a third party vendor was involved in creating a new\n\nwebsite, 2) that this vendor School Center was responsible for the error of dropping the link to\n\ninternet notices on BoardBook. PISD during discovery process represented that only Jameson\n\nand Linder had knowledge of the link problem and did not disclose that any other person or\n\nvendor was involved in either creating the new website or transporting the link to the new\n\nwebsite. See PX 8-11; Appendix 1.\n\n\n\n\nMotion for New Trial                   Cause No. 35621                          Page 11 of24\n                                                342\n\f•\n    343\n\n\n\n\n            At trial, PISD admitted that it had a contract with SchoolCenter, but did not disclose its\n\n    existence and the role of SchoolCenter during discovery process and failed to supplement\n\n    discovery. PX 8-11. PISD divulged the identity and its claim that SchoolCenter played a central\n\n    role in its non-compliance with Sec. 551.056(b) for 5 months from 1115/2009 meeting to\n\n    5/19/2009 meeting by not transporting the link to PISD's website notices on BoardBook. PISD\n\n    disclosed the identity of SchoolCenter and its role for the first time in Jameson's testimony at\n\n    trial on 10/9/2013. Because PISD concealed the identity of SchoolCenter and its alleged crucial\n\n    role in PISD's non-compliance with TOMA during discovery process, the Court should have\n\n    excluded and struck Jameson's testimony relating to any and all evidence relating to\n\n    SchoolCenter as a sanction on PISD.

TRCP 193.1, 193.5         PISD intentionally misled plaintiffs by\n\n    concealing SchoolCenter's identity and role until during the trial committing trial by ambush on\n\n    plaintiffs. The sanction for failure to comply with this rule is exclusion of the evidence affected\n\n    by the violation. Tex. R. Civ. P. 215(5).; TRCP 193.6; See Boothe v. Hausler at 789. PISD\n\n    failed to establish before the trial court that good cause existed for allowing SchoolCenter related\n\n    evidence. Boothe v.

See notice of pending motions which is on file.\n\n        Because PISD failed to comply with discovery rules and concealed and obstructed\n\njustice, plaintiffs were severely compromised in their ability to show that non-compliance with\n\n551.056(b) for 5 months was actually due to the fact PISD did not have BoardBook service\n\nduring that time period and that PISD obtained it in May 2009 and retroactively posted meeting\n\nnotices to its websites to conceal its non-compliance with TOMA. Similarly, because PISD\n\nconcealed the identity of SchoolCenter until the trial and SchoolCenter's alleged failure in\n\ntransporting \"link\" to PISD website notices, plaintiffs were severely compromised in this regard.\n\nIn both instances, the testimony and the issues were dispositive and not cumulative because they\n\nrelated to the controlling and central issue ofPISD's good faith under Sec. 551.056(d) and why\n\nthe link to website notices was missing for 5 months in 2009. Boothe v. Hausler, at 789. The\n\nCourt should have excluded evidence concerning SchoolCenter and BoardBook, alternatively\n\nshould have granted continuance of the trial as requested by plaintiffs to conduct further\n\ndiscovery. TRCP 193.6(c).\n\n        7.   Plaintiff moves for new trial in this case on all causes of action as there is\n\noverwhelming evidence against the Court's judgment or no evidence to support it, alternatively,\n\ninsufficient evidence to support the Court's judgment in this case. Further, the record discloses\n\nthe following: (1) there is complete absence of evidence of a vital fact; (2) the court is barred by\n\nrules of law or evidence from giving weight to the only evidence offered to prove a vital fact; (3)\n\nthe evidence offered to prove a vital fact is no more than a scintilla of evidence; or (4) the\n\nevidence conclusively established the opposite of a vital fact.

It is clear from the plain language of TOMA Sec.\n\n551.056(d) that PISD has the burden of proof to prove good faith under Sec. 551.056(d) as to\n\nwhy its non-compliance with Sec. 551.056(b) was in good faith for 5 long months from 112009\n\nto 5/19/2009.\n\n        Karen Linder and Barry Haenisch in their testimonies engaged in surmise, speculation\n\nand had no personal knowledge concerning a ''third party vendor\" who they did not want to or\n\ncould not identify. Their testimony thus was bare opinion, hearsay, incompetent, speculative,\n\nand immaterial as to whether PISD exercised good faith concerning its non-compliance with Sec.\n\n551.056(b).     Thus the evidence they presented was no more than scintilla, surmise, and\n\nspeculation which is not legal evidence. \"When the evidence offered to prove a vital fact is so\n\nweak as to do no more than create a mere surmise or suspicion of its existence, the evidence is no\n\nmore than a scintilla and, in legal effect, is no evidence at all,\" Kindred v.

Karen Linder's testimony was a sham because she admitted that her\n\nsworn answers to plaintiffs' interrogatories were nothing but speculation and she did not have\n\nknowledge about technical matters in question. 4 PX 8-11. Karen Linder's assertion that she\n\n\"worked in BoardBook\" on her computer was no more than bare opinion as PISD presented no\n\nevidence that it actually had BoardBook service during the period in question i.e. 112009 to\n\n5/18/2009 or at any time from 8/13/2008 to 5/19/2009.                Thus their testimonies must be\n\n\n4\n  PISD falsely represented to the appeals court that printing PDF notices, opening, closing PDF notices by\nthemselves changed the create and modify dates of website notices. Based on this fraudulent\nmisrepresentation, appeals court remanded the case to determine the facts. PISD now states at trial that it\nwas just speculation on their part. This is plain obstruction of justice.\n\n\nMotion for New Trial                      Cause No. 35621                             Page 14 of24\n                                                   345\n\f•\n    346\n\n\n\n\n    disregarded as no material fact question was raised or answered by their testimonies and because\n\n    the Court was barred by rules of law or evidence from giving weight to the only evidence they\n\n    offered (hearsay, bare opinion, and speculation) to prove a vital fact of good faith under TOMA.\n\n            As previously explained above, Suzie Jameson's testimony concerning SchoolCenter\n\n    must be excluded and struck from evidence as a sanction foy violation of discovery rules. Even\n\n    otherwise, Jameson's testimony concerning SchoolCenter was no more than bare opinion and\n\n    hearsay, surmise, speculation, thus does not constitute legal evidence and must be disregarded\n\n    under rules of evidence. Kindred at 63. PISD presented no competent evidence (e.g. contract,\n\n    payment of license fee, renewal fee, executed contract, check register, service correspondence,\n\n    etc.) that it actually had SchoolCenter as vendor providing any kind of service. PISD and\n\n    Jameson concealed the identity of SchoolCenter and its role in transporting the link in question\n\n    to a \"new website\" allegedly managed by SchoolCenter. There is no evidence or insufficient\n\n    evidence that any third party vendor including SchoolCenter was a vendor for PISD and such\n\n    vendor including School Center provided any kind of service to PISD including creation of new\n\n    website or transporting the link in question. PISD chose to obstruct justice instead of complying\n\n    with the discovery rules, it should not be rewarded for it.\n\n            Further as explained in paragraph 3 above, the newly discovered evidence clearly shows\n\n    that PISD generated its own website through 1126/2009 and PISD has already admitted that its\n\n    January 15, 2009 board meeting's website notice did not appear on its website due to alleged link\n\n    being removed. Thus it is clear from PISD's own admission and newly discovered evidence that\n\n    the link problem already existed on PISD's old website which it generated itself by using Adobe\n\n    GoLive program by its own employee Lee Carter - webmaster and technology director.\n\n    Appendices 2-5. The problem of admitted non-compliance on January 15, 2009 existed before\n\n\n\n\n    Motion for New Trial                    Cause No. 35621                       Page 15 of24\n                                                     346\n\f347\n\n\n\n\nSchoolCenter allegedly created the new website which was in February 2009. Jameson's\n\ntestimony blaming SchoolCenter for not transferring the link was false and fraudulent as the link\n\ndid not exist on PISD's website in January 2009 when PISD and Lee Carter its webmaster\n\nmanaged its own website - hence there was no link to transfer. PISD falsified evidence at trial.\n\nThus an evidentiary hearing is warranted in this matter to receive evidence in this case. A new\n\ntrial should be granted on all causes of action. There is no evidence, alternatively insufficient\n\nevidence that SchoolCenter caused loss of link as alleged by PISD or that SchoolCenter was\n\nresponsible for not transferring the link in February 2009. This is because the newly discovered\n\nevidence shows that the link did not exist on PISD's website in January 2009 when PISD\n\nmanaged the website.      It is clear that the link was removed by PISD itself as it was not\n\n\"necessary\" as alleged by Jameson. PX 32; Appendix 1. At best, SchoolCenter's role is no more\n\nthan speculation, surmise which is not legal evidence in this case. See Kindred at 63. As\n\nexplained above, evidence at trial concerning SchoolCenter must be excluded. Further, evidence\n\nat trial concerning existence of BoardBook service during 1/2009 to 5/19/2009 must also be\n\nexcluded. This Court should set aside its judgment including award of attorney fees and costs,\n\norder new trial and further permit discovery concerning PISD's newly disclosed existence of a\n\nthird party vendor, SchoolCenter, who allegedly made the error of not transporting the \"link\" to\n\nthe legally required internet notices. Plaintiffs are entitled to discovery concerning SchoolCenter\n\nbecause its existence and its role was never disclosed before the trial.\n\n        8. Furthermore, there is no evidence or insufficient evidence that PISD's non-compliance\n\nwith TOMA Sec. 551.056(b) was in good faith.              On the contrary, there is overwhelming\n\n\n\n\nMotion for New Trial                    Cause No. 35621                        Page 16 of24\n                                                 347\n\f348\n\n\n\n\nevidence that its non-compliance was not in good faith. PISD has the burden of proof, but PISD\n\nfailed to meet its burden under TOMA Sec. 551.056(d). 5\n\n         a. There is no evidence or insufficient evidence that PISD made a good faith attempt to\n\npost internet notices to comply with Sec. 551.056(b) for 11 meetings from 1115/2009 to\n\n5/19/2009. PISD and its staff never checked its website for each of the 11 meetings to see\n\nwhether their each alleged attempt, if any, resulted in website notices actually appearing on its\n\nwebsite.    PISD (Haenisch, Linder and Jameson testimonies) admitted that it did not verify\n\ncompliance during said time period. See for example, Appendix 1. There is overwhelming\n\nevidence in the record that PISD did not exercise due diligence and care for any of the meetings\n\nthat took place from January 15, 2009 to 5/19/2009 because no one at PISD ever verified\n\nwhether or not TOMA notices actually appeared on PISD's website. If PISD had done so, it\n\nwould have immediately known and found out that notices were not appearing on its website and\n\nPISD would have presumably fixed its non-compliance with TOMA. PISD never checked its\n\nown website for compliance during January 2009 to 5/19/2009 for TOMA compliance with Sec.\n\n551.056(b) until plaintiffs informed them of the no-appearance. This is admitted by PISD. PX\n\n8-11. An average person with normal or average standard of care and due diligence would have\n\nchecked or verified PISD's website to ensure that the required legal notices actually appeared on\n\nthe new website when it was created in February 2009. In fact an average person with exercising\n\nstandard care would have verified appearance of legal notices on its website for every board\n\nmeeting since January 15, 2009 through 5/19/2009 (the period for which PISD admitted TOMA\n\n5\n    TOMA §551.056(d) provides that:\n\"The validity of a posted notice of a meeting or an agenda by a governmental body or economic\ndevelopment corporation subject to this section that made a good faith attempt to comply with\nthe requirements of this section that is due to a technical problem beyond the control of the\ngovernmental body or economic development corporation.\"\n\n\nMotion for New Trial                   Cause No. 35621                        Page 17 of24\n                                                348\n\f349\n\n\n\n\nnotices did not appear on its website and for which it claims good faith). The trial testimonies of\n\nHaenisch, Linder, and Jameson are clear that not one of them or any one else at PISD checked\n\neven once that TOMA legal notices actually appeared on PISD's website especially after\n\ncreating new website. Thus PISD did not exercise due diligence or care for 5 months in question\n\nand therefore its good faith defense fails and must be rejected. If this Court does not reverse its\n\njudgment, every government body intentionally or not, will \"fail\" to exercise sufficient care to\n\ncomply with TOMA for months or years and still claim good faith and will be granted exception\n\nunder Sec. 551.056(d), making a laughing stock out of Texas Open Meetings Act.\n\n        b.   There is no evidence or insufficient evidence that PISD's website contained the\n\nalleged link to website notices BEFORE SchoolCenter allegedly created a new website in\n\nFebruary 2009. Appendix 4-5. There is no evidence or insufficient evidence that negligence or\n\nincompetence on PISD's part concerning not transferring or transporting a link is a \"technical\n\nproblem.\" See Sec. 551.056(d). \"Oops we forgot\" is not a technical problem under TOMA.\n\n        c. There is no evidence or insufficient evidence that transferring a link to an alleged new\n\nwebsite was \"beyond the control\" of PISD for 5 long months from 112009 to 5/19/2009. See\n\nSec. 551.056(d). Jameson testified that failure to transfer the link in question was an \"oversight\"\n\nand negligence. Appendix I. There is overwhelming evidence that the link problem in question\n\nwould have been fixed had PISD checked its \"new\" website just once in 5 months as to whether\n\nlegally required internet notices were actually appearing on its website. There is overwhelming\n\nevidence that PISD showed conscious indifference at best or bad faith and fraudulent misconduct\n\nconcerning its legal duty to comply with TOMA Sec. 551.056(b).\n\n        The problem of link was only fixed when plaintiff Thanedar reported nonappearance of\n\nnotices on 5/15/2009 to PISD in good faith. PX 8-11. Without plaintiffs' report in good faith,\n\n\n\n\nMotion for New Trial                   Cause No. 35621                         Page 18 of24\n                                                349\n\f350\n\n\n\n\nPISD could have continued for several more months or even indefinitely without complying with\n\nSec. 551.056.\n\n        This government body presumes that the Court would take no action on its blatant\n\nmisconduct and concealment of evidence and Texas citizens will never find out about its bad\n\nfaith. PISD is mistaken. This Court should not condone such conduct.\n\n        9. The Court erred in denying plaintiffs' motions for continuance of trial. Plaintiffs\n\nadopt and incorporate by reference their application for continuance of final trial only but not of\n\npending motions (filed on or about 10/4/2013) and plaintiffs' expedited motion to reset trial date\n\nof October 9, 2013 (filed on or about 9/20/12013) as if set forth verbatim herein. Thus\n\ncontinuance was proper and this Court should grant this motion for new trial.\n\n        Further continuance of the trial was proper due to the death of plaintiff Thanedar' s\n\nmother (Terrell's mother in law) and Thanedar's travel to India during the month of September\n\n2013 leaving on 9/6/2013 and returning on 9/25/2013 less than two weeks before the trial. Due\n\nto death in the family, plaintiffs were thus not prepared physically or emotionally for the trial on\n\n10/9/2013.    Further, as explained before, crucial dispositive evidence concerning existence,\n\nidentity, and role of third party vendor SchoolCenter was introduced during trial in violation of\n\ndiscovery rules. Thus continuance was proper in this case. TRCP 193.6(c).\n\n        10. The Court erred when it stated during trial that it will rule on admissibility of PX1\n\n(22 board meeting website notices at issue in this lawsuit and their electronic document\n\nproperties on Compact Disc) at a later time but failed to do so during the length of 1 day trial on\n\n10/9/2013. Plaintiffs reminded and urged the Court to make a ruling however the Court failed to\n\ndo so thereby impliedly denying Admission of PX1. Plaintiff however made offer of proof,\n\nfurther stating that the CD in question was relevant in determining compliance with TOMA Sec.\n\n\n\n\nMotion for New Trial                   Cause No. 35621                          Page 19 of24\n                                                350\n\f351\n\n\n\n\n551.056 for the 22 meetings in question and the electronic properties on the CD were\n\nauthenticated by Judge Waters. PISD did not make a specific valid objection. The CD in\n\nquestion is in the record and the record thereon has been reviewed on appeal by the appeals\n\ncourt. The Court clearly abused its discretion when it refused to rule on admissibility ofPX1 As\n\nPX1 is central to violation of TOMA Sec. 551.056 and all other causes of action in plaintiffs'\n\nlive pleadings. PX2 which is the summary of PX 1 was admitted in the record. There are other\n\nerrors in admission of plaintiffs' trial exhibits e.g. PX32 which was actually admitted but does\n\nnot appear as admitted exhibit in record, thus the error should be corrected.       The Court further\n\nerred in not admitting plaintiffs Exhibit number 23 (concerning violation of Sec. 551.051 ),\n\nExhibit number 25 (salary schedules - back pay and benefits}, Exhibit 26 (disclosures to\n\nplaintiffs), Exhibit 27 (violation of Sec. 551.041 - requirement of Place) as these relate to\n\nplaintiffs' causes of action the Court refused to try or hear. Given the weight and importance of\n\nthese matters represented by the not-admitted exhibits above, led to incorrect judgment in this\n\ncase. Further refusing to admit PX1 and ignoring electronic properties of notices contained\n\ntherein which is at the center of violation of Sec.551.056 led to rendition of incorrect judgment.\n\nThus, the Court should grant new trial on all causes of action.\n\n        11. The Court erred in denying post-remand discovery including motions to compel\n\ndiscovery.    Plaintiffs have repeatedly made arguments before the Court that post-remand\n\ndiscovery is consistent with the opinion and mandate of the appeals Court. 6 Plaintiffs refer and\n\n\n6\n  This case was remanded by the 7th Court of Appeals for the sole reason to determine whether there is\nevidence for PISD's \"good faith\" claim under Texas Open Meetings Act (TOMA) with respect to the\nuntimeliness of its website notices posted on BoardBook and whether the \"create dates\" of its website\nnotices changed due to \"printing.\" See 7th Court of Appeals Opinion (pages 5-6) and Mandate on file;\nand Texas Gov't Code §551.056 (b) and (d). On remand, defendant has repeatedly refused to supplement\nits answers to interrogatories or other discovery requests. See PX 22 (letter requesting supplementation\nfrom PISD).\n\n\n\nMotion for New Trial                     Cause No. 35621                           Page20of24\n                                                  351\n\f352\n\n\n\n\nrely on arguments made in the following motions which are adopted and incorporated by\n\nreference as if set forth verbatim herein: Second no-evidence and traditional motion for summary\n\nJudgment, Motion to Reset Trial, Application for Continuance, Plaintiffs' Motion for Ruling on\n\nPost-Remand Discovery, to Exclude, for Inferences, to Compel discovery from defendant, and\n\nFor Sanctions Filed on 6/5/12, Motion to Vacate Court Order and for Oral Depositions and\n\nAdditional Discovery Filed on 11/16/2012. As explained before, without post-remand discovery,\n\nplaintiffs' ability to present their claims at trial was severely compromised causing permanent\n\nloss of their substantial rights. In addition, Texas citizens and taxpayers are entitled to know\n\nwhether PISD's good faith defense under TOMA 551.056(d) was a fraud on them and on the\n\nappeals court and this Court.    Post-remand discovery would have determined that question\n\nproperly and would have advanced the cause of open government. This Court should not close\n\nits eyes to the important purpose of Open Government under TOMA.\n\n        12. The Court erred in ruling for defendant PISD on the grounds that\n\n        a) Non-compliance with TOMA Sec. 551.056(b) was excused because legally required\n\nwebsite notices \"appeared on Google\" or were \"available on Google,\" for public and\n\n        b) Terrell attended the 3/26/20009 board meeting, spoke at the board meeting and was\n\naware of the proposed termination of her contract.\n\n        Both grounds Court cited in ruling for PISD are completely irrelevant as a matter of law\n\nand must be disregarded and have no legal support whatsoever either statutorily in TOMA or in\n\ncase law. TOMA mandates that the internet website notices for a government body's board\n\nmeetings must appear concurrently on the government body's website. See TOMA 551.056(b).\n\nThere is no legal support for the proposition that the website notices can appear \"on Google\" and\n\nmeet the requirements of Sec. 551.056(b) or (d). PISD's website notices appearing \"on Google,\"\n\n\n\n\nMotion for New Trial                  Cause No. 35621                          Page 21 of24\n                                               352\n\f•   353\n\n\n\n\n    even if true, is legally irrelevant in meeting the good faith exception under Sec. 551.056(d).\n\n    Testimony by Jameson in this regard is hearsay and speculation and must be disregarded.\n\n            Similarly, the case law is clearly established - Texas Open Meetings Act is not a scheme\n\n    to provide due process to individuals. The Open Meetings Act is not a legislative scheme for\n\n    service of process; it has no due process implications. Rather, its purpose is to provide \"openness\n\n    at every stage of [a governmental body's] deliberations.\" Acker v.

Thus it is legally irrelevant whether or not plaintiffs Terrell and Thanedar knew\n\n    about the 3/26/2009 board meeting and whether they attended the meeting or not. The Court\n\n    should not make new law in this regard.\n\n            Concerning findings of fact made by the Court, there is either no evidence or insufficient\n\n    evidence to support them or they are not legally relevant or material. For example, there is no\n\n    evidence or insufficient evidence that PISD ever paid license fee or renewal fee for service to\n\n    BoardBook or SchoolCenter as PISD refused and failed to produce such information in response\n\n    to discovery requests by plaintiffs. To the contrary, BoardBook draft contract (PX31) clearly\n\n    states that unless license fee is paid or purchase order provided, the contract would not be\n\n    effective. See PX31. PISD provided no such evidence at trial. As explained before, PISD's\n\n    bare opinion at trial in this regard is not legal evidence. See Kindred, /d. At trial, PISD's\n\n    testimony concerning SchoolCenter was purposefully misleading, evasive, and obstructive hence\n\n    must be deemed not credible.\n\n            Concerning conclusions of law made by the Court there is simply no evidence in support\n\n    or insufficient evidence in support of them. For example, there is no evidence or insufficient\n\n    evidence that internet notices independently appeared on either BoardBook website or on\n\n\n\n\n    Motion for New Trial                   Cause No. 35621                         Page22 of24\n                                                    353\n\f•\n    354\n\n\n\n\n    Google. In addition, such evidence even if established would be legally irrelevant as there is no\n\n    statutory support nor case authority in support for such proposition. The Court's finding of fact\n\n    and conclusion of law that an unnamed third party vendor was at \"fault\" is legally invalid as the\n\n    Court does not even identify the name of the vendor, certainly because there is no evidence or\n\n    insufficient evidence as shown above that said link even existed on PISD's OLD website before\n\n    the alleged unnamed third party vendor generated the new website. Plaintiffs refer to paragraph\n\n    3 above and repeat it herein. There is no evidence or insufficient evidence for Court's finding\n\n    and conclusion that new website was created in January 2009. There is conclusive evidence\n\n    because of PISD's admission in this case that said link did not exist on PISD's old website in\n\n    January 2009 when 1115/2009 board meeting notice did not appear on PISD's website in\n\n    violation of Sec. 551.056(b). There is no evidence or insufficient evidence that a third party\n\n    vendor was at fault for not transferring said link to the new website and there is conclusive or\n\n    sufficient or overwhelming evidence that PISD removed the link itself because it believed it was\n\n    not \"necessary.\" See PX 32.\n\n            For the above reasons, the trial on 10/9/2013 was tarnished by new allegations of facts\n\n    introduced for the first time in 4 112 years in violation of discovery rules, gross hearsay in\n\n    violation of evidence rules presented and admitted as evidence over plaintiffs' objections,\n\n    defendant's unseemly defamatory tactics against plaintiffs by introducing irrelevant matters into\n\n    evidence in violation of rules of evidence to create bias in the record and before this judge, all of\n\n    which resulted in trial by ambush and in miscarriage of justice. The trial was neither fair nor\n\n    impartial. Thus the judgment should be set aside and new trial ordered on all causes of action in\n\n    the interest of justice and good cause.\n\n\n\n\n    Motion for New Trial                      Cause No. 35621                        Page 23 of24\n                                                       354\n\f355\n\n\n\n\n                                               Prayer\n\n        FOR THE FOREGOING REASONS, and in the interest of justice, fairness, and good\n\ncause, plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court vacate the judgment and vacate the award of\n\nattorney fees and costs entered in this case, set this motion for hearing, conduct an evidentiary\n\nhearing on newly discovered evidence, grant this motion, and grant new trial on all causes of\n\naction.

Plaintiffs refer to their motion for new trial including all its appendices 1 through 6,\n\n    timely filed on November 21, 2013 which is adopted and incorporated as if set forth verbatim\n\n    herein. Plaintiffs have attached their affidavit hereto concerning this motion as appendix 6.\n\n    Judgment is incorrect in stating that plaintiffs announced ready. Plaintiffs requested continuance\n\n    of trial only which was denied. The judgment should be corrected in this regard.\n\n            2. Court erred and clearly abused its discretion in granting award of attorney fees of\n\n    $30,000 to PISD and costs. The judgment should be modified and the award of attorney fees and\n\n    costs should be vacated and denied. Plaintiffs challenge the award of the attorney fees on the\n\n    grounds that the award is 1) not reasonable, manifestly too large, and 2) neither legally valid, nor\n\n    proper, nor justified in this case.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    379\n\f380\n\n\n\n\n       The Court clearly erred in granting $30,000 in attorney fees to PISD by taking \"judicial\n\nnotice of the file\" as asked by PISD. Texas law regarding attorney fees is clear and well\n\nestablished. Texas law has not allowed recovery of attorney fees unless allowed by statute or\n\ncontract. \"Absent a contract or statute, trial courts do not have inherent authority to require a\n\nlosing party to pay the prevailing party's fees.\" Tony Gullo Motors v.

Nothing in TOMA or its pertinent case authority authorizes or empowers\n\nthe Court to take judicial notice of attorney fees and to award them without receiving evidence.\n\nSee TOMA Sec. 551.142. 1 Plaintiffs challenge the imposition of attorney fees as legally\n\nimproper and further challenge the reasonableness of attorney fees awarded to PISD.             The\n\nreasonableness of attorneys' fees is question of fact that must be proven at the trial. City of\n\nGarland v.

Thus PISD was required to testify\n\nconcerning its attorney fees and reasonableness of the fees. PISD refused and failed to testify on\n\nits attorney fees and refused and failed to prove them. Therefore PISD forfeited and waived any\n\nclaim to attorney fees. Because PISD refused and failed to prove and testify on its attorney fees,\n\nthere is no evidence or insufficient evidence in the record for the Court to award attorney fees to\n\nPISD. Court's award of $30,000 has no basis in law or evidence because there is no evidence or\n\ninsufficient evidence of tasks completed, hours worked, timesheets, billing statements, level of\n\n\n1\n  TOMA Section 551.142 provides as follows:\n(a) An interested person, including a member of the news media, may bring an action by\nmandamus or injunction to stop, prevent, or reverse a violation or threatened violation of this\nchapter by members of a governmental body.\n(b) The court may assess costs of litigation and reasonable attorney fees incurred by a plaintiff or\ndefendant who substantially prevails in an action under Subsection (a). In exercising its\ndiscretion, the court shall consider whether the action was brought in good faith and whether the\nconduct of the governmental body had a reasonable basis in law.\n\n\nMotion to Modify Judgment              Cause No. 35621                           Page 2 oflO\n                                                380\n\f381\n\n\n\n\ndifficulty, identity of attorneys, reasonable hourly rates of attorneys on the case and other\n\nnecessary information on which attorney fees must be based on and can be determined.\n\n       The Court granted the award of attorney fees under TOMA Sec. 551.152. Thus it is\n\nclearly ascertainable that the award of attorney fees in this case does not arise under Texas Civil\n\nPractice and Remedies Code (CPRC) Section 38.001, thus this Court does not have power to\n\ntake judicial notice of attorney fees under Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code§ 38.004. See Valdez v.\n\nValdez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1662563\"><a href=\"/opinion/1662563/valdez-v-valdez/\"><span class=\"volume\">930</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">725</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 732-33 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 1996, no writ) (holding section\n\n38.004 only applies to claims under section 38.001). Therefore, attorney fees award here is\n\nlegally improper.    Further the attorney fees award is improper here because plaintiffs have\n\nundisputedly proven their good faith at the trial as their report of the violation of Sec. 551.056(b)\n\nwas the only reason said violation was finally corrected by PISD after 5 months of non-\n\ncompliance with TOMA from 112009 to 5/19/2009. PX 8-11. Further this court sitting by\n\nassignment has no personal knowledge of all of the proceedings in this case, being the third\n\njudge in this case after Judge Waters and Judge Vanderpool. Further plaintiffs do not have the\n\nability to pay attorney fees, thus award is not reasonable. PISD did not plead in its original or\n\nthe amended answer the required prerequisites to attorney fees as required by TOMA Sec.\n\n551.142. PISD's first amended answer is defective as it does not contain a proper certificate of\n\nservice under TRCP and PISD failed to answer plaintiffs' second supplemental petition.\n\n       This Court has no authority or power under TOMA and no inherent authority or power to\n\nimpose attorney fees for any proceedings or filing in the appellate courts, with or without\n\nevidence being received. Defendant has provided no statutory support or case authority for it.\n\nFurther there is no evidence or insufficient evidence of filings by plaintiffs in the appellate court\n\non which to base attorney fees award on by this Court. Defendant made no argument at trial\n\n\n\n\nMotion to ModifY Judgment               Cause No. 35621                           Page 3   oflO\n                                                 381\n\f382\n\n\n\n\nconcerning its attorney fees to be based on appellate filings by plaintiffs. There is no evidence or\n\ninsufficient evidence that PISD made any responses to plaintiffs' appellate filings and that they\n\nwere accepted by appeals court. In fact, defendant's responses have been rejected by appeals\n\ncourt. In addition, plaintiffs prevailed on appeal in this case and the case was remanded back to\n\ntrial court.   Court's finding that plaintiffs made voluminous filings is legally immaterial,\n\narbitrary, and capricious because plaintiffs prevailed on appeal and defendant's responses were\n\nfound defective by appeals court. Thus there is no basis in law or fact for an award of attorney\n\nfees to PISD because plaintiffs' made filings in appeals court.        Further the court failed to\n\nsegregate appeals court's portion of the attorney fees from trial court portion of the award of\n\nattorney fees and attorney fees before remand and after remand. Since, plaintiffs prevailed on\n\nappeal and were awarded costs by appeals court, no attorney fees and costs for proceedings\n\nbefore remand can be or should be awarded to PISD.\n\n        The attempt by PISD for attorney fees is a bald attempt to intimidate plaintiffs in not\n\nfiling an appeal of this Court's judgment. Such an attempt is an outrageous affront to the purpose\n\nof open government under TOMA and will have chilling effect on citizens and taxpayers who\n\nreport violations of TOMA and seek redress. Further, issues and violations of TOMA before this\n\nCourt in this case are novel and there have not been cases involving electronic properties of\n\nboard meeting notices involving Sec. 551.056(b) and (d), technical problems, and burden of\n\nproof. This is clearly a case of first impression in these evolving legal areas. Attorney fee award\n\nthus is unjustified here and if not reversed will have chilling effect on citizens and will lead to\n\nconfusion and lack of development of the areas mentioned above. Further, government bodies\n\nwill emulate the tactics of PISD to intimidate citizens in to submission which will lead to\n\nevisceration of TOMA. PISD refused to testify and prove its attorney fees before this Court (or\n\n\n\n\nMotion to Modify Judgment              Cause No. 35621                           Page 4 oflO\n                                                382\n\f383\n\n\n\n\nappeals court), this Court failed to receive evidence concerning attorney fees, thus PISD waived\n\nand forfeited attorney fees.\n\n        Further, it is clearly ascertainable that PISD did not respond to plaintiffs' motions or\n\nletters in this Court whether or not they were \"voluminous,\" thus there is no evidence that PISD\n\never incurred attorney fees or insufficient evidence that PISD ever incurred attorney fees and to\n\nwhat extent with respect to PISD's complaints about plaintiffs filings. Further, plaintiffs cannot\n\nbe penalized or sanctioned for filing lawsuits or for their filings whether or not they were\n\nvoluminous as they a have constitutional right to seek redress of their grievances. The plain fact\n\nis there is no evidence or insufficient evidence of PISD spending any time on plaintiffs' \"filings\"\n\nin this Court or in appeals court.\n\n       An attorney fees award based on no evidence of existence and reasonableness of attorney\n\nfees viz. identity of attorneys, hours worked, tasks performed, quality and difficulty of work,\n\nhourly rate and other factors; or insufficient evidence of existence viz. identity of attorneys,\n\nhours worked, tasks performed, quality and difficulty of work, hourly rate and other factors\n\nviolates plaintiffs' constitutional rights of   due process and equal protection under Texas\n\nConstitution and 14th Amendment to the Unites States Constitution as such arbitrary and\n\ncapricious and manifestly too large and unreasonable imposition of attorney fees has no support\n\nin law or case authority. Therefore imposition of attorney fees without legal support under\n\nTOMA and without receiving evidence is not only a clear abuse of discretion but is abusive to\n\nTexas citizens and taxpayers such as plaintiffs. PISD did not offer argument at trial or in its\n\npleadings about whether plaintiffs brought this suit in good faith or being a prevailing party, or\n\nwhether its actions had a reasonable basis in law on all causes of action brought by plaintiffs.\n\nSee Sec. 551.142. PISD failed to plead prerequisites to attorney fees in its amended answer.\n\n\n\n\nMotion to Modify Judgment              Cause No. 35621                          Page 5 oflO\n                                                383\n\f384\n\n\n\n\nSec. 551.142. PISD's first amended answer is defective as it does not have proper certificate of\n\nservice under TRCP. Plaintiffs adopt and incorporate by reference their response to defendant's\n\nfirst amended answer and plaintiffs' special exceptions and affirmative defense to defendant's\n\nrequest for attorney fees and costs (which are on file) as if set forth verbatim herein.\n\n         As explained before, there is clear undisputed evidence of good faith on the part of\n\nplaintiffs in this case, thus imposition of costs is improper and unreasonable. See TOMA Sec.\n\n551.142. PX 8-11. C. Plaintiffs challenge imposition of costs on them. Plaintiffs have clearly\n\ndemonstrated good faith as shown above under TOMA. Thus under TOMA sec. 51.142, costs\n\nshould not be imposed on plaintiffs. Further even if costs were imposed, costs before remand\n\nshould be segregated from costs after remand and such costs before remand should be excluded\n\nfrom costs to be awarded to PISD. This is proper because plaintiffs prevailed on appeal before\n\nthe   th court of appeal and the appeals court granted costs to plaintiffs. Any costs associated with\nPISD's misguided summary judgment motion which was erroneously granted by the district\n\ncourt (Judge Waters) should be excluded from costs. PISD offered no evidence of lack of good\n\nfaith on the part of plaintiffs and did not even offer an argument on it. Thus there is no evidence\n\nor insufficient evidence of lack of good faith or bad faith in the record on the part of plaintiffs.\n\n         This Court which is sitting by assignment did not hold any proceeding before October\n\n2012 when two other Judges (Judge Vanderpool and Judge Waters) presided over the case. The\n\nCourt thus cannot take judicial notice of matters it is not knowledgeable about and which did not\n\noccur before it. Further, plaintiffs challenge the reasonableness of the attorney fees because the\n\ncurrent judge (Judge Lopez) only held one proceeding on 10/9/2013 for one day trial. PISD filed\n\nno response to several motions filed by plaintiffs. Thus PISD cannot recover attorney fees for\n\ntime it did not expend for one year in responding to plaintiffs' motions. Under Judge Vanderpool\n\n\n\n\nMotion to Modify Judgment                Cause No. 35621                            Page 6   oflO\n                                                  384\n\f385\n\n\n\n\nonly two brief hearings took place and PISD failed to file any responses to plaintiffs' motions.\n\nUnder Judge Waters only 1 brief hearing occurred. It is thus obvious, that in more than 4 years\n\nof this lawsuit, only minimal activity has occurred. Attorney fees in the amount of $30,000 are\n\nthus manifestly too large and unreasonable considering the lack of PISD's responses and only 3\n\nhearings and a 1 day trial.\n\n        Further, it is clearly ascertainable from the few responses PISD filed that they were\n\nunserious, lacked references to record, and failed to cite pertinent applicable case authorities.\n\nSome of the responses were found defective by the       th Court of appeals e.g. lacked proper\ncertificates of service and certificates of compliance and PISD was forced tore-file. The quality\n\nof the PISD's filings has been questionable. Thus the $30,000 attorney fees are unreasonable.\n\nThis Court cannot grant attorney fees for proceedings conducted in appellate court in which\n\nplaintiffs were granted costs of appeal on remand. Further plaintiffs prevailed on appeal before\n\nthe   th court of appeals, thus attorney fees and costs before remand of the case must be\nsegregated and excluded from any calculations of attorney fees that could possibly be awarded to\n\nPISD. Given the lack of evidence, it is not surprising that PISD counsel refused to testify\n\nconcerning attorney fees at trial.   As such, there is no evidence, alternatively insufficient\n\nevidence for this Court to base its award of attorney fees. Thus the award of attorney fees and\n\ncosts is legally improper, manifestly too large, unreasonable, and completely unsupported by\n\nevidence and should be vacated and denied. The judgment of the Court should be modified\n\naccordingly.\n\n3.      As explained previously, the Court erred in denying plaintiffs' motions to exclude\n\nevidence concerning SchoolCenter, BoardBook, and Lee Carter. The record clearly shows that\n\nPISD repeatedly refused, misled, obstructed discovery and further refused to supplement its\n\n\n\n\nMotion to ModifY Judgment             Cause No. 35621                          Page 7 oflO\n                                               385\n\f386\n\n\n\n\nanswers to interrogatories and other discovery requests concerning BoardBook service. See PX\n\n8-11. PISD even obstructed and misled the Attorney General of Texas when it knew that PISD\n\nallegedly had made payments to BoardBook and SchoolCenter and others for services. These\n\nand other records concerning SchoolCenter and BoardBook and other employees ot vendors such\n\nas Lee Carter should have been produced in the discovery process. PISD refused to do so\n\napparently fearing no sanctions for its obstruction. PISD even declared that BoardBook service\n\nand PISD's contract with it were irrelevant and outside of the purview of Texas Rules of Civil\n\nProcedure. Plaintiffs adopt and incorporate by reference Plaintiffs' Motion for Sanctions which\n\nwas filed on 9/9/2009 and their Motion for Order to Produce Documents without Objection filed\n\non 6/9/2009, Plaintiffs' Motion for Ruling Post-Remand Discovery, to Exclude, for Inferences,\n\nto Compel discovery from defendant, and For Sanctions Filed on 6/5/12, as if set forth verbatim\n\nherein. The Court's refusal to exclude set up plaintiffs for trial by ambush and surprise which\n\nviolates their due process, open courts, and equal protection rights under Texas Constitution and\n\nthe 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n\n          4. PISD's trial evidence in its support was no more than speculation, hearsay, surmise\n\nand bare opinions offering no substantiation or documents in support, which is no legal evidence\n\nat all.    Kindred v. Con/Chem., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1502558\"><a href=\"/opinion/1502558/kindred-v-conchem-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">650</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">61</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 63 (Tex. 1983). PISD's evidence in its\n\nsupport must be struck and disregarded.\n\n          5.     As explained before, PISD did not carry its Burden of Proof in the matter of\n\nshowing good faith under TOMA Sec. 551.056(d). PISD admitted that its website notices did\n\nnot appear on its website for 11 meetings from 1/15/2009 to 5119/2009 for 5 long months. PISD\n\nfails the average person's due diligence standard here. After \"forgetting\" to check whether\n\ninternet notice for its 1115/2009 meeting actually appeared on its website, PISD continued to\n\n\n\n\nMotion to ModifY Judgment              Cause No. 35621                         Page 8 of 10\n                                                386\n\f387\n\n\n\n\n\"forget\" to check its website for 5 months to see whether it was complying with TOMA. \"Opps\n\nwe forgot\" and \"Oops we don't care to check\" fail average person's good faith standard and\n\ncertainly fail under TOMA Sec. 551.056(d) good faith standard. Negligence, forgetting is not a\n\ntechnical problem as PISD suggests and is certainly not beyond the control of PISD for 5\n\nmonths.\n\n       The judgment of the Court should be modified as requested below.\n\n                                              Prayer\n\n       FOR THE FOREGOING REASONS, plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court set this\n\nmotion for hearing, and upon hearing, grant plaintiffs' motion to modify judgment, modify\n\njudgment in accordance with this motion, and\n\n       Vacate the award of attorney fees in the amount of $30,000 to defendant PISD, vacate the\n\naward of costs to PISD, deny defendant's request for attorney fees and costs, and delay the award\n\nof attorney fees and costs until appellate process is completed.\n\n       Further plaintiffs request judgment be modified so that the judgment for defendant is set\n\naside and judgment for plaintiffs is entered on all causes of action, void all actions taken in\n\nviolation of TOMA, order reinstatement of Terrell as a teacher with defendant and award\n\ndamages of back wages and benefits to her, declare plaintiffs the prevailing party in this suit, and\n\ngrant all other relief requested by plaintiffs in their original petition and two supplemental\n\npetitions. Plaintiffs further request that Court grant all other and further relief, at law or in\n\nequity, to which they may justly be entitled to receive.\n\n                                                       Respectfully submitted,\n\n\n\n\n                                                       Rebecca Terrell\n\n\nMotion to Modify Judgment               Cause No. 35621                          Page 9 of 10\n                                                 387\n\f    388\n\n\n\n\nI                                                      Chandrashekhar Thanedar\n                                                       Plaintiffs\n                                                       6503 Dancing Ct.\n                                                       San Antonio, Texas 78244\n                                                       (956) 445-3107\n                                                       (512) 271-6840 Fax\n                                                       rterrell152@gmail.com\n\n                                  CERTIFICATE OF SERVICE\n\n           The undersigned certify that a true and correct copy of the foregoing document was\n\n    served upon the following by USPS Priority Mail on November 22, 2013 to\n\n    W.

We further request that the court reconsider its refusal to hold hearing on the\n\n                  newly discovered evidence as presented in the motion for new trial.

See Tex. R. Civ. Pro. 329b. We further request that the court\n\n                  provide and explain its reasons as to why it denied said motions so its decisions can be fully\n\n                  understood by parties so as to allow a meaningful appeal of this court's decisions and actions\n\n                  before the 7th court of appeals.\n\n                          1. Violation of Plaintiffs' Federal and Texas Constitutional Rights:                                       The record\n\n                  shows that this court, without any basis in fact or law, wrongly declared at trial that the appeals\n\n                  court only wanted trial on Sec. 551.056 of Texas Open Meetings Act (TOMA). This court then\n\n\n\n\n                                                                          403\n\fFrom: R Terrell         Fax: (512) 271-6840       To: Sandra Burkett     Fax: +1 (806) 669-805 3   Page 3 of 8 0210512014 10:08\n\n                  404\n\n\n\n\n                  denied and failed to hold trial on plaintiffs' other causes of action i.e. TOMA sections 551.041,\n\n                  551.051, 551.043, 551.045, 551.074, and 551.101. It is abundantly clear that the 7th court of\n\n                  appeals made no such ruling in its opinion on the first appeal in this case. This was pointed out\n\n                  to this court and plaintiffs have objected to the court's arbitrary declaration and refusal to hold\n\n                  trial on the above causes. This improper denial and failure violates plaintiffs' civil rights,\n\n                  fundamental rights, and federal Constitutional due process and equal rights under the 14th\n\n                  Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and violation of our rights under Texas Constitution Article\n\n                  1 Sections 3, 13, 19, and 27. This court closed it doors to plaintiffs by refusing to hold trial on\n\n                  plaintiffs' complaints under TOMA sections 551.041, 551.051, 551.043, 551.045, 551.074, and\n\n                  551.101 in violation of our constitutional rights. No objection to such plain blatant error and\n\n                  constitutional violation need be made, nor required. Such refusal and denial lowers the regard of\n\n                  Texas and United States Citizens towards the judges and the justice system. We as citizens and\n\n                  tax payers are greatly troubled that after 5 long years of being gamed, drawn out, punished, and\n\n                  impoverished, we got deprived of our constitutional and fundamental rights. What is the point in\n\n                  filing complaints if courts will ignore the citizens? We request the court to grant new trial on all\n\n                  matters and hear the newly discovered evidence presented in the motion for new trial.\n\n                          The record of the trial shows that this court refused and failed to rule on plaintiffs' certain\n\n                  trial exhibits during trial (e.g. plaintiffs' trial exhibit 1 concerning internet notices of meetings\n\n                  and their electronic properties) stating that court will rule on them later at some other time.\n\n                  Plaintiffs repeatedly objected and offered proof. This court attempted to rule, deny, and return\n\n                  the trial exhibits to plaintiffs outside of trial, after the trial was over and after the court had\n\n                  rendered judgment. We are greatly troubled by these actions of the court which were highly\n\n                  damaging and prejudicial to plaintiffs. Such actions lower citizens' regard for the judiciary.\n\n\n\n\n                  Motion for Reconsideration                 Cause No. 35621                                    Page 2 of7\n                                                                       404\n\fFrom: R Terrell          Fax: (512) 271-6840       To: Sandra Burkett     Fax: +1 (806) 669-8053   Page 4 of 8 0210512014 10:08\n\n                  405\n\n\n\n\n                  Court's refusal to rule on plaintiffs' certain trial exhibits during trial of this case infected the trial\n\n                  with chaos and confusion, greatly harming plaintiffs' case because plaintiffs were prevented\n\n                  from properly and effectively presenting their case. Court's actions above were arbitrary without\n\n                  any basis in law, biased for the defendant and violated our constitutional due process and equal\n\n                  protection rights under Texas Constitution (Art.l, Sees. 3, 13, 19,27) and the U.S. Constitution.\n\n                           The court wrongly permitted testimony over our repeated objections on a \"third party\n\n                  vendor\" which defendant claimed as allegedly causing legal violation of TOMA Sec. 551.056.\n\n                  As we have contended, such new evidence must be excluded because defendant PISD\n\n                  deliberately refused to provide discovery and deliberately refused and failed to supplement\n\n                  discovery with respect to the purported \"third party vendor.\" As explained previously, we are\n\n                  entitled to discovery and supplementation according to the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. See\n\n                  TRCP Rule 193.5, 193.6. This court should have excluded the testimony and should have\n\n                  granted new trial to obtain discovery concerning the \"third party vendor.\" Court's failure to do\n\n                  so was highly prejudicial and damaging to plaintiffs as we were prevented from effectively\n\n                  examining the witnesses and were prevented from presenting our side effectively. The court's\n\n                  failure to exclude evidence or allow discovery on the new evidence made the trial a trial by\n\n                  surprise and ambush violating our rights of equal rights and due process under Texas\n\n                  Constitution (Art. 1, Sees. 3,13,19,27) and 14th Amend. to U.S. Constitution. This is the reason\n\n                  why the case was remanded in the first place by the 7th Court.\n\n                           As explained in our motion to modifY judgment and motion for new trial above, it is clear\n\n                  that the Texas Open Meetings Act does not authorize this court to take ''judicial notice\" of\n\n                   defendant's attorney fees without receiving evidence as to the amount or reasonableness and\n\n                   further that court's award of fees is improper under TOMA. TOMA Sec. 551.142. There is\n\n\n\n\n                   Motion for Reconsideration                 Cause No. 35621                                   Page 3 of7\n                                                                        405\n\fFrom: R Terrell         Fax: (512) 271-6840       To: Sandra Burkett         Fax: +1 (806) 669-8053   Page 5 of 8 0210512014 10:08\n\n                  406\n\n\n\n\n                  absolutely no evidence in the record as to the reasonableness of the $30,000 the court granted\n\n                  PISD in attorney fees or the hours worked, tasks performed, and rates per hour, and by whom.\n\n                  Court's award of attorney fees of $30,000 under TOMA1 is arbitrary, capricious, punitive, and\n\n                  legally improper. Court's award violates plaintiffs' due process rights and equal rights under the\n\n                  Texas Constitution Article 1 Sections 3, 13, 19, and 27 and the 14th Amendment to the U.S.\n\n                  Constitution as we are entitled to the due process and equal rights of contesting the\n\n                  reasonableness of attorney fees awarded to defendant by examining and questioning defendant's\n\n                  attorney and any records proving the existence and reasonableness of the $30,000 award. We\n\n                  object to the attorney fee award because it has no basis in law, because it arbitrary, and because it\n\n                  is punitive in nature. Attorney fees are not mandatory, but if awarded under TOMA, TOMA\n\n                  only permits \"reasonable\" attorney fees and the reasonableness must be proven at trial. See\n\n                  TOMA Sec. 551.142. The language of TOMA is plain and clear that it does not authorize this\n\n                  court to award punitive attorney fees and does not permit a judge to be an advocate for defendant\n\n                  and for defendant's attorney fees. Here, this court granted attorney fees under TOMA, and not\n\n                  under the Texas Civil Practices and Remedies Code (TCPRC), thus TCPRC Sec. 38 does not\n\n                  apply here. Further, defendant waived and forfeited its claim to attorney fees when it expressly\n\n                  declined to testifY concerning its request for attorney fees.                         Defendant's subsequent\n\n                  correspondence with us makes it clear that its only interest was to stop the appeal currently\n\n                  before the 7th COA. This court should grant this motion and reverse its judgment with respect to\n\n                  the award of attorney fees to PISD, and grant new trial on the issue of attorney fees. The record\n\n\n                  1\n                    PISD's alleges its claim for attorney fees under TOMA Sec. 551.142. The award of attorneys' fees in\n                  this case does not arise under Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code (CPRC) section 38.001, thus this\n                  Court does not have power to take judicial notice of attorney fees under Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code §\n                  38.004. See Valdez v.

PISD must be required under law, and TOMA\n\n                  requires that PISD prove its attorney fees at trial. Defendant refused to do so. Further judicial\n\n                  efficiency requires that award of attorney fees be delayed until appellate process is concluded.\n\n                           The court failed to provide detailed reasons as to why it found that we acted in bad faith\n\n                  when defendant presented no evidence or testimony at trial to show whether we brought the suit\n\n                  in bad faith. Court's detailed reasoning in this regard would assist the court of appeals and\n\n                  parties in arguing the reasons in a meaningful way before the 7th court of appeals. Defendant\n\n                  presented no evidence of bad faith or lack of good faith on our part in bringing this suit.                        The\n\n                  only evidence presented at the trial in this regard by us clearly showed that defendant's 5 month\n\n                  long legal violations of TOMA Sec. 551.056(b) got corrected only because of our report to\n\n                  defendant in that regard on May 15, 2009. How is this lack of good faith? This court held only\n\n                  one day hearing (final trial) in this case and lacks any personal knowledge of prior proceedings.\n\n                  Under TOMA, evidence and testimony at trial on \"bad faith\" or lack of good faith on our part in\n\n                  bringing suit and reasonableness and existence of the amount of attorney fees was absolutely\n\n                  necessary so plaintiffs would have the chance to examine, question, and challenge such\n\n                  testimony and evidence. This court cannot just assume or advocate for defendant concerning\n\n                  award of attorney fees or a lack of good faith. TOMA Sec. 551.142. Court's finding ofbad faith\n\n                  in bringing this suit and award of attorney fees is not only arbitrary, capricious and without basis\n\n                  in law or evidence, but it is biased for defendant and punishes and victimizes plaintiffs by further\n\n                  depriving us of due process and equal rights under the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution\n\n                  and Texas Constitution Article 1 Sections 3, 13, 19, and 27.

Pursuant to TRCP Rule 298, plaintiffs\n\n                  now request the following additional or amended findings of fact and conclusions oflaw be filed.\n\n                          Plaintiffs affirm that to the extent any Finding of Fact reflects a legal conclusion, it shall\n\n                  be to that extent deemed a Conclusion of Law, and vice versa.\n\n                                              ADDITIONAL OR AMENDED FINDINGS OF FACT\n\n                          1.     On October 9, 2013, at the trial in this case Court directed defendant Pampa\n\n                  Independent School District's (defendant or PISD) attorneys to testifY in the matter of\n\n                  defendant's claim for attorney fees as to the amount and reasonableness of attorney fees.\n\n\n\n                                                                          391\n\fFrom: R Terrell          Fax: (512) 271·6840         To: Sandra Burkett         Fax: +1 iS06) 669-8053   Page 3 of 1012102/2013 4:18\n\n                  392\n\n\n\n\n                  Defendant's attorney Mr. Arnold declined and failed to do so and asked the Court to take judicial\n\n                  notice of the file and award attorney fees to ·defendant.\n\n                           2. There is no evidence or insufficient evidence of defendant's claim for attorney fees for\n\n                   $30,000 or for any amount, its appropriateness, or its reasonableness.\n\n                           3. Plaintiffs' reported defendant's non-compliance with Texas Open Meetings Act\n\n                  (TOMA) Sec. 551.056(b) to defendant on May 15, 2009 and their report was the only reason said\n\n                  non-compliance was corrected after 5 months of non-compliance with TOMA by defendant.\n\n                   Plaintiffs' good faith was not disputed by defendant at trial. Defendant did not offer evidence of\n\n                   lack of good faith. There is no evidence that plaintiffs' brought this action in bad faith. To the\n\n                   contrary, plaintiffs prevailed on appeal in this lawsuit and the appeals court ordered defendant to\n\n                   pay costs in this case to plaintiffs. Plaintiffs' case clearly has merit. As a result of this lawsuit,\n\n                   defendant made several changes and reformed its practices to ensure compliance with TOMA.\n\n                   The record in this case shows that defendant mostly did not file responses to plaintiffs' motions\n\n                   or filings. There is no evidence or insufficient evidence that plaintiffs made voluminous filings\n\n                   or that they were not necessary to prosecute the case. Thus, there is no evidence of time spent by\n\n                   PISD on responding to plaintiffs motions either before trial court or appellate court. The Court\n\n                   finds that appeals court rejected PISD's filings and such filings often lacked compliance with\n\n                   appellate rules e.g. citation to record or legal authorities. There have been three judges who have\n\n                   presided over this case and this Court held no proceedings before the trial on October 9, 2013.\n\n                           4.    Court declined to rule on admissibility of plaintiffs' trial exhibits PX 1 (CD of\n\n                   electronic notices and document properties of 22 meetings at issue in this trial), 19, 20, 23, and\n\n                   25 during the trial. Court rules that said trial exhibits PX 1, 19, 20, 23, and 25 are now admitted.\n\n\n\n\n                   Request for Additional or Amended                Cause No. 35621                                     Page 2 of9\n                   Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\n                                                                          392\n\fFrom: R Terrell         Fax: (512) 271-6840          To: Sandra Burkett         Fax: +1 (806i 669-8053   Page 4 of 1012/0212013 4:18\n\n                  393\n\n\n\n\n                          5. PISD admitted at trial that internet notice for its 1115/2009 board meeting did not\n\n                  appear on its website. However, there is no evidence or insufficient evidence that defendant\n\n                  employed SchoolCenter to create a new website and or to transfer link to its internet notices to a\n\n                  new website before said meeting on 1115/2009.\n\n                          6. Defendant's claim that it employed SchoolCenter to create a new website, to transfer\n\n                  link to notices was made for the first time at trial. Defendant did not disclose this information\n\n                  during discovery process to plaintiffs, nor did it timely correct or supplement its discovery\n\n                  responses in this regard before trial under Texas Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\n                          7. Defendant maintained and managed its own website and posted website internet\n\n                  notices under TOMA Sec. 551.056(b) through at least January 15, 2009. There is no evidence or\n\n                  insufficient evidence that a link to BoardBook existed on defendant's website on or before\n\n                  January 15, 2009 or that internet notices under Sec. 551.056(b) appeared on defendant's website\n\n                  before defendant employed a third party vendor- SchoolCenter. Because PISD admitted that the\n\n                  internet notice for 1115/2009 did not appear on its website, Court finds that the link to internet\n\n                  notices did not exist on PISD's website before PISD allegedly employed SchoolCenter to create\n\n                  a new website.\n\n                          8. There is no evidence or insufficient evidence that defendant had BoardBook service to\n\n                  post internet notices under TOMA sec. 551.056(b) or payments to BoardBook for its service.\n\n                  There is no evidence or insufficient evidence that defendant executed a contract with BoardBook\n\n                  or that such contract was ever renewed, especially before or during the time period for which\n\n                  defendant claims good faith exception under Sec. 551.056(d).\n\n                          9. Defendant claimed at trial that it contracted a third party vendor SchoolCenter to\n\n                  create a new website and transfer link to internet notices. There is no evidence or insufficient\n\n\n\n                  Request for Additional or Amended                 Cause No. 35621                                     Page 3 of9\n                  Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\n                                                                          393\n\fFrom: R Terrell         Fax: (512) 271-6840          To: Sandra Burkett         Fax: +1 i806J 669-8053   Page 5 of 101210212013 4:18\n\n                  394\n\n\n\n\n                  evidence that defendant contracted a third party vendor School Center to create a new website for\n\n                  defendant or transfer or maintain a link to internet notices to the new website before the time\n\n                  period for which defendant claims good faith exception under Sec. 551.056(d).\n\n                          10. Defendant admitted that it did not comply with Sec.551.056(b) for 11 board meetings\n\n                  held from January 15, 2009 through May 19, 2009.\n\n                          11. Defendant maintained and managed its website through January 15, 2009 board\n\n                  meeting, however it did not comply with Sec.551.056(b) for the January 15, 2009 board meeting.\n\n                  Further, there is no evidence or insufficient evidence that defendant's new website was created\n\n                  72 hours before defendant's January 15, 2009 board meeting. Further there is no evidence that\n\n                  SchoolCenter was employed to create new website before the January 15, 2009 board meeting.\n\n                          12.      Plaintiffs (plaintiff Thanedar) reported to defendant on May 15, 2009 that\n\n                  defendant's internet board meeting notices did not appear on its website. Defendant fixed its\n\n                  non-compliance with TOMA due to plaintiffs' said report of non-compliance.\n\n                          13. There is no evidence or insufficient evidence that defendant verified or checked that\n\n                  its internet board meeting notices actually appeared on its website during the period from\n\n                  January 2009 through May 15, 2009.\n\n                          14. There is no evidence or insufficient evidence that defendant verified that it actually\n\n                  complied with TOMA Sec. 551.056(b) during the 5 month period for which it claims good faith\n\n                  exception under Sec. 551.056(d) until plaintiffs reported non-compliance on 5/15/2009.\n\n                          15. Lee Carter was PISD's webmaster and managed and maintained defendant's website\n\n                   in the month January 2009 and was responsible for maintaining the link to PISD's internet\n\n                  notices on its website during January 2009 or concerning the internet notice of the 1115/2009\n\n                  board meeting.\n\n\n\n                  Request for Additional or Amended                 Cause No. 35621                                     Page 4 of9\n                  Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\n                                                                          394\n\fFrom: R Terrell          Fax: (512) 271-6840          To: Sandra Burkett         Fax: +1 (S061 669-8053   Page 6 of 10 12/0212013 4:18\n\n                  395\n\n\n\n\n                           16.     Defendant concealed and failed to disclose the identity and the central role of\n\n                  SchoolCenter to Texas Attorney General and plaintiffs in response to plaintiffs' Open Records\n\n                  Request or Public Infonnation Request per Gov't Code Ch. 552. Defendant further concealed\n\n                  and failed to disclose documents to plaintiffs concerning license fee payments to BoardBook and\n\n                  SchoolCenter for the purpose of their Open records Request or during discovery process.\n\n                           17. Court finds that there is no material question of fact remaining concerning plaintiffs'\n\n                  causes of action in TOMA Sections 551.041, 551.043, 551.045(d), 551.051, 551.101, and\n\n                  551.074(b ). Court declined to try plaintiffs' said causes of action at the trial of this case and no\n\n                  evidence or insufficient evidence was pennitted or presented concerning said causes of action.\n\n                           18.     There is no evidence or insufficient evidence that defendant's internet notices\n\n                  independently appeared on Google or BoardBook. Court finds such infonnation or evidence\n\n                  legally irrelevant, speculative and that it does not comply with TOMA.\n\n                           19. There is no evidence or insufficient evidence that PISD \"released\" or checked\n\n                  internet notices in BoardBook during Jan. 2009 through May 19, 2009 regarding any or all its\n\n                  board meetings. Such infonnation even if true is legally irrelevant, speculative and immaterial.\n\n                           20. There is no evidence or insufficient evidence that defendant ever checked or verified\n\n                  that the link to internet notices was transferred over to its new website during January 2009 to\n\n                  May 15, 2009 or that defendant required the third party vendor SchoolCenter to timely transfer\n\n                  said link to internet notices to its new website.\n\n                           21. Plaintiff Terrell's employment contract was tenninated by defendant in the Board\n\n                  meeting held on 3/26/2009. Voidance of defendant's action terminating Terrell's employment\n\n                  requires reinstatement of Terrell and payment of back wages and benefits until she is legally\n\n                  terminated under the Ed. Code in compliance with TOMA in a legally convened Board meeting.\n\n\n\n                   Request for Additional or Amended                 Cause No. 35621                                      Page 5 of9\n                   Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\n                                                                           395\n\fFrom: R Terrell          Fax: (512) 271-6840          To: Sandra Burkett         Fax: +1 (806) 669-8053   Page 7 of 10 12/0212013 4:1 S\n\n                  396\n\n\n\n\n                                        ADDITIONAL OR AMENDED CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n\n                           1. Defendant did not meet the prerequisites for attorney fees and costs award under\n\n                  Texas Open Meetings Act.\n\n                           2. Defendant's claim for attorney fees does not arise from Sec. 38.001 of the Civil\n\n                  Practice and Remedies Code (CPRC). Further, Ch. 38 of the CPRC does not apply to this case.\n\n                           3. The Court does not have the power or discretion to take judicial notice of the file in\n\n                  this case under TOMAto award attorney fees without receiving evidence concerning attorney\n\n                  fees and its reasonableness. The Court does not have the power or discretion to award attorney\n\n                  fees incurred or claimed by PISD for appeals in this case.\n\n                           4. Plaintiffs affirmatively established good faith under TOMA and brought the action in\n\n                  good faith.        Defendant did not dispute plaintiffs' good faith assertion nor introduced any\n\n                  evidence to the contrary. There is no evidence of lack of good faith on 1he part of plaintiffs in\n\n                  bringing this action.\n\n                           5. PISD's claim for attorney fees is denied due to lack of evidence and because PISD\n\n                  forfeited its claim due to its refusal to testifY and because it is legally improper.\n\n                           6. Defendant had the burden ofproofunder Texas Open Meetings Act Sec. 551.056(d) to\n\n                  prove good faith as to its admitted non-compliance with Sec. 551.056(b) for defendant's 11\n\n                  board meetings held during the time period January 2009 to May 19, 2009.\n\n                           7. There is no evidence or insufficient evidence that defendant's non-compliance with\n\n                  TOMA Sec. 551.056(b) was done in good faith. Defendant failed to meet its burden of proof of\n\n                   good faith under Sec. 551.056(d).\n\n                           8. Defendant obstructed discovery in this lawsuit by concealing and failing to disclose\n\n                  the identity and role of School Center and further concealed and failed to disclose other discovery\n\n\n\n                   Request for Additional or Amended                 Cause No. 35621                                      Page 6 of9\n                   Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\n                                                                           396\n\fFrom: R Terrell          Fax: (512) 271-6840          To: Sandra Burkett         Fax: +1 (806) 669-8053   Page 8 of 10 1210212013 4:1 S\n\n                  397\n\n\n\n\n                   and license fee payments to BoardBook and SchoolCenter. Defendant's obstruction of justice is\n\n                   sanctionable. All evidence concerning SchoolCenter and BoardBook must be and is excluded\n\n                   from trial ofthe case and is disregarded. Boothe v. Hausler, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1495642\"><a href=\"/opinion/1495642/boothe-v-hausler/\"><span class=\"volume\">766</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">788</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 789 (Tex. 1989).\n\n                           9. Court rules for plaintiffs on all counts and grants all relief requested. Court orders that\n\n                   plaintiff Terrell is reinstated to her previous position as a teacher at PISD and awards back pay\n\n                   and benefits. Terrell's termination in the 3/26/2009 board meeting is voided.\n\n                           10. Court concludes that plaintiffs' claims must be decided based on the Exact and\n\n                   Literal compliance standard applied to TOMA cases by the Texas Supreme Court. The Court\n\n                   rules in favor of plaintiffs on all of their causes of action in this case whether or not tried before\n\n                   the court on October 9, 2013.\n\n                           11. Defendant's claim that its internet notices independently appeared on BoardBook's\n\n                   website or on \"Google,\" whether true or not, does not comply with TOMA Sec. 551.056(b).\n\n                           12. Defendant's claim that it worked in BoardBook or checked its work in BoardBook is\n\n                   irrelevant and does not comply with TOMA Sec. 551.056(b) and does not meet the burden of\n\n                   good faith because PISD failed to check its own website for compliance with Sec. 551.056(b)\n\n                   during the entire time period of 5 months in 2009 for which it claims good faith.\n\n                           13. Plaintiffs are interested persons under TOMA. Plaintiffs have a particularized injury\n\n                   caused by defendant by its action taken under TOMA terminating Terrell's contract. Plaintiffs\n\n                   have requested relief of reinstatement of Terrell to her teaching position at defendant and stated\n\n                   that Terrell will resume her teaching position upon reinstatement. Thus plaintiffs have standing\n\n                   to maintain this lawsuit and have had standing for the duration of the lawsuit. This court has\n\n                   jurisdiction through out the duration ofthis lawsuit. TOMA does not require a plaintiff to be a\n\n                   taxpayer ofthe government entity sued under TOMA. Further TOMA neither requires a litigant\n\n\n\n                   Request for Additional or Amended                 Cause No. 35621                                      Page 7 of9\n                   Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\n                                                                           397\n\fFrom: R Terrell          Fax: (512) 271-6840          To: Sandra Burkett         Fax: +1 (806) 669-8053   Page 9 of 10 1210212013 4:18\n\n\n                  398\n\n\n\n\n                  to live within the boundaries of the government body nor does it require for a litigant to prove\n\n                  interest over and above that of general public. Plaintiffs have shown that they are interested in\n\n                  defendant government body and its functioning. Plaintiffs lived in Pampa within the boundaries\n\n                  of defendant when the alleged violations of TOMA occurred and injury of termination to\n\n                  plaintiff Terrell occurred in the school year 2008-2009 by PISD's action taken under TOMA.\n\n                           14. TOMA is not a scheme for providing individual notice, nor does it have any due\n\n                  process implication. Thus whether or not plaintiffs attended the 3/26/2009 board meeting or had\n\n                  actual notice of it or of Terrell's termination in said meeting is irrelevant under TOMA.\n\n                           15. Plaintiffs presented sufficient evidence to prove that continuance of the trial was\n\n                  justified and should be granted. Plaintiffs' motions to reset trial date, compel discovery, to\n\n                  exclude evidence, and for post-remand discovery are justified and should be granted.\n\n                           16. Defendant's failure to competently oversee transfer of link is not a technical problem\n\n                  under TOMA and was not beyond the control of defendant for 5 months from January 2009 to\n\n                  May 19, 2009. A good faith attempt to post internet notice under TOMA 551.056 must involve\n\n                  verification as to whether such notice actually appears on government body's website. PISD did\n\n                  not do so even once in 5 months. PISD fails the reasonable person standard of due diligence.\n\n                  PISD did not attempt to post TOMA internet notices in good faith. Had defendant checked its\n\n                  website for internet notices even once during said 5 months as was its practice in 2008, it would\n\n                  have promptly discovered non-compliance with TOMA Sec. 551.056(b ). The Court finds that\n\n                   lack of due care and oversight or negligence or incompetence, as here, is not a technical problem\n\n                   and that it is not beyond PISD's control.                The Court finds that PISD exhibited conscious\n\n                   indifference to the required compliance with TOMA Sec.551.056(b) and with respect to other\n\n                  violations of TOMA asserted by plaintiffs. The Court concludes that given the extended long\n\n\n\n                   Request for Additional or Amended                 Cause No. 35621                                      Page 8 of9\n                   Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\n                                                                           398\n\fFrom: R Terrell         Fax: (512) 271-6840         To: Sandra Burkett         Fax: +1 (806) 669-8053   Page 10of 1012102/2013 4:18\n\n\n                  399\n\n\n\n\n                  time period involved in non-compliance with TOMA i.e. 5 months, any problem in this matter\n\n                  was not technical in nature, nor was it beyond the control of PISD. Court finds that the non-\n\n                  compliance with TOMA for 11 board meetings from 112009 thru 5/19/2009 was in bad faith.\n\n                          Plaintiffs request that Court file the above additional and amended findings of fact and\n\n                  conclusions of law in this case and declare that to the extent any Finding of Fact reflects a legal\n\n                  conclusion, it shall be to that extent deemed a Conclusion of Law, and vice versa.\n\n                                                                                  Respectfully submitted,\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                  Rebecca Terrell\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                  Chandrashekhar Thanedar, Plaintiffs\n                                                                                  6503 Dancing Ct., San Antonio, TX 78244\n                                                                                  (956) 445-3107; (512) 271-6840 Fax\n                                                                                  rterrell15 2@gmail.com\n\n                                                      CERTIFICATE OF SERVICE\n\n                          The undersigned certifY that a true and correct copy of the foregoing document was\n\n                  served by USPS first class mail on December 2, 2013 on W.

Defendant Pampa Independent School District tapes notices of board meetings to the\n\nfront door of the administration building at \"321 ·W.

The front door as a place to post notices is\n\nneither secure, nor convenient, nor appropriate, nor in compliance with the Act The place of the\n\nnotice of meeting i.e. taping the notices to the front door is in violation of the Open Meetings\n\nAct. The Open Meetings Act expressly states where the notice of a meeting shall be posted and\n\nthe place varies depending on the governing body posting the notice. The place of posting for a\n\nSchool District is mandated to be a \"Bulletin Board.\"\n\n          The Tex. Gov't Code §551.051:      S~hool   District: Plaee of Posting Notice specifically\n\nstates:\n\n          \"A school district shall post notice of each meeting ·on a bulletin board at a place\n          convenient to the public in the central administrative office of the district.\" Tex.\n          Gov't Code §551.051\n\n          As Defendant tapes the notices to the front door of its administration building and does\n\nnot post notices on a bulletin board as mandated by the Act. defendant is in violation of the Act.\n\n          10. Further, Defendant is in violation of the time requirement of the Open Meetings Act\n\nTex. Oov't Code §551.043(a). It is not accessible at night and there is no lighting whatsoever for\n\npublic    to read   the notices at night time. The place is not convenient and not appropriate as\n\ndefendant posts other notices on the ftont door of the administration building e.g. Pest Control\n\nNotices, Enrollment in Kindergarten Classes, etc., obscuring a statutory notice of the board\n\n\nTerrell v.

Gov't Code Ch. 552 by Plaintiffs. This contrivance and\n\nmanipulation shows conscious guilt and willful conduct to disregard law. See Exhibits 1 ~thru 6.\n\n        (c) The above website notices were posted on May 19, 2009 on the Defendant's internet\n\nwebsite in the ''Board.Book\" nestled deep in the website so as to be less obvious and less\n\nconspicuous to public. On May 19, 2009, Defendant's Board was reorganized after a new board\n\nmember was elected and sworn in on that date.\n\n       (d) Defendant bas in fact admitted that it did not post any internet website notices of\n\nmeetings for the school year 2008..2009 with respect to the meetings referred above as of May\n\n15, 2009. The internet website notices posted for the said meetings on May 19, 2009 do not have\n\nthe name of the designated person under the Act posting it and/or such person's signature or\n\ncertificates of compliance with the Act, and dates and times of postings. See Exhibits 1 - 6.\n\nSuch postings of notices are in violation of the Act, Tex. Gov't Code §551.043(b) and §551.056.\n\n        12. Defendant taped a notice of meeting on its building's front door on Friday, May 15,\n\n2009 for a board meeting on May 18, 2009 and removed that taped notice on Monday, May 18,\n\n2009 and re~posted and re-taped a new notice to the front door on Monday, May 18, 2009 for a\n\nboard meeting on May 19, 2009. Plaintiff ThaDeda:r confirmed this with Defendant's personnel\n\nand obtained a copy of the notice of this meeting on May 18, 2009. The May 19, 2009 board\n\nmeeting was illegally convened in violation of the notice provisions of the Open Meetings Act,\n\nTex. Gov't Code subchapter C, Tex. Gov't Code §551.041, §551.043, and §551.056.\n\n\n\n\nTerrell v.

On May 26, 2009, two months after the Board Meeting held on March 26, 2009,\n\nDefendant Pampa Independent School District's superintendent Mr. Barry Haenisch by certified\n\nletter submitted to plaintiff Terrell another \"version\" of the \"original notice.\" This '•second\"\n\nversion of the \"original notice\" mailed to Temll is signed by Ms. Karen Linder and falsely dated\n\nMarch 20,2009. See Exhibit 3. It is undisputed that defendant's central office building (and the\n\nentire school district) was closed from March 14, 2009 through March 22, 2009 for \"Spring\n\nBreak.\" This notice dated March 20, 2009 is false, was never posted, nor distributed to public\n\nand was recreated only to obstruct justice and misrepresent compliance with the Act. Such\n\nobstruction ofjustice should not be countenanced by this Court.\n\n       14.   In fact, the original posting of notice for the March 26, 2009 was taped to\n\nDefendant's front office door on March 24, 2009 (after the March 23, 2009 taped notice fell or\n\nwas removed from the door per defendant's personnel.) This notice dated      March 23, 2009 for\nthe March 26, 2009 board meeting was in fact distributed to public and Plaintiffs on March 26,\n\n2009 during the said board meeting. Plaintiffs verified with defendant's personnel that no notice\n\nwas posted or remain posted on the front door on March 23, 2009 and obtained a copy of the\n\nnotice of the March 26, 2009 meeting on March 24,2009. There was no internet website posting\n\ndone by the Defendant for the March 26, 2009 for the prescribed time period under the Act. The\n\nMarch 26, 2009 meeting was illegally convened and this meeting and all actions taken in it are in\n\nviolation of the Open Meetings Act Subchapter C, Tex. Gov't Code §551.041; §551.043, and\n\n§551.056.\n\n       15. Defendant does not maintain or could not locate the signed originals of the notices\n\nand/or minutes of the board meetings from November 2008 through April 2009 as inspected\n\npursuant to a Public Information Request by Plaintiff Thanedar. Defendant admitted that the\n\n\nTerrell v.

Defendant's notices of board meetings taped to the front door of the administrative\n\nbuilding are signed by Ms. Karen Linder who is a secretary to Mr. Barry Haenisch,\n\nSuperintendent of Defendant Pampa Independent School District.            These postings are in\n\nviolation of the Act as follows:\n\n        1. The postings of the notices specifically including' notice for the March 26,\n\n            2009 meeting do not contain certificates of compliance by a \"designated or\n\n            authorized\" person that the .Postings are in compliance with the mandatory\n\n            requirements of the Open Meetings Act.\n\n       2. The Open Meetings Act has several notice provisions which must be\n\n           complied with and it is self-evident that a designated or an authorized person\n\n           must provide a certificate that the notice posted is in fact in compliance with\n\n           the Open Meetings Act.       This court should take judicial notice of how\n\n           governmental bodies and school districts properly post notices on their\n\n           internet website where designated personnel post and certify compliance with\n\n           the Open Meetings Act.\n\n       3. Defendant's taped front door notices are signed by Ms. Karen Linder who is\n\n           not designated nor authorized by the Defendant's policies legally approved by\n\n           its Board of Trustees to post public notices of meetings under the Act. It is\n\n           undisputed that as a secretary to the Superintendent of Defendant, Ms. Karen\n\n           Linder has neither the authority under law, district by-laws or approved\n\n           policies, nor any apparent or implied authority to post statutory notices on\n\n\nTerrell v.

Indeed, Ms. Karen Linder\n\n            does not even claim to have any authority to post legal notices, nor certify\n            compliance under the Act, nor sign the notices on behalf of the Board of\n\n            Trustees.   In fact, Ms. Linder makes no certifications whatsoever in the\n\n            notices she signed including the notice posted for the March 26, 2009 board\n\n            meeting.\n\n        4, No notices of board meetings are signed by the President of the Board of Trustees or\n\nthe Superintendent of Defendant Pampa Independent School District. This is in violation of the\n\nAct as the \"school district\" must post a notice of a meeting in compliance with the Act Tex.\n\nGov't Code subchapter C, Tex. Gov't Code §551.041, §551.043, and §55 1.056.\n\n        17. Defendant is in violation of the additional posting requirements of the Open\n\nMeetings Act Tex. Oov't Code §551.056 which requires that governmental bodies such as\n\ndefendant must post notices of meetings on their internet websites concUl'l'eD.tly for the\n\nprescribed minimum 72 hours before meetings. This requirement is in addition to other postings\n\nrequired by the Act. The Open Meetings Act defines \"notice\" as follows: \"A governmental\n\nbody shall give written notice of the date, hour, place, and subject of each meeting held by the\n\ngovernmental bOdy.\" Defendant is in violation of Tex. Gov't Code §551.041.              Further.\n\nDefendant is in violation of the time; requirement of the Open Meetings Act Tex. Oov't Code\n\n§551.043(b).\n\n       18.

It is plaintiffs' position that the board meeting of March 26, 2009 was not properly\n\nconvened and was in violation of the notice provisions of the Open Meetings Act as explained\n\nabove , and therefore, illegal.

The granting of the tempoi'aty injunctive relief requested by Plaintiffs will allow\nPlaintiffs to preserve the issues at hand until a final determination by the Court regarding the\n\nalleged violations of the Texas Open Meetinas Act can be made.\n\n       33. Additionally, the granting of the temporary injunctive relief requested by Plaintiffs\n\nwill only require Defendant Pampa Independent School District to comply with and abide by the\n\nOpen   Meetings Act and the employment contract with Rebecca Terrell until a final\n\ndetennination is made by the Court. The Defendant governmental entity Pampa Independent\n\nSchool District incy.rs no additional cost and bears no additional dutv but to comply with law or\n\nthe existing contractual obligations. Plaintiffs have made sufficient showing of violations and a\n\npattern of obstruction of justice and willful non compliance with the Open Meetings Act on the\n\npart of Defendant. Therefore, Plaintiffs pmy that the Court, in its discretion, should not require\n\ncash bond in this matter on the part of plaintiffs, or alternatively, if the court requires a bond,\n\nrequire the bond of a nominal amount.\n\n       34. Furthennore, the granting of temporary injunctive relief will prevent Defendant from\n\ntaking action that will cause further immediate and irreparable harm to Plaintiffs and all other\n\ncitizens and taxpayers of the Pampa Independent School District.

Given the Defeudant's conduct so far, a temporary restraining order without notice is\n\nproper.\n\n          35. Plaintiffs have exercised and will exercise due diligence in prosecuting their claims.\n\nThe injury to Plaintiffs and all other citizens and taxpayers of the Pampa Independent School\n\nDistrict, if defendant is not temporarily enjoined from the conduct described above. would\n\noutweigh any injury that the temporary restraining order and the temporary injwtctions might\n\ncause Defendant.\n\n          36. The issuance of temporary restraining order and temporary injunctions would not be\n\nagainst the public's interests but are sought only to preserve the best interests of the public and\n\nsought in the interest of justice.\n\n          37.

Further, the Court should issue permanent\n\ninjunctions against Defendant to prevent future violations of law, specifically the Open Meetings\n\nAct.\n\n       47.

Plaintiffs have filed their\n\nfirst supplemental petition on June 11, 2012. This case is on remand from   th Court of Appeals.\n       3. Plaintiffs rely on the following exhibits which are adopted and incorporated as if set\n\nforth verbatim herein.\n\n       Exhibit 1: Second Supplemental Affidavit of Rebecca Terrell and Chandrashekhar\n                  Thanedar (Attached).\n\n       Exhibit 2: Plaintiff Terrell's employment contract for 2008-2009 with defendant Pampa\n                  Independent School District (PISD or Pampa lSD) (Attached).\n\n\n\n\n                                                189\n\f190\n\n\n\n\n        Exhibit 3: Annual Financial Report of Pampa ISD for 2008-2009 is adopted and\n                   incorporated as if set forth verbatim herein - Pages 18, 20, 80 of the report\n                   providing sources of defendant's funding and expenditures are Attached.\n\n        Exhibit 4: Texas Fact Book 2008 (the Fact Book) by State of Texas Legislative Budget\n                   Bo~rd is adopted and incorporated by reference as if set forth verbatim\n                   herein- Pages 33, 42, 46, 49, 53 from the Fact Book concerning the\n                   Sources of Revenue and Spending on public education in Texas for\n                   2008-2009 are Attached.\n\n        Exhibit 5: Defendant's salary schedules and information for years 2008-2009,\n                   2009-2010, 2010-2011, 2012-2013; and health insurance premium\n                   information for Year 2011-2012 (Attached).\n        4. Plaintiffs Rebecca Terrell and Chandrashekhar Thanedar (spouse) are currently Texas\n\nresidents, citizens, and taxpayers and have been so continuously for more than 12 years. Plaintiff\n\nTerrell was a first year beginning teacher teaching three subjects at the Pampa High School,\n\nPampa, Texas in 2008-2009 teaching U. S. History, World History, and World Geography. See\n\nExhibits 1, 2.\n\n        5. PISD receives a substantial amount of state taxpayer funding, more than $13.2 million\n\nin 2008-2009, from the State of Texas. See Exhibit 3 - PISD's Annual Financial Report for\n\n2008-2009 (page 18) posted on Texas Education Agency's public internet website which is\n\nadopted and incorporated by reference herein. Further PISD receives substantial funding - $3 .48\n\nmillion from the federal government each year. Exhibit 3- PISD's Annual Financial Report for\n\n2008-2009 (pages 18, 80). The State of Texas (e.g. taxpayers such as plaintiffs) provides more\n\nthan 50% ofPISD's General Fund operating expenditures. See Exhibit 3 (page20).\n\n        The State of Texas collects sales and other taxes from Texas citizens and spends a\n\nmajority of it on public school districts such as Pampa ISD and more than a thousand other\n\nschool districts in the State of Texas. Thus the sales taxes and other taxes paid by plaintiffs help\n\nsupport defendant Pampa ISD. See Exhibit 4 - The Texas Fact Book 2008 is published and\n\nmade publicly available on its website by the Texas Legislative Board which is a permanent joint\n\nPlaintiffs' Second Supplemental Petition   Cause No. 35621                        Page 2 of7\n\n                                                     190\n\f191\n\n\n\n\ncommittee of the Texas legislature performing its statutory responsibilities. The citizens and\n\ntaxpayers of Texas, such as plaintiffs, through laws regulate all aspects of operations of public\n\nschool districts. See Texas Education Code e.g. Chapters 11, 21, and 44. Thus as current Texas\n\nand Federal taxpayers and residents of Texas plaintiffs have interest in Pampa lSD and therefore\n\nhave continuous standing from the beginning of this lawsuit to present.\n\n        6. As taxpayers and residents of the State of Texas for more than 12 years, we are\n\nconcerned about the operations of Pampa Independent School District (PISD), its funding and\n\nuse of State of Texas taxpayers' money, and about PISD's violations of the Texas Open\n\nMeetings Act, (TOMA), Gov't Code Ch. 551. We are interested in and concerned about the\n\nopenness, integrity, full disclosures, and full and honest compliance with Texas Constitution and\n\nwith TOMA and other laws by all Texas Government entities and their administrators and\n\nemployees, and in particular by PISD, its Board of Trustees, its superintendent, and its\n\nemployees and administrators. Plaintiff Terrell is interested in and intends to resume teaching at\n\nPISD upon reinstatement, upon order of the court. Plaintiff Thanedar as spouse is interested in\n\nTerrell's reinstatement and resumption of teaching career at PISD. Exhibit 1.\n\n        7. Plaintiff Terrell's salary as a teacher for the school year 2008-2009 was $34,500 and\n\nPISD further provided plaintiff Terrell benefits including health insurance, life insurance,\n\nholidays, sick and vacation time, and employer contributions to retirement benefits. Exhibit 2.\n\nPISD's benefits amount to about 33% of Plaintiff Terrell's salary. Based on PISD's salary\n\nschedules plaintiff Terrell's salary would have been at least $37,900 for 2009-2010, $40,100 for\n\n2010-2011, $41,300 for 2011-2012, and $41,400 for 2012-2013. Exhibit 5.\n\n        8. As a direct and proximate result of defendant's action terminating plaintiff Terrell's\n\nteaching contract done in violation of TOMA, Plaintiff Terrell has suffered loss of full time\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs' Second Supplemental Petition   Cause No. 35621                      Page 3 of7\n\n                                                    191\n\f192\n\n\n\n\nregular teaching position and employment, and has further suffered damages due to lost back\n\nwages and benefits for the years 2009-2010, 2010-2011, 2011-2012, 2012-2013 and continuing,\n\ncurrently estimated at more than $209,000 and continuing.\n\n        9. Plaintiffs have spent more than 1,650 hours on prosecuting this case against PISD\n\nsince the middle of May 2009 up to the filing date of this supplemental petition (Exhibit 1)\n\nwhich is relevant in calculating part of special damages in this case - hours spent multiplied by\n\nhourly rate. It is plaintiffs' position that special damages are warranted here due to defendant\n\nPISD's misconduct, obstruction, and the nature and extent of persistent violations for 2008-2009.\n\n        10. It is plaintiffs' position that PISD did not have BoardBook service for the purpose of\n\npublic viewing of PISD's website internet notices required under TOMA §551.056(b) for the\n\nperiod in question from August 13, 2008 to May 19, 2009. Further it is plaintiffs' position that\n\nPISD did not have BoardBook service for the purpose of public viewing of PISD's website\n\ninternet notices required under TOMA §551.056(b) for the period from January 15, 2009 to May\n\n19, 2009 -a period for which PISD claims good faith exception under TOMA §551.056(d).\n\nDefendant PISD has steadfastly refused to produce evidence that the alleged contract with\n\nBoardBook was in fact executed and that the alleged contract and service with BoardBook was\n\nactually in effect for the period of January 15, 2009 to May 19, 2009 or for any other relevant\n\ntime period. Defendant PISD has defiantly refused and failed to supplement and or amend\n\ndiscovery in this regard as required under Tex. R. Civ. Pro. 193.5.\n\n        Defendant did not pay the first year license fee for BoardBook service for 2007-2008 or\n\nfor any subsequent years e.g. 2008-2009, as a result did not have BoardBook service for the\n\npurpose of public viewing ofPISD's website internet notices of Board meetings from 8113/2008\n\nto 5/19/2009.      Defendant has refused and failed to produce any evidence of payment (e.g.\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs' Second Supplemental Petition   Cause No. 35621                      Page 4 of7\n\n                                                     192\n\f193\n\n\n\n\ncancelled checks, approved check requests, vouchers, check registers, or general ledger extract,\n\nevidencing payment, statement of account with BoardBook, correspondence with BoardBook\n\nregarding payment of license fees and renewal of contract, etc.) for BoardBook service either for\n\nthe purported 2007 BoardBook service agreement or for subsequent years - 2008-2009 and\n\n2009-2010. PISD's good faith defense under TOMA is a fraud on this Court, the        ih Court of\nAppeals that heard this case, Texas Supreme Court, State of Texas, and its citizens and Texas\n\nand Federal taxpayers.\n\n        BoardBook service is a software marketed by Texas Association of School Boards, Inc.\n\n(a trade organization) to its members such as PISD in assisting PISD to display its website\n\ninternet notices of Board meetings for public viewing on BoardBook's website in Adobe\n\nSystems Inc.'s (Adobe) Portable Document Format or \"PDF.\" Adobe's PDF format shows\n\ndocument properties of PISD's website notices such as when the board meeting notices were\n\ncreated i.e. brought into existence in PDF format for public viewing or modified i.e. changed,\n\nthereafter. Document properties of defendant's website notices on BoardBook for 8113/2008 to\n\n5/19/2009 show to have been untimely created in May 2009 after PISD was informed of the\n\nfailure to comply with TOMA §551.056(b) by plaintiffs. Said notices did not \"appear\" on PISD\n\nwebsite (or BoardBook's website) timely for prescribed time (instead \"appearing\" days, weeks\n\nor months after the meetings in question were held) after 5/19/2009. PISD failed to provide\n\nevidence of timely creation, posting, and appearance of its website internet notices for public\n\nviewing for the period in question- 8/13/2008 to 5/19/2009.\n\n        PISD's good faith defense of\"severance of link to BoardBook\" for the period 1/15/2009\n\nto 5/19/2009 is a subterfuge made in bad faith and is a fraud on the public and the court. PISD\n\nand its counsel obstructed and delayed proceedings by filing a frivolous motion to dismiss\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs' Second Supplemental Petition   Cause No. 35621                      Page 5 of7\n\n                                                    193\n\f194\n\n\n\n\nwithout any support in fact or law. Similarly, PISD's motion to quash depositions is also wholly\n\nmeritless designed mainly to delay and obstruct proceedings. PISD deliberately misled the      th\ncourt of appeals concerning its good faith defense and then opposed discovery concerning its\n\ngood faith defense. PISD and its counsel's deliberate obstructive conduct especially against pro\n\nse citizen taxpayers warrants strong sanctions against PISD and its counsel as punishment and to\n\ndeter such misconduct in the future in TOMA lawsuits. Sanctions on PISD and its counsel are\n\nwarranted here to preserve the sanctity of TOMA and its purpose - openness, voluntary\n\ncompliance to laws, and integrity in government.\n\n                                           Supplemental Prayer\n\n        FOR THESE REASONS, plaintiffs respectfully request that plaintiffs' prayer in their\n\noriginal petition and first supplement should be granted in its entirety and further plaintiffs\n\nrequest as supplemental prayer that PISD's action terminating Terrell's employment contract be\n\nvoided, PISD be ordered to reinstate Terrell, and with reinstatement of Terrell as teacher, PISD\n\nbe ordered to pay plaintiff Rebecca Terrell damages in the form of back wages and benefits for\n\nthe school years 2009-2010, 2010-2011, 2011-2012, 2012-2013 and continuing up to and until\n\nthe time PISD fully reinstates Terrell as classroom teacher (currently, back pay and benefits\n\ncalculated at about $209,000 and continuing), and that this Court should grant special damages\n\ncalculated by the number of hours spent by plaintiffs on this case multiplied by a reasonable rate\n\nper hour to be fixed by the Court, and that plaintiffs be declared as the substantially prevailing\n\nparty and be granted costs, expenses, and attorney fees, damages, back pay and benefits for\n\nTerrell with reinstatement as teacher, special damages, and fees, and that the Court enter\n\ndeclaratory judgment that PISD's actions in question violated TOMA and void all such actions in\n\nviolation ofTOMA and enter a permanent injunction against PISD to prevent future violations of\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs' Second Supplemental Petition   Cause No. 35621                      Page 6 of7\n\n                                                    194\n\f•\n195\n\n\n\n\nTOMA. Plaintiffs further request that the Court impose sanctions on PISD and its counsel due to\n\ntheir obstruction of justice, refusal and failure to supplement or amend discovery in this case.\n\nPlaintiffs further request that Court grant all other and further relief, at law or in equity, to which\n\nthey may justly be entitled to receive.\n\n                                                             Respectfully submitted,\n\n\n\n\n                                                             Rebecca Terrell\n\n\n\n\n                                                             Chandrashekhar Thanedar\n                                                             Plaintiffs\n                                                             6503 Dancing Ct.\n                                                             San Antonio, Texas 78244\n                                                             (956) 445-3107\n                                                             (512) 271-6840 Fax\n                                                             rterrell152@gmail.com\n\n                                     CERTIFICATE OF SERVICE\n\n        The undersigned certify that a true and correct copy of the foregoing document has been\n\nserved upon the following by United States certified mail on October 16, 2012 as follows: W.\n\nWade Arnold, Andrea Slater Gulley, Underwood Law Firm, 500 S.

In the 2006-07 school year,\n      Hispanic students comprised 46 percent of enrollment compared to 36\n      percent for Anglos. The number of Anglo students enrolled in public schools\n      began declining in the 1998-99 school year and has declined each year\n      since. African American students represented 14 percent of all students,\n      with Asian students and other ethnic groups rounding out the remaining 4\n      percent.\n\n      In the 2008-09 biennium,

Plaintiffs rely on the following exhibits which are adopted and incorporated as if set\n\nforth verbatim herein.\n\n       Exhibit 1: Supplemental Affidavit of Rebecca Terrell and Chandrashekhar Thanedar\n                  (Attached).\n\n\n\n\n                                                165\n\f166\n\n\n\n\n         Exhibit 2: Defendant's salary schedules and information for years 2008-2009,\n                    2009-2010, 2010-2011 and health insurance premium information for\n                    Year 2011-2012 (Attached).\n\n         Exhibit 3: Defendant's purported BoardBook service agreement for 2007 (Attached).\n\n         5. Plaintiffs Rebecca Terrell and Chandrashekhar Thanedar (spouse) are currently Texas\n\nresidents, citizens, and taxpayers and have been so continuously for more than 12 years. Plaintiff\n\nTerrell was a first year beginning teacher teaching three subjects at the Pampa High School,\n\nPampa, Texas in 2008-2009 teaching U. S. History, World History, and World Geography.\n\nPISD gets a large amount of state taxpayer funding, more than $12.5 million in 2008-2009, from\n\nthe State of Texas. As citizens, taxpayers, and residents of the State of Texas for more than 12\n\nyears, we are concerned about the operations of Pampa Independent School District (PISD), its\n\nfunding and use of State of Texas taxpayers' money, and about PISD's violations of the Texas\n\nOpen Meetings Act, (TOMA), Gov't Code Ch. 551. We are interested in and concerned about\n\nthe openness, integrity, full disclosures, and full and honest compliance with Texas Constitution\n\nand with TOMA and other laws by all Texas Government entities and their administrators and\n\nemployees, and in particular by PISD, its Board of Trustees, its superintendent, and its\n\nemployees and administrators. Plaintiff Terrell is interested in and intends to resume teaching at\n\nPISD upon reinstatement, upon order of the court. Plaintiff Thanedar as spouse is interested in\n\nTerrell's reinstatement and resumption of teaching career at PISD.\n\n         6. Plaintiff Terrell's salary as a teacher for the school year 2008-2009 was $34,500 and\n\nPISD further provided plaintiff Terrell benefits including health insurance, life insurance,\n\nholidays, sick and vacation time, and employer contributions to retirement benefits. PISD's\n\nbenefits amount to about 33% of Plaintiff Terrell's salary. See Exhibits 1-2.\n\n         7. As a direct and proximate result of defendant's action terminating plaintiff Terrell's\n\nteaching contract done in violation of TOMA, plaintiff Terrell has suffered damages due to lost\n\nPlaintiffs' First Supplemental Petition   Cause No. 35621                        Page 2 of5\n                                                    166\n\f167\n\n\n\n\nback wages and benefits for the years 2009-2010, 2010-2011, and 2011-2012 and continuing,\n\ncurrently estimated at more than $155,000 and continuing.\n\n         8. Plaintiffs have spent more than 1,500 hours on prosecuting this case against PISD\n\nsince the middle of May 2009 up to the filing date of this supplemental petition (Exhibit 1)\n\nwhich is relevant in calculating part of special damages in this case - hours spent multiplied by\n\nhourly rate. It is plaintiffs' position that special damages are warranted here due to defendant\n\nPISD's conduct and the nature and extent of persistent violations for 2008-2009.\n\n         9. It is plaintiffs' position that PISD did not have BoardBook service for the purpose of\n\npublic viewing of PISD's website internet notices required under TOMA §551.056(b) for the\n\nperiod in question from August 13, 2008 to May 19, 2009. Exhibit 3.        Further it is plaintiffs'\n\nposition that PISD did not have BoardBook service for the purpose of public viewing ofPISD's\n\nwebsite internet notices required under TOMA §551.056(b) for the period from January 15,2009\n\nto May 19, 2009 - a period for which PISD claims good faith exception under TOMA\n\n§551.056(d). Exhibit 3. Upon opinion and order of the Attorney General of Texas, defendant\n\nproduced a purported BoardBook service agreement dated October 12, 2007 (without evidence\n\nthat it was executed). Exhibit 3. Defendant produced no executed BoardBook agreements and\n\nno evidence whatsoever ofBoardBook service for subsequent years- 2008-2009 and 2009-2010.\n\n         DeJendant did not pay the first year license fee for BoardBook service for 2007-2008 or\n\nfor any subsequent years e.g. 2008-2009 as a result did not have BoardBook service for the\n\npurpose of public viewing of PISD's website internet notices of Board meetings from 8/13/2008\n\nto 5/19/2009.       Defendant has refused and failed to produce any evidence of payment for\n\nBoardBook service either for the purported 2007 BoardBook service agreement or for\n\nsubsequent years- 2008-2009 and 2009-2010.\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs' First Supplemental Petition   Cause No. 35621                        Page 3 of5\n                                                    167\n\f168\n\n\n\n\n         BoardBook service is a software marketed by Texas Association of School Boards, Inc.\n\n(a trade organization) to its members such as PISD in assisting PISD to display its website\n\ninternet notices of Board meetings for public viewing on BoardBook's website in Adobe\n\nSystems Inc.'s (Adobe) Portable Document Format or \"PDF.\" Adobe's PDF format shows\n\ndocument properties of PISD's website notices such as when the board meeting notices were\n\ncreated i.e. brought into existence in PDF format for public viewing or modified i.e. changed,\n\nthereafter. Document properties of defendant's website notices on BoardBook for 8/13/2008 to\n\n5/19/2009 show to have been untimely created in May 2009 after PISD was informed of the\n\nfailure to comply with TOMA §551.056(b) by plaintiffs. Said notices did not \"appear\" on PISD\n\nwebsite (or BoardBook's website) timely for prescribed time (instead \"appearing\" days, weeks\n\nor months after the meetings in question were held) after 5/19/2009. PISD failed to provide\n\nevidence of timely creation, posting, and appearance of its website internet notices for public\n\nviewing for the period in question- 8/13/2008 to 5/19/2009. PISD's good faith defense of\n\n\"severance of link to BoardBook\" for the period 1/2009 to 5/19/2009 is a subterfuge and made in\n\nbad faith.\n\n                                          Supplemental Prayer\n\n         FOR THESE REASONS, plaintiffs respectfully request that plaintiffs' prayer in their\n\noriginal petition should be granted in its entirety and further plaintiffs request as supplemental\n\nprayer that PISD's action terminating Terrell's employment contract be voided, PISD be ordered\n\nto reinstate Terrell, and with reinstatement of Terrell as teacher, PISD be ordered to pay plaintiff\n\nRebecca Terrell damages in the form ofback wages and benefits for the school years 2009-2010,\n\n2010-2011, 2011-2012, and continuing up to and until the time PISD fully reinstates Terrell as\n\nclassroom teacher (currently, back pay and benefits calculated at about $155,000 and\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs' First Supplemental Petition   Cause No. 35621                         Page 4 of5\n                                                    168\n\f169\n                                                                                 J\ncontinuing), and that this Court should grant special damages calculated by the number of hours\n\nspent by plaintiffs on this case multiplied by a reasonable rate per hour to be fixed by the Court,\n\nand that plaintiffs be declared as the substantially prevailing party and be granted costs,\n\nexpenses, and attorney fees, damages, back pay and benefits for Terrell with reinstatement as\n\nteacher, special damages, and fees, and that the Court enter a permanent injunction against PISD\n\nto prevent future violations of TOMA. Plaintiffs further request that the Court grant all other and\n\nfurther relief, at law or in equity, to which they may justly be entitled to receive.\n\n                                                               Respectfully submitted,\n\n\n\n\n                                                               Rebecca Terrell\n\n\n                                                               Cl3~~~\n                                                               Chandrashekhar Thanedar\n                                                               Plaintiffs\n                                                               7618 Citadel Peak\n                                                               Converse, Texas 78109\n                                                               (956) 445-3107\n\n                                          CERTIFICATE OF SERVICE\n\n         The undersigned certify that a true and correct copy of the foregoing document has been\n\nserved upon the following by facsimile and USPS certified mail on the 11th day of June, 2012 as\n\nfollows: W.

Subject to this objection Defendant\n would state that Karen Linder would periodically check that status of the postings after\n first posting the Notices on the BoardBook which ~ould in tum send through an internet\n link the Notices to the District Website. Sometime in January of 2009 the District\n Technology Services Department updated the website but left off the link between the\n Boardbook and District Website. This technical problem was not discovered and\n corrected until approximately May 2009. Karen Linder was responSI\"ble for creating the\n internet board notices through the boardbook program. Once created on the boardbook\n template the Notices were delivered to the District Website via a link. This link worked\n properly from October 2007 until approximately January 2009 when the District Website\n was updated. Unbeknownst to anyone at the District, when the District Website was\n updated the link with Boardbook was terminated.\n\n\n\n\n Defendant's Answers to Plaintiffs' l.ote1TOgatorfs-Page 3\n#484036\n\f INTERROGATORY NO. 5: State all technical problems that you believe caused\n your failure to comply with the legal requirement of posting internet notices of your\n board meetings on your website per TOMA.\n\n ANSWER:           See Answer to Interrogatory No. 4.\n\n INTERROGATORY NO. 6: State all reasons why you believe the technical\n problem(s) identified in Interrogatory No. 5 herein above were beyond your control\n\n ANSWER:           See Answer to Interrogatory No. 4.\n\nINTERROGATORY NO. 7: State when and how you became aware of the technical\nproblem(s) identified in Interrogatory No. S herein above.\n\nANSWER: Defendant became aware when it was reported to Defendant by Plaintiffs\nherein that the notices were not online.\n\nINTERROGATORY NO. 8:               Identify the names of the persons who were aware of\nthe technical problem(s) identified in Interrogatory No. 5 herein above and of your efforts\nto resolve them between the time period August 13, 208 [sic] to May 19, 2009.\n\nANSWER: Karen Linder.

This technical issue was not discovered until May of 2009 at\n        which time the link was reestablished. The technical problem was the severance of the\n        link with the updating of the website.

REASON FOR THE SECOND MOTION\n\n                1. On remand of this case from the         ih   Court of Appeals, plaintiffs have filed two\n\n         supplemental petitions - first supplemental petition on June 11, 2012 and the second\n\n         supplemental petition on October 18, 2012. Plaintiffs' amended no-evidence and traditional\n\n         motion for summary judgment was denied by Judge Vanderpool on August 24,2012.\n\n                2. Plaintiffs filed their motion to recuse the 223rd district court Judge Phil Vanderpool on\n\n         September 24, 2012 due to partiality towards defendant PISD and violation of plaintiffs' due\n\n         process rights. On September 26, 2012, the district clerk entered an order of recusal by Judge\n\n         Vanderpool. On October 15, 2012, senior Judge Abe Lopez was assigned to this case.\n\n\n\n\n                                                        217\n\f•\n    218\n\n\n\n\n              3. The only fact question identified by the 7th Court of Appeals in its opinion was PISD's\n\n    claim of \"good faith\" regarding the untimely \"creation dates\" and the \"non-appearance\" of its\n\n    internet notices from Jan. 2009 through 5119/2009 on its website and/or on BoardBook's\n\n    website. Terrell vs. Pampa ISD, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2539796\"><a href=\"/opinion/2539796/terrell-v-pampa-independent-school-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">345</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">641</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. App.--Amarillo 2011, pet. denied). See\n\n    TOMA §§551.056(b) and (d).\n\n              4. PISD's alleged \"good faith\" defense is a fraud on taxpayers of Texas, appeals\n\n    court, and this Court and a brazen obstruction of justice for the last 3 Y2 years. This defendant\n\n    governmental entity, a taxpayer funded school district no less, is under the mistaken impression\n\n    that it can continue to engage in this fraud against pro se Texas citizen taxpayers in this case.\n\n    Since the beginning of this lawsuit in May 2009, PISD deliberately engaged in obstruction of\n\n    justice by refusing and failing to produce documents in response to plaintiffs' discovery requests\n                                                                    1\n    that will show that PISD did not have BoardBook service for the period from January 15, 2009\n\n    to May 19, 2009 - period of 5 months for which it claims it had BoardBook service and for\n\n    which it claims \"good faith\" exception under §551.056(d) for \"non-appearance\" of its internet\n\n    notices. PISD admits the \"non-appearance\" of notices for said 5 months and blames the \"link\" to\n\n    BoardBook service for not working. CR807, CR814-816. CR766-767. 2 It further admits that the\n\n    untimely notices appeared on BoardBook's website on 5/19/2009 for the previous 5 months.\n\n    CR816. But PISD refuses to produce documents that show that it paid license fees or renewal\n\n    fees to BoardBook for 1/2009 to 5/19/2009 or for the relevant years 2008 and 2009 for\n\n\n\n    1\n     PISD frivolously refuses and resists discovery for the last 3 112 years objecting to such discovery as \"not\n    relevant\" and \"beyond the scope of Texas Rules of Civil Procedure\" while brazenly claiming good faith\n    exception based on the same BoardBook service. This is nothing but mockery of TOMA and the justice\n    system. PISD alleges that a link to BoardBook is necessary for public to view TOMA mandated internet\n    notices which reside on BoardBook's website.\n    2\n        The Clerk's Record is cited as \"CR[page],\" and Supplemental Clerk's Record cited as \"SCR[page].\"\n\n\n    Plaintiffs Second No-evidence and Traditional\n    Motion for Summary Judgment                        Cause No. 35621                    Page 2 of 43\n                                                       218\n\f219\n\n\n\n\nBoardBook service. Exhibits 20, 21. PISD refuses to produce requested documents and its\n\npersonnel for deposition. PISD's motion to quash depositions has been denied.\n\n        PISD has further refused to supplement discovery in violation of Tex. R. Civ. Pro 193.5\n\nconcerning its alleged contract for service with BoardBook for the period 1/2009 to 5/19/2009.\n\nPISD refused and failed to produce documents showing that it ever paid the initial licensing fee\n\nof$1,600 or any subsequent renewal fees for service to BoardBook. Exhibits 14, 20, and 21.\n\n        There is no evidence of an executed contract with BoardBook for the relevant time period\n\nin question- 1/2009 to 5/19/2009. Because there is no evidence of consideration moving from\n\nPISD to BoardBook for the above period and because PISD refuses to provide such evidence, as\n\na matter of law, the allegation of BoardBook service is legally invalid and at best speculation and\n\nnot legal evidence.

Notably, PISD does not claim good faith defense for 8/13/2008 through 12/2008 and there\n\nis no evidence in the record of consideration from PISD, valid contract or service with\n\nBoardBook for that period.\n\n        PISD further refused and failed to provide documents in response to discovery requests\n\nevidencing it paid license or renewal fees for BoardBook service and has refused to supplement\n\ndiscovery in violation of TRCP 193.5. The draft BoardBook agreemene (signed only by PISD,\n\n\n3\n  The Texas Attorney General's opinion (CR368-371) in favor of plaintiff Thanedar forced PISD to\nproduce this fabricated draft agreement. This draft agreement presumably covers a 12 month period from\n10/12/2007 to 10/12/2008. However this draft, even if presumed valid, would cover at the most only\nabout 2 months in question in this case - part of August 2008 to part of October 2008 and does not cover\nthe period Jan. 2009-May 19, 2009 for which PISD claims good faith defense under TOMA.\n\n\nPlaintiffs Second No-evidence and Traditional\nMotion for Summary Judgment                      Cause No. 35621                   Page 3 of 43\n                                                 219\n\f220\n\n\n\n\nbut not by BoardBook) clearly states that the subscription agreement is not effective until the\n\n$1,600 fee or a purchase order in that amount is received by BoardBook. Exhibit 14 (see \"Fees\"\n\nand \"Terms\"). Because there is absolutely no evidence in the record that PISD ever paid the\n\noriginal $1,600 (or a purchase order for $1 ,600) or subsequent renewal fees to BoardBook for\n\n2008 or 2009, PISD cannot as a matter of law prove that it had BoardBook service for the period\n\nin question from 8/13/2008 through 5/19/2009. Thus, there is not even a scintilla of evidence\n\nthat PISD had BoardBook service in effect from January 2009 through 5119/2009 - a period for\n\nwhich PISD claims good faith defense concerning why internet notices did not \"appear\" on\n\nPISD/BoardBook website.\n\n        PISD willfully engaged in subterfuge and obstruction of justice by fabricating a good\n\nfaith defense of missing \"link\" to BoardBook service in this lawsuit knowing full well that it did\n\nnot even have BoardBook service because it did not pay the license fees to BoardBook for the\n\nperiod in question. For this obstruction of justice and subterfuge PISD and its counsel deserve\n\nsubstantial sanctions as punishment for this misconduct.            In addition, this case concerns\n\npersistent willful pattern of violations of Texas Open Meetings Act, Gov't Code Ch. 551, for 22\n\nMeetings from 8/13/08 through 5/19/09 by defendant PISD.\n\n        5. PISD's misrepresentation concerning its unsupported assertion that \"create dates of\n\nBoardBook notices were in actuality print dates\" requires sanctions. PISD deliberately\n\nmisrepresented to the 7th Court of Appeals that the \"create dates\" of the untimely PDF internet\n\nnotices in BoardBook were in fact the dates on which website notices were \"printed\" for\n\nplaintiffs.   See Appeals Court's Opinion Pgs. 5-6; Exhibit 3.           PISD has failed to provide\n\nsupplementation in question in violation of the appeals court's opinion and TRCP 193.5 and\n\nfurther failed to indicate where in the record such evidence exists, if at all.\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs Second No-evidence and Traditional\nMotion for Summary Judgment                      Cause No. 35621                  Page 4 of 43\n                                                 220\n\f221\n\n\n\n\n          As noted by the appeals court, it does not. Opinion Pgs. 5-6. Thus PISD's argument\n\nbefore the appeals court was a deliberate misrepresentation made to delay this case and obstruct\n\njustice. Such misconduct on the part of PISD and counsel deserves substantial sanctions.\n\n                         II. PISD'S TOMA VIOLATIONS AND FRAUD\n\n          A. Actions Taken In 22 Board Meetings Are At Issue: PISD's violations of notice\n\nprovisions of TOMA concern the actions taken in the 22 meetings of the Board of Trustees of\n\nPISD between August 13, 2008 to May 19, 2009 (\"22 Meetings\"). Specifically, the 22 Meetings\n\nwere held on 8/13/08; 8/21/08; 9/4/08; 9/18/08; 10/2/08; 10/9/08; 10/23/08; 1116/08; 11120/08;\n\n12/4/08; 12/18/08; 1/15/09; 2/5/09; 2/19/09; 3/12/09; 3/26/09; 4/2/09; 4/16/09; 4/21/09; 4/23/09;\n\n517109; and 5/19/09. Exhibit 7, Exhibit 11 (Req. for Admission No. 19).\n\n          Thus, PISD's Board of Trustees (Board) held 11 meetings each in 2008 and 2009 from\n\n8/13/08 to 5/19/09.\n\n          B. Violations of TOMA provisions4 at Issue in this motion:\n\n      •   §551.051: PISD violated §551.051 by failing to post notices of 3/26/09 board meeting\n          and 22 Meetings in a specifically designated place - Bulletin Board in its Central\n          Administrative Office (Central Office) as required by TOMA.\n\n      •   §551.056: PISD violated §551.056 by failing to concurrently post internet notices of\n          3/26/09 board meeting and 22 Meetings on its website for prescribed time and manner.\n\n      •   §551.043: PISD violated §551.043 by failing to post notices of 3/26/09 board meeting\n          and 22 Meetings at a physical location for prescribed time (72 hours) and manner.\n\n      •   §551.041: PISD violated §551.041 by failing to specify \"place\" (Pampa, Texas) in its\n          notices (internet and paper notices) of 3/26/09 board meeting and 22 Meetings.\n\n      •   §551.101 and §551.074(b): PISD violated §551.101 by failing to legally close the\n          3/26/09 Board meeting and violated §551.074(b) by deliberating on Terrell's termination\n          in closed meeting.\n\n\n\n4\n References to the Texas Government Code Chapter 551 (TOMA) will be by reference to\"§ _ _\" or\n\"Sections_ _,\" or \"TOMA §_ _.\"\n\nPlaintiffs Second No-evidence and Traditional\nMotion for Summary Judgment                     Cause No. 35621               Page   5 of 43\n                                                221\n\f222\n\n\n\n\n      •   §551.045(d): PISD violated §551.045(d) because PISD's notices (website and physical\n          location) of 3/26/09 board meeting and 22 Meetings were signed on behalf of the Board\n          and posted by a person (Karen Linder) not so designated nor authorized by PISD's Board\n          of Trustees (Board).\n\n          C. TOMA Violations Are Distinct: The statutory language of TOMA is clear that the\n\nabove notice provisions are distinct, and failure to comply with any one of the notice provisions\n\nrenders the action(s) in violation ofTOMA and thus voidable. §551.141.\n\n                                        III. LEGAL STANDARD\n\nA. Post-Remand Proceedings\n\n          Reason for Remand: On appeal by plaintiffs, the 7th court of appeals acknowledged that\n\nPISD indeed was untimely in posting internet notices in violation of TOMA §551.056(b).\n\nHowever, appeals court reversed and remanded the case on the grounds that there is no evidence\n\nin the record concerning PISD's alleged argument that \"create\" dates of its electronic PDF\n\nnotices posted on PISD/BoardBook's website were in fact dates on which PISD printed the\n\nwebsite notices for plaintiffs for delivery to them.

Plaintiffs are entitled to summary\n\n    judgment on facts and law presented herein.\n\n                                IV.

UNDISPUTED FACTS\n\n    1. Undisputed facts concerning untimeliness of PISD's website internet notices and\n       Good Faith exception under §551.056(b) and (d)\n\n            PISD admits that internet website notices required under TOMA §551.056(b) did not\n\n    \"appear\" in the prescribed time on PISD or BoardBook's website for 11 meetings from 1/2009 to\n\n    5/19/2009. CR814-816, CR767.\n\n            PISD did not pay any consideration to BoardBook for its service for the relevant period\n\n    from 1/2009 to 5/19/2009 for which PISD claims good faith exception, or for any other period\n\n    relevant to this lawsuit.\n\n            There is no evidence that PISD had BoardBook service from 1/2009 to 5/19/2009. There\n\n    is no evidence of an executed contract or payment of license fees or renewal fees to BoardBook\n\n    for 1/2009 to 5/19/2009. PISD has admitted no such documents exist. CR781 (PISD's Response\n\n    to Request for Production 15).\n\n            An alleged draft agreement with BoardBook for 2007 is not signed by BoardBook.\n\n    Exhibit 14. PISD does not claim good faith exception for any period in 2007 or 2008.\n\n            The properties of the website internet notices show untimeliness in violation of TOMA\n\n    from 1/2009 to 5/19/2009 for which PISD claims good faith exception. Opinion Pgs. 5-6.\n\n            There is no evidence that the untimely \"created\" dates of the PDF notices of meetings in\n\n    question were the dates when \"PISD [allegedly] printed the notices for delivery to plaintiffs.\"\n\n    Plaintiff's Second No-evidence and Traditional\n    Motion for Summary Judgment                      Cause No. 35621               Page   13 of 43\n                                                      229\n\f230\n\n\n\n\n2. Undisputed facts concerning notice requirement of posting meeting notices on Bulletin\nBoard - a specifically designated place for school districts under §551.051\n\n        PISD admits and does not dispute that it posted board meeting notices on the front door\n\nof its central administrative building for the time period in question from 8/13/2008 to 5/19/2009\n\n(22 Meetings). Exhibits 7, 17. See Exhibit 11- Req. for Admission nos. 5 and 7.\n\n3. Undisputed facts concerning \"place\" requirement under §551.041\n\n        PISD admits that for both paper and internet notices it did not specify or include the name\n\nof the city in its notices from the period 8/13/2008 to 5/19/2009 (22 Meetings). Exhibit 6,\n\nExhibit 11-Req. for Admission no. 15.            In certain cases, defendant's notices merely state\n\n\"Pampa High School\" or \"Pampa Junior High School\" without stating the address. PISD does\n\nnot dispute this. Exhibit 10- See CR70-71, CR75, CR89-90, CR129-130, CR147-148, CR156,\n\nCR167-168, CR170.\n\n4. Undisputed facts concerning \"72 Hour\" notice requirement under §551.043 concerning\n3/26/2009 and 5/19/2009 board meetings\n\n        Plaintiffs did not see the notice for 3/26/2009 meeting posted on the front door of the\n\ncentral administrative office or in a bulletin board inside the central administrative office at 5\n\np.m. or 6 p.m. on 3/23/2009. Exhibit 7. This is undisputed.\n\n        Plaintiffs saw the notice for 5/18/2009 meeting posted on the front door of the central\n\nadministrative building on Saturday, 5116/2009. Karen Linder confirmed to plaintiff Thanedar\n\nthat there was an error in posting this notice because the meeting date changed to 5/19/2009 and\n\nthat Linder posted a corrected notice for a board meeting on 5/19/09 on the front door of Carver\n\nCenter -central administrative office- on 5/18/2009 because the change in meeting date to\n\n5/19/09. Exhibit 7. No board meeting took place on 5/18/2009.\n\n5. Undisputed facts concerning requirement to identify section(s) authorizing closed\nmeeting under §551.101\n\nPlaintiff's Second No-evidence and Traditional\nMotion for Summary Judgment                       Cause No. 35621              Page   14 of 43\n                                                   230\n\f231\n\n\n\n\n        The presiding officer of the Board did not identify the section or sections under TOMA\n\nthat authorized closing of the 3/26/2009 board meeting to public. See Exhibit 11-Req. for\n\nAdmission no. 14; Exhibits 7, 16.\n\n6. Undisputed facts concerning requirement to deliberate in open session under §551.074(b)\n\n        The audio recording of the closed meeting on 3/26/2009 shows discussion among PISD\n\nSuperintendent Haenisch and the PISD board members on Terrell's termination. Terrell had\n\nspecifically requested the action be deliberated in open meeting per §551.074(b). Exhibits 15,\n\n16 (Tape 2 at Counter 43:45).\n\n7. Undisputed facts concerning \"designated person\" requirement under §551.045(d)\n\n        PISD's Board of Trustees did not designate or authorize Karen Linder to sign meeting\n\nnotices or post board meeting notices on Board of Trustees' behalf. PISD admits this. Exhibit\n\n12-Req. for Production 28. Karen Linder signed and posted board meeting notices on behalf of\n\nthe Board of Trustees ofPISD. See e.g. Exhibit 6.\n\n                                            VI. ARGUMENT\n\n        Plaintiffs repeat the preceding paragraphs in their entirety as if set forth verbatim herein.\n\nA. Declaratory Relief under TOMA\n\n        Plaintiffs are entitled to declaratory relief under TOMA whether or not any other relief is\n\ngranted and whether or not PISD's actions in violation ofTOMA are voided.\n\n1. Plaintiffs are entitled to declaration that PISD violated TOMA §551.056 specifically\nconcerning the 3/26/09 Board meeting and 22 Meetings.\n\n   a. PISD refused and failed to produce evidence that it paid the required $1,600 fee\n   and any renewal fees for service to BoardBook to post internet notices for PISD\n\n        PISD admits that from January 15, 2009 through May 19, 2009 internet website notices\n\ndid not appear on its website (or its agent BoardBook's website) as required by §551.056(b).\n\nPlaintiffs Second No-evidence and Traditional\nMotion for Summary Judgment                     Cause No. 35621                  Page   15 of 43\n                                                 231\n\f232\n\n\n\n\nCR816. PISD alleges that it had BoardBook service 5 to post internet website notices of its Board\n\nmeetings on BoardBook's website since 2007. CR772. Thus by PISD's admission, BoardBook\n\nis an agent of PISD and they were parties in joint enterprise to post PISD's Board meeting\n\nnotices as required in §551.056(b) on BoardBook website via a link on PISD website. See\n\nCR206; CR772. PISD claims good faith defense under TOMA §551.056(d) because it claims\n\nthat the \"Link\" to internet notices on BoardBook's website was not established in error for 5\n\nmonths until plaintiff Thanedar pointed out the problem to PISD on 5/15/2009. CR767. PISD\n\nhas the burden to produce evidence and persuade on its good faith statutory defense under\n\nTOMA. See §551.056(d); §§551.043(b)(l) and (b)(3).\n\n        Inspite of PISD's bare self-serving claim, PISD has steadfastly refused and failed to\n\nproduce absolutely any competent evidence that PISD in fact had BoardBook service for the\n\nperiod in question from 112009 to 5/19/2009 or from 8/13/08 to 5/19/2009 for 22 Meetings and\n\nthat PISD paid consideration ($1600 or any renewal fees) to BoardBook to have a valid\n\nagreement. Exhibit 14 (See \"Terms\" and \"Fees\"). PISD refuses to produce documents or\n\nchecks showing payment of license fees and their dates, renewal notices, purchase orders from\n\nBoardBook, or any document or communication between BoardBook and PISD showing that\n\nBoardBook service was in effect from 1/2009 thru 5/19/2009- the period for which PISD claims\n\na technical problem with \"Link\" to BoardBook internet notices.           In addition, PISD further\n\nrefused and failed to produce evidence of BoardBook service from 8/13/08 to 12/2008 - See\n\n\n5\n  It is not disputed that BoardBook software is licensed by Texas Association of School Boards, Inc.\n(TASB) to its members and that TASB is governed by its member school districts according to its public\nwebsite. Exhibit 2. BoardBook is an agent of PISD to post PISD's internet website notices to comply\nwith TOMA §551.056(b) as the internet notices are produced in PDF format by BoardBook and posted\nand presented for public view on BoardBook website on behalf on PISD. CR205-206. Further,\nBoardBook is a party in joint enterprise with PISD in posting PISD's TOMA internet notices on\nBoardBook's website. Tex. Dept. ofTransp. v.

Incredibly, PISD further\n\nstated no such documents exist. CR781 (PISD's Response to Request for Production 15).\n\n        Inspite of PISD's refusal, the Attorney General of Texas ordered PISD to produce\n\n\"BoardBook agreement\" pursuant to plaintiff Thanedar's Texas Public Information Act request.\n\nSee CR368-371 (Attorney General's Opinion); and CR367 (Thanedar's Open Records Request).\n\nIt is revealing that the \"BoardBook agreement\" PISD produced was a \"Draft\" agreement for\n\n2007 (Exhibit 14) which was not executed because there is NO evidence of payment of\n\nconsideration of $1 ,600 from PISD to BoardBook in the record. This \"draft\" or \"offer\" is not\n\nsigned by BoardBook and contains no space for BoardBook's signature. Thus the purported\n\nagreement (Exhibit 14) was not executed, and is invalid because no consideration was paid.\n\n        Further the alleged 2007 draft agreement with BoardBook clearly states that unless and\n\nuntil payment of fees (or a purchase order) is received by BoardBook, the BoardBook service\n\nwill not be in effect. Exhibit 14 (see \"Terms\" and \"Fees\"). Here, PISD produced no evidence\n\nwhatsoever that it ever paid the license fee for BoardBook service, nor issued a purchase order\n\nfor the license fees, for the period in question in this lawsuit from August 13, 2008 to May 19,\n\n2009. In fact, PISD refused to produce any evidence that it ever paid license fee for BoardBook\n\nservice for any year from 2007, 2008, and 2009. See CR356-357. Exhibits 20, 21.

CR781 (Response to Req. for Prod. 15). Exhibits 20, 21.

(without consideration, there is no\n\n    contract). Thus as a matter of law, PISD's good faith defense based on the alleged link to\n\n    BoardBook service [which it did not have] for posting PISD's internet notices must fail.\n\n            PISD's bare unsupported assertion that it had BoardBook service from 8113/2008 through\n\n    5/19/2009 is hearsay, mere surmise, speculation which is not legal evidence.             Kindred v.\n\n    Con/Chem, Inc. at 63. Because PISD refused and failed to produce evidence of payment of\n\n    license fees for service posting internet notices to BoardBook, as a matter of law, PISD's good\n\n    faith defense under §551.056(d) must be rejected and it must be concluded that PISD's good\n\n    faith defense was subterfuge and obstruction of justice deserving sanctions by this Court.\n\n            b. \"Created\" Dates of Internet Notices Show Untimeliness:\n\n            The   ih Court of Appeals in its opinion on 4/29/2011 (\"Opinion\") on this matter has\n    found that internet notices of the 22 Meetings in question (including the 3/26/09 meeting) were\n\n    indeed untimely i.e. appeared on PISD/BoardBook's website well after the meetings in question\n\n    were held. See Opinion at 5-6. Also see Exhibit 13-CR814-815; Exhibit 12-CR802; Exhibit 7.\n\n    The appeals court, however, remanded the case due to PISD's alleged contention that the\n\n    \"created dates\" of its internet Adobe PDF notices on BoardBook website were in actuality the\n\n    dates on which PISD printed the internet notices for delivery to plaintiffs. See Opinion at 5-6.\n\n    On remand, plaintiffs requested supplementation on this issue (Exhibit 3), but PISD failed to\n\n    supplement written discovery concerning the above argument it made before the appeals court,\n\n    nor did it indicate where in the record it produced such pertinent evidence. Exhibits 20, 21.\n\n\n\n\n    Plaintiffs Second No-evidence and Traditional\n    Motion for Summary Judgment                     Cause No. 35621               Page   18 of 43\n                                                     234\n\f235\n\n\n\n\n        As explained above, there is no evidence that PISD even had BoardBook service, thus\n\n\"created\" dates being \"print\" dates in BoardBook is an issue created to divert court's attention\n\nand to mislead it- and is fraud on this Court and the appeals court. Importantly, this is an absurd\n\ncontention by PISD wholly unsupported in the \"PDF Reference version 1.3.\" See Exhibit 19.\n                                                     6\nCuriously, there is no evidence that \"created\"           dates in the document properties of PISD's\n\ninternet website notices are in actuality dates on which PISD \"printed\" notices for plaintiffs. In\n\nfact the record shows the opposite - PISD did not print PISD's [untimely] website internet\n\nnotices for plaintiffs. Exhibit 7-pgs 3-6. The copies plaintiffs obtained from Linder were paper\n\ncopies of signed originals made on PISD' s office copier in the presence of plaintiff Thanedar and\n\nhad nothing to do with printing website notices which are unsigned and undated. 7 Exhibit 7-pgs\n\n3-6; Exhibits 8, 10. Thus PISD's argument is frivolous.\n\n        The \"created\" date appearing in the \"document properties\" of PISD's own internet\n\nnotices posted and appearing on the BoardBook website effective 5/19/2009 means what it states\n\nin the document properties - 1) the document is in Adobe PDF format and 2) it was produced\n\n(\"created\") in that format at the stated date and time. See Exhibit 19. Similarly, \"Modified\"\n\nmeans what it states - the date and time on which the said document was \"modified\" or changed.\n\nCreated date and Modified date are standard properties in Adobe's PDF format and are\n\nautomatically generated information in Adobe PDF. Exhibits 7, 19. In fact PISD does not\n\n\n\n\n6\n  Collins English Dictionary-complete and unabridged, Harper Collins publishers, 1991-2003 defines\ncreate: ''to cause to come into existence.\" Merriam-Webster Dictionary 2012 defines create: \"to bring\ninto existence.\"\n7\n Plaintiffs filed PISD's internet notices with document properties on CD-ROM and Hardcopies of CD-\nROM in the record as they were posted by PISD on PISD's website. Plaintiffs downloaded the internet\nnotices to CD-ROM and printed hard copies for filing in the record of this case as evidence. Neither said\nCD-ROM nor Hardcopies of CD-ROM were given to plaintiffs by PISD. Exhibits 4, 5, 9, 10.\nPlaintiffs Second No-evidence and Traditional\nMotion for Summary Judgment                      Cause No. 35621                  Page   19 of 43\n                                                  235\n\f236\n\n\n\n\ndispute plaintiffs' assertion that plaintiffs printed the internet notices from PISD's public website\n\nthemselves. Exhibit 12-Interrogatory No. 24(CR804).\n\n        Further PISD's vague unsupported assertion that v1ewmg PDF notices changes the\n\n\"created\" and \"modify\" dates and times is mere surmise, incorrect, and speculation and is not\n\nevidence. Exhibit 12-Interrogatory No. 25; Kindred, Id at 63. Also see Exhibits 7, 19.\n\n        The competent summary judgment facts are indisputable that defendant's postings of its\n\ninternet notices of board meetings from August 13, 2008 through May 19, 2009 are untimely and\n\nthey were not posted during the prescribed period under TOMA in violation of Sections\n\n551.056(b); 551.041, 551.043(a). The web notice document properties posted by defendant\n\nPISD on its/BoardBook website for 22 Meetings unambiguously show that the web notices were\n\nproduced or created in May 2009 and then were posted on the website untimely on 5/19/09.\n\nExhibits 1, 7; CR807; CR816. The definition of\"created\" here means to prepare or produce the\n\ninternet notices in Adobe PDF format for posting to the website for public to view the internet\n\nnotices. See Exhibit 7; Exhibits 9, 10, 19. PISD admits that internet notices did not appear on its\n\nwebsite from 112009 until5/19/2009. Exhibit 1; Exhibit 13-CR814-815; Exhibit 12-CR802.\n\n        The properties of the website notice of the 3/26/09 meeting (Exhibits 4 and 5) show that\n\nthe web notice was created on 5/8/09 and untimely posted on defendant's/BoardBook's website\n\non 5/19/09 in violation of TOMA, Texas Gov't Code §551.0568 , §551.041 9, §551.043(a) 10 •\n\n\n\n8\n  The Open Meetings Act requires a school district to post notices of its board meetings on its website\nconcurrently for the prescribed 72 hours before the meetings. Texas Gov't Code §551.056\n9\n TOMA requires that \"A governmental body shall give written notice of the date, hour, place, and subject\nof each meeting held by the governmental body.\" Texas Gov't Code §551.041.\n10\n   The notice of a meeting of a governmental body must be posted in a place readily accessible to the\ngeneral public at all times for at least 72 hours before the scheduled time of the meeting, except as\nprovided by Sections 551.044-551.046.

PISD's Good Faith Defense Fails As A Matter Of Law:\n\n        Remarkably, notwithstanding the subterfuge and obstruction described above, PISD's\n\n\"good faith\" defense still fails as a matter of law. For the 11 out of 22 Meetings in question\n\nconcerning the violation of §551.056(b), PISD claims good faith defense under §551.056(d).\n\nTOMA §551.056(d) provides that:\n\n        The validity of a posted notice of a meeting or an agenda by a governmental body\n        or economic development corporation subject to this section that made a good\n        faith attempt to comply with the requirements of this section that is due to a\n        technical problem beyond the control of the governmental body or economic\n        development corporation.\n\n        The definition of \"Good faith\" is statutorily defined: A governmental body satisfies good\n\nfaith under TOMA when it \"makes a good faith attempt to continuously post the notice on the\n\ninternet during the prescribed period ... \" See TOMA §§551.043(b)(l) and (b)(3).\n\n        PISD admits that for 11 meetings from January 15 to May 19, 2009 (including the\n\n3/26/09 Board meeting) for about five months, the internet notices did not appear on its website,\n\nbut claims that it did not know that the \"link\" to the notices on BoardBook was not established or\n\nwas allegedly \"severed.\" The         ih   court of appeals did not find that a material fact question\n\nremains regarding the above assertion of good faith of the alleged \"severance\" of the \"link\" to\n\nnotices for 5 months. See Opinion 1-6. Thus good faith claim by PISD is ripe for summary\n\njudgment in plaintiffs favor for the following reasons.\n\n        1. Failure to Establish Link: Because PISD failed to show competent evidence that it\n\npaid for or had BoardBook service in January 2009, PISD's good faith defense fails. PISD failed\n\nto \"establish the link\" on its new website in 1/2009 to BoardBook because PISD did not have\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs Second No-evidence and Traditional\nMotion for Summary Judgment                        Cause No. 35621               Page   21 of 43\n                                                    237\n\f238\n\n\n\n\nBoardBook service.        Exhibit 1. As explained before, PISD refused and failed to produce\n\nevidence of payment to BoardBook for its service. Thus, the alleged claim of \"severance\" of\n\nlink to BoardBook is subterfuge. Suzie Jameson simply did not think the link to BoardBook\n\nnotices was necessary because there was no BoardBook service in January 2009 through\n\nMay 19, 2009. Exhibit 1. There was no \"accidental\" \"problem\" here. PISD admits that it\n\ndid not \"know\" of the severance of the link to BoardBook for 5 months until plaintiff Thanedar\n\ntold PISD (Linder) of the \"non-appearance\" of internet notices on 5/15/09. CR814-816. Such\n\nclaim of \"ignorance\" of the link problem for 5 months flies in the face of common sense and is\n\nfurther proof of subterfuge. Exhibits 1, 7.\n\n        2. PISD Failed to Verify \"Appearance\" of Internet Notices on its website and failed\n\nto Verify Compliance with TOMA for 5 Months: PISD's good faith defense fails because\n\nPISD failed to verify compliance with §551.056(b) for 5 months, and even notice or remedy the\n\nnon-establishment of \"link\" to notices for 5 months. This is in violation of §551.043(b)(1) and\n\n(3) which requires the continuous attempt to comply i.e. verify compliance and fix any problems\n\nduring the prescribed 72 hours. See §551.043(b)(l) and (b)(3); Exhibits 1, 7. The simple truth\n\nhere is that PISD did not verify \"appearance\" of its internet notices on BoardBook because it\n\nknew that it did not have BoardBook service during 1/2009 thru 5/19/2009- there was no need\n\nto verify what it already knew, that is, it was not posting internet notices on its website and was\n\nnot complying with §551.056(b).\n\n        3. Failure to Establish Link is not a \"Technical\" problem and is not \"Beyond the\n\nControl\" of PISD: PISD's good faith defense fails because the only evidence PISD produces is\n\nJameson's claim that she did not establish the link to internet notices on BoardBook because she\n\ndid not think it was necessary on PISD's new website. Exhibit 1. This belief, or negligence, or\n\n\n\nPlaintiff's Second No-evidence and Traditional\nMotion for Summary Judgment                      Cause No. 35621              Page   22 of43\n                                                 238\n\f239\n\n\n\n\nmistake by PISD (Jameson) is neither \"technical,\" nor \"beyond PISD's control\" for 5 months.\n\nDue diligence in compliance with TOMA is PISD's obligation under law and is well under the\n\ncontrol of PISD. Thus PISD fails the §551.056(d) test.\n\n        PISD tries mighty hard to pass its negligence or consciOus indifference to TOMA\n\n§551.056(b) as a \"technical problem\" \"beyond its control,\" but produces no evidence in support.\n\nPISD produces no authority or evidence to justify why negligence or mistake is a technical\n\nproblem beyond its control. The truth is PISD (Jameson) very quickly established the link when\n\ntold that it was \"necessary\" after 5 months. Exhibit 1. The above is merely subterfuge because\n\nPISD produces no evidence that it even had BoardBook service from Jan. 2009 to 5/19/2009.\n\n        4. Importantly, there is no evidence that PISD ~Checked its Website Even Once\n\nin 5 long months to verify whether or not its internet notices required under TOMA \"appeared\"\n\non its website so that public can actually see them. No one at PISD, not Linder, not Jameson, not\n\nsuperintendent Haenisch bothered to check the \"appearance\" of its internet notices on its website.\n\nCR807; CR768. There is no evidence of due diligence during the 5 months of non-appearance of\n\ninternet notices on PISD's website. CR807. This is \"conscious indifference\" or admission of\n\nguilt and cannot meet the good faith test under §551.056(d). Exhibit 1. CR768; CR807.\n\n      5. Plaintiffs objections to PISD's summary judgment evidence - Linder's Affidavits\nand Haenisch Affidavits and PISD's answers to interrogatories\n\n        Plaintiffs object to Karen Linder Affidavit at CR338-340 (\"Linder Affidavit 1\") and her\n\nsupplemental affidavit at CR726-729 (\"Linder Affidavit 2\") and further object to Barry Haenisch\n\nAffidavit at CR336-337 (\"Haenisch Affidavit 1\") and his supplemental affidavit at CR724-725\n\n(\"Haenisch Affidavit 2\") and PISD's answers to interrogatories.\n\n        A.

App.-Corpus Christi 2001, pet.\n\ndenied)( Affidavits must set forth facts, not legal conclusions.) These case authorities apply to all\n\nobjections below. Objections to Linder Affidavit 2 cover same issues in Linder Affidavit 1.\n\n        1) Assertions regarding authorization to post notices (Linder Affidavit 2, ,-3, ,-4): must\n\nbe disregarded as they are vague i.e. do not state who (Board or otherwise) authorized/designated\n\nLinder, make legal conclusions and opinions concerning compliance with TOMA which Linder\n\nis not competent to make.          Further, Linder's sworn statements are conclusively false and\n\ncontradict defendant's polices and bylaws viz. BE (Local) at CR821-823, BDAA (Local) at\n\nCR832, and BJA (Local) at CR834-836 show that the Board retained the authority to call, sign,\n\nand post board meeting notices to itself and did not delegate it to anyone.\n\n        2) Linder Affidavit 2, ,-5, ,-6, and ,-7 must be disregarded as they are composite and\n\nhybrid, not exclusively made from personal knowledge, are hearsay, irrelevant in part, and make\n\nimpermissible legal and factual conclusions. Specifically:\n\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs Second No-evidence and Traditional\nMotion for Summary Judgment                     Cause No. 35621                 Page24 of43\n                                                 240\n\f241\n\n\n\n\n        ~5-   \"Accessibility\" of front door posting: is hearsay, vague, irrelevant to the issues, and\n\nmakes impermissible legal and factual conclusions and subjective opinions. Linder's assertion\n\nthat \"[each notice] was posted on the front door at least 72 hours before each respective meeting\"\n\nis vague i.e. does not state the date and time and does not dispute that the notices of 3/26/09 and\n\n5/19/09 board meetings were not continuously posted for the entirety of 72 hours before the\n\nmeetings, and thus her assertions must be disregarded as they do not raise a fact issue regarding\n\nsaid meetings.\n\n        ~6   and   ~7   - Assertions about public complaints: are hearsay, vague, speculative, and\n\nirrelevant to the issues in this case, and make factual and legal conclusions and subjective\n\nopinions and must be disregarded. Linder is not competent, nor can make and express legal\n\nopinions in her affidavit regarding compliance with TOMA.\n\n        3) Assertions about 3/26/09 notice (Linder Affidavit 2, ,.8): Linder's statement- \"On or\n\nbefore March 23, 2009, I became aware that the notice had been taken or lost from the front\n\ndoor\" is vague, composite, hybrid including collected \"second hand\" information, speculative\n\nand must be disregarded. Linder's statement that she posted notice \"still more than 72 hours\" is\n\nvague and irrelevant to TOMA issues herein as Linder does not specifically dispute that 3/26/09\n\nmeeting notice was not on the front door continuously for 72 hours without revisions before the\n\nstart time of 3/26/09 meeting. Linder does not specify the time and the date on which she taped\n\nor re-taped the notices to the front door. Further 3/20/09 was a Board approved holiday-week of\n\n\"Spring Break\", and Linder fails to assert that she worked during \"Spring Break\" holiday.\n\n        4) Linder's assertions about website changes by Jameson and BoardBook problems:\n\n        Linder Affidavit 2,     ~9   lacks personal knowledge, is second hand information gathered\n\nfrom others, composite in nature and not exclusively from Linder's personal knowledge. As\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs Second No-evidence and Traditional\nMotion for Summary Judgment                       Cause No. 35621               Page 25   of 43\n                                                   241\n\f242\n\n\n\n\nsecretary to Haenisch, Linder is not competent to testify about BoardBook software or any\n\nalleged technical problems at issue here e.g. Jameson not establishing \"link\" to BoardBook\n\nwebsite concerning missing Board notices. Linder's statement - \"Once the notice was created I\n\nwould release it to the District website and the BoardBook software would send and\n\nautomatically place the notice on the district website\" must be disregarded as this is grossly\n\nvague, speculative, contradictory, and draws factual conclusions and is not competent summary\n\njudgment evidence as Linder is not competent to testify about the technology problems and\n\nsoftware technical matters between BoardBook software and PISD website.         For example,\n\nindisputable evidence shows that BoardBook software does not send internet notice to \"district\n\nwebsite.\" To the contrary, BoardBook displays an internet meeting notice on BoardBook's\n\nwebsite after a notice is released. See CR205-206 showing notices on www. boardbook.org.\n\n        Further, Linder fails to even aver whether she had personal knowledge that PISD did or\n\ndid not have BoardBook service at all during 112009 through 5/19/2009 for which PISD claims\n\ngood faith exception. Further, Linder's statement \"On or about January 15, 2009 Suzie Jameson\n\nof the Information Technology Department made some changes to the District website. In the\n\ncourse of making these changes the link between BoardBook and the website was severed\" is\n\nhearsay, lacks personal knowledge, is second hand collected information, and is based on vague\n\nspeculation.    Linder's hearsay testimony on behalf of Jameson is not competent summary\n\njudgment evidence and thus, must be disregarded. Linder's hearsay about \"some changes\" being\n\nmade and the link being \"severed\" is vague, misrepresent facts and are in contradiction with\n\nSuzie Jameson's email to Linder. See Exhibit 1. Linder's repetitive impermissible hearsay\n\nstatements about how BoardBook software worked are irrelevant to the issues in this case as\n\nthere is no competent evidence that PISD even had BoardBook software from 8/13/2008 through\n\n\n\nPlaintiff's Second No-evidence and Traditional\nMotion for Summary Judgment                      Cause No. 35621          Page26   of43\n                                                 242\n\f243\n\n\n\n\n5/19/2009, and Linder is not competent to testify about technical workings of BoardBook\n\nsoftware. Linder's statement \"However, I was unaware that the link between BoardBook and the\n\nwebsite had been severed and BoardBook did not indicate that the link had been severed.\n\nInstead, it appeared that the notices were still being posted to the website just as before. It was\n\nnot until May of 2009 that I was informed that the notices were not appearing on the website\"\n\nmust be disregarded as it is grossly vague, speculative, composite and hybrid in nature, lacking\n\npersonal knowledge of the facts. Thus the entire ~9 must be disregarded. Humphreys, id.\n\n        5) Assertions of appearance of Notices on website (Linder Affidavit 2, ,10): Linder's\n\nassertions are bare conclusions, vague, and speculative, thus are not admissible as evidence\n\nbecause Linder does not affirmatively state that she verified appearance of each of PISD's\n\ninternet website notices on PISD's website or BoardBook website for the public to view for the\n\nprescribed period for Board meetings from August 13, 2008 to January 15, 2009. Linder further\n\nfails to state how she \"knows it for a fact\" that postings were properly made to the website and\n\nhow many times and whether she checked the appearance of notices on PISD website or\n\nBoardBook website during the said time.         This is pertinent because there is absolutely no\n\ncompetent evidence that PISD even had BoardBook service until May 19, 2009 and further PISD\n\nhas admitted that TOMA notices did not \"appear\" on PISD website or BoardBook website for 11\n\nMeetings from January 2009 to May 19, 2009. Further defendant's own website postings\n\nconclusively show that the electronic TOMA notices posted on BoardBook's website were\n\nuntimely created in May, 2009, weeks or months after the board meetings in question took place.\n\nCR814-815. Thus the entire ~10 must be disregarded. Humphreys, id.\n\n        6) Linder's assertions about TOMA compliance (Affidavit 2., 11) must be disregarded\n\nas Linder makes impermissible legal conclusions and Linder is not competent to make them.\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs Second No-evidence and Traditional\nMotion for Summary Judgment                     Cause No. 35621               Page 27 of 43\n                                                243\n\f244\n\n\n\n\nThus, Linder's statement \"All of the notices for the meetings of the District's Board held\n\nbetween August 13, 2008 and May 19, 2009 meet the requirements or an exception set forth in\n\nthe Act\" must be disregarded.\n\n        Plaintiffs object to the entirety of Linder Affidavit 2 and Linder Affidavit 1 as they are\n\negregiously defective substantively and in form as explained above. PISD introduced Linder\n\nAffidavits in bad faith. Linder Affidavits are not in compliance with TRCP 166a(f). Linder\n\nAffidavits must be disregarded in this summary judgment proceeding.\n\n        B.

Objections to Haenisch Affidavit 2 cover same issues in Haenisch\n\nAffidavit 1. See Exhibit 18.\n\n        1) Assertion concerning Linder's authorization to post notices for 8 years (Haenisch\n\nAffidavit 2, ,3): is hearsay, vague and conclusory as Haenisch does not state who exactly\n\nauthorized Linder and how, lacks personal knowledge as Haenisch was not employed for 8 years.\n\nFurther, Haenisch's sworn affidavit is conclusively false and contradict PISD's polices and\n\nbylaws viz. BE (Local) at CR821-823, BDAA (Local) at CR832, and BJA (Local) at CR834-\n\n836 show that Board retained the authority to sign and post board meeting notices to itself and\n\ndid not delegate it.

Humphreys, id. Haenisch affidavits are not in compliance with TRCP 166a(f).\n\n         C. Objections to PISD's answers to interrogatories: PISD did not attach verification\n\nto its answers and supplemental answers to Terrell's interrogatories in compliance with TRCP\n\nRules 197.2(d) and 193.5(b). See CR764-769; CR685-690; CR708-711; CR800-811; CR812-\n\n817. TRCP 197.2(d) requires that \"A responding party- not an agent or attorney as otherwise\n\npermitted by Rule 14 - must sign the answers under oath ... \" The \"Responding Party\" here is\n\nPampa Independent School District.              PISD has attached Karen Linder's affidavit or PISD\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs Second No-evidence and Traditional\nMotion for Summary Judgment                         Cause No. 35621                Page29 of43\n                                                     245\n\f246\n\n\n\n\nattorney's signature to its answers to plaintiffs' interrogatories; however, her affidavit or\n\ncounsel's signature is not sufficient to comply with TRCP 197.2(d).\n\n        Linder performs clerical duties at PISD as secretary to Haenisch. Linder neither has real,\n\nexpress, implied, nor apparent authority to represent PISD, a government body, to make legal\n\nrepresentations on behalf of PISD. It is obvious here that Linder is being put up by PISD as a\n\nshield. As Linder Affidavits above must be struck, it is proper that answers to interrogatories\n\nverified by Linder and PISD counsel must also be struck. It is well established PISD can only\n\nact through its Board as a whole and did not grant any kind of authority to Linder in this matter.\n\nPISD's above answers and supplemental answers to plaintiffs' interrogatories should be struck\n\nand disregarded for failure to comply with TRCP 197.2(d) and 193.5(b).\n\n        Further, Linder's affidavits and PISD's assertions concerning BoardBook (CR800-811)\n\nare not legal evidence because Linder does not claim expertise, nor assert knowledge or\n\nexperience in technical matters relating to PISD's website or the alleged \"link\" issues, or\n\nBoardBook software. PISD's claims concerning how \"created\" dates in document properties of\n\nAdobe PDFs in BoardBook changed due to printing (refer to appeals court's opinion at 5-6) are\n\nfrivolous, vague, mere surmise and are not legal evidence. Kindred, Id at 63. Further, there is no\n\nevidence that Linder has any knowledge, responsibility, or experience concerning document\n\nproperties of internet notices or BoardBook software's technical or security functions.\n\n        Plaintiffs note that PISD has deleted the internet notice for 5/19/09 meeting and replaced\n\nit with a notice for meeting on 5/18/09. It is not disputed that no meeting ever took place on\n\n5/18/2009. Plaintiffs object to this tampering with evidence. The original correct internet notice\n\nfor 5/19/09 is in the record on CD-ROM and in Hardcopy formats. Exhibits 9, 10.\n\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs Second No-evidence and Traditional\nMotion for Summary Judgment                     Cause No. 35621               Page   30 of 43\n                                                246\n\f247\n\n\n\n\n        PISD's good faith defense under §551.056(d) is a fraud on the Court, a subterfuge and\n\nmust be rejected. Plaintiffs are entitled to summary judgment in their favor in this regard.\n\n2. Plaintiffs are entitled to declaration that PISD violated TOMA §551.051 specifically\nconcerning the 3/26/09 Board meeting and 22 Meetings.\n\n        TOMA §551.051: School District: Place of Posting Notice specifically states:\n\n        A school district shall post notice of each meeting on a bulletin board at a place\n        convenient to the public in the central administrative office of the district.\n\n        Tex. Gov't Code §551.051.\n\n        No material fact question remains here. It is undisputed that PISD taped TOMA notices\n\nto front door of its central administrative office (Central Office) for Board meetings for 3/26/09\n\nand 22 Meetings e.g. See Exhibits 7, 17. See Exhibit 11-Req. for Admission nos. 5 and 7.\n\n        TOMA mandates a physical location i.e. Bulletin Board in central administrative office,\n\nwhere PISD must post TOMA notices. §551.051. This is further emphasized by §§551.043(b)(2)\n\nand (b)(3).\n\n        The statutory language of \"Bulletin Board\" is clear and unambiguous. Therefore, the\n\ncourt lacks the power to interpret or change it and must apply the most obvious and common\n\nmeaning of the words. See the Tex. Dept. ofTransp. v.

The meaning of words \"Bulletin Board\"              has been well established for more than\n\n150 years as a board for posting notices at a school.\n\n\n\n\n11\n  Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, Eleventh Edition defining bulletin board ( 1831 ): \"a board\nfor posting notices (as at a school).\" Merriam-Webster, http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary (last\nvisited 3/16/2012) defining bulletin board (1831): \"a board for posting notices (as at a school).\"\n\n\nPlaintiffs Second No-evidence and Traditional\nMotion for Summary Judgment                     Cause No. 35621                  Page   31 of 43\n                                                 247\n\f248\n\n\n\n\n       The meaning of front door 12 has been well established for more than 250 years. It is\n\nobvious to a reasonable person that the predominant purpose of a \"door\" is to \"enter or leave a\n\nstructure\" or create a \"barrier\" to close or open an entry and the predominant purpose of a\n\n\"Bulletin Board\" is to \"post notices.\" Thus as a matter of law front door is not bulletin board and\n\ndoes not meet the requirement of §551.051.\n\n        PISD violated §551.051 by failing to post notices of the 3/26/09 meeting and the 22\n\nMeetings on a bulletin board in the Central Office. Further it is undisputed that PISD had a glass\n\nenclosed bulletin board inside the central administrative building that PISD did not use for\n\nTOMA notices. PISD taped notices on the front door of its Central Office building so that the\n\ngeneral public is forced to stand outside of the building to read notices of meetings. Exhibits 7,\n\n17. After this lawsuit was filed, defendant knowingly removed the bulletin board in the Central\n\nOffice lobby and placed it outside the front door of the Central Office building on or about\n\n6/5/09. See Exhibit 11-Req. for Admission 3 and 4; Exhibit 7. Thus it is obvious that PISD\n\nknows the difference between front door and bulletin board.\n\n        Front door is not bulletin board under TOMA.

Being forced to stand outside of a building is not proper, suitable, or\n\n    safe as it exposes readers to harm coming from the street's unsafe conditions including crime.\n\n              PISD's front door posting of notices of 3/26/09 and 22 Meetings does not comply with\n\n    the \"in\" the Central Administrative Office requirement of §551.051 because PISD's notice\n\n    cannot physically be read from inside PISD' s central administrative office. Exhibits 7, 17.\n\n    To read PISD's meeting notice posted on its Central Office front door, one must stand outside\n\n    the Central Office building to read the notice. The clear language and intent of §551.051 is that a\n\n    reader must be able to enter the Central Office and read a notice \"in\" the central administrative\n\n    office.    Because PISD's front door posting of notices of 3/26/09 and 22 Meetings fail this\n\n    requirement, PISD is in violation of §551.051.\n\n              Based on above, posting TOMA notices on front door does not meet \"convenient\" test of\n\n    §551.051 and further fails the \"readily accessible\" test under §551.043.\n\n              As explained above, PISD fails even the overruled \"substantial compliance\" standard\n\n    here - posting notices on front door does not meet reasonable standard of suitability for reading\n\n\n    13\n      The American Heritage Dictionary defining convenient: \"Suited or favorable to one's comfort,\n    purpose, or needs.\" Merriam-Webster Dictionary defining convenient: \"Suited to personal comfort or to\n    easy performance; suited to a particular situation; affording accommodation or advantage.\"\n    14\n      Merriam-Webster Dictionary defining accessible: \"capable of being used or seen.\" Collins English\n    Dictionary defining accessible: \"easy to approach, enter, or use.\"\n    Plaintiffs Second No-evidence and Traditional\n    Motion for Summary Judgment                      Cause No. 35621                 Page 33   of 43\n                                                      249\n\f250\n\n\n\n\nnotices and because it is an \"unwelcome mat\" to \"keep out\" or to discourage, frustrate taxpayers\n\nand public from entering the central administrative office to participate and observe their school\n\ndistrict. PISD fails the Texas Supreme Court law of the Exact and Literal compliance standard\n\nbecause PISD failed to post notices of the 3/26/09 and 22 Meetings in question in the place\n\nspecifically mandated for school districts by law- \"Bulletin Board.\" See §551.051; Acker, !d.\n\n        If this court were to permit PISD to make its own law and not comply with the\n\nspecifically designated place in TOMA, it would be an invitation to government entities\n\nthroughout the State of Texas to post TOMA notices on back doors, side doors, front/back/side\n\nwindows, on plants in central office, on restroom doors, office doors, and so on. This is not only\n\noffensive, but will eviscerate TOMA.\n\n        Plaintiffs are thus entitled to declaratory relief that PISD violated TOMA §551.051 for\n\nthe 3/26/09 Board meeting and 22 Meetings in question.\n\n3. Plaintiffs are entitled to declaration by the court that PISD violated §551.043 concerning\nthe 3/26/09 Board meeting and 5/19/09 Board Meetings\n\n        Plaintiffs' sworn testimony is undisputed that the notice of 3/26/09 Board meeting was\n\nnot witnessed or seen posted in the bulletin board in PISD's Central Office nor on its front door\n\nat 5 P.M. and after 6 P.M. on 3/23/09 i.e. notice was posted less than the prescribed 72 hours in\n\nviolation of §551.043. Exhibit 7. PISD's (Linder) vague claims and surmise that it posted all\n\nnotices on the front door more than 72 hours ahead of time are not competent summary judgment\n\nevidence or legal evidence and must be disregarded. Kindred, Supra, Further such conclusory\n\nassertions do not specifically dispute 1) Thanedar and Terrell's conversation with PISD's\n\nemployee Ramiro Soto that there was no board meeting notice posted at or immediately after 6\n\nP.M. on 3/23/09 and 2) that plaintiffs noticed that Linder was not at work at central office at\n\nPISD at 5 P.M. or at or after 6 P.M. on 3/23/09 and that 3) the notice appeared on the front door\n\n\nPlaintiffs Second No-evidence and Traditional\nMotion for Summary Judgment                     Cause No. 35621              Page 34   of 43\n                                                250\n\f251\n\n\n\n\nthe next day on 3/24/09 i.e. less than prescribed 72 hours (a \"revised\" notice was taped to the\n\nfront door of central office building on 3/24/09). Exhibit 7.\n\n        Similarly, plaintiff Thanedar's sworn testimony about his conversation with Linder\n\nregarding PISD's 5/19/09 Board meeting is undisputed i.e. Linder mentioned to Thanedar that\n\nthe notice for 5/19/09 meeting was posted on 5/18/09 because the date of the meeting had\n\nchanged. This caused the notice to be posted for less than the prescribed 72 hours in violation of\n\n§551.043 and the Exact and Literal Standard of compliance with TOMA promulgated by the\n\nSupreme Court in Acker. Exhibit 7. Because PISD posted (paper) notices of 3/26/09 and\n\n5/19/09 Board meetings at a physical location for less than the prescribed 72 hours, PISD\n\nviolated §551.043.\n\n4. Plaintiffs are entitled to declaration by the court that PISD violated §551.041 when\nPISD failed to give notice of \"place\" of its 3/26/09 Board meeting and 22 Meetings\n\n        There is no evidence and it is undisputed that PISD's notices of 3/26/09 board meeting\n\nand 22 Meetings refer to \"321 W. Albert\" and do not specify a city where the meeting will be\n\nheld. See e.g. Exhibit 6, Exhibit 11-Req. for Admission no.15. In certain cases, defendant's\n\nnotices merely state \"Pampa High School\" or \"Pampa Junior High School\" without stating the\n\naddress. PISD does not dispute this. Exhibit 10- See CR70-71, CR75, CR89-90, CR129-130,\n\nCR147-148, CR156, CR167-168, CR170. Such truncations require the general public to \"fill in\n\nthe blanks\" which is in violation of TOMA. TOMA §551.041 specifically requires that the\n\ngeneral public or a \"reader\" be notified of the \"place,\" but PISD failed to do so.          The Texas\n\nSupreme Court has \"demanded exact and literal compliance\" with the Open Meetings Act. See\n\nAcker v. Texas Water Commission, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1577083\"><a href=\"/opinion/1577083/acker-v-texas-water-comn/\"><span class=\"volume\">790</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">299</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. 1990). Here defendant's truncations\n\nmentioned above violate the plain language of TOMA.               Further it is public record and is\n\nundisputed that PISD encompasses two counties - Gray county and parts of Roberts county,\n\nPlaintiffs Second No-evidence and Traditional\nMotion for Summary Judgment                     Cause No. 35621                 Page 35   of 43\n                                                251\n\f252\n\n\n\n\nwhere meetings could be held in different cities. 15 Thus plaintiffs are entitled to declaration that\n\nPISD violated §551.041 's \"place\" requirement in regards to 3/26/09 Board meeting and 22\n\nMeetings in question.\n\n5. Plaintiffs are entitled to declaration by the court that PISD violated §551.045(d)\nconcerning the notices of 3/26/09 Board meeting and 22 Meetings\n\n           It is undisputed that Karen Linder, secretary to Superintendent, signed notices of 3/26/09\n\nboard meeting and 22 Meetings on behalf of the Board of Trustees. 16 See e.g. Exhibit 6. There\n\nis no evidence that PISD Board of Trustees ever designated or authorized Linder to sign on its\n\nbehalf or post notices of its meetings. PISD admits that Board never authorized nor designated\n\nKaren Linder under TOMAto sign notices of meetings on behalf of the Board. Exhibit 12-Req.\n\nfor Production 28. §551.045(d) requires an authorized or designated person to post notices of\n\nmeetings. The language of the section in this regard is clear - it applies to all notices - not just\n\nemergency meetings. 17 See §551.045(d). Thus plaintiffs are entitled to declaration that PISD\n\nfailed to comply with §551.045(d) because Linder was neither authorized nor designated by\n\nBoard to post meeting notices when she did so for 3/26/09 meeting and 22 Meetings. Acker.\n\n6. Plaintiffs are entitled to declaration that PISD violated TOMA §551.101 by improperly\nclosing its March 26,2009 meeting and further violated §551.074(b)\n\n          It is not disputed that defendant's president, Mr. Charles Smith did not identify the\n\nsection or sections of TOMA that authorized closing the 3/26/09 board meeting to the public\n\n15\n  While it may seem possible to guess that \"321 W. Albert\" is in Pampa, Texas, there are over 1,030\nschool districts whose names do not necessarily lend to guessing names of the cities where the meetings\nmay be located e.g. Pharr-San Juan-Alamo (PSJA) lSD; Spring Branch lSD, etc.\n16\n     The internet notices required under §551.056(b) posted untimely by PISD were not signed by anyone.\n17\n   Tex. Gov't Code §551.045(d) requires: \"A person who is designated or authorized to post notice of a\nmeeting by a governmental body under this subchapter\" to post notice for the governmental body. The\n\"subchapter\" referenced above is unambiguously the \"Subchapter C: Notice of Meetings\" and the\nrequirement of an authorized or a designated person posting notices of meetings applies to all postings of\nnotices under TOMA and not just the emergency meetings.\n\n\nPlaintiffs Second No-evidence and Traditional\nMotion for Summary Judgment                        Cause No. 35621                  Page   36 of 43\n                                                    252\n\f•\n    253\n\n\n\n\n    under TOMA before closing the 3/26/09 meeting. See Exhibit 11-Req. for Admission no.14;\n\n    Exhibits 7, 16.     PISD thus did not comply with the Tex. Gov't Code §551.101(2). Therefore,\n\n    plaintiffs are entitled to declaration that PISD unlawfully closed meeting on March 26, 2009 in\n\n    violation of Tex. Gov't Code §551.1 01. Acker, Supra. Plaintiffs are entitled to all legal and\n\n    equitable relief and that 3/26/09 closed meeting and actions taken in it be declared unlawful and\n\n    contents of the closed meeting be made public and allowed to be freely copied and distributed.\n\n            PISD further violated §551.074(b) by deliberating on Terrell's contract termination in the\n\n    closed meeting on 3/26/09 when Terrell had specifically requested the action be deliberated in\n\n    open meeting per §551.074(b). Exhibits 15, 16 (Tape 2 at Counter 43:45.). Plaintiffs are\n\n    entitled to the declaration that PISD violated §551.074(b). Acker, Supra.\n\n    B. Voidance of PISD's unlawful actions is proper due to subterfuge, persistent conscious\n    and defiant violations of TOMA committed over numerous months\n\n            The action taken in 3/26/09 Board meeting terminating Terrell's contract violated\n\n    TOMA's notice provisions as shown before, thus it is voidable and should be voided. §551.141;\n\n    Ferris, Infra; Acker, Supra.\n\n            The 22 Meetings including the 3/26/09 meeting were unlawfully convened as shown\n\n    before. Since all the actions taken in the 3/26/09, 5/19/09 and 22 Meetings violate TOMA's\n\n    notice provisions as demonstrated before, said actions in 22 Meetings are voidable and should be\n\n    voided. §551.141; Ferris, Infra; Acker, Supra. See other additional case authorities below.\n\n            Therefore, upon voidance of the action terminating Terrell's employment contract\n\n    (Exhibit 15), this Court should issue mandamus ordering PISD to reinstate Terrell and pay her\n\n    damages for back pay and benefits, currently estimated at $209,000 to date and continuing\n\n    (Exhibits 25, 26).

As demonstrated in the record and in this motion, PISD has\n\n     engaged in frivolous arguments, subterfuge, and obstruction of justice: 1) claiming good faith\n\n     defense concerning BoardBook service while refusing to produce evidence that PISD ever paid\n\n     consideration to BoardBook i.e. license fees, maintenance/support fees as required by\n\n     BoardBook (Exhibit 14) for the period it claims good faith defense. For lack of proof of\n\n     consideration, the alleged 2007 contract (Exhibit 14) with BoardBook is invalid. There is simply\n\n     no evidence whatsoever that PISD even had BoardBook service from 8/13/2008 through\n\n     5/19/2009; 2) arguing before appeals court that printing notices for plaintiffs \"changed\" the\n\n     create dates of its internet website notices, and then refusing and failing to provide evidence of it.\n\n     Making this worse, PISD even admitted that plaintiffs printed the internet notices themselves\n\n     from PISD's public website. CR804.\n\n             PISD's defiant willful longstanding violations ofTOMA require voidance to demonstrate\n\n     to government entities that TOMA will be upheld and honored by Texas courts.                        Special\n\n     damages in the amount to be determined by the court should be granted to plaintiffs for\n\n     prosecuting this unduly protracted litigation pro se expending substantial money, energy, effort,\n\n\n\n\n     18\n       In Austin Transportation Study Policy Advisor Committee v.

Special damages and Sanctions on PISD and counsel are appropriate in this case:\n\n             Special damages are warranted here due to the subterfuge and obstruction of justice by\n\n     defendant and counsel in this case. Plaintiffs rely on the facts and arguments in the preceding\n\n     paragraphs in this regard. PISD which is entirely funded by taxes from Texas citizens continues\n\n     to flaunt its defiance against TOMA and the will of Texas citizens, legislature, taxpayers, and the\n\n     Texas Supreme Court. Plaintiffs' urge sanctions on PISD.\n\n             This case isn't only about plaintiffs- it's about the Texas citizens who expect honesty and\n\n     voluntary compliance to openness, transparency, and integrity from their government.                  The\n\n     failure to void PISD's egregious and defiant violations of TOMA will eviscerate protections\n\n     granted to Texas citizens under TOMA, undermining and abrogating concepts of honest\n\n     voluntary compliance with the promise of open government and transparency, and further\n\n     lowering Texans' regard for democratic processes, judiciary, and the rule of law.\n\n                                                 VII. CONCLUSION\n\n             The appeals court identified only one fact question - PISD's good faith claim under\n\n     §551.056(d). However, as shown above, PISD's good faith claim is brazenly fraudulent and is\n\n     constructed to obstruct justice against pro se plaintiffs and Texas citizens and taxpayers. PISD\n\n     and its counsel deliberately misrepresented its good faith claim to the        7th   Court of Appeals to\n\n     improperly obtain remand of this case. After achieving its purpose of delay and obstruction,\n\n     PISD now has defiantly refused to supplement the discovery concerning its claim of good faith.\n\n             This Court should not countenance PISD's misconduct and perversion of TOMA's\n\n     purpose to foster openness and integrity in government.\n\n\n\n     Plaintiffs Second No-evidence and Traditional\n     Motion for Summary Judgment                         Cause No. 35621                  Page 40   of43\n                                                         256\n\f 257\n\n\n\n\n        For these reasons, plaintiffs ask for summary judgment on all their claims as set forth\n\nabove in their favor.\n\n                                                 VIII.

We will reverse and remand.\n\n\n\n\n      1\n          Appellants are husband and wife.\n      2\n          See TEX. GOV’T. CODE ANN. §§ 551.001-.146 (West 2004 & Supp. 2010).\n\f                           Factual and Procedural Background\n\n\n       Appellant Terrell was a first-year teacher in the PISD whose probationary\n\ncontract of employment was terminated by action of the PISD School Board on March\n\n26, 2009. On May 29, 2009, appellants filed their original petition alleging numerous\n\nviolations of TOMA and requesting that the trial court issue a temporary restraining\n\norder against PISD, issue a temporary and permanent injunction against PISD, and\n\nenter an order declaring that all meetings of the School Board held between certain\n\nspecified dates to be void and that all actions taken by the School Board at those\n\nmeetings to be void, specifically identifying the termination of Terrell’s employment.\n\nFurther, appellants requested that the trial court enter a writ of mandamus ordering the\n\nSchool Board to reinstate Terrell.      Appellants requested an unspecified amount of\n\ndamages, costs of court, and attorneys fees.              PISD duly filed an answer to the\n\nallegations contained in appellants’ original petition.\n\n\n       Appellants obtained a setting for a hearing on the application for a temporary\n\ninjunction and, in connection with the setting, caused to be issued a subpoena duces\n\ntecum for PISD employee, Karen Linder.            PISD filed an objection to the subpoena\n\nduces tecum and to certain of the documents requested. Appellants subsequently filed\n\na motion to “show cause and strike defendant’s original answer.” The trial court granted\n\nPISD’s objections to the subpoena duces tecum and denied appellants’ motion to show\n\ncause and strike PISD’s original answer by order dated June 10, 2009. After the trial\n\ncourt refused to enter a temporary restraining order, appellants requested the trial court\n\nto vacate a setting on the temporary injunction.\n\n                                              2\n\f       On June 15, 2009, appellants filed a traditional motion for summary judgment\n\nand a no-evidence motion for summary judgment. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a; 166a(i).\n\nAfter PISD had filed a response to the motions, appellants subsequently filed objections\n\nto PISD’s summary judgment evidence. The trial court denied appellants’ motion for\n\nsummary judgment by order dated October 12, 2009. Appellants then filed a motion\n\nrequesting the trial court to reconsider its ruling on the summary judgment and to enter\n\na ruling on appellants’ objections to PISD’s summary judgment evidence. The trial court\n\ndenied both the motion to reconsider and the objections to PISD’s summary judgment\n\nevidence by order dated December 23, 2009. On that same day, PISD filed a traditional\n\nand no-evidence motion for summary judgment.          On May 14, 2010, the trial court\n\ngranted PISD’s motion for summary judgment without specifying upon which ground the\n\nmotion was granted.\n\n\n       Appellants appeal the order of the trial court, asserting an extensive number of\n\nreasons why the trial court’s judgment was in error. The issues presented may be\n\nbroken down into allegations that the trial court erred in not finding that PISD violated\n\nthe provisions of TOMA regarding: 1) posting of notice of meetings, 2) requirements for\n\nspecificity in the notice of meetings and the place of the meetings, 3) internet posting\n\nprovisions, 4) requirement that all deliberations of the type involved be held in a public\n\nmeeting, 5) allegations that the notices posted were not posted by a person with\n\nauthority to post notices of meetings. In addition to the alleged violations of TOMA,\n\nappellants allege that the trial court erred in: 6) ruling on various objections to some of\n\nPISD’s summary judgment evidence, 7) in granting PISD’s motion for summary\n\njudgment, and 8) in denying appellants’ motion for summary judgment. Because one of\n                                            3\n\fthe issues appellants raise regarding violations of TOMA is dispositive of this matter, we\n\nwill address it first.\n\n\n                                   Standard of Review\n\n\n        We review the granting or denial of a motion for summary judgment de novo.\n\nSee Valence Operating Co. v. Dorsett, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894667\"><a href=\"/opinion/894667/valence-operating-co-v-dorsett/\"><span class=\"volume\">164</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">656</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 661 (Tex. 2005). When both\n\nparties file a motion for summary judgment, as in this case, and one is granted and one\n\nis denied then we, as the reviewing court, must determine all questions presented and\n\nrender the judgment that should have been rendered by the trial court.

TEX. GOV’T CODE ANN. § 551.056(b) (West 2010).3 Section 551.056 provides\n\nthat a good faith attempt to comply with the requirements is not affected when the\n\nfailure to comply with the requirement is due to a technical problem beyond the control\n\nof the school district. § 551.056(d).\n\n\n        The record before us clearly demonstrates that, for the period of time between\n\nJanuary 15, 2009, and May 19, 2009, the notices of the School Board meetings could\n\nnot have been posted on the PISD website.         Further, summary judgment evidence\n\nproves that the failure to post was due to a cutting of the link between the software\n\n        3\n        Further references to the Texas Government Code Annotated will be by\nreference to “section ___”, “Section ___” or “§ ____.”\n                                            4\n\fprogram used to post the notices, BoardBook, and the website.           PISD contends,\n\nthrough Linder’s affidavit, that, although the link was cut to the website, the notices\n\ncontinued to be posted as required. They simply did not appear on the website.\n\n\n      According to PISD’s theory, the failure to post was due to a technical problem\n\nbeyond its control and, therefore, PISD’s failure to post is excused under the good faith\n\nexception of the statute. Appellants, however, contend that the missing notices, when\n\nproduced by PISD, reflect that they were “created” not around the time of the original\n\nmeeting, but after PISD was notified of the failure of the connection between the\n\nsoftware and the website. Under appellants’ theory, this summary judgment evidence\n\nestablishes a material fact issue regarding the good faith attempt of PISD to post the\n\nnotices on its website as required by the statute. See § 551.056(d).\n\n\n      A review of the summary judgment evidence does, indeed, reflect that the\n\nnotices in question show to have been “created” after PISD was notified of the failure to\n\npost the required website notices.     Neither party offered any summary judgment\n\nevidence as to what the term “created,” as it appears under the properties tab of the\n\nnotice, means. Both parties have opined as to what it means. Appellants contend it\n\nmeans the notices were not prepared and entered until after the notification that PISD\n\nhad failed to post notices of the School Board meetings as required. PISD contends\n\n“created” means the date the particular notice was printed for delivery to appellants.\n\nWe, however, have no evidence to support either interpretation.\n\n\n      In our analysis of the summary judgment under the de novo standard of review,\n\nevidence favorable to appellants must be taken as true and every reasonable inference\n\n                                           5\n\fmust be indulged in favor of appellants.

Accordingly, we find that there is a material fact\n\nissue about whether PISD actually attempted to post the notices and, therefore, met the\n\ngood faith exception to the requirement to concurrently post notices of the School Board\n\nmeetings on its website.\n\n\n       PISD argues that this case is similar to the allegations in Argyle Indep. Sch. Dist.\n\nv. Wolf in which the Fort Worth court determined that there was no evidence of bad faith\n\non the part of the school district. See </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1654838\"><a href=\"/opinion/1654838/argyle-independent-school-dist-v-wolf/\"><span class=\"volume\">234</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">229</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 248-49 (Tex.App.—Fort Worth\n\n2007, no pet.). However, in Argyle the parties had a stipulation of evidence that the\n\nwebmaster had, in fact, received the notice of the meeting in question and attempted to\n\npost the same on the school district’s website. See id. at 248. Further, the parties\n\nstipulated that the failure of the notice to appear was beyond the control of the school\n\ndistrict and the problem was corrected a few hours before the meeting. See id. The\n\nevidence in Argyle is factually distinguishable from the summary judgment evidence in\n\nthis case and does not control our disposition of this matter.\n\n\n                                        Conclusion\n\n\n       Because the issue of concurrently posting notices on the PISD’s website involves\n\na genuine issue of material fact not established as a matter of law, we reverse the\n\njudgment of the trial court. We remand this matter for further proceedings consistent\n\nwith this opinion.\n\n\n                                                        Mackey K.

In accordance with Rules 296 and 297\n\nof the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, the Court makes the following findings of fact and\n\nconclusions of law.\n\n                                          A. Findings of Fact\n\n        1.       Rebecca Terrell       (\"Terrell\")    and Chandrashekhar Thanedar (collectively\n\n\"Plaintiffs\") are residents of Bexar County, Texas and were sb at the beginning of the trial of this\n\ncause on October 9, 2013.\n\n        2.      Plaintiffs represented themselves prose and were not represented by counsel at\n\ntrial or at any time during this litigation.\n\n        3.      Pampa Independent School District (\"PISD\")              IS   a School District with its\n\nAdministrative offices located in Pampa, Gray County, Texas.\n\n        4.      At the commencement of trial on October 9, 2013, Plaintiffs did not reside within\n\nthe PISD district boundaries but instead resided in Bexar County, Texas.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     326\n\f327\n\n\n\n\n        5.     Terrell was employed by PISD in 2008 under a probationary teaching contract\n\nwhose term was 10 months which expired by its own terms at the end of the 2008-2009 school\n\nyear.\n\n        6.     In March of 2009 Terrell was given actual notice that PISD intended to terminate\n\nher probationary contract as required by the Texas Education Code. Thereafter, the termination\n\nof Terrell's probationary contract was placed on the School Board agenda for the regularly\n\nscheduled meeting to take place on March 26, 2009. The written notice for the March 26, 2009\n\nschool board meeting was properly placed on the front door of the PISD administration building\n\nlocated in Pampa, Gray County, Texas more than 72 hours prior to the start of the meeting.\n\n        7.     Plaintiffs had actual notice of March 26, 2009 board meeting and each Plaintiff\n\npersonally attended the meeting. Further, Terrell spoke to the board during the public comment\n                                                                         :l\n\n\n\n\nsection of the board meeting regarding the termination of her probationary contract.\n\n        8.     At the March 26, 2009 board meeting the School Board voted unanimously to\n\nterminate Terrell's probationary contract.\n\n        9.     In 2007 PISD purchased a computer program called Boardbook which PISD used\n\nto create its school board meeting notices and to post these notices on its district website (the\n\n\"internet postings\"). PISD has used Boardbook for this purpose continuously since 2007 and has\n\npaid for the Boardbook program each year since 2007.\n\n        10.    Karen Linder, a PISD employee, was tasked with using the Boardbook program to\n\ncreate each school board meeting notice and to then place a copy of the notice on the district\n\nwebsite in conformance with the requirements of Section 551.056 of the Texas Government\n\nCode for internet postings.\n\n\n\n\n                                               327\n\f328\n\n\n\n\n       11.    Once Ms. Linder created the notice in Boardbook she then utilized the Boardbook\n\nprogram to \"release\" the notice to the public for viewing. The public was able to review the\n\nnotice on the district website through a hyperlink on the website which directed the public to\n\nBoardbook where the notice had been created and was available for viewing. This was the\n\nmanner in which internet postings were accomplished from the time PISD purchased the\n\nBoardbook program.\n\n       12.    In January of 2009 PISD transitioned its website to a new format. The new\n\nwebsite was built and maintained by an outside independent third party contractor hired by PISD\n\nfor this purpose. PISD instructed the contractor to make sure the new website had all of the same\n\nhyperlinks as the old website, including the hyperlink to Boardbook which allowed the public to\n\nview the school board meeting notices on the internet. The contractor failed to carry the\n\nBoardbook hyperlink from the old website to the new one and as a result the school board\n\nmeeting notices which formerly appeared on the internet through the PISD website were\n\nunavailable from the time the website switch occurred.in January 2009 through May 19, 2009\n\nwhich was the date that PISD was informed of the problem.\n\n       13.     The Boardbook school board meeting notices for PISD which were created by\n\nKaren Linder using the Boardbook program were available for viewing by the public from\n\nJanuary 2009 through May 19, 2009 on the Boardbook website even though they were not on\n\navailable on the PISD website during this time.\n\n       14.     Karen Linder and PISD were unaware that the Boardbook hyperlink was no\n\nlonger available on the PISD website as they had directed the contractor to carry forward to the\n\nnew website all such hyperlinks. Karen Linder continued to create the school board meeting\n\n\n\n\n                                              328\n\f329\n\n\n\n\nnotices in Boardbook and \"releasing\" them to the public when completed, all the while thinking\n\nthey were still available on the website through the Boardbook hyperlink on the website.\n\n        15.    The actions of Karen Linder and PISD in attempting to post the internet notices\n\nrequired by Section 551.056 of the Texas Government Code from January 2009 through May 19,\n\n2009 were all in good faith and any failure to comply with the statute was due to a technical\n\nproblem beyond the control ofPISD.\n\n        16.    PISD was unaware that that the Boardbook hyperlink was not carried over to the\n\nnew website and the independent contractor hired by PISD for the website conversion was at\n\nfault for failing to carry over the hyperlink.\n\n        17.    Plaintiffs' claims in this suit included a claim und\\er Section 551.142(a) of the\n\nTexas Government Code.\n\n        18.    PISD was the substantially prevailing party at trial in regards to any claims under\n\nChapter 551 of the Texas Government Code and in regards to any claims brought under Section\n\n551.142(a).\n                                                                       '\n        19.    PISD is entitled to an award of litigation costs and reasonable attorney fees\n\nincurred in defending the claims of Plaintiffs which were brought in bad faith.\n\n        20.    In awarding $30,000.00 in attorney fees the Court tpok judicial notice of the file\n\nand has considered that the actions of the Plaintiffs in bringing this suit were in bad faith and that\n\nthe actions of PISD in defending Plaintiffs claims were reasonable under the law and in\n\nparticular under Chapter 551 of the Texas Government Code. This award of attorney fees and\n\ncosts is both reasonable and just considering the time involved. in defending this suit, the\n                                                                       ~\n\nvoluminous number of pleadings and motions filed by Plaintiffs, boUt in the District Court and in\n\n\n\n\n                                                 329\n\f                                                                          (,---\"\"\n\n330\n\n\n\n\nthe Appellate Court, and in consideration of the bad faith exercised by Plaintiffs in bringing this\n\naction.\n\n          21.       Plaintiffs first filed their suit against PISD on May 29, 2009.\n\n          22.       PISD complied with all provisions of Chapter 551 of the Texas Government Code\n\nconcerning the posting of notice of PISD's school board meetings and in particular the meeting\n\nof March 26, 2009 which were the subject of trial.\n\n                                          B. Conclusions of Law\n\n          1.        PISD complied with all provisions of Chapter 551 of the Texas Government Code\n\nconcerning the posting of notice of PISD's school board meetings, both physical posting and\n\ninternet posting, and in particular the meeting of March 26, 2009 which were the subject of trial.\n\n               2.       Any failure on the part of PISD to post an internet notice of an upcoming\n\nschool board meeting on its website from January 2009 through May 19, 2009 as required by\n\nSection 551.056 of the Texas Government Code was due to a technical problem beyond the\n\ncontrol of PISD and PISD exercised good faith efforts to comply with the requirements of\n\nChapter 551 concerning internet posting notices.\n\n          3.
