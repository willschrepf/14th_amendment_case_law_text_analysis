We answer in the affirmative.\n\n\n\n                                                 I.\n\n       On March 24, 1994, the United States District Court for the Middle District\n\nof Alabama consolidated several race discrimination cases1 brought by African-\n\nAmericans against the State of Alabama, and several of its boards, departments,\n\nand agencies;2 they also sued the Governor of Alabama and other state officials in\n\n\n       1\n         Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 42(a) provides that, “[w]hen actions involving a\ncommon question of law or fact are pending before the court, it may order a joint hearing or trial\nof any or all the matters in issue in the actions; it may order all the actions consolidated; and it\nmay make such orders concerning proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or\ndelay.”\n       2\n        The named defendants in this case include the following boards, departments, and\nagencies of the State of Alabama: the Personnel Board, the Department of Corrections, the\nAlcoholic Beverage Control Board, the Emergency Management Agency, the Department of\nEconomics and Community Affairs, the Industrial Development Training Agency, the Bureau of\nTourism and Travel, the Department of Agriculture and Industries, the Department of Education,\nthe Department of Revenue, the Department of Public Health, the Development Office, the\nRetirement System of Alabama, Voters Registration, the Department of Human Resources, the\nDepartment of Mental Health, the Medicaid Agency, the Board of Public Accounting, the\n\n                                                 2\n\fboth their individual and official capacities.3 Some of the cases were class actions\n\nin which plaintiffs sued on behalf of themselves and all other black persons who\n\nare employed, have been employed, or who may in the future be employed by the\n\ndefendants.4 Plaintiffs claimed, inter alia, discrimination against African-\n\nAmericans\n\n       in layoffs, recalls from layoffs, terminations, discipline, hiring,\n       rehiring, evaluations, compensation, transfers, job duty assignments,\n       recruitment, screening, selection procedures, denial of promotions,\n       demotions, rollbacks, sick leave, subjective decision-making\n       practices, and other terms and conditions of employment which have\n       resulted in disparate impact and treatment of the plaintiff-intervenors\n       and the plaintiff class.\n\nThey sought declaratory, injunctive, and compensatory relief under Title VII of the\n\nCivil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000(e), et seq., and 42 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 1981 and 1983 (1994).\n\n\n\n\nCommission on Physical Fitness, the Labor Board, the State Docks Department, and the\nDepartment of Transportation.\n       3\n         In this case, we are concerned only with the disparate impact provisions of Title VII.\nWe are aware that Title VII “provides relief only against ‘employers’ as defined under the\nstatute.” Llampallas v. Mini-Circuits, Lab, Inc., 163 F.3d 1236, 1243 (11th Cir. 1998), cert.\ndenied, 120 S. Ct. 327 (1999). We note the individual defendants only as background.\n       4\n           The issue of class certification is currently pending before the district court.\n\n                                                    3\n\f       On October 7, 1997, the State of Alabama and all parties named as\n\ndefendants moved the court, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1),5 to\n\ndismiss any and all claims arising under Title VII that were\n\n       predicated upon a disparate impact theory of discrimination[,] on the\n       separate grounds that (a) the assertion of such claims against the State\n       is barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity embodied in the\n       Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution and (b)\n       Congress did not express an unequivocal intent to waive immunity\n       from such claims.\n\nThe district court denied defendants’ motion without prejudice, citing its recent\n\ndecision in Reynolds v. Alabama Department of Transportation, 4 F. Supp. 2d\n\n1092 (M.D. Ala. 1998).6 Defendants moved the court to issue a final, appealable\n\norder under Federal Rule 54(b), and the court granted defendants’ motion, vacating\n\nits earlier order, and denying defendants’ motion for dismissal on the merits.\n\nAgain citing its decision in Reynolds, the district court held that the Eleventh\n\n\n\n\n       5\n          Rule 12(b)(1) provides that the defendant may assert the defense that the court lacks\njurisdiction over the subject matter of the case.\n       6\n         The court denied the motion without prejudice because the identical issue was raised in\nReynolds, and the court assumed that the state defendants in Reynolds would appeal the court’s\ndecision that the Eleventh Amendment was not a bar to private suits under Title VII predicated\non a disparate impact theory of liability. The defendants in Reynolds did appeal to this court,\nand a resolution of their appeal has been stayed pending the disposition of this appeal.\n\n                                                 4\n\fAmendment did not bar private suits against states under Title VII, which are\n\npredicated on a disparate impact theory of liability. Defendants timely appealed.7\n\n\n\n                                                II.\n\n       A district court’s order denying or granting a motion to dismiss a complaint\n\nagainst a state based on the Eleventh Amendment’s grant of sovereign immunity is\n\nreviewed by this court de novo. See Seminole Tribe v. Florida, 11 F.3d 1016,\n\n1021 (11th Cir. 1994), aff’d on other grounds, 517 U.S. 44, 116 S. Ct. 1114, 134 L.\n\nEd. 2d 252 (1996).\n\n\n\n                                               III.\n\n       In resolving the issues presented on this appeal, it is helpful to look first at\n\nthe anatomy of a Title VII discrimination case that employs disparate impact\n\n\n\n\n       7\n         Although states can waive their sovereign immunity, the Eleventh Amendment has been\ninterpreted as a jurisdictional barrier to the power of the federal courts. See Hans v. Louisiana,\n134 U.S. 1, 15, 10 S. Ct. 504, 507, 33 L. Ed. 842 (1890) (“The truth is that the cognizance of\nsuits and actions unknown to the law, and forbidden by the law, was not contemplated by the\nconstitution when establishing the judicial power of the United States.”). As such, the Supreme\nCourt has held that a district court order denying a claim by a state or a state entity to Eleventh\nAmendment immunity from suit in federal court may be appealed under the collateral order\ndoctrine of Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 69 S. Ct. 1221, 93 L. Ed.\n1528 (1949). See Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Auth. v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc., 506 U.S.\n139, 113 S. Ct. 684, 121 L. Ed. 2d 605 (1993).\n\n                                                5\n\fmethodology.8 The genesis of the disparate impact theory lies in the Supreme\n\nCourt’s decision in Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 91 S. Ct. 849, 28 L.\n\nEd. 2d 158 (1971). The question presented in Griggs was\n\n       whether an employer is prohibited by the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\n       Title VII, from requiring a high school education or passing of a\n       standardized general intelligence test as a condition of employment in\n       or transfer to jobs when (a) neither standard is shown to be\n       significantly related to successful job performance, (b) both\n       requirements operate to disqualify Negroes at a substantially higher\n       rate than white applicants, and (c) the jobs in question formerly had\n       been filled only by white employees as part of a longstanding practice\n       of giving preference to whites.\n\n\n\n\n       8\n         We use the term “disparate impact” to distinguish from cases brought under the\n“disparate treatment” rationale. See, e.g., McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93\nS. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973) (discussing burdens of proof in a disparate treatment case).\nAlso, whenever the Attorney General “has reasonable cause to believe that any person or group\nof persons is engaged in a pattern or practice” of discrimination, he or she may bring an\nappropriate lawsuit. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6(a) (1994); see, e.g., Hazelwood Sch. Dist. v. United\nStates, 433 U.S. 299, 97 S. Ct. 2736, 53 L. Ed. 2d 768 (1977); International Bhd. of Teamsters v.\nUnited States, 431 U.S. 324, 97 S. Ct. 1843, 52 L. Ed. 2d (1977). In both disparate treatment and\npattern or practice cases, the plaintiffs are ultimately required to demonstrate discriminatory\nintent on the part of the employer.\n\n                                               6\n\fId. at 425-26, 91 S. Ct. at 851.9 Prior to the date of Title VII’s enactment, the\n\ndefendant company in Griggs had openly discriminated on the basis of race in the\n\nhiring and assignment of its employees. When the company abandoned its policy\n\nof de jure discrimination, it made the completion of high school a prerequisite for\n\nemployees who wanted to transfer from the company’s labor department (the only\n\ndepartment previously employing African-Americans) to any other department in\n\nthe company (all of which formerly hired only whites). The Court found that the\n\nhigh school requirement, as well as other standardized tests used by the defendant,\n\nhad a disparate impact on African-Americans because “[i]n North Carolina . . .,\n\nwhile 34% of white males had completed high school, only 12 % of Negro males\n\nhad done so.” Id. at 430 n.6, 91 S. Ct. at 853 n.6. Similarly, “with respect to\n\nstandardized tests, the EEOC in one case found that use of a battery of tests,\n\n\n       9\n        The particular provisions of Title VII interpreted by the Supreme Court in Griggs were\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(2) and (h):\n       (a) It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer–\n       ....\n                (2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees in any way which would\n       deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or\n       otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee, because of such individual’s\n       race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\n       ....\n       (h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, it shall not be an unlawful\n       employment practice for an employer . . . to give and to act upon the results of\n       any professionally developed ability test provided that such test, its administration\n       or action upon the results is not designed, intended or used to discriminate\n       because of race, color, religion, sex or national origin . . . .\nSee Griggs, 401 U.S. at 426 n.1, 91 S Ct. at 851 n.1.\n\n                                               7\n\fincluding the Wonderlic and Bennett tests used by the Company in the instant case,\n\nresulted in 58% of whites passing the tests, as compared with only 6% of the\n\nblacks.” Id. Despite this showing of disparate impact, the company continued to\n\nutilize the tests even though “neither the high school completion requirement nor\n\nthe general intelligence test [was] shown to bear a demonstrable relationship to\n\nsuccessful performance of the jobs for which it was used.” Id. at 431, 91 S. Ct. at\n\n853. Given these facts, the Supreme Court reversed the Fourth Circuit’s holding\n\nthat “a subjective test of the employer’s intent should govern” Title VII analysis,\n\nid. at 428, 91 S. Ct. at 852, and concluded that “[u]nder the Act, practices,\n\nprocedures, or tests neutral on their face, and even neutral in terms of intent, cannot\n\nbe maintained if they operate to ‘freeze’ the status quo of prior discriminatory\n\nemployment practices,” id. at 430, 91 S. Ct. at 853. From Griggs, therefore,\n\nemerges the now familiar formulation of the core of a disparate impact analysis:\n\n      The Act proscribes not only overt discrimination but also practices\n      that are fair in form, but discriminatory in operation. The touchstone\n      is business necessity. If an employment practice which operates to\n      exclude Negroes cannot be shown to be related to job performance,\n      the practice is prohibited.\n\nId. at 431, 91 S. Ct. at 853.\n\n      Since Griggs, Congress has codified the appropriate burdens of proof in a\n\ndisparate impact case in 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k) (1994), and a settled jurisprudence\n\n\n                                           8\n\fhas arisen to implement the methodology. In the first stage of a disparate impact\n\ncase, the “complaining party [must] demonstrate[] that a respondent uses a\n\nparticular employment practice that causes a disparate impact on the basis of race,\n\ncolor, religion, sex, or national origin.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)(1)(A)(i).10 To\n\n“demonstrate” means to “meet[] the burdens of production and persuasion.” 42\n\nU.S.C. § 2000e(m) (1994). In other words, in order to surmount the first hurdle in\n\na disparate impact race discrimination case, the plaintiff must make out a prima\n\nfacie case “that [a] facially neutral employment practice ha[s] a significantly\n\ndiscriminatory impact.” Connecticut v. Teal, 457 U.S. 440, 446, 102 S. Ct. 2525,\n\n2530, 73 L. Ed. 2d 130 (1982). Demonstrating disparate impact in the first\n\ninstance can be tricky business; it often involves ominous-sounding methods of\n\nstatistical inquiry like “multiple regression analysis,” see Eastland v. TVA, 704\n\nF.2d 613, 621 (11th Cir. 1983), “standard deviation,” see Watson v. Fort Worth\n\nBank & Trust, 487 U.S. 977, 995 n.3, 108 S. Ct. 2777, 2789 n.3, 101 L. Ed. 2d 827\n\n(1988) (plurality), and the EEOC’s “four-fifths rule,” see id. But what the plaintiff\n\nmust attempt to do is show that there is a legally significant disparity between (a)\n\nthe racial composition, caused by the challenged employment practice, of the pool\n\n       10\n           The statute also provides that “if the complaining party can demonstrate to the court\nthat the elements of a respondent’s decisionmaking process are not capable of separation for\nanalysis, the decisionmaking process may be analyzed as one employment practice.” 42 U.S.C.\n§ 2000e-2(k)(1)(B)(i).\n\n                                                9\n\fof those enjoying a job or job benefit; and (b) the racial composition of the\n\nqualified applicant pool.11 See Wards Cove Packing Co., Inc. v. Atonio, 490 U.S.\n\n642, 650-51, 109 S. Ct. 2115, 2121, 104 L. Ed. 2d 733 (1989); Edwards v. Wallace\n\nCommunity College, 49 F.3d 1517, 1520 (11th Cir. 1995).\n\n       The focus during this first stage of the inquiry, and indeed during the whole\n\nof the disparate impact analysis, is on defining the qualified applicant pool. In\n\norder to determine whether an employment practice causes a “disparate” impact,\n\nthe court must gain some handle on the baseline racial composition that the impact\n\nis “disparate” from; that is, what should the racial composition of the job force\n\nlook like absent the offending employment practice. “[S]tatistics based on an\n\napplicant pool containing individuals lacking minimal qualifications for the job\n\nwould be of little probative value.” Watson, 487 U. S. at 997, 108 S. Ct. at 2790\n\n(plurality). The Supreme Court has described as “nonsensical” comparisons to a\n\nbaseline pool that is not adequately tailored to reflect only those potential\n\napplicants who are actually qualified for the job or job benefit at issue. Wards\n\n\n\n       11\n          We include the term “job benefit” to indicate that the disparate impact analysis can be\nused to challenge employment practices that have a disparate impact at any level of the\nemployment structure, from hiring to promotions to levels of compensation.\n        We use the term “qualified applicant pool” to indicate that the pool of potential\nemployees from which employers should choose, absent any discrimination, may include\npersons who are not actual applicants for the job or job benefit at issue; by “qualified applicant\npool” we mean the pool from which potential qualified applicants might come.\n\n                                                10\n\fCove, 490 U.S. at 651, 109 S. Ct. at 2122; see also New York Transit Auth. v.\n\nBeazer, 440 U.S. 568, 585-86, 99 S. Ct. 1355, 1365-66, 59 L. Ed. 2d 587 (1979)\n\n(where plaintiffs challenged city’s policy of not employing persons using\n\nmethadone as having a disparate impact on blacks and Hispanics, statistics\n\nindicating the racial composition of methadone users throughout the whole city\n\n“tells us nothing about the class of otherwise-qualified applicants and\n\nemployees[,]” in part because “a substantial portion of the persons included in [the\n\ncity-wide figures] are either unqualified for other reasons – such as the illicit use of\n\ndrugs and alcohol – or have received successful assistance in finding jobs with\n\nemployers other than [the defendant]”); Maddox v. Claytor, 764 F.2d 1539, 1549-\n\n50 (11th Cir. 1985) (holding that plaintiff’s statistics did not “shed any light on the\n\nlegally relevant issue” because they did not indicate “the group of applicants who\n\nwere interviewed, or even the group of applicants found qualified or the group of\n\nall applicants”). “To adequately assess statistical data, there must be evidence\n\nidentifying the basic qualifications [for the job or job benefit at issue] and a\n\ndetermination, based upon these qualifications, of the relevant statistical pool with\n\nwhich to make the appropriate comparisons.” Peightal v. Metropolitan Dade\n\nCounty, 26 F.3d 1545, 1553-54 (11th Cir. 1994) (discussing statistical comparison\n\n\n\n\n                                           11\n\fevidence in the context of county’s attempt to establish compelling interest for\n\naffirmative action plan because of past discrimination).\n\n      The contest between the plaintiff and defendant is one in which both seek to\n\nanswer the question of who is qualified, and thus to define the qualified applicant\n\npool on their own terms. Definition of a qualified applicant pool will shift with the\n\nnature of the job or job benefit, and the nature of the challenged employment\n\npractice at issue. At different times, courts have found qualified applicant pools to\n\nbe adequately represented by regional populations, see International Bhd. of\n\nTeamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 337 n.17, 97 S. Ct. 1843, 1855-56 n.17,\n\n52 L. Ed. 2d 396 (1977) (finding regional population figures to be probative in a\n\npattern or practice discrimination suit), or even national population statistics, see\n\nDothard v. Rawlinson, 433 U.S. 321, 329-30, 97 S. Ct. 2720, 2727, 53 L. Ed. 2d\n\n786 (1977); Kilgo v. Bowman Transp., Inc., 789 F.2d 859, 870 (11th Cir. 1986).\n\nUsing population figures as a proxy for the qualified applicant pool becomes\n\ntroublesome, however, “[w]hen special qualifications are required to fill particular\n\njobs.” Hazelwood Sch.

Courts have thus sometimes found helpful a\n\nshowing of the racial composition of the pool of those who actually applied for a\n\nparticular job or job benefit, see Teal, 457 U.S. at 443, 102 S. Ct. at 2528-29\n\n(analyzing racial composition of the pool of persons who actually took written\n\nexamination administered by employer); Nash v.

But\n\neven actual applicant statistics may “not adequately reflect the actual potential\n\napplicant pool, since otherwise qualified people might be discouraged from\n\napplying because of a self-recognized inability to meet the very standards\n\nchallenged as being discriminatory.” Dothard, 433 U.S. at 330, 97 S. Ct. at 2727;\n\nsee also Wards Cove, 490 U.S. at 651 n.7, 109 S.

Ct. at 2727-28. This includes evidence that the plaintiffs have\n\nsimply erred in their calculations or evidence that the plaintiffs have failed\n\nsufficiently to tailor their qualified applicant pool. See id. at 338-39, 97 S. Ct. at\n\n2731 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in result and concurring in part) (“If the defendants\n\nin a Title VII suit believe there to be any reason to discredit plaintiffs’ statistics\n\nthat does not appear on their face, the opportunity to challenge them is available to\n\nthe defendants just as in any other lawsuit. They may endeavor to impeach the\n\nreliability of the statistical evidence, they may offer rebutting evidence, or they\n\nmay disparage in arguments or in briefs the probative weight which the plaintiffs’\n\nevidence should be accorded.”); Peightal, 26 F.3d at 1556-57.\n\n      The key to this first stage is to understand that the concept of a “disparate\n\nimpact” on one racial group over another only makes sense if we tailor the\n\nqualified applicant pool to reflect only those applicants or potential applicants who\n\nare “otherwise qualified,” Beazer, 440 U.S. at 585, 99 S. Ct. at 1366, (that is,\n\nqualified but for their failure to meet the challenged employment requirement) for\n\nthe job or job benefit at issue. If the court fails to define the qualified applicant\n\npool in an appropriately specific manner, then the challenged employment practice\n\n\n                                            14\n\fhas not actually been shown to be “causing” any “disparate impact.” Something\n\nelse, unrelated to the employer’s practices and procedures, may be holding back a\n\nparticular racial group. An example might help clarify our rationale. Consider a\n\ncommunity composed of equal numbers of African-Americans and whites. There\n\nare, let us say, 1,000 blacks and 1,000 whites. Now, imagine that within this\n\ncommunity, an employer announces that it is going to hire eighty new employees,\n\nall for identical labor positions, and that it will only consider applicants who have a\n\nhigh school diploma. The correlation between educational attainment and race in\n\nthe community breaks down as follows: 30% of the African-American segment has\n\na high school diploma (70% does not), whereas 50% of the white segment has a\n\nhigh school diploma (50% does not). Now assume that 100 blacks and 100 whites\n\napply for the eighty jobs. Their educational attainment corresponds in all respects\n\nto that of the community at large; that is, thirty of the African-Americans have a\n\nhigh school education, as do fifty of the whites. Citing its high school degree\n\nrequirement, the employer hires the thirty blacks and the fifty whites with high\n\nschool degrees.\n\n      When the seventy rejected black applicants file suit against the employer,\n\nclaiming that the high school degree requirement has a disparate impact on\n\nAfrican-Americans in violation of Title VII, the employer responds by introducing\n\n\n                                          15\n\fevidence that, due to unexplained population trends, 40% of the black segment of\n\nthe community is under the age of 18, but all 1000 whites are age 18 or over.\n\nFurther, this population figure corresponds positively with the pool of applicants\n\nfor the jobs at issue; forty of the 100 black applicants were under 18 years of age,\n\nbut all of the whites were 18 or over. Therefore, even if the employer discontinued\n\nits high school diploma requirement, the forty black applicants under age 18 would\n\nnot have been hired because the relevant labor laws preclude hiring underage\n\npersons.\n\n      If the African-American plaintiffs continue to assert their claim of disparate\n\nimpact, they would in one sense be correct. The high school education\n\nrequirement certainly does have a disparate impact on blacks because more than\n\n1.65 times as many whites as blacks have high school diplomas; therefore, 1.65\n\ntimes as many whites will be hired, in a community composed of equal numbers of\n\nblacks and whites. A finding of disparate impact is only plausible in this situation,\n\nhowever, if one neglects to consider the qualified applicant pool. The unstated\n\npremise to the conclusion that disparate impact has reared its ugly head in this\n\nhypothetical is that because the community as a whole is composed of equal\n\nnumbers of blacks and whites, the eighty employment positions should also be\n\nfilled with equal numbers of blacks and whites; but this is not the case. If the\n\n\n                                          16\n\femployer’s population evidence is credible, then the qualified applicant pool\n\nincludes only 60% of the blacks (because 40% are underage), but all of the whites.\n\nWhat we would expect, given these facts, is that the employment outcome absent\n\nthe high school requirement would mimic that produced when a high school\n\ndiploma is required – over 1.65 times as many whites as blacks will be hired\n\nbecause over 1.65 times as many are of working age. Under these facts, it is clear\n\nthat the plaintiffs have not demonstrated that the high school diploma requirement\n\nhas a disparate impact in the first instance.\n\n       Once the plaintiffs have met their burden of demonstrating that a challenged\n\nemployment practice causes a disparate impact, the burden shifts to the defendant\n\nemployer “to demonstrate that the challenged practice is job related for the position\n\nin question and consistent with business necessity.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-\n\n2(k)(1)(A)(i).12 Alternatively, the complaining party can demonstrate “that other\n\ntests or selection devices, without a similarly undesirable racial effect, would also\n\nserve the employer’s legitimate interest in ‘efficient and trustworthy\n\n\n\n       12\n          The 1991 amendments to Title VII, inter alia, reversed the Supreme Court’s\ninterpretation in Wards Cove, 490 U.S. at 659, 109 S. Ct. at 2126, where the Court held that\ndefendants only need to meet the burden of production, but not persuasion, during the second\nstage of a disparate impact case. Section 2000e-2(k)(1)(A)(i) requires an employer to\n“demonstrate” that the challenged practice is a job related business necessity, and as noted,\nsupra, to “demonstrate” means to “meet[] the burdens of production and persuasion.” 42 U.S.C.\n§ 2000e(m).\n\n                                             17\n\fworkmanship.’ ” Albermarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 425, 95 S. Ct.\n\n2362, 2375, 45 L. Ed. 2d 280 (1975) (quoting McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 81,\n\n93 S. Ct. at 1823); see 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)(1)(A)(ii). Though this second stage\n\nshifts the burden of demonstration to the defendant, the ultimate focus of the\n\ninquiry remains on the question of who should be included in the qualified\n\napplicant pool. If the employer can demonstrate that the practice at issue is a job\n\nrelated business necessity, then the employer has shown that there is no ultimate\n\ndisparate impact; this is because the qualified applicant pool would only include\n\nthose persons who could meet the employer’s challenged criteria. For instance, in\n\nthe above hypothetical, if we relax the assumptions with regard to age and race in\n\nthe community, and posit that equal numbers of blacks and whites (say 80% of\n\neach) are of working age, then the African-American plaintiffs might be successful\n\nin carrying their prima facie burden of demonstrating that the high school diploma\n\nrequirement has a disparate impact on blacks (because only 30% of blacks, as\n\nopposed to 50% of whites, have a high school education). If the employer is\n\nsuccessful in demonstrating that a high school education is a job related business\n\nnecessity for the job at issue, then what the employer has done, in effect, is to\n\ndemonstrate that the requirement does not actually cause a disparate impact. A\n\nfinding of business necessity is equivalent to a finding that the qualified applicant\n\n\n                                          18\n\fpool only includes those persons who have attained a high school degree.\n\nLikewise, if the employer failed to demonstrate business necessity, then the\n\nplaintiffs would have succeeded in proving disparate impact in the ultimate sense;\n\nthis is because the qualified applicant pool would include those persons of working\n\nage who did not posses the required education.\n\n       If the court ultimately finds that the employer has violated the disparate\n\nimpact provisions of Title VII, and is therefore engaged in an unlawful\n\nemployment practice, the court may order a wide range of equitable relief under 42\n\nU.S.C. § 2000e-5(g)(1) (1994).13 Principally, the court should enjoin the employer\n\n\n\n       13\n           42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(g)(1) provides:\n        If the court finds that the respondent has intentionally engaged in or is\n        intentionally engaging in an unlawful employment practice charged in the\n        complaint, the court may enjoin the respondent from engaging in such unlawful\n        employment practice, and order such affirmative action as may be appropriate,\n        which may include, but is not limited to, reinstatement or hiring of employees,\n        with or without back pay (payable by the employer, employment agency, or labor\n        organization, as the case may be, responsible for the unlawful employment\n        practice), or any other equitable relief as the court deems appropriate. Back pay\n        liability shall not accrue from a date more than two years prior to the filing of a\n        charge with the Commission. Interim earnings or amounts earnable with\n        reasonable diligence by the person or persons discriminated against shall operate\n        to reduce the back pay otherwise allowable.\n        The statutory requirement that the court find that the employer has “intentionally\nengaged” in the unlawful employment practice does not mean that this remedial provision is only\napplicable in disparate treatment or pattern or practice cases. “[Section 2000e-5(g)] requires\nonly that the defendant meant to do what he did, that is, his employment practice was not\naccidental.” Local 189, United Papermakers and Paperworkers, AFL-CIO, CLC v. United\nStates, 416 F.2d 980, 996 (5th Cir. 1969); see also Robinson v. Lorillard Corp., 444 F.2d 791,\n796 (4th Cir. 1971). The full range of equitable remedies are available in disparate impact cases\nas well.\n\n                                               19\n\ffrom continuing the use of the challenged practice. As for individual relief, if an\n\nindividual plaintiff has shown that he or she was within the class of persons\n\nnegatively impacted by the unlawful employment practice, then the employer must\n\nbe given an opportunity to demonstrate a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason why,\n\nabsent the offending practice, the individual plaintiff would not have been awarded\n\nthe job or job benefit at issue anyway. See Stephen v. PGA Sheraton Resort, Ltd.,\n\n873 F.2d 276, 278-79 (11th Cir. 1989); Ross v. Buckeye Cellulose Corp., 733 F.\n\nSupp. 363, 377 (M.D. Ga. 1990), rev’d on other grounds, 980 F.2d 648 (11th Cir.\n\n1993). If the employer cannot so demonstrate, then individual relief may be\n\nmerited.\n\n\n\n                                               IV.\n\n       The Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution states that “[t]he Judicial\n\npower of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity\n\ncommenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by\n\nCitizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.” The Amendment has been interpreted as a\n\njurisdictional bar on the federal courts from hearing suits brought against states by\n\ntheir own citizens, or by citizens of other states. See Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U.S. 1, 15,\n\n10 S. Ct. 504, 507, 33 L. Ed. 842 (1890). Under Seminole Tribe v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44,\n\n\n\n                                                20\n\f116 S. Ct. 1114, 134 L. Ed. 2d (1996), Congress may abrogate a state’s sovereign\n\nimmunity, but it can only do so if: (a) Congress “unequivocally expressed its intent\n\nto abrogate the immunity,” through “a clear legislative statement;” and (b)\n\nCongress has acted “pursuant to a valid exercise of power.” Id. at 55, 116 S. Ct. at\n\n1123 (quoting Green v. Mansour, 474 U.S. 64, 68, 106 S. Ct. 423, 426, 88 L. Ed.\n\n2d 371 (1985) ). Defendants claim that neither prong is satisfied with regard to the\n\ndisparate impact provisions of Title VII. We now address their arguments in turn.\n\n\n\n                                               A.\n\n       Defendants first argue that in enacting the disparate impact provisions of\n\nTitle VII, Congress failed to express a clear legislative statement of its intent to\n\nabrogate the states’ sovereign immunity. We need address this contention only\n\nbriefly. When Title VII was first enacted in 1964, its coverage was not extended to\n\nstate and local governments. In 1972, the statute was amended to include\n\n“governments, governmental agencies, [and] political subdivisions.” 42 U.S.C. §\n\n2000e(a).14\n\n       14\n         In Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U.S. 445, 449 n.2, 96 S. Ct. 2666, 2668 n.2, 49 L. Ed. 2d\n614 (1976), the Supreme Court described the statutory change as follows:\n       [T]he definition of ‘person’ in § 701(a) of the 1964 Act, 78 Stat. 253, 42 U.S.C. §\n       2000e(a), was amended by § 2(1) of the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of\n       1972 (hereinafter the 1972 Amendments), 86 Stat. 103, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(a)\n       (1970 ed., Supp. IV), to include ‘governments, governmental agencies, [and]\n\n                                                21\n\f      Seminole Tribe reaffirmed the principle that Congress may abrogate the\n\nstates’ sovereign immunity when acting pursuant to its Fourteenth Amendment\n\nenforcement power. See 517 U.S. at 65-66, 116 S. Ct. at 1128. The Fourteenth\n\nAmendment states, in relevant part:\n\n      Section 1. . . . No State shall make or enforce any law which shall\n      abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States;\n      nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property,\n      without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its\n      jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\n      ....\n      Section 5. The Congress shall have the power to enforce, by\n      appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.\n\nIn Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, the Supreme Court concluded that,\n\n      [i]n the 1972 Amendments to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of\n      1964, Congress, acting under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment,\n      authorized federal courts to award money damages in favor of a\n      private individual against a state government found to have subjected\n\n\n\n      political subdivisions.’\n              The express exclusion of ‘a State or political subdivision thereof’ provided\n      in § 701(b) of the former was stricken by § 2(2) of the latter, 86 Stat. 103, 42\n      U.S.C. § 2000e(b) (1970 ed., Supp. IV). Section 2(5) of the 1972 Amendments,\n      86 Stat. 103, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(f) (1970 ed., Supp. IV), amended § 701(f) of the\n      1964 Act, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(f), to include wihin the definition of ‘employee’\n      those individuals ‘subject to the civil service laws of a State government,\n      governmental agency or political subdivision.’\n              The 1972 Amendments retained the right of an individual aggrieved by an\n      employer’s unlawful employment practice to sue on his or her own behalf, upon\n      satisfaction of the statutory procedural prerequisites, and made clear that that right\n      was being extended to persons aggrieved by public employers. See 1972\n      Amendments, § 4(a), 86 Stat. 104, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e-5(a)-(g) (1970 ed., Supp.\n      IV).\n\n                                               22\n\f      that person to employment discrimination on the basis of ‘race, color,\n      religion, sex, or national origin.’\n\n427 U.S. at 447-48, 96 S. Ct. at 2667. The Court also stated that “[t]here is no\n\ndispute that in enacting the 1972 Amendments to Title VII to extend coverage to\n\nthe States as employers, Congress exercised its power under § 5 of the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment.” Id. at 453 n.9, 96 S. Ct. at 2670 n.9. Given this clear precedential\n\nguidance, we have no hesitation in concluding that Congress unequivocally\n\nexpressed its intent to abrogate the states’ Eleventh Amendment immunity when it\n\namended Title VII to cover state and local governments.\n\n      Defendants argue that subsequent Supreme Court decisions dealing with the\n\nclarity with which Congress must express its intent to abrogate, such as Dellmuth\n\nv. Muth, 491 U.S. 223, 228, 109 S. Ct. 2397, 2400, 105 L. Ed. 2d 181 (1989), and\n\nAtascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U.S. 234, 239-40, 105 S. Ct. 3142,\n\n3146, 87 L. Ed. 2d 171 (1985), compel a reconsideration of Fitzpatrick. We are\n\nunable to reconsider Fitzpatrick since the Supreme Court has clearly held that “if a\n\nprecedent of this Court has direct application in a case, yet appears to rest on\n\nreasons rejected in some other line of decisions, the Court of Appeals should\n\nfollow the case which directly controls, leaving to this Court the prerogative of\n\noverruling its own decisions.” Agostini v. Felton, 521 U.S. 203, 237, 117 S. Ct.\n\n1997, 2017, 138 L. Ed. 2d 391 (1997) (quoting Rodriguez de Quijas v.\n\n                                          23\n\fShearson/American Express, Inc., 490 U.S. 477, 484, 109 S. Ct. 1917, 1921-22,\n\n104 L. Ed. 2d 526 (1989)). In light of the fact that Seminole Tribe cited Fitzpatrick\n\napprovingly, we do not even think tenable the suggestion that the Supreme Court\n\nhas “rejected” the reasoning in Fitzpatrick;15 even if we did think defendants’\n\ncontention had some merit, however, it is for the Supreme Court, and not us, to\n\nreconsider its own precedent.\n\n       Defendants next make the somewhat novel argument that since Congress did\n\nnot codify the burdens of proof in disparate impact cases until 1991, see Pub. L.\n\nNo. 102-166, § 105, 105 Stat. 1071, 1074 (codified at 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)), it\n\ncould not have meant to subject states to disparate impact suits (as opposed to\n\ndisparate treatment, or pattern or practice suits) when it amended Title VII to cover\n\nstate and local governments in 1972. This argument misunderstands the evolution\n\nof the disparate impact theory. Disparate impact analysis did not spring forth anew\n\n\n       15\n         See Seminole Tribe, 517 U.S. at 59, 116 S. Ct. at 1125 (internal citations omitted),\nwhere the Supreme Court stated:\n       In Fitzpatrick, we recognized that the Fourteenth Amendment, by expanding\n       federal power at the expense of state autonomy, had fundamentally altered the\n       balance of state and federal power struck by the Constitution. We noted that § 1\n       of the Fourteenth Amendment contained prohibitions expressly directed at the\n       States and that § 5 of the Amendment expressly provided that “The Congress\n       shall have the power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this\n       article.’ We held that through the Fourteenth Amendment, federal power\n       extended to intrude upon the province of the Eleventh Amendment and therefore\n       that § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment allowed Congress to abrogate the\n       immunity from suit guaranteed by that Amendment.\n\n                                               24\n\fin 1991; as discussed, supra, in 1971 the Supreme Court interpreted the original\n\nCivil Rights Act of 1964, particularly sections 2000e-2(a)(2) and (h), see, supra,\n\nn.9, to prohibit “practices that are fair in form, but discriminatory in operation.”\n\nGriggs, 401 U.S. at 431, 91 S. Ct. at 853. The Supreme Court has explicitly found\n\nthat “Congress recognized and endorsed the disparate-impact analysis employed by\n\nthe Court in Griggs,” Teal, 457 U.S. at 447 n.8, 102 S. Ct. at 2531 n.8, and that\n\n“Congress indicated [in the 1972 amendments] the intent that the same Title VII\n\nprinciples be applied to governmental and private employers alike.” Dothard, 433\n\nU.S. at 331 n.14, 97 S. Ct. at 2728 n.14. There is no indication that, by enacting\n\nthe 1991 amendments, Congress sought to do anything more than reaffirm and\n\nstrengthen the disparate impact analysis, see supra, n.12 and part II. Therefore,\n\ndefendants’ argument, while interesting, is meritless because it is clear that\n\nCongress has, indeed, sought to subject states to disparate impact lability under\n\nTitle VII.\n\n\n\n                                          B.\n\n      The state next contends that even if Congress has expressed its intent to\n\nabrogate the states’ Eleventh Amendment immunity, it has not acted “pursuant to a\n\nvalid exercise of power.” Seminole Tribe, 517 U.S. at 55, 116 S.

Specifically, the state contends that the disparate\n\nimpact provisions of Title VII are not a valid exercise of Congress’ Fourteenth\n\nAmendment enforcement power.\n\n\n\n                                               i.\n\n       Our adjudication of this issue would seem to be largely foreclosed by the\n\nformer Fifth Circuit’s decision in Scott v. City of Anniston, 597 F.2d 897, 900 (5th\n\nCir. 1979),16 in which the court held that “Title VII is unquestionably appropriate\n\nlegislation to enforce the equal protection clause” and that “the ‘disproportionate\n\nimpact’ standard [articulated in Griggs] [is] an appropriate means of fulfilling\n\nthose objectives.” See also Allen v. Alabama State Bd. of Educ., 816 F.2d 575,\n\n577 (11th Cir. 1987) (holding that “in civil actions invoking Title VII, state\n\ndefendants lack eleventh amendment protection”). In Scott, black employees of\n\nthe Public Works Department of the City of Anniston, Alabama, sued their\n\nemployer claiming that certain of the city’s employment practices had a disparate\n\nimpact on African-Americans. The City argued, and the district court ruled, that\n\ngovernment entities could not be made subject to disparate impact claims under\n\n\n       16\n           In Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc), this\ncourt adopted as binding precedent all of the decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down\nprior to the close of business on September 30, 1981.\n\n                                               26\n\fTitle VII because “the legislature could not by statute create a right of action\n\nsubject to less stringent requirements than those imposed by that amendment\n\nalone.” Scott, 597 F.2d at 899. Because Supreme Court decisions like Washington\n\nv. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 96 S. Ct. 2040, 48 L. Ed. 2d 597 (1976), require plaintiffs\n\nto show that a government entity acted with discriminatory intent in order to\n\ndemonstrate a Fourteenth Amendment violation, the district court in Scott reasoned\n\nthat subjecting government agencies to disparate impact claims (which do not\n\nrequire a showing of discriminatory intent) was not within the congressional\n\nprerogative. The former Fifth Circuit reversed, finding that Title VII disparate\n\nimpact analysis rested squarely within Congress’ Section 5, Fourteenth\n\nAmendment power. See Scott, 597 F.2d at 900.\n\n      Defendants argue, first, that Scott is inapposite because the plaintiffs in Scott\n\nsued a municipality, a government entity not entitled to Eleventh Amendment\n\nsovereign immunity. This argument is wholly unconvincing. The question in\n\nScott was essentially the same as the question of whether Congress has the power\n\nto abrogate a state’s sovereign immunity under Seminole Tribe – that is, has\n\nCongress acted within the confines of its Section 5 power “to enforce, by\n\nappropriate legislation, the provisions” of the Fourteenth Amendment. In Scott,\n\nthe court answered this question in the affirmative. Because we have already\n\n\n                                          27\n\ffound that in amending Title VII to apply to state and local governments, Congress\n\nexpressed its clear intent to abrogate the states’ Eleventh Amendment immunity,\n\nthe court’s holding in Scott that Congress acted validly under Section 5 would\n\nseem to end our inquiry.\n\n      Perhaps sensing the tenuousness of their first argument, defendants next\n\ncontend that the Supreme Court’s decision in City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S.\n\n507, 117 S. Ct. 2157, 138 L. Ed. 2d 624 (1997), has so altered the constitutional\n\nlandscape of what congressional acts can properly be classified as falling within\n\nCongress’ Section 5, Fourteenth Amendment power, that the former Fifth Circuit’s\n\ndecision in Scott has effectively been overruled. Where precedent binding upon\n\nthis court cannot be reconciled with a subsequent Supreme Court decision, we\n\nmust defer to the Supreme Court. Cottrell v. Caldwell, 85 F.3d 1480, 1485 (11th\n\nCir. 1996); United States v. Shenberg, 89 F.3d 1461, 1480 n.23 (11th Cir. 1996).\n\nTherefore, we now address defendants’ City of Boerne claim.\n\n                                         ii.\n\n      The question presented by defendants is whether the disparate impact\n\nscheme, as we have described it in part III, supra, goes so far beyond the\n\nconstitutional command – that no state deny to any person the equal protection of\n\nthe law – that it cannot fit within Congress’ Section 5 enforcement power. In order\n\n\n                                         28\n\fto make out a claim of status-based discrimination in violation of the constitutional\n\nguarantee of equal protection, a plaintiff must prove that a government agent acted\n\nwith “discriminatory purpose,” Davis, 426 U.S. at 239, 96 S. Ct. at 2047;17 the\n\nrequirement of discriminatory motive “implies more than intent as volition or\n\nintent as awareness of consequences. It implies that the decisionmaker . . . selected\n\nor reaffirmed a particular course of action at least in part ‘because of,’ not merely\n\n‘in spite of,’ its adverse effects upon an identifiable group.” Personnel Adm’r v.\n\nFeeney, 442 U.S. 256, 279, 99 S. Ct. 2282, 2296, 60 L. Ed. 2d 870 (1979) (internal\n\ncitations omitted). The Supreme Court has explained that “[d]etermining whether\n\ninvidious discriminatory purpose was a motivating factor demands a sensitive\n\ninquiry into such circumstantial and direct evidence of intent as may be available.”\n\nVillage of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252,\n\n266, 97 S. Ct. 555, 564, 50 L. Ed. 2d 450 (1977). Factors a court may consider in\n\n       17\n           Davis was the first case in which the Supreme Court expressly stated, “We have never\nheld that the constitutional standard for adjudicating claims of invidious racial discrimination is\nidentical to the standards applicable under Title VII, and we decline to do so today.” Davis, 426\nU.S. at 239, 96 S. Ct. at 2047. The plaintiffs in Davis, black applicants for employment as police\nofficers by the District of Columbia, brought suit under the equal protection component of the\nDue Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment; they claimed that a written personnel test\nadministered by the District of Columbia police department had a racially disparate impact on\nAfrican-Americans. Had the Supreme Court held that plaintiffs using constitutional equal\nprotection analysis to attack allegedly discriminatory state action need not demonstrate a\ndiscriminatory purpose, but only a disparate impact, then every state action having a disparate\nimpact on a particular racial group would have become subject to the Court’s strict scrutiny, “the\nmost demanding test known to constitutional law.” City of Boerne, 521 U.S. at 534, 117 S. Ct.\nat 2171.\n\n                                                29\n\fdetermining whether state action was motivated by discriminatory animus include:\n\n(1) the disparate impact of the official action; (2) the historical background of the\n\ndecision; (3) the specific sequence of events leading up to the challenged decision;\n\nand (4) the legislative or administrative history. See id. at 266-68, 97 S. Ct. at 564-\n\n65.\n\n      Under City of Boerne, it is clear that when Congress is acting pursuant to its\n\nSection 5 enforcement authority, it does not have the power to alter the “substance\n\nof the Fourteenth Amendment’s restrictions on the States.” City of Boerne, 521\n\nU.S. at 519, 117 S. Ct. at 2164. In the equal protection context, this means that the\n\ncore congressional motivation must remain consistent with the notion that what the\n\nConstitution prohibits is intentional discrimination on the part of state actors (and\n\nnot state action that leads to a merely discriminatory result). In City of Boerne,\n\nCongress had enacted the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) in direct\n\nresponse to the Court’s decision in Employment Division, Department of Human\n\nResources v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 110 S. Ct. 1595, 108 L. Ed. 2d 876 (1990). In\n\nSmith, the Court concluded that consistent with the Free Exercise Clause, a state\n\nmay apply neutral, generally applicable laws to religious practices even when those\n\nlaws are not supported by a compelling government interest. With RFRA,\n\nCongress sought to supplant the Court’s interpretation with one more favorable to\n\n\n                                          30\n\freligious interests. The Act attempted to “overrule” Smith by mandating that\n\nneutral laws that substantially burden religious exercise must be justified under the\n\ncompelling government interest test. See City of Boerne, 521 U.S. at 512-15, 117\n\nS. Ct. at 2160-62.\n\n      The Court concluded that Congress had acted beyond the scope of its\n\nFourteenth Amendment enforcement power:\n\n      Congress’ power under § 5 . . . extends only to enforcing the\n      provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court has described\n      this power as ‘remedial.’ The design of the Amendment and the text\n      of § 5 are inconsistent with the suggestion that Congress has the\n      power to decree the substance of the Fourteenth Amendment’s\n      restrictions on the States. Legislation which alters the meaning of the\n      Free Exercise Clause cannot be said to be enforcing the Clause.\n      Congress does not enforce a constitutional right by changing what the\n      right is. It has been given the power ‘to enforce,’ not the power to\n      determine what constitutes a constitutional violation. Were it not so,\n      what Congress would be enforcing would no longer be, in any\n      meaningful sense, the ‘provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment.’\n\nCity of Boerne, 521 U.S. at 519, 117 S. Ct. at 2164 (internal citations omitted).\n\nThe Court emphasized that “[l]egislation which deters or remedies constitutional\n\nviolations can fall within the sweep of Congress’ enforcement power even if in the\n\nprocess it prohibits conduct which is not itself unconstitutional,” id. at 518, 117 S.\n\nCt. at 2163, but “[t]here must be a congruence and proportionality between the\n\ninjury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end. Lacking\n\n\n\n                                          31\n\fsuch a connection, legislation may become substantive in operation and effect,” id.\n\nat 520, 117 S. Ct. at 2164.\n\n      With RFRA, Congress overstepped its bounds with regard to both the\n\n“injury” it sought to prevent, and the “means” it adopted to that end. As for the\n\n“injury” to be prevented, the legislature failed to demonstrate any recent history of\n\nan injury to the free exercise rights of religious practitioners that rose to the level\n\nof a constitutional violation. See id. at 530, 117 S. Ct. at 2169 (“RFRA’s\n\nlegislative record lacks examples of modern instances of generally applicable laws\n\npassed because of religious bigotry. The history of persecution in this country\n\ndetailed in the hearings mentions no episodes occurring in the past 40 years.”).\n\nWith regard to the “means” adopted, Congress prohibited government interference\n\nwith religious exercise in such a sweeping and drastic manner that the Act simply\n\n“[could] not be considered remedial, preventive legislation, if those terms are to\n\nhave any meaning.” Id. at 532, 117 S. Ct. at 2170. As to what a plaintiff class of\n\nreligious observers would have to prove in a case brought under the Act, “RFRA’s\n\nsubstantial burden test . . . [was] not even a discriminatory effects or disparate\n\nimpact test.” Id. at 535, 117 S. Ct. at 2171. Plaintiffs might be able to bring suit\n\n“[w]hen the exercise of religion ha[d] been burdened in an incidental way by a law\n\nof general application.” Id. Once substantial burden was shown, “the State must\n\n\n                                           32\n\fdemonstrate a compelling governmental interest and show that the law is the least\n\nrestrictive means of furthering its interest. . . . Requiring a State to demonstrate a\n\ncompelling interest and show that it has adopted the least restrictive means of\n\nachieving that interest is the most demanding test known to constitutional law.” Id.\n\nat 534, 117 S. Ct. at 2171.\n\n      Defendants contend that, like RFRA, the disparate impact provisions of Title\n\nVII are so out of line with the constitutional harm to be remedied that they cannot\n\nbe sustained under Congress’ Fourteenth Amendment enforcement power. They\n\npoint out that demonstrating disparate impact does not require a plaintiff to show\n\nthat the employer was motivated by a discriminatory purpose. In order to prove an\n\nequal protection violation, however, a plaintiff must demonstrate discriminatory\n\nintent, “that the decisionmaker . . . selected or reaffirmed a particular course of\n\naction at least in part ‘because of,’ not merely ‘in spite of,’ its adverse effects upon\n\nan identifiable group.” Feeney, 422 U.S. at 279, 99 S. Ct. at 2296. It is true that\n\nthe disparate impact analysis does not require plaintiffs to demonstrate a subjective\n\ndiscriminatory motive on the part of the decisionmaker; but neither this court, nor\n\nthe Supreme Court, has ever held that the issue of intent is wholly irrelevant to a\n\nclaim of disparate impact. “The distinguishing features of the factual issues that\n\ntypically dominate in disparate impact cases do not imply that the ultimate legal\n\n\n                                           33\n\fissue is different than in cases where disparate treatment analysis is used.”\n\nWatson, 487 U.S. at 987, 108 S. Ct. at 2785. This is because the disparate impact\n\nanalysis was designed as a “prophylactic” measure, Teal, 457 U.S. at 449, 102 S.\n\nCt. at 2531; Albemarle Paper, 422 U.S. at 417, 95 S. Ct. at 2371, to get at\n\n“[d]iscrimination [that] could actually exist under the guise of compliance with\n\n[Title VII].” Griggs, 401 U.S. at 435, 91 S. Ct. at 855-56 (quoting 110 Cong. Rec.\n\n13504 (remarks of Sen. Case) ) (internal quotations omitted); see also Watson, 487\n\nU.S. at 990, 108 S. Ct. at 2786-87 (finding that “even if one assumed that\n\n[discrimination through subjective employment criteria] can be adequately policed\n\nthrough disparate treatment analysis, the problem of subconscious stereotypes and\n\nprejudices would remain”); Charles R. Lawrence III, “The Id, the Ego, and Equal\n\nProtection: Reckoning With Unconscious Racism,” 39 Stan. L. Rev. 317 (1987).\n\n      In a Title VII race discrimination disparate impact case, the plaintiff carries\n\nthe prima facie burden of demonstrating to a court that a particular employment\n\npractice disproportionately burdens one racial group over another. As we\n\ndescribed in our analysis in part III, supra, making out the prima facie case is not\n\nalways such an easy thing to do. The plaintiff is forced to tailor her qualified\n\napplicant pool to represent only those applicants or potential applicants who are\n\notherwise-qualified (but for the challenged employer practice) for the job or job\n\n\n                                          34\n\fbenefit at issue. We emphasize the importance of this tailoring function because if\n\nthe qualified applicant pool is adequately narrowed by the interaction between the\n\nplaintiff and defendant during the first stage of the analysis, then a prima facie\n\nfinding of disparate impact by the court means that the plaintiff has demonstrated\n\nthat the challenged practice (and not something else) actually causes the\n\ndiscriminatory impact at issue. Though the plaintiff is never explicitly required to\n\ndemonstrate discriminatory motive, a genuine finding of disparate impact can be\n\nhighly probative of the employer’s motive since a racial “imbalance is often a\n\ntelltale sign of purposeful discrimination.” Teamsters, 431 U.S. at 339-40 n.20, 97\n\nS. Ct. at 1856-57 n.20; see also Davis, 426 U.S. at 253, 96 S. Ct. at 2054 (Stevens,\n\nJ., concurring) (“Frequently the most probative evidence of intent will be objective\n\nevidence of what actually happened rather than evidence describing the subjective\n\nstate of mind of the actor. For normally the actor is presumed to have intended the\n\nnatural consequences of his deeds.”). If, after a prima facie demonstration of\n\ndiscriminatory impact, the employer cannot demonstrate that the challenged\n\npractice is a job related business necessity, what explanation can there be for the\n\nemployer’s continued use of the discriminatory practice other than that some\n\ninvidious purpose is probably at work? In our race hypothetical in part III, supra,\n\nif the court found that the employer could not demonstrate that its high school\n\n\n                                          35\n\fdiploma requirement was a job related business necessity, why would the employer\n\ncontinue to require a high school education when it is aware of the practice’s\n\ndiscriminatory impact on African-Americans?18 In the context of the plaintiff’s\n\nfurther option of demonstrating an alternative employment practice that has a less\n\ndiscriminatory impact, the Supreme Court has been even more unambiguous in\n\ncharacterizing an employer’s refusal to adopt the alternative practice as “evidence\n\nthat the employer was using its tests merely as a ‘pretext’ for discrimination.”\n\nAlbemarle Paper, 422 U.S. at 425, 95 S. Ct. at 2375; see also Teal, 457 U.S. at 447,\n\n102 S. Ct. at 2530 (even where employer demonstrates that a challenged practice is\n\na job related business necessity, “the plaintiff may prevail, if he shows that the\n\nemployer was using the practice as a mere pretext for discrimination”).\n\n       All of this is not to say that the plaintiff is ever required to prove\n\ndiscriminatory intent in a disparate impact case; it is clear that what plaintiffs must\n\ndemonstrate is a discriminatory result, coupled with a finding that the employer has\n\n\n\n       18\n          In our hypothetical, the employer’s continuing use of the high school education\nrequirement would seem particularly probative of discriminatory intent, since the wages for an\nemployee who did not have a high school degree would, necessarily, be lower; such an employee\nwould possess less human capital with which to bargain. If the employer could not demonstrate\nthat the high school diploma requirement was a job related business necessity, then retention of\nthe requirement would be inefficient since this non-necessary employee attribute will cost more\nin terms of higher wages that the employer will have to pay to employees holding a high school\ndiploma. The employer in this scenario, therefore, would appear to be indulging his “taste” for\ndiscrimination. See Gary S. Becker, The Economics of Discrimination 153-54 (2d ed. 1971).\n\n                                              36\n\fno explanation as to why the challenged practice should be sustained as a job\n\nrelated business necessity. What our analysis does show, however, is that the\n\ndisparate impact provisions of Title VII can reasonably be characterized as\n\n“preventive rules” that evidence a “congruence between the means used and the\n\nends to be achieved.” Id. at 530, 117 S. Ct. at 2169. Congress has not sought to\n\nalter the “substance of the Fourteenth Amendment’s restrictions on the States” with\n\nthe disparate impact provisions of Title VII. City of Boerne, 521 U.S. at 519, 117\n\nS. Ct. at 2164. Our analysis of the mechanics of a disparate impact claim has led\n\nus unavoidably to the conclusion that although the form of the disparate impact\n\ninquiry differs from that used in a case challenging state action directly under the\n\nFourteenth Amendment, the core injury targeted by both methods of analysis\n\nremains the same: intentional discrimination.\n\n      Further, as to the “means” used, we note that the Supreme Court found in\n\nBoerne that RFRA’s substantial burden test was “not even a discriminatory effects\n\nor disparate impact test.” Id. at 535, 117 S. Ct. at 2171. And if a complainant\n\ncould demonstrate a substantial burden on a religious practice, then the government\n\nwas automatically saddled with the responsibility of demonstrating that the\n\nchallenged government act was justified by a compelling interest, and that it was\n\nthe least restrictive means of furthering that interest. Under the disparate impact\n\n\n                                          37\n\fprovisions of Title VII, by contrast, plaintiffs are required to demonstrate that a\n\nparticular employment practice has an actual discriminatory impact; and even then,\n\nemployers are not required to show that they have some “compelling interest” in\n\ncontinuing to use the practice, or that they have adopted the “least restrictive\n\nmeans” of furthering their “compelling interest.” They must merely “demonstrate\n\nthat the challenged practice is job related for the position in question and consistent\n\nwith business necessity.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)(1)(A)(i). However difficult this\n\nmay have proven to be in some cases, demonstrating business necessity is certainly\n\non an entirely different evidentiary planet than demonstrating a compelling\n\ninterest; it is a rare day, indeed, that courts find government actors to have\n\nadequately demonstrated a compelling interest, and a rarer one still that courts find\n\nno less restrictive alternatives to be available.\n\n      Finally, we need not dredge up this nation’s sad history of racial domination\n\nand subordination to take notice of the fact that the “injury” targeted by Title VII,\n\nintentional discrimination against racial minorities, has since our inception\n\nconstituted one of the most tormenting and vexing issues facing this country.\n\nThere can be little doubt that the core motivation animating the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment’s Equal Protection Clause was a concern for protecting the rights of\n\nracial minorities subject to historical discrimination, see Alexander Bickel, “The\n\n\n                                           38\n\fOriginal Understanding and the Segregation Decision,” 69 Harv. L. Rev. 1 (1955),\n\nand that Congress is acting most comfortably under the Amendment when it is\n\nacting to cure racial prejudice. See Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U.S. (10 Otto)\n\n303, 306-07, 25 L. Ed. 664 (1880). The House Report accompanying the 1972\n\namendments to Title VII, extending coverage to state and local governments,\n\ndocumented the troubling persistence of race discrimination in public employment:\n\n      In a report released in 1969, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights\n      examined equal employment opportunity in public employment in\n      seven urban areas located throughout the country – North as well as\n      South. The report’s findings indicate that widespread discrimination\n      against minorities exists in State and local government employment,\n      and that the existence of this discrimination is perpetuated by the\n      presence of both institutional and overt discriminatory practices. The\n      report cites widespread perpetuation of past discriminatory practices\n      through de facto segregated job ladders, invalid selection techniques,\n      and stereotyped misconceptions by supervisors regarding minority\n      group capabilities. The study also indicates that employment\n      discrimination in State and local governments is more pervasive than\n      in the private sector. The report found that in six of the seven areas\n      studied, Negroes constitute over 70 percent of the common laborers,\n      but that most white-collar jobs were found to be largely inaccessible\n      to minority persons. For example, in Atlanta and Baton Rouge, there\n      were no blacks in city managerial positions.\n             In another report issued by the U.S. Commission on Civil\n      Rights in 1970, Mexican Americans and the Administration of Justice\n      in the Southwest, the Commission found, on the basis of a 1968\n      survey, that in the law enforcement agencies and district attorneys’\n      offices in the five Southwestern States, Mexican Americans were\n      generally underrepresented in proportion to their demographic\n      distribution. The statistics in this report show that in the Southwestern\n      States Mexican Americans, who constitute approximately 12 percent\n      of the population, account for only 5.2 percent of police officers and\n\n                                         39\n\f      6.11 percent of civilian employers [sic] with law enforcement\n      agencies.\n             The problem of employment discrimination is particularly acute\n      and has the most deleterious effect in these governmental activities\n      which are most visible to the minority communities (notably\n      education, law enforcement, and the administration of justice) with the\n      result that the credibility of the government’s claim to represent all the\n      people equally is negated.\n\nH.R. Rep. No. 92-238 (1972), reprinted in 1972 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2137, 2152-53. The\n\nmeans used by Congress in the disparate impact provisions of Title VII, so closely\n\naligned to the constitutional equal protection analysis, are neither incongruent with\n\nthe purpose of preventing intentional discrimination in public employment, nor\n\ndisproportionate to the injury to be avoided.\n\n\n\n                                         V.\n\n      For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that in enacting the disparate impact\n\nprovisions of Title VII, Congress has unequivocally expressed its intent to abrogate\n\nthe states’ Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity, and that Congress has acted\n\npursuant to a valid exercise of its Fourteenth Amendment enforcement power. We,\n\ntherefore, AFFIRM the district court’s denial of defendants’ Rule 12(b)(1) motion\n\nto dismiss all disparate impact claims against the State of Alabama, based on the\n\nstate’s claim to sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment.\n\n      AFFIRMED.\n\n                                         40\n\f41\n\f",

We answer in the affirmative.\n\n\n\n                                                 I.\n\n       On March 24, 1994, the United States District Court for the Middle District\n\nof Alabama consolidated several race discrimination cases1 brought by African-\n\nAmericans against the State of Alabama, and several of its boards, departments,\n\nand agencies;2 they also sued the Governor of Alabama and other state officials in\n\n\n       1\n         Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 42(a) provides that, “[w]hen actions involving a\ncommon question of law or fact are pending before the court, it may order a joint hearing or trial\nof any or all the matters in issue in the actions; it may order all the actions consolidated; and it\nmay make such orders concerning proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or\ndelay.”\n       2\n        The named defendants in this case include the following boards, departments, and\nagencies of the State of Alabama: the Personnel Board, the Department of Corrections, the\nAlcoholic Beverage Control Board, the Emergency Management Agency, the Department of\nEconomics and Community Affairs, the Industrial Development Training Agency, the Bureau of\nTourism and Travel, the Department of Agriculture and Industries, the Department of Education,\nthe Department of Revenue, the Department of Public Health, the Development Office, the\nRetirement System of Alabama, Voters Registration, the Department of Human Resources, the\nDepartment of Mental Health, the Medicaid Agency, the Board of Public Accounting, the\n\n                                                 2\n\fboth their individual and official capacities.3 Some of the cases were class actions\n\nin which plaintiffs sued on behalf of themselves and all other black persons who\n\nare employed, have been employed, or who may in the future be employed by the\n\ndefendants.4 Plaintiffs claimed, inter alia, discrimination against African-\n\nAmericans\n\n       in layoffs, recalls from layoffs, terminations, discipline, hiring,\n       rehiring, evaluations, compensation, transfers, job duty assignments,\n       recruitment, screening, selection procedures, denial of promotions,\n       demotions, rollbacks, sick leave, subjective decision-making\n       practices, and other terms and conditions of employment which have\n       resulted in disparate impact and treatment of the plaintiff-intervenors\n       and the plaintiff class.\n\nThey sought declaratory, injunctive, and compensatory relief under Title VII of the\n\nCivil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000(e), et seq., and 42 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 1981 and 1983 (1994).\n\n\n\n\nCommission on Physical Fitness, the Labor Board, the State Docks Department, and the\nDepartment of Transportation.\n       3\n         In this case, we are concerned only with the disparate impact provisions of Title VII.\nWe are aware that Title VII “provides relief only against ‘employers’ as defined under the\nstatute.” Llampallas v.

In both disparate treatment and\npattern or practice cases, the plaintiffs are ultimately required to demonstrate discriminatory\nintent on the part of the employer.\n\n                                               6\n\fId. at 425-26, 91 S. Ct. at 851.9 Prior to the date of Title VII’s enactment, the\n\ndefendant company in Griggs had openly discriminated on the basis of race in the\n\nhiring and assignment of its employees. When the company abandoned its policy\n\nof de jure discrimination, it made the completion of high school a prerequisite for\n\nemployees who wanted to transfer from the company’s labor department (the only\n\ndepartment previously employing African-Americans) to any other department in\n\nthe company (all of which formerly hired only whites). The Court found that the\n\nhigh school requirement, as well as other standardized tests used by the defendant,\n\nhad a disparate impact on African-Americans because “[i]n North Carolina . . .,\n\nwhile 34% of white males had completed high school, only 12 % of Negro males\n\nhad done so.” Id. at 430 n.6, 91 S. Ct. at 853 n.6. Similarly, “with respect to\n\nstandardized tests, the EEOC in one case found that use of a battery of tests,\n\n\n       9\n        The particular provisions of Title VII interpreted by the Supreme Court in Griggs were\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(2) and (h):\n       (a) It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer–\n       ....\n                (2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees in any way which would\n       deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or\n       otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee, because of such individual’s\n       race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\n       ....\n       (h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, it shall not be an unlawful\n       employment practice for an employer . . . to give and to act upon the results of\n       any professionally developed ability test provided that such test, its administration\n       or action upon the results is not designed, intended or used to discriminate\n       because of race, color, religion, sex or national origin . . . .\nSee Griggs, 401 U.S. at 426 n.1, 91 S Ct. at 851 n.1.\n\n                                               7\n\fincluding the Wonderlic and Bennett tests used by the Company in the instant case,\n\nresulted in 58% of whites passing the tests, as compared with only 6% of the\n\nblacks.” Id. Despite this showing of disparate impact, the company continued to\n\nutilize the tests even though “neither the high school completion requirement nor\n\nthe general intelligence test [was] shown to bear a demonstrable relationship to\n\nsuccessful performance of the jobs for which it was used.” Id. at 431, 91 S. Ct. at\n\n853. Given these facts, the Supreme Court reversed the Fourth Circuit’s holding\n\nthat “a subjective test of the employer’s intent should govern” Title VII analysis,\n\nid. at 428, 91 S. Ct. at 852, and concluded that “[u]nder the Act, practices,\n\nprocedures, or tests neutral on their face, and even neutral in terms of intent, cannot\n\nbe maintained if they operate to ‘freeze’ the status quo of prior discriminatory\n\nemployment practices,” id. at 430, 91 S. Ct. at 853. From Griggs, therefore,\n\nemerges the now familiar formulation of the core of a disparate impact analysis:\n\n      The Act proscribes not only overt discrimination but also practices\n      that are fair in form, but discriminatory in operation. The touchstone\n      is business necessity. If an employment practice which operates to\n      exclude Negroes cannot be shown to be related to job performance,\n      the practice is prohibited.\n\nId. at 431, 91 S. Ct. at 853.\n\n      Since Griggs, Congress has codified the appropriate burdens of proof in a\n\ndisparate impact case in 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k) (1994), and a settled jurisprudence\n\n\n                                           8\n\fhas arisen to implement the methodology. In the first stage of a disparate impact\n\ncase, the “complaining party [must] demonstrate[] that a respondent uses a\n\nparticular employment practice that causes a disparate impact on the basis of race,\n\ncolor, religion, sex, or national origin.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)(1)(A)(i).10 To\n\n“demonstrate” means to “meet[] the burdens of production and persuasion.” 42\n\nU.S.C. § 2000e(m) (1994). In other words, in order to surmount the first hurdle in\n\na disparate impact race discrimination case, the plaintiff must make out a prima\n\nfacie case “that [a] facially neutral employment practice ha[s] a significantly\n\ndiscriminatory impact.” Connecticut v.

This includes evidence that the plaintiffs have\n\nsimply erred in their calculations or evidence that the plaintiffs have failed\n\nsufficiently to tailor their qualified applicant pool. See id. at 338-39, 97 S. Ct. at\n\n2731 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in result and concurring in part) (“If the defendants\n\nin a Title VII suit believe there to be any reason to discredit plaintiffs’ statistics\n\nthat does not appear on their face, the opportunity to challenge them is available to\n\nthe defendants just as in any other lawsuit. They may endeavor to impeach the\n\nreliability of the statistical evidence, they may offer rebutting evidence, or they\n\nmay disparage in arguments or in briefs the probative weight which the plaintiffs’\n\nevidence should be accorded.”); Peightal, 26 F.3d at 1556-57.\n\n      The key to this first stage is to understand that the concept of a “disparate\n\nimpact” on one racial group over another only makes sense if we tailor the\n\nqualified applicant pool to reflect only those applicants or potential applicants who\n\nare “otherwise qualified,” Beazer, 440 U.S. at 585, 99 S. Ct. at 1366, (that is,\n\nqualified but for their failure to meet the challenged employment requirement) for\n\nthe job or job benefit at issue. If the court fails to define the qualified applicant\n\npool in an appropriately specific manner, then the challenged employment practice\n\n\n                                            14\n\fhas not actually been shown to be “causing” any “disparate impact.” Something\n\nelse, unrelated to the employer’s practices and procedures, may be holding back a\n\nparticular racial group. An example might help clarify our rationale. Consider a\n\ncommunity composed of equal numbers of African-Americans and whites. There\n\nare, let us say, 1,000 blacks and 1,000 whites. Now, imagine that within this\n\ncommunity, an employer announces that it is going to hire eighty new employees,\n\nall for identical labor positions, and that it will only consider applicants who have a\n\nhigh school diploma. The correlation between educational attainment and race in\n\nthe community breaks down as follows: 30% of the African-American segment has\n\na high school diploma (70% does not), whereas 50% of the white segment has a\n\nhigh school diploma (50% does not). Now assume that 100 blacks and 100 whites\n\napply for the eighty jobs. Their educational attainment corresponds in all respects\n\nto that of the community at large; that is, thirty of the African-Americans have a\n\nhigh school education, as do fifty of the whites. Citing its high school degree\n\nrequirement, the employer hires the thirty blacks and the fifty whites with high\n\nschool degrees.\n\n      When the seventy rejected black applicants file suit against the employer,\n\nclaiming that the high school degree requirement has a disparate impact on\n\nAfrican-Americans in violation of Title VII, the employer responds by introducing\n\n\n                                          15\n\fevidence that, due to unexplained population trends, 40% of the black segment of\n\nthe community is under the age of 18, but all 1000 whites are age 18 or over.\n\nFurther, this population figure corresponds positively with the pool of applicants\n\nfor the jobs at issue; forty of the 100 black applicants were under 18 years of age,\n\nbut all of the whites were 18 or over. Therefore, even if the employer discontinued\n\nits high school diploma requirement, the forty black applicants under age 18 would\n\nnot have been hired because the relevant labor laws preclude hiring underage\n\npersons.\n\n      If the African-American plaintiffs continue to assert their claim of disparate\n\nimpact, they would in one sense be correct. The high school education\n\nrequirement certainly does have a disparate impact on blacks because more than\n\n1.65 times as many whites as blacks have high school diplomas; therefore, 1.65\n\ntimes as many whites will be hired, in a community composed of equal numbers of\n\nblacks and whites. A finding of disparate impact is only plausible in this situation,\n\nhowever, if one neglects to consider the qualified applicant pool. The unstated\n\npremise to the conclusion that disparate impact has reared its ugly head in this\n\nhypothetical is that because the community as a whole is composed of equal\n\nnumbers of blacks and whites, the eighty employment positions should also be\n\nfilled with equal numbers of blacks and whites; but this is not the case. If the\n\n\n                                          16\n\femployer’s population evidence is credible, then the qualified applicant pool\n\nincludes only 60% of the blacks (because 40% are underage), but all of the whites.\n\nWhat we would expect, given these facts, is that the employment outcome absent\n\nthe high school requirement would mimic that produced when a high school\n\ndiploma is required – over 1.65 times as many whites as blacks will be hired\n\nbecause over 1.65 times as many are of working age. Under these facts, it is clear\n\nthat the plaintiffs have not demonstrated that the high school diploma requirement\n\nhas a disparate impact in the first instance.\n\n       Once the plaintiffs have met their burden of demonstrating that a challenged\n\nemployment practice causes a disparate impact, the burden shifts to the defendant\n\nemployer “to demonstrate that the challenged practice is job related for the position\n\nin question and consistent with business necessity.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-\n\n2(k)(1)(A)(i).12 Alternatively, the complaining party can demonstrate “that other\n\ntests or selection devices, without a similarly undesirable racial effect, would also\n\nserve the employer’s legitimate interest in ‘efficient and trustworthy\n\n\n\n       12\n          The 1991 amendments to Title VII, inter alia, reversed the Supreme Court’s\ninterpretation in Wards Cove, 490 U.S. at 659, 109 S. Ct. at 2126, where the Court held that\ndefendants only need to meet the burden of production, but not persuasion, during the second\nstage of a disparate impact case. Section 2000e-2(k)(1)(A)(i) requires an employer to\n“demonstrate” that the challenged practice is a job related business necessity, and as noted,\nsupra, to “demonstrate” means to “meet[] the burdens of production and persuasion.” 42 U.S.C.\n§ 2000e(m).\n\n                                             17\n\fworkmanship.’ ” Albermarle Paper Co. v.

Though this second stage\n\nshifts the burden of demonstration to the defendant, the ultimate focus of the\n\ninquiry remains on the question of who should be included in the qualified\n\napplicant pool. If the employer can demonstrate that the practice at issue is a job\n\nrelated business necessity, then the employer has shown that there is no ultimate\n\ndisparate impact; this is because the qualified applicant pool would only include\n\nthose persons who could meet the employer’s challenged criteria. For instance, in\n\nthe above hypothetical, if we relax the assumptions with regard to age and race in\n\nthe community, and posit that equal numbers of blacks and whites (say 80% of\n\neach) are of working age, then the African-American plaintiffs might be successful\n\nin carrying their prima facie burden of demonstrating that the high school diploma\n\nrequirement has a disparate impact on blacks (because only 30% of blacks, as\n\nopposed to 50% of whites, have a high school education). If the employer is\n\nsuccessful in demonstrating that a high school education is a job related business\n\nnecessity for the job at issue, then what the employer has done, in effect, is to\n\ndemonstrate that the requirement does not actually cause a disparate impact. A\n\nfinding of business necessity is equivalent to a finding that the qualified applicant\n\n\n                                          18\n\fpool only includes those persons who have attained a high school degree.\n\nLikewise, if the employer failed to demonstrate business necessity, then the\n\nplaintiffs would have succeeded in proving disparate impact in the ultimate sense;\n\nthis is because the qualified applicant pool would include those persons of working\n\nage who did not posses the required education.\n\n       If the court ultimately finds that the employer has violated the disparate\n\nimpact provisions of Title VII, and is therefore engaged in an unlawful\n\nemployment practice, the court may order a wide range of equitable relief under 42\n\nU.S.C. § 2000e-5(g)(1) (1994).13 Principally, the court should enjoin the employer\n\n\n\n       13\n           42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(g)(1) provides:\n        If the court finds that the respondent has intentionally engaged in or is\n        intentionally engaging in an unlawful employment practice charged in the\n        complaint, the court may enjoin the respondent from engaging in such unlawful\n        employment practice, and order such affirmative action as may be appropriate,\n        which may include, but is not limited to, reinstatement or hiring of employees,\n        with or without back pay (payable by the employer, employment agency, or labor\n        organization, as the case may be, responsible for the unlawful employment\n        practice), or any other equitable relief as the court deems appropriate.

Interim earnings or amounts earnable with\n        reasonable diligence by the person or persons discriminated against shall operate\n        to reduce the back pay otherwise allowable.\n        The statutory requirement that the court find that the employer has “intentionally\nengaged” in the unlawful employment practice does not mean that this remedial provision is only\napplicable in disparate treatment or pattern or practice cases. “[Section 2000e-5(g)] requires\nonly that the defendant meant to do what he did, that is, his employment practice was not\naccidental.” Local 189, United Papermakers and Paperworkers, AFL-CIO, CLC v.

See 517 U.S. at 65-66, 116 S. Ct. at 1128. The Fourteenth\n\nAmendment states, in relevant part:\n\n      Section 1. . . . No State shall make or enforce any law which shall\n      abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States;\n      nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property,\n      without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its\n      jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\n      ....\n      Section 5. The Congress shall have the power to enforce, by\n      appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.\n\nIn Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, the Supreme Court concluded that,\n\n      [i]n the 1972 Amendments to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of\n      1964, Congress, acting under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment,\n      authorized federal courts to award money damages in favor of a\n      private individual against a state government found to have subjected\n\n\n\n      political subdivisions.’\n              The express exclusion of ‘a State or political subdivision thereof’ provided\n      in § 701(b) of the former was stricken by § 2(2) of the latter, 86 Stat. 103, 42\n      U.S.C. § 2000e(b) (1970 ed., Supp. IV). Section 2(5) of the 1972 Amendments,\n      86 Stat. 103, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(f) (1970 ed., Supp. IV), amended § 701(f) of the\n      1964 Act, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(f), to include wihin the definition of ‘employee’\n      those individuals ‘subject to the civil service laws of a State government,\n      governmental agency or political subdivision.’\n              The 1972 Amendments retained the right of an individual aggrieved by an\n      employer’s unlawful employment practice to sue on his or her own behalf, upon\n      satisfaction of the statutory procedural prerequisites, and made clear that that right\n      was being extended to persons aggrieved by public employers.

In light of the fact that Seminole Tribe cited Fitzpatrick\n\napprovingly, we do not even think tenable the suggestion that the Supreme Court\n\nhas “rejected” the reasoning in Fitzpatrick;15 even if we did think defendants’\n\ncontention had some merit, however, it is for the Supreme Court, and not us, to\n\nreconsider its own precedent.\n\n       Defendants next make the somewhat novel argument that since Congress did\n\nnot codify the burdens of proof in disparate impact cases until 1991, see Pub. L.\n\nNo. 102-166, § 105, 105 Stat. 1071, 1074 (codified at 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)), it\n\ncould not have meant to subject states to disparate impact suits (as opposed to\n\ndisparate treatment, or pattern or practice suits) when it amended Title VII to cover\n\nstate and local governments in 1972. This argument misunderstands the evolution\n\nof the disparate impact theory. Disparate impact analysis did not spring forth anew\n\n\n       15\n         See Seminole Tribe, 517 U.S. at 59, 116 S. Ct. at 1125 (internal citations omitted),\nwhere the Supreme Court stated:\n       In Fitzpatrick, we recognized that the Fourteenth Amendment, by expanding\n       federal power at the expense of state autonomy, had fundamentally altered the\n       balance of state and federal power struck by the Constitution. We noted that § 1\n       of the Fourteenth Amendment contained prohibitions expressly directed at the\n       States and that § 5 of the Amendment expressly provided that “The Congress\n       shall have the power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this\n       article.’ We held that through the Fourteenth Amendment, federal power\n       extended to intrude upon the province of the Eleventh Amendment and therefore\n       that § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment allowed Congress to abrogate the\n       immunity from suit guaranteed by that Amendment.\n\n                                               24\n\fin 1991; as discussed, supra, in 1971 the Supreme Court interpreted the original\n\nCivil Rights Act of 1964, particularly sections 2000e-2(a)(2) and (h), see, supra,\n\nn.9, to prohibit “practices that are fair in form, but discriminatory in operation.”\n\nGriggs, 401 U.S. at 431, 91 S. Ct. at 853. The Supreme Court has explicitly found\n\nthat “Congress recognized and endorsed the disparate-impact analysis employed by\n\nthe Court in Griggs,” Teal, 457 U.S. at 447 n.8, 102 S. Ct. at 2531 n.8, and that\n\n“Congress indicated [in the 1972 amendments] the intent that the same Title VII\n\nprinciples be applied to governmental and private employers alike.” Dothard, 433\n\nU.S. at 331 n.14, 97 S. Ct. at 2728 n.14. There is no indication that, by enacting\n\nthe 1991 amendments, Congress sought to do anything more than reaffirm and\n\nstrengthen the disparate impact analysis, see supra, n.12 and part II. Therefore,\n\ndefendants’ argument, while interesting, is meritless because it is clear that\n\nCongress has, indeed, sought to subject states to disparate impact lability under\n\nTitle VII.\n\n\n\n                                          B.\n\n      The state next contends that even if Congress has expressed its intent to\n\nabrogate the states’ Eleventh Amendment immunity, it has not acted “pursuant to a\n\nvalid exercise of power.” Seminole Tribe, 517 U.S. at 55, 116 S.

This argument is wholly unconvincing. The question in\n\nScott was essentially the same as the question of whether Congress has the power\n\nto abrogate a state’s sovereign immunity under Seminole Tribe – that is, has\n\nCongress acted within the confines of its Section 5 power “to enforce, by\n\nappropriate legislation, the provisions” of the Fourteenth Amendment. In Scott,\n\nthe court answered this question in the affirmative.

Factors a court may consider in\n\n       17\n           Davis was the first case in which the Supreme Court expressly stated, “We have never\nheld that the constitutional standard for adjudicating claims of invidious racial discrimination is\nidentical to the standards applicable under Title VII, and we decline to do so today.” Davis, 426\nU.S. at 239, 96 S. Ct. at 2047. The plaintiffs in Davis, black applicants for employment as police\nofficers by the District of Columbia, brought suit under the equal protection component of the\nDue Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment; they claimed that a written personnel test\nadministered by the District of Columbia police department had a racially disparate impact on\nAfrican-Americans. Had the Supreme Court held that plaintiffs using constitutional equal\nprotection analysis to attack allegedly discriminatory state action need not demonstrate a\ndiscriminatory purpose, but only a disparate impact, then every state action having a disparate\nimpact on a particular racial group would have become subject to the Court’s strict scrutiny, “the\nmost demanding test known to constitutional law.” City of Boerne, 521 U.S. at 534, 117 S. Ct.\nat 2171.\n\n                                                29\n\fdetermining whether state action was motivated by discriminatory animus include:\n\n(1) the disparate impact of the official action; (2) the historical background of the\n\ndecision; (3) the specific sequence of events leading up to the challenged decision;\n\nand (4) the legislative or administrative history. See id. at 266-68, 97 S. Ct. at 564-\n\n65.\n\n      Under City of Boerne, it is clear that when Congress is acting pursuant to its\n\nSection 5 enforcement authority, it does not have the power to alter the “substance\n\nof the Fourteenth Amendment’s restrictions on the States.” City of Boerne, 521\n\nU.S. at 519, 117 S. Ct. at 2164. In the equal protection context, this means that the\n\ncore congressional motivation must remain consistent with the notion that what the\n\nConstitution prohibits is intentional discrimination on the part of state actors (and\n\nnot state action that leads to a merely discriminatory result).

In\n\nSmith, the Court concluded that consistent with the Free Exercise Clause, a state\n\nmay apply neutral, generally applicable laws to religious practices even when those\n\nlaws are not supported by a compelling government interest. With RFRA,\n\nCongress sought to supplant the Court’s interpretation with one more favorable to\n\n\n                                          30\n\freligious interests. The Act attempted to “overrule” Smith by mandating that\n\nneutral laws that substantially burden religious exercise must be justified under the\n\ncompelling government interest test. See City of Boerne, 521 U.S. at 512-15, 117\n\nS. Ct. at 2160-62.\n\n      The Court concluded that Congress had acted beyond the scope of its\n\nFourteenth Amendment enforcement power:\n\n      Congress’ power under § 5 . . . extends only to enforcing the\n      provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court has described\n      this power as ‘remedial.’ The design of the Amendment and the text\n      of § 5 are inconsistent with the suggestion that Congress has the\n      power to decree the substance of the Fourteenth Amendment’s\n      restrictions on the States. Legislation which alters the meaning of the\n      Free Exercise Clause cannot be said to be enforcing the Clause.\n      Congress does not enforce a constitutional right by changing what the\n      right is. It has been given the power ‘to enforce,’ not the power to\n      determine what constitutes a constitutional violation. Were it not so,\n      what Congress would be enforcing would no longer be, in any\n      meaningful sense, the ‘provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment.’\n\nCity of Boerne, 521 U.S. at 519, 117 S. Ct. at 2164 (internal citations omitted).\n\nThe Court emphasized that “[l]egislation which deters or remedies constitutional\n\nviolations can fall within the sweep of Congress’ enforcement power even if in the\n\nprocess it prohibits conduct which is not itself unconstitutional,” id. at 518, 117 S.\n\nCt. at 2163, but “[t]here must be a congruence and proportionality between the\n\ninjury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end. Lacking\n\n\n\n                                          31\n\fsuch a connection, legislation may become substantive in operation and effect,” id.\n\nat 520, 117 S. Ct. at 2164.\n\n      With RFRA, Congress overstepped its bounds with regard to both the\n\n“injury” it sought to prevent, and the “means” it adopted to that end. As for the\n\n“injury” to be prevented, the legislature failed to demonstrate any recent history of\n\nan injury to the free exercise rights of religious practitioners that rose to the level\n\nof a constitutional violation. See id. at 530, 117 S. Ct. at 2169 (“RFRA’s\n\nlegislative record lacks examples of modern instances of generally applicable laws\n\npassed because of religious bigotry. The history of persecution in this country\n\ndetailed in the hearings mentions no episodes occurring in the past 40 years.”).\n\nWith regard to the “means” adopted, Congress prohibited government interference\n\nwith religious exercise in such a sweeping and drastic manner that the Act simply\n\n“[could] not be considered remedial, preventive legislation, if those terms are to\n\nhave any meaning.” Id. at 532, 117 S. Ct. at 2170. As to what a plaintiff class of\n\nreligious observers would have to prove in a case brought under the Act, “RFRA’s\n\nsubstantial burden test . . . [was] not even a discriminatory effects or disparate\n\nimpact test.” Id. at 535, 117 S. Ct. at 2171. Plaintiffs might be able to bring suit\n\n“[w]hen the exercise of religion ha[d] been burdened in an incidental way by a law\n\nof general application.” Id. Once substantial burden was shown, “the State must\n\n\n                                           32\n\fdemonstrate a compelling governmental interest and show that the law is the least\n\nrestrictive means of furthering its interest. . . . Requiring a State to demonstrate a\n\ncompelling interest and show that it has adopted the least restrictive means of\n\nachieving that interest is the most demanding test known to constitutional law.” Id.\n\nat 534, 117 S. Ct. at 2171.\n\n      Defendants contend that, like RFRA, the disparate impact provisions of Title\n\nVII are so out of line with the constitutional harm to be remedied that they cannot\n\nbe sustained under Congress’ Fourteenth Amendment enforcement power. They\n\npoint out that demonstrating disparate impact does not require a plaintiff to show\n\nthat the employer was motivated by a discriminatory purpose. In order to prove an\n\nequal protection violation, however, a plaintiff must demonstrate discriminatory\n\nintent, “that the decisionmaker . . . selected or reaffirmed a particular course of\n\naction at least in part ‘because of,’ not merely ‘in spite of,’ its adverse effects upon\n\nan identifiable group.” Feeney, 422 U.S. at 279, 99 S. Ct. at 2296. It is true that\n\nthe disparate impact analysis does not require plaintiffs to demonstrate a subjective\n\ndiscriminatory motive on the part of the decisionmaker; but neither this court, nor\n\nthe Supreme Court, has ever held that the issue of intent is wholly irrelevant to a\n\nclaim of disparate impact. “The distinguishing features of the factual issues that\n\ntypically dominate in disparate impact cases do not imply that the ultimate legal\n\n\n                                           33\n\fissue is different than in cases where disparate treatment analysis is used.”\n\nWatson, 487 U.S. at 987, 108 S. Ct. at 2785. This is because the disparate impact\n\nanalysis was designed as a “prophylactic” measure, Teal, 457 U.S. at 449, 102 S.\n\nCt. at 2531; Albemarle Paper, 422 U.S. at 417, 95 S. Ct. at 2371, to get at\n\n“[d]iscrimination [that] could actually exist under the guise of compliance with\n\n[Title VII].” Griggs, 401 U.S. at 435, 91 S. Ct. at 855-56 (quoting 110 Cong. Rec.\n\n13504 (remarks of Sen. Case) ) (internal quotations omitted); see also Watson, 487\n\nU.S. at 990, 108 S. Ct. at 2786-87 (finding that “even if one assumed that\n\n[discrimination through subjective employment criteria] can be adequately policed\n\nthrough disparate treatment analysis, the problem of subconscious stereotypes and\n\nprejudices would remain”); Charles R. Lawrence III, “The Id, the Ego, and Equal\n\nProtection: Reckoning With Unconscious Racism,” 39 Stan. L. Rev. 317 (1987).\n\n      In a Title VII race discrimination disparate impact case, the plaintiff carries\n\nthe prima facie burden of demonstrating to a court that a particular employment\n\npractice disproportionately burdens one racial group over another. As we\n\ndescribed in our analysis in part III, supra, making out the prima facie case is not\n\nalways such an easy thing to do. The plaintiff is forced to tailor her qualified\n\napplicant pool to represent only those applicants or potential applicants who are\n\notherwise-qualified (but for the challenged employer practice) for the job or job\n\n\n                                          34\n\fbenefit at issue. We emphasize the importance of this tailoring function because if\n\nthe qualified applicant pool is adequately narrowed by the interaction between the\n\nplaintiff and defendant during the first stage of the analysis, then a prima facie\n\nfinding of disparate impact by the court means that the plaintiff has demonstrated\n\nthat the challenged practice (and not something else) actually causes the\n\ndiscriminatory impact at issue. Though the plaintiff is never explicitly required to\n\ndemonstrate discriminatory motive, a genuine finding of disparate impact can be\n\nhighly probative of the employer’s motive since a racial “imbalance is often a\n\ntelltale sign of purposeful discrimination.” Teamsters, 431 U.S. at 339-40 n.20, 97\n\nS. Ct. at 1856-57 n.20; see also Davis, 426 U.S. at 253, 96 S. Ct. at 2054 (Stevens,\n\nJ., concurring) (“Frequently the most probative evidence of intent will be objective\n\nevidence of what actually happened rather than evidence describing the subjective\n\nstate of mind of the actor. For normally the actor is presumed to have intended the\n\nnatural consequences of his deeds.”). If, after a prima facie demonstration of\n\ndiscriminatory impact, the employer cannot demonstrate that the challenged\n\npractice is a job related business necessity, what explanation can there be for the\n\nemployer’s continued use of the discriminatory practice other than that some\n\ninvidious purpose is probably at work? In our race hypothetical in part III, supra,\n\nif the court found that the employer could not demonstrate that its high school\n\n\n                                          35\n\fdiploma requirement was a job related business necessity, why would the employer\n\ncontinue to require a high school education when it is aware of the practice’s\n\ndiscriminatory impact on African-Americans?18 In the context of the plaintiff’s\n\nfurther option of demonstrating an alternative employment practice that has a less\n\ndiscriminatory impact, the Supreme Court has been even more unambiguous in\n\ncharacterizing an employer’s refusal to adopt the alternative practice as “evidence\n\nthat the employer was using its tests merely as a ‘pretext’ for discrimination.”\n\nAlbemarle Paper, 422 U.S. at 425, 95 S. Ct. at 2375; see also Teal, 457 U.S. at 447,\n\n102 S. Ct. at 2530 (even where employer demonstrates that a challenged practice is\n\na job related business necessity, “the plaintiff may prevail, if he shows that the\n\nemployer was using the practice as a mere pretext for discrimination”).\n\n       All of this is not to say that the plaintiff is ever required to prove\n\ndiscriminatory intent in a disparate impact case; it is clear that what plaintiffs must\n\ndemonstrate is a discriminatory result, coupled with a finding that the employer has\n\n\n\n       18\n          In our hypothetical, the employer’s continuing use of the high school education\nrequirement would seem particularly probative of discriminatory intent, since the wages for an\nemployee who did not have a high school degree would, necessarily, be lower; such an employee\nwould possess less human capital with which to bargain. If the employer could not demonstrate\nthat the high school diploma requirement was a job related business necessity, then retention of\nthe requirement would be inefficient since this non-necessary employee attribute will cost more\nin terms of higher wages that the employer will have to pay to employees holding a high school\ndiploma. The employer in this scenario, therefore, would appear to be indulging his “taste” for\ndiscrimination. See Gary S. Becker, The Economics of Discrimination 153-54 (2d ed. 1971).\n\n                                              36\n\fno explanation as to why the challenged practice should be sustained as a job\n\nrelated business necessity. What our analysis does show, however, is that the\n\ndisparate impact provisions of Title VII can reasonably be characterized as\n\n“preventive rules” that evidence a “congruence between the means used and the\n\nends to be achieved.” Id. at 530, 117 S. Ct. at 2169. Congress has not sought to\n\nalter the “substance of the Fourteenth Amendment’s restrictions on the States” with\n\nthe disparate impact provisions of Title VII. City of Boerne, 521 U.S. at 519, 117\n\nS. Ct. at 2164. Our analysis of the mechanics of a disparate impact claim has led\n\nus unavoidably to the conclusion that although the form of the disparate impact\n\ninquiry differs from that used in a case challenging state action directly under the\n\nFourteenth Amendment, the core injury targeted by both methods of analysis\n\nremains the same: intentional discrimination.\n\n      Further, as to the “means” used, we note that the Supreme Court found in\n\nBoerne that RFRA’s substantial burden test was “not even a discriminatory effects\n\nor disparate impact test.” Id. at 535, 117 S. Ct. at 2171. And if a complainant\n\ncould demonstrate a substantial burden on a religious practice, then the government\n\nwas automatically saddled with the responsibility of demonstrating that the\n\nchallenged government act was justified by a compelling interest, and that it was\n\nthe least restrictive means of furthering that interest. Under the disparate impact\n\n\n                                          37\n\fprovisions of Title VII, by contrast, plaintiffs are required to demonstrate that a\n\nparticular employment practice has an actual discriminatory impact; and even then,\n\nemployers are not required to show that they have some “compelling interest” in\n\ncontinuing to use the practice, or that they have adopted the “least restrictive\n\nmeans” of furthering their “compelling interest.” They must merely “demonstrate\n\nthat the challenged practice is job related for the position in question and consistent\n\nwith business necessity.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)(1)(A)(i). However difficult this\n\nmay have proven to be in some cases, demonstrating business necessity is certainly\n\non an entirely different evidentiary planet than demonstrating a compelling\n\ninterest; it is a rare day, indeed, that courts find government actors to have\n\nadequately demonstrated a compelling interest, and a rarer one still that courts find\n\nno less restrictive alternatives to be available.\n\n      Finally, we need not dredge up this nation’s sad history of racial domination\n\nand subordination to take notice of the fact that the “injury” targeted by Title VII,\n\nintentional discrimination against racial minorities, has since our inception\n\nconstituted one of the most tormenting and vexing issues facing this country.\n\nThere can be little doubt that the core motivation animating the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment’s Equal Protection Clause was a concern for protecting the rights of\n\nracial minorities subject to historical discrimination, see Alexander Bickel, “The\n\n\n                                           38\n\fOriginal Understanding and the Segregation Decision,” 69 Harv. L. Rev. 1 (1955),\n\nand that Congress is acting most comfortably under the Amendment when it is\n\nacting to cure racial prejudice. See Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U.S. (10 Otto)\n\n303, 306-07, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"90039\"><a href=\"/opinion/90039/strauder-v-west-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L.

The House Report accompanying the 1972\n\namendments to Title VII, extending coverage to state and local governments,\n\ndocumented the troubling persistence of race discrimination in public employment:\n\n      In a report released in 1969, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights\n      examined equal employment opportunity in public employment in\n      seven urban areas located throughout the country – North as well as\n      South. The report’s findings indicate that widespread discrimination\n      against minorities exists in State and local government employment,\n      and that the existence of this discrimination is perpetuated by the\n      presence of both institutional and overt discriminatory practices. The\n      report cites widespread perpetuation of past discriminatory practices\n      through de facto segregated job ladders, invalid selection techniques,\n      and stereotyped misconceptions by supervisors regarding minority\n      group capabilities. The study also indicates that employment\n      discrimination in State and local governments is more pervasive than\n      in the private sector. The report found that in six of the seven areas\n      studied, Negroes constitute over 70 percent of the common laborers,\n      but that most white-collar jobs were found to be largely inaccessible\n      to minority persons. For example, in Atlanta and Baton Rouge, there\n      were no blacks in city managerial positions.\n             In another report issued by the U.S. Commission on Civil\n      Rights in 1970, Mexican Americans and the Administration of Justice\n      in the Southwest, the Commission found, on the basis of a 1968\n      survey, that in the law enforcement agencies and district attorneys’\n      offices in the five Southwestern States, Mexican Americans were\n      generally underrepresented in proportion to their demographic\n      distribution. The statistics in this report show that in the Southwestern\n      States Mexican Americans, who constitute approximately 12 percent\n      of the population, account for only 5.2 percent of police officers and\n\n                                         39\n\f      6.11 percent of civilian employers [sic] with law enforcement\n      agencies.\n             The problem of employment discrimination is particularly acute\n      and has the most deleterious effect in these governmental activities\n      which are most visible to the minority communities (notably\n      education, law enforcement, and the administration of justice) with the\n      result that the credibility of the government’s claim to represent all the\n      people equally is negated.\n\nH.R. Rep. No. 92-238 (1972), reprinted in 1972 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2137, 2152-53. The\n\nmeans used by Congress in the disparate impact provisions of Title VII, so closely\n\naligned to the constitutional equal protection analysis, are neither incongruent with\n\nthe purpose of preventing intentional discrimination in public employment, nor\n\ndisproportionate to the injury to be avoided.\n\n\n\n                                         V.\n\n      For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that in enacting the disparate impact\n\nprovisions of Title VII, Congress has unequivocally expressed its intent to abrogate\n\nthe states’ Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity, and that Congress has acted\n\npursuant to a valid exercise of its Fourteenth Amendment enforcement power. We,\n\ntherefore, AFFIRM the district court’s denial of defendants’ Rule 12(b)(1) motion\n\nto dismiss all disparate impact claims against the State of Alabama, based on the\n\nstate’s claim to sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment.\n\n      AFFIRMED.\n\n                                         40\n\f41\n\f</pre>",
