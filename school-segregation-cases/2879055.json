Richard Caputo\n                 _______________________________________\n\n                    Submitted Under Third Circuit LAR 34.1(a)\n                                 April 25, 2006\n\n      Before: MCKEE, FUENTES AND NYGAARD, CIRCUIT JUDGES.\n\n                               (Filed: May 19, 2006)\n\n\n                           _______________________\n\n                                  OPINION\n                           _______________________\n\nPER CURIAM\n\n    Appellant Michael Davis appeals the order of the United States District Court for\n\fthe Middle District of Pennsylvania denying his petition for writ of habeas corpus filed\n\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241. For the reasons that follow, we will affirm the judgment of\n\nthe District Court.\n\n       Davis, an inmate housed at the United States Prison-Allenwood, was subjected to a\n\nsearch of his cell. A correctional officer found a seven-inch sharpened metal rod, which\n\nDavis alleges was in fact a sardine can lid, inside a locked locker containing items\n\nbelonging to Davis. An incident report was written, charging Davis with possession,\n\nmanufacture, or introduction of a weapon. A disciplinary hearing was conducted, at\n\nwhich Davis was represented by a staff member. Davis denied the charges, made a\n\nstatement, and submitted evidence in his defense. Davis was found to have committed\n\nthe acts as charged and was sanctioned to sixty days in disciplinary segregation.\n\n       Davis filed in District Court a section 2241 habeas petition, seeking expungement\n\nof the offense from his record. Davis alleged that his due process rights were violated\n\nduring the various stages of the disciplinary proceedings. The prison respondents filed a\n\nresponse. The District Court denied the habeas petition and denied Davis’s subsequent\n\nmotion for reconsideration.\n\n       Davis appeals both orders. We have appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\nIn this federal habeas proceeding, we exercise plenary review over the District Court’s\n\nlegal conclusions and apply a clearly erroneous standard to its factual findings. Cradle v.\n\nUnited States, 290 F.3d 536, 538 (3d Cir. 2002).\n\n       Upon consideration of the record and the parties’ arguments on appeal, we agree\n\fwith the District Court’s conclusion that habeas relief is not available to Davis because he\n\nis not challenging the fact or duration of his confinement. See Preiser v. Rodriguez,\n\n411 U.S. 475 (1973). A habeas petition would be the proper means of seeking relief if\n\nthe sanction had included loss of good time credits. See id. at 487. A sanction of\n\ndisciplinary segregation, however, does not implicate the fact or length of confinement.1\n\nDavis argues that the District Court improperly denied his motion for reconsideration\n\nwithout evaluating his due process claims. For the same reasons already stated, we\n\ndiscern no error in the denial of the motion for reconsideration, in which Davis expanded\n\nupon his due process claims relating to the disciplinary proceedings.2\n\n       We have considered Davis’s arguments and conclude that they are without merit.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the order denying Davis’s habeas petition under\n\n28 U.S.C. § 2241.\n\n\n\n\n   1\n    In his affidavit accompanying his habeas petition, Davis implies that the proceedings\nresulted in the loss of good time credit. (Habeas Petition, Affidavit at 4 ¶23.) However,\nthe Discipline Hearing Officer Report reflects that disciplinary segregation was the only\nsanction imposed.\n   2\n    We note that Davis filed a separate action pursuant to Bivens v. Six Unknown\nNamed Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971), and therein included\ndue process claims concerning the disciplinary hearing at issue sub judice. The matter is\ncurrently pending in a separate appeal, C.A. No. 05-4801.\n\f",
