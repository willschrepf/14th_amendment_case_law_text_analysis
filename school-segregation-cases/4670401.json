Connor, Clerk\n\fDAVIS, Senior Circuit Judge, concurring:\n\n       I concur in the order granting the unopposed motion to vacate the district court’s\n\npreliminary injunction and add these observations.\n\n       G.G., then a fifteen-year-old transgender boy, addressed the Gloucester County\n\nSchool Board on November 11, 2014, to explain why he was not a danger to other students.\n\nHe explained that he had used the boys’ bathroom in public places throughout Gloucester\n\nCounty and had never had a confrontation. He explained that he is a person worthy of\n\ndignity and privacy. He explained why it is humiliating to be segregated from the general\n\npopulation. He knew, intuitively, what the law has in recent decades acknowledged: the\n\nperpetuation of stereotypes is one of many forms of invidious discrimination. And so he\n\nhoped that his heartfelt explanation would help the powerful adults in his community come\n\nto understand what his adolescent peers already did. G.G. clearly and eloquently attested\n\nthat he was not a predator, but a boy, despite the fact that he did not conform to some\n\npeople’s idea about who is a boy. 1\n\n       Regrettably, a majority of the School Board was unpersuaded. And so we come to\n\nthis moment. High school graduation looms and, by this court’s order vacating the\n\npreliminary injunction, G.G.’s banishment from the boys’ restroom becomes an enduring\n\nfeature of his high school experience. Would that courtesies extended to others had been\n\nextended to G.G.\n\n\n\n\n1\n Footage of his compelling statement to the School Board is available at:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My0GYq_Wydw&feature=youtu.be.\n                                            2\n\f       Our country has a long and ignominious history of discriminating against our most\n\nvulnerable and powerless.      We have an equally long history, however, of brave\n\nindividuals—Dred Scott, Fred Korematsu, Linda Brown, Mildred and Richard Loving,\n\nEdie Windsor, and Jim Obergefell, to name just a few—who refused to accept quietly the\n\ninjustices that were perpetuated against them. It is unsurprising, of course, that the burden\n\nof confronting and remedying injustice falls on the shoulders of the oppressed. These\n\nindividuals looked to the federal courts to vindicate their claims to human dignity, but as\n\nthe names listed above make clear, the judiciary’s response has been decidedly mixed.\n\nToday, G.G. adds his name to the list of plaintiffs whose struggle for justice has been\n\ndelayed and rebuffed; as Dr. King reminded us, however, “the arc of the moral universe is\n\nlong, but it bends toward justice.” G.G.’s journey is delayed but not finished.\n\n       G.G.’s case is about much more than bathrooms. It’s about a boy asking his school\n\nto treat him just like any other boy. It’s about protecting the rights of transgender people\n\nin public spaces and not forcing them to exist on the margins. It’s about governmental\n\nvalidation of the existence and experiences of transgender people, as well as the simple\n\nrecognition of their humanity. His case is part of a larger movement that is redefining and\n\nbroadening the scope of civil and human rights so that they extend to a vulnerable group\n\nthat has traditionally been unrecognized, unrepresented, and unprotected.\n\n       G.G.’s plight has shown us the inequities that arise when the government organizes\n\nsociety by outdated constructs like biological sex and gender. Fortunately, the law\n\neventually catches up to the lived facts of people; indeed, the record shows that the\n\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\fCommonwealth of Virginia has now recorded a birth certificate for G.G. that designates\n\nhis sex as male.\n\n       G.G.’s lawsuit also has demonstrated that some entities will not protect the rights of\n\nothers unless compelled to do so. Today, hatred, intolerance, and discrimination persist —\n\nand are sometimes even promoted — but by challenging unjust policies rooted in invidious\n\ndiscrimination, G.G. takes his place among other modern-day human rights leaders who\n\nstrive to ensure that, one day, equality will prevail, and that the core dignity of every one\n\nof our brothers and sisters is respected by lawmakers and others who wield power over\n\ntheir lives.\n\n       G.G. is and will be famous, and justifiably so. But he is not “famous” in the\n\nhollowed-out Hollywood sense of the term. He is famous for the reasons celebrated by the\n\nrenowned Palestinian-American poet Naomi Shehab Nye, in her extraordinary poem,\n\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\f  Famous. Despite his youth and the formidable power of those arrayed against him at\n\n  every stage of these proceedings, “[he] never forgot what [he] could do.” 2\n\n         Judge Floyd has authorized me to state that he joins in the views expressed herein.\n\n\n\n\n  2\n   See N. S. Nye, Famous:\nThe river is famous to the fish.\n\nThe loud voice is famous to silence,\nwhich knew it would inherit the earth\nbefore anybody said so.\n\nThe cat sleeping on the fence is famous to the birds\nwatching him from the birdhouse.\n\nThe tear is famous, briefly, to the cheek.\n\nThe idea you carry close to your bosom\nis famous to your bosom.\n\nThe boot is famous to the earth,\nmore famous than the dress shoe,\nwhich is famous only to floors.\n\nThe bent photograph is famous to the one who carries it\nand not at all famous to the one who is pictured.\n\nI want to be famous to shuffling men\nwho smile while crossing streets,\nsticky children in grocery lines,\nfamous as the one who smiled back.\n\nI want to be famous in the way a pulley is famous,\nor a buttonhole, not because it did anything spectacular,\nbut because it never forgot what it could do.\n                                               5\n\f",
