O.D., a minor child, filed a petition in Pontotoc County Chancery Court for approval\n\nof a settlement her parents had negotiated with car insurance companies for injuries she had\n\nsuffered in a car accident. On the day of the hearing, Ashley Healthcare Plan, O.D.’s health\n\ninsurance coverage provider, which had a subrogation lien against the proceeds of O.D.’s\n\nclaim, removed the case to federal court, arguing that the Mississippi law which required the\n\fchancery court’s approval of O.D.’s settlement claims, Mississippi Code Section 93-13-59,\n\nwas preempted by the federal Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974\n\n(“ERISA”). The United States District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi held\n\nthat ERISA did not preempt the state law and remanded the case to the chancery court\n\nwithout awarding attorney’s fees to O.D. On motion from O.D.’s parents, the Pontotoc\n\nCounty Chancery Court awarded O.D. attorney’s fees, holding that Ashley Healthcare Plan’s\n\nremoval to federal court was contrary to clearly established law and that it was done for the\n\npurpose of delaying litigation. Although O.D. could have sought recovery of attorney’s fees\n\nunder Rule 54 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, frivolous removals to federal court\n\nalso are subject to the Mississippi Litigation Accountability Act. Miss. Code Ann. §§ 11-55-1\n\nto 11-51-15 (Rev. 2012). Furthermore, Ashley Healthcare Plan’s removal to federal court\n\nwas contrary to two decades of case law which uniformly held that Mississippi’s law\n\nrequiring chancery court approval of minors’ settlements is not preempted by ERISA and that\n\nAshley Healthcare Plan was seeking a remedy in federal court that was unavailable to it\n\nunder the ERISA Civil Enforcement Clause. We therefore affirm the judgment of the\n\nchancery court because its award of attorney’s fees on this basis was not an abuse of\n\ndiscretion.\n\n                       FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n¶2.    On March 6, 2011, Mercedes Navarette failed to yield the right-of-way to oncoming\n\ntraffic on Highway 278 in Pontotoc County and struck a car driven by Kimberly Dillard.\n\nDillard’s three-year-old daughter, O.D., was in the back seat. As a result of the collision,\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\fO.D. suffered significant injuries. Her right leg was fractured, and she had bruises on her\n\nface, scalp, neck, and thigh. O.D. was airlifted to Le Bonheur Children’s Hospital in\n\nMemphis. For the treatment of her leg, O.D. spent three nights in the hospital and had two\n\nseparate surgeries.\n\n¶3.    Later that summer, on August 21, 2011, O.D.’s parents, Kimberly Dillard and Michael\n\nDillard, petitioned the Pontotoc County Chancery Court for appointment as O.D.’s general\n\nguardians.1 The Chancery Court granted that petition. The purpose of the Dillards’\n\nguardianship over O.D. was to pursue a claim for the child’s personal injuries and medical\n\ncare. As the court-appointed general guardians for O.D., the Dillards engaged in settlement\n\nnegotiations with Allstate Insurance Company, Navarette’s insurance carrier. The Dillards\n\nsubmitted, for the Pontotoc County Chancery Court’s approval, a compromise settlement of\n\n$25,000, Naverette’s liability insurance policy’s maximum limit of applicable coverage. The\n\nDillards also made an uninsured/underinsured claim against their own automobile insurance\n\ncarrier, State Farm Insurance Company. The Dillards obtained a settlement offer from State\n\nFarm for $50,000, its policy limit.\n\n\n\n\n       1\n        The natural parents of a minor are the child’s natural guardians, and they are\nresponsible for the care, maintenance, and education of their child/ward. Miss. Code Ann.\n§ 93-13-1 (Rev. 2013). The chancery court, however, is empowered to appoint general\nguardians (i.e., legal) to represent the legal interests of the minor. Miss. Code Ann. § 93-13-\n15 (Rev. 2013).\n\n                                              3\n\f¶4.    In accordance with Mississippi law regarding minors’ legal settlements,2 on October\n\n13, 2011, the Dillards filed a Petition for Authority to Settle and Compromise Doubtful\n\nClaim of Minor. The Dillards sought approval from the Pontotoc County Chancery Court\n\nof the settlement of O.D.’s claims against both State Farm Insurance and Allstate Insurance\n\nfor a total of $75,000, which was all of the available liability insurance coverage.\n\n¶5.        In addition to informing the chancery court of the settlement offers, the petition\n\naverred that Ashley Furniture Industries maintained an employer-funded healthcare plan and\n\nthat the plan was established under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974\n\n(ERISA). Because O.D. was a minor child and dependent of her father, Michael Dillard, an\n\nemployee of Ashley Furniture Industries at its Ecru factory, O.D. was a covered beneficiary\n\nof the plan. During the course of O.D.’s car-wreck-related medical treatment, the Ashley\n\nHealthcare Plan (“the plan”) had paid $33,683.58 toward O.D.’s medical bills. The plan\n\npreviously had asserted its intention to enforce a subrogation lien, contained within the\n\nlanguage of the plan, for the amount of all of O.D.’s medical bills against all sums O.D.\n\nmight receive from the automobile insurance companies. The Dillards requested of the\n\nchancery court that the car insurance settlement proceeds be distributed for the minor’s\n\n\n\n       2\n       Miss. Code Ann. § 93-13-59 (Rev. 2013):\n\n       Guardians may be empowered by the court, or chancellor in vacation, to sell\n       or compromise claims due their wards, on the same proceedings and under the\n       same circumstances prescribed in reference to the sale or compromise by an\n       executor or administrator of claims belonging to the estate of a deceased\n       person. And the guardian in such case is authorized to receive in satisfaction\n       of claims, when to the interest of the ward, property, real or personal, the title\n       to be taken in the name of the ward.\n\n                                               4\n\fexclusive benefit, i.e., paid to the minor. To this end, the Dillards also sought denial of\n\nreimbursement to the plan for the medical expenses paid on her behalf on account of the\n\naccident .\n\n¶6.    On October 14, 2011, the Dillards served on the plan a summons under Rule 81 of the\n\nMississippi Rules of Civil Procedure, along with their Petition for Authority to Settle and\n\nCompromise Doubtful Claim of Minor. The summons directed Ashley Healthcare Plan to\n\nappear at a hearing at 9:30 a.m. on November 14, 2011, at the Pontotoc County Chancery\n\nCourt to assert its claimed subrogation lien against O.D.’s settlement.\n\n¶7.    On November 14, 2011, the day that the Pontotoc County Chancery Court was to\n\nconduct the hearing on settlement of O.D.’s insurance claims, the plan removed the case to\n\nthe United States District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi, asserting that O.D.’s\n\n“claim against [Ashley Healthcare Plan] falls within the scope of ERISA’s civil enforcement\n\nstatute . . . and is completely preempted and is therefore removable.”\n\n¶8.    On November 17, 2011, the Dillards filed a Motion to Remand the case, arguing that\n\nthe United States District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi has “held that the\n\nEmployment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (‘ERISA’) does not preempt\n\nMississippi law, which requires chancery court approval for the administration of a minor’s\n\nestate. Therefore this case must be remanded to state court for lack of subject matter\n\njurisdiction.” The Dillards further alleged that “this case was removed for the improper\n\npurpose of avoiding or delaying the finality of the administration of the minor’s estate\n\ncurrently pending in the Chancery Court of Pontotoc County, Mississippi.” The Dillards also\n\n\n\n                                               5\n\fmoved under 28 U.S.C. § 1447 for attorney’s fees incurred by them as a result of Ashley’s\n\nremoval of the case to federal court.\n\n¶9.    On December 12, 2011, the plan filed a Response to the Dillards’ Motion to Remand,\n\narguing that “[t]he only question before the Court is whether or not Plaintiffs’ well-pleaded\n\ncomplaint filed in state court raises a claim within the federal subject matter jurisdiction of\n\nthis Court.” Again, the plan averred that O.D.’s claim in chancery court fell squarely within\n\nERISA’s enforcement provisions and that her claims were completely preempted by federal\n\nlaw.\n\n¶10.   Nearly two years after the plan had removed the case to federal court, on September\n\n27, 2013, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi remanded\n\nthe case to Pontotoc County Chancery Court. The Memorandum Opinion held that “the\n\nadministration of a minor’s estate is entirely a matter of state law, and is law of general\n\napplication which affects a broad range of matters entirely unrelated to ERISA.” The district\n\ncourt held that the Dillards’ claim for approval of the minor’s settlement was not preempted\n\nby ERISA and found that Ashley Healthcare Plan’s claim for reimbursement did not\n\nconstitute a cognizable claim under the ERISA civil enforcement statute. Although the\n\nDillards had asserted a claim for attorney’s fees incurred during the course of the remand\n\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1447, they did not renew their request for fees by filing a Federal\n\nRule of Civil Procedure 54(d) motion in federal court.\n\n¶11.   Instead, on October 29, 2013, the Dillards filed a motion for attorney’s fees under the\n\nMississippi Litigation Accountability Act of 1988 (Miss. Code Ann. §§ 11-55-1 to 11-51-15\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\f(Rev. 2012)) in Pontotoc County Chancery Court, arguing that the plan’s removal of O.D.’s\n\ncase to federal district court had been “frivolous, filed for the purpose of harassment and\n\ndelay, and did not have support in law or fact.”\n\n¶12.   On December 4, 2013, the chancery court conducted a hearing to address the Dillards’\n\nmotion for attorney’s fees and to settle O.D.’s insurance claims. During the course of the\n\nhearing, the chancery court allowed O.D.’s parents, as her general guardians, to settle her\n\nclaims with both automobile insurers for $75,000. The chancery court also refused to\n\nenforce the plan’s subrogation lien; the plan was not reimbursed for the moneys it had paid\n\nfor O.D.’s accident-related health care.\n\n¶13.   On February 6, 2014, the chancery court awarded attorney’s fees to the Dillards in\n\naccordance with the Litigation Accountability Act for Ashley Healthcare Plan’s improper\n\nremoval of the case to federal court. In his thirteen-page written order, the chancellor\n\nreasoned that the issue of attorney’s fees was properly before the court because “there was\n\nno determination made by the federal court concerning attorney’s fees nor was the issue of\n\nattorney’s fees considered by the federal court.” The court further held that “[t]he only\n\npurpose for removal of the minor’s settlement . . . was for Defendants to engage in forum\n\nshopping and delay the final outcome of this matter.” The court found that “[d]efendants,\n\nfollowing commencement of their removal of a minor’s settlement to federal court, failed to\n\nmake any effort to dismiss their removal action after being provided numerous cases directly\n\non point which irrefutably held that their basis for removal was invalid.” After discussing\n\n\n\n\n                                             7\n\fthe factors outlined in the Litigation Accountability Act, the chancery court awarded the\n\nDillards $18,180 in attorney’s fees.\n\n¶14.    Ashley Healthcare Plan now appeals the award of attorney’s fees. There are two\n\nissues before this Court: (1) whether the Litigation Accountability Act enables Mississippi\n\ncourts to sanction litigants for frivolous removals and (2) whether the Pontotoc County\n\nChancery Court abused its discretion in holding that Ashley Healthcare Plan frivolously\n\nremoved this case to federal court.\n\n                                       DISCUSSION\n\n       I. Does the Litigation Accountability Act enable Mississippi courts to\n       sanction litigants for frivolous removals?\n\n¶15.   Whether a chancery court is allowed to award attorney’s fees under the Litigation\n\nAccountability Act for a frivolous removal to federal court is a matter of first impression\n\nbefore this Court. When the imposition of attorney’s fees raises a question of law, the\n\nstandard of review is de novo. See Amiker v. Drugs for Less, Inc., 796 So. 2d 942, 945-46\n\n(Miss. 2001).\n\n¶16.   It is undisputed that, in their Motion for Remand, the Dillards claimed they were\n\nentitled to attorney’s fees under 28 U.S.C. § 1447 because Ashley Healthcare Plan’s removal\n\nto federal court was frivolous. But the Dillards never pursued a motion for attorney’s fees\n\nunder Rule 54 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the proper means for obtaining fees\n\nin federal courts. According to the plan, the only means of recovery for the frivolous removal\n\nof a case to federal court is filing a motion for attorney’s fees and costs under Rule 54 of the\n\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure. Thus, the plan argues that, because the Dillards did not file\n\n\n                                               8\n\fa Rule 54 motion in federal court, they are precluded from filing a motion for attorney’s fees\n\nin Mississippi state court under the Litigation Accountability Act.\n\n¶17.   Whether the Dillards could or should have pursued attorney’s fees in federal court is\n\nirrelevant. The relevant inquiry here is whether the Dillards could pursue attorney’s fees in\n\nchancery court under the Litigation Accountability Act for the plan’s frivolous removal. The\n\nLitigation Accountability Act provides in pertinent part:\n\n       [I]n any civil action commenced or appealed in any court of record in this\n       state, the court shall award, as part of its judgment and in addition to any other\n       costs otherwise assessed, reasonable attorney’s fees and costs against any party\n       or attorney if the court, upon the motion of any party or on its own motion,\n       finds that an attorney or party brought an action, or asserted any claim or\n       defense, that is without substantial justification, or that the action, or any claim\n       or defense asserted, was interposed for delay or harassment, or if it finds that\n       an attorney or party unnecessarily expanded the proceedings by other improper\n       conduct . . . .\n\nMiss. Code Ann. § 11-55-5(1) (Rev. 2012). The statute contains no express language which\n\nprohibits a judge’s imposition of attorney’s fees for frivolous removals to federal court. In\n\nfact, insofar as a party must file a notice of removal in state court in order to remove the case\n\nto federal court, and assuming the removal to have been frivolous, this would fall squarely\n\nwithin the parameters of the statute, which enables Mississippi judges to levy fees against\n\nparties who “asserted any claim or defense . . . that is without substantial justification,” who\n\n“asserted . . . any claim or defense . . . for delay or harassment,” or “who unnecessarily\n\nexpanded the proceedings by other improper conduct.” The fact is that removal has a\n\ntremendous impact on the chancery court’s (or any other state court’s) ability to adjudicate\n\na case in a timely manner in that removal completely deprives the state court of jurisdiction\n\n\n\n                                                9\n\fover the matter. See Allman v. Hanley, 302 F.2d 559, 562 (5th Cir. 1962) (“Upon the filing\n\nof a proper petition for removal and upon compliance with the applicable statutes, the state\n\ncourt loses jurisdiction and all further process must issue from the Federal court.” ) (citing\n\n28 U.S.C. §§ 1446(e), 1447(a); F.R.C.P 81(c). Moreover, a notice of removal constitutes a\n\nclaim that state court jurisdiction over the matter is improper and a defense against the state\n\ncourt’s continued exercise of jurisdiction over the claims. See Hooker v. Greer, 81 So. 3d\n\n1103 (Miss. 2012) (noting that the Litigation Accountability Act extends to “any separate\n\ncount, claim, defense or request for relief”). In this case, Ashley Healthcare Plan’s removal\n\nsuspended the Pontotoc County Chancery Court’s jurisdiction for two years, preventing that\n\ncourt’s approval of the settlements of O.D.’s claims against Allstate Insurance Company and\n\nState Farm Insurance Company.\n\n¶18.   Courts from other states have addressed the levy of attorney’s fees against parties for\n\nfrivolous removal of state court cases to federal court. For example, in Ex Parte Bon\n\nSecours-St. Francis Xavier Hosp., Inc., 713 S.E. 2d 624 (S.C. 2011), the South Carolina\n\nSupreme Court considered the trial court’s imposition of sanctions and attorney’s fees for a\n\nfrivolous removal action pursuant to Rule 11 of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\nIn Bon Secours, the party improperly removed a case to federal district court twice, the\n\nsecond time just hours before trial was to commence. Id. at 626-27; see Hooker v. Greer,\n\n81 So. 3d 1103 (Miss. 2012) (“The provisions of the [Litigation Accountability Act] are in\n\nharmony with those of Mississippi Rule of Civil Procedure 11, which allows for the awarding\n\nof attorney’s fees as a sanction. The LAA merely augments Rule 11 by ‘stating that the court\n\n\n\n                                              10\n\fshall specifically set forth the reasons for awarding attorney fees and costs and enumerates\n\nfactors which shall be considered by the court.”’) (internal citations omitted). The South\n\nCarolina Supreme Court held that “vexatious removal is sanctionable conduct, and parties\n\nwill be held accountable for the unnecessary expense and delay caused by abuses of the right\n\nto removal.” Id. at 629. Similarly, courts from Texas and Louisiana have supported the use\n\nof sanctions under their respective laws regarding sanctions and attorney’s fees. See Stratton\n\nv. Frankwell Inv. Serv., Inc., Nos. 01-99-00405-CV, 01-99-00459-CV (Tex. Ct. App. Mar.\n\n2, 2000); Nodier v. Ungarnino & Eckert, LLC, 2007 WL 1300805 (La. App. 1st Cir. May\n\n4, 2007).\n\n¶19.   In conformity with the plain meaning of the Mississippi Litigation Accountability Act,\n\nwe hold that the imposition of attorney’s fees as sanctions for frivolous removal is within the\n\npowers of Mississippi courts. Federal court does not provide the exclusive remedy for\n\nattorney’s fees incurred as a result of frivolous removals.\n\n       II. Did the Pontotoc County Chancery Court abuse its discretion in\n       holding that Ashley Healthcare Plan frivolously removed this case to\n       federal court?\n\n\n¶20.   This Court reviews a trial court’s award of attorney’s fees under the Litigation\n\nAccountability      Act    for    an    abuse      of   discretion.   Choctaw,       Inc.   v.\n\nCampbell-Cherry-Harrison-Davis & Dove, 965 So. 2d 1041, 1045 n.6 (Miss. 2007).\n\n¶21.   Ashley Healthcare Plan argues on appeal that its removal of O.D.’s settlement to\n\nfederal court was not without substantial justification and that the chancery court therefore\n\nerred by awarding the Dillards attorney’s fees. The Dillards respond that the plan’s removal\n\n                                              11\n\fto federal court was contrary to clearly established law and that attorney’s fees were awarded\n\non the basis of the plan’s improper removal and the plan’s failure to meet court deadlines.\n\nThe record makes clear, however, that the chancery court did not consider anything other\n\nthan the improper removal to federal court in deciding to award attorney’s fees.\n\n       A. Did the Pontotoc County Chancery Court abuse its discretion in\n       determining that Ashley Healthcare Plan removed this case to federal\n       court without substantial justification?\n\n¶22.   In relevant part, the Mississippi Litigation Accountability Act provides:\n\n       In any civil action commenced or appealed in any court of record in this state,\n       the court shall award . . . reasonable attorney’s fees and costs against any party\n       or attorney if the court, upon the motion of any party or on its own motion,\n       finds that an attorney or party brought an action . . . that is without substantial\n       justification, or that the action, or any claim or defense asserted, was\n       interposed for delay or harassment . . . .\n\nMiss. Code Ann. § 11-55-5(1) (Rev. 2012).3 The Act defines a claim brought “without\n\nsubstantial justification” to be one that is “frivolous, groundless in fact or in law, or\n\nvexatious, as determined by the court.” Miss. Code Ann. § 11-55-3(a) (Rev. 2012). This\n\nCourt applies the same test to determine whether a filing is frivolous under both Rule 11 and\n\n\n\n       3\n           The plan also directs us to Mississippi Code Section 11-55-5(4):\n\n       No party, except an attorney licensed to practice law in this state, who is\n       appearing without an attorney shall be assessed attorney’s fees unless the court\n       finds that the party clearly knew or reasonably should have known that such\n       party’s action, claim or defense or any part of it was without substantial\n       justification.\n\nThis provision applies only to pro se litigants and should not affect the Court’s analysis in\nthis case.\n\n                                               12\n\fthe Act. A claim is frivolous when, “objectively speaking, the pleader or movant has no hope\n\nof success.” Leaf River Forest Prods., Inc. v. Deakle, 661 So. 2d 188, 195 (Miss. 1995)\n\n(internal citation omitted).\n\n¶23.   The Pontotoc County Chancery Court, in a thirteen-page order, justified its award of\n\nattorney’s fees under the Litigation Accountability Act. The court held that “the actions of\n\nthe Ashley Healthcare Plan in delaying the minor settlement along with their failure to\n\nascertain the law and jurisdiction as to minor’s settlements demonstrates an award against\n\nthe Ashley Healthcare Plan under the Litigation Accountability Act is proper.”             The\n\nchancery court further reasoned that the plan had represented to the federal court that:\n\n       [A]lthough there was no written subrogation agreement with the Plaintiffs, any\n       decision by the chancellor concerning the minor’s rights to settlement proceeds\n       was within the exclusive jurisdiction of federal courts. This statement . . .\n       directly contradicts prior established case law that ERISA does not preempt\n       Mississippi law requiring chancery court approval of minor’s settlements.\n\nThe chancery court held that Ashley Healthcare Plan “failed to make any effort to dismiss\n\ntheir removal action after being provided numerous cases directly on point which irrefutably\n\nheld their basis of removal was invalid.” The chancery court noted that the relief sought by\n\nthe plan was not allowed by ERISA’s Civil Enforcement Provision. Finally, the chancery\n\ncourt found that “[t]he only purpose for removal of the minor’s settlement from the Chancery\n\nCourt of Pontotoc County, Mississippi to the United States District Court for the Northern\n\nDistrict of Mississippi was for Defendants to engage in forum shopping and delay the final\n\noutcome of this matter.”\n\n\n\n\n                                             13\n\f¶24.   Because the chancery court’s award of attorney’s fees is inextricably intertwined with\n\nits determination that it was clearly established that the chancery court’s statutory duty to\n\napprove the settlement of O.D.’s liability insurance claims was not preempted by ERISA,\n\nwe proceed to address the merits of the plan’s ERISA arguments.\n\n       B. Was the remedy Ashley Healthcare Plan sought in federal court\n       available under ERISA’s enforcement provision?\n\n¶25.   On appeal, the plan asserts that it was seeking a declaratory judgment in federal court\n\nconcerning interpretation of the plan document itself. This, however, is not how the United\n\nStates District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi characterized the plan’s notice\n\nof removal. Instead, that court interpreted the plan’s claim to be one for “reimbursement.”\n\nIn essence, the plan was seeking enforcement of its subrogation clause in federal court.\n\n¶26.   The Civil Enforcement Provision of ERISA, Section 502(a), the provision under\n\nwhich the plan was seeking relief in federal court, states:\n\n       A civil action may be brought—(1) by a participant or beneficiary . . .\n\n       (B) to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan, to enforce his\n       rights under the terms of the plan, or to clarify his rights to future benefits\n       under the terms of the plan . . . .\n\n29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(1)(B).\n\n¶27.   In Mertens v. Hewitt Associates, 508 U.S. 248, 113 S. Ct. 2063, 124 L. Ed. 2d 161\n\n(1993), the United States Supreme Court made clear that the term “equitable relief” in\n\nERISA’s Civil Enforcement Provision referred only to “those types of relief that were\n\ntypically available in equity.” Id. at 256. The United States Supreme Court revisited the\n\nERISA Enforcement Provision in Great-West Life & Annuity Insurance Co. v. Knudson,\n\n\n                                             14\n\f534 U.S. 204, 122 S. Ct. 708, 151 L. Ed. 2d 635 (2002). In Knudson, the employee benefit\n\nplan at issue included a reimbursement provision which stated that the plan had “the right to\n\nrecover from a beneficiary any payment for benefits paid by the Plan that the beneficiary is\n\nentitled to recover from a third party.” Id. at 711. The Court held that, by attempting to\n\nobtain reimbursement, Great-West was not seeking “to enjoin any act or practice which\n\nviolate [d] . . . the terms of the plan” or “to obtain other appropriate equitable relief” under\n\nSection 502(a)(3). Id. Declining to construe Great-West’s complaint as seeking a remedy\n\nthat was “typically available in equity” as Mertens requires, the Court reasoned that Great-\n\nWest essentially sought “to impose personal liability on [the Knudsons] for a contractual\n\nobligation to pay money–relief that was not typically available in equity.” Id.\n\n¶28.   Similarly, in Bauhaus USA, Inc. v. Copeland, 292 F.3d 439, 442 (5th Cir. 2002),4 the\n\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit addressed an insurance company’s\n\nattempt to enforce a subrogation clause against a minor under the ERISA enforcement\n\nstatute. Copeland, 292 F.3d at 442. The Fifth Circuit held that ERISA’s civil enforcement\n\nprovision failed to authorize plaintiff’s suit, as the claim for reimbursement was a claim for\n\nmoney due and owing under a contract and not an equitable remedy as required under\n\n       4\n         This is the same Copeland case that was dismissed by the Northern District of\nMississippi for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Bauhaus USA, Inc. v. Copeland, 2001\nWL 1524373 (N.D. Miss. Mar. 9, 2001). On appeal, the Fifth Circuit did not reach the\npreemption issue with regard to Section 93-13-59 (Rev. 2014). Instead, the court held that\nit did not have subject-matter jurisdiction because the remedy the insurance plan sought,\nenforcement of a subrogation clause, was not cognizable under the ERISA enforcement\nprovision. Copeland, 292 F.3d at 442. Later, in ACS Recovery Services, Inc. v. Griffin, 723\nF.3d 518 (5th Cir. 2013), the en banc Fifth Circuit overruled Copeland and held that failure\nto state a cognizable claim under the ERISA Enforcement Provision did not inherently\ndeprive federal courts of subject-matter jurisdiction.\n\n                                              15\n\fERISA. Id. at 443-45. Indeed, the Fifth Circuit, in comparing the Copeland case to the\n\nUnited States Supreme Court case Knudson noted the following:\n\n       Both cases involve ERISA-governed employee benefit plans that include\n       reimbursement provisions allowing the plans to recover from any settlement\n       proceeds any amount the plans advanced for medical expenses resulting from\n       third party wrong-doing. Third-party tortfeasors injured the plan beneficiaries\n       in both cases, and the plans advanced funds to the beneficiaries for medical\n       expenses. In both cases, the plan beneficiaries made tort settlements with\n       third-party tortfeasors following suit in state court. In both, the plan\n       administrator or assignee filed suit in the federal district court seeking\n       declaratory relief that it was entitled to repayment of the benefits it had\n       conferred. In the instant case, the settlement proceeds are in the registry of the\n       Mississippi Chancery Court. In [Knudson], the proceeds of the settlement\n       were placed in a private Special Needs Trust outside the possession and\n       control of the plan beneficiary.\n\nCopeland, 292 F.3d at 445.\n\n¶29.   It is therefore clear that, in the light of the United States Supreme Court’s decision in\n\nKnudson and the Fifth Circuit’s corresponding decision in Copeland, Ashley was seeking\n\na remedy in federal court that did not exist under the ERISA Enforcement Provision. By\n\nremoving the case to federal court, the plan failed to state a claim that was cognizable under\n\nfederal law.\n\n¶30.   The dissent fails to acknowledge that Ashley was pursuing a remedy, and thus a cause\n\nof action, that was unavailable to it under federal law. Thus, when the dissent bemoans that\n\nAshley’s attorneys“did nothing more than advance a legal theory,” it stops short of holding\n\nAshley’s lawyers responsible for minimal legal research and diligence. Dissent ¶ 46.\n\nBecause United States Supreme Court and Fifth Circuit precedents explicitly foreclose\n\nAshley from seeking damages in federal court under the ERISA enforcement provision, it\n\n\n\n                                              16\n\fis well established that, even if a legitimate argument could credibly be made that Mississippi\n\nCode Section 93-13-59 was preempted by ERISA, Ashley’s removal immediately would\n\nhave been dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Thus,\n\nif considered on the merits, the plan’s removal would be subject to summary dismissal under\n\nRule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. This supports the chancellor’s\n\nfinding, which we subject to a review for an abuse of discretion, that Ashley Healthcare Plan\n\nfrivolously removed this case to federal court.\n\n       C. Was it well established that ERISA does not preempt Mississippi Code\n       Section 93-13-59, the Mississippi law requiring chancery court approval\n       of minors’ claims and settlements?\n\n¶31.   At this point, the debate is settled that the district court unequivocally did not have\n\nsubject-matter jurisdiction over this case. Thus, the only issue in contention is whether\n\nAshley Healthcare Plan removed this case contrary to settled law.\n\n¶32.   The federal removal statute authorizes removal to federal court of a civil action filed\n\nin state court if the claim is one “arising under” federal law or if there is diversity jurisdiction\n\nand the defendant is not a citizen of the state where the action is brought.5 See 28 U.S.C. §\n\n1441(b) (2000). As the United States Supreme Court has explained:\n\n       To determine whether the claim arises under federal law, we examine the “well\n       pleaded” allegations of the complaint and ignore potential defenses: A suit\n       arises under the Constitution and the laws of the United States only when the\n       plaintiff’s statement of his own cause of action shows that it is based upon\n       those laws or that Constitution. It is not enough that the plaintiff alleges some\n       anticipated defense to his cause of action and asserts that the defense is\n       invalidated by some provision of the Constitution of the United States. As a\n\n       5\n          Here, O.D.’s tort claims were the “mainspring” of the case. There was no\naffirmatively alleged federal claim which gave rise to federal jurisdiction.\n\n                                                17\n\f       general rule, absent diversity jurisdiction, a case will not be removable if the\n       complaint does not affirmatively allege a federal claim.\n\nBeneficial Nat’l Bank v. Anderson, 539 U.S. 1, 123 S. Ct. 2058, 2062, 156 L. Ed. 2d 1\n\n(2003).\n\n¶33.   There is an exception to the well-pleaded complaint rule, though, if Congress “so\n\ncompletely pre-empt[s] a particular area that any civil complaint raising this select group of\n\nclaims is necessarily federal in character.” Metro. Life Ins. Co. v. Taylor, 481 U.S. 58, 63-\n\n64, 107 S. Ct. 1542, 95 L. Ed. 2d 55 (1987), superseded by statute on other grounds as\n\nrecognized in, Hunter v. Ameritech, 779 F. Supp. 419 (N.D. Ill.1991).\n\n¶34.   ERISA “supersede[s] any and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter\n\nrelate to any employee benefit plan. . . .” 29 U.S.C. § 1144(a). Preemption under ERISA is\n\n“deliberately expansive.” Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, 481 U.S. 41, 45, 107 S. Ct. 1549,\n\n1552, 95 L. Ed. 2d 39 (1987). “A law ‘relates to’ an employee benefit plan, in the normal\n\nsense of the phrase, if it has a connection with or reference to such a plan.” Shaw v. Delta\n\nAir Lines, Inc., 463 U.S. 85, 96-97, 103 S. Ct. 2890, 2900, 77 L. Ed. 2d 490 (1983); Hook\n\nv. Morrison Milling Co., 38 F.3d 776, 781 (5th Cir. 1994). A state law may “relate to” a plan\n\n“even if that law was not specifically designed to affect such plans, and even if its effect is\n\nonly indirect.” Rokohl v. Texaco, Inc., 77 F.3d 126, 129 (5th Cir. 1996) (citing Rozzell v.\n\nSec. Servs., Inc., 38 F.3d 819, 821 (5th Cir. 1994)). Nonetheless, ERISA preemption is not\n\nall-encompassing, and state actions which affect employee benefit plans in “too tenuous,\n\nremote, or peripheral a manner” will not justify a finding that the law “relates to” a plan.\n\nShaw, 463 U.S. at 100 n.21.\n\n                                              18\n\f¶35.   As a general rule, there is an assumption that state laws concerning domestic relations\n\nare “too tenuous, remote, or peripheral” to be preempted by ERISA. See id. The United\n\nStates Supreme Court repeatedly has noted that, in enacting ERISA, “Congress [did] not\n\nintend to preempt areas of traditional state regulation.” FMC Corp. v. Holliday, 498 U.S. 52,\n\n62, 111 S. Ct. 403, 112 L. Ed. 2d 356 (1990). “The whole subject of the domestic relations\n\nof husband and wife, parent and child, belongs to the laws of the States and not to the laws\n\nof the United States.” Hisquierdo v. Hisquierdo, 439 U.S. 572, 581, 99 S. Ct. 802, 808, 59\n\nL. Ed. 2d 1 (1979) (quoting In re Burrus, 136 U.S. 586, 593-94, 10 S. Ct. 850, 853, 34 L.\n\nEd. 500 (1890)). “Because domestic relations are preeminently matters of state law, we have\n\nconsistently recognized that Congress, when it passes general legislation, rarely intends to\n\ndisplace state authority in this area.” Mansell v. Mansell, 490 U.S. 581, 587, 109 S. Ct. 2023,\n\n2028, 104 L. Ed. 2d 675 (1989). As a consequence, federal law will preempt a state law\n\npertaining to domestic relations only if: 1) Congress has positively expressed its intent to\n\npreempt the state law and 2) the state law does major damage to a clear and substantial\n\nfederal interest. Boggs v. Boggs, 849 F. Supp. 462, 465 (E.D. La. 1994) (citing Hisquiedo,\n\n439 U.S. at 581), aff’d 82 F.3d 90, rev’d 520 U.S. 833, 117 S. Ct. 1745, 138 L. Ed. 2d 45\n\n(1997).\n\n¶36.   The current case arose from the Mississippi chancery courts’ duties under Section 93-\n\n13-59 of the Mississippi Code, which provides:\n\n       Guardians may be empowered by the court, or chancellor in vacation, to sell\n       or compromise claims due their wards, on the same proceedings and under the\n       same circumstances prescribed in reference to the sale or compromise by an\n       executor or administrator of claims belonging to the estate of a deceased\n\n                                              19\n\f       person. And the guardian in such case is authorized to receive in satisfaction\n       of claims, when to the interest of the ward, property, real or personal, the title\n       to be taken in the name of the ward.\n\nMiss. Code Ann. § 93-13-59 (Rev. 2013). This statute does not contain language which\n\nexpressly implicates an ERISA plan. See id. Moreover, in Cooper Tire & Rubber Co. v.\n\nStriplin, 652 So. 2d 1102, 1104 (Miss. 1995), this Court held that “[t]he subject of minors’\n\nestates is a matter within the field of domestic relations not governed by ERISA.” Also, in\n\nIn re Guardianship of Holmes, 965 So. 2d 662, 664 (Miss. 2007), this Court held that:\n\n       Family law is an area traditionally regulated by the states. There is a\n       presumption against pre-emption. Although ERISA does state its intent to\n       pre-empt state law by positive enactment, there is no clear intention of\n       Congress to pre-empt cases dealing with minors’ rights. Moreover, there is no\n       damage to any clear and substantial federal interest.\n\nId. at 668. Thus, Section 93-13-59 falls within the realm of traditional domestic relations and\n\ndoes not expressly implicate an ERISA plan.\n\n¶37.   The question of whether Section 93-13-59 is preempted by ERISA is an issue of\n\nfederal subject-matter jurisdiction. See Metro. Life Ins. Co. v. Taylor, 481 U.S. 58, 63-64,\n\n107 S. Ct. 1542, 95 L. Ed. 2d 55 (1987). The constitutional limitations on federal jurisdiction\n\nmake federal courts “courts of limited jurisdiction,” Owen Equipment & Erection Co. v.\n\nKroger, 437 U.S. 365, 374, 98 S. Ct. 2396, 57 L. Ed. 2d 274 (1978), superseded by statute\n\non other grounds by, 28 U.S.C. § 1367 , as opposed to state courts, which presumptively have\n\nsubject-matter jurisdiction over all cases. See 13 Charles Alan Wright, and Arthur R. Miller,\n\nFederal Practice and Procedure § 3522, 100 (3d ed. 2008). Thus, if the statute is not\n\npreempted, the federal court does not have jurisdiction over the case and the removal was\n\n\n\n                                              20\n\fimproper. Moreover, federal courts have the ultimate authority to determine their own\n\njurisdiction. United States v. Ruiz, 536 U.S. 622, 628, 122 S. Ct. 2450, 153 L. Ed. 2d 586\n\n(2002). Because federal courts decide whether federal jurisdiction is proper and state courts\n\ncannot impose jurisdiction on federal courts, we will address federal precedent regarding\n\nERISA preemption of Section 93-13-59. See Teamsters Nat’l Auto. Transporters Indus.\n\nNegotiating Comm’n v. Thora, 328 F.3d 325, 327 (7th Cir. 2003) (“Federal courts are courts\n\nof limited jurisdiction and may only exercise jurisdiction where it is specifically authorized\n\nby federal statute.”) (emphasis added).\n\n¶38.   Inasmuch as the United States District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi\n\nhas held in three separate cases that ERISA does not preempt the Mississippi law requiring\n\nthe chancery court to settle the claims of minors, this principle was well established. See\n\nClardy, 921 F. Supp. at 394; Bauhaus USA, Inc. v. Copeland, 2001 WL 1524373 (N.D.\n\nMiss. Mar. 9, 2001); Estate of Ashmore v. Healthcare Recoveries, Inc., 1998 WL 211778\n\n(N.D. Miss. Mar. 25, 1998). The case most instructive to this Court’s consideration of the\n\nmerits of Ashley’s arguments is Estate of Ashmore v. Healthcare Recoveries, Inc., 1998 WL\n\n211778 (N.D. Miss. Mar. 25, 1998). In Ashmore, the court found no preemption “since\n\nadjudication does not require construing the ERISA plan.” Id. at *2. The court further opined\n\nthat “[e]ven if the parties’ ERISA plan contained an express subrogation clause, Mississippi\n\nlaw requiring prior chancery court approval of assignment of a minor’s right to insurance\n\nproceeds would not be preempted by ERISA.” Id. (citing Methodist Hosp. of Memphis v.\n\nMarsh, 518 So. 2d 1227, 1228 (Miss. 1988)) (emphasis added).\n\n\n\n                                             21\n\f¶39.   Ashley Healthcare Plan asserts that this case is distinguishable because the\n\nsubrogation lien was written into the ERISA plan document itself. This argument ignores\n\nthe plain language of the Ashmore decision, to the effect that, “[e]ven if the parties’ ERISA\n\nplan contained an express subrogation clause, Mississippi law requiring prior chancery court\n\napproval of assignment of a minor’s right to insurance proceeds would not be preempted by\n\nERISA.” Estate of Ashmore v. Healthcare Recoveries, Inc., 1998 WL 211778, at *2 (N.D.\n\nMiss. Mar. 25, 1998). Moreover, it is deaf to the district court’s decision in Copeland, which\n\nheld that, even though the ERISA plan contained an express subrogation clause, the statute\n\nwas not preempted. Copeland, 2001 WL 1524373.\n\n¶40.   The plan further suggests that the precedent from the United States District Court for\n\nthe Northern District of Mississippi is distinguishable because this case is procedurally\n\ndifferent. The procedural posture of a case has no bearing on the issue of preemption.\n\nPreemption exists if Congress “so completely pre-empt[s] a particular area that any civil\n\ncomplaint raising this select group of claims is necessarily federal in character.” Metro. Life\n\nIns. Co. v. Taylor, 481 U.S. 58, 63-64, 107 S. Ct. 1542, 95 L. Ed. 2d 55 (1987). Thus,\n\nwhether Section 93-13-59 encroaches on ERISA is the relevant question in determining\n\nfederal jurisdiction over this case (which the United States District Court for the Northern\n\nDistrict of Mississippi has held it does not have), not the procedural posture of the case.\n\n¶41.   The plan and the dissent argue that preemption with regard to Mississippi Code Section\n\n93-13-59 is an “unresolved issue,” because the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth\n\nCircuit has not yet addressed it. This ignores the manner in which federal appellate courts\n\n\n\n                                              22\n\fexercise jurisdiction over remands for improper removal. Congress has circumscribed the\n\npower of federal appellate courts to review remand orders. See Schexnayder v. Entergy\n\nLouisiana, Inc., 394 F. 3d 280, 283 (5th Cir. 2004). United States Code Section 1447(d)\n\nprovides that “[a]n order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed is\n\nnot reviewable on appeal or otherwise.” 28 U.S.C. § 1447(d). Specifically, an order for\n\nremand is not appealable if it is based on either a defect in removal procedure or because the\n\ndistrict court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction. Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co., 517 U.S.\n\n706, 712, 116 S. Ct. 1712, 135 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1996). Thus, a Fifth Circuit decision on the\n\nmerits of these cases would do nothing to clarify the law any further, because that court has\n\nno jurisdiction over the remand and cannot render a decision on the merits. In the unlikely\n\nevent that such a decision were rendered, it would be a nullity, utterly deprived of precedential\n\nvalue. The dissent avers that “when a district court exercises jurisdiction over a case, the\n\njurisdictional question could be raised on appeal.” This is the very reason a Fifth Circuit\n\ndecision would never come about: no district court has exercised jurisdiction over these cases\n\nbefore remanding them to state court. The United States District Court for the Northern\n\nDistrict of Mississippi, which is the ultimate authority on improper removals to that court, has\n\nheld repeatedly that this statute is not federally preempted.\n\n¶42.   The dissent opines that the Fifth Circuit’s decision in Arana v. Ochsner Health Plan,\n\n338 F.3d 433 (5th Cir. 2003), created ambiguity regarding whether Section 93-13-59 is\n\npreempted by ERISA. In support, the dissent relies on the Fifth Circuit’s holding that a\n\nLouisiana statute was completely preempted by ERISA. But Arana does not create an\n\n\n\n                                               23\n\farguable basis that Mississippi chancery courts’ approval of minor settlements is preempted.\n\nThe statute at issue in Arana was a Louisiana enactment which sought to regulate directly the\n\nterms and enforceability of ERISA plans. Id. at 436. The statute under consideration in Arana\n\nprovided that:\n\n         Notwithstanding any other provisions in this title to the contrary, no group\n         policy of accident, health or hospitalization insurance, or of any group\n         combination of these coverages, shall be issued by any insurer doing business\n         in this state which by the terms of such policy group contract excludes or\n         reduces the payment of benefits to or on behalf of an insured by reason of the\n         fact that benefits have been paid under any other individually underwritten\n         contract or plan of insurance for the same claim determination period. Any\n         group policy provision in violation of this section shall be invalid.\n\nId. (quoting La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 22:663 (West 1995 & Supp. 2003)) (emphasis added). In\n\nother words, Arana addressed an antisubrogation clause which expressly addressed ERISA\n\nplans. Id. It strains credulity that a Fifth Circuit holding regarding a Louisiana statute that\n\nexplicitly controlled the terms of ERISA plans would call into question whether a Mississippi\n\nstatute protecting the interests of minors is preempted. ERISA preemption of some statutes\n\ndoes not create an arguable issue about whether it preempts all statutes. Just because ERISA\n\npreemption is complex, it does not give lawyers carte blanche to remove cases to federal\n\ncourt.\n\n¶43.     It is clear that Section 93-13-59 does not directly address ERISA plans, that Section\n\n91-13-59 is a domestic relations statute which presumptively is not preempted by federal law,\n\nand that all precedent which governs this case, both from the Northern District of Mississippi\n\nand from the Mississippi Supreme Court, holds that ERISA does not preempt the chancery\n\ncourt’s duty to review minors’ settlements. In the absence of valid contrary or intervening\n\n                                              24\n\fauthority, this area of the law was well settled when the plan undertook removal and had been\n\nfor more than two decades. As such, the Pontotoc County Chancery Court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in determining that Ashley Healthcare Plan’s removal to federal court was\n\nunsubstantiated and contrary to well-established precedent. The chancery court therefore did\n\nnot abuse its discretion in awarding attorney’s fees to the Dillards for Ashley Healthcare\n\nPlan’s frivolous removal of this case to federal court.\n\n                                      CONCLUSION\n\n¶44.   Although the Dillards could have filed a motion for attorney’s fees under Rule 54 in\n\nfederal court, they had the option of filing such a motion in state court under the Litigation\n\nAccountability Act for the plan’s frivolous removal of the case to federal court. Moreover,\n\nbecause the plan pursued a remedy which was not cognizable under the ERISA civil\n\nenforcement statute and because there was clearly established precedent that ERISA did not\n\npreempt a chancery court’s power to settle the claims of minors, we hold that the chancery\n\ncourt did not err by assessing attorney’s fees against the plan, and we therefore affirm the\n\njudgment of the Pontotoc County Chancery Court.\n\n¶45.   AFFIRMED.\n\n     WALLER, C.J., RANDOLPH, P.J., LAMAR, CHANDLER AND KING, JJ.,\nCONCUR. DICKINSON, P.J., DISSENTS WITH SEPARATE WRITTEN OPINION\nJOINED BY PIERCE AND COLEMAN, JJ.\n\n       DICKINSON, PRESIDING JUSTICE, DISSENTING:\n\n¶46.   Today, a majority of this Court approves an $18,180 sanction against an attorney who\n\ndid nothing more than advance a legal theory that clearly was not frivolous, and for which\n\n\n\n                                             25\n\fthere existed no court order preventing him from doing so. Because this remarkable precedent\n\nshould be of grave concern to every practicing lawyer in Mississippi, I wish to record my\n\nstrong dissent.\n\n                         BACKGROUND AND PROCEEDINGS\n\n¶47.   Ashley Furniture Industries, Inc. (“Ashley”) is a Wisconsin corporation that has a\n\nmanufacturing facility in Mississippi. For the benefit of its employees, it has a self-funded\n\nhealthcare plan (the “Plan”) that is administered by Ashley Healthcare Plan. The Plan clearly\n\nis covered by ERISA6 and includes a contractual provision that states: “The Plan is subrogated\n\nto all rights of participants and beneficiaries, including guardians, for the recovery of expenses\n\npaid by the plan on their behalf.” As a result of injuries sustained in an automobile accident,\n\nthe Plan paid benefits on behalf of an Ashley employee’s minor child, who asserted a claim\n\nagainst the tortfeasor who caused the injuries. The Plan asserted its subrogation lien against\n\nany recovery.\n\n¶48.   The child’s parents, the Dillards, agreed to settle the claim with two insurance carriers,\n\nand filed a petition in the chancery court, seeking approval of the settlement and raising the\n\nissue of the Plan’s right of reimbursement. The Plan read this to be an attempt to have the\n\nchancellor declare that state law prevented the Plan from recovering what ERISA allowed it\n\nto recover.\n\n¶49.   Within approximately thirty days of being served with the chancery petition, the Plan’s\n\nlawyers, on behalf of their client—taking the position that ERISA preempts state law—filed\n\n\n\n       6\n           Employment Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. §1001, et seq.\n\n                                               26\n\fa Notice of Removal to federal court, and a notice of the removal with the Chancery Court of\n\nPontotoc County. The Dillards responded by moving the federal court to remand the matter\n\nback to the chancery court, and requesting an award of attorney fees pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n\n§1447, claiming the removal was filed for the “improper purpose of avoiding or delaying the\n\nfinality of the administration of the minor’s estate.”7 Two years later, the federal district court\n\nremanded the matter but failed to award any attorney fees, and the Dillards failed to pursue\n\na post-judgment motion for attorney fees as required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n\n54(d)(2)(A).\n\n¶50.   On remand, the chancellor awarded attorney fees to the Dillards in the amount of\n\n$18,180. As for his reasons, the chancellor adopted in toto “those factors set forth in the\n\n[Dillard’s motion for attorney fees] as the findings of fact by this Court.” The chancellor\n\nstated that “by the exercise of due diligence, they should have ascertained what the law was\n\nas to minor settlements and the jurisdiction of the same in this state, and that’s in the chancery\n\ncourt. They did not.” He further stated:\n\n       [t]he memorandum of authorities filed by Plaintiffs indisputably and succinctly\n       demonstrated the futility of the argument espoused on behalf of Defendants that\n       ERISA preempts a minor’s settlement filed in Chancery Court such that\n       Defendants should have immediately drafted an agreed order remanding this\n       case to the Ponyotoc County Chancery Court.\n\n¶51.   He found that the Plan’s position “directly contradicts prior established caselaw,” and\n\nthat “Plaintiffs were . . . provided numerous cases directly on point which irrefutably held\n\n       7\n        This argument, itself, seems somewhat frivolous, since the Plan would have no\nconceivable reason to “delay” the judgment. Its purpose—which it freely admitted, and\nwhich was entirely proper—was to prevent the chancery court from deciding what it argued\nwas a federal question that properly should be decided by a federal court.\n\n                                                27\n\ftheir basis for removal to be invalid.” The chancellor’s conclusions—to the extent they\n\nsuggested the existence of binding caselaw—were incorrect.\n\n       Lawyers must zealously represent their clients.\n\n¶52.   We admonish lawyers to zealously represent their clients, and we sanction them when\n\nthey fail to follow the Mississippi Rules of Professional Conduct, one of which states:\n\n       A lawyer shall not bring or defend a proceeding, or assert or controvert an issue\n       therein, unless there is a basis in law and in fact for doing so that is not\n       frivolous, which includes a good faith argument for an extension, modification\n       or reversal of existing law.8\n\nThe comment to Rule 3.1 states that lawyers have\n\n       a duty to use legal procedure for the fullest benefit of the client’s cause, but also\n       a duty not to abuse legal procedure. The law, both procedural and substantive,\n       establishes the limits within which an advocate may proceed. However, the law\n       is not always clear and never is static. Accordingly, in determining the proper\n       scope of advocacy, account must be taken of the law’s ambiguities and\n       potential for change.\n\n       The plan’s removal to federal court was not frivolous.\n\n¶53.   Alleging that a lawyer’s claim is frivolous is a serious, pejorative charge that should\n\nnot lightly be made. We should encourage lawyers to challenge and test the limits of the law,\n\nso long as the claim is not patently absurd, that is to say, “so clearly untenable, or the\n\ninsufficiency of which is so manifest upon a bare inspection of the pleadings, that the court\n\nor judge is able to determine its character without argument or research.”9\n\n\n\n\n       8\n           Miss. R. Prof’l Conduct 3.1 (emphasis added).\n       9\n        Jordan v. McAdams, 85 So. 3d 932, 935 (Miss. Ct. App. 2012) (citing Estate of\nSmith v. Smith, 69 So. 3d 1, 6 (Miss. 2011)).\n\n                                                28\n\f¶54.   It certainly cannot credibly be argued that a claim is frivolous merely because it has no\n\nvalidity under established, binding precedent. Were that the case, we still would have\n\nsegregated schools,10 discriminatory jury selection,11 and pro se indigent criminal defendants.12\n\n       ERISA preemption under the circumstances of this case has not been decided.\n\n¶55.   The chancellor’s decision to award attorney fees rested on three decisions of the United\n\nStates District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi,13 and two decisions of this\n\nCourt,14 which hold that ERISA does not preempt Mississippi law governing minors’\n\nsettlements, precluding removal to federal court. But contrary to the chancellor’s finding,\n\nneither federal district court decisions nor decisions from this Court are binding precedent on\n\nfederal questions. And there are no decisions on point from the Fifth Circuit or the United\n\nStates Supreme Court. It is unacceptable to me for this Court to suggest that a lawyer should\n\nrefrain from submitting an unsettled question of federal law to a federal court, simply because\n\nthis Court or a federal district court previously has taken a position on the issue.\n\n\n\n\n       10\n         See Brown v. Bd. of Educ. of Topeka, Shawnee Cnty., Kan., 347 U.S. 483, 74 S.\nCt. 686, 98 L. Ed. 873 (1954).\n       11\n            See Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 106 S. Ct. 1712, 90 L.

Further, the Plan argues that not even the Mississippi federal district courts have\n\ndecided the precise question presented by the facts of this case because this case involved the\n\nfactual question of whether the Dillards had asked the chancellor to declare that the Plan had\n\nno right to any proceeds of the settlement.15 Moreover, at least one federal court of appeals\n\nand one federal district court have found complete ERISA preemption under similar\n\ncircumstances.16 So clearly, there is no established precedent on the preemption question.\n\nAnd even if there were, asserting a claim that is contrary to an established point of law is not\n\nipso facto frivolous.\n\n¶57.   Stated another way, the fundamental flaw in both the chancellor’s decision to award\n\nattorney fees, and the majority’s decision to affirm, is that both view this case as if the Plan\n\nadvanced an unreasonable argument in the face of settled law. The law is not settled. There\n\nis no established binding precedent on the preemption question. And even if there were,\n\nasserting a claim that is contrary to an established point of law is not ipso facto frivolous.\n\n¶58.   The majority suggests that a federal appellate court could never issue an opinion on the\n\nmerits of this issue because federal law precludes any appeal of a district court’s decision to\n\nremand a case back to state court. But the majority fails to consider that when a district court\n\n\n\n\n       15\n        See Copeland, 2001 WL 1524373; Estate of Ashmore, 1998 WL 211778; Clardy,\n921 F. Supp. 394.\n       16\n       See Arana v. Ochsner Health Plan, 338 F.3d 433 (5th Cir. 2003); Reinhart Cos.\nEmp. Benefit Plan v. Vial, 2011 WL 976505, *11 (W.D. Mich. Mar. 17, 2011).\n\n                                              30\n\fexercises jurisdiction over a case, the jurisdictional question could be raised on appeal.17 And\n\nuntil that happens, no binding precedent exists.\n\n¶59.   Further, the Plan’s preemption argument is not patently unreasonable. In Arana v.\n\nOschner Health Plan, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that\n\nERISA preempted an action in “state court to obtain a declaration that he is entitled to retain\n\ntort settlement proceeds free of Ochsner Health Plan, Inc.’s claim for reimbursement of health\n\ncare benefits previously paid for Arana’s account . . . .”18 The Plan cited this case to support\n\nremoval, arguing that the Dillards’ petition not only asked the chancellor to approve a $75,000\n\nsettlement, but also to declare that the Plan had no right to recover any portion of the\n\nsettlement as reimbursement for medical expenses it had paid.\n\n¶60.   Ultimately, the district judge distinguished Arana in her memorandum opinion by\n\nfinding that the Dillards’ request in its pleading to prevent the Plan from recovering was not\n\na request for a declaratory ruling on the Plan’s right to recover a portion of the settlement, and\n\nthat the Dillards had merely provided the chancellor notice that the Plan may have a claim\n\nagainst the settlement.\n\n¶61.   While the district judge’s view of the meaning of the prayer for relief may or may not\n\nbe correct, I must conclude that the Plan’s attorneys were not unreasonable—and certainly not\n\nfrivolous—in asserting that the Fifth Circuit’s decision in Arana—which was handed down\n\nafter the Northern District opinions on this issue—provided support for removal. Given the\n\n\n\n       17\n            See Arana, 338 F.3d 433.\n       18\n            Id. at 434.\n\n                                               31\n\flawyer’s duty zealously to advance the interests of the client, I must disagree with the\n\nmajority’s view; I do not at all find unreasonable the Plan’s argument that it was defending\n\nthe action for a declaratory judgment that would have affected—and ultimately did affect—its\n\nright to recover, rather than “pursuing a remedy, and thus a cause of action, that was\n\nunavailable to it under federal law.”\n\n¶62.   A careful distinction between cases and the debatable meaning of a prayer for relief\n\nin a pleading do not render the Plan’s removal frivolous. We should not deter attorneys from\n\nadvancing nonfrivolous legal arguments, however thin or doomed they may seem to some.\n\n¶63.    To the contrary, we should encourage lawyers to challenge the law to its very limits\n\nin zealously representing the interests of their clients.\n\n                                        CONCLUSION\n\n¶64.   Today, the majority substantially lowers the threshold for a frivolous claim, and I\n\nbelieve that is not a good thing for the interests of clients or for the practice of law. I fear\n\ntoday’s decision will serve to chill the spirit of trial lawyers whose duty to their clients often\n\nrequires them zealously to advance aggressive and sometimes unpopular positions and\n\narguments. Accordingly, and with the highest respect for the members of the majority, I\n\ndissent.\n\n       PIERCE AND COLEMAN, JJ., JOIN THIS OPINION.\n\n\n\n\n                                               32\n\f",

O.D., a minor child, filed a petition in Pontotoc County Chancery Court for approval\n\nof a settlement her parents had negotiated with car insurance companies for injuries she had\n\nsuffered in a car accident. On the day of the hearing, Ashley Healthcare Plan, O.D.’s health\n\ninsurance coverage provider, which had a subrogation lien against the proceeds of O.D.’s\n\nclaim, removed the case to federal court, arguing that the Mississippi law which required the\n\fchancery court’s approval of O.D.’s settlement claims, Mississippi Code Section 93-13-59,\n\nwas preempted by the federal Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974\n\n(“ERISA”). The United States District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi held\n\nthat ERISA did not preempt the state law and remanded the case to the chancery court\n\nwithout awarding attorney’s fees to O.D. On motion from O.D.’s parents, the Pontotoc\n\nCounty Chancery Court awarded O.D. attorney’s fees, holding that Ashley Healthcare Plan’s\n\nremoval to federal court was contrary to clearly established law and that it was done for the\n\npurpose of delaying litigation. Although O.D. could have sought recovery of attorney’s fees\n\nunder Rule 54 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, frivolous removals to federal court\n\nalso are subject to the Mississippi Litigation Accountability Act. Miss. Code Ann. §§ 11-55-1\n\nto 11-51-15 (Rev. 2012). Furthermore, Ashley Healthcare Plan’s removal to federal court\n\nwas contrary to two decades of case law which uniformly held that Mississippi’s law\n\nrequiring chancery court approval of minors’ settlements is not preempted by ERISA and that\n\nAshley Healthcare Plan was seeking a remedy in federal court that was unavailable to it\n\nunder the ERISA Civil Enforcement Clause. We therefore affirm the judgment of the\n\nchancery court because its award of attorney’s fees on this basis was not an abuse of\n\ndiscretion.\n\n                       FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n¶2.    On March 6, 2011, Mercedes Navarette failed to yield the right-of-way to oncoming\n\ntraffic on Highway 278 in Pontotoc County and struck a car driven by Kimberly Dillard.\n\nDillard’s three-year-old daughter, O.D., was in the back seat. As a result of the collision,\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\fO.D. suffered significant injuries. Her right leg was fractured, and she had bruises on her\n\nface, scalp, neck, and thigh. O.D. was airlifted to Le Bonheur Children’s Hospital in\n\nMemphis. For the treatment of her leg, O.D. spent three nights in the hospital and had two\n\nseparate surgeries.\n\n¶3.    Later that summer, on August 21, 2011, O.D.’s parents, Kimberly Dillard and Michael\n\nDillard, petitioned the Pontotoc County Chancery Court for appointment as O.D.’s general\n\nguardians.1 The Chancery Court granted that petition. The purpose of the Dillards’\n\nguardianship over O.D. was to pursue a claim for the child’s personal injuries and medical\n\ncare. As the court-appointed general guardians for O.D., the Dillards engaged in settlement\n\nnegotiations with Allstate Insurance Company, Navarette’s insurance carrier. The Dillards\n\nsubmitted, for the Pontotoc County Chancery Court’s approval, a compromise settlement of\n\n$25,000, Naverette’s liability insurance policy’s maximum limit of applicable coverage. The\n\nDillards also made an uninsured/underinsured claim against their own automobile insurance\n\ncarrier, State Farm Insurance Company. The Dillards obtained a settlement offer from State\n\nFarm for $50,000, its policy limit.\n\n\n\n\n       1\n        The natural parents of a minor are the child’s natural guardians, and they are\nresponsible for the care, maintenance, and education of their child/ward. Miss. Code Ann.\n§ 93-13-1 (Rev. 2013). The chancery court, however, is empowered to appoint general\nguardians (i.e., legal) to represent the legal interests of the minor. Miss. Code Ann. § 93-13-\n15 (Rev. 2013).\n\n                                              3\n\f¶4.    In accordance with Mississippi law regarding minors’ legal settlements,2 on October\n\n13, 2011, the Dillards filed a Petition for Authority to Settle and Compromise Doubtful\n\nClaim of Minor. The Dillards sought approval from the Pontotoc County Chancery Court\n\nof the settlement of O.D.’s claims against both State Farm Insurance and Allstate Insurance\n\nfor a total of $75,000, which was all of the available liability insurance coverage.\n\n¶5.        In addition to informing the chancery court of the settlement offers, the petition\n\naverred that Ashley Furniture Industries maintained an employer-funded healthcare plan and\n\nthat the plan was established under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974\n\n(ERISA). Because O.D. was a minor child and dependent of her father, Michael Dillard, an\n\nemployee of Ashley Furniture Industries at its Ecru factory, O.D. was a covered beneficiary\n\nof the plan. During the course of O.D.’s car-wreck-related medical treatment, the Ashley\n\nHealthcare Plan (“the plan”) had paid $33,683.58 toward O.D.’s medical bills. The plan\n\npreviously had asserted its intention to enforce a subrogation lien, contained within the\n\nlanguage of the plan, for the amount of all of O.D.’s medical bills against all sums O.D.\n\nmight receive from the automobile insurance companies. The Dillards requested of the\n\nchancery court that the car insurance settlement proceeds be distributed for the minor’s\n\n\n\n       2\n       Miss. Code Ann. § 93-13-59 (Rev. 2013):\n\n       Guardians may be empowered by the court, or chancellor in vacation, to sell\n       or compromise claims due their wards, on the same proceedings and under the\n       same circumstances prescribed in reference to the sale or compromise by an\n       executor or administrator of claims belonging to the estate of a deceased\n       person. And the guardian in such case is authorized to receive in satisfaction\n       of claims, when to the interest of the ward, property, real or personal, the title\n       to be taken in the name of the ward.\n\n                                               4\n\fexclusive benefit, i.e., paid to the minor. To this end, the Dillards also sought denial of\n\nreimbursement to the plan for the medical expenses paid on her behalf on account of the\n\naccident .\n\n¶6.    On October 14, 2011, the Dillards served on the plan a summons under Rule 81 of the\n\nMississippi Rules of Civil Procedure, along with their Petition for Authority to Settle and\n\nCompromise Doubtful Claim of Minor. The summons directed Ashley Healthcare Plan to\n\nappear at a hearing at 9:30 a.m. on November 14, 2011, at the Pontotoc County Chancery\n\nCourt to assert its claimed subrogation lien against O.D.’s settlement.\n\n¶7.    On November 14, 2011, the day that the Pontotoc County Chancery Court was to\n\nconduct the hearing on settlement of O.D.’s insurance claims, the plan removed the case to\n\nthe United States District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi, asserting that O.D.’s\n\n“claim against [Ashley Healthcare Plan] falls within the scope of ERISA’s civil enforcement\n\nstatute . . . and is completely preempted and is therefore removable.”\n\n¶8.    On November 17, 2011, the Dillards filed a Motion to Remand the case, arguing that\n\nthe United States District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi has “held that the\n\nEmployment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (‘ERISA’) does not preempt\n\nMississippi law, which requires chancery court approval for the administration of a minor’s\n\nestate. Therefore this case must be remanded to state court for lack of subject matter\n\njurisdiction.” The Dillards further alleged that “this case was removed for the improper\n\npurpose of avoiding or delaying the finality of the administration of the minor’s estate\n\ncurrently pending in the Chancery Court of Pontotoc County, Mississippi.” The Dillards also\n\n\n\n                                               5\n\fmoved under 28 U.S.C. § 1447 for attorney’s fees incurred by them as a result of Ashley’s\n\nremoval of the case to federal court.\n\n¶9.    On December 12, 2011, the plan filed a Response to the Dillards’ Motion to Remand,\n\narguing that “[t]he only question before the Court is whether or not Plaintiffs’ well-pleaded\n\ncomplaint filed in state court raises a claim within the federal subject matter jurisdiction of\n\nthis Court.” Again, the plan averred that O.D.’s claim in chancery court fell squarely within\n\nERISA’s enforcement provisions and that her claims were completely preempted by federal\n\nlaw.\n\n¶10.   Nearly two years after the plan had removed the case to federal court, on September\n\n27, 2013, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi remanded\n\nthe case to Pontotoc County Chancery Court. The Memorandum Opinion held that “the\n\nadministration of a minor’s estate is entirely a matter of state law, and is law of general\n\napplication which affects a broad range of matters entirely unrelated to ERISA.” The district\n\ncourt held that the Dillards’ claim for approval of the minor’s settlement was not preempted\n\nby ERISA and found that Ashley Healthcare Plan’s claim for reimbursement did not\n\nconstitute a cognizable claim under the ERISA civil enforcement statute. Although the\n\nDillards had asserted a claim for attorney’s fees incurred during the course of the remand\n\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1447, they did not renew their request for fees by filing a Federal\n\nRule of Civil Procedure 54(d) motion in federal court.\n\n¶11.   Instead, on October 29, 2013, the Dillards filed a motion for attorney’s fees under the\n\nMississippi Litigation Accountability Act of 1988 (Miss. Code Ann. §§ 11-55-1 to 11-51-15\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\f(Rev. 2012)) in Pontotoc County Chancery Court, arguing that the plan’s removal of O.D.’s\n\ncase to federal district court had been “frivolous, filed for the purpose of harassment and\n\ndelay, and did not have support in law or fact.”\n\n¶12.   On December 4, 2013, the chancery court conducted a hearing to address the Dillards’\n\nmotion for attorney’s fees and to settle O.D.’s insurance claims. During the course of the\n\nhearing, the chancery court allowed O.D.’s parents, as her general guardians, to settle her\n\nclaims with both automobile insurers for $75,000. The chancery court also refused to\n\nenforce the plan’s subrogation lien; the plan was not reimbursed for the moneys it had paid\n\nfor O.D.’s accident-related health care.\n\n¶13.   On February 6, 2014, the chancery court awarded attorney’s fees to the Dillards in\n\naccordance with the Litigation Accountability Act for Ashley Healthcare Plan’s improper\n\nremoval of the case to federal court. In his thirteen-page written order, the chancellor\n\nreasoned that the issue of attorney’s fees was properly before the court because “there was\n\nno determination made by the federal court concerning attorney’s fees nor was the issue of\n\nattorney’s fees considered by the federal court.” The court further held that “[t]he only\n\npurpose for removal of the minor’s settlement . . . was for Defendants to engage in forum\n\nshopping and delay the final outcome of this matter.” The court found that “[d]efendants,\n\nfollowing commencement of their removal of a minor’s settlement to federal court, failed to\n\nmake any effort to dismiss their removal action after being provided numerous cases directly\n\non point which irrefutably held that their basis for removal was invalid.” After discussing\n\n\n\n\n                                             7\n\fthe factors outlined in the Litigation Accountability Act, the chancery court awarded the\n\nDillards $18,180 in attorney’s fees.\n\n¶14.    Ashley Healthcare Plan now appeals the award of attorney’s fees. There are two\n\nissues before this Court: (1) whether the Litigation Accountability Act enables Mississippi\n\ncourts to sanction litigants for frivolous removals and (2) whether the Pontotoc County\n\nChancery Court abused its discretion in holding that Ashley Healthcare Plan frivolously\n\nremoved this case to federal court.\n\n                                       DISCUSSION\n\n       I. Does the Litigation Accountability Act enable Mississippi courts to\n       sanction litigants for frivolous removals?\n\n¶15.   Whether a chancery court is allowed to award attorney’s fees under the Litigation\n\nAccountability Act for a frivolous removal to federal court is a matter of first impression\n\nbefore this Court. When the imposition of attorney’s fees raises a question of law, the\n\nstandard of review is de novo. See Amiker v. Drugs for Less, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">796</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">942</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 945-46\n\n(Miss. 2001).\n\n¶16.   It is undisputed that, in their Motion for Remand, the Dillards claimed they were\n\nentitled to attorney’s fees under 28 U.S.C. § 1447 because Ashley Healthcare Plan’s removal\n\nto federal court was frivolous. But the Dillards never pursued a motion for attorney’s fees\n\nunder Rule 54 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the proper means for obtaining fees\n\nin federal courts. According to the plan, the only means of recovery for the frivolous removal\n\nof a case to federal court is filing a motion for attorney’s fees and costs under Rule 54 of the\n\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure. Thus, the plan argues that, because the Dillards did not file\n\n\n                                               8\n\fa Rule 54 motion in federal court, they are precluded from filing a motion for attorney’s fees\n\nin Mississippi state court under the Litigation Accountability Act.\n\n¶17.   Whether the Dillards could or should have pursued attorney’s fees in federal court is\n\nirrelevant. The relevant inquiry here is whether the Dillards could pursue attorney’s fees in\n\nchancery court under the Litigation Accountability Act for the plan’s frivolous removal. The\n\nLitigation Accountability Act provides in pertinent part:\n\n       [I]n any civil action commenced or appealed in any court of record in this\n       state, the court shall award, as part of its judgment and in addition to any other\n       costs otherwise assessed, reasonable attorney’s fees and costs against any party\n       or attorney if the court, upon the motion of any party or on its own motion,\n       finds that an attorney or party brought an action, or asserted any claim or\n       defense, that is without substantial justification, or that the action, or any claim\n       or defense asserted, was interposed for delay or harassment, or if it finds that\n       an attorney or party unnecessarily expanded the proceedings by other improper\n       conduct . . . .\n\nMiss. Code Ann. § 11-55-5(1) (Rev. 2012). The statute contains no express language which\n\nprohibits a judge’s imposition of attorney’s fees for frivolous removals to federal court. In\n\nfact, insofar as a party must file a notice of removal in state court in order to remove the case\n\nto federal court, and assuming the removal to have been frivolous, this would fall squarely\n\nwithin the parameters of the statute, which enables Mississippi judges to levy fees against\n\nparties who “asserted any claim or defense . . . that is without substantial justification,” who\n\n“asserted . . . any claim or defense . . . for delay or harassment,” or “who unnecessarily\n\nexpanded the proceedings by other improper conduct.” The fact is that removal has a\n\ntremendous impact on the chancery court’s (or any other state court’s) ability to adjudicate\n\na case in a timely manner in that removal completely deprives the state court of jurisdiction\n\n\n\n                                                9\n\fover the matter. See Allman v. Hanley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"257050\"><a href=\"/opinion/257050/george-g-allman-v-w-h-hanley/\"><span class=\"volume\">302</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">559</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 562 (5th Cir. 1962) (“Upon the filing\n\nof a proper petition for removal and upon compliance with the applicable statutes, the state\n\ncourt loses jurisdiction and all further process must issue from the Federal court.” ) (citing\n\n28 U.S.C. §§ 1446(e), 1447(a); F.R.C.P 81(c).

Courts from other states have addressed the levy of attorney’s fees against parties for\n\nfrivolous removal of state court cases to federal court. For example, in Ex Parte Bon\n\nSecours-St. Francis Xavier Hosp., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">713</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">624</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (S.C. 2011), the South Carolina\n\nSupreme Court considered the trial court’s imposition of sanctions and attorney’s fees for a\n\nfrivolous removal action pursuant to Rule 11 of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\nIn Bon Secours, the party improperly removed a case to federal district court twice, the\n\nsecond time just hours before trial was to commence.

Ashley Healthcare Plan argues on appeal that its removal of O.D.’s settlement to\n\nfederal court was not without substantial justification and that the chancery court therefore\n\nerred by awarding the Dillards attorney’s fees. The Dillards respond that the plan’s removal\n\n                                              11\n\fto federal court was contrary to clearly established law and that attorney’s fees were awarded\n\non the basis of the plan’s improper removal and the plan’s failure to meet court deadlines.\n\nThe record makes clear, however, that the chancery court did not consider anything other\n\nthan the improper removal to federal court in deciding to award attorney’s fees.\n\n       A. Did the Pontotoc County Chancery Court abuse its discretion in\n       determining that Ashley Healthcare Plan removed this case to federal\n       court without substantial justification?\n\n¶22.   In relevant part, the Mississippi Litigation Accountability Act provides:\n\n       In any civil action commenced or appealed in any court of record in this state,\n       the court shall award . . . reasonable attorney’s fees and costs against any party\n       or attorney if the court, upon the motion of any party or on its own motion,\n       finds that an attorney or party brought an action . . . that is without substantial\n       justification, or that the action, or any claim or defense asserted, was\n       interposed for delay or harassment . . . .\n\nMiss. Code Ann. § 11-55-5(1) (Rev. 2012).3 The Act defines a claim brought “without\n\nsubstantial justification” to be one that is “frivolous, groundless in fact or in law, or\n\nvexatious, as determined by the court.” Miss. Code Ann. § 11-55-3(a) (Rev. 2012). This\n\nCourt applies the same test to determine whether a filing is frivolous under both Rule 11 and\n\n\n\n       3\n           The plan also directs us to Mississippi Code Section 11-55-5(4):\n\n       No party, except an attorney licensed to practice law in this state, who is\n       appearing without an attorney shall be assessed attorney’s fees unless the court\n       finds that the party clearly knew or reasonably should have known that such\n       party’s action, claim or defense or any part of it was without substantial\n       justification.\n\nThis provision applies only to pro se litigants and should not affect the Court’s analysis in\nthis case.\n\n                                               12\n\fthe Act. A claim is frivolous when, “objectively speaking, the pleader or movant has no hope\n\nof success.” Leaf River Forest Prods., Inc. v.

The Pontotoc County Chancery Court, in a thirteen-page order, justified its award of\n\nattorney’s fees under the Litigation Accountability Act. The court held that “the actions of\n\nthe Ashley Healthcare Plan in delaying the minor settlement along with their failure to\n\nascertain the law and jurisdiction as to minor’s settlements demonstrates an award against\n\nthe Ashley Healthcare Plan under the Litigation Accountability Act is proper.”             The\n\nchancery court further reasoned that the plan had represented to the federal court that:\n\n       [A]lthough there was no written subrogation agreement with the Plaintiffs, any\n       decision by the chancellor concerning the minor’s rights to settlement proceeds\n       was within the exclusive jurisdiction of federal courts. This statement . . .\n       directly contradicts prior established case law that ERISA does not preempt\n       Mississippi law requiring chancery court approval of minor’s settlements.\n\nThe chancery court held that Ashley Healthcare Plan “failed to make any effort to dismiss\n\ntheir removal action after being provided numerous cases directly on point which irrefutably\n\nheld their basis of removal was invalid.” The chancery court noted that the relief sought by\n\nthe plan was not allowed by ERISA’s Civil Enforcement Provision. Finally, the chancery\n\ncourt found that “[t]he only purpose for removal of the minor’s settlement from the Chancery\n\nCourt of Pontotoc County, Mississippi to the United States District Court for the Northern\n\nDistrict of Mississippi was for Defendants to engage in forum shopping and delay the final\n\noutcome of this matter.”\n\n\n\n\n                                             13\n\f¶24.   Because the chancery court’s award of attorney’s fees is inextricably intertwined with\n\nits determination that it was clearly established that the chancery court’s statutory duty to\n\napprove the settlement of O.D.’s liability insurance claims was not preempted by ERISA,\n\nwe proceed to address the merits of the plan’s ERISA arguments.\n\n       B. Was the remedy Ashley Healthcare Plan sought in federal court\n       available under ERISA’s enforcement provision?\n\n¶25.   On appeal, the plan asserts that it was seeking a declaratory judgment in federal court\n\nconcerning interpretation of the plan document itself. This, however, is not how the United\n\nStates District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi characterized the plan’s notice\n\nof removal. Instead, that court interpreted the plan’s claim to be one for “reimbursement.”\n\nIn essence, the plan was seeking enforcement of its subrogation clause in federal court.\n\n¶26.   The Civil Enforcement Provision of ERISA, Section 502(a), the provision under\n\nwhich the plan was seeking relief in federal court, states:\n\n       A civil action may be brought—(1) by a participant or beneficiary . . .\n\n       (B) to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan, to enforce his\n       rights under the terms of the plan, or to clarify his rights to future benefits\n       under the terms of the plan . . . .\n\n29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(1)(B).\n\n¶27.

Griffin, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">723</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">518</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Cir. 2013), the en banc Fifth Circuit overruled Copeland and held that failure\nto state a cognizable claim under the ERISA Enforcement Provision did not inherently\ndeprive federal courts of subject-matter jurisdiction.\n\n                                              15\n\fERISA. Id. at 443-45. Indeed, the Fifth Circuit, in comparing the Copeland case to the\n\nUnited States Supreme Court case Knudson noted the following:\n\n       Both cases involve ERISA-governed employee benefit plans that include\n       reimbursement provisions allowing the plans to recover from any settlement\n       proceeds any amount the plans advanced for medical expenses resulting from\n       third party wrong-doing. Third-party tortfeasors injured the plan beneficiaries\n       in both cases, and the plans advanced funds to the beneficiaries for medical\n       expenses. In both cases, the plan beneficiaries made tort settlements with\n       third-party tortfeasors following suit in state court. In both, the plan\n       administrator or assignee filed suit in the federal district court seeking\n       declaratory relief that it was entitled to repayment of the benefits it had\n       conferred. In the instant case, the settlement proceeds are in the registry of the\n       Mississippi Chancery Court. In [Knudson], the proceeds of the settlement\n       were placed in a private Special Needs Trust outside the possession and\n       control of the plan beneficiary.\n\nCopeland, 292 F.3d at 445.\n\n¶29.   It is therefore clear that, in the light of the United States Supreme Court’s decision in\n\nKnudson and the Fifth Circuit’s corresponding decision in Copeland, Ashley was seeking\n\na remedy in federal court that did not exist under the ERISA Enforcement Provision. By\n\nremoving the case to federal court, the plan failed to state a claim that was cognizable under\n\nfederal law.\n\n¶30.   The dissent fails to acknowledge that Ashley was pursuing a remedy, and thus a cause\n\nof action, that was unavailable to it under federal law. Thus, when the dissent bemoans that\n\nAshley’s attorneys“did nothing more than advance a legal theory,” it stops short of holding\n\nAshley’s lawyers responsible for minimal legal research and diligence. Dissent ¶ 46.\n\nBecause United States Supreme Court and Fifth Circuit precedents explicitly foreclose\n\nAshley from seeking damages in federal court under the ERISA enforcement provision, it\n\n\n\n                                              16\n\fis well established that, even if a legitimate argument could credibly be made that Mississippi\n\nCode Section 93-13-59 was preempted by ERISA, Ashley’s removal immediately would\n\nhave been dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Thus,\n\nif considered on the merits, the plan’s removal would be subject to summary dismissal under\n\nRule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. This supports the chancellor’s\n\nfinding, which we subject to a review for an abuse of discretion, that Ashley Healthcare Plan\n\nfrivolously removed this case to federal court.\n\n       C. Was it well established that ERISA does not preempt Mississippi Code\n       Section 93-13-59, the Mississippi law requiring chancery court approval\n       of minors’ claims and settlements?\n\n¶31.   At this point, the debate is settled that the district court unequivocally did not have\n\nsubject-matter jurisdiction over this case. Thus, the only issue in contention is whether\n\nAshley Healthcare Plan removed this case contrary to settled law.\n\n¶32.   The federal removal statute authorizes removal to federal court of a civil action filed\n\nin state court if the claim is one “arising under” federal law or if there is diversity jurisdiction\n\nand the defendant is not a citizen of the state where the action is brought.5 See 28 U.S.C. §\n\n1441(b) (2000). As the United States Supreme Court has explained:\n\n       To determine whether the claim arises under federal law, we examine the “well\n       pleaded” allegations of the complaint and ignore potential defenses: A suit\n       arises under the Constitution and the laws of the United States only when the\n       plaintiff’s statement of his own cause of action shows that it is based upon\n       those laws or that Constitution. It is not enough that the plaintiff alleges some\n       anticipated defense to his cause of action and asserts that the defense is\n       invalidated by some provision of the Constitution of the United States. As a\n\n       5\n          Here, O.D.’s tort claims were the “mainspring” of the case. There was no\naffirmatively alleged federal claim which gave rise to federal jurisdiction.\n\n                                                17\n\f       general rule, absent diversity jurisdiction, a case will not be removable if the\n       complaint does not affirmatively allege a federal claim.\n\nBeneficial Nat’l Bank v.

Thus,\n\nwhether Section 93-13-59 encroaches on ERISA is the relevant question in determining\n\nfederal jurisdiction over this case (which the United States District Court for the Northern\n\nDistrict of Mississippi has held it does not have), not the procedural posture of the case.\n\n¶41.   The plan and the dissent argue that preemption with regard to Mississippi Code Section\n\n93-13-59 is an “unresolved issue,” because the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth\n\nCircuit has not yet addressed it. This ignores the manner in which federal appellate courts\n\n\n\n                                              22\n\fexercise jurisdiction over remands for improper removal.

Thus, a Fifth Circuit decision on the\n\nmerits of these cases would do nothing to clarify the law any further, because that court has\n\nno jurisdiction over the remand and cannot render a decision on the merits. In the unlikely\n\nevent that such a decision were rendered, it would be a nullity, utterly deprived of precedential\n\nvalue. The dissent avers that “when a district court exercises jurisdiction over a case, the\n\njurisdictional question could be raised on appeal.” This is the very reason a Fifth Circuit\n\ndecision would never come about: no district court has exercised jurisdiction over these cases\n\nbefore remanding them to state court. The United States District Court for the Northern\n\nDistrict of Mississippi, which is the ultimate authority on improper removals to that court, has\n\nheld repeatedly that this statute is not federally preempted.\n\n¶42.   The dissent opines that the Fifth Circuit’s decision in Arana v. Ochsner Health Plan,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">338</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">433</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Cir. 2003), created ambiguity regarding whether Section 93-13-59 is\n\npreempted by ERISA. In support, the dissent relies on the Fifth Circuit’s holding that a\n\nLouisiana statute was completely preempted by ERISA. But Arana does not create an\n\n\n\n                                               23\n\farguable basis that Mississippi chancery courts’ approval of minor settlements is preempted.\n\nThe statute at issue in Arana was a Louisiana enactment which sought to regulate directly the\n\nterms and enforceability of ERISA plans. Id. at 436. The statute under consideration in Arana\n\nprovided that:\n\n         Notwithstanding any other provisions in this title to the contrary, no group\n         policy of accident, health or hospitalization insurance, or of any group\n         combination of these coverages, shall be issued by any insurer doing business\n         in this state which by the terms of such policy group contract excludes or\n         reduces the payment of benefits to or on behalf of an insured by reason of the\n         fact that benefits have been paid under any other individually underwritten\n         contract or plan of insurance for the same claim determination period. Any\n         group policy provision in violation of this section shall be invalid.\n\nId. (quoting La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 22:663 (West 1995 & Supp. 2003)) (emphasis added). In\n\nother words, Arana addressed an antisubrogation clause which expressly addressed ERISA\n\nplans. Id. It strains credulity that a Fifth Circuit holding regarding a Louisiana statute that\n\nexplicitly controlled the terms of ERISA plans would call into question whether a Mississippi\n\nstatute protecting the interests of minors is preempted. ERISA preemption of some statutes\n\ndoes not create an arguable issue about whether it preempts all statutes. Just because ERISA\n\npreemption is complex, it does not give lawyers carte blanche to remove cases to federal\n\ncourt.\n\n¶43.     It is clear that Section 93-13-59 does not directly address ERISA plans, that Section\n\n91-13-59 is a domestic relations statute which presumptively is not preempted by federal law,\n\nand that all precedent which governs this case, both from the Northern District of Mississippi\n\nand from the Mississippi Supreme Court, holds that ERISA does not preempt the chancery\n\ncourt’s duty to review minors’ settlements. In the absence of valid contrary or intervening\n\n                                              24\n\fauthority, this area of the law was well settled when the plan undertook removal and had been\n\nfor more than two decades. As such, the Pontotoc County Chancery Court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in determining that Ashley Healthcare Plan’s removal to federal court was\n\nunsubstantiated and contrary to well-established precedent. The chancery court therefore did\n\nnot abuse its discretion in awarding attorney’s fees to the Dillards for Ashley Healthcare\n\nPlan’s frivolous removal of this case to federal court.\n\n                                      CONCLUSION\n\n¶44.   Although the Dillards could have filed a motion for attorney’s fees under Rule 54 in\n\nfederal court, they had the option of filing such a motion in state court under the Litigation\n\nAccountability Act for the plan’s frivolous removal of the case to federal court. Moreover,\n\nbecause the plan pursued a remedy which was not cognizable under the ERISA civil\n\nenforcement statute and because there was clearly established precedent that ERISA did not\n\npreempt a chancery court’s power to settle the claims of minors, we hold that the chancery\n\ncourt did not err by assessing attorney’s fees against the plan, and we therefore affirm the\n\njudgment of the Pontotoc County Chancery Court.\n\n¶45.

DICKINSON, P.J., DISSENTS WITH SEPARATE WRITTEN OPINION\nJOINED BY PIERCE AND COLEMAN, JJ.\n\n       DICKINSON, PRESIDING JUSTICE, DISSENTING:\n\n¶46.   Today, a majority of this Court approves an $18,180 sanction against an attorney who\n\ndid nothing more than advance a legal theory that clearly was not frivolous, and for which\n\n\n\n                                             25\n\fthere existed no court order preventing him from doing so. Because this remarkable precedent\n\nshould be of grave concern to every practicing lawyer in Mississippi, I wish to record my\n\nstrong dissent.\n\n                         BACKGROUND AND PROCEEDINGS\n\n¶47.   Ashley Furniture Industries, Inc. (“Ashley”) is a Wisconsin corporation that has a\n\nmanufacturing facility in Mississippi. For the benefit of its employees, it has a self-funded\n\nhealthcare plan (the “Plan”) that is administered by Ashley Healthcare Plan. The Plan clearly\n\nis covered by ERISA6 and includes a contractual provision that states: “The Plan is subrogated\n\nto all rights of participants and beneficiaries, including guardians, for the recovery of expenses\n\npaid by the plan on their behalf.” As a result of injuries sustained in an automobile accident,\n\nthe Plan paid benefits on behalf of an Ashley employee’s minor child, who asserted a claim\n\nagainst the tortfeasor who caused the injuries. The Plan asserted its subrogation lien against\n\nany recovery.\n\n¶48.   The child’s parents, the Dillards, agreed to settle the claim with two insurance carriers,\n\nand filed a petition in the chancery court, seeking approval of the settlement and raising the\n\nissue of the Plan’s right of reimbursement. The Plan read this to be an attempt to have the\n\nchancellor declare that state law prevented the Plan from recovering what ERISA allowed it\n\nto recover.\n\n¶49.   Within approximately thirty days of being served with the chancery petition, the Plan’s\n\nlawyers, on behalf of their client—taking the position that ERISA preempts state law—filed\n\n\n\n       6\n           Employment Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. §1001, et seq.\n\n                                               26\n\fa Notice of Removal to federal court, and a notice of the removal with the Chancery Court of\n\nPontotoc County. The Dillards responded by moving the federal court to remand the matter\n\nback to the chancery court, and requesting an award of attorney fees pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n\n§1447, claiming the removal was filed for the “improper purpose of avoiding or delaying the\n\nfinality of the administration of the minor’s estate.”7 Two years later, the federal district court\n\nremanded the matter but failed to award any attorney fees, and the Dillards failed to pursue\n\na post-judgment motion for attorney fees as required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n\n54(d)(2)(A).\n\n¶50.   On remand, the chancellor awarded attorney fees to the Dillards in the amount of\n\n$18,180. As for his reasons, the chancellor adopted in toto “those factors set forth in the\n\n[Dillard’s motion for attorney fees] as the findings of fact by this Court.” The chancellor\n\nstated that “by the exercise of due diligence, they should have ascertained what the law was\n\nas to minor settlements and the jurisdiction of the same in this state, and that’s in the chancery\n\ncourt. They did not.” He further stated:\n\n       [t]he memorandum of authorities filed by Plaintiffs indisputably and succinctly\n       demonstrated the futility of the argument espoused on behalf of Defendants that\n       ERISA preempts a minor’s settlement filed in Chancery Court such that\n       Defendants should have immediately drafted an agreed order remanding this\n       case to the Ponyotoc County Chancery Court.\n\n¶51.   He found that the Plan’s position “directly contradicts prior established caselaw,” and\n\nthat “Plaintiffs were . . . provided numerous cases directly on point which irrefutably held\n\n       7\n        This argument, itself, seems somewhat frivolous, since the Plan would have no\nconceivable reason to “delay” the judgment. Its purpose—which it freely admitted, and\nwhich was entirely proper—was to prevent the chancery court from deciding what it argued\nwas a federal question that properly should be decided by a federal court.\n\n                                                27\n\ftheir basis for removal to be invalid.” The chancellor’s conclusions—to the extent they\n\nsuggested the existence of binding caselaw—were incorrect.\n\n       Lawyers must zealously represent their clients.\n\n¶52.   We admonish lawyers to zealously represent their clients, and we sanction them when\n\nthey fail to follow the Mississippi Rules of Professional Conduct, one of which states:\n\n       A lawyer shall not bring or defend a proceeding, or assert or controvert an issue\n       therein, unless there is a basis in law and in fact for doing so that is not\n       frivolous, which includes a good faith argument for an extension, modification\n       or reversal of existing law.8\n\nThe comment to Rule 3.1 states that lawyers have\n\n       a duty to use legal procedure for the fullest benefit of the client’s cause, but also\n       a duty not to abuse legal procedure. The law, both procedural and substantive,\n       establishes the limits within which an advocate may proceed. However, the law\n       is not always clear and never is static. Accordingly, in determining the proper\n       scope of advocacy, account must be taken of the law’s ambiguities and\n       potential for change.\n\n       The plan’s removal to federal court was not frivolous.\n\n¶53.   Alleging that a lawyer’s claim is frivolous is a serious, pejorative charge that should\n\nnot lightly be made. We should encourage lawyers to challenge and test the limits of the law,\n\nso long as the claim is not patently absurd, that is to say, “so clearly untenable, or the\n\ninsufficiency of which is so manifest upon a bare inspection of the pleadings, that the court\n\nor judge is able to determine its character without argument or research.”9\n\n\n\n\n       8\n           Miss.

It certainly cannot credibly be argued that a claim is frivolous merely because it has no\n\nvalidity under established, binding precedent. Were that the case, we still would have\n\nsegregated schools,10 discriminatory jury selection,11 and pro se indigent criminal defendants.12\n\n       ERISA preemption under the circumstances of this case has not been decided.\n\n¶55.   The chancellor’s decision to award attorney fees rested on three decisions of the United\n\nStates District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi,13 and two decisions of this\n\nCourt,14 which hold that ERISA does not preempt Mississippi law governing minors’\n\nsettlements, precluding removal to federal court. But contrary to the chancellor’s finding,\n\nneither federal district court decisions nor decisions from this Court are binding precedent on\n\nfederal questions. And there are no decisions on point from the Fifth Circuit or the United\n\nStates Supreme Court. It is unacceptable to me for this Court to suggest that a lawyer should\n\nrefrain from submitting an unsettled question of federal law to a federal court, simply because\n\nthis Court or a federal district court previously has taken a position on the issue.\n\n\n\n\n       10\n         See Brown v.

Further, the Plan argues that not even the Mississippi federal district courts have\n\ndecided the precise question presented by the facts of this case because this case involved the\n\nfactual question of whether the Dillards had asked the chancellor to declare that the Plan had\n\nno right to any proceeds of the settlement.15 Moreover, at least one federal court of appeals\n\nand one federal district court have found complete ERISA preemption under similar\n\ncircumstances.16 So clearly, there is no established precedent on the preemption question.\n\nAnd even if there were, asserting a claim that is contrary to an established point of law is not\n\nipso facto frivolous.\n\n¶57.   Stated another way, the fundamental flaw in both the chancellor’s decision to award\n\nattorney fees, and the majority’s decision to affirm, is that both view this case as if the Plan\n\nadvanced an unreasonable argument in the face of settled law. The law is not settled. There\n\nis no established binding precedent on the preemption question. And even if there were,\n\nasserting a claim that is contrary to an established point of law is not ipso facto frivolous.\n\n¶58.   The majority suggests that a federal appellate court could never issue an opinion on the\n\nmerits of this issue because federal law precludes any appeal of a district court’s decision to\n\nremand a case back to state court.

Vial, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">976505</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *11 (W.D. Mich. Mar. 17, 2011).\n\n                                              30\n\fexercises jurisdiction over a case, the jurisdictional question could be raised on appeal.17 And\n\nuntil that happens, no binding precedent exists.\n\n¶59.   Further, the Plan’s preemption argument is not patently unreasonable. In Arana v.\n\nOschner Health Plan, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that\n\nERISA preempted an action in “state court to obtain a declaration that he is entitled to retain\n\ntort settlement proceeds free of Ochsner Health Plan, Inc.’s claim for reimbursement of health\n\ncare benefits previously paid for Arana’s account . . . .”18 The Plan cited this case to support\n\nremoval, arguing that the Dillards’ petition not only asked the chancellor to approve a $75,000\n\nsettlement, but also to declare that the Plan had no right to recover any portion of the\n\nsettlement as reimbursement for medical expenses it had paid.\n\n¶60.   Ultimately, the district judge distinguished Arana in her memorandum opinion by\n\nfinding that the Dillards’ request in its pleading to prevent the Plan from recovering was not\n\na request for a declaratory ruling on the Plan’s right to recover a portion of the settlement, and\n\nthat the Dillards had merely provided the chancellor notice that the Plan may have a claim\n\nagainst the settlement.\n\n¶61.   While the district judge’s view of the meaning of the prayer for relief may or may not\n\nbe correct, I must conclude that the Plan’s attorneys were not unreasonable—and certainly not\n\nfrivolous—in asserting that the Fifth Circuit’s decision in Arana—which was handed down\n\nafter the Northern District opinions on this issue—provided support for removal. Given the\n\n\n\n       17\n            See Arana, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">338</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">433</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n       18\n            Id. at 434.\n\n                                               31\n\flawyer’s duty zealously to advance the interests of the client, I must disagree with the\n\nmajority’s view; I do not at all find unreasonable the Plan’s argument that it was defending\n\nthe action for a declaratory judgment that would have affected—and ultimately did affect—its\n\nright to recover, rather than “pursuing a remedy, and thus a cause of action, that was\n\nunavailable to it under federal law.”\n\n¶62.   A careful distinction between cases and the debatable meaning of a prayer for relief\n\nin a pleading do not render the Plan’s removal frivolous. We should not deter attorneys from\n\nadvancing nonfrivolous legal arguments, however thin or doomed they may seem to some.\n\n¶63.    To the contrary, we should encourage lawyers to challenge the law to its very limits\n\nin zealously representing the interests of their clients.\n\n                                        CONCLUSION\n\n¶64.   Today, the majority substantially lowers the threshold for a frivolous claim, and I\n\nbelieve that is not a good thing for the interests of clients or for the practice of law. I fear\n\ntoday’s decision will serve to chill the spirit of trial lawyers whose duty to their clients often\n\nrequires them zealously to advance aggressive and sometimes unpopular positions and\n\narguments. Accordingly, and with the highest respect for the members of the majority, I\n\ndissent.\n\n       PIERCE AND COLEMAN, JJ., JOIN THIS OPINION.\n\n\n\n\n                                               32\n\f</pre>",
