(\"Lapid\"), a real estate\ndevelopment firm that unsuccessfully sought approval from\nthe Zoning Board of Adjustment of the Township of Scotch\nPlains, New Jersey (\"the Board\") to build a 95-bed care\nfacility for the elderly, appeals the District Court's grant of\nsummary judgment in favor of the Board and the Township,\ndefendants in Lapid's civil case, challenging their actions\n\n                               2\n\funder the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (\"FHAA\"),\n42 U.S.C. S 3601 et seq. Lapid based its claims in the\nDistrict Court primarily on two separate theories under the\nFHAA. First, Lapid contended that Scotch Plains's zoning\nsystem had a disparate impact on the elderly handicapped\nin violation of 42 U.S.C. S 3604(f). Second, Lapid claimed\nthat the Board failed to \"make reasonable accommodations\"\nin order to facilitate housing for the elderly handicapped in\nviolation of 42 U.S.C. S 3604(f)(3)(B).\n\nLapid's primary contentions on appeal are that: (1)\nbecause the Board failed to engage in the \"interactive\nprocess\" that we have held is required of employers by the\nRehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. S 701 et seq., and\nbecause the Board erroneously denied Lapid's request to\nbifurcate its variance and site plan applications, thereby\ndepriving it of a full enough record, the District Court erred\nby limiting its review to the administrative record on the\nreasonable accommodations claim; and (2) it was error for\nthe District Court to grant summary judgment on both the\nreasonable accommodations and discriminatory impact\nclaims.\n\nWe resolve the first claim adversely to Lapid by declining\nto extend the \"interactive process\" requirement that exists\nin the employer-employee context of the Rehabilitation Act\nto the housing and land use context of the FHAA. We\nconclude that the process was never intended to apply in\nthis context, and would be especially inappropriate to apply\nto local land use boards, which already face detailed\nprocedural requirements under state law. We will also\naffirm the District Court's grant of summary judgment on\nboth the reasonable accommodations and disparate impact\nclaims. Before doing so, we must determine which party\nbears the burden of establishing the various elements of an\nFHAA reasonable accommodations challenge to a local land\nuse board's decision. We resolve this question by adopting\na burden-shifting analysis, in which the plaintiff bears the\ninitial burden of showing that its requested\naccommodations are \"necessary to afford [handicapped]\nperson[s] [an] equal opportunity to use and enjoy a\ndwelling,\" 42 U.S.C. S 3604(f)(3)(B), at which point the\nburden shifts to the defendant to show that the requested\naccommodations are unreasonable.\n\n                               3\n\fIn the present case, we conclude that the plaintiff has\nfailed to produce sufficient evidence that the\naccommodations that it requested were \"necessary\" to\nafford the handicapped an \"equal opportunity\" to housing,\nand that the Board has shown that the requested\naccommodations were unreasonable, largely because of the\nproblems with traffic safety and emergency vehicle access\nthat the proposed Facility was likely to cause. We therefore\naffirm the District Court's grant of summary judgment to\nthe defendants on the reasonable accommodations claim.\nWe also affirm the District Court's judgment on the\ndiscriminatory impact claim, because we agree that Lapid\nhas failed to establish a prima facie case that Scotch\nPlains's ordinances have a discriminatory impact on the\nelderly handicapped.\n\nI. Facts & Procedural History\n\nOn June 9, 1998, Lapid applied to the Zoning Board of\nAdjustment of the Township of Scotch Plains, New Jersey\nfor the variances and site plan approval necessary to build\na long-term care facility for the elderly (\"the Facility\"). The\nproposed Facility included 35 beds in a skilled nursing\nsection, the license for which Lapid wished to transfer from\nits nursing home in nearby Plainfield, New Jersey, and 60\n\"assisted living\" beds, for which Lapid had originally\nreceived a license in Westfield, New Jersey. Lapid proposed\nto build the Facility on two contiguous lots, 1290 and 1310\nMartine Avenue. At the time it applied to the Board, Lapid\nowned one of the lots in question and was under contract\nto purchase the other. The lots, which at the time the suit\nbegan held two single-family houses, would together\nprovide 4.17 acres on which Lapid proposed to build a\n58,034 square foot building (with a footprint of 27,640\nsquare feet). Approximately 45% of the lots, or 1.9 acres,\nwas covered by freshwater wetlands and wetland transition\nareas as defined by New Jersey's Freshwater Wetland\nProtection Act, N.J.S.A. 13:9B-1 et seq., and was therefore\nnot available for construction.\n\nThe Martine Avenue lots are located in an area that is\nzoned R-1 under Scotch Plains's 1976 Master Plan. The R-\n1 zone is designated to permit only single-family houses on\n\n                                4\n\flarge lots (40,000 square feet or more -- about an acre),\nwith wide street frontage (a minimum width of 160 feet).\nHowever, several institutional uses exist in the R-1 zone\naround the lots where Lapid proposed to develop the\nFacility. These include a synagogue, a high school, a YMCA,\nand a country club.\n\nIn order to get approval to build the Facility, Lapid\nneeded the Board to grant several variances, which it\napplied for on June 9, 1998. Lapid's application requested\nthree approvals from the Board. First, because the land use\nthat Lapid proposed (i.e., a residential care facility for the\nelderly), did not fit within the uses permitted in an R-1\nzone, Lapid asked for a use variance pursuant to N.J.S.A.\n40:55D-70(d). Second, Lapid requested three non-use\nvariances pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70(c). These sought\npermission to: (1) construct a parking lot in front of the\nbuilding; (2) build a fence in excess of four feet in height;\nand (3) place a freestanding sign in front of the building. All\nof these are prohibited in residential areas and require a\nvariance. Third, Lapid sought approval for its site plan.\n\nThe Board held four public hearings on Lapid's\napplication -- on February 4, March 4, March 15, and\nMarch 24, 1999. Lapid presented testimony from various\nexperts at these meetings, including Julius Szalay, an\nengineer; Stephen Crystal, a gerontologist; Peter Steck, a\nplanner; David Horner, a traffic consultant; and Joseph\nMartin, a real estate appraiser. The Board received written\nreports from the Township's experts, Susan Kimball, a\nplanner; Paul Ferriero, an engineer; Harold Maltz, a traffic\nconsultant; Fire Chief Jonathan Ellis; Police Chief Thomas\nO'Brien; and Sergeant James Rau, the head of the police\ndepartment's traffic safety bureau. Several of these officials\nalso testified at the Board's public hearings.\n\nLapid's engineer made multiple amendments to the site\nplan in order to address the concerns that the Board and\nits experts raised. In particular, these concerns focused on\nthe layout of the parking lot and its effect on traffic safety\nboth within the Facility's lot and at the point of ingress and\negress on Martine Avenue, as well as on the access that\nemergency vehicles would have to the rear of the building.\nIn order to address the issues of emergency vehicle access,\n\n                               5\n\fLapid's planner sought to meet with the Township's fire\nchief beginning on March 10, 1999, but was unable to do\nso until March 22, two days before the Board's final\nmeeting at which it considered Lapid's variance and site\nplan applications.1 Lapid did not address the fire chief 's\nlatest concerns in a revised site plan prior to the March 24\nmeeting, and it requested bifurcation of its applications,\ni.e., it sought a decision on its variance application on\nMarch 24, but requested the Board's approval for an\nextension on its site plan application. The Board denied\nLapid's request to bifurcate, and denied the entire\napplication on the record before it at the March 24 meeting.\n\nThe Board then issued a written denial of Lapid's\napplications. The Board cited the following concerns as its\nreasons for denying the variances and site plan: (1) a\nnegative impact on the municipal zoning plan (i.e., siting a\ncommercial use in the R-1 zone); (2) traffic safety concerns,\nincluding increased traffic on Martine Avenue and hazards\nresulting from ingress and egress from the Facility's lot; (3)\na substantial portion of the site contained wetlands; and (4)\ninsufficient access for emergency and fire vehicles.\n\nLapid then filed a complaint in the District Court against\nthe Board, the Township of Scotch Plains (together,\"the\nmunicipal defendants\"), Alta Rose, the person from whom\nLapid had contracted to purchase the property at 1310\nMartine Avenue, and her daughter Barbara Horev, who held\na durable power of attorney for Rose's benefit. 2 The\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. When Lapid's representatives finally met with Fire Chief Ellis, he was\nunable to give them specific details regarding the turning radius required\nby the department's largest trucks, in particular, the \"tower ladder\"\ntruck. Ellis had previously raised the concern that the emergency vehicle\naccess lane that Lapid proposed could not accommodate the tower\nladder truck.\n\n2. On March 31, 1999, Rose, through her daughter, Horev, terminated\nher contract with Lapid. On April 29, 1999, Rose filed suit in New Jersey\nSuperior Court, Chancery Division, seeking a declaratory judgment that\nthe termination was valid. The Superior Court ruled in her favor. Lapid\nappealed this decision, but withdrew its appeal on June 15, 2000, at\nwhich point the New Jersey Appellate Division entered an order\ndismissing the appeal. The District Court in this case dismissed Lapid's\n\n                               6\n\fcomplaint alleged that: (1) the Board's denial of Lapid's\napplication for variances and site plan approval violated the\nFHAA's requirement that municipalities \"make reasonable\naccommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services,\nwhen such accommodations may be necessary to afford\n[handicapped] person[s] [an] equal opportunity to use and\nenjoy\" housing, 42 U.S.C. S 3604(f)(3)(B); (2) the Township's\nzoning ordinances violated the FHAA, S 3604(f), by having\nan adverse disparate impact on the elderly handicapped; (3)\nthe denial violated the New Jersey Constitution and New\nJersey's Municipal Land Use Law (MLUL), N.J.S.A. 40:55D-\n1 et seq.; (4) the denial violated the Equal Protection and\nDue Process clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the\nU.S. Constitution, and article I, section I of the New Jersey\nConstitution; and (5) Rose and Horev violated their\ncontractual obligations.3\n\nFollowing discovery, the municipal defendants moved for\nsummary judgment, which the District Court granted as to\nall counts. Lapid raises three questions on appeal: (1)\nwhether the District Court erred by limiting its review of the\nreasonable accommodations claim to the materials that\nwere before the Board (i.e., whether the District Court\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nclaims against Rose and Horev as a result of the state court decision,\nand Lapid does not appeal the dismissal. Rose subsequently sold her\nproperty to the adjacent YMCA, and therefore Lapid seeks only punitive\nand compensatory damages, and declaratory judgment that its rights\nwere violated (not an order directing the Board to approve its specific\nsite\nplan), because it cannot develop the Facility without the land that Rose\nsold to the YMCA.\n\n3. Plaintiffs may bring three different types of claims against municipal\nland use authorities under the FHAA: (1) intentional discrimination\nclaims (also called disparate treatment claims); (2) disparate impact\nclaims; and (3) claims that the municipal authority failed to \"make\nreasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services,\nwhen such accommodations may be necessary to afford[handicapped]\nperson[s] [an] equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.\" 42 U.S.C.\nS 3604(f)(3)(B); see also Gamble v. City of Escondido, 104 F.3d 300, 304-\n07 (9th Cir. 1997) (describing the three different causes of action\navailable to plaintiffs under the FHAA). In this case, Lapid brings only\ndisparate impact and \"failure to make reasonable accommodations\"\nclaims.\n\n                               7\n\fshould have allowed Lapid to supplement the\nadministrative record); (2) whether summary judgment was\nproper on the claim that the Board violated the FHAA by\nfailing to make reasonable accommodations under 42\nU.S.C. S 3604(f)(3)(B); and (3) whether summary judgment\nwas proper on the issue of whether the zoning ordinances\nof Scotch Plains have a disparate impact on the elderly\nhandicapped in violation of 42 U.S.C. S 3604(f). The District\nCourt had jurisdiction based on 28 U.S.C. S 1331 and 42\nU.S.C. S 3613(a); it exercised supplemental jurisdiction over\nthe state law claims. This court has jurisdiction pursuant\nto 28 U.S.C. S 1291. We review de novo the District Court's\ngrant of summary judgment, see Woodside v. School Dist. of\nPhila. Bd. of Educ., 248 F.3d 129, 130 (3d Cir. 2001), under\nthe familiar standard set forth in the margin.4\n\nII. Failure to Make Reasonable Accommodations\n       Under 42 U.S.C. S 3604(f)(3)(B) --\n       Extent of the Record on Review, and\n       Burdens of Proof\n\nLapid relies on 42 U.S.C. S 3604(f)(3)(B) for its claim that\nthe Board failed to make reasonable accommodations as\nrequired under that section when it denied Lapid's request\nfor variances and site plan approval. The FHAA, 42 U.S.C.\nS 3604(f), requires local land use boards to make\n\"reasonable accommodations in rules, policies[and]\npractices\" when reviewing proposals for housing for the\nhandicapped. It provides in pertinent part that:\n\n        [I]t shall be unlawful --\n\n       (f)\n\n       (1) To discriminate in the sale or rental, or to\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4. Summary judgment is proper if there is no genuine issue of material\nfact and if, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the non-\nmoving party, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of\nlaw. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317\n(1986). The judge's function at the summary judgment stage is not to\nweigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter, but to\ndetermine whether there is a genuine issue for trial. See Anderson v.\nLiberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249 (1986).\n\n                               8\n\f       otherwise make unavailable or deny, a dwelling to any\n       buyer or renter because of a handicap of --\n\n        (A) that buyer or renter,\n\n        (B) a person residing in or intending to reside in that\n       dwelling after it is so sold, rented, or made available;\n       or\n\n        (C) any person associated with that buyer or renter.\n\n        . . . .\n\n       (3) For purposes of this subsection, discrimination\n       includes --\n\n        . . . .\n\n       (B) a refusal to make reasonable accommodations in\n       rules, policies, practices, or services, when such\n       accommodations may be necessary to afford such\n       person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling\n       . . . .\n\n42 U.S.C. S 3604.\n\nLapid contends that by denying its variance and site plan\napplications, the Board refused to make reasonable\naccommodations to facilitate the construction of housing\nfor the elderly handicapped, thereby violating the FHAA.\nBefore addressing the question whether summary judgment\nwas proper on the reasonable accommodations claim, we\nmust first address the proper scope of the record on review\nwhen hearing a reasonable accommodations challenge to a\nlocal land use decision brought under the FHAA, and the\nburdens of proof applicable to such a challenge.\n\nA. Was it Error for the District Court to\n       Limit its Review to the Materials That Were\n       Before the Board?\n\nLapid submits that the District Court erred by limiting its\nreview to the materials that were in the administrative\nrecord before the Board. Lapid asked the District Court for\npermission to supplement the administrative record for the\npurpose of litigating its reasonable accommodations claim,\nbut the Court refused, holding that it \"must review the\n\n                               9\n\fZoning Board's decision based solely on the record below.\"\nLapid's argument that it was error for the District Court to\nlimit its review to the materials that were before the Board\nis grounded on its contentions that the Board and its\nexperts failed to engage in an \"informal interactive process\"\nwith Lapid and its engineer, and that it committed\nprocedural error by refusing to allow Lapid to bifurcate its\nvariance and site plan applications. Lapid contends that\nwhen a local land use board fails to engage in such a\nprocess, a court reviewing an FHAA challenge to the local\nboard's decision should allow the plaintiff to supplement\nthe administrative record.\n\nLapid points to two sources for the \"interactive process\"\nrequirement that it suggests exists. First, Lapid argues that\nbecause the reasonable accommodations provision in the\nFHAA is modeled on the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29\nU.S.C. S 701 et seq., a duty of the Board to communicate\nand cooperate in good faith should be imported from this\ncourt's Rehabilitation Act jurisprudence and grafted onto\nour FHAA jurisprudence. Second, Lapid argues that\"New\nJersey law . . . requires a similar interactive process.\" In\nview of these contentions, we must address the questions:\n(1) whether the District Court reached the correct legal\nconclusion that courts reviewing FHAA reasonable\naccommodations challenges to zoning board decisions\nshould ordinarily limit their review to the record before the\nzoning board; and (2) whether there is an additional\n\"interactive process\" requirement, which the Board in this\ncase failed to meet, that would require a reviewing court to\nlook outside the administrative record.\n\n1. Should a Court Reviewing an FHAA Reasonable\nAccommodations Challenge to an Adverse Decision\nfrom a Local Land Use Board Limit Its Review\nto the Administrative Record?\n\nAlthough we have not previously addressed the issue of\nthe proper scope of review for a federal court reviewing an\nFHAA reasonable accommodations challenge to a decision\nof a local land use board, we are convinced that federal\ncourts should limit their review to the materials that were\npresented to the local land use board, except in\n\n                               10\n\fcircumstances where the board prevents applicants from\npresenting sufficient information.\n\nTo support its conclusion that a reviewing court should\nnot look outside the record when reviewing an FHAA\nreasonable accommodations challenge to a local land use\ndecision, the District Court cited Keys Youth Services, Inc.\nv. City of Olathe, 75 F. Supp. 2d 1235 (D. Kan. 1999),\nwhich was later affirmed in relevant part by the Tenth\nCircuit, 248 F.3d 1267 (10th Cir. 2001). In Keys Youth\nServices, a nonprofit organization (Keys) sought a variance\nthat it needed to establish a group home in a single-family\nhome in Olathe, Kansas for ten youths who had been\nabused, neglected, or abandoned. After the local land use\nboard twice denied Keys's application for a variance, Keys\nsued in federal court, alleging that the board had violated\nthe FHAA's reasonable accommodations requirement when\nit refused to grant the variance. The district court granted\njudgment as a matter of law to the City of Olathe on the\nreasonable accommodations claim because it found that\nKeys had failed to present evidence to the local zoning\nboard that the requested accommodation was necessary.\nWhile the court concluded that Keys might have been able\nto show that a minimum of 10 residents was required for\nits group home's financial viability, it found that Keys had\nfailed to present any evidence of this necessity to the local\nzoning board.\n\nThe Tenth Circuit affirmed the district court's judgment\non the reasonable accommodations claim based \"on the\nprinciple that Olathe cannot be liable for refusing to grant\na reasonable and necessary accommodation if the City\nnever knew the accommodation was in fact necessary.\"\nKeys Youth Services, 248 F.3d at 1275. The court held that\nplaintiffs should be required to present all of the evidence\nthey have that would justify why an accommodation is\nnecessary under the FHAA to the local land use board, and\nthat a reviewing court should not look outside the\nadministrative record.\n\nThe Fourth Circuit adopted the same position in Bryant\nWoods Inn, Inc. v. Howard County, 124 F.3d 597 (4th Cir.\n1997), an FHAA reasonable accommodations challenge\nbrought by a non-profit group home for adults suffering\n\n                               11\n\ffrom Alzheimer's Disease that was seeking to expand its\nnumber of residents from 8 to 15. In Bryant Woods, the\ncourt refused to look beyond the administrative record and\naffirmed the district court's grant of summary judgment in\nfavor of Howard County because the non-profit group had\nfailed to present evidence to the local land use board that\nthe expansion was \"necessary\" within the meaning of the\nFHAA. Id. at 605-06.\n\nWe join the Tenth and Fourth Circuits in holding that\ncourts hearing reasonable accommodations challenges\nshould ordinarily limit their review to the administrative\nrecord. This rule permits local land use boards to have the\ninitial opportunity to provide reasonable accommodations\nto facilitate housing for the handicapped; it also comports\nwith the tradition in American law that land use decisions\nare quintessentially local in nature. See, e.g. , FERC v.\nMississippi, 456 U.S. 742, 768 n.30 (1982) (\"[R]egulation of\nland use is perhaps the quintessential state activity.\");\nVillage of Belle Terre v. Boraas, 416 U.S. 1, 13 (1974)\n(Marshall, J., dissenting) (noting that zoning \"may indeed\nbe the most essential function performed by local\ngovernment\"). We too have recognized in similar contexts\nthe value of local authorities resolving such matters on\ntheir own without interference from the federal courts. See\nAcierno v. Mitchell, 6 F.3d 970 (3d Cir. 1993) (stating that\ncourts should not insert themselves in \"delicate area[s],\"\nsubject to local regulation until local authorities have \"had\nthe opportunity to apply authoritatively\" their specific\nregulations).\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, we point out that it may\nbe necessary for a court reviewing an FHAA reasonable\naccommodations claim to look outside of the administrative\nrecord when a land use board either intentionally or\ninadvertently prevents an applicant from presenting the\nevidence necessary to support an FHAA reasonable\naccommodations claim.5 Lapid asserts that the Board's\n\n(Text continued on page 14)\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5. As is clear from the text, our holding that courts reviewing reasonable\naccommodations challenges to local land use decisions brought under\nthe FHAA should ordinarily limit their review to the administrative record\nassumes that plaintiffs who bring reasonable accommodations claims\n\n                                12\n\fagainst localities must usually first seek redress through variance\napplications to the local land use authority. That holding is therefore in\ntension with some district court decisions from within this Circuit\n(including one that we affirmed summarily) that hold that in some\ncircumstances a plaintiff need not first apply for a variance in order to\nbring an FHAA reasonable accommodations claim. See Horizon House\nDev. Servs., Inc. v. Township of Upper Southampton , 804 F. Supp. 683\n(E.D. Pa. 1992) (allowing a plaintiff to bring an FHAA reasonable\naccommodations challenge to a local zoning ordinance without first\nseeking a variance from a local land use board), judgment aff 'd without\nop., 995 F.2d 217 (3d Cir. 1993); Assisted Living Assocs. of Moorestown,\nL.L.C. v. Moorestown Township, 996 F. Supp. 409, 425-28 (D.N.J. 1998)\n(same). But see Marriott Senior Living Servs., Inc. v. Springfield\nTownship,\n78 F. Supp. 2d 376, 385-86 (E.D. Pa. 1999) (\"While strict compliance\nwith every local ordinance or regulation is not required . . . the\napplicant\nmust show that under the circumstances it has afforded the appropriate\nlocal authority a reasonable opportunity to consider the project in some\nfinal form.\"); Community Interactions -- Bucks County, Inc. v. Township\nof Bensalem, 1994 WL 702943, 8 A.D.D. 276 (E.D. Pa. 1994) (dismissing\nan FHAA suit because the plaintiff failed to seek a variance with the\nlocal\nland use board). In the cases where district courts heard FHAA claims\nwithout requiring the plaintiff to have first sought a variance with a\nlocal\nland use authority, the reviewing court necessarily had to consider\nmaterials from outside the nonexistent administrative record.\n\nAlthough we are not bound by the district court cases cited above,\nincluding the case that we summarily affirmed, (summary affirmances\nare non-precedential, see 3d Cir. I.O.P. 6.2.1), and we are not presented\nwith and do not reach questions of ripeness or exhaustion in this case,\nwe note that the position adopted by the Seventh and Eighth Circuits on\nwhen plaintiffs bringing FHAA reasonable accommodations challenges\nagainst localities must first apply for variances with local land use\nboards rationalizes these cases (which allowed plaintiffs to bring\nreasonable accommodations claims without first seeking a variance) with\nthe necessary implication of our holding today (that most reasonable\naccommodations claims must first be presented to local land use\nboards). In United States v. Village of Palatine , 37 F.3d 1230 (7th Cir.\n1994), the Seventh Circuit reviewed an FHAA reasonable\naccommodations challenge to a local ordinance for which the plaintiff\nhad not sought a variance. The court held that the claim was not ripe,\nand that in general a city must be afforded the opportunity to make the\nrequested accommodation. Id. at 1233. However, the court identified two\nexceptions where the claim would be ripe even if the plaintiff had not\n\n                               13\n\fdenial of its request to bifurcate its variance and site plan\napplications was unreasonable and in violation of New\nJersey's Municipal Land Use Law, and prevented it from\npresenting materials relevant to its reasonable\naccommodations claim. In particular, Lapid argues that it\nhad a statutory right to bifurcate its applications at any\npoint during the application review procedure pursuant to\nN.J.S.A. 40:55D-76(b), which provides that \"[t]he developer\nmay elect to submit a separate application requesting\napproval of the variance and a subsequent application for\nany required approval of a subdivision, site plan or\nconditional use.\" Therefore, contends Lapid, the District\nCourt should have granted Lapid's request to supplement\nthe administrative record.\n\nThe Board responds that its denial of Lapid's variance\nand site plan applications at the March 24 meeting was\nmerely the result of Lapid's refusal to consent to an\nextension on both applications, which it had the power to\ndo pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-76(c). The Board further\nsubmits that even if it had granted the request to bifurcate,\nit could not have meaningfully evaluated Lapid's variance\napplication without reference to the specific problems that\nthe Board had identified with the site plan application. In\nother words, the Board argues that Lapid essentially forced\nit to review its site plan application as it existed at the\nMarch 24 meeting by not consenting to an extension on\nboth the variance and site plan applications. Therefore, the\nargument continues, Lapid cannot now complain that the\nBoard prevented it from presenting all of the information\nnecessary to support its reasonable accommodations claim.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nfirst sought a variance from the local land use board: (1) if the claim\nwere a challenge to the variance application procedure itself; and (2) if\nthe variance application process was demonstrably futile. Id. at 1234.\nThe Village of Palatine court also limited the ripeness rule that it\nformed\nto reasonable accommodations claims and noted that\"if the plaintiff 's\nclaim were of discriminatory intent, rather than failure to make a\nreasonable accommodation, th[e] claim might well be presently ripe even\nthough [the plaintiff] has not sought a special use approval.\" Id. at 1233\nn.3. The Eighth Circuit has followed the Seventh Circuit's ripeness rule\nfor FHAA reasonable accommodations claims. See Oxford House-A v. City\nof Univ. City, 87 F.3d 1022, 1024-25 (8th Cir. 1996).\n\n                               14\n\fNew Jersey's Municipal Land Use Law provides that local\nzoning boards must act on an application for a variance or\nsite plan approval within 120 days of when a complete\napplication is submitted. If a zoning board fails to act\nwithin the statutory period, the application is deemed\ngranted by force of law. See N.J.S.A. 40:55D-73(b).\nHowever, an applicant may consent to the extension of this\n120-day period. See N.J.S.A. 40:55D-73(b); N.J.S.A.\n40:55D-76(c). In the present case, Lapid's counsel agreed to\nextend the Board's deadline once to April 1, 1999. Instead\nof offering to extend the deadline again, Lapid sought to\nbifurcate its applications and to require the Board to vote\non the variance application before April 1 or to have it\napproved by force of law.\n\nLapid contends that by requesting to bifurcate its\napplication, it was offering to extend the time limit for the\nsite plan application, and resting its case only on the\nvariance application. Because of New Jersey's statutory\nscheme governing the evaluation of variance applications,\nhowever, we agree that the Board could not have\nmeaningfully considered the variance application without\nreference to the specific problems that it had identified in\nthe site plan application and Lapid's proposed solutions to\nthese problems, and that the offer to extend time for\nconsideration of the site plan application was therefore\nessentially meaningless.\n\nThe section of the MLUL that governs applications for use\nvariances, N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70(d), requires an applicant to\nestablish that certain positive and negative criteria are\nfulfilled in order to have the variance granted. See Smart\nSMR of N.Y., Inc. v. Borough of Fair Lawn Bd. of Adjustment,\n704 A.2d 1271, 1278 (N.J. 1998). To establish the positive\ncriteria, the applicant generally must show \" `special\nreasons' for the grant of the variance.\" Sica v. Bd. of\nAdjustment of the Township of Wall, 603 A.2d 30, 32 (N.J.\n1992). The \"negative criteria require proof that the variance\n`can be granted without substantial detriment to the public\ngood' and that it will not substantially impair the intent\nand purpose of the zone plan and zoning ordinance.\" Id.\n(quoting N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70(d)). When the variance\napplication seeks permission for an \"inherently beneficial\n\n                               15\n\fuse,\" as it does in this case, the application presumptively\nsatisfies the positive criteria. See Smart SMR , 704 A.2d at\n1278. The New Jersey Supreme Court has instructed that\nwhen evaluating a variance application for an inherently\nbeneficial use, a zoning board must identify and\"weigh the\npositive and negative criteria and determine whether, on\nbalance, the grant of the variance would cause a\nsubstantial detriment to the public good.\" Id. at 1279\n(quoting Sica, 603 A.2d at 37).\n\nThe potential negative criteria relating to the use variance\nthat Lapid sought in this case are directly related to its\nproposed site plan. In denying the application, the Board\nrelied on concerns about traffic safety and emergency\nvehicle access. These issues certainly go to the question\nwhether the variance would cause \"substantial detriment to\nthe public good.\" N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70(d). Further, the size of\nthe proposed Facility, another expressed concern, goes to\nthe question whether granting the variance would\n\"substantially impair the intent and the purpose of the zone\nplan and zoning ordinance.\" N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70(d).\nTherefore, even assuming that it was error to deny the\nbifurcation, we do not see how the Board could have\nconsidered the negative statutory criteria that it was\nrequired to consider without reference to the site plan\napplication as it existed when the Board denied the\napplication.6 Lapid argues that a zoning board can consider\na variance application with stipulated or hypothetical\nconditions on a site plan that will be considered\nsubsequent to the approval of the variance application. To\nbe sure, this may be feasible and desirable in some cases.\nWe do not see, however, how it would have been feasible in\nthe present case.\n\nMost importantly, we agree with the District Court that\n\"based on a reading of the Zoning Board's hearing on the\nmatter, it appears that Lapid-Laurel was given a full and\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6. We do not address the question whether the Board committed\nprocedural error under the MLUL that would require its decision to be\nreversed. That would be an issue appropriate for direct appeal to the\nNew Jersey courts, and, at all events, Lapid did not present it to the\nDistrict Court or this court.\n\n                               16\n\ffair opportunity to present its case before the Zoning Board.\nOver the course of four hearings, Lapid . . . presented five\nwitnesses and various exhibits.\" Indeed, as the District\nCourt noted, \"[p]laintiff 's counsel even conceded at oral\nargument that the Board in no way prevented plaintiff from\npresenting any and all evidence it wished to advance.\"\nTherefore, we do not think that the Board's denial of\nLapid's request to bifurcate its applications shows that the\nBoard prevented Lapid from presenting the necessary\nevidence to support its FHAA claim, nor does it provide a\nsufficient reason for this court to look outside the\nadministrative record when reviewing Lapid's reasonable\naccommodations claim.\n\n2. Does the FHAA or New Jersey Law Require a\n       Local Land Use Board to Engage in an \"Informal\n       Interactive Process\" with a Developer?\n\nLapid argues that the FHAA itself, or alternatively New\nJersey's MLUL, imposes an affirmative obligation on local\nland use boards to engage in an \"informal interactive\nprocess\" with variance applicants. Lapid argues that the\nBoard in this case failed to engage in that process (citing in\nparticular the inability of Lapid's representatives to meet\nwith Fire Chief Ellis when they wanted to do so), and that\ntherefore it is appropriate for a reviewing federal court to\nlook at materials from outside the administrative record.\nFor the following reasons, we do not think that any such\n\"informal interactive process\" requirement exists.\n\nLapid argues that because the language of the FHAA's\nreasonable accommodations requirement was borrowed\nfrom the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. S 701 et seq.,\nand that because this court has held that under the\nRehabilitation Act, a defendant employer has \"a duty to\nmake reasonable efforts to assist [an employee,] to\ncommunicate with him in good faith,\" Mengine v. Runyon,\n114 F.3d 415, 420 (3d Cir. 1997), a local land use board\nhas a similar duty under the FHAA to engage in an\n\"informal interactive process\" with a developer seeking a\nvariance on behalf of the handicapped.\n\nMengine involved a Rehabilitation Act challenge brought\nby a Postal Service employee, alleging that the Service had\n\n                               17\n\ffailed to provide reasonable accommodations by failing to\nmove him to a position other than letter carrier after he\nbecame disabled and incapable of fulfilling the duties of\nthat position. Relying on Beck v. University of Wisconsin, 75\nF.3d 1130 (7th Cir. 1996), an analogous case from the\nSeventh Circuit that involved a claim brought under the\nAmericans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Mengine held that\n\"both parties [i.e., the employer and the employee] have a\nduty to assist in the search for [an] appropriate reasonable\naccommodation.\" 114 F.3d at 420.\n\nBeck involved a similar claim brought by a disabled\nemployee under the ADA against her employer for failing to\nprovide reasonable accommodations for her disability. In\nBeck, the court specifically relied on 29 C.F.R.S 1630\n(1995), a regulation promulgated pursuant to the ADA, to\nreach its conclusion that \"[t]he appropriate accommodation\"\nfor an employer to provide \"is best determined through a\nflexible, interactive process that involves both the employer\nand the [employee] with a disability.\" Beck, 75 F.3d at 1135\n(quoting 29 C.F.R. S 1630, app. (1995)) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Although we recognized in Mengine that 29\nC.F.R. S 1630 technically applies only to the ADA, we found\nthat Beck was \"relevant to our analysis of the Rehabilitation\nAct because in 1992 the Rehabilitation Act was amended\nto incorporate the standards of several sections of\nthe ADA, including the section defining `reasonable\naccommodation.' \" Mengine, 114 F.3d at 420. We have\nelaborated on the interactive process in later cases. See\nDonahue v. Consol. Rail Corp., 224 F.3d 226, 234 (3d Cir.\n2000).\n\nThe FHAA borrows language from the Rehabilitation Act.\nSee Hovsons, Inc. v. Township of Brick, 89 F.3d 1096, 1101\n(3d Cir. 1996). However, the FHAA and the Rehabilitation\nAct do not bear the significant similarities that justified\nimporting the requirements of 29 C.F.R. S 1630 from the\nADA to the Rehabilitation Act. The informal interactive\nprocess that S 1630 describes applies specifically to an\nemployer-employee relationship. The regulation was\npromulgated to apply in the employment context, and it is\nhighly doubtful that it was ever contemplated that it would\napply in the very different context of housing and land use\n\n                               18\n\fregulations. Moreover, we believe that it would be\nparticularly inappropriate to impose it on local land use\nboards because they already face detailed state and\nmunicipal requirements mandating formal procedures,\nwhich, at least in some cases, prohibit them from engaging\nin informal, off-the-record negotiations with variance\napplicants. See N.J.S.A. 40:55D-10 (requiring that local\nzoning boards hold hearings for variance applications at\nwhich testimony is given under oath and produce written\nresolutions that contain findings of fact and legal\nconclusions based on these hearings); see also Commons v.\nWestwood Zoning Bd. of Adjustment, 410 A.2d 1138, 1145\n(N.J. 1980) (noting that the New Jersey Supreme Court\n\"ha[s] frequently advised boards of adjustment to make\nfindings predicated upon factual support in the record\").7\nTherefore, we hold that notwithstanding the \"interactive\nprocess\" requirement that exists in the law of this court in\nthe employment context under the Rehabilitation Act, see\nMengine, 114 F.3d at 420, the FHAA imposes no such\nrequirement on local land use authorities.\n\nLapid also argues that New Jersey law requires local\nzoning boards to engage in an informal interactive process\nwith developers who apply for site plan approvals. To\nsupport this proposition, Lapid cites the following language\nfrom Pizzo Mantin Group v. Township of Randolph , 645 A.2d\n89 (N.J. 1994):\n\n       Although a planning board is not required affirmatively\n       to propose suggested revisions and modifications of a\n       subdivision plan or site plan, the MLUL [Municipal\n       Land Use Law] contemplates active involvement by\n       planning boards in their review of subdivisions. The\n       generalized design standards for subdivision\n       ordinances prescribed by the MLUL necessarily invoke\n       the planning board's expertise and familiarity with\n       local conditions and implicate the exercise of discretion\n       by planning boards. . . . That discretion is best\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n7. By imposing an \"informal interactive process\" on land use boards, we\nwould also be compromising the important policies underlying state law\nlimitations on off-the-record contacts between developers and board\nmembers, such as limiting the potential for corruption of local officials.\n\n                               19\n\f       exercised by a process in which planning boards\n       affirmatively interact with developers when reviewing\n       proposed subdivisions.\n\nId. at 98 (emphasis added) (citation omitted). We do not\nagree that Pizzo Mantin imposes a requirement that local\nland use boards engage in an informal interactive process\nwith developers. First, the language in the case says that\nhow a board interacts with a developer is a matter of\ndiscretion that is \"best exercised\" when \"planning boards\naffirmatively interact with developers.\" Id. at 233. This\nlanguage is far from mandatory. Second, it is unclear how,\nif the Scotch Plains zoning board violated New Jersey's\nMLUL in this case, that should bear on the scope of review\nof a federal FHAA claim (unless in violating the MLUL, the\nBoard prevented Lapid from presenting necessary evidence).\nTo the extent that Lapid is attempting to argue its pendent\nstate law claims, it is barred from doing so because it failed\nto raise these state law claims in this appeal.\n\nIt is generally beneficial for land use boards to be\ncooperative with developers, and we do not think that the\nBoard engaged in model behavior toward Lapid in this case.\nNevertheless, we cannot impose an interactive process\nrequirement on the Board as a matter of law.\n\nB. Burdens of Proof for Reasonable\nAccommodations Claims\n\nAs noted above, Lapid relies on 42 U.S.C. S 3604(f)(3)(B)\nfor its claim that the Board failed to make reasonable\naccommodations as required under that section when it\ndenied Lapid's request for variances and site plan approval.\nThe statute provides that it is unlawful \"[t]o discriminate\nagainst any person in the terms, conditions, or privileges of\nsale or rental of a dwelling, or in the provision of services\nor facilities in connection with such dwelling, because of a\nhandicap . . . .\" 42 U.S.C. S 3604(f)(2). The statute defines\ndiscrimination to include \"a refusal to make reasonable\naccommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services,\nwhen such accommodations may be necessary to afford\nsuch person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a\ndwelling.\" S 3604(f)(3)(B).\n\n                                20\n\fHovsons, Inc. v. Township of Brick, 89 F.3d 1096 (3d Cir.\n1996), is the only case in which we have addressed the\nlegal framework of an FHAA reasonable accommodations\nclaim. Hovsons focused mainly on the meaning of the\n\"reasonable accommodations\" part of S 3604(f)(3)(B), as\nopposed to the meaning and import of the terms\n\"necessary\" and \"equal opportunity.\" The main question in\nHovsons was which party carried the burden on the\nreasonableness issue, i.e., whether it is the plaintiff 's\nburden to show that the requested accommodation is\nreasonable, or the defendant's burden to show that it is\nnot. Hovsons relied on our Rehabilitation Act cases to hold\nthat it is the defendant's burden to show that the requested\naccommodation is unreasonable:\n\n       Our precedents interpreting S 504 of the Rehabilitation\n       Act have held that the burden of proving that a\n       proposed accommodation is not reasonable rests with\n       the defendant. See Juvelis v. Snider, 68 F.3d 648, 653\n       & n.5 (3d Cir. 1995); Nathanson v. Medical College of\n       Pennsylvania, 926 F.2d 1368, 1385 (3d Cir. 1991). As\n       we have already held that courts must look to the body\n       of law developed under S 504 of the Rehabilitation Act\n       as an interpretive guide to the `reasonable\n       accommodations' provisions of the FHAA, we further\n       hold that the burden should have been placed on the\n       [defendant] [t]ownship . . . to prove that it was either\n       unable to accommodate [the plaintiff] or that the\n       accommodation . . . proposed was unreasonable.\n\nHovsons, 89 F.3d at 1103. At least three Courts of Appeals\ndisagree with our position on which party has the burden\non the issue of reasonableness. See Groner v. Golden Gate\nGarden Apartments, 250 F.3d 1039, 1045 (6th Cir. 2001)\n(\"[W]e conclude that the plaintiff in a Fair Housing Act case\nhas the burden of proof to establish the reasonableness of\na proposed accommodation.\"); Bryant Woods Inn, Inc. v.\nHoward County, 124 F.3d 597, 603-04 (4th Cir. 1997)\n(holding that it is the plaintiff 's burden to show that the\nrequested accommodation is reasonable); Elderhaven, Inc.\nv. City of Lubbock, 98 F.3d 175, 178 (5th Cir. 1996) (\"[W]e\nreject the suggestion of certain courts that a Fair Housing\nAct defendant bears the burden of proof on the question of\nreasonableness.\") (citing Hovsons).\n\n                               21\n\fAlthough Hovsons discussed only the \"reasonableness\"\npart of the statute, the Township contends that the\nplaintiffs were also required to show that the requested\naccommodations were \"necessary to afford . . .[an] equal\nopportunity\" to the handicapped. 42 U.S.C. S 3604(f)(3)(B).\nWe agree that the plain language of the statute requires us\nto focus on all three factors, i.e., whether the requested\naccommodation is \"(1) reasonable and (2) necessary to (3)\nafford handicapped persons an equal opportunity to use\nand enjoy housing.\" Bryant Woods Inn, 124 F.3d at 603.\nTherefore, we must determine which party carries the\nburden of demonstrating these issues. We are bound by\nHovsons's holding that the defendant bears the burden of\nshowing that the accommodation is unreasonable, but\nbecause Hovsons did not decide which party has the\nburden of showing that the requested accommodation is\nnecessary to afford handicapped persons an equal\nopportunity to housing, we must decide these issues. We\nthink that under S 3604(f)(3)(B) the plaintiff bears the initial\nburden of showing that the requested accommodation is\nnecessary to afford handicapped persons an equal\nopportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling, at which point the\nburden shifts to the defendant to show that the requested\naccommodation is unreasonable.\n\nWe believe that this approach makes more sense and\nmore closely comports with the likely intent of Congress\nthan the approach of placing the burden on the defendant\nto show both (1) that the requested accommodation is not\nnecessary to create an equal opportunity for housing; and\n(2) that it is unreasonable. We initially note that the\nRehabilitation Act cases on which Hovsons relied provide\nno guidance on the issue of who should bear the burden on\nfactors other than reasonableness. In fact, they provide\nlittle analysis even on the issue of who should bear the\nburden on reasonableness. See Juvelis v. Snider , 68 F.3d\n648, 653 n.5 (3d Cir. 1995) (stating without discussion that\n\"the burden is on [the defendant] to demonstrate that\nadjusting its requirements would fundamentally alter the\nprogram or impose an undue burden on the department\");\nNathanson v. Med. College of Pa., 926 F.2d 1368, 1385 (3d\nCir. 1991) (same). But see McGregor v. La. State Univ. Bd.\nof Supervisors, 3 F.3d 850, 859 n.11 (5th Cir. 1993)\n\n                               22\n\f(holding that S 504 of the Rehabilitation Act imposes the\nburden of proof as to reasonableness on the plaintiff).\n\nBecause the cases on which Hovsons relied to place the\nburden on the reasonableness issue on the defendant do\nnot provide any guidance as to where the burden should be\nplaced on the other issues (that would be analogous to the\n\"necessary\" and \"equal opportunity\" elements of\nS 3604(f)(3)), and because \"the FHA[A]'s text evidences no\nintent to alter normal burdens\" from the plaintiff to the\ndefendant, Bryant Woods Inn, 124 F.3d at 603-04, we must\ndetermine whether Congress intended to place the burden\non the issue of whether the requested accommodation is\n\"necessary to create an equal opportunity\" on the plaintiff\nor the defendant. We think that a burden-shifting approach\nin which the plaintiff would first have the burden of\ndemonstrating that the requested accommodation is\nnecessary to create an equal opportunity, at which point\nthe burden would shift to the defendant to show that the\naccommodation is unreasonable, makes sense from a policy\nstandpoint.\n\nWhile a plaintiff is in the best position to show what is\nnecessary to afford its clients (i.e., the handicapped\npopulation that it wishes to serve) an equal opportunity to\nuse and enjoy housing, a defendant municipality is in the\nbest position to provide evidence concerning what is\nreasonable or unreasonable within the context of its zoning\nscheme. This burden-shifting approach is also consistent\nwith the approach that courts have applied to intentional\ndiscrimination and disparate impact claims brought under\n42 U.S.C. S 3604(f), the two other types of FHAA claims\navailable against local land use boards in addition to\nreasonable accommodations claims. See 148 A.L.R. Fed. 1,\n53, S 3[e] (1998) (\"The courts tend to follow a burden-\nshifting approach in determining whether a defendant's\nconduct is violative of 42 U.S.C.A. S 3604(f).. . . [O]nce the\nplaintiff has established a prima facie case of housing\ndiscrimination under the statute, . . . the burden shifts to\nthe defendant to demonstrate a legitimate\nnondiscriminatory reason for its conduct or, in the case of\na governmental defendant, to show that its actions\nfurthered a legitimate, bona fide governmental interest, and\n\n                               23\n\fthat no alternative would serve that interest with less\ndiscriminatory effect. Once the defendant has made such a\nshowing, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to establish that\nthe reason asserted by the defendant is merely a pretext for\ndiscrimination.\"); see also Stephenson v. Ridgewood Village\nApartments, 1994 WL 792581, 8 A.D.D. 414 (W.D. Mich.\n1994) (applying a 3-step burden-shifting analysis to claims\nof intentional discrimination brought under 42 U.S.C.\nS 3604). Because it makes sense from a policy standpoint\nand is consistent with courts' interpretation of other claims\nbrought under the FHAA, we conclude that Congress\nintended to place on the plaintiff the burden of showing\nthat a requested accommodation is \"necessary\" to give the\nhandicapped an \"equal opportunity\" to use and enjoy\nhousing.\n\nIn sum, we read S 3604(f)(3) to require a burden-shifting\nanalysis in which the initial burden is on the plaintiff to\ndemonstrate that the accommodations that it requested are\n\"necessary to afford [handicapped] persons[an] equal\nopportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling,\" 42 U.S.C.\nS 3604(f)(3)(B), at which point the burden shifts to the\ndefendant to show that the requested accommodations are\nunreasonable.\n\nIII. Was Summary Judgment Proper on the\nReasonable Accommodations Claim?\n\nIn order to evaluate the District Court's grant of\nsummary judgment to the municipal defendants on the\nreasonable accommodations claim, we must determine\nwhether there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding:\n(1) whether the accommodations that Lapid requested were\nnecessary to afford handicapped persons an equal\nopportunity to use and enjoy housing; and, if so (2) whether\nthe accommodations requested were unreasonable.\n\nAs an initial matter, there are two points on which the\nparties agree or that are settled beyond dispute with\nrespect to the reasonable accommodations claim: (1) that\nthe future residents of the Facility that Lapid proposed to\nbuild would be handicapped within the meaning of Section\n3604(f), see Hovsons, 89 F.3d at 1103 n.3; and (2) that a\n\n                               24\n\fnursing home like the one that Lapid proposed qualifies as\na \"dwelling\" within the meaning of the statute, see id. at\n1102.\n\nA. Did Lapid Demonstrate That the Accommodations\n       it Requested Were Necessary to Afford Elderly\n       Handicapped Persons an Equal Opportunity to Use\n       and Enjoy Housing?\n\nAs noted above, we have not previously addressed the\n\"necessity\" and \"equal opportunity\" factors of a\nS 3604(f)(3)(B) claim. The Courts of Appeals that have\nprovided the most discussion of the meaning of these terms\nin the FHAA are the Sixth and Fourth Circuits. The key to\ntheir analysis is that the plaintiff in an FHAA reasonable\naccommodations case must establish a nexus between the\naccommodations that he or she is requesting, and their\nnecessity for providing handicapped individuals an\"equal\nopportunity\" to use and enjoy housing.\n\nIn Smith & Lee Associates, Inc. v. City of Taylor, 102 F.3d\n781 (6th Cir. 1996), an FHAA challenge by a residential\nfacility for Alzheimer's patients to the city's denial of its\napplication to expand its facility from 6 to 12 patients, the\nSixth Circuit discussed the meaning of \"necessity\" and\n\"equal opportunity\" in S 3604(f)(3)(B). Turning first to the\nmeaning of \"equal opportunity,\" the court cited the House\nReport on the Act, which states that the FHAA was\ndesigned to \" `end the unnecessary exclusion of persons\nwith handicaps from the American mainstream.' \" 102 F.3d\nat 794 (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 711, 100th Cong., 2d Sess.\n18, reprinted in 1988 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2173, 2179). From this,\nthe court concluded that the FHAA defines \"equal\nopportunity . . . [to] giv[e] handicapped individuals the right\nto choose to live in single-family neighborhoods, for that\nright serves to end the exclusion of handicapped\nindividuals from the American mainstream.\" Id . at 794-95;\nsee also Bryant Woods Inn, Inc. v. Howard County, 911 F.\nSupp. 918, 946 (D. Md. 1996) (\"[T]he Act prohibits local\ngovernments from applying land use regulations in a\nmanner that will exclude people with disabilities entirely\nfrom zoning neighborhoods, particularly residential\nneighborhoods, or that will give disabled people less\n\n                                25\n\fopportunity to live in certain neighborhoods than people\nwithout disabilities.\"), aff 'd 124 F.3d 597 (4th Cir. 1997).\n\nNext turning to the meaning of \"necessary,\" the Smith &\nLee court concluded that in order to show that a requested\naccommodation is \"necessary\" plaintiffs \"must show that,\nbut for the accommodation, they likely will be denied an\nequal opportunity to enjoy the housing of their choice.\" 102\nF.3d at 795. The Fourth Circuit also defined the word\n\"necessary\" to require a link between the proposed\naccommodation and the \"equal opportunity\" in question:\n\n       The \"necessary\" element . . . requires the\n       demonstration of a direct linkage between the proposed\n       accommodation and the \"equal opportunity\" to be\n       provided to the handicapped person. This requirement\n       has attributes of a causation requirement. And if the\n       proposed accommodation provides no direct\n       amelioration of a disability's effect, it cannot be said to\n       be \"necessary.\"\n\nBryant Woods Inn, 124 F.3d at 604.\n\nOther courts have also recognized that the equal\nopportunity to live in a residential zone is valid under\nS 3604(f)(3)(B). See, e.g., Smith & Lee Assocs., 102 F.3d at\n795 (\"[E]lderly disabled citizens have a right to live in [a\ntown's] single-family neighborhoods.\"). We agree. The \"equal\nopportunity\" that Lapid seeks to provide here is the\nopportunity for handicapped persons to live in a single-\nfamily residential neighborhood. Most of the\naccommodations that Lapid sought are geared toward\ngetting exceptions from the stringent zoning requirements\nof Scotch Plains's R-1 zone.\n\nWith respect to the use variance, it is clear that Lapid\ndemonstrated that a use variance was necessary to achieve\nan equal opportunity for the elderly handicapped to live in\na residential area of Scotch Plains. This is true almost by\ndefinition. The elderly handicapped who need skilled\nnursing care usually are not able to live in their own\nhouses. They must live in some sort of institutional setting\nin order to receive the assistance or health care that they\nneed. No institutional health care facilities are permitted\nwithout a use variance in the neighborhoods zoned R-1\n\n                               26\n\fresidential in Scotch Plains. Therefore, a use variance is\nnecessary for the elderly handicapped to have an equal\nopportunity to live in a residential area of Scotch Plains.\nLapid's experts were explicit that one of the objectives of the\nproposed Facility was to allow the elderly to live in a\npredominately single-family residential zone. Dr. Stephen\nCrystal, Lapid's gerontologist, expert gave the following\nanswer to a question that Lapid's lawyer asked him at one\nof the Board's public hearings:\n\n       Atty. Butler: \". . . Dr. Crystal, generally in your\n       professional opinion, is it appropriate to site an\n       assisted living nursing home in a residential zone?\"\n\n       . . . .\n\n       Dr. Crystal: \"There has been a lot of emphasis on long-\n       term care, in trying to normalize long-term care,[and]\n       bring[ing] people as much as possible into settings\n       where they feel they are part of the mainstream and\n       they feel they are not segregated. And I believe that's a\n       benefit.\"\n\nWhile we think it clear that the use variance that Lapid\nrequested was necessary to provide the elderly handicapped\nan equal opportunity to live in a residential neighborhood,\nit is a much closer question whether Lapid established that\nthe particular features of the site plan that it requested\nwere necessary to provide the elderly handicapped an equal\nopportunity to live in a residential area of Scotch Plains. All\nof the Board's site-plan-specific objections really seem to\nboil down to the objection that the Facility (both the\nbuilding and the number of residents it would house) would\nbe too large for the site on which it was proposed and for\nthe surrounding neighborhood. A strict interpretation of the\n\"necessity\" requirements of S 3604(f)(3)(B) would require\nLapid to show that a building of the size that it proposed is\nrequired to provide the handicapped an equal opportunity\nto live in a residential neighborhood.\n\nCourts that have taken   this approach have required a\nplaintiff to show that   the size of the proposed facility either\nwould be necessary for   the facility's financial viability (and\ntherefore necessary to   give the handicapped an equal\nopportunity to live in   a residential neighborhood) or would\n\n                                 27\n\fserve a therapeutic purpose, (and would therefore be\nnecessary to ameliorate an effect of the handicap). See\nBryant Woods Inn, 124 F.3d at 605 (concluding that the\nplaintiff had failed to demonstrate why expanding its group\nhome was necessary other than it would increase its\nprofits, even though it was already making a sustaining\nprofit); Smith & Lee Assocs., 102 F.3d at 788 (holding that\nthe test to determine whether expansion of a group home\nwas financially necessary was not whether \"a particular\nprofit-making company needs such an accommodation,\nbut, rather do businesses as a whole need this\naccommodation\") (citation and internal quotation marks\nomitted); see also Brandt v. Village of Chebanse , 82 F.3d\n172, 174 (7th Cir. 1996) (noting that \"some minimum size\nmay be essential to the success\" of group care facilities). We\nagree that the FHAA requires Lapid to show that the size of\nits proposed Facility is required to make it financially viable\nor medically effective.\n\nLapid presented some evidence on the therapeutic value\nserved by the scale of its group home. Dr. Crystal, the\ngerontologist, testified that assisted living facilities above a\ncertain size were less desirable from a therapeutic\nstandpoint, and opined that he had observed that care\nfacilities that contained between 80 and 100 beds\"seem to\nwork very well.\" Dr. Crystal did not testify, however, that\ncare facilities for the elderly that are smaller than the\nproposed facility are unable to provide the range of care\nrequired or that it would be economically infeasible to\noperate a smaller facility. We therefore do not think that on\nthe basis of Dr. Crystal's testimony regarding the\ntherapeutic effectiveness of facilities of the size that Lapid\nwas proposing, a reasonable jury could find that Lapid had\nshown that the specific features of its proposed facility (its\nsize in particular) were \"necessary to afford[handicapped]\n. . . person[s] [an] equal opportunity\" to live in a residential\nneighborhood in Scotch Plains. 42 U.S.C. S 3604(f)(3)(B).8\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n8. Lapid also asserts that it has necessarily shown that its requested\naccommodations were necessary because it was issued a Certificate of\nNeed (\"C.O.N.,\" i.e., a license), by the New Jersey Department of Health\nand Senior Services. Developers of healthcare facilities such as the one\n\n                               28\n\fBut even if Lapid had presented sufficient evidence to\ncreate a triable issue of fact on whether the proposed\nfacility was \"necessary to afford [handicapped] . . . person[s]\n[an] equal opportunity\" to live in a residential neighborhood\nin Scotch Plains, S 3604(f)(3)(B), the municipal defendants\nwould be entitled to summary judgment on the alternative\nground that the requested accommodations were\nunreasonable, which we explain below.\n\nB. Did the Board Demonstrate That the Requested\nAccommodations Were Unreasonable?\n\nIn Hovsons, we established the legal framework for\ndetermining whether a requested accommodation is\n\"reasonable\" under 42 U.S.C. S 3604(f)(3)(B). We held that\nin order to \"establish that the accommodation proffered by\n[the applicant] was not reasonable, [the municipality] [i]s\nrequired to prove that it could not have granted the\nvariance without:\" (1) \"imposing undue financial and\nadministrative burdens;\" (2) \"imposing an`undue hardship'\nupon the Township;\" or (3) \"requiring a fundamental\nalteration in the nature of the [zoning] program.\" Hovsons,\n89 F.3d at 1104 (internal citations and quotation marks\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nthat Lapid proposed are required to apply for Certificates of Need\npursuant to N.J.S.A. 26:2H-7. The municipal defendants argue that the\nC.O.N. is irrelevant to whether the proposed Facility is necessary under\nthe FHAA because (1) the issuance of a C.O.N. by the DHSS \"expresses\nno specific determination by the Department of Health of the need for\nany particular proposed facility\"; and (2) the particular C.O.N. that\nLapid\nwas issued was initially designated for a facility in Westfield, New\nJersey,\nand therefore has no bearing on a determination of Scotch Plains's need\nfor a nursing home.\n\nWe agree with the Township that the State's issuance of the C.O.N. to\nLapid is not material to the question whether the Facility that it\nproposed is \"necessary\" to provide an \"equal opportunity\" for the elderly\nhandicapped to use housing in Scotch Plains. Even assuming that Lapid\nis correct that the DHSS certificate represents the State of New Jersey's\nconclusion that Union County is in need of additional assisted living and\nskilled nursing facilities, that alone does not establish a nexus between\nthe requested accommodations, and their necessity to create an equal\nopportunity for the handicapped.\n\n                               29\n\fomitted). We cautioned that this inquiry is \"highly fact-\nspecific, requiring a case-by-case determination.\" Id.\n(quoting United States v. Cal. Mobile Home Park Mgmt. Co.,\n29 F.3d 1413, 1418 (9th Cir. 1994)). We also noted that\n\"[w]e must review the reasonable accommodations\nrequirement `in light of two countervailing legislative\nconcerns: (1) effectuation of the statute's objectives of\nassisting the handicapped; and (2) the need to impose\nreasonable boundaries in accomplishing this purpose.' \" Id.\n(quoting Americans Disabled For Accessible Pub. Transp.\n(ADAPT) v. Skinner, 881 F.2d 1184, 1191 (3d Cir. 1989) (en\nbanc)). Thus, the question we face is whether, taking the\nevidence in the light most favorable to Lapid, there remains\na genuine dispute as to whether there was sufficient\nevidence before the Board that Lapid's requested\naccommodations (i.e., the variance and site plan\napplications for the proposed Facility) were unreasonable.\n\nThe municipal defendants in this case argue that certain\nfeatures of Lapid's proposed Facility that resulted from its\nexcessive size and the fact that approximately two acres at\nthe back of the lot (the whole lot was 4.17 acres) were\nunusable because they were covered with protected\nwetlands shows that the plan would have imposed an\n\"undue hardship\" on the Township, and that it would have\n\"required a fundamental alteration\" in the nature of the\nTownship's zoning program. Hovsons, 89 F.3d at 1104. The\nmunicipal defendants point to two categories of objections\nto the site plan that they identified during the hearing\nprocess as evidence that the accommodations that Lapid\nrequested (in the form of the site plan and non-use\nvariances) were unreasonable (i.e., that they would have\nimposed an \"undue hardship upon the Township,\" or that\nthey would have required the Township to \"fundamentally\nalter\" its zoning program, see Hovsons, 89 F.3d at 1104).\n\nThe two main categories that the Board identified are (1)\ntraffic safety issues (including traffic movement within the\nparking lot, increased traffic on Martine Avenue, and safety\nof ingress and egress from the parking lot); and (2)\ninadequate access for emergency vehicles. We think that\nthe Board raised serious and legitimate concerns about\nthese issues and that Lapid failed to rebut these concerns\n\n                               30\n\for to account for them by altering its proposed plan, and\nthat therefore summary judgment for the defendants was\nproper on the reasonable accommodations claim. To help\ndescribe these concerns, we set forth the proposed site plan\nthat Lapid presented to the Board at the March 24 meeting.\n\n(see next page)\n\n                               31\n\fID: Graphic Map\n\n                  32\n\f1. Traffic Safety Concerns\n\nThe municipal defendants flag several different concerns\nregarding traffic safety issues that they say show that the\nsite plan that Lapid proposed was unreasonable. Several of\nthe criticisms that the Board's experts presented on the\ntraffic safety issues center on potential hazards at the point\nof ingress and egress from the Facility's proposed parking\nlot, particularly the fact that the entrance to the parking lot\nrequires a 180 degree turn for cars turning right and a\nsharp turn across oncoming cars for cars turning left. Both\nHarold Maltz, the Board's traffic consultant, and Paul\nFerriero, the Board's engineer, opined that the turns into\nthe parking lot were too sharp and would force cars to\nmake multiple-point \"K turns\" that would disrupt the flow\nof traffic into and out of the Facility's parking lot and would\nincrease the likelihood of an accident.\n\nMaltz stated that \"a vehicle coming south on Martine\n[Avenue] making a right, [would] essentially [be required to\nmake] a hundred and eighty degree turn to turn into the\nsite, . . . [and the vehicle would have] to be able to make\nanother hundred and eighty degree turn to drop off a\npassenger at the main entrance.\" Ferriero commented that\nin order to make the two sharp turns that a car must make\nin order to reach the passenger drop off area, a driver\nwould have to be \"very familiar with the site or have\nplanned in advance.\" Similarly, Maltz predicted in his\nwritten report that a car attempting to make a right turn\nafter entering the parking lot would tend to stray into the\nlane of oncoming traffic (due to the tight 180 degree turn\nthat is required), thereby increasing the likelihood of an\naccident.\n\nThe Board's experts also predicted that the defects in the\npoint of ingress/egress would increase the risk of an\naccident happening on Martine Avenue. Sergeant James\nRau, the police department's director of traffic safety,\npredicted that the difficult turn-in site and its closeness to\nthe intersection of Martine Avenue and West Broad Street\nwould cause cars turning into the Facility to pause for\nlonger than normal. He concluded that this would increase\nthe likelihood of accidents. Rau also stated in his report\nthat drivers seeking to go south on Martine Avenue through\n\n                               33\n\fa green light at the intersection of Martine and West Broad\ncould be forced into the right lane (to go around cars\nwaiting to turn left) and would be forced immediately to\nswitch back into the right lane (to avoid cars turning in to\nthe Facility's parking lot). This, he concluded, would also\nincrease the likelihood of accidents.\n\nLapid's engineer agreed at the March 4 meeting that\nredesigning the area of ingress/egress was a \"good\nsuggestion,\" but failed to submit a redesigned plan dealing\nwith the traffic safety criticisms regarding ingress/egress.\nLapid also did not point to any information in the record\nthat contradicts the Board's experts' opinions that the\ndesign of the entrance to the Facility's parking lot posed\ntraffic safety hazards.\n\nThe Board's experts also raised concerns about internal\ntraffic safety, i.e., within the Facility's parking lot, especially\nwith respect to delivery trucks that would be forced to go\naround to the loading dock at the south side of the building\nand would then be unlikely to be able to turn around\nwithout backing up a long distance. Both Ferriero and\nMaltz testified that the parking lot's layout would require\ndelivery trucks to back a long way out of the driveway into\nthe parking area in order to turn around and that this\nwould create a situation that was hazardous to public\nsafety. Ferriero commented that \"to leave the[loading area]\nwould require a fairly long backing maneuver across the\npedestrian access to the site.\" Similarly, Maltz observed in\nhis written report to the Board that \"[t]here is no K-turn\nability for trucks readily available from the loading zone or\ndumpster area, except after backing up about 200 feet\naround a curve and across a painted crosswalk.\"\n\nLapid has not pointed to any place in the record where it\ncountered these criticisms. And, although Szalay, Lapid's\ncivil engineer, agreed at the March 4 hearing that it would\nbe a \"good suggestion\" to create a turn-around area for\ntrucks, Lapid did not alter its site plan to account for the\nproblems that the Board's experts flagged.\n\n2. Emergency Vehicle Access\n\nThe Board also identifies its concerns about inadequate\naccess for safety vehicles as an alternative reason why the\n\n                               34\n\fproposed plan would cause an \"undue hardship\" for the\nTownship by requiring it to compromise the safety of its\nresidents. As noted above, there is some dispute about\nwhether Fire Chief Ellis ever gave Lapid adequate\ninformation on the turning radius that was necessary for a\n\"tower ladder\" fire truck to access an emergency vehicle\nlane that was to swing around the back of the building; (the\ninability to drive a tower ladder truck behind the Facility\nwas one of the problems that the Fire Chief identified with\nLapid's plan). See supra note 1. Even if we discount the\ncomments of Fire Chief Ellis, however, several other experts\ntestified before the Board about their concerns that\nemergency vehicles would either be unable to access the\nrear of the building or would be unable to back out once\nthey got there. Lapid presented almost no counter-\ntestimony, and although Lapid's engineer, Szalay, agreed\nthat the narrowness of the access road could be a problem,\nLapid did not amend its site plan to provide a wider access\nway.\n\nIn addition to Ellis, Ferriero and Maltz both flagged the\nissue of emergency vehicle access as a problem with the\nsite plan in both written reports and public testimony.\nFerriero's report of March 3, 1999 stated that:\n\n       The plan shows a fire lane extending to the rear of the\n       building. The centerline radius of this drive is 43.5 feet,\n       which is a minimal radius for access. The difficulty\n       with the fire lane as shown is that exiting the fire lane\n       will require backing a vehicle around this same tight\n       radius with the edge of the drive within two feet of the\n       building. If the vehicle is slightly off track to the inside\n       by starting the turn too early, it will strike the building.\n       If the vehicle is too far to the outside by turning too\n       late or too wide, it will run off the access down a 33%\n       slope.\n\nFerriero's report also pointed out that the emergency\nvehicle access lane would actually be narrowed to around\nseven feet when the sidewalk ramp at the rear of the\nbuilding was fitted with handrails and curbs, as is required\nby the ADA. He concluded that this would be too narrow to\naccommodate any emergency vehicle.\n\n                               35\n\fMaltz, the traffic engineer, provided similar criticisms of\nthe site plan's emergency access way. Maltz echoed\nFerriero's comments about the narrowness of the lane, and\nthe effect of the extension of the handrails into the fire\naccess lane. He also wrote that he had done tests with\nmodels using the turning radius of a standard bus going\naround an access way with the same turning radius and\ndimensions as the one proposed by Lapid. He concluded\nfrom his tests that it \"appears probable\" that a fire truck's\n\"wheels will leave the grass pavers area and proceed down\nthe [adjacent 33%] slope.\"9\n\nSzalay, Lapid's civil engineer, agreed during the Board's\nMarch 4 meeting, that in particular, the presence of the\nhandrails would present a problem. He also agreed that the\nproblem of backing out emergency vehicles from behind the\nbuilding was \"a legitimate issue.\" However, Lapid did not\nrevise its site plan to account for these criticisms regarding\nemergency vehicle access before the final hearing with the\nBoard on March 24, 1999. It seems likely that the wetlands\n(and the required wetland buffer zone), which were located\nclose behind the proposed location for the emergency\naccess lane, were the reason that Lapid did not change its\nsite plan to provide a wider vehicle access lane. In his\nMarch 4 testimony, Szalay admitted that the wetlands\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n9. Lapid suggests that the Board's expressed concerns about the\nTownship's ability to drive a tower ladder truck behind the Facility (due\nto an insufficient turning radius) were pretextual, arguing that residents\nof two-story nursing homes are unlikely candidates for heroic rescues\nfrom ladder trucks. We agree that it makes little sense to require a two-\nstory building that would house residents who are unable to be carried\nout on a ladder during a fire to provide access for tower ladder trucks.\nHowever, the Board's concerns about emergency vehicle access focused\nnot only on the turning radius of the access lane, but also the width of\nthe lane. The Board's experts expressed concern that under Lapid's plan,\nthe lane would be as narrow as seven feet at one point. There is evidence\nin the record that this would prevent all of Scotch Plains's fire vehicles\nfrom accessing the rear of the building (because they are all at least\neight feet wide). Indeed, as noted above, Lapid's engineer agreed that the\npresence of the handrails would present a problem. Therefore, even\ndiscounting the issues regarding the turning radius of the emergency\naccess lane, the Board still raised serious concerns about emergency\nvehicle access that Lapid acknowledged, but did not address.\n\n                               36\n\fposed a substantial constraint to widening the access way.\nNor did Lapid present any evidence that would undermine\nor call into question the Board's experts' opinions on the\nemergency vehicle access route. We agree that with respect\nto its limited safety vehicle access, the site plan would\nimpose the \"undue hardship\" on the Township of\ncompromising the safety of its residents.\n\nTherefore, we conclude that it was proper to grant\nsummary judgment to the Township on the issue of\nwhether it had shown that Lapid's requested\naccommodations with respect to the site plan were\nunreasonable because they would cause an \"undue\nhardship\" on the Township. The Board presented sufficient\nevidence to grant summary judgment in its favor with\nrespect to the site plan approval and non-use variances,\nwhich were sufficient bases for it to deny the entire\napplication.\n\nIV. Was Summary Judgment Proper on the\n       Disparate Impact Claim?\n\nThe plaintiffs also appeal the grant of summary judgment\non their claim that the Township's ordinances have a\ndisparate impact on the handicapped in violation of 42\nU.S.C. S 3604(f). Plaintiffs may make out a claim under the\nFHAA using a theory of disparate impact without providing\nproof of discriminatory intent. Doe v. City of Butler, 892\nF.2d 315, 323 (3d Cir. 1989).\n\nWhen reviewing disparate impact claims brought under\nthe FHAA, we have borrowed from the framework of Title\nVII disparate impact claims. See Resident Advisory Bd. v.\nRizzo, 564 F.2d 126, 148 (3d Cir. 1977); see also\nHuntington Branch, NAACP v. Huntington, 844 F.2d 926,\n934 (2d Cir. 1988), aff 'd 488 U.S. 15 (1988) (per curiam).\nIn order to make a prima facie case of disparate impact\nunder the FHAA, the plaintiff must show that the\nTownship's action had a greater adverse impact on the\nprotected group (in this case the elderly handicapped) than\non others. If the plaintiffs succeed in demonstrating a\nprima facie case, then the burden shifts to the defendant to\nshow that it had a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for\n\n                                37\n\fthe action and that no less discriminatory alternatives were\navailable. See Rizzo, 564 F.2d at 149.\n\nThe District Court found that in this case, the plaintiffs\nfailed to make a prima facie case of disparate impact. The\nDistrict Court relied on the formulation of the elements of\na prima facie case for disparate impact under the FHAA\nthat the Ninth Circuit set forth in Gamble v. City of\nEscondido, 104 F.3d 300 (9th Cir. 1997). There, the court\n\"identified the following elements of an FHA[A] prima facie\ncase under a disparate impact theory: (1) the occurrence of\ncertain outwardly neutral practices, and (2) a significantly\nadverse or disproportionate impact on persons of a\nparticular type produced by the defendant's facially neutral\nacts or practices.\" Id. at 306 (internal quotation marks and\ncitation omitted).\n\nThe only evidence that Lapid cites to support its prima\nfacie case of disparate impact is that Scotch Plains's zoning\nplan designates only one location in the Township for\n\"senior housing.\"10 This location is part of the Township's\nBroadway Redevelopment Plan, which the plaintiff argues is\nlocated in an undesirable location, a light industrial area\nrather than a residential area. Lapid also points out that\nthe town permits no development of senior residences as of\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n10. The District Court allowed the plaintiff to get discovery and rely on\nevidence from outside the administrative record to support its FHAA\ndisparate impact claim. We hold that reviewing courts should limit their\nreview to the administrative record only on reasonable accommodations\nclaims. It was proper for the District Court to allow the plaintiffs to\nrely\non materials from outside the administrative record to support their\ndisparate impact claims. It makes sense that a plaintiff would need\nbroader discovery and more latitude on the evidence that he or she is\nallowed to present in a disparate impact claim than in a failure to make\nreasonable accommodations claim. The first involves demonstrating a\ndiscriminatory pattern resulting from the impact of the municipality's\ndecisions, whereas the latter turns only on information regarding the\nnecessity and reasonableness of the proposed accommodation, all of\nwhich can be presented to a local land use board in the first instance.\nFurthermore, this distinction is consistent with the approach of other\ncourts that have addressed the proper scope of materials reviewed under\nFHAA reasonable accommodations and disparate impact claims. See,\ne.g., United States v. Village of Palatine , 37 F.3d 1230, 1233 n.3 (7th\nCir.\n1994).\n\n                               38\n\fright (that is, the development is not permitted without the\ngrant of a use variance), in any other part of the Township\nbesides the Broadway Redevelopment Area.\n\nAccepting as true Lapid's arguments on these points, we\ndo not believe that they are sufficient to make out a prima\nfacie case. They ignore the fact that under New Jersey law,\ndevelopers of group homes for the handicapped (including\nthe elderly) may apply for use variances as an \"inherently\nbeneficial use\" in any zone. See Smart SMR of N.Y., Inc. v.\nBorough of Fair Lawn Bd. of Adjustment, 704 A.2d 1271,\n1281 (N.J. 1998) (noting that the New Jersey Supreme\nCourt has recognized nursing homes as \"inherently\nbeneficial uses\"). Applicants for an \"inherently beneficial\nuse\" under New Jersey law face a reduced standard for\ndemonstrating that the use qualifies for a use variance (as\nopposed to applicants for commercial use variances). See\nsupra at 16. Therefore, even though Scotch Plains's land\nuse regime affirmatively provides for senior housing in only\none location, that alone does not establish a prima facie\ncase of discriminatory impact, especially in light of the fact\nthat the Township will entertain use variances for elderly\nhousing on a preferential basis in all other locations.\nFurthermore, as the District Court noted, the plaintiff does\nnot present any evidence of a pattern of the town refusing\nto grant variances for housing for the elderly or any other\nconduct or statistics that would evince a disparate impact.\n\nWe also agree with the District Court that even if we were\nto determine that Lapid had demonstrated a prima facie\ncase of disparate impact, it would be appropriate to grant\nsummary judgment on the issue that Scotch Plains has\ndemonstrated that it had non-discriminatory reasons for\ndenying Lapid's site plan application. The test for whether\nthe government has articulated a legitimate bona fide\ngovernmental interest that would support denying the\napplication and that no alternative would serve the interest\nwith less discriminatory effect, see Rizzo at 148-49, is\nsimilar to the test of whether the defendant has\ndemonstrated that the requested accommodation is\n\"unreasonable\" for the purposes of rebutting a claim under\nS 3604(f)(3)(B). The Board has pointed to sufficient evidence\nto show that the requested accommodations were\n\n                               39\n\funreasonable; the same evidence suffices to show a bona\nfide governmental interest in denying Lapid's site plan\napplication.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the order of the\nDistrict Court.\n\nA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n\n                               40\n\f",

(\"Lapid\"), a real estate\ndevelopment firm that unsuccessfully sought approval from\nthe Zoning Board of Adjustment of the Township of Scotch\nPlains, New Jersey (\"the Board\") to build a 95-bed care\nfacility for the elderly, appeals the District Court's grant of\nsummary judgment in favor of the Board and the Township,\ndefendants in Lapid's civil case, challenging their actions\n\n                               2\n\funder the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (\"FHAA\"),\n42 U.S.C. S 3601 et seq. Lapid based its claims in the\nDistrict Court primarily on two separate theories under the\nFHAA. First, Lapid contended that Scotch Plains's zoning\nsystem had a disparate impact on the elderly handicapped\nin violation of 42 U.S.C. S 3604(f). Second, Lapid claimed\nthat the Board failed to \"make reasonable accommodations\"\nin order to facilitate housing for the elderly handicapped in\nviolation of 42 U.S.C. S 3604(f)(3)(B).\n\nLapid's primary contentions on appeal are that: (1)\nbecause the Board failed to engage in the \"interactive\nprocess\" that we have held is required of employers by the\nRehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. S 701 et seq., and\nbecause the Board erroneously denied Lapid's request to\nbifurcate its variance and site plan applications, thereby\ndepriving it of a full enough record, the District Court erred\nby limiting its review to the administrative record on the\nreasonable accommodations claim; and (2) it was error for\nthe District Court to grant summary judgment on both the\nreasonable accommodations and discriminatory impact\nclaims.\n\nWe resolve the first claim adversely to Lapid by declining\nto extend the \"interactive process\" requirement that exists\nin the employer-employee context of the Rehabilitation Act\nto the housing and land use context of the FHAA. We\nconclude that the process was never intended to apply in\nthis context, and would be especially inappropriate to apply\nto local land use boards, which already face detailed\nprocedural requirements under state law. We will also\naffirm the District Court's grant of summary judgment on\nboth the reasonable accommodations and disparate impact\nclaims. Before doing so, we must determine which party\nbears the burden of establishing the various elements of an\nFHAA reasonable accommodations challenge to a local land\nuse board's decision. We resolve this question by adopting\na burden-shifting analysis, in which the plaintiff bears the\ninitial burden of showing that its requested\naccommodations are \"necessary to afford [handicapped]\nperson[s] [an] equal opportunity to use and enjoy a\ndwelling,\" 42 U.S.C. S 3604(f)(3)(B), at which point the\nburden shifts to the defendant to show that the requested\naccommodations are unreasonable.\n\n                               3\n\fIn the present case, we conclude that the plaintiff has\nfailed to produce sufficient evidence that the\naccommodations that it requested were \"necessary\" to\nafford the handicapped an \"equal opportunity\" to housing,\nand that the Board has shown that the requested\naccommodations were unreasonable, largely because of the\nproblems with traffic safety and emergency vehicle access\nthat the proposed Facility was likely to cause. We therefore\naffirm the District Court's grant of summary judgment to\nthe defendants on the reasonable accommodations claim.\nWe also affirm the District Court's judgment on the\ndiscriminatory impact claim, because we agree that Lapid\nhas failed to establish a prima facie case that Scotch\nPlains's ordinances have a discriminatory impact on the\nelderly handicapped.\n\nI. Facts & Procedural History\n\nOn June 9, 1998, Lapid applied to the Zoning Board of\nAdjustment of the Township of Scotch Plains, New Jersey\nfor the variances and site plan approval necessary to build\na long-term care facility for the elderly (\"the Facility\"). The\nproposed Facility included 35 beds in a skilled nursing\nsection, the license for which Lapid wished to transfer from\nits nursing home in nearby Plainfield, New Jersey, and 60\n\"assisted living\" beds, for which Lapid had originally\nreceived a license in Westfield, New Jersey. Lapid proposed\nto build the Facility on two contiguous lots, 1290 and 1310\nMartine Avenue. At the time it applied to the Board, Lapid\nowned one of the lots in question and was under contract\nto purchase the other. The lots, which at the time the suit\nbegan held two single-family houses, would together\nprovide 4.17 acres on which Lapid proposed to build a\n58,034 square foot building (with a footprint of 27,640\nsquare feet). Approximately 45% of the lots, or 1.9 acres,\nwas covered by freshwater wetlands and wetland transition\nareas as defined by New Jersey's Freshwater Wetland\nProtection Act, N.J.S.A. 13:9B-1 et seq., and was therefore\nnot available for construction.\n\nThe Martine Avenue lots are located in an area that is\nzoned R-1 under Scotch Plains's 1976 Master Plan. The R-\n1 zone is designated to permit only single-family houses on\n\n                                4\n\flarge lots (40,000 square feet or more -- about an acre),\nwith wide street frontage (a minimum width of 160 feet).\nHowever, several institutional uses exist in the R-1 zone\naround the lots where Lapid proposed to develop the\nFacility. These include a synagogue, a high school, a YMCA,\nand a country club.\n\nIn order to get approval to build the Facility, Lapid\nneeded the Board to grant several variances, which it\napplied for on June 9, 1998. Lapid's application requested\nthree approvals from the Board. First, because the land use\nthat Lapid proposed (i.e., a residential care facility for the\nelderly), did not fit within the uses permitted in an R-1\nzone, Lapid asked for a use variance pursuant to N.J.S.A.\n40:55D-70(d). Second, Lapid requested three non-use\nvariances pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70(c). These sought\npermission to: (1) construct a parking lot in front of the\nbuilding; (2) build a fence in excess of four feet in height;\nand (3) place a freestanding sign in front of the building. All\nof these are prohibited in residential areas and require a\nvariance. Third, Lapid sought approval for its site plan.\n\nThe Board held four public hearings on Lapid's\napplication -- on February 4, March 4, March 15, and\nMarch 24, 1999. Lapid presented testimony from various\nexperts at these meetings, including Julius Szalay, an\nengineer; Stephen Crystal, a gerontologist; Peter Steck, a\nplanner; David Horner, a traffic consultant; and Joseph\nMartin, a real estate appraiser. The Board received written\nreports from the Township's experts, Susan Kimball, a\nplanner; Paul Ferriero, an engineer; Harold Maltz, a traffic\nconsultant; Fire Chief Jonathan Ellis; Police Chief Thomas\nO'Brien; and Sergeant James Rau, the head of the police\ndepartment's traffic safety bureau. Several of these officials\nalso testified at the Board's public hearings.\n\nLapid's engineer made multiple amendments to the site\nplan in order to address the concerns that the Board and\nits experts raised. In particular, these concerns focused on\nthe layout of the parking lot and its effect on traffic safety\nboth within the Facility's lot and at the point of ingress and\negress on Martine Avenue, as well as on the access that\nemergency vehicles would have to the rear of the building.\nIn order to address the issues of emergency vehicle access,\n\n                               5\n\fLapid's planner sought to meet with the Township's fire\nchief beginning on March 10, 1999, but was unable to do\nso until March 22, two days before the Board's final\nmeeting at which it considered Lapid's variance and site\nplan applications.1 Lapid did not address the fire chief 's\nlatest concerns in a revised site plan prior to the March 24\nmeeting, and it requested bifurcation of its applications,\ni.e., it sought a decision on its variance application on\nMarch 24, but requested the Board's approval for an\nextension on its site plan application. The Board denied\nLapid's request to bifurcate, and denied the entire\napplication on the record before it at the March 24 meeting.\n\nThe Board then issued a written denial of Lapid's\napplications. The Board cited the following concerns as its\nreasons for denying the variances and site plan: (1) a\nnegative impact on the municipal zoning plan (i.e., siting a\ncommercial use in the R-1 zone); (2) traffic safety concerns,\nincluding increased traffic on Martine Avenue and hazards\nresulting from ingress and egress from the Facility's lot; (3)\na substantial portion of the site contained wetlands; and (4)\ninsufficient access for emergency and fire vehicles.\n\nLapid then filed a complaint in the District Court against\nthe Board, the Township of Scotch Plains (together,\"the\nmunicipal defendants\"), Alta Rose, the person from whom\nLapid had contracted to purchase the property at 1310\nMartine Avenue, and her daughter Barbara Horev, who held\na durable power of attorney for Rose's benefit. 2 The\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. When Lapid's representatives finally met with Fire Chief Ellis, he was\nunable to give them specific details regarding the turning radius required\nby the department's largest trucks, in particular, the \"tower ladder\"\ntruck. Ellis had previously raised the concern that the emergency vehicle\naccess lane that Lapid proposed could not accommodate the tower\nladder truck.\n\n2. On March 31, 1999, Rose, through her daughter, Horev, terminated\nher contract with Lapid. On April 29, 1999, Rose filed suit in New Jersey\nSuperior Court, Chancery Division, seeking a declaratory judgment that\nthe termination was valid. The Superior Court ruled in her favor. Lapid\nappealed this decision, but withdrew its appeal on June 15, 2000, at\nwhich point the New Jersey Appellate Division entered an order\ndismissing the appeal. The District Court in this case dismissed Lapid's\n\n                               6\n\fcomplaint alleged that: (1) the Board's denial of Lapid's\napplication for variances and site plan approval violated the\nFHAA's requirement that municipalities \"make reasonable\naccommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services,\nwhen such accommodations may be necessary to afford\n[handicapped] person[s] [an] equal opportunity to use and\nenjoy\" housing, 42 U.S.C. S 3604(f)(3)(B); (2) the Township's\nzoning ordinances violated the FHAA, S 3604(f), by having\nan adverse disparate impact on the elderly handicapped; (3)\nthe denial violated the New Jersey Constitution and New\nJersey's Municipal Land Use Law (MLUL), N.J.S.A. 40:55D-\n1 et seq.; (4) the denial violated the Equal Protection and\nDue Process clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the\nU.S. Constitution, and article I, section I of the New Jersey\nConstitution; and (5) Rose and Horev violated their\ncontractual obligations.3\n\nFollowing discovery, the municipal defendants moved for\nsummary judgment, which the District Court granted as to\nall counts. Lapid raises three questions on appeal: (1)\nwhether the District Court erred by limiting its review of the\nreasonable accommodations claim to the materials that\nwere before the Board (i.e., whether the District Court\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nclaims against Rose and Horev as a result of the state court decision,\nand Lapid does not appeal the dismissal. Rose subsequently sold her\nproperty to the adjacent YMCA, and therefore Lapid seeks only punitive\nand compensatory damages, and declaratory judgment that its rights\nwere violated (not an order directing the Board to approve its specific\nsite\nplan), because it cannot develop the Facility without the land that Rose\nsold to the YMCA.\n\n3. Plaintiffs may bring three different types of claims against municipal\nland use authorities under the FHAA: (1) intentional discrimination\nclaims (also called disparate treatment claims); (2) disparate impact\nclaims; and (3) claims that the municipal authority failed to \"make\nreasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services,\nwhen such accommodations may be necessary to afford[handicapped]\nperson[s] [an] equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.\" 42 U.S.C.\nS 3604(f)(3)(B); see also Gamble v.

S 3604.\n\nLapid contends that by denying its variance and site plan\napplications, the Board refused to make reasonable\naccommodations to facilitate the construction of housing\nfor the elderly handicapped, thereby violating the FHAA.\nBefore addressing the question whether summary judgment\nwas proper on the reasonable accommodations claim, we\nmust first address the proper scope of the record on review\nwhen hearing a reasonable accommodations challenge to a\nlocal land use decision brought under the FHAA, and the\nburdens of proof applicable to such a challenge.\n\nA. Was it Error for the District Court to\n       Limit its Review to the Materials That Were\n       Before the Board?\n\nLapid submits that the District Court erred by limiting its\nreview to the materials that were in the administrative\nrecord before the Board. Lapid asked the District Court for\npermission to supplement the administrative record for the\npurpose of litigating its reasonable accommodations claim,\nbut the Court refused, holding that it \"must review the\n\n                               9\n\fZoning Board's decision based solely on the record below.\"\nLapid's argument that it was error for the District Court to\nlimit its review to the materials that were before the Board\nis grounded on its contentions that the Board and its\nexperts failed to engage in an \"informal interactive process\"\nwith Lapid and its engineer, and that it committed\nprocedural error by refusing to allow Lapid to bifurcate its\nvariance and site plan applications. Lapid contends that\nwhen a local land use board fails to engage in such a\nprocess, a court reviewing an FHAA challenge to the local\nboard's decision should allow the plaintiff to supplement\nthe administrative record.\n\nLapid points to two sources for the \"interactive process\"\nrequirement that it suggests exists. First, Lapid argues that\nbecause the reasonable accommodations provision in the\nFHAA is modeled on the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29\nU.S.C. S 701 et seq., a duty of the Board to communicate\nand cooperate in good faith should be imported from this\ncourt's Rehabilitation Act jurisprudence and grafted onto\nour FHAA jurisprudence. Second, Lapid argues that\"New\nJersey law . . . requires a similar interactive process.\" In\nview of these contentions, we must address the questions:\n(1) whether the District Court reached the correct legal\nconclusion that courts reviewing FHAA reasonable\naccommodations challenges to zoning board decisions\nshould ordinarily limit their review to the record before the\nzoning board; and (2) whether there is an additional\n\"interactive process\" requirement, which the Board in this\ncase failed to meet, that would require a reviewing court to\nlook outside the administrative record.\n\n1. Should a Court Reviewing an FHAA Reasonable\nAccommodations Challenge to an Adverse Decision\nfrom a Local Land Use Board Limit Its Review\nto the Administrative Record?\n\nAlthough we have not previously addressed the issue of\nthe proper scope of review for a federal court reviewing an\nFHAA reasonable accommodations challenge to a decision\nof a local land use board, we are convinced that federal\ncourts should limit their review to the materials that were\npresented to the local land use board, except in\n\n                               10\n\fcircumstances where the board prevents applicants from\npresenting sufficient information.\n\nTo support its conclusion that a reviewing court should\nnot look outside the record when reviewing an FHAA\nreasonable accommodations challenge to a local land use\ndecision, the District Court cited Keys Youth Services, Inc.\nv.

In Keys Youth\nServices, a nonprofit organization (Keys) sought a variance\nthat it needed to establish a group home in a single-family\nhome in Olathe, Kansas for ten youths who had been\nabused, neglected, or abandoned. After the local land use\nboard twice denied Keys's application for a variance, Keys\nsued in federal court, alleging that the board had violated\nthe FHAA's reasonable accommodations requirement when\nit refused to grant the variance. The district court granted\njudgment as a matter of law to the City of Olathe on the\nreasonable accommodations claim because it found that\nKeys had failed to present evidence to the local zoning\nboard that the requested accommodation was necessary.\nWhile the court concluded that Keys might have been able\nto show that a minimum of 10 residents was required for\nits group home's financial viability, it found that Keys had\nfailed to present any evidence of this necessity to the local\nzoning board.\n\nThe Tenth Circuit affirmed the district court's judgment\non the reasonable accommodations claim based \"on the\nprinciple that Olathe cannot be liable for refusing to grant\na reasonable and necessary accommodation if the City\nnever knew the accommodation was in fact necessary.\"\nKeys Youth Services, 248 F.3d at 1275. The court held that\nplaintiffs should be required to present all of the evidence\nthey have that would justify why an accommodation is\nnecessary under the FHAA to the local land use board, and\nthat a reviewing court should not look outside the\nadministrative record.\n\nThe Fourth Circuit adopted the same position in Bryant\nWoods Inn, Inc. v. Howard County, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"746237\"><a href=\"/opinion/746237/bryant-woods-inn-incorporated-v-howard-county-maryland-howard-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">597</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (4th Cir.\n1997), an FHAA reasonable accommodations challenge\nbrought by a non-profit group home for adults suffering\n\n                               11\n\ffrom Alzheimer's Disease that was seeking to expand its\nnumber of residents from 8 to 15. In Bryant Woods, the\ncourt refused to look beyond the administrative record and\naffirmed the district court's grant of summary judgment in\nfavor of Howard County because the non-profit group had\nfailed to present evidence to the local land use board that\nthe expansion was \"necessary\" within the meaning of the\nFHAA. Id. at 605-06.\n\nWe join the Tenth and Fourth Circuits in holding that\ncourts hearing reasonable accommodations challenges\nshould ordinarily limit their review to the administrative\nrecord. This rule permits local land use boards to have the\ninitial opportunity to provide reasonable accommodations\nto facilitate housing for the handicapped; it also comports\nwith the tradition in American law that land use decisions\nare quintessentially local in nature.

In the cases where district courts heard FHAA claims\nwithout requiring the plaintiff to have first sought a variance with a\nlocal\nland use authority, the reviewing court necessarily had to consider\nmaterials from outside the nonexistent administrative record.\n\nAlthough we are not bound by the district court cases cited above,\nincluding the case that we summarily affirmed, (summary affirmances\nare non-precedential, see 3d Cir.

In particular, Lapid argues that it\nhad a statutory right to bifurcate its applications at any\npoint during the application review procedure pursuant to\nN.J.S.A. 40:55D-76(b), which provides that \"[t]he developer\nmay elect to submit a separate application requesting\napproval of the variance and a subsequent application for\nany required approval of a subdivision, site plan or\nconditional use.\" Therefore, contends Lapid, the District\nCourt should have granted Lapid's request to supplement\nthe administrative record.\n\nThe Board responds that its denial of Lapid's variance\nand site plan applications at the March 24 meeting was\nmerely the result of Lapid's refusal to consent to an\nextension on both applications, which it had the power to\ndo pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-76(c). The Board further\nsubmits that even if it had granted the request to bifurcate,\nit could not have meaningfully evaluated Lapid's variance\napplication without reference to the specific problems that\nthe Board had identified with the site plan application. In\nother words, the Board argues that Lapid essentially forced\nit to review its site plan application as it existed at the\nMarch 24 meeting by not consenting to an extension on\nboth the variance and site plan applications. Therefore, the\nargument continues, Lapid cannot now complain that the\nBoard prevented it from presenting all of the information\nnecessary to support its reasonable accommodations claim.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nfirst sought a variance from the local land use board: (1) if the claim\nwere a challenge to the variance application procedure itself; and (2) if\nthe variance application process was demonstrably futile. Id. at 1234.\nThe Village of Palatine court also limited the ripeness rule that it\nformed\nto reasonable accommodations claims and noted that\"if the plaintiff 's\nclaim were of discriminatory intent, rather than failure to make a\nreasonable accommodation, th[e] claim might well be presently ripe even\nthough [the plaintiff] has not sought a special use approval.\" Id. at 1233\nn.3. The Eighth Circuit has followed the Seventh Circuit's ripeness rule\nfor FHAA reasonable accommodations claims. See Oxford House-A v. City\nof Univ.

If a zoning board fails to act\nwithin the statutory period, the application is deemed\ngranted by force of law. See N.J.S.A. 40:55D-73(b).\nHowever, an applicant may consent to the extension of this\n120-day period. See N.J.S.A. 40:55D-73(b); N.J.S.A.\n40:55D-76(c). In the present case, Lapid's counsel agreed to\nextend the Board's deadline once to April 1, 1999. Instead\nof offering to extend the deadline again, Lapid sought to\nbifurcate its applications and to require the Board to vote\non the variance application before April 1 or to have it\napproved by force of law.\n\nLapid contends that by requesting to bifurcate its\napplication, it was offering to extend the time limit for the\nsite plan application, and resting its case only on the\nvariance application. Because of New Jersey's statutory\nscheme governing the evaluation of variance applications,\nhowever, we agree that the Board could not have\nmeaningfully considered the variance application without\nreference to the specific problems that it had identified in\nthe site plan application and Lapid's proposed solutions to\nthese problems, and that the offer to extend time for\nconsideration of the site plan application was therefore\nessentially meaningless.\n\nThe section of the MLUL that governs applications for use\nvariances, N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70(d), requires an applicant to\nestablish that certain positive and negative criteria are\nfulfilled in order to have the variance granted. See Smart\nSMR of N.Y., Inc. v.

The \"negative criteria require proof that the variance\n`can be granted without substantial detriment to the public\ngood' and that it will not substantially impair the intent\nand purpose of the zone plan and zoning ordinance.\" Id.\n(quoting N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70(d)). When the variance\napplication seeks permission for an \"inherently beneficial\n\n                               15\n\fuse,\" as it does in this case, the application presumptively\nsatisfies the positive criteria. See Smart SMR , 704 A.2d at\n1278. The New Jersey Supreme Court has instructed that\nwhen evaluating a variance application for an inherently\nbeneficial use, a zoning board must identify and\"weigh the\npositive and negative criteria and determine whether, on\nbalance, the grant of the variance would cause a\nsubstantial detriment to the public good.\" Id. at 1279\n(quoting Sica, 603 A.2d at 37).\n\nThe potential negative criteria relating to the use variance\nthat Lapid sought in this case are directly related to its\nproposed site plan. In denying the application, the Board\nrelied on concerns about traffic safety and emergency\nvehicle access. These issues certainly go to the question\nwhether the variance would cause \"substantial detriment to\nthe public good.\" N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70(d). Further, the size of\nthe proposed Facility, another expressed concern, goes to\nthe question whether granting the variance would\n\"substantially impair the intent and the purpose of the zone\nplan and zoning ordinance.\" N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70(d).\nTherefore, even assuming that it was error to deny the\nbifurcation, we do not see how the Board could have\nconsidered the negative statutory criteria that it was\nrequired to consider without reference to the site plan\napplication as it existed when the Board denied the\napplication.6 Lapid argues that a zoning board can consider\na variance application with stipulated or hypothetical\nconditions on a site plan that will be considered\nsubsequent to the approval of the variance application. To\nbe sure, this may be feasible and desirable in some cases.\nWe do not see, however, how it would have been feasible in\nthe present case.\n\nMost importantly, we agree with the District Court that\n\"based on a reading of the Zoning Board's hearing on the\nmatter, it appears that Lapid-Laurel was given a full and\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6. We do not address the question whether the Board committed\nprocedural error under the MLUL that would require its decision to be\nreversed. That would be an issue appropriate for direct appeal to the\nNew Jersey courts, and, at all events, Lapid did not present it to the\nDistrict Court or this court.\n\n                               16\n\ffair opportunity to present its case before the Zoning Board.\nOver the course of four hearings, Lapid . . . presented five\nwitnesses and various exhibits.\" Indeed, as the District\nCourt noted, \"[p]laintiff 's counsel even conceded at oral\nargument that the Board in no way prevented plaintiff from\npresenting any and all evidence it wished to advance.\"\nTherefore, we do not think that the Board's denial of\nLapid's request to bifurcate its applications shows that the\nBoard prevented Lapid from presenting the necessary\nevidence to support its FHAA claim, nor does it provide a\nsufficient reason for this court to look outside the\nadministrative record when reviewing Lapid's reasonable\naccommodations claim.\n\n2. Does the FHAA or New Jersey Law Require a\n       Local Land Use Board to Engage in an \"Informal\n       Interactive Process\" with a Developer?\n\nLapid argues that the FHAA itself, or alternatively New\nJersey's MLUL, imposes an affirmative obligation on local\nland use boards to engage in an \"informal interactive\nprocess\" with variance applicants. Lapid argues that the\nBoard in this case failed to engage in that process (citing in\nparticular the inability of Lapid's representatives to meet\nwith Fire Chief Ellis when they wanted to do so), and that\ntherefore it is appropriate for a reviewing federal court to\nlook at materials from outside the administrative record.\nFor the following reasons, we do not think that any such\n\"informal interactive process\" requirement exists.\n\nLapid argues that because the language of the FHAA's\nreasonable accommodations requirement was borrowed\nfrom the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. S 701 et seq.,\nand that because this court has held that under the\nRehabilitation Act, a defendant employer has \"a duty to\nmake reasonable efforts to assist [an employee,] to\ncommunicate with him in good faith,\" Mengine v.

The informal interactive\nprocess that S 1630 describes applies specifically to an\nemployer-employee relationship.

To\nsupport this proposition, Lapid cites the following language\nfrom Pizzo Mantin Group v.

The\n       generalized design standards for subdivision\n       ordinances prescribed by the MLUL necessarily invoke\n       the planning board's expertise and familiarity with\n       local conditions and implicate the exercise of discretion\n       by planning boards. . . . That discretion is best\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n7. By imposing an \"informal interactive process\" on land use boards, we\nwould also be compromising the important policies underlying state law\nlimitations on off-the-record contacts between developers and board\nmembers, such as limiting the potential for corruption of local officials.\n\n                               19\n\f       exercised by a process in which planning boards\n       affirmatively interact with developers when reviewing\n       proposed subdivisions.\n\nId. at 98 (emphasis added) (citation omitted). We do not\nagree that Pizzo Mantin imposes a requirement that local\nland use boards engage in an informal interactive process\nwith developers. First, the language in the case says that\nhow a board interacts with a developer is a matter of\ndiscretion that is \"best exercised\" when \"planning boards\naffirmatively interact with developers.\" Id. at 233. This\nlanguage is far from mandatory. Second, it is unclear how,\nif the Scotch Plains zoning board violated New Jersey's\nMLUL in this case, that should bear on the scope of review\nof a federal FHAA claim (unless in violating the MLUL, the\nBoard prevented Lapid from presenting necessary evidence).\nTo the extent that Lapid is attempting to argue its pendent\nstate law claims, it is barred from doing so because it failed\nto raise these state law claims in this appeal.\n\nIt is generally beneficial for land use boards to be\ncooperative with developers, and we do not think that the\nBoard engaged in model behavior toward Lapid in this case.\nNevertheless, we cannot impose an interactive process\nrequirement on the Board as a matter of law.\n\nB. Burdens of Proof for Reasonable\nAccommodations Claims\n\nAs noted above, Lapid relies on 42 U.S.C. S 3604(f)(3)(B)\nfor its claim that the Board failed to make reasonable\naccommodations as required under that section when it\ndenied Lapid's request for variances and site plan approval.\nThe statute provides that it is unlawful \"[t]o discriminate\nagainst any person in the terms, conditions, or privileges of\nsale or rental of a dwelling, or in the provision of services\nor facilities in connection with such dwelling, because of a\nhandicap . . . .\" 42 U.S.C.

We are bound by\nHovsons's holding that the defendant bears the burden of\nshowing that the accommodation is unreasonable, but\nbecause Hovsons did not decide which party has the\nburden of showing that the requested accommodation is\nnecessary to afford handicapped persons an equal\nopportunity to housing, we must decide these issues. We\nthink that under S 3604(f)(3)(B) the plaintiff bears the initial\nburden of showing that the requested accommodation is\nnecessary to afford handicapped persons an equal\nopportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling, at which point the\nburden shifts to the defendant to show that the requested\naccommodation is unreasonable.\n\nWe believe that this approach makes more sense and\nmore closely comports with the likely intent of Congress\nthan the approach of placing the burden on the defendant\nto show both (1) that the requested accommodation is not\nnecessary to create an equal opportunity for housing; and\n(2) that it is unreasonable. We initially note that the\nRehabilitation Act cases on which Hovsons relied provide\nno guidance on the issue of who should bear the burden on\nfactors other than reasonableness.

We think that a burden-shifting approach\nin which the plaintiff would first have the burden of\ndemonstrating that the requested accommodation is\nnecessary to create an equal opportunity, at which point\nthe burden would shift to the defendant to show that the\naccommodation is unreasonable, makes sense from a policy\nstandpoint.\n\nWhile a plaintiff is in the best position to show what is\nnecessary to afford its clients (i.e., the handicapped\npopulation that it wishes to serve) an equal opportunity to\nuse and enjoy housing, a defendant municipality is in the\nbest position to provide evidence concerning what is\nreasonable or unreasonable within the context of its zoning\nscheme. This burden-shifting approach is also consistent\nwith the approach that courts have applied to intentional\ndiscrimination and disparate impact claims brought under\n42 U.S.C. S 3604(f), the two other types of FHAA claims\navailable against local land use boards in addition to\nreasonable accommodations claims. See 148 A.L.R.

Because it makes sense from a policy standpoint\nand is consistent with courts' interpretation of other claims\nbrought under the FHAA, we conclude that Congress\nintended to place on the plaintiff the burden of showing\nthat a requested accommodation is \"necessary\" to give the\nhandicapped an \"equal opportunity\" to use and enjoy\nhousing.\n\nIn sum, we read S 3604(f)(3) to require a burden-shifting\nanalysis in which the initial burden is on the plaintiff to\ndemonstrate that the accommodations that it requested are\n\"necessary to afford [handicapped] persons[an] equal\nopportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling,\" 42 U.S.C.\nS 3604(f)(3)(B), at which point the burden shifts to the\ndefendant to show that the requested accommodations are\nunreasonable.\n\nIII. Was Summary Judgment Proper on the\nReasonable Accommodations Claim?\n\nIn order to evaluate the District Court's grant of\nsummary judgment to the municipal defendants on the\nreasonable accommodations claim, we must determine\nwhether there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding:\n(1) whether the accommodations that Lapid requested were\nnecessary to afford handicapped persons an equal\nopportunity to use and enjoy housing; and, if so (2) whether\nthe accommodations requested were unreasonable.\n\nAs an initial matter, there are two points on which the\nparties agree or that are settled beyond dispute with\nrespect to the reasonable accommodations claim: (1) that\nthe future residents of the Facility that Lapid proposed to\nbuild would be handicapped within the meaning of Section\n3604(f), see Hovsons, 89 F.3d at 1103 n.3; and (2) that a\n\n                               24\n\fnursing home like the one that Lapid proposed qualifies as\na \"dwelling\" within the meaning of the statute, see id. at\n1102.\n\nA. Did Lapid Demonstrate That the Accommodations\n       it Requested Were Necessary to Afford Elderly\n       Handicapped Persons an Equal Opportunity to Use\n       and Enjoy Housing?\n\nAs noted above, we have not previously addressed the\n\"necessity\" and \"equal opportunity\" factors of a\nS 3604(f)(3)(B) claim. The Courts of Appeals that have\nprovided the most discussion of the meaning of these terms\nin the FHAA are the Sixth and Fourth Circuits. The key to\ntheir analysis is that the plaintiff in an FHAA reasonable\naccommodations case must establish a nexus between the\naccommodations that he or she is requesting, and their\nnecessity for providing handicapped individuals an\"equal\nopportunity\" to use and enjoy housing.\n\nIn Smith & Lee Associates, Inc. v.

Turning first to the\nmeaning of \"equal opportunity,\" the court cited the House\nReport on the Act, which states that the FHAA was\ndesigned to \" `end the unnecessary exclusion of persons\nwith handicaps from the American mainstream.' \" 102 F.3d\nat 794 (quoting H.R.

The Fourth Circuit also defined the word\n\"necessary\" to require a link between the proposed\naccommodation and the \"equal opportunity\" in question:\n\n       The \"necessary\" element . . . requires the\n       demonstration of a direct linkage between the proposed\n       accommodation and the \"equal opportunity\" to be\n       provided to the handicapped person. This requirement\n       has attributes of a causation requirement. And if the\n       proposed accommodation provides no direct\n       amelioration of a disability's effect, it cannot be said to\n       be \"necessary.\"\n\nBryant Woods Inn, 124 F.3d at 604.\n\nOther courts have also recognized that the equal\nopportunity to live in a residential zone is valid under\nS 3604(f)(3)(B). See, e.g., Smith & Lee Assocs., 102 F.3d at\n795 (\"[E]lderly disabled citizens have a right to live in [a\ntown's] single-family neighborhoods.\"). We agree. The \"equal\nopportunity\" that Lapid seeks to provide here is the\nopportunity for handicapped persons to live in a single-\nfamily residential neighborhood. Most of the\naccommodations that Lapid sought are geared toward\ngetting exceptions from the stringent zoning requirements\nof Scotch Plains's R-1 zone.\n\nWith respect to the use variance, it is clear that Lapid\ndemonstrated that a use variance was necessary to achieve\nan equal opportunity for the elderly handicapped to live in\na residential area of Scotch Plains. This is true almost by\ndefinition. The elderly handicapped who need skilled\nnursing care usually are not able to live in their own\nhouses. They must live in some sort of institutional setting\nin order to receive the assistance or health care that they\nneed. No institutional health care facilities are permitted\nwithout a use variance in the neighborhoods zoned R-1\n\n                               26\n\fresidential in Scotch Plains. Therefore, a use variance is\nnecessary for the elderly handicapped to have an equal\nopportunity to live in a residential area of Scotch Plains.\nLapid's experts were explicit that one of the objectives of the\nproposed Facility was to allow the elderly to live in a\npredominately single-family residential zone. Dr. Stephen\nCrystal, Lapid's gerontologist, expert gave the following\nanswer to a question that Lapid's lawyer asked him at one\nof the Board's public hearings:\n\n       Atty. Butler: \". . . Dr. Crystal, generally in your\n       professional opinion, is it appropriate to site an\n       assisted living nursing home in a residential zone?\"\n\n       . . . .\n\n       Dr. Crystal: \"There has been a lot of emphasis on long-\n       term care, in trying to normalize long-term care,[and]\n       bring[ing] people as much as possible into settings\n       where they feel they are part of the mainstream and\n       they feel they are not segregated. And I believe that's a\n       benefit.\"\n\nWhile we think it clear that the use variance that Lapid\nrequested was necessary to provide the elderly handicapped\nan equal opportunity to live in a residential neighborhood,\nit is a much closer question whether Lapid established that\nthe particular features of the site plan that it requested\nwere necessary to provide the elderly handicapped an equal\nopportunity to live in a residential area of Scotch Plains. All\nof the Board's site-plan-specific objections really seem to\nboil down to the objection that the Facility (both the\nbuilding and the number of residents it would house) would\nbe too large for the site on which it was proposed and for\nthe surrounding neighborhood. A strict interpretation of the\n\"necessity\" requirements of S 3604(f)(3)(B) would require\nLapid to show that a building of the size that it proposed is\nrequired to provide the handicapped an equal opportunity\nto live in a residential neighborhood.\n\nCourts that have taken   this approach have required a\nplaintiff to show that   the size of the proposed facility either\nwould be necessary for   the facility's financial viability (and\ntherefore necessary to   give the handicapped an equal\nopportunity to live in   a residential neighborhood) or would\n\n                                 27\n\fserve a therapeutic purpose, (and would therefore be\nnecessary to ameliorate an effect of the handicap).

Dr. Crystal, the\ngerontologist, testified that assisted living facilities above a\ncertain size were less desirable from a therapeutic\nstandpoint, and opined that he had observed that care\nfacilities that contained between 80 and 100 beds\"seem to\nwork very well.\" Dr. Crystal did not testify, however, that\ncare facilities for the elderly that are smaller than the\nproposed facility are unable to provide the range of care\nrequired or that it would be economically infeasible to\noperate a smaller facility. We therefore do not think that on\nthe basis of Dr. Crystal's testimony regarding the\ntherapeutic effectiveness of facilities of the size that Lapid\nwas proposing, a reasonable jury could find that Lapid had\nshown that the specific features of its proposed facility (its\nsize in particular) were \"necessary to afford[handicapped]\n. . . person[s] [an] equal opportunity\" to live in a residential\nneighborhood in Scotch Plains. 42 U.S.C. S 3604(f)(3)(B).8\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n8. Lapid also asserts that it has necessarily shown that its requested\naccommodations were necessary because it was issued a Certificate of\nNeed (\"C.O.N.,\" i.e., a license), by the New Jersey Department of Health\nand Senior Services. Developers of healthcare facilities such as the one\n\n                               28\n\fBut even if Lapid had presented sufficient evidence to\ncreate a triable issue of fact on whether the proposed\nfacility was \"necessary to afford [handicapped] . . . person[s]\n[an] equal opportunity\" to live in a residential neighborhood\nin Scotch Plains, S 3604(f)(3)(B), the municipal defendants\nwould be entitled to summary judgment on the alternative\nground that the requested accommodations were\nunreasonable, which we explain below.\n\nB. Did the Board Demonstrate That the Requested\nAccommodations Were Unreasonable?\n\nIn Hovsons, we established the legal framework for\ndetermining whether a requested accommodation is\n\"reasonable\" under 42 U.S.C. S 3604(f)(3)(B). We held that\nin order to \"establish that the accommodation proffered by\n[the applicant] was not reasonable, [the municipality] [i]s\nrequired to prove that it could not have granted the\nvariance without:\" (1) \"imposing undue financial and\nadministrative burdens;\" (2) \"imposing an`undue hardship'\nupon the Township;\" or (3) \"requiring a fundamental\nalteration in the nature of the [zoning] program.\" Hovsons,\n89 F.3d at 1104 (internal citations and quotation marks\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nthat Lapid proposed are required to apply for Certificates of Need\npursuant to N.J.S.A. 26:2H-7. The municipal defendants argue that the\nC.O.N. is irrelevant to whether the proposed Facility is necessary under\nthe FHAA because (1) the issuance of a C.O.N. by the DHSS \"expresses\nno specific determination by the Department of Health of the need for\nany particular proposed facility\"; and (2) the particular C.O.N. that\nLapid\nwas issued was initially designated for a facility in Westfield, New\nJersey,\nand therefore has no bearing on a determination of Scotch Plains's need\nfor a nursing home.\n\nWe agree with the Township that the State's issuance of the C.O.N. to\nLapid is not material to the question whether the Facility that it\nproposed is \"necessary\" to provide an \"equal opportunity\" for the elderly\nhandicapped to use housing in Scotch Plains. Even assuming that Lapid\nis correct that the DHSS certificate represents the State of New Jersey's\nconclusion that Union County is in need of additional assisted living and\nskilled nursing facilities, that alone does not establish a nexus between\nthe requested accommodations, and their necessity to create an equal\nopportunity for the handicapped.\n\n                               29\n\fomitted).

We also noted that\n\"[w]e must review the reasonable accommodations\nrequirement `in light of two countervailing legislative\nconcerns: (1) effectuation of the statute's objectives of\nassisting the handicapped; and (2) the need to impose\nreasonable boundaries in accomplishing this purpose.' \" Id.\n(quoting Americans Disabled For Accessible Pub.

Thus, the question we face is whether, taking the\nevidence in the light most favorable to Lapid, there remains\na genuine dispute as to whether there was sufficient\nevidence before the Board that Lapid's requested\naccommodations (i.e., the variance and site plan\napplications for the proposed Facility) were unreasonable.\n\nThe municipal defendants in this case argue that certain\nfeatures of Lapid's proposed Facility that resulted from its\nexcessive size and the fact that approximately two acres at\nthe back of the lot (the whole lot was 4.17 acres) were\nunusable because they were covered with protected\nwetlands shows that the plan would have imposed an\n\"undue hardship\" on the Township, and that it would have\n\"required a fundamental alteration\" in the nature of the\nTownship's zoning program. Hovsons, 89 F.3d at 1104. The\nmunicipal defendants point to two categories of objections\nto the site plan that they identified during the hearing\nprocess as evidence that the accommodations that Lapid\nrequested (in the form of the site plan and non-use\nvariances) were unreasonable (i.e., that they would have\nimposed an \"undue hardship upon the Township,\" or that\nthey would have required the Township to \"fundamentally\nalter\" its zoning program, see Hovsons, 89 F.3d at 1104).\n\nThe two main categories that the Board identified are (1)\ntraffic safety issues (including traffic movement within the\nparking lot, increased traffic on Martine Avenue, and safety\nof ingress and egress from the parking lot); and (2)\ninadequate access for emergency vehicles. We think that\nthe Board raised serious and legitimate concerns about\nthese issues and that Lapid failed to rebut these concerns\n\n                               30\n\for to account for them by altering its proposed plan, and\nthat therefore summary judgment for the defendants was\nproper on the reasonable accommodations claim. To help\ndescribe these concerns, we set forth the proposed site plan\nthat Lapid presented to the Board at the March 24 meeting.\n\n(see next page)\n\n                               31\n\fID: Graphic Map\n\n                  32\n\f1. Traffic Safety Concerns\n\nThe municipal defendants flag several different concerns\nregarding traffic safety issues that they say show that the\nsite plan that Lapid proposed was unreasonable. Several of\nthe criticisms that the Board's experts presented on the\ntraffic safety issues center on potential hazards at the point\nof ingress and egress from the Facility's proposed parking\nlot, particularly the fact that the entrance to the parking lot\nrequires a 180 degree turn for cars turning right and a\nsharp turn across oncoming cars for cars turning left. Both\nHarold Maltz, the Board's traffic consultant, and Paul\nFerriero, the Board's engineer, opined that the turns into\nthe parking lot were too sharp and would force cars to\nmake multiple-point \"K turns\" that would disrupt the flow\nof traffic into and out of the Facility's parking lot and would\nincrease the likelihood of an accident.\n\nMaltz stated that \"a vehicle coming south on Martine\n[Avenue] making a right, [would] essentially [be required to\nmake] a hundred and eighty degree turn to turn into the\nsite, . . . [and the vehicle would have] to be able to make\nanother hundred and eighty degree turn to drop off a\npassenger at the main entrance.\" Ferriero commented that\nin order to make the two sharp turns that a car must make\nin order to reach the passenger drop off area, a driver\nwould have to be \"very familiar with the site or have\nplanned in advance.\" Similarly, Maltz predicted in his\nwritten report that a car attempting to make a right turn\nafter entering the parking lot would tend to stray into the\nlane of oncoming traffic (due to the tight 180 degree turn\nthat is required), thereby increasing the likelihood of an\naccident.\n\nThe Board's experts also predicted that the defects in the\npoint of ingress/egress would increase the risk of an\naccident happening on Martine Avenue. Sergeant James\nRau, the police department's director of traffic safety,\npredicted that the difficult turn-in site and its closeness to\nthe intersection of Martine Avenue and West Broad Street\nwould cause cars turning into the Facility to pause for\nlonger than normal. He concluded that this would increase\nthe likelihood of accidents. Rau also stated in his report\nthat drivers seeking to go south on Martine Avenue through\n\n                               33\n\fa green light at the intersection of Martine and West Broad\ncould be forced into the right lane (to go around cars\nwaiting to turn left) and would be forced immediately to\nswitch back into the right lane (to avoid cars turning in to\nthe Facility's parking lot). This, he concluded, would also\nincrease the likelihood of accidents.\n\nLapid's engineer agreed at the March 4 meeting that\nredesigning the area of ingress/egress was a \"good\nsuggestion,\" but failed to submit a redesigned plan dealing\nwith the traffic safety criticisms regarding ingress/egress.\nLapid also did not point to any information in the record\nthat contradicts the Board's experts' opinions that the\ndesign of the entrance to the Facility's parking lot posed\ntraffic safety hazards.\n\nThe Board's experts also raised concerns about internal\ntraffic safety, i.e., within the Facility's parking lot, especially\nwith respect to delivery trucks that would be forced to go\naround to the loading dock at the south side of the building\nand would then be unlikely to be able to turn around\nwithout backing up a long distance. Both Ferriero and\nMaltz testified that the parking lot's layout would require\ndelivery trucks to back a long way out of the driveway into\nthe parking area in order to turn around and that this\nwould create a situation that was hazardous to public\nsafety. Ferriero commented that \"to leave the[loading area]\nwould require a fairly long backing maneuver across the\npedestrian access to the site.\" Similarly, Maltz observed in\nhis written report to the Board that \"[t]here is no K-turn\nability for trucks readily available from the loading zone or\ndumpster area, except after backing up about 200 feet\naround a curve and across a painted crosswalk.\"\n\nLapid has not pointed to any place in the record where it\ncountered these criticisms. And, although Szalay, Lapid's\ncivil engineer, agreed at the March 4 hearing that it would\nbe a \"good suggestion\" to create a turn-around area for\ntrucks, Lapid did not alter its site plan to account for the\nproblems that the Board's experts flagged.\n\n2. Emergency Vehicle Access\n\nThe Board also identifies its concerns about inadequate\naccess for safety vehicles as an alternative reason why the\n\n                               34\n\fproposed plan would cause an \"undue hardship\" for the\nTownship by requiring it to compromise the safety of its\nresidents. As noted above, there is some dispute about\nwhether Fire Chief Ellis ever gave Lapid adequate\ninformation on the turning radius that was necessary for a\n\"tower ladder\" fire truck to access an emergency vehicle\nlane that was to swing around the back of the building; (the\ninability to drive a tower ladder truck behind the Facility\nwas one of the problems that the Fire Chief identified with\nLapid's plan). See supra note 1. Even if we discount the\ncomments of Fire Chief Ellis, however, several other experts\ntestified before the Board about their concerns that\nemergency vehicles would either be unable to access the\nrear of the building or would be unable to back out once\nthey got there. Lapid presented almost no counter-\ntestimony, and although Lapid's engineer, Szalay, agreed\nthat the narrowness of the access road could be a problem,\nLapid did not amend its site plan to provide a wider access\nway.\n\nIn addition to Ellis, Ferriero and Maltz both flagged the\nissue of emergency vehicle access as a problem with the\nsite plan in both written reports and public testimony.\nFerriero's report of March 3, 1999 stated that:\n\n       The plan shows a fire lane extending to the rear of the\n       building. The centerline radius of this drive is 43.5 feet,\n       which is a minimal radius for access. The difficulty\n       with the fire lane as shown is that exiting the fire lane\n       will require backing a vehicle around this same tight\n       radius with the edge of the drive within two feet of the\n       building. If the vehicle is slightly off track to the inside\n       by starting the turn too early, it will strike the building.\n       If the vehicle is too far to the outside by turning too\n       late or too wide, it will run off the access down a 33%\n       slope.\n\nFerriero's report also pointed out that the emergency\nvehicle access lane would actually be narrowed to around\nseven feet when the sidewalk ramp at the rear of the\nbuilding was fitted with handrails and curbs, as is required\nby the ADA. He concluded that this would be too narrow to\naccommodate any emergency vehicle.\n\n                               35\n\fMaltz, the traffic engineer, provided similar criticisms of\nthe site plan's emergency access way. Maltz echoed\nFerriero's comments about the narrowness of the lane, and\nthe effect of the extension of the handrails into the fire\naccess lane. He also wrote that he had done tests with\nmodels using the turning radius of a standard bus going\naround an access way with the same turning radius and\ndimensions as the one proposed by Lapid. He concluded\nfrom his tests that it \"appears probable\" that a fire truck's\n\"wheels will leave the grass pavers area and proceed down\nthe [adjacent 33%] slope.\"9\n\nSzalay, Lapid's civil engineer, agreed during the Board's\nMarch 4 meeting, that in particular, the presence of the\nhandrails would present a problem. He also agreed that the\nproblem of backing out emergency vehicles from behind the\nbuilding was \"a legitimate issue.\" However, Lapid did not\nrevise its site plan to account for these criticisms regarding\nemergency vehicle access before the final hearing with the\nBoard on March 24, 1999. It seems likely that the wetlands\n(and the required wetland buffer zone), which were located\nclose behind the proposed location for the emergency\naccess lane, were the reason that Lapid did not change its\nsite plan to provide a wider vehicle access lane. In his\nMarch 4 testimony, Szalay admitted that the wetlands\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n9. Lapid suggests that the Board's expressed concerns about the\nTownship's ability to drive a tower ladder truck behind the Facility (due\nto an insufficient turning radius) were pretextual, arguing that residents\nof two-story nursing homes are unlikely candidates for heroic rescues\nfrom ladder trucks. We agree that it makes little sense to require a two-\nstory building that would house residents who are unable to be carried\nout on a ladder during a fire to provide access for tower ladder trucks.\nHowever, the Board's concerns about emergency vehicle access focused\nnot only on the turning radius of the access lane, but also the width of\nthe lane. The Board's experts expressed concern that under Lapid's plan,\nthe lane would be as narrow as seven feet at one point. There is evidence\nin the record that this would prevent all of Scotch Plains's fire vehicles\nfrom accessing the rear of the building (because they are all at least\neight feet wide). Indeed, as noted above, Lapid's engineer agreed that the\npresence of the handrails would present a problem. Therefore, even\ndiscounting the issues regarding the turning radius of the emergency\naccess lane, the Board still raised serious concerns about emergency\nvehicle access that Lapid acknowledged, but did not address.\n\n                               36\n\fposed a substantial constraint to widening the access way.\nNor did Lapid present any evidence that would undermine\nor call into question the Board's experts' opinions on the\nemergency vehicle access route. We agree that with respect\nto its limited safety vehicle access, the site plan would\nimpose the \"undue hardship\" on the Township of\ncompromising the safety of its residents.\n\nTherefore, we conclude that it was proper to grant\nsummary judgment to the Township on the issue of\nwhether it had shown that Lapid's requested\naccommodations with respect to the site plan were\nunreasonable because they would cause an \"undue\nhardship\" on the Township. The Board presented sufficient\nevidence to grant summary judgment in its favor with\nrespect to the site plan approval and non-use variances,\nwhich were sufficient bases for it to deny the entire\napplication.\n\nIV. Was Summary Judgment Proper on the\n       Disparate Impact Claim?\n\nThe plaintiffs also appeal the grant of summary judgment\non their claim that the Township's ordinances have a\ndisparate impact on the handicapped in violation of 42\nU.S.C. S 3604(f). Plaintiffs may make out a claim under the\nFHAA using a theory of disparate impact without providing\nproof of discriminatory intent. Doe v.

If the plaintiffs succeed in demonstrating a\nprima facie case, then the burden shifts to the defendant to\nshow that it had a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for\n\n                                37\n\fthe action and that no less discriminatory alternatives were\navailable. See Rizzo, 564 F.2d at 149.\n\nThe District Court found that in this case, the plaintiffs\nfailed to make a prima facie case of disparate impact. The\nDistrict Court relied on the formulation of the elements of\na prima facie case for disparate impact under the FHAA\nthat the Ninth Circuit set forth in Gamble v. City of\nEscondido, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"732529\"><a href=\"/opinion/732529/john-gamble-fie-a-gamble-life-care-residences-inc-doing-business-as-oak/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">300</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 1997). There, the court\n\"identified the following elements of an FHA[A] prima facie\ncase under a disparate impact theory: (1) the occurrence of\ncertain outwardly neutral practices, and (2) a significantly\nadverse or disproportionate impact on persons of a\nparticular type produced by the defendant's facially neutral\nacts or practices.\" Id. at 306 (internal quotation marks and\ncitation omitted).\n\nThe only evidence that Lapid cites to support its prima\nfacie case of disparate impact is that Scotch Plains's zoning\nplan designates only one location in the Township for\n\"senior housing.\"10 This location is part of the Township's\nBroadway Redevelopment Plan, which the plaintiff argues is\nlocated in an undesirable location, a light industrial area\nrather than a residential area. Lapid also points out that\nthe town permits no development of senior residences as of\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n10. The District Court allowed the plaintiff to get discovery and rely on\nevidence from outside the administrative record to support its FHAA\ndisparate impact claim. We hold that reviewing courts should limit their\nreview to the administrative record only on reasonable accommodations\nclaims. It was proper for the District Court to allow the plaintiffs to\nrely\non materials from outside the administrative record to support their\ndisparate impact claims. It makes sense that a plaintiff would need\nbroader discovery and more latitude on the evidence that he or she is\nallowed to present in a disparate impact claim than in a failure to make\nreasonable accommodations claim. The first involves demonstrating a\ndiscriminatory pattern resulting from the impact of the municipality's\ndecisions, whereas the latter turns only on information regarding the\nnecessity and reasonableness of the proposed accommodation, all of\nwhich can be presented to a local land use board in the first instance.\nFurthermore, this distinction is consistent with the approach of other\ncourts that have addressed the proper scope of materials reviewed under\nFHAA reasonable accommodations and disparate impact claims. See,\ne.g., United States v. Village of Palatine , </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"679997\"><a href=\"/opinion/679997/united-states-v-village-of-palatine-illinois-matthew-klein-dick-kozdras/\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1230</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1233 n.3 (7th\nCir.\n1994).\n\n                               38\n\fright (that is, the development is not permitted without the\ngrant of a use variance), in any other part of the Township\nbesides the Broadway Redevelopment Area.\n\nAccepting as true Lapid's arguments on these points, we\ndo not believe that they are sufficient to make out a prima\nfacie case. They ignore the fact that under New Jersey law,\ndevelopers of group homes for the handicapped (including\nthe elderly) may apply for use variances as an \"inherently\nbeneficial use\" in any zone. See Smart SMR of N.Y., Inc. v.\nBorough of Fair Lawn Bd. of Adjustment, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1530708\"><a href=\"/opinion/1530708/smart-smr-of-ny-inc-v-fair-lawn-bd-of-adj/\"><span class=\"volume\">704</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1271</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1281 (N.J. 1998) (noting that the New Jersey Supreme\nCourt has recognized nursing homes as \"inherently\nbeneficial uses\"). Applicants for an \"inherently beneficial\nuse\" under New Jersey law face a reduced standard for\ndemonstrating that the use qualifies for a use variance (as\nopposed to applicants for commercial use variances). See\nsupra at 16. Therefore, even though Scotch Plains's land\nuse regime affirmatively provides for senior housing in only\none location, that alone does not establish a prima facie\ncase of discriminatory impact, especially in light of the fact\nthat the Township will entertain use variances for elderly\nhousing on a preferential basis in all other locations.\nFurthermore, as the District Court noted, the plaintiff does\nnot present any evidence of a pattern of the town refusing\nto grant variances for housing for the elderly or any other\nconduct or statistics that would evince a disparate impact.\n\nWe also agree with the District Court that even if we were\nto determine that Lapid had demonstrated a prima facie\ncase of disparate impact, it would be appropriate to grant\nsummary judgment on the issue that Scotch Plains has\ndemonstrated that it had non-discriminatory reasons for\ndenying Lapid's site plan application. The test for whether\nthe government has articulated a legitimate bona fide\ngovernmental interest that would support denying the\napplication and that no alternative would serve the interest\nwith less discriminatory effect, see Rizzo at 148-49, is\nsimilar to the test of whether the defendant has\ndemonstrated that the requested accommodation is\n\"unreasonable\" for the purposes of rebutting a claim under\nS 3604(f)(3)(B). The Board has pointed to sufficient evidence\nto show that the requested accommodations were\n\n                               39\n\funreasonable; the same evidence suffices to show a bona\nfide governmental interest in denying Lapid's site plan\napplication.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the order of the\nDistrict Court.\n\nA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n\n                               40\n\f</pre>",
