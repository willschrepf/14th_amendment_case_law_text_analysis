The district court\n\ndenied Ortiz's request for a permanent injunction and Ortiz\nappealed.   We have jurisdiction over Ortiz's appeal pursuant to\n\n28 U.S.C. § 1291.      Finding no merit to Ortiz's legal arguments,\n\nwe will affirm.\n\n\n\n                                   I\n\n            Pennsylvania law provides that registered voters who\n\nfail to vote for two years shall be purged from the registration\n\nrolls after being provided notice of the same.       25 Pa. Cons.\n\n\n\n                                   2\n\fStat. § 623-40.0   In the summer of 1991, approximately 21 percent\n\nof Philadelphia's registered voters (193,000 voters) were slated\n\n\n\n\n0\n          Section 623-40 provides as follows:\n\n               During each year, the commission shall cause all\n          of the district registers to be examined, and in the\n          case of each registered elector who is not recorded as\n          having voted at any election or primary during the two\n          calendar years immediately preceding, the commission\n          shall send to such elector by mail, at his address\n          appearing upon his registration affidavit, a notice,\n          setting forth that the records of the commission\n          indicate that he has not voted during the two\n          immediately preceding calendar years, and that his\n          registration will be cancelled if he does not vote in\n          the next primary or election or unless he shall,\n          within ten days of the next primary or election, file\n          with the commission, a written request for\n          reinstatement of his registration, signed by him,\n          setting forth his place of residence. A list of the\n          persons to whom such notices shall have been mailed\n          shall be sent promptly to the city chairman of the\n          political party of which the electors were registered\n          as members. At the expiration of the time specified\n          in the notice, the commission shall cause the\n          registration of such elector to be cancelled unless he\n          has filed with the commission a signed request for\n          reinstatement of his registration as above provided.\n          The official registration application card of an\n          elector who has registered may qualify as a\n          reinstatement of his registration or a removal notice.\n          The cancellation of the registration of any such\n          elector for failure to vote during two immediately\n          preceding calendar years shall not affect the right of\n          any such elector to subsequently register in the\n          manner provided by this act.\n\n               Whenever the registration of an elector has been\n          cancelled through error, such elector may petition the\n          commission for reinstatement of his registration not\n          later than the tenth day preceding any primary or\n          election, and after a hearing on said application, if\n          error on the part of the commission is proved, the\n          commission shall reinstate the registration of such\n          elector.\n\n                                 3\n\fto be purged from Philadelphia's registration rolls for failing\n\nto vote.\n\n           On October 25, 1991, Ortiz filed an action alleging\n\nthat the non-voting purge act had a disparate impact on minority\n\nvoters and, thus, violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of\n\n1965, 42 U.S.C. § 1973, the First and Fourteenth Amendments of\n\nthe United States Constitution, and the Pennsylvania Election\n\nLaw, 25 Pa. Cons. Stat. 623-40.       Ortiz sought a judicial\n\ndeclaration that the purge violated the aforementioned\n\nprovisions, as well as an injunction directing the City to\n\nrestore all purged voters to the City's voter registration rolls,\n\nand enjoining the City from any further purging of non-voting,\n\nregistered voters.\n\n           On October 29, 1991, the district court denied Ortiz's\n\nmotion for a preliminary injunction.      No appeal was taken.     One\n\nmonth prior to the November 1992 elections, Ortiz again sought a\n\ntemporary restraining order or preliminary injunction and an\n\nimmediate hearing on the merits.      This request was denied by\n\norder of the district court on October 6, 1992.      Ortiz filed a\n\npetition for writ of mandamus (92-1821) and notices of appeal\n\n(92-1822 and 92-1839) from the district court's order, as well as\n\na motion for injunction pending appeal, a motion for expedited\n\nappeal, and a motion for permanent injunction.      We denied Ortiz's\n\nmotions and petition for writ of mandamus on October 8 and 14,\n\n1992.   Ortiz's appeals were dismissed for failure to prosecute.\n\n             On November 10, 1992, a four-day trial was held to\n\ndetermine whether a permanent injunction should issue.          On June\n\n\n                                  4\n\f     1, 1993, the district court granted judgment in favor of the\n\n       City, denying Ortiz's requested relief.                Ortiz v. City of\n\n     Philadelphia, 824 F. Supp. 514 (E.D. Pa. 1993).                   After making\n\nextensive findings of fact, and recognizing that African-American\n\n    and Latino voters are purged at disproportionately higher rates\n\nthan their white counterparts, id. at 526-31,0 the district court\n\n    held that the purge law did not deprive minority voters of equal\n\n    access to the political process in violation of Section 2.                      Id.\n\n                                      at 539.\n\n                 Ortiz appeals the denial of his Section 2 claim.0\n\n\n\n                                         II\n\n              Ortiz argues that the district court failed to apply\n\nthe correct standard in concluding that he had failed to\n\n0\n          Ortiz's expert testified to the following disparities\nin the rates at which white and minority voters in the City of\nPhiladelphia were slated to be purged, and estimated rates at\nwhich they actually were purged:\n\n                                 Philadelphia Voters\n                     % Slated For Purging / Estimated Purge Rates\n                         Whites                          African-American + Other\n       1989           4.1% / 3.9%                               4.5% / 4.0%\n       1990           8.5% / 7.9%                              11.7% / 11.1%\n       1991          17.3% / 13.2%                             24.7% / 20.8%\n       1992           6.4% / 6.4%                               6.6% / N/A\n0\n            Ortiz has abandoned his claims under the United States\n  Constitution and state law. In addition, we note that Ortiz's\n    complaint was filed with respect to the 1991 election. Of\n course, both the purge preceding that election, and the election\n   itself, have already occurred. Nevertheless, neither of the\nparties have argued that the issues presented on appeal are moot,\n     nor could they so argue, inasmuch as Ortiz's complaint is\n     \"capable of repetition yet evading review.\" Weinstein v.\n                   Bradford, 423 U.S. 147 (1975).\n\n\n                                          5\n\fdemonstrate that the purge statute violated Section 2 of the\n\nVoting Rights Act.   In particular, Ortiz asserts that the\n\ndistrict court erred in finding that he had failed to prove that\n\nthe purge statute caused minority voters to be removed from the\n\nvoter-registration rolls at disparate rates.\n\n\n\n                                A.\n\n          A district court's conclusion that a challenged\n\nelectoral practice has a discriminatory effect is a question of\n\nfact subject to review for clear error, Thornburg v. Gingles, 478\n\nU.S. 30, 79 (1986) (recognizing that determination of whether or\n\nnot political process is equally open to minority voters \"is\n\npeculiarly dependent upon the facts of each case and requires an\n\n'intensely local appraisal of the design and impact' of the\n\ncontested electoral mechanisms\").    The question of which standard\n\n(i.e., which individual factors) a district court should apply in\n\ndetermining whether, under the totality of the circumstances, a\n\nchallenged electoral practice has a discriminatory effect, how-\n\never, presents a question of law subject to plenary review.     Id.\n\nAccord Jenkins v. Red Clay Consolidated School District Board of\nEducation, 4 F.3d 1103, 116-17 (3d Cir. 1993).\n\n\n\n                                B.\n\n          The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was enacted to enforce\n\nthe Fifteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, which\n\nprovides: \"The right of citizens of the United States to vote\n\nshall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any\n\n\n                                6\n\fState on account of race, color, or previous condition of\n\nservitude.\"\n\n          In 1982, Congress amended Section 2 of the Voting\n\nRights Act \"to make clear that certain practices and procedures\n\nthat result in the denial or abridgement of the right to vote are\n\nforbidden even though the absence of proof of discriminatory\n\nintent protects them from constitutional challenge.\"   Chisom v.\n\nRoemer, ___ U.S. ___, 111 S.Ct. 2354, 2358 (1991) (holding that\n\nstate judicial elections are included within the scope of Section\n\n2 of the Voting Rights Act).   That is, \"Congress made clear that\n\na violation of § 2 could be established by proof of\n\ndiscriminatory results alone.\"   Id. at 2368.\n\n          As amended, Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act\n\nprovided as follows:\n               (a) No voting qualification or prerequisite to\n          voting or standard, practice, or procedure shall be\n          imposed or applied by any State or political\n          subdivision in a manner which results in a denial or\n          abridgement of the right of any citizen of the United\n          States to vote on account of race or color, or in\n          contravention of the guarantees set forth in section\n          1973b(f)(2) of this title, as provided in subsection\n          (b) of this section.\n               (b) A violation of subsection (a) of this section\n          is established if, based on the totality of the\n          circumstances, it is shown that the political\n          processes leading to nomination or election in the\n          State or political subdivision are not equally open to\n          participation by members of a class of citizens\n          protected by subsection (a) of this section in that\n          its members have less opportunity than other members\n          of the electorate to participate in the political\n          process and to elect representatives of their choice.\n          The extent to which members of a protected class have\n          been elected to office in the State or political\n          subdivision is one circumstance which may be\n          considered: Provided, That nothing in this section\n          establishes a right to have members of a protected\n\n\n                                 7\n\f             class elected in numbers equal to their proportion in\n             the population.\n\n(Emphasis added).\n\n             In Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30 (1986), a case\nwhich did not involve a purge act, black citizens of North\n\nCarolina brought suit challenging that state's legislative\n\nredistricting plan on the grounds that the plan impaired black\n\ncitizens' ability to elect representatives of their choice in\n\nviolation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.     The district\n\ncourt, applying the \"totality of the circumstances\" test set\n\nforth in § 2(b) of the Voting Rights Act, held that the\n\nredistricting plan violated the Act because it resulted in the\n\ndilution of black citizens' votes in all of the disputed election\n\ndistricts.\n\n             The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the\n\ndistrict court with respect to all of the disputed districts\n\nexcept one.    In so ruling, the Court held that to determine\n\n\"whether 'as a result of the challenged practice or structure\n\nplaintiffs do not have an equal opportunity to participate in the\n\npolitical processes and to elect candidates of their choice,'\" a\n\ncourt must \"assess the impact of the contested structure or\n\npractice on minority electoral opportunities 'on the basis of\n\nobjective factors.'\"    Thornburg, 478 U.S. at 44.\n\n             The Senate Judiciary Committee Report that accompanied\n\nthe bill amending Section 2 enumerated a non-exclusive list of\n\nfactors relevant to a Section 2 claim: the history of official\n\nvoting-related discrimination in the State or political sub-\n\n\n\n                                  8\n\fdivision; the extent to which voting in the elections of the\n\nState or political subdivision is racially polarized; the extent\n\nto which the State or political subdivision has used electoral\n\npractices that tend to enhance the opportunity for discrimina-\n\ntion; whether minorities have been excluded from any candidate\n\nslating process; the extent to which minority groups bear the\n\neffects of discrimination in such areas as education, employment\n\nand health, which hinder their ability to participate effectively\n\nin the political process; the extent to which political campaigns\n\nhave been characterized by overt or subtle racial appeals; the\n\nextent to which minority members have been elected to public\n\noffice; whether there is a significant lack of responsiveness on\n\nthe part of elected officials to the particularized needs of\n\nminority groups; whether the policy underlying the use of such\n\nvoting qualification, prerequisite to voting, or standard,\n\npractice or procedure is tenuous.    S. Rep. No. 97-417, 97th\n\nCong., 2d Sess. 28-30, reprinted in 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. 177 (\"S.\n\nRep.\").\n\n          Although in Thornburg v. Gingles the Supreme Court\n\nproceeded to weigh these factors, the Court also recognized that\n\nthe Senate Judiciary Committee list was, in fact, \"neither\n\ncomprehensive nor exclusive,\" 478 U.S. at 45 (1986), and that\n\n\"there is no requirement that any particular number of factors be\n\nproved, or that a majority of them point one way or another.\"\n\nId., quoting S. Rep. at 29.   That is, both the Court and the\n\nCommittee recognized that other factors might be relevant to the\n\n\n\n\n                                 9\n\fdetermination of whether, under the totality of the circum-\n\nstances, a given electoral procedure was discriminatory.\n\n          On this much, the parties agree.   Ortiz argues,\n\ndespite the allegations in his complaint, that the district court\n\ncompletely negated the totality of the circumstances test set out\n\nby Section 2 in holding that if the purge statute was not \"the\n\ndispositive force depriving minorities of equal access to the\n\npolitical process\" then, under the \"totality of the circum-\n\nstances,\" there was no violation of the Voting Rights Act.0\n\n          The City argues that the district court did not err in\n\nrequiring Ortiz to show that the purge statute caused minority\n\nvoters to have less opportunity than other members of the\n\nelectorate to participate in the political process and to elect\n\nrepresentatives of their choice.\n\n\n\n                               C.\n\n          The primary legal issue before us, then, is whether\n\nthe district court erred by factoring into its \"totality of the\n\ncircumstances\" analysis the question of whether or not the purge\n\nstatute caused minorities to be deprived of equal access to the\n\npolitical system.\n\n\n\n\n0\n          As we read the district court's opinion, we construe\nit to mean that where, as here, a Section 2 plaintiff seeks to\nabolish or invalidate a particular election practice, such as a\npurge law, and pinpoints the particular practice in its\ncomplaint, the plaintiff necessarily must demonstrate and\nestablish by evidence that the particular practice causes the\nalleged discrimination.\n\n                               10\n\f                                 1.\n\n            The Supreme Court wrote in Thornburg v. Gingles that\n\n\"[t]he essence of a § 2 claim is that a certain electoral law,\n\npractice, or structure interacts with social and historical\n\nconditions to cause an inequality in the opportunities enjoyed by\n\nblack and white voters to elect their preferred representatives.\"\n\n478 U.S. at 47 (1986) (emphasis added).   That is, the Supreme\n\nCourt recognized that there must be some causal connection\n\nbetween the challenged electoral practice and the alleged\n\ndiscrimination that results in a denial or abridgement of the\n\nright to vote.\n\n            Three Courts of Appeal have required Section 2\n\nplaintiffs to demonstrate a causal connection between asserted\n\nindicia of discrimination and the challenged electoral procedure\n\nat issue.   In Wesley v. Collins, 791 F.2d 1255 (6th Cir. 1986),\n\nthe plaintiffs argued that a Tennessee law which disenfranchised\n\nconvicted felons had a disproportionate impact on blacks because\n\na significantly higher number of black Tennesseeans are convicted\n\nof felonies than whites.   The Court of Appeals rejected this\n\nargument, despite the district court's findings that there\n\nexisted in Tennessee \"a history of racial discrimination, the\n\neffects of which continue to the present day.\"   Id. at 1261.    The\n\ncourt held that, under the totality of the circumstances, the\n\npresence of some of the factors enumerated in the legislative\n\nhistory of Section 2 was outweighed by other factors such as the\n\nstate's legitimate and compelling rationale for enacting the\n\nstatute at issue.   The court concluded that \"the disproportionate\n\n\n                                 11\n\fimpact suffered by black Tennesseeans does not 'result' from the\n\nstate's qualification of the right to vote on account of race or\n\ncolor and thus the Tennessee Act does not violate the Voting\n\nRights Act.\"   Id. at 1262.\n\n           In Irby v. Virginia State Board of Elections, 889 F.2d\n\n1352, 1358-59 (4th Cir. 1989), the Fourth Circuit upheld a\n\ndistrict court's finding that Virginia's appointive system for\n\nselection of school board members did not violate Section 2 of\n\nthe Voting Rights Act.   That is, the Court of Appeals agreed with\n\nthe district court's conclusion that, despite the existence of a\n\n\"significant disparity\" between the percentage of blacks in the\n\npopulation and the percentage of blacks on the school board,\n\n\"[t]he evidence cast considerable doubt on the existence of a\n\ncausal link between the appointive system and black\n\nunderrepresentation in Buckingham and Halifax counties.\"     Id. at\n\n1359.   Rather, the disparity arose from the fact that \"although\n\nblacks comprise a large portion of the population, they are not\n\nseeking school board seats in numbers consistent with their\n\npercentage of the population.\"    Id. at 1358, quoting, 693 F.\n\nSupp. 424, 434 (E.D. Va. 1988).\n\n           Finally, in Salas v. Southwest Texas Junior College\nDistrict, 964 F.2d 1542 (5th Cir. 1992), Hispanic voters\n\nchallenged the use of an at-large system, as opposed to single\n\nmember districts.   The Fifth Circuit held that \"the district\n\ncourt's ultimate finding that the cause of Hispanic voters' lack\n\nof electoral success is failure to take advantage of political\n\nopportunity, rather than a violation of § 2,\" was not clearly\n\n\n                                  12\n\ferroneous.    Id. at 1556.0   Noting that evidence introduced at\n\ntrial showed that Hispanic voter turnout was roughly seven\n\npercentage points below that of Anglo-Saxon whites, the Court of\n\nAppeals agreed that \"[o]bviously, a protected class is not\n\nentitled to § 2 relief merely because it turns out in a lower\n\npercentage than whites to vote.\"        Id.0\n\n0\n          The dissent's attempt to distinguish Salas misses the\nmark. See Dissent typescript at 28. Although the Court of\nAppeals in Salas did address the issue of whether or not a\nminority group which constitutes a majority of registered voters\nmay bring a claim under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act,\nconcluding that it could, the court proceeded to consider the\nvalidity of the plaintiffs' claim on the merits, and stressed the\nneed for the plaintiffs to establish that the challenged practice\n(i.e., the at-large system) caused the electoral dilution.\n          After delineating the court's responsibility to\nanalyze the impact of a challenged practice, and the plaintiffs'\nburden to prove that the practice denied them the opportunity to\nelect their preferred representatives, the Fifth Circuit noted\nthat \"[u]nderlying these functions of the court and the\nplaintiffs in a multimember district vote dilution case is an\ninquiry into causation--whether the given electoral practice is\nresponsible for plaintiffs' inability to elect their preferred\nrepresentatives.\" 964 F.2d at 1554 (5th Cir. 1992).\n0\n          We note that the legislative history of the 1982\namendment also supports this construction of Section 2. For\nexample, the Senate Judiciary Committee Report summarized the\namendment's effect as follows:\n\n             If as a result of the challenged practice or structure\n             plaintiffs do not have an equal opportunity to\n             participate in the political process and to elect\n             candidates of their choice, there is a violation of\n             this section.\n\nSen R. at 28 (emphasis added). We read this language to provide\nthat Congress intended that any alleged denial of equal access to\nthe political process be the \"result of the challenged practice\nor structure.\"\n          The Report also stresses that the ultimate test for\nboth permanent structural barriers to political participation, as\nwell as episodic barriers, would be the standard enunciated by\nthe Supreme Court in White v. Regester, 412 U.S. 755 (1973), and\ncodified by Congress in its 1982 amendment of Section 2:\n\n\n                                   13\n\f                               2.\n\n          We agree that Section 2 plaintiffs must show a causal\n\nconnection between the challenged voting practice and the\n\nprohibited discriminatory result.    Ortiz's argument to the\n\ncontrary is without legal foundation, devoid of endorsement in\n\nexisting caselaw and the legislative history of Section 2 of the\n\nVoting Rights Act, and is not supported by evidence.   In the\n\npresent case, the district court properly considered whether or\n\nnot Pennsylvania's non-voting purge statute0 caused the\n\ndiscrimination of which Ortiz complained.\n\n\n\n                               III\n\n                               A.\n\n\n\n\"whether, in the particular situation, the practice operated to\ndeny the minority plaintiff an equal opportunity to participate\nand to elect candidates of their choice.\" Sen. R. at 30\n(emphasis added) (accompanying footnote discussed below). This\nlanguage informs us that the Senate Judiciary Committee expected\nthat courts ultimately would focus on the challenged procedure\nand its causal effects on equal opportunity to participate in the\npolitical process.\n          Finally, the footnote accompanying the above-quoted\ntext states that \"purging of voters could produce a\ndiscriminatory result if fair procedures were not followed, Toney\nv. White, 488 F.2d 310 (5th Cir. 1973), or if the need for a\npurge were not shown or if opportunities for re-registration were\nunduly limited.\" S. Rep. at 30 n. 119. Thus, the Committee\nacknowledged that a purge statute which, itself, produced a\ndiscriminatory result, by virtue of the manner in which it was\nadministered, might violate Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.\nImplicitly, however, the Committee recognized that a purge\nstatute which was administered fairly, and in an even-handed\nmanner, would not run afoul of the law.\n0\n          See, supra, note 1.\n\n\n                               14\n\f          Ortiz argues that the district court erred in holding\n\nthat, under the totality of the circumstances, Ortiz had \"failed\n\nto demonstrate that the purge law interacts with social and\n\nhistorical conditions to deny minority voters equal access to the\n\npolitical process and to elect their preferred representatives.\"\n\nOrtiz, 824 F. Supp. at 539 (E.D. Pa. 1993).0   As previously\n\nobserved, the ultimate question of whether a challenged electoral\n\nprocedure has a discriminatory effect is a question of fact which\n\nwe review for clear error.   See, supra, Section II(A).\n\n          The district court made extensive findings with\n\nrespect to the aforementioned objective factors delineated in the\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Report.   The district court found that\n\nthere was racially polarized voting in Philadelphia, Ortiz, 824\n\nF. Supp. at 532-33, and a \"general pattern\" of racial appeals in\n\nsome Philadelphia political campaigns.   Id. at 536-37.   The court\n\nfound that there were \"substantial socioeconomic disparities\n\namong African-American, Latino and white residents of the City of\n\n0\n          Ortiz challenges a number of the district court's\nunderlying factual findings. In particular, Ortiz argues that\nthe district court erred in finding that the City's failure to\nsend out bilingual \"intent to purge\" notices, in violation of an\norder in Arroyo v. Tucker, 372 F. Supp. 764 (E.D. Pa. 1974), did\nnot have a discriminatory impact on the ability of Latino voters\nto equally participate in the political process. Ortiz also\nclaims that the district court erred in finding that minority\nvoters did not suffer a disproportionate burden of re-\nregistration, and that the disproportionate placement of older\nvoting machines in minority wards did not have a discriminatory\nimpact on minority voters.\n          None of these findings of fact were clearly erroneous.\nIn any event, they are subsumed by the district court's ultimate\nfactual determination that Ortiz had failed to establish that the\npurge statute caused minority voters to be purged at a\ndisproportionate rate.\n\n\n                                15\n\fPhiladelphia, which affect the ability of these minority groups\n\nto participate in the political process and to elect their\n\ncandidates of choice.\"   Id. at 535.0    In addition, the court\n\nfound that the needs of minority citizens have not always been\n\nadequately addressed by city officials, and that this factor, as\n\nwell as the impact of various socioeconomic factors, could\n\ninfluence minority participation in the political process.        Id.\n\nat 538.\n\n           Nevertheless, the district court found that there was\n\nno evidence of historical voting-related discrimination\n\ninfringing upon the rights of Latinos or African-Americans to\n\nvote.   Id. at 531-32.   There was no evidence of discrimination in\n\nthe candidate slating process that denied minority candidates\n\nequal access to the political process.      Id. at 533.   Nor was\n\nthere evidence that minorities experience difficulty in electing\n\nrepresentatives of their choice.      Id. at 537-38.0\n\n           Finally, the district court found that the policy\n\nreasons underlying the City's implementation of the voter purge\n\nwere substantial and were based upon a valid state interest of\n\n\n\n0\n          In particular, the district court found disparities in\nthe rates of educational attainment, home ownership, housing\ndiscrimination, health care coverage, employment, and income\namong African-Americans and Latinos in comparison to the general\npopulation of the City of Philadelphia. The court also found\nthat minority voters in Philadelphia do not exercise their right\nto vote to the same extent as white voters, which in part may be\nattributable to discrimination and the overall socioeconomic\nstatus of minorities in Philadelphia. Ortiz, 824 F. Supp. at\n533-35.\n0\n          See, infra, note 16, and accompanying text.\n\n\n                                 16\n\fensuring that elections in Philadelphia are not plagued with\n\nfraud.   Id. at 538-39.\n\n           Ultimately, the district court concluded that Ortiz\n\nhad failed to establish a per se violation of Section 2:\n          Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that the purge\n          law interacts with social and historical conditions to\n          deny minority voters equal access to the political\n          process and to elect their preferred representatives,\n          particularly since it is undisputed that the purge\n          procedure is administered fairly and that there is\n          ample opportunity for purged voters to re-register to\n          vote. Although it is clear that the operation of the\n          purge law removes African-American and Latino voters\n          from the voter registration rolls at higher rates than\n          white voters, this disproportionate impact does not\n          rise to the level of a per se violation of § 2, even\n          when considered in light of the court's findings of\n          the existence of racially polarized voting,\n          socioeconomic disparities in education, employment and\n          health, racial appeals in some elections, and the\n          failure of the City in some instances to address the\n          needs of minority citizens. While it is clear that\n          these factors may contribute to decreased minority\n          political participation rates, plaintiffs' evidence\n          simply does not justify the conclusion that the purge\n          law is the dispositive force in depriving minority\n          voters of equal access to the political process in\n          violation of § 2.\n\nOrtiz, 824 F. Supp. at 539.0\n\n\n\n                                B.\n\n           We hold that the district court did not err in\n\nconcluding that Ortiz had failed to show that Philadelphia's\n\nminority population has had less opportunity than other members\n\nof the electorate to participate in the political process and to\n\n0\n          Examining the district court's opinion as a whole, it\nis apparent that the court's use of the phrase \"the dispositive\nforce\" means a cause which, in that context, would be legally\ndispositive.\n\n                                17\n\felect representatives of their choice, as a result of\n\nPennsylvania's purge statute.\n\n            The Supreme Court has stated categorically that the\n\nright to vote is of the very essence of democratic society.              Shaw\n\nv. Reno, ___ U.S. ___, 113 S.Ct. 2816, 2822 (1993), quoting\n\nReynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 555 (1964).           Although we are\n\nmindful of the fact that it was not until relatively late in our\n\nnation's history that this right was extended to every American\n\ncitizen, without regard to race, we note that the Fifteenth\n\nAmendment, the Voting Rights Act, and numerous judicial decisions\n\nall have sought to raze any enduring historical bastions of\n\nstate-administered voter discrimination.\n\n            Here, however, it is not the State which prevents\n\ncitizens from exercising their right to vote, from participating\n\nin the political process, and from electing representatives of\n\ntheir own choosing.      We are not confronted with an electoral\n\ndevice -- such as \"race-neutral\" literacy tests, grandfather\n\nclauses, good-character provisos, racial gerrymandering, and vote\n\ndilution -- which discriminates against minorities, which has no\n\nrational basis, and which is beyond the control of minority\n\nvoters.   Rather, we are faced with the fact that, for a variety\n\nof historical reasons, minority citizens have turned out to vote\n\nat a statistically lower rate than white voters.0\n0\n          The following statistics, upon which the district\ncourt relied, Ortiz, 824 F. Supp. at 536 (E.D. Pa. 1993), are\nilluminative:\n          Voter Registration and Voter Turnout in General Elections\n                            by Year and Ethnicity\n          Eligible Voters           Actual Voters           Percentage\n\n\n                                     18\n\f                As we read Ortiz's complaint, the entire document is\n\n drawn to allege that Pennsylvania's purge statute \"caused\" the\n\ndisparate purge rates between Philadelphia's white and minority\n\ncommunities.       Yet, there is nothing before us, not even one iota\n\nof evidence introduced at trial or present in the record, which\n\n      would establish that fact, despite the claims made by the\n\n                                       dissent.\n\n                  On the contrary, it is well established that purge\n\nstatutes are a legitimate means by which the State can attempt to\n\n prevent voter fraud.0             More importantly, registered voters are\n\n\n\n Ye    White      Black    Other     White    Black    Other    White   Blac   Other\n ar                                                                       k\n 19   529,863    370,768   56,143   369,76    249,14   27,888   69.7    67.2   48.6\n 87                                    3         1\n 19   540,397    384,712   74,897   390,96    238,75   40,424   72.5    62.1   54.2\n 88                                    5         2\n 19   515,984    369,733   77,751   233,60    112,73   10,267   45.3    30.5   20.8\n 89                                    6         0\n 19   464,350    321,417   88,653   252,22    120,34   27,079   54.3    37.4   30.5\n 90                                    1         9\n 19   408,143    267,172   120,64   155,98    155,98   53,936   67.2    58.3   44.7\n 91                          2         7         7\n\n 0\n           For example, the Fourth Circuit stated as follows in\n rejecting a constitutional challenge to Maryland's voter purge\n                            statute:\n\n                 The statute in question here is designed to curb vote\n                   fraud. It removes from the registered voter list\n                    those who have moved without notifying the voter\n                 registration board, those who have died when the city\n                  has not been notified of such deaths, and those who\n                have become disqualified as a result of conviction for\n                 infamous crime if the city did not receive notice of\n                 such convictions. Without removing the names, there\n                 exists the very real danger that impostors will claim\n                  to be someone on the list and vote in their places.\n                 And the absent voting statutes open the door for vote\n                 fraud by this means. Accordingly, keeping accurate,\n                reliable and up-to-date voter registration lists is an\n                 important state interest. . . . Even considering that\n\n                                             19\n\f purged -- without regard to race, color, creed, gender, sexual\n\norientation, political belief, or socioeconomic status -- because\n\n they do not vote, and do not take the opportunity of voting in\n\n         the next election or requesting reinstatement.0\n\n           It is true that in certain years minority voters have\n\n   turned out in proportionately lower numbers than have non-\n\n    minority voters.   But the purge statute did not cause the\n\n     statistical disparities which form the basis of Ortiz's\n\n  complaint.   We agree with the Fifth Circuit that \"a protected\n\n class is not entitled to § 2 relief merely because it turns out\n\n in a lower percentage than whites to vote.\"   Salas v. Southwest\n\n  Texas Junior College District, 964 F.2d 1542, 1556 (5th Cir.\n\n                              1992).\n\n\n\n                                C.\n\n\n\n\n            re-registration may be somewhat burdensome, it is a\n           small price to pay for the prevention of vote fraud.\n\nHoffman v. Maryland, 928 F.2d 646, 649 (4th Cir. 1991). See also\n   Rosario v. Rockefeller, 410 U.S. 752, 761 (1973) (recognizing\nthat \"preservation of the integrity of the electoral process is a\n   legitimate and valid state goal\"); Barilla v. Ervin, 886 F.2d\n    1514, 1523-24 (9th Cir. 1989) (recognizing legitimate state\n interest in preventing electoral fraud). See, infra, discussion\n                               at 27-30.\n0\n             We note that the procedures for re-registering to vote\n     are identical to those for registering in the first place;\n       therefore, they are no more complicated, burdensome, or\ndiscriminatory than the requirement of initial registration. See\n      Williams v. Osser, 350 F. Supp. 646, 653 (E.D. Pa. 1972)\n   (recognizing that \"[t]he burden [of re-registration under the\n  non-voting purge law] does not nearly approach the requirements\n                      of initial registration.\")\n\n\n                                20\n\f          Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act requires minority\n\nclaimants to prove that they \"have less opportunity than other\n\nmembers of the electorate to participate in the political process\n\nand to elect representatives of their choice.\"    Chisom v. Roemer,\n\n___ U.S. ___, 111 S. Ct. 2354, 2365 (1991).    That is, Section 2\n\nplaintiffs must demonstrate that they had less opportunity both\n\n(1) to participate in the political process, and (2) to elect\n\nrepresentatives of their choice.    In Chisom, the Supreme Court\n\nstated:\n          Any abridgement of the opportunity of members\n          of a protected class to participate in the\n          political process inevitably impairs their\n          ability to influence the outcome of an\n          election. . . . [H]owever, the inability to\n          elect representatives of their choice is not\n          sufficient to establish a violation unless,\n          under the totality of the circumstances, it\n          can also be said that the members of the\n          protected class have less opportunity to\n          participate in the political process.\n\n111 S. Ct. at 2365 (holding that state judicial elections fall\n\nwithin the scope of Voting Rights Act).\n\n          In contrast to the situation discussed by the Court in\n\nChisom, here the district court not only made a finding of\n\nminority participation in the political process, Ortiz, 824 F.\n\nSupp. at 539, but it also made an explicit finding of fact that\n\nPhiladelphia's minority population has not had difficulty\n\nelecting minority representatives.    Id. at 537-38.   In fact,\n\ndespite the dissent's charges, there is no evidence in the record\n\nthat minorities have been denied fair access to the political\n\nprocess in the City of Philadelphia, nor is there any evidence\n\nthat the purge law \"impairs their ability to influence the\n\n\n                               21\n\foutcome of an election.\"        Chisom, 111 S.Ct. at 2365.0                    To the\n\ncontrary, a minority candidate, Wilson Goode, had won election to\n\ntwo four-year terms as Mayor of the City of Philadelphia, in 1983\n\nand 1987, and the district court found that the Philadelphia City\n\nCouncil consistently has had a strong minority presence,\n\nincluding seven of the seventeen council seats at the time the\n\ndistrict court issued its opinion.0\n\n0\n          The dissent quotes footnote 117 from the Senate\nJudiciary Committee Report as follows: \"[E]ven a consistently\napplied practice premised on a racially neutral policy would not\nnegate a plaintiff's showing through other factors that the\nchallenged practice denies minorities fair access to the\nprocess.\" Dissent typescript at 35. Ortiz, however, has failed\nto prove that \"the challenged practice [i.e., the purge statute]\ndenies minorities fair access to the process.\"\n0\n          The district court included in its opinion the\nfollowing germane statistics with respect to minority\nrepresentation in the Pennsylvania legislature:\n\n                       Representatives from Philadelphia in the State\n                                    House and Senate\n                          by percentage of minorities represented\n                      House                                           Senate\n     Ye    Total   Minority           %             Total        Minority          %\n      ar\n     197    34        10              29%             8             3              32%\n      9\n     198    34        11              32%              -             -              -\n      0\n     198    29        12              41%             7             3              42%\n      2\n     198    29        13              44%             7             3              42%\n      5\n     198    29        13              44%              -             -              -\n      6\n     198    29        13              44%              -             -              -\n      8\n     199    29        13              44%              -             -              -\n      0\n     199    27        13              44%             7             3              42%\n      2\n\n\n\n                                         22\n\f               These findings by the district court are not clearly\n\nerroneous.     Thus, we conclude that Ortiz, in failing to establish\n\n    causation, has also failed to satisfy both elements of a Section\n\n     2 cause of action and, accordingly, has failed to establish a\n\n        basis upon which his requested relief could be granted.\n\n\n\n                                   IV\n\n             The dissent argues at great length that societal\n\nconditions -- discrimination in housing, education, wages, etc. -\n\n- constitute a totality of the circumstances with which the\n\npractice (the purge law) interacts to create inequality\n\n(discrimination).     The dissent, however, has overlooked the fact\n\nthat the individuals to whom the purge law applies apparently\n\nhave surmounted and overcome the societal disadvantages which it\n\nemphasizes, and have registered to vote at least once, if not\n\nmore often.0    Had they continued to do so, the purge law could\n\nnot have affected them, inasmuch as the purge law operates\n\nagainst only those who have registered to vote at least once, but\n\nthen do not vote or register again.     Conversely, if individuals\n\nhave never registered and have never voted, the purge law still\n\n0\n          Thus, the dissent's reliance on Mississippi State\nChapter, Operation Push v. Allain, 674 F. Supp. 1245 (N.D. Miss.\n1987), aff'd, 932 F.2d 400 (5th Cir. 1991), is misplaced. See\ndissent typescript at 23-25. In that case, Mississippi's onerous\ndual registration requirement, and prohibition on off-site voter\nregistration, were the causes of black voters' registering at\nlower rates than white voters. In the present case, no part of\nthe purge statute prevents minority voters from registering to\nvote and from actually voting. In fact, as mentioned in text,\nthe statute only applies to those voters who already have\nregistered to vote.\n\n\n                                   23\n\fcould not be applied to them because, as stated, the purge law\n\naffects only those who have once registered to vote.\n\n             Once having registered to vote, such individuals could\n\nnot have been impeded by the practices which Ortiz claims have\n\ndiluted their participation in the voting process.0    This may\n\nvery well account for the fact that no reported case has ever\n\ndealt with a non-voting purge law as a racially discriminatory\n\ninstrument in violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act,\n\nand the dissent, accordingly, has been unable to cite any such\n\nauthority.    It certainly accounts for the result which the\n\ndistrict court reached in the present case, and which we reach\n\ntoday.   The societal disadvantages cited by the plaintiffs and\n\nthe dissent just are not relevant.     They are not relevant because\n\nthey could not have diluted voting by a registrant or voter who\n\nhad already registered and/or voted.    As previously stated, the\n\nrecord reveals no link between the societal conditions and\n\nfactors recited by the dissent and the electoral practice (i.e.,\n\nthe purge law) challenged by Ortiz.\n\n             In addition, the dissent argues at length that \"the\n\nCity did not prove 'the need' for Pennsylvania's non-voting purge\n\nlaw,\" (Dissent typescript at 33), and that the City properly\n\nshould have been required to do so.    The dissent derives such a\n\nrequirement from footnote 119 in the Senate Judiciary Committee's\n\nReport,0 and its own analogy to Title VII disparate impact law.0\n\n0\n          See, supra, note 14.\n0\n          Footnote 119 provides in relevant part as follows:\n\"purging of voters could produce a discriminatory result if fair\nprocedures were not followed, Toney v. White, 488 F.2d 310 (5th\n\n\n                                  24\n\fHowever, no relevant authority has been cited for imposing such a\n\nburden upon the City.0   Even if there were such a requirement, we\n\nare satisfied that a review of the record and present reality\n\ndemonstrates that the City's purge statute meets an important and\n\n\nCir. 1973), or if the need for a purge were not shown or if\nopportunities for re-registration were unduly limited.\" (Emphasis\nadded.) In the present case, none of these qualifications are\nrelevant, nor has Ortiz proved the presence of any of them.\n0\n          In Title VII disparate impact cases, plaintiffs are\npermitted to come forward with evidence of less discriminatory\nalternatives to refute their employers' business justifications\nbecause such evidence \"would belie a claim by [employers] that\ntheir incumbent practices are being employed for non-\ndiscriminatory reasons.\" Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio, 490\nU.S. 642, 660-61 (1989) (recognizing that employer's practice\nneed not be \"essential\" or \"indispensable\" to the employer's\nbusiness for it to pass muster as a business justification).\nHere, there is no allegation, no implication, no imputation, and,\nof greatest importance, no evidence, that the purge statute was\nenacted, or is being employed, by the City of Philadelphia for\nanything but nondiscriminatory reasons.\n          Moreover, even if the dissent was correct in drawing\nan analogy to Title VII jurisprudence -- an analogy which is\ninapposite -- we note that in Title VII cases, it is the\nplaintiff, not the defendant, as the dissent would have it, see\nDissent typescript at 43, who, at all times, bears the burden of\nproving discrimination. St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks, ___\nU.S. ___, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 2749 (1993); Dothard v. Rawlinson, 433\nU.S. 321 (1977); Newark Branch, NAACP v. Town of Harrison, 940\nF.2d 792, 798 (3d Cir. 1991). In the present case, Ortiz has\nfailed to carry any such burden.\n0\n          In Wesley v. Collins, 791 F.2d 1255, 1261 (6th Cir.\n1986), the Sixth Circuit did not require the State of Tennessee\nto show that its statute disenfranchising convicted felons was\n\"necessary.\" Nor could the State have made such a showing were\nit required to do so. Rather, the Court of Appeals held:\n\n          [T]he existence of other social and political factors\n          present in this case leads to the inescapable\n          conclusion that the Voting Rights Act was not\n          violated. Chief among those factors was the state's\n          legitimate and compelling rationale for enacting the\n          statute here in issue.\n\nId. at 1261.\n\n\n                                 25\n\flegitimate civic interest and is needed to prevent electoral\n\nfraud.\n\n          Notably, and of recent date, Philadelphia's Senate\n\nelection, in which the Democratic candidate ostensibly had\n\nprevailed, was invalidated on the basis of findings that absentee\n\nvotes cast by non-residents and deceased voters had been\n\nfraudulently obtained and counted.    See Marks v. Stinson, No. 93-\n\n6157 (E.D. Pa. Feb. 18, 1994), vacated in part, 19 F.3d 873 (3d\n\nCir. 1994).   Indeed, as recently as April 13, 1994, the\n\nPhiladelphia Inquirer reported under the headline, \"City Purging\n\n2d District Voter Rolls,\" that at least twenty-two individuals\n\nwere \"purged\" because they either had died or no longer lived in\n\nthe district but had, nevertheless, cast votes in the most recent\n\nelection -- the very fraudulent acts which the purge statute was\n\ndesigned to overcome.0   Even the dissent acknowledges that\n\n0\n          That article recited in part:\n\n          · The Board of Elections has begun purging\n          the Second Senate District voting rolls of\n          people who no longer live there -- including\n          a woman whose vote was recorded after she\n          died and another whose vote was cast while\n          she lived on a Greek island.\n\n          · Election officials said the 22 names --\n          including an individual who city\n          investigators found living in New Jersey --\n          would immediately be purged from computerized\n          voting rolls and notification would be\n          delivered to the addresses on their voter\n          registration.\n\n          · Among the 22   people being purged in the\n          Sixth Division   of the 42d Ward is one\n          individual who   has been living in Las Vegas\n          for two years,   though a vote was cast in her\n\n                                 26\n\felectoral fraud has been a part of Philadelphia's landscape for\n\nover 100 years.    See Dissent typescript at 39 n.22.\n\n\n\n                                  V\n\n          In its final analysis, the dissent's rhetoric still\n\nfails to bridge the gap between the societal disadvantages which\n\nit catalogues at great length, and the purpose and effect of\n\nPhiladelphia's non-voting purge act.     Once again, we emphasize\n\nthat the sole purpose of that act is to prevent the very\n\nelectoral fraud which can diminish the voting power of all\n\ncitizens who have registered and voted, including registered and\n\nvoting members of minority groups.     Despite the dissent's attempt\n\nto attribute society's voting ills to the purge act, neither the\n\nplaintiffs nor the dissent have been able to demonstrate that the\n\npurge act has had any effect whatsoever on any rights which are\n\nprotected by Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.\n\n          The dissent repeatedly charges the purge act with\n\ndiscrimination against minorities.     See, e.g., Dissent typescript\n\nat 7, 47, 50.     Yet, not one word appears in the dissent to\n\n\n          name in the November election without her\n          knowledge, and a second individual who said\n          he did not vote in any of the five\n          Philadelphia elections in which ballots were\n          cast for him since 1988.\n\n          · Between 1988 and 1993, for example, at\n          least 60 improper ballots were cast in the\n          Sixth Division of the 42d Ward, 27 by machine\n          and 33 by absentee ballot.\n\nMark Fazlollah, City Purging 2d District Voter Rolls, Phila.\nInquirer, April 13, 1994, at A1, A7.\n\n\n                                  27\n\fsubstantiate such charges.   Of even greater importance, the\n\nentire record is devoid of evidence which could support such a\n\nconclusion.   It is not enough, in an attack on a non-voting purge\n\nlaw, simply to express distress over the very real societal\n\ndisadvantages that afflict some members of minority groups.     Such\n\nsympathy and concern, though shared by all of us, are extraneous\n\nto the legal challenge mounted by Ortiz.\n\n           The dissent's single-minded focus on societal\n\ndisadvantages might be entitled to somewhat greater weight in a\n\nsuit challenging, not Philadelphia's purge act, but, perhaps,\n\nmore generally, Philadelphia's voter registration procedures\n\nthemselves.   It is apparent to us that the dissent, while\n\ncharging the purge act with a discriminatory effect, essentially\n\nis railing against registration procedures not at issue here.\n\n           For example, if Ortiz had alleged that, because of\n\ndisadvantages in education, housing, health, income, and the\n\nlike, minority citizens could not afford to travel to\n\nregistration centers, or in some other way avail themselves of\n\nregistration opportunities, the dissent's essay might have some\n\nmeaning.   But Philadelphia's voter registration laws, as a whole,\n\nare not under attack here.   The sole statute assailed by Ortiz is\n\n§ 623-40, the non-voting purge act.   That act operates only after\n\na would-be registrant has overcome whatever societal obstacles,\n\nsuch as those detailed in the dissent, were in his path.\n\n           When, if ever, a claimant mounts an attack against\n\nPhiladelphia's voter registration provisions, then and only then\n\nwill it be the time to assess the legality of such procedures in\n\n\n                                28\n\flight of the societal disadvantages highlighted by the dissent.\n\nThis case, this appeal, and our opinion, however, are not the\n\ntime or place for such a discussion.   Until proofs can be\n\nassembled -- and we can think of none that are relevant -- to\n\nestablish that a benign and neutral non-voting purge law\n\ndiscriminates against a particular class, we decline to\n\ninvalidate such a statute.\n\n\n\n                               VI\n\n          We hold that the district court did not err in denying\n\nOrtiz's request for declaratory and permanent injunctive relief.\n\nTherefore, we will affirm the district court's June 1, 1993 order\n\ngranting judgment in favor of the City.\n\n          Costs will be taxed against the appellant, Ortiz.\n\n\n\n\n                               29\n\fOrtiz v. City of Philadelphia, No. 93-1634\n\n\n\n\nSCIRICA, Circuit Judge, concurring.\n\n\n\n             Nothing undermines democratic government more quickly than fraudulent ele\n\nAny practice that impairs a fair process or rigs the count devalues and dilutes the\n\nof each citizen, including each minority citizen, who has lawfully voted. Voter fra\n\nincluding the practice of voting dead or non-resident citizens, is no stranger to\n\nPennsylvania, especially to the City of Philadelphia.    In 1937, the Pennsylvania Ge\n\nAssembly made a judgment that a non-voting purge law was necessary to prevent voter\n\n25 Pa. Stat. Ann. § 623-40 (1963 & 1993 Supp.).     Thirty-five years later, a three j\n\nfederal court upheld the constitutionality of Pennsylvania's law, based on the vali\n\ninterest in protecting the integrity of the electoral process.     Williams v. Osser,\n\nF.Supp. 646 (1972).0    The court held that was a policy decision the General Assembly\n0\n    As Judge Max Rosenn stated:\n\n             The principal state interest which the statute protects is the prevention\n        of fraudulent voting. Maintaining voter rolls that include persons who no long\n        reside in a precinct, or who reside there but do not vote, conduces to fraud.\n        Pennsylvania discovered that political operatives knowledgeable of the status\n        such registrants and weaknesses in the system were able to cast votes in the\n        non-voters' names. The two-year period allows removal of the names before the\n        political operatives can take advantage of the situation. If the period were\n        four years instead of two, they would have greater opportunity to seize upon t\n        registrant's non-voting status and defeat the purpose of the purge. Such\n        considerations led the state legislature to change the purge period from four\n        two years in 1941 after considerable public concern over voting fraud.

Last year, citing\n\nsteady decline of citizen participation in federal elections (except for 1992) and\n\npenalty imposed on non-voters by removing their names from the rolls,0 Congress deci\n\npromote voter registration by passing the National Voter Registration Act, 42 U.S.C\n\n§1973gg (1994 Supp.).0    In the process, Congress sought to strike a balance between\n\n\n\n\nWilliams v.

We cannot pretend, and I do not read the majority opinion t\n\nsuggest, that the discrimination prohibited by the Voting Rights Act has been releg\n\nan unfortunate but closed chapter of American history.   Discrimination and its effe\n\nremain a part of our present reality.   If we deny the continued existence of this p\n\nwe not only lose our ability to recognize and remedy present instances of unlawful\n\ninequality; we also guarantee that discrimination and the damage it does to the int\n\nand effectiveness of democratic government will be a more prevalent and intractable\n\nfeature of our country's future.\n\n          The majority and I share these broader concerns, but I have a different\n\nunderstanding of the way in which they are implicated in this case.   In my view, th\n\ndistrict court erred in concluding that Pennsylvania's non-voting purge statute doe\n\nviolate § 2 of the Voting Rights Act.   Moreover, the purge statute serves as a clea\n\nreminder that the law has yet to eliminate discrimination and its enduring effects\narea of voting.   For these reasons, I dissent.\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\f             Because of my deep concerns about the impact that I fear today's decision\n\nhave, both on the residents of Philadelphia who will not be able to exercise their\n\nto vote in upcoming elections, and on future efforts to properly apply the Voting R\n\nAct, I have set forth my views at considerable length.\n\n                                               I.\n\n             Early every January, in keeping with Pennsylvania's non-voting purge law,\n\nVoter Registration Division of Philadelphia's City Commissioners Office determines\n\nregistered voters have voted during the previous two calendar years.     Those who hav\n\ndone so are slated for purging.     After identifying these voters, the City sends the\n\n\"intent to purge notices.\" The notices, which are printed only in English, state:\n          NOTICE OF FAILURE TO VOTE WITHIN TWO YEARS   Our Records indicate you\n          have failed to vote for the last two years. As required by law, we\n          will cancel your Registration, unless you vote in the next Primary or\n          Election or File with this Commission a written request for\n          Reinstatement (10) ten days prior to the next Primary or Election,\n          signed by you, giving your present residence. This is the only notice\n          you will receive.\n\nAppendix (\"A.\") at 362.     The address of the Voter Registration Division appears on\n\nnotices beneath this statement.0     The notices do not, however, provide any instruct\n\nto how an individual might \"File with this Commission a written request for\n\nReinstatement,\" nor do they contain any information regarding what such a \"request\n\nReinstatement\" must contain (other than a signature and address).\n\n0\n    Additionally, in smaller type and without any explanation, \"MU6-1500\" appears in th\n             upper left corner of the notices, and \"MU6-1501\" appears in the upper rig\n             corner. At trial, Robert Lee, the Director of the Voter Registration Div\n             testified that those markings represent the Division's phone numbers. Acc\n             to Lee, that was \"obvious.\" A. at 283. Lee further testified that his o\n             did receive calls from registered voters who asked for explanations of in\n             to-purge notices that they had received. A. at 286.\n\n\n                                               5\n\f            Voters who are sent an intent to purge notice and who fail either to vote\n\nupcoming spring primary or to file a written request for reinstatement are purged f\n\nregistration rolls.   Once purged, an individual must re-register in order to vote i\n\nfuture.\n\n            The non-voting purge has a substantially disparate impact on black and La\n\nPhiladelphians.   The uncontroverted statistical evidence presented at trial, which\n\ndistrict court credited, showed that each year, greater percentages of black and La\n\nvoters were slated for purging than were white voters. The evidence further showed\n\nwhite voters were reinstated at higher rates than blacks and Latinos, thus increasi\n\nadverse disparate impact on these minority groups as a result of the non-voting pur\n\nat 32-35.\n\n            The differences between the way this challenged voting practice affected\n\nand blacks, as compared to the way it affected whites, were substantial and consist\n\nAccording to the plaintiffs' expert, Dr. Alan Lichtman, the statistical data showed\n\nPennsylvania's non-voting purge created a \"clear and consistent pattern\" of systema\npurging black and Latino voters at significantly greater rates than whites.   See, e\n\nat 38-39 (testimony of Dr. Lichtman, describing the differences as far exceeding th\n\nstandards of statistical significance, and as reflecting \"systematic\" results of th\n\nprocess); A. at 385, 394-95 (declaration of Dr. Lichtman, stating: \"The disparate i\n\non minorities of Philadelphia's non-voting purge is both substantial and systematic\n\nextending through a full four-year electoral cycle.\").   Dr. Lichtman's expert analy\n\nthe registration and purging statistics was uncontroverted and scientifically sound\ndistrict court, relying on his trial testimony and declaration, found that the expe\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\fevidence \"clearly reveals that African-American and Latino voters are slated for pu\n\nat higher rates than their white counterparts, and further, that minorities are pur\n\nhigher rates than white registrants.\"   Ortiz v. City of Philadelphia, 824 F. Supp.\n\n530 (E.D. Pa. 1993).   \"This finding,\" the court stated, \"is not limited by the fact\n\nthere were fluctuations in the purge rate from year to year.\"   Id.0\n\n          The district court made a number of other factual findings, which the maj\n\naccurately recounts.   Particularly significant among those, for reasons I discuss b\n\nthe court found that Latino and black Philadelphians have suffered significant\n\ndisadvantages in education, employment, housing, health care, and income.0   These\n\n\"substantial socioeconomic disparities among African-American, Latino, and white re\n\n\n0\n     In his declaration, based on the statistics that appear in the district court\n          majority opinions, Dr. Lichtman explained: \"To put this [disparate impact\n          non-voting purge] into perspective, if the black [purge] rate in 1991 had\n          as low as the white rate, about 28,000 fewer black registrants would have\n          [slated for purging] in 1991. Conversely, if the white purge rate in 199\n          been as high as the black rate, about 41,000 more white registrants would\n          been [slated for purging] in 1991.\" A. at 386.\n\n     The 1991 purge was the largest of the four years studied, as it affected all\n     registrants who had not voted since the 1988 presidential election. About 21%\n     registrants were slated for purging, and over 80% of those slated were ultimat\n     purged. (Again, whites reinstated themselves at higher rates than blacks and\n     Latinos.) According to Dr. Lichtman, the large numbers involved in the 1991 p\n     made that the \"key year for assessing racially differential impact\" of Pennsyl\n     law. A. at 385. While the numbers of registrants purged, as well as the magn\n     of the disparate impact, decreased in other years, that fact does not undermin\n     significance of the 1991 figures. To the contrary, as Dr. Lichtman explained,\n     that a relatively smaller proportion of black than white registrants were avai\n     for purging after 1991, it is striking that in 1992 even a small difference be\n     whites and blacks persists.\" A. at 391.\n0\n     In stating its findings with respect to housing and employment, the district c\n          observed that the City has been held liable for practicing discrimination\n          these areas. Ortiz, 824 F. Supp. at 533-35.\n\n\n                                             7\n\fof the City of Philadelphia,\" the court concluded, \"affect the ability of these min\n\ngroups to participate in the political process and to elect candidates of their cho\n\nOrtiz, 824 F. Supp. at 535.     In the court's view, that conclusion was \"further supp\n\nby statistical evidence demonstrating that minority voters in Philadelphia do not e\n\ntheir right to vote to the same extent as white voters, which in part may be attrib\n\nto discrimination and the overall socioeconomic status of minorities in Philadelphi\n\nId.\n\n           The record thus shows that Pennsylvania's non-voting purge law operates t\n\nremove blacks and Latinos from Philadelphia registration rolls at substantially hig\n\nrates than whites.   In addition, it establishes that black and Latino Philadelphian\n\nsuffer disadvantages and discrimination in various socioeconomic categories.\n\nSpecifically, the findings indicate that members of these groups are less educated.\n\nare in poorer health, and they experience greater difficulty acquiring adequate med\n\ncare.   They own fewer homes.   They are less frequently employed. They have lower in\n\nFinally, they do not vote as often. The district court even demonstrated its unders\nof the relationship between these familiar facts: that socioeconomic disparities, w\n\nare linked to past and present discrimination, make members of minority groups less\n\nand less likely to participate in the political process.    Prior to today's decision\n\nwould have thought that given this proven reality, courts could easily appreciate t\n\ndiscriminatory effect of Pennsylvania's non-voting purge law, as well as the legal\n\nsignificance of that effect under § 2 of the Voting Rights Act.\n\n                                              II.\n\n\n\n\n                                               8\n\f          In 1982, in response to the Supreme Court's decision in Mobile v. Bolden,\n\nU.S. 55 (1980), Congress amended § 2 to make clear that in determining whether this\n\nprovision of the Voting Rights Act has been violated, courts should apply the \"resu\n\ntest\" that the Supreme Court articulated in White v. Register, 412 U.S. 755 (1973),\n\nthan require plaintiffs to prove that a voting practice or procedure was motivated\n\ndiscriminatory intent.   E.g., Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30, 35 (1986).   Accord\n\n§ 2(a) prohibits all states and political subdivisions from applying any qualificat\n\nprerequisite to voting, or any standard, practice, or procedure \"in a manner which\n\nin a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote\n\nis a member of a protected class.   42 U.S.C. § 1973(a) (emphasis added).   Section 2\n\nsets forth the legal standard for meeting the results test adopted in § 2(a); drawn\n\ndirectly from the Court's language in White, § 2(b) states:\n          A violation of subsection (a) is established if, based on the totality\n          of circumstances, it is shown that the political processes leading to\n          nomination or election in the State or political subdivision are not\n          equally open to participation by members of a class of citizens\n          protected by subsection (a) in that its members have less opportunity\n          than other members of the electorate to participate in the political\n          process and to elect representatives of their choice.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1973(b).   Distilling the central meaning of this statutory language in\n\nGingles, the Supreme Court stated: \"The essence of a § 2 claim is that a certain el\n\nlaw, practice, or structure interacts with social and historical conditions to caus\n\ninequality in the opportunities enjoyed by black and white voters to elect their pr\n\nrepresentatives.\"   Gingles, 478 U.S. at 47 (emphasis added).0\n0\n     The Gingles Court only referred to blacks because of the facts of that case.\n          discussion of § 2 applies equally to Latinos, who are also members of a\n          protected class under the Voting Rights Act. 42 U.S.C. §§1973b(f)(2),\n          1973l(c)(3).\n\n\n                                             9\n\f          When Congress amended § 2, it instructed that in determining whether poli\n\nprocesses remain equally open to members of protected groups, in the way the Act re\n\ncourts must conduct \"a searching practical evaluation of the `past and present real\n\nS.

I agree that § 2 plaintiffs must show a causal connection between the voting p\n\nthey challenge and the deprivation of equal political opportunity they allege.   Thi\n\n-- which, I believe, the plaintiffs also accept0 -- is not open to question.   The l\n\nof the Voting Rights Act, the legislative history of the 1982 amendments, and contr\n\nprecedent all foreclose any argument that a voting practice can violate § 2 without\n\nresulting in, or playing some part in causing, the abridgement of citizens' voting\n\nThe majority, however, actually requires something more than and different from the\n\nconnection it initially describes.   From its uncontroversial answer to what it pres\n\nthe primary legal question, it departs from and distorts the meaning of § 2.\n\n\n\n0\n      According to the majority, the plaintiffs have argued that they need not show\n           causal connection between a challenged voting practice and the discrimina\n           effect of which they complain. Maj. Op. Typescript at 15. That is not a\n           accurate characterization of the plaintiffs' position. In their brief, t\n           plaintiffs insist that they have \"never asserted that the discriminatory\n           need not be in part attributable to the purge.\" Appellants' Brief at 41\n           The district court misunderstood them, they explain, when it formed the\n           impression that they denied that causation was relevant to their claim.\n           Neither the majority nor the City has advanced a waiver argument. Thus,\n           regardless of whether the plaintiffs ever took the untenable position for\n           they received credit in the district court, the important point, for pres\n           purposes, is that contrary to the majority's description of their argumen\n           have not denied the relevance of causation here.\n\n\n\n                                             12\n\f            On two occasions, the district court stated that the plaintiffs had not p\n\nviolation of § 2 because they had failed to demonstrate that \"the purge law is the\n\ndispositive force in depriving minority voters of equal access to the political pro\n\n. . .\"     Ortiz, 824 F. Supp. at 539 (emphasis added); see also id. at 524.    That is\n\nproper legal standard.    Section 2 does not require plaintiffs to prove that a chall\n\nvoting practice or procedure is \"the dispositive force,\" or the only cause, or even\n\nprincipal cause, of unequal political opportunity.     Neither the statute, nor its\n\nlegislative history, nor the relevant case law supports such a reading.     To the con\n\nthat authority requires us to determine whether a challenged law interacts with oth\n\nexternal conditions to limit the political opportunities available to members of pr\n\nclasses.    Gingles, 478 U.S. at 47.   As White and § 2(b) state, we must consider the\n\ntotality of the circumstances.    Those circumstances -- the \"social and historical\n\nconditions\" that make up the \"past and present reality\" surrounding political proce\n\ncreate the factual environment in which a challenged voting practice operates.        As\n\nthey necessarily contribute to the effect that a practice has on individuals' polit\nopportunities.    In order to properly apply § 2 in this case, we cannot require the\n\nplaintiffs to prove that Pennsylvania's non-voting purge law operates, by itself an\n\nindependently of other circumstances, to produce discriminatory results.       The chall\n\nlaw must certainly be a contributing cause of unequal opportunity, but it need not\n\nthe district court twice suggested, \"the dispositive force.\"\n\n            At oral argument, the City conceded this point.   It did not defend the\n\n\"dispositive force\" language that appears in the district court's opinion, but inst\nargued that in spite of these erroneous comments, the court understood and applied\n\n\n\n                                               13\n\fproper legal standard.   To an extent, I am inclined to agree with that position.     A\n\n(though slightly charitable) reading of the district court's analysis reveals that,\n\nleast on occasion, it seems to have understood that while § 2 plaintiffs must demon\n\nthat a voting practice interacts with other, external circumstances to cause an act\n\neffect, such plaintiffs need not establish that the practice is the dispositive or\n\nprimary cause of the results giving rise to their claim.\n\n          The majority, however, in contrast to the City, does not in any way quali\n\nsupport for the district court's statements.0     Instead, it adopts the view that in o\n\nto have established a violation of § 2, the plaintiffs would have needed to prove t\n\nnon-voting purge operated independently of social and historical conditions to caus\n\ninequality of which they complain.   Thus, the majority concludes that while black a\n\nLatino voters have turned out in lower numbers, the purge law did not cause that\n\nstatistical disparity.   Maj. Op. Typescript at 21.

The majority does not disagree with the substance of the co\n          statements; instead, it reads § 2 to require proof of a \"legally disposit\n          cause, by which it means a single cause of all relevant circumstances, th\n          entirely responsible for the discriminatory effect of which a plaintiff\n          complains. There is no place, in the majority's construction of § 2, for\n          contributing causes of inequality which are not themselves products of th\n          challenged voting law. As I explain below, I do share this view.\n\n\n                                             14\n\finteract with the challenged law to bring about such a discriminatory result -- abs\n\nproof that those factors are themselves products of the law -- no violation of § 2\n\noccurred.0\n\n             Accordingly, the majority states that the discrimination and disadvantage\n\nthe plaintiffs experienced in education, employment, health care, housing, and inco\n\nwhich the district court found and documented, \"just are not relevant.\" Maj. Op.\n\nTypescript at 25; see also id. at 29 (stating that societal disadvantages are \"extr\n\nto the plaintiffs' legal claim).

Op. Typescript at 19-20 (quotation unattributed); see\n          Maj. Op. Typescript at 10 n.4 and accompanying text (perhaps suggesting t\n          plaintiffs' complaint improvidently endorsed the majority's construction\n          § 2). That would certainly be a curious way for a party who rejected the\n          relevance of causation to plead a § 2 case. In fact, the plaintiffs have\n          pleaded, accepted, or claimed to have met the legal standard of causation\n          the majority now adopts. See Appellants' Brief at 37 (arguing that \"[t]h\n          does not require a demonstration that the practice in and of itself resul\n          discriminatory result,\" and claiming to have \"demonstrated that historic,\n          political, and socio-economic discrimination interacts with the non-votin\n          to disproportionately disenfranchise Latinos and African-American voters\"\n          at 14, 31, 41 n.8 (arguing that the purge law, operating in conjunction w\n          social and historical conditions, was a contributing cause of the\n          disproportionate purging of Latinos and blacks); see also A. at 18-20\n          (plaintiffs' complaint, not pleading any view of § 2 causation). Nor have\n          plaintiffs pleaded or argued the opposite extreme -- that causation is\n          irrelevant. As they state in their brief, they accept that in order to p\n          they must show that the discriminatory result of which they complain must\n          attributable, in part, to the law they challenge. Appellants' Brief at 4\n          n.8. Of course, even if the plaintiffs had taken either of the directly\n          opposing erroneous positions the majority attributes to them, that would\n          require us to adopt an erroneous construction of § 2 in deciding this cas\n\n\n                                               15\n\flink, between those factors and the purge law.    Id. at 25.   After all, nothing in t\n\nrecord suggests that the non-voting purge makes black and Latino residents of Phila\n\nso much worse off.   It is not the purge law that causes members of minority groups\n\nless frequently, and therefore to lose the ability to vote more often by removing t\n\ndisproportionately high rates from the registration rolls. That is the kind of \"leg\n\ndispositive\" causal connection that the majority would require the plaintiffs to es\n\nin order to prevail on their § 2 claim.0\n0\n     The majority's reading of the Senate Report casts additional light on the subs\n          of its rationale. In its view, the Report expresses the expectation that\n          would \"focus on the challenged procedure and its causal consequences . .\n          Maj. Op. Typescript at 14 n.6. The \"focus\" the majority has in mind, how\n          is quite restrictive; it encompasses nothing more than the challenged law\n          it excludes all other factors that the law has not created, but which\n          nonetheless might contribute to the law's effect. Thus, under the majori\n          reading of the Senate Report, Congress has instructed that § 2 might proh\n          purge statute which \"itself\" produces discriminatory results. Id.\n\n\n     The Senate Report does support the well-settled point that plaintiffs must pro\n     causal connection between the law they challenge and the discriminatory result\n     identify. Congress in no way, however, expressed any agreement with the majori\n     view that the challenged law must itself account for its unlawful effects. Ac\n     to the Senate Report, a court's \"focus\" must remain broad and varying enough t\n     encompass the totality of the circumstances with which a voting practice invar\n     interacts to influence the nature of political processes.\n\n     In concluding its opinion, the majority appears to abandon its causation argum\n     The dissent might have meaning, it states, in a § 2 challenge to registration\n     procedures in which plaintiffs alleged that as a result of socioeconomic\n     disadvantages, they experienced greater difficulty traveling to registration c\n     or in some other way availing themselves of registration opportunities. Maj.\n     Typescript at 29. That surprising comment cannot be reconciled with the major\n     legal argument. If the conditions of inequality the district court found here\n     extraneous to the plaintiffs' legal claim, those circumstances could not be re\n     in the hypothetical suit the majority describes. In neither case could member\n     protected class show that the laws they challenged caused the practical diffic\n     they experienced. In neither case would the laws themselves be responsible fo\n\n\n                                             16\n\f          Finally, the majority reasons that this type of causation could not, unde\n\ncircumstances, exist here, because a non-voting purge law, by its very nature, only\n\naffects people who have managed to register at least once.   Maj. Op. Typescript at\n\nSuch people, it points out, must have already demonstrated their ability to overcom\n\nwhatever barriers might prevent them from participating in the political process, a\n\nlaw that merely requires them to do so again could not violate §2.     Id.   The premis\n\nunderlying this reasoning can only be that unless a law has prevented members of a\n\nprotected class from ever having registered or cast a vote, it is permissible under\n\nVoting Rights Act.\n\n          According to the Supreme Court, the essence of a § 2 claim is that a cert\n\nelectoral law interacts with other circumstances to cause unequal political opportu\n\nGingles, 478 U.S. at 47.   The majority takes a different position.    In its view, th\n\nessence of a § 2 claim is that a certain electoral law actually causes whatever\n\ncircumstances might contribute to the deprivation of political equality of which a\n\nplaintiff complains. Respectfully, that is an unsupported and insupportable distort\nthe Voting Rights Act with which I could not disagree more strongly.\n\n\n     disparately harmful effects on minority citizens. Rather, under the majority'\n     theory of § 2 causation, the unfortunate results of whatever registration laws\n     in mind would merely represent another of \"society's voting ills\" that would n\n     subject to challenge under the Voting Rights Act.\n\n     I do not know and cannot guess why the majority believes that I am actually co\n     with Philadelphia registration procedures that the plaintiffs have not challen\n     rather than with what I view as the discriminatory effect of the non-voting pu\n     law. I also cannot perceive a difference between the majority's hypothetical\n     where, it states, socioeconomic disadvantages might have meaning --and the one\n     us now. In any event, I do not read the majority's conclusion as expressing a\n     purposeful modification or qualification of its earlier analysis of § 2 causat\n\n\n                                             17\n\f          The majority offers a simple explanation for the fact that a disproportio\n\nhigh number of Latinos and blacks have been removed from Philadelphia's registratio\n\nrolls: minority citizens are purged more because they vote less.     The majority's re\n\nof § 2 does not require it to know anything more about the underlying causes of the\n\neffect.   It need not look any deeper, or any more closely.     It need not concern its\n\nwith why blacks and Latinos vote less; so long as the purge law itself is not respo\n\nno violation of § 2 has occurred.\n\n           The majority's explanation for the purge law's effect -- the fact that mi\n\nvoters simply do not vote as often --does not explain much.     Rather, that fact lies\n\nthe surface of the past and present reality confronting members of minority groups\n\nmight try to participate in the political process.     As the district court demonstra\n\nis not difficult to look beneath the surface.      And contrary to the majority's view,\n\ninquiry is not only important, but necessary.      The majority has erred in concluding\n\n§ 2 does not require a more searching evaluation of the reasons why Latinos and bla\n\nnot vote as often.\n          The district court recognized that the lower minority turnout statistics\n\npart be attributable to discrimination and the overall socioeconomic status of mino\n\nin Philadelphia.\"    Ortiz, 824 F. Supp. at 535.    And regardless of any uncertainty t\n\ncourt had about the relationship between discrimination and socioeconomic disadvant\n\non the one hand, and lower participation rates, on the other, Congress and the Supr\n\nCourt have provided answers.   The Senate Report states that, as the Court observed\n\nWhite, disadvantages in education, employment, income levels, and living conditions\narising from past discrimination tend to depress minority political participation.\n\n\n\n                                              18\n\fRep. at 29.   \"Where these conditions are shown,\"   the Report continues, \"and where\n\nlevel of black participation in politics is depressed, plaintiffs need not prove an\n\nfurther causal nexus between their socioeconomic status and the depressed level of\n\npolitical participation.\"   Id.0\n\n         As early as 1899, W.E.B.

See W.\n\n\n0\n     Significantly, in White -- the case from which Congress borrowed the words th\n     make up § 2, and on which Congress relied most heavily in explaining what it\n     intended that language to mean -- the Court did not look for or require any \"\n     between the challenged reapportionment plan and the factors that contributed\n     plan's discriminatory effect. White recounts, among other circumstances, the\n     following findings: Texas had a \"history of official racial discrimination .\n     which at times touched upon the right of Negroes to register and vote and\n     participate in the democratic processes\", 412 U.S. at 767; \"the Bexar communi\n     along with other Mexican-Americans in Texas, had long `suffered from, and con\n     to suffer from, the results and effects of invidious discrimination and treat\n     the fields of education, employment, economics, health, politics, and others'\n     U.S. at 768 (footnote omitted; quoting district court opinion); and \"[t]he ty\n     Mexican-American suffers a cultural and language barrier that makes his\n     participation in community processes extremely difficult . . . .\" Id.

Plainly, these social and historical conditions had\n     been brought about by a reapportionment plan that Texas promulgated in 1971.\n     Rather, they interacted with the challenged multimember districts to result i\n     invidious discrimination. As the Supreme Court stated, \"[b]ased on the total\n     the circumstances,\" the district court had properly assessed the lawfulness o\n     multimember district, \"overlaid, as it was, on the cultural and economic real\n     of the plaintiff class.

[T]hey have a survival mode. They have to be able to\n          put some food on the table for the next day. And we've had\n          difficulties trying to convince folks that the political system is\n          going to make a difference in their lives, that by participating in\n          the process, they're going to effect a change.\n\nA. at 127 (repetitive speech omitted).   Black and Latino residents of Philadelphia,\n\nas the district court found, have suffered discrimination and disadvantage in every\n\nsocioeconomic category, have fewer resources to devote to the tasks of registration\n\nvoting.   Moreover, their experience has often taught them that such efforts will no\n\nimprove their lives. Frustration and alienation can lead to apathy, which decreases\n\nparticipation, which further erodes the political power of minority groups.    Judge\n0\n     The evaluation need not be particularly searching. As the district court put\n     \"In fact, in evaluating a challenge to an election procedure pursuant to § 2,\n     would be myopic for a court to overlook the impact that [socio-economic] fact\n     have on minority voter turnout.\" Ortiz, 824 F. Supp. at 525. Under the major\n     construction of § 2, however, courts have no need for even limited vision of\n     underlying causes which contribute to a challenged law's effect.\n\n\n                                             20\n\fdescribed this cycle of discrimination, disadvantage, and disenfranchisement in Uni\n\nStates v.

Thus, for Latinos and blacks, having their registration\n\nnullified only confirms what they are more likely to already believe: that given th\n\nhigher costs and lower benefits of participating in the political process, there is\n\nno point in making the effort.\n\n          Even if we could not achieve our own understanding of this reality, its t\n\nplain enough that Congress and the Supreme Court have told us to take it on faith.\n\nciting White, the Senate Report states that where plaintiffs can show socioeconomic\n\ndisadvantage and discrimination along with depressed rates of political participati\n\nthey need not prove any further causal nexus between these facts.    Sen. Rep. at 29\nOf course, if the majority is right, the existence of such a causal nexus would def\n\nchallenge to a law that had a disparate impact on those who voted less often.    The\n\nmajority, once again, would require the plaintiffs here to have proven that the pur\n\nitself caused minority voters to be removed from the registration rolls at\n\ndisproportionately high rates.    Factors like poverty, lack of education, and inabil\n\nfind work or housing as a result of discrimination, it states, are simply not relev\n\nMaj. Op. Typescript at 25.    However, we know that while the non-voting purge law ma\nsome part in further discouraging black and Latino political participation, it is l\n\n\n\n                                              21\n\fsocietal discrimination and socioeconomic disadvantage, of the sort the district co\n\nfound, that operate to depress minority turnout rates.    If discrimination and disad\n\ncause blacks and Latinos to vote less often, which we discover by consulting either\n\nrecord or reality, then the purge law itself cannot be responsible for removing so\n\nmore members of these groups from the registration rolls.     That is undeniable. The\n\nplaintiffs do not and cannot argue otherwise.     So, if the majority is right, Congre\n\nthe Supreme Court -- by relieving plaintiffs of the need to prove a causal connecti\n\nbetween discrimination and socioeconomic disadvantage, on the one hand, and lower\n\nparticipation rates, on the other -- have effectively immunized non-voting purge la\n\n§ 2 challenges.   Such laws cannot be responsible for the disparate impact they have\n\nas a matter of law, discrimination and disadvantage are at least principally to bla\n\nClearly, though, Congress and the Court have done no such thing, and the majority h\n\nerred in its construction of § 2.\n\n          The district and appellate court decisions in Mississippi State Chapter,\n\nOperation PUSH v.

In Operation PUSH, the plai\n\nchallenged two Mississippi registration laws: one, the State's \"dual registration\n\nprocess,\" required citizens to register first with a county registrar in order to v\n\nfederal, state, and county elections, and again with a municipal clerk in order to\n\nmunicipal elections; the other, the State's prohibition of \"satellite registration,\nseverely limited the extent to which citizens could register at places other than t\n\n\n\n                                             22\n\fregistrar's office.

Operation PUSH I, 674 F. Supp. at 1268.    Of course, Mississippi's registratio\n\nhad not themselves caused the failure of blacks to register as often as whites.     Th\n\ninequality occurred, as the court of appeals put it, \"[b]ecause a significant perce\n\nof Mississippi's black citizens do not have (1) access to the transportation necess\n\ntravel to the county courthouse to register or (2) the type of jobs that would allo\n\nto leave work during business hours to register to vote . . . .\"     Operation PUSH II\n\nF.2d at 403; see also Operation PUSH I, 674 F.

Supp. at 1\n       In particular, the court focused on three significant forms of socioeconomic\n       disadvantage: (1) \"that black workers in Mississippi predominate in blue-coll\n       service worker positions in which they are likely to be working for an hourly\n       and are less likely to be able to take off from work to register to vote duri\n       regular office hours . . . [;]\" (2) that \"black citizens are also much less a\n       than whites to travel to the county courthouse, or other centralized voter\n       registration locations\" because black households were much less likely to hav\n       vehicle available; and (3) that \"a disproportionately high percentage of blac\n       households do not have a telephone available for household use,\" which made i\n       difficult for blacks to obtain information about procedures for registering.\n       1253, 1256. Because of these disadvantages, the district court concluded, bla\n       experienced greater difficulty in overcoming the administrative barriers to\n       registering that Mississippi had created through its challenged laws.

The only question, in its view, was whether the court\n\nerred in finding that blacks had registered in significantly lower numbers.    Operat\n\nPUSH III, 932 F.2d at 409-13.    Given the evidentiary support for the trial judge's\n\ndetermination that such a disparity did exist, the Eleventh Circuit upheld the deci\n\nthat the challenged laws, and the effect they had, violated § 2.\n\n          Unlike the majority, the Operation PUSH courts did not merely note that b\n\nregistered less often, and that the registration laws themselves were not responsib\n\nthe disparity.   Instead, the courts looked to the way in which the challenged laws\n\ninteracted with social and historical conditions, such as the class members' occupa\n\nstatus and limited access to transportation and information, to result in a lack of\n\nopportunity for the plaintiffs to participate in the political process.    The obviou\n\nthat the causes of those conditions had little or nothing to do with the challenged\n\nregistration laws was legally irrelevant to the Operation PUSH courts, which clearl\n\nnot share the majority's understanding of § 2.0\n\n\n0\n      The majority's attempt to distinguish the Operation PUSH cases is unpersuasiv\n      states that in Operation PUSH, unlike this case, the challenged voting laws w\n      \"the causes of black voters' registering at lower rates than white voters.\"\n      Op. Typescript at 24 n.17 (emphasis added). The Operation PUSH courts, howev\n      clearly did not find, and did not require the plaintiffs to show, that Missis\n      registration procedures were \"the causes\" of the statistical disparity in\n      registration rates. There was no established causal \"link\" -- as the majorit\n      it elsewhere -- between the challenged laws, on the one hand, and either the\n      of jobs black residents held, or the facts that they possessed fewer cars and\n      telephones, on the other. Rather, those conditions interacted with the regis\n      procedures to produce a discriminatory result, and that constituted a violati\n      § 2.\n\n      The majority's treatment of Operation PUSH also suggests that it sees a meani\n      difference between laws that make registration more difficult to begin with,\n\n\n                                               24\n\f          United States v.

The Eleventh Circuit rejected the distr\n\ncourt's findings as clearly erroneous and reversed.\n\n          In reaching its decision, the Marengo County court relied, in part, on th\n\nplaintiffs' showings that (1) the County Board of Registrars was open infrequently\n\nnever visited outlying areas to register rural voters, and (2) the County had not\n\npermitted a black person to serve as a deputy registrar.

The\n\nof appeals responded:\n               These policies, however, unquestionably discriminated against\n          blacks because fewer blacks were registered. . . . By holding short\n          hours the Board made it harder for unregistered voters, more of whom\n          are black than white, to register. By meeting only in Linden the\n          Board was less accessible to eligible rural voters, who were more\n          black than white. By having few black poll officials and spurning the\n          voluntary offer of a black citizen to serve as a registrar, county\n          officials impaired black access to the political system and the\n          confidence of blacks in the system's openness.\n\n\n\n\n     one hand, and laws that make it more difficult for someone to stay registered\n     the other. In my view, that is not a reasonable distinction.\n\n\n                                             25\n\fMarengo County, 731 F.2d at 1570 (footnote and citation omitted). Like the Operatio\n\ncourts, the Eleventh Circuit did not require the plaintiffs to prove that the measu\n\nthey challenged were responsible for their failure to register or vote.     In fact, i\n\nrejecting the district court's finding that blacks had simply failed to overcome th\n\napathy, the court explained that a variety of social and historical circumstances\n\naccounted for the fact that blacks participated in significantly lower numbers than\n\nwhites.   Id. at 1568, 1574.    Those proven circumstances, in conjunction with the\n\nchallenged voting practices, had a discriminatory effect on blacks.     For that reaso\n\ncourt concluded, the record compelled a finding that the County's at-large election\n\nviolated § 2.   Id. at 1574.0\n\n          The majority relies on Salas v. Southwest Texas Junior College Dist., 964\n\n1542 (5th Cir. 1992), for the proposition that \"a protected class is not entitled t\n\nrelief merely because it turns out in a lower percentage than whites to vote.\" Maj.\n\nTypescript at 21.   The context of that statement, however, reveals that Salas provi\n\nsupport for the majority's holding.     In Salas, Hispanic voters, who constituted a m\nof the registered voters in an at-large district, challenged the use of the at-larg\n\n0\n     Other cases that do not share the majority's view of § 2 include: Harris v.\n     Graddick, 593 F. Supp. 128 (M.D. Ala. 1984) (awarding an injunction to black\n     citizens who claimed that a state's failure to appoint greater numbers of bla\n     officials violated § 2), and sub nom., Harris v. Siegelman, 695 F. Supp. 517\n     Ala. 1988) (holding that plaintiffs established violations of § 2, based on t\n     conclusion that social and historical circumstances interacted with the chall\n     law, as well as with the disproportionately low number of black polling offic\n     to discourage black political participation); and Brown v. Dean, 555 F. Supp.\n     (D.R.I. 1982) (enjoining a city's use of a polling facility based on a findin\n     the facility's location would be a substantial deterrent to voting by a class\n     black residents).\n\n\n\n                                               26\n\fsystem (as opposed to single-member districts) under § 2.     The court held that the\n\nplaintiffs had failed to satisfy the third element of the threshold test for vote d\n\nclaims that the Supreme Court adopted in Thornburg v. Gingles, because they had not\n\ndemonstrated that white bloc voting usually prevented Hispanics from electing their\n\npreferred representatives.   Salas, 964 F.2d at 1555.   The Fifth Circuit reasoned th\n\nthough the plaintiffs were members of a class that included a majority of the regis\n\nvoters in the challenged district, they might nonetheless, in some instances, have\n\nable to show that minority bloc voting frustrated their chances of electoral succes\n\nFor example, if such plaintiffs could establish that they faced \"practical impedime\n\nvoting\" or that \"low turnout at elections was the result of prior official\n\ndiscrimination,\" they could prove that their registered majority did not allow the\n\nto overcome opposition from a cohesive minority of whites.    Id. at 1555-56. In such\n\ncircumstances, which the plaintiffs in Salas had failed to prove, an at-large distr\n\nwould be subject to a § 2 challenge brought by members of a majority class.     But th\n\nplaintiffs had not accounted, in any way, for their inability to take advantage of\nmajority status.   In that context, we can understand the court's statement that \"a\n\nprotected class is not entitled to § 2 relief merely because it turns out in a lowe\n\npercentage than whites to vote.\"   Salas, 964 F.2d at 1556.\n\n          Here, the plaintiffs are not members of a majority class confronting the\n\ndifficult task of satisfying the Gingles preconditions.   The questions this case pr\n\nand the factors that we must take into account in providing answers, are somewhat\n\ndifferent.   Nonetheless, to the extent that Salas does provide guidance, the decisi\nactually rejects the majority's reading of the Voting Rights Act.    According to the\n\n\n\n                                             27\n\fCircuit, the plaintiffs in Salas could have prevailed if they had shown the existen\n\n\"practical impediments to voting\" or low turnout rates resulting from prior discrim\n\n(as may have occurred here, according to the district court).   Those circumstances,\n\ncourt reasoned, could interact with the state's districting plan in such a way as t\n\ndeprive class members of an equal opportunity to participate in the political proce\n\nto elect their chosen representatives.   Under the majority's construction of § 2, h\n\nthe Salas plaintiffs would have needed to prove that the voting measure they challe\n\nan at-large district, actually caused the practical impediments to voting or the lo\n\nturnout rates that compromised their chances for success.   Of course, that is an\n\nimpossible requirement.   District lines, like purge laws, cannot by themselves caus\n\n\"totality of the circumstances\" that courts are supposed to consider in applying §\n\nFifth Circuit would not have required the Salas plaintiffs to make such a showing.\n\nmajority here, in contrast, holds that because Pennsylvania's non-voting purge law\n\nitself the cause of blacks' and Latinos' failure to vote more often, the plaintiffs\n\nnot established a violation of § 2.   Salas does not take that view, and neither do\n\n0\n     In addition to Salas, the majority relies on Irby v. Virginia State Board of\n     Elections, 889 F.2d 1352 (4th Cir. 1989). It is difficult to overstate the\n     differences between Irby and the case before us. In Irby, a group of individ\n     black plaintiffs and two civil rights organizations challenged a law that pro\n     for the appointment, rather than the election, of school board members. Firs\n     assuming appointive systems are subject to challenge under § 2 -- a propositi\n     about which the Fourth Circuit expressed \"considerable doubt\", Irby, 889 F.2d\n     1357 -- the legal and factual variables involved in such a case, where no vot\n     no electing has ever occurred, could not be comparable to those involved here\n     elsewhere). Second, in Irby, the plaintiffs had failed to show any causal\n     connection between the selection system they challenged and the underrepresen\n     of blacks on school boards; for example, the court pointed out, in one of the\n     counties where a statistically significant disparity did exist, every black r\n     who had requested appointment to the school board since 1971 had been selecte\n\n\n                                             28\n\f          In amending § 2, Congress devoted most of its attention to vote dilution\n\nWhite v. Register, for example, the case from which Congress drew the legal standar\n\ndefining a violation of § 2, involved a challenge to state reapportionment plans.\n\nZimmer v. McKeithen, 485 F.2d 1297 (5th Cir. 1973), which articulated and enumerate\n\nfactors that the Court had taken into consideration in White, addressed the legalit\n\nmulti-member districts.   The Senate Report's now-familiar list of \"typical\" (but no\n\nexclusive or required) factors that plaintiffs can show in establishing a violation\n\nis drawn directly from Zimmer.   See Sen. Rep. at 29.   Congress made clear, however,\n\nwhile it had focused and relied mainly on vote dilution cases in amending § 2 and\n\nexplaining the new provision's meaning, § 2 would continue to prohibit \"all voting\n\ndiscrimination,\" including \"episodic\" practices which did not involve the \"permanen\n\nstructural barriers\" to political equality seen in the vote dilution context. Sen.\n\n30.   The Report explains:\n                If the challenged practice relates to such a series of events or\n           episodes, the proof sufficient to establish a violation would not\n           necessarily involve the same factors as the courts have utilized when\n           dealing with permanent structural barriers. Of course, the ultimate\n           test would be the White standard codified by this amendment of Section\n           2: whether, in the particular situation, the practice operated to deny\n\n      member. Id. at 1358. In light of those facts, the Fourth Circuit concluded\n      the appointive system did not produce a disparate effect. Id. at 1359. The I\n      court had no occasion even to consider a causation requirement such as the on\n      majority adopts here, because the challenged practice played no part in bring\n      about the lower number of blacks on the two school boards. Such a situation\n      at all similar to one in which a purge law directly removes disproportionatel\n      numbers of minority citizens from the registration rolls.\n\n      At the very most, Irby provides incremental support for the position that § 2\n      plaintiffs must show some causal connection between a challenged voting pract\n      the disparity at issue. As I have stated, that is not a controversial point,\n      neither the plaintiffs nor I suggest otherwise.\n\n\n                                             29\n\f           the minority plaintiff an equal opportunity to participate and to\n           elect candidates of their choice.\n\nId.   Thus, events or episodes occurring during the administration of elections that\n\nresulted in unequal political opportunity would remain unlawful, although the facto\n\nrelevant to proving such discriminatory effects might well be different from those\n\ninvolved in vote dilution cases.\n\n           In a footnote to the statement quoted above, Congress mentions purging as\nvariety of the \"episodic discrimination\" that § 2 would continue to prohibit.0    The\n\nstates: \"[P]urging of voters could produce a discriminatory result if fair procedur\n\nnot followed, Toney v. White, 488 F.2d 310 (5th Cir. 1973), or if the need for a pu\n\nwere not shown or if opportunities for re-registration were unduly limited.\"     Sen.\n\n30 n.119 (emphasis added).0   For two reasons, this statement does not support an\n\naffirmance here.   First, as I discuss at greater length below, the City did not pro\n\nneed\" for Pennsylvania's non-voting purge law.    The district court found that the l\n\n\n0\n       While purging could be conducted \"episodically\" -- that is, on discrete occas\n       in a related series of events -- I would not describe the annual operation of\n       Pennsylvania's non-voting purge law as \"episodic.\" It is not \"structural\" in\n       same way as a redistricting plan; nor is it temporary, however, and the law p\n       its discriminatory effects in a reliable and consistent manner from year to y\n       Therefore, I will not refer to the kind of purging that occurred in this case\n       \"episodic\" voting practice.\n0\n       By making clear that purging can violate § 2, the Senate Report creates a pot\n       problem for the majority's argument that these laws, because they only affect\n       individuals who have registered and voted, must be permissible. The majority\n       with this problem by emphasizing that in each example of unlawful purging the\n       Report mentions, it is the statute \"itself\" that produces a discriminatory re\n       Putting aside, for the moment, my more important disagreements with the major\n       reading of § 2's legislative history, and with its theory of causation, the f\n       remains that even a purge law that itself produces unlawful results can only\n       voters who have already registered. This troublesome point, however, is only\n       minor symptom of the infirmity afflicting the majority's argument.\n\n\n                                             30\n\fserved the legitimate purpose of preventing fraud, but laws are not necessary merel\n\nbecause they serve a valid purpose.    Second, Congress mentioned purging as an examp\n\nthe \"episodic discrimination\" that would remain within the scope of § 2, and the ty\n\npurges it listed in the one sentence it devoted to the subject are merely more spec\n\nexamples of the way in which purging can have a \"discriminatory result.\"    Congress\n\nprovided no indication that purging could not produce discriminatory results, and t\n\nviolate § 2, in other ways.    Indeed, such a suggestion would run directly counter t\n\nflexible approach to § 2 cases that Congress intended courts to follow in situation\n\ninvolving different factual and legal variables.0\n\n          In the majority's view, however, the Senate Report's brief and illustrati\n\nreference to purging contains an \"implicit\" recognition \"that a purge statute which\n\nadministered fairly, and in an even-handed manner, would not run afoul of the law.\"\n\nOp. Typescript at 14 n.6.     I have no idea where the majority finds such an implicat\n\nThe text of the footnote plainly does not support it.    See Ortiz, 824 F. Supp. at 5\n\n(recognizing that the list in the footnote merely \"provides several examples of how\npurging voters could violate § 2,\" and that it does not \"establish any prerequisite\n\nplaintiffs . . . must establish in order to state a cognizable claim under the Act\"\n\nalso, Steve Barber et al., Comment, The Purging of Empowerment: Voter Purge Laws an\n\nVoting Rights Act, 23 Harv.

Supp. at 524; see\n      Jenkins, 4 F.3d at 1125, 1129 (recognizing the need to maintain a flexible ap\n      in order to promote the goals and underlying principles of the Voting Rights\n\n\n                                              31\n\fproduce a discriminatory result, rather than an exhaustive list of the only ways in\n\npurges could violate Section 2\").   Moreover, Congress expressly disavowed the kind\n\npurpose the majority believes it implied, stating: \"[E]ven a consistently applied p\n\npremised on a racially neutral policy would not negate a plaintiff's showing throug\n\nfactors that the challenged practice denies minorities fair access to the process.\"\n\nRep. at 29 n.117.   Finally, under the majority's perception of what Congress implic\n\nrecognized, not even all the examples included in the Report's brief reference to p\n\nwould constitute violations of § 2.   An unnecessary purge law that \"unduly limited\"\n\nopportunities for re-registration, for instance, would not, in the majority's view,\n\nafoul of the Voting Rights Act so long as the law was administered fairly.   Congres\n\nstatements, which express a different view, do not dissuade the majority from relyi\n\nan unsupported implication that would severely, and I believe improperly, limit the\n\nof § 2 in challenges to the purging of registered voters.\n\n          The Senate Report acknowledges that especially outside the context of vot\n\ndilution claims, the factors that courts should consider in determining whether a\nchallenged voting practice violates § 2 may well be different than those appearing\n\nlist of \"typical\" factors drawn from White and Zimmer. The Report does not, however\n\nprovide any guidance with respect to what factors courts should consider in the typ\n\ncase we confront here.   The majority makes no effort to identify or explore the\n\nconsiderations that figure into an evaluation of the effect and legality of a non-v\n\npurge law, probably because, in light of its theory of causation, it sees no need t\n\nso. The district court, in contrast, addressed this important question, see Ortiz,\nSupp. at 523-24, and I agree with some of its conclusions.   As the district court\n\n\n\n                                             32\n\frecognized, the factors making up the threshold test for vote dilution claims that\n\nSupreme Court adopted in Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. at 49-51, have little place\n\n§ 2 challenge to a purge law. Ortiz, 824 F. Supp. at 523 (describing the Gingles\n\npreconditions as \"peripheral issues bearing limited relevance to the plaintiffs' cl\n\nsee also Operation PUSH I, 674 F. Supp. at 1264 (concluding that the occurrence of\n\npolarized voting is not germane to a § 2 challenge to registration procedures); cf.\n\nv. Treen, 574 F. Supp. 325, 350 (E.D. La. 1983) (three-judge court) (\"To the extent\n\nthe enumerated factors are not factually relevant, they may be replaced or substitu\n\nother, more meaningful factors.\").   The size, geographic insularity, and political\n\ncohesion of minority or majority groups are all irrelevant to the question of wheth\n\nnon-voting purge statute has a discriminatory effect.   Such a law operates to nulli\n\nregistration of individuals who fail to vote or reinstate themselves.   Therefore, t\n\nimportant factors are those that influence peoples' willingness and ability to part\n\nor seek reinstatement.   As discussed, the existence of discrimination and socioecon\n\ndisadvantage is of primary importance among those factors.0   Other significant\n\nconsiderations could include: a history of official discrimination in voting, effor\nwith the design or effect of limiting the political power of minority groups, the\n\ndifficulty minority constituents have experienced in trying to elect their preferre\n\ncandidates, and a lack of responsiveness on the part of elected officials to the\n\n0\n      Contrary to the majority's assertion, I have not stated, nor do I believe, th\n      societal conditions such as discrimination and socioeconomic disadvantage\n      \"constitute\" the totality of the circumstances that a court should consider i\n      evaluating the legality of a non-voting purge statute. Rather, those factors\n      particularly significant circumstances, among others, which contribute to the\n      totality. Additionally, as should be clear, I do not mean for the list of re\n      factors I mention here to be exhaustive.\n\n\n                                             33\n\fparticular needs and concerns of minority communities.   Each of those factors could\n\nfurther discourage participation and therefore, each could interact with a non-voti\n\npurge statute to cause an unlawful abridgement of a group's opportunity to particip\n\nthe political process and to elect its chosen representatives.0\n\n          Given the majority's erroneous construction of § 2, however, this task of\n\nidentifying and weighing relevant factors is of secondary importance.   The critical\n\nit bears repeating, is that contrary to the majority's view, whatever the relevant\n\nare, they need not be products of, or causally linked to, a challenged voting law i\n\nto merit consideration in a court's determination of the law's effect and legality.\n\na law's interaction with the totality of the circumstances, and not its creation of\n\ncircumstances, that § 2 requires us to evaluate.\n\n                                             B.\n\n          The plaintiffs have argued that in order to prove that Pennsylvania's non\n\npurge law violates § 2, they must, in addition to showing the law's disparate impac\n\nblacks and Latinos, demonstrate that the State could achieve its legitimate goal of\npreventing election fraud in a less discriminatory way. As noted above, the Senate\n\nprovides some support for that position by stating that if the \"need for a purge\" i\n\nshown, the practice could constitute an instance of prohibited \"episodic discrimina\n\nSen. Rep. at 30 n.119.   Here, the plaintiffs want to take on the burden of proving\n\nPennsylvania does not need a purge law that results in the disenfranchisement of\n\n\n0\n      The existence of racial appeals, in contrast, could conceivably increase mino\n      turnout and thus work against any discriminatory effect that a non-voting pur\n      might have. I imagine that this factor could point either way, depending on\n      nature of the evidence presented in a particular case.\n\n\n                                             34\n\fdisproportionately high numbers of Latinos and blacks.   Moreover, they have asked u\n\nfind that they carried that burden at trial.\n\n          I agree with much, though not all, of the plaintiffs' argument.    In enact\n\namending § 2, Congress did not intend to mandate equal political opportunity at the\n\nexpense of state and local governments' abilities to pursue legitimate goals such a\n\nprevention of voting fraud.   Where measures are in fact necessary to achieve such\n\nobjectives, Congress would have surely meant for them to remain in effect.    There i\n\npoint in guaranteeing equal access to corrupt political processes that have no demo\n\nvalue.   To the contrary, the Voting Rights Act is premised on the existence of free\n\nfair elections that reflect popular will with accuracy and integrity, and it should\n\ninterpreted to prevent such elections from occurring.0 However, a voting practice th\n\ncompromises equality, as I believe Pennsylvania's purge statute does, should only b\n\npermitted if it is in fact necessary to achieve or preserve this type of public int\n\n0\n      I share the majority's concern about Philadelphia's need to guard against fra\n      voting practices in administering its elections. The dispute arising out of\n      State Senate race between Bruce Marks and William Stinson provides a recent r\n      of the seriousness of this problem. See Marks v. Stinson, 19 F.3d 873 (3d Ci\n      1994). Of course, as we all recognize, the City is no Newcomer to dishonest\n      election tactics. Nearly 100 years ago, Dr. Du Bois described the widespread\n      practice of buying votes in Philadelphia, and stated: \"To-day the government\n      city and State is unparalleled in the history of republican government for br\n      dishonesty and bare-faced defiance of public opinion.\" W.E.B. Du Bois, The\n      Philadelphia Negro: A Social Study 372, 376-77 (1899).\n0\n      According to the majority, \"it is well established that purge statutes are a\n      legitimate means by which the State can attempt to prevent voter fraud.\" Maj\n      Typescript at 20 & n.13. By \"legitimate,\" the majority cannot mean permissib\n      under § 2 of the Voting Rights Act. The published reports do not contain a s\n      case, other than this one, that decides a § 2 challenge to a non-voting purge\n      The only scholarship directly addressing the question argues that such laws a\n      likely to violate § 2. Barber, supra p. 34, at 517-527.\n\n\n\n                                               35\n\f          Title VII disparate-impact law, in my view, provides a particularly appro\n\nanalogy supporting the adoption of such a standard.   In disparate-impact cases, emp\n\ncan justify their use of challenged practices that have a greater negative effect o\n\nmembers of a protected class by proving that such practices constitute a \"business\n\nnecessity.\"   See, e.g., Griggs v. Duke Power, 401 U.S. 424, 431-32 (1971) (first\n\narticulating the concept of business necessity); Dothard v. Rawlinson, 433 U.S. 321\n\n32 (1977) (holding that defendant-employer failed to show business necessity, and t\n\ntherefore, plaintiffs properly prevailed in disparate-impact Title VII case); see a\n\n\n     The cases the majority credits with recognizing the well-established legitima\n     non-voting purge statutes all resolve constitutional, not statutory challenge\n     voting laws. And in fact, of the decisions on which the majority relies, onl\n     Hoffman v. Maryland, 928 F.2d 646 (4th Cir. 1991), involves a non-voting purg\n     In Hoffman, the court held that Maryland's five-year non-voting purge did not\n     violate the First Amendment because the law was content-neutral, was designed\n     serve the important state interest of curbing vote fraud, and did not unreaso\n     restrict alternative avenues of communication; the court also rejected the\n     plaintiffs' Fourteenth Amendment claim because they were not, as non-voters,\n     of a suspect class. This case, of course, unlike those the majority mentions,\n     been brought under § 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which no court has read to p\n     any and all voting laws that serve a valid purpose.\n\n     The majority surmises that § 2 challenges to purge laws have not been brought\n     because they would necessarily fail. Maj. Op. Typescript at 24-25. The assum\n     on which that theory rests, of course, is that if an untried claim had any me\n     would not be untried. I do not believe that is so. In the first of the seri\n     lectures that would be published as The Nature of the Judicial Process, then-\n     Cardozo described the judge's search for applicable precedent as an attempt \"\n     match the colors of the case at hand against the many sample cases spread out\n     their desk.\" Cardozo likened this process to a simple task of flipping throu\n     card index of decisions. However, he continued, \"It is when the colors do no\n     match, when the references in the index fail, when there is no decisive prece\n     that the serious business of the judge begins.\" Benjamin N. Cardozo, The Natu\n     the Judicial Process 20-21 (1921). The absence of cases deciding § 2 challen\n     purge laws only means that the legitimacy of such measures is not well-establ\n     and that we have serious business to do here.\n\n\n                                            36\n\fU.S.C.A. § 2000e-2(k)(1)(A), (C) (codifying the disparate-impact standards develope\n\nand following Griggs, including the business necessity defense, and nullifying Ward\n\nPacking Co. v.

I would take the same approach here.\n\nVII disparate-impact law, like § 2 of the Voting Rights Act, adopts a results test\n\nensuring that protected individuals will not suffer a deprivation of the type of eq\n\nopportunity that the law mandates.   Given the similarities between these two statut\n\nis not surprising that in Griggs, the Supreme Court relied on a Voting Rights Act c\n\nGaston County, North Carolina v. United States, 395 U.S. 285 (1969) (discussed infr\n\n53-54 n.30), in first explaining how and why Title VII prohibited the sort of\n\ndiscrimination challenged in a disparate-impact suit.0   Griggs's reliance on Gaston\n\nsupports the analogy I am suggesting.\n\n          If an employer can show that an employment practice that operates to the\n\ndisadvantage of minority workers is necessary to run its business, that practice is\n\npermissible. Similarly, in my view, if a state or local government can show that a\n\npractice that operates to the disadvantage of minority registrants is necessary to\nvalid election, that practice would not constitute a violation of § 2.0   While the\n0\n      Gaston County was brought under § 4(a) of the Voting Rights Act, 42 U.S.C.\n      § 1973b(a) (currently 42 U.S.C. § 1973b(a)(1)). Section 4(a) was -- and foll\n      its amendment, still is -- similar to § 2, aside from its placement of the bu\n      proof. It provides that a state or subdivision, in order to reinstate a susp\n      voting practice, must show that the practice has not been used \"for the purpo\n      with the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race\n      color.\"\n0\n      The majority relies on Wesley v. Collins, 791 F.2d 1255 (6th Cir. 1986), whic\n      involved a § 2 challenge to a law disenfranchising convicted felons. As the\n      majority notes, in concluding that the law did not violate the Voting Rights\n      the Wesley court emphasized \"the state's legitimate and compelling rationale\n      enacting the statute here in issue.\" Id. at 1261. Wesley is based, to a\n      significant extent, on legal principles that justifiably limit the civil righ\n\n\n                                               37\n\fplaintiffs here have volunteered to prove that Pennsylvania does not need its non-v\n\npurge law to guard against fraud, I would not require them to do so.    Consistent wi\n\nother results-based anti-discrimination law, defendants should bear the burden of p\n\nnecessity once plaintiffs establish the existence of a disparate impact.\n\n          The plaintiffs argue that the uncontroverted evidence they introduced at\n\n\"indisputably establishes that there are reasonable, less discriminatory alternativ\n\nPhiladelphia's non-voting purge.\"   Appellants' Brief at 32.    I disagree. Evidence d\n\nbecome indisputable merely because it is never disputed.   Some evidence fails on it\n\nwithout any help from opposing evidence.   Trial judges are not obligated to credit\n\nuncontroverted testimony; they can simply remain unpersuaded.    In this case, the di\n\ncourt never considered whether the City needed a non-voting purge law to prevent el\n\nfraud because the legal standard it adopted did not include this element.    The cour\n\nthat the policy reasons for the law were \"not tenuous,\" and that the law in fact se\n\nits intended purpose. \"Not tenuous,\" however, is a long way from necessary.    The\n\nplaintiffs' evidence would have easily supported a finding that practical, effectiv\ndiscriminatory alternatives to the purge do exist, but it did not \"indisputably est\n\nanything. As a court of appeals, we are in no position to resolve this question.\n\nTherefore, under my view of § 2 and the evidence presented, a remand would be appro\n\n\n\n\n     convicted felons. Id. at 1261-62. In that context, a court could readily co\n     that a statute disenfranchising felons was necessary to serve the state's com\n     penalogical interests. It is doubtful that the objective of restricting offe\n     rights to participate in civil society could be met in a different way. In a\n     event, because the plaintiffs here have not lost their rights by committing c\n     Wesley is distinguishable.\n\n\n                                             38\n\f           The majority, however, without the assistance of the district court, and\n\nevidentiary support, now finds that the non-voting purge law actually is \"needed\" t\n\nprevent electoral fraud.   Maj. Op. Typescript at 26 (relying on \"a review of the re\n\nand present reality\").    That is an unfounded conclusion.    Again, I do not dispute t\n\npurge law serves a valid purpose; I accept the district court's finding that the la\n\nuseful in preventing fraud.   But neither the anecdotal incidents the majority menti\n\nthe record show anything more.   Contrary to the majority's apparent view, usefulnes\n\nnecessity are two entirely different things.    In order to find that the purge law i\n\nneeded, as the majority now does, a court must first consider whether equally effec\n\nbut less discriminatory alternatives exist, which neither the district court nor th\n\nmajority has ever done.\n\n           The testimony of Emmett Fremaux, Jr., whom the district court qualified a\n\nexpert on election and voter registration procedures, provides the only evidence in\n\nrecord on the subject of alternatives to the non-voting purge law.      Fremaux testifi\n\nthe law's important purposes could be achieved more effectively through other mecha\nwhich, unlike purge laws, would not have a pronounced discriminatory effect.      A. at\n\n316.   He based his opinion, to a significant extent, on his experience in administe\n\nregistration and election procedures in Washington, D.C., which had successfully re\n\nits non-voting purge law with a \"mail canvass\" system.       In addition, Fremaux stated\n\nlarge cities run clean elections without relying on non-voting purges.      A. at 331.\n\n           Through this testimony, the plaintiffs introduced uncontroverted evidence\n\nmore effective, less discriminatory alternatives to a non-voting purge law do exist\nMoreover, the City has not suggested that come January, 1995, when the National Vot\n\n\n\n                                               39\n\fRegistration Act becomes effective and puts an end to the non-voting purge (at leas\n\nelections for federal office),0 alarming numbers of voters will emerge from prior\n\nresidences or the grave to defile the integrity of Philadelphia elections.    In a ma\n\nmonths, purging will cease.   Elections, presumably, will not.   At oral argument, th\n\nstated that it had every intention of complying with the new law.   Apparently,\n\nPhiladelphia believes that starting next year, it will somehow manage without the p\n\nstatute that the majority finds it needs this year.0\n\n          The district court may not have been persuaded by the evidence that viabl\n\ndiscriminatory alternatives to purging do exist.   That, again, is its prerogative.\n\nMoreover, before considering the question on remand, the court might properly exerc\n\ndiscretion to allow the parties to present additional evidence on this issue.     The\n\ndid not do so at trial, no doubt, because it did not (and still does not) believe t\n\nquestion was legally relevant.\n\n\n\n0\n      See 42 U.S.C.S. § 1973gg-6(b). I discuss this legislation at greater length\n      infra pp. 54-57, 74 & n.40.\n0\n      I do not mean to suggest that the impending effectiveness of the National Vot\n      Registration Act constitutes conclusive proof that the purge statute is not\n      necessary. The City might be able to demonstrate that compliance will require\n      financial, administrative, or informational resources that it does not presen\n      possess. The district court could properly consider such an argument on rema\n\n      The impending unlawfulness of purging also does not constitute a reason to ta\n      case any less seriously. First, elections will be held later this year, and a\n      majority points out, the City has already begun to purge. Citizens whose\n      registration is nullified will not be able to vote, and they will not be\n      automatically reinstated when the practice becomes prohibited. Second, this\n      decision, like the discriminatory effects of the purge statute, is likely to\n      the statute itself. The cessation of purging will not cure the majority's er\n      construction of § 2.\n\n\n                                             40\n\f            While I do not accept the plaintiffs' argument that they have \"indisput\n\nestablished\" the existence of effective, less discriminatory alternatives to the s\n\n they challenge, they can at least point to substantial, even uncontroverted evide\n\n   support of that position.    The majority cannot make nearly as strong a case for\n\n    unassisted finding that Philadelphia does need the non-voting purge law to prev\n\n electoral fraud.   Unlike the majority, I do not believe that we are in any positi\n\ndecide this question.    Thus, while the purge statute may or may not be necessary, a\n\n                                     certainly is.    C.\n\n          To summarize, largely as a result of social and historical conditions ref\n\nin the district court's findings, black and Latino Philadelphians vote less often.\n\nBecause they vote less often, Pennsylvania's non-voting purge law operates to remov\n\nmembers of these protected classes from the registration rolls at disproportionatel\n\nhigher rates.   The purge law, as the majority emphasizes, is not the sole or primar\n\nof the circumstances with which it interacts to limit the opportunity of blacks and\n\nLatinos to vote in Philadelphia.   In my view, however, neither § 2 nor the decision\nconstruing it require the plaintiffs to make such an implausible showing, and the m\n\nhas erred in concluding otherwise.   Finally, given the demonstrated disparate impac\n\nthe non-voting purge law, and the way in which it interacts with social and histori\n\nconditions to deprive members of protected classes of an equal opportunity to parti\n\nin the political process, I would require the City to establish that the law is nec\n\nto prevent voting fraud.   That is a question that should be left, in the first inst\n\nto the district court.\n\n                                             III.\n\n\n\n                                              41\n\f          Both the district court and the majority place some importance on the abi\n\nblack and Latino voters to reinstate themselves after being slated for purging, or\n\nregister once purged.   Neither opinion clearly spells out the legal significance of\n\npossibility of reinstatement or re-registration.    The district court stated its ult\n\nconclusion as follows: \"Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that the purge law in\n\nwith social and historical conditions to deny minority voters equal access to the\n\npolitical process and to elect their preferred representatives, particularly since\n\nundisputed that the purge procedure is administered fairly and that there is ample\n\nopportunity for purged voters to re-register to vote.\"    Ortiz, 824 F. Supp. at 539.\n\ncourt further stated that \"[v]oters in jeopardy of being purged who are interested\n\npreserving their right to participate in the political process need only vote or re\n\nreinstatement to preserve that right.\"   Id.   The majority takes a similar position;\n\n\n0\n     This statement reveals that the district court based its conclusion, at least\n     part, on its view of the plaintiffs' opportunity to re-register. However, th\n     did not make any factual findings on this subject; we do not know how many pu\n     voters re-registered, or how many of those who did so are black or Latino.\n     Consequently, while the opportunity to re-register undeniably exists in a pur\n     formal sense, we do not have even the roughest measure of its practical effec\n     district court also did not explain why the possibility of re-registration wa\n     legally significant. If for no other reason -- and there are other reasons -\n     lack of factual and analytical precision, in what is otherwise an admirably t\n     and conscientious opinion, should necessitate a remand. In Jenkins, we state\n     \"[b]ecause the complexity of the proof and the importance of the issues invol\n     the district courts must be particularly thorough in explaining their finding\n     both the ultimate issue of vote dilution and on their subsidiary findings as\n     Jenkins, 4 F.3d at 1135 n.35. Section 2 cases that do not involve vote dilut\n     claims raise similarly complex and important issues and thus merit the same\n     thoroughness. The district court, which decided Ortiz before we issued Jenki\n     should be given a chance to comply with this instruction. The remainder of i\n     opinion demonstrates that even without our guidance, the court recognized the\n     propriety of devoting special efforts to this type of decision.\n\n\n                                               42\n\fview, disproportionate numbers of Latinos and blacks are purged \"because they do no\n\nand they do not take the opportunity of voting in the next election or requesting\n\nreinstatement.\"   Maj. Op. Typescript at 20-21.\n\n          As I explain above, the district court's conclusion that the non-voting p\n\nlaw does not interact with social and historical conditions to deny blacks and Lati\n\nequal access to the political process is irreconcilable with the factual findings o\n\nit bases its decision.   Thus, in my view, that conclusion is erroneous.0   Moreover,\n\n0\n     Because the majority is in complete agreement with the district court's legal\n     reasoning, it treats the court's ultimate conclusion that no § 2 violation oc\n     here as a purely factual one that we review only for clear error. Maj. Op.\n     Typescript at 16 & n.8. It is worth noting, however, that there is a substan\n     legal component to § 2 decisions, and that therefore, our standard of review\n     context is not as lenient as the majority opinion might suggest. Judge Becke\n     writing for the court in Jenkins, 4 F.3d 1103 (3d Cir. 1993), recently provid\n     instructive (and controlling) explanation of the applicable standard of revie\n     § 2 cases. Discussing the same language in Gingles v. Thornburg on which the\n     majority relies for the standard it applies, Jenkins points out that while th\n     district court's factual findings are entitled to deference under Rule 52(a)'\n     error standard:\n\n          \"Rule 52(a) `does not inhibit an appellate court's power to correct error\n          of law, including those that may infect a so-called mixed finding of law\n          fact, or a finding of fact that is predicated on a misunderstanding of th\n          governing rule of law.'\" This result is clearly necessary since both the\n          ultimate determination of vote dilution and the accompanying subsidiary\n          determinations often depend on important legal questions. Accordingly, w\n          must subject the district court's underlying legal analysis to plenary\n          review to ensure that the appropriate legal standards are applied. As th\n          [Gingles] Court concluded, it is this combination of factual deference an\n          legal review that best \"preserves the benefit of the trial court's\n          particular familiarity with the indigenous political reality without\n          endangering the rule of law.\"\n\n     Jenkins, 4 F.3d at 1116-17 (quoting Gingles, 478 U.S. at 79, in turn quoting\n     Corp. v. Consumers Union, 466 U.S. 485, 501 (1984)). While the majority may\n     disagree with the more complex standard of review we described in Jenkins, it\n\n\n                                             43\n\fplaintiffs' ability to reinstate or re-register themselves after being purged does\n\ncure the deprivation of equality that unlawfully results from the law's interaction\n\nthe totality of the circumstances.   A functional view of the political process, inf\n\nby a searching evaluation of past and present reality, reveals that for members of\n\nand language minority groups, neither reinstatement nor re-registration is an\n\ninsignificant barrier to participation. The majority's suggestion to the contrary f\n\nfrom its formalistic understanding of political opportunity and its failure to cons\n\nthe reality that Congress instructs us to consult in evaluating the legality of cha\n\nvoting laws under § 2.\n\n          Interestingly, the majority contrasts Pennsylvania's non-voting purge law\n\nsome better-known measures that states and localities have employed with the purpos\n\neffect of disenfranchising minority voters.   It points out, for example, that unlik\n\n\"`race-neutral' literacy tests,\" the purge law is not the type of device \"which\n\ndiscriminates against minorities, which has no rational basis, and which is beyond\n\ncontrol of minority voters.\"   Maj. Op. Typescript at 19.   But really, what would\ndistinguish a § 2 challenge brought against a facially neutral and evenly applied l\n\ntest, which had been adopted to further a state's legitimate interest in ensuring\n\nparticipation by a minimally informed electorate, from a § 2 challenge such as the\n\n     opinion does not fully convey the significance of the legal component of § 2\n     decisions.\n\n     I do not take issue with any of the subsidiary factual findings the district\n     made in this case. In my view, however, as I have stated, those findings can\n     reconciled with its ultimate conclusion that no § 2 violation occurred. My\n     disagreement with the district court, therefore, strikes me as more legal tha\n     factual. In any event, my position does not depend on the applicable standard\n     review.\n\n\n                                              44\n\fplaintiffs have brought here?0 Surely, members of protected classes can take the\n\nopportunity to learn to read (English).   Surely, the literacy test itself would not\n\nfault if they failed to do so.   The state would not have prevented such plaintiffs\n\nvoting.   Rather, under the majority's reasoning, the legally permissible explanatio\n\nthe literacy test's disparate impact would be that minority citizens learn to read\n\nstatistically lower rate than white voters. Literacy, after all, like filing a writ\n\nRequest for Reinstatement or a voter registration form, is not \"beyond the control\n\nminority voters.\"   In fact, reinstatement and re-registration require literacy, alo\n\nother skills and resources; without the ability to read, an individual will not eve\n\nthat he or she has been slated for purging, let alone be able to respond to such a\n\nby reinstatement or re-registration.   So what makes a well-intentioned, evenly appl\n\nand race-neutral literacy test objectionable under § 2, as the majority seems to ag\n\nis, while a device like Pennsylvania's non-voting purge law has no trouble passing\n\nscrutiny?   Why does one measure unlawfully discriminate against minorities, while t\n\nother does not?   The majority does not suggest an answer to these questions, and I\nimagine one.0\n0\n      I am aware that § 201 of the Voting Rights Act Amendments of 1970, as amended\n      U.S.C. § 1973aa, specifically prohibits the use of literacy tests. Hypotheti\n      however, such prerequisites to voting could also be challenged under § 2.\n0\n      In Gaston County, North Carolina v. United States, 395 U.S. 285 (1969), a cou\n      brought suit under § 4(a) of the Voting Rights Act seeking to reinstate a lit\n      test that it had formerly used as a prerequisite to registration. The Supreme\n      held that even if the test was administered in a fair and impartial manner, i\n      not be permissible. Gaston County, 395 U.S. at 296. In the Court's view, th\n      County had failed to disprove that \"use of its literacy test, coupled with it\n      racially segregated and unequal school system, discriminatorily deprived Negr\n      the franchise.\" Id. at 293. Of course, as the brief history of segregation\n      educational inequality set forth in the Court's opinion made clear, 395 U.S.\n      96, the literacy test was not responsible for the fact that a disproportionat\n\n\n                                             45\n\f          Of the more than 190,000 people who were slated for purging in 1991, all\n\nwhom, of course, had already taken the trouble to register in the first place, full\n\nfailed to reinstate themselves.   Reinstatement rates were consistently higher for w\n\nvoters than for blacks and Latinos.   The district court and majority opinions leave\n\npossible impression that the 156,000 or so voters who did not object to getting pur\n\njust lost interest in political participation. After all, nothing prevented them fr\n\nproperly filing a written Request for Reinstatement.   They had the opportunity.   Th\n\nsimply did not take it.   If these citizens had really wanted to preserve their abil\n\nvote, surely they could and would have done so.   As the district court put it, regi\n\nwho were \"interested in preserving their right to participate in the political proc\n\nneed[ed] only vote or request reinstatement to preserve that right.\"   Ortiz, 824 F.\n\nat 539.   Mass apathy, particularly among blacks and Latinos, is the only explanatio\n\ndisinterest is not actionable under the Voting Rights Act. See, e.g., Maj. Op. Type\n\nat 21 (relying on Salas for the proposition that members of a protected class are n\n\nentitled to relief under § 2 merely because they vote less often).   As the City sta\nits brief, the \"extra effort\" required to reinstate or re-register oneself \"is enti\n\nthe result of the apathy of individual voters.\"   Appellee's Brief at 42.\n\n          Viewed formalistically, the task of filing a written Request for Reinstat\n\nwith the Voter Registration Division of the City Commissioners Office might seem li\n\n     percentage of the black residents of Gaston County could not pass such a test\n     There was no evidence of a \"link,\" as the majority might put it, between the\n     challenged voting law and the plaintiffs' lack of reading skills. Nonetheles\n     according to the Court, that social and historical condition, \"coupled with\"\n     of even an impartially applied literacy test, resulted in a discriminatory\n     disenfranchisement of black citizens and therefore was not permissible under\n     Voting Rights Act.\n\n\n                                             46\n\feasy thing to do.   From a more practical perspective, however, based on the reinsta\n\nstatistics and a sense for past and present reality that is not diminished by troub\n\nassumptions about the behavior and motivations of black and Latino citizens, we sho\n\nknow better.   See Marengo County Comm'n, 731 F.2d at 1568 (\"Both Congress and the c\n\nhave rejected efforts to blame reduced black participation on `apathy'.\").\n\n          The record does not contain statistics showing how many voters re-registe\n\nbeing purged, or how many such voters are black or Latino.   We know that as a gener\n\nmatter, members of minority groups register in lower percentages than whites.   At t\n\nSandy Newman, the Executive Director of the plaintiff Project Vote, testified that\n\norganization's efforts to register minority voters, individuals attempting to fill\n\nregistration forms make errors or omissions in \"roughly half the cases.\"   A. at 93.\n\nCouncilman Ortiz and his aide, Israel Colon, described the special difficulties the\n\nexperienced in efforts to register Latinos, especially as a result of the language\n\nbarrier. A. at 50-51, 129.   According to testimony presented by Robert Lee, the Dir\n\nof the City's Voter Registration Division, his office rejected about 8,800 of the\nregistration forms submitted between April and October of 1992; about one out of ev\n\ntwenty forms failed to make the grade.   A. at 173.   Apparently, realistically, the\n\nre-registration does, in fact, create a significant obstacle to participation, espe\n\nfor members of minority groups.0\n\n\n0\n      The majority believes that I have overlooked the fact that individuals cannot\n      purged without having already demonstrated their ability to register. Maj. O\n      Typescript at 24. Registering, it points out, can be no harder the second ti\n      around than it was the first. Id. at 21 n.14. I have not overlooked this po\n      Rather, I believe it is partly unimportant and partly untrue.\n\n\n\n                                             47\n\f          Any doubt that the record leaves regarding the burden of re-registration\n\nanswered by the recent passage of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, P.L.\n\n31, 42 U.S.C.S. §§ 1973gg et seq. (popularly known as the motor-voter law).   In\n\nintroducing the National Voter Registration Act, Congress stated its finding that\n\n\"discriminatory and unfair registration laws and procedures can have a direct and d\n\neffect on voter participation . . . and disproportionately harm voter participation\n\n\n     As a general matter, doing something twice is more difficult than doing it on\n     Registering to vote is no exception. Just because some black and Latino citi\n     have overcome obstacles to political participation and registered at some poi\n     the past, there is no reason to believe that they will be able to do so again\n     even if they continue to have the ability to register (with whatever assistan\n     may have received previously), the task of filing a registration form, in a p\n     and timely manner, remains. Quite simply, registering twice is harder, and w\n     occur less frequently, than registering once.\n\n     Moreover, re-registering after being purged is different, and will often be m\n     difficult, than registering to begin with, because individuals who register a\n     later purged might not even be aware that they have lost their ability to vot\n     Representative Collins made exactly this point during the motor-voter law deb\n     stating: \"[I]f you are busy, as most people are, with the day to day tasks of\n     raising a family and working or trying to find a job or whatever else, you mi\n     realize that you have missed the last election and have been removed from the\n     registration list until it is too late.\" 139 Cong. Rec. H517 (daily ed. Feb.\n     1993) (remarks of Rep. Collins). Once registered, would-be voters might also\n     reasonably believe that the City would not nullify their efforts. Indeed, as\n     authors of the only commentary on purge laws point out, \"Purging qualified vo\n     who have fulfilled registration requirements will likely increase their frust\n     and humiliation over continued obstacles to the franchise. Furthermore, it i\n     likely to deter voting by increasing alienation and apathy toward the politic\n     process and by intimidating qualified voters and creating a fear of encounter\n     election officials in the reinstatement process or at the polling place.\" Ba\n     supra p. 34, at 523.\n\n     For the majority, the fact that purged voters have registered before means th\n     statute could not have violated § 2. In my view, that fact only further\n     demonstrates and contributes to the statute's discriminatory effect.\n\n\n                                            48\n\fvarious groups, including racial minorities.\" 42 U.S.C.S. § 1973gg(a)(3).     In light\n\nthat finding, and with the stated objectives of promoting the exercise of the funda\n\nright to vote, protecting the integrity of the electoral process, and ensuring that\n\naccurate and current voter registration rolls are maintained, Congress enacted a la\n\ndesigned to increase registration rates by eliminating, to a significant extent, th\n\nfor citizens to make independent efforts to register to vote.   See 42 U.S.C.S. § 19\n\n(providing for simultaneous driver's license and registration application).    By\n\ndrastically reducing the need for people to complete and submit separate registrati\n\napplications, Congress hoped to \"expand[] the rolls of the eligible citizens who ar\n\nregistered\" and thus \"give the greatest number of people the opportunity to partici\n\nin federal elections.   H. Rep. No. 103-9, 103d Cong., 1st. Sess. 3 (1993), reprinte\n\n1993 U.S.C.C.A.N. 105, 107.   During the debates, supporters of the bill repeatedly\n\nexpressed the view that practical and procedural obstacles, and not a lack of desir\n\nparticipate, were primarily responsible for the unfortunate fact that roughly 70 mi\n\neligible voters in this country (about 40 percent of the voting-age population) had\nto register.   E.g., 139 Cong. Rec. H488 (daily ed. Feb. 4, 1993) (remarks of Rep. M\n\n(\"[T]here are 70 million eligible voters who are not registered because of the burd\n\nregistration policies and procedures which we have in this country.\"); id. at S2470\n\ned. Mar. 5, 1993) (remarks of Sen. Bradley) (stating that 40 percent of the voting-\n\npopulation cannot vote \"because obstacles are placed in the path of them registerin\n\nvote.\")   No legislator ever questioned the fact that the bill would substantially i\n\nregistration rates.   139 Cong. Rec. H517 (daily ed. Feb. 4, 1993) (remarks of Rep.\n(opposing the bill, but acknowledging that it would increase registration).

E.g., President's Remarks on Signing the National Vo\n\nRegistration Act of 1993, 29 Weekly Comp. Pres. Doc. 914, 915 (May 20, 1993) (\"The\n\nof Washington instituted a similar measure during the 1992 election, and their moto\n\nprogram registered in that state alone an additional 186,000 people.\"); 139 Cong. R\n\nH495 (daily ed. Feb. 4, 1993) (remarks of Rep. Tucker) (noting experience of states\n\nat S2390 (daily ed. Mar. 4, 1993) (remarks of Sen. Ford) (same).\n\n          Once again, in assessing the effect and legality of a challenged voting l\n\nare supposed to maintain a practical and realistic perspective.     We are supposed to\n\nformalistic views of what it means and what it takes to participate in political\n\nprocesses.    The district court and majority opinions suggest that registering and r\n\nregistering to vote is an easy thing to do.    The way they see it, anyone who wants\n\nregister certainly can.    If that were true, if the task of filling out and submitti\n\napplication to register did not represent a substantial obstacle to political\n\nparticipation, the National Voter Registration Act would not exist.    As Representat\nLewis put it: \"[F]or many Americans, it is not easy to register to vote.    It is\n\ndifficult.\"    139 Cong. Rec. H488 (daily ed. Feb. 4, 1993).   For that reason, Congre\n\n\"an effort to make democracy a little more real for all citizens of the United Stat\n\nId. at H490 (remarks of Rep. McKinney).\n\n          Courts applying § 2 of the Voting Rights Act must take a similar approach\n\nUnless we ignore Congress's instructions, divorce ourselves from past and present r\n\nand adhere to a narrow and formalistic view of political opportunity, we will under\nthat the discriminatory effects of Pennsylvania's non-voting purge law are not cure\n\n\n\n                                              50\n\fall alleviated by the fact that Latinos and blacks are free to reinstate themselves\n\nregister after being purged from the registration rolls.\n\n                                                  IV.\n\n          In Part III.C of its opinion, the majority devotes special attention to t\n\ndistrict court's findings regarding the success that black and Latino candidates ha\n\nin Philadelphia elections.   It reads the district court's opinion to make \"an expli\n\nfinding of fact that Philadelphia's minority population has not had difficulty elec\n\nminority representatives.\"   Maj. Op. Typescript at 22.   That finding, the majority\n\nto argue, precludes the plaintiffs from prevailing on their § 2 claim.   The majorit\n\ncommitted two significant errors here.   First, the district court did not make the\n\nthe majority describes. Second, even if such a finding had been made, the majority\n\nmisinterpreted its legal significance.\n\n                                             A.\n\n1.   What the District Court Did and Did Not (and Could Not) Find\n\n          Again, according to the majority, the district court \"made an explicit fi\nthat Philadelphia's minority population has not had difficulty electing minority\n\nrepresentatives.\"   Id. (citing Ortiz, 824 F. Supp. at 539).   I disagree.   The secti\n\nthe district court opinion to which the majority refers is headed: \"The Extent to W\n\nAfrican-Americans and Latinos Have Been Elected to Public Office in Philadelphia.\"\n\n824 F. Supp. at 537.   The court's headings faithfully track the typically relevant\n\nlisted in the Senate Report, which include \"the extent to which members of the mino\n\ngroup have been elected to office in the jurisdiction.\"    Sen. Rep. at 29. According\ndistrict court considered, and ultimately rejected, the plaintiffs' contention that\n\n\n\n                                             51\n\f\"minority candidates have experienced considerable difficulty being elected to publ\n\noffice in Philadelphia.\"      Ortiz, 824 F. Supp. at 537.   In supporting this conclusio\n\ncourt specifically mentioned minority representation in the state legislature and o\n\nCity Council.   Id. at 538.    Thus, the district court's discussion, as its heading\n\nindicated, described the extent to which blacks and Latinos had been elected to off\n\nPhiladelphia.\n\n          Somewhere in this section of the district court's opinion, the majority f\n\n\"an explicit finding of fact that the City's minority population has not had diffic\n\nelecting minority representatives.\"      The district court, however, never made any fi\n\nregarding -- and in fact, never mentioned -- the difficulty minority voters might h\n\nexperienced in their efforts to elect candidates; instead, in keeping with the Sena\n\nReport's instructions, it considered the extent to which black and Latino candidate\n\nwon election to public office.      There is a substantial legal and factual difference\n\nbetween the difficulty experienced by minority candidates, which the district court\n\nconsidered, and the difficulty experienced by minority voters, which the district c\nneither considered nor addressed in a factual finding.0\n0\n      The majority's misreading of the district court's opinion is probably a resul\n      the following sentence: \"The Court concludes that plaintiffs have failed to\n      demonstrate that minority candidates experience difficulty electing represent\n      to office.\" Ortiz, 824 F. Supp. at 538 (emphasis added). Clearly, that stat\n      contains a mistake. The district court was not referring to a situation, suc\n      that following a plurality vote in the electoral college, in which (successfu\n      candidates for office are called upon to elect other representatives. There a\n      possible ways to make sense of the district court's misstatement: either the\n      meant to say \"voters\" instead of \"candidates\", or it meant to say \"getting el\n      to office\" instead of \"electing representatives to office.\" The first possib\n      while perhaps the one the majority would prefer, is not realistic. The distr\n      court's heading, its description and rejection of the plaintiffs' argument, i\n      reliance on the Senate Report, and the content of its discussion -- in which\n\n\n                                                52\n\f          If this were a vote dilution case, the plaintiffs would have had to satis\n\nGingles threshold factors, the third of which requires proof \"that the white majori\n\nvotes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it -- in the absence of special circumstance\n\n-- usually to defeat the minority's preferred candidate.\" Gingles, 478 U.S. at 51.\n\ncourse, this is not a vote dilution case, and I have already explained why the fact\n\nthat are most relevant in that context are of little if any relevance here. Supra p\n\n36.   Assuming, however, that the plaintiffs did need to make a showing regarding th\n\ndifficulty they have experienced in electing their preferred representatives -- and\n\ndiscuss below, I believe the majority has erred in apparently concluding that they\n\nneed to do so -- they could not rely, and a district court could not base a finding\n\nentirely on the win-loss records of minority candidates.   We have not lost sight of\n\nencouraging fact that Latino and black constituents can and sometimes do prefer whi\n\ncandidates, even in elections where a minority candidate is also running.0   So, as w\n\nexplained in Jenkins, \"[w]hile it may be tempting to assume that a minority candida\n\nalways the candidate of choice among minority voters, this is not always true.\"   Je\n4 F.3d at 1126; see generally id. at 1124-1131 (setting forth and applying the prop\n\nstandards for determining which candidates are preferred by § 2 plaintiffs).   The s\n\n\n\n      referred only to candidates who had been elected, and never to voter preferen\n      all point to the unmistakable conclusion that the court made a finding regard\n      difficulty minority candidates had experienced in their efforts to get electe\n      not the difficulty minority voters had experienced in their efforts to elect\n      candidates they supported.\n0\n      Conversely, and of at least equal promise, whites can and do vote for minorit\n      candidates. The record even reveals that such laudable events may occur, as\n      might hope, in the City of Brotherly Love; as the district court pointed out,\n      minority members of the Philadelphia City Council were elected in at-large co\n\n\n                                             53\n\fof black and Latino candidates, therefore, does not necessarily prove the success o\n\nand Latino voters.0\n\n          Contrary to the majority's assertion, the district court did not find tha\n\nminority voters had not experienced difficulty electing minority candidates; it mer\n\nconcluded that, at least as far as the plaintiffs could prove, minority candidates\n\nexperienced difficulty getting elected.0    We do not know which of those candidates w\n\nactually preferred by minority voters.     And even if the district court had found, a\n\nmajority claims, that minority voters experienced no difficulty electing candidates\n\n0\n      Section 2 plaintiffs bear the burden of establishing which candidates they ha\n      preferred. Jenkins, 4 F.3d at 1126. Minority voters are not entitled to an\n      unsupported assumption that the defeat of minority candidates, in and of itse\n      demonstrates the frustration of minority voting interests. In this case, bec\n      the district court never considered whether black and Latino citizens had suc\n      in electing representatives of their choice, we do not have any of the factua\n      information a court would need to determine which candidates were preferred b\n      minority constituents. For example, we do not know anything about the losing\n      candidates in elections where a black or Latino prevailed, nor do we have any\n      if statistical or even anecdotal evidence supports the permissible inference\n      minority voters in fact preferred any given minority representative. Again,\n      cases (unlike this one) where such a showing is necessary, the plaintiffs mus\n      it. Here, however, it is the majority that equates the success of minority\n      candidates with the success of minority voters. That assumption is not legall\n      factually sound.\n\n      I am aware of the district court's finding that, as a general matter, voting\n      Philadelphia is racially polarized. Ortiz, 824 F. Supp. at 532-33. That fin\n      however, is insufficient to support a conclusion that minority voters preferr\n      particular minority candidates. As we pointed out in Jenkins, this inquiry mu\n      conducted \"on an election-by-election basis.\" Jenkins, 4 F.3d at 1126.\n0\n      Putting aside the majority's misunderstanding of whose experience (candidates\n      voters') the district court was considering, it is worth noting that the cour\n      concluded that the plaintiffs had failed to prove that someone had experience\n      sort of political hardship. It did not, as the majority states, make an affir\n      finding that no one had done so. This second inaccuracy in the majority's ve\n      of the district court's finding may be more subtle, but it is not insignifica\n\n\n                                               54\n\ffinding could only have been based on the unsupported and legally erroneous assumpt\n\nthat blacks and Latinos always vote for blacks and Latinos.     Thus, such a finding c\n\nnot survive review.\n\n2.   The Unanswered Need to Consider Special Circumstances\n\n          Assuming that the plaintiffs' case did depend on an independent showing t\n\nthey have not been able to elect their preferred representatives (which it does not\n\nfurther assuming that minority voters always prefer minority candidates (which they\n\nnot), the district court's findings still would not defeat the plaintiffs' § 2 clai\n\nbecause the court never considered the kinds of \"special circumstances\" that might\n\nundermine the legal significance of the minority representation it cited.     Gingles\n\nmandates that in determining whether § 2 plaintiffs have usually been prevented fro\n\nelecting their preferred candidates, courts take into account \"special circumstance\n\nas the absence of an opponent, incumbency, or the utilization of bullet voting,\" wh\n\ncould explain the success of minority candidates even in the face of a districting\n\nthat unlawfully diluted the plaintiffs' vote.     Gingles, 478 U.S. at 57; see also Je\n4 F.3d at 1119 n.9 (\"consideration of special circumstances is specifically mandate\n\nwithin the definition of the third Gingles factor\").    As the Gingles Court took car\n\nmake clear, its \"list of special circumstances is illustrative, not exclusive.\"     Gi\n\n478 U.S. at 57 n.26.\n\n          The uncontroverted evidence presented at trial showed that of the seven b\n\nLatino representatives serving on the Philadelphia City Council, five were elected\n\n\"minority districts.\"   Ortiz, 824 F. Supp. at 537; id. at 538 (acknowledging that \"\nthe [minority] councilmembers represent wards that are highly populated by minority\n\n\n\n                                             55\n\fconstituents.\")    The record does not reflect whether minority state legislators hav\n\nbeen elected largely from districts in which black or Latino citizens constituted a\n\nmajority. Nor does it disclose whether other special circumstances, such as incumbe\n\nthe nature (or lack) of a candidate's opposition, might account for the success of\n\nminority candidates in some instances.\n\n          It seems obvious that the existence and effect of minority districts is t\n\nof special circumstance that courts must take into account in determining whether m\n\nvoters have experienced difficulty electing their candidates of choice.     Of course,\n\nvote dilution context, this consideration will never arise.   Vote dilution claims\n\ninvariably challenge districting schemes that do not provide minority voters with a\n\neffective voting majority.   A court could never learn anything about the occurrence\n\ndilution by looking to the results of elections in districts where majority-minorit\n\nconstituencies controlled the outcome.   Outside the vote dilution context, however,\n\ndemographic composition of a district must be taken into account in assessing the e\n\nof a challenged voting practice.   If a discriminatory law results in the\n\ndisenfranchisement of a disproportionate number of minority voters, but the remaini\nvoting members of the group still constitute an effective majority within a distric\n\nplainly, the success of a minority candidate elected from that district would have\n\nlegal significance.   That result would not provide any indication whatsoever that t\n\nchallenged law had not impaired the ability of minority voters to elect their chose\n\nrepresentatives.   Thus, the existence of majority-minority districts is the type of\n\nspecial circumstance that can explain, and thereby lessen or eliminate the signific\nof, the political success enjoyed by minority-preferred candidates.\n\n\n\n                                              56\n\f          Here, the district court never considered the existence or effect of spec\n\ncircumstances such as majority-minority districts.   The evidence presented at trial\n\nthe court described and at least partially credited in its opinion, would have supp\n\nfinding that these circumstances did exist.   In all likelihood, the district court\n\nhad any reason to conduct this sort of inquiry, because it was only considering the\n\nto which minority candidates had been elected to office; it was not making a findin\n\nregarding the difficulty minority voters had experienced in trying to elect\n\nrepresentatives, which is entirely consistent with its conclusion that the Gingles\n\npreconditions were \"peripheral issues bearing little relevance\" in this case.    Orti\n\nF. Supp. at 523.   However, if the district court had wanted to move from its findin\n\nminority representation on local and state governing bodies, to a conclusion that l\n\nsignificant minority political success disproved the plaintiffs' claim that their a\n\nto influence the outcome of elections had been impaired, it would have needed to co\n\nthe presence of special circumstances.   A failure to do so would constitute reversi\n\nlegal error.    Harvell v. Ladd, 958 F.2d 226, 230 (8th Cir. 1992) (reversing for fai\nconsider special circumstances).   While the district court did not commit such erro\n\nbecause of the limited nature of its findings, the majority does.    It briefly descr\n\nthe electoral successes of black and Latino candidates, and concludes that those fa\n\nrefute the suggestion that the plaintiffs either have been denied fair access to th\n\npolitical process or have suffered an impairment of their ability to influence the\n\nof elections.   The majority fails to acknowledge the possibility that special\n\ncircumstances could have accounted for the results on which it relies, despite the\nuncontroverted evidence that such circumstances did, in fact, exist.    Of course, ap\n\n\n\n                                              57\n\fcourts are not competent to resolve this type of question on their own, but that is\n\nprecisely what the majority would have to do in order to avoid its apparent error.0\n\n                                             B.\n\n          Even if I accepted the majority's account of what the district court foun\n\nwould not agree with its apparent view of that finding's significance.\n\n          I confess that I am not entirely sure I understand the legal argument tha\n\nmajority advances in Part III.C of its opinion.   It at least strongly intimates, ho\n\nthat the plaintiffs' failure to prove that they have experienced difficulty electin\n\nrepresentatives, in and of itself, would preclude them from prevailing on a § 2 cla\n\nthus would provide an alternative ground for affirming the district court's decisio\n\nthat is the majority's position, and if the majority is right, then any voting prac\n\nthat prevented members of protected classes from participating in the political pro\n\nin whatever manner, to whatever extent, and for whatever reason -- would be permiss\n\nunder § 2, provided those groups could still eke out a reasonably fair share of ele\n\nvictories.   Thankfully, the Voting Rights Act allows no such thing.\n\n\n0\n      As a final point, by relying on Wilson Goode's mayoral victories in support o\n      position that minority voters have not had difficulty electing minority candi\n      the majority has adjusted or reinterpreted the district court's findings. Go\n      testified that he was the only black candidate, of the twelve who ran, to be\n      mayor during the past thirty years. Thus, when the district court found subs\n      minority representation in Philadelphia, it was in spite of Goode's success,\n      because of it. Ortiz, 824 F. Supp. at 538 (\"Although there has been one mino\n      mayor over the past several years, the city council . . . .\" (emphasis added)\n      majority's use of these findings is quite different. Instead of viewing Goode\n      mayoral victories, in their historical context, as facts that detract from bu\n      not defeat an argument that minority candidates have achieved substantial suc\n      Philadelphia elections, the majority cites Goode's victories as only supporti\n      position.\n\n\n                                             58\n\f          The majority's legal argument, one of the two sources of Part III.C's tro\n\nitself contains two errors.   First, and most importantly, the majority has misread\n\nSupreme Court's decision in Chisom v. Roemer, 115 L.Ed.2d 348 (1991).     Second, it h\n\nagain misconstrued § 2.\n\n          According to the majority, Chisom holds that \"Section 2 plaintiffs must\n\ndemonstrate that they had less opportunity both (1) to participate in the political\n\nprocess, and to elect representatives of their choice.\"     Maj. Op. Typescript at 21\n\n(emphasis added); see also Maj. Op. Typescript at 23 (referring to \"both elements o\n\nSection 2 claim\").   Its discussion in Part III.C seems to focus on the second of th\n\nrequirements; by pointing to the electoral successes enjoyed by Latino and black\n\ncandidates, the majority suggests that the plaintiffs failed to prove that their ab\n\nto influence the outcome of elections --or, in other words, their ability to elect\n\nrepresentatives of their choice -- has been impaired.     Maj. Op. Typescript at 22.0\n\nof this purported failure, the majority concludes, the plaintiffs have \"failed to s\n\nboth elements of a § 2 cause of action and, accordingly, [have] failed to establish\nbasis upon which [their] requested relief could be granted.\"     Maj. Op. Typescript a\n\n\n\n0\n     Part III.C does contain a brief reference to a district court \"finding of min\n     participation in the political process.\" Maj. Op. Typescript at 22 (citing Or\n     824 F. Supp. at 539). However, the \"finding\" the majority has in mind could\n     the district court's statement of its ultimate conclusion, where it simply ec\n     the language of § 2 in holding that no violation occurred. That \"finding\" (w\n     appears under the heading \"CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\") cannot support itself. In an\n     event, once again, the majority's argument only relies on the findings regard\n     electoral results. It is the success of minority candidates, it reasons, tha\n     demonstrates that minority voters have not been denied either fair access to\n     political process or an equal opportunity to influence the outcome of electio\n\n\n                                             59\n\f          In the part of Chisom on which the majority relies, the Supreme Court add\n\nthe position \"that § 2 provides two distinct types of protection for minority voter\n\nprotects their opportunity `to participate in the political process' and their oppo\n\nto elect representatives of their choice.'\" Chisom, 115 L.Ed.2d at 364.   The majori\n\nthe Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, sitting en banc, had adopted that view in Leagu\n\nUnited Latin American Citizens Council No. 4434 v. Clements, 914 F.2d 620 (5th Cir.\n\n(en banc) (\"LULAC\"), rev'd sub nom. Houston Lawyers' Ass'n v. Attorney General of T\n\n115 L.Ed.2d 379 (1991) (companion case to Chisom).   The LULAC majority determined t\n\nword \"representatives,\" as used in the phrase \"to elect representatives of their ch\n\ndid not include judges.   Consequently, it held that § 2 plaintiffs could not challe\n\ndistricting scheme that allegedly prevented them from electing the judicial candida\n\nthey preferred.   However, because the word \"representatives\" did not limit the firs\n\nthe two distinct protections that, according to the LULAC majority, § 2 provided --\n\nnamely, the opportunity to participate in the political process -- a voting practic\n\nprocedure that compromised minority voters' opportunities to participate in judicia\nelections remained subject to challenge.   Chisom describes the Fifth Circuit's rati\n\nas follows:\n          [A] standard, practice, or procedure in a judicial election, such as a\n          limit on the times that polls are open, which has a disparate impact\n          on black voters' opportunity to cast their ballots under § 2, may be\n          challenged even if a different practice that merely affects their\n          opportunity to elect representatives of their choice to judicial\n          office may not.\n\nChisom, 115 L.Ed.2d at 364.   The construction of § 2 the majority appears to adopt\n\nIII.C is similar but more demanding. Like the LULAC court, it divides § 2; the oppo\nto participate, in its view, is distinct from the opportunity to elect.   Unlike the\n\n\n                                             60\n\fcourt, however, the majority reads § 2 to contain two \"elements,\" each of which a\n\nplaintiff must satisfy in order to prevail, rather than two alternative \"protection\n\nthus, while the Fifth Circuit required plaintiffs to prove only one of two differen\n\nabridgements of political opportunity, the majority here requires proof of both.\n\n           The Supreme Court rejected both majority positions --the one advanced in\n\nand the one advanced here.   According to Chisom, the Fifth Circuit had erroneously\n\nattempted \"to divide a unitary claim created by Congress.\"   Chisom, 115 L.Ed.2d at\n\nThe majority of this panel has done precisely the same thing.   However, as the Chis\n\nCourt put it, § 2 cannot be compelled to undergo the \"radical surgery [that] would\n\nrequired to separate the opportunity to participate from the opportunity to elect.\"\n\n364.   \"The statute does not,\" the Court explained, \"create two separate and distinc\n\nrights.\"   Id. Rather: \"Any abridgement of the opportunity of members of a protected\n\nto participate in the political process inevitably impairs their ability to influen\n\noutcome of an election.\"   Id. (emphasis added).   As the Court had stated in White v\n\nRegister and Whitcomb v. Chavis, Chisom continues, \"the opportunity to participate\nopportunity to elect [are] inextricably linked.\"   Id. at 365 (emphasis added) (citi\n\nWhite, 412 U.S. at 766, and Whitcomb, 403 U.S. 124, 149 (1971)).\n\n           Thus, in Chisom, the Court clearly and repeatedly rejected the majority's\n\napparent view that § 2 plaintiffs must satisfy each of two distinct elements (lesse\n\nopportunity both to participate and to elect) in order to prevail.   Instead, if suc\n\nplaintiffs can prove that a voting law has abridged their opportunity to participat\n\nthe political process -- by, for example, removing them from the registration rolls\nthus effectively nullifying their franchise -- that law has also necessarily and\n\n\n\n                                             61\n\f\"inevitably\" impaired the plaintiffs' ability to influence the outcome of an electi\n\nSuch is the nature of the \"unitary claim\" Congress created.   Under this sensible an\n\nsupported construction of § 2, a voting practice is impermissible if it operates to\n\nthe members of a protected class of an equal opportunity to participate in the poli\n\nprocess -- even if the group has managed to overcome that disadvantage and to elect\n\nrepresentatives of its choice.0\n\n          The majority does not agree.   Again, looking exclusively to electoral res\n\nit concludes that the plaintiffs cannot prevail, because there is no evidence that\n\npurge law has denied them fair access to the political process or impaired their ab\n\nto influence the outcome of elections. Maj. Op. Typescript at 22.   This position co\n\nbased on one of several rationales, none of which are availing.   Perhaps the majori\n\ndisagrees with, or has overlooked, Chisom's use of words like \"inevitably\" and\n\n\"inextricably linked\", which describe the relationship between the abridgement of a\n\ngroup's opportunity to participate in the political process, on the one hand, and t\n\nimpairment of that group's ability to elect representatives, on the other.   Chisom,\nL.Ed.2d at 364.   The majority would apparently require the plaintiffs to produce ev\n\nof a connection that, at least according to Chisom, necessarily exists as a matter\n0\n      This is not the way Justice Scalia read the Court's opinion. In fact, Justic\n      Scalia criticized the Chisom majority for construing § 2 in such a way that m\n      of a minority group that was not large enough to control the outcome of elect\n      but who nonetheless had suffered an abridgement of their opportunity to parti\n      in the political process, would not be protected. Chisom, 115 L.Ed.2d at 372\n      (Scalia, J. dissenting). The Chisom majority, however, expressly rejected th\n      interpretation of its opinion. Id. at 365 n.24. Thus, regardless of whether\n      Justice Scalia's criticism had merit, not one member of the Court was willing\n      adopt a construction of § 2 under which a measure that operated to abridge a\n      opportunity to participate, but that did not itself prevent that group from e\n      representatives, would be permissible.\n\n\n                                             62\n\fand logic.   Alternatively, the majority might believe that by purging people from t\n\nregistration rolls, the City has not in any way lessened their opportunity to parti\n\nin the political process.   But I would hope we could agree about this much: when\n\nindividuals are purged, they cannot vote; if they cannot vote, their opportunity to\n\nparticipate is diminished; and, once again, according to the Supreme Court, if thei\n\nopportunity to participate is diminished, their ability to elect their preferred\n\nrepresentatives is necessarily, \"inevitably\" impaired. A final possibility remains.\n\nmajority might simply be restating, in a somewhat oblique way, its view that in ord\n\nestablish a violation of § 2, the plaintiffs would have had to establish that the p\n\nlaw itself operates to prevent Latinos and blacks from voting and that, therefore,\n\nis entirely responsible for its discriminatory effect.   If that is the majority's p\n\nhowever, then the argument advanced in Part III.C would not provide any additional\n\nfor its conclusion, and thus would not require a response.\n\n          In arguing that the plaintiffs' failure to prove difficulty electing\n\nrepresentatives defeats their claim, the majority not only misreads Chisom; it also\nagain, misreads § 2.   The district court, in contrast, recognized that the success\n\nand Latino candidates have had in winning public office is merely one factor among\n\nthat are relevant in a § 2 inquiry.   As § 2(b) quite plainly states: \"The extent to\n\nmembers of a protected class have been elected to office in the State or political\n\nsubdivision is one circumstance which may be considered.\"    42 U.S.C. § 1973(b) (emp\n\nadded).0 According to the majority's apparent view, however, that circumstance is so\n\n0\n      As I state above, supra p. 36, the extent to which minority voters have exper\n      difficulty electing candidates of their choice -- and thus relatedly, the ext\n      which minority candidates have won election to office -- is one relevant fact\n\n\n                                             63\n\fdispositive.   Maj. Op. Typescript at 22-23.   Congress disagrees.   Sen. Rep. at 29 n\n\n(rejecting the notion that a failure \"to establish any particular factor\" defeats a\n\nclaim).   The Supreme Court disagrees.   See Gingles, 478 U.S. at 45 (recognizing tha\n\nparticular number of factors need be proved, but that § 2 analysis instead depends\n\nsearching practical evaluation of past and present reality and on a functional view\n\npolitical process).   I disagree as well.\n\n                                               V.\n\n          Congress, in its continued efforts to ensure that the democratic processe\n\noccurring in this country will be equally open to members of racial and language\n\nminorities, has had the good sense to prohibit non-voting purges in federal electio\n\nlegislation it recently enacted to eliminate \"discriminatory and unfair registratio\n\ndoes not overlook laws such as the one the plaintiffs have challenged in this case.\n\nwhen the National Voter Registration Act becomes effective, Pennsylvania will no lo\n\nable to remove individuals from the registration rolls because of their failure to\n\nSee 42 U.S.C.S. § 1973gg-6(b)(2).0   As I stated at the outset, however, I am concern\n\n       among others, that a court can take into account in assessing the effect and\n       legality of a non-voting purge law. Political success could well encourage\n       participation, while repeated failure could lead to disillusionment, alienati\n       the belief that voting is pointless. Therefore, because this factor might in\n       minority participation rates, it is a relevant consideration in a challenge t\n       that disenfranchises those who fail to vote. The extent of a group's politic\n       success, however, while relevant, is not of central importance among the\n       circumstances that affect its members' inclination or ability to participate,\n       certainly not anything approaching a threshold or essential factor that § 2\n       plaintiffs must establish in order to successfully challenge a non-voting pur\n0\n  The statute provides:\n\n          Any State program or activity to protect the integrity of the\n          electoral process by ensuring the maintenance of an accurate and\n          current voter registration roll for elections for Federal office . . .\n\n                                               64\n\fthat today's decision will reach beyond its context and misdirect future efforts to\n\nproperly apply the Voting Rights Act.\n\n           The majority makes a valid and important observation: the law, in various\n\nhas indeed \"sought to raze any enduring bastions of state-administered voting\n\ndiscrimination.\"   Maj. Op. Typescript at 18-19.    We cannot discount the achievement\n\nseparates Philadelphia, Mississippi in 1964 from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1994\n\nHowever, the goal the majority describes, and in which it undoubtedly believes, has\n\nbeen attained. Even after Congress's most recent contribution to the cause of equal\n\npolitical opportunity, discrimination in voting remains.    A proper application of t\n\nVoting Rights Act in this case would have resulted in precisely the kind of additio\n\nprogress the Act was intended to bring about.\n\n           According to the majority, the right to vote, \"the very essence of democr\n\nsociety,\" has now been \"extended to every American citizen, without regard to race\n\n.\"   Maj. Op. Typescript at 18.   That accomplishment loses meaning, however, when\n\ndiscriminatory voting laws make the right to vote harder for some to exercise than\nWhen such discrimination occurs, I fear that today's decision will make it more dif\n\nfor us to respond in the way the law requires.

Theoretically, states and localities could creativ\n      struggle to avoid this mandate by maintaining separate registration rolls for\n      elections.

A list of the\n          persons to whom such notices shall have been mailed\n          shall be sent promptly to the city chairman of the\n          political party of which the electors were registered\n          as members. At the expiration of the time specified\n          in the notice, the commission shall cause the\n          registration of such elector to be cancelled unless he\n          has filed with the commission a signed request for\n          reinstatement of his registration as above provided.\n          The official registration application card of an\n          elector who has registered may qualify as a\n          reinstatement of his registration or a removal notice.\n          The cancellation of the registration of any such\n          elector for failure to vote during two immediately\n          preceding calendar years shall not affect the right of\n          any such elector to subsequently register in the\n          manner provided by this act.\n\n               Whenever the registration of an elector has been\n          cancelled through error, such elector may petition the\n          commission for reinstatement of his registration not\n          later than the tenth day preceding any primary or\n          election, and after a hearing on said application, if\n          error on the part of the commission is proved, the\n          commission shall reinstate the registration of such\n          elector.\n\n                                 3\n\fto be purged from Philadelphia's registration rolls for failing\n\nto vote.\n\n           On October 25, 1991, Ortiz filed an action alleging\n\nthat the non-voting purge act had a disparate impact on minority\n\nvoters and, thus, violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of\n\n1965, 42 U.S.C. § 1973, the First and Fourteenth Amendments of\n\nthe United States Constitution, and the Pennsylvania Election\n\nLaw, 25 Pa. Cons. Stat. 623-40.       Ortiz sought a judicial\n\ndeclaration that the purge violated the aforementioned\n\nprovisions, as well as an injunction directing the City to\n\nrestore all purged voters to the City's voter registration rolls,\n\nand enjoining the City from any further purging of non-voting,\n\nregistered voters.\n\n           On October 29, 1991, the district court denied Ortiz's\n\nmotion for a preliminary injunction.      No appeal was taken.     One\n\nmonth prior to the November 1992 elections, Ortiz again sought a\n\ntemporary restraining order or preliminary injunction and an\n\nimmediate hearing on the merits.      This request was denied by\n\norder of the district court on October 6, 1992.

The district\n\ncourt, applying the \"totality of the circumstances\" test set\n\nforth in § 2(b) of the Voting Rights Act, held that the\n\nredistricting plan violated the Act because it resulted in the\n\ndilution of black citizens' votes in all of the disputed election\n\ndistricts.\n\n             The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the\n\ndistrict court with respect to all of the disputed districts\n\nexcept one.    In so ruling, the Court held that to determine\n\n\"whether 'as a result of the challenged practice or structure\n\nplaintiffs do not have an equal opportunity to participate in the\n\npolitical processes and to elect candidates of their choice,'\" a\n\ncourt must \"assess the impact of the contested structure or\n\npractice on minority electoral opportunities 'on the basis of\n\nobjective factors.'\"    Thornburg, 478 U.S. at 44.\n\n             The Senate Judiciary Committee Report that accompanied\n\nthe bill amending Section 2 enumerated a non-exclusive list of\n\nfactors relevant to a Section 2 claim: the history of official\n\nvoting-related discrimination in the State or political sub-\n\n\n\n                                  8\n\fdivision; the extent to which voting in the elections of the\n\nState or political subdivision is racially polarized; the extent\n\nto which the State or political subdivision has used electoral\n\npractices that tend to enhance the opportunity for discrimina-\n\ntion; whether minorities have been excluded from any candidate\n\nslating process; the extent to which minority groups bear the\n\neffects of discrimination in such areas as education, employment\n\nand health, which hinder their ability to participate effectively\n\nin the political process; the extent to which political campaigns\n\nhave been characterized by overt or subtle racial appeals; the\n\nextent to which minority members have been elected to public\n\noffice; whether there is a significant lack of responsiveness on\n\nthe part of elected officials to the particularized needs of\n\nminority groups; whether the policy underlying the use of such\n\nvoting qualification, prerequisite to voting, or standard,\n\npractice or procedure is tenuous.

Gingles the Supreme Court\n\nproceeded to weigh these factors, the Court also recognized that\n\nthe Senate Judiciary Committee list was, in fact, \"neither\n\ncomprehensive nor exclusive,\" 478 U.S. at 45 (1986), and that\n\n\"there is no requirement that any particular number of factors be\n\nproved, or that a majority of them point one way or another.\"\n\nId., quoting S.

That is, both the Court and the\n\nCommittee recognized that other factors might be relevant to the\n\n\n\n\n                                 9\n\fdetermination of whether, under the totality of the circum-\n\nstances, a given electoral procedure was discriminatory.\n\n          On this much, the parties agree.   Ortiz argues,\n\ndespite the allegations in his complaint, that the district court\n\ncompletely negated the totality of the circumstances test set out\n\nby Section 2 in holding that if the purge statute was not \"the\n\ndispositive force depriving minorities of equal access to the\n\npolitical process\" then, under the \"totality of the circum-\n\nstances,\" there was no violation of the Voting Rights Act.0\n\n          The City argues that the district court did not err in\n\nrequiring Ortiz to show that the purge statute caused minority\n\nvoters to have less opportunity than other members of the\n\nelectorate to participate in the political process and to elect\n\nrepresentatives of their choice.\n\n\n\n                               C.\n\n          The primary legal issue before us, then, is whether\n\nthe district court erred by factoring into its \"totality of the\n\ncircumstances\" analysis the question of whether or not the purge\n\nstatute caused minorities to be deprived of equal access to the\n\npolitical system.\n\n\n\n\n0\n          As we read the district court's opinion, we construe\nit to mean that where, as here, a Section 2 plaintiff seeks to\nabolish or invalidate a particular election practice, such as a\npurge law, and pinpoints the particular practice in its\ncomplaint, the plaintiff necessarily must demonstrate and\nestablish by evidence that the particular practice causes the\nalleged discrimination.\n\n                               10\n\f                                 1.\n\n            The Supreme Court wrote in Thornburg v. Gingles that\n\n\"[t]he essence of a § 2 claim is that a certain electoral law,\n\npractice, or structure interacts with social and historical\n\nconditions to cause an inequality in the opportunities enjoyed by\n\nblack and white voters to elect their preferred representatives.\"\n\n478 U.S. at 47 (1986) (emphasis added).   That is, the Supreme\n\nCourt recognized that there must be some causal connection\n\nbetween the challenged electoral practice and the alleged\n\ndiscrimination that results in a denial or abridgement of the\n\nright to vote.\n\n            Three Courts of Appeal have required Section 2\n\nplaintiffs to demonstrate a causal connection between asserted\n\nindicia of discrimination and the challenged electoral procedure\n\nat issue.

The\n\ncourt held that, under the totality of the circumstances, the\n\npresence of some of the factors enumerated in the legislative\n\nhistory of Section 2 was outweighed by other factors such as the\n\nstate's legitimate and compelling rationale for enacting the\n\nstatute at issue.   The court concluded that \"the disproportionate\n\n\n                                 11\n\fimpact suffered by black Tennesseeans does not 'result' from the\n\nstate's qualification of the right to vote on account of race or\n\ncolor and thus the Tennessee Act does not violate the Voting\n\nRights Act.\"   Id. at 1262.\n\n           In Irby v.

Id. at 1556.0   Noting that evidence introduced at\n\ntrial showed that Hispanic voter turnout was roughly seven\n\npercentage points below that of Anglo-Saxon whites, the Court of\n\nAppeals agreed that \"[o]bviously, a protected class is not\n\nentitled to § 2 relief merely because it turns out in a lower\n\npercentage than whites to vote.\"        Id.0\n\n0\n          The dissent's attempt to distinguish Salas misses the\nmark. See Dissent typescript at 28. Although the Court of\nAppeals in Salas did address the issue of whether or not a\nminority group which constitutes a majority of registered voters\nmay bring a claim under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act,\nconcluding that it could, the court proceeded to consider the\nvalidity of the plaintiffs' claim on the merits, and stressed the\nneed for the plaintiffs to establish that the challenged practice\n(i.e., the at-large system) caused the electoral dilution.\n          After delineating the court's responsibility to\nanalyze the impact of a challenged practice, and the plaintiffs'\nburden to prove that the practice denied them the opportunity to\nelect their preferred representatives, the Fifth Circuit noted\nthat \"[u]nderlying these functions of the court and the\nplaintiffs in a multimember district vote dilution case is an\ninquiry into causation--whether the given electoral practice is\nresponsible for plaintiffs' inability to elect their preferred\nrepresentatives.\" 964 F.2d at 1554 (5th Cir. 1992).\n0\n          We note that the legislative history of the 1982\namendment also supports this construction of Section 2. For\nexample, the Senate Judiciary Committee Report summarized the\namendment's effect as follows:\n\n             If as a result of the challenged practice or structure\n             plaintiffs do not have an equal opportunity to\n             participate in the political process and to elect\n             candidates of their choice, there is a violation of\n             this section.\n\nSen R. at 28 (emphasis added). We read this language to provide\nthat Congress intended that any alleged denial of equal access to\nthe political process be the \"result of the challenged practice\nor structure.\"\n          The Report also stresses that the ultimate test for\nboth permanent structural barriers to political participation, as\nwell as episodic barriers, would be the standard enunciated by\nthe Supreme Court in White v.

Ortiz also\nclaims that the district court erred in finding that minority\nvoters did not suffer a disproportionate burden of re-\nregistration, and that the disproportionate placement of older\nvoting machines in minority wards did not have a discriminatory\nimpact on minority voters.\n          None of these findings of fact were clearly erroneous.\nIn any event, they are subsumed by the district court's ultimate\nfactual determination that Ortiz had failed to establish that the\npurge statute caused minority voters to be purged at a\ndisproportionate rate.\n\n\n                                15\n\fPhiladelphia, which affect the ability of these minority groups\n\nto participate in the political process and to elect their\n\ncandidates of choice.\"   Id. at 535.0    In addition, the court\n\nfound that the needs of minority citizens have not always been\n\nadequately addressed by city officials, and that this factor, as\n\nwell as the impact of various socioeconomic factors, could\n\ninfluence minority participation in the political process.        Id.\n\nat 538.\n\n           Nevertheless, the district court found that there was\n\nno evidence of historical voting-related discrimination\n\ninfringing upon the rights of Latinos or African-Americans to\n\nvote.   Id. at 531-32.   There was no evidence of discrimination in\n\nthe candidate slating process that denied minority candidates\n\nequal access to the political process.      Id. at 533.   Nor was\n\nthere evidence that minorities experience difficulty in electing\n\nrepresentatives of their choice.      Id. at 537-38.0\n\n           Finally, the district court found that the policy\n\nreasons underlying the City's implementation of the voter purge\n\nwere substantial and were based upon a valid state interest of\n\n\n\n0\n          In particular, the district court found disparities in\nthe rates of educational attainment, home ownership, housing\ndiscrimination, health care coverage, employment, and income\namong African-Americans and Latinos in comparison to the general\npopulation of the City of Philadelphia. The court also found\nthat minority voters in Philadelphia do not exercise their right\nto vote to the same extent as white voters, which in part may be\nattributable to discrimination and the overall socioeconomic\nstatus of minorities in Philadelphia. Ortiz, 824 F. Supp. at\n533-35.\n0\n          See, infra, note 16, and accompanying text.\n\n\n                                 16\n\fensuring that elections in Philadelphia are not plagued with\n\nfraud.   Id. at 538-39.\n\n           Ultimately, the district court concluded that Ortiz\n\nhad failed to establish a per se violation of Section 2:\n          Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that the purge\n          law interacts with social and historical conditions to\n          deny minority voters equal access to the political\n          process and to elect their preferred representatives,\n          particularly since it is undisputed that the purge\n          procedure is administered fairly and that there is\n          ample opportunity for purged voters to re-register to\n          vote. Although it is clear that the operation of the\n          purge law removes African-American and Latino voters\n          from the voter registration rolls at higher rates than\n          white voters, this disproportionate impact does not\n          rise to the level of a per se violation of § 2, even\n          when considered in light of the court's findings of\n          the existence of racially polarized voting,\n          socioeconomic disparities in education, employment and\n          health, racial appeals in some elections, and the\n          failure of the City in some instances to address the\n          needs of minority citizens. While it is clear that\n          these factors may contribute to decreased minority\n          political participation rates, plaintiffs' evidence\n          simply does not justify the conclusion that the purge\n          law is the dispositive force in depriving minority\n          voters of equal access to the political process in\n          violation of § 2.\n\nOrtiz, 824 F. Supp. at 539.0\n\n\n\n                                B.\n\n           We hold that the district court did not err in\n\nconcluding that Ortiz had failed to show that Philadelphia's\n\nminority population has had less opportunity than other members\n\nof the electorate to participate in the political process and to\n\n0\n          Examining the district court's opinion as a whole, it\nis apparent that the court's use of the phrase \"the dispositive\nforce\" means a cause which, in that context, would be legally\ndispositive.\n\n                                17\n\felect representatives of their choice, as a result of\n\nPennsylvania's purge statute.\n\n            The Supreme Court has stated categorically that the\n\nright to vote is of the very essence of democratic society.

Although we are\n\nmindful of the fact that it was not until relatively late in our\n\nnation's history that this right was extended to every American\n\ncitizen, without regard to race, we note that the Fifteenth\n\nAmendment, the Voting Rights Act, and numerous judicial decisions\n\nall have sought to raze any enduring historical bastions of\n\nstate-administered voter discrimination.\n\n            Here, however, it is not the State which prevents\n\ncitizens from exercising their right to vote, from participating\n\nin the political process, and from electing representatives of\n\ntheir own choosing.      We are not confronted with an electoral\n\ndevice -- such as \"race-neutral\" literacy tests, grandfather\n\nclauses, good-character provisos, racial gerrymandering, and vote\n\ndilution -- which discriminates against minorities, which has no\n\nrational basis, and which is beyond the control of minority\n\nvoters.   Rather, we are faced with the fact that, for a variety\n\nof historical reasons, minority citizens have turned out to vote\n\nat a statistically lower rate than white voters.0\n0\n          The following statistics, upon which the district\ncourt relied, Ortiz, 824 F. Supp. at 536 (E.D. Pa. 1993), are\nilluminative:\n          Voter Registration and Voter Turnout in General Elections\n                            by Year and Ethnicity\n          Eligible Voters           Actual Voters           Percentage\n\n\n                                     18\n\f                As we read Ortiz's complaint, the entire document is\n\n drawn to allege that Pennsylvania's purge statute \"caused\" the\n\ndisparate purge rates between Philadelphia's white and minority\n\ncommunities.       Yet, there is nothing before us, not even one iota\n\nof evidence introduced at trial or present in the record, which\n\n      would establish that fact, despite the claims made by the\n\n                                       dissent.\n\n                  On the contrary, it is well established that purge\n\nstatutes are a legitimate means by which the State can attempt to\n\n prevent voter fraud.0             More importantly, registered voters are\n\n\n\n Ye    White      Black    Other     White    Black    Other    White   Blac   Other\n ar                                                                       k\n 19   529,863    370,768   56,143   369,76    249,14   27,888   69.7    67.2   48.6\n 87                                    3         1\n 19   540,397    384,712   74,897   390,96    238,75   40,424   72.5    62.1   54.2\n 88                                    5         2\n 19   515,984    369,733   77,751   233,60    112,73   10,267   45.3    30.5   20.8\n 89                                    6         0\n 19   464,350    321,417   88,653   252,22    120,34   27,079   54.3    37.4   30.5\n 90                                    1         9\n 19   408,143    267,172   120,64   155,98    155,98   53,936   67.2    58.3   44.7\n 91                          2         7         7\n\n 0\n           For example, the Fourth Circuit stated as follows in\n rejecting a constitutional challenge to Maryland's voter purge\n                            statute:\n\n                 The statute in question here is designed to curb vote\n                   fraud. It removes from the registered voter list\n                    those who have moved without notifying the voter\n                 registration board, those who have died when the city\n                  has not been notified of such deaths, and those who\n                have become disqualified as a result of conviction for\n                 infamous crime if the city did not receive notice of\n                 such convictions. Without removing the names, there\n                 exists the very real danger that impostors will claim\n                  to be someone on the list and vote in their places.\n                 And the absent voting statutes open the door for vote\n                 fraud by this means. Accordingly, keeping accurate,\n                reliable and up-to-date voter registration lists is an\n                 important state interest. . . . Even considering that\n\n                                             19\n\f purged -- without regard to race, color, creed, gender, sexual\n\norientation, political belief, or socioeconomic status -- because\n\n they do not vote, and do not take the opportunity of voting in\n\n         the next election or requesting reinstatement.0\n\n           It is true that in certain years minority voters have\n\n   turned out in proportionately lower numbers than have non-\n\n    minority voters.   But the purge statute did not cause the\n\n     statistical disparities which form the basis of Ortiz's\n\n  complaint.

The dissent, however, has overlooked the fact\n\nthat the individuals to whom the purge law applies apparently\n\nhave surmounted and overcome the societal disadvantages which it\n\nemphasizes, and have registered to vote at least once, if not\n\nmore often.0    Had they continued to do so, the purge law could\n\nnot have affected them, inasmuch as the purge law operates\n\nagainst only those who have registered to vote at least once, but\n\nthen do not vote or register again.

In that case, Mississippi's onerous\ndual registration requirement, and prohibition on off-site voter\nregistration, were the causes of black voters' registering at\nlower rates than white voters. In the present case, no part of\nthe purge statute prevents minority voters from registering to\nvote and from actually voting. In fact, as mentioned in text,\nthe statute only applies to those voters who already have\nregistered to vote.\n\n\n                                   23\n\fcould not be applied to them because, as stated, the purge law\n\naffects only those who have once registered to vote.\n\n             Once having registered to vote, such individuals could\n\nnot have been impeded by the practices which Ortiz claims have\n\ndiluted their participation in the voting process.0    This may\n\nvery well account for the fact that no reported case has ever\n\ndealt with a non-voting purge law as a racially discriminatory\n\ninstrument in violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act,\n\nand the dissent, accordingly, has been unable to cite any such\n\nauthority.    It certainly accounts for the result which the\n\ndistrict court reached in the present case, and which we reach\n\ntoday.   The societal disadvantages cited by the plaintiffs and\n\nthe dissent just are not relevant.     They are not relevant because\n\nthey could not have diluted voting by a registrant or voter who\n\nhad already registered and/or voted.    As previously stated, the\n\nrecord reveals no link between the societal conditions and\n\nfactors recited by the dissent and the electoral practice (i.e.,\n\nthe purge law) challenged by Ortiz.\n\n             In addition, the dissent argues at length that \"the\n\nCity did not prove 'the need' for Pennsylvania's non-voting purge\n\nlaw,\" (Dissent typescript at 33), and that the City properly\n\nshould have been required to do so.    The dissent derives such a\n\nrequirement from footnote 119 in the Senate Judiciary Committee's\n\nReport,0 and its own analogy to Title VII disparate impact law.0\n\n0\n          See, supra, note 14.\n0\n          Footnote 119 provides in relevant part as follows:\n\"purging of voters could produce a discriminatory result if fair\nprocedures were not followed, Toney v.

Indeed, as recently as April 13, 1994, the\n\nPhiladelphia Inquirer reported under the headline, \"City Purging\n\n2d District Voter Rolls,\" that at least twenty-two individuals\n\nwere \"purged\" because they either had died or no longer lived in\n\nthe district but had, nevertheless, cast votes in the most recent\n\nelection -- the very fraudulent acts which the purge statute was\n\ndesigned to overcome.0   Even the dissent acknowledges that\n\n0\n          That article recited in part:\n\n          · The Board of Elections has begun purging\n          the Second Senate District voting rolls of\n          people who no longer live there -- including\n          a woman whose vote was recorded after she\n          died and another whose vote was cast while\n          she lived on a Greek island.\n\n          · Election officials said the 22 names --\n          including an individual who city\n          investigators found living in New Jersey --\n          would immediately be purged from computerized\n          voting rolls and notification would be\n          delivered to the addresses on their voter\n          registration.\n\n          · Among the 22   people being purged in the\n          Sixth Division   of the 42d Ward is one\n          individual who   has been living in Las Vegas\n          for two years,   though a vote was cast in her\n\n                                 26\n\felectoral fraud has been a part of Philadelphia's landscape for\n\nover 100 years.    See Dissent typescript at 39 n.22.\n\n\n\n                                  V\n\n          In its final analysis, the dissent's rhetoric still\n\nfails to bridge the gap between the societal disadvantages which\n\nit catalogues at great length, and the purpose and effect of\n\nPhiladelphia's non-voting purge act.     Once again, we emphasize\n\nthat the sole purpose of that act is to prevent the very\n\nelectoral fraud which can diminish the voting power of all\n\ncitizens who have registered and voted, including registered and\n\nvoting members of minority groups.     Despite the dissent's attempt\n\nto attribute society's voting ills to the purge act, neither the\n\nplaintiffs nor the dissent have been able to demonstrate that the\n\npurge act has had any effect whatsoever on any rights which are\n\nprotected by Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.\n\n          The dissent repeatedly charges the purge act with\n\ndiscrimination against minorities.     See, e.g., Dissent typescript\n\nat 7, 47, 50.     Yet, not one word appears in the dissent to\n\n\n          name in the November election without her\n          knowledge, and a second individual who said\n          he did not vote in any of the five\n          Philadelphia elections in which ballots were\n          cast for him since 1988.\n\n          · Between 1988 and 1993, for example, at\n          least 60 improper ballots were cast in the\n          Sixth Division of the 42d Ward, 27 by machine\n          and 33 by absentee ballot.\n\nMark Fazlollah, City Purging 2d District Voter Rolls, Phila.\nInquirer, April 13, 1994, at A1, A7.\n\n\n                                  27\n\fsubstantiate such charges.   Of even greater importance, the\n\nentire record is devoid of evidence which could support such a\n\nconclusion.   It is not enough, in an attack on a non-voting purge\n\nlaw, simply to express distress over the very real societal\n\ndisadvantages that afflict some members of minority groups.     Such\n\nsympathy and concern, though shared by all of us, are extraneous\n\nto the legal challenge mounted by Ortiz.\n\n           The dissent's single-minded focus on societal\n\ndisadvantages might be entitled to somewhat greater weight in a\n\nsuit challenging, not Philadelphia's purge act, but, perhaps,\n\nmore generally, Philadelphia's voter registration procedures\n\nthemselves.   It is apparent to us that the dissent, while\n\ncharging the purge act with a discriminatory effect, essentially\n\nis railing against registration procedures not at issue here.\n\n           For example, if Ortiz had alleged that, because of\n\ndisadvantages in education, housing, health, income, and the\n\nlike, minority citizens could not afford to travel to\n\nregistration centers, or in some other way avail themselves of\n\nregistration opportunities, the dissent's essay might have some\n\nmeaning.   But Philadelphia's voter registration laws, as a whole,\n\nare not under attack here.   The sole statute assailed by Ortiz is\n\n§ 623-40, the non-voting purge act.   That act operates only after\n\na would-be registrant has overcome whatever societal obstacles,\n\nsuch as those detailed in the dissent, were in his path.\n\n           When, if ever, a claimant mounts an attack against\n\nPhiladelphia's voter registration provisions, then and only then\n\nwill it be the time to assess the legality of such procedures in\n\n\n                                28\n\flight of the societal disadvantages highlighted by the dissent.\n\nThis case, this appeal, and our opinion, however, are not the\n\ntime or place for such a discussion.   Until proofs can be\n\nassembled -- and we can think of none that are relevant -- to\n\nestablish that a benign and neutral non-voting purge law\n\ndiscriminates against a particular class, we decline to\n\ninvalidate such a statute.\n\n\n\n                               VI\n\n          We hold that the district court did not err in denying\n\nOrtiz's request for declaratory and permanent injunctive relief.\n\nTherefore, we will affirm the district court's June 1, 1993 order\n\ngranting judgment in favor of the City.\n\n          Costs will be taxed against the appellant, Ortiz.\n\n\n\n\n                               29\n\fOrtiz v.

Voter fra\n\nincluding the practice of voting dead or non-resident citizens, is no stranger to\n\nPennsylvania, especially to the City of Philadelphia.    In 1937, the Pennsylvania Ge\n\nAssembly made a judgment that a non-voting purge law was necessary to prevent voter\n\n25 Pa. Stat. Ann. § 623-40 (1963 & 1993 Supp.).     Thirty-five years later, a three j\n\nfederal court upheld the constitutionality of Pennsylvania's law, based on the vali\n\ninterest in protecting the integrity of the electoral process.     Williams v. Osser,\n\nF.Supp. 646 (1972).0    The court held that was a policy decision the General Assembly\n0\n    As Judge Max Rosenn stated:\n\n             The principal state interest which the statute protects is the prevention\n        of fraudulent voting. Maintaining voter rolls that include persons who no long\n        reside in a precinct, or who reside there but do not vote, conduces to fraud.\n        Pennsylvania discovered that political operatives knowledgeable of the status\n        such registrants and weaknesses in the system were able to cast votes in the\n        non-voters' names. The two-year period allows removal of the names before the\n        political operatives can take advantage of the situation. If the period were\n        four years instead of two, they would have greater opportunity to seize upon t\n        registrant's non-voting status and defeat the purpose of the purge. Such\n        considerations led the state legislature to change the purge period from four\n        two years in 1941 after considerable public concern over voting fraud. Mr.\n        Welsh testified that the change was prompted by a suit instituted in 1940 by t\n        Committee of Seventy, charging fraud by \"phantom voters.\"\n\n\n                                               1\n\fentitled to make.   In this statutory challenge, as set forth in the court's opinion\n\nplaintiffs in this case    failed to prove the Pennsylvania law violated Section 2 of\n\nVoting Rights Act of 1965, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 1971-73 (1988 & 1992 Supp.), in\n\nminority citizens \"have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to\n\nparticipate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.\"\n\nis significant is that the concerns that led to the passage of the Pennsylvania law\n\nalive; as Judge Garth has noted, fraudulent voting in Philadelphia remains egregiou\n\nflagrant today.\n\n          For some time now, Congress and the state legislatures, concerned by low\n\nrates, have commendably sought to increase voter participation.    Last year, citing\n\nsteady decline of citizen participation in federal elections (except for 1992) and\n\npenalty imposed on non-voters by removing their names from the rolls,0 Congress deci\n\npromote voter registration by passing the National Voter Registration Act, 42 U.S.C\n\n§1973gg (1994 Supp.).0    In the process, Congress sought to strike a balance between\n\n\n\n\nWilliams v.

But in spite of the contributions the majority quite properly credits\n\neradicating many of the most glaring forms of discrimination in voting, the law has\n\nensure that members of minority groups will have an equal opportunity to participat\n\nthe political process.   We cannot pretend, and I do not read the majority opinion t\n\nsuggest, that the discrimination prohibited by the Voting Rights Act has been releg\n\nan unfortunate but closed chapter of American history.   Discrimination and its effe\n\nremain a part of our present reality.

In my view, th\n\ndistrict court erred in concluding that Pennsylvania's non-voting purge statute doe\n\nviolate § 2 of the Voting Rights Act.   Moreover, the purge statute serves as a clea\n\nreminder that the law has yet to eliminate discrimination and its enduring effects\narea of voting.   For these reasons, I dissent.\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\f             Because of my deep concerns about the impact that I fear today's decision\n\nhave, both on the residents of Philadelphia who will not be able to exercise their\n\nto vote in upcoming elections, and on future efforts to properly apply the Voting R\n\nAct, I have set forth my views at considerable length.\n\n                                               I.\n\n             Early every January, in keeping with Pennsylvania's non-voting purge law,\n\nVoter Registration Division of Philadelphia's City Commissioners Office determines\n\nregistered voters have voted during the previous two calendar years.     Those who hav\n\ndone so are slated for purging.     After identifying these voters, the City sends the\n\n\"intent to purge notices.\" The notices, which are printed only in English, state:\n          NOTICE OF FAILURE TO VOTE WITHIN TWO YEARS   Our Records indicate you\n          have failed to vote for the last two years. As required by law, we\n          will cancel your Registration, unless you vote in the next Primary or\n          Election or File with this Commission a written request for\n          Reinstatement (10) ten days prior to the next Primary or Election,\n          signed by you, giving your present residence. This is the only notice\n          you will receive.\n\nAppendix (\"A.\") at 362.     The address of the Voter Registration Division appears on\n\nnotices beneath this statement.0     The notices do not, however, provide any instruct\n\nto how an individual might \"File with this Commission a written request for\n\nReinstatement,\" nor do they contain any information regarding what such a \"request\n\nReinstatement\" must contain (other than a signature and address).\n\n0\n    Additionally, in smaller type and without any explanation, \"MU6-1500\" appears in th\n             upper left corner of the notices, and \"MU6-1501\" appears in the upper rig\n             corner. At trial, Robert Lee, the Director of the Voter Registration Div\n             testified that those markings represent the Division's phone numbers. Acc\n             to Lee, that was \"obvious.\" A. at 283. Lee further testified that his o\n             did receive calls from registered voters who asked for explanations of in\n             to-purge notices that they had received. A. at 286.\n\n\n                                               5\n\f            Voters who are sent an intent to purge notice and who fail either to vote\n\nupcoming spring primary or to file a written request for reinstatement are purged f\n\nregistration rolls.   Once purged, an individual must re-register in order to vote i\n\nfuture.\n\n            The non-voting purge has a substantially disparate impact on black and La\n\nPhiladelphians.   The uncontroverted statistical evidence presented at trial, which\n\ndistrict court credited, showed that each year, greater percentages of black and La\n\nvoters were slated for purging than were white voters.

Particularly significant among those, for reasons I discuss b\n\nthe court found that Latino and black Philadelphians have suffered significant\n\ndisadvantages in education, employment, housing, health care, and income.0   These\n\n\"substantial socioeconomic disparities among African-American, Latino, and white re\n\n\n0\n     In his declaration, based on the statistics that appear in the district court\n          majority opinions, Dr. Lichtman explained: \"To put this [disparate impact\n          non-voting purge] into perspective, if the black [purge] rate in 1991 had\n          as low as the white rate, about 28,000 fewer black registrants would have\n          [slated for purging] in 1991. Conversely, if the white purge rate in 199\n          been as high as the black rate, about 41,000 more white registrants would\n          been [slated for purging] in 1991.\" A. at 386.\n\n     The 1991 purge was the largest of the four years studied, as it affected all\n     registrants who had not voted since the 1988 presidential election. About 21%\n     registrants were slated for purging, and over 80% of those slated were ultimat\n     purged. (Again, whites reinstated themselves at higher rates than blacks and\n     Latinos.) According to Dr. Lichtman, the large numbers involved in the 1991 p\n     made that the \"key year for assessing racially differential impact\" of Pennsyl\n     law. A. at 385. While the numbers of registrants purged, as well as the magn\n     of the disparate impact, decreased in other years, that fact does not undermin\n     significance of the 1991 figures. To the contrary, as Dr. Lichtman explained,\n     that a relatively smaller proportion of black than white registrants were avai\n     for purging after 1991, it is striking that in 1992 even a small difference be\n     whites and blacks persists.\" A. at 391.\n0\n     In stating its findings with respect to housing and employment, the district c\n          observed that the City has been held liable for practicing discrimination\n          these areas.

I agree that § 2 plaintiffs must show a causal connection between the voting p\n\nthey challenge and the deprivation of equal political opportunity they allege.   Thi\n\n-- which, I believe, the plaintiffs also accept0 -- is not open to question.   The l\n\nof the Voting Rights Act, the legislative history of the 1982 amendments, and contr\n\nprecedent all foreclose any argument that a voting practice can violate § 2 without\n\nresulting in, or playing some part in causing, the abridgement of citizens' voting\n\nThe majority, however, actually requires something more than and different from the\n\nconnection it initially describes.   From its uncontroversial answer to what it pres\n\nthe primary legal question, it departs from and distorts the meaning of § 2.\n\n\n\n0\n      According to the majority, the plaintiffs have argued that they need not show\n           causal connection between a challenged voting practice and the discrimina\n           effect of which they complain. Maj. Op. Typescript at 15. That is not a\n           accurate characterization of the plaintiffs' position. In their brief, t\n           plaintiffs insist that they have \"never asserted that the discriminatory\n           need not be in part attributable to the purge.\" Appellants' Brief at 41\n           The district court misunderstood them, they explain, when it formed the\n           impression that they denied that causation was relevant to their claim.\n           Neither the majority nor the City has advanced a waiver argument. Thus,\n           regardless of whether the plaintiffs ever took the untenable position for\n           they received credit in the district court, the important point, for pres\n           purposes, is that contrary to the majority's description of their argumen\n           have not denied the relevance of causation here.\n\n\n\n                                             12\n\f            On two occasions, the district court stated that the plaintiffs had not p\n\nviolation of § 2 because they had failed to demonstrate that \"the purge law is the\n\ndispositive force in depriving minority voters of equal access to the political pro\n\n. . .\"     Ortiz, 824 F. Supp. at 539 (emphasis added); see also id. at 524.    That is\n\nproper legal standard.    Section 2 does not require plaintiffs to prove that a chall\n\nvoting practice or procedure is \"the dispositive force,\" or the only cause, or even\n\nprincipal cause, of unequal political opportunity.     Neither the statute, nor its\n\nlegislative history, nor the relevant case law supports such a reading.     To the con\n\nthat authority requires us to determine whether a challenged law interacts with oth\n\nexternal conditions to limit the political opportunities available to members of pr\n\nclasses.    Gingles, 478 U.S. at 47.   As White and § 2(b) state, we must consider the\n\ntotality of the circumstances.    Those circumstances -- the \"social and historical\n\nconditions\" that make up the \"past and present reality\" surrounding political proce\n\ncreate the factual environment in which a challenged voting practice operates.        As\n\nthey necessarily contribute to the effect that a practice has on individuals' polit\nopportunities.    In order to properly apply § 2 in this case, we cannot require the\n\nplaintiffs to prove that Pennsylvania's non-voting purge law operates, by itself an\n\nindependently of other circumstances, to produce discriminatory results.       The chall\n\nlaw must certainly be a contributing cause of unequal opportunity, but it need not\n\nthe district court twice suggested, \"the dispositive force.\"\n\n            At oral argument, the City conceded this point.   It did not defend the\n\n\"dispositive force\" language that appears in the district court's opinion, but inst\nargued that in spite of these erroneous comments, the court understood and applied\n\n\n\n                                               13\n\fproper legal standard.   To an extent, I am inclined to agree with that position.     A\n\n(though slightly charitable) reading of the district court's analysis reveals that,\n\nleast on occasion, it seems to have understood that while § 2 plaintiffs must demon\n\nthat a voting practice interacts with other, external circumstances to cause an act\n\neffect, such plaintiffs need not establish that the practice is the dispositive or\n\nprimary cause of the results giving rise to their claim.\n\n          The majority, however, in contrast to the City, does not in any way quali\n\nsupport for the district court's statements.0     Instead, it adopts the view that in o\n\nto have established a violation of § 2, the plaintiffs would have needed to prove t\n\nnon-voting purge operated independently of social and historical conditions to caus\n\ninequality of which they complain.   Thus, the majority concludes that while black a\n\nLatino voters have turned out in lower numbers, the purge law did not cause that\n\nstatistical disparity.   Maj. Op. Typescript at 21.

Op. Typescript at 18 n.11. I do not grasp the purpose or effect of\n          translation. The majority does not disagree with the substance of the co\n          statements; instead, it reads § 2 to require proof of a \"legally disposit\n          cause, by which it means a single cause of all relevant circumstances, th\n          entirely responsible for the discriminatory effect of which a plaintiff\n          complains. There is no place, in the majority's construction of § 2, for\n          contributing causes of inequality which are not themselves products of th\n          challenged voting law. As I explain below, I do share this view.\n\n\n                                             14\n\finteract with the challenged law to bring about such a discriminatory result -- abs\n\nproof that those factors are themselves products of the law -- no violation of § 2\n\noccurred.0\n\n             Accordingly, the majority states that the discrimination and disadvantage\n\nthe plaintiffs experienced in education, employment, health care, housing, and inco\n\nwhich the district court found and documented, \"just are not relevant.\" Maj.

Op. Typescript at 19-20 (quotation unattributed); see\n          Maj. Op. Typescript at 10 n.4 and accompanying text (perhaps suggesting t\n          plaintiffs' complaint improvidently endorsed the majority's construction\n          § 2). That would certainly be a curious way for a party who rejected the\n          relevance of causation to plead a § 2 case. In fact, the plaintiffs have\n          pleaded, accepted, or claimed to have met the legal standard of causation\n          the majority now adopts. See Appellants' Brief at 37 (arguing that \"[t]h\n          does not require a demonstration that the practice in and of itself resul\n          discriminatory result,\" and claiming to have \"demonstrated that historic,\n          political, and socio-economic discrimination interacts with the non-votin\n          to disproportionately disenfranchise Latinos and African-American voters\"\n          at 14, 31, 41 n.8 (arguing that the purge law, operating in conjunction w\n          social and historical conditions, was a contributing cause of the\n          disproportionate purging of Latinos and blacks); see also A. at 18-20\n          (plaintiffs' complaint, not pleading any view of § 2 causation). Nor have\n          plaintiffs pleaded or argued the opposite extreme -- that causation is\n          irrelevant. As they state in their brief, they accept that in order to p\n          they must show that the discriminatory result of which they complain must\n          attributable, in part, to the law they challenge. Appellants' Brief at 4\n          n.8. Of course, even if the plaintiffs had taken either of the directly\n          opposing erroneous positions the majority attributes to them, that would\n          require us to adopt an erroneous construction of § 2 in deciding this cas\n\n\n                                               15\n\flink, between those factors and the purge law.    Id. at 25.   After all, nothing in t\n\nrecord suggests that the non-voting purge makes black and Latino residents of Phila\n\nso much worse off.   It is not the purge law that causes members of minority groups\n\nless frequently, and therefore to lose the ability to vote more often by removing t\n\ndisproportionately high rates from the registration rolls. That is the kind of \"leg\n\ndispositive\" causal connection that the majority would require the plaintiffs to es\n\nin order to prevail on their § 2 claim.0\n0\n     The majority's reading of the Senate Report casts additional light on the subs\n          of its rationale. In its view, the Report expresses the expectation that\n          would \"focus on the challenged procedure and its causal consequences . .\n          Maj. Op. Typescript at 14 n.6. The \"focus\" the majority has in mind, how\n          is quite restrictive; it encompasses nothing more than the challenged law\n          it excludes all other factors that the law has not created, but which\n          nonetheless might contribute to the law's effect. Thus, under the majori\n          reading of the Senate Report, Congress has instructed that § 2 might proh\n          purge statute which \"itself\" produces discriminatory results. Id.\n\n\n     The Senate Report does support the well-settled point that plaintiffs must pro\n     causal connection between the law they challenge and the discriminatory result\n     identify. Congress in no way, however, expressed any agreement with the majori\n     view that the challenged law must itself account for its unlawful effects. Ac\n     to the Senate Report, a court's \"focus\" must remain broad and varying enough t\n     encompass the totality of the circumstances with which a voting practice invar\n     interacts to influence the nature of political processes.\n\n     In concluding its opinion, the majority appears to abandon its causation argum\n     The dissent might have meaning, it states, in a § 2 challenge to registration\n     procedures in which plaintiffs alleged that as a result of socioeconomic\n     disadvantages, they experienced greater difficulty traveling to registration c\n     or in some other way availing themselves of registration opportunities. Maj.\n     Typescript at 29. That surprising comment cannot be reconciled with the major\n     legal argument. If the conditions of inequality the district court found here\n     extraneous to the plaintiffs' legal claim, those circumstances could not be re\n     in the hypothetical suit the majority describes. In neither case could member\n     protected class show that the laws they challenged caused the practical diffic\n     they experienced. In neither case would the laws themselves be responsible fo\n\n\n                                             16\n\f          Finally, the majority reasons that this type of causation could not, unde\n\ncircumstances, exist here, because a non-voting purge law, by its very nature, only\n\naffects people who have managed to register at least once.   Maj. Op. Typescript at\n\nSuch people, it points out, must have already demonstrated their ability to overcom\n\nwhatever barriers might prevent them from participating in the political process, a\n\nlaw that merely requires them to do so again could not violate §2.

The premis\n\nunderlying this reasoning can only be that unless a law has prevented members of a\n\nprotected class from ever having registered or cast a vote, it is permissible under\n\nVoting Rights Act.\n\n          According to the Supreme Court, the essence of a § 2 claim is that a cert\n\nelectoral law interacts with other circumstances to cause unequal political opportu\n\nGingles, 478 U.S. at 47.

The only question, in its view, was whether the court\n\nerred in finding that blacks had registered in significantly lower numbers.    Operat\n\nPUSH III, 932 F.2d at 409-13.

Instead, the courts looked to the way in which the challenged laws\n\ninteracted with social and historical conditions, such as the class members' occupa\n\nstatus and limited access to transportation and information, to result in a lack of\n\nopportunity for the plaintiffs to participate in the political process.    The obviou\n\nthat the causes of those conditions had little or nothing to do with the challenged\n\nregistration laws was legally irrelevant to the Operation PUSH courts, which clearl\n\nnot share the majority's understanding of § 2.0\n\n\n0\n      The majority's attempt to distinguish the Operation PUSH cases is unpersuasiv\n      states that in Operation PUSH, unlike this case, the challenged voting laws w\n      \"the causes of black voters' registering at lower rates than white voters.\"\n      Op.

Id. at 1555-56. In such\n\ncircumstances, which the plaintiffs in Salas had failed to prove, an at-large distr\n\nwould be subject to a § 2 challenge brought by members of a majority class.     But th\n\nplaintiffs had not accounted, in any way, for their inability to take advantage of\nmajority status.   In that context, we can understand the court's statement that \"a\n\nprotected class is not entitled to § 2 relief merely because it turns out in a lowe\n\npercentage than whites to vote.\"   Salas, 964 F.2d at 1556.\n\n          Here, the plaintiffs are not members of a majority class confronting the\n\ndifficult task of satisfying the Gingles preconditions.   The questions this case pr\n\nand the factors that we must take into account in providing answers, are somewhat\n\ndifferent.   Nonetheless, to the extent that Salas does provide guidance, the decisi\nactually rejects the majority's reading of the Voting Rights Act.    According to the\n\n\n\n                                             27\n\fCircuit, the plaintiffs in Salas could have prevailed if they had shown the existen\n\n\"practical impediments to voting\" or low turnout rates resulting from prior discrim\n\n(as may have occurred here, according to the district court).   Those circumstances,\n\ncourt reasoned, could interact with the state's districting plan in such a way as t\n\ndeprive class members of an equal opportunity to participate in the political proce\n\nto elect their chosen representatives.   Under the majority's construction of § 2, h\n\nthe Salas plaintiffs would have needed to prove that the voting measure they challe\n\nan at-large district, actually caused the practical impediments to voting or the lo\n\nturnout rates that compromised their chances for success.   Of course, that is an\n\nimpossible requirement.

It is difficult to overstate the\n     differences between Irby and the case before us. In Irby, a group of individ\n     black plaintiffs and two civil rights organizations challenged a law that pro\n     for the appointment, rather than the election, of school board members.

Second, in Irby, the plaintiffs had failed to show any causal\n     connection between the selection system they challenged and the underrepresen\n     of blacks on school boards; for example, the court pointed out, in one of the\n     counties where a statistically significant disparity did exist, every black r\n     who had requested appointment to the school board since 1971 had been selecte\n\n\n                                             28\n\f          In amending § 2, Congress devoted most of its attention to vote dilution\n\nWhite v. Register, for example, the case from which Congress drew the legal standar\n\ndefining a violation of § 2, involved a challenge to state reapportionment plans.\n\nZimmer v. McKeithen, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"314046\"><a href=\"/opinion/314046/charles-f-zimmer-stewart-marshall-intervenor-appellant-v-john-j/\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1297</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Cir. 1973), which articulated and enumerate\n\nfactors that the Court had taken into consideration in White, addressed the legalit\n\nmulti-member districts.   The Senate Report's now-familiar list of \"typical\" (but no\n\nexclusive or required) factors that plaintiffs can show in establishing a violation\n\nis drawn directly from Zimmer.   See Sen. Rep. at 29.   Congress made clear, however,\n\nwhile it had focused and relied mainly on vote dilution cases in amending § 2 and\n\nexplaining the new provision's meaning, § 2 would continue to prohibit \"all voting\n\ndiscrimination,\" including \"episodic\" practices which did not involve the \"permanen\n\nstructural barriers\" to political equality seen in the vote dilution context. Sen.\n\n30.   The Report explains:\n                If the challenged practice relates to such a series of events or\n           episodes, the proof sufficient to establish a violation would not\n           necessarily involve the same factors as the courts have utilized when\n           dealing with permanent structural barriers. Of course, the ultimate\n           test would be the White standard codified by this amendment of Section\n           2: whether, in the particular situation, the practice operated to deny\n\n      member. Id. at 1358. In light of those facts, the Fourth Circuit concluded\n      the appointive system did not produce a disparate effect. Id. at 1359. The I\n      court had no occasion even to consider a causation requirement such as the on\n      majority adopts here, because the challenged practice played no part in bring\n      about the lower number of blacks on the two school boards. Such a situation\n      at all similar to one in which a purge law directly removes disproportionatel\n      numbers of minority citizens from the registration rolls.\n\n      At the very most, Irby provides incremental support for the position that § 2\n      plaintiffs must show some causal connection between a challenged voting pract\n      the disparity at issue. As I have stated, that is not a controversial point,\n      neither the plaintiffs nor I suggest otherwise.\n\n\n                                             29\n\f           the minority plaintiff an equal opportunity to participate and to\n           elect candidates of their choice.\n\nId.   Thus, events or episodes occurring during the administration of elections that\n\nresulted in unequal political opportunity would remain unlawful, although the facto\n\nrelevant to proving such discriminatory effects might well be different from those\n\ninvolved in vote dilution cases.\n\n           In a footnote to the statement quoted above, Congress mentions purging as\nvariety of the \"episodic discrimination\" that § 2 would continue to prohibit.0    The\n\nstates: \"[P]urging of voters could produce a discriminatory result if fair procedur\n\nnot followed, Toney v.

First, as I discuss at greater length below, the City did not pro\n\nneed\" for Pennsylvania's non-voting purge law.    The district court found that the l\n\n\n0\n       While purging could be conducted \"episodically\" -- that is, on discrete occas\n       in a related series of events -- I would not describe the annual operation of\n       Pennsylvania's non-voting purge law as \"episodic.\" It is not \"structural\" in\n       same way as a redistricting plan; nor is it temporary, however, and the law p\n       its discriminatory effects in a reliable and consistent manner from year to y\n       Therefore, I will not refer to the kind of purging that occurred in this case\n       \"episodic\" voting practice.\n0\n       By making clear that purging can violate § 2, the Senate Report creates a pot\n       problem for the majority's argument that these laws, because they only affect\n       individuals who have registered and voted, must be permissible. The majority\n       with this problem by emphasizing that in each example of unlawful purging the\n       Report mentions, it is the statute \"itself\" that produces a discriminatory re\n       Putting aside, for the moment, my more important disagreements with the major\n       reading of § 2's legislative history, and with its theory of causation, the f\n       remains that even a purge law that itself produces unlawful results can only\n       voters who have already registered. This troublesome point, however, is only\n       minor symptom of the infirmity afflicting the majority's argument.\n\n\n                                             30\n\fserved the legitimate purpose of preventing fraud, but laws are not necessary merel\n\nbecause they serve a valid purpose.    Second, Congress mentioned purging as an examp\n\nthe \"episodic discrimination\" that would remain within the scope of § 2, and the ty\n\npurges it listed in the one sentence it devoted to the subject are merely more spec\n\nexamples of the way in which purging can have a \"discriminatory result.\"    Congress\n\nprovided no indication that purging could not produce discriminatory results, and t\n\nviolate § 2, in other ways.    Indeed, such a suggestion would run directly counter t\n\nflexible approach to § 2 cases that Congress intended courts to follow in situation\n\ninvolving different factual and legal variables.0\n\n          In the majority's view, however, the Senate Report's brief and illustrati\n\nreference to purging contains an \"implicit\" recognition \"that a purge statute which\n\nadministered fairly, and in an even-handed manner, would not run afoul of the law.\"\n\nOp. Typescript at 14 n.6.     I have no idea where the majority finds such an implicat\n\nThe text of the footnote plainly does not support it.    See Ortiz, 824 F.

Moreover, Congress expressly disavowed the kind\n\npurpose the majority believes it implied, stating: \"[E]ven a consistently applied p\n\npremised on a racially neutral policy would not negate a plaintiff's showing throug\n\nfactors that the challenged practice denies minorities fair access to the process.\"\n\nRep. at 29 n.117.   Finally, under the majority's perception of what Congress implic\n\nrecognized, not even all the examples included in the Report's brief reference to p\n\nwould constitute violations of § 2.   An unnecessary purge law that \"unduly limited\"\n\nopportunities for re-registration, for instance, would not, in the majority's view,\n\nafoul of the Voting Rights Act so long as the law was administered fairly.   Congres\n\nstatements, which express a different view, do not dissuade the majority from relyi\n\nan unsupported implication that would severely, and I believe improperly, limit the\n\nof § 2 in challenges to the purging of registered voters.\n\n          The Senate Report acknowledges that especially outside the context of vot\n\ndilution claims, the factors that courts should consider in determining whether a\nchallenged voting practice violates § 2 may well be different than those appearing\n\nlist of \"typical\" factors drawn from White and Zimmer. The Report does not, however\n\nprovide any guidance with respect to what factors courts should consider in the typ\n\ncase we confront here.   The majority makes no effort to identify or explore the\n\nconsiderations that figure into an evaluation of the effect and legality of a non-v\n\npurge law, probably because, in light of its theory of causation, it sees no need t\n\nso. The district court, in contrast, addressed this important question, see Ortiz,\nSupp. at 523-24, and I agree with some of its conclusions.

The critical\n\nit bears repeating, is that contrary to the majority's view, whatever the relevant\n\nare, they need not be products of, or causally linked to, a challenged voting law i\n\nto merit consideration in a court's determination of the law's effect and legality.\n\na law's interaction with the totality of the circumstances, and not its creation of\n\ncircumstances, that § 2 requires us to evaluate.\n\n                                             B.\n\n          The plaintiffs have argued that in order to prove that Pennsylvania's non\n\npurge law violates § 2, they must, in addition to showing the law's disparate impac\n\nblacks and Latinos, demonstrate that the State could achieve its legitimate goal of\npreventing election fraud in a less discriminatory way. As noted above, the Senate\n\nprovides some support for that position by stating that if the \"need for a purge\" i\n\nshown, the practice could constitute an instance of prohibited \"episodic discrimina\n\nSen.

Moreover, they have asked u\n\nfind that they carried that burden at trial.\n\n          I agree with much, though not all, of the plaintiffs' argument.    In enact\n\namending § 2, Congress did not intend to mandate equal political opportunity at the\n\nexpense of state and local governments' abilities to pursue legitimate goals such a\n\nprevention of voting fraud.   Where measures are in fact necessary to achieve such\n\nobjectives, Congress would have surely meant for them to remain in effect.    There i\n\npoint in guaranteeing equal access to corrupt political processes that have no demo\n\nvalue.   To the contrary, the Voting Rights Act is premised on the existence of free\n\nfair elections that reflect popular will with accuracy and integrity, and it should\n\ninterpreted to prevent such elections from occurring.0 However, a voting practice th\n\ncompromises equality, as I believe Pennsylvania's purge statute does, should only b\n\npermitted if it is in fact necessary to achieve or preserve this type of public int\n\n0\n      I share the majority's concern about Philadelphia's need to guard against fra\n      voting practices in administering its elections.

Trial judges are not obligated to credit\n\nuncontroverted testimony; they can simply remain unpersuaded.    In this case, the di\n\ncourt never considered whether the City needed a non-voting purge law to prevent el\n\nfraud because the legal standard it adopted did not include this element.    The cour\n\nthat the policy reasons for the law were \"not tenuous,\" and that the law in fact se\n\nits intended purpose. \"Not tenuous,\" however, is a long way from necessary.    The\n\nplaintiffs' evidence would have easily supported a finding that practical, effectiv\ndiscriminatory alternatives to the purge do exist, but it did not \"indisputably est\n\nanything. As a court of appeals, we are in no position to resolve this question.\n\nTherefore, under my view of § 2 and the evidence presented, a remand would be appro\n\n\n\n\n     convicted felons. Id. at 1261-62. In that context, a court could readily co\n     that a statute disenfranchising felons was necessary to serve the state's com\n     penalogical interests. It is doubtful that the objective of restricting offe\n     rights to participate in civil society could be met in a different way. In a\n     event, because the plaintiffs here have not lost their rights by committing c\n     Wesley is distinguishable.\n\n\n                                             38\n\f           The majority, however, without the assistance of the district court, and\n\nevidentiary support, now finds that the non-voting purge law actually is \"needed\" t\n\nprevent electoral fraud.   Maj. Op. Typescript at 26 (relying on \"a review of the re\n\nand present reality\").    That is an unfounded conclusion.    Again, I do not dispute t\n\npurge law serves a valid purpose; I accept the district court's finding that the la\n\nuseful in preventing fraud.   But neither the anecdotal incidents the majority menti\n\nthe record show anything more.   Contrary to the majority's apparent view, usefulnes\n\nnecessity are two entirely different things.    In order to find that the purge law i\n\nneeded, as the majority now does, a court must first consider whether equally effec\n\nbut less discriminatory alternatives exist, which neither the district court nor th\n\nmajority has ever done.\n\n           The testimony of Emmett Fremaux, Jr., whom the district court qualified a\n\nexpert on election and voter registration procedures, provides the only evidence in\n\nrecord on the subject of alternatives to the non-voting purge law.      Fremaux testifi\n\nthe law's important purposes could be achieved more effectively through other mecha\nwhich, unlike purge laws, would not have a pronounced discriminatory effect.      A. at\n\n316.   He based his opinion, to a significant extent, on his experience in administe\n\nregistration and election procedures in Washington, D.C., which had successfully re\n\nits non-voting purge law with a \"mail canvass\" system.       In addition, Fremaux stated\n\nlarge cities run clean elections without relying on non-voting purges.      A. at 331.\n\n           Through this testimony, the plaintiffs introduced uncontroverted evidence\n\nmore effective, less discriminatory alternatives to a non-voting purge law do exist\nMoreover, the City has not suggested that come January, 1995, when the National Vot\n\n\n\n                                               39\n\fRegistration Act becomes effective and puts an end to the non-voting purge (at leas\n\nelections for federal office),0 alarming numbers of voters will emerge from prior\n\nresidences or the grave to defile the integrity of Philadelphia elections.    In a ma\n\nmonths, purging will cease.   Elections, presumably, will not.   At oral argument, th\n\nstated that it had every intention of complying with the new law.   Apparently,\n\nPhiladelphia believes that starting next year, it will somehow manage without the p\n\nstatute that the majority finds it needs this year.0\n\n          The district court may not have been persuaded by the evidence that viabl\n\ndiscriminatory alternatives to purging do exist.   That, again, is its prerogative.\n\nMoreover, before considering the question on remand, the court might properly exerc\n\ndiscretion to allow the parties to present additional evidence on this issue.     The\n\ndid not do so at trial, no doubt, because it did not (and still does not) believe t\n\nquestion was legally relevant.\n\n\n\n0\n      See 42 U.S.C.S. § 1973gg-6(b). I discuss this legislation at greater length\n      infra pp. 54-57, 74 & n.40.\n0\n      I do not mean to suggest that the impending effectiveness of the National Vot\n      Registration Act constitutes conclusive proof that the purge statute is not\n      necessary. The City might be able to demonstrate that compliance will require\n      financial, administrative, or informational resources that it does not presen\n      possess. The district court could properly consider such an argument on rema\n\n      The impending unlawfulness of purging also does not constitute a reason to ta\n      case any less seriously. First, elections will be held later this year, and a\n      majority points out, the City has already begun to purge. Citizens whose\n      registration is nullified will not be able to vote, and they will not be\n      automatically reinstated when the practice becomes prohibited. Second, this\n      decision, like the discriminatory effects of the purge statute, is likely to\n      the statute itself. The cessation of purging will not cure the majority's er\n      construction of § 2.\n\n\n                                             40\n\f            While I do not accept the plaintiffs' argument that they have \"indisput\n\nestablished\" the existence of effective, less discriminatory alternatives to the s\n\n they challenge, they can at least point to substantial, even uncontroverted evide\n\n   support of that position.    The majority cannot make nearly as strong a case for\n\n    unassisted finding that Philadelphia does need the non-voting purge law to prev\n\n electoral fraud.   Unlike the majority, I do not believe that we are in any positi\n\ndecide this question.    Thus, while the purge statute may or may not be necessary, a\n\n                                     certainly is.    C.\n\n          To summarize, largely as a result of social and historical conditions ref\n\nin the district court's findings, black and Latino Philadelphians vote less often.\n\nBecause they vote less often, Pennsylvania's non-voting purge law operates to remov\n\nmembers of these protected classes from the registration rolls at disproportionatel\n\nhigher rates.   The purge law, as the majority emphasizes, is not the sole or primar\n\nof the circumstances with which it interacts to limit the opportunity of blacks and\n\nLatinos to vote in Philadelphia.   In my view, however, neither § 2 nor the decision\nconstruing it require the plaintiffs to make such an implausible showing, and the m\n\nhas erred in concluding otherwise.   Finally, given the demonstrated disparate impac\n\nthe non-voting purge law, and the way in which it interacts with social and histori\n\nconditions to deprive members of protected classes of an equal opportunity to parti\n\nin the political process, I would require the City to establish that the law is nec\n\nto prevent voting fraud.   That is a question that should be left, in the first inst\n\nto the district court.\n\n                                             III.\n\n\n\n                                              41\n\f          Both the district court and the majority place some importance on the abi\n\nblack and Latino voters to reinstate themselves after being slated for purging, or\n\nregister once purged.   Neither opinion clearly spells out the legal significance of\n\npossibility of reinstatement or re-registration.    The district court stated its ult\n\nconclusion as follows: \"Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that the purge law in\n\nwith social and historical conditions to deny minority voters equal access to the\n\npolitical process and to elect their preferred representatives, particularly since\n\nundisputed that the purge procedure is administered fairly and that there is ample\n\nopportunity for purged voters to re-register to vote.\"    Ortiz, 824 F. Supp. at 539.\n\ncourt further stated that \"[v]oters in jeopardy of being purged who are interested\n\npreserving their right to participate in the political process need only vote or re\n\nreinstatement to preserve that right.\"   Id.   The majority takes a similar position;\n\n\n0\n     This statement reveals that the district court based its conclusion, at least\n     part, on its view of the plaintiffs' opportunity to re-register. However, th\n     did not make any factual findings on this subject; we do not know how many pu\n     voters re-registered, or how many of those who did so are black or Latino.\n     Consequently, while the opportunity to re-register undeniably exists in a pur\n     formal sense, we do not have even the roughest measure of its practical effec\n     district court also did not explain why the possibility of re-registration wa\n     legally significant. If for no other reason -- and there are other reasons -\n     lack of factual and analytical precision, in what is otherwise an admirably t\n     and conscientious opinion, should necessitate a remand. In Jenkins, we state\n     \"[b]ecause the complexity of the proof and the importance of the issues invol\n     the district courts must be particularly thorough in explaining their finding\n     both the ultimate issue of vote dilution and on their subsidiary findings as\n     Jenkins, 4 F.3d at 1135 n.35. Section 2 cases that do not involve vote dilut\n     claims raise similarly complex and important issues and thus merit the same\n     thoroughness. The district court, which decided Ortiz before we issued Jenki\n     should be given a chance to comply with this instruction. The remainder of i\n     opinion demonstrates that even without our guidance, the court recognized the\n     propriety of devoting special efforts to this type of decision.\n\n\n                                               42\n\fview, disproportionate numbers of Latinos and blacks are purged \"because they do no\n\nand they do not take the opportunity of voting in the next election or requesting\n\nreinstatement.\"   Maj. Op. Typescript at 20-21.\n\n          As I explain above, the district court's conclusion that the non-voting p\n\nlaw does not interact with social and historical conditions to deny blacks and Lati\n\nequal access to the political process is irreconcilable with the factual findings o\n\nit bases its decision.   Thus, in my view, that conclusion is erroneous.0   Moreover,\n\n0\n     Because the majority is in complete agreement with the district court's legal\n     reasoning, it treats the court's ultimate conclusion that no § 2 violation oc\n     here as a purely factual one that we review only for clear error. Maj. Op.\n     Typescript at 16 & n.8. It is worth noting, however, that there is a substan\n     legal component to § 2 decisions, and that therefore, our standard of review\n     context is not as lenient as the majority opinion might suggest. Judge Becke\n     writing for the court in Jenkins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"652881\"><a href=\"/opinion/652881/alden-jenkins-harlan-roberts-gwendolyn-neal-v-red-clay-consolidated-school/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1103</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir. 1993), recently provid\n     instructive (and controlling) explanation of the applicable standard of revie\n     § 2 cases. Discussing the same language in Gingles v. Thornburg on which the\n     majority relies for the standard it applies, Jenkins points out that while th\n     district court's factual findings are entitled to deference under Rule 52(a)'\n     error standard:\n\n          \"Rule 52(a) `does not inhibit an appellate court's power to correct error\n          of law, including those that may infect a so-called mixed finding of law\n          fact, or a finding of fact that is predicated on a misunderstanding of th\n          governing rule of law.'\" This result is clearly necessary since both the\n          ultimate determination of vote dilution and the accompanying subsidiary\n          determinations often depend on important legal questions. Accordingly, w\n          must subject the district court's underlying legal analysis to plenary\n          review to ensure that the appropriate legal standards are applied. As th\n          [Gingles] Court concluded, it is this combination of factual deference an\n          legal review that best \"preserves the benefit of the trial court's\n          particular familiarity with the indigenous political reality without\n          endangering the rule of law.\"\n\n     Jenkins, 4 F.3d at 1116-17 (quoting Gingles, 478 U.S. at 79, in turn quoting\n     Corp. v. Consumers Union, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111164\"><a href=\"/opinion/111164/bose-corp-v-consumers-union-of-united-states-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">485</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 501 (1984)). While the majority may\n     disagree with the more complex standard of review we described in Jenkins, it\n\n\n                                             43\n\fplaintiffs' ability to reinstate or re-register themselves after being purged does\n\ncure the deprivation of equality that unlawfully results from the law's interaction\n\nthe totality of the circumstances.   A functional view of the political process, inf\n\nby a searching evaluation of past and present reality, reveals that for members of\n\nand language minority groups, neither reinstatement nor re-registration is an\n\ninsignificant barrier to participation. The majority's suggestion to the contrary f\n\nfrom its formalistic understanding of political opportunity and its failure to cons\n\nthe reality that Congress instructs us to consult in evaluating the legality of cha\n\nvoting laws under § 2.\n\n          Interestingly, the majority contrasts Pennsylvania's non-voting purge law\n\nsome better-known measures that states and localities have employed with the purpos\n\neffect of disenfranchising minority voters.   It points out, for example, that unlik\n\n\"`race-neutral' literacy tests,\" the purge law is not the type of device \"which\n\ndiscriminates against minorities, which has no rational basis, and which is beyond\n\ncontrol of minority voters.\"   Maj. Op. Typescript at 19.   But really, what would\ndistinguish a § 2 challenge brought against a facially neutral and evenly applied l\n\ntest, which had been adopted to further a state's legitimate interest in ensuring\n\nparticipation by a minimally informed electorate, from a § 2 challenge such as the\n\n     opinion does not fully convey the significance of the legal component of § 2\n     decisions.\n\n     I do not take issue with any of the subsidiary factual findings the district\n     made in this case. In my view, however, as I have stated, those findings can\n     reconciled with its ultimate conclusion that no § 2 violation occurred. My\n     disagreement with the district court, therefore, strikes me as more legal tha\n     factual. In any event, my position does not depend on the applicable standard\n     review.\n\n\n                                              44\n\fplaintiffs have brought here?0 Surely, members of protected classes can take the\n\nopportunity to learn to read (English).   Surely, the literacy test itself would not\n\nfault if they failed to do so.   The state would not have prevented such plaintiffs\n\nvoting.   Rather, under the majority's reasoning, the legally permissible explanatio\n\nthe literacy test's disparate impact would be that minority citizens learn to read\n\nstatistically lower rate than white voters. Literacy, after all, like filing a writ\n\nRequest for Reinstatement or a voter registration form, is not \"beyond the control\n\nminority voters.\"   In fact, reinstatement and re-registration require literacy, alo\n\nother skills and resources; without the ability to read, an individual will not eve\n\nthat he or she has been slated for purging, let alone be able to respond to such a\n\nby reinstatement or re-registration.   So what makes a well-intentioned, evenly appl\n\nand race-neutral literacy test objectionable under § 2, as the majority seems to ag\n\nis, while a device like Pennsylvania's non-voting purge law has no trouble passing\n\nscrutiny?   Why does one measure unlawfully discriminate against minorities, while t\n\nother does not?   The majority does not suggest an answer to these questions, and I\nimagine one.0\n0\n      I am aware that § 201 of the Voting Rights Act Amendments of 1970, as amended\n      U.S.C. § 1973aa, specifically prohibits the use of literacy tests. Hypotheti\n      however, such prerequisites to voting could also be challenged under § 2.\n0\n      In Gaston County, North Carolina v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107954\"><a href=\"/opinion/107954/gaston-county-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">395</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">285</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1969), a cou\n      brought suit under § 4(a) of the Voting Rights Act seeking to reinstate a lit\n      test that it had formerly used as a prerequisite to registration.

In the Court's view, th\n      County had failed to disprove that \"use of its literacy test, coupled with it\n      racially segregated and unequal school system, discriminatorily deprived Negr\n      the franchise.\" Id. at 293. Of course, as the brief history of segregation\n      educational inequality set forth in the Court's opinion made clear, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">395</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n      <span class=\"page\">96</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, the literacy test was not responsible for the fact that a disproportionat\n\n\n                                             45\n\f          Of the more than 190,000 people who were slated for purging in 1991, all\n\nwhom, of course, had already taken the trouble to register in the first place, full\n\nfailed to reinstate themselves.   Reinstatement rates were consistently higher for w\n\nvoters than for blacks and Latinos.   The district court and majority opinions leave\n\npossible impression that the 156,000 or so voters who did not object to getting pur\n\njust lost interest in political participation. After all, nothing prevented them fr\n\nproperly filing a written Request for Reinstatement.   They had the opportunity.   Th\n\nsimply did not take it.   If these citizens had really wanted to preserve their abil\n\nvote, surely they could and would have done so.   As the district court put it, regi\n\nwho were \"interested in preserving their right to participate in the political proc\n\nneed[ed] only vote or request reinstatement to preserve that right.\"   Ortiz, 824 F.\n\nat 539.   Mass apathy, particularly among blacks and Latinos, is the only explanatio\n\ndisinterest is not actionable under the Voting Rights Act. See, e.g., Maj. Op. Type\n\nat 21 (relying on Salas for the proposition that members of a protected class are n\n\nentitled to relief under § 2 merely because they vote less often).   As the City sta\nits brief, the \"extra effort\" required to reinstate or re-register oneself \"is enti\n\nthe result of the apathy of individual voters.\"   Appellee's Brief at 42.\n\n          Viewed formalistically, the task of filing a written Request for Reinstat\n\nwith the Voter Registration Division of the City Commissioners Office might seem li\n\n     percentage of the black residents of Gaston County could not pass such a test\n     There was no evidence of a \"link,\" as the majority might put it, between the\n     challenged voting law and the plaintiffs' lack of reading skills. Nonetheles\n     according to the Court, that social and historical condition, \"coupled with\"\n     of even an impartially applied literacy test, resulted in a discriminatory\n     disenfranchisement of black citizens and therefore was not permissible under\n     Voting Rights Act.\n\n\n                                             46\n\feasy thing to do.   From a more practical perspective, however, based on the reinsta\n\nstatistics and a sense for past and present reality that is not diminished by troub\n\nassumptions about the behavior and motivations of black and Latino citizens, we sho\n\nknow better.   See Marengo County Comm'n, 731 F.2d at 1568 (\"Both Congress and the c\n\nhave rejected efforts to blame reduced black participation on `apathy'.\").\n\n          The record does not contain statistics showing how many voters re-registe\n\nbeing purged, or how many such voters are black or Latino.   We know that as a gener\n\nmatter, members of minority groups register in lower percentages than whites.   At t\n\nSandy Newman, the Executive Director of the plaintiff Project Vote, testified that\n\norganization's efforts to register minority voters, individuals attempting to fill\n\nregistration forms make errors or omissions in \"roughly half the cases.\"   A. at 93.\n\nCouncilman Ortiz and his aide, Israel Colon, described the special difficulties the\n\nexperienced in efforts to register Latinos, especially as a result of the language\n\nbarrier. A. at 50-51, 129.   According to testimony presented by Robert Lee, the Dir\n\nof the City's Voter Registration Division, his office rejected about 8,800 of the\nregistration forms submitted between April and October of 1992; about one out of ev\n\ntwenty forms failed to make the grade.   A. at 173.   Apparently, realistically, the\n\nre-registration does, in fact, create a significant obstacle to participation, espe\n\nfor members of minority groups.0\n\n\n0\n      The majority believes that I have overlooked the fact that individuals cannot\n      purged without having already demonstrated their ability to register. Maj. O\n      Typescript at 24. Registering, it points out, can be no harder the second ti\n      around than it was the first. Id. at 21 n.14. I have not overlooked this po\n      Rather, I believe it is partly unimportant and partly untrue.\n\n\n\n                                             47\n\f          Any doubt that the record leaves regarding the burden of re-registration\n\nanswered by the recent passage of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, P.L.\n\n31, 42 U.S.C.S. §§ 1973gg et seq. (popularly known as the motor-voter law).   In\n\nintroducing the National Voter Registration Act, Congress stated its finding that\n\n\"discriminatory and unfair registration laws and procedures can have a direct and d\n\neffect on voter participation . . . and disproportionately harm voter participation\n\n\n     As a general matter, doing something twice is more difficult than doing it on\n     Registering to vote is no exception. Just because some black and Latino citi\n     have overcome obstacles to political participation and registered at some poi\n     the past, there is no reason to believe that they will be able to do so again\n     even if they continue to have the ability to register (with whatever assistan\n     may have received previously), the task of filing a registration form, in a p\n     and timely manner, remains. Quite simply, registering twice is harder, and w\n     occur less frequently, than registering once.\n\n     Moreover, re-registering after being purged is different, and will often be m\n     difficult, than registering to begin with, because individuals who register a\n     later purged might not even be aware that they have lost their ability to vot\n     Representative Collins made exactly this point during the motor-voter law deb\n     stating: \"[I]f you are busy, as most people are, with the day to day tasks of\n     raising a family and working or trying to find a job or whatever else, you mi\n     realize that you have missed the last election and have been removed from the\n     registration list until it is too late.\" 139 Cong. Rec. H517 (daily ed. Feb.\n     1993) (remarks of Rep. Collins). Once registered, would-be voters might also\n     reasonably believe that the City would not nullify their efforts. Indeed, as\n     authors of the only commentary on purge laws point out, \"Purging qualified vo\n     who have fulfilled registration requirements will likely increase their frust\n     and humiliation over continued obstacles to the franchise. Furthermore, it i\n     likely to deter voting by increasing alienation and apathy toward the politic\n     process and by intimidating qualified voters and creating a fear of encounter\n     election officials in the reinstatement process or at the polling place.\" Ba\n     supra p. 34, at 523.\n\n     For the majority, the fact that purged voters have registered before means th\n     statute could not have violated § 2. In my view, that fact only further\n     demonstrates and contributes to the statute's discriminatory effect.\n\n\n                                            48\n\fvarious groups, including racial minorities.\" 42 U.S.C.S. § 1973gg(a)(3).     In light\n\nthat finding, and with the stated objectives of promoting the exercise of the funda\n\nright to vote, protecting the integrity of the electoral process, and ensuring that\n\naccurate and current voter registration rolls are maintained, Congress enacted a la\n\ndesigned to increase registration rates by eliminating, to a significant extent, th\n\nfor citizens to make independent efforts to register to vote.   See 42 U.S.C.S. § 19\n\n(providing for simultaneous driver's license and registration application).    By\n\ndrastically reducing the need for people to complete and submit separate registrati\n\napplications, Congress hoped to \"expand[] the rolls of the eligible citizens who ar\n\nregistered\" and thus \"give the greatest number of people the opportunity to partici\n\nin federal elections.   H. Rep. No. 103-9, 103d Cong., 1st. Sess. 3 (1993), reprinte\n\n1993 U.S.C.C.A.N. 105, 107.   During the debates, supporters of the bill repeatedly\n\nexpressed the view that practical and procedural obstacles, and not a lack of desir\n\nparticipate, were primarily responsible for the unfortunate fact that roughly 70 mi\n\neligible voters in this country (about 40 percent of the voting-age population) had\nto register.   E.g., 139 Cong. Rec. H488 (daily ed. Feb. 4, 1993) (remarks of Rep. M\n\n(\"[T]here are 70 million eligible voters who are not registered because of the burd\n\nregistration policies and procedures which we have in this country.\"); id. at S2470\n\ned. Mar. 5, 1993) (remarks of Sen. Bradley) (stating that 40 percent of the voting-\n\npopulation cannot vote \"because obstacles are placed in the path of them registerin\n\nvote.\")   No legislator ever questioned the fact that the bill would substantially i\n\nregistration rates.   139 Cong. Rec. H517 (daily ed. Feb. 4, 1993) (remarks of Rep.\n(opposing the bill, but acknowledging that it would increase registration).

E.g., President's Remarks on Signing the National Vo\n\nRegistration Act of 1993, 29 Weekly Comp. Pres. Doc. 914, 915 (May 20, 1993) (\"The\n\nof Washington instituted a similar measure during the 1992 election, and their moto\n\nprogram registered in that state alone an additional 186,000 people.\"); 139 Cong.

We are supposed to\n\nformalistic views of what it means and what it takes to participate in political\n\nprocesses.    The district court and majority opinions suggest that registering and r\n\nregistering to vote is an easy thing to do.    The way they see it, anyone who wants\n\nregister certainly can.    If that were true, if the task of filling out and submitti\n\napplication to register did not represent a substantial obstacle to political\n\nparticipation, the National Voter Registration Act would not exist.    As Representat\nLewis put it: \"[F]or many Americans, it is not easy to register to vote.    It is\n\ndifficult.\"    139 Cong. Rec. H488 (daily ed. Feb. 4, 1993).   For that reason, Congre\n\n\"an effort to make democracy a little more real for all citizens of the United Stat\n\nId. at H490 (remarks of Rep.

It reads the district court's opinion to make \"an expli\n\nfinding of fact that Philadelphia's minority population has not had difficulty elec\n\nminority representatives.\"   Maj. Op. Typescript at 22.   That finding, the majority\n\nto argue, precludes the plaintiffs from prevailing on their § 2 claim.   The majorit\n\ncommitted two significant errors here.   First, the district court did not make the\n\nthe majority describes. Second, even if such a finding had been made, the majority\n\nmisinterpreted its legal significance.\n\n                                             A.\n\n1.   What the District Court Did and Did Not (and Could Not) Find\n\n          Again, according to the majority, the district court \"made an explicit fi\nthat Philadelphia's minority population has not had difficulty electing minority\n\nrepresentatives.\"   Id. (citing Ortiz, 824 F. Supp. at 539).   I disagree.   The secti\n\nthe district court opinion to which the majority refers is headed: \"The Extent to W\n\nAfrican-Americans and Latinos Have Been Elected to Public Office in Philadelphia.\"\n\n824 F. Supp. at 537.   The court's headings faithfully track the typically relevant\n\nlisted in the Senate Report, which include \"the extent to which members of the mino\n\ngroup have been elected to office in the jurisdiction.\"    Sen. Rep. at 29. According\ndistrict court considered, and ultimately rejected, the plaintiffs' contention that\n\n\n\n                                             51\n\f\"minority candidates have experienced considerable difficulty being elected to publ\n\noffice in Philadelphia.\"      Ortiz, 824 F. Supp. at 537.   In supporting this conclusio\n\ncourt specifically mentioned minority representation in the state legislature and o\n\nCity Council.   Id. at 538.    Thus, the district court's discussion, as its heading\n\nindicated, described the extent to which blacks and Latinos had been elected to off\n\nPhiladelphia.\n\n          Somewhere in this section of the district court's opinion, the majority f\n\n\"an explicit finding of fact that the City's minority population has not had diffic\n\nelecting minority representatives.\"      The district court, however, never made any fi\n\nregarding -- and in fact, never mentioned -- the difficulty minority voters might h\n\nexperienced in their efforts to elect candidates; instead, in keeping with the Sena\n\nReport's instructions, it considered the extent to which black and Latino candidate\n\nwon election to public office.      There is a substantial legal and factual difference\n\nbetween the difficulty experienced by minority candidates, which the district court\n\nconsidered, and the difficulty experienced by minority voters, which the district c\nneither considered nor addressed in a factual finding.0\n0\n      The majority's misreading of the district court's opinion is probably a resul\n      the following sentence: \"The Court concludes that plaintiffs have failed to\n      demonstrate that minority candidates experience difficulty electing represent\n      to office.\" Ortiz, 824 F. Supp. at 538 (emphasis added). Clearly, that stat\n      contains a mistake. The district court was not referring to a situation, suc\n      that following a plurality vote in the electoral college, in which (successfu\n      candidates for office are called upon to elect other representatives. There a\n      possible ways to make sense of the district court's misstatement: either the\n      meant to say \"voters\" instead of \"candidates\", or it meant to say \"getting el\n      to office\" instead of \"electing representatives to office.\" The first possib\n      while perhaps the one the majority would prefer, is not realistic. The distr\n      court's heading, its description and rejection of the plaintiffs' argument, i\n      reliance on the Senate Report, and the content of its discussion -- in which\n\n\n                                                52\n\f          If this were a vote dilution case, the plaintiffs would have had to satis\n\nGingles threshold factors, the third of which requires proof \"that the white majori\n\nvotes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it -- in the absence of special circumstance\n\n-- usually to defeat the minority's preferred candidate.\" Gingles, 478 U.S. at 51.\n\ncourse, this is not a vote dilution case, and I have already explained why the fact\n\nthat are most relevant in that context are of little if any relevance here. Supra p\n\n36.   Assuming, however, that the plaintiffs did need to make a showing regarding th\n\ndifficulty they have experienced in electing their preferred representatives -- and\n\ndiscuss below, I believe the majority has erred in apparently concluding that they\n\nneed to do so -- they could not rely, and a district court could not base a finding\n\nentirely on the win-loss records of minority candidates.   We have not lost sight of\n\nencouraging fact that Latino and black constituents can and sometimes do prefer whi\n\ncandidates, even in elections where a minority candidate is also running.0   So, as w\n\nexplained in Jenkins, \"[w]hile it may be tempting to assume that a minority candida\n\nalways the candidate of choice among minority voters, this is not always true.\"   Je\n4 F.3d at 1126; see generally id. at 1124-1131 (setting forth and applying the prop\n\nstandards for determining which candidates are preferred by § 2 plaintiffs).   The s\n\n\n\n      referred only to candidates who had been elected, and never to voter preferen\n      all point to the unmistakable conclusion that the court made a finding regard\n      difficulty minority candidates had experienced in their efforts to get electe\n      not the difficulty minority voters had experienced in their efforts to elect\n      candidates they supported.\n0\n      Conversely, and of at least equal promise, whites can and do vote for minorit\n      candidates. The record even reveals that such laudable events may occur, as\n      might hope, in the City of Brotherly Love; as the district court pointed out,\n      minority members of the Philadelphia City Council were elected in at-large co\n\n\n                                             53\n\fof black and Latino candidates, therefore, does not necessarily prove the success o\n\nand Latino voters.0\n\n          Contrary to the majority's assertion, the district court did not find tha\n\nminority voters had not experienced difficulty electing minority candidates; it mer\n\nconcluded that, at least as far as the plaintiffs could prove, minority candidates\n\nexperienced difficulty getting elected.0    We do not know which of those candidates w\n\nactually preferred by minority voters.     And even if the district court had found, a\n\nmajority claims, that minority voters experienced no difficulty electing candidates\n\n0\n      Section 2 plaintiffs bear the burden of establishing which candidates they ha\n      preferred. Jenkins, 4 F.3d at 1126. Minority voters are not entitled to an\n      unsupported assumption that the defeat of minority candidates, in and of itse\n      demonstrates the frustration of minority voting interests. In this case, bec\n      the district court never considered whether black and Latino citizens had suc\n      in electing representatives of their choice, we do not have any of the factua\n      information a court would need to determine which candidates were preferred b\n      minority constituents. For example, we do not know anything about the losing\n      candidates in elections where a black or Latino prevailed, nor do we have any\n      if statistical or even anecdotal evidence supports the permissible inference\n      minority voters in fact preferred any given minority representative. Again,\n      cases (unlike this one) where such a showing is necessary, the plaintiffs mus\n      it. Here, however, it is the majority that equates the success of minority\n      candidates with the success of minority voters. That assumption is not legall\n      factually sound.\n\n      I am aware of the district court's finding that, as a general matter, voting\n      Philadelphia is racially polarized. Ortiz, 824 F. Supp. at 532-33. That fin\n      however, is insufficient to support a conclusion that minority voters preferr\n      particular minority candidates. As we pointed out in Jenkins, this inquiry mu\n      conducted \"on an election-by-election basis.\" Jenkins, 4 F.3d at 1126.\n0\n      Putting aside the majority's misunderstanding of whose experience (candidates\n      voters') the district court was considering, it is worth noting that the cour\n      concluded that the plaintiffs had failed to prove that someone had experience\n      sort of political hardship. It did not, as the majority states, make an affir\n      finding that no one had done so. This second inaccuracy in the majority's ve\n      of the district court's finding may be more subtle, but it is not insignifica\n\n\n                                               54\n\ffinding could only have been based on the unsupported and legally erroneous assumpt\n\nthat blacks and Latinos always vote for blacks and Latinos.     Thus, such a finding c\n\nnot survive review.\n\n2.   The Unanswered Need to Consider Special Circumstances\n\n          Assuming that the plaintiffs' case did depend on an independent showing t\n\nthey have not been able to elect their preferred representatives (which it does not\n\nfurther assuming that minority voters always prefer minority candidates (which they\n\nnot), the district court's findings still would not defeat the plaintiffs' § 2 clai\n\nbecause the court never considered the kinds of \"special circumstances\" that might\n\nundermine the legal significance of the minority representation it cited.     Gingles\n\nmandates that in determining whether § 2 plaintiffs have usually been prevented fro\n\nelecting their preferred candidates, courts take into account \"special circumstance\n\nas the absence of an opponent, incumbency, or the utilization of bullet voting,\" wh\n\ncould explain the success of minority candidates even in the face of a districting\n\nthat unlawfully diluted the plaintiffs' vote.     Gingles, 478 U.S. at 57; see also Je\n4 F.3d at 1119 n.9 (\"consideration of special circumstances is specifically mandate\n\nwithin the definition of the third Gingles factor\").    As the Gingles Court took car\n\nmake clear, its \"list of special circumstances is illustrative, not exclusive.\"     Gi\n\n478 U.S. at 57 n.26.\n\n          The uncontroverted evidence presented at trial showed that of the seven b\n\nLatino representatives serving on the Philadelphia City Council, five were elected\n\n\"minority districts.\"   Ortiz, 824 F. Supp. at 537; id. at 538 (acknowledging that \"\nthe [minority] councilmembers represent wards that are highly populated by minority\n\n\n\n                                             55\n\fconstituents.\")    The record does not reflect whether minority state legislators hav\n\nbeen elected largely from districts in which black or Latino citizens constituted a\n\nmajority. Nor does it disclose whether other special circumstances, such as incumbe\n\nthe nature (or lack) of a candidate's opposition, might account for the success of\n\nminority candidates in some instances.\n\n          It seems obvious that the existence and effect of minority districts is t\n\nof special circumstance that courts must take into account in determining whether m\n\nvoters have experienced difficulty electing their candidates of choice.     Of course,\n\nvote dilution context, this consideration will never arise.   Vote dilution claims\n\ninvariably challenge districting schemes that do not provide minority voters with a\n\neffective voting majority.   A court could never learn anything about the occurrence\n\ndilution by looking to the results of elections in districts where majority-minorit\n\nconstituencies controlled the outcome.   Outside the vote dilution context, however,\n\ndemographic composition of a district must be taken into account in assessing the e\n\nof a challenged voting practice.   If a discriminatory law results in the\n\ndisenfranchisement of a disproportionate number of minority voters, but the remaini\nvoting members of the group still constitute an effective majority within a distric\n\nplainly, the success of a minority candidate elected from that district would have\n\nlegal significance.   That result would not provide any indication whatsoever that t\n\nchallenged law had not impaired the ability of minority voters to elect their chose\n\nrepresentatives.   Thus, the existence of majority-minority districts is the type of\n\nspecial circumstance that can explain, and thereby lessen or eliminate the signific\nof, the political success enjoyed by minority-preferred candidates.\n\n\n\n                                              56\n\f          Here, the district court never considered the existence or effect of spec\n\ncircumstances such as majority-minority districts.   The evidence presented at trial\n\nthe court described and at least partially credited in its opinion, would have supp\n\nfinding that these circumstances did exist.   In all likelihood, the district court\n\nhad any reason to conduct this sort of inquiry, because it was only considering the\n\nto which minority candidates had been elected to office; it was not making a findin\n\nregarding the difficulty minority voters had experienced in trying to elect\n\nrepresentatives, which is entirely consistent with its conclusion that the Gingles\n\npreconditions were \"peripheral issues bearing little relevance\" in this case.    Orti\n\nF. Supp. at 523.   However, if the district court had wanted to move from its findin\n\nminority representation on local and state governing bodies, to a conclusion that l\n\nsignificant minority political success disproved the plaintiffs' claim that their a\n\nto influence the outcome of elections had been impaired, it would have needed to co\n\nthe presence of special circumstances.   A failure to do so would constitute reversi\n\nlegal error.    Harvell v. Ladd, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"578724\"><a href=\"/opinion/578724/shirley-m-harvell-emmanuel-lofton-reverend-hattie-middlebrook-mary-alice/\"><span class=\"volume\">958</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">226</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 230 (8th Cir. 1992) (reversing for fai\nconsider special circumstances).   While the district court did not commit such erro\n\nbecause of the limited nature of its findings, the majority does.    It briefly descr\n\nthe electoral successes of black and Latino candidates, and concludes that those fa\n\nrefute the suggestion that the plaintiffs either have been denied fair access to th\n\npolitical process or have suffered an impairment of their ability to influence the\n\nof elections.   The majority fails to acknowledge the possibility that special\n\ncircumstances could have accounted for the results on which it relies, despite the\nuncontroverted evidence that such circumstances did, in fact, exist.    Of course, ap\n\n\n\n                                              57\n\fcourts are not competent to resolve this type of question on their own, but that is\n\nprecisely what the majority would have to do in order to avoid its apparent error.0\n\n                                             B.\n\n          Even if I accepted the majority's account of what the district court foun\n\nwould not agree with its apparent view of that finding's significance.\n\n          I confess that I am not entirely sure I understand the legal argument tha\n\nmajority advances in Part III.C of its opinion.   It at least strongly intimates, ho\n\nthat the plaintiffs' failure to prove that they have experienced difficulty electin\n\nrepresentatives, in and of itself, would preclude them from prevailing on a § 2 cla\n\nthus would provide an alternative ground for affirming the district court's decisio\n\nthat is the majority's position, and if the majority is right, then any voting prac\n\nthat prevented members of protected classes from participating in the political pro\n\nin whatever manner, to whatever extent, and for whatever reason -- would be permiss\n\nunder § 2, provided those groups could still eke out a reasonably fair share of ele\n\nvictories.   Thankfully, the Voting Rights Act allows no such thing.\n\n\n0\n      As a final point, by relying on Wilson Goode's mayoral victories in support o\n      position that minority voters have not had difficulty electing minority candi\n      the majority has adjusted or reinterpreted the district court's findings. Go\n      testified that he was the only black candidate, of the twelve who ran, to be\n      mayor during the past thirty years. Thus, when the district court found subs\n      minority representation in Philadelphia, it was in spite of Goode's success,\n      because of it. Ortiz, 824 F. Supp. at 538 (\"Although there has been one mino\n      mayor over the past several years, the city council . . . .\" (emphasis added)\n      majority's use of these findings is quite different. Instead of viewing Goode\n      mayoral victories, in their historical context, as facts that detract from bu\n      not defeat an argument that minority candidates have achieved substantial suc\n      Philadelphia elections, the majority cites Goode's victories as only supporti\n      position.\n\n\n                                             58\n\f          The majority's legal argument, one of the two sources of Part III.C's tro\n\nitself contains two errors.   First, and most importantly, the majority has misread\n\nSupreme Court's decision in Chisom v. Roemer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112629\"><a href=\"/opinion/112629/chisom-v-roemer/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">348</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1991).     Second, it h\n\nagain misconstrued § 2.\n\n          According to the majority, Chisom holds that \"Section 2 plaintiffs must\n\ndemonstrate that they had less opportunity both (1) to participate in the political\n\nprocess, and to elect representatives of their choice.\"     Maj. Op. Typescript at 21\n\n(emphasis added); see also Maj. Op. Typescript at 23 (referring to \"both elements o\n\nSection 2 claim\").   Its discussion in Part III.C seems to focus on the second of th\n\nrequirements; by pointing to the electoral successes enjoyed by Latino and black\n\ncandidates, the majority suggests that the plaintiffs failed to prove that their ab\n\nto influence the outcome of elections --or, in other words, their ability to elect\n\nrepresentatives of their choice -- has been impaired.     Maj. Op. Typescript at 22.0\n\nof this purported failure, the majority concludes, the plaintiffs have \"failed to s\n\nboth elements of a § 2 cause of action and, accordingly, [have] failed to establish\nbasis upon which [their] requested relief could be granted.\"     Maj. Op. Typescript a\n\n\n\n0\n     Part III.C does contain a brief reference to a district court \"finding of min\n     participation in the political process.\" Maj. Op. Typescript at 22 (citing Or\n     824 F. Supp. at 539). However, the \"finding\" the majority has in mind could\n     the district court's statement of its ultimate conclusion, where it simply ec\n     the language of § 2 in holding that no violation occurred. That \"finding\" (w\n     appears under the heading \"CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\") cannot support itself. In an\n     event, once again, the majority's argument only relies on the findings regard\n     electoral results. It is the success of minority candidates, it reasons, tha\n     demonstrates that minority voters have not been denied either fair access to\n     political process or an equal opportunity to influence the outcome of electio\n\n\n                                             59\n\f          In the part of Chisom on which the majority relies, the Supreme Court add\n\nthe position \"that § 2 provides two distinct types of protection for minority voter\n\nprotects their opportunity `to participate in the political process' and their oppo\n\nto elect representatives of their choice.'\" Chisom, 115 L.Ed.2d at 364.

The construction of § 2 the majority appears to adopt\n\nIII.C is similar but more demanding.

However, as the Chis\n\nCourt put it, § 2 cannot be compelled to undergo the \"radical surgery [that] would\n\nrequired to separate the opportunity to participate from the opportunity to elect.\"\n\n364.   \"The statute does not,\" the Court explained, \"create two separate and distinc\n\nrights.\"   Id. Rather: \"Any abridgement of the opportunity of members of a protected\n\nto participate in the political process inevitably impairs their ability to influen\n\noutcome of an election.\"   Id. (emphasis added).   As the Court had stated in White v\n\nRegister and Whitcomb v. Chavis, Chisom continues, \"the opportunity to participate\nopportunity to elect [are] inextricably linked.\"   Id. at 365 (emphasis added) (citi\n\nWhite, 412 U.S. at 766, and Whitcomb, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108364\"><a href=\"/opinion/108364/whitcomb-v-chavis/\"><span class=\"volume\">403</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">124</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 149 (1971)).\n\n           Thus, in Chisom, the Court clearly and repeatedly rejected the majority's\n\napparent view that § 2 plaintiffs must satisfy each of two distinct elements (lesse\n\nopportunity both to participate and to elect) in order to prevail.   Instead, if suc\n\nplaintiffs can prove that a voting law has abridged their opportunity to participat\n\nthe political process -- by, for example, removing them from the registration rolls\nthus effectively nullifying their franchise -- that law has also necessarily and\n\n\n\n                                             61\n\f\"inevitably\" impaired the plaintiffs' ability to influence the outcome of an electi\n\nSuch is the nature of the \"unitary claim\" Congress created.   Under this sensible an\n\nsupported construction of § 2, a voting practice is impermissible if it operates to\n\nthe members of a protected class of an equal opportunity to participate in the poli\n\nprocess -- even if the group has managed to overcome that disadvantage and to elect\n\nrepresentatives of its choice.0\n\n          The majority does not agree.   Again, looking exclusively to electoral res\n\nit concludes that the plaintiffs cannot prevail, because there is no evidence that\n\npurge law has denied them fair access to the political process or impaired their ab\n\nto influence the outcome of elections. Maj. Op. Typescript at 22.   This position co\n\nbased on one of several rationales, none of which are availing.   Perhaps the majori\n\ndisagrees with, or has overlooked, Chisom's use of words like \"inevitably\" and\n\n\"inextricably linked\", which describe the relationship between the abridgement of a\n\ngroup's opportunity to participate in the political process, on the one hand, and t\n\nimpairment of that group's ability to elect representatives, on the other.   Chisom,\nL.Ed.2d at 364.   The majority would apparently require the plaintiffs to produce ev\n\nof a connection that, at least according to Chisom, necessarily exists as a matter\n0\n      This is not the way Justice Scalia read the Court's opinion. In fact, Justic\n      Scalia criticized the Chisom majority for construing § 2 in such a way that m\n      of a minority group that was not large enough to control the outcome of elect\n      but who nonetheless had suffered an abridgement of their opportunity to parti\n      in the political process, would not be protected. Chisom, 115 L.Ed.2d at 372\n      (Scalia, J. dissenting). The Chisom majority, however, expressly rejected th\n      interpretation of its opinion. Id. at 365 n.24. Thus, regardless of whether\n      Justice Scalia's criticism had merit, not one member of the Court was willing\n      adopt a construction of § 2 under which a measure that operated to abridge a\n      opportunity to participate, but that did not itself prevent that group from e\n      representatives, would be permissible.\n\n\n                                             62\n\fand logic.   Alternatively, the majority might believe that by purging people from t\n\nregistration rolls, the City has not in any way lessened their opportunity to parti\n\nin the political process.   But I would hope we could agree about this much: when\n\nindividuals are purged, they cannot vote; if they cannot vote, their opportunity to\n\nparticipate is diminished; and, once again, according to the Supreme Court, if thei\n\nopportunity to participate is diminished, their ability to elect their preferred\n\nrepresentatives is necessarily, \"inevitably\" impaired. A final possibility remains.\n\nmajority might simply be restating, in a somewhat oblique way, its view that in ord\n\nestablish a violation of § 2, the plaintiffs would have had to establish that the p\n\nlaw itself operates to prevent Latinos and blacks from voting and that, therefore,\n\nis entirely responsible for its discriminatory effect.   If that is the majority's p\n\nhowever, then the argument advanced in Part III.C would not provide any additional\n\nfor its conclusion, and thus would not require a response.\n\n          In arguing that the plaintiffs' failure to prove difficulty electing\n\nrepresentatives defeats their claim, the majority not only misreads Chisom; it also\nagain, misreads § 2.   The district court, in contrast, recognized that the success\n\nand Latino candidates have had in winning public office is merely one factor among\n\nthat are relevant in a § 2 inquiry.   As § 2(b) quite plainly states: \"The extent to\n\nmembers of a protected class have been elected to office in the State or political\n\nsubdivision is one circumstance which may be considered.\"    42 U.S.C. § 1973(b) (emp\n\nadded).0 According to the majority's apparent view, however, that circumstance is so\n\n0\n      As I state above, supra p. 36, the extent to which minority voters have exper\n      difficulty electing candidates of their choice -- and thus relatedly, the ext\n      which minority candidates have won election to office -- is one relevant fact\n\n\n                                             63\n\fdispositive.   Maj. Op. Typescript at 22-23.   Congress disagrees.   Sen. Rep. at 29 n\n\n(rejecting the notion that a failure \"to establish any particular factor\" defeats a\n\nclaim).   The Supreme Court disagrees.   See Gingles, 478 U.S. at 45 (recognizing tha\n\nparticular number of factors need be proved, but that § 2 analysis instead depends\n\nsearching practical evaluation of past and present reality and on a functional view\n\npolitical process).   I disagree as well.\n\n                                               V.\n\n          Congress, in its continued efforts to ensure that the democratic processe\n\noccurring in this country will be equally open to members of racial and language\n\nminorities, has had the good sense to prohibit non-voting purges in federal electio\n\nlegislation it recently enacted to eliminate \"discriminatory and unfair registratio\n\ndoes not overlook laws such as the one the plaintiffs have challenged in this case.\n\nwhen the National Voter Registration Act becomes effective, Pennsylvania will no lo\n\nable to remove individuals from the registration rolls because of their failure to\n\nSee 42 U.S.C.S. § 1973gg-6(b)(2).0   As I stated at the outset, however, I am concern\n\n       among others, that a court can take into account in assessing the effect and\n       legality of a non-voting purge law. Political success could well encourage\n       participation, while repeated failure could lead to disillusionment, alienati\n       the belief that voting is pointless. Therefore, because this factor might in\n       minority participation rates, it is a relevant consideration in a challenge t\n       that disenfranchises those who fail to vote. The extent of a group's politic\n       success, however, while relevant, is not of central importance among the\n       circumstances that affect its members' inclination or ability to participate,\n       certainly not anything approaching a threshold or essential factor that § 2\n       plaintiffs must establish in order to successfully challenge a non-voting pur\n0\n  The statute provides:\n\n          Any State program or activity to protect the integrity of the\n          electoral process by ensuring the maintenance of an accurate and\n          current voter registration roll for elections for Federal office . . .\n\n                                               64\n\fthat today's decision will reach beyond its context and misdirect future efforts to\n\nproperly apply the Voting Rights Act.\n\n           The majority makes a valid and important observation: the law, in various\n\nhas indeed \"sought to raze any enduring bastions of state-administered voting\n\ndiscrimination.\"   Maj. Op. Typescript at 18-19.    We cannot discount the achievement\n\nseparates Philadelphia, Mississippi in 1964 from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1994\n\nHowever, the goal the majority describes, and in which it undoubtedly believes, has\n\nbeen attained. Even after Congress's most recent contribution to the cause of equal\n\npolitical opportunity, discrimination in voting remains.    A proper application of t\n\nVoting Rights Act in this case would have resulted in precisely the kind of additio\n\nprogress the Act was intended to bring about.\n\n           According to the majority, the right to vote, \"the very essence of democr\n\nsociety,\" has now been \"extended to every American citizen, without regard to race\n\n.\"   Maj. Op. Typescript at 18.   That accomplishment loses meaning, however, when\n\ndiscriminatory voting laws make the right to vote harder for some to exercise than\nWhen such discrimination occurs, I fear that today's decision will make it more dif\n\nfor us to respond in the way the law requires.
