Brewer appeals the\n\ndistrict court's grant of summary judgment in favor of his\n\nemployer, Quaker State Oil Refining Corporation and Quaker State\n\nCorporation (\"Quaker State\"), on Brewer's Age Discrimination in\n\nEmployment Act (\"ADEA\") claim, 29 U.S.C. § 623 (1988), and the\n\ndismissal of his pendent state-law claim brought under Michigan's\n\nanti-discrimination statute, the Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act,\n\nMich. Comp. Laws § 37.2101-2804.       Because the record reflects a\n\ngenuine issue of material fact regarding whether Quaker State's\n\nasserted nondiscriminatory reasons for discharging Brewer are\n\npretextual, we will reverse the district court's entry of summary\n\njudgment in favor of Quaker State and remand the matter for\n\nfurther proceedings.\n\n\n\n                                  I.\n\n          Brewer worked for Quaker State as a sales\n\nrepresentative from 1968 until the time of his discharge in March\n\n1992, at the age of fifty-three.       He worked in the Pittsburgh\n\noffice until it closed in 1989.       During the course of his\n\nemployment in Pittsburgh, Brewer was supervised by two different\n\ndivision managers, Bruce Drummond and Michael O'Donnell.         During\n\n\n                                  2\n\ftheir respective tenures, both Drummond and O'Donnell encountered\n\ncertain problems with Brewer's performance.    For example,\n\nDrummond stated that Brewer's clients complained that they had\n\nrun out of oil or had not seen their sales representative in some\n\ntime.   In January 1989, O'Donnell placed Brewer on a ninety-day\n\nprobation for similar performance deficiencies, including\n\ncustomer complaints about running out of oil, poor follow-up with\n\nprojects, inaccurate and incomplete paperwork, short work days,\n\nand lack of organization.    Shortly after Brewer completed his\n\nprobationary period, he was transferred to the Detroit division.\n\n           District Manager Paul Pfauser supervised Brewer in\n\nDetroit.   In 1990 Pfauser gave Brewer acceptable performance\n\nratings, but criticized him for poor planning.    Pfauser advised\n\nBrewer that he needed to work more closely with his client\n\naccounts and set higher standards for himself.    At the end of\n\n1990 Brewer received a sales bonus for exceeding the company's\n\nsales quota for that year.\n\n           In May 1991, shortly before his second annual review\n\nunder Pfauser's supervision, Pfauser notified Brewer that various\n\nfacets of his performance required improvement.    Pfauser\n\ncounseled Brewer to be more efficient, to follow-up with requests\n\nboth from his customers and from management, and to improve the\n\ntimeliness and completeness of his sales reports.    In his formal\n\nevaluation in June 1991, Brewer received marginal or unacceptable\n\nratings in all categories.\n\n           In August 1991, Brewer was placed on a ninety-day\n\nprobation for his performance deficiencies.    At that time,\n\n\n                                 3\n\fPfauser criticized Brewer for performing poorly in the areas of\n\nclient communications and organization.    In December 1991, Brewer\n\nagain exceeded the company's sales quota and received another\n\nbonus.    Brewer was the only salesperson in the Detroit region to\n\nreceive such a bonus for both 1990 and 1991.\n\n            Brewer's personnel file for the years prior to 1990 was\n\nlost.    However, it is not disputed that Brewer's mean performance\n\nevaluation rating from 1987 through 1990 was \"3\" out of a\n\npossible \"5\", which translates into \"competent\" by Quaker State's\n\nperformance standards.    Factoring in his evaluation for 1991,\n\nBrewer's overall average for 1987 to 1991 was 2.9.\n\n            At the end of the ninety-day probation, Pfauser\n\nrepeated his concerns that Brewer was spending too little time in\n\nhis territory and not adequately communicating with customers. At\n\nthis time Brewer's probationary period was extended for an\n\nadditional sixty days.    On February 18, 1992, Pfauser wrote a\n\nmemorandum to Brewer documenting performance problems, including\n\nBrewer's misprocessing orders, and failure to advise his accounts\n\nof credit problems.\n\n            Brewer challenged Pfauser's appraisal, commenting that\n\nhis performance had improved.    Brewer also has claimed that\n\nPfauser was \"nitpicking,\" and that the problems were the result\n\nof petty misunderstandings, or were not really problems at all.\n\nNonetheless, in the days that followed the February 18, 1992\n\nmemorandum, Pfauser sought and obtained approval to terminate\n\nBrewer's employment.    Brewer was discharged on March 9, 1992, and\n\n\n\n\n                                 4\n\fthis lawsuit ensued.    The district court granted summary judgment\n\nagainst Brewer.\n\n\n\n                                II.\n\n            We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291 to\n\nreview the final order of the district court, which exercised\n\njurisdiction under 29 U.S.C. § 626(c)(1), 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and\n\n1343(a)(4), and supplemental jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n\n§1367.\n\n            On review of a district court's grant of summary\n\njudgment, we apply the same test the district court should have\n\napplied initially.   Sempier v. Johnson & Higgins, 45 F.3d 724,\n\n727 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 115 S. Ct. 2611 (1995).   Summary\n\njudgment is appropriate only when the admissible evidence fails\n\nto demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact and the moving\n\nparty is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.   Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 56(c).    When the nonmoving party bears the burden of\n\npersuasion at trial, the moving party may meet its burden on\n\nsummary judgment by showing that the nonmoving party's evidence\n\nis insufficient to carry its burden of persuasion at trial.\n\nCelotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S. Ct. 2548,\n2552-53 (1986).    Thereafter, the nonmoving party creates a\n\ngenuine issue of material fact if it provides sufficient evidence\n\nto allow a reasonable jury to find for him at trial.    Anderson v.\n\nLiberty Lobby Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 2510\n\n(1986).   In reviewing the record, the court must give the\n\nnonmoving party the benefit of all reasonable inferences.\n\n\n                                 5\n\fSempier, 45 F.3d at 727; Colgan v. Fisher Scientific Co., 935\n\nF.2d 1407, 1413 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 941 (1991).\n\n\n\n                               III.\n\n          The ADEA prohibits age discrimination in employment\n\nagainst any person over age forty.    29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(1).\n\nBecause the prohibition against age discrimination contained in\n\nthe ADEA is similar in text, tone, and purpose to that contained\n\nin Title VII, courts routinely look to law developed under Title\n\nVII to guide an inquiry under ADEA.    See, e.g., Maxfield v.\n\nSinclair Int'l, 766 F.2d 788, 791 (3d Cir. 1985), cert. denied,\n\n474 U.S. 1057 (1986).   We follow the evidentiary framework first\n\nset forth by the Supreme Court in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v.\n\nGreen, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817 (1973), subsequently refined\n\nin Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S.\n\n248, 101 S. Ct. 1089 (1981), and recently clarified in St. Mary's\n\nHonor Center v. Hicks, __ U.S. __, 113 S. Ct. 2742 (1993).\n\n          In order to establish a prima facie case, Brewer must\n\nshow that he: (1) is over 40; (2) is qualified for the position\n\nin question; (3) suffered an adverse employment decision; and (4)\n\nwas replaced by a sufficiently younger person to permit an\n\ninference of age discrimination.     Sempier v. Johnson & Higgins,\n45 F.3d 724, 727 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 115 S. Ct. 2611 (1995).\n\nThis showing creates a presumption of age discrimination that the\n\nemployer can rebut by stating a legitimate nondiscriminatory\n\nreason for the adverse employment decision.     Hicks, __ U.S. at\n__, 113 S. Ct. at 2747; Sempier, 45 F.3d at 728.    The plaintiff\n\n\n                                6\n\fthen has the opportunity to demonstrate that the employer's\n\nstated reason was not its true reason, but merely a pretext for\n\ndiscrimination.    Hicks, __ U.S. __, 113 S.Ct. at 2747; Sempier,\n\n45 F.3d at 728.\n\n\n\n                                  A.\n\n             The district court held that the disposition of this\n\ncase turned on the third stage of the McDonnell Douglas\n\nanalytical framework because Brewer had established a prima facie\n\ncase of age discrimination, and Quaker State had articulated non-\n\ndiscriminatory reasons for Brewer's discharge.     Brewer v. Quaker\n\nState Oil Ref. Corp., 874 F. Supp. 672, 681-82 (W.D. Pa. 1995).\n\nWe agree with the district court's analysis up to this point.       It\n\nis undisputed that Brewer is a member of a protected class, was\n\ndischarged by Quaker State, and was replaced by an individual not\n\nwithin the protected class.    Moreover, Brewer was qualified for\n\nthe position of sales representative.    He worked as a Quaker\n\nState sales representative for twenty-three years.     During his\n\nlast five years on the job, he received overall evaluations that\n\ntranslated into \"competent\" by Quaker State's performance\n\nstandards.    Accordingly, Brewer has established a prima facie\ncase of age discrimination.\n\n             Quaker State has also established legitimate, non-\n\ndiscriminatory reasons for terminating Brewer's employment.\n\nPfauser documented continuous performance problems, including\n\npoor follow-up on customer requests, poor communications with\n\n\n\n\n                                  7\n\fclients and with management, too little time spent in his\n\nterritory, and late and ambiguous sales reports.\n\n\n\n                                B.\n\n          We must next determine whether Brewer has met his\n\nburden of demonstrating that a factfinder could find that the\n\nallegedly legitimate reasons proffered for his discharge were\n\nonly a pretext for discrimination in order to survive Quaker\n\nState's motion for summary judgment.   To defeat a summary\n\njudgment motion based on a defendant's proffer of\n\nnondiscriminatory reasons, a plaintiff who has made a prima facie\n\nshowing of discrimination need point to some evidence, direct or\n\ncircumstantial, from which a factfinder could reasonably either:\n\n(1) disbelieve the employer's articulated legitimate reason; or\n\n(2) believe that an invidious discriminatory reason was more\n\nlikely than not a motivating or determinative cause of the\n\nemployer's action.   Fuentes v. Perskie, 32 F.3d 759, 763-64 (3d\n\nCir. 1994).   The factfinder may infer from the combination of the\n\nplaintiff's prima facie case, as well as its own rejection of the\n\nemployer's proffered nondiscriminatory reason, that the employer\n\nunlawfully discriminated against the plaintiff and was merely\n\ntrying to conceal its illegal act with the articulated reason.\n\nSee Hicks, __ U.S. at __, 113 S. Ct. at 2749.   Thus, if the\n\nplaintiff has pointed to evidence sufficient to discredit the\n\ndefendant's proffered reason, to survive summary judgment the\n\nplaintiff need not also come forward with additional evidence of\n\n\n\n\n                                8\n\fdiscrimination beyond his or her prima facie case.   Fuentes, 32\n\nF.3d at 764.\n\n          To discredit the employer's proffered reason, the\n\nplaintiff cannot simply show that the employer's decision was\n\nwrong or mistaken, since the factual dispute at issue is whether\n\na discriminatory animus motivated the employer, not whether the\n\nemployer is \"wise, shrewd, prudent, or competent.\"   Fuentes, 32\n\nF.2d at 765 (citing Ezold v. Wolf, Block, Schorr & Solis-Cohen,\n\n983 F.2d 509, 533 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, __ U.S. __, 114 S. Ct.\n\n88 (1993)).    Rather, the nonmoving plaintiff must demonstrate\n\nsuch \"weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies,\n\nincoherences, or contradictions in the employer's proffered\n\nlegitimate reason for its action that a reasonable factfinder\n\ncould rationally find them unworthy of credence, and hence infer\n\nthat the employer did not act for [the asserted] non-\n\ndiscriminatory reasons.\"   Fuentes, 32 F.3d at 765 (citations and\n\ninternal quotations omitted.). See Ezold, 983 F.2d at 527\n\n(\"plaintiff has the burden of casting doubt on an employer's\n\narticulated reasons for an employment decision\")(quoting Billet\nv. Cigna Corp., 940 F.2d 812, 828 (3d Cir. 1991).\n\n          Brewer has challenged Quaker State's asserted reasons\n\nfor his discharge.    First, Brewer's own testimony disputed the\n\nsignificance of the problems raised by Pfauser.    While Brewer\n\nchallenged the extent and degree of his deficiencies rather than\n\ntheir existence, Brewer testified to specific examples of\n\nPfauser's errant or misplaced criticisms.    Such evidence amounts\n\nto more than his subjective opinion of his performance.    Second,\n\n\n                                 9\n\fBrewer provided evidence that he had succeeded in selling oil for\n\nnearly twenty-five years in the employ of Quaker State, and for\n\nthe last five years, he was rated \"fully acceptable\" by Quaker\n\nState in his evaluations.     Third, Brewer provided evidence that\n\nhe received a bonus for surpassing his sales quota in 1990 and\n\n1991, and was the only salesperson in the Detroit region to\n\nexceed his or her sales quota for those years.\n\n             The district court discounted this evidence, reasoning\n\nthat Brewer cannot pick and choose which employment standard he\n\nwill meet.    The district court reasoned that \"although\n\nplaintiff's average numerical rating and sales bonus may be\n\nsomewhat contradictory with the fact of his termination, the\n\ncourt does not believe that they give rise to such 'weaknesses,\n\nimplausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherences, or\n\ncontradictions' in Quaker State's explanation that a reasonable\n\nfactfinder could rationally find the explanation unworthy of\n\ncredence.\"    Brewer, 874 F. Supp. at 682.   We disagree that the\n\n\"somewhat contradictory\" evidence does not demonstrate a triable\n\nissue of fact.     On summary judgment, it is not the court's role\n\nto weigh the disputed evidence and decide which is more\n\nprobative.    Sempier, 45 F.3d at 731.   The fact that Brewer\n\nreceived a bonus three months before he was fired and was the\n\nonly sales representative in the Detroit region who received such\n\na bonus is contradictory to Quaker State's admission that the\n\nmost important standard of job performance is sales.\n\n             Quaker State's Executive Vice President of Sales,\n\nWilliam Marshall, stated that sales volume is \"extremely\n\n\n                                  10\n\fimportant in evaluating a salesperson,\" and represents \"the best\n\nsimple measure\" of a salesperson's performance.   App. at 200,\n\n203.   Quaker State's counsel also acknowledged this fact at oral\n\nargument before this court.    Indeed, the volume of sales may\n\nalways be the primary measure of a salesperson's performance. See\n\nKiliszewski v. Overnite Transp. Co., 818 F. Supp. 128, 132 (W.D.\n\nPa. 1993) (evidence that a person performed well in the\n\ntraditional role of salesperson precluded summary judgment\n\ndespite employer's claim that the plaintiff suffered from\n\nefficient time-management deficiencies).    To segregate job\n\nperformance into the neat categories of sales and organizational\n\nskills defies the reality of the role of a salesperson in a\n\ncompany.\n\n           We recognized that an employer may have any reason or\n\nno reason for discharging an employee so long as it is not a\n\ndiscriminatory reason.\n          [W]e do not sit as a super-personnel department that\n          reexamines an entity's business decisions. No matter\n          how medieval a firm's practices, no matter how high-\n          handed its decisional process, no matter how mistaken\n          the firm's managers, the ADEA does not interfere.\n          Rather, our inquiry is limited to whether the employer\n          gave an honest explanation of its behavior.\n\n\nMcCoy v. WGN Continental Broadcasting Co., 957 F.2d 368, 373 (7th\nCir. 1992) (citations and internal quotations omitted).    An\n\nemployer may have a legitimate reason for firing an employee that\n\nhas nothing to do with that employee's performance of the core\n\nfunctions of his or her job.    Nonetheless, our role is to\n\ndetermine whether a factfinder could reasonably find that the\n\n\n\n                                 11\n\femployer's stated reason is unworthy of credence.     In this case,\n\nBrewer's deficiencies pale beside his consistently good sales\n\nperformance, inexplicably unaccounted for in his supervisor's\n\nnegative evaluations.    A factfinder could find it implausible\n\nthat Quaker State would have fired Brewer for such deficiencies\n\nwhen he was successful in the sole area identified by Quaker\n\nState's own performance incentive program -- sales.\n\n            In Ezold, 983 F.2d at 509, we held that a district\n\ncourt had erred in finding that the employer's explanation for\n\ndenying a promotion to the plaintiff was pretextual.     The\n\nemployer claimed that it had denied partnership to the plaintiff\n\nbecause of her deficiencies in the area of legal analysis.       There\n\nwas no question that the plaintiff suffered from serious\n\nshortfalls in that area, although she had demonstrated success in\n\nother areas of the job.     It was also clear that the employer\n\nconsidered legal analysis to be the critical category of\n\nperformance review.     The district court had questioned the wisdom\n\nof the employer's partnership standards, and we held that \"[i]t\n\nwas not for the district court to determine that Ezold's skills\n\nin areas other than legal analysis made her sufficiently\n\nqualified for admission to the partnership.\"    Id. at 528.      This\n\ncase is distinguishable on its facts.    In Ezold, the plaintiff\n\nsuffered deficiencies in the one area deemed critical by the\n\nemployer.   Here, in contrast, Brewer had some problems in a few\n\naspects of the job.     Yet, he performed well in the one area\n\ndeemed by Quaker State to merit a performance bonus.     This raises\n\n\n\n\n                                  12\n\fgenuine issues about the credence of Quaker State's performance-\n\nbased explanation.\n\n          It is also questionable why a company would fire the\n\nonly salesperson to receive consecutive annual bonuses in\n\nresponse to the same organizational deficiencies that the\n\nemployer had tacitly accepted for over two decades.   During the\n\ntwenty-three years that Brewer worked for Quaker State, he\n\nconsistently sold a high volume of oil despite the repeated\n\ncriticisms of other aspects of his job performance.   It was not\n\nuntil late in his career that Quaker State turned the criticisms\n\nof Brewer's performance into the basis for adverse action.     A\n\nreasonable factfinder could view Quaker State's belated reliance\n\non these criticisms as evidence that tends to show pretext.    See\n\nLevin v. Analysis & Technology, Inc., 960 F.2d 314, 317 (2d Cir.\n\n1992) (employer's claim that plaintiff was terminated because of\n\nhis \"poor attitude\" did not provide a basis for summary judgment\n\nwhere there was evidence that plaintiffs' \"irascible nature had\n\nfor many years been accepted by his co-workers and superiors\");\n\nGiacoletto v. Amax Zinc Co., 954 F.2d 424, 426-27 (7th Cir. 1992)\n\n(evidence supported a finding of pretext despite employer's claim\n\nthat the plaintiff had \"poor interpersonal skills as a manager\"\n\nwhere the plaintiff \"had been kept on as a supervisor for 14\n\nyears despite his abrasive personality and because of his ability\n\nto produce\"); Blalock v. Metals Trades, Inc., 775 F.2d 703, 709\n(6th Cir. 1985) (fact that the employer had legitimate concerns\n\nwith the plaintiff's performance at the time of his discharge was\n\nnot determinative where that \"same level of performance\" had been\n\n\n                               13\n\facceptable to the employer until its consideration of a protected\n\ncriterion).   Brewer's testimony disputing the significance of the\n\nalleged problems, his twenty-three years of consistently good\n\nsales performance and recent merit bonuses cast sufficient doubt\n\non Quaker State's contention that Brewer was discharged because\n\nof poor job performance in areas which the company had long\n\noverlooked or tolerated.0\n\n          Brewer has also provided evidence that in August of\n\n1991, Wanda Weaver, Quaker State's personnel manager, wrote a\n\nmemorandum to Pfauser summarizing Brewer's performance for the\n\nlast fifteen years.    In the memorandum Weaver noted that \"Judd is\n\n53 years old, which presents another problem.\"   App. at 24.   The\n\ndistrict court determined that this statement merely indicated\n\nWeaver's awareness that, if terminated, Brewer may file an age\n\ndiscrimination suit.   Although the jury may very well conclude\n\nthat this remark merely reflects an awareness of Quaker State's\n\nlegal obligations, the statement is also subject to competing\n\ninterpretations.   Another reasonable interpretation is that\n\nBrewer's age was a \"problem\" for Quaker State.   On summary\n\n0\nThe dissent states that Brewer has \"done nothing to rebut\"\nQuaker State's proffered non-sales reasons for firing him.\nDissent Typescript at 5. The dissent has overlooked evidence of\nBrewer's testimony in which he related specific examples of his\nsupervisor's errant or misplaced criticisms. Such evidence\namounts to more than his subjective opinion of his job\nperformance. Of course, unrefuted evidence was also presented\nthat Brewer's past performance for twenty years was identical to\nthat for which he was fired. It was not until late in his career\nthat the criticisms of Brewer's performance were turned into\nreasons for his termination. This evidence goes directly to\ndiscrediting Quaker State's non-sales related reasons for firing\nBrewer.\n\n                                 14\n\fjudgment, we must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the\n\nnonmoving party.   Drawing the inference in Brewer's favor,\n\nWeaver's statement tends to show a discriminatory animus.     In\n\nviewing the record as a whole, as we must, we conclude that the\n\nstatement is probative, and should be submitted for a jury's\n\nconsideration.\n\n          Brewer next produced evidence that in March 1990, Jack\n\nCorn, Chief Executive Officer of Quaker State, discussed two new\n\nexecutives in the company newsletter.    He stated, \"two of our\n\nstar young men in their mid-40s.     That age group is our future.\"\n\nApp. at 26-27.   Brewer asserts that this remark is circumstantial\n\nevidence of Quaker State's preference for younger workers.      The\n\ndistrict court determined that Corn's statement was a \"stray\n\nremark, unconnected with and remote from the decision-making\n\nprocess which resulted in Brewer's discharge.\"    Brewer, 874 F.\n\nSupp. at 683.\n\n          We have held that stray remarks by non-decisionmakers\n\nor by decisionmakers unrelated to the decision process are rarely\n\ngiven great weight, particularly if they were made temporally\n\nremote from the date of the decision. Ezold, 983 F.2d at 545.         We\n\nagree with the district court that the Corn statement is a \"stray\n\nremark\" made by a non-decisionmaker and temporally remote from\n\nthe decision to terminate Brewer.    The comment was made almost\n\ntwo years before Brewer's March 1992 termination.    Brewer's\n\nsupervisor testified that he could not recall ever seeing or\n\nhearing Corn's statement, and there is no evidence of a causal\n\nlink between Corn's statement and Brewer's termination.\n\n\n                                15\n\f           Though the Corn statement should not be given\n\nsignificant or commanding weight, at trial, it may provide some\n\nrelevant evidence of discrimination.   We have held that a\n\nsupervisor's statement about the employer's employment practices\n\nor managerial policy is relevant to show the corporate culture in\n\nwhich a company makes its employment decision, and may be used to\n\nbuild a circumstantial case of discrimination.   See Abrams v.\n\nLightolier, Inc., 50 F.3d 1204, 1214 (3d Cir. 1995)\n\n(discriminatory statements by nondecisionmakers properly used to\n\nbuild a circumstantial case of discrimination); Lockhart v.\n\nWestinghouse Credit Corp., 879 F.2d 43, 54 (3d Cir. 1989) (same);\n\nsee also Josey v. John R. Hollingsworth Corp., 996 F.2d 632, 641\n\n(3d Cir. 1993) (court may consider as circumstantial evidence the\n\natmosphere in which the company made its employment decisions).\n\n           Corn's statement may be used as evidence of managerial\n\npolicy.   The remark was not an off-hand comment made by a low-\n\nlevel supervisor.   Rather, the comment was made by the Chief\n\nExecutive Officer in a written newsletter.   \"When a major company\n\nexecutive speaks, 'everybody listens' in the corporate hierarchy,\n\nand when the executive's comments prove to be disadvantageous to\n\na company's subsequent litigation posture, it cannot\n\ncompartmentalize this executive as if he had nothing more to do\n\nwith company policy than the janitor or watchman.\"    Lockhart, 879\nF.2d at 54.\n\n           Quaker State claims that Corn's statement should not be\n\nconsidered evidence at all because it is too innocuous.      The\n\nstatement that the mid-40's age group is the company's future may\n\n\n                                16\n\findeed be considered a truism -- the future of any business lies\n\nwith its relatively young employees.    See, e.g., Smith v. Flax,\n\n618 F.2d 1062, 1066 (4th Cir. 1980) (statement that \"future lay\n\nin the employer's young Ph.D's\" was a truism, and not evidence of\n\nage discrimination.).   Quaker State further asserts that praising\n\nthe youth does not indicate bias against more mature workers.\n\nSee, e.g., Mesnick v. General Elec. Co., 950 F.2d 816, 826 (1st\n\nCir. 1991). cert. denied, 504 U.S. 985 (1992).    While a\n\nfactfinder could find Corn's comment too abstract to evince age\n\ndiscrimination, it may also be considered by the jury as evidence\n\nof the corporate culture in which the employment decision to\n\ndischarge Brewer was made, and circumstantial evidence of age\n\ndiscrimination.   We conclude that the Corn statement is relevant\n\nevidence of age discrimination.\n\n\n\n                                  IV.\n\n          Brewer next argues that the district court erred in\n\nrefusing to draw an adverse inference from Quaker State's\n\ninability to produce Brewer's pre-1990 personnel file.      The\n\ngeneral principles concerning the inferences to be drawn from the\n\nloss or destruction of documents are well established.      When the\n\ncontents of a document are relevant to an issue in a case, the\n\ntrier of fact generally may receive the fact of the document's\n\nnonproduction or destruction as evidence that the party that has\n\nprevented production did so out of the well-founded fear that the\n\ncontents would harm him.   Gumbs v. International Harvester, Inc.,\n\n\n\n\n                                  17\n\f718 F.2d 88, 96 (3d Cir. 1983); United States v. Charkasky Meat\n\nCo., 259 F.2d 89 (3d Cir. 1958).\n\n             For the rule to apply, it is essential that the\n\nevidence in question be within the party's control. Gumbs, 718\n\nF.2d at 96.    Further, it must appear that there has been an\n\nactual suppression or withholding of the evidence.     No\n\nunfavorable inference arises when the circumstances indicate that\n\nthe document or article in question has been lost or accidentally\n\ndestroyed, or where the failure to produce it is otherwise\n\nproperly accounted for.     See generally 31A C.J.S. Evidence\n\n§156(2); 29 Am. Jur. 2d Evidence § 177 (\"Such a presumption or\n\ninference arises, however, only when the spoilation or\n\ndestruction [of evidence] was intentional, and indicates fraud\n\nand a desire to suppress the truth, and it does not arise where\n\nthe destruction was a matter of routine with no fraudulent\n\nintent.\").\n\n            The district court found that the file was lost in\n\nconnection with the death of Quaker State's in-house attorney,\n\nand was not destroyed intentionally.    Quaker State's in-house\n\nattorney died of a terminal illness after he took possession of\n\nthe file.    Quaker State avers that it has continued to search for\n\nthe file, but to no avail.    We cannot say the district court\n\napplied the incorrect legal standard, nor were its factual\n\nfindings clearly erroneous.    The destruction or failure to\n\nproduce the record could have been due to many reasons unrelated\n\nto the lawsuit.    See, e.g., Rogers v. Exxon Research & Eng'g Co.,\n550 F.2d 834, 843 (3d Cir. 1977) (refusing to draw an adverse\n\n\n                                  18\n\finference where destruction of a diary could have been unrelated\n\nto the lawsuit), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1022 (1978).     The\n\ndistrict court properly refused to draw an adverse inference.\n\n\n\n                                 V.\n\n           Brewer has also brought an age discrimination claim\n\nunder the Michigan Civil Rights Act, Mich. Comp. Laws § 37.2101-\n\n2804.    The district court held that Brewer failed to establish a\n\nprima facie case on his state law claim because he provided no\n\nevidence that Pfauser, or any other decisionmaker at Quaker\n\nState, was predisposed to discriminate against Brewer on the\n\nbasis of age.   Brewer, 874 F. Supp. at 687.\n\n           The evidentiary burdens for proceeding on an age\n\ndiscrimination claim under the Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act\n\nare the same as those used in ADEA cases.      McDonald v. Union Camp\n\nCorp., 898 F.2d 1155, 1159 (6th Cir. 1990).     However, in contrast\n\nto federal law, under Michigan law a plaintiff may establish a\n\nprima facie case by demonstrating that: (1) he is a member of the\n\naffected class; (2) that some adverse employment action was taken\n\nagainst him; (3) that the person responsible for this adverse\n\naction was predisposed to discriminate against persons in the\n\naffected class; and (4) that the person responsible actually\n\nacted on this predisposition to plaintiff's detriment.     Pitts v.\nMichael Miller Car Rental, 942 F.2d 1067, 1070 n.1 (6th Cir.\n\n1991).\n\n           A plaintiff may also establish a prima facie case under\nMichigan law using the traditional federal law standard set forth\n\n\n                                 19\n\fin McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802, 93 S. Ct. at 1824.0      The\n\nMcDonnell Douglas standard has been adopted by the Michigan\n\nSupreme Court.   McDonald v. Union Camp Corp., 898 F.2d 1155,\n\n1159-60 (6th Cir. 1990); Matras v. Amoco Oil Co., 385 N.W.2d 586,\n\n590 (Mich. 1986).   Therefore, Michigan law provides that\n\nestablishing a prima facie case of age discrimination varies with\n\ndiffering factual situations, and the standard that best fits the\n\nfactual allegations should be applied.   Matras, 385 N.W.2d at\n\n590; Lytle v. Malady, 530 N.W.2d 135, 140 (Mich. Ct. App. 1995).\n\n          The district court erred in applying only the prima\n\nfacie standard set forth in Pitts, 942 F.2d at 1070, and not the\n\nMcDonnell Douglas standard, which more closely fits the facts of\n\nthis case.    Accordingly, the district court's entry of summary\n\njudgment on the state law claim will be reversed for the same\n\nreasons that we will reverse the summary judgment entered on the\n\nADEA claim.\n\n\n\n\n0\nA prima facie case as applied in the age discrimination context\nrequires a showing that the plaintiff: (1) was a member of a\nprotected class; (2) was subjected to adverse employment action;\n(3) was qualified for the position; and (4) was replaced by a\nyounger person.\n\n\n                                20\n\f                      BREWER v. QUAKER STATE\n\n                              No. 95-3101\n\n\n\n\nROTH, Circuit Judge, Dissenting:       I respectfully dissent.    I\n\ncannot agree that Brewer's evidence of his sales performance\n\nrebuts Quaker State's litany of specific reasons for termination\n\nsufficiently to raise a genuine issue of material fact.      I would\n\naffirm the district court.0\n\n          Unlike the majority, I believe that the district court\n\nanalyzed the case properly and reached a correct result.         In\n\nparticular, I disagree with the majority's rebuke that the\n\ndistrict court weighed disputed evidence.      See Majority at\n\n[typescript at 10].   I conclude that the district court, in\n\ngranting summary judgment, properly focussed on Quaker State's\n\narticulated reasons for termination and determined that these\n\nreasons were an adequate, non-discriminatory basis for discharge\n\neven when considered along with Brewer's acknowledged sales\n\nrecord.\n\n          Our summary judgment inquiry comes flows from the\n\nSupreme Court's decision in Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S.\n\n\n\n\n0\n          I have little quarrel with Parts I, II, III.A, or IV of\nthe majority's opinion. I disagree with Part III.B, and I would\nnot reach Part V. Because I would affirm the district court's\ngrant of summary judgment for Quaker State on the federal claim,\nI would remand the state claims to the district court to\ndetermine whether jurisdiction should be retained pursuant to 28\nU.S.C. § 1367(c)(3).\n\n\n                                  21\n\f317 (1986), which applies equally to McDonnell Douglas\n\ndiscrimination cases.    See Healy v. New York Life Ins. Co., 860\n\nF.2d 1209, 1219 n.3 (3d Cir. 1988), cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1098\n\n(1989).    Under Celotex, the district court must evaluate the\n\nnonmovant plaintiff's evidentiary showing to determine whether\n\nthe showing raises a genuine issue of material fact.     This\n\ncourt's past discussions of the degree of proof required to\n\nsurvive summary judgment in McDonnell Douglas cases have\n\nrecognized the need for this type of evidentiary evaluation.\n\nFuentes v. Perskie provides our most extensive treatment of the\n\nsubject.    32 F.3d 759 (3d Cir. 1994).   \"[T]o avoid summary\n\njudgment, the plaintiff's evidence . . . must allow a factfinder\n\nreasonably to infer that each of the employer's proffered\n\nnondiscriminatory reasons was either a post hoc fabrication or\n\notherwise did not actually motivate the employment action (that\n\nis, the proffered reason is a pretext).\"    Id. at 764 (citations\n\nomitted) (first emphasis added); see Sempier v. Johnson &\n\nHiggins, 45 F.3d 724, 728 (3d Cir.) (adopting implicitly the\n\n\"reasonable inference\" standard), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 115\n\nS. Ct. 2611 (1995); accord Siegel v. Alpha Wire Corp., 894 F.2d\n50, 53 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 496 U.S. 906 (1990); Sorba v.\n\nPennsylvania Drilling Co., 821 F.2d 200, 205 (3d Cir. 1987),\n\ncert. denied, 484 U.S. 1019 (1988).\n\n           In Fuentes, we observed that \"this standard places a\n\ndifficult burden on the plaintiff.\"    32 F.3d at 765.   It requires\n\nthe plaintiff to \"present sufficient evidence to meaningfully\nthrow into question, i.e., to cast substantial doubt upon, the .\n\n\n                                 22\n\f. . proffered reasons[.]\"    Id. (emphasis added).   Elsewhere, we\n\nhave described the standard in similar terms.    See Seman v.\n\nCoplay Cement Co., 26 F.3d 428, 431 (3d Cir. 1994) (\"our standard\n\nrequires consideration of whether or not there is substantial\n\nevidence in the record to support an employee's contention that\n\n'but for' his age he would not have been discharged\" (citing\n\nBillet v. CIGNA Corp., 940 F.2d 812, 815 (3d Cir. 1991)).\n\n             In the present case, Brewer did not cast doubt on\n\nQuaker State's proferred reasons, i.e., he did not allege that\n\nthey were not true.     He contended instead that they were\n\ninadequate for discharge because he was a good salesman.\n\n             I cannot agree that Brewer's evidence meets the\n\nMcDonald Douglas summary judgment standard.    His general\n\nperformance evidence, considered in connection with Quaker\n\nState's specific reasons for discharge, is insufficient to raise\n\na genuine issue of material fact; the inferences he draws from\n\nhis remaining evidence are unreasonable.\n\n             The majority opinion provides a fair summation of the\n\nfacts of this case.    Brewer was fired following a series of\n\nsignificant performance problems, such as letting his customers\n\nrun out of oil and failing to complete or even file his\n\npaperwork.    To demonstrate that these reasons were pretextual and\n\nthat the real reason for his firing was age discrimination,\n\nBrewer offered three principal pieces of evidence:     first,\n\ngeneral performance evidence such as positive comments on\n\npersonnel evaluations and a sales bonus for selling oil in the\n\ntwo years prior to termination; second, a personnel memorandum\n\n\n                                  3\n\fwritten by Wanda Weaver, Quaker State's Manager of Employment and\n\nCompensation, and sent to Pfauser, Brewer's supervisor at the\n\ntime, which summarized Brewer's personnel evaluations since 1975,\n\napproved a \"performance plan\" that Pfauser had submitted, and\n\nobserved, \"[a]lso, Judd is 53 years old, which presents another\n\nproblem\"; and third, a comment by Jack Corn, then chief executive\n\nofficer of the company, in the company newspaper referring to two\n\nof his new \"seconds-in command\" as \"two of our star young men in\n\ntheir mid-40s . . . [t]hat age group is our future . . ..\"\n\n          For clarity, I will analyze each of Brewer's\n\nevidentiary proffers independently.     Brewer's general evidence of\n\nacceptable job performance forms the nub of the case.     The Weaver\n\nmemorandum and the Corn comment are far weaker and, I believe,\n\ninsufficient to stave off summary judgment absent Brewer's\n\nevaluations and sales bonus.\n\n          Quaker State alleges that it fired Brewer for a litany\n\nof specific performance problems.      Brewer responds with generic\n\nevidence of his generally successful performance as a salesman.\n\nThe majority believes that Brewer's showing reveals sufficient\n\n\"weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherences, or\n\ncontradictions\" in Quaker State's explanation to produce a\n\ntriable issue of fact.   Majority at        [typescript at 10].   I do\n\nnot agree.\n\n          Brewer's general evidence of good performance is\n\ninsufficient to cast doubt on the specific and undisputed reasons\n\nfor termination articulated by Quaker State.      Put simply, good\n\nsalesmen get fired for non-sales related reasons.     Quaker State\n\n\n                                4\n\fproffered such reasons, and Brewer has done nothing to rebut\n\nthem.   Good performance alone will not raise an inference of\n\nwrongful termination.   See Turner v. Schering-Plough Corp., 901\n\nF.2d 335, 343-44 (3d Cir. 1990) (observing that close proximity\n\nbetween positive evaluations and terminations will not\n\nnecessarily raise an inference of pretext); Healy, 860 F.2d at\n\n1215 (noting that awards, commendations, and promotions do not\n\nsuggest that countervailing weaknesses do not exist or would not\n\nbe important in future evaluations).   Brewer's failure to carry\n\nout specific tasks is dispositive, regardless of his general\n\nproficiency.   Pierce v. New Process Company, 580 F. Supp. 1543,\n\n1546 (W.D. Pa.), aff'd 749 F.2d 27 (3d Cir. 1984) (\"The absence\n\nof complaints about performance, the absence of earlier commands,\n\nand plaintiff's own opinion . . . are all irrelevant in light of\n\nthe direct order . . . which plaintiff undeniably failed to carry\n\nout.\").\n\n           Because Brewer failed to offer evidence that addresses\n\nQuaker State's reasons, summary judgment was properly granted.\n\nSee Geary v.

Bleumle, 571 F. Supp. 364, 369\n(E.D. Pa. 1983), aff'd, 735 F.2d 1349 (3d Cir. 1984) (noting that\n\n\n                                5\n\femployee explained deficiencies but did not contest them); see\n\nalso Fowle v. C & C Cola, 868 F.2d 59 (3d Cir. 1989) (affirming\n\nsummary judgment where employee failed to rebut employer's reason\n\nof lack of qualifications); Spangle v. Valley Forge Sewer\n\nAuthority, 839 F.2d 171 (3d Cir. 1988) (affirming grant of\n\nsummary judgment where employee presented no evidence to show he\n\nwas qualified for the job).\n\n          Brewer's position in this case differs from previous\n\ncases where employees have used general performance evidence to\n\nrebut a proffered reason for discharge.     Although we have\n\nrepeatedly recognized that employees can rely on evidence of good\n\nperformance to show pretext, in those cases the employers have\n\ninevitably relied on poor performance as a reason for\n\ntermination.   See, e.g., Waldron v. SL Indus. Inc., 56 F.3d 491,\n\n496 (3d Cir. 1995) (rebutting poor performance charge and charge\n\nof economic necessity); Sempier, 45 F.3d at 730 (rebutting with\n\nperformance evidence where non-performance was sole reason\n\ngiven); Colgan v. Fisher Scientific Co., 935 F.2d 1407, 1422 (3d\n\nCir.) (in banc), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 941 (1991) (allowing\n\nemployee to contest poor evaluation using testimony of co-\n\nworkers); Siegel v. Alpha Wire, 894 F.2d at 51-52 (rebutting\ncharge of poor performance and disloyalty); Sorba, 821 F.2d at\n\n205 (rebutting charge of poor performance); Chipollini, 814 F.2d\n\nat 900 (rebutting charge of poor performance based primarily on\n\ncredibility of employee).     Had Quaker State relied on poor sales\n\nperformance as its reason for discharge, I would confidently join\n\nthe majority in finding that reason rebutted and hence a\n\n\n                                  6\n\freasonable inference of pretext.     That is not the case:   Quaker\n\nState terminated Brewer because of specific failures and\n\nomissions, not because of generally inadequate performance.\n\n          Nevertheless, at some level of analysis, performance\n\nevidence will always be relevant.     Even though Quaker State did\n\nnot rely on poor performance per se, we must still consider it.\n\nAs we explained in a footnote in Fuentes, \"a decision foolish,\n\nimprudent, or incompetent by comparison to the employer's usual\n\nmode of operation can render it implausible, inconsistent, or\n\nweak.\"   32 F.3d at 765 n.8.   Because firing an extremely\n\nqualified and effective employee could be \"foolish, imprudent, or\n\nincompetent by comparison to the employer's usual mode of\n\noperation,\" the court on summary judgment must inevitably\n\nconsider employee performance.\n\n           Brewer's performance evidence comes to naught.     Under\n\nour rule in Fuentes, unless the employer relies on poor\n\nperformance as an articulated justification, the evidence of good\n\nperformance must be sufficient to make the employer's decision\n\nappear \"foolish, imprudent, or incompetent.\"     Neither Brewer's\n\nsales bonus nor his inconsistent, often mediocre, but\n\noccasionally complementary evaluations meet this burden.      See\nTurner, 901 F.2d at 343 (refusing to find issue of fact from\n\nemployee's mixed reviews); Healy, 860 F.2d at 1215 (affirming\n\ngrant of summary judgment despite generally positive and at worst\n\nmixed performance evaluations); see also Fowle, 868 F.2d at 67\n\n(discounting positive performance evaluations).     A company is not\n\n\"foolish, imprudent, or incompetent\" when it fires a salesman who\n\n\n                                 7\n\flets his customers run out of oil, fails to spend sufficient time\n\nin his territory, and consistently neglects his paperwork.\n\n            Moreover, in firing Brewer, Quaker State did not\n\ndeviate from \"the employer's usual mode of operation.\"    Fuentes,\n\n32 F.3d 765 n.8.    The majority suggests otherwise, claiming that\n\n\"[i]t is also questionable why a company would fire [a]\n\nsalesperson . . . in response to the same organizational\n\ndeficiencies that the employer had tacitly accepted for over two\n\ndecades.\"   Majority at     [typescript at 13].   This court has\n\nrecognized that changes in circumstances can turn flaws that were\n\npreviously overlooked into legitimate reasons for termination.\n\nSee Healy, 860 F.2d at 1215, 1220 (discussing change in employee\n\nenvironment).    It was undisputed that Brewer's problems came to a\n\nhead after his transfer to Detroit, where he encountered a\n\nsupervisor who was hard on everyone and a stickler for rules.\n\nApp. at 72a (\"[Pfauser] is a cross the Ts and dot the Is type of\n\nperson to the point of being almost a fanatic about it. Corporate\n\npolicy was always first in line, . . . [a]nd it affected\n\neverybody out there.\") (deposition of Judd Brewer).\n\nContemporaneous with Brewer's termination, Brewer's supervisor\n\nfired a thirty-two year old salesman for almost identical\n\ndeficiencies.    See Brewer, 874 F. Supp. at 686; cf. Waldron, 53\nF.3d at 499 (relying on evidence of double standard to reverse\n\nsummary judgment).    Brewer experienced a change in circumstances\n\nafter which his previous deficiencies were no longer accepted.\n\nThere is no contradiction here.\n\n\n\n\n                                  8\n\f            In an effort to create a contradiction, the majority\n\nmakes much of Brewer's sales bonuses combined with a Quaker State\n\nexecutive's statement that sales volume is \"extremely important\n\nin evaluating a salesperson.\"   Majority at       [typescript at\n\n11].   Unfortunately, the two propositions in the majority's\n\nconstructed contradiction pass in the night.      Proposition A, that\n\nBrewer was fired despite good sales figures, simply does not\n\ncontradict Proposition B, that sales volume is \"extremely\n\nimportant in evaluating a salesperson.\"    Descriptives such as\n\n\"extremely important\" and \"best simple measure\" show that sales\n\nvolume is one important factor to the company, indeed one very\n\nimportant factor to the company, but they do not show that sales\n\nvolume is the only important factor to the company.     Absent this\n\nfinal alternative, Brewer could have had more than acceptable\n\nsales numbers and still be fired for cause without contradiction.\n\n            The majority next suggests that \"[t]o segregate job\n\nperformance into the neat categories of sales and organizational\n\nskills defies the reality of the role of a salesperson in a\n\ncompany.\"   Majority at     [typescript at 11].    In addition, it\n\nfinds in Ezold v. Wolf, Block, Schorr & Solis-Cohen, 983 F.2d\n509, 545 (3d Cir. 1992), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 114 S. Ct.\n\n88 (1993), the concept of a job's \"critical area,\" implying that\n\na company which fires an employee despite acceptable performance\n\nin that critical area automatically raises an inference of\n\npretext.0   These arguments dress the same contention in different\n\n0\n          I note in passing that to the extent Ezold stands for\nthe proposition that an employee who falls short in a critical\n\n\n                                 9\n\fclothes.     To paraphrase the argument, the majority claims that\n\nselling is what salesmen do, so firing a salesman who sells is\n\ninherently pretextual.\n\n             I cannot agree.   The \"reality of [a salesperson's]\n\nrole,\" and the \"critical area\" of a job are simply not helpful\n\nconcepts.0    See Perry v. Prudential-Bache Sec., Inc., 738 F.\n\nSupp. 843 (D.N.J. 1989), aff'd, 904 F.2d 696 (3d Cir.), cert\n\ndenied, 498 U.S. 958 (1990) (affirming summary judgment for\n\nemployer despite showing that terminated employee excelled in\n\ncore skill of underwriting).     Both concepts attempt to establish\n\na general ideal of \"performing the job\" such that any contrary\n\nreason given by the employer conflicts with that ideal.     In doing\n\nso, the majority adopts the very posture of \"super-personnel\n\n\narea of performance can be terminated despite demonstrated\nsuccess in other job areas, it does not follow that an employee\ncannot be terminated for failures in other job areas despite\nsuccess in a critical area.\n0\n          A brief hypothetical reveals the difficulties with\nthese ideas. An associate in a law firm excels at legal\nresearch, the \"critical area\" of his job. Yet on several\noccasions, this associate fails to send documents to an important\nclient. He also consistently neglects to record his billable\nhours and maintain other mundane aspects of law office paperwork.\nAlthough some partners accept these foibles, the associate\neventually encounters a more particular supervising attorney who\nseeks and obtains his termination. Assuming that the associate's\nsubsequent suit for discriminatory discharge reached the pretext\nstage, I have little doubt that this hypothetical associate could\nnot rebut the employer's specific reason for termination with\ngeneral evidence of good performance in the critical area of his\njob. Nor could some elusive vision of the \"reality of a lawyer's\nrole\" aid him in linking inextricably his failings in\ncorrespondence and paperwork to his more successful forays in the\nfirm library. Such evidence of good performance would not raise\nan inference that the employer's reasons for termination were\npretextual. Indeed, such evidence would be entirely consistent\nwith the reasons given for termination.\n\n                                   10\n\fdepartment\" that it all too strenuously declines.    Majority at\n\n[typescript at 11].    The majority defines the essence of a sales\n\nposition and evaluates Brewer's performance against that\n\nstandard.    I would save this court the task of redefining\n\nBrewer's job description to include only those requirements that\n\nhe could meet.    We should instead look to whether his good sales\n\nperformance was inconsistent with his reasons for termination.       I\n\nfind no contradiction and no reasonable inference of pretext.\n\n            It also bears noting that in firing Brewer, Quaker\n\nState committed none of the questionable acts which we have cited\n\nin the past as indicative of pretext.    Brewer's performance\n\nproblems were long-standing and well documented.    See Healy, 860\n\nF.2d at 1215 (discounting performance based inferences where\n\ncomplaints were long-standing and the employee had been informed\n\nof their nature); Billet, 940 F.2d at 827 (same); cf. Colgan, 925\n\nF.2d at 1422 (stressing that evaluations were a surprise and that\n\nratings became aberrationally low when employee refused to\n\nretire).    He never contested these evaluations prior to\n\ntermination.0    There was no evidence of corporate machinations or\n\na plot to transfer Brewer and set him up for termination.     Cf.\nWaldron, 56 F.3d at 496-97; Armbruster, 32 F.3d at 772-74. Brewer\n\noffered no statistical or testimonial evidence indicating that\n\n\n0\n          This fact makes Brewer's claim of pretext sound like a\npost hoc explanation. Although the post hoc concept is typically\napplied to the employer's reason for terminating the employee, it\nis equally valid here. Just as post hoc timing indicates the\nemployer's reason is pretext, see Waldron, 56 F.3d at 498;\nSempier, 45 F.3d at 731; Fuentes 32 F.2d at 764; Siegel v. Alpha\nWire, 894 F.2d at 55, it similarly undermines Brewer's claim.\n\n\n                                  11\n\fQuaker State had discriminated against similarly situated\n\nparties.     Cf. Siegel v. Alpha Wire, 894 F.2d at 55.\n\n             In my view, Brewer's performance evidence fails to\n\nreach the quantum required by Fuentes.    He has not presented\n\n\"sufficient evidence to meaningfully throw into question, i.e.,\n\nto cast substantial doubt upon, [the defendant's] proffered\n\nreason . . . (e.g., by painting them as weak, implausible,\n\ncontradictory, or incoherent)[.]\"       32 F.3d at 765.   Indeed, he\n\nhas presented no evidence indicating that his employer did not\n\nact for its asserted non-discriminatory reasons.     The record\n\nshows Quaker State's reliance on his failure to meet work\n\nrequirements to be adequate, plausible, consistent, and\n\ncoherent.0\n\n             Having addressed the sufficiency of Brewer's general\n\nperformance evidence, I now turn to the two other items that he\n\nproffers, the Weaver memorandum and the Corn comment.      For both\n\nitems, the inference of discrimination that Brewer hopes to draw\n\nis unreasonable \"in light of competing inferences.\"       Matsushita\n\nElec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 589 (1986).\n\n0\n          As we have so often observed, McDonnell Douglas cases\nare inherently fact-specific. Billet, 940 F.2d at 828\n(\"discrimination cases are inherently fact-bound\"); Healy, 860\nF.2d at 1215 (\"each ADEA case must be judged on its own facts\").\nMy rejection of Brewer's showing would not foreclose the success\nof some future performance-based challenge to termination, either\nwhere the employer relied on poor performance as one of its\njustifications or where, as per Fuentes, the employee's\nperformance is sufficient to make the employer's decision appear\n\"foolish, imprudent, or incompetent.\" See Fuentes, 32 F.3d at\n764 n.7 (explaining that employee need only cast doubt on certain\nemployee reasons). Brewer's evidence, however, does not meet\nthis burden, and the grant of summary judgment was proper.\n\n\n                                  12\n\f           As to the Weaver memorandum, I have little to add to\n\nthe analysis of the trial court.     Brewer, 874 F. Supp. at 683-84.\n\nBrewer greatly amplified the impact of Weaver's \"[age] presents\n\nanother problem\" statement by repeatedly quoting it out of\n\ncontext.   When the letter is read as a whole, it becomes apparent\n\nthat an inference of age discrimination is not reasonable.0    The\n\n0\n          To properly evaluate the statement, it must be\nunderstood as written. This extensive quotation places the\ncomment in context:\n\n           The performance plan that you outlined . . .\n           is excellent. It is important that you\n           identify specific deficiencies [in Brewer's\n           performance] and the results desired by\n           management.\n\n           At this point in time, I would recommend that\n           you identify specific monthly dates when you\n           two can get together and discuss results over\n           the previous thirty (30) days. The results\n           of those meetings should be summarized in\n           letter format and Judd should sign the letter\n           to acknowledge receipt. It is also important\n           that we provide Judd with written notice of\n           action that will be taken if the problems are\n           not corrected. I suggest summarizing your\n           meeting of August 19, acknowledge receipt by\n           Judd, and close the letter by stating, \"I\n           must emphasize to you that your failure to\n           permanently improve your work performance may\n           lead to more severe discipline, up to and\n           including discharge.\"\n\n           Attached for your review is a brief summary\n           of Judd's performance appraisals over the\n           last 15 years. I am disappointed that action\n           was not taken years ago to correct these\n           problems. It is apparent from the\n           performance appraisals that he has had\n           ongoing performance problems throughout his\n           employment history.\n\n           I am obviously concerned that we have to take\n           this type of action after 23 years of\n\n\n                                13\n\fdistrict court drew the only reasonable conclusion:   \"The\n\nstatement as to Brewer's age being a 'problem,' together with the\n\nnotations of his age and years of service, obviously indicate\n\nWeaver's awareness that Brewer might file an age discrimination\n\nlawsuit if terminated.\"   Id. at 684.\n\n           From the tone of the sentence and its placement in the\n\nmemorandum, it is clear that Brewer's age militates against his\n\nfiring.   The comment appears in a separate paragraph from the\n\ndiscussion of Brewer's employment problems.   Moreover, in\n\nWeaver's unrebutted deposition testimony, she stated that\n\nstandard procedures were followed in requiring documentation of\n\nBrewer's performance while on probation and that she highlighted\n\nBrewer's age to alert his supervisor to his protected status and\n\nto ensure that age was not the reason for termination.     Id.; see\n\nPerry v. Prudential-Bache Sec., Inc., 738 F. Supp. 843, 849\n\n(D.N.J. 1989) (holding that age data on various employment\n\nrecords was used for computing employee's pension, not for the\n\npurpose of discrimination), aff'd, 904 F.2d 696 (3d Cir.), cert.\n\ndenied, 498 U.S. 958 (1990).   The district court correctly\n\n\n           employment. Also, Judd is 53 years old,\n           which presents another problem. However,\n           within the next ninety (90) days, it is\n           extremely important for you to document as\n           much as possible in the event his performance\n           does not improve.\n\n          Please forward each letter for our personnel\n          file in Oil City. I will stay in touch with\n          you to see what progress has been made . . ..\nApp. at 24.\n\n\n\n\n                                14\n\fconcluded that nothing supported an inference of discrimination,\n\na conclusion that is all the more valid in light of Brewer's long\n\nhistory of employment problems.\n\n          As to the Corn comment, it expresses a truism that I\n\nwould deem to be a stray remark by a non-decisionmaker.    Even if\n\nit were to be considered relevant, I do not believe that it would\n\ncreate a material issue of fact sufficient to warrant a denial of\n\nQuaker State's motion for summary judgment.   See White v.\n\nWestinghouse Elec. Co., 862 F.2d 56, 61 (3d Cir. 1988)\n\n(considering similar comments); Perry v. Prudential-Bache Sec.\n\nInc., 738 F.

I will not\n\ndwell on it further.\n\n          I conclude that, viewed as a whole, the record contains\n\nnothing that casts meaningful doubt on Quaker State's proffered\n\nreason for Brewer's discharge.    \"While plaintiff is 'entitled to\n\nevery favorable inference,' he is not entitled to build a case on\n\n'the gossamer threads of whimsy, speculation and conjecture.'\"\n\nKeller v. Bluemle, 571 F. Supp. 364, 371 (E.D. Pa. 1983), aff'd,\n\n735 F.2d 1349 (3d Cir. 1984).\n\n          I do not believe that Brewer has made the showing\n\nnecessary to survive a motion for summary judgment.   Because I\n\nwould affirm the district court, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                                  15\n\f",

Brewer appeals the\n\ndistrict court's grant of summary judgment in favor of his\n\nemployer, Quaker State Oil Refining Corporation and Quaker State\n\nCorporation (\"Quaker State\"), on Brewer's Age Discrimination in\n\nEmployment Act (\"ADEA\") claim, 29 U.S.C. § 623 (1988), and the\n\ndismissal of his pendent state-law claim brought under Michigan's\n\nanti-discrimination statute, the Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act,\n\nMich. Comp. Laws § 37.2101-2804.       Because the record reflects a\n\ngenuine issue of material fact regarding whether Quaker State's\n\nasserted nondiscriminatory reasons for discharging Brewer are\n\npretextual, we will reverse the district court's entry of summary\n\njudgment in favor of Quaker State and remand the matter for\n\nfurther proceedings.\n\n\n\n                                  I.\n\n          Brewer worked for Quaker State as a sales\n\nrepresentative from 1968 until the time of his discharge in March\n\n1992, at the age of fifty-three.       He worked in the Pittsburgh\n\noffice until it closed in 1989.       During the course of his\n\nemployment in Pittsburgh, Brewer was supervised by two different\n\ndivision managers, Bruce Drummond and Michael O'Donnell.         During\n\n\n                                  2\n\ftheir respective tenures, both Drummond and O'Donnell encountered\n\ncertain problems with Brewer's performance.    For example,\n\nDrummond stated that Brewer's clients complained that they had\n\nrun out of oil or had not seen their sales representative in some\n\ntime.   In January 1989, O'Donnell placed Brewer on a ninety-day\n\nprobation for similar performance deficiencies, including\n\ncustomer complaints about running out of oil, poor follow-up with\n\nprojects, inaccurate and incomplete paperwork, short work days,\n\nand lack of organization.    Shortly after Brewer completed his\n\nprobationary period, he was transferred to the Detroit division.\n\n           District Manager Paul Pfauser supervised Brewer in\n\nDetroit.   In 1990 Pfauser gave Brewer acceptable performance\n\nratings, but criticized him for poor planning.    Pfauser advised\n\nBrewer that he needed to work more closely with his client\n\naccounts and set higher standards for himself.    At the end of\n\n1990 Brewer received a sales bonus for exceeding the company's\n\nsales quota for that year.\n\n           In May 1991, shortly before his second annual review\n\nunder Pfauser's supervision, Pfauser notified Brewer that various\n\nfacets of his performance required improvement.    Pfauser\n\ncounseled Brewer to be more efficient, to follow-up with requests\n\nboth from his customers and from management, and to improve the\n\ntimeliness and completeness of his sales reports.    In his formal\n\nevaluation in June 1991, Brewer received marginal or unacceptable\n\nratings in all categories.\n\n           In August 1991, Brewer was placed on a ninety-day\n\nprobation for his performance deficiencies.    At that time,\n\n\n                                 3\n\fPfauser criticized Brewer for performing poorly in the areas of\n\nclient communications and organization.    In December 1991, Brewer\n\nagain exceeded the company's sales quota and received another\n\nbonus.    Brewer was the only salesperson in the Detroit region to\n\nreceive such a bonus for both 1990 and 1991.\n\n            Brewer's personnel file for the years prior to 1990 was\n\nlost.    However, it is not disputed that Brewer's mean performance\n\nevaluation rating from 1987 through 1990 was \"3\" out of a\n\npossible \"5\", which translates into \"competent\" by Quaker State's\n\nperformance standards.    Factoring in his evaluation for 1991,\n\nBrewer's overall average for 1987 to 1991 was 2.9.\n\n            At the end of the ninety-day probation, Pfauser\n\nrepeated his concerns that Brewer was spending too little time in\n\nhis territory and not adequately communicating with customers. At\n\nthis time Brewer's probationary period was extended for an\n\nadditional sixty days.    On February 18, 1992, Pfauser wrote a\n\nmemorandum to Brewer documenting performance problems, including\n\nBrewer's misprocessing orders, and failure to advise his accounts\n\nof credit problems.\n\n            Brewer challenged Pfauser's appraisal, commenting that\n\nhis performance had improved.    Brewer also has claimed that\n\nPfauser was \"nitpicking,\" and that the problems were the result\n\nof petty misunderstandings, or were not really problems at all.\n\nNonetheless, in the days that followed the February 18, 1992\n\nmemorandum, Pfauser sought and obtained approval to terminate\n\nBrewer's employment.    Brewer was discharged on March 9, 1992, and\n\n\n\n\n                                 4\n\fthis lawsuit ensued.    The district court granted summary judgment\n\nagainst Brewer.\n\n\n\n                                II.\n\n            We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291 to\n\nreview the final order of the district court, which exercised\n\njurisdiction under 29 U.S.C. § 626(c)(1), 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and\n\n1343(a)(4), and supplemental jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n\n§1367.\n\n            On review of a district court's grant of summary\n\njudgment, we apply the same test the district court should have\n\napplied initially.

Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1477697\"><a href=\"/opinion/1477697/brewer-v-quaker-state-oil-refining-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">874</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">672</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 681-82 (W.D. Pa. 1995).\n\nWe agree with the district court's analysis up to this point.       It\n\nis undisputed that Brewer is a member of a protected class, was\n\ndischarged by Quaker State, and was replaced by an individual not\n\nwithin the protected class.    Moreover, Brewer was qualified for\n\nthe position of sales representative.    He worked as a Quaker\n\nState sales representative for twenty-three years.     During his\n\nlast five years on the job, he received overall evaluations that\n\ntranslated into \"competent\" by Quaker State's performance\n\nstandards.    Accordingly, Brewer has established a prima facie\ncase of age discrimination.\n\n             Quaker State has also established legitimate, non-\n\ndiscriminatory reasons for terminating Brewer's employment.\n\nPfauser documented continuous performance problems, including\n\npoor follow-up on customer requests, poor communications with\n\n\n\n\n                                  7\n\fclients and with management, too little time spent in his\n\nterritory, and late and ambiguous sales reports.\n\n\n\n                                B.\n\n          We must next determine whether Brewer has met his\n\nburden of demonstrating that a factfinder could find that the\n\nallegedly legitimate reasons proffered for his discharge were\n\nonly a pretext for discrimination in order to survive Quaker\n\nState's motion for summary judgment.   To defeat a summary\n\njudgment motion based on a defendant's proffer of\n\nnondiscriminatory reasons, a plaintiff who has made a prima facie\n\nshowing of discrimination need point to some evidence, direct or\n\ncircumstantial, from which a factfinder could reasonably either:\n\n(1) disbelieve the employer's articulated legitimate reason; or\n\n(2) believe that an invidious discriminatory reason was more\n\nlikely than not a motivating or determinative cause of the\n\nemployer's action.   Fuentes v. Perskie, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"676501\"><a href=\"/opinion/676501/luis-a-fuentes-v-steven-p-perskie-chairman-of-the-new-jersey-casino/\"><span class=\"volume\">32</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">759</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 763-64 (3d\n\nCir. 1994).   The factfinder may infer from the combination of the\n\nplaintiff's prima facie case, as well as its own rejection of the\n\nemployer's proffered nondiscriminatory reason, that the employer\n\nunlawfully discriminated against the plaintiff and was merely\n\ntrying to conceal its illegal act with the articulated reason.\n\nSee Hicks, __ U.S. at __, 113 S. Ct. at 2749.   Thus, if the\n\nplaintiff has pointed to evidence sufficient to discredit the\n\ndefendant's proffered reason, to survive summary judgment the\n\nplaintiff need not also come forward with additional evidence of\n\n\n\n\n                                8\n\fdiscrimination beyond his or her prima facie case.   Fuentes, 32\n\nF.3d at 764.\n\n          To discredit the employer's proffered reason, the\n\nplaintiff cannot simply show that the employer's decision was\n\nwrong or mistaken, since the factual dispute at issue is whether\n\na discriminatory animus motivated the employer, not whether the\n\nemployer is \"wise, shrewd, prudent, or competent.\"   Fuentes, 32\n\nF.2d at 765 (citing Ezold v.

First, Brewer's own testimony disputed the\n\nsignificance of the problems raised by Pfauser.    While Brewer\n\nchallenged the extent and degree of his deficiencies rather than\n\ntheir existence, Brewer testified to specific examples of\n\nPfauser's errant or misplaced criticisms.    Such evidence amounts\n\nto more than his subjective opinion of his performance.    Second,\n\n\n                                 9\n\fBrewer provided evidence that he had succeeded in selling oil for\n\nnearly twenty-five years in the employ of Quaker State, and for\n\nthe last five years, he was rated \"fully acceptable\" by Quaker\n\nState in his evaluations.     Third, Brewer provided evidence that\n\nhe received a bonus for surpassing his sales quota in 1990 and\n\n1991, and was the only salesperson in the Detroit region to\n\nexceed his or her sales quota for those years.\n\n             The district court discounted this evidence, reasoning\n\nthat Brewer cannot pick and choose which employment standard he\n\nwill meet.    The district court reasoned that \"although\n\nplaintiff's average numerical rating and sales bonus may be\n\nsomewhat contradictory with the fact of his termination, the\n\ncourt does not believe that they give rise to such 'weaknesses,\n\nimplausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherences, or\n\ncontradictions' in Quaker State's explanation that a reasonable\n\nfactfinder could rationally find the explanation unworthy of\n\ncredence.\"    Brewer, 874 F. Supp. at 682.   We disagree that the\n\n\"somewhat contradictory\" evidence does not demonstrate a triable\n\nissue of fact.     On summary judgment, it is not the court's role\n\nto weigh the disputed evidence and decide which is more\n\nprobative.    Sempier, 45 F.3d at 731.   The fact that Brewer\n\nreceived a bonus three months before he was fired and was the\n\nonly sales representative in the Detroit region who received such\n\na bonus is contradictory to Quaker State's admission that the\n\nmost important standard of job performance is sales.\n\n             Quaker State's Executive Vice President of Sales,\n\nWilliam Marshall, stated that sales volume is \"extremely\n\n\n                                  10\n\fimportant in evaluating a salesperson,\" and represents \"the best\n\nsimple measure\" of a salesperson's performance.   App. at 200,\n\n203.   Quaker State's counsel also acknowledged this fact at oral\n\nargument before this court.    Indeed, the volume of sales may\n\nalways be the primary measure of a salesperson's performance. See\n\nKiliszewski v. Overnite Transp.

A factfinder could find it implausible\n\nthat Quaker State would have fired Brewer for such deficiencies\n\nwhen he was successful in the sole area identified by Quaker\n\nState's own performance incentive program -- sales.\n\n            In Ezold, 983 F.2d at 509, we held that a district\n\ncourt had erred in finding that the employer's explanation for\n\ndenying a promotion to the plaintiff was pretextual.     The\n\nemployer claimed that it had denied partnership to the plaintiff\n\nbecause of her deficiencies in the area of legal analysis.       There\n\nwas no question that the plaintiff suffered from serious\n\nshortfalls in that area, although she had demonstrated success in\n\nother areas of the job.     It was also clear that the employer\n\nconsidered legal analysis to be the critical category of\n\nperformance review.     The district court had questioned the wisdom\n\nof the employer's partnership standards, and we held that \"[i]t\n\nwas not for the district court to determine that Ezold's skills\n\nin areas other than legal analysis made her sufficiently\n\nqualified for admission to the partnership.\"    Id. at 528.      This\n\ncase is distinguishable on its facts.    In Ezold, the plaintiff\n\nsuffered deficiencies in the one area deemed critical by the\n\nemployer.   Here, in contrast, Brewer had some problems in a few\n\naspects of the job.     Yet, he performed well in the one area\n\ndeemed by Quaker State to merit a performance bonus.     This raises\n\n\n\n\n                                  12\n\fgenuine issues about the credence of Quaker State's performance-\n\nbased explanation.\n\n          It is also questionable why a company would fire the\n\nonly salesperson to receive consecutive annual bonuses in\n\nresponse to the same organizational deficiencies that the\n\nemployer had tacitly accepted for over two decades.   During the\n\ntwenty-three years that Brewer worked for Quaker State, he\n\nconsistently sold a high volume of oil despite the repeated\n\ncriticisms of other aspects of his job performance.   It was not\n\nuntil late in his career that Quaker State turned the criticisms\n\nof Brewer's performance into the basis for adverse action.     A\n\nreasonable factfinder could view Quaker State's belated reliance\n\non these criticisms as evidence that tends to show pretext.    See\n\nLevin v.

Brewer's testimony disputing the significance of the\n\nalleged problems, his twenty-three years of consistently good\n\nsales performance and recent merit bonuses cast sufficient doubt\n\non Quaker State's contention that Brewer was discharged because\n\nof poor job performance in areas which the company had long\n\noverlooked or tolerated.0\n\n          Brewer has also provided evidence that in August of\n\n1991, Wanda Weaver, Quaker State's personnel manager, wrote a\n\nmemorandum to Pfauser summarizing Brewer's performance for the\n\nlast fifteen years.    In the memorandum Weaver noted that \"Judd is\n\n53 years old, which presents another problem.\"   App. at 24.   The\n\ndistrict court determined that this statement merely indicated\n\nWeaver's awareness that, if terminated, Brewer may file an age\n\ndiscrimination suit.   Although the jury may very well conclude\n\nthat this remark merely reflects an awareness of Quaker State's\n\nlegal obligations, the statement is also subject to competing\n\ninterpretations.   Another reasonable interpretation is that\n\nBrewer's age was a \"problem\" for Quaker State.   On summary\n\n0\nThe dissent states that Brewer has \"done nothing to rebut\"\nQuaker State's proffered non-sales reasons for firing him.\nDissent Typescript at 5. The dissent has overlooked evidence of\nBrewer's testimony in which he related specific examples of his\nsupervisor's errant or misplaced criticisms. Such evidence\namounts to more than his subjective opinion of his job\nperformance. Of course, unrefuted evidence was also presented\nthat Brewer's past performance for twenty years was identical to\nthat for which he was fired. It was not until late in his career\nthat the criticisms of Brewer's performance were turned into\nreasons for his termination. This evidence goes directly to\ndiscrediting Quaker State's non-sales related reasons for firing\nBrewer.\n\n                                 14\n\fjudgment, we must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the\n\nnonmoving party.   Drawing the inference in Brewer's favor,\n\nWeaver's statement tends to show a discriminatory animus.     In\n\nviewing the record as a whole, as we must, we conclude that the\n\nstatement is probative, and should be submitted for a jury's\n\nconsideration.\n\n          Brewer next produced evidence that in March 1990, Jack\n\nCorn, Chief Executive Officer of Quaker State, discussed two new\n\nexecutives in the company newsletter.    He stated, \"two of our\n\nstar young men in their mid-40s.     That age group is our future.\"\n\nApp. at 26-27.   Brewer asserts that this remark is circumstantial\n\nevidence of Quaker State's preference for younger workers.      The\n\ndistrict court determined that Corn's statement was a \"stray\n\nremark, unconnected with and remote from the decision-making\n\nprocess which resulted in Brewer's discharge.\"    Brewer, 874 F.\n\nSupp. at 683.\n\n          We have held that stray remarks by non-decisionmakers\n\nor by decisionmakers unrelated to the decision process are rarely\n\ngiven great weight, particularly if they were made temporally\n\nremote from the date of the decision. Ezold, 983 F.2d at 545.         We\n\nagree with the district court that the Corn statement is a \"stray\n\nremark\" made by a non-decisionmaker and temporally remote from\n\nthe decision to terminate Brewer.    The comment was made almost\n\ntwo years before Brewer's March 1992 termination.    Brewer's\n\nsupervisor testified that he could not recall ever seeing or\n\nhearing Corn's statement, and there is no evidence of a causal\n\nlink between Corn's statement and Brewer's termination.\n\n\n                                15\n\f           Though the Corn statement should not be given\n\nsignificant or commanding weight, at trial, it may provide some\n\nrelevant evidence of discrimination.   We have held that a\n\nsupervisor's statement about the employer's employment practices\n\nor managerial policy is relevant to show the corporate culture in\n\nwhich a company makes its employment decision, and may be used to\n\nbuild a circumstantial case of discrimination.

While a\n\nfactfinder could find Corn's comment too abstract to evince age\n\ndiscrimination, it may also be considered by the jury as evidence\n\nof the corporate culture in which the employment decision to\n\ndischarge Brewer was made, and circumstantial evidence of age\n\ndiscrimination.

The\n\ngeneral principles concerning the inferences to be drawn from the\n\nloss or destruction of documents are well established.      When the\n\ncontents of a document are relevant to an issue in a case, the\n\ntrier of fact generally may receive the fact of the document's\n\nnonproduction or destruction as evidence that the party that has\n\nprevented production did so out of the well-founded fear that the\n\ncontents would harm him.

Gumbs, 718\n\nF.2d at 96.    Further, it must appear that there has been an\n\nactual suppression or withholding of the evidence.     No\n\nunfavorable inference arises when the circumstances indicate that\n\nthe document or article in question has been lost or accidentally\n\ndestroyed, or where the failure to produce it is otherwise\n\nproperly accounted for.     See generally 31A C.J.S. Evidence\n\n§156(2); 29 Am. Jur. 2d Evidence § 177 (\"Such a presumption or\n\ninference arises, however, only when the spoilation or\n\ndestruction [of evidence] was intentional, and indicates fraud\n\nand a desire to suppress the truth, and it does not arise where\n\nthe destruction was a matter of routine with no fraudulent\n\nintent.\").\n\n            The district court found that the file was lost in\n\nconnection with the death of Quaker State's in-house attorney,\n\nand was not destroyed intentionally.    Quaker State's in-house\n\nattorney died of a terminal illness after he took possession of\n\nthe file.    Quaker State avers that it has continued to search for\n\nthe file, but to no avail.    We cannot say the district court\n\napplied the incorrect legal standard, nor were its factual\n\nfindings clearly erroneous.    The destruction or failure to\n\nproduce the record could have been due to many reasons unrelated\n\nto the lawsuit.    See, e.g., Rogers v.

He contended instead that they were\n\ninadequate for discharge because he was a good salesman.\n\n             I cannot agree that Brewer's evidence meets the\n\nMcDonald Douglas summary judgment standard.    His general\n\nperformance evidence, considered in connection with Quaker\n\nState's specific reasons for discharge, is insufficient to raise\n\na genuine issue of material fact; the inferences he draws from\n\nhis remaining evidence are unreasonable.\n\n             The majority opinion provides a fair summation of the\n\nfacts of this case.    Brewer was fired following a series of\n\nsignificant performance problems, such as letting his customers\n\nrun out of oil and failing to complete or even file his\n\npaperwork.    To demonstrate that these reasons were pretextual and\n\nthat the real reason for his firing was age discrimination,\n\nBrewer offered three principal pieces of evidence:     first,\n\ngeneral performance evidence such as positive comments on\n\npersonnel evaluations and a sales bonus for selling oil in the\n\ntwo years prior to termination; second, a personnel memorandum\n\n\n                                  3\n\fwritten by Wanda Weaver, Quaker State's Manager of Employment and\n\nCompensation, and sent to Pfauser, Brewer's supervisor at the\n\ntime, which summarized Brewer's personnel evaluations since 1975,\n\napproved a \"performance plan\" that Pfauser had submitted, and\n\nobserved, \"[a]lso, Judd is 53 years old, which presents another\n\nproblem\"; and third, a comment by Jack Corn, then chief executive\n\nofficer of the company, in the company newspaper referring to two\n\nof his new \"seconds-in command\" as \"two of our star young men in\n\ntheir mid-40s . . . [t]hat age group is our future . . ..\"\n\n          For clarity, I will analyze each of Brewer's\n\nevidentiary proffers independently.     Brewer's general evidence of\n\nacceptable job performance forms the nub of the case.     The Weaver\n\nmemorandum and the Corn comment are far weaker and, I believe,\n\ninsufficient to stave off summary judgment absent Brewer's\n\nevaluations and sales bonus.\n\n          Quaker State alleges that it fired Brewer for a litany\n\nof specific performance problems.      Brewer responds with generic\n\nevidence of his generally successful performance as a salesman.\n\nThe majority believes that Brewer's showing reveals sufficient\n\n\"weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherences, or\n\ncontradictions\" in Quaker State's explanation to produce a\n\ntriable issue of fact.   Majority at        [typescript at 10].   I do\n\nnot agree.\n\n          Brewer's general evidence of good performance is\n\ninsufficient to cast doubt on the specific and undisputed reasons\n\nfor termination articulated by Quaker State.      Put simply, good\n\nsalesmen get fired for non-sales related reasons.     Quaker State\n\n\n                                4\n\fproffered such reasons, and Brewer has done nothing to rebut\n\nthem.

Although we have\n\nrepeatedly recognized that employees can rely on evidence of good\n\nperformance to show pretext, in those cases the employers have\n\ninevitably relied on poor performance as a reason for\n\ntermination.

Had Quaker State relied on poor sales\n\nperformance as its reason for discharge, I would confidently join\n\nthe majority in finding that reason rebutted and hence a\n\n\n                                  6\n\freasonable inference of pretext.     That is not the case:   Quaker\n\nState terminated Brewer because of specific failures and\n\nomissions, not because of generally inadequate performance.\n\n          Nevertheless, at some level of analysis, performance\n\nevidence will always be relevant.     Even though Quaker State did\n\nnot rely on poor performance per se, we must still consider it.\n\nAs we explained in a footnote in Fuentes, \"a decision foolish,\n\nimprudent, or incompetent by comparison to the employer's usual\n\nmode of operation can render it implausible, inconsistent, or\n\nweak.\"   32 F.3d at 765 n.8.   Because firing an extremely\n\nqualified and effective employee could be \"foolish, imprudent, or\n\nincompetent by comparison to the employer's usual mode of\n\noperation,\" the court on summary judgment must inevitably\n\nconsider employee performance.\n\n           Brewer's performance evidence comes to naught.     Under\n\nour rule in Fuentes, unless the employer relies on poor\n\nperformance as an articulated justification, the evidence of good\n\nperformance must be sufficient to make the employer's decision\n\nappear \"foolish, imprudent, or incompetent.\"     Neither Brewer's\n\nsales bonus nor his inconsistent, often mediocre, but\n\noccasionally complementary evaluations meet this burden.      See\nTurner, 901 F.2d at 343 (refusing to find issue of fact from\n\nemployee's mixed reviews); Healy, 860 F.2d at 1215 (affirming\n\ngrant of summary judgment despite generally positive and at worst\n\nmixed performance evaluations); see also Fowle, 868 F.2d at 67\n\n(discounting positive performance evaluations).

The majority suggests otherwise, claiming that\n\n\"[i]t is also questionable why a company would fire [a]\n\nsalesperson . . . in response to the same organizational\n\ndeficiencies that the employer had tacitly accepted for over two\n\ndecades.\"   Majority at     [typescript at 13].   This court has\n\nrecognized that changes in circumstances can turn flaws that were\n\npreviously overlooked into legitimate reasons for termination.\n\nSee Healy, 860 F.2d at 1215, 1220 (discussing change in employee\n\nenvironment).    It was undisputed that Brewer's problems came to a\n\nhead after his transfer to Detroit, where he encountered a\n\nsupervisor who was hard on everyone and a stickler for rules.\n\nApp. at 72a (\"[Pfauser] is a cross the Ts and dot the Is type of\n\nperson to the point of being almost a fanatic about it. Corporate\n\npolicy was always first in line, . . . [a]nd it affected\n\neverybody out there.\") (deposition of Judd Brewer).\n\nContemporaneous with Brewer's termination, Brewer's supervisor\n\nfired a thirty-two year old salesman for almost identical\n\ndeficiencies.    See Brewer, 874 F. Supp. at 686; cf. Waldron, 53\nF.3d at 499 (relying on evidence of double standard to reverse\n\nsummary judgment).    Brewer experienced a change in circumstances\n\nafter which his previous deficiencies were no longer accepted.\n\nThere is no contradiction here.\n\n\n\n\n                                  8\n\f            In an effort to create a contradiction, the majority\n\nmakes much of Brewer's sales bonuses combined with a Quaker State\n\nexecutive's statement that sales volume is \"extremely important\n\nin evaluating a salesperson.\"   Majority at       [typescript at\n\n11].   Unfortunately, the two propositions in the majority's\n\nconstructed contradiction pass in the night.      Proposition A, that\n\nBrewer was fired despite good sales figures, simply does not\n\ncontradict Proposition B, that sales volume is \"extremely\n\nimportant in evaluating a salesperson.\"    Descriptives such as\n\n\"extremely important\" and \"best simple measure\" show that sales\n\nvolume is one important factor to the company, indeed one very\n\nimportant factor to the company, but they do not show that sales\n\nvolume is the only important factor to the company.     Absent this\n\nfinal alternative, Brewer could have had more than acceptable\n\nsales numbers and still be fired for cause without contradiction.\n\n            The majority next suggests that \"[t]o segregate job\n\nperformance into the neat categories of sales and organizational\n\nskills defies the reality of the role of a salesperson in a\n\ncompany.\"   Majority at     [typescript at 11].

The \"reality of [a salesperson's]\n\nrole,\" and the \"critical area\" of a job are simply not helpful\n\nconcepts.0    See Perry v.

Both concepts attempt to establish\n\na general ideal of \"performing the job\" such that any contrary\n\nreason given by the employer conflicts with that ideal.     In doing\n\nso, the majority adopts the very posture of \"super-personnel\n\n\narea of performance can be terminated despite demonstrated\nsuccess in other job areas, it does not follow that an employee\ncannot be terminated for failures in other job areas despite\nsuccess in a critical area.\n0\n          A brief hypothetical reveals the difficulties with\nthese ideas. An associate in a law firm excels at legal\nresearch, the \"critical area\" of his job. Yet on several\noccasions, this associate fails to send documents to an important\nclient. He also consistently neglects to record his billable\nhours and maintain other mundane aspects of law office paperwork.\nAlthough some partners accept these foibles, the associate\neventually encounters a more particular supervising attorney who\nseeks and obtains his termination. Assuming that the associate's\nsubsequent suit for discriminatory discharge reached the pretext\nstage, I have little doubt that this hypothetical associate could\nnot rebut the employer's specific reason for termination with\ngeneral evidence of good performance in the critical area of his\njob. Nor could some elusive vision of the \"reality of a lawyer's\nrole\" aid him in linking inextricably his failings in\ncorrespondence and paperwork to his more successful forays in the\nfirm library. Such evidence of good performance would not raise\nan inference that the employer's reasons for termination were\npretextual. Indeed, such evidence would be entirely consistent\nwith the reasons given for termination.\n\n                                   10\n\fdepartment\" that it all too strenuously declines.    Majority at\n\n[typescript at 11].    The majority defines the essence of a sales\n\nposition and evaluates Brewer's performance against that\n\nstandard.    I would save this court the task of redefining\n\nBrewer's job description to include only those requirements that\n\nhe could meet.    We should instead look to whether his good sales\n\nperformance was inconsistent with his reasons for termination.       I\n\nfind no contradiction and no reasonable inference of pretext.\n\n            It also bears noting that in firing Brewer, Quaker\n\nState committed none of the questionable acts which we have cited\n\nin the past as indicative of pretext.    Brewer's performance\n\nproblems were long-standing and well documented.    See Healy, 860\n\nF.2d at 1215 (discounting performance based inferences where\n\ncomplaints were long-standing and the employee had been informed\n\nof their nature); Billet, 940 F.2d at 827 (same); cf. Colgan, 925\n\nF.2d at 1422 (stressing that evaluations were a surprise and that\n\nratings became aberrationally low when employee refused to\n\nretire).    He never contested these evaluations prior to\n\ntermination.0    There was no evidence of corporate machinations or\n\na plot to transfer Brewer and set him up for termination.     Cf.\nWaldron, 56 F.3d at 496-97; Armbruster, 32 F.3d at 772-74. Brewer\n\noffered no statistical or testimonial evidence indicating that\n\n\n0\n          This fact makes Brewer's claim of pretext sound like a\npost hoc explanation. Although the post hoc concept is typically\napplied to the employer's reason for terminating the employee, it\nis equally valid here. Just as post hoc timing indicates the\nemployer's reason is pretext, see Waldron, 56 F.3d at 498;\nSempier, 45 F.3d at 731; Fuentes 32 F.2d at 764; Siegel v. Alpha\nWire, 894 F.2d at 55, it similarly undermines Brewer's claim.\n\n\n                                  11\n\fQuaker State had discriminated against similarly situated\n\nparties.     Cf. Siegel v. Alpha Wire, 894 F.2d at 55.\n\n             In my view, Brewer's performance evidence fails to\n\nreach the quantum required by Fuentes.    He has not presented\n\n\"sufficient evidence to meaningfully throw into question, i.e.,\n\nto cast substantial doubt upon, [the defendant's] proffered\n\nreason . . .

Indeed, he\n\nhas presented no evidence indicating that his employer did not\n\nact for its asserted non-discriminatory reasons.

Brewer's evidence, however, does not meet\nthis burden, and the grant of summary judgment was proper.\n\n\n                                  12\n\f           As to the Weaver memorandum, I have little to add to\n\nthe analysis of the trial court.     Brewer, 874 F. Supp. at 683-84.\n\nBrewer greatly amplified the impact of Weaver's \"[age] presents\n\nanother problem\" statement by repeatedly quoting it out of\n\ncontext.   When the letter is read as a whole, it becomes apparent\n\nthat an inference of age discrimination is not reasonable.0    The\n\n0\n          To properly evaluate the statement, it must be\nunderstood as written. This extensive quotation places the\ncomment in context:\n\n           The performance plan that you outlined . . .\n           is excellent. It is important that you\n           identify specific deficiencies [in Brewer's\n           performance] and the results desired by\n           management.\n\n           At this point in time, I would recommend that\n           you identify specific monthly dates when you\n           two can get together and discuss results over\n           the previous thirty (30) days. The results\n           of those meetings should be summarized in\n           letter format and Judd should sign the letter\n           to acknowledge receipt. It is also important\n           that we provide Judd with written notice of\n           action that will be taken if the problems are\n           not corrected. I suggest summarizing your\n           meeting of August 19, acknowledge receipt by\n           Judd, and close the letter by stating, \"I\n           must emphasize to you that your failure to\n           permanently improve your work performance may\n           lead to more severe discipline, up to and\n           including discharge.\"\n\n           Attached for your review is a brief summary\n           of Judd's performance appraisals over the\n           last 15 years. I am disappointed that action\n           was not taken years ago to correct these\n           problems. It is apparent from the\n           performance appraisals that he has had\n           ongoing performance problems throughout his\n           employment history.\n\n           I am obviously concerned that we have to take\n           this type of action after 23 years of\n\n\n                                13\n\fdistrict court drew the only reasonable conclusion:   \"The\n\nstatement as to Brewer's age being a 'problem,' together with the\n\nnotations of his age and years of service, obviously indicate\n\nWeaver's awareness that Brewer might file an age discrimination\n\nlawsuit if terminated.\"   Id. at 684.\n\n           From the tone of the sentence and its placement in the\n\nmemorandum, it is clear that Brewer's age militates against his\n\nfiring.   The comment appears in a separate paragraph from the\n\ndiscussion of Brewer's employment problems.   Moreover, in\n\nWeaver's unrebutted deposition testimony, she stated that\n\nstandard procedures were followed in requiring documentation of\n\nBrewer's performance while on probation and that she highlighted\n\nBrewer's age to alert his supervisor to his protected status and\n\nto ensure that age was not the reason for termination.

Even if\n\nit were to be considered relevant, I do not believe that it would\n\ncreate a material issue of fact sufficient to warrant a denial of\n\nQuaker State's motion for summary judgment.
