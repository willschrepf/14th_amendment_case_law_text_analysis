Appellants are Plains Builders, Inc., and its surety Travelers Surety Company\n\nof America while appellees and cross-appellants are Steel Source, Inc., and Steel\n\nSource, a Division of Lloyd N. Moreau, L.L.C. (Steel Source).                Plains Builders\n\nchallenges an adverse money judgment in favor of Steel Source, Plains Builders and\n\nTravelers challenge a finding of liability on a payment bond, and Steel Source contends\n\nthe trial court failed to award the full amount of its actual damages. We will reverse in\n\npart and render judgment that Steel Source take nothing from Plains Builders and\n\fTravelers on the payment bond claim and otherwise affirm the judgment of the trial\n\ncourt.\n\n\n                                         Background\n\n\n         Plains Builders, as general contractor for the construction of the veterans’ home,\n\nsubcontracted with Construction Services, a proprietorship, to furnish material and labor\n\nfor the project. The recited value of the subcontract was $1,868,590. Construction\n\nServices in turn subcontracted to Steel Source a portion of the labor and materials it\n\nwas to supply. The value of the Construction Services--Steel Source subcontract was\n\n$880,000. Of this amount, the parties allocated $550,000 for materials and $330,000\n\nfor labor. After the contracts were signed, Plains Builders, Construction Services and\n\nSteel Source signed a joint check agreement providing:\n\n\n         Applicable to the products and services furnished by Construction\n         Services to [Plains Builders] . . . and as a condition precedent to furnishing\n         said materials for use and incorporation in the [veterans’ home project],\n         Construction Services requests that until it is paid in full, all payments\n         made or to be made by [Plains Builders] to Construction Services with\n         respect to this project, be made payable jointly to Construction Services\n         and [Steel Source]. It is understood that all payments shall be timely and\n         in the form of an immediate and unconditional instrument, specifically a\n         Cashier’s Check. Upon issuance of a check by [Plains Builders], it shall\n         be promptly (within 3 business days) endorsed by Construction Services\n         and delivered to [Steel Source]. It is understood that this is a continuing\n         Agreement applicable to the original contract sum and any subsequent\n         billing related to this project only.\n         Plains Builders issued five cashier’s checks made jointly payable to Construction\n\nServices and Steel Source. Construction Services refused to endorse each joint check\n\nunless at the time of its endorsement Steel Source simultaneously delivered a cashier’s\n\ncheck to Construction Services for a portion of the amount of the joint check.\n\n\n\n                                               2\n\f      As the veterans’ home project progressed, Construction Services began\n\nexperiencing significant cash flow problems.      Joint checks were issued by Plains\n\nBuilders in April and May 2006 for $125,557.83 and $125,337.49 respectively. At the\n\ntime, Steel Source had submitted a draw of $237,000 to Construction Services. Steel\n\nSource retained $50,000 from the April check and a like amount from the May check but\n\nreleased the balance to Construction Services. According to Steel Source, it did so\n\nbecause Construction Services insisted, and because of the risk that work on the entire\n\nproject would halt if Construction Services could not continue.\n\n\n      Through an undated letter bearing a June 1, 2006 fax date stamp, Construction\n\nServices then notified Plains Builders that it was “Discontinuing [the] joint checking\n\nagreement with [Steel Source].”        According to the letter, the reason for the\n\ndiscontinuance was, “Failure to complete punch out and reframing.           Construction\n\nService (sic) had to reframe a lot of walls, studs and misc. work.” At the time, Steel\n\nSource did not know Construction Services had sent the letter.\n\n\n      Following this notice letter, Plains Builders issued four checks totaling $80,000 to\n\nConstruction Services as the sole payee and four checks totaling $134,151.78 to\n\nConstruction Services and West Texas Builders, a supplier of materials, as joint payees.\n\n\n      Plains Builders finally discharged Construction Services from the veterans’ home\n\nproject and expended some $750,000 completing the work left unfinished and making\n\nup a payroll shortage of Construction Services. Steel Source asserted Construction\n\nServices failed to pay it amounts due totaling $137,300. According to Steel Source, had\n\n\n\n\n                                            3\n\fPlains Builders issued all checks due Construction Services according to the terms of\n\nthe joint check agreement, it would have received full payment.\n\n\n       Steel Source brought suit against Plains Builders, Travelers, and Construction\n\nServices.1 A default judgment was taken against Construction Services. Steel Source\n\nmoved for summary judgment on a claim that Plains Builders breached the joint check\n\nagreement to its damage. The trial court rendered a partial summary judgment in favor\n\nof Steel Source on liability but reserved the issue of damages for trial. After a bench\n\ntrial, the court rendered judgment in favor of Steel Source and jointly and severally\n\nagainst Plains Builders and Travelers on a claim for retainage in the principal amount of\n\n$33,000 and against Plains Builders in the principal sum of $80,000 on the breach of\n\nthe joint check agreement claim. Findings of fact and conclusions of law were filed.\n\nPlains Builders appeals and by cross-appeal Steel Source challenges the amount of\n\ndamages it was awarded.\n\n\n                                         Analysis\n\n\nAppeal of Plains Builders\n\n\n       Challenges to the Partial Summary Judgment\n\n\n       By its first issue, including multiple sub-issues, Plains Builders challenges the\n\ntrial court’s grant of partial summary judgment in favor of Steel Source.\n\n\n       We review the trial court’s summary judgment de novo. Valence Operating Co.\n\nv. Dorsett, 164 S.W.3d 656, 661 (Tex. 2005). A movant, on a traditional motion for\n\n       1\n       The record indicates in a separate suit Plains Builders obtained a default\njudgment in the amount of $752,392.35 against Construction Services.\n\n                                             4\n\fsummary judgment on affirmative claims, bears the initial burden of showing its\n\nentitlement to judgment as a matter of law by conclusively proving each element of its\n\ncause of action. M.D. Anderson Hosp. & Tumor Inst. v. Willrich, 28 S.W.3d 22, 23 (Tex.\n\n2000) (per curiam). Only if the movant satisfies this burden does the burden shift to the\n\nnon-movant to raise a genuine issue of material fact precluding summary judgment. Id.\n\n\n       A party seeking to recover for breach of a contract must prove: (1) the existence\n\nof a valid contract; (2) its performance or tender of performance; (3) the defendant’s\n\nbreach of the contract; and (4) damages sustained by the plaintiff as a result of the\n\nbreach. Valero Mktg. & Supply Co. v. Kalama, Int'l, 51 S.W.3d 345, 351 (Tex.App.--\n\nHouston [1st Dist.] 2001, no pet.).\n\n\n       Plains Builders first asserts that the joint check agreement is not an enforceable\n\ncontract because it lacks consideration.\n\n\n       Joint check arrangements may be initiated by parties at the top or bottom\n       of the contract claim. For example, the general contractor may wish to\n       insure that the party receiving the check (e.g., the subcontractor) will\n       properly disburse the proceeds of the check to his supplier or\n       subcontractors. In this manner the general contractor reduces the\n       chances that his subcontractor will pocket the money and leave the\n       supplier unpaid, thus provoking the supplier to file mechanic’s liens or\n       make claims against the general contractor's payment bond.\n       Similarly, the supplier or sub-subcontractor may initiate the joint check\n       arrangement to make sure that the subcontractor won’t run off with the\n       progress payments and leave him out in the cold. The supplier may\n       desire this arrangement because the subcontractor is in financial trouble\n       or lacks assets, or because he has never done business with the\n       subcontractor before. Sometimes, the supplier will request a joint check\n       arrangement out of simple mistrust of him.\nCity of Philadelphia for the use of Allied Roofers Supply Corp. v. Joseph S. Smith\n\nRoofing, Inc., 599 A.2d 222, 226 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1991) (quoting Barrett, Joint Check\n\n\n                                            5\n\fArrangements: A Release for the General Contractor and Its Surety, 8 Constr. Law. 7, 7\n\n(1988)).\n\n\n       A contract must be based on a valid consideration; that is, mutuality of obligation.\n\nFederal Sign v. Texas S. Univ., 951 S.W.2d 401, 408 (Tex. 1997). A contract lacking\n\nconsideration is unenforceable. Id. at 409.\n\n\n       Consideration is a present exchange bargained for in return for a promise.\n       It consists of either a benefit to the promisor or a detriment to the\n       promisee. The detriment must induce the making of the promise, and the\n       promise must induce the incurring of the detriment.\nRoark v. Stallworth Oil and Gas, Inc., 813 S.W.2d 492, 496 (Tex. 1991) (citations\n\nomitted); Minton v. Riverside State Bank, 399 S.W.2d 196, 198 (Tex.Civ.App.--Fort\n\nWorth 1966, no writ). What constitutes consideration for a contract is a question of law.\n\nBrownwood Ross Co. v. Maverick County, 936 S.W.2d 42, 45 (Tex.App.--San Antonio\n\n1996, writ denied). The existence of a written contract presumes consideration for its\n\nexecution; therefore, a party alleging lack of consideration bears the burden to rebut the\n\npresumption.    Doncaster v. Hernaiz, 161 S.W.3d 594, 603 (Tex.App.--San Antonio\n\n2005, no pet.); Tex. R. Civ. P. 94.\n\n\n       We do not find in the summary judgment record evidence sufficient to raise an\n\nissue of fact overcoming the presumption that sufficient consideration supported the\n\njoint check agreement. Moreover, by obligating itself to make payments by cashier’s\n\nchecks made payable jointly to Construction Services and Steel Source, Plains Builders\n\nincurred a detriment not otherwise required by its contract. In return, Plains Builders\n\nobtained a measure of security against a claim on its bond by Steel Source. And by the\n\nagreement, both Construction Services and Steel Source gained a measure of control\n\n\n                                              6\n\fover payments made by Plains Builders of funds destined for the other. And, while\n\nplaced in the position of having to receive and handle all funds paid Construction\n\nServices by Plains Builders, Steel Source gained a measure of assurance of payment\n\non its subcontract with Construction Services.         We find sufficient consideration\n\nsupported the joint check agreement.\n\n\n       Plains Builders next argues summary judgment was improper because by its own\n\nterms the joint check agreement is not applicable to goods or services provided the\n\nproject by Steel Source, and Plains Builders raised an issue of fact as to whether Steel\n\nSource sought as damages payment for goods or services it provided.                  The\n\ninterpretation of the joint check agreement, however, is a question of law. No one\n\nasserts on appeal it is ambiguous. Exxon Corp. v. Emerald Oil & Gas Co., 348 S.W.3d\n\n194, 214 (Tex. 2011) (op. on reh’g) (noting when ambiguity is not raised by the parties,\n\ninterpretation of a contract is a question of law).     And we are shown no disputed\n\nmaterial facts whose disposition is essential to the legal determination.\n\n\n       This particular joint check agreement does not contain provisions providing for\n\nallocation of the paid amounts between Construction Services and Steel Source; it\n\nmerely requires payment to them jointly and requires Construction Services’\n\nendorsement.     With regard to any issue of fact assertedly raised with regard to\n\ndamages, we note the trial court denied Steel Source’s motion for summary judgment\n\nas to the amount of damages.\n\n\n       Plains Builders next argues partial summary judgment was not proper because\n\nPlains Builders satisfied its obligations under the joint check agreement. It asserts the\n\n\n\n                                             7\n\fjoint check agreement ceased by its own terms when Construction Services was fully\n\npaid, and payment occurred “long before” Plains Builders stopped issuing joint checks.\n\n\n      The joint check agreement provides, “Construction Services requests that until it\n\nis paid in full, all payments made or to be made by [Plains Builders] to Construction\n\nServices with respect to this project, be made payable jointly to Construction Services\n\nand [Steel Source].”   Plains Builders reasons that because it ultimately terminated\n\nConstruction Services from the project and obtained a default judgment against it in the\n\namount of $752,392.35, it may offset that amount against the sums Construction\n\nServices was due under its subcontract, leaving Construction Services “fully paid” “long\n\nbefore” the alleged breach of the joint check agreement by Plains Builders.\n\n\n      For two reasons, we cannot agree this assertion precluded summary judgment\n\nthat Plains Builders breached the joint check agreement. First, the summary judgment\n\nrecord gives no indication that at the time Plains Builders issued checks to Construction\n\nServices contrary to the terms of the joint check agreement, Construction Services was\n\nfully paid. From the summary judgment record, it is undisputed that Plains Builders\n\ncomplied with the notice Construction Services sent terminating the joint check\n\nagreement.   Its response to Steel Source’s motion for summary judgment states it\n\ncomplied with the notice not because Construction Services was fully paid, but “[a]s the\n\n[joint check] agreement was for the benefit of Construction Services alone and because\n\nit did not prohibit the cancellation of the agreement[.]” Secondly, and similarly, we\n\ncannot see that the issue Plains Builders here asserts, that Construction Services was\n\n“paid in full” under the joint check agreement because Plains Builders later incurred\n\ncosts to remedy its failure of performance under the construction contract, was\n\n                                            8\n\fexpressly presented in its response to the motion for summary judgment. See Tex. R.\n\nCiv. P. 166a(c); McConnell v. Southside Indep. Sch. Dist., 858 S.W.2d 337, 341 (Tex.\n\n1993) (requiring issues non-movant contends avoid movant’s entitlement to summary\n\njudgment to be “expressly presented”).\n\n\n      Plains Builders next argues it raised an issue of fact supporting its affirmative\n\ndefense of payment. Plains Builders’ checks made jointly payable to Steel Source and\n\nConstruction Services totaled $1,223,275.71. Steel Source deposited these checks to\n\nits bank account.   But it ultimately received only $806,410 because it remitted the\n\nremaining amount totaling $417,165.71 to Construction Services via cashier’s checks.\n\nThe maximum claim of Steel Source under its subcontract with Construction Services\n\nwas $943,410. The fact it issued joint checks in amounts substantially more than Steel\n\nSource’s maximum claim, Plains Builders argues, supports its affirmative defense of\n\npayment.\n\n\n      What Plains Builders is asserting here is application of the “joint check rule,”\n\nwhich has expressly been adopted by several states. As restated by the California\n\nSupreme Court, the rule is that “[w]hen a subcontractor and his materialman are joint\n\npayees, and no agreement exists with the owner or general contractor as to allocation\n\nof proceeds, the materialman by endorsing the check will be deemed to have received\n\nthe money due him.” Post Bros. Constr. Co. v. Yoder, 20 Cal. 3d 1, 141 Cal. Rptr. 28,\n\n569 P.2d 133, 135 (1977); see Brown Wholesale Elec. Co. v. Beztak of Scottsdale, 163\n\nAriz. 340, 788 P.2d 73, 76 (1990) (“when an owner or general contractor makes a\n\nmaterialman and a subcontractor joint payees on a check that includes payment for\n\nlabor and materials furnished, and no other agreement exists between the materialman\n\n                                          9\n\fand the owner or general contractor as to allocation of the proceeds, the materialman,\n\nby endorsing the check, will be deemed to have been paid the money due him, up to the\n\namount of the joint check”); SFR, Inc. v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co., 2008 UT\n\nApp 31, ¶¶22, 177 P.3d 629; Anchor Concrete Co. v. Victor Sav. & Loan Ass’n, 1983\n\nOK 60, 664 P.2d 396, 399 (applying rule). Among the cases cited by the Arizona, Utah\n\nand Oklahoma courts in support of the rule is the opinion of Justice Barrow in F. & C.\n\nEngineering Co. v. Moore, 300 S.W.2d 323 (Tex.Civ.App.--San Antonio 1957, writ ref’d\n\nn.r.e.). Brown Wholesale Elec., 788 P.2d at 76; SFR, Inc., 177 P.3d at 635; Anchor\n\nConcrete, 664 P.2d at 398.2\n\n\n      The cases we have reviewed in which the joint check rule has been applied are\n\ncases enforcing materialmen’s liens or bonds securing payment or performance of the\n\nconstruction contract.   See, e.g., F. & C. Engineering, 300 S.W.2d at 324; Brown\n\nWholesale Elec., 788 P.2d at 74; Post Bros. Constr. Co., 569 P.2d 134. Our case, a\n\nsuit based on breach of a joint check agreement, differs in that respect from all others\n\nwe have reviewed. As noted, the joint check agreement the parties here signed does\n\nnot address the subject of allocation of a check’s proceeds between Construction\n\nServices and Steel Source. We agree with Steel Source that Plains Builders’ argument\n\nin effect asks us to read into the joint check agreement a provision it does not contain.\n\nIn the absence of contract language warranting the inference Steel Source had an\n\nobligation to retain funds necessary to keep its account current from each joint check as\n\n\n\n\n      2\n         As the Arizona court pointed out in Brown Wholesale Electric, 788 P.2d at 76,\nfederal courts have generally not followed the joint check rule in cases under the Miller\nAct, 40 U.S.C. § 270b.\n\n                                           10\n\fissued, Cf. F. & C. Engineering, 300 S.W.2d at 326, we will not apply the joint check\n\nrule to support Plains Builders’ payment defense.\n\n\n       Plains Builders next asserts Steel Source waived the right to recover damages\n\nfor breach of the joint check agreement. Like its payment defense, Plains Builders’\n\nwaiver argument is based on Steel Source’s remission to Construction Services of parts\n\nof the proceeds of the joint checks issued in April and May 2006.\n\n\n       Waiver is the intentional relinquishment of a known right or intentional conduct\n\ninconsistent with claiming it. Massachusetts Bonding & Ins. Co. v. Orkin Exterminating\n\nCo., Inc., 416 S.W.2d 396, 401 (Tex. 1967). Thus, establishing waiver of a contract\n\nright requires proof of intent to relinquish the right. Johnson v. Structured Asset Servs.,\n\nLLC, 148 S.W.3d 711, 723 (Tex.App.--Dallas 2004, no pet.) (citing Huffington v.\n\nUpchurch, 532 S.W.2d 576, 580 (Tex. 1976)). We reiterate our observation that the\n\njoint check agreement the parties signed required joint payment but did not contain\n\nprovisions addressing the division of a check’s proceeds between the joint payees. In\n\nthe absence of such provisions, and without application of the joint check rule, 3 we see\n\nin Steel Source’s decision to permit Construction Services to retain part of the proceeds\n\nof the April and May joint checks no evidence of an intent on the part of Steel Source to\n\nrelinquish its right to insist on Plains Builders’ further compliance with the agreement, or\n\nits right to seek damages for its breach.\n\n\n\n\n       3\n        Some courts have characterized the effect of the joint check rule as a waiver by\nthe materialman of any claim against the payor to the amount of the joint check not\nretained by the materialman. See SFR, Inc., 177 P.3d at 635.\n\n                                            11\n\f       Plains Builders next asserts it presented evidence raising an issue of fact on a\n\ntheory that Steel Source is estopped to assert its claim against Plains Builders. The\n\nnub of the argument is “Steel Source should be estopped from asserting such claims\n\nbecause it knowingly concealed facts from Plains Builders that Plains Builders was\n\nentitled to know about. Had Plains Builders been made aware of this situation and the\n\nnew agreement which Steel Source and Construction Services had entered into\n\nconcerning payment from Construction Services to Steel Source, it could have ensured\n\nthat the monies were properly paid.”\n\n\n       Generally, equitable estoppel arises from conduct causing another party to\n\nmaterially alter its position in reliance on that conduct.

A party claiming an estoppel\n\nmust prove: (1) a false representation or concealment of material facts, (2) made with\n\nknowledge, actual or constructive, of those facts, (3) with the intention that it should be\n\nacted on, (4) to a party without knowledge or a means of obtaining knowledge of the\n\nfacts, (5) who detrimentally relies on the representation. Id. at *9-10. A party may be\n\nestopped by its silence but only if it is “under a duty to speak, but refrains from doing so\n\nand thereby leads another to act in reliance on a mistaken understanding of the facts.”\n\nCasa El Sol-Acapulco, S.A. v. Fontenot, 919 S.W.2d 709, 718 (Tex.App.--Houston [14th\n\nDist.] 1996, writ dism’d by agr.).     Here, the summary judgment record contains no\n\nevidence that Steel Source had a legal duty to disclose to Plains Builders how they\n\nallocated the proceeds of the joint checks between them. Cf. Hoggett v. Brown, 971\n\nS.W.2d 472, 487 (Tex.App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 1997, pet. denied) (citing Formosa\n\n\n                                            12\n\fPlastics Corp. v.

We agree.\n\n\n      Among its theories of recovery, Steel Source alleged Plains Builders and\n\nTravelers were jointly and severally liable for damages on Plains Builders’ payment\n\nbond underwritten by Travelers. In the judgment, the trial court made two damage\n\nawards. As noted, Steel Source was awarded $80,000 for breach of the joint check\n\nagreement. Germaine to the present issue, Steel Source was also awarded $33,000,\n\njointly and severally against Plains Builders and Travelers, for retainage on the payment\n\nbond claim.\n\n\n      “Chapter 2253 of the Texas Government Code, historically called the McGregor\n\nAct, requires a prime contractor on a public-work contract to execute a payment bond to\n\n      4\n         As with its payment and waiver theories, Plains Builders’ estoppel argument\nessentially is an effort to impose the joint check rule on the parties’ joint check\nagreement. Some courts have used estoppel to characterize the operation of the joint\ncheck rule, explaining that the material supplier, whose conduct has rendered the injury\npossible, is estopped from imposing the loss on the general contractor. See Starkey\nConstr., Inc. v. Elcon, Inc., 248 Ark. 958, 457 S.W.2d 509 (1970); City Lumber Co. v.\nNational Surety Corp., 229 S.C. 115, 92 S.E.2d 128, 131 (1956).\n\n                                            13\n\fprotect laborers and materialmen who work on or supply materials for the project.”\n\nDealers Elec. Supply Co. v. Scoggins Constr. Co., 292 S.W.3d 650, 652 (Tex. 2009);\n\nTex. Gov’t Code Ann. §§ 2253.001-.079 (West 2008 & Supp. 2012). The McGregor Act\n\ndefines “retainage” as the part of the payments under a public work contract that are not\n\nrequired to be paid within the month following the month in which public work labor is\n\nperformed or public work material is delivered under the contract. Tex. Gov’t Code Ann.\n\n§ 2253.001(7) (West 2008). To recover in a suit under § 2253.073 on a payment bond\n\nfor a claim for payment of retainage, a payment bond beneficiary whose contract with a\n\nprime contractor or subcontractor provides for retainage must mail written notice of the\n\nclaim on a payment bond to the prime contractor and the surety on or before 90 days\n\nafter the final completion of the public works contract. Tex. Gov’t Code Ann. § 2253.046\n\n(West 2008).\n\n\n      However, a payment bond beneficiary that does not have a direct contractual\n\nrelationship with the prime contractor for public work labor or material must give\n\n“additional notice” in order to recover in a suit under § 2253.073 on a payment bond.\n\nTex. Gov’t Code Ann. § 2253.047(a) (West 2008). A payment bond beneficiary who\n\ncontracts with a subcontractor for retainage must mail, on or before the 15th day of the\n\nsecond month after the date of the beginning of the delivery of public work material or\n\nthe performance of public work labor, written notice to the prime contractor that the\n\ncontract provides for retainage, and generally indicates the nature of the retainage.\n\nTex. Gov’t Code Ann. § 2253.047(b) (West 2008). The payment bond beneficiary must\n\nmail, on or before the 15th day of the second month after each month in which the labor\n\nwas performed or the material was delivered, written notice to the prime contractor of a\n\n\n                                           14\n\fclaim for any unpaid public work labor performed or public work material delivered. A\n\ncopy of the statement sent to a subcontractor is sufficient notice. Tex. Gov’t Code Ann.\n\n§ 2253.047(b) (West 2008).\n\n\n      The additional notice required for recovery by a payment bond beneficiary not\n\nhaving a direct contractual relationship with the prime contractor avoids a possible\n\ndouble payment obligation befalling a prime contractor and its surety when neither is\n\naware of a subcontractor’s retainage agreement with a claimant until after final\n\ncompletion of the contract.   See Keetch Metal Works of Dallas, Inc. v. Yates, 378\n\nS.W.2d 122, 124-25 & 125 n.1 (Tex.Civ.App.--Dallas 1964, no writ) (presenting\n\nhypothetical fact pattern illustrating consequence when prime contractor and surety are\n\nunaware of subcontractor’s retainage agreement with claimant).\n\n\n      Steel Source asserts it is not subject to the additional notice requirement of §\n\n2253.047 because it had a direct contractual relationship with Plains Builders. It argues\n\nthe joint check agreement established the direct contractual relationship. We think the\n\nargument ignores the plain language of the McGregor Act. See FKM P’ship Ltd. v. Bd.\n\nof Regents of the Univ. of Houston Sys., 255 S.W.3d 619, 633 (Tex. 2008) (construing a\n\nstatute, court ascertains and gives effect to Legislature’s intent as expressed by its\n\nlanguage).\n\n\n      Steel Source’s retainage claim was for its labor. Section 2253.073 authorizes\n\nsuit by a “payment bond beneficiary who has provided public work labor or material\n\nunder a public work contract for which a payment bond is furnished under this chapter.”\n\n“Public work labor” is defined as “labor used directly to carry out a public work.” Tex.\n\n\n\n                                           15\n\fGov’t Code Ann. § 2253.001(5) (West 2008). The additional notice requirement of §\n\n2253.047 applies to a payment bond beneficiary “who does not have a direct\n\ncontractual relationship with the prime contractor for public work labor or material.” The\n\njoint check agreement was not a contract between Steel Source and Plains Builders for\n\nlabor used directly to carry out construction of the veterans’ home. Steel Source had a\n\ncontract for that purpose, but its direct contractual relationship for supplying labor and\n\nmaterials was with Construction Services, not the prime contractor. Cf. Dial Block Co.,\n\nInc. v. Mastro Masonry Contractors, 374 N.J. Super. 13, 863 A.2d 373, 378-79 (App.\n\nDiv. 2004) (discussing and citing federal cases finding joint check agreement does not\n\ncreate direct contractual relationship required by federal Miller Act).\n\n\n       Because no direct contractual relationship existed between Plains Builders and\n\nSteel Source for its public work labor, the notice requirements of § 2253.047 apply to\n\nSteel Source’s McGregor Act claim for retainage.\n\n\n       Steel Source submitted a draw for labor performed on the project during\n\nDecember 2005.      Thus its notice under § 2253.047(b) to Plains Builders was due\n\nFebruary 15, 2006. The earliest potential notice Steel Source points to in the record is a\n\nfax it sent Plains Builders dated March 1, 2006. Even were we to accept Steel Source’s\n\nargument the fax could satisfy § 2253.047, it was not timely notice. Tex. Gov’t Code\n\nAnn. § 2253.047(b) (West 2008).\n\n\n       We sustain the third issue of Plains Builders. Steel Source will take nothing by\n\nits claim against Plains Builders and Travelers for retainage on the payment bond.\n\n\nDamages and Attorney’s Fees\n\n\n                                             16\n\f      In its fourth issue, Plains Builders argues the trial court awarded a double\n\nrecovery for breach of contract damages and retainage, the trial court’s findings\n\nimproperly incorporated its interlocutory summary judgment order, and no evidence\n\nsupported an award of attorney’s fees.\n\n\n      Because we will render judgment that Steel Source take nothing on its McGregor\n\nAct claim, we dismiss as moot Plains Builders’ sub-issue claiming Steel Source\n\nreceived an improper double recovery from the McGregor Act award of $33,000 and\n\n$80,000 for breach of the joint check agreement. See Trulock v. City of Duncanville,\n\n277 S.W.3d 920, 924 (Tex.App.--Dallas 2009, no pet.) (explaining mootness on appeal).\n\n\n      Plains Builders complains the trial court erred by making a conclusion of law\n\nincorporating by reference its interlocutory summary judgment. As a general statement,\n\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law are not appropriate under summary judgment\n\nprocedure because “if summary judgment is proper, there are no facts to find, and the\n\nlegal conclusions have already been stated in the motion and response. The trial court\n\nshould not make, and an appellate court cannot consider, findings of fact in connection\n\nwith a summary judgment.” IKB Industries (Nigeria) Ltd. v. Pro-Line Corp., 938 S.W.2d\n\n440, 441 (Tex. 1997).    But the thrust of the complaint seems to be the trial court\n\ndetermined the breach of the joint check agreement by summary judgment but revisited\n\nthe issue at trial. Even were we to assume the trial court erred by incorporating its\n\nsummary judgment order into its post-trial conclusions of law, this record does not show\n\nthe error was harmful. Tex. R. App. P. 44.1(a). We overrule this sub-issue.\n\n\n\n\n                                          17\n\f      Plains Builders next argues the trial court erred in awarding Steel Source\n\nattorney’s fees because Steel Source failed to segregate recoverable attorney’s fees\n\nfrom nonrecoverable fees and did not offer evidence meeting the Andersen factors.\n\nSee Arthur Andersen & Co. v. Perry Equip. Corp., 945 S.W.2d 812, 818 (Tex. 1997).\n\n\n      Each of the two theories on which the trial court awarded Steel Source damages\n\nalso authorized recovery of attorney’s fees.5 The attorney for Steel Source testified to\n\nthe reasonableness and necessity of the attorney’s fees sought, expressing his opinion\n\nthat $34,200 was a reasonable and necessary fee. The parties stipulated that the\n\nhourly fee rate charged by Steel Source’s attorney was reasonable.          The attorney\n\nfurther testified a reduction in the total fee of ten percent would sufficiently segregate\n\nwork for which fees were recoverable from work for which they were not.6 The trial\n\ncourt found the attorney for Steel Source “properly segregated the attorney’s fees and\n\nlimited the amount of attorney’s fees requested to claims for which such fees are\n\nallowed by law.” The trial court further found $30,800 was a reasonable and necessary\n\nattorney’s fee for the services of Steel Source’s attorney in the trial court but further\n\nreduced the award to a total of $27,607.50 for such services.\n\n\n      In this bench trial, we think from the presentations of both sides the court was\n\nsufficiently apprised of the novelty and difficulty of the issues involved.    The court\n\nreceived in evidence the detailed billing statements prepared by Steel Source’s\n\nattorney. These identify the person performing the work and contain a brief description\n\n      5\n        Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 38.001(8) (West 2008); Tex. Gov’t Code\nAnn. § 2253.073(b)(2) (West 2008).\n      6\n         See Tony Gullo Motors I, L.P. v. Chapa, 212 S.W.3d 299, 313-14 (Tex. 2006)\n(approving evidence segregating fees by percentages).\n\n                                           18\n\fof the work including the date, the amount of time spent on the task, the hourly billing\n\nrate applicable to the person performing the work, and the fee for the identified work.\n\nSteel Source’s attorney was admitted to practice in Texas in 1985 and is board certified\n\nin civil appellate law. While the evidence did not touch on each of the Andersen factors,\n\nevidence of each of the factors was not required for the trial court to determine the\n\nreasonableness of the fees. Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. v. Dieterich, 270 S.W.3d 695,\n\n706 (Tex.App.--Dallas 2008, no pet.) (citing Lamajak, Inc., 230 S.W. 3d at 797).\n\n\n       On appeal Plains Builders also argues the award of attorney’s fees must be\n\nreversed if we reverse one of the monetary awards for the breach of contract or\n\nMcGregor Act claims because Steel Source did not segregate its fees between those\n\nclaims. As the trial court found, attorney’s fees were recoverable under either claim.\n\nWe do not understand the authority Plains Builders cites, which includes Gullo and\n\nKosberg v. Brown, 601 S.W.2d 414 (Tex.Civ.App.--Dallas 1980, no writ), to require\n\nsegregation of fees in this circumstance. We overrule Plains Builders’ sub-issue\n\nchallenging the award of attorney’s fees.\n\n\nCross-Appeal of Steel Source\n\n\n       By a single issue on cross-appeal, Steel Source argues the trial court erred by\n\nawarding it $80,000 on its breach of the joint check agreement claim rather than the\n\n$137,300 it sought. It points to the trial court’s finding of fact that it furnished labor to\n\nthe project for which it was not paid, totaling $137,300. But Steel Source was not\n\nentitled to damages measured by its loss under its contract with Construction Services,\n\nbut those resulting from Plains Builders’ breach of the joint check agreement, in other\n\n\n\n                                             19\n\fwords, those damages that were the natural, probable and foreseeable consequence of\n\nits failure to include Steel Source as a joint payee on eight checks. See Abraxas Petro.\n\nCorp. v. Hornburg, 20 S.W.3d 741, 758 (Tex.App.--El Paso 2000, no pet.) (standard for\n\ndamages for breach of contract). Steel Source’s contention in support of its cross-\n\nappeal essentially is that the trial court’s $80,000 award of damages for breach of the\n\njoint check agreement is not supported by factually sufficient evidence. Conducting\n\nsuch an analysis, we keep in mind the role of the trial court as trier of fact and sole\n\njudge of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight given their testimony, Rego Co.\n\nv. Brannon, 682 S.W.2d 677, 680 (Tex.App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 1984, writ ref’d n.r.e.),\n\nand keep in mind we may not substitute our opinion for that of the trier of fact merely\n\nbecause we might have reached a different conclusion. Herbert v. Herbert, 754 S.W.2d\n\n141, 144 (Tex. 1988). We first examine all of the evidence, Lofton v. Texas Brine Corp.,\n\n720 S.W.2d 804, 805 (Tex. 1986), and, having considered and weighed all of the\n\nevidence, set aside the verdict only if the evidence is so weak or the finding is so\n\nagainst the great weight and preponderance of the evidence that it is clearly wrong and\n\nunjust. Cain v. Bain, 709 S.W.2d 175, 176 (Tex. 1986); Garza v. Alviar, 395 S.W.2d\n\n821, 823 (Tex. 1965).\n\n\n      Here, the evidence shows that including Steel Source as a joint payee was not a\n\nguarantee it ultimately would receive any particular amount. Other payees had their\n\nclaims on the funds, and business considerations came into play when the joint payees\n\nallocated the check amounts between them.          Steel Source allowed Construction\n\nServices to retain funds from the April and May 2006 joint checks not because it was\n\nentitled to them but because Construction Services insisted and Steel Source feared it\n\n\n                                          20\n\fotherwise would be unable to continue work.            The difficulty of evaluating the\n\nconsequences of failing to include Steel Source as a payee on the final four checks is\n\nparticularly great because, if Steel Source had been included, the checks would have\n\nhad three payees.\n\n\n       After reviewing all of the evidence, we conclude that the trial court’s damage\n\naward is not against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence, nor is it\n\nclearly wrong or unjust. See Cain, 709 S.W.2d at 176. We overrule Steel Source’s sole\n\nissue on cross-appeal.\n\n\n                                        Conclusion\n\n\n       We reverse and render judgment that Steel Source take nothing on its bond\n\nclaim for retainage from Plains Builders and Travelers. Otherwise, having overruled or\n\ndismissed the issues of Plains Builders and the sole issue of Steel Source on cross-\n\nappeal, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  James T.

Appellants are Plains Builders, Inc., and its surety Travelers Surety Company\n\nof America while appellees and cross-appellants are Steel Source, Inc., and Steel\n\nSource, a Division of Lloyd N. Moreau, L.L.C. (Steel Source).                Plains Builders\n\nchallenges an adverse money judgment in favor of Steel Source, Plains Builders and\n\nTravelers challenge a finding of liability on a payment bond, and Steel Source contends\n\nthe trial court failed to award the full amount of its actual damages. We will reverse in\n\npart and render judgment that Steel Source take nothing from Plains Builders and\n\fTravelers on the payment bond claim and otherwise affirm the judgment of the trial\n\ncourt.\n\n\n                                         Background\n\n\n         Plains Builders, as general contractor for the construction of the veterans’ home,\n\nsubcontracted with Construction Services, a proprietorship, to furnish material and labor\n\nfor the project. The recited value of the subcontract was $1,868,590. Construction\n\nServices in turn subcontracted to Steel Source a portion of the labor and materials it\n\nwas to supply. The value of the Construction Services--Steel Source subcontract was\n\n$880,000. Of this amount, the parties allocated $550,000 for materials and $330,000\n\nfor labor. After the contracts were signed, Plains Builders, Construction Services and\n\nSteel Source signed a joint check agreement providing:\n\n\n         Applicable to the products and services furnished by Construction\n         Services to [Plains Builders] . . . and as a condition precedent to furnishing\n         said materials for use and incorporation in the [veterans’ home project],\n         Construction Services requests that until it is paid in full, all payments\n         made or to be made by [Plains Builders] to Construction Services with\n         respect to this project, be made payable jointly to Construction Services\n         and [Steel Source]. It is understood that all payments shall be timely and\n         in the form of an immediate and unconditional instrument, specifically a\n         Cashier’s Check. Upon issuance of a check by [Plains Builders], it shall\n         be promptly (within 3 business days) endorsed by Construction Services\n         and delivered to [Steel Source]. It is understood that this is a continuing\n         Agreement applicable to the original contract sum and any subsequent\n         billing related to this project only.\n         Plains Builders issued five cashier’s checks made jointly payable to Construction\n\nServices and Steel Source. Construction Services refused to endorse each joint check\n\nunless at the time of its endorsement Steel Source simultaneously delivered a cashier’s\n\ncheck to Construction Services for a portion of the amount of the joint check.\n\n\n\n                                               2\n\f      As the veterans’ home project progressed, Construction Services began\n\nexperiencing significant cash flow problems.      Joint checks were issued by Plains\n\nBuilders in April and May 2006 for $125,557.83 and $125,337.49 respectively. At the\n\ntime, Steel Source had submitted a draw of $237,000 to Construction Services. Steel\n\nSource retained $50,000 from the April check and a like amount from the May check but\n\nreleased the balance to Construction Services. According to Steel Source, it did so\n\nbecause Construction Services insisted, and because of the risk that work on the entire\n\nproject would halt if Construction Services could not continue.\n\n\n      Through an undated letter bearing a June 1, 2006 fax date stamp, Construction\n\nServices then notified Plains Builders that it was “Discontinuing [the] joint checking\n\nagreement with [Steel Source].”        According to the letter, the reason for the\n\ndiscontinuance was, “Failure to complete punch out and reframing.

Moreover, by obligating itself to make payments by cashier’s\n\nchecks made payable jointly to Construction Services and Steel Source, Plains Builders\n\nincurred a detriment not otherwise required by its contract.

And we are shown no disputed\n\nmaterial facts whose disposition is essential to the legal determination.\n\n\n       This particular joint check agreement does not contain provisions providing for\n\nallocation of the paid amounts between Construction Services and Steel Source; it\n\nmerely requires payment to them jointly and requires Construction Services’\n\nendorsement.     With regard to any issue of fact assertedly raised with regard to\n\ndamages, we note the trial court denied Steel Source’s motion for summary judgment\n\nas to the amount of damages.\n\n\n       Plains Builders next argues partial summary judgment was not proper because\n\nPlains Builders satisfied its obligations under the joint check agreement. It asserts the\n\n\n\n                                             7\n\fjoint check agreement ceased by its own terms when Construction Services was fully\n\npaid, and payment occurred “long before” Plains Builders stopped issuing joint checks.\n\n\n      The joint check agreement provides, “Construction Services requests that until it\n\nis paid in full, all payments made or to be made by [Plains Builders] to Construction\n\nServices with respect to this project, be made payable jointly to Construction Services\n\nand [Steel Source].”   Plains Builders reasons that because it ultimately terminated\n\nConstruction Services from the project and obtained a default judgment against it in the\n\namount of $752,392.35, it may offset that amount against the sums Construction\n\nServices was due under its subcontract, leaving Construction Services “fully paid” “long\n\nbefore” the alleged breach of the joint check agreement by Plains Builders.\n\n\n      For two reasons, we cannot agree this assertion precluded summary judgment\n\nthat Plains Builders breached the joint check agreement. First, the summary judgment\n\nrecord gives no indication that at the time Plains Builders issued checks to Construction\n\nServices contrary to the terms of the joint check agreement, Construction Services was\n\nfully paid. From the summary judgment record, it is undisputed that Plains Builders\n\ncomplied with the notice Construction Services sent terminating the joint check\n\nagreement.   Its response to Steel Source’s motion for summary judgment states it\n\ncomplied with the notice not because Construction Services was fully paid, but “[a]s the\n\n[joint check] agreement was for the benefit of Construction Services alone and because\n\nit did not prohibit the cancellation of the agreement[.]” Secondly, and similarly, we\n\ncannot see that the issue Plains Builders here asserts, that Construction Services was\n\n“paid in full” under the joint check agreement because Plains Builders later incurred\n\ncosts to remedy its failure of performance under the construction contract, was\n\n                                            8\n\fexpressly presented in its response to the motion for summary judgment.

Plains Builders’ checks made jointly payable to Steel Source and\n\nConstruction Services totaled $1,223,275.71. Steel Source deposited these checks to\n\nits bank account.   But it ultimately received only $806,410 because it remitted the\n\nremaining amount totaling $417,165.71 to Construction Services via cashier’s checks.\n\nThe maximum claim of Steel Source under its subcontract with Construction Services\n\nwas $943,410. The fact it issued joint checks in amounts substantially more than Steel\n\nSource’s maximum claim, Plains Builders argues, supports its affirmative defense of\n\npayment.\n\n\n      What Plains Builders is asserting here is application of the “joint check rule,”\n\nwhich has expressly been adopted by several states. As restated by the California\n\nSupreme Court, the rule is that “[w]hen a subcontractor and his materialman are joint\n\npayees, and no agreement exists with the owner or general contractor as to allocation\n\nof proceeds, the materialman by endorsing the check will be deemed to have received\n\nthe money due him.” Post Bros.

Our case, a\n\nsuit based on breach of a joint check agreement, differs in that respect from all others\n\nwe have reviewed. As noted, the joint check agreement the parties here signed does\n\nnot address the subject of allocation of a check’s proceeds between Construction\n\nServices and Steel Source. We agree with Steel Source that Plains Builders’ argument\n\nin effect asks us to read into the joint check agreement a provision it does not contain.\n\nIn the absence of contract language warranting the inference Steel Source had an\n\nobligation to retain funds necessary to keep its account current from each joint check as\n\n\n\n\n      2\n         As the Arizona court pointed out in Brown Wholesale Electric, 788 P.2d at 76,\nfederal courts have generally not followed the joint check rule in cases under the Miller\nAct, 40 U.S.C. § 270b.\n\n                                           10\n\fissued, Cf.

Like its payment defense, Plains Builders’\n\nwaiver argument is based on Steel Source’s remission to Construction Services of parts\n\nof the proceeds of the joint checks issued in April and May 2006.\n\n\n       Waiver is the intentional relinquishment of a known right or intentional conduct\n\ninconsistent with claiming it.

We reiterate our observation that the\n\njoint check agreement the parties signed required joint payment but did not contain\n\nprovisions addressing the division of a check’s proceeds between the joint payees. In\n\nthe absence of such provisions, and without application of the joint check rule, 3 we see\n\nin Steel Source’s decision to permit Construction Services to retain part of the proceeds\n\nof the April and May joint checks no evidence of an intent on the part of Steel Source to\n\nrelinquish its right to insist on Plains Builders’ further compliance with the agreement, or\n\nits right to seek damages for its breach.\n\n\n\n\n       3\n        Some courts have characterized the effect of the joint check rule as a waiver by\nthe materialman of any claim against the payor to the amount of the joint check not\nretained by the materialman.

The\n\nnub of the argument is “Steel Source should be estopped from asserting such claims\n\nbecause it knowingly concealed facts from Plains Builders that Plains Builders was\n\nentitled to know about. Had Plains Builders been made aware of this situation and the\n\nnew agreement which Steel Source and Construction Services had entered into\n\nconcerning payment from Construction Services to Steel Source, it could have ensured\n\nthat the monies were properly paid.”\n\n\n       Generally, equitable estoppel arises from conduct causing another party to\n\nmaterially alter its position in reliance on that conduct.

We agree.\n\n\n      Among its theories of recovery, Steel Source alleged Plains Builders and\n\nTravelers were jointly and severally liable for damages on Plains Builders’ payment\n\nbond underwritten by Travelers. In the judgment, the trial court made two damage\n\nawards. As noted, Steel Source was awarded $80,000 for breach of the joint check\n\nagreement. Germaine to the present issue, Steel Source was also awarded $33,000,\n\njointly and severally against Plains Builders and Travelers, for retainage on the payment\n\nbond claim.\n\n\n      “Chapter 2253 of the Texas Government Code, historically called the McGregor\n\nAct, requires a prime contractor on a public-work contract to execute a payment bond to\n\n      4\n         As with its payment and waiver theories, Plains Builders’ estoppel argument\nessentially is an effort to impose the joint check rule on the parties’ joint check\nagreement.

Gov’t Code Ann. §§ 2253.001-.079 (West 2008 & Supp. 2012). The McGregor Act\n\ndefines “retainage” as the part of the payments under a public work contract that are not\n\nrequired to be paid within the month following the month in which public work labor is\n\nperformed or public work material is delivered under the contract. Tex. Gov’t Code Ann.\n\n§ 2253.001(7) (West 2008). To recover in a suit under § 2253.073 on a payment bond\n\nfor a claim for payment of retainage, a payment bond beneficiary whose contract with a\n\nprime contractor or subcontractor provides for retainage must mail written notice of the\n\nclaim on a payment bond to the prime contractor and the surety on or before 90 days\n\nafter the final completion of the public works contract. Tex. Gov’t Code Ann. § 2253.046\n\n(West 2008).\n\n\n      However, a payment bond beneficiary that does not have a direct contractual\n\nrelationship with the prime contractor for public work labor or material must give\n\n“additional notice” in order to recover in a suit under § 2253.073 on a payment bond.\n\nTex. Gov’t Code Ann. § 2253.047(a) (West 2008). A payment bond beneficiary who\n\ncontracts with a subcontractor for retainage must mail, on or before the 15th day of the\n\nsecond month after the date of the beginning of the delivery of public work material or\n\nthe performance of public work labor, written notice to the prime contractor that the\n\ncontract provides for retainage, and generally indicates the nature of the retainage.\n\nTex. Gov’t Code Ann. § 2253.047(b) (West 2008). The payment bond beneficiary must\n\nmail, on or before the 15th day of the second month after each month in which the labor\n\nwas performed or the material was delivered, written notice to the prime contractor of a\n\n\n                                           14\n\fclaim for any unpaid public work labor performed or public work material delivered. A\n\ncopy of the statement sent to a subcontractor is sufficient notice. Tex.

The parties stipulated that the\n\nhourly fee rate charged by Steel Source’s attorney was reasonable.          The attorney\n\nfurther testified a reduction in the total fee of ten percent would sufficiently segregate\n\nwork for which fees were recoverable from work for which they were not.6 The trial\n\ncourt found the attorney for Steel Source “properly segregated the attorney’s fees and\n\nlimited the amount of attorney’s fees requested to claims for which such fees are\n\nallowed by law.” The trial court further found $30,800 was a reasonable and necessary\n\nattorney’s fee for the services of Steel Source’s attorney in the trial court but further\n\nreduced the award to a total of $27,607.50 for such services.\n\n\n      In this bench trial, we think from the presentations of both sides the court was\n\nsufficiently apprised of the novelty and difficulty of the issues involved.

Steel Source allowed Construction\n\nServices to retain funds from the April and May 2006 joint checks not because it was\n\nentitled to them but because Construction Services insisted and Steel Source feared it\n\n\n                                          20\n\fotherwise would be unable to continue work.
