For the reasons that follow, we will affirm the\n\norder of the District Court.\n\n       The parties are familiar with the facts, thus we only briefly recite them here. On\n\fApril 28, 2003, a call was placed from FCI-Ft. Dix using the PIN number of inmate\n\nJamelle Peters. Prison officials monitored the call, believing that Garrett was\n\nimpermissibly using Peters’ PIN to make calls while he was on phone restriction. During\n\nthe conversation, the inmate placing the call mentioned that it was his birthday the\n\nfollowing day. It was in fact Garrett’s birthday. The caller also asked to see “Karen.”\n\nNot only is there a Karen on Garrett’s visitor list, the person receiving the call referred to\n\nthe caller as “Rab,” Garrett’s nickname. Garrett appeared before a disciplinary hearing\n\nofficer (DHO) on charges of phone abuses and refusing to accept program assignments.\n\nGarrett requested a staff representative and asked to call Peters as a witness. The DHO\n\npostponed the hearing to accommodate the requests. At the subsequent hearing, Garrett\n\nwaived his right to representation and to call Peters. The DHO found that Garrett placed\n\nthe call and sanctioned him with an aggregate of 67 days disallowance of good-conduct\n\ntime, 139 days forfeiture of non-vested good-conduct time, a six-year loss of visiting and\n\nphone privileges, and 90 days of disciplinary segregation.\n\n       After exhausting his administrative remedies, Garrett brought the instant petition\n\nalleging due process violations for the denial of his request to present Peters as a witness\n\nand denial of access to the tape of the phone call. He also alleges that the evidence was\n\ninsufficient and that the penalty was arbitrary and capricious. The District Court rejected\n\nthe claims and denied relief. Garrett appeals pro se.1\n\n\n\n       1\n         We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291. We exercise plenary review over\nthe District Court’s legal conclusions. See Wilson v. U.S. Parole Comm’n, 193 F.3d 195,\n197 (3d Cir. 1999).\n\f       With respect to his due process claim, a prisoner must be given the opportunity to\n\ncall witnesses and present documentary evidence in his own defense. See Wolff v.\n\nMcDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 566 (1974); 28 C.F.R. § 541.17(c). Garrett argues that he was\n\ndenied access to the recording and the right to have an expert analyze the tape of the\n\nphone conversation. While line seventeen of the incident report shows that Garrett\n\n“would like someone to analyze my voice and his [Peters’] voice because he calls that\n\nnumber frequently,” Garrett never requested a copy of the tape. However, since he did\n\nrequest an evidentiary analysis, we must still determine if the denial of the request\n\nviolates due process.\n\n       Garrett cites no authority, nor have we found any, that establishes a due process\n\nright to have the prison find, retain, and present an expert witness on the prisoner’s\n\nbehalf. Rather, the Eighth Circuit has held that such a right does not exist. See Spence v.\n\nFarrier, 807 F.2d 753, 755-56 (8th Cir. 1986); see also Wolff, 418 U.S. at 566-67 (stating\n\nreasonable penological needs may limit the right to present evidence). We agree with the\n\nEighth Circuit, and thus, Garrett was not denied due process.\n\n       Garrett also alleges that the DHO prevented him from calling Peters as a witness\n\nby threatening additional disciplinary sanctions if the DHO did not find Peters’ testimony\n\ncredible. We agree with the District Court that Garrett fails to present any evidence\n\ncontradicting his apparent voluntary choice to waive his right to call Peters, and his\n\narguments on appeal are unpersuasive.\n\n       Next Garrett claims that the evidence is insufficient to sustain the discipline. A\n\nprison disciplinary decision will be upheld if there is “some evidence” to support the\n\ffinding. See Superintendent Mass. Corr. Inst., Walpole v. Hill, 472 U.S. 445, 454 (1985).\n\nThe record exhibits more than enough evidence to meet this relatively deferential\n\nstandard including, but not limited to, the three incriminating facts gleaned from the tape\n\nand that Garrett was prohibited from using the phone.\n\n       Finally, Garrett claims that the sanctions were arbitrary and capricious. Although\n\nhe does not raise this issue in his informal brief, we agree with the District Court that the\n\nsanctions were neither arbitrary nor capricious. Garrett was sanctioned in accordance\n\nwith the provisions of 28 C.F.R. § 541.13. The DHO noted that this was Garrett’s sixth\n\noffense for violation of Code 297, allowing the DHO to impose any sanction authorized\n\nfor the most severe offenses. 28 C.F.R. § 514.13 Table 5. A lighter, but still severe\n\npenalty may be imposed for a third violation of Code 307. Both penalties are clearly\n\nexplained in the DHO’s report and are consistent with the regulations. Thus, the\n\nsanctions were not arbitrary.\n\f",
