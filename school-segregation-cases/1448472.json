Because we con-\n    1\n   Throughout this opinion, we refer to the Confederate battle flag simply\nas the \"Confederate flag.\" We refer to other Confederate flags by their\nspecific names.\n\f                       HARDWICK v. HEYWARD                          3\nclude that the school officials complied with the requirements\nfor regulating student speech as established in Tinker v. Des\nMoines Independent Community School District, 393 U.S.\n503 (1969), and that the school dress codes and their enforce-\nment did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment, we affirm.\n\n                                   I.\n\n  We review the facts in the light most favorable to Candice\nHardwick, the nonmoving party. See Laing v. Fed. Express\nCorp., 703 F.3d 713, 714 (4th Cir. 2013).\n\n                                  A.\n\n   Candice Hardwick grew up in Dillon County, South Caro-\nlina. She attended Latta Middle School during the 2002-03\nand 2003-04 school years before attending Latta High School\nduring the 2004-05 and 2005-06 school years. Both schools\nare located in Latta, a town of about 1,400 people. These\nschools are part of the Latta School District,2 which had a stu-\ndent population of approximately 1,600 students, almost\nequally divided between whites and African-Americans, dur-\ning the time Candice attended Latta schools.\n\n   Latta Middle School and Latta High School have dress\ncodes that regulate what clothing students may wear at school.\nThe relevant portion of the middle school policy states, \"Gen-\nerally, student dress is considered appropriate as long as it\ndoes not distract others, interfere with the instructional pro-\ngrams, or otherwise cause disruption.\" J.A. 38. The policy\nthen provides \"some examples that are judged to be inappro-\npriate or distracting in the educational setting,\" which\nincludes \"clothing that displays profane language, drugs,\ntobacco, or alcohol advertisements, sexual innuendoes or any-\nthing else deemed to be offensive.\" J.A. 39. Similarly, the rel-\nevant part of the high school policy provides that \"students\n  2\n   The district is also known as Dillon County School District 3.\n\f4                   HARDWICK v. HEYWARD\nare to come to school in a neat and clean manner each day.\nDress is casual, but some styles, which may be appropriate\noutside of school, are clearly inappropriate for school. Stu-\ndents may not wear the following: . . . Shirts with\nobscene/derogatory sayings.\" J.A. 45.\n\n   Starting during the 2002-03 school year at the middle\nschool, school officials on multiple occasions forced Candice\nto remove Confederate flag shirts and on one occasion pun-\nished her for wearing those shirts. The first incident came in\nearly 2003, when Martha Heyward, principal of the middle\nschool, required Candice to remove her \"Southern Chicks\"\nshirt, which displayed the Confederate flag. See J.A. 46.\n\n   More incidents occurred during the 2003-04 school year.\nOn one occasion in January 2004, a teacher required Candice\nto cover up a \"Dixie Angels\" shirt, which displayed the Con-\nfederate flag. See J.A. 47. In early February, Heyward\nremoved Candice from class for wearing a \"Southern Girls\"\nshirt, which, like the previous two shirts, displayed the Con-\nfederate flag. See J.A. 48. Then in mid-February, Candice was\nsent to the school office and forced to change shirts when she\nwore a shirt honoring \"Black Confederates\" that displayed a\nConfederate flag and a picture of the 1st Louisiana Native\nGuards, a Confederate regiment consisting mostly of free\nAfrican-Americans. See J.A. 49. Shortly after this incident,\nHeyward refused to let Candice wear what Candice labeled a\n\"protest shirt,\" which displayed the American flag with the\nwords \"Old Glory\" above the flag and \"Flew over legalized\nslavery for 90 years!\" underneath it. See J.A. 50. In late Feb-\nruary, when Candice wore a shirt with a picture of Robert E.\nLee and the Confederate flag, Candice refused to change\nshirts and was given in-school suspension. See J.A. 51.\nFinally, in March, Candice was forced to change a \"Girls\nRule\" shirt that, like her other shirts, displayed the Confeder-\nate flag. See J.A. 52.\n\f                         HARDWICK v. HEYWARD                               5\n   After this series of incidents, Candice’s parents sent John\nKirby, the superintendent of the school district, a letter stating\nthat Candice’s clothing was approved by them and reflected\nCandice’s family heritage and religious beliefs. Harold Korn-\nblut, the chairman of the school board, responded to this let-\nter, explaining that based on a long history of racial tension\nand the potential for different interpretations of the meaning\nof the Confederate flag, school officials could prohibit cloth-\ning that contained images of that flag. At some time during\nthis exchange of letters, Candice wore a shirt at school after\nschool hours that said \"Offended by School Censorship of\nSouthern Heritage,\" resulting in a school official yelling at\nher. See J.A. 89.3\n\n   When Candice began high school in the 2004-05 school\nyear, the controversy over her Confederate flag shirts contin-\nued. Candice’s parents and Kornblut again exchanged letters\nin the fall of 2004. Candice’s parents asked Kornblut to\nreconsider the school board’s position that Candice could not\nwear Confederate flag shirts at school. Kornblut’s response\nreaffirmed the school board’s position that such clothing was\nlikely to cause a disruption at school and was thus prohibited.\n\n   In May of that school year, George Liebenrood, principal\nof the high school, removed Candice from class for wearing\na shirt that read \"Daddy’s Little Redneck\" and displayed the\nConfederate flag. See J.A. 99. In Liebenrood’s presence, Can-\ndice then produced four more \"protest shirts,\" each of which\nLiebenrood prohibited Candice from wearing: (1) a shirt say-\ning \"Jesus and the Confederate Battle Flag: Banned from Our\nSchools but Forever in Our Hearts\" that displayed the first\nConfederate national flag, commonly known as the \"Stars and\nBars,\" the Bonnie Blue flag, the third Confederate national flag,4\n  3\n     Although this shirt does not display a Confederate flag as clearly as\nsome of the other shirts that Candice wore, the lettering has the red, white,\nand blue coloring of the Confederate flag and resembles the familiar diag-\nonal cross of the flag.\n   4\n     This flag is a white banner with the Confederate battle flag in the\nupper-left-hand corner, which has the censor symbol over it as depicted on\nthis shirt, and a vertical red stripe on the far right side of the flag.\n\f6                         HARDWICK v. HEYWARD\nand a Confederate battle flag with the censor symbol over it,\nsee J.A. 100; (2) a shirt saying \"Honorary Member of the FBI:\nFederal Bigot Institutions,\" see J.A. 101; (3) a shirt saying\n\"Our School Supports Freedom of Speech for All (Except\nSoutherners),\" see J.A. 102; and (4) a shirt saying \"Public\nSchools Should Educate Not Discriminate Against Southern\nHeritage,\" see J.A. 103.5\n\n  Candice’s conflict with school officials continued in the\n2005-06 school year. At the beginning of that school year,\nCandice wore a shirt with a picture of the South Carolina\nState House grounds that included the Confederate flag,\nwhich flies on the State House grounds. See J.A. 104. Candice\nwore this shirt \"for several days\" before Liebenrood learned\nof it, at which time he made her change shirts. J.A. 24. This\nwas the last time Candice wore a Confederate flag shirt at\nschool.\n\n   After a final attempt in the spring of 2006 to have the\nschool board change its position on the acceptability of Con-\nfederate flag shirts at school, Candice, by and through her par-\nents, filed this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against\nHeyward, Liebenrood, and the Board of Trustees of the Latta\nSchool District. Candice claimed that her First Amendment\nright to free speech and expression was violated because she\nwas not allowed to wear the Confederate flag shirts or protest\nshirts; that her Fourteenth Amendment right to due process\nwas violated because the schools’ dress codes are overbroad\nand vague; and that her Fourteenth Amendment right to equal\nprotection was violated because the school officials specifi-\ncally targeted her Confederate flag shirts while not punishing\nother racially themed shirts.\n\n    The defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, and\n    5\n    The lettering on these last three so-called protest shirts is the same style\nas the lettering on the \"Offended by School Censorship of Southern Heri-\ntage\" shirt. See supra note 3.\n\f                       HARDWICK v. HEYWARD                            7\nthe affidavits and depositions of the school officials filed with\nthis motion reveal the basis on which the school officials pro-\nhibited Candice from wearing her Confederate flag shirts and\nprotest shirts. For generations before integration in the 1970-\n71 school year, whites and African-Americans in Latta had\n\"lived culturally and financially separate [lives],\" and integra-\ntion \"made life in [Latta] drastically different.\" J.A. 124.\nAlthough school officials have recognized an improvement in\nrace relations since integration,6 they also stated that \"there\nhas always been, and continues to be, an underlying, mostly\nunspoken, prejudice between [Latta’s] white and black stu-\ndents.\" J.A. 132–33.\n\n   Various racial incidents in Latta schools illustrate this racial\ntension. For instance, in the mid-1980s, a white student and\nan African-American student attended the prom together,\ncausing \"small groups of whites and blacks . . . to stir up trou-\nble,\" which included white students wearing Confederate flag\napparel and African-American students wearing Malcolm X\napparel. J.A. 128. Less than a decade later in the early 1990s,\nthe Confederate flag again caused commotion when a student\ndrove through the school parking lot with a Confederate flag\non his truck. Then, in the mid-1990s, two high school students\nburned one of the historic African-American churches in the\narea. The Confederate flag caused more \"issues\" and created\na \"very tense\" situation between white and African-American\nstudents during the debate in 2000 over whether the flag\nshould continue flying on the State House dome.7 J.A. 502.\n\n   More recent examples that occurred during or after Can-\ndice’s time at the middle school and high school demonstrate\n  6\n    For example, Latta High School no longer has separate proms and\nhomecoming queens for whites and African-Americans, both of which\nexisted until the 1980s.\n  7\n    The Confederate flag flew atop the State House dome from the early\n1960s until 2000, when it was moved to its current location on a thirty-\nfoot flagpole near the Confederate monument on the State House grounds.\n\f8                      HARDWICK v. HEYWARD\ncontinued racial tension in Latta schools. Heyward described\nan incident involving a Confederate flag that led to a disrup-\ntion of a classroom in which the teacher had to calm the class\ndown in response to the flag. Another incident involving the\nConfederate flag took place in 2009, when a student wore a\nConfederate flag belt buckle, prompting another student who\nsaw the belt buckle to say, \"If you don’t take that belt off,\nwe’re going to take it off of you.\" J.A. 503.\n\n                                   B.\n\n   In 2009, the district court granted summary judgment to the\ndefendants on Candice’s First Amendment claim based on the\nConfederate flag shirts and on her Fourteenth Amendment\nequal protection and due process claims. Hardwick ex rel.\nHardwick v. Heyward, 674 F. Supp. 2d 725 (D.S.C. 2009).\nCandice appealed, but we concluded that we lacked jurisdic-\ntion because the district court’s opinion did not address all of\nCandice’s claims—specifically, her claims related to the pro-\ntest shirts—making the appeal \"interlocutory in nature.\" C.H.\nex rel. Hardwick v. Heyward, 404 F. App’x 765, 768 (4th Cir.\n2010) (per curiam) (quoting Am. Canoe Ass’n v. Murphy\nFarms, Inc., 326 F.3d 505, 514 (4th Cir. 2003)). We therefore\ndismissed the appeal and remanded the case for further pro-\nceedings. Id.\n\n   On remand, the district court granted summary judgment to\nthe defendants on Candice’s First Amendment claim based on\nthe protest shirts and reaffirmed its previous grant of sum-\nmary judgment to the defendants on Candice’s Fourteenth\nAmendment claims, thereby disposing of all claims in this case.8\nHardwick ex rel. Hardwick v. Heyward, 2012 WL 761249\n(D.S.C. Mar. 8, 2012). Candice timely appealed, and we have\njurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n    8\n    Additionally, the district court concluded that the individual defen-\ndants, Heyward and Liebenrood, were entitled to qualified immunity.\nBecause we conclude that Candice’s constitutional rights were not vio-\nlated, we do not address the qualified immunity issue.\n\f                    HARDWICK v. HEYWARD                       9\n                              II.\n\n   We review a grant of summary judgment de novo, \"apply-\ning the same legal standards as the district court.\" Pueschel v.\nPeters, 577 F.3d 558, 563 (4th Cir. 2009). Summary judgment\nshould be granted if \"there is no genuine dispute as to any\nmaterial fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a mat-\nter of law,\" based on the \"materials in the record, including\ndepositions, documents, electronically stored information,\naffidavits or declarations, stipulations (including those made\nfor purposes of the motion only), admissions, interrogatory\nanswers, or other materials.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56. At this stage,\nwe must view all evidence in the light most favorable to the\nnonmoving party. Rowzie v. Allstate Ins. Co., 556 F.3d 165,\n167 (4th Cir. 2009). In conducting our review, we do not\n\"weigh the evidence,\" but rather we only determine \"whether\nthere is a genuine issue for trial.\" Gray v. Spillman, 925 F.2d\n90, 95 (4th Cir. 1991); see also Anderson v. Liberty Lobby,\nInc., 477 U.S. 242, 255 (1986) (\"Credibility determinations,\nthe weighing of the evidence, and the drawing of legitimate\ninferences from the facts are jury functions, not those of a\njudge, whether he is ruling on a motion for summary judg-\nment or for a directed verdict.\").\n\n   On appeal, Candice challenges the district court’s decision\nto grant summary judgment to the defendants on both her\nFirst and Fourteenth Amendment claims. We address each in\nturn.\n\n                              III.\n\n   We turn first to Candice’s claim that the defendants vio-\nlated her First Amendment right to free speech and expression\nby refusing to let her wear Confederate flag shirts and protest\nshirts.\n\n                              A.\n\n We start with the fundamental principle that the First\nAmendment prohibits Congress and, through the Fourteenth\n\f10                      HARDWICK v. HEYWARD\nAmendment, the states from \"abridging the freedom of\nspeech.\" U.S. Const. amend. I; Gitlow v. New York, 268 U.S.\n652, 666 (1925). Although students do not \"shed their consti-\ntutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the\nschoolhouse gate,\" Tinker, 393 U.S. at 506, \"the constitutional\nrights of students in public school are not automatically coex-\ntensive with the rights of adults in other settings,\" Bethel Sch.\nDist. No. 403 v. Fraser, 478 U.S. 675, 682 (1986); see also\nHazelwood Sch. Dist. v. Kuhlmeier, 484 U.S. 260, 266 (1988).\n\n   The Supreme Court’s landmark decision in Tinker v. Des\nMoines Independent Community School District established\nthe basic framework governing student speech.9 In that case,\na group of students wore black armbands to school to protest\nthe Vietnam War, and school officials, pursuant to the policy\nthey adopted once they learned of the plan to wear armbands,\nsuspended the students. Tinker, 393 U.S. at 504. Interpreting\nthe First Amendment \"in light of the special characteristics of\nthe school environment,\" id. at 506, the Court held that school\nofficials may prohibit or punish student speech that would\n\"‘materially and substantially interfer[e] with the require-\nments of appropriate discipline in the operation of the school’\n[or] collid[e] with the rights of others.\" Id. at 513 (quoting\nBurnside v. Byars, 363 F.2d 744, 749 (5th Cir. 1966)). School\nofficials may regulate such speech even before it occurs, as\nlong as they can point to \"facts which might reasonably have\nled [them] to forecast\" such a disruption. Tinker, 393 U.S. at\n514. School officials may not, however, punish speech based\non only an \"undifferentiated fear or apprehension of distur-\nbance\" or \"a mere desire to avoid the discomfort and unpleas-\n  9\n    We have indicated that Tinker does not apply to \"a neutral time, place,\nand manner restriction\" that a school imposes. See Glover v. Cole, 762\nF.2d 1197, 1203 (4th Cir. 1985); see also Canady v. Bossier Parish Sch.\nBd., 240 F.3d 437, 443 (5th Cir. 2001) (applying the framework of United\nStates v. O’Brien, 391 U.S. 367 (1968), to a content-neutral regulation of\nspeech). The dress codes in the Latta schools are not content neutral, so\nin our review of the framework of student-speech law, we do not consider\nthis issue.\n\f                        HARDWICK v. HEYWARD                            11\nantness that always accompany an unpopular viewpoint.\" Id.\nat 508, 509.\n\n   Applying these principles to the facts of Tinker, the Court\nheld that suspending the students violated their First Amend-\nment rights. The school officials had no \"reason to anticipate\nthat the wearing of the armbands would substantially interfere\nwith the work of the school or impinge upon the rights of\nother students.\" Id. at 509. Instead, their decision appeared\n\"based upon an urgent wish to avoid the controversy which\nmight result from the [students’] expression.\" Id. at 510. Thus,\nthe suspensions could not pass constitutional muster. Id. at\n514.\n\n   Although Tinker provides the basic constitutional frame-\nwork for reviewing student speech, the Supreme Court has\ncreated three exceptions to Tinker in which school officials\nmay regulate student speech without undertaking Tinker’s\nsubstantial-disruption analysis. First, school officials can\n\"prohibit the use of vulgar and offensive terms\" as part of\ntheir role in teaching students the \"fundamental values of\n‘habits and manners of civility’ essential to a democratic soci-\nety.\" Fraser, 478 U.S. at 683, 681.10 Second, school officials\nhave greater latitude to regulate student speech when the\nschool \"lend[s] its name and resources to the dissemination of\nstudent expression\" such that \"students, parents, and members\nof the public might reasonably perceive [that student expres-\nsion] to bear the imprimatur of the school.\" Kuhlmeier, 484\nU.S. at 272–73, 271. Third, school officials can regulate stu-\ndent speech that can plausibly be interpreted as promoting\n   10\n      In interpreting Fraser, we have stated, \"When speech in school falls\nwithin the lewd, vulgar, and plainly offensive rubric, it can be said that\nFraser limits the form and manner of speech, but does not address the\ncontent of the message.\" Newsom ex rel. Newsom v. Albemarle Cnty. Sch.\nBd., 354 F.3d 249, 256 (4th Cir. 2003). Because we do not rely on Fraser,\nthe line between the manner of speech and the content of speech is of no\nimport here.\n\f12                       HARDWICK v. HEYWARD\nillegal drugs because of \"the dangers of illegal drug use.\"\nMorse v. Frederick, 551 U.S. 393, 410 (2007).11\n\n                                     B.\n\n   Like other student-speech cases, we have recognized that\nthe legal question raised by students’ desire to have poten-\ntially controversial items, such as Confederate flag apparel, in\nschools is \"not frivolous.\" Crosby by Crosby v. Holsinger,\n  11\n    Although we briefly mentioned Morse in Kowalski v. Berkeley County\nSchools, 652 F.3d 565, 571 (4th Cir. 2011), we have not expressly dis-\ncussed how Morse fits into the student-speech framework. Other circuits,\nhowever, have addressed this issue.\n   The Sixth Circuit has interpreted Morse as creating a new, additional\nframework for analyzing student speech. In Defoe ex rel. Defoe v. Spiva,\n625 F.3d 324, 338–41 (6th Cir. 2010) (Rogers, J., concurring), a majority\nof the panel interpreted Morse as allowing courts not to apply Tinker’s\nsubstantial-disruption test but instead to follow another \"mode of analy-\nsis.\" The court in Defoe ex rel. Defoe treated schools’ interest in \"reducing\nracial tension\" as comparable to the interest in Morse of preventing illegal-\ndrug use. Id. at 340. Based on this conclusion, the court held that the\nschool officials’ decision to ban the Confederate flag, a \"racially hostile\"\nsymbol, did not violate the First Amendment. Id. at 340–41.\n   We disagree with the Sixth Circuit’s interpretation of Morse and believe\nthat, based on the Court’s clear emphasis in Morse on the danger of\nillegal-drug use, the better interpretation of that case is that it is simply\nanother exception to Tinker, just as Fraser and Kuhlmeier are. See, e.g.,\nK.A. ex rel. Ayers v. Pocono Mountain Sch. Dist., ___ F.3d ___, 2013 WL\n915059, at *5 (3d Cir. 2013) (including Morse as one of \"several narrow\ncategories of speech that a school may restrict even without the threat of\nsubstantial disruption\" (internal quotation mark omitted)); Morgan v.\nSwanson, 659 F.3d 359, 387 (5th Cir. 2011) (en banc) (characterizing Fra-\nser, Kuhlmeier, and Morse as \"the exceptions to Tinker’s general rule\");\nDoninger v. Niehoff, 642 F.3d 334, 344–45 (2d Cir. 2011) (including\nMorse with Fraser and Kuhlmeier in listing caveats to Tinker); B.W.A. v.\nFarmington R-7 Sch. Dist., 554 F.3d 734, 741 (8th Cir. 2009) (calling\nMorse a \"narrow holding\" and applying Tinker). While the Supreme Court\nis free to create exceptions to or even abandon Tinker’s substantial-\ndisruption test, we must continue to adhere to the Tinker test in cases that\ndo not fall within any exceptions that the Supreme Court has created until\nthe Court directs otherwise.\n\f                        HARDWICK v. HEYWARD                            13\n816 F.2d 162, 164 (4th Cir. 1987). The seriousness of this\nissue rises from the tension between students’ right to free\nspeech and school officials’ need to control the educational\nenvironment. As the Sixth Circuit has aptly stated:\n\n       [O]n the one hand we are faced with the exercise of\n       the fundamental constitutional right to freedom of\n       speech, and on the other with the oft conflicting, but\n       equally important, need to maintain decorum in our\n       public schools so that the learning process may be\n       carried out in an orderly manner.\n\nMelton v. Young, 465 F.2d 1332, 1334 (6th Cir. 1972); see\nalso Barr v. Lafon, 538 F.3d 554, 562 (6th Cir. 2008) (observ-\ning that a student-speech case raised \"a most difficult ques-\ntion\").\n\n   Despite having addressed student speech in other contexts,\nwe have not yet addressed the wearing of Confederate flag\napparel in schools under the Supreme Court’s student-speech\nframework.12 We have, however, had occasion to consider\nvarious interpretations of the Confederate flag, albeit in other\ncontexts. Although we have recognized that for some people,\nthe Confederate flag is \"a symbolic acknowledgment of pride\nin Southern heritage and ideals of independence,\" Sons of\nConfederate Veterans, Inc. ex rel. Griffin v. Comm’r of Va.\nDep’t of Motor Vehicles, 288 F.3d 610, 624 (4th Cir. 2002),\nwe have also acknowledged that for other people, it \"is a sym-\nbol of racial separation and oppression.\" United States v.\nBlanding, 250 F.3d 858, 861 (4th Cir. 2001); see also Dixon\nv. Coburg Dairy, Inc., 369 F.3d 811, 814 n.2 (4th Cir. 2004)\n  12\n    District courts in this circuit have addressed this issue, including a\ncase brought by another South Carolina student. See Phillips v. Anderson\nCnty. Sch. Dist. Five, 987 F. Supp. 488 (D.S.C. 1997) (granting summary\njudgment to the school officials because they had a reasonable basis for\ndetermining that a Confederate flag jacket would cause a substantial dis-\nruption at school).\n\f14                  HARDWICK v. HEYWARD\n(en banc) (recognizing the \"heated debate\" in South Carolina\nover the flag on top of the State House dome); Scott v. Sch.\nBd. of Alachua Cnty., 324 F.3d 1246, 1248–49 (11th Cir.\n2003) (noting that one expert planned to testify that the Con-\nfederate flag was \"a historical symbol embodying the philo-\nsophical and political principals of a decentralized form of\ngovernment\" and another expert planned to testify that the\nflag \"represented approval of white supremacy\").\n\n   Other circuits have faced student-speech cases involving\nthe Confederate flag that were similar to this case. In many of\nthese cases, other circuits have upheld school officials’ deci-\nsions to prohibit the Confederate flag at school because past\nracially charged incidents allowed the officials to predict that\nthe Confederate flag would disrupt the schools. See Defoe ex\nrel. Defoe v. Spiva, 625 F.3d 324 (6th Cir. 2010); A.M. ex rel.\nMcAllum v. Cash, 585 F.3d 214 (5th Cir. 2009); B.W.A. v.\nFarmington R-7 Sch. Dist., 554 F.3d 734 (8th Cir. 2009);\nBarr, 538 F.3d 554; Scott, 324 F.3d 1246; West v. Derby Uni-\nfied Sch. Dist. No. 260, 206 F.3d 1358 (10th Cir. 2000); Mel-\nton, 465 F.2d 1332.\n\n   Of course, prohibiting students from having the Confeder-\nate flag at school is not automatically constitutional. For\ninstance, in Castorina ex rel. Rewt v. Madison County School\nBoard, 246 F.3d 536 (6th Cir. 2001), the Sixth Circuit\nreversed the district court’s grant of summary judgment to the\nschool officials. The court noted the lack of evidence suggest-\ning that a ban on the Confederate flag was needed to prevent\ndisruptions and emphasized that the Confederate flag\nappeared to have been specifically targeted by school offi-\ncials, who let other potentially divisive racial symbols go\nunpunished. Id. at 540–44.\n\n   Notwithstanding the attention these cases may have\nreceived because of the subject matter of the students’ speech,\na close reading of these cases shows that they are simply\nstudent-speech cases, based on the fact that the courts under-\n\f                        HARDWICK v. HEYWARD                             15\ntook the analysis set forth in Tinker and its progeny. See, e.g.,\nBarr, 538 F.3d at 564–69; Castorina ex rel. Rewt, 246 F.3d\nat 540–44; West, 206 F.3d at 1365–67. We agree that a\nstudent-speech case about the Confederate flag is merely a\nstudent-speech case and therefore, in a legal sense, no differ-\nent than other student-speech cases that we have decided. See,\ne.g., Kowalski v. Berkeley Cnty. Sch., 652 F.3d 565 (4th Cir.\n2011); Newsom ex rel. Newsom v. Albemarle Cnty. Sch. Bd.,\n354 F.3d 249 (4th Cir. 2003). Thus, despite the attention the\nConfederate flag may attract or the emotions that it may\ncause, this case is, at its core, a student-speech case governed\nby Tinker and other applicable Supreme Court precedent.13 Cf.\nUnited States v. Currence, 446 F.3d 554, 558–59 (4th Cir.\n2006) (observing that the parties’ focus on whether the search\nof a bicycle’s handlebars was analogous to the search of a\ncar’s interior as then-permitted by New York v. Belton, 453\nU.S. 454 (1981), misconstrued the real issue, which was the\nmore general rule of Chimel v. California, 395 U.S. 752\n(1969)).\n\n                                    C.\n\n  With this background in mind, we now turn to Candice’s\nspecific First Amendment claims.\n\n                                    1.\n\n   We begin with Candice’s First Amendment claim based on\n  13\n     In its analysis, the district court thoroughly surveyed student-speech\ncases involving the Confederate flag from various federal courts around\nthe country. Based on its survey, the district court thoughtfully drew six\n\"relevant principles for applying the Tinker standard to a school prohibi-\ntion on Confederate symbols.\" Hardwick ex rel. Hardwick, 674 F. Supp.\n2d at 733. Our reading of these cases from other courts suggests that the\nprinciples for which they stand are not limited to student-speech cases\ninvolving the Confederate flag. Rather, they are interpretations of Tinker\nthat, under the right factual scenario, would apply in any student-speech\ncase.\n\f16                   HARDWICK v. HEYWARD\nher Confederate flag shirts. Before beginning our legal analy-\nsis, however, we first must determine which shirts are prop-\nerly labeled as Confederate flag shirts and which are properly\nlabeled as protest shirts.\n\n   Some shirts are easily classified as Confederate flag shirts.\nThe \"Southern Chicks,\" \"Dixie Angels,\" \"Southern Girls,\"\n\"Black Confederates,\" Robert E. Lee, \"Girls Rule,\" \"Daddy’s\nLittle Redneck,\" and State House grounds shirts all clearly\ndisplay the Confederate flag, and Candice does not dispute\ntheir characterization as Confederate flag shirts.\n\n   Candice disagrees, however, with the district court’s classi-\nfication of five other shirts as Confederate flag shirts: the\n\"Jesus and the Confederate Battle Flag: Banned from Our\nSchools but Forever in Our Hearts,\" \"Offended by School\nCensorship of Southern Heritage,\" \"Honorary Member of the\nFBI: Federal Bigot Institutions,\" \"Our School Supports Free-\ndom of Speech for All (Except Southerners),\" and \"Public\nSchools Should Educate Not Discriminate Against Southern\nHeritage\" shirts. We disagree with Candice, and we consider\nthese shirts to be Confederate flag shirts. First, the \"Jesus and\nthe Confederate Battle Flag: Banned from Our Schools but\nForever in Our Hearts\" shirt includes a censored Confederate\nflag (that is, a Confederate flag with a red circle around it\nwith a red diagonal line across the diameter of the circle), as\nwell as the first Confederate national flag, the third Confeder-\nate national flag, and the Bonnie Blue flag, which are three\nother recognizable Confederate symbols. This shirt is there-\nfore a Confederate flag shirt. As for the other four shirts, their\nlettering reveals a Confederate flag. The red, white, and blue\ncoloring, in a diagonal cross, unmistakably represents the\nConfederate flag. These shirts are also thus properly consid-\nered Confederate flag shirts.\n\n   The record contains ample evidence from which the school\nofficials could reasonably forecast that all of these Confeder-\nate flag shirts \"would materially and substantially disrupt the\n\f                        HARDWICK v. HEYWARD                             17\nwork and discipline of the school.\" Tinker, 393 U.S. at 513.\nLatta is a small Southern town in which whites and African-\nAmericans were segregated, including in school, for more\nthan a century. When the schools were finally integrated in\nthe 1970-71 school year, the presence of racial tension was\nunderstandable. Over the past four decades, this tension has\ndiminished, but it has not completely disappeared, as numer-\nous incidents illustrate.\n\n   For example, the Confederate flag itself has caused prob-\nlems in Latta schools on multiple occasions, including the\nprom incident from the mid-1980s, the truck in the parking lot\nin the early 1990s, the debate over the flag on the State House\ndome in 2000, the classroom disruption that Heyward\ndescribed, and the belt buckle in 2009.14\n\n   Racial tension in Latta was not limited to incidents involv-\ning the Confederate flag. A nonflag-related example of such\ntension was the burning of an African-American church by\ntwo high school students. Cf. West, 206 F.3d at 1362 (consid-\nering off-campus occurrences when evaluating whether\nschool officials could reasonably predict that the Confederate\nflag would cause a substantial disruption at school).\n\n   These incidents, some involving the Confederate flag and\nsome not, demonstrate that continued racial tension exists in\nLatta schools. Taken together, they tell a story of a commu-\nnity and its schools that, although making progress in race\nrelations, are not immune from incidents of racial conflict.\n  14\n    Because the belt-buckle incident took place after her dispute with\nschool officials about Confederate flag shirts, Candice contends that we\ncannot consider this incident when evaluating the school officials’ deci-\nsion to ban the Confederate flag shirts and protest shirts.\n   We disagree. Although we do not rely solely on this incident to uphold\nthe school officials’ decision, we cannot turn a blind eye to the fact that\nthe incident occurred because it provides strong support for the reason-\nableness of the school officials’ determination that the Confederate flag\nwas likely to cause a substantial disruption at school.\n\f18                  HARDWICK v. HEYWARD\nAlthough the incidents caused by the Confederate flag are\nenough on their own to justify the decision of the school offi-\ncials to prohibit the Confederate flag shirts, when combined\nwith other racially charged incidents, they provide over-\nwhelming support for the conclusion that the Confederate flag\nshirts \"would materially and substantially disrupt the work\nand discipline of the school.\" Tinker, 393 U.S. at 513; see also\nDefoe, 625 F.3d at 335 (\"Tinker does not require that displays\nof the Confederate flag in fact cause substantial disruption or\ninterference, but rather that school officials reasonably fore-\ncasted that such displays could cause substantial disruption or\nmaterially interfere with the learning environment.\" (citing\nTinker, 393 U.S. at 514)); A.M. ex rel. McAllum, 585 F.3d at\n224 (observing that cases such as Melton and Phillips v.\nAnderson County School District Five, 987 F. Supp. 488\n(D.S.C. 1997), \"do not stand for the proposition that schools\nmay not prohibit the display of the Confederate flag unless it\nhas actually caused past disruptions\" but instead \"reflect the\nprinciple that administrators will usually meet their burden\nunder Tinker by showing that the proscribed speech has in\nfact been disruptive in the past\").\n\n   In arguing that her shirts were not likely to cause a disrup-\ntion, Candice points to the disciplinary records at the middle\nschool and the high school, which she claims contain only a\nfew incidents of racial disputes or fights. See J.A. 559–687.\nNotably, these records do contain racially charged incidents,\nindicating that at least some racial tension still exists. See,\ne.g., J.A. 564 (noting that a student was punished for an alter-\ncation that started after one student was called a \"cracker\");\nJ.A. 565 (noting that a student was punished for calling\nAfrican-American students \"n------\").\n\n  But putting aside these examples, the disciplinary records\nrepresent only a short period of time, from 2004 to 2007. The\nschool officials pointed to multiple incidents of racial tension\nover the past few decades. That some of these incidents may\nbe almost thirty years old does not mean that the school offi-\n\f                     HARDWICK v. HEYWARD                      19\ncials could not consider them in conjunction with more recent\nincidents. In considering the history of a town that has experi-\nenced slavery and segregation, incidents from even thirty\nyears ago are not so far removed from the present as to be\nirrelevant to determining the atmosphere of Latta schools. For\nthe school officials to consider the full picture when determin-\ning what might cause a disruption at school, they can consider\nthe causes of the types of incidents that they are trying to pre-\nvent from recurring. Therefore, that recent racially charged\nincidents are fewer in number or severity than such incidents\nfrom the more distant past does not prevent the school offi-\ncials from considering older incidents when determining\nwhether, based on the current school environment, a substan-\ntial disruption is likely to occur.\n\n   Related to her reliance on the alleged lack of racially\ncharged incidents in the schools’ disciplinary records, Can-\ndice contends that her shirts never caused any disruption and\nwere merely a \"silent, peaceable display\" of the Confederate\nflag that even drew positive remarks from some students.\nAppellant’s Br. at 29. Even assuming that Candice’s shirts\nnever caused a disruption, her argument misses the mark.\nThat her shirts never caused a disruption is not the issue;\nrather, the issue is whether school officials could reasonably\nforecast a disruption because of her shirts. See Tinker, 393\nU.S. at 513–14. As we have noted, \"a public school has the\npower to act to prevent problems before they occur, and the\nschool is not limited to prohibiting and punishing conduct\nonly after it has caused a disturbance.\" Newsom ex rel. New-\nsom, 354 F.3d at 259 n.7. We have already concluded that the\nschool officials met their burden of showing that they could\npredict that a substantial disruption might occur.\n\n   Similarly, Candice’s intent that her Confederate flag shirts\nbe only a symbol of her heritage and religious faith is irrele-\nvant. Again, the proper focus is whether school officials could\npredict that the Confederate flag shirts would cause a disrup-\ntion. See Tinker, 393 U.S. at 513–14; see also B.W.A. v. Far-\n\f20                   HARDWICK v. HEYWARD\nmington R-7 Sch. Dist., 508 F. Supp. 2d 740, 749 (E.D. Mo.\n2007) (\"[T]he plaintiff’s interpretation of the Confederate\nflag’s meaning is largely irrelevant because courts recognize\nthat it is racially divisive in nature.\" (citing Briggs v. Missis-\nsippi, 331 F.3d 499, 506 (5th Cir. 2003)).\n\n   Because school officials are far more intimately involved\nwith running schools than federal courts are, \"[i]t is axiomatic\nthat federal courts should not lightly interfere with the day-to-\nday operation of schools.\" Augustus v. Sch. Bd. of Escambia\nCnty., Fla., 507 F.2d 152, 155 (5th Cir. 1975); see also\nEpperson v. Arkansas, 393 U.S. 97, 104 (1968) (\"Judicial\ninterposition in the operation of the public school system of\nthe Nation raises problems requiring care and restraint.\"). As\nlong as school officials reasonably forecast a substantial dis-\nruption, they may act to prevent that disruption without violat-\ning a student’s constitutional rights, and we will not second\nguess their reasonable decisions. See Tinker, 393 U.S. at\n513–14. Here, multiple incidents of racial tension in Latta\nschools and the potential for such vastly different views\namong students about the meaning of the Confederate flag\nprovide a sufficient basis to justify the school officials’ con-\nclusion that the Confederate flag shirts would cause a substan-\ntial disruption. Therefore, Candice’s First Amendment right\nwas not violated by the school officials when they refused to\nallow her to wear the Confederate flag shirts at school.\n\n                                2.\n\n   We now turn to Candice’s First Amendment claim based\non the protest shirt. Like the Confederate flag shirts, we con-\nclude that the school officials reasonably predicted that the\nprotest shirt was likely to cause a substantial disruption.\n\n  Based on our determination that many of Candice’s so-\ncalled protest shirts were in fact Confederate flag shirts, only\none shirt can properly be classified as a protest shirt: the shirt\n\f                     HARDWICK v. HEYWARD                      21\ndisplaying the American flag with \"Old Glory\" above the flag\nand \"Flew over legalized slavery for 90 years!\" underneath it.\n\n   Whether the shirt makes a true statement is not a factor in\nour analysis. As long as a student’s speech is likely to cause\na substantial disruption, school officials can prohibit or punish\nthe speech. See id.\n\n   The protest shirt was undoubtedly likely to cause such a\ndisruption. It explicitly broadcast the fact that African-\nAmericans were slaves for part of American history, just as\nthe Confederate flag does for some people when they see it.\nThe same students who would be upset by the Confederate\nflag shirts would likely be equally upset by this protest shirt.\nThus, any disruptions that the Confederate flag shirts might\ncause could just as easily be caused by Candice’s protest shirt.\nThe school officials are therefore justified in relying on the\nsame past incidents of racial tension that allowed them to pro-\nhibit the Confederate flag shirts to prohibit this protest shirt.\nAccordingly, Candice’s First Amendment right was not vio-\nlated when the school officials did not allow her to wear the\nprotest shirt.\n\n                              IV.\n\n   We next address Candice’s Fourteenth Amendment claims\nthat the schools’ dress codes are unconstitutionally overbroad\nand vague, violating her right to due process, and that they are\nnot viewpoint neutral, violating her right to equal protection.\n\n                               A.\n\n   We begin with Candice’s facial challenge to the dress\ncodes on the basis that they violate due process because they\nare unconstitutionally overbroad and vague.\n\n                               1.\n\n  First, we consider Candice’s claim that the dress codes are\nunconstitutionally overbroad. Although the Supreme Court\n\f22                   HARDWICK v. HEYWARD\nhas counseled that \"[f]acial challenges are disfavored,\" Wash.\nState Grange v. Wash. State Republican Party, 552 U.S. 442,\n450 (2008), one such challenge that is permitted is an over-\nbreadth challenge. This doctrine allows a person to whom a\nlaw could be constitutionally applied to challenge the consti-\ntutionality of the law because the \"statute’s very existence\nmay cause others not before the court to refrain from constitu-\ntionally protected speech or expression.\" Broadrick v. Okla-\nhoma, 413 U.S. 601, 612 (1973); see also New York v.\nFerber, 458 U.S. 747, 767–69 (1982).\n\n   Under the overbreadth doctrine, \"a law should not be inval-\nidated for overbreadth unless it reaches a substantial number\nof impermissible applications.\" Ferber, 458 U.S. at 771. To\nprevail on an overbreadth claim, a plaintiff \"must demonstrate\nthat a regulation’s overbreadth is ‘not only . . . real, but sub-\nstantial as well, judged in relation to the [challenged regula-\ntion’s] plainly legitimate sweep,’ and also that no ‘limiting\nconstruction’ or ‘partial invalidation’ could ‘remove the\nseeming threat or deterrence to constitutionally protected\nexpression.’\" Newsom ex rel. Newsom, 354 F.3d at 258 (quot-\ning Broadrick, 413 U.S. at 613, 615) (alterations in original).\n\n   The public-school context of this overbreadth challenge\nraises additional considerations. First, \"[b]ecause of the duties\nand responsibilities of the public elementary and secondary\nschools, the overbreadth doctrine warrants a more hesitant\napplication in [the public school] setting than in other con-\ntexts.\" Id. (quoting Sypniewski v. Warren Hills Reg’l Bd. of\nEduc., 307 F.3d 243, 259 (3d Cir. 2002)) (alterations in origi-\nnal). Second, \"[g]iven the school’s need to be able to impose\ndisciplinary sanctions for a wide range of unanticipated con-\nduct disruptive of the educational process, the school disci-\nplinary rules need not be as detailed as a criminal code which\nimposes criminal sanctions.\" Fraser, 478 U.S. at 686.\n\n  Under these legal standards, the dress codes are not over-\nbroad. The middle school dress code prohibits clothes that\n\f                    HARDWICK v. HEYWARD                      23\nwould \"cause disruption\" or \"be offensive,\" thereby incorpo-\nrating the standards of both Tinker and Fraser. J.A. 38, 39.\nThe high school dress code bans \"[s]hirts with\nobscene/derogatory sayings,\" which tracks Fraser. J.A. 45.\nBecause the dress codes are guided by Tinker and Fraser,\n\"there is no real danger that [they] compromise[ ] the First\nAmendment rights of other . . . students,\" B.W.A., 508 F.\nSupp. 2d at 750–51, while at the same time giving school offi-\ncials the needed \"degree of flexibility in school disciplinary\nprocedures,\" New Jersey v. T.L.O., 469 U.S. 325, 340 (1985).\n\n   Reinforcing our conclusion that the dress codes are not\noverbroad is the collection of photographs of other clothing\nthat Liebenrood has found to have violated the high school’s\ndress code. See J.A. 295–375. This clothing includes shirts\nthat are sexually suggestive, promote alcohol use, and pro-\nmote violence, all of which school officials could constitu-\ntionally prohibit under Tinker or Fraser. These examples of\nprohibited clothing indicate that the school officials construe\nthe dress codes in a way that does not violate students’ rights.\nSee West, 206 F.3d at 1368 (considering how school officials\nconstrued the school policy in determining whether the policy\nwas overbroad). Therefore, the dress codes are not overbroad,\nand Candice’s due process right was not violated.\n\n                               2.\n\n   We next examine whether the dress codes are unconstitu-\ntionally vague and thus violate due process. A law is uncon-\nstitutionally vague if \"it fails to establish standards for the\n[government] and public that are sufficient to guard against\nthe arbitrary deprivation of liberty interests.\" City of Chicago\nv. Morales, 527 U.S. 41, 52 (1999). A law will fail to estab-\nlish these standards if \"ordinary people can[not] understand\nwhat conduct is prohibited.\" Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S.\n352, 357 (1983). Just as the overbreadth doctrine is designed\nto prevent self-censorship because of fear of a law’s enforce-\nment, the vagueness doctrine similarly ensures that a law does\n\f24                   HARDWICK v. HEYWARD\nnot \"deter constitutionally protected and socially desirable\nconduct.\" United States v. Nat’l Dairy Prods. Corp., 372 U.S.\n29, 36 (1963). Furthermore, the doctrine also protects against\n\"arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement\" of the law. Mora-\nles, 527 U.S. at 56.\n\n   Despite the concerns about vague laws, school officials\nhave greater leeway when crafting school policy than legisla-\ntures do in adopting criminal statutes because of the need of\nschool officials to respond to \"a wide range of unanticipated\nconduct disruptive of the educational process.\" Fraser, 478\nU.S. at 686; see also Sypniewski, 307 F.3d at 260 (\"[T]he\ndemands of public secondary and elementary school disci-\npline are such that it is inappropriate to expect the same level\nof precision in drafting school disciplinary policies as is\nexpected of legislative bodies crafting criminal restrictions.\").\n\n   Here, nothing about the dress codes is so vague that Can-\ndice was unable to conform her speech to the required stan-\ndards. Again, the dress codes are guided by Tinker and\nFraser, and they are as specific as the dress code in Fraser\nthat the Supreme Court upheld when the student challenged\nthat dress code on due process grounds. See Fraser, 478 U.S.\nat 678. Furthermore, the school officials explicitly informed\nCandice on multiple occasions that Confederate flag shirts\nwere not permitted under the dress codes. The dress codes\nwere therefore interpreted by the school officials for Candice\nin the specific context of her shirts. Nothing in the record\nplausibly supports any claim that she was unaware of this pro-\nhibition on Confederate flag apparel. See A.M. ex rel. McAl-\nlum, 585 F.3d at 225 (holding that students’ due process rights\nwere not violated when the students \"were given a warning\nthat the particular speech at issue would give rise to disci-\npline\"). Thus, the dress codes, both as written and as applied\nto Confederate flag clothing, are not unconstitutionally vague,\nand Candice’s right to due process was not violated.\n\f                     HARDWICK v. HEYWARD                      25\n                               B.\n\n  Finally, we address Candice’s claim that her right to equal\nprotection was violated because the dress codes are not view-\npoint neutral.\n\n   The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment\nprovides, \"No State shall . . . deny to any person within its\njurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" U.S. Const.\namend. XIV, § 1. This clause is \"essentially a direction that\nall persons similarly situated should be treated alike.\" City of\nCleburne, Tex. v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 439\n(1985). When an alleged equal protection violation is based\non a First Amendment claim, we \"fuse[ ] the First Amend-\nment into the Equal Protection Clause.\" R.A.V. v. City of St.\nPaul, Minn., 505 U.S. 377, 384–85 n.4 (1992); see also Barr,\n538 F.3d at 575–76.\n\n   The Supreme Court has not expressly discussed the rela-\ntionship between viewpoint discrimination and student\nspeech, but several cases are relevant on this issue. First, in\nTinker, the Court called \"relevant\" the fact that school offi-\ncials targeted speech about the Vietnam War but \"did not pur-\nport to prohibit the wearing of all symbols of political or\ncontroversial significance.\" Tinker, 393 U.S. at 510. Despite\nthis fact, the Court in Tinker based its holding on the fact that\nthe school officials could not predict that a substantial disrup-\ntion was likely to occur. See id. at 514. Such a prediction\nwould be a \"constitutionally valid reason[ ] to regulate [the\nstudents’] speech.\" Id. at 511. Without such a reason for\nschool officials to regulate speech, however, \"students are\nentitled to freedom of expression of their views.\" Id. Tinker\ntherefore stands for the proposition that school officials may\nnot target a specific viewpoint unless they can predict that that\nspeech would be likely to cause a substantial disruption. Id.\n(\"[T]he prohibition of expression of one particular opinion, at\nleast without evidence that it is necessary to avoid material\n\f26                  HARDWICK v. HEYWARD\nand substantial interference with schoolwork or discipline, is\nnot constitutionally permissible.\").\n\n   Over two decades after Tinker, the Court decided Rosen-\nberger v. Rector & Visitors of University of Virginia, 515 U.S.\n819 (1995). In that case about the funding for an independent\nstudent newspaper with a religious perspective at a university,\nthe Court wrote, \"In the realm of private speech or expression,\ngovernment regulation may not favor one speaker over\nanother.\" Id. at 828. Such viewpoint discrimination is \"an\negregious form of content discrimination,\" and \"[t]he govern-\nment must abstain from regulating speech when the specific\nmotivating ideology or the opinion or perspective of the\nspeaker is the rationale for the restriction.\" Id. at 829.\n\n   Other circuits are split on the extent to which Rosenberger\nalters the analysis of Tinker. Elementary and secondary\nschools are undoubtedly different than colleges, universities,\nand public discourse generally, and this distinction results in\ndifferent legal standards in some instances. See Hosty v. Car-\nter, 412 F.3d 731, 740–41 (7th Cir. 2005) (en banc) (Evans,\nJ., dissenting); see also Sypniewski, 307 F.3d at 267 (\"[T]the\npublic school setting is fundamentally different from other\ncontexts, including the university setting. Primary and sec-\nondary school officials stand in a unique relationship with\nrespect to their students, most of whom are minors.\" (internal\nfootnote omitted)). On one side of this issue, the Sixth Circuit\nhas held \"that schools’ regulation of student speech must be\nconsistent with both the Tinker standard and Rosenberger’s\nprohibition on viewpoint discrimination.\" Barr, 538 F.3d at\n571. On the other side, the Fifth Circuit has held, \"No matter\nhow ‘axiomatic’ the generalized rule against viewpoint dis-\ncrimination may be, we cannot neglect that this case arises in\nthe public schools, a special First Amendment context, which\nadmits of no categorical prohibition on viewpoint discrimina-\ntion.\" Morgan v. Swanson, 659 F.3d 359, 379 (5th Cir. 2011)\n(en banc) (internal footnotes omitted). The Eighth and Ninth\nCircuits have agreed with the Fifth Circuit’s position. See\n\f                    HARDWICK v. HEYWARD                     27\nB.W.A, 554 F.3d at 740; Harper v. Poway Unified Sch. Dist.,\n445 F.3d 1166, 1184–85 (9th Cir. 2006) cert. granted, judg-\nment vacated sub nom. Harper ex rel. Harper v. Poway Uni-\nfied Sch. Dist., 549 U.S. 1262 (2007).\n\n   We need not decide in this case the relationship between\nTinker and Rosenberger. Assuming that a school dress code\nmust be viewpoint neutral on its face and in its enforcement,\nthe record here indicates that these requirements are met.\nFirst, both dress codes are viewpoint neutral. The middle\nschool policy prohibits clothing that would \"distract others,\ninterfere with the instructional programs, or otherwise cause\ndisruption. . . . [or] that displays profane language, drugs,\ntobacco, or alcohol advertisements, sexual innuendoes or any-\nthing else deemed to be offensive,\" while the high school pol-\nicy forbids \"[s]hirts with obscene/derogatory sayings,\" J.A.\n39, 45. Neither policy targets the Confederate flag or any\nother specific viewpoint, so each policy is viewpoint neutral.\n\n   Second, both dress codes are enforced in a viewpoint-\nneutral manner. The record contains pictures of many shirts\nthat Liebenrood required students to remove because they vio-\nlated the dress code, including two Malcolm X shirts, see J.A.\n348, 374, thereby undermining Candice’s claim that the\nschool officials \"did not evenhandedly ban all race sensitive\nsymbols,\" Appellant’s Br. at 47. The school officials indicated\nthat all racial symbols are banned under the dress codes. See\nJ.A. 133, 523.\n\n   Candice’s contention that school officials did not punish\nstudents for wearing other racially themed shirts is insuffi-\ncient to defeat summary judgment. See J.A. 28, 155. At most,\nthe evidence on which she relies proves that \"various students\n‘got away’\" with wearing clothes that violated the dress\ncodes. Defoe ex rel. Defoe, 625 F.3d at 337. By her own\nadmission, Candice \"got away\" with wearing at least one\nConfederate flag shirt when she wore the South Carolina State\nHouse grounds shirt \"for several days\" without being required\n\f28                  HARDWICK v. HEYWARD\nto change shirts because the shirt had not been \"brought to\n[Liebenrood’s] attention.\" J.A. 24–25. That some stu-\ndents—including Candice—avoided detection when wearing\nclothes that violated the dress codes is not evidence that the\ndress codes were enforced in a viewpoint-discriminatory man-\nner; rather, it is, without more, simply evidence that the dress\ncodes were not always enforced stringently. Given that Can-\ndice’s Confederate flag shirt and other racially themed shirts\nall escaped notice, this lack of enforcement was not based on\nany viewpoint discrimination, and Candice’s position that the\ndress codes were enforced in a viewpoint-discriminatory man-\nner is mere speculation. See Othentec Ltd. v. Phelan, 526 F.3d\n135, 142 (4th Cir. 2008) (observing that a plaintiff’s \"allega-\ntions, speculation, and inference are not enough to survive\nsummary judgment\"). Candice’s right to equal protection was\ntherefore not violated by the dress codes or their enforcement.\n\n                              V.\n\n   Although students’ expression of their views and opinions\nis an important part of the educational process and receives\nsome First Amendment protection, the right of students to\nspeak in school is limited by the need for school officials to\nensure order, protect the rights of other students, and promote\nthe school’s educational mission. When, as here, student\nspeech threatens to disrupt school, school officials may pro-\nhibit or punish that speech. The Latta school officials there-\nfore did not violate Candice’s First Amendment right when\nthey refused to allow her to wear Confederate flag shirts and\nprotest shirts at school, and the dress codes and their enforce-\nment did not infringe on Candice’s Fourteenth Amendment\nrights. Thus, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\n                                                   AFFIRMED\n\f",

She attended Latta Middle School during the 2002-03\nand 2003-04 school years before attending Latta High School\nduring the 2004-05 and 2005-06 school years. Both schools\nare located in Latta, a town of about 1,400 people. These\nschools are part of the Latta School District,2 which had a stu-\ndent population of approximately 1,600 students, almost\nequally divided between whites and African-Americans, dur-\ning the time Candice attended Latta schools.\n\n   Latta Middle School and Latta High School have dress\ncodes that regulate what clothing students may wear at school.\nThe relevant portion of the middle school policy states, \"Gen-\nerally, student dress is considered appropriate as long as it\ndoes not distract others, interfere with the instructional pro-\ngrams, or otherwise cause disruption.\" J.A. 38. The policy\nthen provides \"some examples that are judged to be inappro-\npriate or distracting in the educational setting,\" which\nincludes \"clothing that displays profane language, drugs,\ntobacco, or alcohol advertisements, sexual innuendoes or any-\nthing else deemed to be offensive.\" J.A. 39. Similarly, the rel-\nevant part of the high school policy provides that \"students\n  2\n   The district is also known as Dillon County School District 3.\n\f4                   HARDWICK v. HEYWARD\nare to come to school in a neat and clean manner each day.\nDress is casual, but some styles, which may be appropriate\noutside of school, are clearly inappropriate for school. Stu-\ndents may not wear the following: . . . Shirts with\nobscene/derogatory sayings.\" J.A. 45.\n\n   Starting during the 2002-03 school year at the middle\nschool, school officials on multiple occasions forced Candice\nto remove Confederate flag shirts and on one occasion pun-\nished her for wearing those shirts. The first incident came in\nearly 2003, when Martha Heyward, principal of the middle\nschool, required Candice to remove her \"Southern Chicks\"\nshirt, which displayed the Confederate flag. See J.A. 46.\n\n   More incidents occurred during the 2003-04 school year.\nOn one occasion in January 2004, a teacher required Candice\nto cover up a \"Dixie Angels\" shirt, which displayed the Con-\nfederate flag. See J.A. 47. In early February, Heyward\nremoved Candice from class for wearing a \"Southern Girls\"\nshirt, which, like the previous two shirts, displayed the Con-\nfederate flag. See J.A. 48. Then in mid-February, Candice was\nsent to the school office and forced to change shirts when she\nwore a shirt honoring \"Black Confederates\" that displayed a\nConfederate flag and a picture of the 1st Louisiana Native\nGuards, a Confederate regiment consisting mostly of free\nAfrican-Americans. See J.A. 49. Shortly after this incident,\nHeyward refused to let Candice wear what Candice labeled a\n\"protest shirt,\" which displayed the American flag with the\nwords \"Old Glory\" above the flag and \"Flew over legalized\nslavery for 90 years!\" underneath it. See J.A. 50. In late Feb-\nruary, when Candice wore a shirt with a picture of Robert E.\nLee and the Confederate flag, Candice refused to change\nshirts and was given in-school suspension. See J.A. 51.\nFinally, in March, Candice was forced to change a \"Girls\nRule\" shirt that, like her other shirts, displayed the Confeder-\nate flag. See J.A. 52.\n\f                         HARDWICK v. HEYWARD                               5\n   After this series of incidents, Candice’s parents sent John\nKirby, the superintendent of the school district, a letter stating\nthat Candice’s clothing was approved by them and reflected\nCandice’s family heritage and religious beliefs. Harold Korn-\nblut, the chairman of the school board, responded to this let-\nter, explaining that based on a long history of racial tension\nand the potential for different interpretations of the meaning\nof the Confederate flag, school officials could prohibit cloth-\ning that contained images of that flag. At some time during\nthis exchange of letters, Candice wore a shirt at school after\nschool hours that said \"Offended by School Censorship of\nSouthern Heritage,\" resulting in a school official yelling at\nher. See J.A. 89.3\n\n   When Candice began high school in the 2004-05 school\nyear, the controversy over her Confederate flag shirts contin-\nued. Candice’s parents and Kornblut again exchanged letters\nin the fall of 2004. Candice’s parents asked Kornblut to\nreconsider the school board’s position that Candice could not\nwear Confederate flag shirts at school. Kornblut’s response\nreaffirmed the school board’s position that such clothing was\nlikely to cause a disruption at school and was thus prohibited.\n\n   In May of that school year, George Liebenrood, principal\nof the high school, removed Candice from class for wearing\na shirt that read \"Daddy’s Little Redneck\" and displayed the\nConfederate flag. See J.A. 99. In Liebenrood’s presence, Can-\ndice then produced four more \"protest shirts,\" each of which\nLiebenrood prohibited Candice from wearing: (1) a shirt say-\ning \"Jesus and the Confederate Battle Flag: Banned from Our\nSchools but Forever in Our Hearts\" that displayed the first\nConfederate national flag, commonly known as the \"Stars and\nBars,\" the Bonnie Blue flag, the third Confederate national flag,4\n  3\n     Although this shirt does not display a Confederate flag as clearly as\nsome of the other shirts that Candice wore, the lettering has the red, white,\nand blue coloring of the Confederate flag and resembles the familiar diag-\nonal cross of the flag.\n   4\n     This flag is a white banner with the Confederate battle flag in the\nupper-left-hand corner, which has the censor symbol over it as depicted on\nthis shirt, and a vertical red stripe on the far right side of the flag.\n\f6                         HARDWICK v. HEYWARD\nand a Confederate battle flag with the censor symbol over it,\nsee J.A. 100; (2) a shirt saying \"Honorary Member of the FBI:\nFederal Bigot Institutions,\" see J.A. 101; (3) a shirt saying\n\"Our School Supports Freedom of Speech for All (Except\nSoutherners),\" see J.A. 102; and (4) a shirt saying \"Public\nSchools Should Educate Not Discriminate Against Southern\nHeritage,\" see J.A. 103.5\n\n  Candice’s conflict with school officials continued in the\n2005-06 school year. At the beginning of that school year,\nCandice wore a shirt with a picture of the South Carolina\nState House grounds that included the Confederate flag,\nwhich flies on the State House grounds. See J.A. 104. Candice\nwore this shirt \"for several days\" before Liebenrood learned\nof it, at which time he made her change shirts. J.A. 24. This\nwas the last time Candice wore a Confederate flag shirt at\nschool.\n\n   After a final attempt in the spring of 2006 to have the\nschool board change its position on the acceptability of Con-\nfederate flag shirts at school, Candice, by and through her par-\nents, filed this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against\nHeyward, Liebenrood, and the Board of Trustees of the Latta\nSchool District. Candice claimed that her First Amendment\nright to free speech and expression was violated because she\nwas not allowed to wear the Confederate flag shirts or protest\nshirts; that her Fourteenth Amendment right to due process\nwas violated because the schools’ dress codes are overbroad\nand vague; and that her Fourteenth Amendment right to equal\nprotection was violated because the school officials specifi-\ncally targeted her Confederate flag shirts while not punishing\nother racially themed shirts.\n\n    The defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, and\n    5\n    The lettering on these last three so-called protest shirts is the same style\nas the lettering on the \"Offended by School Censorship of Southern Heri-\ntage\" shirt. See supra note 3.\n\f                       HARDWICK v. HEYWARD                            7\nthe affidavits and depositions of the school officials filed with\nthis motion reveal the basis on which the school officials pro-\nhibited Candice from wearing her Confederate flag shirts and\nprotest shirts. For generations before integration in the 1970-\n71 school year, whites and African-Americans in Latta had\n\"lived culturally and financially separate [lives],\" and integra-\ntion \"made life in [Latta] drastically different.\" J.A. 124.\nAlthough school officials have recognized an improvement in\nrace relations since integration,6 they also stated that \"there\nhas always been, and continues to be, an underlying, mostly\nunspoken, prejudice between [Latta’s] white and black stu-\ndents.\" J.A. 132–33.\n\n   Various racial incidents in Latta schools illustrate this racial\ntension. For instance, in the mid-1980s, a white student and\nan African-American student attended the prom together,\ncausing \"small groups of whites and blacks . . . to stir up trou-\nble,\" which included white students wearing Confederate flag\napparel and African-American students wearing Malcolm X\napparel. J.A. 128. Less than a decade later in the early 1990s,\nthe Confederate flag again caused commotion when a student\ndrove through the school parking lot with a Confederate flag\non his truck. Then, in the mid-1990s, two high school students\nburned one of the historic African-American churches in the\narea. The Confederate flag caused more \"issues\" and created\na \"very tense\" situation between white and African-American\nstudents during the debate in 2000 over whether the flag\nshould continue flying on the State House dome.7 J.A. 502.\n\n   More recent examples that occurred during or after Can-\ndice’s time at the middle school and high school demonstrate\n  6\n    For example, Latta High School no longer has separate proms and\nhomecoming queens for whites and African-Americans, both of which\nexisted until the 1980s.\n  7\n    The Confederate flag flew atop the State House dome from the early\n1960s until 2000, when it was moved to its current location on a thirty-\nfoot flagpole near the Confederate monument on the State House grounds.\n\f8                      HARDWICK v. HEYWARD\ncontinued racial tension in Latta schools. Heyward described\nan incident involving a Confederate flag that led to a disrup-\ntion of a classroom in which the teacher had to calm the class\ndown in response to the flag. Another incident involving the\nConfederate flag took place in 2009, when a student wore a\nConfederate flag belt buckle, prompting another student who\nsaw the belt buckle to say, \"If you don’t take that belt off,\nwe’re going to take it off of you.\" J.A. 503.\n\n                                   B.\n\n   In 2009, the district court granted summary judgment to the\ndefendants on Candice’s First Amendment claim based on the\nConfederate flag shirts and on her Fourteenth Amendment\nequal protection and due process claims.

Before beginning our legal analy-\nsis, however, we first must determine which shirts are prop-\nerly labeled as Confederate flag shirts and which are properly\nlabeled as protest shirts.\n\n   Some shirts are easily classified as Confederate flag shirts.\nThe \"Southern Chicks,\" \"Dixie Angels,\" \"Southern Girls,\"\n\"Black Confederates,\" Robert E. Lee, \"Girls Rule,\" \"Daddy’s\nLittle Redneck,\" and State House grounds shirts all clearly\ndisplay the Confederate flag, and Candice does not dispute\ntheir characterization as Confederate flag shirts.\n\n   Candice disagrees, however, with the district court’s classi-\nfication of five other shirts as Confederate flag shirts: the\n\"Jesus and the Confederate Battle Flag: Banned from Our\nSchools but Forever in Our Hearts,\" \"Offended by School\nCensorship of Southern Heritage,\" \"Honorary Member of the\nFBI: Federal Bigot Institutions,\" \"Our School Supports Free-\ndom of Speech for All (Except Southerners),\" and \"Public\nSchools Should Educate Not Discriminate Against Southern\nHeritage\" shirts. We disagree with Candice, and we consider\nthese shirts to be Confederate flag shirts. First, the \"Jesus and\nthe Confederate Battle Flag: Banned from Our Schools but\nForever in Our Hearts\" shirt includes a censored Confederate\nflag (that is, a Confederate flag with a red circle around it\nwith a red diagonal line across the diameter of the circle), as\nwell as the first Confederate national flag, the third Confeder-\nate national flag, and the Bonnie Blue flag, which are three\nother recognizable Confederate symbols. This shirt is there-\nfore a Confederate flag shirt. As for the other four shirts, their\nlettering reveals a Confederate flag. The red, white, and blue\ncoloring, in a diagonal cross, unmistakably represents the\nConfederate flag. These shirts are also thus properly consid-\nered Confederate flag shirts.\n\n   The record contains ample evidence from which the school\nofficials could reasonably forecast that all of these Confeder-\nate flag shirts \"would materially and substantially disrupt the\n\f                        HARDWICK v. HEYWARD                             17\nwork and discipline of the school.\" Tinker, 393 U.S. at 513.\nLatta is a small Southern town in which whites and African-\nAmericans were segregated, including in school, for more\nthan a century. When the schools were finally integrated in\nthe 1970-71 school year, the presence of racial tension was\nunderstandable. Over the past four decades, this tension has\ndiminished, but it has not completely disappeared, as numer-\nous incidents illustrate.\n\n   For example, the Confederate flag itself has caused prob-\nlems in Latta schools on multiple occasions, including the\nprom incident from the mid-1980s, the truck in the parking lot\nin the early 1990s, the debate over the flag on the State House\ndome in 2000, the classroom disruption that Heyward\ndescribed, and the belt buckle in 2009.14\n\n   Racial tension in Latta was not limited to incidents involv-\ning the Confederate flag. A nonflag-related example of such\ntension was the burning of an African-American church by\ntwo high school students. Cf. West, 206 F.3d at 1362 (consid-\nering off-campus occurrences when evaluating whether\nschool officials could reasonably predict that the Confederate\nflag would cause a substantial disruption at school).\n\n   These incidents, some involving the Confederate flag and\nsome not, demonstrate that continued racial tension exists in\nLatta schools. Taken together, they tell a story of a commu-\nnity and its schools that, although making progress in race\nrelations, are not immune from incidents of racial conflict.\n  14\n    Because the belt-buckle incident took place after her dispute with\nschool officials about Confederate flag shirts, Candice contends that we\ncannot consider this incident when evaluating the school officials’ deci-\nsion to ban the Confederate flag shirts and protest shirts.\n   We disagree. Although we do not rely solely on this incident to uphold\nthe school officials’ decision, we cannot turn a blind eye to the fact that\nthe incident occurred because it provides strong support for the reason-\nableness of the school officials’ determination that the Confederate flag\nwas likely to cause a substantial disruption at school.\n\f18                  HARDWICK v. HEYWARD\nAlthough the incidents caused by the Confederate flag are\nenough on their own to justify the decision of the school offi-\ncials to prohibit the Confederate flag shirts, when combined\nwith other racially charged incidents, they provide over-\nwhelming support for the conclusion that the Confederate flag\nshirts \"would materially and substantially disrupt the work\nand discipline of the school.\" Tinker, 393 U.S. at 513; see also\nDefoe, 625 F.3d at 335 (\"Tinker does not require that displays\nof the Confederate flag in fact cause substantial disruption or\ninterference, but rather that school officials reasonably fore-\ncasted that such displays could cause substantial disruption or\nmaterially interfere with the learning environment.\" (citing\nTinker, 393 U.S. at 514)); A.M. ex rel.

See J.A. 559–687.\nNotably, these records do contain racially charged incidents,\nindicating that at least some racial tension still exists. See,\ne.g., J.A. 564 (noting that a student was punished for an alter-\ncation that started after one student was called a \"cracker\");\nJ.A. 565 (noting that a student was punished for calling\nAfrican-American students \"n------\").\n\n  But putting aside these examples, the disciplinary records\nrepresent only a short period of time, from 2004 to 2007. The\nschool officials pointed to multiple incidents of racial tension\nover the past few decades. That some of these incidents may\nbe almost thirty years old does not mean that the school offi-\n\f                     HARDWICK v. HEYWARD                      19\ncials could not consider them in conjunction with more recent\nincidents. In considering the history of a town that has experi-\nenced slavery and segregation, incidents from even thirty\nyears ago are not so far removed from the present as to be\nirrelevant to determining the atmosphere of Latta schools. For\nthe school officials to consider the full picture when determin-\ning what might cause a disruption at school, they can consider\nthe causes of the types of incidents that they are trying to pre-\nvent from recurring. Therefore, that recent racially charged\nincidents are fewer in number or severity than such incidents\nfrom the more distant past does not prevent the school offi-\ncials from considering older incidents when determining\nwhether, based on the current school environment, a substan-\ntial disruption is likely to occur.\n\n   Related to her reliance on the alleged lack of racially\ncharged incidents in the schools’ disciplinary records, Can-\ndice contends that her shirts never caused any disruption and\nwere merely a \"silent, peaceable display\" of the Confederate\nflag that even drew positive remarks from some students.\nAppellant’s Br. at 29. Even assuming that Candice’s shirts\nnever caused a disruption, her argument misses the mark.\nThat her shirts never caused a disruption is not the issue;\nrather, the issue is whether school officials could reasonably\nforecast a disruption because of her shirts. See Tinker, 393\nU.S. at 513–14. As we have noted, \"a public school has the\npower to act to prevent problems before they occur, and the\nschool is not limited to prohibiting and punishing conduct\nonly after it has caused a disturbance.\" Newsom ex rel. New-\nsom, 354 F.3d at 259 n.7. We have already concluded that the\nschool officials met their burden of showing that they could\npredict that a substantial disruption might occur.\n\n   Similarly, Candice’s intent that her Confederate flag shirts\nbe only a symbol of her heritage and religious faith is irrele-\nvant. Again, the proper focus is whether school officials could\npredict that the Confederate flag shirts would cause a disrup-\ntion. See Tinker, 393 U.S. at 513–14; see also B.W.A. v.

As\nlong as school officials reasonably forecast a substantial dis-\nruption, they may act to prevent that disruption without violat-\ning a student’s constitutional rights, and we will not second\nguess their reasonable decisions. See Tinker, 393 U.S. at\n513–14. Here, multiple incidents of racial tension in Latta\nschools and the potential for such vastly different views\namong students about the meaning of the Confederate flag\nprovide a sufficient basis to justify the school officials’ con-\nclusion that the Confederate flag shirts would cause a substan-\ntial disruption. Therefore, Candice’s First Amendment right\nwas not violated by the school officials when they refused to\nallow her to wear the Confederate flag shirts at school.\n\n                                2.\n\n   We now turn to Candice’s First Amendment claim based\non the protest shirt. Like the Confederate flag shirts, we con-\nclude that the school officials reasonably predicted that the\nprotest shirt was likely to cause a substantial disruption.\n\n  Based on our determination that many of Candice’s so-\ncalled protest shirts were in fact Confederate flag shirts, only\none shirt can properly be classified as a protest shirt: the shirt\n\f                     HARDWICK v. HEYWARD                      21\ndisplaying the American flag with \"Old Glory\" above the flag\nand \"Flew over legalized slavery for 90 years!\" underneath it.\n\n   Whether the shirt makes a true statement is not a factor in\nour analysis. As long as a student’s speech is likely to cause\na substantial disruption, school officials can prohibit or punish\nthe speech. See id.\n\n   The protest shirt was undoubtedly likely to cause such a\ndisruption. It explicitly broadcast the fact that African-\nAmericans were slaves for part of American history, just as\nthe Confederate flag does for some people when they see it.\nThe same students who would be upset by the Confederate\nflag shirts would likely be equally upset by this protest shirt.\nThus, any disruptions that the Confederate flag shirts might\ncause could just as easily be caused by Candice’s protest shirt.\nThe school officials are therefore justified in relying on the\nsame past incidents of racial tension that allowed them to pro-\nhibit the Confederate flag shirts to prohibit this protest shirt.\nAccordingly, Candice’s First Amendment right was not vio-\nlated when the school officials did not allow her to wear the\nprotest shirt.\n\n                              IV.\n\n   We next address Candice’s Fourteenth Amendment claims\nthat the schools’ dress codes are unconstitutionally overbroad\nand vague, violating her right to due process, and that they are\nnot viewpoint neutral, violating her right to equal protection.\n\n                               A.\n\n   We begin with Candice’s facial challenge to the dress\ncodes on the basis that they violate due process because they\nare unconstitutionally overbroad and vague.\n\n                               1.\n\n  First, we consider Candice’s claim that the dress codes are\nunconstitutionally overbroad.

To\nprevail on an overbreadth claim, a plaintiff \"must demonstrate\nthat a regulation’s overbreadth is ‘not only . . . real, but sub-\nstantial as well, judged in relation to the [challenged regula-\ntion’s] plainly legitimate sweep,’ and also that no ‘limiting\nconstruction’ or ‘partial invalidation’ could ‘remove the\nseeming threat or deterrence to constitutionally protected\nexpression.’\" Newsom ex rel.

The middle school dress code prohibits clothes that\n\f                    HARDWICK v.

See J.A. 295–375. This clothing includes shirts\nthat are sexually suggestive, promote alcohol use, and pro-\nmote violence, all of which school officials could constitu-\ntionally prohibit under Tinker or Fraser. These examples of\nprohibited clothing indicate that the school officials construe\nthe dress codes in a way that does not violate students’ rights.\nSee West, 206 F.3d at 1368 (considering how school officials\nconstrued the school policy in determining whether the policy\nwas overbroad). Therefore, the dress codes are not overbroad,\nand Candice’s due process right was not violated.\n\n                               2.\n\n   We next examine whether the dress codes are unconstitu-\ntionally vague and thus violate due process. A law is uncon-\nstitutionally vague if \"it fails to establish standards for the\n[government] and public that are sufficient to guard against\nthe arbitrary deprivation of liberty interests.\" City of Chicago\nv.

Just as the overbreadth doctrine is designed\nto prevent self-censorship because of fear of a law’s enforce-\nment, the vagueness doctrine similarly ensures that a law does\n\f24                   HARDWICK v.

Furthermore, the doctrine also protects against\n\"arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement\" of the law. Mora-\nles, 527 U.S. at 56.\n\n   Despite the concerns about vague laws, school officials\nhave greater leeway when crafting school policy than legisla-\ntures do in adopting criminal statutes because of the need of\nschool officials to respond to \"a wide range of unanticipated\nconduct disruptive of the educational process.\" Fraser, 478\nU.S. at 686; see also Sypniewski, 307 F.3d at 260 (\"[T]he\ndemands of public secondary and elementary school disci-\npline are such that it is inappropriate to expect the same level\nof precision in drafting school disciplinary policies as is\nexpected of legislative bodies crafting criminal restrictions.\").\n\n   Here, nothing about the dress codes is so vague that Can-\ndice was unable to conform her speech to the required stan-\ndards. Again, the dress codes are guided by Tinker and\nFraser, and they are as specific as the dress code in Fraser\nthat the Supreme Court upheld when the student challenged\nthat dress code on due process grounds. See Fraser, 478 U.S.\nat 678. Furthermore, the school officials explicitly informed\nCandice on multiple occasions that Confederate flag shirts\nwere not permitted under the dress codes. The dress codes\nwere therefore interpreted by the school officials for Candice\nin the specific context of her shirts. Nothing in the record\nplausibly supports any claim that she was unaware of this pro-\nhibition on Confederate flag apparel. See A.M. ex rel. McAl-\nlum, 585 F.3d at 225 (holding that students’ due process rights\nwere not violated when the students \"were given a warning\nthat the particular speech at issue would give rise to disci-\npline\"). Thus, the dress codes, both as written and as applied\nto Confederate flag clothing, are not unconstitutionally vague,\nand Candice’s right to due process was not violated.\n\f                     HARDWICK v.

First, in\nTinker, the Court called \"relevant\" the fact that school offi-\ncials targeted speech about the Vietnam War but \"did not pur-\nport to prohibit the wearing of all symbols of political or\ncontroversial significance.\" Tinker, 393 U.S. at 510. Despite\nthis fact, the Court in Tinker based its holding on the fact that\nthe school officials could not predict that a substantial disrup-\ntion was likely to occur. See id. at 514. Such a prediction\nwould be a \"constitutionally valid reason[ ] to regulate [the\nstudents’] speech.\" Id. at 511. Without such a reason for\nschool officials to regulate speech, however, \"students are\nentitled to freedom of expression of their views.\" Id. Tinker\ntherefore stands for the proposition that school officials may\nnot target a specific viewpoint unless they can predict that that\nspeech would be likely to cause a substantial disruption. Id.\n(\"[T]he prohibition of expression of one particular opinion, at\nleast without evidence that it is necessary to avoid material\n\f26                  HARDWICK v.

In that case about the funding for an independent\nstudent newspaper with a religious perspective at a university,\nthe Court wrote, \"In the realm of private speech or expression,\ngovernment regulation may not favor one speaker over\nanother.\" Id. at 828. Such viewpoint discrimination is \"an\negregious form of content discrimination,\" and \"[t]he govern-\nment must abstain from regulating speech when the specific\nmotivating ideology or the opinion or perspective of the\nspeaker is the rationale for the restriction.\" Id. at 829.\n\n   Other circuits are split on the extent to which Rosenberger\nalters the analysis of Tinker.

The Eighth and Ninth\nCircuits have agreed with the Fifth Circuit’s position. See\n\f                    HARDWICK v. HEYWARD                     27\nB.W.A, 554 F.3d at 740; Harper v.

Harper ex rel. Harper v. Poway Uni-\nfied Sch. Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">549</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1262</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2007).\n\n   We need not decide in this case the relationship between\nTinker and Rosenberger. Assuming that a school dress code\nmust be viewpoint neutral on its face and in its enforcement,\nthe record here indicates that these requirements are met.\nFirst, both dress codes are viewpoint neutral. The middle\nschool policy prohibits clothing that would \"distract others,\ninterfere with the instructional programs, or otherwise cause\ndisruption. . . . [or] that displays profane language, drugs,\ntobacco, or alcohol advertisements, sexual innuendoes or any-\nthing else deemed to be offensive,\" while the high school pol-\nicy forbids \"[s]hirts with obscene/derogatory sayings,\" J.A.\n39, 45. Neither policy targets the Confederate flag or any\nother specific viewpoint, so each policy is viewpoint neutral.\n\n   Second, both dress codes are enforced in a viewpoint-\nneutral manner. The record contains pictures of many shirts\nthat Liebenrood required students to remove because they vio-\nlated the dress code, including two Malcolm X shirts, see J.A.\n348, 374, thereby undermining Candice’s claim that the\nschool officials \"did not evenhandedly ban all race sensitive\nsymbols,\" Appellant’s Br. at 47. The school officials indicated\nthat all racial symbols are banned under the dress codes. See\nJ.A. 133, 523.\n\n   Candice’s contention that school officials did not punish\nstudents for wearing other racially themed shirts is insuffi-\ncient to defeat summary judgment. See J.A. 28, 155. At most,\nthe evidence on which she relies proves that \"various students\n‘got away’\" with wearing clothes that violated the dress\ncodes. Defoe ex rel. Defoe, 625 F.3d at 337. By her own\nadmission, Candice \"got away\" with wearing at least one\nConfederate flag shirt when she wore the South Carolina State\nHouse grounds shirt \"for several days\" without being required\n\f28                  HARDWICK v. HEYWARD\nto change shirts because the shirt had not been \"brought to\n[Liebenrood’s] attention.\" J.A. 24–25. That some stu-\ndents—including Candice—avoided detection when wearing\nclothes that violated the dress codes is not evidence that the\ndress codes were enforced in a viewpoint-discriminatory man-\nner; rather, it is, without more, simply evidence that the dress\ncodes were not always enforced stringently. Given that Can-\ndice’s Confederate flag shirt and other racially themed shirts\nall escaped notice, this lack of enforcement was not based on\nany viewpoint discrimination, and Candice’s position that the\ndress codes were enforced in a viewpoint-discriminatory man-\nner is mere speculation. See Othentec Ltd. v. Phelan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1025737\"><a href=\"/opinion/1025737/othentec-ltd-v-phelan/\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">135</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 142 (4th Cir. 2008) (observing that a plaintiff’s \"allega-\ntions, speculation, and inference are not enough to survive\nsummary judgment\"). Candice’s right to equal protection was\ntherefore not violated by the dress codes or their enforcement.\n\n                              V.\n\n   Although students’ expression of their views and opinions\nis an important part of the educational process and receives\nsome First Amendment protection, the right of students to\nspeak in school is limited by the need for school officials to\nensure order, protect the rights of other students, and promote\nthe school’s educational mission. When, as here, student\nspeech threatens to disrupt school, school officials may pro-\nhibit or punish that speech. The Latta school officials there-\nfore did not violate Candice’s First Amendment right when\nthey refused to allow her to wear Confederate flag shirts and\nprotest shirts at school, and the dress codes and their enforce-\nment did not infringe on Candice’s Fourteenth Amendment\nrights. Thus, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\n                                                   AFFIRMED\n\f</pre>",
