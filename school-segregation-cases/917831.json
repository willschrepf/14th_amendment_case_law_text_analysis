With respect to the second issue raised by Mr. Soto, we direct the\n\ncourt to exclude from the judgment and sentence any finding of Mr. Soto's present or\n\nfuture ability to pay legal financial obligations and other expenses, since the record\n\nlacked support for such findings.\n\fNo. 30121-4-111\nState v. Soto\n\n\n                     FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n       David Soto was found guilty following a bench trial of animal cruelty in the first\n\ndegree and unlawful possession of a firearm in the first degree. The court found that in\n\ncommitting the animal cruelty offense, Mr. Soto was armed with a firearm. It imposed an\n\nI8-month firearm enhancement to run consecutive to its concurrent sentences of 12\n\nmonths for the animal cruelty conviction and 48 months for the firearm possession\n\nconviction.\n\n       Mr. Soto challenged the trial court's authority to impose a firearm enhancement on\n\na conviction for animal cruelty, which is an unranked crime. The trial court rejected his\n\nargument, construing RCW 9.94A.533, which provides for the enhancement, as applying\n\nto all felonies, ranked or unranked.\n\n       The judgment and sentence imposed legal financial obligations in the amount of\n\n$3,700. The court found that Mr. Soto had the present or likely future ability to pay the\n\nfinancial obligations imposed and the means to pay for the costs of incarceration and any\n\ncosts of medical care incurred while incarcerated. Mr. Sotoappeals.\n\n                                        ANALYSIS\n\n                                              I\n\n       We first address the statutory construction issue raised by Mr. Soto in the trial\n\ncourt: Must the sentence for an unranked offense be increased based upon a finding that\n\nthe offender was armed with a firearm in committing the offense?\n\n                                             2\n\n\fNo.30121-4-II1\nState v. Soto\n\n\n       The statute at issue is RCW 9.94A.533, entitled \"Adjustments to standard\n\nsentences.\" It provides for additional time to be added to the standard sentence ranges for\n\ncertain crimes in the event of aggravating circumstances identified by the statute.\n\nSubsection (3) of the statute addresses additional time to be added to the standard\n\nsentence range for felony crimes if the offender was armed with a firearm.\n\n       The first subsection ofRCW 9.94A.533 provides that \"[t]he provisions of this\n\nsection apply to the standard sentence ranges determined by RCW 9.94A.510 or\n\n9.94A.517.\" RCW 9.94A.510 is the \"Table I\" sentencing grid. Using the grid, a\n\nsentencing court determines the sentencing range and sentencing midpoints for an\n\noffender's conviction of a crime by finding the intersection of the offender's \"offender\n\nscore\" (based on criminal history) and the \"seriousness level\" of his or her crime (from I\n\nto XVI). The \"seriousness level\" for most crimes recognized by Washington statutes is\n\nset forth in \"Table 2,\" codified at RCW 9.94A.515.\n\n       RCW 9.94A.517 is the drug offense sentencing grid. It similarly identifies the\n\nsentencing range for an offender's conviction of a drug offense based on an offender's\n\noffender score and the seriousness level of the drug offense.\n\n       The offense of animal cruelty in the first degree is defined by RCW 16.52.205(1)­\n\n(3). It is a class C felony. RCW 16.52.205(4). Mr. Soto was charged with animal\n\ncruelty by intentionally inflicting substantial pain on an animal, causing physical injury to\n\nan animal, and/or killing an animal by a means that caused undue suffering, a violation of\n\n                                             3\n\n\fNo. 30121-4-111\nState v. Soto\n\n\nRCW 16.52.205(1). No seriousness level has been assigned to that means of committing\n\nfirst degree animal cruelty. See RCW 9.94A.515. A standard sentence range therefore\n\ncannot be determined for that means of committing the offense from RCW 9.94A.51 0,\n\nthe Table 1 sentencing grid, or from RCW 9.94A.517, the drug offense sentencing grid. l\n\n       Where no seriousness level has been assigned to an offense the court determines\n\nthe sentence by applying RCW 9.94A.505(2)(b), which provides:\n\n       If a standard sentence range has not been established for the offender's\n       crime, the court shall impose a determinate sentence which may include not\n       more than one year of confinement; community restitution work; a term of\n       community custody under RCW 9.94A.702 not to exceed one year; and/or\n       other legal financial obligations. The court may impose a sentence which\n       provides more than one year of confinement and a community custody term\n       under RCW 9.94A.701 if the court finds reasons justifying an exceptional\n       sentence as provided in RCW 9.94A.535.\n\n       \"Unranked offense\" is the term commonly applied to offenses that have not been\n\nassigned a seriousness level and whose standard sentencing range therefore cannot be\n\ndetermined on the Table I sentencing grid or drug offense sentencing grid. As observed\n\nby Division One of the Court of Appeals, \"[t]he Sentencing Guidelines Commission\n\nrecommends rankings to the legislature and does not recommend that all offenses be\n\nranked: 'The Commission decided not to rank certain felonies which seldom occur .... If,\n\nin the future, a significant number of persons are convicted of offenses not included in the\n\n\n       1A different means of committing first degree animal cruelty, involving sexual\nconduct or contact with an animal, see RCW 16.52.205(3), is given a seriousness rank of\nIII by RCW 9.94A.5l5.\n\n                                             4\n\n\fNo.30121-4-I11\nState v. Soto\n\n\nSeriousness Level Table, the Commission will recommend appropriate seriousness levels\n\nto the Legislature for those crimes. '\" In re Pers. Restraint ofAcron, 122 Wn. App. 886,\n\n890,95 P.3d 1272 (2004) (quoting WASH. STATE SENTENCING GUIDELINES COMM'N,\n\nADULT SENTENCING GUIDELINES MANUAL at II-57 (1993». Several hundred crimes are\n\npresently unranked. Most are class C felonies. See WASH. STATE CASELOAD FORECAST\n\nCOUNCIL, 20 12 WASHINGTON STATE ADULT SENTENCING GUIDELINES MANUAL § 5, at\n\n92-101 (version 20121231).\n\n       Mr. Soto, relying on the expressly limited scope ofRCW 9.94A.533 provided by\n\nits subsection (1), argues that the statute has no application to unranked offenses.\n\nLooking solely at subsection (1), he appears to be correct. The State successfully argued\n\nbelow and argues on appeal, however, that language appearing elsewhere in the statute\n\ncreates an ambiguity that we should resolve by deferring to what it argues was legislative\n\nintent to increase the penalty for firearm use by an offender committing any felony.\n\n       The State points to subsection (3) of the statute, which deals in particular with\n\nfirearm enhancements. It states in pertinent part:\n\n             (3) The following additional times shall be added to the standard\n       sentence range for felony crimes committed after July 23,1995, if the\n      offender or an accomplice was armed with a firearm ...\n             (a) Five years for any felony defined under any law as a class A\n      felony or with a statutory maximum sentence of at least twenty years, or\n      both, and not covered under (1) of this subsection;\n             (b) Three years for any felony defined under any law as a class B\n      felony or with a statutory maximum sentence of ten years, or both, and not\n      covered under (1) of this subsection;\n\n                                              5\n\n\fNo. 30121-4-111\nState v. Soto\n\n\n              (c) Eighteen months for any felony defined under any law as a class\n       C felony or with a statutory maximum sentence of five years, or both, and\n       not covered under (f) of this subsection.\n\nRCW 9.94A.533 (emphasis added). The State argues that these repeated references to\n\n\"any felony defmed under any law as a ... felony\" compels the conclusion that the\n\nlegislature intended the enhancements to apply to all felonies, ranked or unranked.\n\n       The State next points out that a few crimes are exempted from the mandatory\n\napplication ofRCW 9.94A.533(3) by paragraph (3)(f), which provides:\n\n               (f) The firearm enhancements in this section shall apply to all felony\n       crimes except the following: Possession of a machine gun, possessing a\n       stolen firearm, drive-by shooting, theft of a firearm, unlawful possession of\n       a firearm in the first and second degree, and use of a machine gun in a\n       felony.[2]\n\n(Emphasis added.) Here again, the State argues, the statutory language \"all felony\n\ncrimes\" must be read to apply uniformly to felonies.\n\n       The State finally points to subsection (6) of the statute, which provides increased\n\ntime for controlled substances offenses that take place in the presence of children or near\n\nschools, public parks, or on or in certain public transit vehicles or facilities. Subsection\n\n(6) provides that additional time \"shall be added to the standard sentence range for any\n\nranked offense involving a violation of chapter 69.50 RCW if the offense was also a\n\n\n       2 It has been pointed out that the exempted felonies are those in which using a\nfirearm is an element of the offense. State v. Brown, 139 Wn.2d 20, 25, 983 P.2d 608\n(1999) (quoting WASH. STATE SENTENCING GUIDELINES COMM'N, ADULT SENTENCING\nGUIDELINES MANUAL cmt. at 11-67 (1997».\n\n                                              6\n\n\fNo.30l2l-4-III\nState v. Soto\n\n\nviolation ofRCW 69.50.435 or 9.94A.827.\" RCW 9.94A.533(6) (emphasis added). The\n\nState argues that the reference to \"ranked offense\" would be superfluous if the scope of\n\nthe statute was already limited to ranked offenses.\n\n       Sentencing is a legislative power, not a judicial power. State v. Bryan, 93 Wn.2d\n\n177, 181,606 P.2d 1228 (1980). A trial court's discretion to impose sentence is limited\n\nto that granted by the legislature. State v. Ammons, 105 Wn.2d 175,713 P.2d 719,718\n\nP .2d 796 (1986). If the trial court exceeds its sentencing authority, its actions are void.\n\nState v. Phelps, 113 Wn. App. 347, 354-55, 57 PJd 624 (2002). Statutory construction is\n\na question oflaw and reviewed de novo. State v. Elmore, 154 Wn. App. 885,904-05,\n\n228 PJd 760 (2010).\n\n       When interpreting a statute, \"if the statute's meaning is plain on its face, then the\n\ncourt must give effect to that plain meaning as an expression of legislative intent.\" Dep't\n\no/Ecology v. Campbell & Gwinn, L.L.c., 146 Wn.2d 1,9-10,43 PJd 4 (2002). \"All\n\nwords must be read in the context of the statute in which they appear, not in isolation.\"\n\nState v. Lilyblad, 163 Wn.2d 1, 9, 177 P Jd 686 (2008). A statute is deemed ambiguous\n\nwhen the language is susceptible to more than one interpretation. State v. Jacobs, 154\n\nWn.2d 596, 600-01, 115 P.3d 281 (2005).\n\n       Reading all subsections ofRCW 9.94A.533 in the context of the statute, we\n\nconclude that the statute does not apply to unranked offenses. Subsection (1) of the\n\nstatute exists for one reason: to define the scope of the statute's application. It limits that\n\n                                               7\n\n\fNo.30121-4-III\nState v. Soto\n\n\nscope to \"standard sentence ranges determined by RCW 9.94A.51O or 9.94A.517.\"\n\n\"Under expressio unius est exclusio alterius, a canon of statutory construction, to express\n\none thing in a statute implies the exclusion of the other. Omissions are deemed to be\n\nexclusions.\" In re Det. o/Williams, 147 Wn.2d 476, 491, 55 P.3d 597 (2002) (citation\n\nomitted).\n\n       Nothing in subsection (1) suggests that the language \"standard sentence ranges\n\ndetermined by RCW 9.94A.51 0 or 9.94A.517\" is illustrative. We construe a statute's\n\nidentification of crimes or other items to be illustrative when the legislature states that the\n\nidentification is \"illustrative,\" or provides \"examples,\" or extends to \"similar\" or \"like\"\n\noffenses; absent such a signal, we read the legislature's list as exclusive and complete. In\n\nre Postsentence Review o/Leach, 161 Wn.2d 180, 185-86, 163 P.3d 782 (2007). We\n\ncannot amend an exclusive list of sentencing ranges subject to enhancement with others\n\nwe believe the legislature omitted; our Supreme Court has reminded us of its \"'long\n\nhistory of restraint in compensating for legislative omissions.'\" Id. at 186 (quoting State\n\nv. Taylor, 97 Wn.2d 724, 728, 649 P.2d 633 (1982».\n\n       By giving subsection (1) of the statute its plain meaning, we do not render the\n\nreferences to \"all felonies\" elsewhere in the statute meaningless; they are rationally\n\nunderstood to extend the sentencing enhancement to all felonies falling within the scope\n\nof the statute as defined by subsection (1).\n\n\n\n\n                                               8\n\n\fNo. 30121-4-III\nState v. Soto\n\n\n       Only subsection (6), providing that the statute applies to all \"ranked offenses\" of\n\nchapter 69.50 RCW, is superfluous if subsection (1) already limits the statute's scope to\n\nstandard range sentences determined for ranked offenses. But it is more reasonable to\n\nread subsection (6) as containing surplusage than to read subsection (I) as having no\n\nmeaning at all. And in light of subsection (6), it is beyond debate that the legislature\n\nintended its 24-month increase in confinement to apply only to the relatively serious and\n\ncommonly occurring crimes that the Sentencing Guidelines Commission had seen fit to\n\nrank-not to relatively uncommon, unranked crimes that are punishable, at most, by a\n\nyear of confinement, community restitution work, or a term of community custody. It is\n\nmore likely that the legislature intended for this distinction to apply to all of the\n\nenhancements provided by the statute-which it does, given our construction of\n\nsubsection (1)---than to apply only to the enhancement provided by subsection (6).\n\n       Although expressed in dicta, we note that at least one justice ofthe Washington\n\nSupreme Court and a panel of Division Two of the Court of Appeals have assumed that\n\nthe sentencing enhancements provided by RCW 9.94A.533 do not apply to unranked\n\nfelonies. See State v. Gurske, 155 Wn.2d 134, 152 n.l5, 118 P.3d 333 (2005) (Chambers,\n\nJ., concurring) (\"The statute exempts certain firearms offenses and does not address\n\nunranked felonies. RCW 9.94A.533(3)(f).\"); State v. Rainford, 86 Wn. App. 431,441\n\nn.6, 936 P.2d 1210 (1997) (\"RCW 9.94.041 [possession of controlled substances by\n\nprisoners] is an unranked felony under the Sentencing Reform Act of 1981 and is not\n\n                                               9\n\n\fNo. 30121-4-111\nState v.

Taylor, 97 Wn.2d at 728; see also\n\nState v. Mendoza, 63 Wn. App. 373, 378,819 P.2d 387 (1991). Appellate courts do not\n\nsupply omitted language even when the legislature's omission is clearly inadvertent,\n\nunless the omission renders the statute irrational. Acron, 122 Wn. App. at 891. \"To do\n\nso would [be] to arrogate to ourselves the power to make legislative schemes more\n\nperfect, more comprehensive and more consistent.\" Taylor, 97 Wn.2d at 729.\n\n       Because we conclude that RCW 9.94A.S33(3) does not apply to unranked\n\noffenses, the trial court's I8-month increase of Mr. Soto's sentence imposed for the\n\nanimal cruelty conviction was unauthorized and void.\n\n       We reverse the firearm sentence enhancement and remand for resentencing\n\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\n       The remainder of this opinion has no precedential value. Therefore, it will be filed\n\nfor public record in accordance with the rules governing unpublished opinions. RCW\n\n2.06.040.\n\n                                             II\n\n       Mr. Soto next contends that the trial court had no basis for its findings 2.7, 4.D.4,\n\nand 4.D.5 in the judgment and sentence that he has the current or future ability to pay\n\n                                             10 \n\n\fNo.30121-4-III\nState v. Soto\n\n\nlegal financial obligations (LFOs) and the means to pay costs of incarceration and\n\nmedical care. Under RCW 9.94A.760(1), the trial court may impose LFOs as part of the\n\nsentence, designating the total amount and segregating that amount according to separate\n\nassessments for restitution, costs, fines, and other required assessments. Under RCW\n\n9.94A.760(2), it may require the offender to pay for the costs of incarceration up to the\n\nmaximum authorized by the statute. But a defendant cannot be ordered to pay costs\n\nunless he or she is or will be able to pay them. RCW 10.01.160(3).\n\n       A trial court is not required to enter formal findings of fact about a defendant's\n\npresent or future ability to pay LFOs. State v. Bertrand, 165 Wn. App. 393, 404, 267\n\nP.3d 511 (2011) (citing State v. Baldwin, 63 Wn. App. 303,311,818 P.2d 1116,837 P.2d\n\n646 (1991)). However, \"the record must be sufficient for us to review whether 'the trial\n\ncourt judge took into account the financial resources of the defendant and the nature of\n\nthe burden' imposed by LFOs.\" ld. (quoting Baldwin, 63 Wn. App. at 312). We review\n\na trial court's findings as to a defendant's resources and ability to pay under the clearly\n\nerroneous standard. ld. at 403-04 & n.B.\n\n       The record of Mr. Soto's sentencing reveals that nothing was said about his ability\n\nor likely future ability to pay his LFOs. Here, as in Bertrand, the findings are clearly\n\nerroneous by virtue of the lack of support in the record.

We disagree and decline the suggestion.

Soto\n\n\n                     FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n       David Soto was found guilty following a bench trial of animal cruelty in the first\n\ndegree and unlawful possession of a firearm in the first degree. The court found that in\n\ncommitting the animal cruelty offense, Mr. Soto was armed with a firearm. It imposed an\n\nI8-month firearm enhancement to run consecutive to its concurrent sentences of 12\n\nmonths for the animal cruelty conviction and 48 months for the firearm possession\n\nconviction.\n\n       Mr. Soto challenged the trial court's authority to impose a firearm enhancement on\n\na conviction for animal cruelty, which is an unranked crime. The trial court rejected his\n\nargument, construing RCW 9.94A.533, which provides for the enhancement, as applying\n\nto all felonies, ranked or unranked.\n\n       The judgment and sentence imposed legal financial obligations in the amount of\n\n$3,700. The court found that Mr. Soto had the present or likely future ability to pay the\n\nfinancial obligations imposed and the means to pay for the costs of incarceration and any\n\ncosts of medical care incurred while incarcerated. Mr. Sotoappeals.\n\n                                        ANALYSIS\n\n                                              I\n\n       We first address the statutory construction issue raised by Mr. Soto in the trial\n\ncourt: Must the sentence for an unranked offense be increased based upon a finding that\n\nthe offender was armed with a firearm in committing the offense?\n\n                                             2\n\n\fNo.30121-4-II1\nState v. Soto\n\n\n       The statute at issue is RCW 9.94A.533, entitled \"Adjustments to standard\n\nsentences.\" It provides for additional time to be added to the standard sentence ranges for\n\ncertain crimes in the event of aggravating circumstances identified by the statute.\n\nSubsection (3) of the statute addresses additional time to be added to the standard\n\nsentence range for felony crimes if the offender was armed with a firearm.\n\n       The first subsection ofRCW 9.94A.533 provides that \"[t]he provisions of this\n\nsection apply to the standard sentence ranges determined by RCW 9.94A.510 or\n\n9.94A.517.\" RCW 9.94A.510 is the \"Table I\" sentencing grid. Using the grid, a\n\nsentencing court determines the sentencing range and sentencing midpoints for an\n\noffender's conviction of a crime by finding the intersection of the offender's \"offender\n\nscore\" (based on criminal history) and the \"seriousness level\" of his or her crime (from I\n\nto XVI). The \"seriousness level\" for most crimes recognized by Washington statutes is\n\nset forth in \"Table 2,\" codified at RCW 9.94A.515.\n\n       RCW 9.94A.517 is the drug offense sentencing grid. It similarly identifies the\n\nsentencing range for an offender's conviction of a drug offense based on an offender's\n\noffender score and the seriousness level of the drug offense.\n\n       The offense of animal cruelty in the first degree is defined by RCW 16.52.205(1)­\n\n(3). It is a class C felony. RCW 16.52.205(4). Mr. Soto was charged with animal\n\ncruelty by intentionally inflicting substantial pain on an animal, causing physical injury to\n\nan animal, and/or killing an animal by a means that caused undue suffering, a violation of\n\n                                             3\n\n\fNo. 30121-4-111\nState v. Soto\n\n\nRCW 16.52.205(1). No seriousness level has been assigned to that means of committing\n\nfirst degree animal cruelty. See RCW 9.94A.515. A standard sentence range therefore\n\ncannot be determined for that means of committing the offense from RCW 9.94A.51 0,\n\nthe Table 1 sentencing grid, or from RCW 9.94A.517, the drug offense sentencing grid. l\n\n       Where no seriousness level has been assigned to an offense the court determines\n\nthe sentence by applying RCW 9.94A.505(2)(b), which provides:\n\n       If a standard sentence range has not been established for the offender's\n       crime, the court shall impose a determinate sentence which may include not\n       more than one year of confinement; community restitution work; a term of\n       community custody under RCW 9.94A.702 not to exceed one year; and/or\n       other legal financial obligations. The court may impose a sentence which\n       provides more than one year of confinement and a community custody term\n       under RCW 9.94A.701 if the court finds reasons justifying an exceptional\n       sentence as provided in RCW 9.94A.535.\n\n       \"Unranked offense\" is the term commonly applied to offenses that have not been\n\nassigned a seriousness level and whose standard sentencing range therefore cannot be\n\ndetermined on the Table I sentencing grid or drug offense sentencing grid. As observed\n\nby Division One of the Court of Appeals, \"[t]he Sentencing Guidelines Commission\n\nrecommends rankings to the legislature and does not recommend that all offenses be\n\nranked: 'The Commission decided not to rank certain felonies which seldom occur .... If,\n\nin the future, a significant number of persons are convicted of offenses not included in the\n\n\n       1A different means of committing first degree animal cruelty, involving sexual\nconduct or contact with an animal, see RCW 16.52.205(3), is given a seriousness rank of\nIII by RCW 9.94A.5l5.\n\n                                             4\n\n\fNo.30121-4-I11\nState v.

STATE SENTENCING GUIDELINES COMM'N,\n\nADULT SENTENCING GUIDELINES MANUAL at II-57 (1993». Several hundred crimes are\n\npresently unranked. Most are class C felonies. See WASH. STATE CASELOAD FORECAST\n\nCOUNCIL, 20 12 WASHINGTON STATE ADULT SENTENCING GUIDELINES MANUAL § 5, at\n\n92-101 (version 20121231).\n\n       Mr. Soto, relying on the expressly limited scope ofRCW 9.94A.533 provided by\n\nits subsection (1), argues that the statute has no application to unranked offenses.\n\nLooking solely at subsection (1), he appears to be correct. The State successfully argued\n\nbelow and argues on appeal, however, that language appearing elsewhere in the statute\n\ncreates an ambiguity that we should resolve by deferring to what it argues was legislative\n\nintent to increase the penalty for firearm use by an offender committing any felony.\n\n       The State points to subsection (3) of the statute, which deals in particular with\n\nfirearm enhancements. It states in pertinent part:\n\n             (3) The following additional times shall be added to the standard\n       sentence range for felony crimes committed after July 23,1995, if the\n      offender or an accomplice was armed with a firearm ...\n             (a) Five years for any felony defined under any law as a class A\n      felony or with a statutory maximum sentence of at least twenty years, or\n      both, and not covered under (1) of this subsection;\n             (b) Three years for any felony defined under any law as a class B\n      felony or with a statutory maximum sentence of ten years, or both, and not\n      covered under (1) of this subsection;\n\n                                              5\n\n\fNo. 30121-4-111\nState v. Soto\n\n\n              (c) Eighteen months for any felony defined under any law as a class\n       C felony or with a statutory maximum sentence of five years, or both, and\n       not covered under (f) of this subsection.\n\nRCW 9.94A.533 (emphasis added). The State argues that these repeated references to\n\n\"any felony defmed under any law as a ... felony\" compels the conclusion that the\n\nlegislature intended the enhancements to apply to all felonies, ranked or unranked.\n\n       The State next points out that a few crimes are exempted from the mandatory\n\napplication ofRCW 9.94A.533(3) by paragraph (3)(f), which provides:\n\n               (f) The firearm enhancements in this section shall apply to all felony\n       crimes except the following: Possession of a machine gun, possessing a\n       stolen firearm, drive-by shooting, theft of a firearm, unlawful possession of\n       a firearm in the first and second degree, and use of a machine gun in a\n       felony.[2]\n\n(Emphasis added.) Here again, the State argues, the statutory language \"all felony\n\ncrimes\" must be read to apply uniformly to felonies.\n\n       The State finally points to subsection (6) of the statute, which provides increased\n\ntime for controlled substances offenses that take place in the presence of children or near\n\nschools, public parks, or on or in certain public transit vehicles or facilities. Subsection\n\n(6) provides that additional time \"shall be added to the standard sentence range for any\n\nranked offense involving a violation of chapter 69.50 RCW if the offense was also a\n\n\n       2 It has been pointed out that the exempted felonies are those in which using a\nfirearm is an element of the offense.

But it is more reasonable to\n\nread subsection (6) as containing surplusage than to read subsection (I) as having no\n\nmeaning at all.

Under RCW 9.94A.760(1), the trial court may impose LFOs as part of the\n\nsentence, designating the total amount and segregating that amount according to separate\n\nassessments for restitution, costs, fines, and other required assessments. Under RCW\n\n9.94A.760(2), it may require the offender to pay for the costs of incarceration up to the\n\nmaximum authorized by the statute. But a defendant cannot be ordered to pay costs\n\nunless he or she is or will be able to pay them.

Baldwin, 63 Wn. App. 303,311,818 P.2d 1116,837 P.2d\n\n646 (1991)). However, \"the record must be sufficient for us to review whether 'the trial\n\ncourt judge took into account the financial resources of the defendant and the nature of\n\nthe burden' imposed by LFOs.\" ld. (quoting Baldwin, 63 Wn. App. at 312). We review\n\na trial court's findings as to a defendant's resources and ability to pay under the clearly\n\nerroneous standard. ld. at 403-04 & n.B.\n\n       The record of Mr. Soto's sentencing reveals that nothing was said about his ability\n\nor likely future ability to pay his LFOs. Here, as in Bertrand, the findings are clearly\n\nerroneous by virtue of the lack of support in the record. The appropriate remedy would\n\nordinarily be to reverse the finding of ability to pay and remand to the trial court with\n\ndirections to strike the findings from the judgment and sentence. In this case we reverse\n\n                                             11 \n\n\fNo.30121-4-II1\nState v. Soto\n\n\nthe findings but, since the case is otherwise being remanded for resentencing, we direct\n\nthe trial court to omit findings as to ability to pay that are not supported by evidence in\n\nthe record.\n\n       The State concedes that the trial court lacked a basis for its finding but suggests a\n\ndifferent remedy: that we direct the trial court on remand to develop a record supporting\n\nthe findings. We disagree and decline the suggestion. As Baldwin holds, \"the\n\nmeaningful time to examine the defendant's ability to pay is when the government seeks\n\nto collect the obligation.\" Baldwin, 63 Wn. App. at 310.\n\n       We reverse the firearm sentence enhancement and remand for resentencing\n\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                               -~.tlCt\n                                               Siddoway, A.C.J.\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\n\nBrown, J.\n\n\n\nKulik, J.\n\n\n\n\n                                              12 \n\n\f</pre>",
