Hunt is a retired Eastern Air Lines (“Eastern”)\n\npilot seeking to recover a lump-sum retirement benefit under the\n\nEastern Air Lines Variable Benefit Retirement Plan for Pilots\n\n(the “Plan”).1   Eastern, the Plan’s administrator, which is a\n\ndebtor before the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of\n\nNew York, has refused to pay the benefit because the Plan has\n\nbeen amended, with the approval of the bankruptcy court, to\n\nforeclose the lump-sum benefit Hunt seeks.   As the Plan now\n\nstands, Hunt is entitled to receive only a modified lump-sum\n\nbenefit: he may receive a partial distribution immediately and\n\nsubsequent payments over time as the Plan’s assets are\n\nliquidated.\n\n     Hunt rejected this modified lump-sum benefit, as well as\n\nother payment options provided under the Plan, and sued Eastern;\n\nthe Air Line Pilots Association (“ALPA”), the pilots’ union;\n\nCharles H. Copeland, the Chairman of the Trust Administrative\n\nCommittee (the “TAC”), the Plan’s named fiduciary; Paul M.\n\nO’Connor, Jr., of O'Connor, Morris & Jones, the TAC’s legal\n\ncounsel (the “O'Connor law firm”); and Hawthorne Associates, Inc.\n\n(“Hawthorne”), the TAC’s principal investment advisor, to recover\n\nhis retirement benefit in a lump sum.   Hunt brought his suit\n\nunder the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974\n\n(\"ERISA\"), Pub. L. No. 93-406, 88 Stat. 829, 29 U.S.C. §§ 1001-\n\n\n     1\n        The Plan’s originating document refers to the plan as the\n“B-Plan.” For simplicity, we use the name “Plan.”\n\n                                 2\n\f1461 (1994).   His complaint, framed in six counts, asked for\n\ncompensatory and punitive damages, injunctive relief in the form\n\nof an order requiring the defendants to pay his lump-sum benefit,\n\nstatutory penalties, and attorneys’ fees.\n\n     Eastern’s Bankruptcy Trustee, in a motion for summary\n\njudgment, contended that Eastern could not be held liable to Hunt\n\nbecause it had properly discharged its responsibilities as\n\nadministrator under the Plan.   Later, when opposing Hunt's motion\n\nfor leave to filed an amended complaint, Eastern argued that\n\nHunt’s claim for a lump-sum benefit had been foreclosed by a\n\nbankruptcy court ruling against Hunt in Eastern’s bankruptcy\n\ncase.   In an apparent attempt to avoid the effect of this ruling,\n\nHunt voluntarily dismissed Eastern from the case with prejudice\n\nand, with leave of court, filed an amended complaint against\n\nthree defendants -- Hawthorne, the TAC, and the Plan -- that\n\nasserted essentially the same claims presented in his initial\n\ncomplaint.\n\n     The case was tried to the district court; by that time, the\n\nonly defendants before the court were the TAC and the Plan.\n\nWithout referring to the bankruptcy court’s ruling against Hunt,\n\nthe court held that he was entitled to his lump-sum benefit and\n\nentered judgment for Hunt in the amount of that benefit.   The\n\njudgment stated that the benefit was to be satisfied out of the\n\nPlan's fund of assets.   The court rejected Hunt’s remaining\n\nclaims and entered judgment for the defendants.\n\n\n\n                                 3\n\f       The TAC and the Plan now appeal.    Hunt cross-appeals the\n\ncourt’s rejection of his claim requesting the court to impose a\n\nstatutory penalty on the defendants.      We reverse the court’s\n\njudgment against the TAC and the Plan, and affirm its judgment on\n\nthe statutory-penalty claim.\n\n\n\n                                  I.\n\n       Hunt claims that, under ERISA and the provisions of the\n\nPlan, he is entitled to recover his retirement benefits in a lump\n\nsum.    Unlike the typical scenario in which a participant in an\n\nemployee benefit plan sues to recover ERISA benefits, Hunt sought\n\nhis lump-sum payment while the administrator of the Plan,\n\nEastern, was undergoing a highly publicized bankruptcy proceeding\n\nthat ultimately resulted in the company’s demise.     In addition to\n\nscrutinizing ERISA and the provisions and operation of the Plan,\n\nwe must therefore consider the interrelationship between the Plan\n\nand Eastern's bankruptcy in order to evaluate Hunt's claims for\n\nrelief.\n\n\n\n                                  A.\n\n       ERISA is a “comprehensive and reticulated statute” that\n\ncreated a framework for the administration and maintenance of\n\nprivate employee benefit plans.    Nachman Corp. v. Pension Benefit\nGuaranty Corp., 446 U.S. 359, 361, 100 S.Ct. 1723, 1726, 64\n\nL.Ed.2d 354 (1980).    The cornerstone of an ERISA plan is the\n\nwritten instrument, which must provide for “the allocation of\n\n\n                                  4\n\fresponsibilities for the operation and administration of the\n\nplan.”   ERISA § 402(b)(2), 29 U.S.C. § 1102(b)(2); see also ERISA\n\n§ 402(a)(1), 29 U.S.C. § 1102(a)(1) (“Every employee benefit plan\n\nshall be established and maintained pursuant to a written\n\ninstrument.”).\n\n     The written instrument must designate an “administrator,”\n\nERISA § 3(16)(A)(i), 29 U.S.C. § 1002(16)(A)(i), “to run the plan\n\nin accordance with the . . . governing plan documents.”     Curtiss-\n\nWright Corp. v. Schoonejongen, 514 U.S. 73, 115 S.Ct. 1223, 1231,\n\n131 L.Ed.2d 94 (1995); see also Varity Corp. v. Howe, 116 S.Ct.\n\n1065, 1086, 134 L.Ed.2d 130 (1996) (“Essentially, to administer\n\nthe plan is to implement its provisions and to carry out plan\n\nduties imposed by [ERISA].”) (Thomas, J., dissenting).      In some\n\ninstances, ERISA imposes specific obligations on the plan\n\nadministrator.   See, e.g., ERISA § 101(b), 29 U.S.C. § 1021(b)\n\n(duty to file plan description, modifications and changes, and\n\nreports with the Department of Labor); ERISA § 105(a), 29 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1025(a) (duty to provide plan participants with information\n\nregarding their benefits).\n\n     The written instrument must also “provide for one or more\n\nnamed fiduciaries who jointly or severally shall have authority\n\nto control and manage the operation and administration of the\n\nplan.”   ERISA § 402(a)(1), 29 U.S.C. § 1102(a)(1).   The\n\nadministrator, as well as the named fiduciary, is considered a\n\n\n\n\n                                 5\n\f“fiduciary” under ERISA.2   Both the administrator and the named\n\nfiduciary must discharge their duties “in accordance with the\n\ndocuments and instruments governing the plan insofar as such\n\ndocuments and instruments are consistent with [ERISA],”   ERISA §\n\n404(a)(1)(D), 29 U.S.C. § 1104(a)(1)(D), “for the exclusive\n\npurpose of providing benefits to participants and their\n\nbeneficiaries,” ERISA § 404(a)(1)(A), 29 U.S.C. § 1104(a)(1)(A).\n\nBecause both the plan administrator and named fiduciary must\n\ndischarge their duties in accordance with the written instrument,\n\nwe examine the provisions of the Plan in detail.3\n\n\n\n                                B.\n\n\n\n\n     2\n       The term “fiduciary” has a broader meaning under ERISA\nthan at common law because ERISA “defines 'fiduciary' not in\nterms of formal trusteeship, but in functional terms of control\nand\nauthority over the plan.” Mertens v. Hewitt Associates, 508 U.S.\n248, 262, 113 S.Ct. 2063, 2071, 124 L.Ed.2d 161 (1993). Under\nERISA § 3(21)(A), 29 U.S.C. § 1002(21)(A), a fiduciary includes\nnot only those who “exercise[] any discretionary authority or\ndiscretionary control respecting management of such plan or\nexercise[] any authority or control respecting management or\ndisposition of its assets,” but also those who “[have]\ndiscretionary authority or discretionary responsibility in the\nadministration of such plan.” The Supreme Court has referred to\nERISA's definition of fiduciary as “artificial.” Mertens, 508\nU.S. at 255 n.5.\n     3\n       Given the seminal importance of the written instrument\nunder ERISA, we are puzzled why the parties made little more than\na passing reference to the Plan documents in their briefs and at\noral argument.\n     For simplicity and clarity, we refer to the specific\nprovisions of the Plan by citing directly to the relevant section\nor subsection. In some instances, the title of the section or\nsubsection is noted parenthetically.\n\n                                 6\n\f     The Plan is a variable benefit pension plan for Eastern\n\npilots that was created in 1958 pursuant to a collective\n\nbargaining agreement between Eastern and ALPA.     The parties\n\nrewrote the Plan in the 1970s to comply with ERISA and\n\nsubsequently amended it in 1986.4\n\n     The Plan is a “defined contribution plan.”5    According to 26\n\nU.S.C. § 414(i), a defined contribution plan is a “plan [that]\n\nprovides for an individual account for each participant and for\n\nbenefits based solely on the amount contributed to the\n\nparticipant's account, and any income, expenses, gains and\n\nlosses, and any forfeitures of accounts of other participants\n\nwhich may be allocated to such participant's account.”     More\n\nsimply, in the words of an ALPA newsletter sent to Eastern\n\npilots, a participant's interest in a defined contribution plan\n\nis “determined solely by contributions made in a beneficiary's\n\nname and the subsequent investment performance of those\n\ncontributions.”   The Plan requires that Eastern make\n\ncontributions on behalf of each participant, see § 4.1 (“Eastern\n\nContributions”),6 for investment in stocks, bonds, real estate,\n\n     4\n       The original written instrument that established the Plan\nis known as \"Document 91.\" The 1986 amendment is known as\n“Document 91A.”\n     5\n       Section 12.14 of the Plan, titled “Plan Is Defined\nContribution Plan,” states: “Since [the Plan's inception], the\nPlan has been and continues to be a defined contribution plan.”\nThis section appears in Document 91C, an amendment to the Plan\nthat will be discussed in part I.D, infra.\n     6\n       According to the original agreement, Eastern was to\ncontribute on behalf of each participant an amount equal to 11%\nof his compensation. On February 23, 1986, Eastern and ALPA\n\n                                 7\n\fand other assets.   These investments constitute the Plan’s\n\n“Variable Fund” (the “Fund”).    See § 1.36 (“Variable Fund”).7   As\n\na result, the value of a participant's interest in the Plan\n\ndepends not only upon the funds contributed but also on the\n\ninvestment return on the Fund's assets.    See Borst v. Chevron\n\nCorp., 36 F.3d 1308, 1311 n.2 (5th Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 115\n\nS.Ct. 1699, 131 L.Ed.2d 561 (1995).    The value of the Fund is\n\ncalculated annually as of December 31 of each calendar year.      See\n\n§ 5.1 (“Fund Value”).\n\n     The Plan designates Eastern as the “plan administrator.\"\n\nEastern has “those powers necessary to carry out the day to day\n\noperation of the Plan.”   See § 2.2(a) (“Administration”).    Those\n\npowers include the broad responsibility to “initially determine\n\nall questions arising from the administration, interpretation,\n\nand application of the Plan pursuant to all applicable law,\n\nagreements and contracts and such determination shall be binding\n\nupon all persons, except as otherwise provided by law, and\n\nfurther provided that each Participant shall be granted the same\n\n\nsigned a collective bargaining agreement that adjusted Eastern's\ncontribution level in two ways: (1) for pilots employed before\nMarch 2, 1986, Eastern's contribution was set at 10% effective\nJanuary 1, 1988; (2) for pilots employed on or after March 2,\n1986, Eastern's contribution was set at 3%. In addition,\nparticipants had the option of contributing up to 10% of their\nearnings as “optional additional contributions” to augment their\ninterest in the Plan. See § 4.2 (“Optional Additional\nContributions”).\n     7\n       According to § 1.36,   the Fund is “the property of the\nPlan, . . . all of which is   held in trust pursuant to Trust\nAgreement between the [TAC]   and State Street Bank and Trust\nCompany . . . and any other   trust created for such purpose by the\n[TAC].”\n\n                                  8\n\ftreatment under similar conditions.”   Id.   The Plan also charges\n\nEastern with the responsibility for, inter alia, keeping records,\n\nsee § 2.4 (“Records”), preparing and distributing periodic Plan\nsummaries, see § 2.5 (“Plan Summary”), and sending to each\n\nparticipant an annual statement reflecting the value of his\n\ninvestment in the Plan, see § 2.6 (“Annual Statement”).   Section\n\n13.1 of Article XIII, which is titled “Modification, Suspension\n\nor Discontinuance,” grants Eastern the authority to unilaterally\n\nmodify, suspend, or discontinue any feature of the Plan, provided\n\nthat any such action does not \"adversely affect\" any benefits\n\n\"already provided\" to a participant under the Plan.   An exercise\n\nof this authority, however, would not constitute an amendment to\n\nthe Plan.8\n\n     The Plan designates the TAC, a small committee that monitors\n\nthe management of the Plan’s assets,9 as its \"named fiduciary.\"\n\n     8\n       The Plan documents do not explicitly describe how the Plan\nmay be formally amended. The closest provision is § 14.1, which\nstates that Eastern and ALPA must agree upon any modification\nthat is necessary for the Plan to qualify as a pension plan under\nERISA. See § 14.1 (“Qualification of Plan”). The record makes\nclear, however, that both Eastern and ALPA must approve any\nsubstantive amendment to the Plan, with the exception of an\namendment made pursuant to § 1113(e) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11\nU.S.C. § 1113(e). See infra note 20.\n     9\n       The TAC initially consisted of two members selected by\nALPA, two members selected by Eastern, and three “outside”\nmembers chosen by ALPA and Eastern. By the time of the events\ninvolved in the present controversy, the Plan had been amended to\nprovide that two members were to be selected by ALPA, and five\noutside members would be appointed by the existing TAC members\nwith ALPA’s approval. TAC’s outside members at this time\nincluded former President Gerald R. Ford; a former president of\nCiticorp, William I. Spencer; a former chairman of the board of\nMetropolitan Life Insurance Company, George P. Jenkins; and a\nformer dean of the Harvard Business School, Lawrence E. Fouraker.\n\n                                9\n\fUnder the Plan, the TAC has \"overall supervisory responsibility\n\nof the administrative functions of the Fund,\" see § 2.13(b)(i)\n\n(“Fund Administration”), and the duty \"to maintain surveillance\n\nover the status and administration of the Plan and the [Fund],\"\n\nsee § 10.2(b) (“Rights and Duties of the [TAC]”).   It must\n\n“regularly and periodically suppl[y]” information to ALPA about\n\n“transactional detail, cash flow reports, investment status,\n\ndocumentation and Fund performance,” see § 2.11 (“Information and\n\nAccountability”), and furnish to ALPA and Plan participants\n\nreports about the TAC's “functions, actions, and decisions . . .\n\nas are reasonable and appropriate.”   See § 10.2(c).   Furthermore,\n\nthe TAC is charged with the responsibility of selecting and\n\nreplacing investment advisors and trustees of the Fund's assets,\n\nsee § 2.7(b) (“Trust Agreement and Trustee”), as well as giving\n\ndirections and instructions to these trustees, see § 2.8\n\n(“Directions to Trustee(s)”).   Before selecting or replacing\n\ninvestment advisors or trustees, however, the TAC must notify\n\nALPA of the TAC's planned course of action and give ALPA an\n\nopportunity to respond, see § 2.7(b), thus effectively giving\n\nALPA a quasi-veto power over these decisions.   Similarly, before\n\ngiving any notice or instruction to a Fund trustee, the TAC must\n\nnotify ALPA and give it fifteen days to object.   See § 2.8.\n\n\n\n\n     The compensation for the outside TAC members is paid by the\nFund, see § 2.2(b)(iii), whereas the compensation for TAC members\nfrom ALPA is paid by ALPA, see § 10.1(b)(ii).\n\n                                10\n\f     Pursuant to its authority under sections 2.7 and 2.13(d),10\n\nthe TAC hired Hawthorne as the Plan's principal investment\n\nadvisor/manager for the time period relevant in this case.\n\nHawthorne's duties are enumerated in a written “investment\n\nadvisor agreement\" between the TAC and Hawthorne.   According to\n\nthe testimony of Hawthorne's chairman, Charles G. Dyer, Hawthorne\n\nassumed many of the TAC’s administrative duties involving the\n\nFund and its assets, including the scheduling of TAC meetings and\n\nthe release of quarterly statements to participants about the\n\nvalue of the Fund's assets.   In essence, Hawthorne served \"at the\n\npleasure of the [TAC].\"\n\n\n\n                                C.\n\n     Since the Plan's inception, an Eastern pilot choosing normal\n\nor early retirement could elect to receive his benefits in the\n\nform of monthly annuity payments.11   Beginning in 1983, a\n\n\n\n     10\n       According to § 2.13(d), the TAC “may delegate to any\nperson, including, but not limited to, Investment Advisors, all\nor any portion of the [TAC's] powers, duties and responsibilities\nto establish and maintain a Fund Office, to maintain records and\nto prepare reports and documentation. The [TAC] shall make such\ndelegations in writing and is authorized to pay reasonable fees,\ncharges and costs of the person or persons providing such\nservice.” This delegation of authority is consistent with ERISA.\nSee ERISA § 402(c)(3), 29 U.S.C. § 1102(c)(3).\n     11\n       The Plan provided participants with a panoply of annuity\noptions. Retiring pilots selecting an annuity could choose from\nthe post-retirement joint and survivor annuity, the contingent\nannuity, the level income option, the life annuity option, and\nthe deferred payment option. See § 6.2 (“Available Forms of\nPayment”). There also was a disability benefit option. See §\n6.3 (“Disability Benefit”).\n\n                                11\n\fretiring pilot also could elect to receive his benefits in the\n\nform of a lump-sum payment.\n\n     Processing an application for a lump-sum benefit involved\n\nfive steps.12    First, a pilot seeking a lump-sum payment would\n\ncomplete the necessary paperwork and inform the Chief Pilot, an\n\nEastern management employee, of his intention to retire.    Second,\n\nthe Chief Pilot would check to make sure that the pilot met age\n\ncriteria to qualify for normal or early retirement benefits under\n\nthe Plan.13    Third, if the pilot met the age qualifications, the\n\nChief Pilot would inform the Eastern Pension and Insurance\n\nDepartment about the pilot's decision to retire.    Fourth, the\n\nEastern Pension and Insurance Department would contact the Plan's\n\nactuary, William M. Mercer, Inc., which would determine the\n\nprecise amount of benefits to which the retiring pilot was\n\nentitled.     Fifth, the actuary would then give that information to\n\nthe State Street Bank & Trust Company, a Plan trustee, which\n\nwould make the distribution to the pilot.    The lump-sum payment\n\n\n\n\n     12\n       The Plan does not explicitly set forth the procedure for\nprocessing claims for retirement benefits. The above account of\nthe claims-processing procedure is taken from the deposition and\naffidavit of Charles Dyer of Hawthorne and from the affidavit of\nBrian P. White, who served as Director of the Eastern Pension and\nInsurance Department. Both accounts of Eastern's claims-\nprocessing procedure are virtually identical. After the trial,\nthe district court, in fashioning its order directing the entry\nof judgment, relied exclusively on the account given in the White\naffidavit.\n     13\n       Normal retirement age under the Plan is 60. See § 1.22\n(“Normal Retirement Age”). The minimum early retirement age is\n50. See § 1.15 (“Early Retirement Date”).\n\n                                  12\n\fwould be equal to the entire actuarial present value14 of the\n\npilot's accrued benefit15 as of his effective retirement date.16\n\nSee § 6.2(e)(i) (“Lump Sum Option”).   A pilot dissatisfied with\n\nthe disposition of his application for benefits could pursue\n\nadministrative relief with the Pension Dispute Board pursuant to\n\nArticle XI (“Determination of Disputes”) of the Plan.17\n\n\n\n                                D.\n\n     In the late 1980s, Eastern was experiencing severe financial\n\ndifficulties against the backdrop of a highly publicized labor\n\ndispute.   On March 9, 1989, Eastern filed for bankruptcy\n\nprotection under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §§\n\n     14\n       “Actuarial present value” is the current value of monthly\nbenefits determined by the current value of an annuity unit at\nthe most recent valuation. See § 1.6 (“Actuarial Present\nValue”).\n     15\n       An “accrued benefit” is essentially the total number of\n“annuity units” credited to the account of a participant. See §\n1.2 (“Accrued Benefit”). An annuity unit is a unit of measure\nrepresenting a share in the Fund. See § 1.7 (“Annuity Unit”).\n     16\n       “Effective retirement date” essentially means the normal\nretirement date or early retirement date. See § 1.18 (“Effective\nRetirement Date”). The normal retirement date is the first day\nof the month coinciding with or otherwise next following a\nparticipant's 60th birthday. See § 1.23 (“Normal Retirement\nDate”). The early retirement date is the first day of the month\non which a participant elects to retire and receive a pension,\nprovided that he is at least 50 years old. See § 1.15(a) (“Early\nRetirement Date”).\n     17\n       The Pension Dispute Board consisted of four members: two\nwere selected by Eastern and two were selected by ALPA. The\nBoard had the authority to hear and determine “[a]ll disputes\nconcerning the application, interpretation or administration of\nthe Plan in respect to individual employees and their\nparticipation in or their benefits under the Plan.” § 11.2\n(“Authority [of Pension Dispute Board]”).\n\n                                13\n\f1101-1174, in the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of\n\nNew York.   On March 20, 1990, Eastern and ALPA signed an interim\n\nletter of agreement, effective March 2, 1990, fixing Eastern's\n\ncontribution to the Plan for all pilots at 3% of compensation.18\n\nOn April 18, 1990, the bankruptcy court named Martin R. Shugrue\n\nas Bankruptcy Trustee of Eastern (the “Bankruptcy Trustee”).    The\n\nBankruptcy Trustee began liquidating certain company assets in an\n\nattempt to reorganize Eastern as a smaller carrier.19\n\n     On September 11, 1990, the Bankruptcy Trustee, proceeding\n\nunder section 1113(e) of the Bankruptcy Code, applied to the\n\nbankruptcy court for an order, which the court entered, approving\n\nan amendment to the Plan.20   Pursuant to this order, Eastern\n\nreduced its contribution to the Plan to 0% for compensation\n\nearned by pilots after August 11, 1990, and provided for\n\nresumption of its contribution of 3% for such compensation on or\n\nafter June 1, 1991.   This amendment also suspended the Pension\n\n     18\n       For Eastern pilots employed before March 2, 1986, Eastern\nhad been contributing 10% of compensation since January 1, 1988.\nSee supra note 6.\n     19\n       The record indicates that the Eastern Pension and\nInsurance Department retained its authority and continued to\nperform its responsibilities under the supervision of the\nBankruptcy Trustee.\n     20\n       Section 1113(e) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §\n1113(e), states that the bankruptcy court, “after notice and a\nhearing, may authorize the trustee to implement interim changes\nin the terms, conditions, wages, benefits, or work rules provided\nby a collective bargaining agreement.” The bankruptcy court may\nauthorize such measures only if they occur “during a period when\nthe collective bargaining agreement continues in effect,” and “if\n[such measures are] essential to the continuation of the debtor's\nbusiness, or in order to avoid irreparable damage to the estate.”\n\n\n                                 14\n\fDispute Board’s powers effective August 11, 1991.    ALPA objected\n\nto the Bankruptcy Trustee’s action and appealed to the district\n\ncourt the bankruptcy court’s order authorizing this amendment.\n\nThe record does not inform us of the district court’s disposition\n\nof this appeal.\n\n     After Eastern's Chapter 11 filing, the Fund became\n\nincreasingly illiquid due to three factors.    First, because\n\nEastern had suspended and eventually ceased making contributions\n\nto the Plan, the Fund's sole source of cash was the return on its\n\ninvestments.   Second, a substantial portion of the Fund's assets\n\nwere invested in real estate, which was depressed in value due to\n\na nationwide real estate recession.    Third, the lump-sum option\n\nfor receiving benefits had become increasingly popular with\n\nretiring pilots.   In fact, the annual amount distributed in lump-\n\nsum payments had risen steadily from $52,000,000 in 1986 to more\n\nthan $200,000,000 in 1990.\n\n     On January 18, 1991, Eastern shut down its operations,\n\neffectively retiring the approximately 2,500 pilots in its employ\n\nat the time.   The same day, O'Connor of the O'Connor law firm,\n\nwhich served as counsel to the TAC, contacted Brian P. White,\n\nDirector of Eastern's Pension and Insurance Department, and told\n\nWhite that the TAC “recommended” that Eastern place a temporary\n\nmoratorium on lump-sum payments.     White, in response, said that\n\nEastern lacked the authority to impose a moratorium.    On January\n\n19, 1991, O’Connor confirmed the recommendation by letter, a copy\nof which he sent to ALPA, the TAC, and Hawthorne.\n\n\n                                15\n\f     On January 27, 1991, according to the deposition testimony\n\nof former President Gerald R. Ford, the TAC voted unanimously to\n\nimpose the temporary moratorium.21    The record does not disclose\n\nhow the TAC planned to implement the moratorium.\n\n     On January 28, 1991, O'Connor, representatives of ALPA and\n\nEastern and their respective attorneys,22 met to discuss the need\n\nto place a temporary moratorium on lump-sum payments.    The record\n\ndoes not disclose whether at this meeting the parties discussed\n\nArticle XIII of the Plan, which gives Eastern the power to\n\n“modify, suspend . . . or discontinu[e] . . . any feature [of the\n\nPlan].”\n\n     On February 1, 1991, the TAC issued a “Certificate of Action\n\nof the [TAC of the Plan] Taken upon Unanimous Written Consent.”\n\nIn this document, the TAC stated that it, “as named fiduciary of\n\nthe [Plan], has decided to, and hereby does, impose a temporary\n\nmoratorium upon the payment of benefits to all Eastern pilots who\n\nshall file requests for benefits after the close of business on\n\nJanuary 18, 1991.”23   This Certificate also instructed O'Connor\n\nto “notify [Eastern] of the [TAC's] request that Eastern, as\n\n     21\n       In his deposition, former President Ford, a member of the\nTAC at the time the moratorium was imposed, see supra note 9,\nstated that “[the decision to impose the moratorium] was\nunanimous between Mr. Spencer, Mr. Jenkins, Mr. Fouraker, the\n[ALPA] members, and myself.”\n     22\n       The record does not indicate whether the Bankruptcy\nTrustee was present, or represented, at the meeting.\n     23\n       The moratorium did not affect participants who were\nalready receiving annuities or who had submitted their\napplication for a lump-sum benefit by the close of business on\nJanuary 18, 1991.\n\n                                 16\n\f[Plan] Administrator, promptly notify all Eastern pilots who\n\nshall file requests for benefits after the close of business on\n\nJanuary 18, 1991, that, until further notice, a temporary\n\nmoratorium has been placed in effect by [the TAC].”   Pursuant to\n\nthe TAC's request, Eastern mailed notice of the moratorium to all\n\nof its pilots on February 4, 1991.24   In this notice, Eastern\n\nadvised pilots that “[q]uestions regarding the temporary\n\nmoratorium should be addressed to the [TAC]” at one of the\n\nfollowing addresses: (1) the TAC, care of the O'Connor law firm;\n\nor (2) the TAC, care of Hawthorne.\n\n     White stated that, after Eastern's shutdown and the\n\ncommencement of the moratorium, the procedure for processing\n\nclaims for benefits under the Plan remained the same except for\n\ntwo changes: (1) the retiring pilot would contact Eastern's\n\nPension and Insurance Department directly rather than go through\n\nthe Chief Pilot; and (2) Eastern's Pension and Insurance\n\nDepartment would inform the actuary whether a participant had\n\napplied for benefits following the shutdown.   If the participant\n\nhad applied after the shutdown, the bank would not issue a\n\nbenefit check.\n\n     On May 22, 1991, the TAC mailed a letter and a videotape to\n\nall Plan participants and beneficiaries.   The letter and\n\nvideotape were designed to inform these parties about the current\n\n\n     24\n       This mailing consisted of two documents: (1) a brief\ncover letter printed on Eastern stationery; and (2) a two-page\nnotice about the moratorium signed by the TAC and addressed to\nall Eastern pilots.\n\n                                17\n\fstatus of the Plan and its plans for the future in light of the\n\n“present liquidity issues confronting the [Plan]” -- that is, the\n\nstate of the Plan after Eastern's shutdown and bankruptcy.\n\n     On June 25, 1991, the Bankruptcy Trustee and ALPA modified\n\nthe Plan by letter of agreement.25     This agreement modified the\n\nPlan in three significant ways.    First, the Plan provided for a\n\nperiodic-payment option that enabled participants to receive\n\ntheir retirement benefit in substantially equal monthly payments\n\nthat were made for life (or life expectancy).     See § 6.11\n\n(“Periodic Payments”).    These payments would be exempt from the\n\nten percent additional tax assessed on early distributions from\n\nqualified retirement plans.26    Second, a new article (Article XV)\n\nwas added in order to enable participants to take out loans from\n\nthe Plan during this time of financial uncertainty.27     The\n\n     25\n          This agreement is known as “Document 91B.”\n     26\n       Under the “periodic payment” option, a participant could\nelect to receive the actuarial present value of his accrued\nbenefit in the form of periodic monthly payments as described in\nI.R.C. § 72(t)(2)(A)(iv), 26 U.S.C. § 72(t)(2)(A)(iv); under this\noption, the benefit amount was determined as of the date of\nreceipt. Participants who were receiving an annuity or had an\noutstanding balance on a loan from the Fund were not eligible for\nthis option. If the periodic-payment arrangement was\ndiscontinued or altered within five years after it started or\nbefore the participant reached age 59.5, whichever was later, the\nparticipant's subsequent election of another form of benefit from\nthe Plan would trigger the 10% penalty tax normally associated\nwith premature distributions, unless the participant was 55 or\nolder when separating from Eastern. If the penalty tax was\ntriggered, it would be applied retroactively to those amounts\npreviously withdrawn. See § 6.11.\n     27\n       Participants who were annuitants or periodic-payment\nrecipients were not eligible to receive loans from the Plan. The\nmaximum loan that could be made was the lesser of $50,000 or 25%\nof the actuarial present value of the participant's accrued\n\n                                  18\n\famendment provided that the TAC would serve as administrator for\n\nthese two provisions; Eastern, however, retained its\n\nadministrative authority for all other provisions of the Plan.\n\nSee §§ 6.11(f), 15.1.    Third, the Plan was amended to provide\n\nthat the value of benefits distributed from the Plan was to be\n\ndetermined at the time of distribution.      Thus, the value of a\n\nparticipant's lump-sum benefit would no longer be determined as\n\nof the effective retirement date.      See § 6.2(e)(i).\n\n     On July 27, 1992, pending approval by the bankruptcy court,\n\nthe Bankruptcy Trustee and ALPA entered into a letter of\n\nagreement once again.    Referred to as Document 91C, this proposed\n\namendment would make two fundamental changes to the Plan.      First,\n\nthe Fund would be divided into a liquid portion (i.e., cash,\n\nmarketable stocks, and bonds) and an illiquid portion (i.e., real\n\nestate, alternative investments, and working capital).      Each Plan\n\nparticipant would have a percentage interest in both the liquid\n\nand illiquid portions of the Fund rather than an interest in the\n\nFund as a whole.   Second, the lump-sum option was modified to\n\nprovide for a partial distribution -- that is, an immediate cash\n\npayment equal to the liquid portion of each eligible\n\nparticipant's account.    A participant selecting this option also\n\nwould receive extended payments over time as the real estate and\n\nother illiquid assets were sold.      The modified lump-sum option\n\n\n\n\nbenefit at the time of loan.    See § 15.4 (“Plan Loans”).\n\n                                 19\n\fhad become feasible because of recent favorable changes in the\n\ntax code for partial distributions.28\n\n       On August 19, 1992, pursuant to its duties under section\n\n10.2(c), the TAC sent a letter to all Plan participants to\n\ndescribe the modified lump-sum option and to explain why the\n\nmoratorium had been imposed:\n\n       The lump sum option in the [Plan] has been modified by\n       Document 91-C to address the reality that the [Plan] has a\n       substantial amount of high quality illiquid assets that\n       cannot be liquidated quickly without suffering a substantial\n       discount in order to achieve a quick sale. The [Plan] does\n       not have sufficient cash and other liquid assets to allow\n       eligible participants to take their lump sum in cash. This\n       is what caused the imposition of the moratorium in January\n       1991.\n\n       On October 1, 1992, the Bankruptcy Trustee and ALPA filed a\n\njoint motion in the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of\n\nNew York seeking approval of the amendment provided by Document\n\n91C.    On November 13, 1992, the bankruptcy court granted their\n\nmotion and approved the amendment to the Plan, effectively ending\n\nthe moratorium.    The operative date of the Document 91C amendment\n\nwas June 30, 1992.\n\n\n\n                                 II.\n\n                                 A.\n\n\n\n\n       28\n       Effective January 1, 1993, partial distributions from a\nqualified pension plan could be rolled over into an individual\nretirement account (“IRA”) without adverse tax consequences. See\n26 U.S.C. § 402(c)(4) (1993). Before this change, a participant\ncould not roll over a partial distribution into an IRA without\nsignificant tax liability. See 26 U.S.C. § 402(a)(5)(D) (1991).\n\n\n                                 20\n\f     Harry Hunt worked as a pilot for Eastern for twenty-four\n\nyears.    He elected to retire effective March 1, 1991, and demands\n\nthat he be paid a lump-sum benefit for the value of his interest\n\nin the Plan as of that date.29   On February 22, 1991, Eastern's\n\nPension and Insurance Department received his application for\n\nbenefits, which was signed by Hunt on February 5, 1991.   On April\n\n22, 1991, the manager of Eastern's Pension Administration\n\nDepartment, Ms. S.W. Boles,30 approved Hunt's application and\n\nauthorized payment of his benefits.31   Given Eastern's\n\ninstruction to the actuary that it apply the moratorium to those\n\napplications submitted after January 18, 1991, the State Street\n\nBank and Trust never made any payment to Hunt.    Although Hunt is\n\neligible to receive a modified lump-sum benefit and future\n\npayments in accordance with the Document 91C amendment, he has\n\nrefused to elect that option.    In addition, Hunt did not select\n\nthe periodic-payment option nor did he take out a loan from the\n\nPlan.\n\n\n\n\n     29\n       The parties agree that the value of Hunt's accrued\nbenefit in the Fund as of March 1, 1991, was $352,748.74.\n     30\n       The record does not disclose the relationship between\nEastern's Pension and Insurance Department and Eastern's Pension\nAdministration Department. Given the facts before us, we assume\nthat the latter department carried out the policies and\ndirectives of the former department.\n     31\n       Hunt's application requested that his lump sum be rolled\nover into his IRA at Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc. If a lump-sum\ndistribution was rolled over into an IRA or other eligible\nretirement plan within 60 days, the lump-sum payment would not be\nincluded in gross income for the taxable year in which paid. See\nI.R.C. § 402(a)(5), 26 U.S.C. § 402(a)(5) (1991).\n\n                                 21\n\f     Dissatisfied with the progress of his application, Hunt\n\ndispatched four letters, the first by himself and the other three\n\nthrough two different attorneys.     He alleges that these letters\n\nwere sent pursuant to the instructions in Eastern's February 4,\n\n1991, letter to all Eastern pilots.    On March 15, 1991, Hunt\n\nwrote to Charles G. Dyer, the chairman of Hawthorne, to inquire\n\nabout the status of his pension.32    On March 20, 1991, through\n\nthe first of three attorneys whom Hunt employed in this\n\ncontroversy,33 he wrote to O'Connor in order to request the most\n\ncurrent statement of his account and the most recent financial\n\nstatement for the Plan “showing [its] assets and liabilities.”\n\nOn July 15, 1991, through a second attorney, he wrote another\n\nletter to Dyer of Hawthorne.   In that letter, he requested a\n\n\n\n     32\n       In this letter, Hunt expressed his extreme\ndissatisfaction with the moratorium, Hawthorne, and the TAC. He\nstated among other things: (1) “I have just been informed . . .\nthat the proposed moratorium could be extensive. THIS IS\nCOMPLETELY UNSATISFACTORY! (emphasis in original) (2)\n“[Hawthorne] is administering a Plan that is already funded and\nin place. It would appear the delays are 'stalling tactics' to\nfinancially injure [those] participants who were working on\nJanuary 18.” (3) “The proposal that the [TAC] will adopt changes\nor amend the provisions of the [Plan] after [Eastern] had ceased\nbusiness is ridiculous. The Plan was established and funded long\nbefore the demise of the Airline.” (4) “The possibility of\noffering partial payments or '[Plan] loans' is completely\nunsatisfactory to me. If I want to borrow money, I go to a bank.\nBanks lend money, and retirement funds were established to\nprovide retirement benefits to their participants. If the\nvarious members need cash then they should apply to a bank, --\nbanks lend money!”\n     33\n       The first lawyer whom Hunt employed wrote the letter of\nMarch 20, 1991. The second lawyer wrote the July 15 and August\n19, 1991, letters described in the text above. The third lawyer\nemployed by Hunt brought the instant law suit and prosecuted it\nin the district court and on this appeal; a lawyer in his firm\nassisted him with this appeal.\n\n                                22\n\fstatement of “the TAC's position on his application,” copies of\n\nall amendments to the Plan affecting his benefits, an explanation\n\nif the TAC were to deny his application, and the name, address,\n\nand the forms necessary to file a claim with the Pension Dispute\n\nBoard if the TAC decided not to pay his lump sum.   Hunt also sent\n\na copy of this letter to the then-chairman of the TAC.    Finally,\n\non August 19, 1991, the same attorney wrote on Hunt's behalf to\n\nO'Connor to request copies of the “amendments to the Plan,” an\n\nexplanation of whether the TAC “had the right to amend the\n\n[Plan],” and a statement disclosing the number of applications\n\nfor lump-sum benefits filed since January 18, 1991.34    Hunt\n\ncomplains that none of his letters were answered.\n\n\n\n                               B.\n\n     On February 21, 1992, Hunt filed a complaint in the United\n\nStates District Court for the Northern District of Florida\n\nagainst the following parties: Eastern, ALPA, Hawthorne, Charles\n\nH. Copeland as chairman of the TAC, and O’Connor as partner and\n\n\n\n     34\n       On August 23, 1991, in response to a purported “request”\nby his Congressman, Hunt sent a letter to Mr. Stephen Mayle of\nthe Office of Filings, Information, and Consumer Services of the\nUnited States Securities and Exchange Commission. He made, inter\nalia, the following statements: (1) “I believe Mr. Dyer [of\nHawthorne] and the [TAC], which is packed with [ALPA]\n[r]epresentatives, are trying to prevent these lump sum payouts\nby arbitrarily modifying the retirement agreements so as to\nprevent the retiree from moving his account to other fund\nmanagers or IRA retirement programs of their choice.” (2) “I\nrequest your expeditious assistance in investigating Mr. Dyer's\nactivities as the Fund Manager to determine if he is in violation\nof Security and Exchange Commission Rules relating to investment\nfund mangers and request your prompt reply regarding your\nfindings in this matter.”\n\n                               23\n\fagent for the O’Connor law firm.      The complaint was a typical\n\n“shotgun” pleading.35   With the exception of Count I, Hunt made\n\nonly general references to “ERISA,” failing to indicate which\n\nprovision of the statute served as his basis for relief.\n\n     The complaint contained six counts or causes of action.\n\nEach incorporated the allegations, mostly factual, set out in the\n\nfirst twenty-four paragraphs of the complaint.      In those\n\nparagraphs, Hunt made essentially the following allegations:\n\n     he was a participant in the Plan;\n\n     on February 5, 1991, he mailed to the Plan administrator’s\n     (Eastern’s) Pension and Insurance Department a “Notice of\n     Retirement Status, electing a lump sum payout of his\n     benefits under the [Plan], effective on his early retirement\n     date of March 1, 1991\";\n\n     he inquired of Hawthorne on March 15, 1991, May 3, 1991, and\n     May 7, 1991 as to when he would receive his lump-sum payment\n     for his accrued benefit;\n\n\n\n     35\n       See, e.g., Ebrahimi v. City of Huntsville Bd. of Educ.,\n114 F.3d 162, _______ (11th Cir. 1997); Anderson v. District Bd.\nof Trustees, 77 F.3d 364, 366-67 (11th Cir. 1996). As such, the\ncomplaint was not the model of clarity and precision necessary to\nenable the defendants to frame a responsive pleading. The\ndistrict court would have been within its rights had it stricken\nthe pleading on its own initiative and required a repleader.\nEbrahimi, 114 F.3d 162 at ______; Anderson, 77 F.3d at 367 n.5;\nCesnik v. Edgewood Baptist Church, 88 F.3d 902, 907 n.13 (11th\nCir. 1996), cert. denied, 117 S.Ct. 946, 136 L.Ed.2d 834 (1997).\nAs we relate infra, the court subsequently took such action when\nHunt’s attorney moved the court for leave to file an amended\ncomplaint, which amounted to nothing more than a rehash of the\noriginal complaint. The court denied his motion with leave to\nfile an amended complaint that did not suffer from “some of the\nsame infirmities contained in his original complaint.” Hunt’s\nattorney thereafter filed an amended complaint, but it\nconstituted no improvement over his original pleading.\nUnfortunately, rather than striking the amended complaint from\nthe record, the court accepted it. As a result, Hunt’s claims\nremained ambiguous and in part inconsistent, the issues were not\nproperly delineated, and the trial yielded the erroneous decision\nwe set aside today.\n\n                                 24\n\f     Hawthorne replied that he would be paid between June 15,\n     1991, and June 30, 1991;\n\n     the Plan administrator had not paid his benefit because a\n     moratorium had been placed on the payment of lump-sum\n     benefits;\n\n     the “moratorium resulted from resolutions rendered by ALPA”;\n     and\n\n     he retained counsel in order to obtain his lump-sum\n     benefit.36\n\n     Count I of the complaint, titled “Failure to Provide\n\nInformation,” alleged that the defendants’ failure “to respond\n\nwithin 30 days to repeated written requests made by Hunt since\n\nMarch 20, 1991, as required by 29 U.S.C. § 1132(c)(1)(B),”\n\nrendered the defendants “liable to Hunt in an amount up to $100\n\nper day from the date of this failure to respond pursuant to\n\n[section] 1132(c)(1)(B).”   Accordingly, Hunt requested “judgment\n\nagainst Defendants for the applicable penalty and damages, . . .\n\nsuch further relief as the court deems appropriate and . . .\n\nprejudgment interest, costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees.”\n\n     Count II, titled “Action to Enforce Rights under [Plan],”\n\nalleged that Hunt had properly submitted his request for a lump-\n\nsum benefit; that he was entitled to the benefit; and that the\n\n“Defendants have failed to pay or direct payment of said benefits\n\nand have failed to provide any disposition of Hunt’s claim.”\n\nAccordingly, Hunt asked the court to “enter an order requiring\n\n\n\n\n     36\n       Hunt also alleged that he “relied on [Hawthorne’s]\nrepresentations [that he would receive his benefits between June\n15 and 30, 1991] and on the terms of the Plan in establishing his\nbusiness and activities following his retirement [from Eastern].”\n\n                                25\n\fDefendants to pay Hunt his benefits and award to him prejudgment\n\ninterest, costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees.”\n\n     Count III, titled “Breach of Fiduciary Duty,” alleged in\n\npertinent part:\n\n     the defendants were fiduciaries under ERISA;\n\n     “ALPA has a duty not to interfere with Hunt’s interest”;\n\n     “[t]he value of Hunt’s [Plan] account continues to decrease\n     since his effective retirement date”;\n\n     the defendants “willfully and wantonly breached their\n     fiduciary duty to Hunt by failing to pay [his lump-sum\n     benefit], by failing to respond to Hunt’s requests for\n     information, by interfering with Hunt’s rights to [his\n     benefit], and by failing to discharge their duties solely in\n     the interest of the participants for the exclusive purpose\n     of providing benefits in accordance with the [Plan]\n     documents”;\n\n     the decision to impose the moratorium on lump-sum benefits\n     was “arbitrary and capricious, [was] contrary to the terms\n     of the [Plan] and [was] contrary to law”; and\n\n     “[a]s a result of Defendants’ breach of the fiduciary\n     duties, Hunt has been damaged by failing to receive his lump\n     sum payout and the resulting payment of increased interest\n     expense for loans obtained pending payment.”\n\nAccordingly, Hunt demanded “compensatory and punitive damages\n\nagainst Defendants jointly and severally and request[ed] entry of\n\nan order awarding to him prejudgment interest, costs and\n\nreasonable attorneys’ fees.”\n\n     Count IV, titled “Recovery of Benefits,” alleged that “Hunt\n\nhas been damaged by Defendants’ failure to pay Hunt the benefits\n\nto which he is entitled under the [Plan].”   Accordingly, Hunt\n\ndemanded “judgment against Defendants jointly and severally for\n\npayment of his benefits under the [Plan], plus prejudgment\n\ninterest, costs and attorneys’ fees.”\n\n\n                               26\n\f     Count V, titled “Estoppel,” alleged in pertinent part:\n\n     “Defendants represented to Hunt that he was fully vested,\n     that the [Plan] was fully funded, and that his benefits\n     would be paid before June 30, 1991\";\n\n     “Hunt relied on the terms of the [Plan] and on the\n     representation of Defendants in determining his retirement\n     date and in establishing his business plan and financial\n     affairs upon retirement”; and\n\n     “Defendants should be estopped to deny payment and to refuse\n     to process payment to Hunt.”\n\nAccordingly, Hunt demanded “judgment against Defendants jointly\n\nand severally for payment of his benefits under the [Plan], plus\n\nprejudgment interest, costs and attorneys’ fees.”\n\n     Count VI, titled “Declaratory Judgment,” alleged that the\n\ndefendants “failure to pay to Hunt the benefits to which he is\n\nentitled as set forth in the [Plan] have raised dispute regarding\n\nHunt’s entitlement (right) to immediate payment of the [Plan]\n\nbenefits under the terms of the [Plan] and ERISA” and that\n\n“Chapter 86 Fla. Stat.[] provides that such rights may be\n\ndetermined by the court.”    Accordingly, Hunt requested that “this\n\ncourt enter an order declaring his right to payment of his lump\n\nsum [Plan] benefits under the terms of the [Plan] and pursuant to\n\nERISA and awarding to Hunt costs of this proceeding, including\n\nreasonable attorneys’ fees.”\n\n     The defendants, proceeding individually, responded to Hunt’s\n\ncomplaint.    Hawthorne and the Bankruptcy Trustee, who appeared\n\nfor Eastern, filed answers that denied liability and included the\n\naffirmative defense that the complaint failed to state a claim\n\nfor relief.   The remaining defendants, with the exception of\n\nCopeland, moved to dismiss the complaint under Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n                                 27\n\f12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim for relief;37 Copeland\n\nmoved for dismissal on the ground that Hunt had not served him\n\nwith process as required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(j).38   Because Hunt\n\nhad “demonstrated neither good reason for Copeland’s continued\n\npresence in this lawsuit nor good cause for the lack of timely\n\nservice upon Copeland,” the court dismissed Copeland from the\n\ncase.39\n\n     Before the court could address the question whether the\n\ncomplaint stated a claim for relief against any of the\n\ndefendants, the Bankruptcy Trustee moved the district court on\n\nAugust 6, 1992, for summary judgment on the grounds, among\n\nothers, that Eastern was not a fiduciary under the Plan because\n\nits duties were purely ministerial; that Eastern lacked\n\ndiscretion to impose the moratorium; and that the moratorium was\n\nimposed at the TAC’s direction.    Although the Plan contained no\n\nprovision requiring Eastern to accept the TAC’s decisions as\n\nbinding, Eastern contended that it “had no choice but to abide\n\nby” the TAC’s decision to impose a moratorium on the payment of\n\n\n     37\n       ALPA filed alternative motions to dismiss and for summary\njudgment.\n     38\n       Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(j), now Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m), provided\nin pertinent part:\n\n     If a service of the summons and complaint is not made upon a\n     defendant within 120 days after the filing of the complaint\n     and the party on whose behalf such service was required\n     cannot show good cause why such service was not made within\n     that period, the action shall be dismissed as to that\n     defendant without prejudice upon the court’s own initiative\n     with notice to such party or upon motion.\n     39\n       The district court issued its order dismissing Copeland\nfrom the case on January 4, 1993.\n\n                                  28\n\flump-sum benefits.   Finally, Eastern contended that “its sole\n\nobligation in the retirement benefits process is limited to\n\ndetermining eligibility, here whether an applicant meets the age\n\ncriteria.”   “Once this is done,” Eastern argued, “[it] has no\n\nrole in deciding whether to pay an eligible participant benefits,\n\nwhat benefits an eligible participant is entitled to, or how\n\nthose benefits will be distributed” (emphasis in original).\n\n     On October 1, 1992, while this motion for summary judgment\n\nand the Rule 12(b)(6) motions to dismiss were still pending, the\n\nBankruptcy Trustee and ALPA jointly moved the bankruptcy court\n\nfor the entry of an order pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 363 approving\n\nthe Document 91C amendment to the Plan.   See supra part I.D.\n\nTheir motion advised the bankruptcy court of the following:\n\n          On July 27, 1992, Eastern and ALPA entered into a\n     letter of agreement to amend the [Plan], conditioned on the\n     approval of this Court. Under the agreement, designated as\n     ‘Document 91C’, the [Plan] would be amended to provide . . .\n     for the segregation of the assets of the [Plan] into liquid\n     and illiquid segments, and would modify the distribution of\n     lump-sum benefits under the [Plan].\n\n          Under Document 91C, Eastern would remain both the\n     'Sponsor' and the 'Administrator' of the [Plan] for purposes\n     of [ERISA]. Eastern and ALPA have been told that one or\n     more groups object to Document 91C, and may file suit\n     challenging its implementation. Because Eastern’s\n     ministerial role in the [Plan] is a continuing obligation of\n     the estate, and to provide a single forum to consider the\n     objections to Document 91C, the [Bankruptcy] Trustee and\n     ALPA hereby jointly seek an Order from this Court approving\n     Document 91C under its authority to approve contracts made\n     by the [Bankruptcy] Trustee other than in the ordinary\n     course of business. See 11 U.S.C. § 363.\n\n     On October 26, 1992, Hunt, acting through his attorney in\n\nthe instant case, filed with the bankruptcy court an “Objection\n\nto Joint Motion for Entry of Order Approving Amendment to\n\n\n                                29\n\f[Plan].”   The essence of his objection was that “[t]he movants\n\nhave failed to provide any authority which would permit amendment\n\nof the [Plan] in such a manner that would alter or adversely\n\nimpact Hunt’s ability to receive a lump sum payment upon his\n\nretirement.”   According to Hunt, section 13.1 of the Plan\n\nprecluded any amendment that would “adversely affect the\n\nretirement benefits provided to the participant at the time of\n\nthe modification.”   Alternatively, Hunt had “no objection to any\n\namendment that excepts or exempts him, or that otherwise permits\n\nhim to receive his lump sum payout.”   Finally, Hunt contended\n\nthat the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction over the\n\nadministration of the Plan because “Eastern’s involvement in the\n\n[Plan], according to its own representations, is merely\n\nministerial.   The motion seeks to elevate and escalate Eastern’s\n\ninvolvement in administering the Plan without providing plan\n\nparticipants with any means of participating in Eastern’s\n\nadministration.”\n\n     On November 13, 1992, the bankruptcy court held a hearing on\n\nthe Bankruptcy Trustee’s and ALPA’s joint motion for approval of\n\nthe Document 91C amendment to the Plan.   In addressing objections\n\nof Plan participants such as Hunt, the court stated the\n\nfollowing:\n\n          It is clear from this record that the objections are\n     not well-founded. The record does support the relief that\n     has been requested, which does give equitable treatment to\n     inherent competing interests to the [Plan]. In any\n     situation such as this there are always competing interests.\n     And it is clear from this record that the proposal is\n     equitable.\n\n\n\n                                30\n\fThe bankruptcy court granted the joint motion.    According to the\n\nBankruptcy Trustee, neither Hunt nor any other objector appealed\n\nthis ruling.\n\n     On December 4, 1992, following the bankruptcy court’s\n\napproval of the Document 91C amendment to the lump-sum benefit\n\nprovision of the Plan, Hunt moved the district court for leave to\n\nfile an amended complaint.   The Bankruptcy Trustee, ALPA, and\n\nHawthorne opposed Hunt’s motion in separate filings.40    The\n\nBankruptcy Trustee and Hawthorne argued that Hunt’s motion should\n\nbe denied on the ground that the bankruptcy court’s rejection of\n\nHunt’s objection to the approval of the Document 91C amendment\n\nbarred his claim for a lump-sum benefit.    The Bankruptcy Trustee\n\nalso represented that Hunt “had a full opportunity to address his\n\nconcerns before the bankruptcy court.    Having failed in his\n\nefforts before the bankruptcy court, he [was] barred under the\n\ndoctrine of res judicata from collaterally attacking Document 91C\n\nbefore this [District] Court.”41    ALPA objected to Hunt’s\n\nproposed amended complaint on the ground that the claims Hunt\n\nproposed to assert against it were frivolous.\n\n     On February 1, 1993, the district court disposed of three of\n\nthe pending motions.   The first two were ALPA’s alternative\n\nmotions to dismiss Hunt’s complaint for failure to state a claim\n\n\n\n     40\n       Defendants Copeland and O’Connor did not respond to\nHunt’s motion.\n     41\n       According to the Bankruptcy Trustee, the bankruptcy court\nheard and rejected Hunt’s objection to the approval of the\nDocument 91C amendment on November 13, 1992, and Hunt did not\nappeal this ruling. Hunt did not contest this representation.\n\n                                   31\n\ffor relief and for summary judgment.   The court granted both\n\nmotions.   It concluded that ALPA was not an administrator of the\n\nPlan and that Hunt's breach of fiduciary duty claim was\n\nimproperly asserted; ALPA, therefore, could not have been held\n\nliable for any of the relief Hunt sought in Counts I through IV.\n\nThe court also rejected Hunt’s Count V estoppel claim because the\n\ncomplaint failed to allege that Hunt had relied on a\n\nrepresentation made by ALPA.\n\n     The third motion disposed of was Hunt’s motion for leave to\n\nfile an amended complaint.   The court denied that motion “because\n\n. . . [the amended complaint Hunt tendered with his motion]\n\nsuffer[ed] from some of the same infirmities contained in his\n\noriginal complaint.”   The court did not specify the infirmities\n\nin Hunt’s original complaint; whatever they were, the court gave\n\nHunt twenty-two days to cure them and to “file an appropriate\n\namended complaint.”\n\n\n\n                                C.\n\n     On February 24, 1993, Hunt filed an amended complaint.\n\nWithout obtaining leave of court as required by Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n21, Hunt dropped from the case four of the defendants named in\n\nhis original complaint: Eastern, ALPA, Copeland, and O’Connor.42\n\n\n     42\n       Fed. R. Civ. P. 21, “Misjoinder and Non-Joinder of\nParties,” provides in pertinent part: “Parties may be dropped or\nadded by order of the court on motion of any party or of its own\ninitiative at any stage of the action and on such terms as are\njust.” A plaintiff who has been given leave to file an amended\ncomplaint may drop a defendant from the case without obtaining a\nRule 21 order if the defendant has not responded to the original\ncomplaint with an answer. See generally 3 Moore’s Federal\n\n                                32\n\fHe replaced them with two new defendants, the TAC and the Plan,\n\nwhich joined Hawthorne as the defendants in the case.   The\n\nBankruptcy Trustee subsequently learned that Hunt had dropped\n\nEastern from the case, and on April 30, 1993, it obtained from\n\nHunt and filed with the court a stipulation that recited:\n\n          Pursuant to Rule 41(a)(1)(ii) of the Federal Rules of\n     Civil Procedure, plaintiff . . . Hunt and defendant . . .\n     Eastern . . . hereby agree and stipulate that the above\n     captioned action shall be and hereby is dismissed with\n     prejudice as to Eastern, each party to bear its own costs.43\n\n     Hunt’s amended complaint contained seven counts.   With the\n\nminor exceptions set out in the margin, the first six counts of\n\nthe amended complaint simply replicated the allegations and\n\nprayers for relief contained in the original complaint. For\n\nexample, as before, Count I was titled “Failure to Provide\n\n\n\nPractice, §§ 15.10, 15.11 (3d ed. 1997); 4 Moore’s Federal\nPractice, § 21.02[5][b] (3d ed. 1997) (discussing the\ninterrelationship of Rules 15 and 21 of the Federal Rules of\nCivil Procedure). ALPA and O’Connor did not answer Hunt’s\noriginal complaint; ALPA filed alternative motions to dismiss and\nfor summary judgment, and O’Connor filed a motion to dismiss.\nHunt, therefore, was not required to file a Rule 21 motion and\nobtain an order dismissing those defendants from the case.\nEastern, however, answered Hunt’s original complaint;\nconsequently, Hunt could not drop Eastern from the case without\nmoving the court pursuant to Rule 21 for an order dismissing\nEastern “on such terms as are just.” Hunt was free, however, to\nobtain Eastern’s dismissal from the case by filing with the court\na stipulation under Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(1)(ii). As we observe\nabove and in part III.B, infra, Hunt eventually followed this\nroute, obtaining Eastern’s dismissal by entering into a\nstipulation providing for the dismissal of his claims against\nEastern with prejudice.\n     We note that Hunt did not move the court pursuant to Rule 21\nto add the TAC and Plan as defendants. Neither party objected to\nbeing added, and thus the matter is not an issue here.\n     43\n       The Bankruptcy Trustee's attorney and Hunt's attorney\nsigned the stipulation on April 22, 1993, and April 29, 1993,\nrespectively.\n\n                               33\n\fInformation”; Count II was titled “Action to Enforce Rights under\n\n[Plan]”; Count III was titled “Breach of Fiduciary Duty”; Count\n\nIV was titled “Recovery of Benefits”; Count V was titled\n\n“Estoppel”; and Count VI was titled “Declaratory Judgment.”44\n\n\n     44\n       The principal difference between the two complaints was\nthat instead of seeking recovery from the parties named as\ndefendants in the original complaint, the counts of the amended\ncomplaint sought relief only from the defendants named in the\namended complaint. Other than this difference, the “amended”\nCount I was an exact duplicate of the original Count I. Count II\nadded the following allegation, which was implicit in the\nallegations of the original Count II: “These defendants have\nimproperly, and without authority, interfered with Hunt’s\nattempts to receive payment through the imposition of a\nmoratorium, or modification and amendment of the [Plan].”\n     Count III, the breach of fiduciary duty claim, added the\nallegations listed below in an attempt to circumvent the\ndismissal of this claim on the ground that an individual plan\nparticipant lacks standing under ERISA to sue a plan fiduciary\nfor money damages. That Hunt lacked standing as a plan\nparticipant to bring a breach of fiduciary duty claim against the\nTAC had previously been brought to the district court’s\nattention, and the court had informed his attorney that Hunt\ncould not bring the claim for his own benefit, as opposed to the\nbenefit of all participants. As Hunt’s attorney well knew, the\nright to sue for breach of fiduciary duty belonged to all of the\nplan’s participants as a group. See Massachusetts Mut. Life.\nIns. Co. v. Russell, 473 U.S. 134, 140, 105 S.Ct. 3085, 3089, 87\nL.Ed.2d 96 (1985) (finding that recovery for breach of fiduciary\nduty under ERISA § 409, 29 U.S.C. § 1109, “inures to the benefit\nof the plan as a whole”). In an effort to shore up the original\nCount III and persuade the district court to accord him standing\nfor the breach of fiduciary claim, Hunt alleged:\n\n          The [Plan] itself is effectively precluded from\n     challenging the fiduciary duties of these defendants in that\n     these defendants are inextricably tied to the [Plan] itself\n     through their roles, activities, insured interests and\n     administration of the [Plan]. Hunt has no other recourse\n     for the actions of these fiduciaries with regard to his\n     interest in the [Plan].\n\n          Defendants have willfully and wantonly breached their\n     fiduciary duty to Hunt and to the [Plan] itself, by failing\n     to pay [Plan] benefits to Hunt, by failing to respond to\n     Hunt’s requests for information, by interfering with Hunt’s\n     rights to these monies, and by failing to discharge their\n     duties solely in the interest of the participants for the\n\n                               34\n\f     In the original complaint, twenty-four paragraphs preceded\n\nthe presentation of the counts.    The amended complaint had\n\ntwenty-five such paragraphs.   These paragraphs, compared to their\n\ncounterparts in the original complaint, differed materially in\n\nthe following way.   After alleging in the original complaint that\n\nthe Document 91C amendment affecting Hunt’s lump-sum benefit had\n\nbeen made by Eastern and ALPA, which were no longer parties in\n\nthe case, Hunt changed his position and alleged that the TAC,\n\nwhich “renders decisions regarding administration of the [Plan],”\n\nwas the party responsible for the moratorium rather than Eastern\n\n\nexclusive purpose of providing benefits in accordance with the\n[Plan] documents (emphasis added).\n\n     The new Count III also added this allegation, which followed\nthe replicated allegation that the moratorium was “arbitrary and\ncapricious, [was] contrary to the terms of the [Plan], and [was]\ncontrary to law”:\n\n          Alternatively, if the moratorium was imposed because of\n     the [Plan’s] inability to pay lump sum benefits to\n     retiring employees electing that option, then these\n     Defendants have breached their fiduciary duties to the\n     [Plan] and to Hunt through mismanagement and failure to\n     take such action to ensure that the [Plan] was\n     adequately funded so as to pay the lump sum benefit\n     option exercised by Hunt.\n\n     Finally, the new Count III added this language to its prayer\nfor compensatory and punitive damages: “[I]n the alternative,\n[Hunt] demands judgment for damages on behalf of the [Plan] in an\namount sufficient to fully fund the retirement benefits\nauthorized under the [Plan].”\n\n     The sole addition of note to new Count IV was the allegation\nthat the moratorium and the Document 91C amendment to the lump-\nsum benefit provision, which the bankruptcy court had approved,\nwere “arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable and [] contrary to the\nprovisions of the [Plan].” New Count V, the estoppel claim,\nadded the allegation that the defendants were estopped from\nenforcing against Hunt the moratorium or the Document 91C\namendment. Count VI, the declaratory judgment claim, was renewed\nverbatim.\n\n                                  35\n\for ALPA.   According to Hunt, Eastern and ALPA were “the only\n\nentities which can act to amend or modify the [Plan]”; he\n\ntherefore implied that the moratorium allegedly imposed by the\n\nTAC constituted an unauthorized amendment or modification of the\n\nPlan.\n\n     As noted, the amended complaint added a seventh count to\n\nthose asserted in the original complaint.    Count VII, titled\n\n“Injunctive Relief,” alleged essentially that the defendants had\n\nbreached their duty to maintain sufficient “reserves” with which\n\nto pay Hunt’s lump-sum benefit.    It alleged further that\n\n          [n]o other parties will be prejudiced by enjoining the\n     imposition of the moratorium, modification or amendment or\n     payments made thereunder beyond keeping sufficient reserves\n     for the payment of Hunt’s lump sum benefit; i.e., payments\n     would continue under the [Plan], but defendants would be\n     enjoined from so depleting the liquid portion of the fund\n     that Hunt’s total lump sum benefit could be paid.\n\nAccordingly, Hunt “demand[ed] that [the] Court enter an order\n\nenjoining payment of benefits under the [Plan] to current\n\nbeneficiaries, at least to the extent that sufficient funds are\n\nretained to pay Hunt’s lump sum benefit, interest, costs and\n\nattorney’s fees.”\n\n     The TAC and the Plan jointly moved the court to dismiss the\n\ncounts of the amended complaint on the ground that none stated a\n\nclaim for relief.45   In part, they repeated the arguments\n\npreviously addressed to the sufficiency of Hunt’s original\n\ncomplaint and advanced in the Bankruptcy Trustee’s and ALPA’s\n\nobjections to Hunt’s motion for leave to file an amended\n\n\n     45\n       The TAC and the Plan were represented by the same counsel\nthroughout this case.\n\n                                  36\n\fcomplaint.   These arguments included the claim that Hunt lacked\n\nstanding to sue for breach of fiduciary duty and that the\n\nmoratorium and the bankruptcy court's approval of the Document\n\n91C amendment foreclosed his claim.   As for Hunt’s claim seeking\n\nthe $100 per day statutory penalty, these defendants contended\n\nthat such penalties were assessable only against the\n\nadministrator of the Plan, Eastern, which had been dismissed from\n\nthe case with prejudice.   Hawthorne answered the complaint with a\n\ngeneral denial of liability.\n\n     The district court disposed of the joint motion to dismiss\n\nthe amended complaint in the following manner: the court (1)\n\ndenied the motion to dismiss Count I; (2) denied the motion to\n\ndismiss Count II; (3) dismissed Count III to the extent that it\n\nsought comprehensive and punitive damages for Hunt, but held that\n\nhe had standing to sue the TAC for breach of fiduciary duty on\n\nbehalf of the Plan’s participants; (4) denied the motion to\n\ndismiss Count IV; (5) dismissed Count V after Hunt conceded that\n\nhe had no case for estoppel; (6) dismissed Count VI on the ground\n\nof ERISA preemption; and (7) denied the motion to dismiss Count\n\nVII, although the court was unable to discern -- from what it\n\ndescribed as an “inartfully” drafted pleading -- whether Hunt\n\nstated a claim for relief.\n\n     Following these rulings, the TAC and the Plan answered the\n\namended complaint, denying liability, and then jointly moved for\n\nsummary judgment.   Their motion essentially restated the\n\narguments presented in their motion to dismiss.   Hawthorne also\n\nmoved for summary judgment.    It contended, among other things,\n\n                                 37\n\fthat Hunt’s claim for the lump-sum benefit (Counts II and IV)\n\ncould be brought only against the Plan and a person or entity,\n\nsuch as the Plan administrator, possessing the authority to order\n\nthe payment of his benefit.   Hawthorne argued that it had no such\n\nauthority and, thus, could not provide the relief sought.       In\n\naddition, Hawthorne contended that it could not be held liable\n\nfor breach of fiduciary duty (Count III) because the Plan, the\n\nappropriate plaintiff for such a cause of action, was not injured\n\nby the failure to pay Hunt his lump-sum benefit.\n\n     The court deferred ruling on these motions for summary\n\njudgment until the morning that the trial of the case began.         In\n\nthe meantime, Hawthorne settled with Hunt and agreed to the entry\n\nof judgment in favor of Hunt on Count I in the sum of $10,000;\n\nall other counts against Hawthorne were to be dismissed with\n\nprejudice.   The court denied the only motion that was pending,\n\nthe TAC’s and the Plan’s motion for summary judgment, and the\n\ntrial commenced.\n\n\n\n                                D.\n\n     The case was tried to the court.    Five counts from the\n\namended complaint were at issue:     Hunt’s claim for the $100 per\n\nday statutory penalty under Count I; his identical claims under\n\nCounts II and IV seeking judgment in the amount of the lump-sum\n\nbenefit, prejudgment interest, costs, and attorneys’ fees; his\n\nclaim on behalf of the Plan participants for breach of fiduciary\n\nduty under Count III; and his request that the TAC and the Plan\n\n\n\n                                38\n\fbe enjoined from paying benefits to other participants until they\n\nsatisfied his claim under Count VII.\n\n     After considering the evidence adduced by the parties, the\n\ncourt, in an “Order Directing Entry of Judgment,” held as\n\nfollows:\n\n     Count I.   The court found that only designated plan\n\nadministrators are subject to the $100 penalty imposed by ERISA\n\n§ 502(c), 29 U.S.C. § 1132(c), for failing to respond to a plan-\n\nparticipant's requests for information as required by the\n\nstatute.   Because Hunt had neither established that the TAC was\n\nthe Plan administrator nor that it had assumed the “information-\n\nproviding function” of the administrator, the TAC could not be\n\nheld liable under section 502(c).\n\n     Counts II and IV.    The court first found that Hunt had\n\nproperly applied for the lump-sum benefit and that his\n\napplication had been denied because of the moratorium the TAC had\n\n“imposed” unilaterally.   The TAC had done so because it concluded\n\nthat a “moratorium was needed to maintain the financial integrity\n\nof the [Plan] and to protect the economic interests of all plan\n\nparticipants and beneficiaries.”      The court then turned to the\n\nquestion whether the TAC had the authority to impose the\n\nmoratorium for such purpose.   Although the Plan did not expressly\n\ngive the TAC such authority, the court assumed that the common\n\nlaw of trusts did so.    Having made that determination, the court\n\naddressed the question whether Hunt or the TAC had the burden of\n\nproof regarding the need for the moratorium: it concluded that\n\nthe TAC had the burden.\n\n                                 39\n\f     With this ruling in hand, the court considered whether the\n\nTAC’s proof established that “its action was both prudent and\n\nnecessary to protect the interests of all plan participants and\n\ntheir beneficiaries.”   The court held that although the\n\nmoratorium may have been justified, the TAC’s proof was\n\ninsufficient to carry the day.   The court therefore gave Hunt\n\njudgment on Counts II and IV in the sum of $352,748.74 plus\n\ncosts.\n\n     Count III.   The court’s findings on this claim are\n\nambiguous.   Hunt had alleged that “if the moratorium was imposed\n\n[by the TAC] because of the [Plan’s] inability to pay lump sum\n\nbenefits to retiring employees electing that option, then these\n\nDefendants have breached their fiduciary duties to the [Plan] and\n\nto Hunt through mismanagement and failure to take such action to\n\nensure that the [Plan] was adequately funded so as to pay the\n\nlump sum benefit option exercised by Hunt.”   See supra note 44.\n\nIn other words, the TAC breached its fiduciary duty to the Plan’s\n\nparticipants, and therefore to Hunt, by imposing the moratorium\n\nbecause of its inability to pay the lump-sum benefits.\n\n     The court found no such breach:   “Hunt submitted neither\n\nevidence of mismanagement nor -- assuming, for the sake of\n\nargument, that he proved a breach of fiduciary duty -- evidence\n\nfrom which this court could fashion a remedy.   Hunt having thus\n\nfailed to satisfy his burden of proof on Count III, judgment will\n\nbe entered in favor of the defendants.”\n\n     Therefore, under the district court's analysis, whether the\n\nTAC had breached its fiduciary duty to the Plan participants,\n\n                                 40\n\fincluding Hunt, by imposing the moratorium turned on which party\n\nhad the burden of proof.     On Counts II and IV, the court held\n\nthat the TAC had the burden but failed to sustain it by showing\n\nthat prudence required that a moratorium be imposed.      On Count\n\nIII, the court held that Hunt had the burden of proof but failed\n\nto show that the TAC had acted imprudently in imposing the\n\nmoratorium.46\n\n     The district court’s “Order Directing Entry of Judgment”\n\nmakes no mention of the remaining count (Count VII).      After\n\ndisposing of the other counts in the amended complaint by number,\n\nincluding Counts V and VI which were dismissed from the case\n\nprior to trial, the court instructed the clerk of court in\n\nparagraph four of its order (“paragraph 4\") how judgment should\n\nbe entered:     “4. On the remaining counts [i.e., Counts II, IV,\n\nand VII], the clerk shall enter judgment in favor of Harry L.\n\nHunt in the amount of $352,748.74 plus costs.      The judgment shall\n\nbe paid from the [Plan] [F]und.”       We read this language, and the\n\nfinal judgment entered by the clerk, as disposing of Count VII in\n\n\n\n\n     46\n       How the court could assume, “for sake of argument, that\n[Hunt] proved a breach of fiduciary duty” and then deny him\nrelief on Count III is a question that the court’s dispositive\norder does not answer.\n\n                                  41\n\ffavor of Hunt,47 although the court did not grant the injunctive\n\nrelief the count requested.48\n\n     Following the entry of final judgment, the TAC and the Plan\n\nappealed the district court’s judgment on Counts II and IV.   Hunt\n\ncross-appealed the court’s judgment on Count I but not Count III.\n\nFor the reasons that follow, we reverse the court’s judgment on\n\nCounts II and IV, and affirm as to Count I.\n\n\n\n                                III.\n\n     Paragraph 4 of the district court’s “Order Directing Entry\n\nof Judgment,” which gave Hunt judgment on Counts II, IV, and VII\n\nfor the lump-sum benefit, presents several threshold issues that\n\nmust be resolved before we can consider the merits of his claim\n\n\n     47\n       By treating the district court’s final judgment as having\nterminated Count VII of Hunt’s amended complaint, we have a final\njudgment before us that is appealable under 28 U.S.C. § 1291\nbecause the judgment has adjudicated all claims against all\nparties. See, e.g., Penton v. Pompano Constr. Co., 963 F.2d 321,\n321-22 (11th Cir. 1992). Hunt’s amendment of his complaint,\nwhich deleted ALPA and O’Connor from the action, operated to\ndismiss those parties from the suit. See supra note 42. The\namendment, however, did not operate to dismiss Eastern from the\ncase. Id. Rather, Eastern was dismissed from the case, with\nprejudice, when Hunt and Eastern executed a stipulation of\ndismissal and filed it with the court. See Oswalt v. Scripto,\nInc., 616 F.2d 191, 194-95 (5th Cir. 1980). In Bonner v. City of\nPrichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc), this\ncircuit adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former\nFifth Circuit handed down prior to October 1, 1981.\n     48\n       The district court, despite deciding sub silentio Count\nVII in Hunt’s favor, granted him no relief on this count. In\ntheir briefs, the parties have ignored Count VII altogether; like\nthe district court, they made no mention of it. Because of our\ndisposition of Hunt’s explicit claim for benefits contained in\nCounts II and IV, Count VII falls by the wayside. That is to\nsay, we vacate the court’s judgment on Count VII and direct the\ncourt to enter judgment in favor of the TAC and the Plan on that\ncount.\n\n                                42\n\fto that benefit.   As stated previously, in paragraph 4, the court\n\ndirected the clerk to “enter judgment in favor of [Hunt] in the\n\namount of $352,748.74 plus costs.    The judgment shall be paid\n\nfrom the [Plan] [F]und.”49\n\n     The first threshold question is whether the relief granted\n\nin paragraph 4 is legal or equitable;50 that is, does the relief\n\ngranted constitute a money judgment or an in personam order\n\ndirecting the TAC or the Plan to pay Hunt a sum of money from the\n\nassets of the Plan’s Fund.   The answer to this question is\n\nimportant because, as we explain below, the relief provided in an\n\naction to recover benefits under ERISA is equitable, not legal.\n\nMore specifically, the relief consists of an order directing a\n\nperson or entity having the necessary authority under the benefit\n\nplan to pay the participant the benefit that he seeks.    Hunt\n\nsought such equitable relief in Count II of his amended\n\ncomplaint, asking the district court to enter “an order requiring\n\nDefendants to pay Hunt his benefits.”   In Count IV, Hunt sought\n\nlegal relief, demanding “judgment against Defendants . . .\n\njointly and severally for payment of his benefits.”   In Count\n\nVII, titled “Injunctive Relief,” Hunt asked the court to “enter\n\nan order enjoining payment of benefits . . . to current\n\nbeneficiaries, at least to the extent that sufficient funds are\n\nretained to pay Hunt’s lump sum benefit.”\n\n\n     49\n       We note that the final judgment entered by the clerk\nquoted this language verbatim.\n     50\n       If the relief granted in paragraph 4 is equitable, we\nhave jurisdiction to review the grant under 28 U.S.C.\n§ 1292(a)(1). See supra note 47.\n\n                                43\n\f     Nothing in the language of paragraph 4 orders the TAC to do\n\nanything.    If, however, we construe -- that is, effectively\n\nrewrite -- paragraph 4 so that it orders the TAC to pay the\n\nbenefit from the Fund,51 then we must decide whether the TAC has\n\nthe authority under the Plan to effect payment; if not, the TAC\n\ncannot provide the relief sought.     Despite its representations to\n\nthe contrary, Eastern, the Plan administrator, obviously could\n\neffect payment if ordered to do so, see supra part I.C and infra\n\npart III.B, but Hunt voluntarily dismissed it from the case with\n\nprejudice.    Nor can the Plan as an entity provide any relief; the\n\nPlan alone is simply a written instrument executed by Eastern and\n\nALPA.\n\n     We turn now to these issues, taking them up in order.\n\n\n\n                                 A.\n\n     Section 502(a)(1)(B) of ERISA provides that “[a] civil\n\naction may be brought by a participant or beneficiary . . . to\n\nrecover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan, to\n\nenforce his rights under the terms of the plan, or to clarify his\n\nrights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.\"    29\n\nU.S.C. § 1132(a)(1)(B).    On its face, this language does not\n\n\n\n     51\n       In his original complaint, of course, Hunt took the\nposition that Eastern, as Plan administrator, was the party\nhaving the authority to effect payment of the benefit he is\nseeking; this was his reason for naming Eastern as a party\ndefendant in his claims to recover his lump-sum benefit. Since\neliminating Eastern from his amended complaint as a party\ndefendant, Hunt has taken the position that the TAC, not Eastern,\nis the entity having the authority to effect payment of the\nbenefit.\n\n                                 44\n\findicate whether a participant seeking to recover retirement\n\nbenefits may obtain legal or equitable relief.   Although the\n\n“causes of action authorized by section 502(a)(1)(B) [of ERISA]\n\nare not explicitly denominated as equitable,” see Pane v. RCA\n\nCorp., 868 F.2d 631, 636 (3d Cir. 1989),52 this circuit has\n\ntreated actions to recover benefits under section 502(a)(1)(B) as\n\nequitable in nature.   See, e.g., Shannon v. Jack Eckerd Corp.,\n\n113 F.3d 208, 209-10 (11th Cir. 1997) (denying appeal of district\n\ncourt's judgment ordering plan administrator to pay benefits to\n\nplan participant); Godfrey v. BellSouth Telecomm., Inc., 89 F.3d\n\n755, 756-57 (11th Cir. 1996) (affirming district court's issuance\n\nof “an injunction ordering [Plan administrator] to comply with\n\nERISA and pay [participant] . . . benefits”).    This position is\n\nconsistent with our view that participants suing under section\n\n502(a)(1)(B) are not entitled to a jury trial.   In Blake v.\n\nUnionmut. Stock Life Ins. Co. of Amer., we reasoned:\n\n     The nature of an action under section 502(a)(1)(B) is for\n     the enforcement of the ERISA plan. Although the plaintiffs\n     assert that they are claiming money damages, in effect they\n     are claiming the benefits they are allegedly entitled to\n     under the plan. Although . . . a money judgment would\n     satisfy their demands, . . . only an order for continuing\n     benefits would be sufficient. This is traditionally\n     equitable relief . . . .\n\n\n\n\n     52\n       In Pane, the Third Circuit aptly captured the distinction\nbetween legal and equitable relief in the context of an action\nbrought under section 502(a)(1)(B) of ERISA: “A legal remedy\nwould result in a money judgment enforceable only by execution,\nor other conventional common law process such as ejectment or\nreplevin. An equitable remedy would result in a judgment\nenforceable in personam and by contempt.” 868 F.2d at 635-36.\n\n                                45\n\f906 F.2d 1525, 1526 (11th Cir. 1990).   This view accords with the\n\nmajority of circuits that have considered this issue.53   We\n\ntherefore hold that Hunt's claim for legal relief (i.e., a money\n\njudgment) under section 502(a)(1)(B) fails to state a claim.\n\nAccordingly, we dismiss Count IV of Hunt's amended complaint,\n\nleaving only his claim for equitable relief in Count II to\n\nrecover his lump-sum benefit.\n\n     Given the equitable nature of Hunt's recovery-of-benefits\n\nclaim under ERISA, we also find that an in personam order\n\nenjoining the payment of benefits under section 502(a)(1)(B) must\n\nbe directed to a person or entity other than the plan itself.\n\nWhile ERISA § 502(d)(1), 29 U.S.C. § 1132(d)(1), does state that\n\n“[a]n employee benefit plan may sue or be sued . . . as an\n\nentity,” nothing in ERISA permits the district court to issue an\n\n\n     53\n       See Wardle v. Central States, Southeast & Southwest Areas\nPension Fund, 627 F.2d 820, 829 (7th Cir. 1980) (“We conclude\nthat Congress' silence on the jury right issue reflects an\nintention that suits for pension benefits by disappointed\napplicants are equitable.”), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1112, 101\nS.Ct. 922, 66 L.Ed.2d 841 (1981); see also Sullivan v. LTV\nAerospace and Defense Co., 82 F.3d 1251, 1258-59 (2d Cir. 1996);\nBerry v. Ciba-Geigy Corp., 761 F.2d 1003, 1007 (4th Cir. 1985);\nTurner v. CF&I Steel Corp., 770 F.2d 43, 47 (3d Cir. 1985), cert.\ndenied, 474 U.S. 1058, 106 S.Ct. 800, 88 L.Ed.2d 776 (1986); In\nre Vorpahl, 695 F.2d 318, 321-22 (8th Cir. 1982); Calamia v.\nSpivey, 632 F.2d 1235, 1237 (5th Cir. Unit A 1980). Some\ndistrict courts have suggested that Firestone Tire & Rubber v.\nBruch, 489 U.S. 101, 109 S.Ct. 948, 103 L.Ed.2d 80 (1989), calls\nthese holdings into doubt. See, e.g., Hulcher v. United\nBehavioral Sys., 919 F.Supp. 879, 885 (E.D. Va. 1995) (holding\nthat “action to recover [ERISA] benefits under the subject plan\nare legal in nature” and that “[p]laintiff is constitutionally\nentitled to trial by jury on any claim raised under §\n1132(a)(1)(B)”); Vaughn v. Owen Steel Co., 871 F.Supp. 247, 250-\n51 (D.S.C. 1994) (finding that section 502 claim under ERISA is\nanalogous to state law contract claim and must be tried before\njury). None of the courts of appeals mentioned above, however,\nhave endorsed the reasoning of these district courts.\n\n                                46\n\finjunctive order solely against the plan.54    Rather, the case law\n\nof this circuit demonstrates that an order enjoining the payment\n\nof benefits from an ERISA plan must issue against a party capable\n\nof providing the relief requested.     See, e.g., Shannon, 113 F.3d\n\nat 209-10; Godfrey, 89 F.3d at 756-57; cf. Fisher v. Metro. Life\n\nIns. Co., 895 F.2d 1073, 1074 (5th Cir. 1990) (affirming district\n\ncourt's dismissal of plaintiff's second amended complaint in part\n\nfor failure to name the plan administrator as an “indispensable\n\nparty”).     We therefore reject the notion that an injunctive order\n\nto pay benefits under section 502(a)(1)(B) of ERISA can issue\n\nsolely against an ERISA plan as an entity.\n\n\n\n                                  B.\n\n     We next examine the district court's ruling in paragraph 4\n\nthat “the clerk shall enter judgment in favor of Harry L. Hunt\n\n[on Counts II, IV, and VII]” and that “[t]he judgment shall be\n\npaid from the [Plan] fund.”    Because an injunctive order cannot\n\nissue against the Plan itself, we assume that we have discretion\n\nto construe -- i.e., effectively rewrite -- paragraph 4 so that\n\nit directs the TAC to pay Hunt the lump-sum benefit from the\n\nFund.\n\n\n\n\n        54\n       ERISA § 502(d)(2) states that “[a]ny money judgment . . .\nagainst an employee benefit plan shall be enforceable only\nagainst the plan as an entity and shall not be enforceable\nagainst any other person unless liability against such person is\nestablished in his individual capacity.” 29 U.S.C. § 1132(d)(2).\nThis provision contemplates legal relief and does not apply to an\naction to recover benefits under section 502(a)(1)(B).\n\n                                  47\n\f     Our review of the record and the Plan,55 however, makes\n\nclear that the TAC has no authority under the Plan to issue or\n\ndeny payment of a lump-sum benefit to a participant.    Rather, the\n\nTAC has limited powers under the Plan56 and plays no role in the\n\nprocess of reviewing applications for retirement benefits.\n\nUnlike Eastern, the TAC's authority is primarily limited to the\n\nmanagement and supervision of the Fund's assets.   Its \"overall\n\nsupervisory responsibility” is restricted to the “administrative\n\nfunctions of the Fund,” see § 2.13(b)(i) (“Fund Administration”),\n\nand its duty to the Plan is limited “to maintain[ing]\n\nsurveillance over the status and administration of the Plan and\n\nthe [Fund],\" see § 10.2(b) (“Rights and Duties of the [TAC]”).\n\n     In addition, as discussed in part I.B, supra, the TAC must\n\nexercise its limited powers in a manner consistent with its\n\nobligations to ALPA.   For example, before selecting and replacing\n\ninvestment advisors and trustees, the TAC must notify ALPA of its\n\nplanned course of action and give ALPA an opportunity to respond.\n\nSee § 2.7(b) (“Trust Agreement and Trustee”).   Similarly, before\n\ngiving any notice or instruction to a trustee of the Fund, the\n\nTAC must serve a copy of the trust direction on ALPA and give it\n\nfifteen days to object to the TAC's proposed direction.   See §\n\n\n     55\n       Unless otherwise specified, the term “Plan” in part III\nrefers to the written instrument in effect at the time Hunt's\napplication was “approved” on April 22, 1991 (i.e., Documents 91\nand 91A).\n     56\n       We review the relevant provisions of the Plan here\nbecause a named fiduciary must discharge its duties “in\naccordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan\ninsofar as such documents and instruments are consistent with\n[ERISA].” ERISA § 404(a)(1)(D), 29 U.S.C. § 1104(a)(1)(D).\n\n                                48\n\f2.8 (“Directions to Trustee(s)).     In addition, the TAC must\n\n“regularly and periodically suppl[y]” information to ALPA about\n\ntransactional detail, cash flow reports, investment status,\n\ndocumentation and Fund performance,” see § 2.11 (“Information and\n\nAccountability”), and furnish to ALPA and Plan participants\n\nreports about the TAC's “functions, actions, and decisions . . .\n\nas are reasonable and appropriate,” see § 10.2(c).\n\n     In stark contrast, the plain language of the Plan gives\n\nEastern broad discretion as administrator to make decisions for\n\nthe Plan.   The Supreme Court has stated that a plan administrator\n\nhas a “statutory responsibility [under ERISA] . . . to run the\n\nplan in accordance with the currently operative, governing plan\n\ndocuments.”   Curtiss-Wright Corp. v. Schoonejongen, 514 U.S. 73,\n\n115 S.Ct. 1223, 1230, 131 L.Ed.2d 94 (1995).    Section 2.2(a) of\n\nthe Plan confers upon Eastern “those powers necessary to carry\n\nout the day to day operation of the Plan.”    Its responsibilities\n\ninclude the authority to “initially determine all questions\n\narising from the administration, interpretation, and application\n\nof the Plan pursuant to all applicable law, agreements and\n\ncontracts, and such determination shall be binding upon all\n\npersons, except as otherwise provided by law, and further\n\nprovided that each Participant shall be granted the same\n\ntreatment under similar conditions.”    Id.   The Plan also charges\n\nEastern with the responsibility for, inter alia, keeping records,\n\nsee § 2.4 (“Records”), preparing and distributing periodic Plan\n\nsummaries, see § 2.5 (“Plan Summary”), and sending to each\n\n\n\n                                49\n\fparticipant an annual statement reflecting the value of his\n\ninvestment in the Plan, see § 2.6 (“Annual Statement”).\n\n     More important, based on the record before us,57 we find\n\nthat Eastern exercises ultimate authority in determining whether\n\na participant should receive payment of his benefit.    The record\n\nreveals that Eastern plays the central role in the process of\n\nreviewing applications for benefits.    The Plan makes Eastern\n\nresponsible for providing the benefit-application forms to\n\nparticipants.   See § 12.9(a) (“Application for Benefits”).58     A\n\npilot seeking a lump-sum payment must complete the necessary\n\npaperwork and inform an Eastern management employee, the Chief\n\nPilot, of his intention to retire.    The Chief Pilot checks the\n\npilot's eligibility under the Plan, and then informs the Eastern\n\nPension and Insurance Department about the pilot's decision to\n\nretire.59   The application is then presented to the Eastern\n\nPension Administration Department, which must provide an\n\nauthorizing signature beneath a line that states:    “The above\n\n\n     57\n       As stated in part I.C and note 12, supra, the Plan does\nnot set forth the procedure for processing claims for retirement\nbenefits. This account of the claims-processing procedure is\ntaken from the affidavit and deposition of Charles Dyer of\nHawthorne and the affidavit of Brian White, who served as\nDirector of the Eastern Pension and Insurance Department. Both\naccounts of Eastern's claims-processing procedure are virtually\nidentical.\n     58\n       Section 12.9 also states that each participant “shall\n. . . furnish the Administrator with such documents, evidence,\ndata, or information in support of such application as the\nAdministrator shall consider necessary or desirable.”\n     59\n       As stated in part I.D, supra, after the moratorium began,\nthe retiring participant would contact Eastern's Pension and\nInsurance Department directly rather than go through the Chief\nPilot.\n\n                                 50\n\finformation is approved and the appropriate allocation from the\n\nPlan to provide the benefit payable is hereby authorized.”    If\n\nthe application is approved, the Eastern Pension and Insurance\n\nDepartment contacts the Plan's actuary, which determines the\n\nprecise amount of benefits to which the retiring participant is\n\nentitled.   The actuary then gives that information to the State\n\nStreet Bank & Trust, which makes the distribution to the\n\nparticipant.   Eastern is responsible for establishing and\n\nmaintaining a procedure for giving the participant written\n\nnotification if the application is denied.    See § 2.3\n\n(“Notification of Denial of Benefits”).    If there is a legal\n\ndispute as to the proper recipient of a benefit, Eastern may\n\nwithhold payment pending final determination of the proper\n\nbeneficiary.   See § 12.10 (“Beneficiary Dispute”).\n\n     The facts of this case support our reading that Eastern, not\n\nthe TAC, has the authority to order payment of retirement\n\nbenefits.   First, the record makes clear that Eastern retained\n\nits authority as administrator at all times during the events\n\ngiving rise to this litigation.    When Hunt's application was\n\n“approved” by Eastern's Pension Administration Department on\n\nApril 22, 1991, Eastern was listed in the written instrument as\n\nthe Plan administrator.60   When the Plan was amended effective\n\nJune 25, 1991, Eastern continued to serve as administrator for\n\nall aspects of the Plan, with the exception of the newly\n\nintroduced periodic-payment option and the provision for Plan\n\n\n     60\n       At this time, the Plan consisted of Document 91 and\nDocument 91A.\n\n                                  51\n\floans.    See § 6.11(f) (“Periodic Payments”), Article XV (“Plan\n\nLoans”).61    Even after the Plan was amended effective June 30,\n\n1992, with the bankruptcy court’s approval of Document 91C,\n\nEastern retained its authority as Plan administrator.\n\n     Second, the record demonstrates that Eastern, despite its\n\nrepresentations to the contrary, made the decision to honor the\n\nmoratorium and ultimately prevented the State Street Bank and\n\nTrust from issuing a lump-sum payment to Hunt.    As noted in part\n\nI.D, supra, the director of Eastern's Pension and Insurance\n\nDepartment stated that the process for reviewing benefit claims\n\nafter the shutdown “basically remained the same, except that\n\n. . . Eastern would inform Mercer [the Plan actuary] whether a\n\nparticipant had applied for benefits following shutdown, thus\n\nimplicating the lump-sum moratorium.”    By this statement, Eastern\n\neffectively admits that it ratified the imposition of the\n\nmoratorium and thus denied Hunt's application.    In essence,\n\nEastern's order to the actuary to halt the processing of Hunt's\n\napplication foreclosed the State Street Bank and Trust from\n\nissuing him a benefit check.\n\n     Furthermore, there is nothing in the record to indicate that\n\nEastern challenged the legality of the moratorium after its\n\nimposition.    Eastern's inaction is especially glaring when one\n\nconsiders that Article XIII of the Plan, titled “Modification,\n\nSuspension or Discontinuance,” vests Eastern with the exclusive\n\n\n\n\n     61\n       This version of the Plan included the amendment referred\nto as Document 91B.\n\n                                  52\n\fauthority to modify, suspend or discontinue a feature of the\n\nPlan:\n\n     Eastern expects to continue the Plan indefinitely, but\n     necessarily reserves the right to modify, suspend or\n     terminate it at any time including, but without limiting the\n     generality of the foregoing, discontinuance of the\n     contributions of Eastern under the Plan or modification,\n     suspension, or discontinuance in its entirety or with\n     respect to any feature thereof. However, any modification,\n     suspension, or discontinuance shall not adversely affect the\n     retirement, death or termination benefits already provided\n     at that time under the Plan for any Participant, contingent\n     annuitant, or beneficiary as of the date of such\n     modification, suspension, or discontinuance. In the event\n     the Plan shall be discontinued, such action shall be taken\n     as shall insure to the extent possible the satisfaction of\n     all liabilities to Participants, contingent annuitants, and\n     beneficiaries that have accrued under the Plan.\n\n§ 13.1 (“General”) (emphasis added).   Although this provision\n\nenumerates only one specific application of this subsection\n\n(i.e., the discontinuation of Eastern's contributions), the\n\nphrases “including, but without limiting the generality of the\n\nforegoing” and “with respect to any feature thereof” would\n\nencompass other scenarios, such as the suspension of the lump-sum\n\npayment option.   Thus, if Eastern wanted to challenge the TAC's\n\npurportedly “unilateral” imposition of the moratorium, the Plan\n\ncertainly gave Eastern the authority to do so.62\n\n\n     62\n       Hunt suggests that the moratorium on lump-sum payments\nwas impermissible because it was inconsistent with § 13.1's\nprovision that “any modification, suspension, or discontinuance\nshall not adversely affect the retirement, death or termination\nbenefits already provided at that time under the Plan for any\nParticipant.” We note, however, that the moratorium on lump-sum\npayments had no effect on Hunt's actual interest in the Plan --\ni.e., the total number of annuity units in his accrued benefit;\nrather, the moratorium only changed the manner in which Hunt and\nother similarly situated participants could receive their\nbenefits.\n     Given the Plan's status as a defined contribution plan, the\nvalue of a participant's interest in the Plan fluctuates with the\n\n                                53\n\f     It is clear that Eastern, not the TAC, bears ultimate\n\nresponsibility for the denial of Hunt's lump-sum benefit.    Hunt,\n\nhowever, in an obvious attempt to avoid the effect of the\n\nbankruptcy court’s approval of the Document 91C amendment,\n\nvoluntarily dismissed Eastern with prejudice as a party to this\n\naction pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(1)(ii) shortly after\n\nfiling his amended complaint.63\n\n     Nevertheless, the district court ruled in paragraph 4 of its\n\norder that the TAC possessed the authority to issue payment from\n\nthe Fund.   In so ruling, the district court implicitly rewrote\n\nthe Plan to give the TAC that power.   Although we recognize that\n\nthe “principal object of [ERISA] is to protect plan participants\n\nand beneficiaries,” Boggs v. Boggs, 117 S.Ct. 1754, ______\n\n(1997), 65 U.S.L.W. 4418 (1997), we agree with the First\n\n\n\nperformance of the Fund's assets. See supra part I.B. After\nall, the full name of the Plan is the “Variable Benefit\nRetirement Plan for Pilots”: a participant's interest in the Plan\ndepends not only on the contributions made but also on how the\nFund's assets perform.\n     63\n       Eastern’s dismissal from the case with prejudice operated\nas an adjudication on the merits in favor of Eastern on all\nclaims Hunt had brought against the company. Citibank, N.A. v.\nData Lease Fin. Corp., 904 F.2d 1498, 1501-02 (11th Cir. 1990)\n(“[A] stipulation of dismissal with prejudice . . . at any stage\nof a judicial proceeding, normally constitutes a final judgment\non the merits which bars a later suit on the same cause of\naction.”) (citation omitted). This adjudication by dismissal\nwould include, of course, Hunt’s claims (1) that Eastern, as the\nadministrator and as a fiduciary under the Plan, breached its\nobligation to Hunt and other Plan participants by declaring, or\nratifying the TAC’s declaration of, the moratorium, and (2) that\nEastern wrongfully refused to pay Hunt the lump-sum benefit he\nseeks. In this appeal, the TAC and the Plan have not argued that\nthis disposition of Hunt’s claims against Eastern had a\npreclusive effect on Hunt’s claims against them. Accordingly, we\ndo not consider the issue.\n\n                                  54\n\fCircuit's admonition that “courts have no right to torture\n\nlanguage in an attempt to force particular results . . . . To the\n\nexact contrary, straightforward language in an ERISA-regulated\n\ninsurance policy should be given its natural meaning.”     Burnham\n\nv. Guardian Life Ins. Co., 873 F.2d 486, 489 (1st Cir. 1989)\n\n(citation omitted).   See also Hamilton v. Air Jamaica, Ltd., 945\n\nF.2d 74, 78 (3d Cir. 1991) (“While ERISA was enacted to provide\n\nsecurity in employee benefits, it protects only those benefits\n\nprovided in the plan. . . .   ERISA mandates no minimum\n\nsubstantive content for employee welfare benefit plans, and\n\ntherefore a court has no authority to draft the substantive\n\ncontent of such plans.”) (citation and quotation marks omitted),\n\ncert. denied, 503 U.S. 938, 112 S.Ct. 1479, 117 L.Ed.2d 622\n\n(1992); cf. Nachwalter v. Christie, 805 F.2d 956, 960 (11th Cir.\n\n1986) (written employee benefit plans governed by ERISA may not\n\nbe modified by oral agreements).     We therefore reject the\n\ndistrict court's sub silentio revision of the Plan which enabled\n\nthe court to direct the TAC to pay Hunt his lump-sum benefit.\n\n\n\n                                C.\n\n     Given the district court's view that the TAC denied Hunt's\n\nlump-sum benefit by issuing the moratorium, however, we will\n\nassume arguendo that the TAC could order the State Street Bank\n\nand Trust to issue Hunt payment from the Fund.    For the district\n\ncourt's theory of liability to make sense, the TAC would\n\nnecessarily have acted as de facto Plan administrator in\nEastern's stead; as discussed above, this theory is inconsistent\n\n                                55\n\fwith the Plan and clearly unsupported by the record.   Yet, even\n\nif we indulge the assumption that the TAC functioned as de facto\n\nadministrator, we remain convinced that the facts of this case\n\njustified the imposition of the moratorium and the concomitant\n\ndenial of Hunt's lump-sum benefit.64\n\n     When evaluating a plan administrator's decision to deny\n\nbenefits, a district court must first determine the appropriate\n\nstandard of review.   Firestone v. Bruch holds that “a denial of\n\nbenefits challenged under § 1132(a)(1)(B) is to be reviewed under\n\na de novo standard unless the benefit plan gives the\n\nadministrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine\n\neligibility or to construe the terms of the plan.”   489 U.S. 101,\n\n115, 109 S. Ct. 948, 956, 103 L.Ed.2d 80 (1989).   We have\n\ninterpreted Firestone to mandate an arbitrary and capricious\n\nstandard of review, which is often used interchangeably with an\n\nabuse of discretion standard, if the administrator has\n\ndiscretionary authority to make eligibility determinations or to\n\nconstrue disputed terms of the plan.   See Jett v. Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield of Ala., 890 F.2d 1137, 1139 (11th Cir. 1989).     To\n\ntrigger this standard of review, the language conferring\n\ndiscretion on the administrator must be “express language\n\nunambiguous in its design.”   Kirwan v. Marriott Corp., 10 F.3d\n\n784, 789 (11th Cir. 1994) (internal citations omitted).    If the\n\n\n     64\n       In its analysis, the district court assumed that the\ncommon law of trusts gave the TAC the power to impose the\nmoratorium. We need not make this assumption for this\nhypothetical scenario, however, because Article XIII of the Plan\nclearly gives the administrator the authority to impose a\nmoratorium.\n\n                                56\n\fadministrator suffers from a conflict of interest in rendering\n\nits determination, the district court should apply a heightened\n\narbitrary and capricious standard.   See Firestone, 489 U.S. at\n\n115, 109 S. Ct. at 957; see also Marecek v. BellSouth Telecomm.,\n\n49 F.3d 702, 705 (11th Cir. 1995).\n\n     The arbitrary and capricious standard is the appropriate\n\nstandard of review in this case because the Plan contains express\n\nlanguage conferring discretionary authority upon the\n\nadministrator to construe its terms.   Under section 2.2(a)\n\n(“Administration”), the administrator enjoys the authority to\n\n“initially determine all questions arising from the\n\nadministration, interpretation, and application of the Plan\n\npursuant to all applicable law, agreements and contracts, and\n\nsuch determination shall be binding upon all persons, except as\n\notherwise provided by law.”   We have held that comparable\n\nlanguage is sufficient to trigger review under the arbitrary and\n\ncapricious standard.   See Jett, 890 F.2d at 1139 (“[Plan\n\nadministrator] has the exclusive right to interpret the\n\nprovisions of th[is] Plan, so its decision is conclusive and\n\nbinding.”); Guy v. Southeastern Iron Workers' Welfare Fund, 877\nF.2d 37, 38-39 (11th Cir. 1989) (“[Administrator has] full power\n\nto construe the provisions of [the] Trust”).   Thus, we apply the\n\narbitrary and capricious standard of review to the TAC's\n\n“decision” as de facto administrator to deny Hunt's lump-sum\n\nbenefit.   We stress that our principal inquiry in this\n\nhypothetical situation is not whether the TAC was justified in\n\nimposing the moratorium, but whether the TAC was justified in\n\n                                57\n\fdenying Hunt's application for a lump-sum benefit.    Of course,\n\nour analysis of the latter issue necessarily implicates the\n\nformer.\n\n     Under the arbitrary and capricious standard of review, the\n\ncourt seeks “to determine whether there was a reasonable basis\n\nfor the [administrator's] decision, based upon the facts as known\n\nto the administrator at the time the decision was made.” Jett,\n\n890 F.2d at 1139.   The facts presented at trial bear out that the\n\nTAC acted reasonably in its decision as de facto administrator to\n\nimpose the moratorium on lump-sum payments.   First, the record\n\npaints an extremely bleak picture for the Plan in January 1991.\n\nIt is undisputed that the Plan was low on liquid assets as of the\n\neighteenth of that month.   Following the commencement of the\n\nChapter 11 reorganization proceeding on March 9, 1989, Eastern\n\nreduced and eventually stopped making contributions on behalf of\n\nits pilots.   Moreover, between 1986 and 1990, the amount of lump-\n\nsum payments paid to retiring pilots dramatically increased;\n\nfewer than twenty-five pilots selected another benefit option\n\nafter the lump-sum option became available in 1983.    In 1986,\n\nroughly $52,000,000 was disbursed in lump-sum payments; that\n\nnumber grew to more than $200,000,000 in 1990.65   Between January\n\n\n\n\n     65\n       The following amounts were distributed in lump-sum\npayments between 1986 and 1990: $52,091,000 (1986); $79,389,000\n(1987); $107,954,000 (1988); $181,856,000 (1989); and\n$200,540,000 (1990).\n\n                                58\n\f1 and January 18, 1991, already $38,000,000 had been disbursed as\n\nlump-sum payments.66\n\n     This paucity of liquid assets was further exacerbated by the\n\ndepressed performance of the Plan's substantial real estate\n\nholdings.   Former Citicorp president William Spencer, a member of\n\nthe TAC during the period in question, stated at trial that\n\n“[t]he real estate which comprised a sizable part of the fund was\n\nin a funk, and . . . unless some time was developed [so the real\n\nestate] could evolve, the hardships on all of the [Plan's]\n\nmembers would be very extreme.”    Another former TAC member,\n\nformer President Ford, stated in his deposition that the Plan\n\ncould not have made lump-sum payments to all retiring pilots\n\nwithout subjecting its real estate holdings to a “fire sale” at\n\nprices far below market value.    Both former TAC members agreed\n\nthat holding a fire sale of such potentially valuable assets\n\nwould have been grossly imprudent.     Hunt did not dispute the\n\nvalidity of this testimony.\n\n     Second, the terms of the Plan make clear that the\n\nadministrator owes an equal fiduciary duty to all Plan\n\nparticipants, including annuitants and those who have not elected\n\nany benefit option.    The administrator is required to treat all\n\nparticipants equally at all times in running the Plan.     See §\n\n2.2(a) (“[T]he Administrator . . . shall have those powers\n\nnecessary to carry out the day to day operation of the Plan . . .\n\nand initially determine all questions arising from the\n\n\n     66\n       At this rate, more than $60,000,000 would have been\ndisbursed in lump-sum payments in January 1991 alone.\n\n                                  59\n\fadministration, interpretation, and application of the Plan . . .\n\nprovided that each Participant shall be granted the same\n\ntreatment under similar conditions.”) (emphasis added).\n\nMoreover, as named fiduciary, the TAC bears a heavy obligation to\n\nALPA.     See supra part III.B (discussion of TAC's obligations to\n\nALPA under §§ 2.7(b), 2.8., and 2.11).\n\n     Hunt was one of approximately 2,500 pilots who were affected\n\nby Eastern's shutdown and the moratorium.      Like the hundreds of\n\nother Eastern pilots who failed to submit their benefit\n\napplications by the close of business on January 18, 1991, Hunt\n\nwas unable to take advantage of the original lump-sum option that\n\nwas in effect prior to Eastern's shutdown.\n\n     If the Plan administrator were to grant Hunt's lump-sum\n\nbenefit application, however, it would be arbitrarily favoring\n\nHunt over all of the other pilots who, like Hunt, did not submit\n\ntheir application before the imposition of the moratorium.      As a\n\nfiduciary under ERISA, the administrator owes a responsibility to\n\nadminister the plan “in accordance with the documents and\n\ninstruments governing the plan.”       ERISA § 404(a)(1)(D), 29 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1104(a)(1)(D).    The Plan plainly states that the administrator\n\nis required to discharge its duties in a manner ensuring that\n\n“each Participant shall be granted the same treatment under\n\nsimilar conditions.”     See § 2.2 (“Administration”) (emphasis\n\nadded).    Given this fiduciary responsibility, the administrator,\n\nwhen faced with Hunt's benefit application, made the reasonable\n\ndecision to treat Hunt exactly like all of the other pilots in\n\nhis position -- that is, to deny his lump-sum benefit despite its\n\n                                  60\n\f“approval” by Eastern's Pension Administration Department.\n\nTherefore, even assuming arguendo that the TAC functioned as de\n\nfacto administrator, we would find that its “denial” of Hunt's\n\nlump-sum benefit was reasonable based upon the facts known by it\n\nat that time.67   Accordingly, in this hypothetical case, the\n\nTAC's “denial” of Hunt's lump-sum benefits would pass muster\n\nunder the arbitrary and capricious standard of review.68\n\n\n\n                                IV.\n\n     Hunt cross-appeals the district court's refusal to impose a\n\nstatutory penalty on the TAC for its alleged failure to comply\n\nwith Hunt's requests for information.69   Under section 502(c) of\n\n\n     67\n       As indicated above, we have managed to locate ample\ninformation in the record to justify under the arbitrary and\ncapricious standard of review the imposition of the moratorium.\nWe would agree, however, with the district court's assessment\nthat the TAC presented its supporting evidence at trial in a\nwholly incoherent manner: “[B]ecause the [TAC's data was] either\nincomplete or not adequately explained, this court was left to\nwonder what the numbers and figures really meant.”\n     68\n       Although Hunt is not entitled to receive the total value\nof his accrued benefit in one full lump-sum payment, we assume\nthat he remains eligible to elect the modified lump-sum option\navailable under Document 91C like all other similarly situated\nEastern pilots affected by the shutdown and moratorium.\n     69\n       As stated in part II.A, supra, Hunt dispatched four\nletters allegedly in response to Eastern's February 4, 1991,\nletter to all Eastern pilots. His March 15, 1991, letter to Dyer\nof Hawthorne inquired about the status of his pension. His March\n20, 1991, letter to O'Connor requested the most current statement\nof his account and the most recent financial statement for the\nPlan “showing [its] assets and liabilities.” His July 15, 1991,\nletter to Dyer requested a statement of “the TAC's position on\nhis application,” copies of all amendments to the Plan affecting\nhis benefits, an explanation if the TAC were to deny his\napplication, and the name, address, and the forms necessary to\nfile a claim with the Pension Dispute Board if the TAC decided\nnot to pay his lump-sum benefit. This letter also was sent to\n\n                                 61\n\fERISA, an administrator who “fails or refuses to comply with a\n\nrequest for any information which such administrator is required\n\nby [ERISA] to furnish to a participant or beneficiary . . .\n\nwithin 30 days after such request may . . . be personally liable\n\nto such participant or beneficiary in the amount of up to $100 a\n\nday from the date of such failure or refusal.”    29 U.S.C. §\n\n1132(c).70    ERISA requires the administrator to provide\n\nparticipants with, inter alia, the latest updated summary plan\n\ndescription, the latest annual report, a statement to each\n\nparticipant indicating the total benefits accrued, and “other\n\ninstruments under which the plan is established or operated.”71\n\nSee ERISA §§ 104(b)(4), 105(a)(1), 29 U.S.C. §§ 1024(b)(4),\n\n1025(a)(1).    The imposition of this penalty is committed to the\n\ndistrict court's discretion.    ERISA § 502(c), 29 U.S.C. §\n\n1132(c).\n\n     The issue in this cross-appeal is whether the TAC should be\n\nconsidered an “administrator” for purposes of section 502(c) of\n\nERISA.    The previous discussion shows that the Plan designated\n\nEastern as Plan administrator, whereas the TAC served as named\n\n\nthe then-chairman of the TAC. His August 19, 1991, letter to\nO'Connor requested copies of the “amendments to the [Plan],” an\nexplanation of whether the TAC “had the right to amend the\n[Plan],” and a statement disclosing the number of applications\nfor lump-sum benefits filed since January 18, 1991.\n     70\n       Section 502(a)(1)(A) of ERISA empowers participants and\nbeneficiaries to sue “for the relief provided for in\nsubsection(c) of [section 502].\" 29 U.S.C. 1132(a)(1)(A).\n     71\n       In the alternative, the TAC argued that Hunt did not\nrequest information that ERISA requires an administrator to\nprovide. Like the district court, we make no ruling on this\nissue.\n\n                                  62\n\ffiduciary and as administrator of only the periodic-payment and\n\nloan options.72    Hunt contends, however, that the TAC functioned\n\nas de facto administrator and thus should be held liable for\n\nfailing to respond to his requests for information.\n\n     Hunt bases his claim on Law v. Ernst & Young, 956 F.2d 364\n\n(1st Cir. 1992), and Rosen v. TRW, Inc., 979 F.2d 191 (11th Cir.\n\n1992), in which we endorsed the analysis set forth in Law.73    In\n\nLaw, an ERISA-plan participant sued his former employer for\n\nfailing to provide requested information about his benefits in a\n\ntimely fashion; the plan documents in that case did not designate\n\nthe former employer as administrator.    After reviewing the plan\n\ndocuments in question, the First Circuit held that if the company\n\n“acted as the plan administrator in respect to dissemination of\n\ninformation concerning plan benefits, it may be properly treated\n\nas such for purposes of the liability provided under [section\n\n502(c)].”   Law, 956 F.2d at 373; see also Rosen, 979 F.2d at 193-\n\n94 (“We agree with the reasoning of the First Circuit and we hold\n\nthat if a company is administrating the plan, then it can be held\n\nliable for ERISA violations, regardless of the provisions of the\n\nplan document.”)    The Law court further reasoned that to refrain\n\n\n\n     72\n       See supra parts I.D and III.C. We note again that our\ndiscussion in part III.C merely assumes for the sake of argument\nthat the TAC served as Plan administrator. Of course, neither\nthe Plan nor the record provides a legitimate basis for making\nthat assumption.\n     73\n       Other circuits have concluded that, for the statutory\npenalty to apply, the administrator must be the entity so\ndesignated in the plan documents. See Jones v. UOP, 16 F.3d 141,\n144-45 (7th Cir. 1994); McKinsey v. Sentry Ins., 986 F.2d 401,\n404-05 (10th Cir. 1993).\n\n                                  63\n\ffrom imposing liability on such an entity simply because it is\n\nnot named as plan administrator “would cut off the remedy\n\nCongress intended to create.”   Law, 956 F.2d at 373.   Finding “a\n\nplethora of evidence” showing that the company had “controlled\n\nthe provision of information,” id. at 372, 373, the First Circuit\n\naffirmed the lower court's judgment for the statutory penalty.\n\nId. at 374.   In reaching this conclusion, the court emphasized\n\ntwo facts in particular:   (1) that the company, according to the\n\nplan documents, still exercised considerable control over plan\n\nadministration; and (2) that the plaintiff's requests for\n\ninformation were eventually answered by company employees on\n\ncompany stationery.   Id. at 373-74.\n\n     Although Hunt states in his brief that “Eastern had\n\ndelegated, and TAC had assumed, the role of Plan Administrator,”\n\nthe record demonstrates that this statement is patently\n\ninaccurate.   First, as discussed in parts I.D and III.C, supra,\n\nthe record makes clear that with the exception of the periodic-\n\npayment and loan options, which were added effective June 25,\n\n1991,74 Eastern retained its authority as administrator of the\nPlan at all relevant times.   In fact, a July 1991 letter sent\n\nfrom the TAC to all plan participants regarding the periodic-\n\npayment and loan options makes this fact unambiguously clear:\n\n“The [Plan's] Trust Administrative Committee is designated as\n\nAdministrator of both of these new [Plan] provisions only.   As in\n\nthe past, Eastern retains administrative authority over all other\n\n\n     74\n       Hunt did not participate in either the periodic-payment\nor loan option, so this issue is not germane to his claim.\n\n                                64\n\fprovisions of the [Plan].”75   Consequently, Eastern retained its\n\nresponsibility under the Plan to provide information such as plan\n\nsummaries and annual statements to all participants.    See §§ 2.5,\n\n2.6.\n\n       Second, Hunt's claim fails because he misinterprets\n\nEastern's simple instructions to all participants in its\n\nFebruary 4, 1991, letter.    Hunt argues in his brief that this\n\nletter, which was sent by Eastern and printed on Eastern\n\nstationery, indicated that the “TAC was the authority designated\n\nby the Plan Administrator for dissemination of information\n\nregarding the [Plan].”    This short letter, however, stated that\n\n“[q]uestions regarding the temporary moratorium should be\n\naddressed to the [TAC]” (emphasis added); it made no\n\nrepresentation that the TAC was now responsible for providing\n\nplan summaries, annual statements, amendments, and other such\n\ninformation to participants.76   Furthermore, with the exception\n\nof the TAC’s responsibilities as administrator of the periodic-\n\npayment and loan options, the record is devoid of evidence\n\nshowing that the TAC had assumed any of Eastern's duties\n\n\n       75\n       This letter was sent pursuant to the TAC's authority\nunder § 10.2(c) “[t]o furnish to . . . Participants such reports\nwith respect to the functions, actions, and decisions of the\n[TAC] as are reasonable and appropriate.”\n       76\n       Hunt's arguments on this claim reveal a profound\nmisunderstanding about basic aspects of the Plan. For example,\nhe contends that the “TAC further held themselves out to be the\nPlan Administrator by claiming to be negotiating for, and\nselecting, an administrative services provider.” The Plan,\nhowever, charges the TAC, as named fiduciary, with the\nresponsibility for selecting investment advisors and other\nadministrative service personnel, provided that the TAC obtains\nALPA's consent. See §§ 2.9, 2.13(c),(d).\n\n                                 65\n\fregarding the provision of information to participants.   We\n\ntherefore hold that Hunt has failed to support his contention\n\nthat the TAC functioned as de facto Plan administrator and that\n\nthe district court properly declined to impose a penalty on the\n\nTAC pursuant to ERISA § 502(c), 29 U.S.C. § 1132(c).\n\n\n\n                                V.\n\n     In light of the above, we REVERSE the judgment of the\n\ndistrict court awarding $352,748.74 plus costs to Hunt from the\n\ncoffers of the Plan's Fund (Counts II and IV).77   We AFFIRM the\n\ndecision of the district court to deny Hunt the assessment of a\n\nstatutory penalty under section 502(c) of ERISA (Count I).\n\n\n\n\n     77\n       Although the district court gave Hunt judgment on Count\nVII, it refused to give him the relief he sought in that count.\nSee supra note 48 and accompanying text. Nonetheless, for\ncompleteness, we reverse the court’s judgment on Count VII as\nwell as the court’s judgment on Counts II and IV.\n\n                                66\n\f",

Hunt is a retired Eastern Air Lines (“Eastern”)\n\npilot seeking to recover a lump-sum retirement benefit under the\n\nEastern Air Lines Variable Benefit Retirement Plan for Pilots\n\n(the “Plan”).1   Eastern, the Plan’s administrator, which is a\n\ndebtor before the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of\n\nNew York, has refused to pay the benefit because the Plan has\n\nbeen amended, with the approval of the bankruptcy court, to\n\nforeclose the lump-sum benefit Hunt seeks.   As the Plan now\n\nstands, Hunt is entitled to receive only a modified lump-sum\n\nbenefit: he may receive a partial distribution immediately and\n\nsubsequent payments over time as the Plan’s assets are\n\nliquidated.\n\n     Hunt rejected this modified lump-sum benefit, as well as\n\nother payment options provided under the Plan, and sued Eastern;\n\nthe Air Line Pilots Association (“ALPA”), the pilots’ union;\n\nCharles H. Copeland, the Chairman of the Trust Administrative\n\nCommittee (the “TAC”), the Plan’s named fiduciary; Paul M.\n\nO’Connor, Jr., of O'Connor, Morris & Jones, the TAC’s legal\n\ncounsel (the “O'Connor law firm”); and Hawthorne Associates, Inc.\n\n(“Hawthorne”), the TAC’s principal investment advisor, to recover\n\nhis retirement benefit in a lump sum.   Hunt brought his suit\n\nunder the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974\n\n(\"ERISA\"), Pub. L. No. 93-406, 88 Stat. 829, 29 U.S.C. §§ 1001-\n\n\n     1\n        The Plan’s originating document refers to the plan as the\n“B-Plan.” For simplicity, we use the name “Plan.”\n\n                                 2\n\f1461 (1994).   His complaint, framed in six counts, asked for\n\ncompensatory and punitive damages, injunctive relief in the form\n\nof an order requiring the defendants to pay his lump-sum benefit,\n\nstatutory penalties, and attorneys’ fees.\n\n     Eastern’s Bankruptcy Trustee, in a motion for summary\n\njudgment, contended that Eastern could not be held liable to Hunt\n\nbecause it had properly discharged its responsibilities as\n\nadministrator under the Plan.   Later, when opposing Hunt's motion\n\nfor leave to filed an amended complaint, Eastern argued that\n\nHunt’s claim for a lump-sum benefit had been foreclosed by a\n\nbankruptcy court ruling against Hunt in Eastern’s bankruptcy\n\ncase.   In an apparent attempt to avoid the effect of this ruling,\n\nHunt voluntarily dismissed Eastern from the case with prejudice\n\nand, with leave of court, filed an amended complaint against\n\nthree defendants -- Hawthorne, the TAC, and the Plan -- that\n\nasserted essentially the same claims presented in his initial\n\ncomplaint.\n\n     The case was tried to the district court; by that time, the\n\nonly defendants before the court were the TAC and the Plan.\n\nWithout referring to the bankruptcy court’s ruling against Hunt,\n\nthe court held that he was entitled to his lump-sum benefit and\n\nentered judgment for Hunt in the amount of that benefit.   The\n\njudgment stated that the benefit was to be satisfied out of the\n\nPlan's fund of assets.   The court rejected Hunt’s remaining\n\nclaims and entered judgment for the defendants.\n\n\n\n                                 3\n\f       The TAC and the Plan now appeal.    Hunt cross-appeals the\n\ncourt’s rejection of his claim requesting the court to impose a\n\nstatutory penalty on the defendants.      We reverse the court’s\n\njudgment against the TAC and the Plan, and affirm its judgment on\n\nthe statutory-penalty claim.\n\n\n\n                                  I.\n\n       Hunt claims that, under ERISA and the provisions of the\n\nPlan, he is entitled to recover his retirement benefits in a lump\n\nsum.    Unlike the typical scenario in which a participant in an\n\nemployee benefit plan sues to recover ERISA benefits, Hunt sought\n\nhis lump-sum payment while the administrator of the Plan,\n\nEastern, was undergoing a highly publicized bankruptcy proceeding\n\nthat ultimately resulted in the company’s demise.     In addition to\n\nscrutinizing ERISA and the provisions and operation of the Plan,\n\nwe must therefore consider the interrelationship between the Plan\n\nand Eastern's bankruptcy in order to evaluate Hunt's claims for\n\nrelief.\n\n\n\n                                  A.\n\n       ERISA is a “comprehensive and reticulated statute” that\n\ncreated a framework for the administration and maintenance of\n\nprivate employee benefit plans.

See, e.g., ERISA § 101(b), 29 U.S.C. § 1021(b)\n\n(duty to file plan description, modifications and changes, and\n\nreports with the Department of Labor); ERISA § 105(a), 29 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1025(a) (duty to provide plan participants with information\n\nregarding their benefits).\n\n     The written instrument must also “provide for one or more\n\nnamed fiduciaries who jointly or severally shall have authority\n\nto control and manage the operation and administration of the\n\nplan.”   ERISA § 402(a)(1), 29 U.S.C. § 1102(a)(1).

Under\nERISA § 3(21)(A), 29 U.S.C. § 1002(21)(A), a fiduciary includes\nnot only those who “exercise[] any discretionary authority or\ndiscretionary control respecting management of such plan or\nexercise[] any authority or control respecting management or\ndisposition of its assets,” but also those who “[have]\ndiscretionary authority or discretionary responsibility in the\nadministration of such plan.” The Supreme Court has referred to\nERISA's definition of fiduciary as “artificial.” Mertens, 508\nU.S. at 255 n.5.\n     3\n       Given the seminal importance of the written instrument\nunder ERISA, we are puzzled why the parties made little more than\na passing reference to the Plan documents in their briefs and at\noral argument.\n     For simplicity and clarity, we refer to the specific\nprovisions of the Plan by citing directly to the relevant section\nor subsection. In some instances, the title of the section or\nsubsection is noted parenthetically.\n\n                                 6\n\f     The Plan is a variable benefit pension plan for Eastern\n\npilots that was created in 1958 pursuant to a collective\n\nbargaining agreement between Eastern and ALPA.     The parties\n\nrewrote the Plan in the 1970s to comply with ERISA and\n\nsubsequently amended it in 1986.4\n\n     The Plan is a “defined contribution plan.”5    According to 26\n\nU.S.C. § 414(i), a defined contribution plan is a “plan [that]\n\nprovides for an individual account for each participant and for\n\nbenefits based solely on the amount contributed to the\n\nparticipant's account, and any income, expenses, gains and\n\nlosses, and any forfeitures of accounts of other participants\n\nwhich may be allocated to such participant's account.”     More\n\nsimply, in the words of an ALPA newsletter sent to Eastern\n\npilots, a participant's interest in a defined contribution plan\n\nis “determined solely by contributions made in a beneficiary's\n\nname and the subsequent investment performance of those\n\ncontributions.”   The Plan requires that Eastern make\n\ncontributions on behalf of each participant, see § 4.1 (“Eastern\n\nContributions”),6 for investment in stocks, bonds, real estate,\n\n     4\n       The original written instrument that established the Plan\nis known as \"Document 91.\" The 1986 amendment is known as\n“Document 91A.”\n     5\n       Section 12.14 of the Plan, titled “Plan Is Defined\nContribution Plan,” states: “Since [the Plan's inception], the\nPlan has been and continues to be a defined contribution plan.”\nThis section appears in Document 91C, an amendment to the Plan\nthat will be discussed in part I.D, infra.\n     6\n       According to the original agreement, Eastern was to\ncontribute on behalf of each participant an amount equal to 11%\nof his compensation. On February 23, 1986, Eastern and ALPA\n\n                                 7\n\fand other assets.   These investments constitute the Plan’s\n\n“Variable Fund” (the “Fund”).    See § 1.36 (“Variable Fund”).7   As\n\na result, the value of a participant's interest in the Plan\n\ndepends not only upon the funds contributed but also on the\n\ninvestment return on the Fund's assets.

See\n\n§ 5.1 (“Fund Value”).\n\n     The Plan designates Eastern as the “plan administrator.\"\n\nEastern has “those powers necessary to carry out the day to day\n\noperation of the Plan.”   See § 2.2(a) (“Administration”).    Those\n\npowers include the broad responsibility to “initially determine\n\nall questions arising from the administration, interpretation,\n\nand application of the Plan pursuant to all applicable law,\n\nagreements and contracts and such determination shall be binding\n\nupon all persons, except as otherwise provided by law, and\n\nfurther provided that each Participant shall be granted the same\n\n\nsigned a collective bargaining agreement that adjusted Eastern's\ncontribution level in two ways: (1) for pilots employed before\nMarch 2, 1986, Eastern's contribution was set at 10% effective\nJanuary 1, 1988; (2) for pilots employed on or after March 2,\n1986, Eastern's contribution was set at 3%. In addition,\nparticipants had the option of contributing up to 10% of their\nearnings as “optional additional contributions” to augment their\ninterest in the Plan. See § 4.2 (“Optional Additional\nContributions”).\n     7\n       According to § 1.36,   the Fund is “the property of the\nPlan, . . . all of which is   held in trust pursuant to Trust\nAgreement between the [TAC]   and State Street Bank and Trust\nCompany . . . and any other   trust created for such purpose by the\n[TAC].”\n\n                                  8\n\ftreatment under similar conditions.”   Id.   The Plan also charges\n\nEastern with the responsibility for, inter alia, keeping records,\n\nsee § 2.4 (“Records”), preparing and distributing periodic Plan\nsummaries, see § 2.5 (“Plan Summary”), and sending to each\n\nparticipant an annual statement reflecting the value of his\n\ninvestment in the Plan, see § 2.6 (“Annual Statement”).   Section\n\n13.1 of Article XIII, which is titled “Modification, Suspension\n\nor Discontinuance,” grants Eastern the authority to unilaterally\n\nmodify, suspend, or discontinue any feature of the Plan, provided\n\nthat any such action does not \"adversely affect\" any benefits\n\n\"already provided\" to a participant under the Plan.   An exercise\n\nof this authority, however, would not constitute an amendment to\n\nthe Plan.8\n\n     The Plan designates the TAC, a small committee that monitors\n\nthe management of the Plan’s assets,9 as its \"named fiduciary.\"\n\n     8\n       The Plan documents do not explicitly describe how the Plan\nmay be formally amended. The closest provision is § 14.1, which\nstates that Eastern and ALPA must agree upon any modification\nthat is necessary for the Plan to qualify as a pension plan under\nERISA. See § 14.1 (“Qualification of Plan”). The record makes\nclear, however, that both Eastern and ALPA must approve any\nsubstantive amendment to the Plan, with the exception of an\namendment made pursuant to § 1113(e) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11\nU.S.C. § 1113(e). See infra note 20.\n     9\n       The TAC initially consisted of two members selected by\nALPA, two members selected by Eastern, and three “outside”\nmembers chosen by ALPA and Eastern. By the time of the events\ninvolved in the present controversy, the Plan had been amended to\nprovide that two members were to be selected by ALPA, and five\noutside members would be appointed by the existing TAC members\nwith ALPA’s approval. TAC’s outside members at this time\nincluded former President Gerald R. Ford; a former president of\nCiticorp, William I. Spencer; a former chairman of the board of\nMetropolitan Life Insurance Company, George P. Jenkins; and a\nformer dean of the Harvard Business School, Lawrence E. Fouraker.\n\n                                9\n\fUnder the Plan, the TAC has \"overall supervisory responsibility\n\nof the administrative functions of the Fund,\" see § 2.13(b)(i)\n\n(“Fund Administration”), and the duty \"to maintain surveillance\n\nover the status and administration of the Plan and the [Fund],\"\n\nsee § 10.2(b) (“Rights and Duties of the [TAC]”).   It must\n\n“regularly and periodically suppl[y]” information to ALPA about\n\n“transactional detail, cash flow reports, investment status,\n\ndocumentation and Fund performance,” see § 2.11 (“Information and\n\nAccountability”), and furnish to ALPA and Plan participants\n\nreports about the TAC's “functions, actions, and decisions . . .\n\nas are reasonable and appropriate.”   See § 10.2(c).   Furthermore,\n\nthe TAC is charged with the responsibility of selecting and\n\nreplacing investment advisors and trustees of the Fund's assets,\n\nsee § 2.7(b) (“Trust Agreement and Trustee”), as well as giving\n\ndirections and instructions to these trustees, see § 2.8\n\n(“Directions to Trustee(s)”).   Before selecting or replacing\n\ninvestment advisors or trustees, however, the TAC must notify\n\nALPA of the TAC's planned course of action and give ALPA an\n\nopportunity to respond, see § 2.7(b), thus effectively giving\n\nALPA a quasi-veto power over these decisions.   Similarly, before\n\ngiving any notice or instruction to a Fund trustee, the TAC must\n\nnotify ALPA and give it fifteen days to object.   See § 2.8.\n\n\n\n\n     The compensation for the outside TAC members is paid by the\nFund, see § 2.2(b)(iii), whereas the compensation for TAC members\nfrom ALPA is paid by ALPA, see § 10.1(b)(ii).\n\n                                10\n\f     Pursuant to its authority under sections 2.7 and 2.13(d),10\n\nthe TAC hired Hawthorne as the Plan's principal investment\n\nadvisor/manager for the time period relevant in this case.\n\nHawthorne's duties are enumerated in a written “investment\n\nadvisor agreement\" between the TAC and Hawthorne.   According to\n\nthe testimony of Hawthorne's chairman, Charles G. Dyer, Hawthorne\n\nassumed many of the TAC’s administrative duties involving the\n\nFund and its assets, including the scheduling of TAC meetings and\n\nthe release of quarterly statements to participants about the\n\nvalue of the Fund's assets.   In essence, Hawthorne served \"at the\n\npleasure of the [TAC].\"\n\n\n\n                                C.\n\n     Since the Plan's inception, an Eastern pilot choosing normal\n\nor early retirement could elect to receive his benefits in the\n\nform of monthly annuity payments.11   Beginning in 1983, a\n\n\n\n     10\n       According to § 2.13(d), the TAC “may delegate to any\nperson, including, but not limited to, Investment Advisors, all\nor any portion of the [TAC's] powers, duties and responsibilities\nto establish and maintain a Fund Office, to maintain records and\nto prepare reports and documentation. The [TAC] shall make such\ndelegations in writing and is authorized to pay reasonable fees,\ncharges and costs of the person or persons providing such\nservice.” This delegation of authority is consistent with ERISA.\nSee ERISA § 402(c)(3), 29 U.S.C. § 1102(c)(3).\n     11\n       The Plan provided participants with a panoply of annuity\noptions. Retiring pilots selecting an annuity could choose from\nthe post-retirement joint and survivor annuity, the contingent\nannuity, the level income option, the life annuity option, and\nthe deferred payment option. See § 6.2 (“Available Forms of\nPayment”). There also was a disability benefit option. See §\n6.3 (“Disability Benefit”).\n\n                                11\n\fretiring pilot also could elect to receive his benefits in the\n\nform of a lump-sum payment.\n\n     Processing an application for a lump-sum benefit involved\n\nfive steps.12    First, a pilot seeking a lump-sum payment would\n\ncomplete the necessary paperwork and inform the Chief Pilot, an\n\nEastern management employee, of his intention to retire.    Second,\n\nthe Chief Pilot would check to make sure that the pilot met age\n\ncriteria to qualify for normal or early retirement benefits under\n\nthe Plan.13    Third, if the pilot met the age qualifications, the\n\nChief Pilot would inform the Eastern Pension and Insurance\n\nDepartment about the pilot's decision to retire.    Fourth, the\n\nEastern Pension and Insurance Department would contact the Plan's\n\nactuary, William M. Mercer, Inc., which would determine the\n\nprecise amount of benefits to which the retiring pilot was\n\nentitled.     Fifth, the actuary would then give that information to\n\nthe State Street Bank & Trust Company, a Plan trustee, which\n\nwould make the distribution to the pilot.    The lump-sum payment\n\n\n\n\n     12\n       The Plan does not explicitly set forth the procedure for\nprocessing claims for retirement benefits. The above account of\nthe claims-processing procedure is taken from the deposition and\naffidavit of Charles Dyer of Hawthorne and from the affidavit of\nBrian P. White, who served as Director of the Eastern Pension and\nInsurance Department. Both accounts of Eastern's claims-\nprocessing procedure are virtually identical. After the trial,\nthe district court, in fashioning its order directing the entry\nof judgment, relied exclusively on the account given in the White\naffidavit.\n     13\n       Normal retirement age under the Plan is 60. See § 1.22\n(“Normal Retirement Age”). The minimum early retirement age is\n50. See § 1.15 (“Early Retirement Date”).\n\n                                  12\n\fwould be equal to the entire actuarial present value14 of the\n\npilot's accrued benefit15 as of his effective retirement date.16\n\nSee § 6.2(e)(i) (“Lump Sum Option”).   A pilot dissatisfied with\n\nthe disposition of his application for benefits could pursue\n\nadministrative relief with the Pension Dispute Board pursuant to\n\nArticle XI (“Determination of Disputes”) of the Plan.17\n\n\n\n                                D.\n\n     In the late 1980s, Eastern was experiencing severe financial\n\ndifficulties against the backdrop of a highly publicized labor\n\ndispute.   On March 9, 1989, Eastern filed for bankruptcy\n\nprotection under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §§\n\n     14\n       “Actuarial present value” is the current value of monthly\nbenefits determined by the current value of an annuity unit at\nthe most recent valuation. See § 1.6 (“Actuarial Present\nValue”).\n     15\n       An “accrued benefit” is essentially the total number of\n“annuity units” credited to the account of a participant. See §\n1.2 (“Accrued Benefit”). An annuity unit is a unit of measure\nrepresenting a share in the Fund. See § 1.7 (“Annuity Unit”).\n     16\n       “Effective retirement date” essentially means the normal\nretirement date or early retirement date. See § 1.18 (“Effective\nRetirement Date”). The normal retirement date is the first day\nof the month coinciding with or otherwise next following a\nparticipant's 60th birthday. See § 1.23 (“Normal Retirement\nDate”). The early retirement date is the first day of the month\non which a participant elects to retire and receive a pension,\nprovided that he is at least 50 years old. See § 1.15(a) (“Early\nRetirement Date”).\n     17\n       The Pension Dispute Board consisted of four members: two\nwere selected by Eastern and two were selected by ALPA. The\nBoard had the authority to hear and determine “[a]ll disputes\nconcerning the application, interpretation or administration of\nthe Plan in respect to individual employees and their\nparticipation in or their benefits under the Plan.” § 11.2\n(“Authority [of Pension Dispute Board]”).\n\n                                13\n\f1101-1174, in the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of\n\nNew York.   On March 20, 1990, Eastern and ALPA signed an interim\n\nletter of agreement, effective March 2, 1990, fixing Eastern's\n\ncontribution to the Plan for all pilots at 3% of compensation.18\n\nOn April 18, 1990, the bankruptcy court named Martin R. Shugrue\n\nas Bankruptcy Trustee of Eastern (the “Bankruptcy Trustee”).    The\n\nBankruptcy Trustee began liquidating certain company assets in an\n\nattempt to reorganize Eastern as a smaller carrier.19\n\n     On September 11, 1990, the Bankruptcy Trustee, proceeding\n\nunder section 1113(e) of the Bankruptcy Code, applied to the\n\nbankruptcy court for an order, which the court entered, approving\n\nan amendment to the Plan.20   Pursuant to this order, Eastern\n\nreduced its contribution to the Plan to 0% for compensation\n\nearned by pilots after August 11, 1990, and provided for\n\nresumption of its contribution of 3% for such compensation on or\n\nafter June 1, 1991.   This amendment also suspended the Pension\n\n     18\n       For Eastern pilots employed before March 2, 1986, Eastern\nhad been contributing 10% of compensation since January 1, 1988.\nSee supra note 6.\n     19\n       The record indicates that the Eastern Pension and\nInsurance Department retained its authority and continued to\nperform its responsibilities under the supervision of the\nBankruptcy Trustee.\n     20\n       Section 1113(e) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §\n1113(e), states that the bankruptcy court, “after notice and a\nhearing, may authorize the trustee to implement interim changes\nin the terms, conditions, wages, benefits, or work rules provided\nby a collective bargaining agreement.” The bankruptcy court may\nauthorize such measures only if they occur “during a period when\nthe collective bargaining agreement continues in effect,” and “if\n[such measures are] essential to the continuation of the debtor's\nbusiness, or in order to avoid irreparable damage to the estate.”\n\n\n                                 14\n\fDispute Board’s powers effective August 11, 1991.    ALPA objected\n\nto the Bankruptcy Trustee’s action and appealed to the district\n\ncourt the bankruptcy court’s order authorizing this amendment.\n\nThe record does not inform us of the district court’s disposition\n\nof this appeal.\n\n     After Eastern's Chapter 11 filing, the Fund became\n\nincreasingly illiquid due to three factors.    First, because\n\nEastern had suspended and eventually ceased making contributions\n\nto the Plan, the Fund's sole source of cash was the return on its\n\ninvestments.   Second, a substantial portion of the Fund's assets\n\nwere invested in real estate, which was depressed in value due to\n\na nationwide real estate recession.    Third, the lump-sum option\n\nfor receiving benefits had become increasingly popular with\n\nretiring pilots.   In fact, the annual amount distributed in lump-\n\nsum payments had risen steadily from $52,000,000 in 1986 to more\n\nthan $200,000,000 in 1990.\n\n     On January 18, 1991, Eastern shut down its operations,\n\neffectively retiring the approximately 2,500 pilots in its employ\n\nat the time.   The same day, O'Connor of the O'Connor law firm,\n\nwhich served as counsel to the TAC, contacted Brian P. White,\n\nDirector of Eastern's Pension and Insurance Department, and told\n\nWhite that the TAC “recommended” that Eastern place a temporary\n\nmoratorium on lump-sum payments.     White, in response, said that\n\nEastern lacked the authority to impose a moratorium.    On January\n\n19, 1991, O’Connor confirmed the recommendation by letter, a copy\nof which he sent to ALPA, the TAC, and Hawthorne.\n\n\n                                15\n\f     On January 27, 1991, according to the deposition testimony\n\nof former President Gerald R. Ford, the TAC voted unanimously to\n\nimpose the temporary moratorium.21    The record does not disclose\n\nhow the TAC planned to implement the moratorium.\n\n     On January 28, 1991, O'Connor, representatives of ALPA and\n\nEastern and their respective attorneys,22 met to discuss the need\n\nto place a temporary moratorium on lump-sum payments.    The record\n\ndoes not disclose whether at this meeting the parties discussed\n\nArticle XIII of the Plan, which gives Eastern the power to\n\n“modify, suspend . . . or discontinu[e] . . . any feature [of the\n\nPlan].”\n\n     On February 1, 1991, the TAC issued a “Certificate of Action\n\nof the [TAC of the Plan] Taken upon Unanimous Written Consent.”\n\nIn this document, the TAC stated that it, “as named fiduciary of\n\nthe [Plan], has decided to, and hereby does, impose a temporary\n\nmoratorium upon the payment of benefits to all Eastern pilots who\n\nshall file requests for benefits after the close of business on\n\nJanuary 18, 1991.”23   This Certificate also instructed O'Connor\n\nto “notify [Eastern] of the [TAC's] request that Eastern, as\n\n     21\n       In his deposition, former President Ford, a member of the\nTAC at the time the moratorium was imposed, see supra note 9,\nstated that “[the decision to impose the moratorium] was\nunanimous between Mr. Spencer, Mr. Jenkins, Mr. Fouraker, the\n[ALPA] members, and myself.”\n     22\n       The record does not indicate whether the Bankruptcy\nTrustee was present, or represented, at the meeting.\n     23\n       The moratorium did not affect participants who were\nalready receiving annuities or who had submitted their\napplication for a lump-sum benefit by the close of business on\nJanuary 18, 1991.\n\n                                 16\n\f[Plan] Administrator, promptly notify all Eastern pilots who\n\nshall file requests for benefits after the close of business on\n\nJanuary 18, 1991, that, until further notice, a temporary\n\nmoratorium has been placed in effect by [the TAC].”   Pursuant to\n\nthe TAC's request, Eastern mailed notice of the moratorium to all\n\nof its pilots on February 4, 1991.24   In this notice, Eastern\n\nadvised pilots that “[q]uestions regarding the temporary\n\nmoratorium should be addressed to the [TAC]” at one of the\n\nfollowing addresses: (1) the TAC, care of the O'Connor law firm;\n\nor (2) the TAC, care of Hawthorne.\n\n     White stated that, after Eastern's shutdown and the\n\ncommencement of the moratorium, the procedure for processing\n\nclaims for benefits under the Plan remained the same except for\n\ntwo changes: (1) the retiring pilot would contact Eastern's\n\nPension and Insurance Department directly rather than go through\n\nthe Chief Pilot; and (2) Eastern's Pension and Insurance\n\nDepartment would inform the actuary whether a participant had\n\napplied for benefits following the shutdown.   If the participant\n\nhad applied after the shutdown, the bank would not issue a\n\nbenefit check.\n\n     On May 22, 1991, the TAC mailed a letter and a videotape to\n\nall Plan participants and beneficiaries.   The letter and\n\nvideotape were designed to inform these parties about the current\n\n\n     24\n       This mailing consisted of two documents: (1) a brief\ncover letter printed on Eastern stationery; and (2) a two-page\nnotice about the moratorium signed by the TAC and addressed to\nall Eastern pilots.\n\n                                17\n\fstatus of the Plan and its plans for the future in light of the\n\n“present liquidity issues confronting the [Plan]” -- that is, the\n\nstate of the Plan after Eastern's shutdown and bankruptcy.\n\n     On June 25, 1991, the Bankruptcy Trustee and ALPA modified\n\nthe Plan by letter of agreement.25     This agreement modified the\n\nPlan in three significant ways.    First, the Plan provided for a\n\nperiodic-payment option that enabled participants to receive\n\ntheir retirement benefit in substantially equal monthly payments\n\nthat were made for life (or life expectancy).     See § 6.11\n\n(“Periodic Payments”).    These payments would be exempt from the\n\nten percent additional tax assessed on early distributions from\n\nqualified retirement plans.26    Second, a new article (Article XV)\n\nwas added in order to enable participants to take out loans from\n\nthe Plan during this time of financial uncertainty.27     The\n\n     25\n          This agreement is known as “Document 91B.”\n     26\n       Under the “periodic payment” option, a participant could\nelect to receive the actuarial present value of his accrued\nbenefit in the form of periodic monthly payments as described in\nI.R.C. § 72(t)(2)(A)(iv), 26 U.S.C. § 72(t)(2)(A)(iv); under this\noption, the benefit amount was determined as of the date of\nreceipt. Participants who were receiving an annuity or had an\noutstanding balance on a loan from the Fund were not eligible for\nthis option. If the periodic-payment arrangement was\ndiscontinued or altered within five years after it started or\nbefore the participant reached age 59.5, whichever was later, the\nparticipant's subsequent election of another form of benefit from\nthe Plan would trigger the 10% penalty tax normally associated\nwith premature distributions, unless the participant was 55 or\nolder when separating from Eastern. If the penalty tax was\ntriggered, it would be applied retroactively to those amounts\npreviously withdrawn. See § 6.11.\n     27\n       Participants who were annuitants or periodic-payment\nrecipients were not eligible to receive loans from the Plan. The\nmaximum loan that could be made was the lesser of $50,000 or 25%\nof the actuarial present value of the participant's accrued\n\n                                  18\n\famendment provided that the TAC would serve as administrator for\n\nthese two provisions; Eastern, however, retained its\n\nadministrative authority for all other provisions of the Plan.\n\nSee §§ 6.11(f), 15.1.    Third, the Plan was amended to provide\n\nthat the value of benefits distributed from the Plan was to be\n\ndetermined at the time of distribution.      Thus, the value of a\n\nparticipant's lump-sum benefit would no longer be determined as\n\nof the effective retirement date.      See § 6.2(e)(i).\n\n     On July 27, 1992, pending approval by the bankruptcy court,\n\nthe Bankruptcy Trustee and ALPA entered into a letter of\n\nagreement once again.    Referred to as Document 91C, this proposed\n\namendment would make two fundamental changes to the Plan.      First,\n\nthe Fund would be divided into a liquid portion (i.e., cash,\n\nmarketable stocks, and bonds) and an illiquid portion (i.e., real\n\nestate, alternative investments, and working capital).      Each Plan\n\nparticipant would have a percentage interest in both the liquid\n\nand illiquid portions of the Fund rather than an interest in the\n\nFund as a whole.   Second, the lump-sum option was modified to\n\nprovide for a partial distribution -- that is, an immediate cash\n\npayment equal to the liquid portion of each eligible\n\nparticipant's account.    A participant selecting this option also\n\nwould receive extended payments over time as the real estate and\n\nother illiquid assets were sold.      The modified lump-sum option\n\n\n\n\nbenefit at the time of loan.    See § 15.4 (“Plan Loans”).\n\n                                 19\n\fhad become feasible because of recent favorable changes in the\n\ntax code for partial distributions.28\n\n       On August 19, 1992, pursuant to its duties under section\n\n10.2(c), the TAC sent a letter to all Plan participants to\n\ndescribe the modified lump-sum option and to explain why the\n\nmoratorium had been imposed:\n\n       The lump sum option in the [Plan] has been modified by\n       Document 91-C to address the reality that the [Plan] has a\n       substantial amount of high quality illiquid assets that\n       cannot be liquidated quickly without suffering a substantial\n       discount in order to achieve a quick sale. The [Plan] does\n       not have sufficient cash and other liquid assets to allow\n       eligible participants to take their lump sum in cash. This\n       is what caused the imposition of the moratorium in January\n       1991.\n\n       On October 1, 1992, the Bankruptcy Trustee and ALPA filed a\n\njoint motion in the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of\n\nNew York seeking approval of the amendment provided by Document\n\n91C.    On November 13, 1992, the bankruptcy court granted their\n\nmotion and approved the amendment to the Plan, effectively ending\n\nthe moratorium.    The operative date of the Document 91C amendment\n\nwas June 30, 1992.\n\n\n\n                                 II.\n\n                                 A.\n\n\n\n\n       28\n       Effective January 1, 1993, partial distributions from a\nqualified pension plan could be rolled over into an individual\nretirement account (“IRA”) without adverse tax consequences. See\n26 U.S.C. § 402(c)(4) (1993). Before this change, a participant\ncould not roll over a partial distribution into an IRA without\nsignificant tax liability. See 26 U.S.C. § 402(a)(5)(D) (1991).\n\n\n                                 20\n\f     Harry Hunt worked as a pilot for Eastern for twenty-four\n\nyears.    He elected to retire effective March 1, 1991, and demands\n\nthat he be paid a lump-sum benefit for the value of his interest\n\nin the Plan as of that date.29   On February 22, 1991, Eastern's\n\nPension and Insurance Department received his application for\n\nbenefits, which was signed by Hunt on February 5, 1991.   On April\n\n22, 1991, the manager of Eastern's Pension Administration\n\nDepartment, Ms. S.W. Boles,30 approved Hunt's application and\n\nauthorized payment of his benefits.31   Given Eastern's\n\ninstruction to the actuary that it apply the moratorium to those\n\napplications submitted after January 18, 1991, the State Street\n\nBank and Trust never made any payment to Hunt.    Although Hunt is\n\neligible to receive a modified lump-sum benefit and future\n\npayments in accordance with the Document 91C amendment, he has\n\nrefused to elect that option.    In addition, Hunt did not select\n\nthe periodic-payment option nor did he take out a loan from the\n\nPlan.\n\n\n\n\n     29\n       The parties agree that the value of Hunt's accrued\nbenefit in the Fund as of March 1, 1991, was $352,748.74.\n     30\n       The record does not disclose the relationship between\nEastern's Pension and Insurance Department and Eastern's Pension\nAdministration Department. Given the facts before us, we assume\nthat the latter department carried out the policies and\ndirectives of the former department.\n     31\n       Hunt's application requested that his lump sum be rolled\nover into his IRA at Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc. If a lump-sum\ndistribution was rolled over into an IRA or other eligible\nretirement plan within 60 days, the lump-sum payment would not be\nincluded in gross income for the taxable year in which paid. See\nI.R.C. § 402(a)(5), 26 U.S.C. § 402(a)(5) (1991).\n\n                                 21\n\f     Dissatisfied with the progress of his application, Hunt\n\ndispatched four letters, the first by himself and the other three\n\nthrough two different attorneys.     He alleges that these letters\n\nwere sent pursuant to the instructions in Eastern's February 4,\n\n1991, letter to all Eastern pilots.    On March 15, 1991, Hunt\n\nwrote to Charles G. Dyer, the chairman of Hawthorne, to inquire\n\nabout the status of his pension.32    On March 20, 1991, through\n\nthe first of three attorneys whom Hunt employed in this\n\ncontroversy,33 he wrote to O'Connor in order to request the most\n\ncurrent statement of his account and the most recent financial\n\nstatement for the Plan “showing [its] assets and liabilities.”\n\nOn July 15, 1991, through a second attorney, he wrote another\n\nletter to Dyer of Hawthorne.   In that letter, he requested a\n\n\n\n     32\n       In this letter, Hunt expressed his extreme\ndissatisfaction with the moratorium, Hawthorne, and the TAC. He\nstated among other things: (1) “I have just been informed . . .\nthat the proposed moratorium could be extensive. THIS IS\nCOMPLETELY UNSATISFACTORY! (emphasis in original) (2)\n“[Hawthorne] is administering a Plan that is already funded and\nin place. It would appear the delays are 'stalling tactics' to\nfinancially injure [those] participants who were working on\nJanuary 18.” (3) “The proposal that the [TAC] will adopt changes\nor amend the provisions of the [Plan] after [Eastern] had ceased\nbusiness is ridiculous. The Plan was established and funded long\nbefore the demise of the Airline.” (4) “The possibility of\noffering partial payments or '[Plan] loans' is completely\nunsatisfactory to me. If I want to borrow money, I go to a bank.\nBanks lend money, and retirement funds were established to\nprovide retirement benefits to their participants. If the\nvarious members need cash then they should apply to a bank, --\nbanks lend money!”\n     33\n       The first lawyer whom Hunt employed wrote the letter of\nMarch 20, 1991. The second lawyer wrote the July 15 and August\n19, 1991, letters described in the text above. The third lawyer\nemployed by Hunt brought the instant law suit and prosecuted it\nin the district court and on this appeal; a lawyer in his firm\nassisted him with this appeal.\n\n                                22\n\fstatement of “the TAC's position on his application,” copies of\n\nall amendments to the Plan affecting his benefits, an explanation\n\nif the TAC were to deny his application, and the name, address,\n\nand the forms necessary to file a claim with the Pension Dispute\n\nBoard if the TAC decided not to pay his lump sum.   Hunt also sent\n\na copy of this letter to the then-chairman of the TAC.    Finally,\n\non August 19, 1991, the same attorney wrote on Hunt's behalf to\n\nO'Connor to request copies of the “amendments to the Plan,” an\n\nexplanation of whether the TAC “had the right to amend the\n\n[Plan],” and a statement disclosing the number of applications\n\nfor lump-sum benefits filed since January 18, 1991.34    Hunt\n\ncomplains that none of his letters were answered.\n\n\n\n                               B.\n\n     On February 21, 1992, Hunt filed a complaint in the United\n\nStates District Court for the Northern District of Florida\n\nagainst the following parties: Eastern, ALPA, Hawthorne, Charles\n\nH. Copeland as chairman of the TAC, and O’Connor as partner and\n\n\n\n     34\n       On August 23, 1991, in response to a purported “request”\nby his Congressman, Hunt sent a letter to Mr. Stephen Mayle of\nthe Office of Filings, Information, and Consumer Services of the\nUnited States Securities and Exchange Commission. He made, inter\nalia, the following statements: (1) “I believe Mr. Dyer [of\nHawthorne] and the [TAC], which is packed with [ALPA]\n[r]epresentatives, are trying to prevent these lump sum payouts\nby arbitrarily modifying the retirement agreements so as to\nprevent the retiree from moving his account to other fund\nmanagers or IRA retirement programs of their choice.” (2) “I\nrequest your expeditious assistance in investigating Mr. Dyer's\nactivities as the Fund Manager to determine if he is in violation\nof Security and Exchange Commission Rules relating to investment\nfund mangers and request your prompt reply regarding your\nfindings in this matter.”\n\n                               23\n\fagent for the O’Connor law firm.      The complaint was a typical\n\n“shotgun” pleading.35   With the exception of Count I, Hunt made\n\nonly general references to “ERISA,” failing to indicate which\n\nprovision of the statute served as his basis for relief.\n\n     The complaint contained six counts or causes of action.\n\nEach incorporated the allegations, mostly factual, set out in the\n\nfirst twenty-four paragraphs of the complaint.      In those\n\nparagraphs, Hunt made essentially the following allegations:\n\n     he was a participant in the Plan;\n\n     on February 5, 1991, he mailed to the Plan administrator’s\n     (Eastern’s) Pension and Insurance Department a “Notice of\n     Retirement Status, electing a lump sum payout of his\n     benefits under the [Plan], effective on his early retirement\n     date of March 1, 1991\";\n\n     he inquired of Hawthorne on March 15, 1991, May 3, 1991, and\n     May 7, 1991 as to when he would receive his lump-sum payment\n     for his accrued benefit;\n\n\n\n     35\n       See, e.g., Ebrahimi v.

The court denied his motion with leave to\nfile an amended complaint that did not suffer from “some of the\nsame infirmities contained in his original complaint.” Hunt’s\nattorney thereafter filed an amended complaint, but it\nconstituted no improvement over his original pleading.\nUnfortunately, rather than striking the amended complaint from\nthe record, the court accepted it. As a result, Hunt’s claims\nremained ambiguous and in part inconsistent, the issues were not\nproperly delineated, and the trial yielded the erroneous decision\nwe set aside today.\n\n                                 24\n\f     Hawthorne replied that he would be paid between June 15,\n     1991, and June 30, 1991;\n\n     the Plan administrator had not paid his benefit because a\n     moratorium had been placed on the payment of lump-sum\n     benefits;\n\n     the “moratorium resulted from resolutions rendered by ALPA”;\n     and\n\n     he retained counsel in order to obtain his lump-sum\n     benefit.36\n\n     Count I of the complaint, titled “Failure to Provide\n\nInformation,” alleged that the defendants’ failure “to respond\n\nwithin 30 days to repeated written requests made by Hunt since\n\nMarch 20, 1991, as required by 29 U.S.C. § 1132(c)(1)(B),”\n\nrendered the defendants “liable to Hunt in an amount up to $100\n\nper day from the date of this failure to respond pursuant to\n\n[section] 1132(c)(1)(B).”   Accordingly, Hunt requested “judgment\n\nagainst Defendants for the applicable penalty and damages, . . .\n\nsuch further relief as the court deems appropriate and . . .\n\nprejudgment interest, costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees.”\n\n     Count II, titled “Action to Enforce Rights under [Plan],”\n\nalleged that Hunt had properly submitted his request for a lump-\n\nsum benefit; that he was entitled to the benefit; and that the\n\n“Defendants have failed to pay or direct payment of said benefits\n\nand have failed to provide any disposition of Hunt’s claim.”\n\nAccordingly, Hunt asked the court to “enter an order requiring\n\n\n\n\n     36\n       Hunt also alleged that he “relied on [Hawthorne’s]\nrepresentations [that he would receive his benefits between June\n15 and 30, 1991] and on the terms of the Plan in establishing his\nbusiness and activities following his retirement [from Eastern].”\n\n                                25\n\fDefendants to pay Hunt his benefits and award to him prejudgment\n\ninterest, costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees.”\n\n     Count III, titled “Breach of Fiduciary Duty,” alleged in\n\npertinent part:\n\n     the defendants were fiduciaries under ERISA;\n\n     “ALPA has a duty not to interfere with Hunt’s interest”;\n\n     “[t]he value of Hunt’s [Plan] account continues to decrease\n     since his effective retirement date”;\n\n     the defendants “willfully and wantonly breached their\n     fiduciary duty to Hunt by failing to pay [his lump-sum\n     benefit], by failing to respond to Hunt’s requests for\n     information, by interfering with Hunt’s rights to [his\n     benefit], and by failing to discharge their duties solely in\n     the interest of the participants for the exclusive purpose\n     of providing benefits in accordance with the [Plan]\n     documents”;\n\n     the decision to impose the moratorium on lump-sum benefits\n     was “arbitrary and capricious, [was] contrary to the terms\n     of the [Plan] and [was] contrary to law”; and\n\n     “[a]s a result of Defendants’ breach of the fiduciary\n     duties, Hunt has been damaged by failing to receive his lump\n     sum payout and the resulting payment of increased interest\n     expense for loans obtained pending payment.”\n\nAccordingly, Hunt demanded “compensatory and punitive damages\n\nagainst Defendants jointly and severally and request[ed] entry of\n\nan order awarding to him prejudgment interest, costs and\n\nreasonable attorneys’ fees.”\n\n     Count IV, titled “Recovery of Benefits,” alleged that “Hunt\n\nhas been damaged by Defendants’ failure to pay Hunt the benefits\n\nto which he is entitled under the [Plan].”   Accordingly, Hunt\n\ndemanded “judgment against Defendants jointly and severally for\n\npayment of his benefits under the [Plan], plus prejudgment\n\ninterest, costs and attorneys’ fees.”\n\n\n                               26\n\f     Count V, titled “Estoppel,” alleged in pertinent part:\n\n     “Defendants represented to Hunt that he was fully vested,\n     that the [Plan] was fully funded, and that his benefits\n     would be paid before June 30, 1991\";\n\n     “Hunt relied on the terms of the [Plan] and on the\n     representation of Defendants in determining his retirement\n     date and in establishing his business plan and financial\n     affairs upon retirement”; and\n\n     “Defendants should be estopped to deny payment and to refuse\n     to process payment to Hunt.”\n\nAccordingly, Hunt demanded “judgment against Defendants jointly\n\nand severally for payment of his benefits under the [Plan], plus\n\nprejudgment interest, costs and attorneys’ fees.”\n\n     Count VI, titled “Declaratory Judgment,” alleged that the\n\ndefendants “failure to pay to Hunt the benefits to which he is\n\nentitled as set forth in the [Plan] have raised dispute regarding\n\nHunt’s entitlement (right) to immediate payment of the [Plan]\n\nbenefits under the terms of the [Plan] and ERISA” and that\n\n“Chapter 86 Fla. Stat.[] provides that such rights may be\n\ndetermined by the court.”    Accordingly, Hunt requested that “this\n\ncourt enter an order declaring his right to payment of his lump\n\nsum [Plan] benefits under the terms of the [Plan] and pursuant to\n\nERISA and awarding to Hunt costs of this proceeding, including\n\nreasonable attorneys’ fees.”\n\n     The defendants, proceeding individually, responded to Hunt’s\n\ncomplaint.    Hawthorne and the Bankruptcy Trustee, who appeared\n\nfor Eastern, filed answers that denied liability and included the\n\naffirmative defense that the complaint failed to state a claim\n\nfor relief.   The remaining defendants, with the exception of\n\nCopeland, moved to dismiss the complaint under Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n                                 27\n\f12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim for relief;37 Copeland\n\nmoved for dismissal on the ground that Hunt had not served him\n\nwith process as required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(j).38   Because Hunt\n\nhad “demonstrated neither good reason for Copeland’s continued\n\npresence in this lawsuit nor good cause for the lack of timely\n\nservice upon Copeland,” the court dismissed Copeland from the\n\ncase.39\n\n     Before the court could address the question whether the\n\ncomplaint stated a claim for relief against any of the\n\ndefendants, the Bankruptcy Trustee moved the district court on\n\nAugust 6, 1992, for summary judgment on the grounds, among\n\nothers, that Eastern was not a fiduciary under the Plan because\n\nits duties were purely ministerial; that Eastern lacked\n\ndiscretion to impose the moratorium; and that the moratorium was\n\nimposed at the TAC’s direction.    Although the Plan contained no\n\nprovision requiring Eastern to accept the TAC’s decisions as\n\nbinding, Eastern contended that it “had no choice but to abide\n\nby” the TAC’s decision to impose a moratorium on the payment of\n\n\n     37\n       ALPA filed alternative motions to dismiss and for summary\njudgment.\n     38\n       Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(j), now Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m), provided\nin pertinent part:\n\n     If a service of the summons and complaint is not made upon a\n     defendant within 120 days after the filing of the complaint\n     and the party on whose behalf such service was required\n     cannot show good cause why such service was not made within\n     that period, the action shall be dismissed as to that\n     defendant without prejudice upon the court’s own initiative\n     with notice to such party or upon motion.\n     39\n       The district court issued its order dismissing Copeland\nfrom the case on January 4, 1993.\n\n                                  28\n\flump-sum benefits.   Finally, Eastern contended that “its sole\n\nobligation in the retirement benefits process is limited to\n\ndetermining eligibility, here whether an applicant meets the age\n\ncriteria.”   “Once this is done,” Eastern argued, “[it] has no\n\nrole in deciding whether to pay an eligible participant benefits,\n\nwhat benefits an eligible participant is entitled to, or how\n\nthose benefits will be distributed” (emphasis in original).\n\n     On October 1, 1992, while this motion for summary judgment\n\nand the Rule 12(b)(6) motions to dismiss were still pending, the\n\nBankruptcy Trustee and ALPA jointly moved the bankruptcy court\n\nfor the entry of an order pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 363 approving\n\nthe Document 91C amendment to the Plan.   See supra part I.D.\n\nTheir motion advised the bankruptcy court of the following:\n\n          On July 27, 1992, Eastern and ALPA entered into a\n     letter of agreement to amend the [Plan], conditioned on the\n     approval of this Court. Under the agreement, designated as\n     ‘Document 91C’, the [Plan] would be amended to provide . . .\n     for the segregation of the assets of the [Plan] into liquid\n     and illiquid segments, and would modify the distribution of\n     lump-sum benefits under the [Plan].\n\n          Under Document 91C, Eastern would remain both the\n     'Sponsor' and the 'Administrator' of the [Plan] for purposes\n     of [ERISA]. Eastern and ALPA have been told that one or\n     more groups object to Document 91C, and may file suit\n     challenging its implementation. Because Eastern’s\n     ministerial role in the [Plan] is a continuing obligation of\n     the estate, and to provide a single forum to consider the\n     objections to Document 91C, the [Bankruptcy] Trustee and\n     ALPA hereby jointly seek an Order from this Court approving\n     Document 91C under its authority to approve contracts made\n     by the [Bankruptcy] Trustee other than in the ordinary\n     course of business. See 11 U.S.C. § 363.\n\n     On October 26, 1992, Hunt, acting through his attorney in\n\nthe instant case, filed with the bankruptcy court an “Objection\n\nto Joint Motion for Entry of Order Approving Amendment to\n\n\n                                29\n\f[Plan].”   The essence of his objection was that “[t]he movants\n\nhave failed to provide any authority which would permit amendment\n\nof the [Plan] in such a manner that would alter or adversely\n\nimpact Hunt’s ability to receive a lump sum payment upon his\n\nretirement.”   According to Hunt, section 13.1 of the Plan\n\nprecluded any amendment that would “adversely affect the\n\nretirement benefits provided to the participant at the time of\n\nthe modification.”   Alternatively, Hunt had “no objection to any\n\namendment that excepts or exempts him, or that otherwise permits\n\nhim to receive his lump sum payout.”   Finally, Hunt contended\n\nthat the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction over the\n\nadministration of the Plan because “Eastern’s involvement in the\n\n[Plan], according to its own representations, is merely\n\nministerial.   The motion seeks to elevate and escalate Eastern’s\n\ninvolvement in administering the Plan without providing plan\n\nparticipants with any means of participating in Eastern’s\n\nadministration.”\n\n     On November 13, 1992, the bankruptcy court held a hearing on\n\nthe Bankruptcy Trustee’s and ALPA’s joint motion for approval of\n\nthe Document 91C amendment to the Plan.   In addressing objections\n\nof Plan participants such as Hunt, the court stated the\n\nfollowing:\n\n          It is clear from this record that the objections are\n     not well-founded. The record does support the relief that\n     has been requested, which does give equitable treatment to\n     inherent competing interests to the [Plan]. In any\n     situation such as this there are always competing interests.\n     And it is clear from this record that the proposal is\n     equitable.\n\n\n\n                                30\n\fThe bankruptcy court granted the joint motion.    According to the\n\nBankruptcy Trustee, neither Hunt nor any other objector appealed\n\nthis ruling.\n\n     On December 4, 1992, following the bankruptcy court’s\n\napproval of the Document 91C amendment to the lump-sum benefit\n\nprovision of the Plan, Hunt moved the district court for leave to\n\nfile an amended complaint.   The Bankruptcy Trustee, ALPA, and\n\nHawthorne opposed Hunt’s motion in separate filings.40    The\n\nBankruptcy Trustee and Hawthorne argued that Hunt’s motion should\n\nbe denied on the ground that the bankruptcy court’s rejection of\n\nHunt’s objection to the approval of the Document 91C amendment\n\nbarred his claim for a lump-sum benefit.    The Bankruptcy Trustee\n\nalso represented that Hunt “had a full opportunity to address his\n\nconcerns before the bankruptcy court.    Having failed in his\n\nefforts before the bankruptcy court, he [was] barred under the\n\ndoctrine of res judicata from collaterally attacking Document 91C\n\nbefore this [District] Court.”41    ALPA objected to Hunt’s\n\nproposed amended complaint on the ground that the claims Hunt\n\nproposed to assert against it were frivolous.\n\n     On February 1, 1993, the district court disposed of three of\n\nthe pending motions.   The first two were ALPA’s alternative\n\nmotions to dismiss Hunt’s complaint for failure to state a claim\n\n\n\n     40\n       Defendants Copeland and O’Connor did not respond to\nHunt’s motion.\n     41\n       According to the Bankruptcy Trustee, the bankruptcy court\nheard and rejected Hunt’s objection to the approval of the\nDocument 91C amendment on November 13, 1992, and Hunt did not\nappeal this ruling. Hunt did not contest this representation.\n\n                                   31\n\ffor relief and for summary judgment.   The court granted both\n\nmotions.   It concluded that ALPA was not an administrator of the\n\nPlan and that Hunt's breach of fiduciary duty claim was\n\nimproperly asserted; ALPA, therefore, could not have been held\n\nliable for any of the relief Hunt sought in Counts I through IV.\n\nThe court also rejected Hunt’s Count V estoppel claim because the\n\ncomplaint failed to allege that Hunt had relied on a\n\nrepresentation made by ALPA.\n\n     The third motion disposed of was Hunt’s motion for leave to\n\nfile an amended complaint.   The court denied that motion “because\n\n. . . [the amended complaint Hunt tendered with his motion]\n\nsuffer[ed] from some of the same infirmities contained in his\n\noriginal complaint.”   The court did not specify the infirmities\n\nin Hunt’s original complaint; whatever they were, the court gave\n\nHunt twenty-two days to cure them and to “file an appropriate\n\namended complaint.”\n\n\n\n                                C.\n\n     On February 24, 1993, Hunt filed an amended complaint.\n\nWithout obtaining leave of court as required by Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n21, Hunt dropped from the case four of the defendants named in\n\nhis original complaint: Eastern, ALPA, Copeland, and O’Connor.42\n\n\n     42\n       Fed. R. Civ. P. 21, “Misjoinder and Non-Joinder of\nParties,” provides in pertinent part: “Parties may be dropped or\nadded by order of the court on motion of any party or of its own\ninitiative at any stage of the action and on such terms as are\njust.” A plaintiff who has been given leave to file an amended\ncomplaint may drop a defendant from the case without obtaining a\nRule 21 order if the defendant has not responded to the original\ncomplaint with an answer. See generally 3 Moore’s Federal\n\n                                32\n\fHe replaced them with two new defendants, the TAC and the Plan,\n\nwhich joined Hawthorne as the defendants in the case.   The\n\nBankruptcy Trustee subsequently learned that Hunt had dropped\n\nEastern from the case, and on April 30, 1993, it obtained from\n\nHunt and filed with the court a stipulation that recited:\n\n          Pursuant to Rule 41(a)(1)(ii) of the Federal Rules of\n     Civil Procedure, plaintiff . . . Hunt and defendant . . .\n     Eastern . . . hereby agree and stipulate that the above\n     captioned action shall be and hereby is dismissed with\n     prejudice as to Eastern, each party to bear its own costs.43\n\n     Hunt’s amended complaint contained seven counts.   With the\n\nminor exceptions set out in the margin, the first six counts of\n\nthe amended complaint simply replicated the allegations and\n\nprayers for relief contained in the original complaint. For\n\nexample, as before, Count I was titled “Failure to Provide\n\n\n\nPractice, §§ 15.10, 15.11 (3d ed. 1997); 4 Moore’s Federal\nPractice, § 21.02[5][b] (3d ed. 1997) (discussing the\ninterrelationship of Rules 15 and 21 of the Federal Rules of\nCivil Procedure). ALPA and O’Connor did not answer Hunt’s\noriginal complaint; ALPA filed alternative motions to dismiss and\nfor summary judgment, and O’Connor filed a motion to dismiss.\nHunt, therefore, was not required to file a Rule 21 motion and\nobtain an order dismissing those defendants from the case.\nEastern, however, answered Hunt’s original complaint;\nconsequently, Hunt could not drop Eastern from the case without\nmoving the court pursuant to Rule 21 for an order dismissing\nEastern “on such terms as are just.” Hunt was free, however, to\nobtain Eastern’s dismissal from the case by filing with the court\na stipulation under Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(1)(ii). As we observe\nabove and in part III.B, infra, Hunt eventually followed this\nroute, obtaining Eastern’s dismissal by entering into a\nstipulation providing for the dismissal of his claims against\nEastern with prejudice.\n     We note that Hunt did not move the court pursuant to Rule 21\nto add the TAC and Plan as defendants. Neither party objected to\nbeing added, and thus the matter is not an issue here.\n     43\n       The Bankruptcy Trustee's attorney and Hunt's attorney\nsigned the stipulation on April 22, 1993, and April 29, 1993,\nrespectively.\n\n                               33\n\fInformation”; Count II was titled “Action to Enforce Rights under\n\n[Plan]”; Count III was titled “Breach of Fiduciary Duty”; Count\n\nIV was titled “Recovery of Benefits”; Count V was titled\n\n“Estoppel”; and Count VI was titled “Declaratory Judgment.”44\n\n\n     44\n       The principal difference between the two complaints was\nthat instead of seeking recovery from the parties named as\ndefendants in the original complaint, the counts of the amended\ncomplaint sought relief only from the defendants named in the\namended complaint. Other than this difference, the “amended”\nCount I was an exact duplicate of the original Count I. Count II\nadded the following allegation, which was implicit in the\nallegations of the original Count II: “These defendants have\nimproperly, and without authority, interfered with Hunt’s\nattempts to receive payment through the imposition of a\nmoratorium, or modification and amendment of the [Plan].”\n     Count III, the breach of fiduciary duty claim, added the\nallegations listed below in an attempt to circumvent the\ndismissal of this claim on the ground that an individual plan\nparticipant lacks standing under ERISA to sue a plan fiduciary\nfor money damages. That Hunt lacked standing as a plan\nparticipant to bring a breach of fiduciary duty claim against the\nTAC had previously been brought to the district court’s\nattention, and the court had informed his attorney that Hunt\ncould not bring the claim for his own benefit, as opposed to the\nbenefit of all participants. As Hunt’s attorney well knew, the\nright to sue for breach of fiduciary duty belonged to all of the\nplan’s participants as a group. See Massachusetts Mut. Life.\nIns. Co. v.

In an effort to shore up the original\nCount III and persuade the district court to accord him standing\nfor the breach of fiduciary claim, Hunt alleged:\n\n          The [Plan] itself is effectively precluded from\n     challenging the fiduciary duties of these defendants in that\n     these defendants are inextricably tied to the [Plan] itself\n     through their roles, activities, insured interests and\n     administration of the [Plan]. Hunt has no other recourse\n     for the actions of these fiduciaries with regard to his\n     interest in the [Plan].\n\n          Defendants have willfully and wantonly breached their\n     fiduciary duty to Hunt and to the [Plan] itself, by failing\n     to pay [Plan] benefits to Hunt, by failing to respond to\n     Hunt’s requests for information, by interfering with Hunt’s\n     rights to these monies, and by failing to discharge their\n     duties solely in the interest of the participants for the\n\n                               34\n\f     In the original complaint, twenty-four paragraphs preceded\n\nthe presentation of the counts.    The amended complaint had\n\ntwenty-five such paragraphs.   These paragraphs, compared to their\n\ncounterparts in the original complaint, differed materially in\n\nthe following way.   After alleging in the original complaint that\n\nthe Document 91C amendment affecting Hunt’s lump-sum benefit had\n\nbeen made by Eastern and ALPA, which were no longer parties in\n\nthe case, Hunt changed his position and alleged that the TAC,\n\nwhich “renders decisions regarding administration of the [Plan],”\n\nwas the party responsible for the moratorium rather than Eastern\n\n\nexclusive purpose of providing benefits in accordance with the\n[Plan] documents (emphasis added).\n\n     The new Count III also added this allegation, which followed\nthe replicated allegation that the moratorium was “arbitrary and\ncapricious, [was] contrary to the terms of the [Plan], and [was]\ncontrary to law”:\n\n          Alternatively, if the moratorium was imposed because of\n     the [Plan’s] inability to pay lump sum benefits to\n     retiring employees electing that option, then these\n     Defendants have breached their fiduciary duties to the\n     [Plan] and to Hunt through mismanagement and failure to\n     take such action to ensure that the [Plan] was\n     adequately funded so as to pay the lump sum benefit\n     option exercised by Hunt.\n\n     Finally, the new Count III added this language to its prayer\nfor compensatory and punitive damages: “[I]n the alternative,\n[Hunt] demands judgment for damages on behalf of the [Plan] in an\namount sufficient to fully fund the retirement benefits\nauthorized under the [Plan].”\n\n     The sole addition of note to new Count IV was the allegation\nthat the moratorium and the Document 91C amendment to the lump-\nsum benefit provision, which the bankruptcy court had approved,\nwere “arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable and [] contrary to the\nprovisions of the [Plan].” New Count V, the estoppel claim,\nadded the allegation that the defendants were estopped from\nenforcing against Hunt the moratorium or the Document 91C\namendment. Count VI, the declaratory judgment claim, was renewed\nverbatim.\n\n                                  35\n\for ALPA.   According to Hunt, Eastern and ALPA were “the only\n\nentities which can act to amend or modify the [Plan]”; he\n\ntherefore implied that the moratorium allegedly imposed by the\n\nTAC constituted an unauthorized amendment or modification of the\n\nPlan.\n\n     As noted, the amended complaint added a seventh count to\n\nthose asserted in the original complaint.    Count VII, titled\n\n“Injunctive Relief,” alleged essentially that the defendants had\n\nbreached their duty to maintain sufficient “reserves” with which\n\nto pay Hunt’s lump-sum benefit.    It alleged further that\n\n          [n]o other parties will be prejudiced by enjoining the\n     imposition of the moratorium, modification or amendment or\n     payments made thereunder beyond keeping sufficient reserves\n     for the payment of Hunt’s lump sum benefit; i.e., payments\n     would continue under the [Plan], but defendants would be\n     enjoined from so depleting the liquid portion of the fund\n     that Hunt’s total lump sum benefit could be paid.\n\nAccordingly, Hunt “demand[ed] that [the] Court enter an order\n\nenjoining payment of benefits under the [Plan] to current\n\nbeneficiaries, at least to the extent that sufficient funds are\n\nretained to pay Hunt’s lump sum benefit, interest, costs and\n\nattorney’s fees.”\n\n     The TAC and the Plan jointly moved the court to dismiss the\n\ncounts of the amended complaint on the ground that none stated a\n\nclaim for relief.45   In part, they repeated the arguments\n\npreviously addressed to the sufficiency of Hunt’s original\n\ncomplaint and advanced in the Bankruptcy Trustee’s and ALPA’s\n\nobjections to Hunt’s motion for leave to file an amended\n\n\n     45\n       The TAC and the Plan were represented by the same counsel\nthroughout this case.\n\n                                  36\n\fcomplaint.   These arguments included the claim that Hunt lacked\n\nstanding to sue for breach of fiduciary duty and that the\n\nmoratorium and the bankruptcy court's approval of the Document\n\n91C amendment foreclosed his claim.   As for Hunt’s claim seeking\n\nthe $100 per day statutory penalty, these defendants contended\n\nthat such penalties were assessable only against the\n\nadministrator of the Plan, Eastern, which had been dismissed from\n\nthe case with prejudice.   Hawthorne answered the complaint with a\n\ngeneral denial of liability.\n\n     The district court disposed of the joint motion to dismiss\n\nthe amended complaint in the following manner: the court (1)\n\ndenied the motion to dismiss Count I; (2) denied the motion to\n\ndismiss Count II; (3) dismissed Count III to the extent that it\n\nsought comprehensive and punitive damages for Hunt, but held that\n\nhe had standing to sue the TAC for breach of fiduciary duty on\n\nbehalf of the Plan’s participants; (4) denied the motion to\n\ndismiss Count IV; (5) dismissed Count V after Hunt conceded that\n\nhe had no case for estoppel; (6) dismissed Count VI on the ground\n\nof ERISA preemption; and (7) denied the motion to dismiss Count\n\nVII, although the court was unable to discern -- from what it\n\ndescribed as an “inartfully” drafted pleading -- whether Hunt\n\nstated a claim for relief.\n\n     Following these rulings, the TAC and the Plan answered the\n\namended complaint, denying liability, and then jointly moved for\n\nsummary judgment.   Their motion essentially restated the\n\narguments presented in their motion to dismiss.   Hawthorne also\n\nmoved for summary judgment.    It contended, among other things,\n\n                                 37\n\fthat Hunt’s claim for the lump-sum benefit (Counts II and IV)\n\ncould be brought only against the Plan and a person or entity,\n\nsuch as the Plan administrator, possessing the authority to order\n\nthe payment of his benefit.   Hawthorne argued that it had no such\n\nauthority and, thus, could not provide the relief sought.       In\n\naddition, Hawthorne contended that it could not be held liable\n\nfor breach of fiduciary duty (Count III) because the Plan, the\n\nappropriate plaintiff for such a cause of action, was not injured\n\nby the failure to pay Hunt his lump-sum benefit.\n\n     The court deferred ruling on these motions for summary\n\njudgment until the morning that the trial of the case began.         In\n\nthe meantime, Hawthorne settled with Hunt and agreed to the entry\n\nof judgment in favor of Hunt on Count I in the sum of $10,000;\n\nall other counts against Hawthorne were to be dismissed with\n\nprejudice.   The court denied the only motion that was pending,\n\nthe TAC’s and the Plan’s motion for summary judgment, and the\n\ntrial commenced.\n\n\n\n                                D.\n\n     The case was tried to the court.    Five counts from the\n\namended complaint were at issue:     Hunt’s claim for the $100 per\n\nday statutory penalty under Count I; his identical claims under\n\nCounts II and IV seeking judgment in the amount of the lump-sum\n\nbenefit, prejudgment interest, costs, and attorneys’ fees; his\n\nclaim on behalf of the Plan participants for breach of fiduciary\n\nduty under Count III; and his request that the TAC and the Plan\n\n\n\n                                38\n\fbe enjoined from paying benefits to other participants until they\n\nsatisfied his claim under Count VII.\n\n     After considering the evidence adduced by the parties, the\n\ncourt, in an “Order Directing Entry of Judgment,” held as\n\nfollows:\n\n     Count I.   The court found that only designated plan\n\nadministrators are subject to the $100 penalty imposed by ERISA\n\n§ 502(c), 29 U.S.C. § 1132(c), for failing to respond to a plan-\n\nparticipant's requests for information as required by the\n\nstatute.   Because Hunt had neither established that the TAC was\n\nthe Plan administrator nor that it had assumed the “information-\n\nproviding function” of the administrator, the TAC could not be\n\nheld liable under section 502(c).\n\n     Counts II and IV.    The court first found that Hunt had\n\nproperly applied for the lump-sum benefit and that his\n\napplication had been denied because of the moratorium the TAC had\n\n“imposed” unilaterally.   The TAC had done so because it concluded\n\nthat a “moratorium was needed to maintain the financial integrity\n\nof the [Plan] and to protect the economic interests of all plan\n\nparticipants and beneficiaries.”      The court then turned to the\n\nquestion whether the TAC had the authority to impose the\n\nmoratorium for such purpose.   Although the Plan did not expressly\n\ngive the TAC such authority, the court assumed that the common\n\nlaw of trusts did so.    Having made that determination, the court\n\naddressed the question whether Hunt or the TAC had the burden of\n\nproof regarding the need for the moratorium: it concluded that\n\nthe TAC had the burden.\n\n                                 39\n\f     With this ruling in hand, the court considered whether the\n\nTAC’s proof established that “its action was both prudent and\n\nnecessary to protect the interests of all plan participants and\n\ntheir beneficiaries.”   The court held that although the\n\nmoratorium may have been justified, the TAC’s proof was\n\ninsufficient to carry the day.   The court therefore gave Hunt\n\njudgment on Counts II and IV in the sum of $352,748.74 plus\n\ncosts.\n\n     Count III.   The court’s findings on this claim are\n\nambiguous.   Hunt had alleged that “if the moratorium was imposed\n\n[by the TAC] because of the [Plan’s] inability to pay lump sum\n\nbenefits to retiring employees electing that option, then these\n\nDefendants have breached their fiduciary duties to the [Plan] and\n\nto Hunt through mismanagement and failure to take such action to\n\nensure that the [Plan] was adequately funded so as to pay the\n\nlump sum benefit option exercised by Hunt.”   See supra note 44.\n\nIn other words, the TAC breached its fiduciary duty to the Plan’s\n\nparticipants, and therefore to Hunt, by imposing the moratorium\n\nbecause of its inability to pay the lump-sum benefits.\n\n     The court found no such breach:   “Hunt submitted neither\n\nevidence of mismanagement nor -- assuming, for the sake of\n\nargument, that he proved a breach of fiduciary duty -- evidence\n\nfrom which this court could fashion a remedy.   Hunt having thus\n\nfailed to satisfy his burden of proof on Count III, judgment will\n\nbe entered in favor of the defendants.”\n\n     Therefore, under the district court's analysis, whether the\n\nTAC had breached its fiduciary duty to the Plan participants,\n\n                                 40\n\fincluding Hunt, by imposing the moratorium turned on which party\n\nhad the burden of proof.     On Counts II and IV, the court held\n\nthat the TAC had the burden but failed to sustain it by showing\n\nthat prudence required that a moratorium be imposed.      On Count\n\nIII, the court held that Hunt had the burden of proof but failed\n\nto show that the TAC had acted imprudently in imposing the\n\nmoratorium.46\n\n     The district court’s “Order Directing Entry of Judgment”\n\nmakes no mention of the remaining count (Count VII).      After\n\ndisposing of the other counts in the amended complaint by number,\n\nincluding Counts V and VI which were dismissed from the case\n\nprior to trial, the court instructed the clerk of court in\n\nparagraph four of its order (“paragraph 4\") how judgment should\n\nbe entered:     “4. On the remaining counts [i.e., Counts II, IV,\n\nand VII], the clerk shall enter judgment in favor of Harry L.\n\nHunt in the amount of $352,748.74 plus costs.      The judgment shall\n\nbe paid from the [Plan] [F]und.”       We read this language, and the\n\nfinal judgment entered by the clerk, as disposing of Count VII in\n\n\n\n\n     46\n       How the court could assume, “for sake of argument, that\n[Hunt] proved a breach of fiduciary duty” and then deny him\nrelief on Count III is a question that the court’s dispositive\norder does not answer.\n\n                                  41\n\ffavor of Hunt,47 although the court did not grant the injunctive\n\nrelief the count requested.48\n\n     Following the entry of final judgment, the TAC and the Plan\n\nappealed the district court’s judgment on Counts II and IV.   Hunt\n\ncross-appealed the court’s judgment on Count I but not Count III.\n\nFor the reasons that follow, we reverse the court’s judgment on\n\nCounts II and IV, and affirm as to Count I.\n\n\n\n                                III.\n\n     Paragraph 4 of the district court’s “Order Directing Entry\n\nof Judgment,” which gave Hunt judgment on Counts II, IV, and VII\n\nfor the lump-sum benefit, presents several threshold issues that\n\nmust be resolved before we can consider the merits of his claim\n\n\n     47\n       By treating the district court’s final judgment as having\nterminated Count VII of Hunt’s amended complaint, we have a final\njudgment before us that is appealable under 28 U.S.C. § 1291\nbecause the judgment has adjudicated all claims against all\nparties.

Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"582834\"><a href=\"/opinion/582834/robert-e-penton-sr-v-pompano-construction-co-inc-and-futch-leasing/\"><span class=\"volume\">963</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">321</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n321-22 (11th Cir. 1992).

In\ntheir briefs, the parties have ignored Count VII altogether; like\nthe district court, they made no mention of it. Because of our\ndisposition of Hunt’s explicit claim for benefits contained in\nCounts II and IV, Count VII falls by the wayside. That is to\nsay, we vacate the court’s judgment on Count VII and direct the\ncourt to enter judgment in favor of the TAC and the Plan on that\ncount.\n\n                                42\n\fto that benefit.   As stated previously, in paragraph 4, the court\n\ndirected the clerk to “enter judgment in favor of [Hunt] in the\n\namount of $352,748.74 plus costs.    The judgment shall be paid\n\nfrom the [Plan] [F]und.”49\n\n     The first threshold question is whether the relief granted\n\nin paragraph 4 is legal or equitable;50 that is, does the relief\n\ngranted constitute a money judgment or an in personam order\n\ndirecting the TAC or the Plan to pay Hunt a sum of money from the\n\nassets of the Plan’s Fund.   The answer to this question is\n\nimportant because, as we explain below, the relief provided in an\n\naction to recover benefits under ERISA is equitable, not legal.\n\nMore specifically, the relief consists of an order directing a\n\nperson or entity having the necessary authority under the benefit\n\nplan to pay the participant the benefit that he seeks.    Hunt\n\nsought such equitable relief in Count II of his amended\n\ncomplaint, asking the district court to enter “an order requiring\n\nDefendants to pay Hunt his benefits.”   In Count IV, Hunt sought\n\nlegal relief, demanding “judgment against Defendants . . .\n\njointly and severally for payment of his benefits.”   In Count\n\nVII, titled “Injunctive Relief,” Hunt asked the court to “enter\n\nan order enjoining payment of benefits . . . to current\n\nbeneficiaries, at least to the extent that sufficient funds are\n\nretained to pay Hunt’s lump sum benefit.”\n\n\n     49\n       We note that the final judgment entered by the clerk\nquoted this language verbatim.\n     50\n       If the relief granted in paragraph 4 is equitable, we\nhave jurisdiction to review the grant under 28 U.S.C.\n§ 1292(a)(1). See supra note 47.\n\n                                43\n\f     Nothing in the language of paragraph 4 orders the TAC to do\n\nanything.    If, however, we construe -- that is, effectively\n\nrewrite -- paragraph 4 so that it orders the TAC to pay the\n\nbenefit from the Fund,51 then we must decide whether the TAC has\n\nthe authority under the Plan to effect payment; if not, the TAC\n\ncannot provide the relief sought.     Despite its representations to\n\nthe contrary, Eastern, the Plan administrator, obviously could\n\neffect payment if ordered to do so, see supra part I.C and infra\n\npart III.B, but Hunt voluntarily dismissed it from the case with\n\nprejudice.    Nor can the Plan as an entity provide any relief; the\n\nPlan alone is simply a written instrument executed by Eastern and\n\nALPA.\n\n     We turn now to these issues, taking them up in order.\n\n\n\n                                 A.\n\n     Section 502(a)(1)(B) of ERISA provides that “[a] civil\n\naction may be brought by a participant or beneficiary . . . to\n\nrecover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan, to\n\nenforce his rights under the terms of the plan, or to clarify his\n\nrights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.\"    29\n\nU.S.C. § 1132(a)(1)(B).    On its face, this language does not\n\n\n\n     51\n       In his original complaint, of course, Hunt took the\nposition that Eastern, as Plan administrator, was the party\nhaving the authority to effect payment of the benefit he is\nseeking; this was his reason for naming Eastern as a party\ndefendant in his claims to recover his lump-sum benefit. Since\neliminating Eastern from his amended complaint as a party\ndefendant, Hunt has taken the position that the TAC, not Eastern,\nis the entity having the authority to effect payment of the\nbenefit.\n\n                                 44\n\findicate whether a participant seeking to recover retirement\n\nbenefits may obtain legal or equitable relief.

This position is\n\nconsistent with our view that participants suing under section\n\n502(a)(1)(B) are not entitled to a jury trial.   In Blake v.\n\nUnionmut. Stock Life Ins. Co. of Amer., we reasoned:\n\n     The nature of an action under section 502(a)(1)(B) is for\n     the enforcement of the ERISA plan. Although the plaintiffs\n     assert that they are claiming money damages, in effect they\n     are claiming the benefits they are allegedly entitled to\n     under the plan. Although . . . a money judgment would\n     satisfy their demands, . . . only an order for continuing\n     benefits would be sufficient. This is traditionally\n     equitable relief . . . .\n\n\n\n\n     52\n       In Pane, the Third Circuit aptly captured the distinction\nbetween legal and equitable relief in the context of an action\nbrought under section 502(a)(1)(B) of ERISA: “A legal remedy\nwould result in a money judgment enforceable only by execution,\nor other conventional common law process such as ejectment or\nreplevin. An equitable remedy would result in a judgment\nenforceable in personam and by contempt.” 868 F.2d at 635-36.\n\n                                45\n\f</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"543821\"><a href=\"/opinion/543821/marlowe-blake-and-pam-blake-v-unionmutual-stock-life-ins-co-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">906</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1525</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1526 (11th Cir. 1990).   This view accords with the\n\nmajority of circuits that have considered this issue.53   We\n\ntherefore hold that Hunt's claim for legal relief (i.e., a money\n\njudgment) under section 502(a)(1)(B) fails to state a claim.\n\nAccordingly, we dismiss Count IV of Hunt's amended complaint,\n\nleaving only his claim for equitable relief in Count II to\n\nrecover his lump-sum benefit.\n\n     Given the equitable nature of Hunt's recovery-of-benefits\n\nclaim under ERISA, we also find that an in personam order\n\nenjoining the payment of benefits under section 502(a)(1)(B) must\n\nbe directed to a person or entity other than the plan itself.\n\nWhile ERISA § 502(d)(1), 29 U.S.C. § 1132(d)(1), does state that\n\n“[a]n employee benefit plan may sue or be sued . . . as an\n\nentity,” nothing in ERISA permits the district court to issue an\n\n\n     53\n       See Wardle v.

We therefore reject the notion that an injunctive order\n\nto pay benefits under section 502(a)(1)(B) of ERISA can issue\n\nsolely against an ERISA plan as an entity.\n\n\n\n                                  B.\n\n     We next examine the district court's ruling in paragraph 4\n\nthat “the clerk shall enter judgment in favor of Harry L. Hunt\n\n[on Counts II, IV, and VII]” and that “[t]he judgment shall be\n\npaid from the [Plan] fund.”    Because an injunctive order cannot\n\nissue against the Plan itself, we assume that we have discretion\n\nto construe -- i.e., effectively rewrite -- paragraph 4 so that\n\nit directs the TAC to pay Hunt the lump-sum benefit from the\n\nFund.\n\n\n\n\n        54\n       ERISA § 502(d)(2) states that “[a]ny money judgment . . .\nagainst an employee benefit plan shall be enforceable only\nagainst the plan as an entity and shall not be enforceable\nagainst any other person unless liability against such person is\nestablished in his individual capacity.” 29 U.S.C. § 1132(d)(2).\nThis provision contemplates legal relief and does not apply to an\naction to recover benefits under section 502(a)(1)(B).\n\n                                  47\n\f     Our review of the record and the Plan,55 however, makes\n\nclear that the TAC has no authority under the Plan to issue or\n\ndeny payment of a lump-sum benefit to a participant.    Rather, the\n\nTAC has limited powers under the Plan56 and plays no role in the\n\nprocess of reviewing applications for retirement benefits.\n\nUnlike Eastern, the TAC's authority is primarily limited to the\n\nmanagement and supervision of the Fund's assets.   Its \"overall\n\nsupervisory responsibility” is restricted to the “administrative\n\nfunctions of the Fund,” see § 2.13(b)(i) (“Fund Administration”),\n\nand its duty to the Plan is limited “to maintain[ing]\n\nsurveillance over the status and administration of the Plan and\n\nthe [Fund],\" see § 10.2(b) (“Rights and Duties of the [TAC]”).\n\n     In addition, as discussed in part I.B, supra, the TAC must\n\nexercise its limited powers in a manner consistent with its\n\nobligations to ALPA.   For example, before selecting and replacing\n\ninvestment advisors and trustees, the TAC must notify ALPA of its\n\nplanned course of action and give ALPA an opportunity to respond.\n\nSee § 2.7(b) (“Trust Agreement and Trustee”).   Similarly, before\n\ngiving any notice or instruction to a trustee of the Fund, the\n\nTAC must serve a copy of the trust direction on ALPA and give it\n\nfifteen days to object to the TAC's proposed direction.   See §\n\n\n     55\n       Unless otherwise specified, the term “Plan” in part III\nrefers to the written instrument in effect at the time Hunt's\napplication was “approved” on April 22, 1991 (i.e., Documents 91\nand 91A).\n     56\n       We review the relevant provisions of the Plan here\nbecause a named fiduciary must discharge its duties “in\naccordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan\ninsofar as such documents and instruments are consistent with\n[ERISA].” ERISA § 404(a)(1)(D), 29 U.S.C. § 1104(a)(1)(D).\n\n                                48\n\f2.8 (“Directions to Trustee(s)).     In addition, the TAC must\n\n“regularly and periodically suppl[y]” information to ALPA about\n\ntransactional detail, cash flow reports, investment status,\n\ndocumentation and Fund performance,” see § 2.11 (“Information and\n\nAccountability”), and furnish to ALPA and Plan participants\n\nreports about the TAC's “functions, actions, and decisions . . .\n\nas are reasonable and appropriate,” see § 10.2(c).\n\n     In stark contrast, the plain language of the Plan gives\n\nEastern broad discretion as administrator to make decisions for\n\nthe Plan.   The Supreme Court has stated that a plan administrator\n\nhas a “statutory responsibility [under ERISA] . . . to run the\n\nplan in accordance with the currently operative, governing plan\n\ndocuments.”   Curtiss-Wright Corp. v.

Section 2.2(a) of\n\nthe Plan confers upon Eastern “those powers necessary to carry\n\nout the day to day operation of the Plan.”    Its responsibilities\n\ninclude the authority to “initially determine all questions\n\narising from the administration, interpretation, and application\n\nof the Plan pursuant to all applicable law, agreements and\n\ncontracts, and such determination shall be binding upon all\n\npersons, except as otherwise provided by law, and further\n\nprovided that each Participant shall be granted the same\n\ntreatment under similar conditions.”    Id.   The Plan also charges\n\nEastern with the responsibility for, inter alia, keeping records,\n\nsee § 2.4 (“Records”), preparing and distributing periodic Plan\n\nsummaries, see § 2.5 (“Plan Summary”), and sending to each\n\n\n\n                                49\n\fparticipant an annual statement reflecting the value of his\n\ninvestment in the Plan, see § 2.6 (“Annual Statement”).\n\n     More important, based on the record before us,57 we find\n\nthat Eastern exercises ultimate authority in determining whether\n\na participant should receive payment of his benefit.    The record\n\nreveals that Eastern plays the central role in the process of\n\nreviewing applications for benefits.    The Plan makes Eastern\n\nresponsible for providing the benefit-application forms to\n\nparticipants.   See § 12.9(a) (“Application for Benefits”).58     A\n\npilot seeking a lump-sum payment must complete the necessary\n\npaperwork and inform an Eastern management employee, the Chief\n\nPilot, of his intention to retire.    The Chief Pilot checks the\n\npilot's eligibility under the Plan, and then informs the Eastern\n\nPension and Insurance Department about the pilot's decision to\n\nretire.59   The application is then presented to the Eastern\n\nPension Administration Department, which must provide an\n\nauthorizing signature beneath a line that states:    “The above\n\n\n     57\n       As stated in part I.C and note 12, supra, the Plan does\nnot set forth the procedure for processing claims for retirement\nbenefits. This account of the claims-processing procedure is\ntaken from the affidavit and deposition of Charles Dyer of\nHawthorne and the affidavit of Brian White, who served as\nDirector of the Eastern Pension and Insurance Department. Both\naccounts of Eastern's claims-processing procedure are virtually\nidentical.\n     58\n       Section 12.9 also states that each participant “shall\n. . . furnish the Administrator with such documents, evidence,\ndata, or information in support of such application as the\nAdministrator shall consider necessary or desirable.”\n     59\n       As stated in part I.D, supra, after the moratorium began,\nthe retiring participant would contact Eastern's Pension and\nInsurance Department directly rather than go through the Chief\nPilot.\n\n                                 50\n\finformation is approved and the appropriate allocation from the\n\nPlan to provide the benefit payable is hereby authorized.”    If\n\nthe application is approved, the Eastern Pension and Insurance\n\nDepartment contacts the Plan's actuary, which determines the\n\nprecise amount of benefits to which the retiring participant is\n\nentitled.   The actuary then gives that information to the State\n\nStreet Bank & Trust, which makes the distribution to the\n\nparticipant.   Eastern is responsible for establishing and\n\nmaintaining a procedure for giving the participant written\n\nnotification if the application is denied.    See § 2.3\n\n(“Notification of Denial of Benefits”).    If there is a legal\n\ndispute as to the proper recipient of a benefit, Eastern may\n\nwithhold payment pending final determination of the proper\n\nbeneficiary.   See § 12.10 (“Beneficiary Dispute”).\n\n     The facts of this case support our reading that Eastern, not\n\nthe TAC, has the authority to order payment of retirement\n\nbenefits.   First, the record makes clear that Eastern retained\n\nits authority as administrator at all times during the events\n\ngiving rise to this litigation.    When Hunt's application was\n\n“approved” by Eastern's Pension Administration Department on\n\nApril 22, 1991, Eastern was listed in the written instrument as\n\nthe Plan administrator.60   When the Plan was amended effective\n\nJune 25, 1991, Eastern continued to serve as administrator for\n\nall aspects of the Plan, with the exception of the newly\n\nintroduced periodic-payment option and the provision for Plan\n\n\n     60\n       At this time, the Plan consisted of Document 91 and\nDocument 91A.\n\n                                  51\n\floans.    See § 6.11(f) (“Periodic Payments”), Article XV (“Plan\n\nLoans”).61    Even after the Plan was amended effective June 30,\n\n1992, with the bankruptcy court’s approval of Document 91C,\n\nEastern retained its authority as Plan administrator.\n\n     Second, the record demonstrates that Eastern, despite its\n\nrepresentations to the contrary, made the decision to honor the\n\nmoratorium and ultimately prevented the State Street Bank and\n\nTrust from issuing a lump-sum payment to Hunt.    As noted in part\n\nI.D, supra, the director of Eastern's Pension and Insurance\n\nDepartment stated that the process for reviewing benefit claims\n\nafter the shutdown “basically remained the same, except that\n\n. . . Eastern would inform Mercer [the Plan actuary] whether a\n\nparticipant had applied for benefits following shutdown, thus\n\nimplicating the lump-sum moratorium.”    By this statement, Eastern\n\neffectively admits that it ratified the imposition of the\n\nmoratorium and thus denied Hunt's application.    In essence,\n\nEastern's order to the actuary to halt the processing of Hunt's\n\napplication foreclosed the State Street Bank and Trust from\n\nissuing him a benefit check.\n\n     Furthermore, there is nothing in the record to indicate that\n\nEastern challenged the legality of the moratorium after its\n\nimposition.    Eastern's inaction is especially glaring when one\n\nconsiders that Article XIII of the Plan, titled “Modification,\n\nSuspension or Discontinuance,” vests Eastern with the exclusive\n\n\n\n\n     61\n       This version of the Plan included the amendment referred\nto as Document 91B.\n\n                                  52\n\fauthority to modify, suspend or discontinue a feature of the\n\nPlan:\n\n     Eastern expects to continue the Plan indefinitely, but\n     necessarily reserves the right to modify, suspend or\n     terminate it at any time including, but without limiting the\n     generality of the foregoing, discontinuance of the\n     contributions of Eastern under the Plan or modification,\n     suspension, or discontinuance in its entirety or with\n     respect to any feature thereof. However, any modification,\n     suspension, or discontinuance shall not adversely affect the\n     retirement, death or termination benefits already provided\n     at that time under the Plan for any Participant, contingent\n     annuitant, or beneficiary as of the date of such\n     modification, suspension, or discontinuance. In the event\n     the Plan shall be discontinued, such action shall be taken\n     as shall insure to the extent possible the satisfaction of\n     all liabilities to Participants, contingent annuitants, and\n     beneficiaries that have accrued under the Plan.\n\n§ 13.1 (“General”) (emphasis added).   Although this provision\n\nenumerates only one specific application of this subsection\n\n(i.e., the discontinuation of Eastern's contributions), the\n\nphrases “including, but without limiting the generality of the\n\nforegoing” and “with respect to any feature thereof” would\n\nencompass other scenarios, such as the suspension of the lump-sum\n\npayment option.   Thus, if Eastern wanted to challenge the TAC's\n\npurportedly “unilateral” imposition of the moratorium, the Plan\n\ncertainly gave Eastern the authority to do so.62\n\n\n     62\n       Hunt suggests that the moratorium on lump-sum payments\nwas impermissible because it was inconsistent with § 13.1's\nprovision that “any modification, suspension, or discontinuance\nshall not adversely affect the retirement, death or termination\nbenefits already provided at that time under the Plan for any\nParticipant.” We note, however, that the moratorium on lump-sum\npayments had no effect on Hunt's actual interest in the Plan --\ni.e., the total number of annuity units in his accrued benefit;\nrather, the moratorium only changed the manner in which Hunt and\nother similarly situated participants could receive their\nbenefits.\n     Given the Plan's status as a defined contribution plan, the\nvalue of a participant's interest in the Plan fluctuates with the\n\n                                53\n\f     It is clear that Eastern, not the TAC, bears ultimate\n\nresponsibility for the denial of Hunt's lump-sum benefit.    Hunt,\n\nhowever, in an obvious attempt to avoid the effect of the\n\nbankruptcy court’s approval of the Document 91C amendment,\n\nvoluntarily dismissed Eastern with prejudice as a party to this\n\naction pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(1)(ii) shortly after\n\nfiling his amended complaint.63\n\n     Nevertheless, the district court ruled in paragraph 4 of its\n\norder that the TAC possessed the authority to issue payment from\n\nthe Fund.   In so ruling, the district court implicitly rewrote\n\nthe Plan to give the TAC that power.

We therefore reject the\n\ndistrict court's sub silentio revision of the Plan which enabled\n\nthe court to direct the TAC to pay Hunt his lump-sum benefit.\n\n\n\n                                C.\n\n     Given the district court's view that the TAC denied Hunt's\n\nlump-sum benefit by issuing the moratorium, however, we will\n\nassume arguendo that the TAC could order the State Street Bank\n\nand Trust to issue Hunt payment from the Fund.    For the district\n\ncourt's theory of liability to make sense, the TAC would\n\nnecessarily have acted as de facto Plan administrator in\nEastern's stead; as discussed above, this theory is inconsistent\n\n                                55\n\fwith the Plan and clearly unsupported by the record.   Yet, even\n\nif we indulge the assumption that the TAC functioned as de facto\n\nadministrator, we remain convinced that the facts of this case\n\njustified the imposition of the moratorium and the concomitant\n\ndenial of Hunt's lump-sum benefit.64\n\n     When evaluating a plan administrator's decision to deny\n\nbenefits, a district court must first determine the appropriate\n\nstandard of review.   Firestone v. Bruch holds that “a denial of\n\nbenefits challenged under § 1132(a)(1)(B) is to be reviewed under\n\na de novo standard unless the benefit plan gives the\n\nadministrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine\n\neligibility or to construe the terms of the plan.”   </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112197\"><a href=\"/opinion/112197/firestone-tire-rubber-co-v-bruch/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">101</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n115, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112197\"><a href=\"/opinion/112197/firestone-tire-rubber-co-v-bruch/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We have\n\ninterpreted Firestone to mandate an arbitrary and capricious\n\nstandard of review, which is often used interchangeably with an\n\nabuse of discretion standard, if the administrator has\n\ndiscretionary authority to make eligibility determinations or to\n\nconstrue disputed terms of the plan.

See Firestone, 489 U.S. at\n\n115, 109 S. Ct. at 957; see also Marecek v. BellSouth Telecomm.,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"691148\"><a href=\"/opinion/691148/nancy-h-marecek-individually-and-on-behalf-of-all-persons-similarly/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">702</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 705 (11th Cir. 1995).\n\n     The arbitrary and capricious standard is the appropriate\n\nstandard of review in this case because the Plan contains express\n\nlanguage conferring discretionary authority upon the\n\nadministrator to construe its terms.   Under section 2.2(a)\n\n(“Administration”), the administrator enjoys the authority to\n\n“initially determine all questions arising from the\n\nadministration, interpretation, and application of the Plan\n\npursuant to all applicable law, agreements and contracts, and\n\nsuch determination shall be binding upon all persons, except as\n\notherwise provided by law.”   We have held that comparable\n\nlanguage is sufficient to trigger review under the arbitrary and\n\ncapricious standard.   See Jett, 890 F.2d at 1139 (“[Plan\n\nadministrator] has the exclusive right to interpret the\n\nprovisions of th[is] Plan, so its decision is conclusive and\n\nbinding.”); Guy v. Southeastern Iron Workers' Welfare Fund, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"524724\"><a href=\"/opinion/524724/james-guy-counterclaim-v-southeastern-iron-workers-welfare-fund/\"><span class=\"volume\">877</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 38-39 (11th Cir. 1989) (“[Administrator has] full power\n\nto construe the provisions of [the] Trust”).   Thus, we apply the\n\narbitrary and capricious standard of review to the TAC's\n\n“decision” as de facto administrator to deny Hunt's lump-sum\n\nbenefit.   We stress that our principal inquiry in this\n\nhypothetical situation is not whether the TAC was justified in\n\nimposing the moratorium, but whether the TAC was justified in\n\n                                57\n\fdenying Hunt's application for a lump-sum benefit.    Of course,\n\nour analysis of the latter issue necessarily implicates the\n\nformer.\n\n     Under the arbitrary and capricious standard of review, the\n\ncourt seeks “to determine whether there was a reasonable basis\n\nfor the [administrator's] decision, based upon the facts as known\n\nto the administrator at the time the decision was made.” Jett,\n\n890 F.2d at 1139.   The facts presented at trial bear out that the\n\nTAC acted reasonably in its decision as de facto administrator to\n\nimpose the moratorium on lump-sum payments.   First, the record\n\npaints an extremely bleak picture for the Plan in January 1991.\n\nIt is undisputed that the Plan was low on liquid assets as of the\n\neighteenth of that month.   Following the commencement of the\n\nChapter 11 reorganization proceeding on March 9, 1989, Eastern\n\nreduced and eventually stopped making contributions on behalf of\n\nits pilots.   Moreover, between 1986 and 1990, the amount of lump-\n\nsum payments paid to retiring pilots dramatically increased;\n\nfewer than twenty-five pilots selected another benefit option\n\nafter the lump-sum option became available in 1983.    In 1986,\n\nroughly $52,000,000 was disbursed in lump-sum payments; that\n\nnumber grew to more than $200,000,000 in 1990.65   Between January\n\n\n\n\n     65\n       The following amounts were distributed in lump-sum\npayments between 1986 and 1990: $52,091,000 (1986); $79,389,000\n(1987); $107,954,000 (1988); $181,856,000 (1989); and\n$200,540,000 (1990).\n\n                                58\n\f1 and January 18, 1991, already $38,000,000 had been disbursed as\n\nlump-sum payments.66\n\n     This paucity of liquid assets was further exacerbated by the\n\ndepressed performance of the Plan's substantial real estate\n\nholdings.   Former Citicorp president William Spencer, a member of\n\nthe TAC during the period in question, stated at trial that\n\n“[t]he real estate which comprised a sizable part of the fund was\n\nin a funk, and . . . unless some time was developed [so the real\n\nestate] could evolve, the hardships on all of the [Plan's]\n\nmembers would be very extreme.”    Another former TAC member,\n\nformer President Ford, stated in his deposition that the Plan\n\ncould not have made lump-sum payments to all retiring pilots\n\nwithout subjecting its real estate holdings to a “fire sale” at\n\nprices far below market value.    Both former TAC members agreed\n\nthat holding a fire sale of such potentially valuable assets\n\nwould have been grossly imprudent.     Hunt did not dispute the\n\nvalidity of this testimony.\n\n     Second, the terms of the Plan make clear that the\n\nadministrator owes an equal fiduciary duty to all Plan\n\nparticipants, including annuitants and those who have not elected\n\nany benefit option.    The administrator is required to treat all\n\nparticipants equally at all times in running the Plan.     See §\n\n2.2(a) (“[T]he Administrator . . . shall have those powers\n\nnecessary to carry out the day to day operation of the Plan . . .\n\nand initially determine all questions arising from the\n\n\n     66\n       At this rate, more than $60,000,000 would have been\ndisbursed in lump-sum payments in January 1991 alone.\n\n                                  59\n\fadministration, interpretation, and application of the Plan . . .\n\nprovided that each Participant shall be granted the same\n\ntreatment under similar conditions.”) (emphasis added).\n\nMoreover, as named fiduciary, the TAC bears a heavy obligation to\n\nALPA.     See supra part III.B (discussion of TAC's obligations to\n\nALPA under §§ 2.7(b), 2.8., and 2.11).\n\n     Hunt was one of approximately 2,500 pilots who were affected\n\nby Eastern's shutdown and the moratorium.      Like the hundreds of\n\nother Eastern pilots who failed to submit their benefit\n\napplications by the close of business on January 18, 1991, Hunt\n\nwas unable to take advantage of the original lump-sum option that\n\nwas in effect prior to Eastern's shutdown.\n\n     If the Plan administrator were to grant Hunt's lump-sum\n\nbenefit application, however, it would be arbitrarily favoring\n\nHunt over all of the other pilots who, like Hunt, did not submit\n\ntheir application before the imposition of the moratorium.      As a\n\nfiduciary under ERISA, the administrator owes a responsibility to\n\nadminister the plan “in accordance with the documents and\n\ninstruments governing the plan.”       ERISA § 404(a)(1)(D), 29 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1104(a)(1)(D).    The Plan plainly states that the administrator\n\nis required to discharge its duties in a manner ensuring that\n\n“each Participant shall be granted the same treatment under\n\nsimilar conditions.”     See § 2.2 (“Administration”) (emphasis\n\nadded).    Given this fiduciary responsibility, the administrator,\n\nwhen faced with Hunt's benefit application, made the reasonable\n\ndecision to treat Hunt exactly like all of the other pilots in\n\nhis position -- that is, to deny his lump-sum benefit despite its\n\n                                  60\n\f“approval” by Eastern's Pension Administration Department.\n\nTherefore, even assuming arguendo that the TAC functioned as de\n\nfacto administrator, we would find that its “denial” of Hunt's\n\nlump-sum benefit was reasonable based upon the facts known by it\n\nat that time.67   Accordingly, in this hypothetical case, the\n\nTAC's “denial” of Hunt's lump-sum benefits would pass muster\n\nunder the arbitrary and capricious standard of review.68\n\n\n\n                                IV.\n\n     Hunt cross-appeals the district court's refusal to impose a\n\nstatutory penalty on the TAC for its alleged failure to comply\n\nwith Hunt's requests for information.69   Under section 502(c) of\n\n\n     67\n       As indicated above, we have managed to locate ample\ninformation in the record to justify under the arbitrary and\ncapricious standard of review the imposition of the moratorium.\nWe would agree, however, with the district court's assessment\nthat the TAC presented its supporting evidence at trial in a\nwholly incoherent manner: “[B]ecause the [TAC's data was] either\nincomplete or not adequately explained, this court was left to\nwonder what the numbers and figures really meant.”\n     68\n       Although Hunt is not entitled to receive the total value\nof his accrued benefit in one full lump-sum payment, we assume\nthat he remains eligible to elect the modified lump-sum option\navailable under Document 91C like all other similarly situated\nEastern pilots affected by the shutdown and moratorium.\n     69\n       As stated in part II.A, supra, Hunt dispatched four\nletters allegedly in response to Eastern's February 4, 1991,\nletter to all Eastern pilots. His March 15, 1991, letter to Dyer\nof Hawthorne inquired about the status of his pension. His March\n20, 1991, letter to O'Connor requested the most current statement\nof his account and the most recent financial statement for the\nPlan “showing [its] assets and liabilities.” His July 15, 1991,\nletter to Dyer requested a statement of “the TAC's position on\nhis application,” copies of all amendments to the Plan affecting\nhis benefits, an explanation if the TAC were to deny his\napplication, and the name, address, and the forms necessary to\nfile a claim with the Pension Dispute Board if the TAC decided\nnot to pay his lump-sum benefit. This letter also was sent to\n\n                                 61\n\fERISA, an administrator who “fails or refuses to comply with a\n\nrequest for any information which such administrator is required\n\nby [ERISA] to furnish to a participant or beneficiary . . .\n\nwithin 30 days after such request may . . . be personally liable\n\nto such participant or beneficiary in the amount of up to $100 a\n\nday from the date of such failure or refusal.”    29 U.S.C. §\n\n1132(c).70    ERISA requires the administrator to provide\n\nparticipants with, inter alia, the latest updated summary plan\n\ndescription, the latest annual report, a statement to each\n\nparticipant indicating the total benefits accrued, and “other\n\ninstruments under which the plan is established or operated.”71\n\nSee ERISA §§ 104(b)(4), 105(a)(1), 29 U.S.C. §§ 1024(b)(4),\n\n1025(a)(1).    The imposition of this penalty is committed to the\n\ndistrict court's discretion.    ERISA § 502(c), 29 U.S.C. §\n\n1132(c).\n\n     The issue in this cross-appeal is whether the TAC should be\n\nconsidered an “administrator” for purposes of section 502(c) of\n\nERISA.    The previous discussion shows that the Plan designated\n\nEastern as Plan administrator, whereas the TAC served as named\n\n\nthe then-chairman of the TAC. His August 19, 1991, letter to\nO'Connor requested copies of the “amendments to the [Plan],” an\nexplanation of whether the TAC “had the right to amend the\n[Plan],” and a statement disclosing the number of applications\nfor lump-sum benefits filed since January 18, 1991.\n     70\n       Section 502(a)(1)(A) of ERISA empowers participants and\nbeneficiaries to sue “for the relief provided for in\nsubsection(c) of [section 502].\" 29 U.S.C. 1132(a)(1)(A).\n     71\n       In the alternative, the TAC argued that Hunt did not\nrequest information that ERISA requires an administrator to\nprovide. Like the district court, we make no ruling on this\nissue.\n\n                                  62\n\ffiduciary and as administrator of only the periodic-payment and\n\nloan options.72    Hunt contends, however, that the TAC functioned\n\nas de facto administrator and thus should be held liable for\n\nfailing to respond to his requests for information.\n\n     Hunt bases his claim on Law v.

After reviewing the plan\n\ndocuments in question, the First Circuit held that if the company\n\n“acted as the plan administrator in respect to dissemination of\n\ninformation concerning plan benefits, it may be properly treated\n\nas such for purposes of the liability provided under [section\n\n502(c)].”   Law, 956 F.2d at 373; see also Rosen, 979 F.2d at 193-\n\n94 (“We agree with the reasoning of the First Circuit and we hold\n\nthat if a company is administrating the plan, then it can be held\n\nliable for ERISA violations, regardless of the provisions of the\n\nplan document.”)    The Law court further reasoned that to refrain\n\n\n\n     72\n       See supra parts I.D and III.C. We note again that our\ndiscussion in part III.C merely assumes for the sake of argument\nthat the TAC served as Plan administrator. Of course, neither\nthe Plan nor the record provides a legitimate basis for making\nthat assumption.\n     73\n       Other circuits have concluded that, for the statutory\npenalty to apply, the administrator must be the entity so\ndesignated in the plan documents.

In reaching this conclusion, the court emphasized\n\ntwo facts in particular:   (1) that the company, according to the\n\nplan documents, still exercised considerable control over plan\n\nadministration; and (2) that the plaintiff's requests for\n\ninformation were eventually answered by company employees on\n\ncompany stationery.   Id. at 373-74.\n\n     Although Hunt states in his brief that “Eastern had\n\ndelegated, and TAC had assumed, the role of Plan Administrator,”\n\nthe record demonstrates that this statement is patently\n\ninaccurate.   First, as discussed in parts I.D and III.C, supra,\n\nthe record makes clear that with the exception of the periodic-\n\npayment and loan options, which were added effective June 25,\n\n1991,74 Eastern retained its authority as administrator of the\nPlan at all relevant times.   In fact, a July 1991 letter sent\n\nfrom the TAC to all plan participants regarding the periodic-\n\npayment and loan options makes this fact unambiguously clear:\n\n“The [Plan's] Trust Administrative Committee is designated as\n\nAdministrator of both of these new [Plan] provisions only.   As in\n\nthe past, Eastern retains administrative authority over all other\n\n\n     74\n       Hunt did not participate in either the periodic-payment\nor loan option, so this issue is not germane to his claim.\n\n                                64\n\fprovisions of the [Plan].”75   Consequently, Eastern retained its\n\nresponsibility under the Plan to provide information such as plan\n\nsummaries and annual statements to all participants.    See §§ 2.5,\n\n2.6.\n\n       Second, Hunt's claim fails because he misinterprets\n\nEastern's simple instructions to all participants in its\n\nFebruary 4, 1991, letter.    Hunt argues in his brief that this\n\nletter, which was sent by Eastern and printed on Eastern\n\nstationery, indicated that the “TAC was the authority designated\n\nby the Plan Administrator for dissemination of information\n\nregarding the [Plan].”    This short letter, however, stated that\n\n“[q]uestions regarding the temporary moratorium should be\n\naddressed to the [TAC]” (emphasis added); it made no\n\nrepresentation that the TAC was now responsible for providing\n\nplan summaries, annual statements, amendments, and other such\n\ninformation to participants.76   Furthermore, with the exception\n\nof the TAC’s responsibilities as administrator of the periodic-\n\npayment and loan options, the record is devoid of evidence\n\nshowing that the TAC had assumed any of Eastern's duties\n\n\n       75\n       This letter was sent pursuant to the TAC's authority\nunder § 10.2(c) “[t]o furnish to . . . Participants such reports\nwith respect to the functions, actions, and decisions of the\n[TAC] as are reasonable and appropriate.”\n       76\n       Hunt's arguments on this claim reveal a profound\nmisunderstanding about basic aspects of the Plan. For example,\nhe contends that the “TAC further held themselves out to be the\nPlan Administrator by claiming to be negotiating for, and\nselecting, an administrative services provider.” The Plan,\nhowever, charges the TAC, as named fiduciary, with the\nresponsibility for selecting investment advisors and other\nadministrative service personnel, provided that the TAC obtains\nALPA's consent. See §§ 2.9, 2.13(c),(d).\n\n                                 65\n\fregarding the provision of information to participants.   We\n\ntherefore hold that Hunt has failed to support his contention\n\nthat the TAC functioned as de facto Plan administrator and that\n\nthe district court properly declined to impose a penalty on the\n\nTAC pursuant to ERISA § 502(c), 29 U.S.C. § 1132(c).\n\n\n\n                                V.\n\n     In light of the above, we REVERSE the judgment of the\n\ndistrict court awarding $352,748.74 plus costs to Hunt from the\n\ncoffers of the Plan's Fund (Counts II and IV).77   We AFFIRM the\n\ndecision of the district court to deny Hunt the assessment of a\n\nstatutory penalty under section 502(c) of ERISA (Count I).\n\n\n\n\n     77\n       Although the district court gave Hunt judgment on Count\nVII, it refused to give him the relief he sought in that count.\nSee supra note 48 and accompanying text. Nonetheless, for\ncompleteness, we reverse the court’s judgment on Count VII as\nwell as the court’s judgment on Counts II and IV.\n\n                                66\n\f</pre>",
