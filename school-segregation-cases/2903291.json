Vaughn Correctional Center, appeals pro se\n\nfrom an order by the District Court granting defendants’ motion for summary judgment.\n\fAppellees filed a motion for summary affirmance. For the reasons provided by the\n\nDistrict Court, we will grant the motion and affirm.\n\n       On February 3, 2006, Guinn filed a complaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983\n\nalleging that defendants had violated his Eighth Amendment rights when he was placed in\n\nisolation for disciplinary reasons. According to an incident report, on June 30, 2004,\n\nGuinn was standing alone in the Security Housing Unit (SHU) yard for recreation. As\n\ntwo officers walked by escorting another inmate, Guinn pulled out and threw a container\n\nof human waste on them. Officers escorted Guinn to an isolation unit where he remained\n\nfor 14 days while he waited to receive a hearing for the disciplinary charges. In his\n\ncomplaint, Guinn alleged that defendants put him “in the hole,” stripped him of his\n\nclothes, and left him in his undershorts without sheets and blankets for fourteen days.\n\nWhen he requested clothing or blankets, defendants said no. Guinn filed a grievance,\n\nwhich was returned to him with a note that his issue was “non-grievable.” Guinn\n\nincluded the warden in his action, alleging that he is liable for his correctional officers’\n\ntraining and skill.\n\n       Defendants argued that the record is devoid of factual evidence that defendants\n\nacted with deliberate indifference in failing to provide Guinn with humane conditions of\n\nconfinement. Defendants cited to the institutional logbook to corroborate that during his\n\nconfinement, Guinn was provided with food and shelter, routine medical visits, access to\n\nshower, a time to exercise, and laundry services. To the extent that Guinn experienced\n\nany discomfort during this time, he never sought medical treatment. Defendants thus\n\n                                               2\n\falleged that Guinn had provided no evidence from which a fact finder could conclude that\n\ndefendants were aware of a substantial risk to Guinn’s health or safety and affirmatively\n\ndisregarded that risk.\n\n         Defendants also argued that Guinn failed to demonstrate personal involvement\n\nwith respect to the warden, that Guinn failed to exhaust administrative remedies pursuant\n\nto 42 U.S.C. § 1997e, and that defendants were entitled to qualified immunity. Guinn did\n\nnot file a response to defendants’ motion, but filed a motion for a temporary restraining\n\norder.\n\n         The District Court granted the motion for summary judgment on September 16,\n\n2008. The court determined that the conditions of Guinn’s confinement did not rise to the\n\nlevel of a constitutional violation. Although he alleged that he was not provided with\n\nsheets or blankets while in isolation, the court determined that Guinn did not provide\n\nevidence that he sustained a serious physical harm. The court also found that the lack of\n\nclothing was not an Eighth Amendment violation where only minimal injury was alleged\n\nand Guinn otherwise failed to establish that he was denied “the minimal civilized measure\n\nof life’s necessities.” Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 834 (1994). Thus, the District\n\nCourt held that Guinn failed to satisfy both the objective and subjective standards to show\n\ndeliberate indifference. The District Court declined to address defendants’ remaining\n\ngrounds in support of their motion for summary judgment and denied as moot Guinn’s\n\nmotions for a temporary restraining order and to appoint counsel. Guinn appealed.\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\f       We have appellate jurisdiction over this appeal under 28 U.S.C. § 1291. Because\n\nGuinn is proceeding in forma pauperis in this appeal, we must dismiss the appeal under\n\n28 U.S.C. § 1915 (e)(2)(B) if it is legally frivolous. We may summarily affirm if Guinn’s\n\nappeal presents no substantial question. See 3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4 and 3d Cir. I.O.P. 10.6.\n\n       We exercise plenary review over a district court's order of summary judgment.\n\nSee Kaucher v. County of Bucks, 455 F.3d 418, 422 (3d Cir. 2006). Summary judgment\n\nis proper if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to\n\njudgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). An issue of material fact exists only\n\nif “the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving\n\nparty.” Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986).\n\n       The Eighth Amendment protects prison inmates from cruel and unusual\n\npunishment. See, e.g., Farmer, 511 U.S. at 832. However, not all deficiencies and\n\ninadequacies in prison conditions amount to a violation of a prisoner’s constitutional\n\nrights. Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U.S. 337, 349 (1981); Young v. Quinlan, 960 F.2d 351,\n\n364 (3d Cir. 1992) (segregated detention must not be foul, inhuman, or totally without\n\npenological justification). To show a violation of the Eighth Amendment, a prisoner must\n\nallege that (1) the deprivation be, objectively, sufficiently serious, and (2) the prison\n\nofficial possess a sufficiently culpable state of mind in acting deliberately indifferent to\n\nthe inmate's safety. Farmer, 511 U.S. at 834.\n\n       Guinn has not provided any evidence that could raise a genuine issue of material\n\nfact regarding the condition of his confinement. The record shows that the prison\n\n                                               4\n\fcomplied with constitutional standards at the most basic level, and Guinn does not\n\nprovide any evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that his health and\n\nsafety were at risk. See Hassine v. Jeffes, 846 F.2d 169, 174-75 (3d Cir. 1988); see also\n\nWilliams v. Delo, 49 F.3d 442, 446 (8th Cir. 1995) (constitutional analysis of strip cell\n\nconditions). Although defendants do not dispute that Guinn had the barest of clothing,\n\nGuinn does not provide any evidence to show that as a consequence of his limited\n\nclothing or the temperature of the strip cell, he suffered a serious physical harm.1 Farmer,\n\n511 U.S. at 834. Guinn lacks evidence to prove the first prong of an Eighth Amendment\n\nviolation, and relying on his allegations alone are insufficient at the summary judgment\n\nstage. Id. Moreover, the record indicates that prison officials provided him with\n\nsufficient nutrition, shelter, and medical care. Tillery v. Owens, 907 F.2d 418, 426 (3d\n\nCir. 1990). Therefore, the District Court properly granted the motion for summary\n\njudgment.\n\n\n\n\n       1\n         Guinn stated at his deposition that temperatures were freezing, but he did not\nprovide any evidence to specifically support this allegation. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 247.\nDefendants also provided incident reports indicating that Guinn previously flushed his\nclothing down the toilet. Although they did not explicitly argue that Guinn’s conduct\nprovided a legitimate penological basis for denying him clothing, the District Court\nappeared to rely on this justification in its constitutional analysis. See also Rhodes, 452\nU.S. at 346 (“Among ‘unnecessary and wanton’ inflictions of pain are those that are\n‘totally without penological justification.’” (citations omitted)); Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S.\n520, 546-47 (1979) (maintaining institutional security and preserving internal order are\nessential goals that may require limitation on the constitutional rights of prisoners); see\nalso Young, 960 F.2d at 363-64.\n\n                                              5\n\f       We note that Guinn filed a document in support of this appeal on November 24,\n\n2008, in which he states that he received defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment on\n\nJanuary 23, 2007, but did not receive the supporting Memorandum of Points and\n\nAuthorities. Guinn argues that the District Court should not have granted summary\n\nbecause he was not properly served. Our review of the certificates of service for\n\ndefendants’ Motion and Memorandum reflect identical name and address information.\n\nThe Motion for Summary Judgment also references that it is supported by the\n\nMemorandum of Points and Authorities, which was filed simultaneously. Furthermore,\n\nthe District Court Clerk sent Guinn a letter regarding the status of the case on July 3,\n\n2008, and attached a print-out of the docket, which included entry of both the Motion for\n\nSummary Judgment and the Memorandum. Thus, Guinn had both notice and time to file\n\na response.\n\n       Finally, given the district courts’ broad discretion to determine whether\n\nappointment of counsel is warranted, we find the denial of Guinn’s motions did not\n\nconstitute an abuse of discretion. Tabron v. Grace, 6 F.3d 147, 158 (3d Cir. 1993).\n\nGuinn’s filings reflect that he was able to present and litigate his case and did not show\n\nthat without counsel, he would be prejudiced. Id.; Smith-Bey v. Petsock, 741 F.2d 22, 26\n\n(3d Cir. 1984). The District Court also did not err in denying Guinn’s motion for a\n\ntemporary restraining order. Fed. R. Civ. P. 65.\n\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\f       As Guinn’s appeal presents no substantial question, we grant Appellees’ motion\n\nand summarily affirm the District Court judgment. See 3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4 and 3d Cir.\n\nI.O.P. 10.6.\n\n\n\n\n                                           7\n\f",

See, e.g., Farmer, 511 U.S. at 832. However, not all deficiencies and\n\ninadequacies in prison conditions amount to a violation of a prisoner’s constitutional\n\nrights. Rhodes v.

To show a violation of the Eighth Amendment, a prisoner must\n\nallege that (1) the deprivation be, objectively, sufficiently serious, and (2) the prison\n\nofficial possess a sufficiently culpable state of mind in acting deliberately indifferent to\n\nthe inmate's safety. Farmer, 511 U.S. at 834.\n\n       Guinn has not provided any evidence that could raise a genuine issue of material\n\nfact regarding the condition of his confinement. The record shows that the prison\n\n                                               4\n\fcomplied with constitutional standards at the most basic level, and Guinn does not\n\nprovide any evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that his health and\n\nsafety were at risk.

Although defendants do not dispute that Guinn had the barest of clothing,\n\nGuinn does not provide any evidence to show that as a consequence of his limited\n\nclothing or the temperature of the strip cell, he suffered a serious physical harm.1 Farmer,\n\n511 U.S. at 834. Guinn lacks evidence to prove the first prong of an Eighth Amendment\n\nviolation, and relying on his allegations alone are insufficient at the summary judgment\n\nstage. Id. Moreover, the record indicates that prison officials provided him with\n\nsufficient nutrition, shelter, and medical care. Tillery v. Owens, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"544257\"><a href=\"/opinion/544257/major-tillery-victor-hassine-kenneth-davenport-william-grandison-nelson/\"><span class=\"volume\">907</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">418</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 426 (3d\n\nCir. 1990). Therefore, the District Court properly granted the motion for summary\n\njudgment.\n\n\n\n\n       1\n         Guinn stated at his deposition that temperatures were freezing, but he did not\nprovide any evidence to specifically support this allegation. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 247.\nDefendants also provided incident reports indicating that Guinn previously flushed his\nclothing down the toilet. Although they did not explicitly argue that Guinn’s conduct\nprovided a legitimate penological basis for denying him clothing, the District Court\nappeared to rely on this justification in its constitutional analysis. See also Rhodes, 452\nU.S. at 346 (“Among ‘unnecessary and wanton’ inflictions of pain are those that are\n‘totally without penological justification.’” (citations omitted)); Bell v. Wolfish, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110075\"><a href=\"/opinion/110075/bell-v-wolfish/\"><span class=\"volume\">441</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">520</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 546-47 (1979) (maintaining institutional security and preserving internal order are\nessential goals that may require limitation on the constitutional rights of prisoners); see\nalso Young, 960 F.2d at 363-64.\n\n                                              5\n\f       We note that Guinn filed a document in support of this appeal on November 24,\n\n2008, in which he states that he received defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment on\n\nJanuary 23, 2007, but did not receive the supporting Memorandum of Points and\n\nAuthorities. Guinn argues that the District Court should not have granted summary\n\nbecause he was not properly served. Our review of the certificates of service for\n\ndefendants’ Motion and Memorandum reflect identical name and address information.\n\nThe Motion for Summary Judgment also references that it is supported by the\n\nMemorandum of Points and Authorities, which was filed simultaneously. Furthermore,\n\nthe District Court Clerk sent Guinn a letter regarding the status of the case on July 3,\n\n2008, and attached a print-out of the docket, which included entry of both the Motion for\n\nSummary Judgment and the Memorandum. Thus, Guinn had both notice and time to file\n\na response.\n\n       Finally, given the district courts’ broad discretion to determine whether\n\nappointment of counsel is warranted, we find the denial of Guinn’s motions did not\n\nconstitute an abuse of discretion. Tabron v. Grace, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"654205\"><a href=\"/opinion/654205/harvey-tabron-v-lt-grace-lieutenant-major-price-correct-officer-gross/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">147</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 158 (3d Cir. 1993).\n\nGuinn’s filings reflect that he was able to present and litigate his case and did not show\n\nthat without counsel, he would be prejudiced. Id.; Smith-Bey v. Petsock, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"439987\"><a href=\"/opinion/439987/robert-smith-bey-v-george-petsock-superintendent-thomas-seiverling/\"><span class=\"volume\">741</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 26\n\n(3d Cir. 1984). The District Court also did not err in denying Guinn’s motion for a\n\ntemporary restraining order. Fed. R. Civ. P. 65.\n\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\f       As Guinn’s appeal presents no substantial question, we grant Appellees’ motion\n\nand summarily affirm the District Court judgment.
