JONES, Circuit Judge:\n       Appellees Voting for America, Inc., Brad Richey, Penelope McFadden, and\nProject Vote, Inc. (“Appellees”) sued Texas Secretary of State John Steen\n(“Steen”)1 for declaratory and injunctive relief against several provisions of\nTexas’s law regulating volunteer deputy registrars, Tex. Elec.

For convenience, we refer to the prior opinions as Andrade I and II, while the\ndefendant is now Steen.\n\f    Case: 12-40914     Document: 00512395979       Page: 2   Date Filed: 10/03/2013\n\n\n\n\n                                   No. 12-40914\n\nviolating the National Voter Registration Act (“NVRA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 1973gg et\nseq. A motions panel of this court granted a stay pending appeal. Amplifying\nthe motions panel’s majority opinion, we conclude that Appellees failed to\nestablish facial unconstitutionality of the challenged provisions.              The\npreliminary injunction is reversed and the case remanded for further\nproceedings.\n                                 I. Background\n      Steen administers the VDR Law, which regulates the appointment and\nactivities of volunteer deputy registrars (“VDRs”), individuals trained and\nempowered to receive and deliver completed voter registration applications.\nAfter Texas amended the VDR Law in 2011, Appellees requested Steen’s\ninterpretation of several provisions. Unsatisfied with the answers, Appellees\nfiled this lawsuit seeking injunctive relief on the basis that several provisions\nrestrict their ability to conduct voter registration drives in violation of the First\nAmendment and the NVRA.\n      In May 2012, Appellees moved for a preliminary injunction. After a\nhearing, the district court granted the motion in part, enjoining enforcement of\nthe following provisions of the VDR Law:\n            (1) Texas Election Code § 13.031(d)(3) to the extent it forbids\n      non-Texas residents from serving as VDRs (the “Non-Resident\n      Provision”);\n\n           (2) Texas Election Code § 13.038 to the extent it prohibits\n      VDRs appointed in one county from serving in another county (the\n      “County Provision”);\n\n          (3) Texas Election Code § 13.008(a)(2) & (3) (the\n      “Compensation Provision”);\n\n\n                                         2\n\f     Case: 12-40914      Document: 00512395979         Page: 3    Date Filed: 10/03/2013\n\n\n\n\n                                     No. 12-40914\n\n              (4) Texas Election Code § 13.038 to the extent it prohibits\n       VDRs from photocopying or scanning voter registration applications\n       submitted to the VDR but not yet delivered to the county registrar\n       (so long as no information deemed confidential under § 13.004 is\n       included) (the “Photocopying Provision”); and\n\n            (5) Texas Election Code § 13.042 to the extent it prohibits\n       VDRs from sending completed voter registration applications via\n       United States mail (the “Personal Delivery Provision”).2\n\n       Steen appealed and moved for a stay pending appeal, which the district\ncourt denied. A motions panel of this court granted the stay after hearing oral\nargument. The U.S. Supreme Court denied Appellees’ emergency application to\nvacate the stay pending appeal. Voting for Am., Inc. v. Andrade, 133 S. Ct. 99\n(2012) (Justice Sotomayor would have granted the application in part).\n       On September 26, 2012, the motions panel issued an unpublished opinion\nexplaining its reasons for granting the stay, along with a dissenting opinion.\nVoting for Am., Inc. v. Andrade, 488 F. App’x 890 (5th Cir. 2012) [hereinafter\nAndrade II] (unpublished). Although we are not bound by the ruling of motions\npanel in the same case, see Mattern v. Eastman Kodak Co., 104 F.3d 702, 704\n(5th Cir. 1997), we substantially agree with the majority’s analysis, and we\nconclude that Appellees have not established a strong likelihood of prevailing on\nthe merits of their claims.\n                              II.

Med. Providers Performing Abortion Servs. v. Lakey, 667 F.3d\n570, 574 (5th Cir. 2012) (internal citation omitted). This court has repeatedly\ncautioned that “a preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy which\nshould not be granted unless the party seeking it has ‘clearly carried the burden\nof persuasion on all four requirements.’” Id. (quoting Lake Charles Diesel, Inc.\nv. Gen. Motors Corp., 328 F.3d 192, 195–96 (5th Cir. 2003)). We review a district\ncourt’s ultimate issuance of a preliminary injunction for an abuse of discretion.\nJanvey v. Alguire, 647 F.3d 585, 592 (5th Cir. 2011). “As to each element of the\ndistrict court’s preliminary-injunction analysis, however, the district court’s\nfindings of fact are subject to a clearly-erroneous standard of review, while\nconclusions of law are subject to broad review and will be reversed if incorrect.”\nDennis Melancon, Inc. v. City of New Orleans, 703 F.3d 262, 267 (5th Cir. 2012)\n(internal quotations omitted).\n                                 III. Discussion\n      Initially, we address the constitutional challenges concerning three VDR\nprovisions, and we then move to the alleged conflict between two other\nprovisions and federal law.\n\n\n\n\n                                        4\n\f     Case: 12-40914    Document: 00512395979      Page: 5   Date Filed: 10/03/2013\n\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-40914\nA.    First Amendment\n      Principles of judicial restraint must be employed before a federal court\nmay declare a state law unconstitutional. Although their briefing conveys some\nambiguity, Appellees essentially assert the facial unconstitutionality of the\nNon-Resident, County, and Compensation provisions. Courts generally disfavor\nfacial challenges, and for good reason. “[F]acial challenges threaten to short\ncircuit the democratic process by preventing laws embodying the will of the\npeople from being implemented in a manner consistent with the Constitution.”\nWash. State Grange v. Wash. State Republican Party, 552 U.S. 442, 451, 128\nS. Ct. 1184, 1191 (2008). With the exception of First Amendment cases, a facial\nchallenge will succeed only if the plaintiff establishes that the act is invalid\nunder all of its applications. United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 745,\n107 S. Ct. 2095, 2100 (1987). The standard for facial challenges in First\nAmendment cases is different, although still daunting. A law implicating the\nright to expression may be may be invalidated on a facial challenge if “a\nsubstantial number of its applications are unconstitutional, judged in relation\nto the statute’s plainly legitimate sweep.” United States v. Stevens, 130 S. Ct.\n1577, 1587 (2010) (quoting Washington State Grange, 552 U.S. at 449, n.6,\n128 S. Ct. at 1191 n.6 ). Other relevant limits on our authority were well stated\nby the motions panel majority:\n      Our task as a federal court is, to the extent possible, to construe the\n      provisions to avoid a constitutional conflict. See, e.g., Ohio v. Akron\n      Ctr. for Reprod. Health , 497 U.S. 502, 514, 110 S. Ct. 2972, 2980\n      (1990). A federal court should not lightly enjoin the enforcement of\n      a state statute. Chisom v. Roemer, 853 F.2d 1186, 1189 (5th Cir.\n      1988). The determination of whether a democratically enacted\n      statute is constitutional on its face requires that “every reasonable\n      construction must be resorted to [ ] in order to save a statute from\n\n                                        5\n\f    Case: 12-40914     Document: 00512395979       Page: 6   Date Filed: 10/03/2013\n\n\n\n\n                                   No. 12-40914\n      unconstitutionality. “ Nat’l Fed. of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, U.S.\n         , 132 S. Ct. 2566, 2594 (2012). In this vein, [Steen’s]\n      interpretation must be accorded some meaningful weight, as [he] is\n      the official charged with enforcing the statute. See Bellotti v. Baird,\n      428 U.S. 132, 143, 96 S. Ct. 2857, 2864(1976). We defer to [his]\n      interpretation of how the law is to be enforced, so long as it does not\n      conflict with the statutory text. See Hamer v. Musselwhite, 376 F.2d\n      479, 481 (5th Cir. 1967) (deferring to the city’s interpretation of an\n      ordinance because city officials are charged with enforcing the\n      statute and are the ones who must apply it).\n\nAndrade II, 488 F. App’x at 895.\n      Under the federalist structure of the United States, the states are\nresponsible for regulating the conduct of their elections. It is well recognized\nthat state regulations will invariably affect “the individual’s right to vote and his\nright to associate with others for political ends.”       Anderson v. Celebrezze,\n460 U.S. 780, 788, 180 S. Ct. 1564, 1570 (1983). Where a state election rule\ndirectly restricts or otherwise burdens an individual’s First Amendment rights,\ncourts apply a balancing test derived from two Supreme Court decisions,\nAnderson, supra, and Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428, 112 S. Ct. 2059 (1992).\nUsing the Anderson/Burdick balancing test, the court “must first consider the\ncharacter and magnitude of the asserted injury to the rights protected by the\nFirst and Fourteenth Amendments that the plaintiff seeks to vindicate.”\nAnderson, 460 U.S. at 789, 103 S. Ct. at 1570. Next, the court “must identify and\nevaluate the precise interest put forward by the State as justifications for the\nburden imposed by its rule.” Id. In passing judgment, the court “must weigh\n‘the character and magnitude of the asserted injury to the rights protected by the\nFirst and Fourteenth Amendments that the plaintiff seeks to vindicate’ against\n‘the precise interests put forward by the State as justifications for the burden\n\n\n                                         6\n\f    Case: 12-40914    Document: 00512395979     Page: 7   Date Filed: 10/03/2013\n\n\n\n\n                                 No. 12-40914\nimposed by its rule,’ taking into consideration ‘the extent to which those\ninterests make it necessary to burden the plaintiff's rights.’” Burdick, 504 U.S.\nat 434, 112 S. Ct. at 2063 (quoting Anderson, 460 U.S. at 789, 103 S. Ct. at\n1570). State rules that impose a severe burden on First Amendment rights must\nbe “narrowly drawn to advance a state interest of compelling importance.”\nBurdick, 504 U.S. at 434, 112 S. Ct. 2063 (quoting Norman v. Reed, 502 U.S. 279,\n289, 112 S. Ct. 698 (1992). “Lesser burdens, however, trigger less exacting\nreview, and a State’s ‘important regulatory interests’ will usually be enough to\njustify ‘reasonable, nondiscriminatory restrictions.’” Timmons v. Twin Cities\nArea New Party, 520 U.S. 351, 358, 117 S. Ct. 1364, 1370 (1997) (internal\ncitations omitted). Thus, Anderson/Burdick provides no “litmus-paper test” that\nexcuses courts reviewing election-related free expression cases from the “hard\njudgments” common in ordinary litigation. Anderson, 460 U.S. at 789–90.\n      Here, Appellees face a threshold problem. As the party invoking the First\nAmendment’s protection, they have the burden to prove that it applies. Clark\nv. Cmty. for Creative Non-Violence, 468 U.S. 288, 293 n.5, 104 S. Ct. 3065, 3069\nn.5 (1984). In Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc.,\n547 U.S. 47, 66, 126 S. Ct. 1297, 1310 (2006), the Supreme Court reiterated that\nthe First Amendment protects speech as well as certain kinds of conduct.\nHowever, the Court went on to underscore that only conduct that is “inherently\nexpressive” is entitled to First Amendment protection. Id. at 66. To determine\nwhether particular conduct possesses sufficient “communicative elements” to be\nembraced by the First Amendment, courts look to whether the conduct shows an\n“intent to convey a particular message” and whether “the likelihood was great\nthat the message would be understood by those who viewed it.” Texas v.\n\n\n                                       7\n\f    Case: 12-40914    Document: 00512395979     Page: 8   Date Filed: 10/03/2013\n\n\n\n\n                                 No. 12-40914\nJohnson, 491 U.S. 397, 404, 109 S. Ct. 2533, 2539 (1989) (internal quotation\nmarks and citation omitted).      Conduct does not become speech for First\nAmendment purposes merely because the person engaging in the conduct\nintends to express an idea. Rumsfeld, 547 U.S. at 66, 126 S. Ct. at 1310.\n      The district court accepted Appellees’ argument that all of the conduct\ncomprising voter registration drives—urging citizens to vote, organizing the\ndrive, conducting voter registration, and verifying that registrations have been\naccepted by the government—is “expressive conduct” protected by the First\nAmendment. See Voting for Am., Inc. v. Andrade, 888 F.Supp.2d 816, 839–43\n(S.D. Tex. 2012) [hereinafter Andrade I]. The court broadly concluded that these\nactivities implicate core political free speech and association. Wisely declining\nto apply strict scrutiny, however, the court ruled that burdens imposed by the\nNon-Resident Provision, the County Provision, and the Compensation Provision\nwere not justified under the Anderson/Burdick balancing test. Id. at 843,\n851–52.\n      Like the motions panel majority, we are unpersuaded that the\nsmorgasbord of activities comprising voter registration drives involves\nexpressive conduct or conduct so inextricably intertwined with speech as to\nrequire First Amendment scrutiny. Instead, we analyze the challenged Texas\nprovisions separately because, as will be shown, discrete steps of the voter\nregistration drive are in fact separable and are governed by different legal\nstandards. See Planned Parenthood v. Suehs, 692 F.3d 343, 349 (5th Cir. 2012)\n(reviewing a temporary injunction that impermissibly grouped state regulations\non promotion of abortion with the right to affiliate with other pro-choice\nsupporters). Further, this mode of analysis is required by the Supreme Court,\n\n\n                                       8\n\f    Case: 12-40914     Document: 00512395979     Page: 9   Date Filed: 10/03/2013\n\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-40914\nwhich, in the context of election-related burdens on free expression, has long\nadvised against substituting the hard judgments common in ordinary litigation\nwith litmus-paper tests. Anderson, 460 U.S. at 789–90. The Court also has\nrepeatedly explained that non-expressive conduct does not acquire First\nAmendment protection whenever it is combined with another activity that\ninvolves protected speech. See, e.g, Clark, 468 U.S. at 297–98, 104 S. Ct. at 3071\n(emphasizing that the activity of camping does not become speech protected by\nthe First Amendment when demonstrators camp as part of a political\ndemonstration); Rumsfeld, 547 U.S. at 66, 126 S. Ct. at 1311 (2006) (“If\ncombining speech and conduct were enough to create expressive conduct, a\nregulated party could always transform conduct into ‘speech’ simply by talking\nabout it.”); see also United States v. O’Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 376, 88 S. Ct. 1673,\n1678 (1968) (“We cannot accept the view that an apparently limitless variety of\nconduct can be labeled ‘speech’ whenever the person engaging in the conduct\nintends thereby to express an idea.”).\n      1.    Non-Resident and County Provisions\n      The Non-Resident and County Provisions restrict the appointment of\nVDRs in two ways: VDRs must be Texas residents; and they may only register\nvoters for counties in which the VDRs have been appointed. A VDR may be\ntrained in one county and may apply by mail for automatic appointment in other\ncounties. County registrars are required to appoint everyone who applies and\nsatisfies the position's minimal criteria. Tex. Elec. Code Ann. § 13.031 (18 years\nof age, not a felon). The County appointment requirement has existed since\n1985. A state residency requirement (for petition circulators) was upheld by the\nEighth Circuit. Initiative & Referendum Inst. v. Jaeger, 241 F.3d 614 (8th Cir.\n\n\n                                         9\n\f    Case: 12-40914     Document: 00512395979        Page: 10   Date Filed: 10/03/2013\n\n\n\n\n                                     No. 12-40914\n2001).    As these provisions have been interpreted by Steen, VDRs for each\ncounty exclusively are allowed to receive and deliver voter registration forms to\nthe county offices for processing.\n      Appellees contend that these limits on the scope of VDRs’ appointments\nprevent out-of-state-residents from acting as VDRs, inhibit the efficient\nfunctioning of voter registration drives, and truncate their ability to conduct the\ndrives in violation of the First Amendment. We adopt the analysis of the\nmotions panel majority rejecting these propositions, and recapitulate some of it\nhere, together with additional reasons. See Andrade II, 488 F. App’x at 897–900.\n      The state does not deny that some voter registration activities involve\nspeech—“urging” citizens to register; “distributing” voter registration forms;\n“helping” voters to fill out their forms; and “asking” for information to verify that\nregistrations were processed successfully. Texas neither regulates nor limits any\nof this constitutionally protected speech. The district court accepted these\nrepresentations, and so do we.\n      To establish their premise that the First Amendment protects what VDRs\ndo—collect, review for completeness, and deliver completed voter registration\nforms—Appellees must show why such conduct is inherently expressive or why\ntheir “speech” is inextricably entwined with such actions. From a practical\nstandpoint, the activities involved in a voter registration drive can be separated\nin a number of ways. For instance, experienced team leaders from out-of-state\ncould organize the drive and train canvassers, using local citizens as VDRs and\ncanvassers to complete and deliver the registration forms. Appellees in fact\ntestified that they prefer to use local citizens as VDRs or canvassers. Out-of-\nstate or out-of-county canvassers can participate anywhere, in any capacity,\nexcept to perform the functions exclusively ascribed to trained volunteer VDRs:\n\n                                          10\n\f    Case: 12-40914       Document: 00512395979    Page: 11   Date Filed: 10/03/2013\n\n\n\n\n                                   No. 12-40914\ncollecting, reviewing for completeness, issuing a receipt, and delivering the\ncompleted voter registration forms to a county office. See Tex. Elec. Code Ann.\n§§ 13.038–.040, 13.042. With an appropriate division of labor and organizational\nforethought, no participant in the drive need suffer a detriment of the ability to\nurge, advocate, interact, or persuade.\n      Put otherwise, while voter registration drives involve core protected\nspeech, they are factually distinct from the circulation of petitions addressed by\nthe Supreme Court in Meyer v. Grant, 486 U.S. 414, 108 S. Ct. 1886 (1988), and\nBuckley v. Am. Constitutional Law Fund, 525 U.S. 182, 119 S. Ct. 636 (1999).\nPetitions by themselves are protected speech, and unlike a completed voter\nregistration form, they are the circulator’s speech. Assuming a voter registration\napplication is speech, it is the voter’s speech indicating his desire to be\nregistered. Soliciting, urging and persuading the citizen to vote are the forms\nof the canvasser’s speech, but only the voter decides to “speak” by registering.\nLogically, what the VDR does with the voter’s form follows the voter’s\ncompletion of the application but is not itself “speech.” One does not “speak” in\nthis context by handling another person’s “speech.” As the state's brief observes,\nthe voter could refuse to return a registration application to the VDR and say,\n\"I'll mail it myself.\"\n      The motions panel majority made this point in a slightly different way:\n      At oral argument, Appellees urged the court to draw a close parallel\n      to the Supreme Court’s reasoning in Meyer, 486 U.S. at 422, finding\n      that the circulation of initiative petitions was a matter involving the\n      core political speech rights of the circulators under the First\n      Amendment. The analogy is improper. The circulation and\n      submission of an initiative petition is closely intertwined with the\n      underlying political ideas put forth by the petition. The petition\n      itself is the protected speech. Moreover, the very nature of a\n\n                                         11\n\f    Case: 12-40914    Document: 00512395979      Page: 12    Date Filed: 10/03/2013\n\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-40914\n      petition process requires association between the third-party\n      circulator and the individuals agreeing to sign. In the voter\n      registration context, the underlying expressive conduct (encouraging\n      democratic participation and voting) does not implicate a third-\n      party’s right to process the application. Voter registration\n      applications are individual, not associational, and may be\n      successfully submitted without the aid of another. Here, the actual\n      expression is not being limited.\n\nAndrade II, 488 F. App’x at 898 n.13 (emphasis added).\n      Buckley and Meyer are further distinguishable because those cases\ninvolved laws that specifically regulated the process of advocacy itself, dictating\nwho could speak (only unpaid circulators and registered voters) or how to go\nabout speaking (with name badges and subsequent detailed reports). Thus, the\nColorado law had “the inevitable effect of reducing the total quantum of speech,”\nlimiting “the number of voices who will convey [Plaintiffs’] message and the\nhours they can speak and, therefore, limit[ing] the size of the audience they can\nreach.” Meyer, 486 U.S. at 422–23, 108 S. Ct. at 1892. The motions panel\nmajority aptly responded to the claim that the Texas provisions are\nunconstitutional for the same reason:\n      This argument simply does not apply. No party argues that the law\n      prevents anyone, regardless of domicile or VDR appointment, from\n      passing out registration forms and encouraging others to vote. The\n      size of the audience remains the same, and the “total quantum of\n      speech” is unaffected. While affirming the striking down of some\n      provisions of Colorado law in Buckley, the Court recognized an\n      “important interest” of the state in protecting the integrity of the\n      ballot initiative process there at issue and in deterring fraud.\n      525 U.S. at 204–05.\nAndrade II, 488 F. App’x at 897 n.12.\n\n\n\n                                        12\n\f    Case: 12-40914        Document: 00512395979          Page: 13     Date Filed: 10/03/2013\n\n\n\n\n                                       No. 12-40914\n       The Non-Resident and County provisions do not in any way restrict or\nregulate who can advocate pro-voter-registration messages, the manner in which\nthey may do so, or any communicative conduct.3 They merely regulate the\nreceipt and delivery of completed voter-registration applications, two\nnon-expressive activities.4 See League of Women Voters of Fla. v. Browning,\n575 F. Supp. 2d 1298, 1319 (S.D. Fla. 2008) (“[T]he collection and handling of\nvoter registration applications is not inherently expressive activity”); Garman\nv. U.S. Postal Service, 509 F.Supp. 507, 510 (N.D. Ind. 1981) (noting that the\nministerial task of processing draft registration forms has no speech component\nthat would implicate First Amendment rights).\n           Similarly, because the canvassers’ speech-related activities are distinct\nfrom both the collection and delivery of the forms and from the voters’ “speech”\nin registering, the drives themselves cannot be amalgamated into protected\n“expressive conduct.” In Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. at 406, 109 S. Ct. at 2540,\n\n       3\n          The motions panel majority commented that no court of appeals has held receipt and\ndelivery of voter registration forms alone entitled to First Amendment protection. Andrade\nII, 488 F. App’x at 898. We are also unpersuaded by the lower court cases cited by the district\ncourt that applied Meyer to laws regulating third-party registration drives because those\ncourts focused on the expressive aspects of plaintiffs’ conduct during voter registration drives\ninstead of applying this court’s approach of examining the precise conduct regulated by each\nchallenged law. See, e.g., League of Women Voters v. Cobb, 447 F.Supp.2d 1314, 1322 (S.D.\nFla. 2006) (finding certain requirements imposed on third-parties who collect registration\nforms unconstitutional as “reducing the quantum of political speech”); Project Vote v.\nBlackwell, 455 F.Supp.2d 694, 699 (N.D. Ohio 2006) (applying intermediate scrutiny to all\naspects of third-party registration laws); see also American Association of People with\nDisabilities v. Herrera, 690 F.Supp.2d 1183, 1200 (D. N.M. 2010) (finding that the plaintiff's\ngeneralized third-party voter registration activity implicated expressive conduct because it\nwas intended to “convey a message that voting is important”).\n       4\n        Because collecting and delivering completed registration forms are not speech, Texas\ncould prohibit private persons from engaging in these activities. Cf. Herrera, 690 F.Supp.2d\nat 1218 (noting that New Mexico would not violate the Constitution if all voter registration\nwere conducted through government officials).\n\n                                              13\n\f    Case: 12-40914       Document: 00512395979          Page: 14     Date Filed: 10/03/2013\n\n\n\n\n                                       No. 12-40914\nfor instance, the act of burning the American flag indicated the speaker’s\ncontempt for the Republican Party’s renomination of Ronald Reagan for\nPresident. The conduct was the message. But if actually registering citizens to\nvote is necessary to “express” the canvasser’s belief in the importance of voting,\nthen Appellees essentially seek a “First Amendment right not just to speak out\nor engage in ‘expressive conduct’ but also to succeed in their ultimate goal\nregardless of any other considerations.” Andrade II, 488 F. App’x at 898. Only\ntwo possibilities flow from this reasoning. As the motions panel majority\nsuggests, throwing voter registration forms in the trash would have to be\nconstitutionally protected expressive conduct. Id. at 898 n.14.5 But cf. Tex. Elec.\nCode Ann. § 13.043 (failure of a VDR to deliver completed applications is an\noffense). Alternatively, and more sensibly, one must concede that supporting\nvoter registration is the canvasser’s speech, while actually completing the forms\nis the voter’s speech, and collecting and delivering the forms are merely conduct.\n       Appellees urged that these limits on who may be VDRs and what they may\ndo will interfere with Appellees’ ability to conduct large-scale voter registration\n\n\n       5\n          One clear principle that can be derived from the long line of election-related speech\ncases is that the degree of protection afforded under the First Amendment does not vary in\naccordance with anyone’s regard for the content of the message at issue. Thus, the logic of the\nAppellees extends to parties who wish to see fewer citizens vote even if it is true that\nAppellees’ ultimate goal is to have more citizens vote. The prevailing cases also do not extend\nFirst Amendment protection to an “anything goes” philosophy that seeks to insulate “any\nconduct that may relate in any way to speech or expression.” Andrade II, 488 F. App’x at 897\nn. 12. Here, Appellees offer a novel interpretation of the First Amendment. They contend that\nexpressive activity, the promotion of voter registration in this case, is contingent upon the\n“success” factor of actually registering voters. While the First Amendment protects the right\nto express political views, nowhere does it guarantee the right to ensure those views come to\nfruition. To maintain otherwise would mean that a group seeking to discourage voting and\nvoter registration would have the “right” to achieve its expressive goals by throwing the\nregistration cards away.\n\n\n                                              14\n\f    Case: 12-40914    Document: 00512395979       Page: 15   Date Filed: 10/03/2013\n\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-40914\ndrives in Texas. But not every procedural limit on election-related conduct\nautomatically runs afoul of the First Amendment. The challenged law must\nrestrict political discussion or burden the exchange of ideas. See Initiative &\nReferendum Inst. v. Walker, 450 F.3d 1082, 1100–01 (10th Cir. 2006) (en banc)\n(state constitutional provision requiring a supermajority to pass a wildlife-\nrelated ballot initiative does not implicate the First Amendment because it\nneither regulated the advocacy itself nor limited the “communicative conduct\nof persons advocating a position”); Dobrovolny v. Moore, 126 F.3d 1111, 1113 (8th\nCir. 1997) (concluding that a Nebraska law establishing a procedure for\ncalculating the number of signatures required to place an initiative on the ballot\ndoes not implicate the First Amendment, although it “may have made it difficult\nfor appellants to plan their initiative campaign and efficiently allocate their\nresources”); Biddulph v. Mortham, 89 F.3d 1491, 1500–01 (11th Cir. 1996)\n(holding that a law did not violate the First Amendment because it did not\nburden the exchange of ideas and noting most laws restricting a state’s initiative\nprocess would not implicate the First Amendment). Whether requiring only\nVDRs to collect and deliver completed voter registration applications even\nincidentally affects Appellees’ activities is unclear, given the testimony that they\nprefer to hire local people to handle the actual registrations.          That the\nrequirement burdens no one’s core political speech is undisputable.\n      In sum, we agree with the motions panel majority’s conclusion that “there\nis nothing ‘inherently expressive’ about receiving a person’s completed\napplication and being charged with getting that application to the proper place.”\nAndrade II, 488 F. App’x at 898; see also League of Women Voters of Fla., 575\nF. Supp. 2d at 1319. Because the Non-Resident and County provisions regulate\n\n\n                                        15\n\f    Case: 12-40914    Document: 00512395979      Page: 16    Date Filed: 10/03/2013\n\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-40914\nconduct only and do not implicate the First Amendment, rational basis scrutiny\nis appropriate. See District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570, 628 n.27,\n128 S. Ct. 2817 n.27.     Steen justifies the Non-Resident provisions as an\nimportant safeguard in preventing fraud. He contends that if out-of-state\nresidents were to act as VDRs, they could be less easily deterred from breaking\nthe law because they could easily remove themselves from the jurisdiction of\nstate investigators and prosecutors.      Steen similarly justifies the County\nProvision as a means to increase accountability of VDRs by facilitating\nrevocation of their appointments in cases of negligence, fraud or violation of\nregistrants’ privacy. These are rational bases for the provisions. Cf. Jaeger,\n241 F.3d at 616 (holding that “the State has a compelling interest in preventing\nfraud” and that “[t]he residency requirement allows North Dakota’s Secretary\nof State to protect the petition process from fraud and abuse by ensuring that\ncirculators answer to the Secretary’s subpoena power”).\n        Even assuming arguendo that the Non-Resident and County provisions\nimplicate First Amendment interests, they pass the Anderson/Burdick balancing\ntest.   As a preliminary matter, there are fundamental differences in the\nactivities of VDRs and petition circulators. VDRs register fellow citizens to vote.\nThey may “advocate” and “interactively communicate” the importance of\nregistration, but they have a duty to the fellow citizens whose registrations they\nfacilitate. See, e.g., Tex. Elec. Code Ann. § 13.036(a)(2) (registrar may terminate\nVDR convicted of failing to deliver applications); § 13.036(b) (registrar may\nterminate VDR for failing to adequately review applications); § 13.044 (offense\nfor a person “purportedly” acting as a VDR without an appointment). They\nassume a role carefully regulated by the state to serve the citizens who register\n\n\n                                        16\n\f    Case: 12-40914    Document: 00512395979       Page: 17   Date Filed: 10/03/2013\n\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-40914\nto vote as well as the public interest in the integrity of the electoral body.\nPetition circulators, in contrast, are not agents of the state:\n      Nothing in this opinion should be read to suggest that initiative\n      petition circulators are agents of the state. Although circulators are\n      subject to regulations and are accountable to the State for\n      compliance with legitimate controls [citation omitted], circulators\n      act on behalf of themselves or the proponents of ballot initiatives.\n\nBuckley, 525 U.S. at 192 n.11, 119 S. Ct. at 642 n.11. Petition circulators’\nultimate responsibility lies in furthering their own or the sponsors’ advocacy.\nTo analyze VDRs’ responsibilities solely in terms of their advocacy denigrates\ntheir statutory duty to register all prospective voters whose applications they\ncollect. See Tex. Elec. Code Ann. § 13.043 (making it a crime to fail to deliver\nvoter applications). It is one thing to say core political speech is involved when\nthe advocates are trying to persuade the voting public to consider supporting an\ninitiative or place a candidate on the ballot;       it is quite another for the\n“advocates” to have free rein in creating the electorate. Thus, the character of\nany speech limited by the Non-Resident and County provisions is qualitatively\ndifferent from the political speech restricted by laws that affect petition\ncirculators.\n      The burdens imposed by the Non-Resident and County provisions on\ncanvassers’ speech are also minimal. Non-VDRs remain free to organize and run\nthe registration drive, persuade others to register to vote, distribute registration\nforms, and assist others in filling them out. Unlike the requirements struck\ndown in petition circulator cases, the Texas provisions do not directly reduce the\nnumber of voices by preventing out-of-state residents from advocating political\nor civic messages. See Buckley, 525 U.S. at 193 n.15, 119 S. Ct. at 643 n.15\n\n\n                                        17\n\f    Case: 12-40914     Document: 00512395979     Page: 18    Date Filed: 10/03/2013\n\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-40914\n(noting that “Colorado’s registration requirement would exclude approximately\n964,000 unregistered but voter-eligible residents from circulating petitions”);\nNader v. Blackwell, 545 F.3d 459 (6th Cir. 2008) (“[I]t is undisputable that [a\nresidency requirement for petition circulators] sharply limited Nader’s ability to\nconvey his message to Ohio voters and thereby curtailed Nader’s core political\nspeech.”); Krislov v. Rednour, 226 F.3d 851, 860 (7th Cir. 2000) (“By preventing\nthe candidates from employing millions of potential advocates to carry their\npolitical message to the people of Illinois, the statute places a formidable burden\non the candidates’ right to disseminate their message.”). Appellees’ claim that\nthey may be less successful in achieving the result they advocate or in running\na registration drive in the precise way they prefer does not demonstrate that\ntheir ability to advocate is significantly burdened by a requirement of Texas\nresidency for VDRs.\n      Although the restrictions on Appellees’ expressive voter registration\nactivities are not severe, the state must justify the Non-Resident and County\nprovisions with “important regulatory interests.” Anderson, 460 U.S. at 788, 103\nS. Ct. at 1570.      Steen asserts that Texas’s interest in preventing voter\nregistration fraud provides adequate justification. Any corruption in voter\nregistration affects a state’s paramount obligation to ensure the integrity of the\nvoting process and threatens the public’s right to democratic government. See\nCrawford v. Marion Cnty. Election Bd., 553 U.S. 181, 196, 128 S. Ct. 1610, 1619\n(2008) (“While the most effective method of preventing election fraud may well\nbe debatable, the propriety of doing so is perfectly clear.”); Storer v. Brown,\n415 U.S. 724, 730, 94 S. Ct. 1274, 1297 (1974) (noting that a state has the power\n\n\n\n\n                                        18\n\f    Case: 12-40914      Document: 00512395979     Page: 19   Date Filed: 10/03/2013\n\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-40914\nto engage in “substantial regulation of elections” in order to ensure elections are\nfair, honest, and orderly).\n      As the Supreme Court has recognized, the risk posed by fraud during the\nelectoral process is far greater than that in either the initiative or candidate\npetition process. Meyer, 486 U.S. at 427, 108 S. Ct. at 1895 (“the risk of fraud\nor corruption, or the appearance thereof, is more remote at the petition stage of\nan initiative than at the time of balloting”) (citing First Nat’l Bank v.

Ct. 1407, 1423 (1978) (“the risk of corruption perceived\nin cases involving candidate elections . . . simply is not present in a popular vote\non a public issue.”)). Indeed, Steen points to documented evidence of voter\nregistration fraud committed by canvassers, including those who worked for\nAppellee Project Vote and its former affiliate ACORN.          See, e.g., League of\nWomen Voters of Fla., 575 F.

Andrade I, 888\nF.Supp.2d at 845. In Crawford, however, the Supreme Court upheld Indiana’s\nvoter ID law under the Anderson/Burdick test despite the fact that were was “no\nevidence of any [impersonation] fraud actually occurring in Indiana at any time\nin its history.” Crawford, 553 U.S. at 196, 128 S. Ct. at 1619. Here, as in\nCrawford, Texas need not show specific local evidence of fraud in order to justify\npreventive measures. See also Munro v. Socialist Workers Party, 479 U.S. 189,\n195–96, 107 S. Ct. 533, 537–38 (1986) (“Legislatures . . . should be permitted to\nrespond to potential deficiencies in the electoral process with foresight rather\nthan reactively . . . .”).6\n       Texas’s chosen means to avert fraudulent voter registrations by requiring\nstate residency and county appointment for VDRs is sufficiently tailored.\nCompliance with voter registration regulations begins at the county level, where\nVDRs are approved, trained, and if need be, disciplined. After qualifying in one\ncounty, a VDR may perfunctorily qualify to serve in other counties. Multi-county\nqualification enables oversight of the VDR while eliminating the potential\ncomplications of registering voters in metropolitan areas covering several\ncounties. Requiring that VDRs be state residents is obviously important to\nmaintaining any credible possibility of prosecution for registration-related\noffenses. Election law violations typically carry low penalties and are hard to\n\n\n       6\n         Of course, election fraud was not unknown in Texas history, the most prominent\nexample being the 1948 election for the United States Senate. See Randall B. Woods, LBJ:\nArchitect of American Ambition 214 (2006) (“There is little doubt that fraud was involved.”);\nRobert A. Caro, Means of Ascent 328-29 (1990) (describing list of 200 people—three of whom\nwere dead on the date of balloting—who were recorded as having voted, in alphabetical order\nby last name, for Lyndon Johnson at the close of polling in Precinct 13 in Jim Wells County).\n\n                                             20\n\f    Case: 12-40914    Document: 00512395979      Page: 21   Date Filed: 10/03/2013\n\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-40914\nprosecute against local violators. Requiring the state to authorize itinerant out-\nof-state VDRs could render enforcement ineffective. Cf. Buckley, 525 U.S. at\n196, 119 S. Ct. at 644 (not reaching the issue, but explaining the Tenth Circuit\nupheld a state residency requirement for petition circulators because it “more\nprecisely achieved” the objective of making them eligible for subpoena and\nenforcement). We conclude that Texas’s interest in preventing voter registration\nfraud is “sufficiently weighty to justify the limitation[s]” on Appellees’ voter\nregistration activities imposed by the Non-Resident and County provisions.\nCrawford, 553 U.S. at 191, 128 S. Ct. at 1616 (internal quotation and citation\nomitted); see also League of Women Voters of Fla., 575 F.Supp.2d at 1325\n(concluding that Florida’s interests in preventing fraud justify restrictions on\norganizations’ voter registration drive activities).\n      The dissent disagrees with our analysis that disaggregates the advocacy\nfor voter registration from the mere mechanics of registration performed by\nVDRs. According to the dissent, this mode conflicts with Meyer, where the Court\ninvalidated Colorado’s prohibition of paid petition circulators. The dissent\nquotes Colorado’s argument in brief that because petition circulators were the\nsole parties responsible for the act of validating voters’ signatures, their role\nshould not receive First Amendment protection. Brief for Appellants, Meyer,\n486 U.S. 414 (No. 87-920), 1987 WL 880992, at *12.1. Judge Davis emphasizes\nthat the Supreme Court rejected Colorado’s argument while characterizing all\npetition-related expressive conduct as core political speech.      Post at _____\n(quoting Meyer, 486 U.S. at 421-22, 108 S. Ct. at 1892). This reasoning draws\nthe wrong lessons from Meyer.\n\n\n\n\n                                        21\n\f    Case: 12-40914        Document: 00512395979           Page: 22      Date Filed: 10/03/2013\n\n\n\n\n                                        No. 12-40914\n       Although Meyer characterizes the advocacy required in petition circulation\nas core political speech, Meyer and Buckley also engage in detailed, fact-specific\nanalysis of the impact of specific regulations on the furtherance of petition\nsponsors’ advocacy.7 First, in Meyer, unlike this case, the payment prohibition\ndeprived petition sponsors of a full opportunity to spread their views. Second,\nboth cases recognize, explicitly or implicitly, the propriety of various regulations\nconcerning even this core political speech—minimum age and affidavit of\nresidency for circulators; criminal penalties related to false or purchased\nsignatures; printed warnings on the petitions; sponsor and payment disclosures.\nFinally, Meyer acknowledges that the risk of improper conduct during petition\ncirculation is less than in petition balloting, and the risk in petition balloting is\nless than in candidate elections. Meyer, 486 U.S. at 427–28, 108 S. Ct. at 1885,\nquoting First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765, 790, 98 S. Ct.\n1407, 1423 (1978).\n       In sum, contrary to the dissent, we find Meyer and Buckley distinguishable\nfactually, indicative of nuanced analysis mandated in this type of case, and\nhighly suggestive that state regulation to counter voter registration fraud should\nnot be hastily overturned.            What the dissent ultimately neglects is that\ncontrolling cases require the “hard judgments” that are common to ordinary\nlitigation, and not a “litmus-paper test.” Anderson, 460 U.S. at 789, 103 S.

As earlier explained, the\nResidence and County Provisions, unlike the rules at issue in Meyer and\n\n       7\n         Meyer quotes at length from the testimony of a petition circulator: “The way we go\nabout soliciting signatures is that you ask the person . . . ‘Are you a registered voter?’ If you\nget a yes, then you tell the person your purpose, that you are circulating a petition to qualify\nthe issue on the ballot in November . . . .”) (emphasis in original). Meyer, 486 U.S. at 422, n.4,\n108 S. Ct. at 1892, n.4.\n\n                                               22\n\f    Case: 12-40914        Document: 00512395979      Page: 23   Date Filed: 10/03/2013\n\n\n\n\n                                      No. 12-40914\nBuckley, do not infringe in any way on the communicative, interpersonal aspect\nof voter registration drives. But even if they do infringe on First Amendment\nrights, the Texas provisions fulfill a vital role in securing the integrity of the\nvoter registration process and are a tailored response to the task. As a result,\nAppellees’ First Amendment challenge cannot prevail.\n          2.    Compensation Provision\n          The Compensation Provision of the Texas Election Code, § 13.008(a),\ncreates offenses if a person:\n          (1) compensates another person based on the number of voter registrations\nthat the other person successfully facilitates;\n          (2) presents another person with a quota of voter registrations to facilitate\nas a condition of payment or employment;\n          (3) engages in another practice that causes another person’s compensation\nfrom or employment status with the person to be dependent on the number of\nvoter registrations that the other person facilitates; or\n          (4) accepts compensation for an activity described by Subdivision (1), (2)\nor (3).\nRecognizing that these provisions are potentially overbroad, Steen interprets\nsubdivisions (2) and (3) of the Compensation Provision to ban (1) paying\ncanvassers on a per-application basis and (2) conditioning payment or\nemployment solely on the submission of a fixed number of applications.8 More\nprecisely, according to Steen, subdivision (a)(2) applies only when a quota is\n“present[ed]” to a canvasser, while subdivision (a)(3) applies to any different\n\n\n\n          8\n         That subdivisions (1) and (4) are constitutional devices to prevent fraudulent\nregistrations is not disputed.\n\n                                            23\n\f   Case: 12-40914     Document: 00512395979       Page: 24    Date Filed: 10/03/2013\n\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-40914\n(“another”) situation when employment is conditioned solely on a quota that has\nnot been presented to the canvasser.\n      Federal courts are required to accept a narrowing construction of a state\nlaw in order to preserve its constitutionality. See Frisby v. Schultz, 487 U.S.\n474, 483, 108 S. Ct. 2495, 2502 (1988) (construing a town ordinance “more\nnarrowly” in part because “[t]his narrow reading is supported by representations\nof counsel for the town at oral argument”); Bellotti v. Baird, 428 U.S. 132, 143,\n96 S. Ct. 2857, 2864 (1976) (noting the importance of the interpretation given by\nthe officials charged with enforcing the statute); see also Ohio v. Akron Ctr. for\nReprod. Health, 497 U.S. 502, 514, 110 S. Ct. 2972, 2980 (1990) (“[W]here fairly\npossible,   courts   should   construe   a    statute   to   avoid   a   danger   of\nunconstitutionality.” (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).\n     The district court refused to accept the narrowing construction, reasoning\nthat it is plainly contradictory to the statutory language. Thus, the court held,\nif Steen’s construction is accepted, subdivision (a)(3) either superfluously\noverlaps subdivision (a)(2), or on its own, subdivision (a)(3) prevents the\nemployer from making traditional performance-based decisions about the\ncanvassers’ effectiveness. We disagree with these conclusions.\n      With respect to the district court’s opinion that Steen’s construction would\nrender subsection (a)(3) of the provision “superfluous,” subsection (a)(2) applies\nwhen someone “presents another person with a quota of voter registrations to\nfacilitate as a condition of payment or employment.” Tex. Elec. Code Ann.\n§ 13.008(a)(2) (emphasis added). Subsection (a)(3) applies when that fixed quota\nis used as the sole basis for determining compensation or employment,\nregardless whether it has been “presented” to the canvasser. Id. § 13.008(a)(3).\n\n\n                                         24\n\f    Case: 12-40914     Document: 00512395979      Page: 25    Date Filed: 10/03/2013\n\n\n\n\n                                   No. 12-40914\nAs such, Steen’s interpretation leaves the more comprehensive language of\n(a)(3) with plenty of work to do. Because the subsection readily lends itself to\nthis interpretation, the district court incorrectly disregarded it. Virginia v. Am.\nBooksellers Ass’n, Inc., 484 U.S. 383, 397, 108 S. Ct. 636, 646 (1988)\n(maintaining that statues “readily susceptible” to a narrowing construction will\nsurvive a First Amendment challenge).\n      The district court’s alternative interpretation is that (a)(3) overbroadly\nbans performance-based work reviews. Appellees contended that their\nemployment decisions are chilled (and thus the quantum of their speech\nburdened) because in managing canvassers’ work, they must inescapably tie\ndecisions for superior or subpar performance to the canvassers’ productivity in\nterms of voter registrations facilitated. The district court’s interpretation is\nplausible, but it is impermissible pursuant to the standards of deference we have\nearlier cited.\n     First, the district court failed to assess whether “a substantial number” of\nthe applications of (a)(2) and (a)(3) are unconstitutional, judged in relation to the\nprovision’s “plainly legitimate sweep.” This inquiry is required in a facial\nchallenge on First Amendment grounds under Stevens, 130 S. Ct. at 1587. The\nexistence of a wide swath of constitutional applications of the provision would\nsuffice to prevent a facial remedy. Citizens United v. Fed. Election Comm'n,\n558 U.S. 310, 331, 130 S. Ct. 876, 893 (distinguishing facial and as-applied\nchallenges by “the breadth of the remedy employed by the Court”); see also\n\n\n\n\n                                         25\n\f    Case: 12-40914       Document: 00512395979          Page: 26     Date Filed: 10/03/2013\n\n\n\n\n                                       No. 12-40914\nUnited States v. Treasury Employees, 513 U.S. 454, 477-78, 115 S. Ct. 1003, 130\n(1995) (contrasting “a facial challenge” with “a narrower remedy”).9\n\n   Second, the narrowing interpretation is not contradictory to the statute, and\nthe court was thus required to accept it for present purposes. Subdivision (a)(2)\nis premised on “presenting” a quota to the employee, a formulation that implies\ndirect contact in advance to warn the person of a “quid pro quota.” Subdivision\n(a)(3), making employment decisions “in another practice” “dependent” on the\nemployee’s number of voter registrations reasonably lends itself to decisions that\nare “solely dependent” on that number. Employers are familiar, through Title\nVII discrimination law, with the difference between “sole” motive and “mixed\nmotive” decision making.          Appellees cannot feign their inability to justify\nreasonable employment decisions on factors other than or in addition to the\nnumber of registrations a canvasser produces. Moreover, as a criminal statute\nsusceptible to more than one interpretation, this provision’s enforcement would\nhave to be construed with lenity. See Tex. Elec. Code Ann. § 13.008(b). The rule\nof lenity reinforces the state’s proffered narrowing interpretation. Finally,\nTexas’s strong severability statute, which preserves statutes even if in some\n“applications” they are unconstitutional, clearly applies to the hypothetical\nsituations Appellees invoked. Tex. Gov’t Code Ann. § 311.032(c). Severability\nis a state law issue that binds federal courts. See Leavitt v. Jane L., 518 U.S.\n137, 139, 116 S. Ct. 2068, 2069 (1996).\n\n\n\n       9\n          Steen’s reply brief crystallizes its narrowing interpretation: “Section 13.008 allows\nemployers to fire cavassers for shirking and instruct them to increase their productivity. It\nprohibits only employment decisions made solely on the basis of the number of applications\nfacilitated. Employers may consider the number of applications facilitated as part of a\ncontextualized evaluation of a canvasser’s performance.”\n\n                                              26\n\f   Case: 12-40914     Document: 00512395979     Page: 27   Date Filed: 10/03/2013\n\n\n\n\n                                 No. 12-40914\n      As we must accept the state’s narrowing construction of the Compensation\nProvision, we turn to the merits.       Because the provision applies to all\npersons–not just VDRs–and covers any activity that facilitates voter\nregistration, it encompasses activities that involve expression, including voter\ndrives where canvassers seek to persuade eligible voters to register. Further, we\nassume, without deciding, that prohibiting quota-based pay is a “lesser burden,”\nnot subject to strict scrutiny. Prete v. Bradbury, 438 F.3d 949, 963 (9th Cir.\n2006) (assessing ban on tying compensation to number of signatures obtained for\na petition as a lesser burden); Jaeger, 241 F.3d at 617–18 (declining to apply\nstrict scrutiny to statute banning payment per petition signature procured); see\nalso Person v. N.Y. State Bd. of Elections, 467 F.3d 141, 143 (2d Cir. 2006)\n(finding that statute prohibiting payment of electoral petition signature\ngatherers on a per-signature basis does not, by itself,       violate the First\nAmendment).      Appellees have not made a strong showing that their facial\nchallenge will prevail because the Compensation Provision can apply\nconstitutionally to proscribe quotas or compensation incentives that reward\ncanvassers solely for turning in a very high number of applications, which all\nparties agree can encourage fraud. Texas has a strong legitimate interest in\npreventing fraud.    Buckley, 525 U.S. at 204–05, 119 S. Ct. at 648.         The\nCompensation Provision was enacted in part to rectify deficiencies in the\nprevious law that created incentives, such as paying canvassers for each\napplication, that resulted in voter registration scandals. See Follow the Money,\nsupra; Tex. Elec. Comm. Rep. on H.B. 239, 82d Leg. (2011) (“In many of the\nscandals, the convicted individuals specifically cited the compensation or\n\n\n\n\n                                       27\n\f    Case: 12-40914      Document: 00512395979         Page: 28    Date Filed: 10/03/2013\n\n\n\n\n                                     No. 12-40914\nperformance quotas as the incentive to fraudulently complete voter registration\nforms.”).\n\n       Nevertheless, the district court faulted the Compensation Provision for\nbeing stricter than laws in other states, particularly since there is no indication\nthat Texas is more susceptible to voter registration fraud.                  Andrade I,\n888 F.Supp.2d at 852. This criticism is unwarranted; neither the uniqueness\nof an election law nor the state-wide prevalence of the type of fraud a law seeks\nto prevent has any bearing on its constitutionality. See Crawford, 553 U.S. at\n195, 128 S. Ct. at 1619 (upholding Indiana’s unique voter-ID law as a legitimate\nmeans to combat election fraud, despite no evidence of impersonation fraud in\nIndiana). In addition, the district court’s and Appellees’ analogies to Meyer,\nsupra, and Citizens for Tax Reform v. Deters, 518 F.3d 375 (6th Cir. 2008), are\ninapposite. Unlike the laws struck down in those cases, the Compensation\nProvision does not completely ban third-party organizations from compensating\ncanvassers or only permit them to pay hourly wages. To deter fraud, (a)(3)\nmerely prevents organizations from making compensation and employment\ndecisions solely based on a fixed number of applications.10\n\n       We conclude that the Compensation Provision, as narrowly construed,\ndoes not violate the First Amendment. It is unnecessary to address Steen’s\nabstention argument. Accordingly, Appellees have not demonstrated a likelihood\nof success on the merits of this claim.\n\n\n\n\n       10\n          To the extent Appellees attempted to present an as-applied challenge to this\nprovision, we agree with and adopt the analysis of the motions panel majority that rejected\ntheir contention. See Andrade II, 488 F. App’x at 901.\n\n                                            28\n\f     Case: 12-40914   Document: 00512395979      Page: 29   Date Filed: 10/03/2013\n\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-40914\nB.     NVRA\n\n       Under the Constitution’s Election Clause, Congress may enact laws that\npreempt state election laws concerning federal elections. See Foster v. Love,\n522 U.S. 67, 69, 118 S. Ct. 464, 466 (1977). When it does, the federal legislation\nrenders any conflicting state laws inoperative. See Ex parte Siebold, 100 U.S.\n371, 384 (1879). “To this end, state election laws cannot ‘directly conflict’ with\nfederal election laws on the subject.” Andrade II, 488 F. App’x at 896 (citing\nVoting Integrity Project, Inc. v. Bomer, 199 F.3d 773, 775 (5th Cir. 2000)).\nAgainst this background, we examine whether the challenged provisions of the\nVDR Law conflict with the NVRA and require preemption.\n\n       Photocopying Provision\n\n       The NVRA mandates that “[e]ach State shall maintain for at least 2 years\nand shall make available for public inspection and, where available,\nphotocopying at a reasonable cost, all records concerning the implementation of\nprograms and activities conducted for the purpose of ensuring the accuracy and\ncurrency of official lists of eligible voters.” 42 U.S.C. § 1973gg-6(i)(1). The\nPhotocopying Provision states that a VDR “may distribute voter registration\napplication forms throughout the county and receive registration applications\nsubmitted to the deputy in person.”         Tex. Elec. Code Ann. § 38.038.     As\ninterpreted by Steen, this provision limits VDRs’ conduct to collecting and\ndelivering completed applications and implicitly precludes photocopying.\n\n       Appellees contend that because completed voter registration applications\nin the possession of VDRs are “public records,” the restriction against\nphotocopying them violates the NVRA. However, Appellees disregard a crucial\ndistinction: the NVRA only pertains to records “maintain[ed]” by the State,\n\n                                       29\n\f   Case: 12-40914       Document: 00512395979     Page: 30   Date Filed: 10/03/2013\n\n\n\n\n                                   No. 12-40914\nwhile the Photocopying Provision only applies to voter registration applications\nin the hands of VDRs, before they are officially received or maintained by the\nState.     For this reason, the district court misplaced reliance on Project\nVote/Voting for America, Inc. v. Long, 682 F.3d 331 (4th Cir. 2012), a case that\nspecifically addressed the denial of access to voter registration applications in\nthe government’s long-term possession, rather than those in the hands of VDRs.\nThe question here is not whether such applications will be made available for\nphotocopying but how. Thus, we disagree with the district court’s reasoning that\nthe applications received and delivered by VDRs are within the “constructive\npossession” of the state. For one thing, this conclusion is not supported by any\nstatutory text and is contrary to state law prohibiting VDRs from “maintaining”\nthe applications. Tex. Elec. Code Ann. § 13.038 (deputizing VDRs to receive and\ndeliver voter registration applications, not to “maintain” them for the state);\n§ 13.042(b) (requiring VDRs to deliver the voter registration applications to the\ncounty within five days).       Moreover, allowing VDRs indiscriminately to\nphotocopy registration applications places at risk the private information, e.g.,\nsocial security numbers, they contain, because Steen and counties have limited\nmeans to enforce privacy protections against temporary volunteers. Because the\nNVRA and Texas law do not conflict, Appellees cannot              prevail in this\npreemption claim.\n\n         Personal Delivery Provision\n\n         The NVRA requires states to “accept and use” a federal voter registration\napplication sent through the United States mail. 42 U.S.C. § 1973gg-4(a)(1).\nThe Personal Delivery Provision mandates that VDRs deliver completed voter\nregistration applications to the county registrar in person. Tex. Elec. Code Ann.\n\n                                         30\n\f   Case: 12-40914     Document: 00512395979     Page: 31   Date Filed: 10/03/2013\n\n\n\n\n                                 No. 12-40914\n§ 13.042(a). State law neither prevents prospective voters from mailing in their\nvoter registration applications nor prohibits counties from accepting those\napplications. Significantly, county registrars must accept every application\nreceived by mail, even those sent by VDRs in violation of the Personal Delivery\nProvision. See Tex. Elec. Code Ann. §§ 13.071–.072. These facts differentiate\nTexas law from the Supreme Court’s recent decision in Arizona v. InterTribal of\nArizona, 133 S. Ct. 2247 (2013), in which the Court overturned, as inconsistent\nwith the NVRA, the imposition of additional conditions by the state on its\nacceptance of voter registrations. Also distinguishable is Charles H. Wesley\nEduc. Found., Inc., v. Cox, 408 F.3d 1349, 1354–55 (11th Cir. 2005), where the\nEleventh Circuit rejected Georgia’s argument that the state could refuse to\naccept voter registration applications mailed by third-party organizations that\ndid not meet additional state requirements. Moreover, as the court emphasized,\nthe NVRA “simply requires that valid registration forms delivered by mail and\npostmarked in time be processed.”       Id. at 1355.   Texas law ensures this\nrequirement is met. Because the laws do not conflict, Appellees have failed to\ndemonstrate a substantial likelihood that the Personal Delivery Provision is\npreempted by the NVRA.\n\n                                CONCLUSION\n\n      Appellees have not made a clear showing that they are likely to succeed\nin demonstrating that the challenged provisions of the VDR Law violate their\nFirst Amendment rights or are preempted by the NVRA. Consequently, it is\nunnecessary to address the remaining elements required for preliminary\ninjunctive relief. La Union Del Pueblo Entero v. Fed. Emergency Mgmt. Agency,\n608 F.3d 217, 225 (5th Cir. 2010).

The enjoined\nprovisions are described as follows:\n\n           (1) Texas Election Code § 13.031(d)(3) to the extent it forbids\n      non-Texas residents from serving as volunteer deputy registrars\n      (“VDRs”) (the “Non-Resident Provision”);\n\n\n           (2) Texas Election Code § 13.038 to the extent it prohibits\n      VDRs appointed in one county from serving in another county (the\n      “County Provision”);\n\n\n          (3) Texas Election Code § 13.008(a)(2) & (3) (the\n      “Compensation Provision”);\n\n\n            (4) Texas Election Code § 13.038 to the extent it prohibits\n      VDRs from photocopying or scanning voter registration applications\n      submitted to the VDR but not yet delivered to the county registrar\n      (so long as no information deemed confidential under § 13.004 is\n      included) (the “Photocopying Provision”); and\n\n\n           (5) Texas Election Code § 13.042 to the extent it prohibits\n      VDRs from sending completed voter registration applications via\n      United States mail (the “Personal Delivery Provision”).\n\n      The district court, following a lengthy evidentiary hearing and extensive\nbriefing, held that the Non-Resident Provision, the County Provision, and the\n\n                                       33\n\f    Case: 12-40914    Document: 00512395979       Page: 34    Date Filed: 10/03/2013\n\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-40914\n\nCompensation Provision unconstitutionally interfere with the plaintiffs’ rights\nunder the First Amendment and the Photocopying Provision and the Personal\nDelivery Provision are preempted by the National Voter Registration Act\n(“NVRA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 1973gg et seq.\n\n      In its opinion, the majority concludes that the plaintiffs’ activities affected\nby the Non-Resident Provision and the County Provision are not protected\nspeech and, after accepting an interpretation of the Compensation Provision that\nis textually unsupportable, finds that the provision does not interfere with the\nplaintiffs’ First Amendment rights. The majority also disagrees with the district\ncourt’s conclusion that the Photocopying Provision and the Personal Delivery\nProvision are preempted by the NVRA.\n\n      My difference with the majority, in general, is two twofold: first, in my\nview the majority takes an unsupportably restrictive view of the scope of\nplaintiffs’ activity to register voters that is protected by the First Amendment.\nThe majority also ignores clear conflicts between two provisions of the Texas\nElection Code and the NVRA. In short, I would affirm the district court’s\nthorough, well-reasoned opinion.\n\n                                         I.\n\n                               First Amendment\n\n      My disagreement with my colleagues’ treatment of this case rests in large\npart on how the majority slices and dices the activities involved in the plaintiffs’\nvoter registration drives instead of considering those activities in the aggregate.\nOrdinarily, when Project Vote and Voting for America set up a voter registration\ndrive, they cooperate with local organizations in the targeted area, while\n\n\n                                         34\n\f    Case: 12-40914    Document: 00512395979       Page: 35   Date Filed: 10/03/2013\n\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-40914\n\nmaintaining control of the process.       They hire canvassers from the local\ncommunity, but also rely on experienced canvassers and organizers from out of\nstate to manage the drive, train employees, and demonstrate proper techniques\nfor voter registration. Once trained, the canvassers are deployed throughout the\ntargeted community to attempt to persuade eligible voters to register to vote.\nCanvassers raise issues of local importance and stress that voting is a forum for\nvoters to voice their views. If the canvasser is successful, he provides a blank\napplication to the applicant and assists in completing the form. The canvasser\nthen collects the completed form and returns it to the organization, where it is\nreviewed for completeness and signs of fraud. The non-confidential portions of\nthe application are then scanned or photocopied for tracking purposes and then\ndelivered to the appropriate registrar. The plaintiffs use the photocopy to follow\nup with the registrar to verify that the registration application has been\nprocessed and the applicant added to the voting rolls. If not, the plaintiffs follow\nup as needed to correct the situation. At election time, the plaintiffs urge the\nnewly registered voters to actually vote and may provide transportation\nassistance to the voting area.\n\n      The Secretary and the majority concede that “some voter registration\nactivities involve speech – ‘urging’ citizens to register; ‘distributing’ voter\nregistration forms; ‘helping’ voters fill out their forms; and ‘asking’ for\ninformation to verify that registrations were processed successfully.” However,\nthe majority draws a line between these portions of the voter registration drive\nthey must concede are protected and all the other activity which they dismiss\nas outside the protection of the First Amendment and simply the administrative\nprocess of collecting and handling voter registration forms. In the words of the\n\n\n                                        35\n\f    Case: 12-40914    Document: 00512395979       Page: 36   Date Filed: 10/03/2013\n\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-40914\n\nmajority, “[o]ne does not ‘speak’ in this context by handling another person’s\n‘speech,’” i.e., the voter registration application, which is the voter’s “speech.”\nIn the majority’s view, all of the plaintiffs’ activities that occur after the voter\ncompletes the registration application are not speech. This would include\nprocessing the application and checking it for errors, submitting it to the\nappropriate registrar, following up to ensure that the application was processed\nand the applicant added to the voting rolls, and encouraging the voter to\nparticipate in subsequent elections.\n\n      Two Supreme Court cases applying First Amendment protections to laws\nregulating parties engaged in similar activities reject the majority’s line-\ndrawing. In Buckley v. American Constitutional Law Foundation, Inc., 525 U.S.\n182 (1999), the Court struck down Colorado’s requirements that those collecting\nsignatures for a ballot initiative wear a badge and be registered Colorado voters.\nIn Meyer v. Grant, 486 U.S. 414 (1988), the Court struck down Colorado’s ban on\npaying petition circulators. As the district court pointed out, it could have been\nsaid in Buckley and Meyer “that the invalidated regulations did not prevent\nanyone from actually speaking to another citizen in an attempt to persuade her\nto sign a petition; rather, the regulations just governed the act of collecting the\nsignatures.” The Supreme Court rejected that distinction.\n\n      In Meyer, Colorado argued to the Supreme Court that the statute banning\npaid petition circulators (much as Texas does in this case) did not implicate\nspeech. Colorado argued:\n\n      [T]he petition circulator [is] the person with the public duty to\n      determine the validity of the signatures of the persons who sign the\n      petitions. . . . The verification of signatures does not constitute\n      speech, and the prohibition against payment of petition circulators\n\n                                        36\n\f    Case: 12-40914    Document: 00512395979       Page: 37   Date Filed: 10/03/2013\n\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-40914\n\n      constitutes nothing more than the prohibition against payment for\n      the act of verifying signatures. The fact that a person voluntarily\n      links his conduct with a speech component does not transform the\n      conduct into speech.\nBrief for Appellants, Meyer, 486 U.S. 414 (No. 87-920), 1987 WL 880992, at *12.\nThe Supreme Court rejected this argument and concluded that petition\ncirculation involves “interactive communication concerning political change that\nis appropriately described as ‘core political speech.’” Meyer, 486 U.S. at 421-22.\nImportantly, the Court did not isolate and limit the scope of its definition of core\npolitical speech to the verbal exchange between the petition circulator and the\nperson whose signature was being solicited. Instead, it considered the\nsolicitation activity in the aggregate as core speech. Specifically, the court in\nMeyer concluded that Colorado’s ban on paid petition circulators impermissibly\nimplicated the First Amendment by restricting political expression. The Meyer\ncourt explained that this ban restricted core speech because it limited the voices\navailable to convey the message and therefore reduced the size of the audience\nthat the canvassers could reach, making it less likely the campaign would be\nsuccessful.\n      Similarly, in Buckley, the Supreme Court rejected Colorado’s argument\nthat collection of signatures was a ministerial act performed on behalf of the\nstate and therefore state regulations requiring canvassers to be Colorado\nregistered voters and wear badges did not implicate the First Amendment. As\nJustice Thomas explained in his concurrence,\n\n      Even where a State’s law does not directly regulate core political\n      speech, we have applied strict scrutiny . . . because we have\n      determined that initiative petition circulation of necessity involves\n\n\n\n                                        37\n\f    Case: 12-40914    Document: 00512395979       Page: 38   Date Filed: 10/03/2013\n\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-40914\n\n      both the expression of a desire for political change and a discussion\n      of the merits of the proposed change.\n\n\nBuckley, 525 U.S. at 207 (Thomas, J., concurring). Thus, even though the\nColorado regulation in Buckley did not directly regulate speech, the\nrequirements that solicitors wear a badge and be Colorado registered voters\nwere offensive in the same way the ban on paid circulators was in Meyer. Both\nregulations reduced the voices available to convey political messages. Id. at 210.\n\n      The Non-Resident Provision, the County Provision, and the Compensation\nProvision all limit who can participate in voter registration drives. As explained\nin more detail below, these provisions, like those in Buckley and Meyer, limit the\nnumber of voices available to convey the plaintiffs’ message. The majority\nproposes methods by which the plaintiffs could organize their voter registration\ndrives to reduce the effect of these regulations. But judges are not experts in\nconducting voter registration drives and the Supreme Court made it clear in\nMeyer that “[t]he First Amendment protects appellees’ right not only to advocate\ntheir cause but also to select what they believe to be the most effective means for\nso doing.” 486 U.S. at 424.\n\n      In Meyer and Buckley, as in this case, the plaintiffs were advocates seeking\nto collect signatures (and verify them) as part of core democratic activity. More\nparticularly, the activity in Meyer and Buckley was to persuade as many voters\nas possible to approve a referendum initiative to be placed on the ballot. This\nrequired circulators to collect signatures on a petition, verify the signatures, and\ndeliver the petition to the appropriate state official. In our case the activity is\nto persuade as many citizens as possible to participate in the democratic process.\n\n\n                                        38\n\f    Case: 12-40914    Document: 00512395979      Page: 39   Date Filed: 10/03/2013\n\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-40914\n\nThe first step is registering voters. This requires persuading and assisting a\ncitizen to complete a voter application and ensure the delivery of the application\nto the appropriate registrar. Once the voter is registered, the plaintiffs urge\nregistered voters to cast their votes in scheduled elections. The speech rights of\nthe plaintiffs in this case seeking to influence citizens to participate in the\ndemocratic process are as strong or stronger than the plaintiffs’ rights in Meyer\nand Buckley. The First Amendment rights of the canvassers in Meyer and\nBuckley and the canvassers in this case are indistinguishable: The right to\nconduct their campaign without unjustified burdens “limits the number of voices\nwho will convey [plaintiffs’] message.” Meyer, 486 U.S. at 422; see also Citizens\nUnited v. Fed. Election Comm’n, 558 U.S. 310 (2010) (holding that federal\nelection laws prohibiting corporations and unions from using general treasury\nfunds to make independent expenditures for speech defined as “electioneering\ncommunication” or for speech expressly advocating the election or defeat of a\ncandidate is unconstitutional suppression of political speech).\n\n      The Supreme Court has a long line of cases holding that restrictions on\nexpressive conduct, other than pure speech, may implicate the First\nAmendment. See, e.g., Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 404-06 (1989) (flag\nburning); Tinker v. Des Moines Indep. Cmty. Sch. Dist., 393 U.S. 503, 505 (1969)\n(arm bands to protest the Vietnam War); Brown v. Louisiana, 383 U.S. 131, 141-\n42 (1966) (sit-ins to protest segregation). The plaintiffs’ conduct in this case is\ninherently expressive of their message of increasing citizen participation in the\ndemocratic process. Rumsfield v. Forum for Academic & Institutional Rights,\nInc., 547 U.S. 47, 66 (2006).\n\n\n\n                                        39\n\f    Case: 12-40914    Document: 00512395979       Page: 40   Date Filed: 10/03/2013\n\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-40914\n\n      Also, the majority’s effort to slice the various portions of the registration\neffort into protected and unprotected activity ignores the fact that plaintiffs’\nregistration activity implicates not only their speech rights, it also implicates\ntheir freedom of association. Both are equally protected by the First\nAmendment. The plaintiffs’ activities do not cease when the voter registration\napplication is complete. The plaintiffs receive and submit the application for\nprocessing and follow up with the registrar to ensure that the registration\napplication resulted in a registered voter. They also follow up with voters to\nencourage them to vote. The freedom of the plaintiffs to associate with others\nfor the advancement of common beliefs is protected by the First and Fourteenth\nAmendments. NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357 U.S. 449, 460 (1958);\nKusper v. Pontikes, 414 U.S. 51, 56-57 (1973).\n\n      As the Secretary concedes, nearly every federal court addressing this issue\nhas found that the expressive conduct of actually registering voters, to the extent\nseparable from the speech involved in persuading voters to register, is protected\nexpressive conduct of those conducting the voter registration drive. See, e.g.,\nAm. Ass’n of People with Disabilities v. Herrera, 690 F. Supp. 2d 1183, 1200\n(D.N.M. 2010) (“In short, to participate in voter registration is to take a position\nand express a point of view in the ongoing debate whether to engage or to\ndisengage from the political process. The Court concludes that the act of voter\nregistration is expressive conduct worthy of First-Amendment protection.”);\nProject Vote v. Blackwell, 455 F. Supp. 2d 694, 702 (N.D. Ohio 2006) (“[T]he\nCourt is satisfied that participation in voter registration implicates a number of\nboth expressive and associational rights which are protected by the First\nAmendment. These rights belong to – and may be invoked by – not just the\n\n\n                                        40\n\f    Case: 12-40914      Document: 00512395979        Page: 41     Date Filed: 10/03/2013\n\n\n\n\n                                     No. 12-40914\n\nvoters seeking to register, but by third parties who encourage participation in\nthe political process through increasing voter registration rolls.”).\n\n      If you start from what I believe is the correct baseline – that under the\nSupreme Court’s precedent, the plaintiffs’ entire voter registration activity is\nprotected core political speech – then “the question is not whether Plaintiffs’\nconduct comes within the protections of the First Amendment, but whether\nDefendants have regulated such conduct in a permissible way.” League of\nWomen Voters v. Cobb, 447 F. Supp. 2d 1314, 1334 (S.D. Fla. 2006). Assuming\nwithout deciding that the district court correctly applied the Anderson-Burdick\nbalancing test to this question,1 I am satisfied that the district court correctly\nweighed the effect of each regulation on the plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights\nagainst the justifications raised by the state to conclude that the plaintiffs were\nentitled to a preliminary injunction barring enforcement of the above listed\nprovisions. I consider briefly below the individual provisions of the Texas\nElection Code plaintiffs challenge in this case.\n\n                         A. The Non-Resident Provision\n\n      The Non-Resident Provision, one of the provisions under review in the\nTexas Election Code, provides that only a Texas resident may be appointed as\na VDR. See TEX. ELEC. CODE ANN. §§ 13.031(d)(3), 11.002(a)(5). Because only\nVDRs can handle or submit a registration application to the registrar, this\nregulation in effect makes it a crime for a non-resident to handle or submit a\nregistration application. The district court accepted the plaintiffs’ testimony\n\n\n\n      1\n          See Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780, 780-90 (1983); Burdick v. Takushi, 504\nU.S. 428, 434 (1992).\n\n                                           41\n\f    Case: 12-40914    Document: 00512395979       Page: 42     Date Filed: 10/03/2013\n\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-40914\n\nthat this prevented the out-of-state campaign organizer from using its managers\neffectively in troubleshooting and identifying problems and generally organizing\nthe campaign. Out-of-state managers cannot train, lead, demonstrate best\npractices, or perform quality control without ever touching an application - the\nregistration drives’ central tool for engaging voters.       The only state interest\nraised to justify the prohibition is the assertion that Texas residents will take\nbetter care of their fellow citizens’ registration forms than non-residents would.\nThe Secretary provides no authority or analysis to support this bold assertion.\nI agree with the district court that any state interest identified is not strong and\nthe regulation is not a narrowly tailored attempt to curtail any fraud that might\nbe associated with out-of-state canvassers. This restrictions flies directly into\nthe teeth of Buckley in which the Supreme Court struck down Colorado’s\nattempt to restrict petition circulators to registered voters of the state. The\nrestriction in this case, as in Buckley, limits the number of voices available to\nconvey plaintiffs’ message and, contrary to the conclusion of the majority, the\nplaintiffs have clearly demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of their\nchallenge to this provision.\n\n                          B. The County Provision\n\n      Texas Election Code § 13.038 provides that a VDR may distribute and\naccept applications for voter registration throughout the county in which he is\nqualified. As interpreted by the state of Texas, a VDR must be appointed in\nevery county in which an applicant resides so that a VDR who is appointed in\nCounty A yet submits an application for a citizen who resides in County B is\n\n\n\n\n                                        42\n\f    Case: 12-40914       Document: 00512395979          Page: 43     Date Filed: 10/03/2013\n\n\n\n\n                                       No. 12-40914\n\nsubject to criminal prosecution.2 The district court found that the plaintiffs had\ndemonstrated that the County Provision imposes heavy time and administrative\nburdens on their organizations. These rules force the organizations to have their\ncanvassers and managerial staff appointed as VDRs in multiple counties. This\nis especially burdensome in the larger metropolitan areas where voters may\nreside in one of several area counties. As pointed out by the district court, a\nVDR active in the City of Dallas would need to be appointed in five different\ncounties in order to accept applications in all parts of the city. Texas has 254\ncounties which magnifies the burden of this limitation. A VDR will not always\nknow in which county a potential voter resides simply by the fact that he is\npresent at a registration drive rally. Thus, the VDR in this situation risks\ncriminal sanctions for accepting a voter registration application from a resident\nof a county in which the VDR has not been appointed. It is obvious how this rule\nwould chill the plaintiffs’ registration activities.\n\n       The Secretary provided little justification for this rule. State, not county,\nlaws govern voter registration, so there are no county-specific issues relevant to\nVDR appointment. Although the Secretary argued that the County Provision\nhelps prevent fraud by making local county registrars more aware of VDR\nactivity in their counties, the registrars are made aware of the identity of the\nVDRs when they submit voter registration applications. See TEX. ELEC. CODE\nANN. §13.040 (VDRs must provide a receipt to the registrar with submitted voter\nregistration applications that identifies the county of their appointment). The\n\n\n\n       2\n          Although plaintiffs initially understood the rules to require VDRs to also be trained\nin every county in which they sought appointment, the state has interpreted the statutes to\nrequire training in only one county.\n\n                                              43\n\f   Case: 12-40914     Document: 00512395979      Page: 44   Date Filed: 10/03/2013\n\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-40914\n\ndistrict court correctly found that this provision violated plaintiffs’ First\nAmendment rights.\n\n                      C. The Compensation Provision\n\n      This provision subjects a campaign organizer, as employer, to criminal\nprosecution for compensating employees assisting in the campaign in a manner\nprohibited in this section. TEX. ELEC. CODE ANN. § 13.008. The Compensation\nProvision has three subparts: (1) a ban on “compensat[ing] another person based\non the number of voter registrations that the other person successfully\nfacilitates,” Id. § 13.008(a)(1); (2) a ban on “present[ing] another person with a\nquota of voter registrations to facilitate as a condition of payment or\nemployment,” Id. § 13.008(a)(2); and (3) a ban on “engag[ing] in any other\npractice that causes another person’s compensation from or employment status\nwith the person to be dependent on the number of voter registrations that the\nperson facilitates.” Id. § 13.008(a)(3). The plaintiffs do not challenge subpart\n(1). They contend, however, that the remaining provisions severely burden their\nability to conduct registration drives by preventing them from rewarding or\nsanctioning employees based on performance. They submit that the provisions\nexpose them to criminal sanctions if they either: (1) terminate or discipline a\ncanvasser who performs poorly; or (2) reward high performers by promoting\nthem or increasing their pay.\n\n      The Secretary interprets the provisions as only imposing criminal\nsanctions on an employer who pays canvassers on a per-application basis or\nconditions payment or employment solely on a preset quota. However, I agree\n\n\n\n\n                                       44\n\f    Case: 12-40914       Document: 00512395979         Page: 45     Date Filed: 10/03/2013\n\n\n\n\n                                      No. 12-40914\n\nwith the district court that this interpretation is inconsistent with the plain\nlanguage of the statute.3\n\n       Subparts (2) and (3) prohibit an employer from conditioning employment\non the number of applications collected or basing the employee’s compensation\non applications collected. These restrictions effectively subject the plaintiffs to\ncriminal sanctions for engaging in many common hiring and firing decisions.\nThe Secretary argues that neither provision precludes general consideration of\nan employee’s productivity. However, when the employee’s job is to gather voter\nregistration applications, the number of applications he obtains or facilitates is\nclearly an important measure of his productivity – a measure the Compensation\nProvision bars the plaintiffs from using as a basis for employment and\ncompensation decisions.\n\n       That these provisions hamper the voter registration activities of the\nplaintiffs is obvious. As the Sixth Circuit explained in striking down an Ohio\ncompensation prohibition that banned “pay[ing] any other person for collecting\nsignatures on election-related petitions or for registering voters except on the\nbasis of time worked”:\n\n       [W]hen petitioner’s means are limited to volunteers and to paid\n       hourly workers who cannot be rewarded for being productive and\n       arguably cannot be punished for being unproductive, they carry a\n       significant burden in exercising their right to core political speech.\nCitizens for Tax Reform v. Deters, 518 F.3d 375, 385-87 (6th Cir. 2008).\n\n\n\n\n       3\n         “[T]his Court may impose a limiting construction on a statute only if it is ‘readily\nsusceptible’ to such a construction.” United States v. Stevens, 130 S. Ct. 1577, 1591-1592\n(2010) (quoting Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. 844, 884 (1997)).\n\n                                             45\n\f    Case: 12-40914       Document: 00512395979    Page: 46   Date Filed: 10/03/2013\n\n\n\n\n                                   No. 12-40914\n\n      Again, the Secretary’s justification for this provision is the need to combat\nvoter registration fraud. The ban on paying compensation directly for each\napplication obtained serves this interest and the plaintiffs do not challenge that\nprovision.   However, the remaining provisions further the state interest\nminimally, if at all, and burden speech and association by banning commonly\naccepted employment practices such as performance evaluations, performance-\nbased pay, and the requirement of performance as a condition of employment.\nViolation of these provisions subject the employer to criminal prosecution and\nplace an undue burden on the plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights. In my\njudgment, the district court correctly enjoined enforcement of subparts (2) and\n(3) of this provision.\n\n                                        II.\n\n                         Preemption by the NVRA\n\n      The district court found that the remaining two provisions–the\nPhotocopying Provision and the Personal Delivery Provision–were preempted by\nthe NVRA. The majority concedes that state election law may not “directly\nconflict” with federal election laws on the subject. Voting Integrity Project, Inc.\nv. Bomer, 199 F.3d 773, 775 (5th Cir. 2000). The recent Supreme Court decision\nin Arizona v. Inter Tribal Council of Arizona, 133 S.Ct. 2247 (2013), held that\nthe state enjoys no presumption against preemption in election clause cases. Id.\nat 2256-57. Instead, we are instructed to interpret “Election Clause legislation\n. . . to mean what it says.” Id.\n\n                         A. The Photocopying Provision\n\n\n\n\n                                        46\n\f    Case: 12-40914           Document: 00512395979          Page: 47     Date Filed: 10/03/2013\n\n\n\n\n                                          No. 12-40914\n\n          With respect to the Photocopying Provision, plaintiffs challenge the\nSecretary’s interpretation of §13.038. The Secretary argues that the Texas\nElection Code prohibits VDRs from photocopying registration applications\nbecause state law does not explicitly authorize this activity and because these\ndocuments are considered confidential under § 13.004. The plaintiffs contend\n\nthat the NVRA’s public disclosure provision4 preempts the prohibition on\nphotocopying.\n\n          I agree with the district court that voter registration applications are\n“records concerning the implementation of programs and activities conducted for\nthe purpose of ensuring the accuracy and currency of official lists of eligible\nvoters” under the relevant provision of the NVRA. 42 U.S.C. § 1973gg-6(I);\nProject Vote/Voting for Am., Inc. v. Long, 682 F.3d 331, 340 (4th Cir. 2012).\nVDRs are deputized to act in the place of the county registrar when they\ndistribute and receive voter registration applications. TEX. ELEC. CODE ANN. §\n13. 031. Section 1973gg-6(I) does not require that the records be in the hands of\nthe state. It merely requires the state to maintain the records and make them\navailable for public inspection. The myriad of regulations governing VDRs are\n\n\n          4\n              The NVRA provision covering “Public disclosure of voter registration activities,”\nstates:\n          Each State shall maintain for at least 2 years and shall make available for\n          public inspection and, where available, photocopying at a reasonable cost, all\n          records concerning the implementation of programs and activities conducted for\n          the purpose of ensuring the accuracy and currency of official lists of eligible\n          voters, except to the extent that such records relate to a declination to register\n          to vote or to the identify of a voter registration agency through which any\n          particular voter is registered.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1973gg-6(I).\n\n                                                 47\n\f    Case: 12-40914    Document: 00512395979       Page: 48   Date Filed: 10/03/2013\n\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-40914\n\nbased on the assumption that the state has the ability to protect that application\nby regulating how it is handled until it is in the hands of the local registrar. In\ndoing so, the state (through the VDR) “maintains” the completed voter\nregistration applications until they are submitted to the local registrar. Thus,\na completed application in the hands of a VDR is a record that must be made\navailable for photocopying under the NVRA. I agree with the district court that\nit would be an absurd result to forbid private parties from copying applications\nthey are authorized to receive on behalf of the state before they are submitted\nto the state, when the NVRA requires the state to allow them to make a copy\nonce the record has been submitted.\n\n      The privacy concerns raised by the Secretary are also answered by the\nNVRA. As stated in Long, “[i]t is not the province of this court . . . to strike the\nproper balance between transparency and voter privacy . . . . Congress has\nalready answered the question by enacting [section 1973gg-6(I)], which plainly\nrequires disclosure of complete voter registration applications.” 682 F.3d at 339.\nThis conclusion is buttressed by the Supreme Court’s holding in Arizona that no\npresumption against preemption applies in these election clause cases.\n\n                     B. The Personal Delivery Provision\n\n      The Texas Election Code states that “[a] volunteer deputy registrar shall\ndeliver in person, or by personal delivery through another designated volunteer\ndeputy, to the registrar each completed voter registration application submitted\nto the deputy.” TEX. ELEC. CODE ANN. § 13.042(a). This section of the election\ncode prohibits VDRs from using U.S. mail to deliver the applications. Any VDR\nwho violates this ban is subject to criminal prosecution. Id. § 13.043.\n\n\n\n                                        48\n\f     Case: 12-40914     Document: 00512395979      Page: 49   Date Filed: 10/03/2013\n\n\n\n\n                                    No. 12-40914\n\n         Several provisions of the NVRA require states to allow voter registration\nby mail. 42 U.S.C. § 1973gg-4(a)(1) (“Each State shall accept and use the mail\nvoter registration application form prescribed . . . pursuant to section 1973gg-\n7(a)(2).”); 42 U.S.C. 1973gg-2(a)(2) (“[N]otwithstanding any other Federal or\nstate law, in addition to any other method of voter registration provided for\nunder State law, each State shall establish procedures to register to vote in\nElections for Federal office . . . by mail application pursuant to section 1973gg-4\n. . . . ”).\n\n         I agree with the district court that the Texas Election Code provision\npresents a clear and direct conflict with the NVRA. The NVRA makes no\ndistinction between applications submitted directly by a voter and those\nsubmitted by a third-party. The prospect of a criminal sanction effectively\nprevents the plaintiffs from using the mails to deliver applications to the\nregistrar.\n\n         Because of the patent conflict, I would find that the plaintiffs have shown\nthat they have a substantial likelihood of success on the merits on this issue and\nthat the district court correctly enjoined its enforcement.\n\n                                         III.\n\n         For the above reasons and those stated by the district court in its careful\nopinion, I am convinced that the plaintiffs have demonstrated a substantial\nlikelihood of success on the merits of each provision of the Texas Election Code\nthe district court enjoined the state from enforcing. No serious argument is\nadvanced that plaintiffs failed to establish the remaining factors for issuance of\nthe preliminary injunction–irreparable injury, balancing of harms, and the\n\n\n                                          49\n\f   Case: 12-40914     Document: 00512395979     Page: 50   Date Filed: 10/03/2013\n\n\n\n\n                                 No. 12-40914\n\npublic interest. For reasons advanced by the district court, I conclude that\nplaintiffs clearly established these factors. I would AFFIRM the district court’s\npreliminary injunction and therefore DISSENT from the majority’s contrary\nconclusion.\n\n\n\n\n                                       50\n\f",

The\npreliminary injunction is reversed and the case remanded for further\nproceedings.\n                                 I. Background\n      Steen administers the VDR Law, which regulates the appointment and\nactivities of volunteer deputy registrars (“VDRs”), individuals trained and\nempowered to receive and deliver completed voter registration applications.\nAfter Texas amended the VDR Law in 2011, Appellees requested Steen’s\ninterpretation of several provisions. Unsatisfied with the answers, Appellees\nfiled this lawsuit seeking injunctive relief on the basis that several provisions\nrestrict their ability to conduct voter registration drives in violation of the First\nAmendment and the NVRA.\n      In May 2012, Appellees moved for a preliminary injunction. After a\nhearing, the district court granted the motion in part, enjoining enforcement of\nthe following provisions of the VDR Law:\n            (1) Texas Election Code § 13.031(d)(3) to the extent it forbids\n      non-Texas residents from serving as VDRs (the “Non-Resident\n      Provision”);\n\n           (2) Texas Election Code § 13.038 to the extent it prohibits\n      VDRs appointed in one county from serving in another county (the\n      “County Provision”);\n\n          (3) Texas Election Code § 13.008(a)(2) & (3) (the\n      “Compensation Provision”);\n\n\n                                         2\n\f     Case: 12-40914      Document: 00512395979         Page: 3    Date Filed: 10/03/2013\n\n\n\n\n                                     No. 12-40914\n\n              (4) Texas Election Code § 13.038 to the extent it prohibits\n       VDRs from photocopying or scanning voter registration applications\n       submitted to the VDR but not yet delivered to the county registrar\n       (so long as no information deemed confidential under § 13.004 is\n       included) (the “Photocopying Provision”); and\n\n            (5) Texas Election Code § 13.042 to the extent it prohibits\n       VDRs from sending completed voter registration applications via\n       United States mail (the “Personal Delivery Provision”).2\n\n       Steen appealed and moved for a stay pending appeal, which the district\ncourt denied.

As these provisions have been interpreted by Steen, VDRs for each\ncounty exclusively are allowed to receive and deliver voter registration forms to\nthe county offices for processing.\n      Appellees contend that these limits on the scope of VDRs’ appointments\nprevent out-of-state-residents from acting as VDRs, inhibit the efficient\nfunctioning of voter registration drives, and truncate their ability to conduct the\ndrives in violation of the First Amendment. We adopt the analysis of the\nmotions panel majority rejecting these propositions, and recapitulate some of it\nhere, together with additional reasons. See Andrade II, 488 F. App’x at 897–900.\n      The state does not deny that some voter registration activities involve\nspeech—“urging” citizens to register; “distributing” voter registration forms;\n“helping” voters to fill out their forms; and “asking” for information to verify that\nregistrations were processed successfully. Texas neither regulates nor limits any\nof this constitutionally protected speech. The district court accepted these\nrepresentations, and so do we.\n      To establish their premise that the First Amendment protects what VDRs\ndo—collect, review for completeness, and deliver completed voter registration\nforms—Appellees must show why such conduct is inherently expressive or why\ntheir “speech” is inextricably entwined with such actions. From a practical\nstandpoint, the activities involved in a voter registration drive can be separated\nin a number of ways. For instance, experienced team leaders from out-of-state\ncould organize the drive and train canvassers, using local citizens as VDRs and\ncanvassers to complete and deliver the registration forms. Appellees in fact\ntestified that they prefer to use local citizens as VDRs or canvassers. Out-of-\nstate or out-of-county canvassers can participate anywhere, in any capacity,\nexcept to perform the functions exclusively ascribed to trained volunteer VDRs:\n\n                                          10\n\f    Case: 12-40914       Document: 00512395979    Page: 11   Date Filed: 10/03/2013\n\n\n\n\n                                   No. 12-40914\ncollecting, reviewing for completeness, issuing a receipt, and delivering the\ncompleted voter registration forms to a county office.

With an appropriate division of labor and organizational\nforethought, no participant in the drive need suffer a detriment of the ability to\nurge, advocate, interact, or persuade.\n      Put otherwise, while voter registration drives involve core protected\nspeech, they are factually distinct from the circulation of petitions addressed by\nthe Supreme Court in Meyer v.

Assuming a voter registration\napplication is speech, it is the voter’s speech indicating his desire to be\nregistered. Soliciting, urging and persuading the citizen to vote are the forms\nof the canvasser’s speech, but only the voter decides to “speak” by registering.\nLogically, what the VDR does with the voter’s form follows the voter’s\ncompletion of the application but is not itself “speech.” One does not “speak” in\nthis context by handling another person’s “speech.” As the state's brief observes,\nthe voter could refuse to return a registration application to the VDR and say,\n\"I'll mail it myself.\"\n      The motions panel majority made this point in a slightly different way:\n      At oral argument, Appellees urged the court to draw a close parallel\n      to the Supreme Court’s reasoning in Meyer, 486 U.S. at 422, finding\n      that the circulation of initiative petitions was a matter involving the\n      core political speech rights of the circulators under the First\n      Amendment. The analogy is improper. The circulation and\n      submission of an initiative petition is closely intertwined with the\n      underlying political ideas put forth by the petition. The petition\n      itself is the protected speech. Moreover, the very nature of a\n\n                                         11\n\f    Case: 12-40914    Document: 00512395979      Page: 12    Date Filed: 10/03/2013\n\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-40914\n      petition process requires association between the third-party\n      circulator and the individuals agreeing to sign. In the voter\n      registration context, the underlying expressive conduct (encouraging\n      democratic participation and voting) does not implicate a third-\n      party’s right to process the application. Voter registration\n      applications are individual, not associational, and may be\n      successfully submitted without the aid of another. Here, the actual\n      expression is not being limited.\n\nAndrade II, 488 F. App’x at 898 n.13 (emphasis added).\n      Buckley and Meyer are further distinguishable because those cases\ninvolved laws that specifically regulated the process of advocacy itself, dictating\nwho could speak (only unpaid circulators and registered voters) or how to go\nabout speaking (with name badges and subsequent detailed reports). Thus, the\nColorado law had “the inevitable effect of reducing the total quantum of speech,”\nlimiting “the number of voices who will convey [Plaintiffs’] message and the\nhours they can speak and, therefore, limit[ing] the size of the audience they can\nreach.” Meyer, 486 U.S. at 422–23, 108 S. Ct. at 1892. The motions panel\nmajority aptly responded to the claim that the Texas provisions are\nunconstitutional for the same reason:\n      This argument simply does not apply. No party argues that the law\n      prevents anyone, regardless of domicile or VDR appointment, from\n      passing out registration forms and encouraging others to vote. The\n      size of the audience remains the same, and the “total quantum of\n      speech” is unaffected. While affirming the striking down of some\n      provisions of Colorado law in Buckley, the Court recognized an\n      “important interest” of the state in protecting the integrity of the\n      ballot initiative process there at issue and in deterring fraud.\n      525 U.S. at 204–05.\nAndrade II, 488 F.

Cf. Herrera, 690 F.Supp.2d\nat 1218 (noting that New Mexico would not violate the Constitution if all voter registration\nwere conducted through government officials).\n\n                                              13\n\f    Case: 12-40914       Document: 00512395979          Page: 14     Date Filed: 10/03/2013\n\n\n\n\n                                       No. 12-40914\nfor instance, the act of burning the American flag indicated the speaker’s\ncontempt for the Republican Party’s renomination of Ronald Reagan for\nPresident. The conduct was the message. But if actually registering citizens to\nvote is necessary to “express” the canvasser’s belief in the importance of voting,\nthen Appellees essentially seek a “First Amendment right not just to speak out\nor engage in ‘expressive conduct’ but also to succeed in their ultimate goal\nregardless of any other considerations.” Andrade II, 488 F. App’x at 898. Only\ntwo possibilities flow from this reasoning. As the motions panel majority\nsuggests, throwing voter registration forms in the trash would have to be\nconstitutionally protected expressive conduct. Id. at 898 n.14.5 But cf. Tex. Elec.\nCode Ann. § 13.043 (failure of a VDR to deliver completed applications is an\noffense). Alternatively, and more sensibly, one must concede that supporting\nvoter registration is the canvasser’s speech, while actually completing the forms\nis the voter’s speech, and collecting and delivering the forms are merely conduct.\n       Appellees urged that these limits on who may be VDRs and what they may\ndo will interfere with Appellees’ ability to conduct large-scale voter registration\n\n\n       5\n          One clear principle that can be derived from the long line of election-related speech\ncases is that the degree of protection afforded under the First Amendment does not vary in\naccordance with anyone’s regard for the content of the message at issue. Thus, the logic of the\nAppellees extends to parties who wish to see fewer citizens vote even if it is true that\nAppellees’ ultimate goal is to have more citizens vote. The prevailing cases also do not extend\nFirst Amendment protection to an “anything goes” philosophy that seeks to insulate “any\nconduct that may relate in any way to speech or expression.” Andrade II, 488 F. App’x at 897\nn. 12. Here, Appellees offer a novel interpretation of the First Amendment. They contend that\nexpressive activity, the promotion of voter registration in this case, is contingent upon the\n“success” factor of actually registering voters. While the First Amendment protects the right\nto express political views, nowhere does it guarantee the right to ensure those views come to\nfruition. To maintain otherwise would mean that a group seeking to discourage voting and\nvoter registration would have the “right” to achieve its expressive goals by throwing the\nregistration cards away.\n\n\n                                              14\n\f    Case: 12-40914    Document: 00512395979       Page: 15   Date Filed: 10/03/2013\n\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-40914\ndrives in Texas.

He contends that if out-of-state\nresidents were to act as VDRs, they could be less easily deterred from breaking\nthe law because they could easily remove themselves from the jurisdiction of\nstate investigators and prosecutors.      Steen similarly justifies the County\nProvision as a means to increase accountability of VDRs by facilitating\nrevocation of their appointments in cases of negligence, fraud or violation of\nregistrants’ privacy. These are rational bases for the provisions. Cf. Jaeger,\n241 F.3d at 616 (holding that “the State has a compelling interest in preventing\nfraud” and that “[t]he residency requirement allows North Dakota’s Secretary\nof State to protect the petition process from fraud and abuse by ensuring that\ncirculators answer to the Secretary’s subpoena power”).\n        Even assuming arguendo that the Non-Resident and County provisions\nimplicate First Amendment interests, they pass the Anderson/Burdick balancing\ntest.   As a preliminary matter, there are fundamental differences in the\nactivities of VDRs and petition circulators. VDRs register fellow citizens to vote.\nThey may “advocate” and “interactively communicate” the importance of\nregistration, but they have a duty to the fellow citizens whose registrations they\nfacilitate. See, e.g., Tex. Elec. Code Ann. § 13.036(a)(2) (registrar may terminate\nVDR convicted of failing to deliver applications); § 13.036(b) (registrar may\nterminate VDR for failing to adequately review applications); § 13.044 (offense\nfor a person “purportedly” acting as a VDR without an appointment). They\nassume a role carefully regulated by the state to serve the citizens who register\n\n\n                                        16\n\f    Case: 12-40914    Document: 00512395979       Page: 17   Date Filed: 10/03/2013\n\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-40914\nto vote as well as the public interest in the integrity of the electoral body.\nPetition circulators, in contrast, are not agents of the state:\n      Nothing in this opinion should be read to suggest that initiative\n      petition circulators are agents of the state. Although circulators are\n      subject to regulations and are accountable to the State for\n      compliance with legitimate controls [citation omitted], circulators\n      act on behalf of themselves or the proponents of ballot initiatives.\n\nBuckley, 525 U.S. at 192 n.11, 119 S. Ct. at 642 n.11. Petition circulators’\nultimate responsibility lies in furthering their own or the sponsors’ advocacy.\nTo analyze VDRs’ responsibilities solely in terms of their advocacy denigrates\ntheir statutory duty to register all prospective voters whose applications they\ncollect. See Tex. Elec. Code Ann. § 13.043 (making it a crime to fail to deliver\nvoter applications). It is one thing to say core political speech is involved when\nthe advocates are trying to persuade the voting public to consider supporting an\ninitiative or place a candidate on the ballot;       it is quite another for the\n“advocates” to have free rein in creating the electorate. Thus, the character of\nany speech limited by the Non-Resident and County provisions is qualitatively\ndifferent from the political speech restricted by laws that affect petition\ncirculators.\n      The burdens imposed by the Non-Resident and County provisions on\ncanvassers’ speech are also minimal. Non-VDRs remain free to organize and run\nthe registration drive, persuade others to register to vote, distribute registration\nforms, and assist others in filling them out. Unlike the requirements struck\ndown in petition circulator cases, the Texas provisions do not directly reduce the\nnumber of voices by preventing out-of-state residents from advocating political\nor civic messages.

After qualifying in one\ncounty, a VDR may perfunctorily qualify to serve in other counties. Multi-county\nqualification enables oversight of the VDR while eliminating the potential\ncomplications of registering voters in metropolitan areas covering several\ncounties.

Subdivision (a)(2)\nis premised on “presenting” a quota to the employee, a formulation that implies\ndirect contact in advance to warn the person of a “quid pro quota.” Subdivision\n(a)(3), making employment decisions “in another practice” “dependent” on the\nemployee’s number of voter registrations reasonably lends itself to decisions that\nare “solely dependent” on that number. Employers are familiar, through Title\nVII discrimination law, with the difference between “sole” motive and “mixed\nmotive” decision making.          Appellees cannot feign their inability to justify\nreasonable employment decisions on factors other than or in addition to the\nnumber of registrations a canvasser produces. Moreover, as a criminal statute\nsusceptible to more than one interpretation, this provision’s enforcement would\nhave to be construed with lenity. See Tex. Elec. Code Ann. § 13.008(b). The rule\nof lenity reinforces the state’s proffered narrowing interpretation. Finally,\nTexas’s strong severability statute, which preserves statutes even if in some\n“applications” they are unconstitutional, clearly applies to the hypothetical\nsituations Appellees invoked. Tex. Gov’t Code Ann. § 311.032(c). Severability\nis a state law issue that binds federal courts. See Leavitt v.

It\nprohibits only employment decisions made solely on the basis of the number of applications\nfacilitated. Employers may consider the number of applications facilitated as part of a\ncontextualized evaluation of a canvasser’s performance.”\n\n                                              26\n\f   Case: 12-40914     Document: 00512395979     Page: 27   Date Filed: 10/03/2013\n\n\n\n\n                                 No. 12-40914\n      As we must accept the state’s narrowing construction of the Compensation\nProvision, we turn to the merits.       Because the provision applies to all\npersons–not just VDRs–and covers any activity that facilitates voter\nregistration, it encompasses activities that involve expression, including voter\ndrives where canvassers seek to persuade eligible voters to register. Further, we\nassume, without deciding, that prohibiting quota-based pay is a “lesser burden,”\nnot subject to strict scrutiny. Prete v.

Andrade I,\n888 F.Supp.2d at 852. This criticism is unwarranted; neither the uniqueness\nof an election law nor the state-wide prevalence of the type of fraud a law seeks\nto prevent has any bearing on its constitutionality.

Unlike the laws struck down in those cases, the Compensation\nProvision does not completely ban third-party organizations from compensating\ncanvassers or only permit them to pay hourly wages. To deter fraud, (a)(3)\nmerely prevents organizations from making compensation and employment\ndecisions solely based on a fixed number of applications.10\n\n       We conclude that the Compensation Provision, as narrowly construed,\ndoes not violate the First Amendment.

Accordingly, Appellees have not demonstrated a likelihood\nof success on the merits of this claim.\n\n\n\n\n       10\n          To the extent Appellees attempted to present an as-applied challenge to this\nprovision, we agree with and adopt the analysis of the motions panel majority that rejected\ntheir contention.

The\nPhotocopying Provision states that a VDR “may distribute voter registration\napplication forms throughout the county and receive registration applications\nsubmitted to the deputy in person.”         Tex. Elec. Code Ann. § 38.038.     As\ninterpreted by Steen, this provision limits VDRs’ conduct to collecting and\ndelivering completed applications and implicitly precludes photocopying.\n\n       Appellees contend that because completed voter registration applications\nin the possession of VDRs are “public records,” the restriction against\nphotocopying them violates the NVRA. However, Appellees disregard a crucial\ndistinction: the NVRA only pertains to records “maintain[ed]” by the State,\n\n                                       29\n\f   Case: 12-40914       Document: 00512395979     Page: 30   Date Filed: 10/03/2013\n\n\n\n\n                                   No. 12-40914\nwhile the Photocopying Provision only applies to voter registration applications\nin the hands of VDRs, before they are officially received or maintained by the\nState.     For this reason, the district court misplaced reliance on Project\nVote/Voting for America, Inc. v. Long, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">682</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">331</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (4th Cir. 2012), a case that\nspecifically addressed the denial of access to voter registration applications in\nthe government’s long-term possession, rather than those in the hands of VDRs.\nThe question here is not whether such applications will be made available for\nphotocopying but how. Thus, we disagree with the district court’s reasoning that\nthe applications received and delivered by VDRs are within the “constructive\npossession” of the state. For one thing, this conclusion is not supported by any\nstatutory text and is contrary to state law prohibiting VDRs from “maintaining”\nthe applications. Tex. Elec. Code Ann. § 13.038 (deputizing VDRs to receive and\ndeliver voter registration applications, not to “maintain” them for the state);\n§ 13.042(b) (requiring VDRs to deliver the voter registration applications to the\ncounty within five days).       Moreover, allowing VDRs indiscriminately to\nphotocopy registration applications places at risk the private information, e.g.,\nsocial security numbers, they contain, because Steen and counties have limited\nmeans to enforce privacy protections against temporary volunteers.

EUGENE DAVIS, Circuit Judge, dissenting.\n\n\n\n      I respectfully dissent from the majority’s decision reversing the\npreliminary injunction entered by the district court barring the Texas Secretary\nof State from enforcing five provisions of the Texas Election Code. The enjoined\nprovisions are described as follows:\n\n           (1) Texas Election Code § 13.031(d)(3) to the extent it forbids\n      non-Texas residents from serving as volunteer deputy registrars\n      (“VDRs”) (the “Non-Resident Provision”);\n\n\n           (2) Texas Election Code § 13.038 to the extent it prohibits\n      VDRs appointed in one county from serving in another county (the\n      “County Provision”);\n\n\n          (3) Texas Election Code § 13.008(a)(2) & (3) (the\n      “Compensation Provision”);\n\n\n            (4) Texas Election Code § 13.038 to the extent it prohibits\n      VDRs from photocopying or scanning voter registration applications\n      submitted to the VDR but not yet delivered to the county registrar\n      (so long as no information deemed confidential under § 13.004 is\n      included) (the “Photocopying Provision”); and\n\n\n           (5) Texas Election Code § 13.042 to the extent it prohibits\n      VDRs from sending completed voter registration applications via\n      United States mail (the “Personal Delivery Provision”).\n\n      The district court, following a lengthy evidentiary hearing and extensive\nbriefing, held that the Non-Resident Provision, the County Provision, and the\n\n                                       33\n\f    Case: 12-40914    Document: 00512395979       Page: 34    Date Filed: 10/03/2013\n\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-40914\n\nCompensation Provision unconstitutionally interfere with the plaintiffs’ rights\nunder the First Amendment and the Photocopying Provision and the Personal\nDelivery Provision are preempted by the National Voter Registration Act\n(“NVRA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 1973gg et seq.\n\n      In its opinion, the majority concludes that the plaintiffs’ activities affected\nby the Non-Resident Provision and the County Provision are not protected\nspeech and, after accepting an interpretation of the Compensation Provision that\nis textually unsupportable, finds that the provision does not interfere with the\nplaintiffs’ First Amendment rights. The majority also disagrees with the district\ncourt’s conclusion that the Photocopying Provision and the Personal Delivery\nProvision are preempted by the NVRA.\n\n      My difference with the majority, in general, is two twofold: first, in my\nview the majority takes an unsupportably restrictive view of the scope of\nplaintiffs’ activity to register voters that is protected by the First Amendment.\nThe majority also ignores clear conflicts between two provisions of the Texas\nElection Code and the NVRA. In short, I would affirm the district court’s\nthorough, well-reasoned opinion.\n\n                                         I.\n\n                               First Amendment\n\n      My disagreement with my colleagues’ treatment of this case rests in large\npart on how the majority slices and dices the activities involved in the plaintiffs’\nvoter registration drives instead of considering those activities in the aggregate.\nOrdinarily, when Project Vote and Voting for America set up a voter registration\ndrive, they cooperate with local organizations in the targeted area, while\n\n\n                                         34\n\f    Case: 12-40914    Document: 00512395979       Page: 35   Date Filed: 10/03/2013\n\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-40914\n\nmaintaining control of the process.       They hire canvassers from the local\ncommunity, but also rely on experienced canvassers and organizers from out of\nstate to manage the drive, train employees, and demonstrate proper techniques\nfor voter registration. Once trained, the canvassers are deployed throughout the\ntargeted community to attempt to persuade eligible voters to register to vote.\nCanvassers raise issues of local importance and stress that voting is a forum for\nvoters to voice their views. If the canvasser is successful, he provides a blank\napplication to the applicant and assists in completing the form. The canvasser\nthen collects the completed form and returns it to the organization, where it is\nreviewed for completeness and signs of fraud. The non-confidential portions of\nthe application are then scanned or photocopied for tracking purposes and then\ndelivered to the appropriate registrar. The plaintiffs use the photocopy to follow\nup with the registrar to verify that the registration application has been\nprocessed and the applicant added to the voting rolls. If not, the plaintiffs follow\nup as needed to correct the situation. At election time, the plaintiffs urge the\nnewly registered voters to actually vote and may provide transportation\nassistance to the voting area.\n\n      The Secretary and the majority concede that “some voter registration\nactivities involve speech – ‘urging’ citizens to register; ‘distributing’ voter\nregistration forms; ‘helping’ voters fill out their forms; and ‘asking’ for\ninformation to verify that registrations were processed successfully.” However,\nthe majority draws a line between these portions of the voter registration drive\nthey must concede are protected and all the other activity which they dismiss\nas outside the protection of the First Amendment and simply the administrative\nprocess of collecting and handling voter registration forms. In the words of the\n\n\n                                        35\n\f    Case: 12-40914    Document: 00512395979       Page: 36   Date Filed: 10/03/2013\n\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-40914\n\nmajority, “[o]ne does not ‘speak’ in this context by handling another person’s\n‘speech,’” i.e., the voter registration application, which is the voter’s “speech.”\nIn the majority’s view, all of the plaintiffs’ activities that occur after the voter\ncompletes the registration application are not speech. This would include\nprocessing the application and checking it for errors, submitting it to the\nappropriate registrar, following up to ensure that the application was processed\nand the applicant added to the voting rolls, and encouraging the voter to\nparticipate in subsequent elections.\n\n      Two Supreme Court cases applying First Amendment protections to laws\nregulating parties engaged in similar activities reject the majority’s line-\ndrawing.

As the district court pointed out, it could have been\nsaid in Buckley and Meyer “that the invalidated regulations did not prevent\nanyone from actually speaking to another citizen in an attempt to persuade her\nto sign a petition; rather, the regulations just governed the act of collecting the\nsignatures.” The Supreme Court rejected that distinction.\n\n      In Meyer, Colorado argued to the Supreme Court that the statute banning\npaid petition circulators (much as Texas does in this case) did not implicate\nspeech. Colorado argued:\n\n      [T]he petition circulator [is] the person with the public duty to\n      determine the validity of the signatures of the persons who sign the\n      petitions. . . . The verification of signatures does not constitute\n      speech, and the prohibition against payment of petition circulators\n\n                                        36\n\f    Case: 12-40914    Document: 00512395979       Page: 37   Date Filed: 10/03/2013\n\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-40914\n\n      constitutes nothing more than the prohibition against payment for\n      the act of verifying signatures. The fact that a person voluntarily\n      links his conduct with a speech component does not transform the\n      conduct into speech.\nBrief for Appellants, Meyer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112087\"><a href=\"/opinion/112087/meyer-v-grant/\"><span class=\"volume\">486</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">414</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (No. 87-920), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1987</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">880992</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *12.\nThe Supreme Court rejected this argument and concluded that petition\ncirculation involves “interactive communication concerning political change that\nis appropriately described as ‘core political speech.’” Meyer, 486 U.S. at 421-22.\nImportantly, the Court did not isolate and limit the scope of its definition of core\npolitical speech to the verbal exchange between the petition circulator and the\nperson whose signature was being solicited. Instead, it considered the\nsolicitation activity in the aggregate as core speech. Specifically, the court in\nMeyer concluded that Colorado’s ban on paid petition circulators impermissibly\nimplicated the First Amendment by restricting political expression. The Meyer\ncourt explained that this ban restricted core speech because it limited the voices\navailable to convey the message and therefore reduced the size of the audience\nthat the canvassers could reach, making it less likely the campaign would be\nsuccessful.\n      Similarly, in Buckley, the Supreme Court rejected Colorado’s argument\nthat collection of signatures was a ministerial act performed on behalf of the\nstate and therefore state regulations requiring canvassers to be Colorado\nregistered voters and wear badges did not implicate the First Amendment. As\nJustice Thomas explained in his concurrence,\n\n      Even where a State’s law does not directly regulate core political\n      speech, we have applied strict scrutiny . . . because we have\n      determined that initiative petition circulation of necessity involves\n\n\n\n                                        37\n\f    Case: 12-40914    Document: 00512395979       Page: 38   Date Filed: 10/03/2013\n\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-40914\n\n      both the expression of a desire for political change and a discussion\n      of the merits of the proposed change.\n\n\nBuckley, 525 U.S. at 207 (Thomas, J., concurring). Thus, even though the\nColorado regulation in Buckley did not directly regulate speech, the\nrequirements that solicitors wear a badge and be Colorado registered voters\nwere offensive in the same way the ban on paid circulators was in Meyer. Both\nregulations reduced the voices available to convey political messages. Id. at 210.\n\n      The Non-Resident Provision, the County Provision, and the Compensation\nProvision all limit who can participate in voter registration drives. As explained\nin more detail below, these provisions, like those in Buckley and Meyer, limit the\nnumber of voices available to convey the plaintiffs’ message. The majority\nproposes methods by which the plaintiffs could organize their voter registration\ndrives to reduce the effect of these regulations. But judges are not experts in\nconducting voter registration drives and the Supreme Court made it clear in\nMeyer that “[t]he First Amendment protects appellees’ right not only to advocate\ntheir cause but also to select what they believe to be the most effective means for\nso doing.” 486 U.S. at 424.\n\n      In Meyer and Buckley, as in this case, the plaintiffs were advocates seeking\nto collect signatures (and verify them) as part of core democratic activity. More\nparticularly, the activity in Meyer and Buckley was to persuade as many voters\nas possible to approve a referendum initiative to be placed on the ballot. This\nrequired circulators to collect signatures on a petition, verify the signatures, and\ndeliver the petition to the appropriate state official. In our case the activity is\nto persuade as many citizens as possible to participate in the democratic process.\n\n\n                                        38\n\f    Case: 12-40914    Document: 00512395979      Page: 39   Date Filed: 10/03/2013\n\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-40914\n\nThe first step is registering voters. This requires persuading and assisting a\ncitizen to complete a voter application and ensure the delivery of the application\nto the appropriate registrar. Once the voter is registered, the plaintiffs urge\nregistered voters to cast their votes in scheduled elections. The speech rights of\nthe plaintiffs in this case seeking to influence citizens to participate in the\ndemocratic process are as strong or stronger than the plaintiffs’ rights in Meyer\nand Buckley. The First Amendment rights of the canvassers in Meyer and\nBuckley and the canvassers in this case are indistinguishable: The right to\nconduct their campaign without unjustified burdens “limits the number of voices\nwho will convey [plaintiffs’] message.” Meyer, 486 U.S. at 422; see also Citizens\nUnited v.

Both are equally protected by the First\nAmendment. The plaintiffs’ activities do not cease when the voter registration\napplication is complete. The plaintiffs receive and submit the application for\nprocessing and follow up with the registrar to ensure that the registration\napplication resulted in a registered voter. They also follow up with voters to\nencourage them to vote.

Out-of-state managers cannot train, lead, demonstrate best\npractices, or perform quality control without ever touching an application - the\nregistration drives’ central tool for engaging voters.       The only state interest\nraised to justify the prohibition is the assertion that Texas residents will take\nbetter care of their fellow citizens’ registration forms than non-residents would.\nThe Secretary provides no authority or analysis to support this bold assertion.\nI agree with the district court that any state interest identified is not strong and\nthe regulation is not a narrowly tailored attempt to curtail any fraud that might\nbe associated with out-of-state canvassers. This restrictions flies directly into\nthe teeth of Buckley in which the Supreme Court struck down Colorado’s\nattempt to restrict petition circulators to registered voters of the state. The\nrestriction in this case, as in Buckley, limits the number of voices available to\nconvey plaintiffs’ message and, contrary to the conclusion of the majority, the\nplaintiffs have clearly demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of their\nchallenge to this provision.\n\n                          B. The County Provision\n\n      Texas Election Code § 13.038 provides that a VDR may distribute and\naccept applications for voter registration throughout the county in which he is\nqualified. As interpreted by the state of Texas, a VDR must be appointed in\nevery county in which an applicant resides so that a VDR who is appointed in\nCounty A yet submits an application for a citizen who resides in County B is\n\n\n\n\n                                        42\n\f    Case: 12-40914       Document: 00512395979          Page: 43     Date Filed: 10/03/2013\n\n\n\n\n                                       No. 12-40914\n\nsubject to criminal prosecution.2 The district court found that the plaintiffs had\ndemonstrated that the County Provision imposes heavy time and administrative\nburdens on their organizations. These rules force the organizations to have their\ncanvassers and managerial staff appointed as VDRs in multiple counties. This\nis especially burdensome in the larger metropolitan areas where voters may\nreside in one of several area counties. As pointed out by the district court, a\nVDR active in the City of Dallas would need to be appointed in five different\ncounties in order to accept applications in all parts of the city. Texas has 254\ncounties which magnifies the burden of this limitation. A VDR will not always\nknow in which county a potential voter resides simply by the fact that he is\npresent at a registration drive rally. Thus, the VDR in this situation risks\ncriminal sanctions for accepting a voter registration application from a resident\nof a county in which the VDR has not been appointed. It is obvious how this rule\nwould chill the plaintiffs’ registration activities.\n\n       The Secretary provided little justification for this rule. State, not county,\nlaws govern voter registration, so there are no county-specific issues relevant to\nVDR appointment. Although the Secretary argued that the County Provision\nhelps prevent fraud by making local county registrars more aware of VDR\nactivity in their counties, the registrars are made aware of the identity of the\nVDRs when they submit voter registration applications. See TEX. ELEC. CODE\nANN. §13.040 (VDRs must provide a receipt to the registrar with submitted voter\nregistration applications that identifies the county of their appointment). The\n\n\n\n       2\n          Although plaintiffs initially understood the rules to require VDRs to also be trained\nin every county in which they sought appointment, the state has interpreted the statutes to\nrequire training in only one county.\n\n                                              43\n\f   Case: 12-40914     Document: 00512395979      Page: 44   Date Filed: 10/03/2013\n\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-40914\n\ndistrict court correctly found that this provision violated plaintiffs’ First\nAmendment rights.\n\n                      C. The Compensation Provision\n\n      This provision subjects a campaign organizer, as employer, to criminal\nprosecution for compensating employees assisting in the campaign in a manner\nprohibited in this section. TEX. ELEC. CODE ANN. § 13.008. The Compensation\nProvision has three subparts: (1) a ban on “compensat[ing] another person based\non the number of voter registrations that the other person successfully\nfacilitates,” Id. § 13.008(a)(1); (2) a ban on “present[ing] another person with a\nquota of voter registrations to facilitate as a condition of payment or\nemployment,” Id. § 13.008(a)(2); and (3) a ban on “engag[ing] in any other\npractice that causes another person’s compensation from or employment status\nwith the person to be dependent on the number of voter registrations that the\nperson facilitates.” Id. § 13.008(a)(3). The plaintiffs do not challenge subpart\n(1). They contend, however, that the remaining provisions severely burden their\nability to conduct registration drives by preventing them from rewarding or\nsanctioning employees based on performance. They submit that the provisions\nexpose them to criminal sanctions if they either: (1) terminate or discipline a\ncanvasser who performs poorly; or (2) reward high performers by promoting\nthem or increasing their pay.\n\n      The Secretary interprets the provisions as only imposing criminal\nsanctions on an employer who pays canvassers on a per-application basis or\nconditions payment or employment solely on a preset quota. However, I agree\n\n\n\n\n                                       44\n\f    Case: 12-40914       Document: 00512395979         Page: 45     Date Filed: 10/03/2013\n\n\n\n\n                                      No. 12-40914\n\nwith the district court that this interpretation is inconsistent with the plain\nlanguage of the statute.3\n\n       Subparts (2) and (3) prohibit an employer from conditioning employment\non the number of applications collected or basing the employee’s compensation\non applications collected. These restrictions effectively subject the plaintiffs to\ncriminal sanctions for engaging in many common hiring and firing decisions.\nThe Secretary argues that neither provision precludes general consideration of\nan employee’s productivity. However, when the employee’s job is to gather voter\nregistration applications, the number of applications he obtains or facilitates is\nclearly an important measure of his productivity – a measure the Compensation\nProvision bars the plaintiffs from using as a basis for employment and\ncompensation decisions.\n\n       That these provisions hamper the voter registration activities of the\nplaintiffs is obvious. As the Sixth Circuit explained in striking down an Ohio\ncompensation prohibition that banned “pay[ing] any other person for collecting\nsignatures on election-related petitions or for registering voters except on the\nbasis of time worked”:\n\n       [W]hen petitioner’s means are limited to volunteers and to paid\n       hourly workers who cannot be rewarded for being productive and\n       arguably cannot be punished for being unproductive, they carry a\n       significant burden in exercising their right to core political speech.\nCitizens for Tax Reform v.

The ban on paying compensation directly for each\napplication obtained serves this interest and the plaintiffs do not challenge that\nprovision.   However, the remaining provisions further the state interest\nminimally, if at all, and burden speech and association by banning commonly\naccepted employment practices such as performance evaluations, performance-\nbased pay, and the requirement of performance as a condition of employment.\nViolation of these provisions subject the employer to criminal prosecution and\nplace an undue burden on the plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights. In my\njudgment, the district court correctly enjoined enforcement of subparts (2) and\n(3) of this provision.\n\n                                        II.\n\n                         Preemption by the NVRA\n\n      The district court found that the remaining two provisions–the\nPhotocopying Provision and the Personal Delivery Provision–were preempted by\nthe NVRA.

The Secretary argues that the Texas\nElection Code prohibits VDRs from photocopying registration applications\nbecause state law does not explicitly authorize this activity and because these\ndocuments are considered confidential under § 13.004. The plaintiffs contend\n\nthat the NVRA’s public disclosure provision4 preempts the prohibition on\nphotocopying.\n\n          I agree with the district court that voter registration applications are\n“records concerning the implementation of programs and activities conducted for\nthe purpose of ensuring the accuracy and currency of official lists of eligible\nvoters” under the relevant provision of the NVRA. 42 U.S.C. § 1973gg-6(I);\nProject Vote/Voting for Am., Inc. v.

TEX. ELEC. CODE ANN. §\n13. 031. Section 1973gg-6(I) does not require that the records be in the hands of\nthe state. It merely requires the state to maintain the records and make them\navailable for public inspection. The myriad of regulations governing VDRs are\n\n\n          4\n              The NVRA provision covering “Public disclosure of voter registration activities,”\nstates:\n          Each State shall maintain for at least 2 years and shall make available for\n          public inspection and, where available, photocopying at a reasonable cost, all\n          records concerning the implementation of programs and activities conducted for\n          the purpose of ensuring the accuracy and currency of official lists of eligible\n          voters, except to the extent that such records relate to a declination to register\n          to vote or to the identify of a voter registration agency through which any\n          particular voter is registered.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1973gg-6(I).\n\n                                                 47\n\f    Case: 12-40914    Document: 00512395979       Page: 48   Date Filed: 10/03/2013\n\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-40914\n\nbased on the assumption that the state has the ability to protect that application\nby regulating how it is handled until it is in the hands of the local registrar. In\ndoing so, the state (through the VDR) “maintains” the completed voter\nregistration applications until they are submitted to the local registrar. Thus,\na completed application in the hands of a VDR is a record that must be made\navailable for photocopying under the NVRA. I agree with the district court that\nit would be an absurd result to forbid private parties from copying applications\nthey are authorized to receive on behalf of the state before they are submitted\nto the state, when the NVRA requires the state to allow them to make a copy\nonce the record has been submitted.\n\n      The privacy concerns raised by the Secretary are also answered by the\nNVRA. As stated in Long, “[i]t is not the province of this court . . . to strike the\nproper balance between transparency and voter privacy . . . . Congress has\nalready answered the question by enacting [section 1973gg-6(I)], which plainly\nrequires disclosure of complete voter registration applications.” 682 F.3d at 339.\nThis conclusion is buttressed by the Supreme Court’s holding in Arizona that no\npresumption against preemption applies in these election clause cases.\n\n                     B. The Personal Delivery Provision\n\n      The Texas Election Code states that “[a] volunteer deputy registrar shall\ndeliver in person, or by personal delivery through another designated volunteer\ndeputy, to the registrar each completed voter registration application submitted\nto the deputy.” TEX. ELEC. CODE ANN. § 13.042(a). This section of the election\ncode prohibits VDRs from using U.S. mail to deliver the applications. Any VDR\nwho violates this ban is subject to criminal prosecution. Id. § 13.043.\n\n\n\n                                        48\n\f     Case: 12-40914     Document: 00512395979      Page: 49   Date Filed: 10/03/2013\n\n\n\n\n                                    No. 12-40914\n\n         Several provisions of the NVRA require states to allow voter registration\nby mail. 42 U.S.C. § 1973gg-4(a)(1) (“Each State shall accept and use the mail\nvoter registration application form prescribed . . . pursuant to section 1973gg-\n7(a)(2).”); 42 U.S.C. 1973gg-2(a)(2) (“[N]otwithstanding any other Federal or\nstate law, in addition to any other method of voter registration provided for\nunder State law, each State shall establish procedures to register to vote in\nElections for Federal office . . . by mail application pursuant to section 1973gg-4\n. . . . ”).\n\n         I agree with the district court that the Texas Election Code provision\npresents a clear and direct conflict with the NVRA. The NVRA makes no\ndistinction between applications submitted directly by a voter and those\nsubmitted by a third-party. The prospect of a criminal sanction effectively\nprevents the plaintiffs from using the mails to deliver applications to the\nregistrar.\n\n         Because of the patent conflict, I would find that the plaintiffs have shown\nthat they have a substantial likelihood of success on the merits on this issue and\nthat the district court correctly enjoined its enforcement.\n\n                                         III.\n\n         For the above reasons and those stated by the district court in its careful\nopinion, I am convinced that the plaintiffs have demonstrated a substantial\nlikelihood of success on the merits of each provision of the Texas Election Code\nthe district court enjoined the state from enforcing. No serious argument is\nadvanced that plaintiffs failed to establish the remaining factors for issuance of\nthe preliminary injunction–irreparable injury, balancing of harms, and the\n\n\n                                          49\n\f   Case: 12-40914     Document: 00512395979     Page: 50   Date Filed: 10/03/2013\n\n\n\n\n                                 No. 12-40914\n\npublic interest. For reasons advanced by the district court, I conclude that\nplaintiffs clearly established these factors. I would AFFIRM the district court’s\npreliminary injunction and therefore DISSENT from the majority’s contrary\nconclusion.\n\n\n\n\n                                       50\n\f</pre>",
