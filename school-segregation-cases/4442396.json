Issue Presented .......................................................................................... 4\n    Did the trial court abuse its discretion when it refused to dismiss claims\n    over which it has no subject matter jurisdiction because the Division\n    of Worker’s Compensation has exclusive jurisdiction and Plaintiff has\n    not exhausted his administrative remedies? ............................................... 4\nIV.

Summary of Argument ................................................................................. 6\nVI. Standard of Review..................................................................................... 7\nVII. Argument ................................................................................................... 8\n   A. The trial court does not have subject matter jurisdiction and any judgment\n       it renders is void as a matter of law. ........................................................ 8\n   B. The Act demonstrates the legislature’s intent that the Act provide the\n      exclusive remedy for on-the-job injuries. ............................................... 10\n   C. Through its broad rule making and enforcement provisions, the Act\n       empowers the DWC to resolve disputes, enforce compliance, and\n       punish offenders. ................................................................................... 13\n   D.     Real Party’s failure to exhaust his administrative remedies under the\n        Act precludes the trial court’s exercise of jurisdiction over this matter. . 16\n         1. Real Party consciously chose to circumvent the Act in pursuit of\n         common-law remedies for his work-place injury. ................................. 16\n         2. The laws embodied in the Act and the rules promulgated by the DWC\n         mandate that iWORKS policy was in effect on the date that Real Party\n         was injured at work. ............................................................................. 19\n   E. The DWC has exclusive jurisdiction to determine coverage. .................. 28\n\n\n                                                        iii\n\f   F. The newly released Crawford opinion confirms the Court’s prior findings\n       that it is the intent of the legislature that the DWC have exclusive\n       jurisdiction out of work-place injury claims and that even artful pleadings\n       will not let Plaintiff’s recast their claims outside of the purview of the Act.\n       ............................................................................................................... 34\nVIII.

Through artful pleading Plaintiff has\n\nsought to recast this case as a non-subscriber case, a breach of contract case, a\n\nfraud case, a third-party beneficiary case, and so on. However, the Division of\n\nWorker’s Compensation has exclusive jurisdiction over Plaintiff’s claims, no matter\n\nhow artfully plead, and the trial court lacks subject matter jurisdiction until Plaintiff\n\nhas exhausted the administrative remedies provided by the Worker’s\n\nCompensation Act2 (the “Act”).\n\n\n2TEXAS LABOR CODE, Title V, Subtitle A (“Texas Workers’ Compensation Act), §§ 401.001\n– 451.003. Unless otherwise indicated, all code references in this petition refer to the\nTexas Labor Code.\n\n                                           1\n\f       This issue is of vital importance because the carefully balanced dispute\n\nresolution and enforcement procedures that the legislature built into the system\n\nare lost if a claimant can circumvent the Act by refusing to pursue his administrative\n\nremedies and simply recasting his claims as common-law or extra-statutory\n\ncauses of action. This Court should exercise its mandamus jurisdiction in this case\n\nand order the trial court to dismiss Plaintiff’s causes of action.\n\n\n                              I. Statement of the Case\n       Nature of the case. Relator, iWORKS Personnel, Inc. (“iWORKS”) is a\n\ntemporary staffing company who contracted with Defendant, Waste Management,\n\nInc. (“WM”) to provide temporary labor at its waste processing facility. Real Party,\n\nMose Guillory (“Real Party”),3 was a temporary worker assigned by iWORKS to\n\nwork at WM’s facility. Real Party was injured on August 5, 2012 while working at\n\nthe WM facility. He subsequently sued iWORKS,4 WM, Inc. (“WM”), and Seaton,\n\nLLC d/b/a Staff Management (“SM”),5 a third party administrator of WM’s\n\ntemporary labor program.\n\n\n\n3 Real Party’s wife, Mary Guillory, is a Plaintiff in this case. Plaintiffs’ Fifth Amended\nPetition makes no express claims on her behalf, but it does seek damages for loss of\nconsortium and loss of household services. Her claims are all derivative of Real Party’s\nclaims. As used in this petition, “Real Party” refers to both Mose Guillory and Mary\nGuillory.\n4 Plaintiff also sued iWORKS’ CEO, Luis Trevino, and President, Haydee Gutierrez, in\ntheir individual capacities. They joined iWORKS in this petition. As used in this petition,\n“iWORKS” refers to both the company and the two individuals.\n5The trial court granted SM’s Rule 91a motion to dismiss. Plaintiff’s appeal is currently\npending before this Court (No. 01-14-00379-CV).\n\n                                            2\n\f          Trial court. The Honorable Michael Landrum, 113th Judicial District Court of\n\nHarris County, Texas (“Respondent” or “trial court” herein).\n\n          Proceedings in the trial court. Relators challenged the trial court’s subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction based upon the exclusive jurisdiction of the Texas Department\n\nof Insurance, Division of Worker’s Compensation (“DWC”) and Real Party’s failure\n\nto exhaust the administrative remedies available under the Act before the DWC.\n\nRelators also challenged Real Party’s causes of action based on traditional and no\n\nevidence motions for summary judgment, aside from the jurisdictional challenges.\n\nThe trial court granted Relators’ challenges to numerous of Real Party’s causes of\n\naction, but denied Relators’ jurisdictional challenges on the remaining claims and\n\ncauses of action by Order dated February 20, 2015.6 It is from the trial court’s\n\nassertion of jurisdiction over those remaining claims that Relators seek mandamus\n\nrelief.\n\n                                 II. Statement of Jurisdiction\n\n            This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to Tex. Gov’t Code § 22.002(a).\n\n    Mandamus relief is appropriate to correct a trial court’s assertion of subject\n\n    matter jurisdiction over a case that lies squarely within the exclusive jurisdiction\n\n    of an administrative agency, here the DWC over the Texas workers’\n\n\n\n\n6   Tab 1\n\n                                            3\n\f    compensation system.7 This erroneous assertion of jurisdiction is an abuse of\n\n    discretion. Permitting the trial court to improperly assert jurisdiction results not\n\n    only in hardship to Relators, but also interferes with the “legislatively mandated\n\n    function and purpose” of the DWC, undermines the Legislature’s intent to create\n\n    a comprehensive scheme to govern workers’ compensation claims in Texas,8\n\n    and effectively abrogates the Act, leaving Relators with no adequate remedy by\n\n    appeal.9 This court can correct the trial court’s assertion of subject matter\n\n    jurisdiction here through a writ of mandamus because the underlying claims lie\n\n    within the exclusive jurisdiction of the DWC.\n\n\n                                  III. Issue Presented\nDid the trial court abuse its discretion when it refused to dismiss claims over\nwhich it has no subject matter jurisdiction because the Division of Worker’s\nCompensation has exclusive jurisdiction and Plaintiff has not exhausted his\nadministrative remedies?\n\n                                IV. Statement of Facts\n         Real Party was severely injured on August 5, 2012 while in the course of\n\nhis employment at Waste Management’s waste reclamation facility in Houston,\n\nTexas. Real Party was a temporary worker recruited by IWORKS and assigned\n\nto operate a front-end loader at WM’s facility. At some point WM reassigned Real\n\n\n7In re Liberty Mutual Fire Ins.

Ruttiger, 381 S.W.3d 430, 344 (Tex. 2012)\n9See In re Entergy, 142 SW.3d at 321; In Re Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 295 S.W.3d at\n328.\n\n                                             4\n\fParty to operate a Harris Baler.10 Real Party was injured when he entered the\n\nbaler to clear a jam without depowering the machine. The baler activated and\n\nsevered his right leg below the knee and half of his left foot.\n\n        This lawsuit arises from Real Party’s attempt to recover damages for the\n\ninjuries he sustained while employed at the WM facility. Throughout this suit Real\n\nParty has asserted various causes of action, some sounding in tort (negligence,\n\ngross negligence, negligence per se, negligent hiring, training, and supervision,\n\ncommon law fraud, fraud by non-disclosure, and negligent undertaking); some\n\nsounding in contract (breach of contract as third-party beneficiary to the iWORKS\n\n/ WM service agreement and breach of contract as a third-party beneficiary of the\n\nWM / SMX agreement).            Real Party has also alleged numerous theories of\n\nvicarious liability (respondeat superior, joint enterprise, and partnership liability).\n\nReal Party’s claims against iWORKS have been narrowed down to negligence,\n\nnegligence per se, gross negligence, negligent hiring, training, and supervision,\n\nbreach of contract, respondeat superior, partnership liability, and joint enterprise\n\nliability.11   Regardless of how artfully or inventively labeled or recast, all of\n\n\n10 A Harris Baler is essentially a gigantic trash compactor which compacts sorted refuse\ninto dense bales. The material is fed into the baler via a conveyor belt which dumps the\nmaterial into the compacting chamber.\n11 The trial court denied iWORKS’ motion for summary judgment on all causes except for\nbreach of contract, which it granted. However, the trial court declined to dismiss the same\ncontract claims against Trevino and Gutierrez, even though they were neither parties nor\nsignatories to the contract in their individual capacities. The trial court also dismissed\nPlaintiff’s negligence claims against Trevino and Gutierrez, but left the gross negligence\nclaims against them intact. Thus, while as a matter of law Trevino and Gutierrez are not\nnegligent, they are still subject to liability on Plaintiff’s gross negligence claims. Likewise,\n                                               5\n\fPlaintiff’s claims flows directly from his on-the-job injury.\n\n\n                             V. Summary of Argument\n\n\n      Real Party’s claims fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the DWC, and\n\ntherefore, the trial court is without subject matter jurisdiction to consider these\n\nclaims until they have exhausted all administrative remedies provided for under\n\nthe Act. Allowing a participant in the worker’s compensation system to pursue such\n\nclaims in a civil action is incompatible with the comprehensive administrative\n\nprocesses and other remedies in the Act.\n\n      Despite Real Party’s attempts to avoid the Act by creatively pleading their\n\ncomplaints, the essence of their suit falls squarely under the purview of the DWC.\n\nTo hold otherwise would allow claimants to easily avoid the exclusive jurisdiction\n\nof the Act by simply relabeling their claims as other common law or statutory\n\ntheories, even though such claims are equally incompatible with the administrative\n\nprocesses and other remedies in the Act. This is precisely why the Texas Supreme\n\nCourt has repeatedly emphasized the legislative intent that there be no alternative\n\nremedies available outside the Act.\n\n\n\n\nthey are also subject to same breach of contract liability that the trial court found their\ncompany, a party to the contract, not liable for as a matter of law. The trial court denied\nRelators’ motion to reconsider these paradoxical results.\n\n                                            6\n\f                               VI. Standard of Review\n         This Court set forth the proper standard of review in in this matter in Scwartz\n\nv. Ins. Co. of Pa.12\n\n         A plea to the jurisdiction contests a trial court's subject matter\n         jurisdiction. Tex. Dep't of Transp. v. Jones, 8 S.W.3d 636, 638\n         (Tex.1999). Whether a court has subject matter jurisdiction is a matter\n         of law. Tex. Dep't of Parks & Wildlife v. Miranda, 133 S.W.3d 217, 226\n         (Tex.2004). Accordingly, we review a challenge to the trial court's\n         subject matter jurisdiction de novo. Id. at 228.\n\n         When reviewing a plea to the jurisdiction, we must look to the\n         allegations in the pleadings, construe them in the plaintiff's favor, and\n         consider the pleader's intent. See County of Cameron v. Brown, 80\n         S.W.3d 549, 555 (Tex. 2002). In doing so, we consider the facts\n         alleged in the petition, and to the extent relevant to the jurisdictional\n         issue, any evidence submitted by the parties to the trial court. See\n         Bland Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Blue, 34 S.W.3d 547, 555 (Tex. 2000). The\n         plaintiff bears the burden to allege facts affirmatively demonstrating\n         the trial court's jurisdiction to hear a case. See Tex. Ass'n of Bus. v.\n         Tex. Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440, 446 (Tex.1993). If a plaintiff\n         pleads facts that affirmatively demonstrate an absence of jurisdiction\n         and the jurisdictional defect is incurable, then the cause is properly\n         dismissed. Peek v. Equip. Serv. Co. of San Antonio, 779 S.W.2d 802,\n         805 (Tex. 1989). However, when the plaintiff fails to plead facts that\n         establish jurisdiction, but the petition does not affirmatively\n         demonstrate incurable defects in jurisdiction, the issue is one of\n         pleading sufficiency, and the plaintiff should be afforded the\n         opportunity to amend. Brown, 80 S.W.3d at 555.\nPlaintiff’s Fifth Amended Petition pleads facts and cites exhibits that place this\n\nmatter squarely within the exclusive jurisdiction of the DWC. The evidence\n\nconsidered by the trial court in relation iWORKS’ plea to the jurisdiction also\n\nsupports the DWC’s exclusive jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n12   274 S.W.3d 270, 273-74 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2008, pet. denied).\n\n                                            7\n\f         In support of this petition iWORKS has provided this Court with the following\n\npleadings:\n\n               1) Plaintiff’s Fifth Amended Petition;13\n               2) iWORKS’ Plea to the Jurisdiction;14\n               3) iWORKS’ Supplemental Plea to the Jurisdiction15; and\n               4) Plaintiff’s Response to iWORKS’ Plea to the Jurisdiction.16\n\nAll exhibits submitted with these pleadings and considered by the trial court are\n\nfound in the Appendix.17 No party offered sworn testimony at the oral hearing on\n\nthis matter. Relators have ordered a transcript of the oral argument and will\n\nsupplement the mandamus record as soon as the transcript is received from the\n\ncourt reporter.\n\n\n                                     VII. Argument\nA.       The trial court does not have subject matter jurisdiction and any\n         judgment it renders is void as a matter of law.\n\n         The trial court erred when it exercised jurisdiction in this case because it\n\ndoes not have subject-matter jurisdiction over Plaintiff’s claims related to his injury\n\nat work. Without subject-matter jurisdiction the trial court cannot render a valid\n\njudgment in this matter.18 “Subject matter jurisdiction is ‘essential to a court’s\n\n\n\n\n13 Tab 2 (hereinafter “Petition”).\n14 Tab 5\n15 Tab 12\n16 Tab 15 (hereinafter “Response”)\n17 Real Party attached three exhibits totaling 561 pages to his Response. Real Party’s\n\nexhibits are submitted to this Court in the same form as submitted to the trial court.\n18   City of Houston v. Rhule, 417 S.W.3d 440, 442 (Tex. 2014, per curium)\n\n                                             8\n\fpower to decide a case.’”19 Subject-matter jurisdiction cannot be waived, nor can\n\nit be given or taken away by consent.20 “A judgment rendered without subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction cannot be considered final.”21\n\n         Lack of subject-matter jurisdiction makes a judgment void, not just\n\nvoidable.22 Lack of subject-matter jurisdiction is fundamental error and can be\n\nraised at any time.23 Lack of subject-matter jurisdiction can even be raised for the\n\nfirst time on appeal. “Not only may a reviewing court assess jurisdiction for the\n\nfirst time on appeal, but all courts bear the affirmative obligation ‘to ascertain that\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction exists regardless of whether the parties have questioned\n\nit.’”24 Furthermore, the failure to grant a plea to the jurisdiction for failure to exhaust\n\nadministrative remedies with the DWC is subject to this Court’s mandamus\n\nreview.25\n\n\n\n\n19   Id.

The Act demonstrates the legislature’s intent that the Act provide the\n         exclusive remedy for on-the-job injuries.\n\n           The Act provides a compensation system for “personal injuries sustained\n\n     by an employee in the course and scope of his employment.”26 In exchange for\n\n     prompt remuneration of benefits to the employee with no burden of proof as to\n\n     negligence, the Act prevents employees from seeking common law remedies\n\n     against the employer, agent or employee of the employer for on-the-job\n\n     injuries.27 The Act also limits employers’ exposure to the uncertainties of\n\n     litigation costs and awards.28 Recovery under the Act is intended to be an\n\n     injured employee’s sole remedy for work-related injuries.29\n\n           The legislature empowered the DWC to administer and operate the\n\n     workers’ compensation system of Texas.30 The system’s processes are initiated\n\n     by the worker reporting an occupational injury or disease to the employer, after\n\n     which the employer must report the injury claim to the carrier. 31 Disputes\n\n     regarding general compensability and extent of injury are addressed under\n\n\n\n\n26   Aranda v.

This matter falls under Chapter 410\n\n           Additional safeguards are built into the workers’ compensation system to\n\n     monitor compliance with the rules and regulations in Chapter 415, entitled\n\n     “Administrative Violations,” as well as provisions in Chapters 409 and 410.32 For\n\n     example, these provisions allow fines of up to $25,000 per day, per violation for\n\n     an insurer’s conduct, including, for example:\n\n          a) making a false or misleading statement; 33\n          b) failing to process claims reasonably;34\n          c) unreasonably disputing the reasonableness and necessity of health\n             care;35\n          d) conspiring to commit an act that is a violation;36 and\n          e) other conduct violating Commission rules.37\n\n     Any system participant can initiate an investigation by the DWC of possible\n\n     administrative violations.38 Procedurally, administrative violations follow a path\n\n     similar to Chapter 413 disputes.39\n\n\n\n\n32   See generally §415.001, et seq.; §409.021; §410.205.\n33   §415.008.\n34   §415.002(a)(11).\n35   §415.002(a)(19).\n36   §415.008.\n37   §415.008; §415.021.\n38   §415.031.\n39   §415.034-5.\n\n                                            11\n\f           In 1989 the Texas Legislature overhauled the worker’s compensation\n\n     system to address the system’s deficiencies, to balance the interests and\n\n     concerns of the worker and the employer (or insurance carrier), and to provide\n\n     more efficient results for all parties. Prior to that time and up to this Court’s\n\n     opinion in Ruttiger, the shortcomings of the system necessitated this Court’s\n\n     acknowledgement of a common law cause of action for extra-contractual\n\n     damages. In Ruttiger, this Court set out its analysis of the respective roles of\n\n     the Legislature and this Court in relation to the Act and the worker’s\n\n     compensation system as a whole. Improvements to the pre-1989 system were\n\n     cited to include the following:\n\n         1)    reduction of the disparity of bargaining power between\n               employees and insurance carriers;\n         2)    removal of insurers’ exclusive control over the processing of\n               claims;\n         3)    curtailment of insurers’ ability to refuse or unreasonably deny\n               payment of valid claims in an arbitrary manner;\n         4)    provision of information to employees and free assistance before\n               the DWC process through the ombudsman program; and\n         5)    provision of multiple remedies and penalties to enforce the\n               parties’ rights and to regulate the parties’ conduct, up to and\n               including revocation of a carrier’s right to do business in Texas “if\n               on multiple occasions it fails to pay benefits promptly and as they\n               accrue.”40 The Legislature provided injured workers with tools\n               to which they did not previously have access. Carefully\n               considering these improvements to the system, this Court held\n               that common law causes of action outside the framework of the\n               Act are no longer necessary when the Act covers the\n               complained-of conduct or the remedy sought.41\n\n40   Ruttiger, 381 S.W.3d at 449-450.\n41   Id. at 444, 445, 451.\n\n                                             12\n\fRecognizing the broad scope and encompassing remedies brought about by the\n\n1998 revisions to the Act, the Texas Supreme Court held that “the Court should\n\nnot alter the Act’s comprehensive scheme.” 42\n\nC.       Through its broad rule making and enforcement provisions, the Act\n         empowers the DWC to resolve disputes, enforce compliance, and\n         punish offenders.\n\n           The Act provides a compensation system for “personal injuries sustained\n\n     by an employee in the course and scope of his employment.” 43 In exchange for\n\n     prompt remuneration of benefits to the employee with no burden of proof as to\n\n     negligence, the Act prevents employees from seeking common law remedies\n\n     against the employer, agent or employee of the employer for on-the-job\n\n     injuries.44 The Act also limits employers’ exposure to the uncertainties of\n\n     litigation costs and awards.45 Recovery under the Act is intended to be an\n\n     injured employee’s sole remedy for work-related injuries.29\n\n         An agency has exclusive jurisdiction “when a pervasive regulatory scheme\n\nindicates that Congress intended for the regulatory process to be the exclusive\n\n\n\n42Liberty Mut.

Ins. Co. of\nNorth Amer., 748 S.W.2d 210 (Tex. 1988). The Ruttiger court held that the 1989\namendments to the Act manifested the Legislatures’ intent to vitiate the need for such a\ncause of action and expressly overruled Arranda. Id., 381 S.W.3d at 438-56.\n\n                                            14\n\fand increasing sanctions for violations of the Act.”52 The Ruttiger court stated that\n\n“[t]he purpose of the Act is to provide employees with certainty that their medical\n\nbills and lost wages will be covered if they are injured.” Id. at 441.\n\n         To accomplish these purposes, the Act provides detailed notice and\n         administrative dispute resolution proceedings that include specific\n         deadlines and incorporate a “conveyor-belt” approach. That is, once\n         the administrative dispute resolution process is initiated, a dispute\n         continues through the process until the dispute is resolved either by\n         the parties or by a binding decision through the resolution procedures.\n\nId. at 441.\n\n         The Ruttiger opinion provides a lengthy description of “the detailed notice\n\nand administrative dispute resolution proceedings” encompassed by the Act. 53 In\n\ndescribing the pervasiveness of the Act the Ruttiger court noted that the Act affords\n\nthe DWC significant power to enforce the Act against the various parties in the\n\nworker’s compensation system. Id. The Ruttiger court concluded:\n\n         It is apparent that the Act prescribes detailed, WCD-supervised, time-\n         compressed processes for carriers to handle claims and for dispute\n         resolution. It has multiple, sometimes redundant but sometimes\n         additive, penalty and sanction provisions for enforcing compliance\n         with its requirements.54\n\nThe court recognized that allowing an employee to circumvent the act by asserting\n\ncommon law causes of action would be “inconsistent with the Act’s goals and\n\nlegislative intent exhibited in the act” and could also “result in rewarding an\n\n\n\n52   Id., 381 S.W.2d at 433.\n53   Id. at 441-43.\n54   Id. at 443.\n\n                                           15\n\femployee who is dilatory in utilizing the Act’s detailed dispute resolution\n\nprocedures, regardless of whether the delay was intentional or inadvertent,\n\nbecause whether and when the dispute resolution begins is by and large\n\ndependent on the employee.” Id.\n\nD.       Real Party’s failure to exhaust his administrative remedies under the\n         Act precludes the trial court’s exercise of jurisdiction over this matter.\n\n         When an agency has exclusive jurisdiction a party must exhaust its\n\nadministrative remedies before seeking recourse through judicial review. 55 “If an\n\nagency has exclusive jurisdiction... a party must first exhaust all administrative\n\nremedies before a trial court has subject matter jurisdiction.”56 “Absent exhaustion\n\nof administrative remedies, a trial court must dismiss the case.”57\n\n\n         1. Real Party consciously chose to circumvent the Act in pursuit of\n            common-law remedies for his work-place injury.\n\n         There is no question that Real Party not exhausted his administrative\n\nremedies through the DWC.

Real Party states:\n         In accordance with the Texas Labor Code Ch. 409, Plaintiffs did previously\n         file their DWC 41 form on the 1-year anniversary of the injury in question.\n         However, Plaintiffs did so solely to preserve their right to seek benefits in\n         the event that this Court or the Court of Appeals later determined that\n         iWorks Defendants and/or WM Defendants were workers’ compensation\n         subscribers. Plaintiffs are not seeking workers’ compensation benefits from\n                                               16\n\fjustified in foregoing the Texas Workers’ Compensation System because both\n\niWORKS and WM are nonsubscribers.59 However, an examination of the Plaintiff’s\n\nallegations and the evidence submitted in connection with Relator’s Plea to the\n\nJurisdiction demonstrate that Relator was a subscriber the Act.\n\n           Real Party was injured on August 5, 2012.60            On August 30, 2012 he\n\nexecuted a DWC-041 form61 requesting compensation for a work-related injury.62\n\nOn that form he stated that he was represented by Bradford J. Gilde (“Gilde”).63\n\nThus, fifteen days after his work-related injury (over 2 ½ years ago) Real Party was\n\nat a minimum aware of the potential availability of benefits under the Act. It is also\n\nfair to assume that his attorney knew (or had the ability to find out) how to obtain\n\nthose benefits.\n\n           Nearly a year later on August 12, 2013, Gilde sent a letter to the DWC.64 It\n\nwas styled as a “Notice, Stay, and Preservation Letter.” Although litigation was\n\nongoing and both iWORKS and Waste Management were represented by\n\n\n\n\n           any provider, and are surely not attempting to get blood from the turnip that\n           is iWorks Defendants’ cancelled policy.\n59   Tab 2, Petition, p. 6, ¶¶ 19-20.\n60   Id. at p. 13, ¶ 36.\n61“Employee’s Claim for Compensation for a Work Related Injury or Occupational\nDisease.”\n62   Tab 10.\n63   Id.\n64   Tab 14.\n\n                                                17\n\fcounsel,65 neither Defendant was copied on this correspondence. Gilde attached\n\ntwo separate DWC-041 forms to the letter. One names iWORKS as Real Party’s\n\nemployer and the other names WM as his employer. Thus, as of the date of his\n\nletter to the DWC, Real Party’s counsel had actual knowledge of two separate\n\nworker’s compensation policies which would potentially provide benefits to his\n\nclient. He consciously chose to forego pursuing his client’s benefits under either\n\none of the policies in lieu of proceeding with his claims in the trial court. 66\n\n           Gilde’s letter to the DWC states that it:\n\n           “is submitted: (1) as a notice of claim for compensation...as a\n           preservation of right to file and seek a claim for compensation...and\n           pursuant to Tex. Labor Code §409.004.”67\n\n           The letter further states that “this letter...is not an election or denial of a claim\n\nfor coverage.”68 Real Party cannot hedge his bets with the DWC while seeking a\n\njudicial remedy in the trial court without first exhausting his administrative\n\n\n\n65   At that time attorney Aric Garza was counsel for iWORKS.\n66On information and belief, as of the filing of this petition Real Party has still not sought\nbenefits under WM’s worker’s compensation policy even though the trial court dismissed\nhis claims against WM pursuant to the “comp bar” defense.\nPort Elevator-Brownsville, L.L.C. v. Casados, 358 S.W.3d 238 (Tex. 2012) held that for\npurposes of the Act a temporary staffing company and its client are both co-employers\nand that the client company cannot exclude or segregate temporary workers from its\nworker’s compensation coverage. Simply put, the state of Texas wants all workers\ncovered. Thus, a temporary staffing employee typically has two different worker’s\ncompensation policies which can cover him for on-the-job injuries. Which policy actually\ncovers the worker is usually a matter of contract between the staffing company and its\nclient.\n67   Tab 14 (emphasis in original).\n68   Id.\n\n                                                18\n\fremedies. His failure to do so in this matter, despite knowing the administrative\n\nrequirements set forth in the Act, deprives the trial court of subject-matter\n\njurisdiction over his claims.\n\n         Gilde’s letter to the DWC purports to reserve Real Party’s right to seek relief\n\nfrom the DWC in the event he was unsuccessful in in the trial court. This approach\n\nturns the purpose of the entire worker’s compensation system on its head. This\n\nletter demonstrates that Real Party was well aware of the requirements under the\n\nTexas Labor Code yet consciously chose to attempt to circumvent that process in\n\nhopes of a common law verdict. This is not the public policy of Texas. As the\n\nRuttiger court observed, “the extra-statutory cause of action provides incentive for\n\nan injured worker to delay using the avenues for immediate relief that the\n\nLegislature painstakingly built into the law” and “distorts the balances struck in the\n\nAct and frustrates the Legislature’s intent to have disputes resolved quickly and\n\nobjectively.”69\n\n\n         2. The laws embodied in the Act and the rules promulgated by the\n            DWC mandate that iWORKS policy was in effect on the date that\n            Real Party was injured at work.\n\n         iWORKS is a subscriber under the Act. iWORKS purchased a worker’s\n\ncompensation policy from Texas Mutual with the effective dates of 09/04/2011\n\nthrough 09/04/2012.70 That iWORKS actually purchased this policy is not disputed\n\n\n\n69   Ruttiger, 381 S.W.3d at 451.\n70   Tab 6.\n\n                                            19\n\fby Real Party.

(“Texas Department of Insurance,\nDivision of Workers’ Compensation”).\n79   §406.002.\n80Even Plaintiff’s Petition states that “[a]s is clear, in addition to supplying client\ncompanies with leased employees or temporary workers, IWORKS DEFENDANTS also\nhave the duty and responsibility to provide worker’s compensation.” Tab 2, p. 10, ¶ 24;\n                                          21\n\fcompensation        policy   from   Texas     Mutual   effective   09/04/2011   through\n\n09/04/2012.81 Luis Trevino, owner of iWORKS, testified that iWORKS subscribed\n\nto worker’s compensation insurance from its inception and that this is the normal\n\ncourse of business for a temporary staffing company. 82 Furthermore, the Service\n\nAgreement between iWORKS and WM required that iWORKS carry workers’\n\ncompensation insurance.83 It is not Real Party’s contention that iWORKS was a\n\nnon-subscriber, rather, he contends that the Texas Mutual policy was cancelled\n\nseveral weeks before his injury.84          As is discussed below, this contention is\n\nunsupported by the Pleadings and the evidence.\n\n         In opposition to iWORKS’ Plea to the Jurisdiction, Real Party relied upon\n\nfour single-page documents85 as well as discovery responses from Texas Mutual\n\nand Lette Insurance Company.86 The primary document he relies upon is a “Notice\n\nof Termination.”87 However, this document has no probative value. There is no\n\n\nbut see Id., p. 6, ¶¶ 19-21 where Real Party makes the global allegation (without factual\nsupport) that both iWORKS and WM are non-subscribers.\n81   Tab 6.\n82 Tab 11; Trevino testified: “Since it has been in business iWORKS has continuously\nsubscribed to Worker’s Compensation insurance and has covered all of its temporary\nemployees that it sends out on assignment. This is the standard course of business for\na temporary staffing company.”\n83   Tab 3.\n84   Tab 15, pp. 5-8, ¶¶ 25-32.\n85   Real Party attached 560 pages of documents to his response (Tabs 16-18).\n86Tabs 16 and 17. For the sake of simplicity, Relator has separated the evidence\nspecifically cited in Real Party’s response and has combined it under Tab 19 in the\nAppendix.\n87   Tab 19 The same document was produced by both Texas Mutual and Lette Ins.\n\n                                             22\n\fevidence that this Notice was ever sent to iWORKS. Luis Trevino testified that\n\niWORKS never received notice of termination.88 He stated:\n\n         The first knowledge that iWORKS had of an alleged gap in its worker’s\n         compensation coverage was when Mose Guillory’s attorney made\n         that allegation during my deposition in this case. Although Guillory’s\n         attorney presented what appeared to be a notice of termination, I had\n         no knowledge of such notice. During that alleged period of time we\n         had never missed a premium payment, we had received no\n         communication from our broker regarding any termination, we had\n         received no denial of any claims, and we never had problems\n         obtaining Certificates of Insurance.\n\nThe testimony is uncontroverted. The notice relied upon by Real Party purports to\n\nhave been sent by certified mail which begs the question – where is the green card\n\nor the unclaimed envelope?\n\n         The only other evidence offered by Real Party is the self-serving discovery\n\nresponses from Texas Mutual. Texas Mutual’s canned response to almost all of\n\nthe questions posed by Real Party (subject to objection) was:\n\n         Texas Mutual insurance policy no. STA_0001244473 301 10904\n         (“The Policy”) was issued to Preferred Staffing Company, LLC d/b/a\n         iWorks Personnel (“Preferred Staffing”) for the coverage period of\n         09/04/2011 to 09/04/2012. The Policy was cancelled, effective\n         07/16/2012 (See Notice of Cancellation, document Bates No.\n         TXM00318). Texas Mutual Insurance’s Company’s actions regarding\n         issuance of The Policy and subsequent cancellation were conducted\n         pursuant to and in accordance with the Rules set by the Texas\n         Department of Insurance Division of Workers’ Compensation and the\n         Texas Worker’s Compensation Act.89\n\n\n\n\n88   Tab 11.\n89   Tab 19.\n\n                                          23\n\fReal Party also relies upon admissions submitted by Texas Mutual “admitting” that\n\n1) the policy “was cancelled prior to August 5, 2012”, and 2) that “iWORKS was a\n\n‘nonsubscriber,’ under Texas law to your [Texas Mutual’s] knowledge and\n\ndefinition of “nonsubscriber.”90 Notwithstanding the fact that these admissions are\n\nconclusory and lack any evidentiary foundation, these admissions have no\n\nevidentiary value as they cannot be used against iWORKS.91\n\n         What Texas Mutual’s evidence does show is that iWORKS did indeed have\n\na policy covering the date of Real Party’s injury. What it does not show is any\n\nevidence that the policy was properly terminated pursuant to the Labor Code and\n\nthe rules established by the DWC. Again, where is the green card? Where is the\n\nunclaimed envelope? It is not in any of the documents submitted by Real Party.\n\nTexas Mutual’s testimony also supports the exclusive jurisdiction of the DWC when\n\nit claims that it has adhered to all of the requirements of the Act and the DWC rules\n\nappurtenant thereto. It is solely within the DWC’s province to determine Texas\n\nMutual’s actual compliance and solely within the DWC’s administrative power to\n\npunish and sanction Texas Mutual for violations of the Act and/or the DWC rules.\n\n         Real Party also referenced an August 24, 2012 letter written by Texas\n\nMutual to show cancellation of the policy.92 Again there is no evidence to show\n\n\n\n90   Tab 19.\n91Tex. Rule of Civ. P. 198.3; see U.S. Fid. & Guar. Co. v. Goudeau, 272 S.W.3d 603,\n610 (Tex. 2008).\n92   Tab 19.\n\n                                         24\n\fthat this was actually sent to iWORKS or that iWORKS ever received it. Nor is\n\nthere any mention of termination in this letter. However, the very next document\n\nin Real Party’s exhibit does show that iWORKS paid Texas Mutual just under\n\n$44,000.00 in premiums for that policy period.93\n\n           The only other document offered by Real Party in opposition to iWORKS\n\nPlea to the Jurisdiction is an “Appointment Confirmation” dated October 18, 2012 94\n\nthat Real Party offered as proof that iWORKS “was in direct contact with Texas\n\nMutual during this cancellation period.”95 Notwithstanding the same issues of\n\ndelivery and receipt, this letter makes no mention of termination even though it is\n\ndated over three months since the policy was supposed to have been cancelled.\n\nThe very next two documents in Real Party’s exhibit shows that on November 12,\n\n2012 a copy of an “Incomplete Final Audit Notification” allegedly sent to iWORKS96\n\nwas also faxed to Lette Insurance. What is interesting about this document is that\n\nit states\n\n           To prevent cancellation of your current coverage, please contact the\n           Premium Audit department promptly.97\n\n\n\n\n93   Tab 20.\n94   Tab 19.\n95   Tab 15, p. 9, ¶ 38.\n96Tab 21; Again, Real Party provides no evidence that this letter was actually sent to or\nreceived by iWORKS.\n97   Id.\n\n                                           25\n\fThis begs the question, if iWORKS’ coverage was terminated in July, 2012, how\n\ncould its current coverage in November, 2012 be subject to cancellation? This\n\ncourt, looking at this evidence de novo, should find that the evidence submitted by\n\nReal Party to show the trial court’s jurisdiction in this matter is of no probative effect\n\nat all. However, even had the trial court (or this Court) given any weight to the\n\nevidence submitted by Real Party, the laws of the Act and the Rules of the DWC\n\nstill confer exclusive jurisdiction to the DWC.\n\n           The Act and the rules enacted by the DWC have very specific requirements\n\ngoverning the termination of a workers’ compensation policy. The Act provides that\n\nan insurance company that terminates a policy “shall deliver notice of the\n\ncancellation... by certified mail or in person to the employer and the division” at\n\nleast thirty days prior to the effective date of the cancellation. 98 If the insurance\n\ncompany does not give notice as required, then the policy is extended until proper\n\nnotice is provided.99\n\n           Pursuant to the rule making authority given to it in the Act, the DWC has\n\npromulgated additional rules for the termination of a worker’s compensation policy\n\nwhich are codified in the TAC.100 Chapter 43 provides that “[r]ejection of the\n\nworkers’ compensation system [o]ccurs when a subscriber terminates coverage or\n\n\n\n\n98   §406.008.\n99   Id.\n100   See 28 TEX. ADMIN. CODE, Chapter 43.\n\n                                             26\n\ffails or refuses to purchase a policy of workers’ compensation insurance.”101 Thus,\n\nthere is no allegation that iWORKS “rejected” the workers’ compensation system.\n\n            Under the DWC’s rules a carrier must give the employer written notice of\n\ntermination at least thirty days before the effective date of termination. 102 Notice\n\nmust be by certified mail; there is no provision for personal delivery.103 The\n\neffective date of the termination under Chapter 43 is “the latest of the following\n\ndates: (A) on the 31st day after the carrier notifies the subscriber as provided in\n\nsubsection (c) . . . ; (B) the day the carrier files notice of termination with the board\n\n. . .; or (C) the actual termination date recited on the notice.”104\n\n            Chapter 110 provides substantially more protection for both the employer\n\nand the employee. It provides that:\n\n               f) Cancellation or non-renewal of a workers' compensation insurance\n               policy by an insurance company takes effect on the later of:\n\n                  (1) the end of the workers' compensation insurance policy period; or\n\n                  (2) the date the division and the employer receive the notification\n                      from the insurance company of coverage cancellation or non-\n                      renewal and the later of:\n\n                           (A)   the date 30 days after receipt of the notice required by\n                                 Labor Code, §406.008(a)(1);\n\n                           (B)   the date 10 days after receipt of the notice required by\n                                 Labor Code, §406.008(a)(2); or\n\n\n101   Id., § 43.10(a)(2).\n102   Id., § 43.10(c)(1-3)\n103   Id.\n104   Id., § 43.10(d)(1)\n\n                                               27\n\f                       (C)    the effective date of the cancellation if later than the date\n                              in paragraph (1) or (2) of this subsection.105\n\nThe rules promulgated by the DWC and codified in the TAC reflect the driving\n\nintent of the State of Texas that its workers be covered.\n\n         How do these laws and regulations apply in this case? Under Rule 110.1,\n\nregardless of when or how or if iWORKS was provided with notice of cancellation\n\nby Texas Mutual, the effective date of termination would be at the end of the policy\n\nperiod on September 4, 2012. Under Rule 43.10 the effective date of termination\n\nwould be on the 31st day after iWORKS received notice of cancellation from Texas\n\nMutual through certified mail.        Under Section 408.10, the termination date is\n\nextended until Texas Mutual provides notice of cancellation to iWORKS through\n\neither certified mail or personal delivery. Since iWORKS never received notice of\n\ncancellation through certified mail, under both Rule 43.10 and Section 408.10 the\n\npolicy terminated under its own terms on September 4, 2012. Real Party was\n\ninjured on August 5, 2012. Thus he falls under the coverage of iWORKS’ workers’\n\ncompensation policy.\n\n\n\n\n105   Id., § 110.1(f) (emphasis added).\n\n                                             28\n\fE.       The DWC has exclusive jurisdiction to determine coverage.\n\n         The DWC routinely addresses the issues raised in this case through its\n\nadministrative proceedings.106 For example, in Appeals Panel No. 030660 107\n\n(Division of Worker’s Compensation, April 28, 2003) the DWC appeals panel\n\naddressed a temporary staffing situation and determined which employer was\n\nliable, the proper application of the Staff Leasing Services Act108 (“SLSA”), and\n\napproved the use of the borrowed servant doctrine in determining liability.\n\n\n         In Appeals Panel No. 021771 (Division of Worker’s Compensation,\n\nSeptember 3, 2002) the appeals panel addressed a matter factually similar to this\n\ncase analyzing the interplay between the contractual obligations between a staffing\n\n\n106\n  See e.g. Ins. Co. of Pa. v. Hartford Underwriters Ins. Co., 164 S.W.3d 747 (Tex.App.—\nHouston [14th Dist.] 2005, no pet.) (“Though we are not bound by the decisions [of the\nDWC], we find them instructive . . . . “); Houston Gen. Ins. Co. v. Ass’n Cas. ins. Co., 977\nS.W.3d 634, 636 (Tex.App.—Tyler 1998, no pet.) (noting that administrative decisions,\nwhile not binding, are entitled to substantial weight).\nDWC Appeals Panel decisions are available on the Texas Department of Insurance\nwebsite at http://www.tdi.texas.gov/appeals. Copies of the Appeals Panel decisions cited\nherein are found in the Appendix at Tab 22.\n107   Tab 22.\n108  TEX. LABOR CODE, Chapter 91 (“STAFF LEASING SERVICES”). The Texas Legislature\namended Chapter 91 in 2013 renaming it “PROFESSIONAL EMPLOYMENT ORGANIZATIONS”.\nThis amendment supports iWORKS’ opposition to Real Party’s continuing assertion that\niWORKS is a staff leasing company. Rather, iWORKS temporary employment service as\nset forth in Chapter 93 of the TEXAS LABOR CODE. Furthermore, effective September 1,\n2013, TEX. LABOR CODE § 93.004(a) holds that a Certificate of Insurance “constitutes proof\nof workers’ compensation insurance coverage for the temporary employment service and\nthe client of the temporary employment service with respect to all employees of the\ntemporary employment services assigned to the client.” Subsection (a) further holds that\n“[t]he state or political subdivision of the state shall accept a certificate of insurance\ncoverage described by this section as proof of worker’s compensation coverage under\nChapter 406.”\n\n                                            29\n\fcompany and its client company, the applicability of the SLSA, and the application\n\nof the borrowed servant doctrine to determine coverage. The appeals panel upheld\n\nthe hearing officer’s determination that the client company was responsible for the\n\nworker’s injury rather than the staffing company. The panel held that:\n\n\n      Texas courts have recognized that a general employee of one\n      employer may become the borrowed servant of another employer.\n      The determinative question then becomes which employer had the\n      right of control of the details and manner in which the employee\n      performed the necessary services. Carr v. Carroll Company, 646\n      S.W.2d 561 (Tex. App.-Dallas 1982, writ ref'd n.r.e.). We note that in\n      Texas Workers’ Compensation Insurance Fund v. DEL Industrial, Inc.,\n      35 S.W.3d 591 (Tex. 2000), the court held that the Staff Services\n      Leasing Act (SSLA), Texas Labor Code Chapter 91, supersedes the\n      common law right-of-control test in determining employer status of\n      leased employees for workers’ compensation purposes. However,\n      (Employer 2) was not licensed under the SSLA. The hearing officer\n      determined that on the date of injury, (Employer 2) was a licensed\n      provider of temporary common workers under Chapter 92 of the\n      Texas Labor Code, entitled Temporary Common Worker Employers\n      (TCWE). In Richmond v. L. D. Brinkman & Co. (Texas) Inc., 36 S.W.3d\n      903 (Tex. App.-Dallas 2001, pet. denied), the court determined that\n      the common law right-of-control test is not superseded by Chapter 92\n      (TCWE) of the Texas Labor Code. The hearing officer is the sole\n      judge of the weight and credibility of the evidence. Section 410.165(a).\n      We conclude that the hearing officer did not err in applying the right-\n      of-control test and in determining that at the time of the injury, the\n      claimant was the borrowed servant of (Employer 1). The hearing\n      officer’s decision is supported by sufficient evidence and is not so\n      against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence as to be\n      clearly wrong and unjust. Cain v. Bain, 709 S.W.2d 175 (Tex. 1986).\n\n\nId. at p. 1-2. The client company also argued that the staffing company should be\n\nresponsible because the client company paid fees to the staffing company which\n\nwent towards worker’s compensation coverage for the temporary employees. The\n\npanel rejected these arguments. Id.\n                                        30\n\f         In Appeals Panel No. 101718 (Division of Worker’s Compensation, March\n\n21, 2011) the appeals panel examined a complex claim involving a contractor, a\n\nsubcontractor, a PEO, and a temporary staffing company. In finding that the\n\nemployee did not suffer a compensable injury the panel had to address issues\n\nrelated to coverage (including whether or not the temporary staffing company’s\n\ncarrier properly terminated coverage), contractual duties between the parties,\n\nliability issues between three different worker’s compensation insurance providers,\n\nemployment status of the claimant, and other related issues.\n\n\n         The legal issues discussed above are all issues that are in play in this case.\n\nThese are issues that the DWC routinely addresses through its administration of\n\nthe Act. These are issues that fall squarely within the exclusive jurisdiction of the\n\nDWC. The trial court does not have subject-matter jurisdiction over these matters\n\nuntil all of the administrative remedies available through the Act have been\n\nexhausted in the same manner as demonstrated in the DWC opinions cited above.\n\n\n         In Morales v. Liberty Mut. Sinc. Co.,109 the Texas Supreme Court addressed\n\nthe issue of the relationship between compensability under the Texas Worker’s\n\nCompensation Act (“the Act”), employee status, and subscriber status.110 The\n\n\n\n109   241 S.W.3d 514 (Tex. 2007).\n110 The Morales Court addressed these issues in the context of determining which\nstandard of review set forth in the Act should apply to judicial review of a final decision\nfrom a DWC appeals panel. If the issues being appealed involve “compensability” then\nthe standard of review is the “modified de novo” standard established by §410.301. Issues\nthat do not address compensability are reviewed under a “substantial-evidence” standard.\n                                            31\n\fCourt held that issues of coverage such as the one in this case fall within the rubric\n\nof the existence of a compensable injury which is properly resolved through the\n\nAct. Morales was killed while repairing a roof on a motel.111 His wife sought death-\n\nbenefits under the act claiming he was injured while in the course and scope of his\n\nemployment with three different employers.112 Two of the employers were insured\n\nunder separate worker’s compensation policies, and the third was a\n\nnonsubscriber.113 The court explained that:\n\n            The existence of a compensable injury is the threshold requirement\n            for payment of benefits under the Act. See TEX. LAB.CODE §§\n            401.011(5), 406.031(a). And there are various elements that affect\n            whether an injury is compensable, including the worker's employment\n            status as an employee or independent contractor at the time of injury,\n            whether the worker was injured in the course and scope of\n            employment, who controlled the employee's work when the injury\n            occurred, and whether a particular employer has an insurance policy\n            in effect. See id. §§ 401.011(12), (18), 401.012(a).\n                   ....\n\n            A dispute about any of these elements regards “compensability or\n            eligibility for . . . benefits” and is subject to judicial review under section\n            410.301.114\n\n            In In Re Tex. Mut. Ins. Co.115 the court addressed the DWC’s exclusive\n\njurisdiction in the context of common law breach of contract claims and disputed\n\n\nMorales, 241 at 516-17. The outcome of this question of compensability also effects\nvenue and the appropriate scope of judicial review.

The Court held that the Fodge decision mandated that the claimant’s\n\nbreach-of-contract claim “is within the Commission’s exclusive jurisdiction.”116 The\n\nCourt also held that:\n\n\n            We likewise reject [Claimant’s] assertions that the Commission’s\n            exclusive jurisdiction over worker’s compensation benefits claims\n            does not extend to determining whether coverage existed at the time\n            of [Claimant’s] injury. The legislature has granted the Commission\n            exclusive jurisdiction over claims for policy benefits. Fodge, 63\n            S.W.3d at 805. In adjudicating such claims, the Commission will\n            necessarily have to interpret compensation policies and determine the\n            period in which coverage existed. Indeed, it appears to routinely do\n            so. See, e.g., Gonzales v. Cigna Ins. Co. of Tex, 924 S.W.2d 183,\n            184-87 (Tex.App.—San Antonio 1996, write denied); Houston Gen.\n            Ins. Co. v. Association Cas. Ins. Co., 972 S.W.2d 634, 636\n            (Tex.App.—Tyler 1998, no pet.).\n            Moreover, [Claimant’s] argument would imply that whenever the\n            Commission, in the exercise of its exclusive jurisdiction, encounters a\n            coverage issue that can be characterized as going to \"policy\n            formation,\" the agency must abate its proceedings pending judicial\n            resolution of the \"formation\" issue. We doubt that the legislature, in\n            conferring exclusive jurisdiction upon the Commission to determine\n            compensation benefits claims, intended such an absurd result that\n            seemingly turns traditional concepts of exclusive jurisdiction on their\n            head.117\n\n\n\n\n116   Id. at 80.\n117   Id.\n\n                                              33\n\fF.     The newly released Crawford opinion confirms the Court’s prior\n       findings that it is the intent of the legislature that the DWC have\n       exclusive jurisdiction out of work-place injury claims and that even\n       artful pleadings will not let Plaintiff’s recast their claims outside of the\n       purview of the Act.\n\n       One week after the trial court denied iWORKS’ plea, the Texas Supreme\n\nCourt issued its opinion in In Re Crawford & Co.118 The Supreme Court held that\n\nthe DWC has exclusive jurisdiction over the Plaintiff’s claims and that the Act\n\nprovided the exclusive remedies, even over plaintiff’s common law claims. The\n\nCrawford Court reversed the Amarillo Court of Appeals and dismissed the\n\nPlaintiff’s district court claims.\n\n       The Crawford opinion both clarifies and expands the Supreme Court’s\n\nholding in Ruttiger.119     In Crawford the Plaintiff sued his employer’s worker’s\n\ncompensation carrier alleging that it improperly denied him benefits from a 1998\n\ninjury. He argued that the carrier engaged in conduct that gave rise to liability\n\nindependent from and unrelated to worker’s compensation and, thus, did not fall\n\nunder the exclusive jurisdiction of the DWC. The Supreme Court rejected this\n\nargument. The critical distinction between this case and Crawford is that the\n\nCrawford plaintiff had already invoked the DWC’s jurisdiction, while the Real Party\n\nhas refused to invoke the DWC’s jurisdiction claiming that Relator is a non-\n\n\n118No. 14-0256 (Tex. February 27, 2015) (per curiam) (a copy is attached to the Appendix\nat Tab 23).\n119“We agree with Crawford that the court of appeals read Ruttiger too narrowly.”\nCrawford at p. 7.\n\n\n\n                                          34\n\fsubscriber under the Texas Labor Code. However, the seminal messages from\n\nthe Texas Supreme Court in Crawford are equally commanding in this case.\n\n         The first seminal message from Crawford is that it is the clearly established\n\nintent of the legislature “that the current Act with its definitions, detailed\n\nprocedures, and dispute resolution processes” be the exclusive remedy for work-\n\nplace injuries, and, moreover, that this “demonstrates legislative intent for there to\n\nbe no alternative remedies.”120 The Court observed that:\n\n         The Act designates the Department of Insurance as the administrative\n         agency responsible “[for overseeing] the workers’ compensation\n         system of this state” and establishes the Division of Workers’\n         Compensation within the Department to “administer and operate” that\n         system. TEX. LAB. CODE § 402.001. It is the Division’s duty to “(1)\n         regulate and administer the business of workers’ compensation in this\n         state; and (2) ensure that [the Act] and other laws regarding workers’\n         compensation are executed.” Id. § 402.00114. The Division must\n         monitor insurance carriers, employers, and others “for compliance\n         with commissioner rules, this subtitle, and other laws relating to\n         workers’ compensation.” Id. § 414.002(a). The Division or its\n         commissioner may impose an array of sanctions against those who\n         fail to comply, including a cease-and-desist order and administrative\n         penalties up to $25,000 per day per occurrence. Id. § 415.021(a). As\n         we explained in Ruttiger, the Act, as substantially revised in 1989,\n         “prescribes     detailed,    [Division]supervised,   time-compressed\n         processes for carriers to handle claims and for dispute resolution” and\n         “has multiple, sometimes redundant but sometimes additive, penalty\n         and sanction provisions for enforcing compliance with its\n         requirements.” 381 S.W.3d at 443121.\n\n\n\n\n120   Crawford at p. 9 (quotes and citations omitted).\n121   Crawford at p. 4.\n                                              35\n\fThus, the broad scope and powerful enforcement provisions provided to the DWC\n\nby the 1989 revisions to the Act evince the legislature’s unequivocal intent that the\n\nDWC be the forum for which work-place injuries are resolved.\n\n         The second seminal message from Crawford is that it is the substance of\n\nthe claims and not the label of the cause of action asserted which determines the\n\nexclusively jurisdiction of the DWC.\n\n         Whether the Act provides the exclusive process and remedies,\n         therefore, does not depend on the label of the cause of action\n         asserted. As we have often explained, claimants may not recast\n         claims to avoid statutory requirements or to qualify for statutory\n         protections. [citations omitted] Instead, in assessing whether a claim\n         falls within the Division’s exclusive jurisdiction, courts must look at the\n         substance of the claim.122\n\nThus, Real Party’s creative and questionable assertion of causes of action\n\nputatively beyond the scope of the Act are of no consequence. The substance of\n\nthis claim is that Real Party was injured at work and is seeking damages for those\n\ninjuries. The Crawford opinion and its predecessors hold that resolution of these\n\nclaims falls under the exclusive jurisdiction of the DWC. Therefore, the trial court\n\ncannot exercise its jurisdiction in this matter until Real Party has exhausted his\n\nadministrative remedies. If is fundamental error for it to do so.\n\n         The crux of Real Party’s adamant disavowal of the DWC’s exclusive\n\njurisdiction is twofold. First is its contention that iWORKS is a non-subscriber. By\n\nmaking this assertion Real Party not only seeks access to the potentially much\n\n\n\n122   Crawford at p. 8.\n\n                                             36\n\fgreater recovery provided by common law remedies, but he also seeks the tactical\n\nadvantage conferred by the Act which would strip away most if Relator’s common-\n\nlaw affirmative defenses, particularly contributory negligence.123 Second is the fact\n\nthat Real Party tested positive for marijuana immediately following his work-place\n\ninjury. The Act provides that an employee that tests positive for marijuana is\n\npresumed intoxicated and that the burden is on that employee to rebut that\n\npresumption.124 The Act further provides that an employee is not entitled to benefits\n\nunder the Act if the injury occurred while he was intoxicated. 125 Thus, Real Party\n\nhas an incredibly strong incentive to avoid the DWC at all costs, both on the upside\n\n(potentially greater remedies) and on the downside (denial of benefits due to\n\nintoxication). “[P]arties cannot avoid exhaustion of administrative remedies\n\nbecause they fear they might not prevail.” In Re Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 295\n\nS.W.3d 327 329 (Tex. 2009).\n\n\n                                 VIII. Conclusion\n         This Court should grant Relator’s request for mandamus relief and dismiss\n\nReal Party’s claims. The trial court does not have subject matter jurisdiction. The\n\nLegislature has made clear through the Act that the DWC has exclusive jurisdiction\n\nover Real Party’s claims and that Real Party must exhaust all of his administrative\n\n\n\n\n123   § 406.033 (a).\n124   § 401.013(c).\n125   § 406.032(1)(A).\n\n                                         37\n\fremedies as set forth in the Act. Real Party has intentionally tried to circumvent\n\nthe act by recasting his work-place injury claims under various common law tort\n\nand contract claims. He has done this in the hope of obtaining more generous\n\ncommon law remedies and out of fear that he will not prevail in the administrative\n\nproceedings due to his presumed intoxication. Creative pleadings notwithstanding,\n\nReal Party’s failure to exhaust his administrative remedies through the DWC\n\nprecludes the trial court from exercising subject matter jurisdiction. The trial court\n\nerred by doing so.\n\n      Real Party’s contention that Relator is a nonsubscriber also has no merit. It\n\nis not supported by the pleadings and the evidence offered to the trial court. Even\n\nif the trial court had taken Real Party’s unsupported claims as true, the Labor Code\n\nand the Administrative Act both mandate as a matter of law that Relator’s policy\n\nwas in effect at the time of Real Party’s on-the-job injury. The Texas Supreme\n\nCourt has made abundantly clear from Ruttiger through Crawford that it is the\n\npublic policy of the State of Texas that the Act be interpreted so as to provide\n\ncoverage. Furthermore, in this matter the question of whether or not Texas Mutual\n\nproperly terminated Relator’s policy goes to compensability and is something that\n\nthe DWC resolves on a regular basis. Thus, it has no impact on the DWC’s\n\nexclusive jurisdiction and, rather, further compels such jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n\n                                         38\n\f                                     IX.

GUILLORY AND MARY                    §             IN THE DISTRICT COURT OF\n GUILLORY                                     §\n                                              §                 HARRIS COUNTY, TEXAS\n V.                                           §\n                                              §\n IWORKS PERSONNEL, INC, ET AL.                §                113TH JUDICIAL DISTRICT\n\n                              IWORKS PERSONNEL, INC.’S\n                              PLEA TO THE JURISDICTION\n\n       DEFENDANTS, iWORKS PERSONNEL, INC., LUIS TREVINO, and HAYDEE\n\nGUTIERREZ (hereinafter “IWORKS”) file this Plea to the Jurisdiction. In support thereof\n\nit would show this honorable Court the following:\n\n                                              I.\n                                        Introduction\n\n       This is a worker’s compensation case.         IWORKS has prefaced almost every\n\npleading it has filed with this assertion. This is because, to date, the great bulk of legal\n\nefforts expended in this case are the direct result of Plaintiffs’ numerous and continued\n\nattempts to circumvent the Texas Labor Code in the face of well settled law and clear\n\npublic policy dictating otherwise. For well over a year Plaintiff’s counsel has had two\n\nseparate worker’s compensation policies which would provide him with worker’s\n\ncompensation coverage. See Exhibit A (iWORKS’) and Exhibit B (Waste Management’s).\n\nNevertheless, Plaintiff has refused to file a claim on either policy even though he would\n\nbegin receiving benefits within fifteen days and despite the fact that this is what is required\n\nby the Texas Labor Code.\n\n       iWORKS has consistently asserted that 1) it is a subscriber to worker’s\n\ncompensation insurance, and 2) that Waste Management is responsible for the worker’s\n\ncompensation coverage for Guillory because a) it executed a hold harmless agreement\n\frelated to Guillory’s employment, and b) it is solely responsible for moving Guillory from\n\nthe duties he was assigned to perform by iWORKS (operation of a front-end loader) and\n\nplacing him in operation of a machine (the Harris Baler) without any notice to iWORKS,\n\nfor failing to provide Guillory with the training and supervision necessary to operate the\n\nHarris Baler safely, and for controlling the scope, manner and details of Guillory’s work in\n\na negligent fashion. For these reasons, iWORKS did not initiate a worker’s compensation\n\nclaim related to Guillory’s work-place injury. Moreover, to the best knowledge of iWORKS,\n\nWaste Management has not filed an Employer’s First Report of Injury or Illness (Form\n\nDWC-001) with its worker’s compensation carrier, Indemnity Insurance Company of North\n\nAmerica (“IICNA”).\n\n        In order to put this matter on the administrative path it should have been on from\n\nits inception, iWORKS has filed an Employers First Report of Injury or Illness (Claim #\n\n1420000952677) with its worker’s compensation carrier, Texas Mutual Insurance\n\nCompany (“TMIC”).1 See Exhibit C. The compensability of Guillory’s injury is now being\n\ndetermined by TMIC claims adjuster Patricia Westin. It is very likely that Texas Mutual\n\nwill seek some form of contribution from IICNA. In the event of an adverse compensability\n\nfinding iWORKS will instigate a Benefit Review Conference with the Texas Department\n\nof Insurance – Division of Worker’s Compensation (“DWC”)2, the first step in exhausting\n\nthe administrative remedies necessary to pursue judicial review.\n\n\n1 By filing a claim on its worker’s compensation insurance, iWORKS does NOT waive or otherwise retreat\nfrom its position that Guillory’s injury is the sole responsibility of Waste Management and/or Guillory and\nexpressly reserves its rights to raise these issues in the administrative proceedings (if any) and any judicial\nreview of any administrative determinations.\n\n2 In 2005, the Legislature abolished the Texas Workers’ Compensation Commission and transferred its\nfunctions to the Texas Department of Insurance-Division of Worker’s Compensation. See Act of May 29,\n2005, 70th Leg., R.A., ch. 265, § 8.001, 2005 Tex. Gen. Laws 469, 607-08. For ease of reference Movant\n\n\n\n\n                                                      2\n\f        The DWC has exclusive jurisdiction over this matter. Plaintiffs’ have not exhausted\n\ntheir administrative remedies. Thus, this Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction and\n\nshould dismiss Plaintiffs’ causes of action.\n\n                                          II.\n                Evidence in Support of iWORKS’ Plea to the Jurisdiction\n\n        Exhibit A –     iWORKS’ Workers’ Compensation Policy\n\n        Exhibit B –     Waste Management’s Workers’ Compensation Policy.\n\n        Exhibit C –     Employer’s First Report of Injury or Illness (DWC-001) filed by\n\n        Exhibit D –     Hold Harmless Agreement\n\n        Exhibit E –     Employee’s Claim for Compensation for a Work-Related Injury or\n                        Occupational Disease (DWC-041) executed Guillory\n\n        Exhibit F –     Affidavit of Luis Trevino\n\n                                                III.\n                                       Factual Background\n\n        IWORKS is a temporary staffing company based out of San Antonio, Texas. It\n\nprovides temporary employees to companies throughout Texas for assignments as short\n\nas one day or as long as six months. IWORKS’ duty is to recruit, screen, interview, and\n\nassign its employees to perform the type of work requested by its clients. The work is to\n\nbe performed at its client’s facilities and under its client’s direct supervision. IWORKS\n\nalso pays the employee’s wages, pays, withholds and transmits payroll taxes, provides\n\nunemployment insurance and worker’s compensation benefits, and handles any\n\nunemployment and worker’s compensation claims for employees we assign to its clients.\n\nIWORKS is not licensed as a staff leasing agency and has never offered staff leasing\n\n\n\nwill refer to any reference to the Division of Worker’s Compensation or any of its predecessor agencies as\n“DWC.”\n\n\n                                                    3\n\fservices. Nor has it ever provided any PEO services. Its sole business is recruiting and\n\nassigning temporary workers as required by its clients. IWORKS provides no site specific\n\ntraining to the temporary workers that it provides to its clients. IWORKS does not\n\nsupervise any of the work performed at its client’s sites. IWORKS has no control over its\n\nclient’s facilities or equipment.\n\n       One of IWORKS’ clients was Waste Management, Inc. (“Waste Management”).\n\nIn July 2012, Waste Management contacted IWORKS’ Houston branch requesting a\n\ntemporary employee who was qualified to operate a front-end loader at Waste\n\nManagement’s Gasmer facility. The provision of heavy equipment operators is not an\n\narea in which IWORKS does a lot of business. Therefore, as a condition of procuring\n\nsuch employees for Waste Management, IWORKS and Waste Management agreed that\n\nIWORKS would locate temporary employees who had experience operating front-end\n\nloaders, but that it would be Waste Management’s responsibility to ensure that\n\nemployees supplied by IWORKS were trained in the safe and proper operation of all\n\nheavy equipment to be operated in their assigned task. IWORKS and Waste\n\nManagement also agreed that Waste Management would be solely responsible for any\n\ndamages related to the operation of the heavy machinery at the Waste Management\n\nfacility by an IWORKS temporary employee, and that Waste Management would hold\n\nIWORKS harmless in the event there was a claim made against them related to the\n\noperation of heavy machinery by an IWORKS temporary employee. See Exhibit D.\n\n       Mose Guillory applied for temporary work with IWORKS and indicated that he had\n\nexperience operating a front-end loader. IWORKS instructed him to report to Waste\n\nManagement’s Gasmer facility to be evaluated. Waste Management reported to\n\n\n\n\n                                            4\n\fIWORKS that Guillory had sufficient skill and experience operating a front-end loader\n\nand Guillory began working at the Waste Management Gasmer facility. From that point\n\nforward IWORKS sole responsibility was to pay Guillory based upon the time sheets\n\nsubmitted by Guillory’s Waste Management supervisors.\n\n           IWORKS did not control any aspect whatsoever of Guillory’s work at the Waste\n\nManagement facility; Waste Management had sole control over the manner and details\n\nof Guillory’s work. IWORKS did not control or even participate in evaluating whether or\n\nnot Guillory possessed sufficient skill to operate a front-end loader; Waste Management\n\nhad sole control in determining whether or not Guillory possessed sufficient skill.\n\nIWORKS did not control any site-specific training for Guillory; Waste Management had\n\nsole control over any site-specific training that Guillory may have needed to perform his\n\nduties at Waste Management’s Gasmer facility.\n\n      The following undisputed facts are alleged in Plaintiff’s Fifth Amended Original\n\nPetition:\n\n\n     Waste Management hired IWORKS to locate temporary employees to work at Waste\n      Management’s Gasmer facility. Petition3, p. 11, ¶26; Petition, Exhibit A\n\n     As a condition of procuring such employees IWORKS and Waste Management\n      executed an agreement which specified that Waste Management was solely\n      responsible for ensuring that the candidates were sufficiently trained in the operation\n      of the heavy machinery. Id., p. 11, ¶26; Petition, Exhibit B\n\n     On July 9, 2012 Guillory applied for a job at IWORKS. Id., p. 11, ¶ 27.\n\n     Guillory was assigned to operate a front-end loader at the Waste Management facility\n      located at 4939 Gasmer Dr., Houston, Texas. Id., p. 11, ¶ 29.\n\n     iWORKS does not provide site specific training as that is the duty of the client\n      company. Id., p. 15, ¶ 41.\n3   Unless otherwise indicated, “Petition” refers to Plaintiff’s Fifth Amended Petition.\n\n\n                                                         5\n\f    When Guillory reported to the Gasmer facility on July 9th he was required to\n     demonstrate his proficiency in driving a front-end loader to a Waste Management\n     employee. Id.\n\n    Waste Management was responsible for determining whether or not Guillory had\n     sufficient experience, training, and skill to operate a front-end loader at Waste\n     Management’s Gasmer facility. Id., p. 11, ¶ 29, p. 14, ¶¶ 40-41.\n\n    Waste Management employee Abraham Hernandez determined that Guillory was\n     sufficiently skilled in operating a front-end loader and instructed him to report for work\n     on July 10, 2012. Id.\n\n    Guillory operated the front-end loader at the Gasmer facility on the day shift from\n     roughly July 10, 2012 to July16, 2012. Id., p. 12, ¶ 30.\n\n    Soon thereafter Guillory moved to the night shift at the Gasmer facility. Id.\n\n    While working on the night shift Waste Management instructed Guillory to operate a\n     Harris Baler. Id., ¶ 31.\n\n    On August 5, 2012 Guillory reported for work on the night shift and began to operate\n     the Harris Baler. Petition, p. 13, ¶ 36.\n\n    During this shift Guillory climbed into the baler which engaged while he was in there,\n     severing his right leg below the knee and severing a portion of his left foot. Id.\n\n                                           IV.\n                                  Arguments & Authorities\n\nA.      This Court does not have subject-matter jurisdiction.\n\n        This Court does not have subject-matter jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims related\n\nto his injury at work. Without subject-matter jurisdiction this Court cannot render a valid\n\njudgment in this matter. City of Houston v. Rhule, 417 S.W.3d 440, 442 (Tex. 2014, per\n\ncurium) (“Subject matter jurisdiction is ‘essential to a court’s power to decide a case’”\n\nquoting Bland Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Blue, 34 S.W.3d 547, 553–54 (Tex.2000)). Subject-\n\nmatter jurisdiction cannot be waived, nor can it be given or taken away by consent. Carroll\n\nv. Carroll, 304 S.W.3d 366, 367 (Tex. 2010); see Rhule, 417 S.W.3d at 442 (“A judgment\n\n\n\n\n                                                6\n\frendered without subject matter jurisdiction cannot be considered final” citing Dubai\n\nPetrol. Co. v. Kazi, 12 S.W.3d 71, 76 (Tex.2000)).\n\n       Lack of subject-matter jurisdiction makes a judgment void, not just voidable. In Re\n\nUnited Servs. Auto Ass’n, 307 S.W.3d 299, 209 (Tex. 2010). Lack of subject-matter\n\njurisdiction is fundamental error and can be raised at any time. Tex. Worker’s Comp.\n\nComm’n v. Garcia, 893 S.W.2d 504, 517 n.15 (Tex. 1995) (noting that a trial court can\n\nquestion its subject-matter jurisdiction even without a motion by either party). Lack of\n\nsubject-matter jurisdiction can even be raised for the first time on appeal. Waco ISD v.\n\nGibson, 22 S.W.3d 849, 851 (Tex. 2000); see Rhule, 417 S.W.3d at 442 (“Not only may\n\na reviewing court assess jurisdiction for the first time on appeal, but all courts bear the\n\naffirmative obligation ‘to ascertain that subject matter jurisdiction exists regardless of\n\nwhether the parties have questioned it.’” quoting In re United Servs. Auto. Ass'n, 307\n\nS.W.3d 299, 306 (Tex.2010)). Furthermore, the failure to grant a plea to the jurisdiction\n\nfor failure to exhaust administrative remedies with the DWC is subject to mandamus\n\nreview.   In Re Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 295 S.W.3d 327, 328 (Tex. 2009) (orig.\n\nproceeding) (per curiam); In Re Liberty Ins. Corp., 321 S.W.3d 630 (Tex.App.—Houston\n\n[14th Dist.] 2010) (orig. proceeding).\n\nB.     The Division of Workers’ Compensation has exclusive jurisdiction.\n\n       This is a worker’s compensation case and falls under the exclusive jurisdiction of\n\nthe Texas Department of Insurance – Division of Worker’s Compensation. As such, this\n\ncourt lacks subject-matter jurisdiction to adjudicate Plaintiffs’ claims until Plaintiffs have\n\nexhausted their administrative remedies through the DWC.\n\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\f        An agency has exclusive jurisdiction “when a pervasive regulatory scheme\n\nindicates that Congress intended for the regulatory process to be the exclusive means of\n\nremedying the problem to which the regulation is address.” Subaru of Am. v. David\n\nMcDavid Nissan, Inc., 84 S.W.3d 212, 221 (Tex. 2002); In Re Mid-Century Ins. Co. of\n\nTex., 426 S.W.3d 169, 172 (Tex.App.—Houston [1st Dist] 2012) (orig. proceeding) (“An\n\nagency has exclusive jurisdiction . . . when a pervasive regulatory scheme reflects\n\nlegislative intent that an agency have the sole power to make the initial determination in\n\nthe dispute.”) Exclusive jurisdiction is a question of law that turns on statutory\n\ninterpretation. See Rhule, 417 S.W.3d at 442 (citing Subaru, 84 S.W.3d at 221. The\n\nTexas Supreme Court held in Saenz v. Fidelity & Guaranty Insurance Underwriters4 that\n\n“the Workers’ Compensation Act vests the power to award compensation benefits solely\n\nin the [DWC]. . ., subject to judicial review.” Saenz, 925 S.W.2d at 612.\n\n        In Tex. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Ruttiger5 the Texas Supreme Court discussed the\n\nsignificant changes the Legislature made to the Worker’s Compensation Act6 (“Act”) in\n\n19897. It noted that the “amendments included significant reforms, among which were\n\nchanges in how to calculating benefits for injured workers, the amount of income benefits\n\nworkers could recover, the dispute resolution process, the addition of an ombudsman\n\nprogram to provide assistance for injured workers who had disputes with insurers, and\n\nincreasing sanctions for violations of the Act.” Id., 381 S.W.2d at 433. The Ruttiger court\n\n\n4 925 S.W.2d 607 (Tex. 1996)\n5 381 S.W.3d 430 (Tex. 2012).\n6 Tex. Lab. Code §§ 401.001 – 506.002.\n7 The Ruttiger opinion addressed the viability of a common-law cause of action for breach of the duty of\n\ngood faith and fair dealing against a worker’s compensation carrier, a cause of action previously approved\nof by the Texas Supreme Court in Arranda v. Ins. Co. of North Amer., 748 S.W.2d 210 (Tex. 1988). The\nRuttiger court held that the 1989 amendments to the Act manifested the Legislatures’ intent to vitiate the\nneed for such a cause of action and expressly overruled Arranda. Id., 381 S.W.3d at 438-56.\n\n\n\n                                                    8\n\fstated that “[t]he purpose of the Act is to provide employees with certainty that their\n\nmedical bills and lost wages will be covered if they are injured.” Id. at 441.\n\n       To accomplish these purposes, the Act provides detailed notice and\n       administrative dispute resolution proceedings that include specific\n       deadlines and incorporate a “conveyor-belt” approach. That is, once the\n       administrative dispute resolution process is initiated, a dispute continues\n       through the process until the dispute is resolved either by the parties or by\n       a binding decision through the resolution procedures.\n\nId. at 441.\n\n       The Ruttiger opinion provides a lengthy description of “the detailed notice and\n\nadministrative dispute resolution proceedings” encompassed by the Act. Id. at 441-43.\n\nIn describing the pervasiveness of the Act the Ruttiger court noted that the Act affords the\n\nDWC significant power to enforce the Act against the various parties in the worker’s\n\ncompensation system. Id. The Ruttiger court concluded:\n\n       It is apparent that the Act prescribes detailed, WCD-supervised, time-\n       compressed processes for carriers to handle claims and for dispute\n       resolution. It has multiple, sometimes redundant but sometimes additive,\n       penalty and sanction provisions for enforcing compliance with its\n       requirements.\n\nId. at 443. The court recognized that allowing an employee to circumvent the act by\n\nasserting common law causes of action would be “inconsistent with the Act’s goals and\n\nlegislative intent exhibited in the act” and could also “result in rewarding an employee who\n\nis dilatory in utilizing the Act’s detailed dispute resolution procedures, regardless of\n\nwhether the delay was intentional or inadvertent, because whether and when the dispute\n\nresolution begins is by and large dependent on the employee.” Id.\n\n       The number of appellate decisions recognizing the DWC’s exclusive jurisdiction\n\nover work-place injuries is voluminous. Both Houston Courts of Appeal have recognized\n\nthe DWC’s exclusive jurisdiction. The Fourteenth held that “[t]he Workers’ Compensation\n\n\n\n                                             9\n\fAct vests the Workers’ Compensation Division with exclusive jurisdiction to determine a\n\nclaimant’s entitlement to medical benefits.” In Re Liberty Insurance Corporation, 321\n\nS.W.3d 630, 636 (Tex.App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2010, orig. proceeding) (granting\n\nRelator’s petition for mandamus relief and dismissing Plaintiff’s case for lack of\n\njurisdiction). Likewise, the First District held that “[t]he Worker’s Compensation Act gives\n\nthe DWC exclusive jurisdiction over certain workers’ compensation disputes relating to\n\nentitlement to medical benefits, preauthorization of medical care and reimbursement of\n\nmedical expenses.” In Re Mid-Century Ins. Co. of Tex., 426 S.W.3d 169, 172 (Tex.App.—\n\nHouston [1st Dist.] 2012, orig. proceeding) (granting Relator’s petition for mandamus).\n\nC. Plaintiff has not exhausted his administrative remedies.\n\n       When an agency has exclusive jurisdiction a party must exhaust its administrative\n\nremedies before seeking recourse through judicial review. Rhule, 417 S.W.2d at 442\n\n(citing Cash Am. Int’l., Inc. v. Bennett, 35 S.W.3d 12, 15 (Tex. 2000); Cunningham\n\nLindsey Claims Mgmt. v. Snyder, 291 S.W.3d 472, 477 (Tex.App.—Houston [14th Dist.]\n\n2009, pet. denied) (“If an agency has exclusive jurisdiction. . . a party must first exhaust\n\nall administrative remedies before a trial court has subject matter jurisdiction.”). “Absent\n\nexhaustion of administrative remedies, a trial court must dismiss the case.” Rhule, 417\n\nS.W.2d at 442 (citing Tex. educ. Agency v. Cypress-Fairbanks I.S.D., 830 S.w.2d 88, 90\n\n(Tex. 1992). There is no question that Guillory has not exhausted his administrative\n\nremedies through the DWC. The question before this court is, “Why?”\n\n       Guillory was injured on August 5, 2012.       Approximately two weeks later, he\n\nexecuted a claim form requesting compensation for a work-related injury. See Exhibit E.\n\nOn that form he stated that he was represented by Bradford J. Gilde. Id. Thus, fifteen\n\n\n\n\n                                            10\n\fdays after his work-related injury (over 2 ½ years ago) Guillory was at a minimum aware\n\nof the potential availability of worker’s compensation benefits. It is also fair to assume\n\nthat his legal representative knew (or had the ability to find out) how to obtain those\n\nbenefits. As was stated above, for almost two years Guillory has had two separate\n\nworker’s compensation policies by which he could have sought benefits. Yet he has made\n\nno effort to invoke his rights under either policy.\n\n       This court has found as a matter of law that Guillory’s claims against Waste\n\nManagement are barred by the “comp bar” defense, yet Guillory still refuses to file a claim\n\non Waste Management’s worker’s compensation policy. The Texas Supreme Court held\n\nin Port Elevator-Brownsville, L.L.C. v. Casados, 358 S.W.3d 238 (Tex., 2012) that a\n\ncompany cannot segregate its temporary employees and permanent employees for\n\npurposes of coverage under its worker’s compensation policy. The Casados court further\n\nnoted that:\n\n       [P]remiums are an issue between the employer and the insurer; they do not\n       affect the employee's coverage. Tex. Emp'rs' Ins. Ass'n v. Stanton, 140\n       S.W.2d 337, 339–40 (Tex.Civ.App.-Amarillo 1940, writ. ref'd) (“[T]he failure\n       to pay the premiums which may be due upon a policy is a matter of no\n       importance as between the insurer and the employee but only concerns the\n       insurer and the employer.”). If Port Elevator's policy had set out certain\n       premiums solely for temporary workers and Port Elevator had not paid those\n       premiums, Casados would still have been covered under the policy and the\n       failure to pay premiums would be an issue between Port Elevator and Texas\n       Mutual. See Coal Operators Cas. Co. v. Richardson, 414 S.W.2d 735, 738\n       (Tex.Civ.App.—Beaumont 1967, writ ref'd n.r.e.) (“This [workers'\n       compensation] protection to plaintiff was not lost because his employer\n       failed to pay the proper premium to the insurance company.”).\n\nId.   at 243-44.    Thus, Guillory is covered under Waste Management’s worker’s\n\ncompensation policy as a matter of law. This may be another reason why Waste\n\n\n\n\n                                              11\n\fManagement has failed to invoke its rights under the Act. See discussion, infra, n. 8\n\n(below).\n\n        The only plausible explanation for Guillory’s failure to even try to claim his benefits\n\nunder the Texas Workers’ Compensation Act is that he and his counsel decided early in\n\nthe course of this litigation to try and circumvent the worker’s compensation system in an\n\nattempt to recover common law damages. Given the extreme nature of Guillory’s injury\n\nit is understandable why he would prefer common law remedies. However, this approach\n\nflies in the face of long standing legal precedence and well-established public policy. As\n\nthe Ruttiger court stated, “the extra-statutory cause of action provides incentive for an\n\ninjured worker to delay using the avenues for immediate relief that the Legislature\n\npainstakingly built into the law” and “distorts the balances struck in the Act and frustrates\n\nthe Legislature’s intent to have disputes resolved quickly and objectively.” Ruttiger, 381\n\nS.W.3d at 451. That is what happened in this case.8\n\n        This is not a factually complicated matter; the basic underlying facts are, for the\n\nmost part, undisputed. However, in his attempt to circumvent the worker’s compensation\n\nsystem, Guillory has had to assert highly questionable causes of action and include\n\nparties that simply have no business being in this litigation. As a result this litigation has\n\nburgeoned into an unnecessarily complicated and contentious morass. It has even\n\nresulted in an award of substantial attorney fees being assessed against Guillory, himself.\n\nNevertheless, Guillory continues down this untenable path fearing that any recognition by\n\n\n\n8 Fairness demands that the same inquiry be directed at both iWORKS and Waste Management: why didn’t\neither one of them file a claim with their worker’s compensation carrier? iWORKS’ position is stated, supra,\nat p. 1-2. iWORKS’ understanding of Waste Management’s position is that the Hold Harmless Agreement\nis unenforceable and that iWORKS has a contractual duty to provide the worker’s compensation coverage\nfor Guillory. This question is now moot given that iWORKS has filed a claim with TMIC and has begun the\nadministrative process required by the Act.\n\n\n                                                    12\n\fhim of a viable worker’s compensation claim will preclude him from his questionable\n\nattempt at recovering common law damages for his work-place injury. This is not how\n\nthe State of Texas wants work-place injuries to be resolved. “[P]arties cannot avoid\n\nexhaustion of administrative remedies because they fear they might not prevail.” In Re\n\nLiberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 295 S.W.3d 327 329 (Tex. 2009).\n\n      The Corpus Christi Court of Appeals provides a concise description of the\n\nadministrative process required to exhaust the DWC administrative remedies.\n\n      The Texas Workers' Compensation Act provides a four-tiered system for\n      the disposition of claims by the DWC. See TEX. LAB. CODE ANN. §§ 410.021–\n      .308 (West 2006 & Supp. 2010). In the first tier, the parties participate in a\n      “benefit review conference” conducted by a “benefit review officer.” TEX.\n      LAB. CODE ANN. §§ 410.021–.034 (West 2006 & Supp.2010). The\n      conference, which is a “nonadversarial, informal dispute resolution\n      proceeding,” is designed to inform the parties regarding the procedures\n      regarding a claim, discuss the facts and issues pertaining to the claim, and\n      “mediate and resolve disputed issues by agreement of the parties.” Id. §\n      410.021(3) (West 2006). “A dispute may be resolved either in whole or in\n      part at a benefit review conference.” Id. § 410.029(a) (West 2006). If the\n      conference results in the resolution of disputed issues or in a settlement,\n      the benefit review officer reduces the agreement to writing and the parties\n      and the officer sign the agreement. Id. § 410.029(b) (West 2006). If the\n      parties fail to resolve all parts of a dispute at the benefit review conference,\n      the benefit review officer similarly prepares a written report that delineates\n      the status of the case. Id. § 410.031 (West 2006).\n\n      In the second tier, “[i]f issues remain unresolved after a benefit review\n      conference,” the parties may agree to arbitrate, and absent such an\n      agreement, the parties may seek relief at a “contested case” hearing. Id. §§\n      410.104, 410.151–.169 (West 2006). In the third tier, a party may seek\n      review by an administrative appeals panel. Id. §§ 410.201–.208 (West\n      2006). Finally, in the fourth tier, a party that has exhausted its administrative\n      remedies may seek judicial review. Id. §§ 410.251–.308 (West 2006).\n\nIn Re New Hampshire Ins. Co., 360 S.W.3d 597 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 2011, pet.\n\ndenied). This is the process that Guillory must exhaust. Only after Guillory has availed\n\nhimself of these administrative remedies may he seek redress in this Court.\n\n\n\n\n                                             13\n\fD.      The DWC has exclusive jurisdiction to determine coverage in this matter.\n        Guillory claims that both iWORKS and Waste Management are non-subscribers.\n\nSee Petition, p. 6, ¶¶ 19-20. iWORKS contends that it had a worker’s compensation policy\n\nin effect at the time of Guillory’s injury. See Exhibit F.9 By raising this coverage issue\n\nPlaintiff hopes to thwart the “worker’s comp bar”10 and avoid resolution of this matter\n\nthrough the DWC. However, this approach does not comport with Texas law. The DWC\n\nhas both the exclusive authority and the administrative ability to resolve these issues.\n\n\n        The DWC routinely addresses these types of issues through its administrative\n\nproceedings. See e.g. Ins. Co. of Pa. v. Hartford Underwriters Ins. Co., 164 S.W.3d 747\n\n(Tex.App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2005, no pet.) (“Though we are not bound by the\n\ndecisions [of the DWC], we find them instructive . . . . “); Houston Gen. Ins. Co. v. Ass’n\n\nCas. ins. Co., 977 S.W.3d 634, 636 (Tex.App.—Tyler 1998, no pet.) (noting that\n\nadministrative decisions, while not binding, are entitled to substantial weight).\n\n\n        In Appeals Panel No. 03066011 (Division of Worker’s Compensation, April 28,\n\n2003) the DWC appeals panel addressed a temporary staffing situation and determined\n\nwhich employer was liable, the proper application of the Staff Leasing Services Act12\n\n(“SLSA”), and approved the use of the borrowed servant doctrine in determining liability.\n\n\n\n9 Exhibit F is the Affidavit of Luis Trevino which is incorporated by reference as if set forth in full herein.\n10 The Texas Workers' Compensation Act provides that the \"exclusive remedy of an employee covered by\nworkers' compensation insurance coverage\" for a work-related injury is \"recovery of workers' compensation\nbenefits\" as provided under the Act. TEX. LAB. CODE ANN. § 408.001(a).\n11 DWC Appeals Panel decisions are available on the Texas Department of Insurance website at\n\nhttp://www.tdi.texas.gov/appeals. Copies of the Appeals Panel decisions cited in this brief are attached\nhereto in an Appendix.\n12 TEX. LABOR CODE, Chapter 91 (“STAFF LEASING SERVICES”). The Texas Legislature amended Chapter 91\n\nin 2013 renaming it “PROFESSIONAL EMPLOYMENT ORGANIZATIONS”. This amendment supports iWORKS’\nopposition to Plaintiff’s proposition that it is a staff leasing company. Rather, iWORKS temporary\n\n\n\n                                                     14\n\f        In Appeals Panel No. 021771 (Division of Worker’s Compensation, September 3,\n\n2002) the appeals panel addressed a matter factually similar to this case analyzing the\n\ninterplay between the contractual obligations between a staffing company and its client\n\ncompany, the applicability of the SLSA, and the application of the borrowed servant\n\ndoctrine to determine coverage.              The appeals panel upheld the hearing officer’s\n\ndetermination that the client company was responsible for the worker’s injury rather than\n\nthe staffing company. The panel held that:\n\n\n        Texas courts have recognized that a general employee of one employer\n        may become the borrowed servant of another employer. The determinative\n        question then becomes which employer had the right of control of the details\n        and manner in which the employee performed the necessary services. Carr\n        v. Carroll Company, 646 S.W.2d 561 (Tex. App.-Dallas 1982, writ ref'd\n        n.r.e.). We note that in Texas Workers’ Compensation Insurance Fund v.\n        DEL Industrial, Inc., 35 S.W.3d 591 (Tex. 2000), the court held that the Staff\n        Services Leasing Act (SSLA), Texas Labor Code Chapter 91, supersedes\n        the common law right-of-control test in determining employer status of\n        leased employees for workers’ compensation purposes. However,\n        (Employer 2) was not licensed under the SSLA. The hearing officer\n        determined that on the date of injury, (Employer 2) was a licensed provider\n        of temporary common workers under Chapter 92 of the Texas Labor Code,\n        entitled Temporary Common Worker Employers (TCWE). In Richmond v. L.\n        D. Brinkman & Co. (Texas) Inc., 36 S.W.3d 903 (Tex. App.-Dallas 2001,\n        pet. denied), the court determined that the common law right-of-control test\n        is not superseded by Chapter 92 (TCWE) of the Texas Labor Code. The\n        hearing officer is the sole judge of the weight and credibility of the evidence.\n        Section 410.165(a). We conclude that the hearing officer did not err in\n        applying the right-of-control test and in determining that at the time of the\n        injury, the claimant was the borrowed servant of (Employer 1). The hearing\n        officer’s decision is supported by sufficient evidence and is not so against\n        the great weight and preponderance of the evidence as to be clearly wrong\n        and unjust. Cain v. Bain, 709 S.W.2d 175 (Tex. 1986).\n\n\nemployment service as set forth in Chapter 93 of the TEXAS LABOR CODE. Furthermore, effective September\n1, 2013, TEX. LABOR CODE § 93.004(a) holds that a Certificate of Insurance “constitutes proof of workers’\ncompensation insurance coverage for the temporary employment service and the client of the temporary\nemployment service with respect to all employees of the temporary employment services assigned to the\nclient.” Subsection (a) further holds that “[t]he state or political subdivision of the state shall accept a\ncertificate of insurance coverage described by this section as proof of worker’s compensation coverage\nunder Chapter 406.”\n\n\n                                                    15\n\fId. at p. 1-2. The client company also argued that the staffing company should be\n\nresponsible because the client company paid fees to the staffing company which went\n\ntowards worker’s compensation coverage for the temporary employees.                The panel\n\nrejected these arguments. Id.\n\n\n          In Appeals Panel No. 101718 (Division of Worker’s Compensation, March 21,\n\n2011) the appeals panel examined a complex claim involving a contractor, a\n\nsubcontractor, a PEO, and a temporary staffing company. In finding that the employee\n\ndid not suffer a compensable injury the panel had to address issues related to coverage\n\n(including whether or not the temporary staffing company’s carrier properly terminated\n\ncoverage), contractual duties between the parties, liability issues between three different\n\nworker’s compensation insurance providers, employment status of the claimant, and\n\nother related issues.\n\n\n          The legal issues discussed above are all issues that are in play in this case. These\n\nare issues that the DWC routinely addresses through its administration of the Act. These\n\nare issues that fall squarely within the exclusive jurisdiction of the DWC. This court does\n\nnot have subject-matter jurisdiction over these matters until all of the administrative\n\nremedies available through the Act have been exhausted.\n\n\n          In Morales v. Liberty Mut. Sinc. Co.13, the Texas Supreme Court addressed the\n\nissue of the relationship between compensability under the Texas Worker’s\n\n\n\n\n13   241 S.W.3d 514 (Tex. 2007).\n\n\n\n                                               16\n\fCompensation Act (“the Act”), employee status, and subscriber status.14 The Court held\n\nthat issues of coverage such as the one in this case fall within the rubric of the existence\n\nof a compensable injury which is properly resolved through the Act. Morales was killed\n\nwhile repairing a roof on a motel. Id. at 515. His wife sought death-benefits under the\n\nact claiming he was injured while in the course and scope of his employment with three\n\ndifferent employers. Id. Two of the employers were insured under separate worker’s\n\ncompensation policies, and the third was a nonsubscriber. Id.\n\n        The existence of a compensable injury is the threshold requirement for\n        payment of benefits under the Act. See TEX. LAB.CODE §§ 401.011(5),\n        406.031(a). And there are various elements that affect whether an injury is\n        compensable, including the worker's employment status as an employee or\n        independent contractor at the time of injury, whether the worker was injured\n        in the course and scope of employment, who controlled the employee's\n        work when the injury occurred, and whether a particular employer has an\n        insurance policy in effect. See id. §§ 401.011(12), (18), 401.012(a).\n\n                ....\n\n        A dispute about any of these elements regards “compensability or eligibility\n        for . . . benefits” and is subject to judicial review under section 410.301.\n\nMorales v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 241 S.W.3d at 519. iWORKS has consistently claimed\n\nthat it has a worker’s compensation policy and that Waste Management controlled the\n\nGuillory’s work when his injury occurred. These are issues within the purview of the Act\n\nand over which the DWC has exclusive jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n\n14 The Morales Court addressed these issues in the context of determining which standard of review set\nforth in the Act should apply to judicial review of a final decision from a DWC appeals panel. If the issues\nbeing appealed involve “compensability” then the standard of review is the “modified de novo” standard\nestablished by §410.301. Issues that do not address compensability are reviewed under a “substantial-\nevidence” standard. Morales, 241 at 516-17. The outcome of this question of compensability also effects\nvenue and the appropriate scope of judicial review. Id.\n\n\n\n                                                    17\n\f          In In Re Tex. Mut. Ins. Co.15 the court addressed the DWC’s exclusive jurisdiction\n\nin the context of common law breach of contract claims and disputed coverage. The Court\n\nheld that the Fodge decision mandated that the claimant’s breach-of-contract claim “is\n\nwithin the Commission’s exclusive jurisdiction.” Id., 157 S.W.3d at 80. The Court also\n\nheld that:\n\n\n          We likewise reject [Claimant’s] assertions that the Commission’s exclusive\n          jurisdiction over worker’s compensation benefits claims does not extend to\n          determining whether coverage existed at the time of [Claimant’s] injury. The\n          legislature has granted the Commission exclusive jurisdiction over claims\n          for policy benefits. Fodge, 63 S.W.3d at 805. In adjudicating such claims,\n          the Commission will necessarily have to interpret compensation policies\n          and determine the period in which coverage existed. Indeed, it appears to\n          routinely do so. See, e.g., Gonzales v. Cigna Ins. Co. of Tex, 924 S.W.2d\n          183, 184-87 (Tex.App.—San Antonio 1996, write denied); Houston Gen.\n          Ins. Co. v. Association Cas. Ins. Co., 972 S.W.2d 634, 636 (Tex.App.—Tyler\n          1998, no pet.).\n          Moreover, [Claimant’s] argument would imply that whenever the\n          Commission, in the exercise of its exclusive jurisdiction, encounters a\n          coverage issue that can be characterized as going to \"policy formation,\" the\n          agency must abate its proceedings pending judicial resolution of the\n          \"formation\" issue. We doubt that the legislature, in conferring exclusive\n          jurisdiction upon the Commission to determine compensation benefits\n          claims, intended such an absurd result that seemingly turns traditional\n          concepts of exclusive jurisdiction on their head.\nId. at p.\n\n\n          Nor does iWORKS’ delay in reporting Guillory’s injury to its insurance carrier\n\npreclude it from invoking the administrative procedures of the Act. See Hand v. SGS\n\nControl Servs., Inc., 409 S.W.3d 743, 749 (Tex.App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2013). The court\n\nheld that “[the employer] ‘invoked” its workers’ compensation insurance coverage when\n\nit initially obtained the coverage; it was not required to take an specific action to ‘invoke’\n\n\n\n15   157 S.W.3d 75 (Tex.App.—Austin 2004, orig. proceeding).\n\n\n                                                   18\n\fthat coverage after [Plaintiff] was injured, and it did not forfeit its protections under the\n\nWorkers’ Compensation Act when it failed to notify its insurance carrier of Reagan’s injury\n\nin a timely manner.” Id.\n\n                                            V.\n                                        Conclusion\n\n       This is a workers’ compensation case which should have been filed with the DWC\n\nover two years ago. For the various reasons discussed above, none of the parties were\n\neager to do so. iWORKS’ has relented and filed a claim with its worker’s compensation\n\ncarrier. This will start the administrative process necessary to exhaust the remedies\n\nprovided by the DWC. However, until those remedies are fully exhausted this Court lacks\n\nsubject-matter jurisdiction. Therefore, this Court must dismiss Plaintiffs’ claims as a\n\nmatter of law.\n\n                                             VI.\n                                           Prayer\n\n       Defendants iWORKS, Trevino, and Gutierrez pray that the Court grant the relief\n\nrequested herein and for any and all other relief to which they are entitled in law or equity.\n\n                                           Respectfully submitted,\n\n\n                                           ___/s/_David N.

GUILLORY AND MARY                    §            IN THE DISTRICT COURT OF\n GUILLORY                                     §\n                                              §               HARRIS COUNTY, TEXAS\n V.                                           §\n                                              §\n IWORKS PERSONNEL, INC, ET AL.                §               113TH JUDICIAL DISTRICT\n\n                    IWORKS PERSONNEL, INC.’S SUPPLEMENT TO\n                       iWORKS’ PLEA TO THE JURISDICTION\n\n         DEFENDANTS, iWORKS PERSONNEL, INC., LUIS TREVINO, and HAYDEE\n\nGUTIERREZ (hereinafter “IWORKS”) file this Supplement to iWORKS’ Plea to the\n\nJurisdiction. In support thereof it would show this honorable Court the following:\n\n                                             I.\n\n         iWORKS files this Supplement to iWORKS’ Plea to the Jurisdiction in order to\n\npresent to the Court additional evidence, recently obtained, which supports its Plea to the\n\nJurisdiction.\n\n      A. Exhibit G – Texas Mutual Claim\n\n         Exhibit G is Texas Mutual Insurance Company’s acknowledgement of a claim for\n\nMose Guillory.     This shows that there is a pending matter subject to the exclusive\n\njurisdiction of the Texas Department of Insurance – Division of Workers’ Compensation\n\n(“DWC”). Until this administrative process has run its course and Plaintiff has exhausted\n\nall of his administrative remedies, this Court lacks subject-matter-jurisdiction.\n\n      B. Exhibit H – Correspondence from Gilde to the DWC\n\n         Exhibit H is correspondence that was produced this week by Plaintiff’s counsel.\n\nThis is a letter from Brad Gilde to the DWC dated August 12, 2013. It is styled as a\n\n“Notice, Stay, and Preservation Letter.”      Although litigation was ongoing and both\n\fiWORKS and Waste Management were represented by counsel,1 neither Defendant was\n\ncopied on this correspondence. Plaintiff attached two separate DWC-041 (“Employee’s\n\nClaim for Compensation for a Work-Related Injury of Occupational Disease”) forms to the\n\nletter.    One names iWORKS as Plaintiff’s employer and the other names Waste\n\nManagement as his employer. Thus, Plaintiff’s counsel recognized that Plaintiff had a\n\nclaim for compensation under two separate worker’s compensation policies and elected\n\nto forego pursuing those claims.\n\n          Gilde’s letter to the DWC purports to reserve Plaintiff’s right to seek relief from the\n\nDWC in the event he is unsuccessful in this Court. This approach turns the purpose of\n\nthe entire worker’s compensation system on its head. This letter demonstrates that\n\nPlaintiff was well aware of the requirements under the Texas Labor Code yet consciously\n\nchose to attempt to circumvent that process in hopes of a common law verdict. This is\n\nnot the public policy of Texas.\n\n          This letter to the DWC admits that it “is submitted: (1) as a notice of claim for\n\ncompensation . . . (3) as a preservation of right to file and seek a claim for compensation\n\n. . . and (5) pursuant to Tex. Labor Code §409.004.” Ex. G (emphasis in original). The\n\nletter further states that “. . . this letter . . . is not an election or denial of a claim for\n\ncoverage.” Id. Plaintiff cannot hedge his bets with the administrative agency while\n\nimproperly seeking a judicial remedy in this Court without first exhausting his\n\nadministrative remedies.         His failure to do so in this matter, despite knowing the\n\nadministrative requirements set forth in the Texas Labor Code, deprives this Court of\n\nsubject-matter jurisdiction over Plaintiff’s claims.\n\n                                                  II.\n\n1   At that time Aric Garza was counsel for iWORKS.\n\f                                           Prayer\n\n       Defendants iWORKS, Trevino, and Gutierrez pray that the Court grant the relief\n\nrequested in their Plea to the Jurisdiction and for any and all other relief to which they are\n\nentitled in law or equity.\n\n                                           Respectfully submitted,\n\n\n                                           ___/s/_David N.

       MANAGEMENT, INC., PATSY HOGAN AND OLD REPUBLIC INSURANCE\n                              COMPANY, RELATORS\n\n            ══════════════════════════════════════════\n                      ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS\n            ══════════════════════════════════════════\n\n                                          PER CURIAM\n\n       Relators in this mandamus proceeding contend that the trial court abused its discretion\n\nwhen it refused to dismiss claims over which the Division of Workers’ Compensation has\n\nexclusive jurisdiction. Because all of the claims arise out of relators’ investigation, handling, and\n\nsettling of claims for workers’ compensation benefits, we agree.\n\n       In 1998, Glenn Johnson suffered traumatic and debilitating injuries while working for\n\nASARCO. The parties do not dispute that Johnson was severely injured or that he is entitled to\n\nreceive lifetime workers’ compensation benefits. Disputes over the details and amounts of those\n\nbenefits, however, led Johnson to request a benefit review conference in 2008, which led to a\n\ncontested case hearing the following year. It appears from the parties’ briefs that the suit for\n\njudicial review of that decision remains pending in the district court.\n\n       Meanwhile, separate from the administrative proceedings, Johnson and his wife, Natalie,\n\nfiled the underlying suit against ASARCO’s workers’ compensation insurance provider Old\n\nRepublic Insurance Company; its claims services contractors Crawford & Company and Crawford\n\n& Company Healthcare Management, Inc.; and their employee Patsy Hogan (collectively,\n\fCrawford). The Johnsons allege that, over a period of nearly ten years, Crawford engaged in “a\n\nbattle plan to delay, discourage and deny” benefits that the Johnsons were entitled to receive.\n\nSpecifically, the Johnsons contend that Crawford (a) wrongfully disputed, denied, and delayed\n\nmedical benefits, (b) misrepresented which benefits were and were not covered, (c) failed to\n\nprovide required notices and other information, (d) repeatedly agreed to pay for benefits and\n\nservices but then refused to do so, (e) performed inadequate and misleading investigations into the\n\nJohnsons’ claim for benefits, and (f) falsely accused the Johnsons of insurance fraud, leading to\n\ntheir wrongful arrests and a two-year prosecution that ultimately terminated in the Johnsons’ favor.\n\nIn short, the Johnsons allege that, “[r]ather than manage the claim” and adjust it “in a fair and\n\nreasonable manner,” Crawford “resorted to combat tactics to wreak havoc on Glenn’s and\n\nNatalie’s lives.”\n\n       Based on these allegations, the Johnsons pled numerous causes of action, some sounding\n\nin tort (negligence; gross negligence; negligent, fraudulent, and intentional misrepresentation;\n\nfraud; fraud by non-disclosure; fraudulent inducement; intentional infliction of emotional distress;\n\nmalicious prosecution; and conspiracy); some sounding in contract (breach of contract; quantum\n\nmeruit; and breach of the common law duty of good faith and fair dealing); and some alleging\n\nviolations of statutory duties (under the Texas Insurance Code and the Texas Deceptive Trade\n\nPractices Act). The Johnsons sought relief in the form of actual damages for physical injuries,\n\nmental injuries, loss of income, and loss of reputation; exemplary damages; statutory damages;\n\nand injunctive relief prohibiting Crawford from continuing to engage in such “extreme and\n\noutrageous” conduct.\n\n       The Johnsons specifically pled that the Texas Workers’ Compensation Act does not require\n\nthem to pursue their claims through its administrative procedures or otherwise exhaust\n\n\n\n                                                 2\n\fadministrative remedies because (1) the Act’s administrative procedures do not apply to some of\n\ntheir claims; (2) Crawford’s “subterfuge” of the workers’ compensation system relieves the\n\nJohnsons from any duties under that system; and (3) the Johnsons are seeking to recover for\n\n“independent injuries . . . that are unrelated to [Glenn’s] workers[’] compensation injuries and the\n\nbenefits that he is entitled to under that system.” While the Johnsons agree that they must pursue\n\ntheir claims for workers’ compensation benefits through the administrative process, they contend\n\nthat they can pursue these claims for additional, independent, and “unrelated” damages in the\n\ncourts.\n\n          Crawford disagreed and filed a plea to the jurisdiction and motion for summary judgment.\n\nRelying primarily on our decision in Texas Mutual Insurance Co. v. Ruttiger, 381 S.W.3d 430\n\n(Tex. 2012), Crawford argued that the Texas Department of Insurance Division of Workers’\n\nCompensation has exclusive jurisdiction over all of the Johnsons’ claims because they arise out of\n\nthe workers’ compensation claims-handling process. Conceding that the claims for malicious\n\nprosecution and for intentional infliction of emotional distress could “arguably survive the\n\nlandmark decision in Ruttiger,” Crawford alternatively asserted that no evidence supported those\n\nclaims. The trial court dismissed the Johnsons’ claims for breach of the common law duty of good\n\nfaith and fair dealing and for violations of the Texas Insurance Code but refused to dismiss any of\n\nthe other claims. The court of appeals denied Crawford’s petition for mandamus relief.1\n\n\n\n\n          1\n           ___ S.W.3d ___. The court of appeals concluded that Crawford is not entitled to mandamus relief because\n(1) “one could interpret” Crawford’s five-month delay in filing its petition for writ of mandamus, shortly before trial,\nas an “effort to further hinder the timely adjudication of the Johnsons’ claims”; (2) even if the court could review the\ndenial of Crawford’s plea to the jurisdiction by mandamus, Crawford has not shown that “unrelated topics appearing\nin the motion for summary judgment may also be reviewed via the same proceeding”; (3) the Johnsons created a fact\nissue by certifying through their counsel that they had exhausted all administrative remedies; and (4) “claims of\nmalicious prosecution inherently involve activity or misconduct outside the administrative avenues created by the\nworkers’ compensation laws,” nothing in the Act “purports to regulate such conduct or remedy . . . damages unrelated\nto the amount of workers’ compensation benefits to which an employee may be entitled,” and “because at least one\n\n                                                           3\n\f         We conclude that the Division of Workers’ Compensation has exclusive jurisdiction over\n\nthe Johnsons’ claims and the Workers’ Compensation Act provides their exclusive remedies. The\n\nAct designates the Department of Insurance as the administrative agency responsible “[for\n\noverseeing] the workers’ compensation system of this state” and establishes the Division of\n\nWorkers’ Compensation within the Department to “administer and operate” that system. TEX. LAB.\n\nCODE § 402.001. It is the Division’s duty to “(1) regulate and administer the business of workers’\n\ncompensation in this state; and (2) ensure that [the Act] and other laws regarding workers’\n\ncompensation are executed.” Id. § 402.00114. The Division must monitor insurance carriers,\n\nemployers, and others “for compliance with commissioner rules, this subtitle, and other laws\n\nrelating to workers’ compensation.” Id. § 414.002(a). The Division or its commissioner may\n\nimpose an array of sanctions against those who fail to comply, including a cease-and-desist order\n\nand administrative penalties up to $25,000 per day per occurrence. Id. § 415.021(a). As we\n\nexplained in Ruttiger, the Act, as substantially revised in 1989, “prescribes detailed, [Division]-\n\nsupervised, time-compressed processes for carriers to handle claims and for dispute resolution”\n\nand “has multiple, sometimes redundant but sometimes additive, penalty and sanction provisions\n\nfor enforcing compliance with its requirements.” 381 S.W.3d at 443.\n\n         In light of the Act’s comprehensive system for resolving workers’ compensation claims 2\n\nand the Division’s role in that process, we concluded in Ruttiger that the Act provides the exclusive\n\nprocedures and remedies for claims alleging that a workers’ compensation carrier has improperly\n\n\n\ncause of action continues to exist, despite Ruttiger, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing\nto dismiss all the causes of action.” Id. at ___.\n\n         2\n           See Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Adcock, 412 S.W.3d 492, 495 (Tex. 2013) (explaining that “the Legislature\ndevised a comprehensive workers’ compensation system, with specific benefits and procedures based on the public\npolicy of the State of Texas. We concluded in Ruttiger that the Court should not alter the Act’s comprehensive scheme,\nand we reaffirm that principle today.”).\n\n\n                                                            4\n\finvestigated, handled, or settled a workers’ claim for benefits. Specifically, we held that the worker\n\nin that case could not recover against the carrier for violations of section 541.060 of the Texas\n\nInsurance Code, which prohibits all insurance carriers generally (not just workers’ compensation\n\ncarriers) from engaging in “unfair settlement practices with respect to a claim by an insured.” TEX.\n\nINS. CODE § 541.060(a). “Permitting a workers’ compensation claimant to additionally recover by\n\nsimply suing under general provisions of Insurance Code section 541.060,” we explained, “would\n\nbe inconsistent with the structure and detailed processes of the Act.” Ruttiger, 381 S.W.3d at 443.\n\nWe concluded that the Act’s “provisions for dispute resolution and remedies for failing to comply\n\nwith those provisions in the workers’ compensation context are exclusive of those in section\n\n541.060.” Id. at 444.3\n\n        We also held that the claimant in Ruttiger could not recover on his claims under section\n\n542.003(a)(3) of the Insurance Code, which requires insurers to “adopt and implement reasonable\n\nstandards for the prompt investigation of claims arising under the insurer’s policies.” TEX. INS.\n\nCODE § 542.003(a)(3). “[I]n light of the specific substantive and procedural requirements built into\n\nthe Act,” we concluded, “and the detrimental effects on carriers flowing from penalties that can be\n\nimposed for failing to comply with those requirements, the Legislature did not intend for workers’\n\ncompensation claimants to have a cause of action against the carrier under the general provision\n\nof section 542.003.” Ruttiger, 381 S.W.3d at 445.\n\n        For the same reasons, we also overruled our precedent that pre-dated the current version of\n\nthe Act and held that “an injured employee may not assert a common-law claim for breach of the\n\nduty of good faith and fair dealing against a workers’ compensation carrier.” Id. at 433 (overruling\n\nAranda v. Ins. Co. of N. Am., 748 S.W.2d 210 (Tex. 1988)). We reasoned that allowing the carrier\n\n\n        3\n          We likewise held that the claimant could not recover on his DTPA claim because that claim, “as pled and\nsubmitted to the jury[,] depended on the validity of his Insurance Code claim[s].” Ruttiger, 381 S.W.3d at 446.\n\n                                                       5\n\fto risk common law liability in addition to liability under the Act “distorts the balances struck in\n\nthe Act and frustrates the Legislature’s intent to have disputes resolved quickly and objectively.”\n\nId. at 451. “Recognizing and respecting the Legislature’s prime position in enacting, studying,\n\nanalyzing, and reforming the system, and its efforts in having done that,” we concluded that “[t]he\n\nAct effectively eliminates the need for a judicially imposed cause of action outside the\n\nadministrative processes and other remedies in the Act.” Id.\n\n       We did not hold in Ruttiger, however, that the Act bars every statutory and common law\n\nclaim that can be asserted against a workers’ compensation carrier. To the contrary, we concluded\n\nthat the Act did not bar a claim under section 541.061 of the Insurance Code, which makes it\n\nunlawful for an insurer to “misrepresent an insurance policy.” Id. at 445–46; see also TEX. INS.\n\nCODE § 541.061. We explained that, “[u]nlike section 541.060,” which prohibits unfair settlement\n\npractices, “section 541.061 does not specify that it applies in the context of settling claims.”\n\nRuttiger, 381 S.W.3d at 446. We held that because section 541.061’s prohibition against\n\nmisrepresentation of an insurance policy “does not evidence intent that it be applied in regard to\n\nsettling claims, it is not at odds with the dispute resolution process of the workers’ compensation\n\nsystem.” Id. We ultimately concluded, however, that there was no evidence to support the section\n\n541.061 claim in that case because there was no evidence of an “untrue statement made by [the\n\ninsurer] regarding the policy or any statement about the policy that misled [the plaintiff-insured].”\n\nId.\n\n       In summary, we held in Ruttiger that workers’ compensation carriers cannot be liable under\n\nthe Insurance Code for unfair claims settlement practices or for failing to adopt reasonable\n\nstandards for investigating claims, or under the common law for breach of a duty of good faith and\n\nfair dealing, because these claims “simply are not compatible with amended detailed procedural\n\n\n\n                                                 6\n\fand substantive provisions of the new Act.” Id. at 456. Although we agreed that “the new Act’s\n\nlanguage does not purport to preclude all types of claims against workers’ compensation insurers,”\n\nwe concluded that, for claims arising out of the claims-settlement process, “the current Act with\n\nits definitions, detailed procedures, and dispute resolution process demonstrate[s] legislative intent\n\nfor there to be no alternative remedies.” Id. at 444, 456.\n\n         In this case, the parties dispute whether and how Ruttiger applies to causes of action that\n\nwe did not specifically address in that case. The court of appeals concluded that it “is not as clear”\n\nthat we “vitiated the existence of” any other claims in Ruttiger because we “said nothing of” them.\n\n___ S.W.3d ___. The court read our Ruttiger decision to focus on whether the claims are\n\n“inconsistent with the current legislative/administrative workers’ compensation scheme,” and\n\nconcluded that neither Ruttiger nor Crawford explains how a malicious prosecution claim asserting\n\n“baseless criminal proceedings by an insurer against an employee and the amelioration of damages\n\ncaused by such misconduct fits in the legislative/administrative workers’ compensation scheme.”\n\nId. at ___. The court concluded that a malicious prosecution claim “does not serve to protect,\n\nsecure or timely resolve disputes involving the availability of workers’ compensation benefits due\n\na claimant,” and “because at least one cause of action continues to exist, despite Ruttiger, [the\n\ncourt could not] say that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to dismiss all the causes of\n\naction.” Id.\n\n         We agree with Crawford that the court of appeals read Ruttiger too narrowly. As other\n\ncourts of appeals have recognized,4 the rule we applied in Ruttiger is that the Act provides the\n\n\n         4\n            See, e.g., Davis v. Am. Cas. Co. of Reading, Pa., No. 07-13-00190-CV, 2014 WL 2553379, at *2 (Tex.\nApp.—Amarillo June 4, 2014, pet. denied) (holding that Ruttiger precludes claims for breach of contract, breach of\nthe duty of good faith and fair dealing, Insurance Code and DTPA violations, and negligence because all claims “arise\nout of [the carrier’s] handling of [the] workers’ compensation claim”); Hopper v. Argonaut Ins. Co., No. 03-12-00734-\nCV, 2013 WL 5853747, at *4 (Tex. App.—Austin Oct. 18, 2013, no pet.) (mem. op.) (holding that Ruttiger\n“eliminates” claims because there is no evidence of any “conduct that does not implicate the claim-settlement process”\nand all claims “are limited to complaints about delays, claim handling, and disputes regarding entitlement to benefits”);\n\n                                                           7\n\fexclusive process and remedies for claims arising out of a carrier’s investigation, handling, or\n\nsettling of a claim for workers’ compensation benefits. We held that the Act bars claims for breach\n\nof the duty of good faith and fair dealing and claims under sections 541.060 and 542.003, not\n\nbecause those are the only claims the Act bars, but because those claims are necessarily based on\n\nthe investigation and settlement of benefit claims. Ruttiger, 381 S.W.3d at 443–45. Similarly, we\n\nheld that the Act did not bar the claim under section 541.061, not because that is the only claim\n\nthe Act does not bar, but because that section does not address misrepresentations made “in regard\n\nto settling claims” for benefits. Id. at 446.\n\n        Whether the Act provides the exclusive process and remedies, therefore, does not depend\n\non the label of the cause of action asserted. As we have often explained, claimants may not recast\n\nclaims to avoid statutory requirements or to qualify for statutory protections. See Diversicare Gen.\n\nPartner, Inc. v. Rubio, 185 S.W.3d 842, 851 (Tex. 2005) (focusing on the essence of plaintiff’s\n\nclaim and finding it had to meet MLIIA requirements) (citing MacGregor Med. Ass’n v. Campbell,\n\n985 S.W.2d 38, 38 (Tex. 1998); Gormley v. Stover, 907 S.W.2d 448, 450 (Tex. 1995) (per curiam)\n\n(finding that plaintiff’s pleading was an attempt to recast malpractice claim as a DTPA action);\n\nSorokolit v. Rhodes, 889 S.W.2d 239, 242 (Tex. 1994) (emphasizing that health care liability claim\n\ncould not be re-cast as a different claim)). Instead, in assessing whether a claim falls within the\n\nDivision’s exclusive jurisdiction, courts must look at the substance of the claim. Id.\n\n\n\n\nBean v. Tex. Mut. Ins. Co., No. 09-11-00123-CV, 2012 WL 5450826, at *1 (Tex. App.—Beaumont Nov. 8, 2012, no\npet.) (mem. op.) (holding that claims “are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Texas Department of Insurance”\nbecause they “concern[] the claims handling process”); Carpenter v. Sw. Med. Examination Servs., Inc., 381 S.W.3d\n583, 585–87 (Tex. App.—Eastland 2012, no pet.) (applying Ruttiger to hold that the Act precludes claims for\ncommon-law bad faith, statutory bad faith, fraud, and conspiracy to commit fraud based on allegations that carrier\ndelayed paying benefits and concealed the nature of its relationship with reviewing doctor because the claims related\nto “the manner in which the carrier had handled the processing of [the] workers’ compensation claim”).\n\n\n                                                         8\n\f       Nor does the Ruttiger rule depend on the nature of the relief the claimant seeks. The\n\nJohnsons contend that the Act does not bar their claims because they are seeking damages that are\n\n“unrelated” to workers’ compensation benefits and based on injuries that are “independent” of\n\nharm the Act is intended to prevent. As we noted in Ruttiger, however, “the current Act with its\n\ndefinitions, detailed procedures, and dispute resolution process demonstrat[es] legislative intent\n\nfor there to be no alternative remedies.” 381 S.W.3d at 444.\n\n       Applying the Ruttiger rule to this case, we first conclude that the Act bars the Johnsons’\n\nclaims for negligence, gross negligence, breach of contract, quantum meruit, breach of the duty of\n\ngood faith and fair dealing, and statutory violations. In support of these causes of action, the\n\nJohnsons allege that Crawford failed to act reasonably in responding to the Johnsons’ claims for\n\nbenefits and made and then breached promises and representations that it would pay certain\n\nbenefits. Because all of these claims arise out of Crawford’s investigation, handling, and settling\n\nof the Johnsons’ claim for workers’ compensation benefits, the Act provides the exclusive\n\nprocedures and remedies for these claims.\n\n       We reach the same conclusion regarding all of the Johnsons’ common law and statutory\n\ncauses of action based on allegations of deception, fraud, and misrepresentation. Because we held\n\nin Ruttiger that the Act does not necessarily bar a claim for misrepresenting an insurance policy\n\nunder section 541.061 of the Insurance Code, our analysis on these claims is a bit more complex.\n\nThe Johnsons contend that our holding in Ruttiger confirms that they can pursue all of their claims\n\nfor misrepresentation and fraud. But we based our holding in Ruttiger on the fact that “section\n\n541.061 does not specify that it applies in the context of settling claims.” Ruttiger, 381 S.W.3d at\n\n446. We held that, because section 541.061 “does not evidence intent that it be applied in regard\n\n\n\n\n                                                 9\n\fto settling claims, it is not at odds with the dispute resolution process of the workers’ compensation\n\nsystem.” Id.\n\n         This case presents a question we did not expressly address in Ruttiger: whether the Division\n\nhas exclusive jurisdiction over a claim for “misrepresentation of an insurance policy” when the\n\nalleged misrepresentation occurs within the claims-settlement context. We hold that it does.5 The\n\nAct specifically addresses and prohibits a carrier from making misrepresentations, including\n\nmisrepresentations “to an employee” regarding the Act’s provisions and “the reason for not paying\n\nbenefits or terminating or reducing the payment of benefits.” TEX. LAB. CODE\n\n§ 415.002(a)(1), (13). The Act’s comprehensive system for resolving workers’ compensation\n\nclaims encompasses prohibitions against fraud and misrepresentations made within the claims-\n\nsettlement context, and grants the Division authority to regulate and sanction any such conduct.\n\nBecause all of the Johnsons’ misrepresentation-based claims complain of misrepresentations that\n\nCrawford allegedly made in connection with its investigation, handling, and settling of the\n\nJohnsons’ claims for workers’ compensation benefits,6 we hold that the Division had exclusive\n\njurisdiction to address those claims.\n\n\n         5\n           At least two courts of appeals have reached this same conclusion. See Hopper, 2013 WL 5853747, at *1, 4\n(holding that carrier was entitled to summary judgment on claim regarding “false statements” that claimants “were\nnot entitled to coverage” because the claim was “limited to complaints about delays, claim handling, and disputes\nregarding entitlement to benefits”); Bean, 2012 WL 5450826, at *1 (holding that misrepresentation claims were within\nthe Division’s exclusive jurisdiction because those claims “concern[] the claims handling process,” and worker “did\nnot claim that the terms of the insurance policy covering his employer had been misrepresented to his employer”). As\nthe Hopper court explained, we stated in Ruttiger “that section 541.061 applies to misrepresentations of a policy’s\nterms, not misrepresentations about whether a specific claim is factually within a policy’s terms.” Hopper, 2013 WL\n5853747, at *3. The alleged misrepresentations in that case “concerned statements about whether [the worker’s] death\nresulted from a compensable injury and whether the Hoppers were his true beneficiaries,” and “[a]lthough Ruttiger\ndid not specifically involve common-law claims of fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation or unconscionability,\nthese claims fail in the present case because there is no evidence here of any fraudulent, negligent, or unconscionable\nconduct that does not implicate the claim-settlement process.” Id. at *3–*4.\n         6\n           The Johnsons allege, for example, that Crawford “made blatantly false statements to avoid coverage and to\navoid paying both income and medical benefits”; made “clearly untrue statements of material facts, including\nwithholding proper home healthcare and paying the injured worker and his spouse directly to arrange and provide\nnecessary care”; and “failed to state and to disclose known material facts that the lifetime income benefits were\npayable.”\n\n                                                         10\n\f         We now turn to the Johnsons’ claims for malicious prosecution and intentional infliction\n\nof emotional distress, which are both based on allegations that Crawford falsely reported to a\n\ndistrict attorney that the Johnsons committed insurance fraud by requesting mileage\n\nreimbursements for travel that had not occurred. We hold that the Division has exclusive\n\njurisdiction over these claims because they also arise out of Crawford’s investigation, handling,\n\nand settling of the Johnsons’ claims for workers’ compensation benefits. The mileage\n\nreimbursements at issue were part of the Johnsons’ medical benefits under the Act, and carriers\n\nare required to report suspected fraud to the Department or to an authorized governmental entity\n\nas part of their claims-handling responsibilities. TEX. INS. CODE § 701.051(a). If a carrier\n\nknowingly and intentionally makes a false or misleading statement with the intent to deny the\n\npayment of a benefit, as the Johnsons allege Crawford did in this case, the Act provides the\n\nclaimant with remedies, including criminal penalties. TEX. LAB. CODE §§ 415.008, 418.001.\n\nBecause the Johnsons’ causes of action for malicious prosecution and intentional infliction of\n\nemotional distress arise out of Crawford’s investigation, handling, and settling of a workers’\n\ncompensation claim, we hold that the Division had exclusive jurisdiction over those complaints.7\n\n         Finally, we turn to the Johnsons’ argument that Natalie Johnson is not seeking relief as an\n\nASARCO employee and thus her claims are independent of the Act and therefore not barred by it.\n\n\n\n\n         7\n           Because the Act’s grant of exclusive jurisdiction bars the courts from exercising jurisdiction over the claims,\nwe reject the Johnsons’ complaints that Crawford waived its argument that the Act bars the claims for malicious\nprosecution and is judicially estopped from raising them on mandamus. The Johnsons contend that Crawford’s counsel\n“judicially admitted” in the trial court that the malicious prosecution claim “is outside of comp,” and “[c]omp has\nnothing to do with malicious prosecution and we’re not arguing that it does.” We need not decide whether these\nstatements could constitute a waiver, judicial admission, or the basis for judicial estoppel, because even if they could,\nsuch doctrines cannot create subject-matter jurisdiction where it does not otherwise exist. Wilmer-Hutchins Indep.\nSch. Dist. v. Sullivan, 51 S.W.3d 293, 294 (Tex. 2001) (“As a general rule, a court cannot acquire subject-matter\njurisdiction by estoppel.”); Dubai Petroleum Co. v. Kazi, 12 S.W.3d 71, 76 (Tex. 2000) (“[S]ubject-matter jurisdiction\nis a power that ‘exists by operation of law only, and cannot be conferred upon any court by consent or waiver’ . . . .”)\n(quoting Federal Underwriters Exch. v. Pugh, 141 Tex. 539, 174 S.W.2d 598, 600 (1943)).\n\n                                                           11\n\fSpecifically, the Johnsons argue that Natalie “has causes of action for malicious prosecution,\n\nintentional infliction of emotional distress, quantum meruit, and breach of contract all of\n\nwhich . . . do not arise under the Act because she was not an employee of ASARCO.” But Natalie’s\n\nclaims, like Glenn’s, arise out of Crawford’s conduct in investigating, handling, and settling\n\nGlenn’s claim for workers’ compensation benefits. Specifically, she complains that Crawford\n\nbreached promises to pay her to provide services to Glenn and that Crawford maliciously caused\n\nher to be prosecuted for insurance fraud. We have held that an employee’s spouse cannot bring a\n\nseparate action alleging claims under the Act. See Rodriguez v. Naylor Indus., Inc., 763 S.W.2d\n\n411, 412 (Tex. 1989) (recognizing that any claims compensable under the Act could not be brought\n\nby non-employee spouse except for intentional tort claims). The only noted exception to this rule\n\nis if a spouse is pursuing a loss of consortium claim where there is evidence that the employer’s\n\nintentional tort caused the employee’s injury. Id. (“Therefore, Mrs. Rodriguez’ suit for loss of\n\nconsortium is barred by the Workers’ Compensation Act unless she can establish that the injury\n\ncaused her husband was intentional.”); see also Reed Tool Co. v. Copelin, 610 S.W.2d 736, 738–\n\n39 (Tex. 1980). We conclude that, even if Natalie Johnson has standing to assert her claims, they\n\nfall within the Division’s exclusive jurisdiction.\n\n       Having concluded that the Division has exclusive jurisdiction over the Johnsons’ claims\n\nagainst Crawford, we further conclude that Crawford is entitled to mandamus relief. In re Sw. Bell\n\nTel. Co., L.P., 235 S.W.3d 619, 624 (Tex. 2007) (granting mandamus to require dismissal of claims\n\nover which Public Utility Commission had exclusive jurisdiction because “[a]llowing the trial\n\ncourt to proceed if the PUC has exclusive jurisdiction would disrupt the orderly processes of\n\ngovernment”); In re Entergy Corp., 142 S.W.3d 316, 321 (Tex. 2004) (same). Because the\n\nJohnsons’ claims arise out of Crawford’s investigation, handling, and settling of workers’\n\n\n\n                                                 12\n\fcompensation claims, they fall within the Division’s exclusive jurisdiction and the Act provides\n\nthe sole process and remedies for those claims. Because the Johnsons failed to exhaust their\n\nadministrative remedies under the Act prior to filing this action, the trial court lacked jurisdiction\n\nand should have dismissed it. See City of Houston v. Rhule, 417 S.W.3d 440, 442 (Tex. 2013)\n\n(“Absent exhaustion of administrative remedies, a trial court must dismiss the case.”).\n\n        Pursuant to Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 52.8(c), without hearing oral arguments,\n\nwe conditionally grant mandamus relief and direct the 108th District Court to withdraw its order\n\ndenying Crawford’s plea to the jurisdiction and dismiss the Johnsons’ claims for lack of subject-\n\nmatter jurisdiction. Our writ will issue only if the court fails to act in accordance with this opinion.\n\n\n\nOpinion Delivered: February 27, 2015\n\n\n\n\n                                                  13\n\f<<Prev Rule            Texas Administrative Code                                       Next Rule>>\n\nTITLE 28                  INSURANCE\nPART 2                    TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE, DIVISION OF\n                          WORKERS' COMPENSATION\nCHAPTER 43                INSURANCE COVERAGE\nRULE §43.10               Termination of Coverage\n\n\n\n(a) Definitions.

Statement of the Case................................................................................... 2\nIII. Issue Presented .......................................................................................... 4\n    Did the trial court abuse its discretion when it refused to dismiss claims\n    over which it has no subject matter jurisdiction because the Division\n    of Worker’s Compensation has exclusive jurisdiction and Plaintiff has\n    not exhausted his administrative remedies? ............................................... 4\nIV. Statement of Facts ...................................................................................... 4\nV. Summary of Argument ................................................................................. 6\nVI. Standard of Review..................................................................................... 7\nVII. Argument ................................................................................................... 8\n   A. The trial court does not have subject matter jurisdiction and any judgment\n       it renders is void as a matter of law. ........................................................ 8\n   B. The Act demonstrates the legislature’s intent that the Act provide the\n      exclusive remedy for on-the-job injuries. ............................................... 10\n   C. Through its broad rule making and enforcement provisions, the Act\n       empowers the DWC to resolve disputes, enforce compliance, and\n       punish offenders. ................................................................................... 13\n   D.     Real Party’s failure to exhaust his administrative remedies under the\n        Act precludes the trial court’s exercise of jurisdiction over this matter. . 16\n         1. Real Party consciously chose to circumvent the Act in pursuit of\n         common-law remedies for his work-place injury. ................................. 16\n         2. The laws embodied in the Act and the rules promulgated by the DWC\n         mandate that iWORKS policy was in effect on the date that Real Party\n         was injured at work. ............................................................................. 19\n   E. The DWC has exclusive jurisdiction to determine coverage. .................. 28\n\n\n                                                        iii\n\f   F. The newly released Crawford opinion confirms the Court’s prior findings\n       that it is the intent of the legislature that the DWC have exclusive\n       jurisdiction out of work-place injury claims and that even artful pleadings\n       will not let Plaintiff’s recast their claims outside of the purview of the Act.\n       ............................................................................................................... 34\nVIII.

Through artful pleading Plaintiff has\n\nsought to recast this case as a non-subscriber case, a breach of contract case, a\n\nfraud case, a third-party beneficiary case, and so on. However, the Division of\n\nWorker’s Compensation has exclusive jurisdiction over Plaintiff’s claims, no matter\n\nhow artfully plead, and the trial court lacks subject matter jurisdiction until Plaintiff\n\nhas exhausted the administrative remedies provided by the Worker’s\n\nCompensation Act2 (the “Act”).\n\n\n2TEXAS LABOR CODE, Title V, Subtitle A (“Texas Workers’ Compensation Act), §§ 401.001\n– 451.003. Unless otherwise indicated, all code references in this petition refer to the\nTexas Labor Code.\n\n                                           1\n\f       This issue is of vital importance because the carefully balanced dispute\n\nresolution and enforcement procedures that the legislature built into the system\n\nare lost if a claimant can circumvent the Act by refusing to pursue his administrative\n\nremedies and simply recasting his claims as common-law or extra-statutory\n\ncauses of action. This Court should exercise its mandamus jurisdiction in this case\n\nand order the trial court to dismiss Plaintiff’s causes of action.\n\n\n                              I. Statement of the Case\n       Nature of the case. Relator, iWORKS Personnel, Inc. (“iWORKS”) is a\n\ntemporary staffing company who contracted with Defendant, Waste Management,\n\nInc. (“WM”) to provide temporary labor at its waste processing facility. Real Party,\n\nMose Guillory (“Real Party”),3 was a temporary worker assigned by iWORKS to\n\nwork at WM’s facility. Real Party was injured on August 5, 2012 while working at\n\nthe WM facility. He subsequently sued iWORKS,4 WM, Inc. (“WM”), and Seaton,\n\nLLC d/b/a Staff Management (“SM”),5 a third party administrator of WM’s\n\ntemporary labor program.\n\n\n\n3 Real Party’s wife, Mary Guillory, is a Plaintiff in this case. Plaintiffs’ Fifth Amended\nPetition makes no express claims on her behalf, but it does seek damages for loss of\nconsortium and loss of household services. Her claims are all derivative of Real Party’s\nclaims. As used in this petition, “Real Party” refers to both Mose Guillory and Mary\nGuillory.\n4 Plaintiff also sued iWORKS’ CEO, Luis Trevino, and President, Haydee Gutierrez, in\ntheir individual capacities. They joined iWORKS in this petition. As used in this petition,\n“iWORKS” refers to both the company and the two individuals.\n5The trial court granted SM’s Rule 91a motion to dismiss. Plaintiff’s appeal is currently\npending before this Court (No. 01-14-00379-CV).\n\n                                            2\n\f          Trial court. The Honorable Michael Landrum, 113th Judicial District Court of\n\nHarris County, Texas (“Respondent” or “trial court” herein).\n\n          Proceedings in the trial court. Relators challenged the trial court’s subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction based upon the exclusive jurisdiction of the Texas Department\n\nof Insurance, Division of Worker’s Compensation (“DWC”) and Real Party’s failure\n\nto exhaust the administrative remedies available under the Act before the DWC.\n\nRelators also challenged Real Party’s causes of action based on traditional and no\n\nevidence motions for summary judgment, aside from the jurisdictional challenges.\n\nThe trial court granted Relators’ challenges to numerous of Real Party’s causes of\n\naction, but denied Relators’ jurisdictional challenges on the remaining claims and\n\ncauses of action by Order dated February 20, 2015.6 It is from the trial court’s\n\nassertion of jurisdiction over those remaining claims that Relators seek mandamus\n\nrelief.\n\n                                 II. Statement of Jurisdiction\n\n            This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to Tex. Gov’t Code § 22.002(a).\n\n    Mandamus relief is appropriate to correct a trial court’s assertion of subject\n\n    matter jurisdiction over a case that lies squarely within the exclusive jurisdiction\n\n    of an administrative agency, here the DWC over the Texas workers’\n\n\n\n\n6   Tab 1\n\n                                            3\n\f    compensation system.7 This erroneous assertion of jurisdiction is an abuse of\n\n    discretion. Permitting the trial court to improperly assert jurisdiction results not\n\n    only in hardship to Relators, but also interferes with the “legislatively mandated\n\n    function and purpose” of the DWC, undermines the Legislature’s intent to create\n\n    a comprehensive scheme to govern workers’ compensation claims in Texas,8\n\n    and effectively abrogates the Act, leaving Relators with no adequate remedy by\n\n    appeal.9 This court can correct the trial court’s assertion of subject matter\n\n    jurisdiction here through a writ of mandamus because the underlying claims lie\n\n    within the exclusive jurisdiction of the DWC.\n\n\n                                  III. Issue Presented\nDid the trial court abuse its discretion when it refused to dismiss claims over\nwhich it has no subject matter jurisdiction because the Division of Worker’s\nCompensation has exclusive jurisdiction and Plaintiff has not exhausted his\nadministrative remedies?\n\n                                IV. Statement of Facts\n         Real Party was severely injured on August 5, 2012 while in the course of\n\nhis employment at Waste Management’s waste reclamation facility in Houston,\n\nTexas.

The baler activated and\n\nsevered his right leg below the knee and half of his left foot.\n\n        This lawsuit arises from Real Party’s attempt to recover damages for the\n\ninjuries he sustained while employed at the WM facility. Throughout this suit Real\n\nParty has asserted various causes of action, some sounding in tort (negligence,\n\ngross negligence, negligence per se, negligent hiring, training, and supervision,\n\ncommon law fraud, fraud by non-disclosure, and negligent undertaking); some\n\nsounding in contract (breach of contract as third-party beneficiary to the iWORKS\n\n/ WM service agreement and breach of contract as a third-party beneficiary of the\n\nWM / SMX agreement).            Real Party has also alleged numerous theories of\n\nvicarious liability (respondeat superior, joint enterprise, and partnership liability).\n\nReal Party’s claims against iWORKS have been narrowed down to negligence,\n\nnegligence per se, gross negligence, negligent hiring, training, and supervision,\n\nbreach of contract, respondeat superior, partnership liability, and joint enterprise\n\nliability.11   Regardless of how artfully or inventively labeled or recast, all of\n\n\n10 A Harris Baler is essentially a gigantic trash compactor which compacts sorted refuse\ninto dense bales. The material is fed into the baler via a conveyor belt which dumps the\nmaterial into the compacting chamber.\n11 The trial court denied iWORKS’ motion for summary judgment on all causes except for\nbreach of contract, which it granted. However, the trial court declined to dismiss the same\ncontract claims against Trevino and Gutierrez, even though they were neither parties nor\nsignatories to the contract in their individual capacities. The trial court also dismissed\nPlaintiff’s negligence claims against Trevino and Gutierrez, but left the gross negligence\nclaims against them intact. Thus, while as a matter of law Trevino and Gutierrez are not\nnegligent, they are still subject to liability on Plaintiff’s gross negligence claims.

Summary of Argument\n\n\n      Real Party’s claims fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the DWC, and\n\ntherefore, the trial court is without subject matter jurisdiction to consider these\n\nclaims until they have exhausted all administrative remedies provided for under\n\nthe Act. Allowing a participant in the worker’s compensation system to pursue such\n\nclaims in a civil action is incompatible with the comprehensive administrative\n\nprocesses and other remedies in the Act.\n\n      Despite Real Party’s attempts to avoid the Act by creatively pleading their\n\ncomplaints, the essence of their suit falls squarely under the purview of the DWC.\n\nTo hold otherwise would allow claimants to easily avoid the exclusive jurisdiction\n\nof the Act by simply relabeling their claims as other common law or statutory\n\ntheories, even though such claims are equally incompatible with the administrative\n\nprocesses and other remedies in the Act. This is precisely why the Texas Supreme\n\nCourt has repeatedly emphasized the legislative intent that there be no alternative\n\nremedies available outside the Act.\n\n\n\n\nthey are also subject to same breach of contract liability that the trial court found their\ncompany, a party to the contract, not liable for as a matter of law. The trial court denied\nRelators’ motion to reconsider these paradoxical results.\n\n                                            6\n\f                               VI.

Prior to that time and up to this Court’s\n\n     opinion in Ruttiger, the shortcomings of the system necessitated this Court’s\n\n     acknowledgement of a common law cause of action for extra-contractual\n\n     damages. In Ruttiger, this Court set out its analysis of the respective roles of\n\n     the Legislature and this Court in relation to the Act and the worker’s\n\n     compensation system as a whole. Improvements to the pre-1989 system were\n\n     cited to include the following:\n\n         1)    reduction of the disparity of bargaining power between\n               employees and insurance carriers;\n         2)    removal of insurers’ exclusive control over the processing of\n               claims;\n         3)    curtailment of insurers’ ability to refuse or unreasonably deny\n               payment of valid claims in an arbitrary manner;\n         4)    provision of information to employees and free assistance before\n               the DWC process through the ombudsman program; and\n         5)    provision of multiple remedies and penalties to enforce the\n               parties’ rights and to regulate the parties’ conduct, up to and\n               including revocation of a carrier’s right to do business in Texas “if\n               on multiple occasions it fails to pay benefits promptly and as they\n               accrue.”40 The Legislature provided injured workers with tools\n               to which they did not previously have access. Carefully\n               considering these improvements to the system, this Court held\n               that common law causes of action outside the framework of the\n               Act are no longer necessary when the Act covers the\n               complained-of conduct or the remedy sought.41\n\n40   Ruttiger, 381 S.W.3d at 449-450.\n41   Id. at 444, 445, 451.\n\n                                             12\n\fRecognizing the broad scope and encompassing remedies brought about by the\n\n1998 revisions to the Act, the Texas Supreme Court held that “the Court should\n\nnot alter the Act’s comprehensive scheme.” 42\n\nC.

The Ruttiger court held that the 1989\namendments to the Act manifested the Legislatures’ intent to vitiate the need for such a\ncause of action and expressly overruled Arranda. Id., 381 S.W.3d at 438-56.\n\n                                            14\n\fand increasing sanctions for violations of the Act.”52 The Ruttiger court stated that\n\n“[t]he purpose of the Act is to provide employees with certainty that their medical\n\nbills and lost wages will be covered if they are injured.” Id. at 441.\n\n         To accomplish these purposes, the Act provides detailed notice and\n         administrative dispute resolution proceedings that include specific\n         deadlines and incorporate a “conveyor-belt” approach. That is, once\n         the administrative dispute resolution process is initiated, a dispute\n         continues through the process until the dispute is resolved either by\n         the parties or by a binding decision through the resolution procedures.\n\nId. at 441.\n\n         The Ruttiger opinion provides a lengthy description of “the detailed notice\n\nand administrative dispute resolution proceedings” encompassed by the Act. 53 In\n\ndescribing the pervasiveness of the Act the Ruttiger court noted that the Act affords\n\nthe DWC significant power to enforce the Act against the various parties in the\n\nworker’s compensation system. Id. The Ruttiger court concluded:\n\n         It is apparent that the Act prescribes detailed, WCD-supervised, time-\n         compressed processes for carriers to handle claims and for dispute\n         resolution. It has multiple, sometimes redundant but sometimes\n         additive, penalty and sanction provisions for enforcing compliance\n         with its requirements.54\n\nThe court recognized that allowing an employee to circumvent the act by asserting\n\ncommon law causes of action would be “inconsistent with the Act’s goals and\n\nlegislative intent exhibited in the act” and could also “result in rewarding an\n\n\n\n52   Id., 381 S.W.2d at 433.\n53   Id. at 441-43.\n54   Id. at 443.\n\n                                           15\n\femployee who is dilatory in utilizing the Act’s detailed dispute resolution\n\nprocedures, regardless of whether the delay was intentional or inadvertent,\n\nbecause whether and when the dispute resolution begins is by and large\n\ndependent on the employee.” Id.\n\nD.       Real Party’s failure to exhaust his administrative remedies under the\n         Act precludes the trial court’s exercise of jurisdiction over this matter.\n\n         When an agency has exclusive jurisdiction a party must exhaust its\n\nadministrative remedies before seeking recourse through judicial review. 55 “If an\n\nagency has exclusive jurisdiction... a party must first exhaust all administrative\n\nremedies before a trial court has subject matter jurisdiction.”56 “Absent exhaustion\n\nof administrative remedies, a trial court must dismiss the case.”57\n\n\n         1. Real Party consciously chose to circumvent the Act in pursuit of\n            common-law remedies for his work-place injury.\n\n         There is no question that Real Party not exhausted his administrative\n\nremedies through the DWC.

Real Party states:\n         In accordance with the Texas Labor Code Ch. 409, Plaintiffs did previously\n         file their DWC 41 form on the 1-year anniversary of the injury in question.\n         However, Plaintiffs did so solely to preserve their right to seek benefits in\n         the event that this Court or the Court of Appeals later determined that\n         iWorks Defendants and/or WM Defendants were workers’ compensation\n         subscribers. Plaintiffs are not seeking workers’ compensation benefits from\n                                               16\n\fjustified in foregoing the Texas Workers’ Compensation System because both\n\niWORKS and WM are nonsubscribers.59 However, an examination of the Plaintiff’s\n\nallegations and the evidence submitted in connection with Relator’s Plea to the\n\nJurisdiction demonstrate that Relator was a subscriber the Act.\n\n           Real Party was injured on August 5, 2012.60            On August 30, 2012 he\n\nexecuted a DWC-041 form61 requesting compensation for a work-related injury.62\n\nOn that form he stated that he was represented by Bradford J. Gilde (“Gilde”).63\n\nThus, fifteen days after his work-related injury (over 2 ½ years ago) Real Party was\n\nat a minimum aware of the potential availability of benefits under the Act. It is also\n\nfair to assume that his attorney knew (or had the ability to find out) how to obtain\n\nthose benefits.\n\n           Nearly a year later on August 12, 2013, Gilde sent a letter to the DWC.64 It\n\nwas styled as a “Notice, Stay, and Preservation Letter.” Although litigation was\n\nongoing and both iWORKS and Waste Management were represented by\n\n\n\n\n           any provider, and are surely not attempting to get blood from the turnip that\n           is iWorks Defendants’ cancelled policy.\n59   Tab 2, Petition, p. 6, ¶¶ 19-20.\n60   Id. at p. 13, ¶ 36.\n61“Employee’s Claim for Compensation for a Work Related Injury or Occupational\nDisease.”\n62   Tab 10.\n63   Id.\n64   Tab 14.\n\n                                                17\n\fcounsel,65 neither Defendant was copied on this correspondence. Gilde attached\n\ntwo separate DWC-041 forms to the letter. One names iWORKS as Real Party’s\n\nemployer and the other names WM as his employer. Thus, as of the date of his\n\nletter to the DWC, Real Party’s counsel had actual knowledge of two separate\n\nworker’s compensation policies which would potentially provide benefits to his\n\nclient. He consciously chose to forego pursuing his client’s benefits under either\n\none of the policies in lieu of proceeding with his claims in the trial court. 66\n\n           Gilde’s letter to the DWC states that it:\n\n           “is submitted: (1) as a notice of claim for compensation...as a\n           preservation of right to file and seek a claim for compensation...and\n           pursuant to Tex. Labor Code §409.004.”67\n\n           The letter further states that “this letter...is not an election or denial of a claim\n\nfor coverage.”68 Real Party cannot hedge his bets with the DWC while seeking a\n\njudicial remedy in the trial court without first exhausting his administrative\n\n\n\n65   At that time attorney Aric Garza was counsel for iWORKS.\n66On information and belief, as of the filing of this petition Real Party has still not sought\nbenefits under WM’s worker’s compensation policy even though the trial court dismissed\nhis claims against WM pursuant to the “comp bar” defense.\nPort Elevator-Brownsville, L.L.C. v.

Simply put, the state of Texas wants all workers\ncovered. Thus, a temporary staffing employee typically has two different worker’s\ncompensation policies which can cover him for on-the-job injuries. Which policy actually\ncovers the worker is usually a matter of contract between the staffing company and its\nclient.\n67   Tab 14 (emphasis in original).\n68   Id.\n\n                                                18\n\fremedies. His failure to do so in this matter, despite knowing the administrative\n\nrequirements set forth in the Act, deprives the trial court of subject-matter\n\njurisdiction over his claims.\n\n         Gilde’s letter to the DWC purports to reserve Real Party’s right to seek relief\n\nfrom the DWC in the event he was unsuccessful in in the trial court. This approach\n\nturns the purpose of the entire worker’s compensation system on its head. This\n\nletter demonstrates that Real Party was well aware of the requirements under the\n\nTexas Labor Code yet consciously chose to attempt to circumvent that process in\n\nhopes of a common law verdict. This is not the public policy of Texas. As the\n\nRuttiger court observed, “the extra-statutory cause of action provides incentive for\n\nan injured worker to delay using the avenues for immediate relief that the\n\nLegislature painstakingly built into the law” and “distorts the balances struck in the\n\nAct and frustrates the Legislature’s intent to have disputes resolved quickly and\n\nobjectively.”69\n\n\n         2. The laws embodied in the Act and the rules promulgated by the\n            DWC mandate that iWORKS policy was in effect on the date that\n            Real Party was injured at work.\n\n         iWORKS is a subscriber under the Act. iWORKS purchased a worker’s\n\ncompensation policy from Texas Mutual with the effective dates of 09/04/2011\n\nthrough 09/04/2012.70 That iWORKS actually purchased this policy is not disputed\n\n\n\n69   Ruttiger, 381 S.W.3d at 451.\n70   Tab 6.\n\n                                            19\n\fby Real Party. Rather, Real Party argues that the policy was terminated prior to\n\nhis August 5, 2012 injury.71 To support this claim he cites to a Notice of Dismissal\n\npurportedly issued by Texas Mutual72 and discovery responses from Texas Mutual\n\nand Lette Insurance Company, iWORKS’ insurance agent who procured the\n\npolicy.73\n\n           But it has long been ‘the settled policy of this State to construe liberally\n           the provisions of the [Act] in order to effectuate the purposes for which\n           it was enacted.’ Coverage is a fundamental purpose of the Act.74\n\nReal Party’s contentions and the evidence offered to support them do not comport\n\nwith the statutory provisions provided for in the Act and only serve to thwart the\n\nfundamental purpose of the Act, coverage.\n\n\n71   Tab 15, p. 5-9, ¶¶ 28-39.\n72   Id.\n73   Id.\n74Entergy Gulf States, Inc. v.

There is no\n\n\nbut see Id., p. 6, ¶¶ 19-21 where Real Party makes the global allegation (without factual\nsupport) that both iWORKS and WM are non-subscribers.\n81   Tab 6.\n82 Tab 11; Trevino testified: “Since it has been in business iWORKS has continuously\nsubscribed to Worker’s Compensation insurance and has covered all of its temporary\nemployees that it sends out on assignment. This is the standard course of business for\na temporary staffing company.”\n83   Tab 3.\n84   Tab 15, pp. 5-8, ¶¶ 25-32.\n85   Real Party attached 560 pages of documents to his response (Tabs 16-18).\n86Tabs 16 and 17. For the sake of simplicity, Relator has separated the evidence\nspecifically cited in Real Party’s response and has combined it under Tab 19 in the\nAppendix.\n87   Tab 19 The same document was produced by both Texas Mutual and Lette Ins.\n\n                                             22\n\fevidence that this Notice was ever sent to iWORKS. Luis Trevino testified that\n\niWORKS never received notice of termination.88 He stated:\n\n         The first knowledge that iWORKS had of an alleged gap in its worker’s\n         compensation coverage was when Mose Guillory’s attorney made\n         that allegation during my deposition in this case. Although Guillory’s\n         attorney presented what appeared to be a notice of termination, I had\n         no knowledge of such notice. During that alleged period of time we\n         had never missed a premium payment, we had received no\n         communication from our broker regarding any termination, we had\n         received no denial of any claims, and we never had problems\n         obtaining Certificates of Insurance.\n\nThe testimony is uncontroverted. The notice relied upon by Real Party purports to\n\nhave been sent by certified mail which begs the question – where is the green card\n\nor the unclaimed envelope?\n\n         The only other evidence offered by Real Party is the self-serving discovery\n\nresponses from Texas Mutual. Texas Mutual’s canned response to almost all of\n\nthe questions posed by Real Party (subject to objection) was:\n\n         Texas Mutual insurance policy no. STA_0001244473 301 10904\n         (“The Policy”) was issued to Preferred Staffing Company, LLC d/b/a\n         iWorks Personnel (“Preferred Staffing”) for the coverage period of\n         09/04/2011 to 09/04/2012. The Policy was cancelled, effective\n         07/16/2012 (See Notice of Cancellation, document Bates No.\n         TXM00318). Texas Mutual Insurance’s Company’s actions regarding\n         issuance of The Policy and subsequent cancellation were conducted\n         pursuant to and in accordance with the Rules set by the Texas\n         Department of Insurance Division of Workers’ Compensation and the\n         Texas Worker’s Compensation Act.89\n\n\n\n\n88   Tab 11.\n89   Tab 19.\n\n                                          23\n\fReal Party also relies upon admissions submitted by Texas Mutual “admitting” that\n\n1) the policy “was cancelled prior to August 5, 2012”, and 2) that “iWORKS was a\n\n‘nonsubscriber,’ under Texas law to your [Texas Mutual’s] knowledge and\n\ndefinition of “nonsubscriber.”90 Notwithstanding the fact that these admissions are\n\nconclusory and lack any evidentiary foundation, these admissions have no\n\nevidentiary value as they cannot be used against iWORKS.91\n\n         What Texas Mutual’s evidence does show is that iWORKS did indeed have\n\na policy covering the date of Real Party’s injury. What it does not show is any\n\nevidence that the policy was properly terminated pursuant to the Labor Code and\n\nthe rules established by the DWC. Again, where is the green card? Where is the\n\nunclaimed envelope? It is not in any of the documents submitted by Real Party.\n\nTexas Mutual’s testimony also supports the exclusive jurisdiction of the DWC when\n\nit claims that it has adhered to all of the requirements of the Act and the DWC rules\n\nappurtenant thereto. It is solely within the DWC’s province to determine Texas\n\nMutual’s actual compliance and solely within the DWC’s administrative power to\n\npunish and sanction Texas Mutual for violations of the Act and/or the DWC rules.\n\n         Real Party also referenced an August 24, 2012 letter written by Texas\n\nMutual to show cancellation of the policy.92 Again there is no evidence to show\n\n\n\n90   Tab 19.\n91Tex.

What is interesting about this document is that\n\nit states\n\n           To prevent cancellation of your current coverage, please contact the\n           Premium Audit department promptly.97\n\n\n\n\n93   Tab 20.\n94   Tab 19.\n95   Tab 15, p. 9, ¶ 38.\n96Tab 21; Again, Real Party provides no evidence that this letter was actually sent to or\nreceived by iWORKS.\n97   Id.\n\n                                           25\n\fThis begs the question, if iWORKS’ coverage was terminated in July, 2012, how\n\ncould its current coverage in November, 2012 be subject to cancellation? This\n\ncourt, looking at this evidence de novo, should find that the evidence submitted by\n\nReal Party to show the trial court’s jurisdiction in this matter is of no probative effect\n\nat all. However, even had the trial court (or this Court) given any weight to the\n\nevidence submitted by Real Party, the laws of the Act and the Rules of the DWC\n\nstill confer exclusive jurisdiction to the DWC.\n\n           The Act and the rules enacted by the DWC have very specific requirements\n\ngoverning the termination of a workers’ compensation policy. The Act provides that\n\nan insurance company that terminates a policy “shall deliver notice of the\n\ncancellation... by certified mail or in person to the employer and the division” at\n\nleast thirty days prior to the effective date of the cancellation. 98 If the insurance\n\ncompany does not give notice as required, then the policy is extended until proper\n\nnotice is provided.99\n\n           Pursuant to the rule making authority given to it in the Act, the DWC has\n\npromulgated additional rules for the termination of a worker’s compensation policy\n\nwhich are codified in the TAC.100 Chapter 43 provides that “[r]ejection of the\n\nworkers’ compensation system [o]ccurs when a subscriber terminates coverage or\n\n\n\n\n98   §406.008.\n99   Id.\n100   See 28 TEX. ADMIN. CODE, Chapter 43.\n\n                                             26\n\ffails or refuses to purchase a policy of workers’ compensation insurance.”101 Thus,\n\nthere is no allegation that iWORKS “rejected” the workers’ compensation system.\n\n            Under the DWC’s rules a carrier must give the employer written notice of\n\ntermination at least thirty days before the effective date of termination. 102 Notice\n\nmust be by certified mail; there is no provision for personal delivery.103 The\n\neffective date of the termination under Chapter 43 is “the latest of the following\n\ndates: (A) on the 31st day after the carrier notifies the subscriber as provided in\n\nsubsection (c) . . . ; (B) the day the carrier files notice of termination with the board\n\n. . .; or (C) the actual termination date recited on the notice.”104\n\n            Chapter 110 provides substantially more protection for both the employer\n\nand the employee. It provides that:\n\n               f) Cancellation or non-renewal of a workers' compensation insurance\n               policy by an insurance company takes effect on the later of:\n\n                  (1) the end of the workers' compensation insurance policy period; or\n\n                  (2) the date the division and the employer receive the notification\n                      from the insurance company of coverage cancellation or non-\n                      renewal and the later of:\n\n                           (A)   the date 30 days after receipt of the notice required by\n                                 Labor Code, §406.008(a)(1);\n\n                           (B)   the date 10 days after receipt of the notice required by\n                                 Labor Code, §406.008(a)(2); or\n\n\n101   Id., § 43.10(a)(2).\n102   Id., § 43.10(c)(1-3)\n103   Id.\n104   Id., § 43.10(d)(1)\n\n                                               27\n\f                       (C)    the effective date of the cancellation if later than the date\n                              in paragraph (1) or (2) of this subsection.105\n\nThe rules promulgated by the DWC and codified in the TAC reflect the driving\n\nintent of the State of Texas that its workers be covered.\n\n         How do these laws and regulations apply in this case? Under Rule 110.1,\n\nregardless of when or how or if iWORKS was provided with notice of cancellation\n\nby Texas Mutual, the effective date of termination would be at the end of the policy\n\nperiod on September 4, 2012. Under Rule 43.10 the effective date of termination\n\nwould be on the 31st day after iWORKS received notice of cancellation from Texas\n\nMutual through certified mail.        Under Section 408.10, the termination date is\n\nextended until Texas Mutual provides notice of cancellation to iWORKS through\n\neither certified mail or personal delivery. Since iWORKS never received notice of\n\ncancellation through certified mail, under both Rule 43.10 and Section 408.10 the\n\npolicy terminated under its own terms on September 4, 2012. Real Party was\n\ninjured on August 5, 2012. Thus he falls under the coverage of iWORKS’ workers’\n\ncompensation policy.\n\n\n\n\n105   Id., § 110.1(f) (emphasis added).\n\n                                             28\n\fE.

In finding that the\n\nemployee did not suffer a compensable injury the panel had to address issues\n\nrelated to coverage (including whether or not the temporary staffing company’s\n\ncarrier properly terminated coverage), contractual duties between the parties,\n\nliability issues between three different worker’s compensation insurance providers,\n\nemployment status of the claimant, and other related issues.\n\n\n         The legal issues discussed above are all issues that are in play in this case.\n\nThese are issues that the DWC routinely addresses through its administration of\n\nthe Act.

If the issues being appealed involve “compensability” then\nthe standard of review is the “modified de novo” standard established by §410.301.

Morales was killed while repairing a roof on a motel.111 His wife sought death-\n\nbenefits under the act claiming he was injured while in the course and scope of his\n\nemployment with three different employers.112 Two of the employers were insured\n\nunder separate worker’s compensation policies, and the third was a\n\nnonsubscriber.113 The court explained that:\n\n            The existence of a compensable injury is the threshold requirement\n            for payment of benefits under the Act. See TEX. LAB.CODE §§\n            401.011(5), 406.031(a). And there are various elements that affect\n            whether an injury is compensable, including the worker's employment\n            status as an employee or independent contractor at the time of injury,\n            whether the worker was injured in the course and scope of\n            employment, who controlled the employee's work when the injury\n            occurred, and whether a particular employer has an insurance policy\n            in effect.

In adjudicating such claims, the Commission will\n            necessarily have to interpret compensation policies and determine the\n            period in which coverage existed.

The newly released Crawford opinion confirms the Court’s prior\n       findings that it is the intent of the legislature that the DWC have\n       exclusive jurisdiction out of work-place injury claims and that even\n       artful pleadings will not let Plaintiff’s recast their claims outside of the\n       purview of the Act.\n\n       One week after the trial court denied iWORKS’ plea, the Texas Supreme\n\nCourt issued its opinion in In Re Crawford & Co.118 The Supreme Court held that\n\nthe DWC has exclusive jurisdiction over the Plaintiff’s claims and that the Act\n\nprovided the exclusive remedies, even over plaintiff’s common law claims. The\n\nCrawford Court reversed the Amarillo Court of Appeals and dismissed the\n\nPlaintiff’s district court claims.\n\n       The Crawford opinion both clarifies and expands the Supreme Court’s\n\nholding in Ruttiger.119     In Crawford the Plaintiff sued his employer’s worker’s\n\ncompensation carrier alleging that it improperly denied him benefits from a 1998\n\ninjury. He argued that the carrier engaged in conduct that gave rise to liability\n\nindependent from and unrelated to worker’s compensation and, thus, did not fall\n\nunder the exclusive jurisdiction of the DWC. The Supreme Court rejected this\n\nargument. The critical distinction between this case and Crawford is that the\n\nCrawford plaintiff had already invoked the DWC’s jurisdiction, while the Real Party\n\nhas refused to invoke the DWC’s jurisdiction claiming that Relator is a non-\n\n\n118No. 14-0256 (Tex.

However, the seminal messages from\n\nthe Texas Supreme Court in Crawford are equally commanding in this case.\n\n         The first seminal message from Crawford is that it is the clearly established\n\nintent of the legislature “that the current Act with its definitions, detailed\n\nprocedures, and dispute resolution processes” be the exclusive remedy for work-\n\nplace injuries, and, moreover, that this “demonstrates legislative intent for there to\n\nbe no alternative remedies.”120 The Court observed that:\n\n         The Act designates the Department of Insurance as the administrative\n         agency responsible “[for overseeing] the workers’ compensation\n         system of this state” and establishes the Division of Workers’\n         Compensation within the Department to “administer and operate” that\n         system. TEX. LAB. CODE § 402.001. It is the Division’s duty to “(1)\n         regulate and administer the business of workers’ compensation in this\n         state; and (2) ensure that [the Act] and other laws regarding workers’\n         compensation are executed.” Id. § 402.00114. The Division must\n         monitor insurance carriers, employers, and others “for compliance\n         with commissioner rules, this subtitle, and other laws relating to\n         workers’ compensation.” Id. § 414.002(a). The Division or its\n         commissioner may impose an array of sanctions against those who\n         fail to comply, including a cease-and-desist order and administrative\n         penalties up to $25,000 per day per occurrence. Id. § 415.021(a). As\n         we explained in Ruttiger, the Act, as substantially revised in 1989,\n         “prescribes     detailed,    [Division]supervised,   time-compressed\n         processes for carriers to handle claims and for dispute resolution” and\n         “has multiple, sometimes redundant but sometimes additive, penalty\n         and sanction provisions for enforcing compliance with its\n         requirements.” 381 S.W.3d at 443121.\n\n\n\n\n120   Crawford at p. 9 (quotes and citations omitted).\n121   Crawford at p. 4.\n                                              35\n\fThus, the broad scope and powerful enforcement provisions provided to the DWC\n\nby the 1989 revisions to the Act evince the legislature’s unequivocal intent that the\n\nDWC be the forum for which work-place injuries are resolved.\n\n         The second seminal message from Crawford is that it is the substance of\n\nthe claims and not the label of the cause of action asserted which determines the\n\nexclusively jurisdiction of the DWC.\n\n         Whether the Act provides the exclusive process and remedies,\n         therefore, does not depend on the label of the cause of action\n         asserted. As we have often explained, claimants may not recast\n         claims to avoid statutory requirements or to qualify for statutory\n         protections. [citations omitted] Instead, in assessing whether a claim\n         falls within the Division’s exclusive jurisdiction, courts must look at the\n         substance of the claim.122\n\nThus, Real Party’s creative and questionable assertion of causes of action\n\nputatively beyond the scope of the Act are of no consequence. The substance of\n\nthis claim is that Real Party was injured at work and is seeking damages for those\n\ninjuries. The Crawford opinion and its predecessors hold that resolution of these\n\nclaims falls under the exclusive jurisdiction of the DWC. Therefore, the trial court\n\ncannot exercise its jurisdiction in this matter until Real Party has exhausted his\n\nadministrative remedies. If is fundamental error for it to do so.\n\n         The crux of Real Party’s adamant disavowal of the DWC’s exclusive\n\njurisdiction is twofold. First is its contention that iWORKS is a non-subscriber. By\n\nmaking this assertion Real Party not only seeks access to the potentially much\n\n\n\n122   Crawford at p. 8.\n\n                                             36\n\fgreater recovery provided by common law remedies, but he also seeks the tactical\n\nadvantage conferred by the Act which would strip away most if Relator’s common-\n\nlaw affirmative defenses, particularly contributory negligence.123 Second is the fact\n\nthat Real Party tested positive for marijuana immediately following his work-place\n\ninjury. The Act provides that an employee that tests positive for marijuana is\n\npresumed intoxicated and that the burden is on that employee to rebut that\n\npresumption.124 The Act further provides that an employee is not entitled to benefits\n\nunder the Act if the injury occurred while he was intoxicated. 125 Thus, Real Party\n\nhas an incredibly strong incentive to avoid the DWC at all costs, both on the upside\n\n(potentially greater remedies) and on the downside (denial of benefits due to\n\nintoxication). “[P]arties cannot avoid exhaustion of administrative remedies\n\nbecause they fear they might not prevail.” In Re Liberty Mut.

Conclusion\n         This Court should grant Relator’s request for mandamus relief and dismiss\n\nReal Party’s claims. The trial court does not have subject matter jurisdiction. The\n\nLegislature has made clear through the Act that the DWC has exclusive jurisdiction\n\nover Real Party’s claims and that Real Party must exhaust all of his administrative\n\n\n\n\n123   § 406.033 (a).\n124   § 401.013(c).\n125   § 406.032(1)(A).\n\n                                         37\n\fremedies as set forth in the Act. Real Party has intentionally tried to circumvent\n\nthe act by recasting his work-place injury claims under various common law tort\n\nand contract claims. He has done this in the hope of obtaining more generous\n\ncommon law remedies and out of fear that he will not prevail in the administrative\n\nproceedings due to his presumed intoxication. Creative pleadings notwithstanding,\n\nReal Party’s failure to exhaust his administrative remedies through the DWC\n\nprecludes the trial court from exercising subject matter jurisdiction. The trial court\n\nerred by doing so.\n\n      Real Party’s contention that Relator is a nonsubscriber also has no merit. It\n\nis not supported by the pleadings and the evidence offered to the trial court. Even\n\nif the trial court had taken Real Party’s unsupported claims as true, the Labor Code\n\nand the Administrative Act both mandate as a matter of law that Relator’s policy\n\nwas in effect at the time of Real Party’s on-the-job injury. The Texas Supreme\n\nCourt has made abundantly clear from Ruttiger through Crawford that it is the\n\npublic policy of the State of Texas that the Act be interpreted so as to provide\n\ncoverage. Furthermore, in this matter the question of whether or not Texas Mutual\n\nproperly terminated Relator’s policy goes to compensability and is something that\n\nthe DWC resolves on a regular basis. Thus, it has no impact on the DWC’s\n\nexclusive jurisdiction and, rather, further compels such jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n\n                                         38\n\f                                     IX.

In support thereof\n\nit would show this honorable Court the following:\n\n                                              I.\n                                        Introduction\n\n       This is a worker’s compensation case.         IWORKS has prefaced almost every\n\npleading it has filed with this assertion. This is because, to date, the great bulk of legal\n\nefforts expended in this case are the direct result of Plaintiffs’ numerous and continued\n\nattempts to circumvent the Texas Labor Code in the face of well settled law and clear\n\npublic policy dictating otherwise. For well over a year Plaintiff’s counsel has had two\n\nseparate worker’s compensation policies which would provide him with worker’s\n\ncompensation coverage. See Exhibit A (iWORKS’) and Exhibit B (Waste Management’s).\n\nNevertheless, Plaintiff has refused to file a claim on either policy even though he would\n\nbegin receiving benefits within fifteen days and despite the fact that this is what is required\n\nby the Texas Labor Code.\n\n       iWORKS has consistently asserted that 1) it is a subscriber to worker’s\n\ncompensation insurance, and 2) that Waste Management is responsible for the worker’s\n\ncompensation coverage for Guillory because a) it executed a hold harmless agreement\n\frelated to Guillory’s employment, and b) it is solely responsible for moving Guillory from\n\nthe duties he was assigned to perform by iWORKS (operation of a front-end loader) and\n\nplacing him in operation of a machine (the Harris Baler) without any notice to iWORKS,\n\nfor failing to provide Guillory with the training and supervision necessary to operate the\n\nHarris Baler safely, and for controlling the scope, manner and details of Guillory’s work in\n\na negligent fashion. For these reasons, iWORKS did not initiate a worker’s compensation\n\nclaim related to Guillory’s work-place injury. Moreover, to the best knowledge of iWORKS,\n\nWaste Management has not filed an Employer’s First Report of Injury or Illness (Form\n\nDWC-001) with its worker’s compensation carrier, Indemnity Insurance Company of North\n\nAmerica (“IICNA”).\n\n        In order to put this matter on the administrative path it should have been on from\n\nits inception, iWORKS has filed an Employers First Report of Injury or Illness (Claim #\n\n1420000952677) with its worker’s compensation carrier, Texas Mutual Insurance\n\nCompany (“TMIC”).1 See Exhibit C. The compensability of Guillory’s injury is now being\n\ndetermined by TMIC claims adjuster Patricia Westin. It is very likely that Texas Mutual\n\nwill seek some form of contribution from IICNA. In the event of an adverse compensability\n\nfinding iWORKS will instigate a Benefit Review Conference with the Texas Department\n\nof Insurance – Division of Worker’s Compensation (“DWC”)2, the first step in exhausting\n\nthe administrative remedies necessary to pursue judicial review.\n\n\n1 By filing a claim on its worker’s compensation insurance, iWORKS does NOT waive or otherwise retreat\nfrom its position that Guillory’s injury is the sole responsibility of Waste Management and/or Guillory and\nexpressly reserves its rights to raise these issues in the administrative proceedings (if any) and any judicial\nreview of any administrative determinations.\n\n2 In 2005, the Legislature abolished the Texas Workers’ Compensation Commission and transferred its\nfunctions to the Texas Department of Insurance-Division of Worker’s Compensation. See Act of May 29,\n2005, 70th Leg., R.A., ch. 265, § 8.001, 2005 Tex. Gen. Laws 469, 607-08.

Plaintiffs’ have not exhausted\n\ntheir administrative remedies. Thus, this Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction and\n\nshould dismiss Plaintiffs’ causes of action.\n\n                                          II.\n                Evidence in Support of iWORKS’ Plea to the Jurisdiction\n\n        Exhibit A –     iWORKS’ Workers’ Compensation Policy\n\n        Exhibit B –     Waste Management’s Workers’ Compensation Policy.\n\n        Exhibit C –     Employer’s First Report of Injury or Illness (DWC-001) filed by\n\n        Exhibit D –     Hold Harmless Agreement\n\n        Exhibit E –     Employee’s Claim for Compensation for a Work-Related Injury or\n                        Occupational Disease (DWC-041) executed Guillory\n\n        Exhibit F –     Affidavit of Luis Trevino\n\n                                                III.\n                                       Factual Background\n\n        IWORKS is a temporary staffing company based out of San Antonio, Texas. It\n\nprovides temporary employees to companies throughout Texas for assignments as short\n\nas one day or as long as six months. IWORKS’ duty is to recruit, screen, interview, and\n\nassign its employees to perform the type of work requested by its clients. The work is to\n\nbe performed at its client’s facilities and under its client’s direct supervision. IWORKS\n\nalso pays the employee’s wages, pays, withholds and transmits payroll taxes, provides\n\nunemployment insurance and worker’s compensation benefits, and handles any\n\nunemployment and worker’s compensation claims for employees we assign to its clients.\n\nIWORKS is not licensed as a staff leasing agency and has never offered staff leasing\n\n\n\nwill refer to any reference to the Division of Worker’s Compensation or any of its predecessor agencies as\n“DWC.”\n\n\n                                                    3\n\fservices. Nor has it ever provided any PEO services. Its sole business is recruiting and\n\nassigning temporary workers as required by its clients. IWORKS provides no site specific\n\ntraining to the temporary workers that it provides to its clients. IWORKS does not\n\nsupervise any of the work performed at its client’s sites. IWORKS has no control over its\n\nclient’s facilities or equipment.\n\n       One of IWORKS’ clients was Waste Management, Inc. (“Waste Management”).\n\nIn July 2012, Waste Management contacted IWORKS’ Houston branch requesting a\n\ntemporary employee who was qualified to operate a front-end loader at Waste\n\nManagement’s Gasmer facility. The provision of heavy equipment operators is not an\n\narea in which IWORKS does a lot of business. Therefore, as a condition of procuring\n\nsuch employees for Waste Management, IWORKS and Waste Management agreed that\n\nIWORKS would locate temporary employees who had experience operating front-end\n\nloaders, but that it would be Waste Management’s responsibility to ensure that\n\nemployees supplied by IWORKS were trained in the safe and proper operation of all\n\nheavy equipment to be operated in their assigned task. IWORKS and Waste\n\nManagement also agreed that Waste Management would be solely responsible for any\n\ndamages related to the operation of the heavy machinery at the Waste Management\n\nfacility by an IWORKS temporary employee, and that Waste Management would hold\n\nIWORKS harmless in the event there was a claim made against them related to the\n\noperation of heavy machinery by an IWORKS temporary employee. See Exhibit D.\n\n       Mose Guillory applied for temporary work with IWORKS and indicated that he had\n\nexperience operating a front-end loader. IWORKS instructed him to report to Waste\n\nManagement’s Gasmer facility to be evaluated. Waste Management reported to\n\n\n\n\n                                            4\n\fIWORKS that Guillory had sufficient skill and experience operating a front-end loader\n\nand Guillory began working at the Waste Management Gasmer facility. From that point\n\nforward IWORKS sole responsibility was to pay Guillory based upon the time sheets\n\nsubmitted by Guillory’s Waste Management supervisors.\n\n           IWORKS did not control any aspect whatsoever of Guillory’s work at the Waste\n\nManagement facility; Waste Management had sole control over the manner and details\n\nof Guillory’s work. IWORKS did not control or even participate in evaluating whether or\n\nnot Guillory possessed sufficient skill to operate a front-end loader; Waste Management\n\nhad sole control in determining whether or not Guillory possessed sufficient skill.\n\nIWORKS did not control any site-specific training for Guillory; Waste Management had\n\nsole control over any site-specific training that Guillory may have needed to perform his\n\nduties at Waste Management’s Gasmer facility.\n\n      The following undisputed facts are alleged in Plaintiff’s Fifth Amended Original\n\nPetition:\n\n\n     Waste Management hired IWORKS to locate temporary employees to work at Waste\n      Management’s Gasmer facility. Petition3, p. 11, ¶26; Petition, Exhibit A\n\n     As a condition of procuring such employees IWORKS and Waste Management\n      executed an agreement which specified that Waste Management was solely\n      responsible for ensuring that the candidates were sufficiently trained in the operation\n      of the heavy machinery. Id., p. 11, ¶26; Petition, Exhibit B\n\n     On July 9, 2012 Guillory applied for a job at IWORKS. Id., p. 11, ¶ 27.\n\n     Guillory was assigned to operate a front-end loader at the Waste Management facility\n      located at 4939 Gasmer Dr., Houston, Texas. Id., p. 11, ¶ 29.\n\n     iWORKS does not provide site specific training as that is the duty of the client\n      company. Id., p. 15, ¶ 41.\n3   Unless otherwise indicated, “Petition” refers to Plaintiff’s Fifth Amended Petition.\n\n\n                                                         5\n\f    When Guillory reported to the Gasmer facility on July 9th he was required to\n     demonstrate his proficiency in driving a front-end loader to a Waste Management\n     employee. Id.\n\n    Waste Management was responsible for determining whether or not Guillory had\n     sufficient experience, training, and skill to operate a front-end loader at Waste\n     Management’s Gasmer facility. Id., p. 11, ¶ 29, p. 14, ¶¶ 40-41.\n\n    Waste Management employee Abraham Hernandez determined that Guillory was\n     sufficiently skilled in operating a front-end loader and instructed him to report for work\n     on July 10, 2012. Id.\n\n    Guillory operated the front-end loader at the Gasmer facility on the day shift from\n     roughly July 10, 2012 to July16, 2012. Id., p. 12, ¶ 30.\n\n    Soon thereafter Guillory moved to the night shift at the Gasmer facility. Id.\n\n    While working on the night shift Waste Management instructed Guillory to operate a\n     Harris Baler. Id., ¶ 31.\n\n    On August 5, 2012 Guillory reported for work on the night shift and began to operate\n     the Harris Baler. Petition, p. 13, ¶ 36.\n\n    During this shift Guillory climbed into the baler which engaged while he was in there,\n     severing his right leg below the knee and severing a portion of his left foot.

That is, once the\n       administrative dispute resolution process is initiated, a dispute continues\n       through the process until the dispute is resolved either by the parties or by\n       a binding decision through the resolution procedures.\n\nId. at 441.\n\n       The Ruttiger opinion provides a lengthy description of “the detailed notice and\n\nadministrative dispute resolution proceedings” encompassed by the Act. Id. at 441-43.\n\nIn describing the pervasiveness of the Act the Ruttiger court noted that the Act affords the\n\nDWC significant power to enforce the Act against the various parties in the worker’s\n\ncompensation system. Id. The Ruttiger court concluded:\n\n       It is apparent that the Act prescribes detailed, WCD-supervised, time-\n       compressed processes for carriers to handle claims and for dispute\n       resolution. It has multiple, sometimes redundant but sometimes additive,\n       penalty and sanction provisions for enforcing compliance with its\n       requirements.\n\nId. at 443. The court recognized that allowing an employee to circumvent the act by\n\nasserting common law causes of action would be “inconsistent with the Act’s goals and\n\nlegislative intent exhibited in the act” and could also “result in rewarding an employee who\n\nis dilatory in utilizing the Act’s detailed dispute resolution procedures, regardless of\n\nwhether the delay was intentional or inadvertent, because whether and when the dispute\n\nresolution begins is by and large dependent on the employee.” Id.\n\n       The number of appellate decisions recognizing the DWC’s exclusive jurisdiction\n\nover work-place injuries is voluminous.

The question before this court is, “Why?”\n\n       Guillory was injured on August 5, 2012.       Approximately two weeks later, he\n\nexecuted a claim form requesting compensation for a work-related injury. See Exhibit E.\n\nOn that form he stated that he was represented by Bradford J. Gilde. Id. Thus, fifteen\n\n\n\n\n                                            10\n\fdays after his work-related injury (over 2 ½ years ago) Guillory was at a minimum aware\n\nof the potential availability of worker’s compensation benefits. It is also fair to assume\n\nthat his legal representative knew (or had the ability to find out) how to obtain those\n\nbenefits. As was stated above, for almost two years Guillory has had two separate\n\nworker’s compensation policies by which he could have sought benefits. Yet he has made\n\nno effort to invoke his rights under either policy.\n\n       This court has found as a matter of law that Guillory’s claims against Waste\n\nManagement are barred by the “comp bar” defense, yet Guillory still refuses to file a claim\n\non Waste Management’s worker’s compensation policy. The Texas Supreme Court held\n\nin Port Elevator-Brownsville, L.L.C. v. Casados, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">358</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">238</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex., 2012) that a\n\ncompany cannot segregate its temporary employees and permanent employees for\n\npurposes of coverage under its worker’s compensation policy.

If Port Elevator's policy had set out certain\n       premiums solely for temporary workers and Port Elevator had not paid those\n       premiums, Casados would still have been covered under the policy and the\n       failure to pay premiums would be an issue between Port Elevator and Texas\n       Mutual.

Thus, Guillory is covered under Waste Management’s worker’s\n\ncompensation policy as a matter of law. This may be another reason why Waste\n\n\n\n\n                                              11\n\fManagement has failed to invoke its rights under the Act. See discussion, infra, n. 8\n\n(below).\n\n        The only plausible explanation for Guillory’s failure to even try to claim his benefits\n\nunder the Texas Workers’ Compensation Act is that he and his counsel decided early in\n\nthe course of this litigation to try and circumvent the worker’s compensation system in an\n\nattempt to recover common law damages. Given the extreme nature of Guillory’s injury\n\nit is understandable why he would prefer common law remedies. However, this approach\n\nflies in the face of long standing legal precedence and well-established public policy. As\n\nthe Ruttiger court stated, “the extra-statutory cause of action provides incentive for an\n\ninjured worker to delay using the avenues for immediate relief that the Legislature\n\npainstakingly built into the law” and “distorts the balances struck in the Act and frustrates\n\nthe Legislature’s intent to have disputes resolved quickly and objectively.” Ruttiger, 381\n\nS.W.3d at 451. That is what happened in this case.8\n\n        This is not a factually complicated matter; the basic underlying facts are, for the\n\nmost part, undisputed. However, in his attempt to circumvent the worker’s compensation\n\nsystem, Guillory has had to assert highly questionable causes of action and include\n\nparties that simply have no business being in this litigation. As a result this litigation has\n\nburgeoned into an unnecessarily complicated and contentious morass. It has even\n\nresulted in an award of substantial attorney fees being assessed against Guillory, himself.\n\nNevertheless, Guillory continues down this untenable path fearing that any recognition by\n\n\n\n8 Fairness demands that the same inquiry be directed at both iWORKS and Waste Management: why didn’t\neither one of them file a claim with their worker’s compensation carrier? iWORKS’ position is stated, supra,\nat p. 1-2. iWORKS’ understanding of Waste Management’s position is that the Hold Harmless Agreement\nis unenforceable and that iWORKS has a contractual duty to provide the worker’s compensation coverage\nfor Guillory. This question is now moot given that iWORKS has filed a claim with TMIC and has begun the\nadministrative process required by the Act.\n\n\n                                                    12\n\fhim of a viable worker’s compensation claim will preclude him from his questionable\n\nattempt at recovering common law damages for his work-place injury.

In the first tier, the parties participate in a\n      “benefit review conference” conducted by a “benefit review officer.” TEX.\n      LAB. CODE ANN. §§ 410.021–.034 (West 2006 & Supp.2010). The\n      conference, which is a “nonadversarial, informal dispute resolution\n      proceeding,” is designed to inform the parties regarding the procedures\n      regarding a claim, discuss the facts and issues pertaining to the claim, and\n      “mediate and resolve disputed issues by agreement of the parties.” Id. §\n      410.021(3) (West 2006). “A dispute may be resolved either in whole or in\n      part at a benefit review conference.” Id. § 410.029(a) (West 2006). If the\n      conference results in the resolution of disputed issues or in a settlement,\n      the benefit review officer reduces the agreement to writing and the parties\n      and the officer sign the agreement. Id. § 410.029(b) (West 2006). If the\n      parties fail to resolve all parts of a dispute at the benefit review conference,\n      the benefit review officer similarly prepares a written report that delineates\n      the status of the case. Id. § 410.031 (West 2006).\n\n      In the second tier, “[i]f issues remain unresolved after a benefit review\n      conference,” the parties may agree to arbitrate, and absent such an\n      agreement, the parties may seek relief at a “contested case” hearing. Id. §§\n      410.104, 410.151–.169 (West 2006). In the third tier, a party may seek\n      review by an administrative appeals panel. Id. §§ 410.201–.208 (West\n      2006). Finally, in the fourth tier, a party that has exhausted its administrative\n      remedies may seek judicial review. Id. §§ 410.251–.308 (West 2006).\n\nIn Re New Hampshire Ins.

And there are various elements that affect whether an injury is\n        compensable, including the worker's employment status as an employee or\n        independent contractor at the time of injury, whether the worker was injured\n        in the course and scope of employment, who controlled the employee's\n        work when the injury occurred, and whether a particular employer has an\n        insurance policy in effect.

Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 241 S.W.3d at 519. iWORKS has consistently claimed\n\nthat it has a worker’s compensation policy and that Waste Management controlled the\n\nGuillory’s work when his injury occurred. These are issues within the purview of the Act\n\nand over which the DWC has exclusive jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n\n14 The Morales Court addressed these issues in the context of determining which standard of review set\nforth in the Act should apply to judicial review of a final decision from a DWC appeals panel. If the issues\nbeing appealed involve “compensability” then the standard of review is the “modified de novo” standard\nestablished by §410.301. Issues that do not address compensability are reviewed under a “substantial-\nevidence” standard. Morales, 241 at 516-17. The outcome of this question of compensability also effects\nvenue and the appropriate scope of judicial review.

Co.15 the court addressed the DWC’s exclusive jurisdiction\n\nin the context of common law breach of contract claims and disputed coverage. The Court\n\nheld that the Fodge decision mandated that the claimant’s breach-of-contract claim “is\n\nwithin the Commission’s exclusive jurisdiction.” Id., 157 S.W.3d at 80. The Court also\n\nheld that:\n\n\n          We likewise reject [Claimant’s] assertions that the Commission’s exclusive\n          jurisdiction over worker’s compensation benefits claims does not extend to\n          determining whether coverage existed at the time of [Claimant’s] injury. The\n          legislature has granted the Commission exclusive jurisdiction over claims\n          for policy benefits. Fodge, 63 S.W.3d at 805. In adjudicating such claims,\n          the Commission will necessarily have to interpret compensation policies\n          and determine the period in which coverage existed.

For the various reasons discussed above, none of the parties were\n\neager to do so. iWORKS’ has relented and filed a claim with its worker’s compensation\n\ncarrier. This will start the administrative process necessary to exhaust the remedies\n\nprovided by the DWC. However, until those remedies are fully exhausted this Court lacks\n\nsubject-matter jurisdiction. Therefore, this Court must dismiss Plaintiffs’ claims as a\n\nmatter of law.\n\n                                             VI.\n                                           Prayer\n\n       Defendants iWORKS, Trevino, and Gutierrez pray that the Court grant the relief\n\nrequested herein and for any and all other relief to which they are entitled in law or equity.\n\n                                           Respectfully submitted,\n\n\n                                           ___/s/_David N.

In support thereof it would show this honorable Court the following:\n\n                                             I.\n\n         iWORKS files this Supplement to iWORKS’ Plea to the Jurisdiction in order to\n\npresent to the Court additional evidence, recently obtained, which supports its Plea to the\n\nJurisdiction.\n\n      A. Exhibit G – Texas Mutual Claim\n\n         Exhibit G is Texas Mutual Insurance Company’s acknowledgement of a claim for\n\nMose Guillory.     This shows that there is a pending matter subject to the exclusive\n\njurisdiction of the Texas Department of Insurance – Division of Workers’ Compensation\n\n(“DWC”). Until this administrative process has run its course and Plaintiff has exhausted\n\nall of his administrative remedies, this Court lacks subject-matter-jurisdiction.\n\n      B. Exhibit H – Correspondence from Gilde to the DWC\n\n         Exhibit H is correspondence that was produced this week by Plaintiff’s counsel.\n\nThis is a letter from Brad Gilde to the DWC dated August 12, 2013. It is styled as a\n\n“Notice, Stay, and Preservation Letter.”      Although litigation was ongoing and both\n\fiWORKS and Waste Management were represented by counsel,1 neither Defendant was\n\ncopied on this correspondence. Plaintiff attached two separate DWC-041 (“Employee’s\n\nClaim for Compensation for a Work-Related Injury of Occupational Disease”) forms to the\n\nletter.    One names iWORKS as Plaintiff’s employer and the other names Waste\n\nManagement as his employer. Thus, Plaintiff’s counsel recognized that Plaintiff had a\n\nclaim for compensation under two separate worker’s compensation policies and elected\n\nto forego pursuing those claims.\n\n          Gilde’s letter to the DWC purports to reserve Plaintiff’s right to seek relief from the\n\nDWC in the event he is unsuccessful in this Court. This approach turns the purpose of\n\nthe entire worker’s compensation system on its head. This letter demonstrates that\n\nPlaintiff was well aware of the requirements under the Texas Labor Code yet consciously\n\nchose to attempt to circumvent that process in hopes of a common law verdict. This is\n\nnot the public policy of Texas.\n\n          This letter to the DWC admits that it “is submitted: (1) as a notice of claim for\n\ncompensation . . . (3) as a preservation of right to file and seek a claim for compensation\n\n. . . and (5) pursuant to Tex. Labor Code §409.004.” Ex. G (emphasis in original). The\n\nletter further states that “. . . this letter . . . is not an election or denial of a claim for\n\ncoverage.” Id. Plaintiff cannot hedge his bets with the administrative agency while\n\nimproperly seeking a judicial remedy in this Court without first exhausting his\n\nadministrative remedies.         His failure to do so in this matter, despite knowing the\n\nadministrative requirements set forth in the Texas Labor Code, deprives this Court of\n\nsubject-matter jurisdiction over Plaintiff’s claims.\n\n                                                  II.\n\n1   At that time Aric Garza was counsel for iWORKS.\n\f                                           Prayer\n\n       Defendants iWORKS, Trevino, and Gutierrez pray that the Court grant the relief\n\nrequested in their Plea to the Jurisdiction and for any and all other relief to which they are\n\nentitled in law or equity.\n\n                                           Respectfully submitted,\n\n\n                                           ___/s/_David N.

       MANAGEMENT, INC., PATSY HOGAN AND OLD REPUBLIC INSURANCE\n                              COMPANY, RELATORS\n\n            ══════════════════════════════════════════\n                      ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS\n            ══════════════════════════════════════════\n\n                                          PER CURIAM\n\n       Relators in this mandamus proceeding contend that the trial court abused its discretion\n\nwhen it refused to dismiss claims over which the Division of Workers’ Compensation has\n\nexclusive jurisdiction. Because all of the claims arise out of relators’ investigation, handling, and\n\nsettling of claims for workers’ compensation benefits, we agree.\n\n       In 1998, Glenn Johnson suffered traumatic and debilitating injuries while working for\n\nASARCO. The parties do not dispute that Johnson was severely injured or that he is entitled to\n\nreceive lifetime workers’ compensation benefits. Disputes over the details and amounts of those\n\nbenefits, however, led Johnson to request a benefit review conference in 2008, which led to a\n\ncontested case hearing the following year. It appears from the parties’ briefs that the suit for\n\njudicial review of that decision remains pending in the district court.\n\n       Meanwhile, separate from the administrative proceedings, Johnson and his wife, Natalie,\n\nfiled the underlying suit against ASARCO’s workers’ compensation insurance provider Old\n\nRepublic Insurance Company; its claims services contractors Crawford & Company and Crawford\n\n& Company Healthcare Management, Inc.; and their employee Patsy Hogan (collectively,\n\fCrawford). The Johnsons allege that, over a period of nearly ten years, Crawford engaged in “a\n\nbattle plan to delay, discourage and deny” benefits that the Johnsons were entitled to receive.\n\nSpecifically, the Johnsons contend that Crawford (a) wrongfully disputed, denied, and delayed\n\nmedical benefits, (b) misrepresented which benefits were and were not covered, (c) failed to\n\nprovide required notices and other information, (d) repeatedly agreed to pay for benefits and\n\nservices but then refused to do so, (e) performed inadequate and misleading investigations into the\n\nJohnsons’ claim for benefits, and (f) falsely accused the Johnsons of insurance fraud, leading to\n\ntheir wrongful arrests and a two-year prosecution that ultimately terminated in the Johnsons’ favor.\n\nIn short, the Johnsons allege that, “[r]ather than manage the claim” and adjust it “in a fair and\n\nreasonable manner,” Crawford “resorted to combat tactics to wreak havoc on Glenn’s and\n\nNatalie’s lives.”\n\n       Based on these allegations, the Johnsons pled numerous causes of action, some sounding\n\nin tort (negligence; gross negligence; negligent, fraudulent, and intentional misrepresentation;\n\nfraud; fraud by non-disclosure; fraudulent inducement; intentional infliction of emotional distress;\n\nmalicious prosecution; and conspiracy); some sounding in contract (breach of contract; quantum\n\nmeruit; and breach of the common law duty of good faith and fair dealing); and some alleging\n\nviolations of statutory duties (under the Texas Insurance Code and the Texas Deceptive Trade\n\nPractices Act). The Johnsons sought relief in the form of actual damages for physical injuries,\n\nmental injuries, loss of income, and loss of reputation; exemplary damages; statutory damages;\n\nand injunctive relief prohibiting Crawford from continuing to engage in such “extreme and\n\noutrageous” conduct.\n\n       The Johnsons specifically pled that the Texas Workers’ Compensation Act does not require\n\nthem to pursue their claims through its administrative procedures or otherwise exhaust\n\n\n\n                                                 2\n\fadministrative remedies because (1) the Act’s administrative procedures do not apply to some of\n\ntheir claims; (2) Crawford’s “subterfuge” of the workers’ compensation system relieves the\n\nJohnsons from any duties under that system; and (3) the Johnsons are seeking to recover for\n\n“independent injuries . . . that are unrelated to [Glenn’s] workers[’] compensation injuries and the\n\nbenefits that he is entitled to under that system.” While the Johnsons agree that they must pursue\n\ntheir claims for workers’ compensation benefits through the administrative process, they contend\n\nthat they can pursue these claims for additional, independent, and “unrelated” damages in the\n\ncourts.\n\n          Crawford disagreed and filed a plea to the jurisdiction and motion for summary judgment.\n\nRelying primarily on our decision in Texas Mutual Insurance Co. v. Ruttiger, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">381</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">430</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(Tex. 2012), Crawford argued that the Texas Department of Insurance Division of Workers’\n\nCompensation has exclusive jurisdiction over all of the Johnsons’ claims because they arise out of\n\nthe workers’ compensation claims-handling process. Conceding that the claims for malicious\n\nprosecution and for intentional infliction of emotional distress could “arguably survive the\n\nlandmark decision in Ruttiger,” Crawford alternatively asserted that no evidence supported those\n\nclaims. The trial court dismissed the Johnsons’ claims for breach of the common law duty of good\n\nfaith and fair dealing and for violations of the Texas Insurance Code but refused to dismiss any of\n\nthe other claims. The court of appeals denied Crawford’s petition for mandamus relief.1\n\n\n\n\n          1\n           ___ S.W.3d ___. The court of appeals concluded that Crawford is not entitled to mandamus relief because\n(1) “one could interpret” Crawford’s five-month delay in filing its petition for writ of mandamus, shortly before trial,\nas an “effort to further hinder the timely adjudication of the Johnsons’ claims”; (2) even if the court could review the\ndenial of Crawford’s plea to the jurisdiction by mandamus, Crawford has not shown that “unrelated topics appearing\nin the motion for summary judgment may also be reviewed via the same proceeding”; (3) the Johnsons created a fact\nissue by certifying through their counsel that they had exhausted all administrative remedies; and (4) “claims of\nmalicious prosecution inherently involve activity or misconduct outside the administrative avenues created by the\nworkers’ compensation laws,” nothing in the Act “purports to regulate such conduct or remedy . . . damages unrelated\nto the amount of workers’ compensation benefits to which an employee may be entitled,” and “because at least one\n\n                                                           3\n\f         We conclude that the Division of Workers’ Compensation has exclusive jurisdiction over\n\nthe Johnsons’ claims and the Workers’ Compensation Act provides their exclusive remedies. The\n\nAct designates the Department of Insurance as the administrative agency responsible “[for\n\noverseeing] the workers’ compensation system of this state” and establishes the Division of\n\nWorkers’ Compensation within the Department to “administer and operate” that system. TEX. LAB.\n\nCODE § 402.001. It is the Division’s duty to “(1) regulate and administer the business of workers’\n\ncompensation in this state; and (2) ensure that [the Act] and other laws regarding workers’\n\ncompensation are executed.” Id. § 402.00114. The Division must monitor insurance carriers,\n\nemployers, and others “for compliance with commissioner rules, this subtitle, and other laws\n\nrelating to workers’ compensation.” Id. § 414.002(a). The Division or its commissioner may\n\nimpose an array of sanctions against those who fail to comply, including a cease-and-desist order\n\nand administrative penalties up to $25,000 per day per occurrence. Id. § 415.021(a). As we\n\nexplained in Ruttiger, the Act, as substantially revised in 1989, “prescribes detailed, [Division]-\n\nsupervised, time-compressed processes for carriers to handle claims and for dispute resolution”\n\nand “has multiple, sometimes redundant but sometimes additive, penalty and sanction provisions\n\nfor enforcing compliance with its requirements.” 381 S.W.3d at 443.\n\n         In light of the Act’s comprehensive system for resolving workers’ compensation claims 2\n\nand the Division’s role in that process, we concluded in Ruttiger that the Act provides the exclusive\n\nprocedures and remedies for claims alleging that a workers’ compensation carrier has improperly\n\n\n\ncause of action continues to exist, despite Ruttiger, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing\nto dismiss all the causes of action.” Id. at ___.\n\n         2\n           See Liberty Mut.

Specifically, we held that the worker\n\nin that case could not recover against the carrier for violations of section 541.060 of the Texas\n\nInsurance Code, which prohibits all insurance carriers generally (not just workers’ compensation\n\ncarriers) from engaging in “unfair settlement practices with respect to a claim by an insured.” TEX.\n\nINS. CODE § 541.060(a). “Permitting a workers’ compensation claimant to additionally recover by\n\nsimply suing under general provisions of Insurance Code section 541.060,” we explained, “would\n\nbe inconsistent with the structure and detailed processes of the Act.” Ruttiger, 381 S.W.3d at 443.\n\nWe concluded that the Act’s “provisions for dispute resolution and remedies for failing to comply\n\nwith those provisions in the workers’ compensation context are exclusive of those in section\n\n541.060.” Id. at 444.3\n\n        We also held that the claimant in Ruttiger could not recover on his claims under section\n\n542.003(a)(3) of the Insurance Code, which requires insurers to “adopt and implement reasonable\n\nstandards for the prompt investigation of claims arising under the insurer’s policies.” TEX. INS.\n\nCODE § 542.003(a)(3). “[I]n light of the specific substantive and procedural requirements built into\n\nthe Act,” we concluded, “and the detrimental effects on carriers flowing from penalties that can be\n\nimposed for failing to comply with those requirements, the Legislature did not intend for workers’\n\ncompensation claimants to have a cause of action against the carrier under the general provision\n\nof section 542.003.” Ruttiger, 381 S.W.3d at 445.\n\n        For the same reasons, we also overruled our precedent that pre-dated the current version of\n\nthe Act and held that “an injured employee may not assert a common-law claim for breach of the\n\nduty of good faith and fair dealing against a workers’ compensation carrier.” Id. at 433 (overruling\n\nAranda v. Ins. Co. of N. Am., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1664828\"><a href=\"/opinion/1664828/aranda-v-insurance-co-of-north-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">748</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">210</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. 1988)). We reasoned that allowing the carrier\n\n\n        3\n          We likewise held that the claimant could not recover on his DTPA claim because that claim, “as pled and\nsubmitted to the jury[,] depended on the validity of his Insurance Code claim[s].” Ruttiger, 381 S.W.3d at 446.\n\n                                                       5\n\fto risk common law liability in addition to liability under the Act “distorts the balances struck in\n\nthe Act and frustrates the Legislature’s intent to have disputes resolved quickly and objectively.”\n\nId. at 451. “Recognizing and respecting the Legislature’s prime position in enacting, studying,\n\nanalyzing, and reforming the system, and its efforts in having done that,” we concluded that “[t]he\n\nAct effectively eliminates the need for a judicially imposed cause of action outside the\n\nadministrative processes and other remedies in the Act.” Id.\n\n       We did not hold in Ruttiger, however, that the Act bars every statutory and common law\n\nclaim that can be asserted against a workers’ compensation carrier. To the contrary, we concluded\n\nthat the Act did not bar a claim under section 541.061 of the Insurance Code, which makes it\n\nunlawful for an insurer to “misrepresent an insurance policy.” Id. at 445–46; see also TEX. INS.\n\nCODE § 541.061. We explained that, “[u]nlike section 541.060,” which prohibits unfair settlement\n\npractices, “section 541.061 does not specify that it applies in the context of settling claims.”\n\nRuttiger, 381 S.W.3d at 446. We held that because section 541.061’s prohibition against\n\nmisrepresentation of an insurance policy “does not evidence intent that it be applied in regard to\n\nsettling claims, it is not at odds with the dispute resolution process of the workers’ compensation\n\nsystem.” Id. We ultimately concluded, however, that there was no evidence to support the section\n\n541.061 claim in that case because there was no evidence of an “untrue statement made by [the\n\ninsurer] regarding the policy or any statement about the policy that misled [the plaintiff-insured].”\n\nId.\n\n       In summary, we held in Ruttiger that workers’ compensation carriers cannot be liable under\n\nthe Insurance Code for unfair claims settlement practices or for failing to adopt reasonable\n\nstandards for investigating claims, or under the common law for breach of a duty of good faith and\n\nfair dealing, because these claims “simply are not compatible with amended detailed procedural\n\n\n\n                                                 6\n\fand substantive provisions of the new Act.” Id. at 456. Although we agreed that “the new Act’s\n\nlanguage does not purport to preclude all types of claims against workers’ compensation insurers,”\n\nwe concluded that, for claims arising out of the claims-settlement process, “the current Act with\n\nits definitions, detailed procedures, and dispute resolution process demonstrate[s] legislative intent\n\nfor there to be no alternative remedies.” Id. at 444, 456.\n\n         In this case, the parties dispute whether and how Ruttiger applies to causes of action that\n\nwe did not specifically address in that case. The court of appeals concluded that it “is not as clear”\n\nthat we “vitiated the existence of” any other claims in Ruttiger because we “said nothing of” them.\n\n___ S.W.3d ___. The court read our Ruttiger decision to focus on whether the claims are\n\n“inconsistent with the current legislative/administrative workers’ compensation scheme,” and\n\nconcluded that neither Ruttiger nor Crawford explains how a malicious prosecution claim asserting\n\n“baseless criminal proceedings by an insurer against an employee and the amelioration of damages\n\ncaused by such misconduct fits in the legislative/administrative workers’ compensation scheme.”\n\nId. at ___. The court concluded that a malicious prosecution claim “does not serve to protect,\n\nsecure or timely resolve disputes involving the availability of workers’ compensation benefits due\n\na claimant,” and “because at least one cause of action continues to exist, despite Ruttiger, [the\n\ncourt could not] say that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to dismiss all the causes of\n\naction.” Id.\n\n         We agree with Crawford that the court of appeals read Ruttiger too narrowly. As other\n\ncourts of appeals have recognized,4 the rule we applied in Ruttiger is that the Act provides the\n\n\n         4\n            See, e.g., Davis v. Am. Cas.

App.—Eastland 2012, no pet.) (applying Ruttiger to hold that the Act precludes claims for\ncommon-law bad faith, statutory bad faith, fraud, and conspiracy to commit fraud based on allegations that carrier\ndelayed paying benefits and concealed the nature of its relationship with reviewing doctor because the claims related\nto “the manner in which the carrier had handled the processing of [the] workers’ compensation claim”).\n\n\n                                                         8\n\f       Nor does the Ruttiger rule depend on the nature of the relief the claimant seeks. The\n\nJohnsons contend that the Act does not bar their claims because they are seeking damages that are\n\n“unrelated” to workers’ compensation benefits and based on injuries that are “independent” of\n\nharm the Act is intended to prevent. As we noted in Ruttiger, however, “the current Act with its\n\ndefinitions, detailed procedures, and dispute resolution process demonstrat[es] legislative intent\n\nfor there to be no alternative remedies.” 381 S.W.3d at 444.\n\n       Applying the Ruttiger rule to this case, we first conclude that the Act bars the Johnsons’\n\nclaims for negligence, gross negligence, breach of contract, quantum meruit, breach of the duty of\n\ngood faith and fair dealing, and statutory violations. In support of these causes of action, the\n\nJohnsons allege that Crawford failed to act reasonably in responding to the Johnsons’ claims for\n\nbenefits and made and then breached promises and representations that it would pay certain\n\nbenefits. Because all of these claims arise out of Crawford’s investigation, handling, and settling\n\nof the Johnsons’ claim for workers’ compensation benefits, the Act provides the exclusive\n\nprocedures and remedies for these claims.\n\n       We reach the same conclusion regarding all of the Johnsons’ common law and statutory\n\ncauses of action based on allegations of deception, fraud, and misrepresentation. Because we held\n\nin Ruttiger that the Act does not necessarily bar a claim for misrepresenting an insurance policy\n\nunder section 541.061 of the Insurance Code, our analysis on these claims is a bit more complex.\n\nThe Johnsons contend that our holding in Ruttiger confirms that they can pursue all of their claims\n\nfor misrepresentation and fraud. But we based our holding in Ruttiger on the fact that “section\n\n541.061 does not specify that it applies in the context of settling claims.” Ruttiger, 381 S.W.3d at\n\n446. We held that, because section 541.061 “does not evidence intent that it be applied in regard\n\n\n\n\n                                                 9\n\fto settling claims, it is not at odds with the dispute resolution process of the workers’ compensation\n\nsystem.” Id.\n\n         This case presents a question we did not expressly address in Ruttiger: whether the Division\n\nhas exclusive jurisdiction over a claim for “misrepresentation of an insurance policy” when the\n\nalleged misrepresentation occurs within the claims-settlement context. We hold that it does.5 The\n\nAct specifically addresses and prohibits a carrier from making misrepresentations, including\n\nmisrepresentations “to an employee” regarding the Act’s provisions and “the reason for not paying\n\nbenefits or terminating or reducing the payment of benefits.” TEX. LAB. CODE\n\n§ 415.002(a)(1), (13). The Act’s comprehensive system for resolving workers’ compensation\n\nclaims encompasses prohibitions against fraud and misrepresentations made within the claims-\n\nsettlement context, and grants the Division authority to regulate and sanction any such conduct.\n\nBecause all of the Johnsons’ misrepresentation-based claims complain of misrepresentations that\n\nCrawford allegedly made in connection with its investigation, handling, and settling of the\n\nJohnsons’ claims for workers’ compensation benefits,6 we hold that the Division had exclusive\n\njurisdiction to address those claims.\n\n\n         5\n           At least two courts of appeals have reached this same conclusion. See Hopper, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">5853747</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *1, 4\n(holding that carrier was entitled to summary judgment on claim regarding “false statements” that claimants “were\nnot entitled to coverage” because the claim was “limited to complaints about delays, claim handling, and disputes\nregarding entitlement to benefits”); Bean, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">5450826</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *1 (holding that misrepresentation claims were within\nthe Division’s exclusive jurisdiction because those claims “concern[] the claims handling process,” and worker “did\nnot claim that the terms of the insurance policy covering his employer had been misrepresented to his employer”). As\nthe Hopper court explained, we stated in Ruttiger “that section 541.061 applies to misrepresentations of a policy’s\nterms, not misrepresentations about whether a specific claim is factually within a policy’s terms.” Hopper, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">5853747</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *3. The alleged misrepresentations in that case “concerned statements about whether [the worker’s] death\nresulted from a compensable injury and whether the Hoppers were his true beneficiaries,” and “[a]lthough Ruttiger\ndid not specifically involve common-law claims of fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation or unconscionability,\nthese claims fail in the present case because there is no evidence here of any fraudulent, negligent, or unconscionable\nconduct that does not implicate the claim-settlement process.” Id. at *3–*4.\n         6\n           The Johnsons allege, for example, that Crawford “made blatantly false statements to avoid coverage and to\navoid paying both income and medical benefits”; made “clearly untrue statements of material facts, including\nwithholding proper home healthcare and paying the injured worker and his spouse directly to arrange and provide\nnecessary care”; and “failed to state and to disclose known material facts that the lifetime income benefits were\npayable.”\n\n                                                         10\n\f         We now turn to the Johnsons’ claims for malicious prosecution and intentional infliction\n\nof emotional distress, which are both based on allegations that Crawford falsely reported to a\n\ndistrict attorney that the Johnsons committed insurance fraud by requesting mileage\n\nreimbursements for travel that had not occurred. We hold that the Division has exclusive\n\njurisdiction over these claims because they also arise out of Crawford’s investigation, handling,\n\nand settling of the Johnsons’ claims for workers’ compensation benefits. The mileage\n\nreimbursements at issue were part of the Johnsons’ medical benefits under the Act, and carriers\n\nare required to report suspected fraud to the Department or to an authorized governmental entity\n\nas part of their claims-handling responsibilities. TEX. INS. CODE § 701.051(a). If a carrier\n\nknowingly and intentionally makes a false or misleading statement with the intent to deny the\n\npayment of a benefit, as the Johnsons allege Crawford did in this case, the Act provides the\n\nclaimant with remedies, including criminal penalties. TEX. LAB. CODE §§ 415.008, 418.001.\n\nBecause the Johnsons’ causes of action for malicious prosecution and intentional infliction of\n\nemotional distress arise out of Crawford’s investigation, handling, and settling of a workers’\n\ncompensation claim, we hold that the Division had exclusive jurisdiction over those complaints.7\n\n         Finally, we turn to the Johnsons’ argument that Natalie Johnson is not seeking relief as an\n\nASARCO employee and thus her claims are independent of the Act and therefore not barred by it.\n\n\n\n\n         7\n           Because the Act’s grant of exclusive jurisdiction bars the courts from exercising jurisdiction over the claims,\nwe reject the Johnsons’ complaints that Crawford waived its argument that the Act bars the claims for malicious\nprosecution and is judicially estopped from raising them on mandamus. The Johnsons contend that Crawford’s counsel\n“judicially admitted” in the trial court that the malicious prosecution claim “is outside of comp,” and “[c]omp has\nnothing to do with malicious prosecution and we’re not arguing that it does.” We need not decide whether these\nstatements could constitute a waiver, judicial admission, or the basis for judicial estoppel, because even if they could,\nsuch doctrines cannot create subject-matter jurisdiction where it does not otherwise exist.
