Robert L. Miller, Jr.,\n                                            Chief Judge.\n\n                                    ORDER\n\n       Eric Sanders brought this action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claiming that Susan\nCollins, an Indiana deputy prosecutor, provoked county jailers to violate his\nconstitutional rights while he was being held as a pretrial detainee. The district\ncourt on the eve of trial dismissed the suit sua sponte after affording Sanders an\nopportunity to object; Sanders appeals the dismissal and we affirm.\n\n\n\n\n       *\n        After an examination of the briefs and the record, we have concluded that\noral argument is unnecessary. Thus, the appeal is submitted on the briefs and the\nrecord. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2).\n\fNo. 05-1957                                                                     Page 2\n\n       In February 2001, Sanders was charged with murder in Lake County,\nIndiana, and ordered detained in the county jail pending trial. While there, he\nrepeatedly telephoned two of the state’s witnesses, prompting prosecutors to obtain a\nno-contact order from the Indiana court assigned to the case. Sanders promptly\nviolated the order, so Collins admittedly asked a jail warden to prevent him from\nmaking further calls to the two witnesses. The warden instead placed Sanders in\n“isolation lock-down” for almost a year, which, according to Sanders, subjected him\nto “extreme and excessive punitive confinement.” Sanders was later convicted of the\ncharged murder and is now in state prison serving a 65-year sentence.\n\n       In his complaint Sanders alleged that Collins did more than ask for a phone\nrestriction and in fact was behind the transfer to segregation. (Sanders also blamed\njail employees for the move, but after filing this suit he settled with the other\ndefendants who were not dismissed at initial screening, see 28 U.S.C. § 1915A; only\nthe claim against Collins is before us.) Collins answered the complaint and moved\nfor judgment on the pleadings, which the district court denied. Both Sanders and\nCollins then moved for summary judgment, which the court also denied.\nUndeterred, Collins sought leave to submit a second motion for summary judgment,\nand when the district court refused, she sought reconsideration of that ruling to no\navail. Sanders and Collins thus headed for trial, and both sides announced they\nwere ready.\n\n       Four days before trial, however, the district court concluded while preparing\njury instructions that Sanders had no case because he did not contend, nor could he\nprove, that Collins did anything other than ask the warden to enforce the no-contact\norder by preventing Sanders from calling the two witnesses who were off limits. The\ncourt, explaining that previously it “did not glean” this shortcoming from Collins’s\nmotions, reasoned that Sanders had no right to contact those witnesses in light of\nthe no-contact order, and that Sanders had no evidence that Collins “intended or\nexpected the lockdown” that followed her conversation with the warden.\nNonetheless, the district court, recognizing that its “understanding of the record may\nbe in error,” scheduled a telephonic hearing to allow Sanders “to explain any\nmisunderstanding the court may have and tell the court what evidence he intended\nto present at trial to prove his claim.” During that hearing, Sanders confirmed the\ncourt’s suspicion by stating he intended to argue that Collins violated his due\nprocess rights when she asked the warden to enforce the no-contact order by\nrestricting his telephone access without first allowing him the opportunity to deny\nviolating the order. The district court then dismissed the suit, reasoning that\nSanders could not prove a constitutional violation because he lacked evidence that\nCollins was involved in the decision to place him in segregation.\n\n       On appeal, Sanders principally argues that the district court erred by failing\nto give him “notice and an opportunity to respond” before dismissing on the ground\n\fNo. 05-1957                                                                     Page 3\n\nthat his claim against Collins could not succeed. That contention is untenable; even\nif the court’s action can be construed as a sua sponte grant of summary judgment\nthat required notice and an opportunity for Sanders to respond, see Dawson v.\nNewman, 419 F.3d 656, 660 (7th Cir. 2005); English v. Cowell, 10 F.3d 434, 437 (7th\nCir.1993), Sanders got both. Indeed the better characterization of the court’s action\nis that it reconsidered the earlier denial of Collins’s motion for summary judgment,\nso Sanders cannot possibly have been caught off guard when the court called upon\nhim to disclose the evidence he would use to prove that Collins participated in the\ndecision to send him to segregation.\n\n       All that remains, then, is Sanders’s observation that during the telephonic\nhearing he told the district court he received a letter from Collins in which she\nadmitted having “requested the Lake County Jail Warden to place him in the\nlockdown section.” Sanders was not under oath when he disclosed the existence of\nthis purported letter, and he did not elaborate on when or why Collins sent it.\nNeither had he alluded to it previously, not in his lengthy complaint or his own\nmotion for summary judgment, not in his response to Collins’s motion for summary\njudgment, and certainly not in the final pretrial order the parties prepared and the\ncourt approved two months before. Sanders, in fact, claimed that he no longer had\nthe letter and could not obtain it, and although secondary evidence may be\nadmissible to prove the contents of a writing that is lost or destroyed, see Fed. R.\nEvid. 1004, the proponent must first establish that the writing truly cannot be\nproduced, see United States v. McGaughey, 977 F.2d 1067, 1071 (7th Cir. 1992).\n\n       In this case, when the district court asked if Sanders had the letter, he simply\nresponded that “everything was taken” while he was at the Lake County Jail. He\ndid not assert that he tried to recover the letter or his other property, nor did he\nmaintain that he requested a copy or even asked Collins about the letter during\ndiscovery. Sanders thus failed to offer any evidentiary support for his allegation\nabout the letter that could overcome a renewed motion for summary judgment. See\nSalvadori v. Franklin Sch. Dist., 293 F.3d 989, 996 (7th Cir. 2002) (“The mere\nexistence of an alleged factual dispute is not sufficient to defeat a summary\njudgment motion. To successfully oppose the motion, the nonmovant must present\ndefinite, competent evidence in rebuttal.”). Nor did he request additional time to\nprocure the necessary evidence, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f), and even now he does not\nexplain what further steps he would have taken had the court given him additional\ntime. By the time of the telephonic hearing, his case was more than two-and-a-half\nyears old, and discovery had been closed for over a year. We cannot conclude, then,\nthat the district court abused its discretion by ruling on the record as it stood when\nSanders previously announced he was ready for trial.\n\n      Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.\n\f",
