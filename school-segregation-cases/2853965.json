WOOD, Circuit\nJudges.\n  EASTERBROOK, Circuit Judge. Gloria Nelson and her\nmother Linda Mitchell rented a single-family house in\nChicago from Bertha McGee. The lease called for a security\ndeposit of $2,500, which Nelson and Mitchell (collectively\n“the tenants”) paid in cash. McGee put the money in a\nstrongbox—a misstep, as an ordinance requires landlords to\ninvest security deposits in segregated, interest-bearing\naccounts. When a dispute arose about the condition of the\npremises, McGee launched an eviction proceeding in state\n\f2                                                No. 03-2297\n\ncourt; the tenants moved out and filed a counterclaim\nseeking return of the security deposit. McGee’s lawyer in\nthat action counseled her to bank the security deposit in\ncompliance with the ordinance, and she did. Before the\nstate court had resolved the litigation, however, McGee\nwithdrew and spent the money. McGee says that she\nanticipated that the state court would rule in her favor, so\nthat there was no need to wait for “her” money. The state\njudge saw things otherwise, determining that the tenants\nhad complied with all of their obligations and that McGee\nowed double damages plus interest (a total of $5,207.50) for\nfailing to return the security deposit after the tenants quit\nthe premises. Unable (or at least unwilling) to pay this\njudgment, McGee filed a federal bankruptcy proceeding and\nsought a discharge. Bankruptcy Judge Squires ruled in\nMcGee’s favor, but District Judge Shadur reversed. See\n2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7208 (N.D. Ill. Apr. 29, 2003). He\nfound that withdrawal of the security deposit while the\nstate litigation was pending amounted to “defalcation while\nacting in a fiduciary capacity” and foreclosed the debt’s\ndischarge. See 11 U.S.C. §523(a)(4).\n   As far as we can determine, neither this circuit nor any\nother has addressed the question whether a landlord’s im-\nproper retention of a security deposit amounts to “defalca-\ntion while acting in a fiduciary capacity” for purposes of\n§523(a)(4). Perhaps no general answer is possible, for some\njurisdictions (or leases) may treat the landlord’s position as\n“fiduciary” while others do not. (There can be no doubt that,\nif McGee was the tenants’ fiduciary, withdrawal and\nspending the money during the eviction litigation was an\nact of defalcation. See Meyer v. Rigdon, 36 F.3d 1375, 1383-\n85 (7th Cir. 1994).) It is not hard to imagine arrangements\nthat entitle landlords to treat security deposits as their own\nwhile tenancy continues, much as insurance companies may\ncommingle prepaid premiums with general corporate funds\n\fNo. 03-2297                                                    3\n\neven though they must repay any unearned premium to an\ninsured who cancels the policy before the end of its term. If\nthe lease or governing statute treats the deposit as a form\nof loan to the landlord in order to create the possibility of a\nsetoff if the tenant later incurs a debt to the landlord, then\nthe tenant becomes an unsecured creditor in bankruptcy.\nOn this understanding, each side’s obligation—the tenant’s\nto pay rent and cover any damage, and the landlord’s to\nrepay the deposit—is unsecured, which makes the debts\n“mutual” and readily offset. Likewise, however, it is easy to\nimagine arrangements, created by contract or statute, that\nrequire landlords to treat security deposits as trust funds\nand thus create fiduciary duties. That is how the district\njudge read Chicago’s ordinance. (As the ordinance super-\nsedes inconsistent terms of any lease, we confine attention\nto the legislative language.)\n    Chicago Municipal Code §5-12-080(a) provides:\n    A landlord shall hold all security deposits . . . in a\n    federally insured interest-bearing account in a\n    bank, savings and loan association or other finan-\n    cial institution . . . . A security deposit and interest\n    due thereon shall continue to be the property of the\n    tenant making such deposit, shall not be commin-\n    gled with the assets of the landlord, and shall not\n    be subject to the claims of any creditor of the\n    landlord or of the landlord’s successors in interest,\n    including a foreclosing mortgagee or trustee in\n    bankruptcy.\nSubsection (c) adds that the interest paid into the inter-\nest-bearing account belongs to the tenant. Subsection (d)\nrequires the landlord to provide an accounting and return\nthe deposit (less deductions for unpaid rent and damage to\nthe premises) promptly after the tenant vacates.\n Subsection (a) contains five distinct rules: (1) the money\nmust be deposited in an insured account in a financial\n\f4                                                No. 03-2297\n\ninstitution; (2) the account must earn interest; (3) the funds\nremain the tenant’s property while on deposit; (4) every\ntenant’s deposit must not be commingled with other assets;\nand (5) the funds “shall not be subject to the claims of any\ncreditor of the landlord”. The second requirement— that\neach account earn interest—is not relevant to analysis\nunder the Bankruptcy Code. Nor is the fifth requirement.\nFederal law preempts any effort by state and local govern-\nments to determine which assets may be reached, for what\npurposes, by particular creditors. See, e.g., Perez v. Camp-\nbell, 402 U.S. 637 (1971). The meaning of the words in\n§523(a)(4) is a question of federal law, see In re Frain, 230\nF.3d 1014, 1017 (7th Cir. 2000), which state and local\ngovernments cannot influence by attaching the word “trust”\nor any equivalent label to arrangements that lack the\nnormal attributes of those devices. That is why we held in\nIn re Marchiando, 13 F.3d 1111 (7th Cir. 1994), that a state\nlaw calling the proceeds of lottery-ticket sales “trust funds”\nhad no effect in bankruptcy, for the state had not required\nretailers to use normal trust devices. The law at issue in\nMarchiando amounted to little more than an effort by the\nstate to prefer its claims as a creditor over those of the\nretailer’s other creditors. Bankruptcy law depends on, and\nimplements, entitlements defined by state law, see, e.g.,\nButner v. United States, 440 U.S. 48, 54 (1979); In re Wayco,\n947 F.2d 1330, 1332 (7th Cir. 1991) (applying this principle\nto ascertaining whether a trust had been created), but\nwhich of these entitlements is subject to discharge or a\ntrustee’s avoiding power is beyond state control. (Unless, of\ncourse, Congress decides to recognize local rules, as it has\ndone in providing that debtors may choose between the\nexemptions provided by federal and state law. See 11 U.S.C.\n§522(b).)\n  Chicago Municipal Code §5-12-080(a) does not attempt to\ngive the City a higher place in the priority queue. It is\nneutral rather than self-preferring legislation. And rules\n\fNo. 03-2297                                                 5\n\n(1), (3), and (4) do create a trust-like relation between\nlandlord and tenant, the sort of relation that federal law\nlabels “fiduciary.” Segregation of funds, management by\nfinancial intermediaries, and recognition that the entity in\ncontrol of the assets has at most “bare” legal title to them,\nare hallmarks of the trust. These real attributes, not the\nlabels applied by the ordinance, bring into play a fiduciary\nobligation and thus §523(a)(4). See Douglas G. Baird, The\nElements of Bankruptcy 52 (rev. ed. 2001). The ordinance\ncharges landlords with duties to be carried out on behalf of\ntenants, to protect their entitlement to return of deposits\nwith interest if they keep their part of the bargains.\n   By virtue of the formal separation and ownership rules,\nthe economic relation created by Chicago Municipal Code\n§5-12-080(a) is more clearly a “fiduciary” one than is the\nmanagement of a client’s funds by a lawyer—and Maksym\nv. Loesch, 937 F.2d 1237, 1241-42 (7th Cir. 1991), holds that\na lawyer acts as the client’s fiduciary in financial matters\neven when neither contract nor statute requires segregation\nof the client’s funds. Although we observed in Marchiando\nthat many fiduciary relations are characterized by dispari-\nties in the knowledge or economic status of the participants,\na condition not met here—neither McGee nor the tenants\nare specialists in the housing market—this is not a sine qua\nnon. A plutocrat who puts an investment account of\n$500,000 at the disposal of a recent high-school graduate for\nthe latter’s discretionary financial management may be\nacting foolishly but has created a fiduciary relation (even if\nnot a formal trust), and if the manager decides to “invest”\nthe account in No. 28 on a roulette wheel then §523(a)(4)\nwill prevent discharge of the debt.\n  Having demanded and received $2,500 under (statutory)\nterms designed to ensure that the money would be available\nfor return to the tenants if they kept their own promises,\nMcGee was obliged to act as the tenants’ fiduciary in\ninvesting and preserving the funds. Instead she made off\n\f6                                             No. 03-2297\n\nwith the money, an act of defalcation that disqualifies her\nfrom receiving a discharge.\n                                                AFFIRMED\n\nA true Copy:\n      Teste:\n\n                       ________________________________\n                       Clerk of the United States Court of\n                         Appeals for the Seventh Circuit\n\n\n\n\n                  USCA-02-C-0072—12-23-03\n\f",

Instead she made off\n\f6                                             No. 03-2297\n\nwith the money, an act of defalcation that disqualifies her\nfrom receiving a discharge.\n                                                AFFIRMED\n\nA true Copy:\n      Teste:\n\n                       ________________________________\n                       Clerk of the United States Court of\n                         Appeals for the Seventh Circuit\n\n\n\n\n                  USCA-02-C-0072—12-23-03\n\f</pre>",
