Stephen Chamberlain for Appellant\n\n        Todd C. Schroeder for Appellee\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\nSHAW, J.\n\n        {¶1} Defendant-appellant Jeremy Stober (“Stober”) appeals the March 28,\n\n2013, judgment of the Putnam County Common Pleas Court sentencing Stober to\n\nan aggregate prison term of 10 and one-half years following Stober’s jury trial\n\nconvictions for Sexual Battery in violation of R.C. 2907.03(A)(7), a felony of the\n\nthird degree, three counts of Gross Sexual Imposition in violation of R.C.\n\n2907.05(A)(1), all felonies of the fourth degree, and Importuning in violation of\n\nR.C. 2907.07(B)(1), a felony of the fifth degree.\n\n        {¶2} The facts relevant to this appeal are as follows. On September 17,\n\n2012, Stober was indicted in an eight count indictment for Tampering with\n\nEvidence in violation of R.C. 2921.12(A)(1), a felony of the third degree (Count\n\n1), four counts of Gross Sexual Imposition (“GSI”) in violation of R.C.\n\n2907.05(A)(1), all felonies of the fourth degree (Counts 2, 4, 6 and 7), Sexual\n\nBattery in violation of R.C. 2907.03(A)(7), a felony of the third degree (Count 3),\n\nImportuning in violation of R.C. 2907.07(B)(1), a felony of the fifth degree (Count\n\n5), and Attempted Sexual Battery in violation of R.C. 2923.02(A) and R.C.\n\n2907.03(A)(9), a felony of the fourth degree (Count 8). (Doc. 1). The Bill of\n\nParticulars specified that there were three alleged victims of the crimes, and that\n\nthe crimes took place over a time span ranging from 2001 through 2012. (Doc.\n\n158).\n\n                                        -2-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\n        {¶3} On September 18, 2012, Stober was arraigned and pled not guilty to\n\nthe charges against him. (Doc. 18).\n\n        {¶4} On October 31, 2012, Stober filed a “Motion for Relief from\n\nPrejudicial Joinder,” arguing that “it would be prejudicial to [Stober’s] defense to\n\njoin together in one trial all eight Counts consisting of different victims, spanning\n\na time frame over eleven years.” (Doc. 38).1 On December 14, 2012, the State\n\nfiled a response to this motion, contending that the law favored joinder, that the\n\noffenses were of the same or similar character, and/or that they were part of a\n\ncourse of criminal conduct.             (Doc. 54).       The State also contended that the\n\ntestimony of the separate witnesses would have been admissible anyway under\n\nEvid.R. 404(B). (Id.)\n\n        {¶5} On January 7, 2013, a hearing on pending motions was held.\n\nRegarding the “Motion for Relief from Prejudicial Joinder,” after hearing\n\narguments from both sides, the trial court stated that case law supported joinder for\n\nsimilar type offenses and overruled Stober’s motion. (Jan. 7, 2013 Tr. at 7). An\n\nentry reflecting this was filed January 22, 2013. (Doc. 71).\n\n        {¶6} The matter subsequently proceeded to a jury trial, which was held on\n\nFebruary 25-28, 2013. At trial, the State called 22 witnesses in its case-in-chief\n\n1\n  Stober also filed various other motions including, inter alia, two motions in limine (Docs. 40; 42), a\nmotion for change of venue (Doc. 41), a motion to suppress (Doc. 47), and a motion to dismiss Count 1 of\nthe Indictment (Doc. 66). None of these motions are related to the assignments of error in this appeal,\ntherefore we will not further discuss them.\n\n                                                  -3-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\nand 5 rebuttal witnesses. Stober called ten witnesses on his behalf and also took\n\nthe witness stand himself.\n\n         {¶7} Testimony was presented that Stober was a teacher at Kalida High\n\nSchool, beginning in the fall of 1993, and later employed by the school as a\n\ntechnology coordinator, while still occasionally teaching. (Tr. at 1245). Stober\n\nwas also the high school girls’ varsity volleyball coach for Kalida. (Id. at 1246-\n\n1247).\n\n         {¶8} Karen Fortman testified at trial that she took a class taught by Stober\n\nin 1994, Stober’s second year as a teacher, and that in that class, Stober singled her\n\nout and made a “spectacle” of her. (Tr. at 314). Fortman testified that the\n\nconstant teasing prompted her to leave class one day and go to the guidance office\n\nto request out of Stober’s class. (Tr. at 315). Fortman testified that after hearing\n\nof this, Stober called her to his office after school, closed the door and apologized.\n\n(Tr. at 317). According to Fortman, Stober then said that when he looked at\n\nFortman, he thought of her as someone he would want to be married to. (Id.)\n\n         {¶9} Mary Lynn Lanham testified at trial that she also played volleyball for\n\nStober, and graduated in 2001. She testified that while in high school, Stober sent\n\nher messages on ICQ chat. (Tr. at 343). Lanham testified that Stober asked her\n\nabout her personal life. (Tr. at 343-44). Lanham also testified that Stober sent her\n\na message one day that said if Stober “was [her] age [he] could see [himself] with\n\n                                          -4-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\n[Lanham], that [she] was his type.” (Tr. at 344). Lanham showed her mother this\n\nmessage, who testified to the same at trial. (Tr. at 730). Lanham did not report\n\nthe incident, however, because she did not want it to affect volleyball, which was\n\nvery important to her at the time. (Tr. at 345).\n\n           {¶10} J.L. was the first alleged victim to testify at trial. J.L. testified that\n\nshe played volleyball for Stober and that she graduated from Kalida in 2002. (Tr.\n\nat 357). J.L. testified that one day, Stober called J.L. into his office to talk about a\n\ncookout. (Id. at 359). J.L. then testified that Stober said he cared about her and\n\nher opinion. (Id.) Following this comment, J.L. testified that Stober hugged her,\n\npressing against her, having contact with her breasts. (Tr. at 360-361). J.L.\n\ntestified that the hug felt sexual to her, had a lasting effect on her, and that she did\n\nnot reciprocate in any manner. (Id.) That contact was the basis for the filing of\n\nCount 2, Gross Sexual Imposition (“GSI”), in the indictment.2 J.L. testified that\n\nshe told her parents about the incident, but she did not want to give up volleyball,\n\nso she did not take it any further. (Tr. at 363-364).\n\n           {¶11} J.L. also testified that years later, in 2008, she began a teaching\n\ncareer as a substitute at Kalida. (Tr. at 369). J.L. testified that one day in 2009\n\nStober came into her room, shut the door, and asked her why she did not tell\n\nStober about her pregnancy. (Tr. at 373). Stober also said to J.L. that he thought\n\n2\n    Stober was acquitted of this charge.\n\n                                             -5-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\nJ.L. was going to “wait around for [him].” (Id.) J.L. testified that Stober “made\n\nsome kind of inference about his wife, something happening to his wife,” adding,\n\n“[w]eren’t you going to wait for something to happen to Kristi, so that you and I\n\ncan be together?” (Id.)\n\n       {¶12} Jenna Missler testified at trial that she was a Spanish teacher at\n\nKalida. (Tr. at 483). Missler testified that Stober initiated instant-messaging\n\ncontact with her. (Tr. at 484). Missler testified that the messages began by being\n\nwork related then became more personal. (Tr. at 484). Missler testified that\n\nStober often sent messages to her that ended in “smiley” faces. (Id.) Missler\n\ntestified that the comments Stober sent her, specifically in 2006-2007, eventually\n\ncrossed the line, and she brought the comments to the sexual harassment\n\ndirector/coordinator. (Tr. at 512).\n\n       {¶13} C.K. was the second alleged victim who testified at trial.       C.K.\n\ntestified that although she was a student at Kalida, she did not have Stober as a\n\nteacher and she did not play volleyball. (Tr. at 535). C.K. testified that she came\n\ninto school one day after she changed her hair color, and while in class she\n\nreceived a text message about her hair looking nice from an unknown number.\n\n(Id. at 537). C.K. responded by asking who it was, and received the response,\n\n“you’ll find out.” (Id.)\n\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\n        {¶14} After talking with other girls, C.K. learned that the number that had\n\nmessaged her was Stober’s. (Tr. at 539). C.K. testified that she and Stober then\n\nengaged in regular texting with each other. (Tr. at 542). C.K. testified that the\n\ntexts were “flirtatious” in nature and that Stober would talk to her about a\n\nrelationship. (Tr. at 544-545). C.K. testified that Stober told her that he and his\n\nwife did not have sex anymore. In addition, C.K. testified that Stober sent her text\n\nmessages that made her feel good, such as calling her beautiful. (Tr. at 545).\n\n        {¶15} C.K. testified that some of the text messages were overtly sexual,\n\nwith Stober going so far as to say that he masturbated while he thought of her, that\n\n“he would be so big he would tear [her] up” and that “he could please [her] and he\n\ncould do so many things with [her].” (Tr. at 542, 544-45)        C.K. testified that\n\nStober told her that he had a video of himself masturbating and that he could send\n\nit to C.K. (Tr. at 559). Although the video was never sent, this video was later\n\nlocated on one of Stober’s cell phones.\n\n        {¶16} C.K. testified to an incident wherein she was alone with Stober in his\n\noffice, and Stober grabbed her butt and moaned, “grumbling like he liked it.” (Tr.\n\nat 546). C.K. testified to a separate incident wherein she was alone with Stober in\n\nhis office, and Stober exposed his penis to her and caused her to touch it. (Tr. at\n\n565).    These incidents, alleged to have occurred between March 2010 and\n\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\nFebruary of 2011 led to the State filing the GSI charge against Stober in Count 4\n\nof the indictment.3\n\n           {¶17} C.K. testified that Stober eventually sent her messages asking about\n\nher parents’ schedule. (Tr. at 547-48). C.K. testified that she lived with her\n\nfather, who worked third shift, and that she informed Stober of this. (Id.) C.K.\n\ntestified that about a week after she informed Stober of her father’s schedule,\n\nStober showed up at her house around 4 a.m. and knocked on the door. (Id. at\n\n552). C.K. testified that\n\n           I opened the door, I peeked my head around the corner; and I\n           seen him, and I froze. And he had stepped forward into the\n           house, pushing me backwards down onto the couch. Then he\n           started feeling up my shirt and down my shorts, was kissing me.\n           Proceeded to take my shorts off, stuck his fingers inside me and\n           then his penis.\n\n(Tr. at 552). C.K. testified that she was too scared to say no. (Tr. at 552). C.K.\n\ntestified that when Stober finished, he pulled up his shorts and walked out the\n\ndoor. (Tr. at 553). According to C.K. this occurred in June of 2010. This incident\n\nled to the State filing the Sexual Battery charge in Count 3 of the Indictment.\n\n           {¶18} C.K. testified that the messages continued from Stober, including\n\ncontinued talk of a potential relationship with C.K. (Tr. at 554). C.K. testified\n\nthat she told Jeff Burke about the texts and that she was uncomfortable receiving\n\n\n\n3\n    The dates in the Indictment were amended to comport with the evidence presented at trial. (Tr. at 1380).\n\n                                                      -8-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\nthem. (Tr. at 558). She also testified that she told the guidance counselor about\n\nreceiving messages. (Tr. at 559). C.K. testified that the text messages stopped\n\naround Thanksgiving after she graduated from high school. (Tr. at 569). She\n\ntestified that she had negative emotions, and later texted Stober, “asking him why\n\nhe did it.” (Tr. at 570). According to C.K., Stober messaged back asking who it\n\nwas that was messaging him. (Id.) C.K. testified that she messaged back, calling\n\nhim “a sick fuck,” a text which C.K. testified Stober never acknowledged. (Id.)\n\n           {¶19} C.K. testified she did not initially want to come forward to be\n\ninvolved because she was embarrassed, but did so after H.Z. asked her to do so.\n\n(Tr. at 582). C.K. testified that Stober directed her to erase a text message Stober\n\nhad sent her about not being able to have kids, so she had nothing to worry about.\n\n(Tr. at 661). This was one of the instances of Tampering with Evidence leading to\n\nthe filing of Count 1 of the Indictment.4\n\n           {¶20} H.Z. was the third alleged victim that testified at trial. H.Z. testified\n\nthat she was a 2012 Kalida graduate who had played volleyball for Stober. (Tr. at\n\n752). H.Z. was also a neighbor of Stober’s. (Id.) H.Z. testified she was in 7th\n\ngrade when she received her first text message from Stober, but for years the\n\nmessages were supportive and volleyball related. (Tr. at 753-754). H.Z. testified\n\nthat the messages turned sexual when she began dating her first boyfriend. (Tr. at\n\n4\n    Stober was acquitted of this charge.\n\n                                             -9-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\n757). H.Z. testified that Stober told her that her boyfriend did not deserve her and\n\nthat Stober could do better. (Id.)\n\n       {¶21} H.Z. testified that Stober asked about her sex life and made\n\ncomments about using his fingers on her, and later, he talked about oral sex. (Tr.\n\nat 754-758). These messages Stober sent to H.Z. allegedly occurred prior to H.Z.\n\nturning 16 and led to the State filing the Importuning charge in Count 5 of the\n\nIndictment.\n\n       {¶22} According to H.Z., the text messages between her and Stober\n\ncontinued through her sophomore year and into her junior year.           (Id.)   H.Z.\n\ntestified that some of the messages, but not all, were sexual. (Tr. at 762). H.Z.\n\ntestified that she had an eating disorder, and was depressed. (Tr. at 767-768). She\n\ntestified that some of the messages Stober sent her were supportive. (Id.) She also\n\ntestified that Stober talked about his personal life a lot, saying that H.Z. could\n\n“fix” Stober’s problems with his wife. (Tr. at 764, 766).\n\n       {¶23} H.Z. testified that the summer after her junior year, in June of 2011,\n\nshe drove to Stober’s residence and stopped in the driveway to drop off a paper for\n\na Volleyball camp. (Tr. at 773). H.Z. testified that Stober reached past the form\n\nshe had clearly extended out of the car and grabbed her breast. (Id.) H.Z. testified\n\nthat Stober acted as though it was an accident. (Tr. at 774). H.Z. testified that she\n\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\nthen left, but later Stober messaged her saying he wished she would come back.\n\n(Id.) This contact led to filing of the GSI charge in Count 6 of the Indictment.\n\n       {¶24} H.Z. testified that her senior year the text messages from Stober were\n\nmore than ever sexual, and that she continued to struggle with emotional\n\nproblems, an eating disorder, depression, and suicidal thoughts. (Tr. at 777). H.Z.\n\ntestified that she messaged Stober saying she was fat, and he said “prove to me\n\nyou’re fat.” (Tr. at 780). H.Z. sent him a picture of a scale showing her weight.\n\n(Id.) In response, Stober called her down to his office and told H.Z. to lift up her\n\nshirt. (Id.) Stober then put his hand on H.Z.’s waist, and ran it along to her\n\n“bottom” and then “laughed it off like it was no big deal.” (Id.) This contact was\n\nalleged to have occurred between August 2011 and October 2011, and led to the\n\nfiling of the GSI charge in Count 7 of the Indictment.\n\n       {¶25} H.Z. testified that Stober drove her to a volleyball all-star game that\n\nH.Z. was playing in and Stober was coaching. (Tr. at 784). H.Z. testified that on\n\nthe drive, Stober put his hand on her leg, squeezed it, and said they could go off\n\ninto the woods. (Tr. at 787). H.Z. declined and they continued on to the game.\n\n(Id.) H.Z. testified that it was clear to her that Stober’s intentions were sexual.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\n(Id.) This incident led to the filing of the Attempted Sexual Battery charge in\n\nCount 8 of the Indictment.5\n\n           {¶26} H.Z. testified that she was an office assistant at the Kalida High\n\nSchool during her free time, and that she eventually showed one of the messages\n\nStober sent her to Nancy Grote, who worked in the office as a secretary. (Tr. at\n\n796). H.Z. also confided in Amy Recker, a religion teacher, about the messages\n\nshe was receiving from Stober. (Tr. at 793).\n\n           {¶27} H.Z. was told that more evidence was needed, so she took it upon\n\nherself to initiate text messages with Stober. (Tr. at 797). H.Z. testified that she\n\nknew Stober would turn the messaging sexual, and he did. (Tr. at 798-801). Amy\n\nRecker then showed the text messages to school authorities, made a transcript of\n\nthem, and the school authorities contacted the police. (Tr. at 1067).\n\n           {¶28} The text “transcript” that was typed by Amy Recker was introduced\n\ninto evidence, but no other text “content” was introduced into the record. (Tr. at\n\n1069).        Amy Recker testified that before H.Z. decided to text Stober, they\n\nattempted to obtain the records of prior text message content, but were told they\n\ncould not get them. (Tr. at 1065). However, the State did introduce voluminous\n\ncell phone records of Stober, indicating that he had exchanged thousands of text\n\n\n\n\n5\n    Stober was acquitted of this charge.\n\n                                           -12-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\nmessages with C.K. and H.Z over a period of months, as far back as the records\n\ncould be traced.6 The content of prior text messages could not be reproduced.\n\n         {¶29} In his case-in-chief, Stober called several witnesses who testified that\n\nthey had never seen or witnessed Stober do anything inappropriate. Several of\n\nStober’s former volleyball players testified that Stober would say things like they\n\nlooked nice, but they did not find the comments inappropriate or offensive.\n\nThroughout the trial, Stober’s counsel painted the State’s case as a “witch hunt.”\n\n         {¶30} Stober also took the stand in his own defense. Stober admitted to\n\ntexting his volleyball players, and admitted that he messaged H.Z. and C.K. (Tr.\n\nat 1250, 1343-1360). Stober testified that his messages with H.Z. began when she\n\nwould watch Stober’s house while he was on vacation. (Tr. at 1250). Stober\n\ntestified that personal texts were exchanged between him and H.Z., as H.Z.\n\ndisclosed things to him. (Tr. at 1252).\n\n         {¶31} Stober testified that he also helped coach baseball, and that a former\n\nbaseball player of his committed suicide. (Tr. at 1253). Stober testified that the\n\nsuicide “shook” him and that he “wasn’t ever going to let that happen again.” (Tr.\n\nat 1255).\n\n\n\n6\n While the record reflected that thousands of text messages had been exchanged between Stober and C.K.\nand Stober and H.Z., Stober maintains on appeal that there were really only five or six text “conversations”\nper month between Stober and the girls, containing multiple “lines” of texts each, so that the actual number\nof texts exchanged was not in the thousands.\n\n                                                   -13-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\n         {¶32} Stober testified that H.Z. talked about suicide, and that he sent her\n\nmany supportive messages. (Tr. at 1256-57). Stober testified that he tried to play\n\na father figure role with H.Z. and that any sex-related talk came out of H.Z.’s\n\nquestions. (Tr. at 1266). Stober testified that H.Z. was not truthful, and that he\n\ndid not grab H.Z.’s butt or stomach. (Tr. at 1292-1293).\n\n         {¶33} Stober testified that alleged victim J.L. was a babysitter for his\n\nchildren when they were younger, and that J.L.’s family was close to his. (Tr. at\n\n1279). He testified that he doesn’t recall the “hug” J.L. described, and that he was\n\ninitially happy when J.L. came back to Kalida as a teacher because he thought she\n\ncould take over coaching volleyball one day. (Tr. at 1281-1285).\n\n         {¶34} Stober testified that alleged victim C.K. was lying, that he had never\n\nbeen to C.K.’s father’s house, and that her allegations were untrue. (Tr. at 1289).\n\nStober also testified that he did not squeeze C.K.’s butt or cause her to touch his\n\npenis.    (Id. at 1289-90)    Stober testified that C.K. was also lying about the\n\nmasturbation video, saying that he made it and offered to send it to his mistress,\n\nLori Fisher, who also testified at trial. (Tr. at 1273). Fisher testified on rebuttal\n\nthat Stober never mentioned the masturbation video to her or sent it to her. (Tr. at\n\n1404).\n\n         {¶35} Following the witnesses’ testimony and the parties’ closing\n\narguments, the case was submitted to the jury.          After deliberating, the jury\n\n                                         -14-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\nreturned Not Guilty verdicts on Count 1, Tampering with Evidence, Count 2,\n\nGross Sexual Imposition of J.L., and Count 8, Attempted Sexual Battery of H.Z.\n\nStober was found Guilty of Count 3, Sexual Battery of C.K., Count 4, Gross\n\nSexual Imposition of C.K., Count 5, Importuning of H.Z., and Counts 6 and 7,\n\nGross Sexual Imposition of H.Z.\n\n        {¶36} On March 18, 2013, Stober’s sentencing hearing was held.7 The\n\nState recommended that Stober receive maximum prison sentences on each count\n\nto be served consecutively for an aggregate prison term of 10 and one-half years.\n\nTwo of the victims who had testified at trial gave brief statements. Stober’s\n\ncounsel then made an argument in mitigation. Ultimately, the trial court sentenced\n\nStober to maximum, consecutive sentences for each count, for an aggregate prison\n\nterm of 10 and one-half years. A judgment entry memorializing Stober’s sentence\n\nwas filed March 28, 2013.\n\n        {¶37} It is from this judgment that Stober appeals, asserting the following\n\nassignments of error for our review.\n\n                    ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR 1\n        THE APPELLANT WAS DENIED DUE PROCESS AND A\n        FAIR TRIAL PURSUANT TO U.S. CONST.

Specifically, with regard to the Importuning conviction, Stober contends\n\nthat the State did not establish H.Z. was under 16 when she was receiving sexually\n\nsolicitous messages from Stober. With regard to the GSI convictions concerning\n\n                                      -17-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\nC.K. and H.Z., Stober argues that the State’s evidence as to the requisite element\n\nof “force” was insufficient.\n\n       {¶39} When an appellate court reviews a record for sufficiency, the\n\nrelevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to\n\nthe prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements\n\nof the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Monroe, 105 Ohio St.3d\n\n384, 2005–Ohio–2282, ¶ 47, citing State v. Jenks, 61 Ohio St.3d 259 (1991),\n\nsuperseded by state constitutional amendment on other grounds as stated in State\n\nv. Smith, 80 Ohio St.3d 89 (1997). Sufficiency is a test of adequacy, and the\n\nquestion of whether evidence is sufficient to sustain a verdict is one of law. State\n\nv. Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 386 (1997).\n\n             Sufficiency of the Evidence for Stober’s Importuning\n                              Conviction (Count 5)\n\n       {¶40} In this case, Stober was convicted of Importuning in violation of\n\nR.C. 2907.07(B)(1), which reads, in pertinent part, as follows\n\n       (B)(1) No person shall solicit another, not the spouse of the\n       offender, to engage in sexual conduct with the offender, when\n       the offender is eighteen years of age or older and four or more\n       years older than the other person, and the other person is\n       thirteen years of age or older but less than sixteen years of age,\n       whether or not the offender knows the age of the other person.\n\n       {¶41} Stober argues on appeal that the testimony was not clear beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt that H.Z. was solicited prior to turning 16. In addition, Stober\n\n                                       -18-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\nalso contends that it is not clear beyond a reasonable doubt that Stober ever\n\nsolicited H.Z. to engage in sexual conduct.\n\n      {¶42} At trial, H.Z. gave the following testimony.\n\n      Q [Prosecutor]: Was there ever a point when those text\n      messages began getting sexual?\n\n      A [H.Z.]: Yes.\n\n      Q: And do you recall when that was?\n\n      A: It was sophomore year during volleyball season when I was\n      dating my very first boyfriend.\n\n      Q: And while you were dating your very first boyfriend, the\n      defendant would text you sexually?\n\n      A:    Yes.\n\n      Q: And would that include what sort of references?\n\n      A: He basically would say that, you know, my boyfriend didn’t\n      deserve me; that he could do so much better; that guys in my\n      grade were immature, and that he is a mature kind of guy; and\n      he could show me what, you know, a true, like someone who –\n      someone who is like me, like how I should be treated.\n\n      Q: And would he speak sexually to [you]?\n\n      A: He would ask me like about my sex life and if, you know, if\n      I have done anything with him; and he would sometimes make\n      comments saying, well, let me know when this happens; let me\n      know, you know, when you do this for the first time.\n\n      Q: Did he ever make any comments via text messaging about\n      using his fingers on you?\n\n\n                                       -19-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\n       A:   Yes.\n\n       Q: And was that all of your sophomore year?\n\n       A:   Yes.\n\n       Q: And would he make any references to you performing oral\n       sex on him?\n\n       A:   That was not until junior year.\n\n       Q: So your sophomore year in the fall, there were references to\n       him penetrating you with his fingers?\n\n       A:   Yes.\n\n       Q: When is your birthday?\n\n       A:   January 16th.\n\n       Q: What Year?\n\n       A:   1994.\n\n       Q: And would that make you 15?\n\n       A:   Yes.\n\n       Q: Your Sophomore year?\n\n       A:   Yes.\n\n       Q: And that’s when you were receiving these text messages?\n\n       A:   Yes.\n\n(Tr. at 758-759).\n\n\n\n                                     -20-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\n       {¶43} On cross-examination, H.Z. was further questioned about these text\n\nmessages.\n\n       Q[Stober’s Counsel]: Okay. Okay. Now, when you say he\n       would talk to you about using his fingers and things of that\n       nature, was he telling you basically how things might happen\n       sexually?\n\n       A [H.Z.]: No. He said that he would use his fingers, not\n       somebody could use theirs. It was he using his.\n\n       Q: On who?\n\n       A:   On me.\n\n       Q: Okay. And this was your sophomore year?\n\n       A:   This was my sophomore year.\n\n       Q: And what was your response to that?\n\n       A: I didn’t really have a response. I mean, sometimes when he\n       – he said it more than once. There were times where I would\n       say, coach, you have a family, you have a wife. Other times I\n       would just let it go and say, ha ha, or, yeah, I guess, guess so.\n\n(Tr. at 830-831).\n\n       {¶44} Based on the foregoing testimony, we find that there was sufficient\n\ntestimony presented for a jury to have determined beyond a reasonable doubt that\n\nStober solicited sexual contact from H.Z. before she turned 16.        H.Z. was\n\nspecifically asked if Stober’s conversations regarding “using his fingers” on her\n\noccurred while she was 15 and she said that they did. Under these circumstances,\n\n\n                                      -21-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\nviewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, we find that a\n\nrational trier of fact could find all of the elements of Importuning proven beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.\n\n          Sufficiency of the Evidence for Stober’s GSI Convictions\n\n       {¶45} Stober was also convicted of three counts of GSI in violation of R.C.\n\n2907.05(A)(1), which reads as follows.\n\n       (A) No person shall have sexual contact with another, not the\n           spouse of the offender; cause another, not the spouse of the\n           offender, to have sexual contact with the offender; or cause\n           two or more other persons to have sexual contact when any\n           of the following applies:\n\n       (1) The offender purposely compels the other person, or one of\n           the other persons, to submit by force or threat of force.\n\n       {¶46} “Force,” for the purposes of GSI, is defined in R.C. 2901.01, as “any\n\nviolence, compulsion, or constraint physically exerted by any means upon or\n\nagainst a person or thing.” In order to prove force, the State “need not prove\n\nphysical resistance to the offender” in prosecutions for GSI. R.C. 2907.05(D).\n\n       {¶47} The Ohio Supreme Court has addressed the issue of “force” or\n\n“threat of force” in multiple cases. In State v. Eskridge, 38 Ohio St.3d 56 (1988),\n\nthe Ohio Supreme Court held,\n\n       [t]he force and violence necessary to commit the crime of rape\n       depends upon the age, size and strength of the parties and their\n       relation to each other. With the filial obligation of obedience to\n       a parent, the same degree of force and violence may not be\n\n                                         -22-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\n       required upon a person of tender years, as would be required\n       were the parties more nearly equal in age, size and strength.\n\n\nEskridge, at paragraph one of the syllabus citing State v. Labus, 102 Ohio St. 26,\n\n38–39, (1921).\n\n\n       {¶48} The Court in Eskridge continued, stating that given the “coercion\n\ninherent in parental authority” when a parent abuses his or her child, the requisite\n\nforce “‘need not be overt and physically brutal, but can be subtle and\n\npsychological. As long as it can be shown that the * * * victim’s will was\n\novercome by fear or duress, the forcible element * * * can be established.’”\n\n(Emphasis added.) Id. at 58–59, quoting State v. Fowler, 27 Ohio App.3d 149,\n\n154, (8th Dist.1985).\n\n       {¶49} In State v. Dye, 82 Ohio St.3d 323 (1998), the Ohio Supreme Court\n\nfurther held that the lesser showing of force principles established in Eskridge also\n\napplied to situations where a parent-child relationship was absent, but the adult\n\ndefendant stood in a position of authority over the child-victim. State v. Dew, 7th\n\nDist. Mahoning No. 08 MA 62, 2009-Ohio-6537, ¶ 106, citing Dye at 55. In such\n\na case, the Court found that force or threat of force could be met “without\n\nevidence of express threat of harm or evidence of significant physical restraint.”\n\nId.\n\n\n\n                                        -23-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\n      {¶50} In interpreting this line of Ohio Supreme Court cases, and the\n\nappellate cases following them, the Seventh District Court of Appeals held in State\n\nv. Dew, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 08 MA 62, 2009-Ohio-6537, that force, for the\n\npurposes of Rape and GSI, is\n\n      “a relative term that depends on the totality of the circumstances\n      in a certain case.” State v. Rupp, 7th Dist. No. 05MA166, 2007–\n      Ohio–1561, at ¶ 49. Although the case law holds that a somewhat\n      lesser showing of force is required when the defendant stands in\n      a position of authority over the victim, the focus of the inquiry is\n      whether the victim's will was overcome by fear or duress. See, e.g.,\n      Eskridge at 58–59, 526 N.E.2d 304.\n\n(Emphasis added.) Dew at ¶ 111.\n\n      {¶51} The Ohio Supreme Court has held that\n\n      “in determining whether a course of conduct results in duress,\n      the question is not what effect such conduct would have upon an\n      ordinary man but rather the effect upon the particular person\n      toward whom such conduct is directed, and in determining such\n      effect the age, sex, health and mental condition of the person\n      affected, the relationship of the parties and all the surrounding\n      circumstances may be considered.”\n\nState v. Getsy, 84 Ohio St.3d 180, 206 (1998), quoting Tallmadge v. Robinson,\n\n158 Ohio St. 333 (1952).\n\n      {¶52} With these standards in mind, we turn to the evidence presented\n\nregarding each of the GSI convictions.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -24-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\nGSI of C.K. (Count 4)\n\n        {¶53} Stober was convicted of one count of GSI with respect to C.K. At\n\ntrial, testimony was presented that C.K. was a student at Kalida wherein Stober\n\nwas a teacher and the technology coordinator.                       Although C.K. did not play\n\nvolleyball for Stober and did not take any of Stober’s classes, Stober did provide\n\npresentations to C.K. and her classmates in the classroom. Stober also implied\n\nthrough his testimony at trial that he viewed his relationship with C.K. as a\n\nteacher-student relationship.\n\n        Q: So again, you’re being a good person in trying to help out a\n        student [C.K.]?\n\n        A:     That’s what teachers do.\n\n(Tr. at 1343). This evidence would establish that Stober was, in fact, an authority\n\nfigure to C.K.\n\n        {¶54} Regarding the incident that led to this specific charge, C.K. testified\n\nthat at the end of her junior year of high school, she had to print an assignment\n\nwhile in school.8 (Tr. at 592). She testified that she tried to print the assignment\n\non the “art computer” but was unable to do so. (Id.) C.K. then attempted to print\n\n\n8\n  We would note that there was initially a discrepancy in C.K.’s testimony as to the timeframe when this\nincident happened. C.K. initially testified it was after June 2010, which would have been in her senior year\nof high school. However, later on cross-examination, C.K. corrected her earlier statement, clarifying\nmultiple times consistently that it was the end of her junior year of high school, prior to June 2010.\nUltimately, at the close of evidence, the State moved to amend Count 4 of the Indictment to include dates\nback to March, 2010, which would have covered the end of C.K.’s junior year, and comported with her\ntestimony. (Tr. at 1380). That amendment was granted. (Id.)\n\n                                                   -25-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\nthe assignment in the library, and was again unable to do so. (Id.) The art teacher\n\nthen directed C.K. to go to Stober to see if he could figure it out. (Id. at 593).\n\n       {¶55} C.K. testified that she went into Stober’s office, opened up the file\n\nand attempted to print it. (Tr. at 594). She testified that it was just the two of\n\nthem in Stober’s office at the time, and that when she “stood up and turned\n\naround, he then grabbed [her] hand and put it on his penis.” (Tr. at 594). C.K.\n\ntestified that it was not voluntary, it happened quickly, and that she pulled her\n\nhand away. (Tr. at 566).\n\n       {¶56} The action described by C.K. has been found to be sufficient to\n\nsupport a GSI conviction. In State v. Steele, 5th Dist. No. 2011-CA-110, 2012-\n\nOhio-3777, the Fifth District Court of appeals held that testimony of a victim that\n\na defendant “grabbed her hand and pulled it over to his penis” constituted\n\nsufficient evidence for a reasonable person to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt\n\nthat a GSI had been committed. Steele at ¶¶ 53-56.\n\n       {¶57} Nevertheless, this is not the only incident mentioned in C.K.’s\n\ntestimony leading to the filing of Count 4 in the indictment. C.K. also testified\n\nthat on the day her senior class photo was taken, she was again alone with Stober\n\nin Stober’s office and he “grabbed [her] butt.” (Tr. at 565). C.K. testified that\n\nwhen Stober “grabbed [her] butt,” he was “[m]oaning and grumbling like he liked\n\nit.” (Tr. at 546).\n\n                                         -26-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\n       {¶58} C.K. testified at one point that Stober told her “not to tell anyone.”\n\n(Tr. at 567). However, it is unclear from the transcript whether this was in\n\nreference to the sexual text messages, the incidents leading to the GSI charge, the\n\nincident leading to the sexual battery charge, or in reference to a specific line of\n\nquestioning wherein C.K. testified that Stober sent her messages that he\n\nmasturbated in the bathroom while thinking of her. (Tr. at 566-567).\n\n       {¶59} C.K. testified that in her senior year she told her guidance counselor\n\nthat Stober was sending her text messages, but not the content of the messages.\n\n(Tr. at 559). She also testified that she told a man named Jeff Burke, who she\n\nlooked at like a “father figure” about the fact that Stober was sending her text\n\nmessages.       (Tr. at 558).   C.K. told Burke that the messages made her\n\nuncomfortable. (Id.)\n\n       {¶60} Burke testified that in the spring of C.K.’s junior year, C.K. confided\n\nin him that she was getting text messages and candy from Stober. (Tr. at 670).\n\nBurke testified that C.K. “didn’t appreciate” receiving the messages from Stober.\n\n(Id. at 671). He testified, however, that C.K. asked him to keep it confidential, so\n\nhe did. (Id.)\n\n       {¶61} C.K. testified that she did not report the sexual contact initially,\n\n“[b]ecause after I had told the guidance counselor that [Stober] was texting me,\n\nnothing, it wasn’t investigated, nothing was done about it, so I thought that nobody\n\n                                       -27-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\nreally cared.” (Tr. at 604). C.K. also testified that later, when being interviewed\n\nby the police, she was reluctant to disclose everything because she believed people\n\nwould blame her. (Tr. at 647). She also testified that she told investigating\n\nofficers that she felt she should have said no because she knew better. (Tr. at\n\n647).\n\n        {¶62} Based on the testimony and the totality of the circumstances, we find\n\nthat there was sufficient evidence to convict Stober of GSI of C.K. Force was\n\npresent during the incident where Stober caused C.K. to touch his penis. In\n\naddition, there was evidence presented from which a jury could reasonably\n\nconclude that C.K. was under a measure of duress, or compulsion, preventing her\n\nfrom revealing these incidents or resisting them, all of which is sufficient to allow\n\na jury to reasonably infer the presence of force as outlined above where the\n\nperpetrator is an authority figure.\n\nGSIs of H.Z. (Counts 6 and 7)\n\n        {¶63} Stober was convicted of two counts of GSI of victim H.Z. H.Z. was\n\na student in Stober’s classes, she played on Stober’s volleyball team from her\n\nsophomore through her senior year of high school, and she was also Stober’s\n\nneighbor. In addition, Stober testified that he played a father-figure role with H.Z.\n\n(Tr. at 1264-1265).\n\n\n\n                                        -28-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\n      {¶64} As stated above, Stober began sending H.Z. text messages as early as\n\nher seventh grade year, but the messages were originally about volleyball and did\n\nnot turn “sexual” in nature until her sophomore year. H.Z. testified that the\n\nmessages, including the sexual messages, continued into her junior and senior\n\nyears of high school.    H.Z. testified that she was struggling with emotional\n\nproblems, an eating disorder, depression, and suicidal thoughts. H.Z. testified that\n\nshe confided this to Stober. (Tr. at 778). H.Z. testified that occasionally her\n\nconversations with Stober concerned her eating disorder. (Id. at 780).\n\n      {¶65} H.Z. testified that she worked as an office aide in the high school\n\nalong with Carol Kahle, and Nancy Grote, who were high school secretaries. (Tr.\n\nat 779). H.Z. testified that Stober would often call her down to his office in the\n\nschool. (Tr. at 779). Nancy Grote testified that when Stober would call H.Z.\n\ndown to his office, her demeanor would change. (Tr. at 719-720). Grote testified\n\nthat prior to being called down to Stober’s office, H.Z. would be “chatty” and\n\n“happy.” (Tr. at 720). Grote testified that when H.Z. returned from going to\n\nStober’s office, she would be “quieter” and in one instance, “put her head down.”\n\n(Id.) Grote testified that it bothered her and Kahle, the other secretary. (Id.)\n\nGrote testified that after making these observations, she made an attempt to help\n\nH.Z. avoid going down to Stober’s office. (Tr. at 721). Grote testified that she\n\nwould send H.Z. on errands so that she did not have to go down to Stober’s office.\n\n                                       -29-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\n(Id.) Grote testified that, especially once volleyball season was over, H.Z. did not\n\nneed to go down to Stober’s office, yet H.Z. would state that she had to go, so she\n\nwould go. (Tr. at 721). These facts, along with Stober’s position as teacher and\n\ncoach of H.Z., and Stober’s comments about being a father figure to H.Z., are\n\nsufficient to support Stober being an authority figure to H.Z.\n\n       {¶66} H.Z. testified that the first incident leading to a GSI charge in the\n\nindictment occurred in the summer after her junior year, in June of 2011.\n\nRegarding this incident, H.Z. testified as follows.\n\n       That was when I had a volleyball camp form that was to be\n       turned in, and it was turned in late, and I had to go over to his\n       house to bring it to him; and I was getting ready to go over to a\n       friend’s house to go lay out and tan, so I had a swim suit on and\n       silky shorts and a cutoff.\n\n       And he came up to my window to get it, and he was also in his\n       swimsuit. I rolled my window down, and he – I held the paper\n       out; but he kind of reached in like acting as if the paper was in\n       there, and he grabbed my breast.\n\n       ***\n\n       Q: Did you stay at the residence or the driveway?\n\n       A: Until like he took his hand away and he kind of said, oops,\n       acting like he didn’t mean to do it, but I knew that he actually\n       did intend to. And then I just proceeded to say, all right, I’ve\n       got to go, I’m going to Jill’s house, and I left.\n\n(Tr. at 773-774). H.Z. testified that later that day she received text messages from\n\nStober wherein Stober stated he wished that H.Z. “would have came back and\n\n                                        -30-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\nskipped going to Jill’s house.” (Tr. at 774). Stober informed H.Z. that no one was\n\nhome at his residence at the time. (Id. at 775).\n\n       {¶67} Regarding the second incident leading to a GSI charge in the\n\nindictment, H.Z. testified that her senior year the text messages from Stober were\n\nmore sexual than ever. H.Z. testified to the following incident during the fall of\n\nher senior year, during volleyball season. (Tr. at 781).\n\n       He would always text me saying, prove to me that you’re fat.\n       One time I stood on a scale, sent a picture of the weight on the\n       scale to him. That wasn’t good enough. I went down to his\n       office one day, and he proceeded to ask me to lift my shirt up so\n       that he could see my stomach. And then he reached out and\n       grabbed it and touched it and moved his hand down to my\n       bottom and kind of laughed it off like it was no big deal.\n\n(Tr. at 780). H.Z. testified that she did not think it was innocent. (Id.)\n\n       {¶68} H.Z. testified that volleyball was a positive thing in her life, and she\n\nthought if she told her parents about Stober’s actions her sophomore, junior, or\n\nsenior years they would not have let her play volleyball. (Tr. at 789). H.Z.\n\ntestified that volleyball was worth it to her to not jeopardize by disclosing Stober’s\n\nactions. (Id.)\n\n       {¶69} In addition, H.Z. testified that she had other reservations about\n\ninitially disclosing the text messages and the physical contact from the incidents.\n\nShe testified,\n\n\n\n                                         -31-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\n       Two main [reasons] that come to my head would be that I would\n       have been benched on the court or that he would have played\n       one of his mind games with me like trying to get into my head\n       and then, you know, I would have a bad game so he would have\n       a reason to bench me.\n\n       Also, I, I hate being a person who would cause any problems in\n       someone else’s family if I did not have to, and I did not want that\n       to happen between him and his family and to have his kids have\n       to suffer going through a divorce, two parents going, you know,\n       where the dad – especially since I was in school and his oldest\n       son was also in school, like same school that I was. I would have\n       felt terrible if I would have been the person to break up his\n       parents.\n\n(Tr. at 789-790).\n\n       {¶70} In sum, Stober was an authority figure as teacher and as a coach of\n\nH.Z. in volleyball. Stober’s authority as H.Z.’s coach was part of the reason H.Z.\n\ntestified that she was unable to resist or report Stober’s actions earlier than she did.\n\nH.Z. also suffered from mental/emotional issues, and Stober was aware of and\n\ntook advantage of these conditions. Stober’s degree of control over H.Z was such\n\nthat she felt compelled to show up when Stober messaged her to report to his\n\noffice, as corroborated by the testimony from the secretaries that H.Z. did not want\n\nto go, and that going to Stober’s office clearly affected her mental state and\n\ndemeanor. In addition, like C.K., it is apparent that H.Z. feared revealing or\n\nresisting these incidents for multiple reasons. All of this evidence was clearly\n\n\n\n\n                                         -32-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\nsufficient to establish duress and compulsion in the context of an authority figure,\n\nwhich augments the physical force used to commit the GSIs against H.Z.\n\n       {¶71} Based on the entirety of the evidence and the totality of the\n\ncircumstances, we find that there was sufficient evidence in this case for the jury\n\nto find beyond a reasonable doubt that Stober committed GSIs as alleged in\n\nCounts 6, and 7. Accordingly, Stober’s first assignment of error is overruled.\n\n                              Second Assignment of Error\n\n       {¶72} In Stober’s second assignment of error, he argues that the trial court\n\nerred when it instructed the jury on “a lesser showing of force” that applies in a\n\ncoach/teacher relationship.\n\n       {¶73} At the outset, we would note that no objection was raised at the trial\n\non this issue, therefore, Stober has waived all but plain error. State v. Bustamante,\n\n3d Dist. Seneca No. 13-12-26, 2013-Ohio-4975, ¶ 15. In order to have plain error\n\nunder Crim.R. 52(B) there must be an error, the error must be an “obvious” defect\n\nin the trial proceedings, and the error must have affected “substantial rights.” State\n\nv. Barnes, 94 Ohio St.3d 21, 27 (2002). Plain error is to be used “‘with the utmost\n\ncaution, under exceptional circumstances and only to prevent a manifest\n\nmiscarriage of justice.’” Id. quoting State v. Long, 53 Ohio St.2d 91 (1978),\n\nparagraph three of the syllabus.\n\n       {¶74} In this case, the trial court gave the following instruction on “Force.”\n\n                                         -33-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\n          Force means any violence, compulsion, or constraint physically\n          exerted by any means upon or against a person or thing.\n\n          When the relationship between the victim and the Defendant is\n          one of child and coach, or teacher, the element of force need not\n          be openly displayed or physically brutal. It can be slight or\n          psychological. Evidence of an expressed threat of harm, or\n          evidence of significant physical restraint is not required. If you\n          find that beyond a reasonable doubt that under the\n          circumstances in evidence, the victim’s will was overcome by\n          fear or duress, the element of force has been proved.\n\n(Tr. at 1455).\n\n          {¶75} Despite Stober’s arguments, the trial court’s jury instructions were\n\ntaken directly from the Ohio Jury Instructions and adequately reflect the law as\n\nsummarized in the preceding assignment of error regarding “force” when an\n\nauthority figure is present. Therefore, we cannot find error, let alone plain error.\n\nAccordingly, Stober’s assignment of error is overruled.\n\n                              Third Assignment of Error\n\n          {¶76} In Stober’s third assignment of error, he argues that Stober’s\n\nconvictions for Sexual Battery and GSI concerning C.K. were against the manifest\n\nweight of the evidence.        Specifically, Stober argues that C.K.’s testimony\n\nregarding the Sexual Battery and GSI incidents was vague and unbelievable, and\n\nthat given C.K.’s age at the time of the offense, she would have remembered more\n\ndetail.\n\n\n\n                                         -34-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\n       {¶77} The Ohio Supreme Court has “carefully distinguished the terms\n\n‘sufficiency’ and ‘weight’ in criminal cases, declaring that ‘manifest weight’ and\n\n‘legal sufficiency’ are ‘both quantitatively and qualitatively different.’” Eastley v.\n\nVolkman, 132 Ohio St.3d 328, 2012–Ohio–2179, ¶ 10, quoting State v. Thompkins,\n\n78 Ohio St.3d 380 (1997), paragraph two of the syllabus.\n\n       {¶78} Unlike our review of the sufficiency of the evidence, an appellate\n\ncourt's function when reviewing the weight of the evidence is to determine\n\nwhether the greater amount of credible evidence supports the verdict. Volkman,\n\nsupra, at ¶ 12; Thompkins, supra, at 387. In reviewing whether the trial court's\n\njudgment was against the weight of the evidence, the appellate court sits as a\n\n“thirteenth juror” and examines the conflicting testimony. Thompkins at 387. In\n\ndoing so, this Court must review the entire record, weigh the evidence and all of\n\nthe reasonable inferences, consider the credibility of witnesses, and determine\n\nwhether in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the factfinder “clearly lost its way\n\nand created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be\n\nreversed and a new trial ordered.” Thompkins at 387.\n\n       {¶79} Stober argues that his convictions for Sexual Battery and GSI of\n\nvictim C.K. were against the manifest weight of the evidence. GSI in violation of\n\nR.C. 2907.05(A)(1) has been defined previously. Sexual Battery is defined in\n\nR.C. 2907.03, and reads, in pertinent part, as follows.\n\n                                        -35-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\n      (A) No person shall engage in sexual conduct with another, not\n          the spouse of the offender, when any of the following apply:\n\n       ***\n\n       (7) The offender is a teacher, administrator, coach, or other\n       person in authority employed by or serving in a school for which\n       the state board of education prescribes minimum standards\n       pursuant to division (D) of section 3301.07 of the Revised Code,\n       the other person is enrolled in or attends that school, and the\n       offender is not enrolled in and does not attend that school.\n\nSexual Battery\n\n       {¶80} In this case, Stober contends that C.K. was 20 years old at the time of\n\ntrial and “[y]et, her testimony was vague and incredible in regard to salient details\n\nthat persons exposed to sexual acts would know.” (Appt.’s Br. 14).\n\n       {¶81} At trial, C.K. testified that approximately a week before the alleged\n\nsexual intercourse took place, Stober began asking C.K. about her parents’\n\nschedule. (Tr. at 547). According to C.K., her father, who she lived with, worked\n\nthird shift. (Tr. at 548). C.K. testified that in June of 2010, “about a week” after\n\nshe had given Stober her father’s work schedule, Stober showed up at her\n\nresidence at approximately 4 a.m. (Tr. at 550).\n\n       {¶82} C.K. testified she was sleeping on her living room couch and was\n\nawakened by knocking at the door. (Tr. at 550). She testified that she went to the\n\ndoor, and looked outside, and saw Stober “standing in the corner [of her porch]\n\nwith his bike.” (Tr. at 551). C.K. testified that Stober was wearing a “T-shirt and\n\n                                        -36-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\nshorts.” (Tr. at 551). C.K. later clarified on cross-examination that Stober was\n\nwearing “khaki or jean” shorts because they were not “mesh soft shorts” and that\n\nhis shorts had a “Zipper and snap/button.” (Tr. at 601).\n\n       {¶83} C.K. testified that, “I opened the door, and I peeked my head around\n\nthe corner; and I seen him, and I froze. And he had stepped forward into the\n\nhouse, pushing me backwards down onto the couch. Then he started feeling up\n\nmy shirt and down my shorts, was kissing me. Proceeded to take my shorts off,\n\nstuck his fingers inside me and then his penis.” (Tr. at 551-552).\n\n       {¶84} C.K. clarified on cross-examination that when she said that Stober\n\npushed her backwards she meant pushing “as in a way of forcing, I guess, without\n\ntouching me. He was close to me, backing me, walking towards me, and I’m\n\nbacking up backwards.” (Tr. at 607-608). C.K. testified that “[Stober] pretty\n\nmuch pinned [her] until [she] * * * was down on the couch.” (Tr. at 608). C.K.\n\ntestified that because Stober had backed her up so she “couldn’t do anything” she\n\nfelt as though Stober had pushed her. (Tr. at 609). C.K. testified that she was “too\n\nscared” to tell Stober “no.” (Tr. at 552).\n\n       {¶85} C.K. also testified that she tried “[s]cooting out from under” Stober,\n\nbut that she did not push him away forcefully. (Tr. at 627). C.K. further testified\n\nthat though she did not forcefully try to get up, “in [her] head [she] * * * wanted to\n\n\n\n                                         -37-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\nget up.” (Tr. at 627). C.K. testified that after Stober was finished he pulled up his\n\nshorts and walked out of the door, without any conversation. (Tr. at 553).\n\n       {¶86} Of this incident, Stober simply testified that he did not have sex with\n\nC.K., and that he had never been to C.K.’s father’s residence.\n\n       {¶87} On appeal, Stober argues that C.K.’s testimony regarding the\n\nincident of sexual intercourse leading to the Sexual Battery conviction was not\n\ncredible because C.K. “could not remember” whether Stober wore a condom, or\n\nwhether Stober ejaculated inside her. Stober also contends that C.K.’s claim that\n\nno words were spoken at the time of the incident was not credible.\n\n       {¶88} Despite Stober’s characterizations on appeal, C.K. specifically\n\ntestified that Stober “did not” wear a condom and she knew because Stober “didn’t\n\nput anything on.” (Tr. at 553). She also testified that she “assume[d]” Stober\n\nejaculated inside of her. (Tr. at 553). C.K. testified specifically that she had “tried\n\nblocking that day out [of her memory] as much as [she] can.” (Tr. at 632).\n\nNevertheless, C.K. gave testimony that was consistent on direct and cross-\n\nexamination regarding this incident. In addition, the jury was fully able to see and\n\nhear her testimony, as well as Stober’s denial of the incident, and weigh the\n\ncredibility of these witnesses. The jury was free to find Stober’s denials to be\n\ndisingenuous, and/or otherwise evaluate Stober’s testimony. Under these facts and\n\ncircumstances, we cannot find that the jury clearly lost its way on this issue.\n\n                                         -38-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\nGSI\n\n       {¶89} Stober also argues that his conviction for GSI related to C.K. was\n\nagainst the manifest weight of the evidence. Stober argues that because C.K.\n\ncould not remember whether Stober’s penis was erect, her testimony was not\n\ncredible. However, C.K. testified that her back was turned when Stober pulled out\n\nhis penis. (Tr. at 595). C.K. testified that when she turned back toward Stober,\n\nStober grabbed her hand and put it on his penis. (Tr. at 595). C.K. testified that\n\nshe jerked her hand away, grabbed her “thumb drive” and walked out. (Tr. at\n\n595). C.K. also testified to the incident wherein Stober “grabbed” her butt and\n\nmoaned while doing so.\n\n       {¶90} In contravention of C.K.’s testimony, Stober claimed that the\n\nincidents did not happen. (Tr. at 1289).\n\n       {¶91} The GSI conviction turned on the credibility of C.K.’s testimony and\n\nthe credibility of Stober’s denial at trial. The jury was in a far better position to\n\nmake a credibility determination on these issues than the appellate court is, and we\n\ncannot find that under these circumstances, the jury clearly lost its way or that\n\nthere was a “manifest miscarriage of justice.”         Accordingly, Stober’s third\n\nassignment of error is overruled.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -39-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\n                                Fourth Assignment of Error\n\n       {¶92} In Stober’s fourth assignment of error, he argues that the trial court\n\nerred in denying Stober’s motion to sever the counts against the various alleged\n\nvictims into separate trials.\n\n       {¶93} The joinder of offenses is governed by Crim.R. 8(A) which provides:\n\n       Two or more offenses may be charged in the same indictment * *\n       * if the offenses charged * * * are of the same or similar\n       character, or are based on the same act or transaction, or are\n       based on two or more acts or transactions connected together or\n       constituting parts of a common scheme or plan, or are part of a\n       course of criminal conduct.\n\n       {¶94} “‘It is well-established that the law favors joinder because the\n\navoidance of multiple trials conserves time and expense and minimizes the\n\npotentially incongruous outcomes that can result from successive trials before\n\ndifferent juries.’” State v. Howard, 2d Dist. Greene No. 2012-CA-39, 2013-Ohio-\n\n2343, ¶ 35, quoting State v. Glass, 2d Dist. Greene No. 2000-CA-74, 2001 WL\n\n228453, *2 (Mar. 9, 2001), citing State v. Schiebel, 55 Ohio St.3d 71, 86–87\n\n(1990). (Other citations omitted.).\n\n       {¶95} A defendant can move to sever joined offenses pursuant to\n\nCrim.R.14, which states that, “If it appears that a defendant * * * is prejudiced by\n\na joinder of offenses * * * the court shall order an election or separate trial of\n\n\n\n\n                                           -40-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\ncounts, grant a severance of defendants or provide such other relief as justice\n\nrequires.”\n\n       {¶96} “The defendant claiming error in the trial court’s refusal to sever\n\nmultiple charges has the burden of affirmatively showing that his rights were\n\nprejudiced.” (Citations omitted.)    State v. Skatzes, 2d Dist. Montgomery No.\n\n15848, 2003–Ohio–516, ¶ 147. “To affirmatively show that his rights have been\n\nprejudiced, the defendant ‘must furnish the trial court with sufficient information\n\nso that it can weigh the considerations favoring joinder against the defendant's\n\nright to a fair trial, and [the defendant] must demonstrate that the court abused its\n\ndiscretion in refusing to separate the charges for trial.’” Glass, supra, at *3–4,\n\nquoting State v. Lott, 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 163 (1990). (Other citation omitted.)\n\n       {¶97} “When a defendant claims that he was prejudiced by the joinder of\n\nmultiple offenses, a court must determine (1) whether evidence of the other crimes\n\nwould be admissible even if the counts were severed, and (2) if not, whether the\n\nevidence of each crime is simple and distinct.” State v. Thomas, 3d Dist. Allen\n\nNo. 1-11-25, 2012-Ohio-5577, ¶ 21 citing State v. Schaim, 65 Ohio St.3d 51, 59\n\n(1992). If the evidence of other crimes would be admissible at separate trials, any\n\n“prejudice that might result from the jury's hearing the evidence of the other crime\n\nin a joint trial would be no different from that possible in separate trials,” and a\n\n\n\n                                        -41-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\ncourt need not inquire further. Id, quoting Drew v. United States, 331 F.2d 85, 90\n\n(1964).\n\n      {¶98} Moreover, “a defendant is not prejudiced by joinder where the joined\n\noffenses are ‘simple and direct, so that a jury is capable of segregating the proof\n\nrequired for each offense.’” State v. Wilson, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 20910,\n\n2005–Ohio–6666, ¶ 38, quoting State v. Fletcher, 2d Dist. Clark No. 2003–CA–\n\n62, 2004–Ohio–4517, ¶ 41.\n\n      {¶99} We review a trial court’s decision on joinder of offenses for trial\n\nunder an abuse of discretion standard. State v. Banks, 10th Dist. Franklin No.\n\n09AP–1087, 2010–Ohio–5714, ¶ 30, citing State v. LaMar, 95 Ohio St.3d 181,\n\n767 N.E.2d 166, 2002–Ohio–2128. “The term ‘abuse of discretion’ connotes more\n\nthan a mere error in law or judgment; it implies that the court’s attitude was\n\nunreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.” Id., quoting State v. Adams, 62 Ohio\n\nSt.2d 151, 157 (1980).\n\n      {¶100} In this case, Stober made a motion for relief from prejudicial\n\njoinder prior to trial, and this motion was denied. Stober renewed his motion at\n\ntrial multiple times, and was denied each time.\n\n      {¶101} The jury in this case acquitted Stober of multiple counts, including\n\ncounts related to separate victims. The jury acquitted Stober of his only charge\n\nagainst J.L., acquitted Stober of the charge of Attempted Sexual Battery against\n\n                                       -42-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\nH.Z., and then also acquitted Stober of the charge of Tampering with Evidence. In\n\nthe Tampering with Evidence charge, it was alleged as part of the crime that\n\nStober instructed C.K. and H.Z. to delete text messages. Thus Stober was, in\n\neffect, acquitted of some accusations related to each alleged victim, showing that\n\nthe evidence was simple and direct and that the jury was able to segregate proof\n\nfor each offense. Under these circumstances, we fail to see how Stober is able to\n\nestablish any prejudice considering the jury was clearly able to discern the\n\nseparate crimes and did not appear to be biased by the testimony from the other\n\nincidents.\n\n       {¶102} Moreover, the testimony of the other victims could have been\n\nadmissible in each other’s trials under Evid.R. 404(B) to show motive, intent,\n\nplan, or scheme. As the evidence could have been admissible in separate trials, we\n\nagain cannot find that the trial court erred.\n\n       {¶103} Accordingly, Stober’s fourth assignment of error is overruled.\n\n\n                              Fifth Assignment of Error\n\n       {¶104} In Stober’s fifth assignment of error, he argues that the trial court\n\nimproperly allowed witnesses to testify in contravention of Evid.R. 404(B).\n\nSpecifically, Stober argues that the trial court improperly allowed the testimony of\n\nfive witnesses in this case. Stober contends that these witnesses of the State\n\n\n                                          -43-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\ntestified to “bad acts” testimony that violated both Evid.R. 404(B) and the Rape\n\nShield Statute.\n\n       {¶105} Evid.R. 404(B), reads as follows.\n\n       Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to\n       prove the character of a person in order to show action in\n       conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other\n       purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent,\n       preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or\n       accident. In criminal cases, the proponent of evidence to be\n       offered under this rule shall provide reasonable notice in\n       advance of trial, or during trial if the court excuses pretrial\n       notice on good cause shown, of the general nature of any such\n       evidence it intends to introduce at trial.\n\n       {¶106} “Generally, the prosecution in a criminal case may not present\n\nevidence that the defendant has committed other crimes or acts independent of the\n\ncrime for which the defendant is being tried to establish that the defendant acted in\n\nconformity with his bad character.” State v. Thomas, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-\n\n120561, 2013-Ohio-5386, ¶ 20, citing Evid.R. 404(B); State v. Brown, 1st Dist.\n\nHamilton No. C–120327, 2013–Ohio–2720, ¶ 26.             However, Evid.R. 404(B)\n\nprovides that other bad acts are admissible to show “motive, opportunity, intent,\n\npreparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.” State v.\n\nShedrick, 61 Ohio St.3d 331, 337 (1991); Brown at ¶ 26. This list is non-\n\nexclusive. State v. Morris, 132 Ohio St.3d 337, 2012–Ohio–2407, ¶ 18.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -44-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\n       {¶107} The Ohio Supreme Court held in State v. Williams, 134 Ohio St.3d\n\n521, 526, 2012–Ohio–5695, that the admission of other acts evidence is a three-\n\nstep process.       Williams, at ¶ 22; State v. Guerra, 9th Dist. Lorain No.\n\n12CA010188, 2013-Ohio-5367, ¶ 17.\n\n       The first step is to consider whether the other acts evidence is\n       relevant to making any fact that is of consequence to the\n       determination of the action more or less probable than it would\n       be without the evidence. Evid.R. 401. The next step is to consider\n       whether evidence of the other crimes, wrongs, or acts is\n       presented to prove the character of the accused in order to show\n       activity in conformity therewith or whether the other acts\n       evidence is presented for a legitimate purpose, such as those\n       stated in Evid.R. 404(B). The third step is to consider whether\n       the probative value of the other acts evidence is substantially\n       outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\n\nWilliams at ¶ 20.\n\n       {¶108} “Evidentiary rulings at trial are reviewed on appeal for an abuse of\n\ndiscretion.” State v. Altman, 7th Dist. Columbiana No. 12 CO 42, 2013-Ohio-\n\n5883, ¶ 22, citing State v. Beshara, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 07 MA 37, 2009–\n\nOhio–6529, ¶ 55, citing State v. Bey, 85 Ohio St.3d 487, 490 (1999). However, at\n\ntrial Stober did not object to any of these witnesses, and has waived the issue on\n\nappeal absent plain error. Crim.R. 52(B).\n\n       {¶109} In addition, we would note that under the invited error doctrine, “a\n\nparty is not entitled to take advantage of an error that he himself invited or\n\n\n\n                                       -45-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\ninduced.” State ex rel. Kline v. Carroll, 96 Ohio St.3d 404, 2002-Ohio-4849; State\n\nv. Smith, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 79936, 2002-Ohio-3114, at ¶ 30.\n\n        {¶110} On appeal, Stober argues that the testimony of five of the State’s\n\nwitnesses was inadmissible at trial under Evid.R. 404(B). We will address each in\n\nturn.\n\nLori Fisher\n\n        {¶111} First, Stober argues that Lori Fisher’s testimony was impermissible\n\nunder 404(B) and the Rape Shield Statute.         Stober contends that Fisher’s\n\ntestimony did not concern evidence of pregnancy, semen, or disease and therefore\n\nwas not permissible.\n\n        {¶112} Fisher testified that she was a teacher at Kalida, and on cross-\n\nexamination she testified that she had been having an ongoing affair with Stober\n\nfor over a decade. The State elicited testimony from Fisher about text messages\n\nthat she exchanged with Stober, which were within minutes of text messages\n\nStober exchanged with H.Z. and C.K. The State offered this evidence to show that\n\nit must have been Stober that was in possession of his phone at the time these\n\nmessages were sent.\n\n        {¶113} In addition, Fisher offered testimony that Stober had told her he\n\ncould no longer have children, which was similar to a message C.K. said she had\n\nreceived from Stober. (Tr. at 675).\n\n                                       -46-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\n         {¶114} Prior to Fisher’s testimony, Stober’s counsel specifically stated that\n\nhe did not intend to object to Fisher as a 404(B) witness. On cross-examination,\n\nStober’s counsel drew out the fact that Fisher thought Stober was a good listener,\n\nthat he was caring, and that she made the first advance on him. (Tr. at 690).\n\nFisher also testified on cross, when prompted by Stober’s attorney, that Stober was\n\nalways “worried about his ability to please. [Stober] made references that he\n\nwould like to have been able to take a male enhancement pill, but didn’t know\n\nhow he could take it without his wife finding out.” (Tr. at 692). Stober’s counsel\n\nused this testimony to contradict the testimony of H.Z. and C.K. C.K. testified she\n\nreceived a text message from Stober wherein Stober stated “he would be so big he\n\nwould tear [C.K.] up.” (Tr. at 545). H.Z. later testified that she received a\n\nmessage from Stober wherein Stober stated “he was so big he could tear [her].”\n\n(Tr. at 791).\n\n         {¶115} Moreover, it became clear later when Stober took the stand and\n\ntestified that he had made the “masturbation” video for Fisher, that Stober’s\n\ncounsel brought in the information regarding their affair to attempt to support that\n\nclaim.\n\n         {¶116} Thus not only did the State have legitimate purposes for calling\n\nFisher, but Stober’s counsel had legitimate reasons for wanting her testimony to be\n\n\n\n                                         -47-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\nentered into evidence. Under these circumstances, we cannot find that there was\n\nany error, let alone plain error in allowing her testimony.\n\n\n\nJenna Missler\n\n       {¶117} Stober next argues that the testimony of Jenna Missler was\n\nimproper under Evid.R. 404(B). Stober argues that Missler was an adult teacher,\n\nand not a student, and thus her testimony was unrelated to the testimony of the\n\nyounger, student victims.\n\n       {¶118} Missler gave testimony that she was a Spanish teacher at Kalida and\n\nthat she received instant messages from Stober. (Tr. at 484). Missler testified that\n\nthe messages began about work, but then became more personal. (Tr. at 484).\n\nThose messages contained Stober’s use of a “smiley face,” which she described as\n\na characteristic of Stober’s messaging.        Missler testified that the comments\n\neventually crossed the line with her and that she spoke to the sexual harassment\n\ncoordinator about the messages Stober had sent her. The messages were entered\n\ninto evidence as an exhibit. (State’s Ex. 20).\n\n       {¶119} On cross-examination, Stober’s counsel went through the alleged\n\nharassing messages from Stober.       The messages begin by showing Stober as\n\nhelpful, and supportive. (State’s Ex. 20). They also show Stober being helpful to\n\nMissler with her problems at school. (Id.) The messages which Missler stated\n\n                                        -48-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\n“crossed the line” were when Stober said “and may I add your husband must be\n\none lucky man…. :),” and “because you seem to look amazing in just about\n\neverything…. that dress yesterday was extremely nice…. :).”           (Id.)   Stober’s\n\ncounsel made it clear that those messages were the extent of Stober’s\n\n“inappropriate” comments to Missler.        As the remainder of the conversation\n\nbetween Stober and Missler showed Stober being helpful to Missler, this\n\ntestimony furthered Stober’s counsel’s trial strategy of painting the prosecution of\n\nStober as a “witch hunt.”\n\n       {¶120} Missler’s testimony may have had less of a connection to any of the\n\nindicted charges than any of the other non-victim witnesses. Nevertheless, the\n\nState had some legitimate basis for introducing Missler’s testimony, and Stober’s\n\ncounsel also cross-examined Missler in a manner that was consistent with, and\n\neven furthered, his trial strategy.    Accordingly, we cannot find any error in\n\nallowing this testimony. However, even if there was error, trial counsel’s cross-\n\nexamination of Missler certainly minimized any potential claim of prejudice and\n\nwe thus cannot find any reversible error in permitting this witness to testify.\n\nMary Lynn Kahle\n\n       {¶121} Stober next argues that Mary Lynn Kahle’s testimony was\n\nimpermissible under Evid.R. 404(B). Kahle testified that she was a volleyball\n\nplayer for Stober, that Stober added her on ICQ chat, and engaged her in\n\n                                         -49-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\nconversations, which eventually turned personal. (Tr. at 342-343). Stober told\n\nKahle that he could see himself in a relationship with her. (Tr. at 344). On cross-\n\nexamination Stober’s counsel elicited testimony that Stober never tried to\n\nphysically touch Kahle, furthering his argument that the State was conducting a\n\nwitch hunt, and that the State was trying to liken the case to “Jerry Sandusky”\n\nwhen the evidence did not support such a comparison. (Tr. at 353); (Tr. at 292).\n\n       {¶122} Moreover, we must note that this testimony, while remote in time to\n\nthe charges involving victims C.K. and H.Z., carried a much closer proximity and\n\nsimilarity to the indicted charge involving victim J.L. in 2001. As there is some\n\nbasis for allowing the testimony, and it was clearly used and not objected to as part\n\nof Stober’s counsel’s trial strategy, we cannot find that there was error here, let\n\nalone plain error.\n\nKaren Fortman\n\n       {¶123} Stober next contends that the testimony of Karen Fortman was\n\nimpermissible under Evid.R. 404(B). Fortman testified that in 1995 she was a\n\nstudent in Stober’s classes, and that Stober made a “spectacle” out of her.\n\nFortman testified that she then asked to be removed from Stober’s class in the\n\nfuture. Fortman testified that Stober subsequently called her into his office, shut\n\nthe door, and told her that when he looked at her, he saw someone he would like to\n\n\n\n                                        -50-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\nbe married to. On cross-examination, Fortman admitted that there was no sexual\n\ncontact between her and Stober.\n\n       {¶124} The State again argues that this testimony was permissible to show\n\nStober’s motive, intent, scheme, plan, or preparation in using his position in the\n\nschool to target these girls for sexual advances.\n\n       {¶125} Again, while remote in time to the incidents with C.K. and H.Z.,\n\nthere is a similarity in Stober’s approach to all three victims and a proximity in\n\ntime to the charge involving J.L.       As there is some basis for allowing the\n\ntestimony, and it was again clearly used as part of Stober’s counsel’s trial strategy,\n\nwe cannot find that there was error here, let alone plain error.\n\nJ.L.\n\n       {¶126} Lastly, Stober argues that some of J.L.’s testimony was\n\nimpermissible at trial. The testimony Stober finds objectionable is when J.L.\n\ntestified that while working as a substitute, Stober came into her room and asked\n\nJ.L. “weren’t you going to wait for me?” (Tr. at 373).\n\n       {¶127} The State maintains that this testimony was permissible to help\n\nretroactively corroborate and confirm J.L’s allegation that Stober had a “sexual”\n\ninterest in J.L. when he had contact with her as a student several years earlier,\n\nwhich led to the filing of the GSI charge in Count 2. We agree. Thus the State\n\nhad some legitimate basis for introducing this evidence.\n\n                                         -51-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\n       {¶128} Nevertheless, even if the testimony was impermissible, Stober is\n\nunable to establish any prejudice, as Stober was acquitted of the count relating to\n\nJ.L., showing that the jury was not biased by this evidence.\n\n       {¶129} Accordingly, as we have not found any prejudicial error in the\n\ntestimony of these witnesses, Stober’s fifth assignment of error is overruled.\n\n                             Sixth Assignment of Error\n\n       {¶130} In Stober’s sixth assignment of error, he argues that the prosecutor\n\ncommitted misconduct during the trial. Specifically, Stober contends that the\n\nprosecutor repeatedly expressed his opinion that Stober was a liar during closing\n\narguments, that the prosecutor urged jurors to put themselves in the place of the\n\nalleged victims, that the prosecutor sought to evoke sympathy for the victims, that\n\nthe prosecutor elicited testimony as to whether they believed various witnesses,\n\nand that the prosecutor improperly informed the jury on the element of force.\n\n       {¶131} In reviewing claims of prosecutorial misconduct, the test is whether\n\nthe prosecutor's remarks were improper and, if so, whether those comments\n\nprejudicially affected the substantial rights of the defendant. State v. Jones, 90\n\nOhio St.3d 403, 420 (2000). “In making this determination, an appellate court\n\nshould consider several factors: (1) the nature of the remarks, (2) whether an\n\nobjection was made by counsel, (3) whether corrective instructions were given by\n\nthe court, and (4) the strength of the evidence against the defendant.” State v.\n\n                                        -52-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\nBraxton, 102 Ohio App.3d 28, 41 (8th Dist.1995). “The touchstone of analysis ‘is\n\nthe fairness of the trial, not the culpability of the prosecutor.’” Id. (Citation\n\nomitted).\n\n        {¶132} Prosecutorial misconduct is generally not grounds for reversal\n\nunless it so taints the proceedings as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial. State\n\nv. Johns, 3d. Dist. Seneca No. 13-04-23, 13-04-24, 13-04-25, 2005-Ohio-1694, ¶\n\n25. Where it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have found\n\nthe defendant guilty, even absent the alleged misconduct, the defendant has not\n\nbeen prejudiced, and his conviction will not be reversed.

Hand, 107 Ohio St.3d 378, 2006-Ohio-18, at\n\n¶ 16.\n\n                                        -53-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\n      {¶134} In this case, Stober first argues that the prosecutor made improper\n\ncomments that Stober was a “liar.” In closing arguments, the prosecutor made the\n\nfollowing statements that Stober claims were inappropriate.\n\n      And you know the Defendant is a liar, because he took the stand,\n      and he lied to you about half a dozen times. He lied to you about\n      getting the information from Nancy, [J.L.]’s mom. He lied to\n      you about his conversations with Jim McBride, and some\n      concern about an injury. He lied to you about Lori Fisher, and\n      that his intent behind the masturbation video, is that it go to her.\n      And you know he lied to you, because she – she said so. She said,\n      he never said that to me.\n\n      ***\n\n      And he tried to explain text messages and records and give you\n      his thoughts on those. Then he had to acknowledge he wasn’t\n      right at all about that, once I started going through the details of\n      those records with him. And he said to you, yeah, [H.Z] and I\n      texted on November 16th, 2011, because she needed a ride, and it\n      was a last-minute thing, so that’s why I took her and that’s in\n      there. When he made that statement, he didn’t realize that the\n      record was going to be shown to him. And when it was, he had\n      to backtrack, because he lied to you.\n\n(Tr. at 1414-1416).\n\n      {¶135} While Stober argues that these statements were improper, witnesses\n\ndid give testimony that directly contradicted Stober’s testimony on the stand. As\n\nthe prosecutor is entitled to urge the jury to make reasonable inferences from the\n\nevidence, we cannot find that it was improper for the State to argue that Stober\n\nwas lying in these specific circumstances.\n\n\n                                       -54-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\n         {¶136} Stober next contends that the prosecutor improperly “repeatedly\n\ntried to have the jurors put themselves in the place of an alleged assault or in the\n\nplace [of] the alleged victims.” (Appt.’s Br. at 24). Stober cites the following\n\nsegments as being improper.\n\n         She had to announce the homecoming court later that night, and\n         she recalls with clarity these details, as would you, if it happened\n         to you.\n\n(Tr. at 1408).\n\n         ***\n\n         And where do these offenses take place? Within the privacy of a\n         closed space, of a room, where there aren’t witnesses. And if\n         that wasn’t sufficient for a conviction, we wouldn’t have\n         convictions in this country for people who commit sex offenses.\n         If that wasn’t sufficient, you could be grabbed inappropriately,\n         when no one is around, and no one could do anything about that,\n         but that’s not how our system works.\n\n(Tr. at 1409).\n\n         Because if you’re grabbed, or you’re touched sexually, that case\n         can’t be prosecuted, can it? If you’re touched sexually, and no\n         one is present, people aren’t present when these things happen,\n         God help us all, because I can’t get justice for you.9\n\n(Tr. at 1440).\n\n         And if this is not sufficient to establish force, again, God help us\n         all, because if someone comes up to you and grabs your breast,\n\n\n9\n It should be noted that the Prosecutor used this phrase “God help us all” after defense counsel stated in his\nclosing argument, “[a]nd this is my final comment to you, and I go back to my opening, if this is proof\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, heaven help us all.” (Tr. at 1439).\n\n                                                    -55-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\n       or your butt, and you don’t want it, and you’re not asking for it\n       * * *[.]\n\n(Tr. at 1443).\n\n       {¶137} After reviewing the passages, we find nothing improper by the\n\nprosecutor for several reasons. First, as part of Stober’s trial strategy, he painted\n\nthe State’s case as a “witch hunt” and challenged the authenticity of the alleged\n\nvictim’s testimony relating to the incidents that happened without corroborating\n\nwitnesses. The prosecutor’s statements in closing argument were in response to\n\nthat line of questioning. Second, in the latter two cited portions, the prosecutor\n\nwas merely responding to defense counsel’s closing argument that the victims’\n\nword alone was not enough to reach the high bar of beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nThus, we cannot find that these statements were improper. However, even if they\n\nwere improper, we cannot find that these statements, when taken in context of the\n\nentire trial, deprived Stober of a fair trial.\n\n       {¶138} Stober next contends that the prosecutor “sought to evoke sympathy\n\nfor the alleged victims.”      After reviewing the transcript, we do not find the\n\nprosecutor’s statements to be improper when viewed in context. For example,\n\nStober argues that the prosecutor improperly stated in closing argument that Karen\n\nFortman “squirmed in her seat” and “she had to pull it together” after meeting\n\nalone with Stober.       Notwithstanding Stober’s argument, this is an accurate\n\n\n                                           -56-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\nreflection of the transcript, where Fortman testified that she was “obviously”\n\nsquirming in her seat during the incident, and that she was “extremely”\n\nuncomfortable. (Tr. at 317). Fortman also testified that she had to pull herself\n\ntogether to announce the homecoming court later on the night of the incident. (Tr.\n\nat 320). Therefore, the prosecutor’s statements were a proper characterization of\n\nthe testimony. We similarly find that the remaining incidents cited by Stober are\n\nnot improper when taken in context.\n\n       {¶139} Stober next argues that the prosecutor improperly elicited testimony\n\nfrom various witnesses during the trial as to “whether they believed and/or\n\nsupported the alleged victims.” (Appt’s Br. at 24). After reviewing the transcript,\n\nwe do not find any of the incidents cited by Stober to be error. For example,\n\nStober contends that Jeff Burke was simply a vouching witness. However, Burke\n\ntestified that C.K. confided in him long before the allegations in this case were\n\nmade that she was receiving unwanted messages from a teacher.              Burke’s\n\ntestimony countered Stober’s counsel’s cross examination of C.K., wherein\n\nStober’s counsel challenged C.K.’s reasoning for not coming forward earlier.\n\n       {¶140} In addition, Stober argues that Detective Roy Sargent was\n\nimproperly asked about other females who came forward in the investigation and\n\ndiscussed inappropriate messages from Stober. However, Detective Sargent was\n\nonly asked about the other females after Stober’s counsel raised the issue, bringing\n\n                                       -57-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\nup a search warrant that mentioned other potential victims existed. We find that\n\nthis incident, and the remaining incidents cited by Stober were not improper when\n\ntaken in context.\n\n       {¶141} Finally, Stober argues that the prosecutor improperly stated\n\nincorrect definitions of the law regarding force during closing arguments.\n\nNotwithstanding the prosecutor’s statements during closing argument, which we\n\nfind consistent with the standards discussed previously, the jury was instructed\n\nthat closing arguments were not evidence.           In addition, we have already\n\ndetermined that the trial court’s actual jury instructions on force were proper in the\n\ncontext of this case. Thus, having reviewed the prosecutor’s statements on force,\n\nwe cannot find any error that would rise to the level of prejudicial misconduct.\n\n       {¶142} In sum, after reviewing the entire record and the arguments made\n\nby Stober, we cannot find that prosecutorial misconduct was present in this case.\n\nAccordingly, Stober’s sixth assignment of error is overruled.\n\n                            Seventh Assignment of Error\n\n       {¶143} In Stober’s seventh assignment of error, he argues that he was\n\ndenied his right to effective assistance of counsel. “Reversal of convictions on\n\nineffective assistance requires the defendant to show ‘first that counsel’s\n\nperformance was deficient and, second that the deficient performance prejudiced\n\nthe defense so as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial.’” State v. Cassano, 96\n\n                                        -58-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\nOhio St.3d 94, 2002-Ohio-3751 at ¶105, quoting Strickland v. Washington, 466\n\nU.S. 668, 669, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (1984). When considering a claim of ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel, the court “must indulge a strong presumption that counsel’s\n\nconduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.”\n\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 689.\n\n       {¶144} A tactical decision by trial counsel, who as a licensed attorney is\n\npresumed to be competent, is not by itself enough to show ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel simply because the strategy did not result in an acquittal. State v. Clayton,\n\n62 Ohio St.2d 45, 48-49 (1980); State v. Timm, 3d Dist. Seneca No. 13-11-23,\n\n2012-Ohio-410, ¶ 31. “Furthermore, trial counsel’s failure to object is generally\n\nviewed as trial strategy and does not establish ineffective assistance.” State v.\n\nTurks, 3d. Dist. Allen No. 1-08-44, 2009-Ohio-1837, ¶ 43, citing State v.\n\nMcKinney, 11th Dist. Trumbull No. 2007-T-0004, 2008-Ohio-3256, ¶ 191; State v.\n\nConway, 109 Ohio St.3d 412, 2006-Ohio-2815, ¶ 103.\n\n       {¶145} Stober makes a number of arguments on appeal in an attempt to\n\nestablish that his counsel was ineffective. First, Stober argues that his trial counsel\n\nwas ineffective for failing to object to the “404(B) witnesses” discussed in the fifth\n\nassignment of error.     As we have already found that the testimony of these\n\nwitnesses was permissible, and that in any event, there was no resulting prejudice,\n\nwe cannot find that Stober’s counsel was ineffective for failing to object. This is\n\n                                         -59-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\nparticularly true in light of the fact that Stober’s counsel clearly wanted to make an\n\nissue of these witnesses having not been physically touched by Stober, in an\n\nattempt to paint the State’s case as a “witch hunt” and a misguided attempt by the\n\nState to compare Stober to Jerry Sandusky.\n\n       {¶146} Stober next argues that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing\n\nto object to leading questions used by the State throughout the trial.      Evidence\n\nRule 611(C) provides that “[l]eading questions should not be used on the direct\n\nexamination of a witness except as may be necessary to develop his testimony.”\n\nThis broad exception places the decision of whether to allow leading questions\n\nwithin the sound discretion of the trial court. State v. Jackson, 92 Ohio St.3d 436,\n\n449 (2001); State v. Jefferson, 2d Dist. Greene No. 2002 CA 26, 2002-Ohio-6377,\n\n¶ 9. As a result, the Ohio Supreme Court has held that the failure to object to\n\nleading questions does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. Jackson,\n\nsupra, at 449; State v. Fraker, 3d Dist. Union No. 14-12-19, 2013-Ohio-4561, ¶\n\n59. Thus we cannot find that any failure to object to any leading questions would\n\nrise to the level of ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\n       {¶147} Stober next argues that his counsel was ineffective for failing to\n\nobject to “vouching,” “demeanor” and “sympathy” testimony from numerous\n\nprosecution witnesses. However, we have already discussed that it was not error\n\nfor the prosecutor to elicit the testimony cited by Stober under the sixth\n\n                                          -60-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\nassignment of error. Therefore, we cannot find his counsel ineffective for failing\n\nto object to this testimony.\n\n       {¶148} Finally, Stober argues that his trial counsel was ineffective for\n\nfailing to object “to rampant hearsay and other improper testimonies.” (Appt’s Br.\n\nat 29). Stober cites only one example of “rampant hearsay.” As support, he\n\nclaims that when Amy Recker was on the stand, Stober’s counsel was ineffective\n\nfor failing to object to Recker’s testimony that H.Z. was “depressed,” “sad,” and\n\nwas in therapy. At this point in the trial, H.Z. had already testified to severe\n\nemotional problems, which ultimately led to her hospitalization.           Even if the\n\ntestimony was impermissible, it was merely cumulative to other testimony, and\n\nthus would not be prejudicial. Accordingly, we cannot find that the testimony was\n\nprejudicial, or that Stober’s counsel was ineffective for failing to object to it.\n\n       {¶149} In sum, after reviewing the transcripts and the arguments made by\n\nStober, we cannot find that his counsel was ineffective. Accordingly, Stober’s\n\nseventh assignment of error is overruled.\n\n                               Eighth Assignment of Error\n\n       {¶150} In Stober’s eighth assignment of error, he argues that the trial court\n\nfailed to make the necessary findings under R.C. 2929.14(C) for the imposition of\n\nmaximum, consecutive sentences.\n\n\n\n                                          -61-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\n      {¶151} “A trial court’s sentence will not be disturbed on appeal absent a\n\ndefendant’s showing by clear and convincing evidence that the sentence is\n\nunsupported by the record; the sentencing statutes’ procedure was not followed or\n\nthere was not a sufficient basis for the imposition of a prison term; or that the\n\nsentence is contrary to law.” State v. Upkins, 3d Dist. Shelby No. 17-13-02, 2013-\n\nOhio-3986, ¶ 8, citing State v. Ramos, 3d Dist. Defiance No. 4-06-24, 2007-Ohio-\n\n767, ¶ 23 (the clear and convincing evidence standard of review set forth under\n\nR.C. 2953.08(G)(2) remains viable with respect to those cases appealed under the\n\napplicable provisions of R.C. 2953.08(A), (B), and (C) * * *).           Clear and\n\nconvincing evidence is that “which will produce in the mind of the trier of facts a\n\nfirm belief or conviction as to the facts sought to be established.” Cross v.\n\nLedford, 161 Ohio St. 469 (1954), paragraph three of the syllabus. An appellate\n\ncourt should not, however, substitute its judgment for that of the trial court\n\nbecause the trial court is “‘clearly in the better position to judge the defendant’s\n\ndangerousness and to ascertain the effect of the crimes on the victims.’” State v.\n\nWatkins, 3d Dist. Auglaize No. 2–04–08, 2004–Ohio–4809, ¶ 16, quoting State v.\n\nJones, 93 Ohio St.3d 391, 400 (2001).\n\n      {¶152} At the outset, we note that recent amendments to R.C.\n\n2929.14(C)(4) now require a trial court to make additional specific findings before\n\nimposing consecutive sentences on an offender. While the trial court is required to\n\n                                        -62-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\nmake the specific findings, it is not required to list its reasoning for making the\n\nfindings. State v. Hill, 3d Dist. No. 7-12-11, 2013-Ohio-3873, ¶ 22. Nevertheless,\n\nwith respect to the issues raised in this case R.C. 2929.14(C)(4) states,\n\n       (4) If multiple prison terms are imposed on an offender for\n       convictions of multiple offenses, the court may require the\n       offender to serve the prison terms consecutively if the court finds\n       that the consecutive service is necessary to protect the public\n       from future crime or to punish the offender and that consecutive\n       sentences are not disproportionate to the seriousness of the\n       offender's conduct and to the danger the offender poses to the\n       public, and if the court also finds any of the following:\n\n       (a) The offender committed one or more of the multiple\n           offenses while the offender was awaiting trial or sentencing,\n           was under a sanction imposed pursuant to section 2929.16,\n           2929.17, or 2929.18 of the Revised Code, or was under post-\n           release control for a prior offense.\n\n       (b) At least two of the multiple offenses were committed as part\n           of one or more courses of conduct, and the harm caused by\n           two or more of the multiple offenses so committed was so\n           great or unusual that no single prison term for any of the\n           offenses committed as part of any of the courses of conduct\n           adequately reflects the seriousness of the offender's\n           conduct.\n\n       (c) The offender’s history of criminal conduct demonstrates\n           that consecutive sentences are necessary to protect the\n           public from future crime by the offender.\n\n       {¶153} Thus, based on the statute, the trial court is required to make three\n\nfindings before imposing consecutive sentences: 1) that consecutive sentences are\n\nnecessary to protect the public from the future crime or to punish the offender; 2)\n\n\n                                        -63-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\nthat consecutive sentences are not disproportionate to the seriousness of the\n\noffender’s conduct and to the danger the offender poses to the public; and 3) that\n\none of the subsections (a), (b), or (c) apply. State v. Farnsworth, 10th Dist.\n\nFranklin No. 12CO10, 2013-Ohio-1275, ¶ 8.\n\n       {¶154} In this case, the trial court’s judgment entry states as follows.\n\n       The Court has considered the record, oral statements,\n       Defendant’s pre-sentence investigation report, as well as the\n       principles and purposes of sentencing under Ohio Revised Code\n       Section 2929.11 & 2929.12. The Court finds consecutive\n       sentences are necessary to protect the public and punish the\n       Offender, and are not disproportionate. The Court further finds\n       that the convictions are sex offenses.\n\n(Doc. 188). It is clear from the judgment entry that the trial court made the first\n\nrequired finding, and at least used some of the language of the second required\n\nfinding, but it did not make any reference to any of the subsections (a), (b), or (c),\n\nof R.C. 2929.14(C)(4) that applied, either by utilizing any of the language of the\n\nstatutory subsection, or by using similar language.\n\n       {¶155} At the sentencing hearing, the trial court went further than it did in\n\nits entry.\n\n       The Court finds that consecutive sentences are necessary to\n       protect the public and to punish the offender, are not\n       disproportionate to the counts found guilty by the verdict. The\n       Court finds that the harm is so great or unusual that a single\n       prison term does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the\n       content [sic].\n\n\n                                        -64-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\n(Mar. 18, 2013 Tr. at 20). Thus, at the hearing, the trial court more clearly\n\nreferenced the first two findings it is required to make, and utilized some of the\n\nlanguage from subsection (b). However, despite utilizing some of the language of\n\nsubsection (b), the trial court still did not make any finding as to whether “[a]t\n\nleast two of the multiple offenses were committed as part of one or more courses\n\nof conduct[.]”\n\n        {¶156} In State v. Venes, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 98682, 2013–Ohio–1891,\n\nthe Eighth District held,\n\n        [N]ot requiring slavish adherence to the specific wording of the\n        statute is not the same as relieving the court of the duty to make\n        the required “findings.” R.C. 2929.14(C)(4) requires the court to\n        make specific “findings.” In the past, we have found those\n        findings can be implicit in context when the court’s statements\n        during sentencing are intended to encompass the relevant\n        provisions of the sentencing statutes. But in doing so, we have\n        arguably frustrated the purposes underlying the requirement\n        for findings as a predicate for ordering consecutive sentences.\n\n(Internal citation omitted). Venes, at ¶ 14.10\n\n        {¶157} In this case, we are mindful of the fact that it seems obvious that\n\nthere are multiple courses of conduct and multiple victims. Nevertheless, in State\n\nv. Farnsworth, supra, the 7th District Court of Appeals held that where the trial\n\ncourt made only two of the three required findings, reversal was warranted for\n\n\n10\n  We distinguished Venes in State v. Upkins, 3d Dist. Shelby No. 17-13-02, 2013-Ohio-3986. In Upkins,\nthe trial court did make all the required findings.\n\n\n                                               -65-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\nresentencing. See also State v. Brooks, 9th Dist. Summit Nos. 26437, 26352,\n\n2013-Ohio-2169, ¶ 13 (“[T]his court concludes that [R.C. 2929.14(C)’s] findings\n\nmust be made at the sentencing hearing on the record. * * * Ideally, those\n\nfindings would also then be memorialized in the sentencing entry.”). In this case,\n\nthe findings did not fully comply with R.C. 2929.14(C) in either instance.\n\n       {¶158} Accordingly, we have no choice but to find that the trial court failed\n\nto make adequate findings to support the imposition of consecutive sentences.\n\nTherefore, Stober’s eighth assignment of error is sustained.\n\n                             Ninth Assignment of Error\n\n       {¶159} In Stober’s ninth assignment of error, he argues that Stober was\n\ndenied due process and a fair trial due to errors committed by the trial court, the\n\nprosecutor, and Stober’s trial counsel.      Specifically, Stober contends that the\n\ncumulative errors throughout the trial denied Stober his right to a fair trial.\n\n       {¶160} Having sustained no errors regarding Stober’s trial, we cannot find\n\nthat there are any errors that collectively have a “cumulative” effect to such an\n\nextent that Stober was deprived of a fair trial. Nevertheless, to the extent that any\n\nerrors existed, when taken in context of the entire trial, they are not sufficient to\n\nsupport reversal. Accordingly, Stober’s ninth assignment of error is overruled.\n\n       {¶161} For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Putnam County\n\nCommon Pleas Court is affirmed in part, and reversed in part and remanded to the\n\n                                         -66-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\ntrial court for resentencing to consider whether consecutive sentences are\n\nappropriate under R.C. 2929.14(C)(4) and, if so, to enter the proper findings on the\n\nrecord.\n\n                                                       Judgment Affirmed in Part,\n                                                            Reversed in Part and\n                                                                Cause Remanded\n\nWILLAMOWSKI, P.J. and PRESTON, J., concur.\n\n/jlr\n\n\n\n\n                                       -67-\n\f",

Stephen Chamberlain for Appellant\n\n        Todd C. Schroeder for Appellee\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\nSHAW, J.\n\n        {¶1} Defendant-appellant Jeremy Stober (“Stober”) appeals the March 28,\n\n2013, judgment of the Putnam County Common Pleas Court sentencing Stober to\n\nan aggregate prison term of 10 and one-half years following Stober’s jury trial\n\nconvictions for Sexual Battery in violation of R.C. 2907.03(A)(7), a felony of the\n\nthird degree, three counts of Gross Sexual Imposition in violation of R.C.\n\n2907.05(A)(1), all felonies of the fourth degree, and Importuning in violation of\n\nR.C. 2907.07(B)(1), a felony of the fifth degree.\n\n        {¶2} The facts relevant to this appeal are as follows. On September 17,\n\n2012, Stober was indicted in an eight count indictment for Tampering with\n\nEvidence in violation of R.C. 2921.12(A)(1), a felony of the third degree (Count\n\n1), four counts of Gross Sexual Imposition (“GSI”) in violation of R.C.\n\n2907.05(A)(1), all felonies of the fourth degree (Counts 2, 4, 6 and 7), Sexual\n\nBattery in violation of R.C. 2907.03(A)(7), a felony of the third degree (Count 3),\n\nImportuning in violation of R.C. 2907.07(B)(1), a felony of the fifth degree (Count\n\n5), and Attempted Sexual Battery in violation of R.C. 2923.02(A) and R.C.\n\n2907.03(A)(9), a felony of the fourth degree (Count 8). (Doc. 1). The Bill of\n\nParticulars specified that there were three alleged victims of the crimes, and that\n\nthe crimes took place over a time span ranging from 2001 through 2012. (Doc.\n\n158).\n\n                                        -2-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\n        {¶3} On September 18, 2012, Stober was arraigned and pled not guilty to\n\nthe charges against him. (Doc. 18).\n\n        {¶4} On October 31, 2012, Stober filed a “Motion for Relief from\n\nPrejudicial Joinder,” arguing that “it would be prejudicial to [Stober’s] defense to\n\njoin together in one trial all eight Counts consisting of different victims, spanning\n\na time frame over eleven years.” (Doc. 38).1 On December 14, 2012, the State\n\nfiled a response to this motion, contending that the law favored joinder, that the\n\noffenses were of the same or similar character, and/or that they were part of a\n\ncourse of criminal conduct.             (Doc. 54).       The State also contended that the\n\ntestimony of the separate witnesses would have been admissible anyway under\n\nEvid.R. 404(B). (Id.)\n\n        {¶5} On January 7, 2013, a hearing on pending motions was held.\n\nRegarding the “Motion for Relief from Prejudicial Joinder,” after hearing\n\narguments from both sides, the trial court stated that case law supported joinder for\n\nsimilar type offenses and overruled Stober’s motion. (Jan. 7, 2013 Tr. at 7). An\n\nentry reflecting this was filed January 22, 2013. (Doc. 71).\n\n        {¶6} The matter subsequently proceeded to a jury trial, which was held on\n\nFebruary 25-28, 2013. At trial, the State called 22 witnesses in its case-in-chief\n\n1\n  Stober also filed various other motions including, inter alia, two motions in limine (Docs. 40; 42), a\nmotion for change of venue (Doc. 41), a motion to suppress (Doc. 47), and a motion to dismiss Count 1 of\nthe Indictment (Doc. 66). None of these motions are related to the assignments of error in this appeal,\ntherefore we will not further discuss them.\n\n                                                  -3-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\nand 5 rebuttal witnesses. Stober called ten witnesses on his behalf and also took\n\nthe witness stand himself.\n\n         {¶7} Testimony was presented that Stober was a teacher at Kalida High\n\nSchool, beginning in the fall of 1993, and later employed by the school as a\n\ntechnology coordinator, while still occasionally teaching. (Tr. at 1245). Stober\n\nwas also the high school girls’ varsity volleyball coach for Kalida. (Id. at 1246-\n\n1247).\n\n         {¶8} Karen Fortman testified at trial that she took a class taught by Stober\n\nin 1994, Stober’s second year as a teacher, and that in that class, Stober singled her\n\nout and made a “spectacle” of her. (Tr. at 314). Fortman testified that the\n\nconstant teasing prompted her to leave class one day and go to the guidance office\n\nto request out of Stober’s class. (Tr. at 315). Fortman testified that after hearing\n\nof this, Stober called her to his office after school, closed the door and apologized.\n\n(Tr. at 317). According to Fortman, Stober then said that when he looked at\n\nFortman, he thought of her as someone he would want to be married to. (Id.)\n\n         {¶9} Mary Lynn Lanham testified at trial that she also played volleyball for\n\nStober, and graduated in 2001. She testified that while in high school, Stober sent\n\nher messages on ICQ chat. (Tr. at 343). Lanham testified that Stober asked her\n\nabout her personal life. (Tr. at 343-44). Lanham also testified that Stober sent her\n\na message one day that said if Stober “was [her] age [he] could see [himself] with\n\n                                          -4-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\n[Lanham], that [she] was his type.” (Tr. at 344). Lanham showed her mother this\n\nmessage, who testified to the same at trial. (Tr. at 730). Lanham did not report\n\nthe incident, however, because she did not want it to affect volleyball, which was\n\nvery important to her at the time. (Tr. at 345).\n\n           {¶10} J.L. was the first alleged victim to testify at trial. J.L. testified that\n\nshe played volleyball for Stober and that she graduated from Kalida in 2002. (Tr.\n\nat 357). J.L. testified that one day, Stober called J.L. into his office to talk about a\n\ncookout. (Id. at 359). J.L. then testified that Stober said he cared about her and\n\nher opinion. (Id.) Following this comment, J.L. testified that Stober hugged her,\n\npressing against her, having contact with her breasts. (Tr. at 360-361). J.L.\n\ntestified that the hug felt sexual to her, had a lasting effect on her, and that she did\n\nnot reciprocate in any manner. (Id.) That contact was the basis for the filing of\n\nCount 2, Gross Sexual Imposition (“GSI”), in the indictment.2 J.L. testified that\n\nshe told her parents about the incident, but she did not want to give up volleyball,\n\nso she did not take it any further. (Tr. at 363-364).\n\n           {¶11} J.L. also testified that years later, in 2008, she began a teaching\n\ncareer as a substitute at Kalida. (Tr. at 369). J.L. testified that one day in 2009\n\nStober came into her room, shut the door, and asked her why she did not tell\n\nStober about her pregnancy. (Tr. at 373). Stober also said to J.L. that he thought\n\n2\n    Stober was acquitted of this charge.\n\n                                             -5-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\nJ.L. was going to “wait around for [him].” (Id.) J.L. testified that Stober “made\n\nsome kind of inference about his wife, something happening to his wife,” adding,\n\n“[w]eren’t you going to wait for something to happen to Kristi, so that you and I\n\ncan be together?” (Id.)\n\n       {¶12} Jenna Missler testified at trial that she was a Spanish teacher at\n\nKalida. (Tr. at 483). Missler testified that Stober initiated instant-messaging\n\ncontact with her. (Tr. at 484). Missler testified that the messages began by being\n\nwork related then became more personal. (Tr. at 484). Missler testified that\n\nStober often sent messages to her that ended in “smiley” faces. (Id.) Missler\n\ntestified that the comments Stober sent her, specifically in 2006-2007, eventually\n\ncrossed the line, and she brought the comments to the sexual harassment\n\ndirector/coordinator. (Tr. at 512).\n\n       {¶13} C.K. was the second alleged victim who testified at trial.       C.K.\n\ntestified that although she was a student at Kalida, she did not have Stober as a\n\nteacher and she did not play volleyball. (Tr. at 535). C.K. testified that she came\n\ninto school one day after she changed her hair color, and while in class she\n\nreceived a text message about her hair looking nice from an unknown number.\n\n(Id. at 537). C.K. responded by asking who it was, and received the response,\n\n“you’ll find out.” (Id.)\n\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\n        {¶14} After talking with other girls, C.K. learned that the number that had\n\nmessaged her was Stober’s. (Tr. at 539). C.K. testified that she and Stober then\n\nengaged in regular texting with each other. (Tr. at 542). C.K. testified that the\n\ntexts were “flirtatious” in nature and that Stober would talk to her about a\n\nrelationship. (Tr. at 544-545). C.K. testified that Stober told her that he and his\n\nwife did not have sex anymore. In addition, C.K. testified that Stober sent her text\n\nmessages that made her feel good, such as calling her beautiful. (Tr. at 545).\n\n        {¶15} C.K. testified that some of the text messages were overtly sexual,\n\nwith Stober going so far as to say that he masturbated while he thought of her, that\n\n“he would be so big he would tear [her] up” and that “he could please [her] and he\n\ncould do so many things with [her].” (Tr. at 542, 544-45)        C.K. testified that\n\nStober told her that he had a video of himself masturbating and that he could send\n\nit to C.K. (Tr. at 559). Although the video was never sent, this video was later\n\nlocated on one of Stober’s cell phones.\n\n        {¶16} C.K. testified to an incident wherein she was alone with Stober in his\n\noffice, and Stober grabbed her butt and moaned, “grumbling like he liked it.” (Tr.\n\nat 546). C.K. testified to a separate incident wherein she was alone with Stober in\n\nhis office, and Stober exposed his penis to her and caused her to touch it. (Tr. at\n\n565).    These incidents, alleged to have occurred between March 2010 and\n\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\nFebruary of 2011 led to the State filing the GSI charge against Stober in Count 4\n\nof the indictment.3\n\n           {¶17} C.K. testified that Stober eventually sent her messages asking about\n\nher parents’ schedule. (Tr. at 547-48). C.K. testified that she lived with her\n\nfather, who worked third shift, and that she informed Stober of this. (Id.) C.K.\n\ntestified that about a week after she informed Stober of her father’s schedule,\n\nStober showed up at her house around 4 a.m. and knocked on the door. (Id. at\n\n552). C.K. testified that\n\n           I opened the door, I peeked my head around the corner; and I\n           seen him, and I froze. And he had stepped forward into the\n           house, pushing me backwards down onto the couch. Then he\n           started feeling up my shirt and down my shorts, was kissing me.\n           Proceeded to take my shorts off, stuck his fingers inside me and\n           then his penis.\n\n(Tr. at 552). C.K. testified that she was too scared to say no. (Tr. at 552). C.K.\n\ntestified that when Stober finished, he pulled up his shorts and walked out the\n\ndoor. (Tr. at 553). According to C.K. this occurred in June of 2010. This incident\n\nled to the State filing the Sexual Battery charge in Count 3 of the Indictment.\n\n           {¶18} C.K. testified that the messages continued from Stober, including\n\ncontinued talk of a potential relationship with C.K. (Tr. at 554). C.K. testified\n\nthat she told Jeff Burke about the texts and that she was uncomfortable receiving\n\n\n\n3\n    The dates in the Indictment were amended to comport with the evidence presented at trial. (Tr. at 1380).\n\n                                                      -8-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\nthem. (Tr. at 558). She also testified that she told the guidance counselor about\n\nreceiving messages. (Tr. at 559). C.K. testified that the text messages stopped\n\naround Thanksgiving after she graduated from high school. (Tr. at 569). She\n\ntestified that she had negative emotions, and later texted Stober, “asking him why\n\nhe did it.” (Tr. at 570). According to C.K., Stober messaged back asking who it\n\nwas that was messaging him. (Id.) C.K. testified that she messaged back, calling\n\nhim “a sick fuck,” a text which C.K. testified Stober never acknowledged. (Id.)\n\n           {¶19} C.K. testified she did not initially want to come forward to be\n\ninvolved because she was embarrassed, but did so after H.Z. asked her to do so.\n\n(Tr. at 582). C.K. testified that Stober directed her to erase a text message Stober\n\nhad sent her about not being able to have kids, so she had nothing to worry about.\n\n(Tr. at 661). This was one of the instances of Tampering with Evidence leading to\n\nthe filing of Count 1 of the Indictment.4\n\n           {¶20} H.Z. was the third alleged victim that testified at trial. H.Z. testified\n\nthat she was a 2012 Kalida graduate who had played volleyball for Stober. (Tr. at\n\n752). H.Z. was also a neighbor of Stober’s. (Id.) H.Z. testified she was in 7th\n\ngrade when she received her first text message from Stober, but for years the\n\nmessages were supportive and volleyball related. (Tr. at 753-754). H.Z. testified\n\nthat the messages turned sexual when she began dating her first boyfriend. (Tr. at\n\n4\n    Stober was acquitted of this charge.\n\n                                             -9-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\n757). H.Z. testified that Stober told her that her boyfriend did not deserve her and\n\nthat Stober could do better. (Id.)\n\n       {¶21} H.Z. testified that Stober asked about her sex life and made\n\ncomments about using his fingers on her, and later, he talked about oral sex. (Tr.\n\nat 754-758). These messages Stober sent to H.Z. allegedly occurred prior to H.Z.\n\nturning 16 and led to the State filing the Importuning charge in Count 5 of the\n\nIndictment.\n\n       {¶22} According to H.Z., the text messages between her and Stober\n\ncontinued through her sophomore year and into her junior year.           (Id.)   H.Z.\n\ntestified that some of the messages, but not all, were sexual. (Tr. at 762). H.Z.\n\ntestified that she had an eating disorder, and was depressed. (Tr. at 767-768). She\n\ntestified that some of the messages Stober sent her were supportive. (Id.) She also\n\ntestified that Stober talked about his personal life a lot, saying that H.Z. could\n\n“fix” Stober’s problems with his wife. (Tr. at 764, 766).\n\n       {¶23} H.Z. testified that the summer after her junior year, in June of 2011,\n\nshe drove to Stober’s residence and stopped in the driveway to drop off a paper for\n\na Volleyball camp. (Tr. at 773). H.Z. testified that Stober reached past the form\n\nshe had clearly extended out of the car and grabbed her breast. (Id.) H.Z. testified\n\nthat Stober acted as though it was an accident. (Tr. at 774). H.Z. testified that she\n\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\nthen left, but later Stober messaged her saying he wished she would come back.\n\n(Id.) This contact led to filing of the GSI charge in Count 6 of the Indictment.\n\n       {¶24} H.Z. testified that her senior year the text messages from Stober were\n\nmore than ever sexual, and that she continued to struggle with emotional\n\nproblems, an eating disorder, depression, and suicidal thoughts. (Tr. at 777). H.Z.\n\ntestified that she messaged Stober saying she was fat, and he said “prove to me\n\nyou’re fat.” (Tr. at 780). H.Z. sent him a picture of a scale showing her weight.\n\n(Id.) In response, Stober called her down to his office and told H.Z. to lift up her\n\nshirt. (Id.) Stober then put his hand on H.Z.’s waist, and ran it along to her\n\n“bottom” and then “laughed it off like it was no big deal.” (Id.) This contact was\n\nalleged to have occurred between August 2011 and October 2011, and led to the\n\nfiling of the GSI charge in Count 7 of the Indictment.\n\n       {¶25} H.Z. testified that Stober drove her to a volleyball all-star game that\n\nH.Z. was playing in and Stober was coaching. (Tr. at 784). H.Z. testified that on\n\nthe drive, Stober put his hand on her leg, squeezed it, and said they could go off\n\ninto the woods. (Tr. at 787). H.Z. declined and they continued on to the game.\n\n(Id.) H.Z. testified that it was clear to her that Stober’s intentions were sexual.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\n(Id.) This incident led to the filing of the Attempted Sexual Battery charge in\n\nCount 8 of the Indictment.5\n\n           {¶26} H.Z. testified that she was an office assistant at the Kalida High\n\nSchool during her free time, and that she eventually showed one of the messages\n\nStober sent her to Nancy Grote, who worked in the office as a secretary. (Tr. at\n\n796). H.Z. also confided in Amy Recker, a religion teacher, about the messages\n\nshe was receiving from Stober. (Tr. at 793).\n\n           {¶27} H.Z. was told that more evidence was needed, so she took it upon\n\nherself to initiate text messages with Stober. (Tr. at 797). H.Z. testified that she\n\nknew Stober would turn the messaging sexual, and he did. (Tr. at 798-801). Amy\n\nRecker then showed the text messages to school authorities, made a transcript of\n\nthem, and the school authorities contacted the police. (Tr. at 1067).\n\n           {¶28} The text “transcript” that was typed by Amy Recker was introduced\n\ninto evidence, but no other text “content” was introduced into the record. (Tr. at\n\n1069).        Amy Recker testified that before H.Z. decided to text Stober, they\n\nattempted to obtain the records of prior text message content, but were told they\n\ncould not get them. (Tr. at 1065). However, the State did introduce voluminous\n\ncell phone records of Stober, indicating that he had exchanged thousands of text\n\n\n\n\n5\n    Stober was acquitted of this charge.\n\n                                           -12-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\nmessages with C.K. and H.Z over a period of months, as far back as the records\n\ncould be traced.6 The content of prior text messages could not be reproduced.\n\n         {¶29} In his case-in-chief, Stober called several witnesses who testified that\n\nthey had never seen or witnessed Stober do anything inappropriate. Several of\n\nStober’s former volleyball players testified that Stober would say things like they\n\nlooked nice, but they did not find the comments inappropriate or offensive.\n\nThroughout the trial, Stober’s counsel painted the State’s case as a “witch hunt.”\n\n         {¶30} Stober also took the stand in his own defense. Stober admitted to\n\ntexting his volleyball players, and admitted that he messaged H.Z. and C.K. (Tr.\n\nat 1250, 1343-1360). Stober testified that his messages with H.Z. began when she\n\nwould watch Stober’s house while he was on vacation. (Tr. at 1250). Stober\n\ntestified that personal texts were exchanged between him and H.Z., as H.Z.\n\ndisclosed things to him. (Tr. at 1252).\n\n         {¶31} Stober testified that he also helped coach baseball, and that a former\n\nbaseball player of his committed suicide. (Tr. at 1253). Stober testified that the\n\nsuicide “shook” him and that he “wasn’t ever going to let that happen again.” (Tr.\n\nat 1255).\n\n\n\n6\n While the record reflected that thousands of text messages had been exchanged between Stober and C.K.\nand Stober and H.Z., Stober maintains on appeal that there were really only five or six text “conversations”\nper month between Stober and the girls, containing multiple “lines” of texts each, so that the actual number\nof texts exchanged was not in the thousands.\n\n                                                   -13-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\n         {¶32} Stober testified that H.Z. talked about suicide, and that he sent her\n\nmany supportive messages. (Tr. at 1256-57). Stober testified that he tried to play\n\na father figure role with H.Z. and that any sex-related talk came out of H.Z.’s\n\nquestions. (Tr. at 1266). Stober testified that H.Z. was not truthful, and that he\n\ndid not grab H.Z.’s butt or stomach. (Tr. at 1292-1293).\n\n         {¶33} Stober testified that alleged victim J.L. was a babysitter for his\n\nchildren when they were younger, and that J.L.’s family was close to his. (Tr. at\n\n1279). He testified that he doesn’t recall the “hug” J.L. described, and that he was\n\ninitially happy when J.L. came back to Kalida as a teacher because he thought she\n\ncould take over coaching volleyball one day. (Tr. at 1281-1285).\n\n         {¶34} Stober testified that alleged victim C.K. was lying, that he had never\n\nbeen to C.K.’s father’s house, and that her allegations were untrue. (Tr. at 1289).\n\nStober also testified that he did not squeeze C.K.’s butt or cause her to touch his\n\npenis.    (Id. at 1289-90)    Stober testified that C.K. was also lying about the\n\nmasturbation video, saying that he made it and offered to send it to his mistress,\n\nLori Fisher, who also testified at trial. (Tr. at 1273). Fisher testified on rebuttal\n\nthat Stober never mentioned the masturbation video to her or sent it to her. (Tr. at\n\n1404).\n\n         {¶35} Following the witnesses’ testimony and the parties’ closing\n\narguments, the case was submitted to the jury.          After deliberating, the jury\n\n                                         -14-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\nreturned Not Guilty verdicts on Count 1, Tampering with Evidence, Count 2,\n\nGross Sexual Imposition of J.L., and Count 8, Attempted Sexual Battery of H.Z.\n\nStober was found Guilty of Count 3, Sexual Battery of C.K., Count 4, Gross\n\nSexual Imposition of C.K., Count 5, Importuning of H.Z., and Counts 6 and 7,\n\nGross Sexual Imposition of H.Z.\n\n        {¶36} On March 18, 2013, Stober’s sentencing hearing was held.7 The\n\nState recommended that Stober receive maximum prison sentences on each count\n\nto be served consecutively for an aggregate prison term of 10 and one-half years.\n\nTwo of the victims who had testified at trial gave brief statements. Stober’s\n\ncounsel then made an argument in mitigation. Ultimately, the trial court sentenced\n\nStober to maximum, consecutive sentences for each count, for an aggregate prison\n\nterm of 10 and one-half years. A judgment entry memorializing Stober’s sentence\n\nwas filed March 28, 2013.\n\n        {¶37} It is from this judgment that Stober appeals, asserting the following\n\nassignments of error for our review.\n\n                    ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR 1\n        THE APPELLANT WAS DENIED DUE PROCESS AND A\n        FAIR TRIAL PURSUANT TO U.S. CONST.

Specifically, with regard to the Importuning conviction, Stober contends\n\nthat the State did not establish H.Z. was under 16 when she was receiving sexually\n\nsolicitous messages from Stober. With regard to the GSI convictions concerning\n\n                                      -17-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\nC.K. and H.Z., Stober argues that the State’s evidence as to the requisite element\n\nof “force” was insufficient.\n\n       {¶39} When an appellate court reviews a record for sufficiency, the\n\nrelevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to\n\nthe prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements\n\nof the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.

In addition, Stober\n\n                                       -18-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\nalso contends that it is not clear beyond a reasonable doubt that Stober ever\n\nsolicited H.Z. to engage in sexual conduct.\n\n      {¶42} At trial, H.Z. gave the following testimony.\n\n      Q [Prosecutor]: Was there ever a point when those text\n      messages began getting sexual?\n\n      A [H.Z.]: Yes.\n\n      Q: And do you recall when that was?\n\n      A: It was sophomore year during volleyball season when I was\n      dating my very first boyfriend.\n\n      Q: And while you were dating your very first boyfriend, the\n      defendant would text you sexually?\n\n      A:    Yes.\n\n      Q: And would that include what sort of references?\n\n      A: He basically would say that, you know, my boyfriend didn’t\n      deserve me; that he could do so much better; that guys in my\n      grade were immature, and that he is a mature kind of guy; and\n      he could show me what, you know, a true, like someone who –\n      someone who is like me, like how I should be treated.\n\n      Q: And would he speak sexually to [you]?\n\n      A: He would ask me like about my sex life and if, you know, if\n      I have done anything with him; and he would sometimes make\n      comments saying, well, let me know when this happens; let me\n      know, you know, when you do this for the first time.\n\n      Q: Did he ever make any comments via text messaging about\n      using his fingers on you?\n\n\n                                       -19-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\n       A:   Yes.\n\n       Q: And was that all of your sophomore year?\n\n       A:   Yes.\n\n       Q: And would he make any references to you performing oral\n       sex on him?\n\n       A:   That was not until junior year.\n\n       Q: So your sophomore year in the fall, there were references to\n       him penetrating you with his fingers?\n\n       A:   Yes.\n\n       Q: When is your birthday?\n\n       A:   January 16th.\n\n       Q: What Year?\n\n       A:   1994.\n\n       Q: And would that make you 15?\n\n       A:   Yes.\n\n       Q: Your Sophomore year?\n\n       A:   Yes.\n\n       Q: And that’s when you were receiving these text messages?\n\n       A:   Yes.\n\n(Tr. at 758-759).\n\n\n\n                                     -20-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\n       {¶43} On cross-examination, H.Z. was further questioned about these text\n\nmessages.\n\n       Q[Stober’s Counsel]: Okay. Okay. Now, when you say he\n       would talk to you about using his fingers and things of that\n       nature, was he telling you basically how things might happen\n       sexually?\n\n       A [H.Z.]: No. He said that he would use his fingers, not\n       somebody could use theirs. It was he using his.\n\n       Q: On who?\n\n       A:   On me.\n\n       Q: Okay. And this was your sophomore year?\n\n       A:   This was my sophomore year.\n\n       Q: And what was your response to that?\n\n       A: I didn’t really have a response. I mean, sometimes when he\n       – he said it more than once. There were times where I would\n       say, coach, you have a family, you have a wife. Other times I\n       would just let it go and say, ha ha, or, yeah, I guess, guess so.\n\n(Tr. at 830-831).\n\n       {¶44} Based on the foregoing testimony, we find that there was sufficient\n\ntestimony presented for a jury to have determined beyond a reasonable doubt that\n\nStober solicited sexual contact from H.Z. before she turned 16.        H.Z. was\n\nspecifically asked if Stober’s conversations regarding “using his fingers” on her\n\noccurred while she was 15 and she said that they did. Under these circumstances,\n\n\n                                      -21-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\nviewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, we find that a\n\nrational trier of fact could find all of the elements of Importuning proven beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.\n\n          Sufficiency of the Evidence for Stober’s GSI Convictions\n\n       {¶45} Stober was also convicted of three counts of GSI in violation of R.C.\n\n2907.05(A)(1), which reads as follows.\n\n       (A) No person shall have sexual contact with another, not the\n           spouse of the offender; cause another, not the spouse of the\n           offender, to have sexual contact with the offender; or cause\n           two or more other persons to have sexual contact when any\n           of the following applies:\n\n       (1) The offender purposely compels the other person, or one of\n           the other persons, to submit by force or threat of force.\n\n       {¶46} “Force,” for the purposes of GSI, is defined in R.C. 2901.01, as “any\n\nviolence, compulsion, or constraint physically exerted by any means upon or\n\nagainst a person or thing.” In order to prove force, the State “need not prove\n\nphysical resistance to the offender” in prosecutions for GSI. R.C. 2907.05(D).\n\n       {¶47} The Ohio Supreme Court has addressed the issue of “force” or\n\n“threat of force” in multiple cases. In State v.

State v. Dew, 7th\n\nDist. Mahoning No. 08 MA 62, 2009-Ohio-6537, ¶ 106, citing Dye at 55. In such\n\na case, the Court found that force or threat of force could be met “without\n\nevidence of express threat of harm or evidence of significant physical restraint.”\n\nId.\n\n\n\n                                        -23-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\n      {¶50} In interpreting this line of Ohio Supreme Court cases, and the\n\nappellate cases following them, the Seventh District Court of Appeals held in State\n\nv. Dew, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 08 MA 62, 2009-Ohio-6537, that force, for the\n\npurposes of Rape and GSI, is\n\n      “a relative term that depends on the totality of the circumstances\n      in a certain case.” State v. Rupp, 7th Dist. No. 05MA166, 2007–\n      Ohio–1561, at ¶ 49. Although the case law holds that a somewhat\n      lesser showing of force is required when the defendant stands in\n      a position of authority over the victim, the focus of the inquiry is\n      whether the victim's will was overcome by fear or duress.

(Count 4)\n\n        {¶53} Stober was convicted of one count of GSI with respect to C.K. At\n\ntrial, testimony was presented that C.K. was a student at Kalida wherein Stober\n\nwas a teacher and the technology coordinator.                       Although C.K. did not play\n\nvolleyball for Stober and did not take any of Stober’s classes, Stober did provide\n\npresentations to C.K. and her classmates in the classroom. Stober also implied\n\nthrough his testimony at trial that he viewed his relationship with C.K. as a\n\nteacher-student relationship.\n\n        Q: So again, you’re being a good person in trying to help out a\n        student [C.K.]?\n\n        A:     That’s what teachers do.\n\n(Tr. at 1343). This evidence would establish that Stober was, in fact, an authority\n\nfigure to C.K.\n\n        {¶54} Regarding the incident that led to this specific charge, C.K. testified\n\nthat at the end of her junior year of high school, she had to print an assignment\n\nwhile in school.8 (Tr. at 592). She testified that she tried to print the assignment\n\non the “art computer” but was unable to do so. (Id.) C.K. then attempted to print\n\n\n8\n  We would note that there was initially a discrepancy in C.K.’s testimony as to the timeframe when this\nincident happened. C.K. initially testified it was after June 2010, which would have been in her senior year\nof high school. However, later on cross-examination, C.K. corrected her earlier statement, clarifying\nmultiple times consistently that it was the end of her junior year of high school, prior to June 2010.\nUltimately, at the close of evidence, the State moved to amend Count 4 of the Indictment to include dates\nback to March, 2010, which would have covered the end of C.K.’s junior year, and comported with her\ntestimony. (Tr. at 1380). That amendment was granted. (Id.)\n\n                                                   -25-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\nthe assignment in the library, and was again unable to do so.

(Id. at 593).\n\n       {¶55} C.K. testified that she went into Stober’s office, opened up the file\n\nand attempted to print it. (Tr. at 594). She testified that it was just the two of\n\nthem in Stober’s office at the time, and that when she “stood up and turned\n\naround, he then grabbed [her] hand and put it on his penis.” (Tr. at 594). C.K.\n\ntestified that it was not voluntary, it happened quickly, and that she pulled her\n\nhand away. (Tr. at 566).\n\n       {¶56} The action described by C.K. has been found to be sufficient to\n\nsupport a GSI conviction. In State v. Steele, 5th Dist. No. 2011-CA-110, 2012-\n\nOhio-3777, the Fifth District Court of appeals held that testimony of a victim that\n\na defendant “grabbed her hand and pulled it over to his penis” constituted\n\nsufficient evidence for a reasonable person to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt\n\nthat a GSI had been committed. Steele at ¶¶ 53-56.\n\n       {¶57} Nevertheless, this is not the only incident mentioned in C.K.’s\n\ntestimony leading to the filing of Count 4 in the indictment. C.K. also testified\n\nthat on the day her senior class photo was taken, she was again alone with Stober\n\nin Stober’s office and he “grabbed [her] butt.” (Tr. at 565). C.K. testified that\n\nwhen Stober “grabbed [her] butt,” he was “[m]oaning and grumbling like he liked\n\nit.” (Tr. at 546).\n\n                                         -26-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\n       {¶58} C.K. testified at one point that Stober told her “not to tell anyone.”\n\n(Tr. at 567). However, it is unclear from the transcript whether this was in\n\nreference to the sexual text messages, the incidents leading to the GSI charge, the\n\nincident leading to the sexual battery charge, or in reference to a specific line of\n\nquestioning wherein C.K. testified that Stober sent her messages that he\n\nmasturbated in the bathroom while thinking of her. (Tr. at 566-567).\n\n       {¶59} C.K. testified that in her senior year she told her guidance counselor\n\nthat Stober was sending her text messages, but not the content of the messages.\n\n(Tr. at 559). She also testified that she told a man named Jeff Burke, who she\n\nlooked at like a “father figure” about the fact that Stober was sending her text\n\nmessages.       (Tr. at 558).   C.K. told Burke that the messages made her\n\nuncomfortable. (Id.)\n\n       {¶60} Burke testified that in the spring of C.K.’s junior year, C.K. confided\n\nin him that she was getting text messages and candy from Stober. (Tr. at 670).\n\nBurke testified that C.K. “didn’t appreciate” receiving the messages from Stober.\n\n(Id. at 671). He testified, however, that C.K. asked him to keep it confidential, so\n\nhe did. (Id.)\n\n       {¶61} C.K. testified that she did not report the sexual contact initially,\n\n“[b]ecause after I had told the guidance counselor that [Stober] was texting me,\n\nnothing, it wasn’t investigated, nothing was done about it, so I thought that nobody\n\n                                       -27-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\nreally cared.” (Tr. at 604). C.K. also testified that later, when being interviewed\n\nby the police, she was reluctant to disclose everything because she believed people\n\nwould blame her. (Tr. at 647). She also testified that she told investigating\n\nofficers that she felt she should have said no because she knew better. (Tr. at\n\n647).\n\n        {¶62} Based on the testimony and the totality of the circumstances, we find\n\nthat there was sufficient evidence to convict Stober of GSI of C.K. Force was\n\npresent during the incident where Stober caused C.K. to touch his penis. In\n\naddition, there was evidence presented from which a jury could reasonably\n\nconclude that C.K. was under a measure of duress, or compulsion, preventing her\n\nfrom revealing these incidents or resisting them, all of which is sufficient to allow\n\na jury to reasonably infer the presence of force as outlined above where the\n\nperpetrator is an authority figure.\n\nGSIs of H.Z. (Counts 6 and 7)\n\n        {¶63} Stober was convicted of two counts of GSI of victim H.Z. H.Z. was\n\na student in Stober’s classes, she played on Stober’s volleyball team from her\n\nsophomore through her senior year of high school, and she was also Stober’s\n\nneighbor. In addition, Stober testified that he played a father-figure role with H.Z.\n\n(Tr. at 1264-1265).\n\n\n\n                                        -28-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\n      {¶64} As stated above, Stober began sending H.Z. text messages as early as\n\nher seventh grade year, but the messages were originally about volleyball and did\n\nnot turn “sexual” in nature until her sophomore year. H.Z. testified that the\n\nmessages, including the sexual messages, continued into her junior and senior\n\nyears of high school.    H.Z. testified that she was struggling with emotional\n\nproblems, an eating disorder, depression, and suicidal thoughts. H.Z. testified that\n\nshe confided this to Stober. (Tr. at 778). H.Z. testified that occasionally her\n\nconversations with Stober concerned her eating disorder. (Id. at 780).\n\n      {¶65} H.Z. testified that she worked as an office aide in the high school\n\nalong with Carol Kahle, and Nancy Grote, who were high school secretaries. (Tr.\n\nat 779). H.Z. testified that Stober would often call her down to his office in the\n\nschool. (Tr. at 779). Nancy Grote testified that when Stober would call H.Z.\n\ndown to his office, her demeanor would change. (Tr. at 719-720). Grote testified\n\nthat prior to being called down to Stober’s office, H.Z. would be “chatty” and\n\n“happy.” (Tr. at 720). Grote testified that when H.Z. returned from going to\n\nStober’s office, she would be “quieter” and in one instance, “put her head down.”\n\n(Id.) Grote testified that it bothered her and Kahle, the other secretary. (Id.)\n\nGrote testified that after making these observations, she made an attempt to help\n\nH.Z. avoid going down to Stober’s office. (Tr. at 721). Grote testified that she\n\nwould send H.Z. on errands so that she did not have to go down to Stober’s office.\n\n                                       -29-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\n(Id.) Grote testified that, especially once volleyball season was over, H.Z. did not\n\nneed to go down to Stober’s office, yet H.Z. would state that she had to go, so she\n\nwould go. (Tr. at 721). These facts, along with Stober’s position as teacher and\n\ncoach of H.Z., and Stober’s comments about being a father figure to H.Z., are\n\nsufficient to support Stober being an authority figure to H.Z.\n\n       {¶66} H.Z. testified that the first incident leading to a GSI charge in the\n\nindictment occurred in the summer after her junior year, in June of 2011.\n\nRegarding this incident, H.Z. testified as follows.\n\n       That was when I had a volleyball camp form that was to be\n       turned in, and it was turned in late, and I had to go over to his\n       house to bring it to him; and I was getting ready to go over to a\n       friend’s house to go lay out and tan, so I had a swim suit on and\n       silky shorts and a cutoff.\n\n       And he came up to my window to get it, and he was also in his\n       swimsuit. I rolled my window down, and he – I held the paper\n       out; but he kind of reached in like acting as if the paper was in\n       there, and he grabbed my breast.\n\n       ***\n\n       Q: Did you stay at the residence or the driveway?\n\n       A: Until like he took his hand away and he kind of said, oops,\n       acting like he didn’t mean to do it, but I knew that he actually\n       did intend to. And then I just proceeded to say, all right, I’ve\n       got to go, I’m going to Jill’s house, and I left.\n\n(Tr. at 773-774). H.Z. testified that later that day she received text messages from\n\nStober wherein Stober stated he wished that H.Z. “would have came back and\n\n                                        -30-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\nskipped going to Jill’s house.” (Tr. at 774). Stober informed H.Z. that no one was\n\nhome at his residence at the time. (Id. at 775).\n\n       {¶67} Regarding the second incident leading to a GSI charge in the\n\nindictment, H.Z. testified that her senior year the text messages from Stober were\n\nmore sexual than ever. H.Z. testified to the following incident during the fall of\n\nher senior year, during volleyball season. (Tr. at 781).\n\n       He would always text me saying, prove to me that you’re fat.\n       One time I stood on a scale, sent a picture of the weight on the\n       scale to him. That wasn’t good enough. I went down to his\n       office one day, and he proceeded to ask me to lift my shirt up so\n       that he could see my stomach. And then he reached out and\n       grabbed it and touched it and moved his hand down to my\n       bottom and kind of laughed it off like it was no big deal.\n\n(Tr. at 780). H.Z. testified that she did not think it was innocent. (Id.)\n\n       {¶68} H.Z. testified that volleyball was a positive thing in her life, and she\n\nthought if she told her parents about Stober’s actions her sophomore, junior, or\n\nsenior years they would not have let her play volleyball. (Tr. at 789). H.Z.\n\ntestified that volleyball was worth it to her to not jeopardize by disclosing Stober’s\n\nactions. (Id.)\n\n       {¶69} In addition, H.Z. testified that she had other reservations about\n\ninitially disclosing the text messages and the physical contact from the incidents.\n\nShe testified,\n\n\n\n                                         -31-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\n       Two main [reasons] that come to my head would be that I would\n       have been benched on the court or that he would have played\n       one of his mind games with me like trying to get into my head\n       and then, you know, I would have a bad game so he would have\n       a reason to bench me.\n\n       Also, I, I hate being a person who would cause any problems in\n       someone else’s family if I did not have to, and I did not want that\n       to happen between him and his family and to have his kids have\n       to suffer going through a divorce, two parents going, you know,\n       where the dad – especially since I was in school and his oldest\n       son was also in school, like same school that I was. I would have\n       felt terrible if I would have been the person to break up his\n       parents.\n\n(Tr. at 789-790).\n\n       {¶70} In sum, Stober was an authority figure as teacher and as a coach of\n\nH.Z. in volleyball. Stober’s authority as H.Z.’s coach was part of the reason H.Z.\n\ntestified that she was unable to resist or report Stober’s actions earlier than she did.\n\nH.Z. also suffered from mental/emotional issues, and Stober was aware of and\n\ntook advantage of these conditions. Stober’s degree of control over H.Z was such\n\nthat she felt compelled to show up when Stober messaged her to report to his\n\noffice, as corroborated by the testimony from the secretaries that H.Z. did not want\n\nto go, and that going to Stober’s office clearly affected her mental state and\n\ndemeanor. In addition, like C.K., it is apparent that H.Z. feared revealing or\n\nresisting these incidents for multiple reasons. All of this evidence was clearly\n\n\n\n\n                                         -32-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\nsufficient to establish duress and compulsion in the context of an authority figure,\n\nwhich augments the physical force used to commit the GSIs against H.Z.\n\n       {¶71} Based on the entirety of the evidence and the totality of the\n\ncircumstances, we find that there was sufficient evidence in this case for the jury\n\nto find beyond a reasonable doubt that Stober committed GSIs as alleged in\n\nCounts 6, and 7. Accordingly, Stober’s first assignment of error is overruled.\n\n                              Second Assignment of Error\n\n       {¶72} In Stober’s second assignment of error, he argues that the trial court\n\nerred when it instructed the jury on “a lesser showing of force” that applies in a\n\ncoach/teacher relationship.\n\n       {¶73} At the outset, we would note that no objection was raised at the trial\n\non this issue, therefore, Stober has waived all but plain error. State v. Bustamante,\n\n3d Dist. Seneca No. 13-12-26, 2013-Ohio-4975, ¶ 15. In order to have plain error\n\nunder Crim.R. 52(B) there must be an error, the error must be an “obvious” defect\n\nin the trial proceedings, and the error must have affected “substantial rights.” State\n\nv. Barnes, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 27 (2002). Plain error is to be used “‘with the utmost\n\ncaution, under exceptional circumstances and only to prevent a manifest\n\nmiscarriage of justice.’” Id. quoting State v. Long, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">91</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1978),\n\nparagraph three of the syllabus.\n\n       {¶74} In this case, the trial court gave the following instruction on “Force.”\n\n                                         -33-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\n          Force means any violence, compulsion, or constraint physically\n          exerted by any means upon or against a person or thing.\n\n          When the relationship between the victim and the Defendant is\n          one of child and coach, or teacher, the element of force need not\n          be openly displayed or physically brutal. It can be slight or\n          psychological. Evidence of an expressed threat of harm, or\n          evidence of significant physical restraint is not required. If you\n          find that beyond a reasonable doubt that under the\n          circumstances in evidence, the victim’s will was overcome by\n          fear or duress, the element of force has been proved.\n\n(Tr. at 1455).\n\n          {¶75} Despite Stober’s arguments, the trial court’s jury instructions were\n\ntaken directly from the Ohio Jury Instructions and adequately reflect the law as\n\nsummarized in the preceding assignment of error regarding “force” when an\n\nauthority figure is present. Therefore, we cannot find error, let alone plain error.\n\nAccordingly, Stober’s assignment of error is overruled.\n\n                              Third Assignment of Error\n\n          {¶76} In Stober’s third assignment of error, he argues that Stober’s\n\nconvictions for Sexual Battery and GSI concerning C.K. were against the manifest\n\nweight of the evidence.        Specifically, Stober argues that C.K.’s testimony\n\nregarding the Sexual Battery and GSI incidents was vague and unbelievable, and\n\nthat given C.K.’s age at the time of the offense, she would have remembered more\n\ndetail.\n\n\n\n                                         -34-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\n       {¶77} The Ohio Supreme Court has “carefully distinguished the terms\n\n‘sufficiency’ and ‘weight’ in criminal cases, declaring that ‘manifest weight’ and\n\n‘legal sufficiency’ are ‘both quantitatively and qualitatively different.’” Eastley v.\n\nVolkman, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">328</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2012–Ohio–2179, ¶ 10, quoting State v. Thompkins,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">380</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1997), paragraph two of the syllabus.\n\n       {¶78} Unlike our review of the sufficiency of the evidence, an appellate\n\ncourt's function when reviewing the weight of the evidence is to determine\n\nwhether the greater amount of credible evidence supports the verdict. Volkman,\n\nsupra, at ¶ 12; Thompkins, supra, at 387. In reviewing whether the trial court's\n\njudgment was against the weight of the evidence, the appellate court sits as a\n\n“thirteenth juror” and examines the conflicting testimony. Thompkins at 387. In\n\ndoing so, this Court must review the entire record, weigh the evidence and all of\n\nthe reasonable inferences, consider the credibility of witnesses, and determine\n\nwhether in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the factfinder “clearly lost its way\n\nand created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be\n\nreversed and a new trial ordered.” Thompkins at 387.\n\n       {¶79} Stober argues that his convictions for Sexual Battery and GSI of\n\nvictim C.K. were against the manifest weight of the evidence. GSI in violation of\n\nR.C. 2907.05(A)(1) has been defined previously. Sexual Battery is defined in\n\nR.C. 2907.03, and reads, in pertinent part, as follows.\n\n                                        -35-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\n      (A) No person shall engage in sexual conduct with another, not\n          the spouse of the offender, when any of the following apply:\n\n       ***\n\n       (7) The offender is a teacher, administrator, coach, or other\n       person in authority employed by or serving in a school for which\n       the state board of education prescribes minimum standards\n       pursuant to division (D) of section 3301.07 of the Revised Code,\n       the other person is enrolled in or attends that school, and the\n       offender is not enrolled in and does not attend that school.\n\nSexual Battery\n\n       {¶80} In this case, Stober contends that C.K. was 20 years old at the time of\n\ntrial and “[y]et, her testimony was vague and incredible in regard to salient details\n\nthat persons exposed to sexual acts would know.” (Appt.’s Br. 14).\n\n       {¶81} At trial, C.K. testified that approximately a week before the alleged\n\nsexual intercourse took place, Stober began asking C.K. about her parents’\n\nschedule. (Tr. at 547). According to C.K., her father, who she lived with, worked\n\nthird shift. (Tr. at 548). C.K. testified that in June of 2010, “about a week” after\n\nshe had given Stober her father’s work schedule, Stober showed up at her\n\nresidence at approximately 4 a.m. (Tr. at 550).\n\n       {¶82} C.K. testified she was sleeping on her living room couch and was\n\nawakened by knocking at the door. (Tr. at 550). She testified that she went to the\n\ndoor, and looked outside, and saw Stober “standing in the corner [of her porch]\n\nwith his bike.” (Tr. at 551). C.K. testified that Stober was wearing a “T-shirt and\n\n                                        -36-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\nshorts.” (Tr. at 551). C.K. later clarified on cross-examination that Stober was\n\nwearing “khaki or jean” shorts because they were not “mesh soft shorts” and that\n\nhis shorts had a “Zipper and snap/button.” (Tr. at 601).\n\n       {¶83} C.K. testified that, “I opened the door, and I peeked my head around\n\nthe corner; and I seen him, and I froze. And he had stepped forward into the\n\nhouse, pushing me backwards down onto the couch. Then he started feeling up\n\nmy shirt and down my shorts, was kissing me. Proceeded to take my shorts off,\n\nstuck his fingers inside me and then his penis.” (Tr. at 551-552).\n\n       {¶84} C.K. clarified on cross-examination that when she said that Stober\n\npushed her backwards she meant pushing “as in a way of forcing, I guess, without\n\ntouching me. He was close to me, backing me, walking towards me, and I’m\n\nbacking up backwards.” (Tr. at 607-608). C.K. testified that “[Stober] pretty\n\nmuch pinned [her] until [she] * * * was down on the couch.” (Tr. at 608). C.K.\n\ntestified that because Stober had backed her up so she “couldn’t do anything” she\n\nfelt as though Stober had pushed her. (Tr. at 609). C.K. testified that she was “too\n\nscared” to tell Stober “no.” (Tr. at 552).\n\n       {¶85} C.K. also testified that she tried “[s]cooting out from under” Stober,\n\nbut that she did not push him away forcefully. (Tr. at 627). C.K. further testified\n\nthat though she did not forcefully try to get up, “in [her] head [she] * * * wanted to\n\n\n\n                                         -37-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\nget up.” (Tr. at 627). C.K. testified that after Stober was finished he pulled up his\n\nshorts and walked out of the door, without any conversation. (Tr. at 553).\n\n       {¶86} Of this incident, Stober simply testified that he did not have sex with\n\nC.K., and that he had never been to C.K.’s father’s residence.\n\n       {¶87} On appeal, Stober argues that C.K.’s testimony regarding the\n\nincident of sexual intercourse leading to the Sexual Battery conviction was not\n\ncredible because C.K. “could not remember” whether Stober wore a condom, or\n\nwhether Stober ejaculated inside her. Stober also contends that C.K.’s claim that\n\nno words were spoken at the time of the incident was not credible.\n\n       {¶88} Despite Stober’s characterizations on appeal, C.K. specifically\n\ntestified that Stober “did not” wear a condom and she knew because Stober “didn’t\n\nput anything on.” (Tr. at 553). She also testified that she “assume[d]” Stober\n\nejaculated inside of her. (Tr. at 553). C.K. testified specifically that she had “tried\n\nblocking that day out [of her memory] as much as [she] can.” (Tr. at 632).\n\nNevertheless, C.K. gave testimony that was consistent on direct and cross-\n\nexamination regarding this incident. In addition, the jury was fully able to see and\n\nhear her testimony, as well as Stober’s denial of the incident, and weigh the\n\ncredibility of these witnesses. The jury was free to find Stober’s denials to be\n\ndisingenuous, and/or otherwise evaluate Stober’s testimony. Under these facts and\n\ncircumstances, we cannot find that the jury clearly lost its way on this issue.\n\n                                         -38-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\nGSI\n\n       {¶89} Stober also argues that his conviction for GSI related to C.K. was\n\nagainst the manifest weight of the evidence. Stober argues that because C.K.\n\ncould not remember whether Stober’s penis was erect, her testimony was not\n\ncredible. However, C.K. testified that her back was turned when Stober pulled out\n\nhis penis. (Tr. at 595). C.K. testified that when she turned back toward Stober,\n\nStober grabbed her hand and put it on his penis. (Tr. at 595). C.K. testified that\n\nshe jerked her hand away, grabbed her “thumb drive” and walked out. (Tr. at\n\n595). C.K. also testified to the incident wherein Stober “grabbed” her butt and\n\nmoaned while doing so.\n\n       {¶90} In contravention of C.K.’s testimony, Stober claimed that the\n\nincidents did not happen. (Tr. at 1289).\n\n       {¶91} The GSI conviction turned on the credibility of C.K.’s testimony and\n\nthe credibility of Stober’s denial at trial. The jury was in a far better position to\n\nmake a credibility determination on these issues than the appellate court is, and we\n\ncannot find that under these circumstances, the jury clearly lost its way or that\n\nthere was a “manifest miscarriage of justice.”         Accordingly, Stober’s third\n\nassignment of error is overruled.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -39-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\n                                Fourth Assignment of Error\n\n       {¶92} In Stober’s fourth assignment of error, he argues that the trial court\n\nerred in denying Stober’s motion to sever the counts against the various alleged\n\nvictims into separate trials.\n\n       {¶93} The joinder of offenses is governed by Crim.R. 8(A) which provides:\n\n       Two or more offenses may be charged in the same indictment * *\n       * if the offenses charged * * * are of the same or similar\n       character, or are based on the same act or transaction, or are\n       based on two or more acts or transactions connected together or\n       constituting parts of a common scheme or plan, or are part of a\n       course of criminal conduct.\n\n       {¶94} “‘It is well-established that the law favors joinder because the\n\navoidance of multiple trials conserves time and expense and minimizes the\n\npotentially incongruous outcomes that can result from successive trials before\n\ndifferent juries.’” State v.

Adams, 62 Ohio\n\nSt.2d 151, 157 (1980).\n\n      {¶100} In this case, Stober made a motion for relief from prejudicial\n\njoinder prior to trial, and this motion was denied. Stober renewed his motion at\n\ntrial multiple times, and was denied each time.\n\n      {¶101} The jury in this case acquitted Stober of multiple counts, including\n\ncounts related to separate victims. The jury acquitted Stober of his only charge\n\nagainst J.L., acquitted Stober of the charge of Attempted Sexual Battery against\n\n                                       -42-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\nH.Z., and then also acquitted Stober of the charge of Tampering with Evidence.

Thus Stober was, in\n\neffect, acquitted of some accusations related to each alleged victim, showing that\n\nthe evidence was simple and direct and that the jury was able to segregate proof\n\nfor each offense. Under these circumstances, we fail to see how Stober is able to\n\nestablish any prejudice considering the jury was clearly able to discern the\n\nseparate crimes and did not appear to be biased by the testimony from the other\n\nincidents.\n\n       {¶102} Moreover, the testimony of the other victims could have been\n\nadmissible in each other’s trials under Evid.R. 404(B) to show motive, intent,\n\nplan, or scheme. As the evidence could have been admissible in separate trials, we\n\nagain cannot find that the trial court erred.\n\n       {¶103} Accordingly, Stober’s fourth assignment of error is overruled.\n\n\n                              Fifth Assignment of Error\n\n       {¶104} In Stober’s fifth assignment of error, he argues that the trial court\n\nimproperly allowed witnesses to testify in contravention of Evid.R. 404(B).\n\nSpecifically, Stober argues that the trial court improperly allowed the testimony of\n\nfive witnesses in this case.

Smith, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 79936, 2002-Ohio-3114, at ¶ 30.\n\n        {¶110} On appeal, Stober argues that the testimony of five of the State’s\n\nwitnesses was inadmissible at trial under Evid.R. 404(B). We will address each in\n\nturn.\n\nLori Fisher\n\n        {¶111} First, Stober argues that Lori Fisher’s testimony was impermissible\n\nunder 404(B) and the Rape Shield Statute.         Stober contends that Fisher’s\n\ntestimony did not concern evidence of pregnancy, semen, or disease and therefore\n\nwas not permissible.\n\n        {¶112} Fisher testified that she was a teacher at Kalida, and on cross-\n\nexamination she testified that she had been having an ongoing affair with Stober\n\nfor over a decade. The State elicited testimony from Fisher about text messages\n\nthat she exchanged with Stober, which were within minutes of text messages\n\nStober exchanged with H.Z. and C.K. The State offered this evidence to show that\n\nit must have been Stober that was in possession of his phone at the time these\n\nmessages were sent.\n\n        {¶113} In addition, Fisher offered testimony that Stober had told her he\n\ncould no longer have children, which was similar to a message C.K. said she had\n\nreceived from Stober. (Tr. at 675).\n\n                                       -46-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\n         {¶114} Prior to Fisher’s testimony, Stober’s counsel specifically stated that\n\nhe did not intend to object to Fisher as a 404(B) witness. On cross-examination,\n\nStober’s counsel drew out the fact that Fisher thought Stober was a good listener,\n\nthat he was caring, and that she made the first advance on him. (Tr. at 690).\n\nFisher also testified on cross, when prompted by Stober’s attorney, that Stober was\n\nalways “worried about his ability to please. [Stober] made references that he\n\nwould like to have been able to take a male enhancement pill, but didn’t know\n\nhow he could take it without his wife finding out.” (Tr. at 692). Stober’s counsel\n\nused this testimony to contradict the testimony of H.Z. and C.K. C.K. testified she\n\nreceived a text message from Stober wherein Stober stated “he would be so big he\n\nwould tear [C.K.] up.” (Tr. at 545). H.Z. later testified that she received a\n\nmessage from Stober wherein Stober stated “he was so big he could tear [her].”\n\n(Tr. at 791).\n\n         {¶115} Moreover, it became clear later when Stober took the stand and\n\ntestified that he had made the “masturbation” video for Fisher, that Stober’s\n\ncounsel brought in the information regarding their affair to attempt to support that\n\nclaim.\n\n         {¶116} Thus not only did the State have legitimate purposes for calling\n\nFisher, but Stober’s counsel had legitimate reasons for wanting her testimony to be\n\n\n\n                                         -47-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\nentered into evidence. Under these circumstances, we cannot find that there was\n\nany error, let alone plain error in allowing her testimony.\n\n\n\nJenna Missler\n\n       {¶117} Stober next argues that the testimony of Jenna Missler was\n\nimproper under Evid.R. 404(B). Stober argues that Missler was an adult teacher,\n\nand not a student, and thus her testimony was unrelated to the testimony of the\n\nyounger, student victims.\n\n       {¶118} Missler gave testimony that she was a Spanish teacher at Kalida and\n\nthat she received instant messages from Stober. (Tr. at 484). Missler testified that\n\nthe messages began about work, but then became more personal. (Tr. at 484).\n\nThose messages contained Stober’s use of a “smiley face,” which she described as\n\na characteristic of Stober’s messaging.        Missler testified that the comments\n\neventually crossed the line with her and that she spoke to the sexual harassment\n\ncoordinator about the messages Stober had sent her. The messages were entered\n\ninto evidence as an exhibit. (State’s Ex. 20).\n\n       {¶119} On cross-examination, Stober’s counsel went through the alleged\n\nharassing messages from Stober.       The messages begin by showing Stober as\n\nhelpful, and supportive. (State’s Ex. 20). They also show Stober being helpful to\n\nMissler with her problems at school. (Id.) The messages which Missler stated\n\n                                        -48-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\n“crossed the line” were when Stober said “and may I add your husband must be\n\none lucky man…. :),” and “because you seem to look amazing in just about\n\neverything…. that dress yesterday was extremely nice…. :).”           (Id.)   Stober’s\n\ncounsel made it clear that those messages were the extent of Stober’s\n\n“inappropriate” comments to Missler.        As the remainder of the conversation\n\nbetween Stober and Missler showed Stober being helpful to Missler, this\n\ntestimony furthered Stober’s counsel’s trial strategy of painting the prosecution of\n\nStober as a “witch hunt.”\n\n       {¶120} Missler’s testimony may have had less of a connection to any of the\n\nindicted charges than any of the other non-victim witnesses. Nevertheless, the\n\nState had some legitimate basis for introducing Missler’s testimony, and Stober’s\n\ncounsel also cross-examined Missler in a manner that was consistent with, and\n\neven furthered, his trial strategy.    Accordingly, we cannot find any error in\n\nallowing this testimony. However, even if there was error, trial counsel’s cross-\n\nexamination of Missler certainly minimized any potential claim of prejudice and\n\nwe thus cannot find any reversible error in permitting this witness to testify.\n\nMary Lynn Kahle\n\n       {¶121} Stober next argues that Mary Lynn Kahle’s testimony was\n\nimpermissible under Evid.R. 404(B). Kahle testified that she was a volleyball\n\nplayer for Stober, that Stober added her on ICQ chat, and engaged her in\n\n                                         -49-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\nconversations, which eventually turned personal. (Tr. at 342-343). Stober told\n\nKahle that he could see himself in a relationship with her. (Tr. at 344). On cross-\n\nexamination Stober’s counsel elicited testimony that Stober never tried to\n\nphysically touch Kahle, furthering his argument that the State was conducting a\n\nwitch hunt, and that the State was trying to liken the case to “Jerry Sandusky”\n\nwhen the evidence did not support such a comparison. (Tr. at 353); (Tr. at 292).\n\n       {¶122} Moreover, we must note that this testimony, while remote in time to\n\nthe charges involving victims C.K. and H.Z., carried a much closer proximity and\n\nsimilarity to the indicted charge involving victim J.L. in 2001. As there is some\n\nbasis for allowing the testimony, and it was clearly used and not objected to as part\n\nof Stober’s counsel’s trial strategy, we cannot find that there was error here, let\n\nalone plain error.\n\nKaren Fortman\n\n       {¶123} Stober next contends that the testimony of Karen Fortman was\n\nimpermissible under Evid.R. 404(B). Fortman testified that in 1995 she was a\n\nstudent in Stober’s classes, and that Stober made a “spectacle” out of her.\n\nFortman testified that she then asked to be removed from Stober’s class in the\n\nfuture. Fortman testified that Stober subsequently called her into his office, shut\n\nthe door, and told her that when he looked at her, he saw someone he would like to\n\n\n\n                                        -50-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\nbe married to. On cross-examination, Fortman admitted that there was no sexual\n\ncontact between her and Stober.\n\n       {¶124} The State again argues that this testimony was permissible to show\n\nStober’s motive, intent, scheme, plan, or preparation in using his position in the\n\nschool to target these girls for sexual advances.\n\n       {¶125} Again, while remote in time to the incidents with C.K. and H.Z.,\n\nthere is a similarity in Stober’s approach to all three victims and a proximity in\n\ntime to the charge involving J.L.       As there is some basis for allowing the\n\ntestimony, and it was again clearly used as part of Stober’s counsel’s trial strategy,\n\nwe cannot find that there was error here, let alone plain error.\n\nJ.L.\n\n       {¶126} Lastly, Stober argues that some of J.L.’s testimony was\n\nimpermissible at trial. The testimony Stober finds objectionable is when J.L.\n\ntestified that while working as a substitute, Stober came into her room and asked\n\nJ.L. “weren’t you going to wait for me?” (Tr. at 373).\n\n       {¶127} The State maintains that this testimony was permissible to help\n\nretroactively corroborate and confirm J.L’s allegation that Stober had a “sexual”\n\ninterest in J.L. when he had contact with her as a student several years earlier,\n\nwhich led to the filing of the GSI charge in Count 2. We agree. Thus the State\n\nhad some legitimate basis for introducing this evidence.\n\n                                         -51-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\n       {¶128} Nevertheless, even if the testimony was impermissible, Stober is\n\nunable to establish any prejudice, as Stober was acquitted of the count relating to\n\nJ.L., showing that the jury was not biased by this evidence.\n\n       {¶129} Accordingly, as we have not found any prejudicial error in the\n\ntestimony of these witnesses, Stober’s fifth assignment of error is overruled.\n\n                             Sixth Assignment of Error\n\n       {¶130} In Stober’s sixth assignment of error, he argues that the prosecutor\n\ncommitted misconduct during the trial. Specifically, Stober contends that the\n\nprosecutor repeatedly expressed his opinion that Stober was a liar during closing\n\narguments, that the prosecutor urged jurors to put themselves in the place of the\n\nalleged victims, that the prosecutor sought to evoke sympathy for the victims, that\n\nthe prosecutor elicited testimony as to whether they believed various witnesses,\n\nand that the prosecutor improperly informed the jury on the element of force.\n\n       {¶131} In reviewing claims of prosecutorial misconduct, the test is whether\n\nthe prosecutor's remarks were improper and, if so, whether those comments\n\nprejudicially affected the substantial rights of the defendant.

He lied to you about\n      getting the information from Nancy, [J.L.]’s mom. He lied to\n      you about his conversations with Jim McBride, and some\n      concern about an injury. He lied to you about Lori Fisher, and\n      that his intent behind the masturbation video, is that it go to her.\n      And you know he lied to you, because she – she said so. She said,\n      he never said that to me.\n\n      ***\n\n      And he tried to explain text messages and records and give you\n      his thoughts on those. Then he had to acknowledge he wasn’t\n      right at all about that, once I started going through the details of\n      those records with him. And he said to you, yeah, [H.Z] and I\n      texted on November 16th, 2011, because she needed a ride, and it\n      was a last-minute thing, so that’s why I took her and that’s in\n      there. When he made that statement, he didn’t realize that the\n      record was going to be shown to him. And when it was, he had\n      to backtrack, because he lied to you.\n\n(Tr. at 1414-1416).\n\n      {¶135} While Stober argues that these statements were improper, witnesses\n\ndid give testimony that directly contradicted Stober’s testimony on the stand. As\n\nthe prosecutor is entitled to urge the jury to make reasonable inferences from the\n\nevidence, we cannot find that it was improper for the State to argue that Stober\n\nwas lying in these specific circumstances.\n\n\n                                       -54-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\n         {¶136} Stober next contends that the prosecutor improperly “repeatedly\n\ntried to have the jurors put themselves in the place of an alleged assault or in the\n\nplace [of] the alleged victims.” (Appt.’s Br. at 24). Stober cites the following\n\nsegments as being improper.\n\n         She had to announce the homecoming court later that night, and\n         she recalls with clarity these details, as would you, if it happened\n         to you.\n\n(Tr. at 1408).\n\n         ***\n\n         And where do these offenses take place? Within the privacy of a\n         closed space, of a room, where there aren’t witnesses. And if\n         that wasn’t sufficient for a conviction, we wouldn’t have\n         convictions in this country for people who commit sex offenses.\n         If that wasn’t sufficient, you could be grabbed inappropriately,\n         when no one is around, and no one could do anything about that,\n         but that’s not how our system works.\n\n(Tr. at 1409).\n\n         Because if you’re grabbed, or you’re touched sexually, that case\n         can’t be prosecuted, can it? If you’re touched sexually, and no\n         one is present, people aren’t present when these things happen,\n         God help us all, because I can’t get justice for you.9\n\n(Tr. at 1440).\n\n         And if this is not sufficient to establish force, again, God help us\n         all, because if someone comes up to you and grabs your breast,\n\n\n9\n It should be noted that the Prosecutor used this phrase “God help us all” after defense counsel stated in his\nclosing argument, “[a]nd this is my final comment to you, and I go back to my opening, if this is proof\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, heaven help us all.” (Tr. at 1439).\n\n                                                    -55-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\n       or your butt, and you don’t want it, and you’re not asking for it\n       * * *[.]\n\n(Tr. at 1443).\n\n       {¶137} After reviewing the passages, we find nothing improper by the\n\nprosecutor for several reasons. First, as part of Stober’s trial strategy, he painted\n\nthe State’s case as a “witch hunt” and challenged the authenticity of the alleged\n\nvictim’s testimony relating to the incidents that happened without corroborating\n\nwitnesses. The prosecutor’s statements in closing argument were in response to\n\nthat line of questioning. Second, in the latter two cited portions, the prosecutor\n\nwas merely responding to defense counsel’s closing argument that the victims’\n\nword alone was not enough to reach the high bar of beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nThus, we cannot find that these statements were improper. However, even if they\n\nwere improper, we cannot find that these statements, when taken in context of the\n\nentire trial, deprived Stober of a fair trial.\n\n       {¶138} Stober next contends that the prosecutor “sought to evoke sympathy\n\nfor the alleged victims.”      After reviewing the transcript, we do not find the\n\nprosecutor’s statements to be improper when viewed in context. For example,\n\nStober argues that the prosecutor improperly stated in closing argument that Karen\n\nFortman “squirmed in her seat” and “she had to pull it together” after meeting\n\nalone with Stober.       Notwithstanding Stober’s argument, this is an accurate\n\n\n                                           -56-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\nreflection of the transcript, where Fortman testified that she was “obviously”\n\nsquirming in her seat during the incident, and that she was “extremely”\n\nuncomfortable. (Tr. at 317). Fortman also testified that she had to pull herself\n\ntogether to announce the homecoming court later on the night of the incident. (Tr.\n\nat 320). Therefore, the prosecutor’s statements were a proper characterization of\n\nthe testimony. We similarly find that the remaining incidents cited by Stober are\n\nnot improper when taken in context.\n\n       {¶139} Stober next argues that the prosecutor improperly elicited testimony\n\nfrom various witnesses during the trial as to “whether they believed and/or\n\nsupported the alleged victims.” (Appt’s Br. at 24). After reviewing the transcript,\n\nwe do not find any of the incidents cited by Stober to be error. For example,\n\nStober contends that Jeff Burke was simply a vouching witness. However, Burke\n\ntestified that C.K. confided in him long before the allegations in this case were\n\nmade that she was receiving unwanted messages from a teacher.              Burke’s\n\ntestimony countered Stober’s counsel’s cross examination of C.K., wherein\n\nStober’s counsel challenged C.K.’s reasoning for not coming forward earlier.\n\n       {¶140} In addition, Stober argues that Detective Roy Sargent was\n\nimproperly asked about other females who came forward in the investigation and\n\ndiscussed inappropriate messages from Stober. However, Detective Sargent was\n\nonly asked about the other females after Stober’s counsel raised the issue, bringing\n\n                                       -57-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\nup a search warrant that mentioned other potential victims existed. We find that\n\nthis incident, and the remaining incidents cited by Stober were not improper when\n\ntaken in context.\n\n       {¶141} Finally, Stober argues that the prosecutor improperly stated\n\nincorrect definitions of the law regarding force during closing arguments.\n\nNotwithstanding the prosecutor’s statements during closing argument, which we\n\nfind consistent with the standards discussed previously, the jury was instructed\n\nthat closing arguments were not evidence.           In addition, we have already\n\ndetermined that the trial court’s actual jury instructions on force were proper in the\n\ncontext of this case. Thus, having reviewed the prosecutor’s statements on force,\n\nwe cannot find any error that would rise to the level of prejudicial misconduct.\n\n       {¶142} In sum, after reviewing the entire record and the arguments made\n\nby Stober, we cannot find that prosecutorial misconduct was present in this case.\n\nAccordingly, Stober’s sixth assignment of error is overruled.\n\n                            Seventh Assignment of Error\n\n       {¶143} In Stober’s seventh assignment of error, he argues that he was\n\ndenied his right to effective assistance of counsel. “Reversal of convictions on\n\nineffective assistance requires the defendant to show ‘first that counsel’s\n\nperformance was deficient and, second that the deficient performance prejudiced\n\nthe defense so as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial.’” State v. Cassano, 96\n\n                                        -58-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\nOhio St.3d 94, 2002-Ohio-3751 at ¶105, quoting Strickland v.

First, Stober argues that his trial counsel\n\nwas ineffective for failing to object to the “404(B) witnesses” discussed in the fifth\n\nassignment of error.     As we have already found that the testimony of these\n\nwitnesses was permissible, and that in any event, there was no resulting prejudice,\n\nwe cannot find that Stober’s counsel was ineffective for failing to object. This is\n\n                                         -59-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\nparticularly true in light of the fact that Stober’s counsel clearly wanted to make an\n\nissue of these witnesses having not been physically touched by Stober, in an\n\nattempt to paint the State’s case as a “witch hunt” and a misguided attempt by the\n\nState to compare Stober to Jerry Sandusky.\n\n       {¶146} Stober next argues that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing\n\nto object to leading questions used by the State throughout the trial.      Evidence\n\nRule 611(C) provides that “[l]eading questions should not be used on the direct\n\nexamination of a witness except as may be necessary to develop his testimony.”\n\nThis broad exception places the decision of whether to allow leading questions\n\nwithin the sound discretion of the trial court. State v. Jackson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n449 (2001); State v. Jefferson, 2d Dist. Greene No. 2002 CA 26, 2002-Ohio-6377,\n\n¶ 9. As a result, the Ohio Supreme Court has held that the failure to object to\n\nleading questions does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. Jackson,\n\nsupra, at 449; State v. Fraker, 3d Dist. Union No. 14-12-19, 2013-Ohio-4561, ¶\n\n59. Thus we cannot find that any failure to object to any leading questions would\n\nrise to the level of ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\n       {¶147} Stober next argues that his counsel was ineffective for failing to\n\nobject to “vouching,” “demeanor” and “sympathy” testimony from numerous\n\nprosecution witnesses. However, we have already discussed that it was not error\n\nfor the prosecutor to elicit the testimony cited by Stober under the sixth\n\n                                          -60-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\nassignment of error. Therefore, we cannot find his counsel ineffective for failing\n\nto object to this testimony.\n\n       {¶148} Finally, Stober argues that his trial counsel was ineffective for\n\nfailing to object “to rampant hearsay and other improper testimonies.” (Appt’s Br.\n\nat 29). Stober cites only one example of “rampant hearsay.” As support, he\n\nclaims that when Amy Recker was on the stand, Stober’s counsel was ineffective\n\nfor failing to object to Recker’s testimony that H.Z. was “depressed,” “sad,” and\n\nwas in therapy. At this point in the trial, H.Z. had already testified to severe\n\nemotional problems, which ultimately led to her hospitalization.           Even if the\n\ntestimony was impermissible, it was merely cumulative to other testimony, and\n\nthus would not be prejudicial. Accordingly, we cannot find that the testimony was\n\nprejudicial, or that Stober’s counsel was ineffective for failing to object to it.\n\n       {¶149} In sum, after reviewing the transcripts and the arguments made by\n\nStober, we cannot find that his counsel was ineffective. Accordingly, Stober’s\n\nseventh assignment of error is overruled.\n\n                               Eighth Assignment of Error\n\n       {¶150} In Stober’s eighth assignment of error, he argues that the trial court\n\nfailed to make the necessary findings under R.C. 2929.14(C) for the imposition of\n\nmaximum, consecutive sentences.\n\n\n\n                                          -61-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\n      {¶151} “A trial court’s sentence will not be disturbed on appeal absent a\n\ndefendant’s showing by clear and convincing evidence that the sentence is\n\nunsupported by the record; the sentencing statutes’ procedure was not followed or\n\nthere was not a sufficient basis for the imposition of a prison term; or that the\n\nsentence is contrary to law.” State v.

While the trial court is required to\n\n                                        -62-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\nmake the specific findings, it is not required to list its reasoning for making the\n\nfindings. State v. Hill, 3d Dist. No. 7-12-11, 2013-Ohio-3873, ¶ 22. Nevertheless,\n\nwith respect to the issues raised in this case R.C. 2929.14(C)(4) states,\n\n       (4) If multiple prison terms are imposed on an offender for\n       convictions of multiple offenses, the court may require the\n       offender to serve the prison terms consecutively if the court finds\n       that the consecutive service is necessary to protect the public\n       from future crime or to punish the offender and that consecutive\n       sentences are not disproportionate to the seriousness of the\n       offender's conduct and to the danger the offender poses to the\n       public, and if the court also finds any of the following:\n\n       (a) The offender committed one or more of the multiple\n           offenses while the offender was awaiting trial or sentencing,\n           was under a sanction imposed pursuant to section 2929.16,\n           2929.17, or 2929.18 of the Revised Code, or was under post-\n           release control for a prior offense.\n\n       (b) At least two of the multiple offenses were committed as part\n           of one or more courses of conduct, and the harm caused by\n           two or more of the multiple offenses so committed was so\n           great or unusual that no single prison term for any of the\n           offenses committed as part of any of the courses of conduct\n           adequately reflects the seriousness of the offender's\n           conduct.\n\n       (c) The offender’s history of criminal conduct demonstrates\n           that consecutive sentences are necessary to protect the\n           public from future crime by the offender.\n\n       {¶153} Thus, based on the statute, the trial court is required to make three\n\nfindings before imposing consecutive sentences: 1) that consecutive sentences are\n\nnecessary to protect the public from the future crime or to punish the offender; 2)\n\n\n                                        -63-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\nthat consecutive sentences are not disproportionate to the seriousness of the\n\noffender’s conduct and to the danger the offender poses to the public; and 3) that\n\none of the subsections (a), (b), or (c) apply. State v. Farnsworth, 10th Dist.\n\nFranklin No. 12CO10, 2013-Ohio-1275, ¶ 8.\n\n       {¶154} In this case, the trial court’s judgment entry states as follows.\n\n       The Court has considered the record, oral statements,\n       Defendant’s pre-sentence investigation report, as well as the\n       principles and purposes of sentencing under Ohio Revised Code\n       Section 2929.11 & 2929.12. The Court finds consecutive\n       sentences are necessary to protect the public and punish the\n       Offender, and are not disproportionate. The Court further finds\n       that the convictions are sex offenses.\n\n(Doc. 188). It is clear from the judgment entry that the trial court made the first\n\nrequired finding, and at least used some of the language of the second required\n\nfinding, but it did not make any reference to any of the subsections (a), (b), or (c),\n\nof R.C. 2929.14(C)(4) that applied, either by utilizing any of the language of the\n\nstatutory subsection, or by using similar language.\n\n       {¶155} At the sentencing hearing, the trial court went further than it did in\n\nits entry.\n\n       The Court finds that consecutive sentences are necessary to\n       protect the public and to punish the offender, are not\n       disproportionate to the counts found guilty by the verdict. The\n       Court finds that the harm is so great or unusual that a single\n       prison term does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the\n       content [sic].\n\n\n                                        -64-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\n(Mar. 18, 2013 Tr. at 20). Thus, at the hearing, the trial court more clearly\n\nreferenced the first two findings it is required to make, and utilized some of the\n\nlanguage from subsection (b). However, despite utilizing some of the language of\n\nsubsection (b), the trial court still did not make any finding as to whether “[a]t\n\nleast two of the multiple offenses were committed as part of one or more courses\n\nof conduct[.]”\n\n        {¶156} In State v. Venes, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 98682, 2013–Ohio–1891,\n\nthe Eighth District held,\n\n        [N]ot requiring slavish adherence to the specific wording of the\n        statute is not the same as relieving the court of the duty to make\n        the required “findings.” R.C. 2929.14(C)(4) requires the court to\n        make specific “findings.” In the past, we have found those\n        findings can be implicit in context when the court’s statements\n        during sentencing are intended to encompass the relevant\n        provisions of the sentencing statutes. But in doing so, we have\n        arguably frustrated the purposes underlying the requirement\n        for findings as a predicate for ordering consecutive sentences.\n\n(Internal citation omitted). Venes, at ¶ 14.10\n\n        {¶157} In this case, we are mindful of the fact that it seems obvious that\n\nthere are multiple courses of conduct and multiple victims. Nevertheless, in State\n\nv. Farnsworth, supra, the 7th District Court of Appeals held that where the trial\n\ncourt made only two of the three required findings, reversal was warranted for\n\n\n10\n  We distinguished Venes in State v. Upkins, 3d Dist. Shelby No. 17-13-02, 2013-Ohio-3986. In Upkins,\nthe trial court did make all the required findings.\n\n\n                                               -65-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\nresentencing. See also State v. Brooks, 9th Dist. Summit Nos. 26437, 26352,\n\n2013-Ohio-2169, ¶ 13 (“[T]his court concludes that [R.C. 2929.14(C)’s] findings\n\nmust be made at the sentencing hearing on the record. * * * Ideally, those\n\nfindings would also then be memorialized in the sentencing entry.”). In this case,\n\nthe findings did not fully comply with R.C. 2929.14(C) in either instance.\n\n       {¶158} Accordingly, we have no choice but to find that the trial court failed\n\nto make adequate findings to support the imposition of consecutive sentences.\n\nTherefore, Stober’s eighth assignment of error is sustained.\n\n                             Ninth Assignment of Error\n\n       {¶159} In Stober’s ninth assignment of error, he argues that Stober was\n\ndenied due process and a fair trial due to errors committed by the trial court, the\n\nprosecutor, and Stober’s trial counsel.      Specifically, Stober contends that the\n\ncumulative errors throughout the trial denied Stober his right to a fair trial.\n\n       {¶160} Having sustained no errors regarding Stober’s trial, we cannot find\n\nthat there are any errors that collectively have a “cumulative” effect to such an\n\nextent that Stober was deprived of a fair trial. Nevertheless, to the extent that any\n\nerrors existed, when taken in context of the entire trial, they are not sufficient to\n\nsupport reversal. Accordingly, Stober’s ninth assignment of error is overruled.\n\n       {¶161} For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Putnam County\n\nCommon Pleas Court is affirmed in part, and reversed in part and remanded to the\n\n                                         -66-\n\fCase No. 12-13-09\n\n\n\ntrial court for resentencing to consider whether consecutive sentences are\n\nappropriate under R.C. 2929.14(C)(4) and, if so, to enter the proper findings on the\n\nrecord.\n\n                                                       Judgment Affirmed in Part,\n                                                            Reversed in Part and\n                                                                Cause Remanded\n\nWILLAMOWSKI, P.J. and PRESTON, J., concur.\n\n/jlr\n\n\n\n\n                                       -67-\n\f</pre>",
