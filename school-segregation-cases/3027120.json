OPINION\n\n\n      Appeal from the United States District Court\n                for the District of Idaho\n    B. Lynn Winmill, Chief District Judge, Presiding\n\n           Argued and Submitted En Banc\n     September 9, 2015—San Francisco, California\n\n                   Filed January 11, 2016\n\n   Before: Sidney R. Thomas, Chief Judge and Stephen\nReinhardt, Alex Kozinski, M. Margaret McKeown, Marsha\n  S. Berzon, Richard R. Clifton, Jay S. Bybee, Sandra S.\n Ikuta, N. Randy Smith, Jacqueline H. Nguyen and Paul J.\n                 Watford, Circuit Judges.\n\n                   Opinion by Judge Ikuta;\n                   Dissent by Judge Bybee\n\f2                  UNITED STATES V. SWISHER\n\n                           SUMMARY*\n\n\n                          Criminal Law\n\n    Reversing the denial of a motion under 28 U.S.C. § 2255,\nthe en banc court held that the reasoning in United States v.\nAlvarez, 132 S. Ct. 2537 (2012), invalidating on First\nAmendment grounds a statute prohibiting lying about being\nawarded military medals, also applied to 18 U.S.C. § 704(a)\n(2002 ed.), a provision of the Stolen Valor Act that previously\ncriminalized the unauthorized wearing of such medals.\n\n    The en banc court held that the defendant’s challenge to\nhis conviction under § 704(a) was not barred by Teague v.\nLane, 489 U.S. 288 (1989), because Alvarez was a decision\nholding that a substantive federal statute did not reach certain\nconduct, and thus could be applied retroactively. In addition,\nthe government waived a procedural default defense based on\nthe defendant’s failure to raise his constitutional claim at trial\nor on direct appeal.\n\n    The en banc court held that § 704(a) regulated speech\nbecause wearing a medal conveys a message. The court held\nthat § 704(a) was a content-based restriction of false symbolic\nspeech because its purpose was to stop a particular message:\nthe misappropriation or distortion of the message of valor\nconveyed by a medal. Accordingly, the tests applicable to\ncontent-neutral regulations did not apply.\n\n\n\n\n  *\n    This summary constitutes no part of the opinion of the court. It has\nbeen prepared by court staff for the convenience of the reader.\n\f                UNITED STATES V. SWISHER                     3\n\n    Considering the intermediate-scrutiny standard set forth\nin Justice Breyer’s concurring opinion in Alvarez, the en banc\ncourt interpreted § 704(a) as proscribing unauthorized\npersons from wearing military medals for the purpose of\nfalsely communicating that they have been awarded such\nmedals. The court held that this narrowing interpretation\ndiminished the extent to which § 704(a) endangered First\nAmendment values, but the statute lacked limiting features\nsuch as a requirement of proof of specific harm to identifiable\nvictims. Accordingly, under Justice Breyer’s test, § 704(a)\ncreated a significant risk of First Amendment harm. The en\nbanc court concluded that the government had a compelling\ninterest in enacting § 704(a), but there were other, less\nrestrictive ways of achieving those objectives.\n\n   The en banc court concluded that § 704(a) failed Justice\nBreyer’s intermediate scrutiny test, and therefore also failed\nunder the Alvarez plurality’s exacting scrutiny test.\n\n    The en banc court overruled United States v. Perelman,\n695 F.3d 866 (9th Cir. 2012), to the extent inconsistent with\nthis opinion.\n\n    Dissenting, Judge Bybee, joined by Judges N.R. Smith\nand Watford, wrote that the defendant’s conduct was not a\nform of speech entitled to the same protection as the speech\nin Alvarez, and that he would uphold the constitutionality of\n§ 704(a) under Justice Breyer’s intermediate-scrutiny\nanalysis.\n\f4                      UNITED STATES V. SWISHER\n\n                                 COUNSEL\n\nJoseph Theodore Horras, Boise, Idaho, for Defendant-\nAppellant.\n\nJohn M. Pellettieri (argued), Attorney, Appellate Section;\nLeslie R. Caldwell, Assistant Attorney General; Sung-Hee\nSuh, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, United States\nDepartment of Justice, Washington, D.C., for Plaintiff-\nAppellee.\n\n\n                                  OPINION\n\nIKUTA, Circuit Judge:\n\n    This appeal requires us to determine whether the\nreasoning in United States v. Alvarez, 132 S. Ct. 2537 (2012),\nwhich invalidated a statute prohibiting lying about being\nawarded military medals, see 18 U.S.C. § 704(b) (2011 ed.),1\nalso applies to a statute criminalizing the unauthorized\n\n\n\n\n    1\n        The then-applicable provision read:\n\n             Whoever falsely represents himself or herself, verbally\n             or in writing, to have been awarded any decoration or\n             medal authorized by Congress for the Armed Forces of\n             the United States . . . shall be fined under this title,\n             imprisoned not more than six months, or both.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 704(b) (2011 ed.).\n\f                      UNITED STATES V. SWISHER                           5\n\nwearing of such medals, see 18 U.S.C. § 704(a) (2006 ed.).2\nWe hold that it does, and therefore reverse the district court.3\n\n\n\n\n 2\n      The provision read in full:\n\n           Whoever knowingly wears, purchases, attempts to\n           purchase, solicits for purchase, mails, ships, imports,\n           exports, produces blank certificates of receipt for,\n           manufactures, sells, attempts to sell, advertises for sale,\n           trades, barters, or exchanges for anything of value any\n           decoration or medal authorized by Congress for the\n           armed forces of the United States, or any of the service\n           medals or badges awarded to the members of such\n           forces, or the ribbon, button, or rosette of any such\n           badge, decoration or medal, or any colorable imitation\n           thereof, except when authorized under regulations made\n           pursuant to law, shall be fined under this title or\n           imprisoned not more than six months, or both.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 704(a) (2002 ed.).\n\n     Before we agreed to rehear this case en banc, § 704(a) was amended\nto remove the word “wears” from the list of prohibited actions with\nrespect to decorations and medals authorized by Congress. See 18 U.S.C.\n§ 704(a) (2013 ed.). That is, § 704(a) no longer prohibits the conduct for\nwhich Swisher was convicted. Because Swisher was convicted under the\nprior version of the statute, however, the case is not moot. See Carafas v.\nLaVallee, 391 U.S. 234, 239 (1968) (holding that a challenge to a criminal\nconviction is not moot when the defendant continues to face adverse\nconsequences from the conviction).\n  3\n    Swisher’s other claims were previously addressed in an unpublished\nmemorandum disposition. United States v. Swisher, 585 F. App’x 605\n(9th Cir. 2014). We agree with the three-judge panel’s reasons for\nrejecting Swisher’s other arguments, and we adopt them as our own.\n\f6               UNITED STATES V. SWISHER\n\n                              I\n\n    Defendant Elven Joe Swisher enlisted in the United States\nMarine Corps on August 4, 1954, a little over a year after the\nKorean War ended. In August 1957, he was honorably\ndischarged from the Marine Corps into the reserves. Upon\ndischarge, Swisher was given a DD-214 discharge document,\na typewritten form that provided his name, education, type of\ndischarge, last duty assignment, last date of service, and\nsimilar information regarding his military service. The form\nrequired a listing of Swisher’s “decorations, medals, badges,\ncommendations, citations and campaign ribbons awarded or\nauthorized.” In the authenticated copy of Swisher’s original\nDD-214, the term “N/A” (not applicable) is written in the\nfield.\n\n    In 2001, more than forty years after his discharge,\nSwisher filed a claim for service-related Post-Traumatic\nStress Disorder (PTSD). In his application, Swisher claimed\nhe suffered from PTSD as a result of his participation in a\nsecret combat mission in North Korea in August or\nSeptember 1955. Along with his application, Swisher\nprovided a self-published narrative that described the North\nKorea operation. According to the narrative, Swisher was\nwounded in battle, and subsequently presented with a Purple\nHeart by an unnamed captain who visited him in the hospital.\nThe same captain told him he was “entitled to and should\nwear the National Defense Medal, Korean War Service\nMedal and the Korean War U.N. Service Medal and\nRibbons.” Swisher claims he also received a Silver Star and\na Navy Commendation Medal and Ribbon with a Bronze\n“V.”\n\f                   UNITED STATES V. SWISHER                           7\n\n   After reviewing Swisher’s application for PTSD benefits\nand the accompanying narrative, the VA denied the claim\nbecause Swisher failed to provide corroborating evidence\nbeyond his own statement that his PTSD was service\nconnected.\n\n    Swisher appealed the denial and submitted a photocopy\nof a second DD-214, which included the typewritten\ncomment that “[t]his document replaces the previously issued\ntransfer document” and “[c]hanges and additions have been\nverified by Command.” The new form stated that Swisher\nhad received the Silver Star, Navy and Marine Corps Medal\nwith Gold Star, Purple Heart, and Navy and Marine Corps\nCommendation Medal with Bronze “V.” Based on this\ninformation, the VA reversed its previous decision in July\n2004, ruled that Swisher’s PTSD was a compensable\ndisability, and granted Swisher a total of $2,366 a month in\nbenefits.4\n\n    About a year later, the VA received information from the\nmilitary personnel division that the replacement DD-214 was\nfraudulent. In July 2006, after further investigation\nconfirmed that the DD-214 was forged, the VA reversed its\ndetermination that the PTSD was service connected and\nrequired Swisher to pay back the PTSD benefits that he had\nreceived.\n\n\n\n  4\n     Swisher’s claim that he was awarded a Purple Heart became a key\nissue in a criminal trial involving defendant David Hinkson, who was on\ntrial for solicitation of murder. See United States v. Hinkson, 585 F.3d\n1247, 1254–57 (9th Cir. 2009) (en banc). The parties agreed that any\nevidence related to the Hinkson trial would be excluded from Swisher’s\ntrial.\n\f8                 UNITED STATES V. SWISHER\n\n    In July 2007, a grand jury indicted Swisher for four\nviolations of federal law: (1) wearing unauthorized military\nmedals in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 704(a); (2) making false\nstatements to the VA regarding his military service,\ndisabilities, and honors, in an effort to obtain benefits in\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001(a)(2); (3) forging or altering his\ncertificate of discharge, also in an effort to obtain benefits, in\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001(a)(3); and (4) theft of\ngovernment funds, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 641.\n\n    During the one-week trial, Lieutenant Colonel Elaine\nHensen, the assistant head for the Military Awards Branch at\nHeadquarters Marine Corps, discussed her review of the\nMarine Corps files and her determination that the files\ncontained no record of Swisher receiving or being awarded\nthe Purple Heart or any other medal or award. The\ngovernment also introduced Exhibit 67, a photograph\nshowing Swisher and another man in Marine Corps League\nuniforms.5 In the photograph, Swisher is wearing several\nmilitary medals and awards, and shaking hands with a person\nin civilian garb. The parties stipulated that the photograph\nwas authentic. Lt. Col. Henson testified that the photograph\nshowed Swisher wearing the Silver Star, Navy and Marine\nCorps Ribbon, Purple Heart, Navy and Marine Corps\nCommendation Medal with a Bronze “V,” and UMC\nExpeditionary Medal. She reiterated that there was nothing\n“in the United States Marine Corps’ files . . . to substantiate\nMr. Swisher’s entitlement to wear any of those awards.” In\naddition, Jeffrey Shattuck, the head of the Records\nCorrespondence Section for the Personnel Management\n\n\n    5\n    The Marine Corps League is a Congressionally chartered veterans\norganization that has its own Marine-related uniforms. See 36 U.S.C.\n§§ 140101–04.\n\f                UNITED STATES V. SWISHER                    9\n\nSupport Branch of the Marine Corps, outlined in detail the\nnumerous indicia of fraud on Swisher’s replacement DD-214\nthat Swisher had used to verify his awards.\n\n    At the conclusion of the trial, the jury found Swisher\nguilty on all counts. The court imposed a below-guidelines\nsentence of 12 months and one day, with a three-year term of\nsupervised release. We affirmed Swisher’s conviction and\nsentence on appeal. United States v. Swisher, 360 F. App’x\n784 (9th Cir. 2009).\n\n    Swisher subsequently challenged his conviction through\na motion under 18 U.S.C. § 2255 and claimed that his\nconviction for wearing the medals violated the First\nAmendment under the reasoning of the Ninth Circuit’s\nintervening decision in United States v. Alvarez, 617 F.3d\n1198 (9th Cir. 2010). The district court denied the motion and\nan appeal followed. See United States v. Swisher, 790 F.\nSupp. 2d 1215, 1245–46 (D. Idaho 2011); United States v.\nSwisher, 771 F.3d 514 (9th Cir. 2014).\n\n    While Swisher’s appeal was pending, the Supreme Court\naffirmed our decision in Alvarez, and held that § 704(b)\nunconstitutionally infringes upon speech protected by the\nFirst Amendment. See United States v. Alvarez, 132 S. Ct.\n2537 (2012). Nevertheless, we subsequently distinguished\nAlvarez, and held that § 704(a) survived First Amendment\nscrutiny. United States v. Perelman, 695 F.3d 866, 871–72\n(9th Cir. 2012) (as amended). Bound by Perelman, a three-\njudge panel rejected Swisher’s constitutional challenge to\n§ 704(a). Swisher, 771 F.3d at 524. In his petition for\nrehearing, Swisher argued that § 704(a) was unconstitutional\nunder the reasoning set forth in Alvarez and asked us to\n\f10              UNITED STATES V. SWISHER\n\noverrule our contrary decision in Perelman. We took the case\nen banc to reconsider this issue.\n\n                              II\n\n    We review de novo a district court’s denial of relief to a\nfederal prisoner under 28 U.S.C. § 2255. United States v.\nAguirre-Ganceda, 592 F.3d 1043, 1045 (9th Cir. 2010).\nSection 2255 is a substitute for habeas corpus relief for\nfederal prisoners, see Davis v. United States, 417 U.S. 333,\n343 (1974), and allows a petitioner to file a motion to\n“vacate, set aside or correct” the petitioner’s conviction or\nsentence “upon the ground that the sentence was imposed in\nviolation of the Constitution or laws of the United States, or\nthat the court was without jurisdiction to impose such\nsentence, or that the sentence was in excess of the maximum\nauthorized by law, or is otherwise subject to collateral\nattack,” 28 U.S.C. § 2255(a).\n\n    In evaluating a § 2255 motion, we are not constrained by\n28 U.S.C. § 2254(d), which precludes federal courts from\ngranting habeas relief to a state prisoner with regard to any\nclaim adjudicated on the merits unless the adjudication\n“resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an\nunreasonable application of, clearly established” Supreme\nCourt precedent, or “resulted in a decision that was based on\nan unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the\nevidence presented in the State court proceeding.” Section\n2255 does not have a similar restriction on review of claims\nby federal prisoners.\n\n   Although Swisher’s challenge to his conviction is based\non a Supreme Court decision decided after his conviction\nbecame final, we are not barred from considering his claim.\n\f                UNITED STATES V. SWISHER                   11\n\nTeague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288 (1989), generally precludes the\napplication of “new constitutional rules of criminal\nprocedure” to cases that “have become final before the new\nrules are announced.” Bousley v. United States, 523 U.S.\n614, 619–20 (1998) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nWhile Teague is applicable in the § 2255 context, see United\nStates v. Sanchez-Cervantes, 282 F.3d 664, 667–68 (9th Cir.\n2002), Teague does not bar the retroactive application of\ndecisions holding “that a substantive federal criminal statute\ndoes not reach certain conduct,” Bousley, 523 U.S. at 620.\nAlvarez is a substantive decision of that sort.\n\n    Nor does Swisher’s failure to raise his constitutional\nclaim at trial or on direct appeal prevent us from reviewing\nhis claim. Although federal prisoners are generally barred\nfrom raising claims on collateral review that they could have\nraised on direct appeal, see Bousley, 523 U.S. at 621, the\ngovernment can waive a procedural default defense by failing\nto raise it, see United States v. Barron, 172 F.3d 1153,\n1156–57 (9th Cir. 1999) (en banc). Here, the government\nfailed to raise the procedural default on appeal and does not\ndispute that it is waived.\n\n                             III\n\n    To address Swisher’s arguments, we begin with a review\nof the reasoning in Alvarez and our subsequent interpretation\nof Alvarez in Perelman.\n\n                              A\n\n   Alvarez considered the appeal of a defendant who was\nconvicted under § 704(b) for introducing himself at a public\nmeeting with a series of lies, including the false statement\n\f12               UNITED STATES V. SWISHER\n\nthat “[b]ack in 1987, I was awarded the Congressional Medal\nof Honor.” 132 S. Ct. at 2542 (Kennedy, J., plurality\nopinion). The defendant challenged his conviction on the\nground that § 704(b) was invalid under the First Amendment.\nId. He won on appeal, and the government petitioned for\ncertiorari. Id.\n\n    Because § 704(b) criminalized specific statements based\non their falsity, the government did not dispute that the statute\nimposed a content-based restriction on speech. Rather, the\ngovernment argued that false statements had “no First\nAmendment value in themselves,” id. at 2543, and so were\nprotected “only to the extent needed to avoid chilling fully\nprotected speech,” id. The Supreme Court rejected the\ngovernment’s argument, and agreed that § 704(b) violated the\nFirst Amendment. Id. The Court could not, however, agree\non the appropriate level of scrutiny for the sort of lies targeted\nby § 704(b). Id. at 2548 (Kennedy, J., plurality opinion),\n2552 (Breyer, J., concurring).\n\n    Justice Kennedy, writing for four Justices, held that\n§ 704(b) was subject to the “most exacting scrutiny.” Id. at\n2548 (Kennedy, J., plurality opinion) (quoting Turner Broad.\nSys., Inc. v. FCC, 512 U.S. 622, 642 (1994)). In reaching this\nconclusion, the plurality rejected the government’s argument\nthat false statements had “no First Amendment value” and\nmerited protection “only to the extent needed to avoid\nchilling fully protected speech.” Id. at 2543. While\nconceding that “content-based restrictions on speech have\nbeen permitted” for certain historical categories of speech, id.\nat 2544, the plurality concluded that the “Government has not\ndemonstrated that false statements generally should constitute\na new category of unprotected speech.” Id. at 2547. Nor did\nthe plurality agree with the government’s argument that\n\f                UNITED STATES V. SWISHER                    13\n\n§ 704(b) was analogous to regulations on false speech “that\ncourts generally have found permissible,” such as laws\nprohibiting a false statement made to a Government official,\nlaws punishing perjury, and prohibitions on falsely claiming\nto speak on behalf of the government. Id. at 2545–46. These\nexamples, the plurality determined, were confined to\ncircumscribed contexts. Id. at 2546. Certain statutes\nprohibiting impersonation of a government official, for\ninstance, “protect the integrity of Government processes,\nquite apart from merely restricting false speech,” and may be\nlimited to “maintain[ing] the general good repute and dignity\nof . . . government . . . service itself.” Id. at 2546 (quoting\nUnited States v. Lepowitch, 318 U.S. 702, 704 (1943)\n(alterations in original)). The plurality concluded that these\ntypes of permissible speech regulations did not encompass the\n“sweeping, quite unprecedented reach” of § 704(b). Id. at\n2547.\n\n    Having concluded that false statements of the sort\nproscribed in § 704(b) constituted protected speech, the\nplurality subjected the statute to “exacting scrutiny,” which\nrequired that (1) the government have a compelling interest;\n(2) “the Government’s chosen restriction on the speech at\nissue be actually necessary to achieve its interest,” and\n(3) “[t]here must be a direct causal link between the\nrestriction imposed and the injury to be prevented.” Id. at\n2549 (internal quotation marks omitted). Applying this test\nto § 704(b), the plurality held that the statute served a\ncompelling government interest in protecting “the integrity of\nthe military honors system,” id. at 2548, but the statute’s\nrestriction was not “actually necessary” because the\ngovernment’s interest could be satisfied by counterspeech,\nincluding a “Government-created database [that] could list\nCongressional Medal of Honor winners.” Id. at 2549–51.\n\f14               UNITED STATES V. SWISHER\n\nFurther, the government had not shown “[t]he link between\nthe Government’s interest in protecting the integrity of the\nmilitary honors system and the Act’s restriction on the false\nclaims of liars,” because it failed to support “its claim that the\npublic’s general perception of military awards is diluted by\nfalse claims.” Id. at 2549. Accordingly, the plurality\nconcluded that § 704(b) violated the First Amendment. Id. at\n2551.\n\n    Justice Breyer concurred in the judgment on the ground\nthat § 704(b) “works disproportionate constitutional harm”\nunder his formulation of intermediate scrutiny. Id. at 2556\n(Breyer, J., concurring). In his concurrence, Justice Breyer\nstated that to determine whether a statute violates the First\nAmendment, the Court generally examines “the fit between\nstatutory ends and means.” Id. at 2551. In conducting a\nreview of a governmental enactment under this standard, a\ncourt must (1) take “account of the seriousness of the\nspeech-related harm the provision will likely cause”;\n(2) consider “the nature and importance of the provision’s\ncountervailing objectives,” and (3) weigh “the extent to\nwhich the provision will tend to achieve those objectives, and\nwhether there are other, less restrictive ways of doing so.” Id.\n\n    In applying this test to § 704(b), Justice Breyer first\nconsidered the “speech-related harm” caused by this\nenactment. Id. at 2551–52. Justice Breyer interpreted\n§ 704(b) as “criminalizing only false factual statements made\nwith knowledge of their falsity and with the intent that they\nbe taken as true.” Id. at 2552–53. He acknowledged that\nregulation of false statements “endangers First Amendment\nvalues” less than other restrictions, id. at 2553, and noted that\n“many statutes and common-law doctrines make the utterance\nof certain kinds of false statements unlawful,” id. at 2253–54.\n\f                UNITED STATES V. SWISHER                    15\n\nBut in Justice Breyer’s view, such statutes and doctrines work\nless speech-related harm because they typically “narrow the\nstatute to a subset of lies where specific harm is more likely\nto occur.” Id. at 2555. For instance, laws punishing fraud,\ndefamation, or intentional infliction of emotional distress\ngenerally “requir[e] proof of specific harm to identifiable\nvictims,” and statutes prohibiting the impersonation of a\npublic official “may require a showing that, for example,\nsomeone was deceived into following a ‘course [of action] he\nwould not have pursued but for the deceitful conduct.’” Id.\nat 2554 (alteration in original) (quoting Lepowitch, 318 U.S.\nat 704). Other similar laws specify “that the lies be made in\ncontexts in which a tangible harm to others is especially\nlikely to occur,” such as laws punishing perjury or lying to a\ngovernment official, or trademark statutes which are “focused\nupon commercial and promotional activities that are likely to\ndilute the value of a mark.” Id. Finally, statutes prohibiting\nfalse claims of terrorist attacks or other lies about crimes or\ncatastrophes, are limited to false statements that “are\nparticularly likely to produce harm,” and generally require\nproof of foreseeability of substantial public harm. Id.\n\n    According to Justice Breyer, § 704(b) lacked these\nnarrowing features because it was not limited to a subset of\nlies causing specific harm to identifiable victims, or to a\nspecific context where foreseeable harm to others is likely to\noccur. Id. at 2555–56. Because “[f]alse factual statements\ncan serve useful human objectives” in a variety of contexts\nand “the threat of criminal prosecution” could have a chilling\neffect and could encourage or permit selective prosecution for\npolitical ends, id. at 2553, Justice Breyer concluded that\n§ 704(b) “risks significant First Amendment harm,” id. at\n2555.\n\f16               UNITED STATES V. SWISHER\n\n    Having reached this conclusion, Justice Breyer then\nturned to consider “the nature and importance of the\nprovision’s countervailing objectives,” id. at 2551, and\nconcluded that § 704(b) has a “substantial countervailing\nobjective” because “[i]t seeks to protect the interests of those\nwho have sacrificed their health and life for their country,”\nand is aimed at avoiding dilution of “the country’s\nrecognition of that sacrifice in the form of military honors,”\nid. at 2555.\n\n    Finally, Justice Breyer turned to his third prong,\nconsideration of “the extent to which the provision will tend\nto achieve those objectives, and whether there are other, less\nrestrictive ways of doing so.” Id. at 2551. Here, Justice\nBreyer concluded that it was “possible substantially to\nachieve the Government’s objective in less burdensome\nways.” Id. at 2555. According to Justice Breyer, Congress\ncould enact a more limited statute that adopted some of the\nnarrowing strategies used in other statutes and common law\ndoctrines punishing false speech, such as (1) requiring a\nshowing that the false statements caused a specific harm,\n(2) requiring that the lies be made in a context “where such\nlies are most likely to cause harm,” or (3) focusing on the\nmore important military awards that Congress most values.\nId. at 2555–56. Such a more narrowly tailored statute could\nbe combined with “information-disseminating devices,” such\nas “an accurate, publicly available register of military awards,\neasily obtainable by political opponents.” Id. at 2556.\nBecause the government failed to explain why a more limited\nstatute along with a method for providing more accurate\ninformation would not “significantly reduce the threat of First\nAmendment harm while permitting the statute to achieve its\nimportant protective objective,” Justice Breyer concluded that\n“the statute as presently drafted works disproportionate\n\f                UNITED STATES V. SWISHER                    17\n\nconstitutional harm” and “so violates the First Amendment.”\nId.\n\n                              B\n\n    In analyzing the constitutionality of § 704(b), Alvarez did\nnot directly address the closely related section of the Stolen\nValor Act, § 704(a), which is before us here. We first had\noccasion to consider a constitutional challenge to that section\nin United States v. Perelman, decided two months after the\nSupreme Court issued its opinion in Alvarez. 695 F.3d 866.\n\n    Before considering the applicability of Alvarez, Perelman\nconsidered the defendant’s overbreadth challenge to § 704(a).\nPerelman rejected this argument by construing the statute\nnarrowly as criminalizing only the unauthorized wearing of\nmedals “when the wearer intends to deceive.” Id. at 870\n(emphasis omitted).\n\n    Perelman then considered whether § 704(a), as construed,\nwould survive First Amendment scrutiny. Although the\nAlvarez plurality had applied “exacting scrutiny” to § 704(b),\nPerelman did not use this analytic framework because\n§ 704(a) did not criminalize speech, but rather criminalized\n“the harmful conduct of wearing a medal without\nauthorization and with intent to deceive.” Id. at 871.\nPerelman reasoned that “[e]ven if we assume that the\nintentionally deceptive wearing of a medal contains an\nexpressive element—the false statement that ‘I received a\nmedal’—the distinction between pure speech and conduct\nthat has an expressive element separates this case from\nAlvarez.” Id. Because, in Perelman’s view, § 704(a)\ncriminalized conduct, it was more akin to the impersonation\nstatutes discussed in Alvarez, or statutes prohibiting “the\n\f18               UNITED STATES V. SWISHER\n\nunauthorized wearing of military uniforms.” Id. at 872\n(citing Schacht v. United States, 398 U.S. 58 (1970)).\n\n    Presumably because of its determination that § 704(a)\nprimarily criminalized conduct, but without further analysis,\nPerelman applied the test set forth in United States v.\nO’Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 377 (1968) (upholding the conviction\nof a draft protester under a content-neutral law prohibiting\nknowing destruction of draft cards). 695 F.3d at 872.\nApplying O’Brien’s three-part test, Perelman first held that\nthe government had “a compelling interest in ‘preserving the\nintegrity of its system of honoring our military men and\nwomen for their service and, at times, their sacrifice.’” Id.\n(quoting Alvarez, 617 F.3d at 1216).               Second, the\ngovernment’s interests were “unrelated to the suppression of\nfree expression” because the statute “does not prevent the\nexpression of any particular message or viewpoint.” Id. And\nthird, “the incidental restriction on alleged First Amendment\nfreedoms” was “no greater than is essential to the furtherance\nof that interest,” because, “even if § 704(a) is not the most\neffective mechanism, in at least some measure it promotes the\ngoals of maintaining the integrity of the military’s medals and\npreventing the fraudulent wearing of military medals.” Id. at\n872–73. Accordingly, Perelman rejected the defendant’s\nfacial First Amendment challenge to § 704(a). Id. at 873.\n\n                               IV\n\n    Perelman based its conclusion that § 704(a) did not\nviolate the First Amendment on two grounds. First,\nPerelman distinguished between written or spoken speech on\nthe one hand and expressive conduct on the other. Id. at 871.\nSecond, Perelman implicitly determined that expressive\nconduct is per se subject to scrutiny under the test set forth in\n\f                 UNITED STATES V. SWISHER                    19\n\nO’Brien. Id. at 872. Our reconsideration of Perelman\nrequires us to review both these issues regarding the First\nAmendment framework for analyzing communicative\nconduct.\n\n                               A\n\n     The First Amendment provides that “Congress shall make\nno law . . . abridging the freedom of speech.” U.S. Const.\namend. I. While “[t]he First Amendment literally forbids the\nabridgment only of ‘speech,’” the Supreme Court has “long\nrecognized that its protection does not end at the spoken or\nwritten word.” Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 404 (1989).\nA message “delivered by conduct that is intended to be\ncommunicative and that, in context, would reasonably be\nunderstood by the viewer to be communicative,” Clark v.\nCmty. for Creative Non-Violence, 468 U.S. 288, 294 (1984),\nis symbolic speech that falls “within the scope of the First and\nFourteenth Amendments.” Johnson, 491 U.S. at 404; see\nalso Nunez v. Davis, 169 F.3d 1222, 1226 (9th Cir. 1999)\n(“Non-verbal conduct implicates the First Amendment when\nit is intended to convey a ‘particularized message’ and the\nlikelihood is great that the message would be so understood.”\n(quoting Johnson, 491 U.S. at 404)). For instance, “the\nwearing of an armband for the purpose of expressing certain\nviews is the type of symbolic act that is within the Free\nSpeech Clause of the First Amendment” and is “closely akin\nto ‘pure speech.’” Tinker v. Des Moines Indep. Cmty. Sch.\nDist., 393 U.S. 503, 505 (1969). Similarly, the Court has\n“recognized the expressive nature of . . . a sit-in by blacks in\na ‘whites only’ area to protest segregation,” Johnson,\n491 U.S. at 404 (citing Brown v. Louisiana, 383 U.S. 131,\n141–42 (1966)), and “of the wearing of American military\n\f20                 UNITED STATES V. SWISHER\n\nuniforms in a dramatic presentation criticizing American\ninvolvement in Vietnam,” id. (citing Schacht, 398 U.S. 58).\n\n    While the Court has rejected the notion that “an\napparently limitless variety of conduct can be labeled\n‘speech’ whenever the person engaging in the conduct intends\nthereby to express an idea,” O’Brien, 391 U.S. at 376, there\nis no doubt that the use of recognized symbols, such as\nemblems or flags, constitutes symbolic speech, Johnson,\n491 U.S. at 404. “The use of an emblem or flag to symbolize\nsome system, idea, institution, or personality, is a short cut\nfrom mind to mind,” and “a primitive but effective way of\ncommunicating ideas.” W. Va. State Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette,\n319 U.S. 624, 632 (1943); see also Anderson v. City of\nHermosa Beach, 621 F.3d 1051, 1061 (9th Cir. 2010)\n(“Tattoos are generally composed of words, realistic or\nabstract images, symbols, or a combination of these, all of\nwhich are forms of pure expression that are entitled to full\nFirst Amendment protection.”). In this context, the Court has\nfrequently recognized “the communicative nature of conduct”\nrelating to the American flag, which “as readily signifies this\nNation as does the combination of letters found in\n‘America.’” Johnson, 491 U.S. at 405–06. Because “[t]he\nvery purpose of a national flag is to serve as a symbol of our\ncountry,” id. at 405, such acts as attaching a peace sign to the\nAmerican flag, Spence v. Washington, 418 U.S. 405, 409–11\n(1974), refusing to salute the flag, Barnette, 319 U.S. at\n632–33, or burning the flag, Johnson, 491 U.S. at 405–06,\nconstitute symbolic speech that “may find shelter under the\nFirst Amendment.” Id. at 405.6\n\n\n  6\n   The dissent’s contention that courts should analyze laws burdening\nsymbolic speech conveyed by a “physical emblem,” such as a flag or a\nmedal, differently than they analyze laws burdening oral or written speech,\n\f                  UNITED STATES V. SWISHER                        21\n\n     In adjudicating a First Amendment challenge to a\ngovernment enactment that regulates speech, the Supreme\nCourt considers whether the enactment is content-based or\ncontent-neutral. See Reed v. Town of Gilbert, 135 S. Ct.\n2218, 2226–27 (2015). This threshold inquiry is the same for\nsymbolic speech as it is for enactments that regulate spoken\nor written words. See Johnson, 491 U.S. at 403 (holding that\nif the conduct at issue is communicative in nature, the Court\nmust first determine “whether the State’s regulation is related\nto the suppression of free expression”). Even where an\nenactment “contains no explicit content-based limitation on\nthe scope of prohibited conduct,” United States v. Eichman,\n496 U.S. 310, 315 (1990), a court must consider whether the\nlaw “suppresses expression out of concern for its likely\ncommunicative impact,” id. at 317. See also Nordyke v.\nKing, 319 F.3d 1185, 1189–90 (9th Cir. 2003) (rejecting a\nFirst Amendment challenge to an ordinance barring the\npossession of firearms on County-owned property because it\nwas not aimed at the communicative impact of firearm\npossession).\n\n    If the purpose of a law regulating conduct is aimed at the\nconduct itself, rather than at the message conveyed by that\nconduct, the regulation is subject to the lesser scrutiny given\nto content-neutral restrictions. Put differently, lesser scrutiny\napplies if the government’s interest in such a regulation “is\nunrelated to the suppression of free speech.” Clark, 468 U.S.\nat 294.      In such circumstances, and only in such\ncircumstances, the O’Brien test is applicable. See Doe v.\nReed, 586 F.3d 671, 678 (9th Cir. 2009) (assuming that\nsigning a referendum petition is expressive conduct subject to\n\n\nDis. op. at 39–40, is inconsistent with these precedents. Indeed, the\ndissent cites no case supporting its views.\n\f22                 UNITED STATES V. SWISHER\n\nthe O’Brien test); Corales v. Bennet, 567 F.3d 554, 567 (9th\nCir. 2009) (analyzing “the school’s policy of disciplining\ntruancies and leaving campus without permission” under\nO’Brien’s “intermediate scrutiny applied to content-neutral\nrules of conduct.”). To pass the O’Brien test, however, the\nregulation must be “narrowly drawn to further a substantial\ngovernmental interest.” Clark, 468 U.S. at 294.7\n\n     On the other hand, where the government’s aim is to\nregulate the message conveyed by expressive conduct, the\ncontent-neutral O’Brien test is not applicable. Nor may it be\napplied unless “the conduct itself may constitutionally be\nregulated.” Id. As explained in Johnson, “[i]f the State’s\nregulation is not related to expression, then the less stringent\nstandard we announced in United States v. O’Brien for\nregulations of noncommunicative conduct controls,” but “[i]f\nit is, then we are outside of O’Brien’s test” and the regulation\nmust survive “under a more demanding standard.” 491 U.S.\nat 403; see also Spence, 418 U.S. at 412, 414 n.8 (concluding\nthat the state’s interest in “preserving the national flag as an\nunalloyed symbol of our country” was directly related to\nexpression, and accordingly “the four-step analysis of United\nStates v. O’Brien is inapplicable”); Nordyke, 319 F.3d at 1189\n(stating that if an ordinance barring the possession of firearms\non County property is “related to the suppression of free\nexpression” then a First Amendment challenge to the\nordinance must be analyzed under Johnson; if not, the\n\n     7\n      The test for “time, place, or manner restrictions” may also be\napplicable to a content-neutral regulation of symbolic conduct. Clark,\n468 U.S. at 293. There is, however, “little, if any, differen[ce]” between\nthe two tests. See Clark, 468 U.S. at 298; see also Vlasak v. Super. Ct. of\nCal., 329 F.3d 683, 691 (9th Cir. 2003) (noting that O’Brien is “nearly\nidentical to the time, place and manner test”). Because Perleman applied\nO’Brien, we focus on the O’Brien standard.\n\f                 UNITED STATES V. SWISHER                    23\n\nO’Brien test applies.). Accordingly, if a government\nenactment is “directed at the communicative nature of\nconduct” then it is content-based, and “must, like a law\ndirected at speech itself, be justified by the substantial\nshowing of need that the First Amendment requires.”\nJohnson, 491 U.S. at 406 (emphasis omitted) (quoting Cmty.\nfor Creative Non-Violence v. Watt, 703 F.2d 586, 622–623\n(D.C. Cir. 1983) (Scalia, J., dissenting), rev’d sub nom. Clark,\n468 U.S. 288).\n\n    The Supreme Court has recently provided authoritative\ndirection for differentiating between content-neutral and\ncontent-based enactments. See Reed, 135 S. Ct. at 2226–27.\nReed explained that “[g]overnment regulation of speech is\ncontent based if a law applies to particular speech because of\nthe topic discussed or the idea or message expressed.” Id. at\n2227. If “a regulation of speech ‘on its face’ draws\ndistinctions based on the message a speaker conveys,” it is a\ncontent-based regulation. Id. Laws that are facially content-\nneutral, but “cannot be justified without reference to the\ncontent of the regulated speech, or that were adopted by the\ngovernment because of disagreement with the message [the\nspeech] conveys,” are also content-based and subject to\nscrutiny under a higher standard. Id. (alteration in original)\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Government\nregulations of symbolic speech frequently fall into this\nsecond category of content-based prohibitions. For instance,\nwhere a state prohibited burning the American flag because\nit might lead people to believe that the flag does not stand for\nthe positive concepts of “nationhood and national unity,” the\nCourt was quick to conclude that such “concerns blossom\nonly when a person’s treatment of the flag communicates\nsome message, and thus are related to the suppression of free\nexpression.” Johnson, 491 U.S. at 410 (internal quotation\n\f24               UNITED STATES V. SWISHER\n\nmarks omitted). Such a content-based regulation is “outside\nof O’Brien’s test altogether.” Id.\n\n    Even if a challenged restriction is content-based, it is not\nnecessarily subject to strict scrutiny. Although “[c]ontent-\nbased regulations are presumptively invalid,” the Court “has\npermitted restrictions upon the content of speech in a few\nlimited areas, which are of such slight social value as a step\nto truth that any benefit that may be derived from them is\nclearly outweighed by the social interest in order and\nmorality.” R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377, 382–83\n(1992) (internal quotation marks omitted) (indicating that\nobscenity, defamation, and fighting words fall within this\ncategory). Both the plurality and concurring opinions in\nAlvarez recognized the existence of “historical” and\ntraditional categories of content-based restrictions that are not\nsubject to strict scrutiny under the First Amendment and\nwhich courts have generally found permissible. Alvarez,\n132 S. Ct. at 2544 (Kennedy, J., plurality opinion) (explaining\nthat content-based restrictions on speech have been permitted\nonly for a “few historic and traditional categories” of speech,\nincluding incitement, obscenity, defamation, speech integral\nto criminal conduct, so-called “fighting words,” child\npornography, fraud, true threats, and “speech presenting some\ngrave and imminent threat the government has the power to\nprevent”); id. at 2553–54 (Breyer, J., concurring) (internal\nquotation marks omitted) (referencing additional “statutes\nand common-law doctrines” that make “utterance of certain\nkinds of false statements unlawful,” including torts involving\nintentional infliction of emotional distress, lying to a\ngovernment official, false claims of terrorist attacks or other\nlies about the commission of crimes or catastrophes,\nimpersonation of an officer, and trademark infringement,\namong others).\n\f                 UNITED STATES V. SWISHER                     25\n\n                               B\n\n     Applying these principles to Swisher’s facial challenge to\n§ 704(a), we first ask whether this statute regulates speech.\nIt clearly does. According to the government, the purpose of\na military medal is to communicate “that the recipient has\nserved the military efforts of the United States with valor,\nexceptional duty, or achievement worthy of commendation.”\nThe value of a military medal lies not in the materials of\nwhich it is comprised, but in its message; it is “a primitive but\neffective way of communicating ideas,” Barnette, 319 U.S. at\n632. Wearing a medal, like wearing a black armband or\nburning an American flag, conveys a message “by conduct\nthat is intended to be communicative and that, in context,\nwould reasonably be understood by the viewer to be\ncommunicative,” Clark, 468 U.S. at 294. Specifically,\nwearing a medal communicates that the wearer was awarded\nthat medal and is entitled to the nation’s recognition and\ngratitude “for acts of heroism and sacrifice in military\nservice.” Alvarez, 132 S. Ct. at 2548 (Kennedy, J., plurality\nopinion) (internal quotation mark omitted). Wearing a medal\nwithout authorization, therefore, generally communicates the\nfalse message that the wearer is entitled to such recognition\nand gratitude. Because wearing a medal is symbolic speech,\nand § 704(a) precludes the unauthorized wearing of a medal,\nwe conclude that § 704(a) regulates speech.\n\n    We next determine whether § 704(a) is a content-based or\ncontent-neutral restriction of symbolic speech. See Johnson,\n491 U.S. at 403. As in Johnson, the purpose of § 704(a) is to\nstop a particular message: the misappropriation or distortion\nof the message of valor conveyed by a medal. See Alvarez,\n132 S. Ct. at 2549 (noting the government’s argument that the\npurpose of the Stolen Valor Act is to avoid diluting “the value\n\f26                  UNITED STATES V. SWISHER\n\nand meaning of military awards”). Because these “concerns\nblossom,” Johnson, 491 U.S. at 410, only when a person’s\nunauthorized wearing of a medal communicates a false\nmessage, we conclude that § 704(a) “suppresses expression\nout of concern for its likely communicative impact,”\nEichman, 496 U.S. at 317, and is a content-based restriction\non speech.\n\n    As such, the tests applicable to content-neutral regulations\n(the time, place, or manner test, and the O’Brien test) are not\napplicable here. Johnson, 491 U.S. at 410 (stating that a\ncontent-based regulation is “outside of O’Brien’s test\naltogether”). Instead, § 704(a) “must, like a law directed at\nspeech itself, be justified by the substantial showing of need\nthat the First Amendment requires,” Johnson, 491 U.S. at\n406. In light of this analysis, we conclude that Perelman\nerred in applying the test set forth in O’Brien, which applies\nonly to content-neutral enactments.8\n\n                                    C\n\n   Because § 704(a) is a content-based regulation of false\nsymbolic speech, it is closely analogous to § 704(b). Indeed,\n\n\n 8\n    United States v. Hamilton, 699 F.3d 356 (4th Cir. 2012), engaged in a\nsimilar analysis, correctly noting that “the key factor that determines\nwhether we apply the ‘relatively lenient’ test employed in O’Brien, or the\n‘most exacting scrutiny’ standard set forth in Johnson, is whether the\nstatute being reviewed is related to the suppression of free expression.”\nId. at 370. The Fourth Circuit further acknowledged that when § 704(a)\nis construed as requiring an intent to deceive, it “could reach conduct that\nsolely involves free expression, within the holding of Johnson.” Id. at\n371. The Fourth Circuit ultimately did not determine whether § 704(a)\nwas symbolic speech because it concluded, erroneously in our view, that\n§ 704(a) survived strict scrutiny. See id.\n\f                   UNITED STATES V. SWISHER                          27\n\nboth statutes bar lies about having received a military medal.\nAccordingly, we review the constitutionality of § 704(a)\nunder the tests enunciated in the plurality and concurring\nopinions in Alvarez. If they apply to § 704(a) in the same\nmanner as they apply to § 704(b), the reasoning of Alvarez\nrequires us to hold that § 704(a) is also unconstitutional.\n\n    We begin by considering the standard set forth in Justice\nBreyer’s concurring opinion, which reviewed the\nconstitutionality of § 704(b) under a less demanding test than\nthe plurality required. As a threshold matter, Justice Breyer\ninterpreted § 704(b) favorably to the government as\nproscribing “only false factual statements made with\nknowledge of their falsity and with the intent that they be\ntaken as true.” Alvarez, 132 S. Ct. at 2552–53 (Breyer, J.,\nconcurring). We adopt the same narrowing construction of\n§ 704(a), and interpret it as proscribing unauthorized persons\nfrom wearing military medals for the purpose of falsely\ncommunicating that they have been awarded such medals.\nSee also Perelman, 695 F.3d at 871 (concluding that a person\nviolates § 704(a) only “if he or she has an intent to deceive”).\n\n    The first prong of Justice Breyer’s intermediate scrutiny\ntest requires consideration of “the seriousness of the\nspeech-related harm the provision will likely cause.” Alvarez,\n132 S. Ct. at 2551. Justice Breyer noted that the narrowing\ninterpretation of § 704(b) “diminishes the extent to which the\nstatute endangers First Amendment values.” Id. at 2553.\nBecause we have adopted the same narrowing interpretation\nfor § 704(a), the same conclusion applies.9\n\n\n 9\n   Because both § 704(a), see supra at 26–27, and § 704(b), see Alvarez,\n132 S. Ct. 2552–53, prohibit only lies made knowingly and with an intent\nto deceive, both provisions impose an identical speech-related harm:\n\f28                 UNITED STATES V. SWISHER\n\n    But like § 704(b), § 704(a) lacks the limiting features that,\nin Justice Breyer’s view, justified other statutes and common\nlaw doctrines punishing the communication of false\nstatements. Id. at 2553–54. Section 704(a) does not require\n“proof of specific harm to identifiable victims,” or that\n“someone was deceived into following a course [of action] he\nwould not have pursued but for the deceitful conduct,” or\nspecify “that the lies be made in contexts in which a tangible\nharm to others is especially likely to occur.” See id. at 2254\n(alteration in original) (internal citations and quotation marks\nomitted). Nor is § 704(a) limited to false statements that “are\nparticularly likely to produce harm.” See id. Accordingly,\nwe conclude that under Justice Breyer’s test, § 704(a), like\n§ 704(b), “creates a significant risk of First Amendment\nharm.” Id. at 2555.\n\n    Arguing against this conclusion, the government asserts\nthat § 704(a) is analogous to statutes prohibiting trademark\ninfringement such as the Lanham Act, since it prevents\nmisappropriation of governmental property. Justice Breyer\nrejected a similar argument, concluding that § 704(b) had a\nbroader reach than trademark statutes, which are typically\n“focused upon commercial and promotional activities that are\nlikely to dilute the value of a mark,” and would “typically\nrequire a showing of likely confusion, a showing that tends to\nassure that the feared harm will in fact take place.” Id. at\n\n\nburdening the speech of a person who intentionally chooses to lie, see\nAlvarez, 132 S. Ct. at 2555–56. And in prosecuting either statute, the\ngovernment would be required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that\nthe defendant had the requisite mens rea. Therefore, we reject the\ndissent’s argument that § 704(b) would have a greater chilling effect and\npose a greater risk of selective prosecution than § 704(a) because a person\ncould thoughtlessly lie but could not thoughtlessly wear an unauthorized\nmedal. Dis. op. at 41.\n\f                UNITED STATES V. SWISHER                  29\n\n2554. Because § 704(a) has the same broad reach as\n§ 704(b), and likewise does not require that a specified harm\n(such as public confusion) will take place, the same analysis\napplies here, and we likewise reject the government’s\ncontention.\n\n    In reaching the conclusion that suppressing a symbolic\ncommunication threatens the same First Amendment harm as\nsuppressing a spoken communication, we again part ways\nwith Perelman. Although Perelman distinguished § 704(a)\nfrom § 704(b) on the ground that “[t]he use of a physical\nobject goes beyond mere speech and suggests that the wearer\nhas proof of the lie, or government endorsement of it,”\n695 F.3d at 871, we see no basis for Perelman’s conclusion\nthat wearing a medal is more probative than speaking a lie.\nCf. Kevin Jon Heller, The Cognitive Psychology of\nCircumstantial Evidence, 105 Mich. L. Rev. 241, 248–52\n(2006) (noting, as an empirical matter, that jurors give more\nweight to testimony, such as eyewitness identifications and\nconfessions, than to physical evidence, such as blood and\nfingerprints). As a practical matter, the government’s\nconcession at oral argument that military medals are freely\navailable for purchase confirms that the probative value of\nowning a medal or other military decoration is minimal. In\nany event, wearing a medal has no purpose other than to\ncommunicate a message. We therefore see no principled\nbasis for distinguishing a spoken communication from a\nsymbolic communication in this context.\n\n    We also reject Perelman’s reasoning that § 704(a) is like\nthe statutes described in Alvarez that prohibit impersonation\nof government officials, like 18 U.S.C. § 912, or the\nunauthorized wearing of military uniforms, like 18 U.S.C.\n§ 702, which the Court assumed (without deciding) was valid.\n\f30              UNITED STATES V. SWISHER\n\nSee 695 F.3d at 872 (citing Schacht, 398 U.S. at 61). As\nJustice Breyer pointed out, “[s]tatutes forbidding\nimpersonation of a public official typically focus on acts of\nimpersonation, not mere speech, and may require a showing\nthat, for example, someone was deceived into following a\ncourse [of action] he would not have pursued but for the\ndeceitful conduct.” Alvarez, 132 S. Ct. at 2554 (Breyer, J.,\nconcurring) (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). But § 704(a), like § 704(b), requires no act beyond\nthe false communication itself. While there is a quantum of\nconduct involved in pinning on a medal, it is not materially\ndifferent from the quantum of conduct involved in speaking\nor writing. Nor does § 704(a) require proof that anyone was\ndeceived into taking a course of action. We also reject\nPerelman’s reliance on Schacht to support its conclusion that\n§ 704(a) survives First Amendment scrutiny. Schacht itself\nmerely held that even if the government could constitutionally\nprohibit a person from wearing a military uniform without\nauthorization, Congress may not make “it a crime for an actor\nwearing a military uniform to say things during his\nperformance critical of the conduct or policies of the Armed\nForces.” 398 U.S. at 62–63; see also R.A.V., 505 U.S. at\n430–31 (interpreting Schacht as precluding viewpoint\ndiscrimination). Neither Schacht nor any other Supreme\nCourt case examined a First Amendment challenge to statutes\nprecluding wearing military uniforms without authorization,\nand both the Alvarez plurality and concurring opinion\nindicated that laws prohibiting impersonation of an officer are\ndistinguishable from false claims of entitlement to a military\n\f                    UNITED STATES V. SWISHER                            31\n\nmedal. See Alvarez, 132 S. Ct. at 2546 (Kennedy, J., plurality\nopinion); id. at 2254 (Breyer, J., concurring).10\n\n    The second prong of Justice Breyer’s intermediate\nscrutiny test requires an evaluation of “the nature and\nimportance of the provision’s countervailing objectives.” Id.\nat 2551. We conclude that the government had the same\ncompelling interest in enacting § 704(a) as it did in enacting\n§ 704(b): in both cases, the government has a “substantial\ncountervailing objective” of avoiding dilution of “the\ncountry’s recognition of [award recipients’] sacrifice in the\nform of military honors.” Id. at 2555; see also Hamilton,\n699 F.3d at 371 (“Accordingly, we hold that the\ngovernment’s interest in preserving the integrity of the\nsystem honoring military members for their achievements and\nsacrifices is compelling.”).11\n\n    Finally, we consider the third prong of Justice Breyer’s\ntest: “the extent to which the provision will tend to achieve\nthose objectives, and whether there are other, less restrictive\nways of doing so.” Alvarez, 132 S. Ct. at 2551. As explained\nin Alvarez, Congress could adopt narrowing strategies to limit\n\n  10\n     Contrary to the dissent, our analysis does not necessarily invalidate\n18 U.S.C. § 709. Cf. Dis. op at 37–38. Because § 709 is limited to\nprecluding false representations in certain limited contexts (such as in the\nfield of banking, finance, or law enforcement) where “a tangible harm to\nothers is especially likely to occur,” Alvarez, 132 S. Ct. at 2554 (Breyer,\nJ., plurality opinion), it is distinguishable from § 704(a).\n  11\n    We are sympathetic to the dissent’s description of the government’s\npowerful interest in protecting the message of valor and heroism that is\nconveyed by a medal. Dis. op. at 43–46. But because we already\nconclude that the government’s interest in preventing the wearing of\nunauthorized medals is compelling, the dissent’s further elaboration does\nnot affect our First Amendment analysis.\n\f32                 UNITED STATES V. SWISHER\n\nthe breadth of the prohibition, and could establish\n“information-disseminating devices,” such as “an accurate,\npublicly available register of military awards, easily\nobtainable by political opponents.” Id. at 2556. These\nalternative means to meeting the government’s goals in\nenacting § 704(b) would be equally effective to meet the\ngovernment’s stated goals for § 704(a), namely to preserve\nthe integrity of the military honors system and protect the\nsymbolic value of military medals.12\n\n    Given that the statute fails Justice Breyer’s intermediate\nscrutiny test, it also fails under the plurality’s exacting\nscrutiny test. See id. at 2543 (Kennedy, J., plurality\nopinion).13 The plurality’s conclusion that the compelling\ninterest served by § 704(b) could be satisfied by a database of\nmedal winners, and that there is an insufficient causal link\nbetween the government’s compelling interest and the\nrestriction “on the false claims of liars,” is equally applicable\nto § 704(a). See id. at 2549–50.\n\n\n\n\n  12\n    The dissent’s arguments to the contrary, see Dis. op. at 47–48, are\nbased on its view that symbolic speech involving a physical emblem is\nqualitatively different than spoken or written speech, a position\ninconsistent with Johnson. 491 U.S. at 403–04. For the same reason, we\ndisagree with Hamilton’s conclusion that § 704(a) survives strict scrutiny\nbecause a database is inadequate to counter symbolic speech involving a\nphysical object. 699 F.3d at 373.\n  13\n    Although Alvarez lacked a majority opinion, we need not determine\nwhether the plurality opinion or Justice Breyer’s opinion constitutes the\nholding of the Court, see Marks v. United States, 430 U.S. 188, 193\n(1977), because we reach the same conclusion under either standard.\n\f                   UNITED STATES V. SWISHER                          33\n\n                                   V\n\n    Alvarez clarified that lies do not fall into a category of\nspeech that is excepted from First Amendment protection.\n132 S. Ct. at 2546–47 (Kennedy, J., plurality opinion); id. at\n2553 (Breyer, J., concurring). Given that clarification, our\nanalysis follows a familiar road. Content-based prohibitions\nof speech and symbolic speech are analyzed under the same\nframework, and so Alvarez dictates our conclusion that\n§ 704(a) violates the First Amendment. Because § 704(a)\nwas unconstitutionally applied to Swisher’s conduct, the\ndistrict court erred in denying Swisher relief under 28 U.S.C.\n§ 2255. We therefore reverse the district court and overrule\nPerelman to the extent inconsistent with this opinion.14\n\n       REVERSED.\n\n\n\n\n  14\n     The government also argues that § 704(a) is not subject to the First\nAmendment because military medals convey government speech. In\nsupport, the government relies on Walker v. Texas Division, Sons of\nConfederate Veterans, Inc., which held that Texas could reject a proposed\ndesign for specialty license plates without violating the First Amendment\nbecause license plate designs constitute government speech. 135 S. Ct.\n2239, 2243–45 (2015). But § 704(a) does not regulate the design of\nmilitary medals or other government speech; rather, it punishes an\nindividual’s false communication regarding the entitlement to wear a\nmilitary medal. As such, Walker does not help the government here.\n\f34              UNITED STATES V. SWISHER\n\nBYBEE, Circuit Judge, dissenting, with whom N.R. SMITH\nand WATFORD, Circuit Judges, join:\n\n    Xavier Alvarez announced in a public meeting that he\nwas a former Marine and had been awarded the\nCongressional Medal of Honor. When the United States\nprosecuted Alvarez for “falsely represent[ing] himself . . .\nverbally” as having received a military decoration or medal,\n18 U.S.C. § 704(b) (2011 ed.), the Supreme Court held that\nhis speech was protected by the First Amendment. United\nStates v. Alvarez, 132 S. Ct. 2537, 2551 (2012) (Kennedy, J.)\n(plurality opinion); id. at 2556 (Breyer, J., concurring in the\njudgment). Elven Swisher took Alvarez one step better: he\nnot only said he was a decorated soldier, he proved it by\nwearing his Marine Corps League uniform with five\nmedals—including a Silver Star, a Purple Heart, and the\nNavy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal with a bronze\n“V.” Like Alvarez, Swisher was an undeserving claimant;\nalthough a veteran, he had not earned a single one of the\ncommendations he wore. As in Alvarez, the United States\nindicted Swisher under the Stolen Valor Act, but this time it\naccused him of violating § 704(a), which prohibits\n“knowingly wear[ing] . . . any decoration or medal authorized\nby Congress . . . except when authorized.” 18 U.S.C.\n§ 704(a) (2002 ed.).\n\n    The majority today holds that Swisher’s conduct is a form\nof speech entitled to the same protection as Alvarez’s actual\nspeech. I beg to differ. The Supreme Court’s decision in\nAlvarez does not compel the result here. The law has always\nbeen able to tell the difference between conduct and speech,\neven when the conduct may have some communicative value.\nI respectfully dissent.\n\f                 UNITED STATES V. SWISHER                    35\n\n                               I\n\n    Alvarez held that false statements are not categorically\nunprotected by the First Amendment. Alvarez, 132 S. Ct. at\n2545–47 (Kennedy, J.) (plurality opinion); id. at 2552–53\n(Breyer, J., concurring in the judgment). As Justice Breyer\nexplained, the government can have little interest in policing\nthe “white lies” we tell to “provide the sick with comfort, or\npreserve a child’s innocence,” or false statements made “in\ntechnical, philosophical, and scientific contexts, where . . .\nexamination of a false statement . . . can promote a form of\nthought that ultimately helps realize the truth.” Id. at 2553\n(Breyer, J., concurring in the judgment). But the Court\nstopped well short of protecting lying generally. As Justice\nKennedy reminded us, “there are instances in which the\nfalsity of speech bears upon whether it is protected.” Id. at\n2546 (plurality opinion).\n\n     The statute at issue here, however, does not police “white\nlies,” nor does it prohibit lying generally. Instead, it targets\na very specific lie that implicates a very specific government\ninterest, an interest which the full court here and the Supreme\nCourt in Alvarez agrees is significant. And importantly, the\nlie the government wishes to punish cannot be uttered with\nwords; it can only be accomplished by falsely wearing the\nnation’s medals. Although the Court in Alvarez found that\nthe harm caused by the form of the lie regulated by § 704(b)\ndid not outweigh the First Amendment harm, the interests\nimplicated by § 704(a) must be weighed differently from\nthose at issue in Alvarez under § 704(b). The harm to the\ngovernment’s interest in upholding the military honors\nsystem caused by the false wearing of its medals is greater\nthan the harm caused by “bar stool braggadocio.” Alvarez,\n132 S. Ct. at 2555 (Breyer, J., concurring in the judgment).\n\f36                   UNITED STATES V. SWISHER\n\nConcomitantly, because § 704(a) requires proof of deceptive\nconduct, any harm to First Amendment interests is less than\nin Alvarez, and the less restrictive alternatives discussed in\nAlvarez, less effective.\n\n    The majority today ignores these distinctions, and\ndiscusses the outcome of this case as though Alvarez renders\nit a foregone conclusion. But it is not. Alvarez does not\nclearly compel the result here—indeed, that was the\nconclusion reached by a panel of our court in United States v.\nPerelman, 695 F.3d 866, 872–73 (9th Cir. 2012), in which we\nupheld § 704(a) under the lesser scrutiny applied to conduct\nregulations laid out in O’Brien.1 It was also the conclusion\nreached by the Fourth Circuit, which found that § 704(a)\nwould survive strict scrutiny. United States v. Hamilton,\n699 F.3d 356, 371–74 (4th Cir. 2012). While I do not entirely\nagree with the reasoning in these cases, they demonstrate that\nthe reach—and indeed the holding—of Alvarez is unclear.\nAlvarez gives uncertain guidance as to how false statements\nshould be analyzed, especially if Justice Breyer’s opinion\ncontrols under Marks v. United States, 430 U.S. 188, 193\n(1977).2 Justice Breyer, writing for himself and Justice\nKagan, applies what he describes as “intermediate scrutiny,”\nAlvarez, 132 S. Ct. at 2556, although without really\nexplaining why that is the proper test.\n\n\n 1\n      United States v. O’Brien, 391 U.S. 367 (1968).\n  2\n    Justice Kennedy, writing for himself and three others, applies strict\nscrutiny to § 704(b)’s “content-based restrictions.” Alvarez, 132 S. Ct. at\n2548 (Kennedy, J.) (plurality). In dissent, Justice Alito, joined by two\nothers, would have held that Alvarez’s false statement “merit[ed] no First\nAmendment protection.” Id. at 2563 (Alito, J., dissenting). Justice\nBreyer’s opinion is the narrowest opinion that a majority of the Court\nagreed upon. Marks, 430 U.S. at 193.\n\f                   UNITED STATES V. SWISHER                          37\n\n    Part of the analytical challenge of Alvarez is trying to\nunderstand why intermediate scrutiny applies. In Perelman,\nthe panel used the O’Brien test. 695 F.3d at 872. I can’t\nagree with the Perelman panel on that point because § 704(a)\nseems to violate at least one prong of O’Brien: The\nGovernment’s interest in § 704(a) is not “unrelated to the\nsuppression of free expression.” O’Brien, 391 U.S. at 377;\nsee also Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 410 (1989). For that\nreason, the Fourth Circuit did not apply O’Brien, but\nultimately concluded the statute would survive strict scrutiny.\nHamilton, 699 F.3d at 371. The anomaly is, as Judge Davis\npointed out, that § 704(a) survives strict scrutiny, but would\nfail O’Brien’s version of intermediate scrutiny. Id. at 377\n(Davis, J., concurring).3\n\n    Despite this ambiguity, the majority goes out of its way\nto extend Alvarez where it does not clearly apply. Moreover,\nthe majority fails to consider the consequences of our\ndecision. In addition to creating an unnecessary split with the\nFourth Circuit over a statute that is no longer in effect,4\n\n\n 3\n   In my view, § 704(a) should be reviewed under intermediate scrutiny\nand treated as an “impersonation of a war hero” statute. See Alvarez,\n132 S. Ct. at 2554 (Breyer, J., concurring in the judgment) (noting that\n§ 704(b) differs from anti-impersonation statutes because they typically\nprohibit “acts of impersonation, not mere speech” ); see also id. at\n2553–55 (discussing examples of the “many statutes and common-law\ndoctrines [that] make the utterance of certain kinds of false statements\nunlawful”). Unlike § 704(b), we deal here with something more than\n“mere speech.”\n     4\n    Both provisions of the Stolen Valor Act were amended following\nAlvarez, subsequent to the events that gave rise to Swisher’s case.\nCongress removed the “wearing” provision in § 704(a), apparently\npreemptively, and more substantively revised § 704(b) to comply with the\nCourt’s holding in Alvarez. See Stolen Valor Act of 2013, Pub. L. No.\n\f38                  UNITED STATES V. SWISHER\n\ntoday’s decision calls into question the validity of numerous\nother statutes that prohibit, for example: the unauthorized\nwearing of a military uniform, 18 U.S.C. § 702—which the\nSupreme Court has noted is “a valid statute on its face,”\nSchacht v. United States, 398 U.S. 58, 61 (1970); the\nunauthorized use of the name of federal agencies, 18 U.S.C.\n§ 709; or the impersonation of a federal officer, 18 U.S.C.\n§ 912—a statute we upheld in United States v. Tomsha-\nMiguel, 766 F.3d 1041, 1048–49 (9th Cir. 2014), a case in\nwhich we relied on Perelman (which we now overturn).5 In\nlight of this, I see no reason to extend Alvarez to § 704(a), in\norder to protect deceptive conduct that has no First\nAmendment value, and which poses greater harm to the\ngovernment’s significant interest in upholding the military\nhonors system than did the speech covered by § 704(b).\n\n\n\n\n113-12, § 2, 127 Stat. 448 (2013). Thus, the precise provisions at issue\nhere are no longer in effect. As amended, however, the statute would still\nappear to cover Swisher’s conduct. Section 704(b) now reads: “Whoever,\nwith intent to obtain money, property, or other tangible benefit,\nfraudulently holds oneself out to be a recipient of a decoration or medal\n. . . shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than one year, or\nboth.” 127 Stat. 448.\n 5\n    Consider also: 18 U.S.C. § 703 (unauthorized wearing of a uniform of\na friendly nation); § 706 (wearing of Red Cross with the fraudulent\npurpose of inducing the belief that wearer is a member or agent of the Red\nCross); and § 706a (wearing of Geneva distinctive emblem (Red Crescent\nor Red Crystal) with fraudulent purpose of inducing the belief that wearer\nis a member or agent of an authorized national society using the emblem,\nthe International Committee of the Red Cross, or the International\nFederation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies).\n\f                 UNITED STATES V. SWISHER                     39\n\n                               II\n\n    The majority concludes that the Supreme Court’s decision\nin Alvarez dictates the outcome of this case, identifying three\nfactors from Justice Breyer’s concurring opinion in Alvarez,\nand mechanically applying them to the statute at issue here.\nMaj. Op. at 26–32. For the reasons I have explained, I agree\nwith the majority that Justice Breyer’s analysis controls and\nthat the relevant factors are: (1) “the seriousness of the\nspeech-related harm the provision will likely cause”; (2) “the\nnature and importance of the provision’s countervailing\nobjectives”; and (3) “the extent to which the provision will\ntend to achieve those objectives, and whether there are other,\nless restrictive ways of doing so.” Alvarez, 132 S. Ct. at\n2551. Yet in applying these factors, the majority fails to\naccount for the crucial differences between § 704(b) and\n§ 704(a)—and indeed, fails to engage in much critical\nanalysis at all. I am going to address each of the factors in\nturn.\n\n                               A\n\n    In analyzing the speech-related harm caused by § 704(a),\nthe majority concludes that § 704(a) works the same speech-\nrelated harm as § 704(b) because it “lacks the limiting\nfeatures that, in Justice Breyer’s view, justified other statutes\nand common law doctrines punishing the communication of\nfalse statements.” Maj. Op. at 28. I have two points. First,\nI part ways with the majority’s premise that speech and\ncommunicative conduct are the same for First Amendment\npurposes. In O’Brien, the Supreme Court rejected “the view\nthat an apparently limitless variety of conduct can be labeled\n‘speech’ whenever the person engaged in the conduct intends\nthereby to express an idea.” 391 U.S. at 376. Here, the\n\f40                  UNITED STATES V. SWISHER\n\nmajority doesn’t just blur the lines between conduct and\nspeech, it simply erases them: It finds that the “quantum of\nconduct involved in pinning on a medal . . . is not materially\ndifferent from the quantum of conduct involved in speaking\nor writing.” Maj. Op. at 30. With all respect, that just isn’t\ntrue. If it were, then we could save ourselves trouble and\nmoney by simply announcing that we are awarding medals\nwithout actually giving the recipients anything. But as\nanyone knows who has witnessed the President awarding the\nCongressional Medal of Honor or a promotion ceremony\npinning a new officer—or even an Olympic medals ceremony\nor a Cub Scout court of honor—there is value, both symbolic\nand tactile, in the awarding of a physical emblem. If there is\nimportant value in the act of awarding a physical medal, there\nis important value in the wearing of it.6\n\n\n\n\n  6\n    The majority notes, twice, that distinguishing between pure speech,\nlike false statements, and “symbolic speech” conveyed through conduct,\nlike the unauthorized wearing of a military medal, is inconsistent with\nTexas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397 (1989). Maj. Op. at 20–21 n.6, 32 n.12.\nThis reference to Johnson is puzzling. Johnson is relevant only if we must\nanalyze this statute under strict scrutiny as a content-based restriction on\nspeech. See Johnson, 491 U.S. at 411–12 (applying strict scrutiny to a\nstatute prohibiting the burning of the American flag). But Justice Breyer’s\nconcurrence in Alvarez, on which the majority bases its entire analysis,\nclearly departs from this traditional First Amendment framework,\nanalyzing restrictions on false speech under an intermediate scrutiny,\nbalancing-of-interests approach Justice Breyer refers to as\n“proportionality.” Alvarez, 132 S. Ct. at 2551–52 (Breyer, J., concurring\nin the judgment). Moreover, as I have already noted, in analyzing false\nspeech, Justice Breyer specifically distinguishes between “mere speech”\nand “acts of impersonation where an act of impersonation is more likely\nto cause harm. Id. at 2554 (emphasis in original). Johnson is irrelevant\nhere.\n\f                    UNITED STATES V. SWISHER                            41\n\n    Second, even if there isn’t a relevant difference in content\nbetween the lie represented by saying one has a medal and the\ndeceit communicated by actually wearing it, the majority\nnever grapples with the speech-related harms that Justice\nBreyer focused on in striking down § 704(b), and therefore\nfails to consider whether there is any difference between the\ntwo situations that alters the need for the “limiting features”\ndiscussed in Alvarez. For example, Justice Breyer was\nparticularly concerned with the potential chilling effect of\n§ 704(b), because individuals would worry about “being\nprosecuted for a careless false statement” even if they lacked\nthe requisite mens rea, and so would curtail their own speech.\nAlvarez, 132 S. Ct. at 2555. It makes little sense, however, to\nextend this principle—that people sometimes thoughtlessly\nsay things that they don’t really mean—to the context of\n§ 704(a). Here, by contrast, it seems unlikely that an\nindividual could carelessly or negligently wear a military\nmedal with the intent to deceive. Thus, there is less danger\nhere that individuals will self-censor their sartorial choices\nfor fear of being prosecuted for negligent speech.7\n\n    There is also much less ambiguity in the wearing of a\nmilitary medal, and that diminishes the risk of selective\nprosecution under this provision. Id. at 2555 Breyer, J.,\nconcurring in the judgment) (noting the risk that § 704(b)\n\n\n   7\n     For reasons the panel explained in Perelman, because we must read\n§ 704(a) to prohibit only the wearing of a medal with the intent to deceive,\nthe statute does not apply to anyone wearing a medal in a theatrical\nproduction, as part of a Halloween costume, or in protest as a political\nstatement. 695 F.3d at 870 (listing these and other examples). In these\nsituations, we will readily recognize that the wearer is making no claim to\nbeing a medal recipient. The only person who can be prosecuted under\n§ 704(a) is one who is lying and wants us to rely on his possession of the\nmedal as proof of his valor. There is no First Amendment value in that lie.\n\f42                 UNITED STATES V. SWISHER\n\nmay be applied “subtly but selectively to speakers that the\nGovernment does not like,” particularly in the political\narena). Human speech is often ambiguous and subject to\ndifferent interpretations. As a result, speech subject to\n§ 704(b) must be understood in context, and thus is more\neasily subject to manipulation and “the risk of censorious\nselectivity by prosecutors.” Id. As judges, we are familiar\nwith the dangers of reading a cold record and trying to supply\nvoice inflection, facial expression, and body language.8 For\ngood reason, we defer to the fact-finders who have actually\nseen the witnesses to judge their demeanor as a measure of\ntheir truthfulness. See e.g., Anderson v. Bessemer City,\n470 U.S. 564, 575 (1985) (“[O]nly the trial judge can be\naware of the variations in demeanor and tone of voice that\nbear so heavily on the listener’s understanding of and belief\nin what is said.”); United States v. Raddatz, 447 U.S. 667,\n679 (1980) (“‘The most careful note must often fail to\nconvey the evidence fully in some of its most important\nelements. . . . It cannot give the look or manner of the\nwitness: his hesitations, his doubts, his variations of language,\nhis confidence or precipitancy, his calmness or\nconsideration.’” (quoting Queen v. Bertrand, 16 Eng. Rep.\n391, 399 (1867))).\n\n\n\n\n   8\n     Consider, for example, Charlie Chaplin’s classic exchange in The\nGreat Dictator (1940). When Chaplin mutters “this is a fine country to\nlive in,” he is arrested, but escapes punishment by explaining that all he\nsaid was “this is a fine country to live in.” Joseph G. Brennan, A\nHandbook of Logic 213 (2d ed. 1961) (describing this an example of the\ninformal “fallacy of accent”). See also Watts v. United States, 394 U.S.\n705, 708 (1969) (overturning the petitioner’s conviction for threatening\nthe President because his statement, made at a political rally opposing the\nVietnam war, was simply “crude” “political hyperbole,” not a true threat).\n\f                UNITED STATES V. SWISHER                   43\n\n    By contrast, wearing clothing, particularly with the\nprecision demanded when one dons a military uniform, is far\nless ambiguous than the vagaries of human speech. The very\nnature of a uniform suggests that once we recognize the\ndistinctive colors and insignia, we know immediately whether\nwe are dealing with the local constabulary or a member of the\nnation’s armed forces, whether the service member is wearing\nthe camouflage of the ground forces or the crisp whites of the\nnavy, whether the service member belongs to the armored\ndivision or the medical corps, and whether the member is\ncommissioned or non-commissioned. In the same vein, we\ncan discern, without any words being exchanged, the\ncampaigns in which the member has participated and whether\nthe member has been decorated for actions in combat.\nIndeed, so clear is our understanding of the meaning of the\nuniform that no voice inflection or body language can\ncountermand what we have seen for ourselves. Elven\nSwisher didn’t have to tell anyone that his Purple Heart meant\nthat he had been wounded in battle, or that his Navy and\nMarine Corps Commendation Medal was awarded for valor.\n\n    Contrary to the majority’s assertion that there is no\nprincipled distinction between § 704(a) and § 704(b), Maj.\nOp. at 29, § 704(a) engenders less potential constitutional\nharm than § 704(b), because there is less risk to the First\nAmendment in the government identifying and policing\nspecific instances of deceptive conduct than in trying to\npolice the line between false and true statements.\n\n                              B\n\n    The false wearing of military medals poses significantly\ngreater harm to the government’s interests than does mere\nfalse speech. That means that, contrary to the majority’s\n\f44               UNITED STATES V. SWISHER\n\nassertion, Maj. Op. at 31, the government’s objectives here\nare not precisely the same as those at issue under § 704(b).\nThe United States has a powerful interest in protecting the\nintegrity of its military decorations. Indeed, Congress has\npunished the wearing, manufacture, or sale of military\ndecorations without authorization since 1923. See Act of\nFeb. 24, 1923, ch. 110, 42 Stat. 1286. The wearing of an\nunearned military medal dilutes the message conveyed by the\nmedal itself. Even if the wearer is later exposed as a liar, the\nutility of the medal as a symbol of government\ncommendation has been undermined. The public can no\nlonger trust that the medal actually is a symbol of government\ncommendation, i.e., that the person wearing the medal has\nactually earned it. This results in a different, more concrete\nharm than that which may arise from the false statement that\none has earned a military medal. It is one thing to say that\none has been decorated; it is quite another to produce the\nevidence for it by appropriating a symbol that the\ngovernment, through decades of effort, has imbued with a\nparticular message. Unlike false statements, which may work\nharm by giving the public the general impression that more\npersonnel earn military honors than actually do, the false\nwearing of medals directly undermines the government’s\nability to mark out specific worthy individuals, because the\nsymbol the government uses to convey this message can no\nlonger be trusted. This may also mean that those who\nrightfully wear a military medal are less likely to be believed.\n\n    In this respect, a military medal is akin to a trademark: a\nsymbol that denotes a particular level of quality, or\nworthiness. See Alvarez, 132 S. Ct. at 2554 (Breyer, J.,\nconcurring in the judgment) (“Statutes prohibiting trademark\ninfringement present, perhaps, the closest analogy to the\npresent statute.”). As Justice Breyer recognized in Alvarez,\n\f                UNITED STATES V. SWISHER                    45\n\na false claim regarding a military medal “creates confusion\nabout who is entitled to wear it, thus diluting its value to\nthose who have earned it, to their families, and to their\ncountry.” Id. Although in Alvarez, Justice Breyer ultimately\nconcluded that the confusion caused by false statements was\nnot sufficient to outweigh the constitutional harm caused by\nthe statute, here, the calculus is different, because § 704(a)\ncreates less risk of constitutional harm, and because the\nwearing of an unearned medal offers more convincing proof\nof the lie than a mere false statement.\n\n    The false and deceptive wearing of military medals\n“dilutes the value” of military honors generally, by conveying\nthe impression that “everyone” earns them. Moreover, such\nconduct also dilutes the symbolic value of the medal itself,\nhampering the government’s ability to reward those it has\nconcluded are worthy of recognition. The purpose of a\nmilitary medal is not only that it conveys the government’s\nappreciation for an individual’s service to the individual, but\nthat it conveys the government’s commendation of that\nindividual to others, identifying the medal winner “as an\nexample worthy of emulation.” United States v. Alvarez,\n617 F.3d 1198, 1234 (9th Cir. 2010) (Bybee, J., dissenting).\nThe value of the military medal, like the value of a trademark,\nis that it is both recognizable and publicly understood to\nconvey a specific message: in this case, the message that the\nwearer has done something worthy of admiration. When\nthose who are unworthy are allowed to wear the medal, the\ngovernment can no longer identify its heroes in a way that is\neasily discernible by the public.\n\n   To be clear, this harm does not occur when an unearned\nmedal is worn for purposes of art, theater, political\nexpression, or the like. It is only when the medal-wearer\n\f46                  UNITED STATES V. SWISHER\n\nwears the medal in order to appropriate the message\nconveyed by the medal—that the wearer has actually earned\na military honor—that the medal’s symbolic value is diluted.\nElven Swisher, however, was not wearing his false military\nmedals for purposes of art, political expression, intellectual\ndebate, or even any of the “innocent” reasons people may lie.\nHe wore his medals to support the elaborate story he had\nconcocted to fraudulently obtain disability benefits from the\ngovernment. He even wore his fraudulent medals to\nembellish his credibility when testifying at a criminal trial\n(not his own). See United States v. Hinkson, 585 F.3d 1247\n(9th Cir. 2009) (en banc), as amended, 611 F.3d 1098 (9th\nCir. 2010).9 It is absurd to argue that allowing someone like\nSwisher to wear unearned military honors in the course of\nimpersonating a war hero does not do significant damage to\nthe value of the genuine honor bestowed on those who have\nsacrificed for their country.\n\n\n\n  9\n    Swisher testified as a government witness in a federal murder-for-hire\ncase, appearing on the witness stand with a Purple Heart pinned to his\nlapel. Hinkson, 585 F.3d at 1254. Swisher testified that the defendant in\nthat case, David Hinkson, had heard about his impressive military service\nrecord and had wanted to hire him to torture and kill a federal judge, an\nAUSA, and an IRS agent. During the course of the trial, Hinkson’s\nlawyers called Swisher’s credibility into serious question, on the basis that\nhis “reissued” military discharge papers, which detailed the military\nhonors Swisher had supposedly won, could not be authenticated. See id.\nat 1251–57 (recapping the Hinkson trial and Swisher’s role); see also\nUnited States v. Hinkson, 611 F.3d 1098 (9th Cir. 2010) (en banc)\n(amending the original en banc opinion); id. at 1099 (W. Fletcher, J.,\ndissenting) (discussing in even more detail Swisher’s relationship with\nHinkson and the Hinkson trial). The parties here agreed that Swisher’s\nconduct at the Hinkson trial would not be introduced at his own trial.\nSwisher was indicted based on a photograph showing that he had worn his\nfalse medals to a Marine Corps League event.\n\f                 UNITED STATES V. SWISHER                    47\n\n                               C\n\n    Finally, there are fewer less restrictive regulatory\nalternatives available to the government where the\nunauthorized and deceptive wearing of a military medal is\nconcerned. To be sure, the statutory provision at issue here\npunishes the same kind of lie at issue in Alvarez. But the fact\nthat the lie here is told in a more effective way, with physical\nproof in the form of the medal to support the false claim of\nentitlement, increases the harm caused by the lie and also\nmeans that other, less restrictive means are less likely to be\neffective. Justice Breyer noted that many statutes punishing\nfalse statements require some showing of actual or likely\nharm resulting from the lie and suggested that “a more finely\ntailored statue might . . . insist upon a showing that the false\nstatement caused specific harm or at least was material, or\nfocus its coverage on lies most likely to be harmful or on\ncontexts where such lies are most likely to cause harm.”\nAlvarez, 132 S. Ct. at 2556 (Breyer, J., concurring in the\njudgment).       Section 704(a) satisfies Justice Breyer’s\nconcerns. First, the harm caused by the false wearing of\nmilitary medals is material. It is material to the message\nconveyed by the medals themselves. When pretenders wear\nmedals, the medal itself can no longer be taken as a sign that\nthe wearer has earned it and is therefore worthy of\ncommendation. Second, § 704(a) is confined to a single\ncontext—the intentional wearing of medals when the wearer\nintends to deceive—where it is most likely to cause harm.\n\n    Moreover, “counterspeech” will be less effective in\ncorrecting the falsehood conveyed by deceptively wearing an\nunearned military decoration. See Alvarez, 132 S. Ct. at\n2549–50 (Kennedy, J.) (plurality opinion); id. at 2556\n(Breyer, J., concurring in the judgment). One could denounce\n\f48                 UNITED STATES V. SWISHER\n\nSwisher as an impostor, but as the Fourth Circuit explained,\n“speech may not effectively counter that which a person\nsees.” Hamilton, 699 F.3d at 373. One could, perhaps,\nengage in a war of words with Alvarez, but Swisher, who has\nthe medals on his uniform, occupies the high ground.\n\n    Finally, the majority, following Alvarez, 132 S. Ct. at\n2550–51 (Kennedy, J.) (plurality opinion); id. at 2556\n(Breyer, J., concurring in the judgment), proposes a database\nof medal winners as a means to counteract Swisher’s\ndeception.10 Maj. Op. at 31–32. To my mind, this is no\nsolution at all to the problem of individuals falsely wearing\nmedals. If the public has to check the database to confirm\nthat a medal wearer actually earned the medal, the purpose of\nthe medal itself is utterly defeated. If we can no longer trust\nwhat we can see, the only honor the United States can confer\non its heroes is a listing in a database. Once wearing the\nmedal itself doesn’t signify anything more than a\npresumption of a property right, the nation’s highest honors\nwill have become, literally, virtual.\n\n                                   III\n\n    I would uphold the constitutionality of §704(a).                    I\nrespectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n     10\n       The majority, quoting Alvarez, refers to the database as an\n“‘information-disseminating device’” for confirming that the medal wearer\nhas actually earned the military honor. Maj. Op. at 31–32 (quoting\nAlvarez, 132 S. Ct. at 2556 (Breyer, J., concurring in the judgment)).\nAlthough it is low-tech, we already have such an “information-\ndisseminating device”: the medal.\n\f",

In addition,\nthe government waived a procedural default defense based on\nthe defendant’s failure to raise his constitutional claim at trial\nor on direct appeal.\n\n    The en banc court held that § 704(a) regulated speech\nbecause wearing a medal conveys a message. The court held\nthat § 704(a) was a content-based restriction of false symbolic\nspeech because its purpose was to stop a particular message:\nthe misappropriation or distortion of the message of valor\nconveyed by a medal. Accordingly, the tests applicable to\ncontent-neutral regulations did not apply.\n\n\n\n\n  *\n    This summary constitutes no part of the opinion of the court.

The court held that this narrowing interpretation\ndiminished the extent to which § 704(a) endangered First\nAmendment values, but the statute lacked limiting features\nsuch as a requirement of proof of specific harm to identifiable\nvictims. Accordingly, under Justice Breyer’s test, § 704(a)\ncreated a significant risk of First Amendment harm. The en\nbanc court concluded that the government had a compelling\ninterest in enacting § 704(a), but there were other, less\nrestrictive ways of achieving those objectives.\n\n   The en banc court concluded that § 704(a) failed Justice\nBreyer’s intermediate scrutiny test, and therefore also failed\nunder the Alvarez plurality’s exacting scrutiny test.\n\n    The en banc court overruled United States v.

SWISHER\n\n                              I\n\n    Defendant Elven Joe Swisher enlisted in the United States\nMarine Corps on August 4, 1954, a little over a year after the\nKorean War ended. In August 1957, he was honorably\ndischarged from the Marine Corps into the reserves. Upon\ndischarge, Swisher was given a DD-214 discharge document,\na typewritten form that provided his name, education, type of\ndischarge, last duty assignment, last date of service, and\nsimilar information regarding his military service. The form\nrequired a listing of Swisher’s “decorations, medals, badges,\ncommendations, citations and campaign ribbons awarded or\nauthorized.” In the authenticated copy of Swisher’s original\nDD-214, the term “N/A” (not applicable) is written in the\nfield.\n\n    In 2001, more than forty years after his discharge,\nSwisher filed a claim for service-related Post-Traumatic\nStress Disorder (PTSD). In his application, Swisher claimed\nhe suffered from PTSD as a result of his participation in a\nsecret combat mission in North Korea in August or\nSeptember 1955. Along with his application, Swisher\nprovided a self-published narrative that described the North\nKorea operation. According to the narrative, Swisher was\nwounded in battle, and subsequently presented with a Purple\nHeart by an unnamed captain who visited him in the hospital.\nThe same captain told him he was “entitled to and should\nwear the National Defense Medal, Korean War Service\nMedal and the Korean War U.N. Service Medal and\nRibbons.” Swisher claims he also received a Silver Star and\na Navy Commendation Medal and Ribbon with a Bronze\n“V.”\n\f                   UNITED STATES V. SWISHER                           7\n\n   After reviewing Swisher’s application for PTSD benefits\nand the accompanying narrative, the VA denied the claim\nbecause Swisher failed to provide corroborating evidence\nbeyond his own statement that his PTSD was service\nconnected.\n\n    Swisher appealed the denial and submitted a photocopy\nof a second DD-214, which included the typewritten\ncomment that “[t]his document replaces the previously issued\ntransfer document” and “[c]hanges and additions have been\nverified by Command.” The new form stated that Swisher\nhad received the Silver Star, Navy and Marine Corps Medal\nwith Gold Star, Purple Heart, and Navy and Marine Corps\nCommendation Medal with Bronze “V.” Based on this\ninformation, the VA reversed its previous decision in July\n2004, ruled that Swisher’s PTSD was a compensable\ndisability, and granted Swisher a total of $2,366 a month in\nbenefits.4\n\n    About a year later, the VA received information from the\nmilitary personnel division that the replacement DD-214 was\nfraudulent. In July 2006, after further investigation\nconfirmed that the DD-214 was forged, the VA reversed its\ndetermination that the PTSD was service connected and\nrequired Swisher to pay back the PTSD benefits that he had\nreceived.\n\n\n\n  4\n     Swisher’s claim that he was awarded a Purple Heart became a key\nissue in a criminal trial involving defendant David Hinkson, who was on\ntrial for solicitation of murder.

SWISHER\n\n    In July 2007, a grand jury indicted Swisher for four\nviolations of federal law: (1) wearing unauthorized military\nmedals in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 704(a); (2) making false\nstatements to the VA regarding his military service,\ndisabilities, and honors, in an effort to obtain benefits in\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001(a)(2); (3) forging or altering his\ncertificate of discharge, also in an effort to obtain benefits, in\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001(a)(3); and (4) theft of\ngovernment funds, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 641.\n\n    During the one-week trial, Lieutenant Colonel Elaine\nHensen, the assistant head for the Military Awards Branch at\nHeadquarters Marine Corps, discussed her review of the\nMarine Corps files and her determination that the files\ncontained no record of Swisher receiving or being awarded\nthe Purple Heart or any other medal or award. The\ngovernment also introduced Exhibit 67, a photograph\nshowing Swisher and another man in Marine Corps League\nuniforms.5 In the photograph, Swisher is wearing several\nmilitary medals and awards, and shaking hands with a person\nin civilian garb. The parties stipulated that the photograph\nwas authentic. Lt. Col. Henson testified that the photograph\nshowed Swisher wearing the Silver Star, Navy and Marine\nCorps Ribbon, Purple Heart, Navy and Marine Corps\nCommendation Medal with a Bronze “V,” and UMC\nExpeditionary Medal. She reiterated that there was nothing\n“in the United States Marine Corps’ files . . . to substantiate\nMr. Swisher’s entitlement to wear any of those awards.” In\naddition, Jeffrey Shattuck, the head of the Records\nCorrespondence Section for the Personnel Management\n\n\n    5\n    The Marine Corps League is a Congressionally chartered veterans\norganization that has its own Marine-related uniforms.

SWISHER\n\nthat “[b]ack in 1987, I was awarded the Congressional Medal\nof Honor.” 132 S. Ct. at 2542 (Kennedy, J., plurality\nopinion). The defendant challenged his conviction on the\nground that § 704(b) was invalid under the First Amendment.\nId. He won on appeal, and the government petitioned for\ncertiorari. Id.\n\n    Because § 704(b) criminalized specific statements based\non their falsity, the government did not dispute that the statute\nimposed a content-based restriction on speech. Rather, the\ngovernment argued that false statements had “no First\nAmendment value in themselves,” id. at 2543, and so were\nprotected “only to the extent needed to avoid chilling fully\nprotected speech,” id. The Supreme Court rejected the\ngovernment’s argument, and agreed that § 704(b) violated the\nFirst Amendment. Id. The Court could not, however, agree\non the appropriate level of scrutiny for the sort of lies targeted\nby § 704(b). Id. at 2548 (Kennedy, J., plurality opinion),\n2552 (Breyer, J., concurring).\n\n    Justice Kennedy, writing for four Justices, held that\n§ 704(b) was subject to the “most exacting scrutiny.” Id. at\n2548 (Kennedy, J., plurality opinion) (quoting Turner Broad.\nSys., Inc. v. FCC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117869\"><a href=\"/opinion/117869/turner-broadcasting-system-inc-v-fcc/\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">622</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 642 (1994)). In reaching this\nconclusion, the plurality rejected the government’s argument\nthat false statements had “no First Amendment value” and\nmerited protection “only to the extent needed to avoid\nchilling fully protected speech.” Id. at 2543. While\nconceding that “content-based restrictions on speech have\nbeen permitted” for certain historical categories of speech, id.\nat 2544, the plurality concluded that the “Government has not\ndemonstrated that false statements generally should constitute\na new category of unprotected speech.” Id. at 2547. Nor did\nthe plurality agree with the government’s argument that\n\f                UNITED STATES V. SWISHER                    13\n\n§ 704(b) was analogous to regulations on false speech “that\ncourts generally have found permissible,” such as laws\nprohibiting a false statement made to a Government official,\nlaws punishing perjury, and prohibitions on falsely claiming\nto speak on behalf of the government. Id. at 2545–46. These\nexamples, the plurality determined, were confined to\ncircumscribed contexts. Id. at 2546. Certain statutes\nprohibiting impersonation of a government official, for\ninstance, “protect the integrity of Government processes,\nquite apart from merely restricting false speech,” and may be\nlimited to “maintain[ing] the general good repute and dignity\nof . . . government . . . service itself.” Id. at 2546 (quoting\nUnited States v. Lepowitch, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103815\"><a href=\"/opinion/103815/united-states-v-lepowitch/\"><span class=\"volume\">318</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">702</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 704 (1943)\n(alterations in original)). The plurality concluded that these\ntypes of permissible speech regulations did not encompass the\n“sweeping, quite unprecedented reach” of § 704(b). Id. at\n2547.\n\n    Having concluded that false statements of the sort\nproscribed in § 704(b) constituted protected speech, the\nplurality subjected the statute to “exacting scrutiny,” which\nrequired that (1) the government have a compelling interest;\n(2) “the Government’s chosen restriction on the speech at\nissue be actually necessary to achieve its interest,” and\n(3) “[t]here must be a direct causal link between the\nrestriction imposed and the injury to be prevented.” Id. at\n2549 (internal quotation marks omitted). Applying this test\nto § 704(b), the plurality held that the statute served a\ncompelling government interest in protecting “the integrity of\nthe military honors system,” id. at 2548, but the statute’s\nrestriction was not “actually necessary” because the\ngovernment’s interest could be satisfied by counterspeech,\nincluding a “Government-created database [that] could list\nCongressional Medal of Honor winners.” Id. at 2549–51.\n\f14               UNITED STATES V. SWISHER\n\nFurther, the government had not shown “[t]he link between\nthe Government’s interest in protecting the integrity of the\nmilitary honors system and the Act’s restriction on the false\nclaims of liars,” because it failed to support “its claim that the\npublic’s general perception of military awards is diluted by\nfalse claims.” Id. at 2549. Accordingly, the plurality\nconcluded that § 704(b) violated the First Amendment. Id. at\n2551.\n\n    Justice Breyer concurred in the judgment on the ground\nthat § 704(b) “works disproportionate constitutional harm”\nunder his formulation of intermediate scrutiny. Id. at 2556\n(Breyer, J., concurring). In his concurrence, Justice Breyer\nstated that to determine whether a statute violates the First\nAmendment, the Court generally examines “the fit between\nstatutory ends and means.” Id. at 2551. In conducting a\nreview of a governmental enactment under this standard, a\ncourt must (1) take “account of the seriousness of the\nspeech-related harm the provision will likely cause”;\n(2) consider “the nature and importance of the provision’s\ncountervailing objectives,” and (3) weigh “the extent to\nwhich the provision will tend to achieve those objectives, and\nwhether there are other, less restrictive ways of doing so.” Id.\n\n    In applying this test to § 704(b), Justice Breyer first\nconsidered the “speech-related harm” caused by this\nenactment. Id. at 2551–52. Justice Breyer interpreted\n§ 704(b) as “criminalizing only false factual statements made\nwith knowledge of their falsity and with the intent that they\nbe taken as true.” Id. at 2552–53. He acknowledged that\nregulation of false statements “endangers First Amendment\nvalues” less than other restrictions, id. at 2553, and noted that\n“many statutes and common-law doctrines make the utterance\nof certain kinds of false statements unlawful,” id. at 2253–54.\n\f                UNITED STATES V. SWISHER                    15\n\nBut in Justice Breyer’s view, such statutes and doctrines work\nless speech-related harm because they typically “narrow the\nstatute to a subset of lies where specific harm is more likely\nto occur.” Id. at 2555. For instance, laws punishing fraud,\ndefamation, or intentional infliction of emotional distress\ngenerally “requir[e] proof of specific harm to identifiable\nvictims,” and statutes prohibiting the impersonation of a\npublic official “may require a showing that, for example,\nsomeone was deceived into following a ‘course [of action] he\nwould not have pursued but for the deceitful conduct.’” Id.\nat 2554 (alteration in original) (quoting Lepowitch, 318 U.S.\nat 704). Other similar laws specify “that the lies be made in\ncontexts in which a tangible harm to others is especially\nlikely to occur,” such as laws punishing perjury or lying to a\ngovernment official, or trademark statutes which are “focused\nupon commercial and promotional activities that are likely to\ndilute the value of a mark.” Id. Finally, statutes prohibiting\nfalse claims of terrorist attacks or other lies about crimes or\ncatastrophes, are limited to false statements that “are\nparticularly likely to produce harm,” and generally require\nproof of foreseeability of substantial public harm. Id.\n\n    According to Justice Breyer, § 704(b) lacked these\nnarrowing features because it was not limited to a subset of\nlies causing specific harm to identifiable victims, or to a\nspecific context where foreseeable harm to others is likely to\noccur. Id. at 2555–56. Because “[f]alse factual statements\ncan serve useful human objectives” in a variety of contexts\nand “the threat of criminal prosecution” could have a chilling\neffect and could encourage or permit selective prosecution for\npolitical ends, id. at 2553, Justice Breyer concluded that\n§ 704(b) “risks significant First Amendment harm,” id. at\n2555.\n\f16               UNITED STATES V. SWISHER\n\n    Having reached this conclusion, Justice Breyer then\nturned to consider “the nature and importance of the\nprovision’s countervailing objectives,” id. at 2551, and\nconcluded that § 704(b) has a “substantial countervailing\nobjective” because “[i]t seeks to protect the interests of those\nwho have sacrificed their health and life for their country,”\nand is aimed at avoiding dilution of “the country’s\nrecognition of that sacrifice in the form of military honors,”\nid. at 2555.\n\n    Finally, Justice Breyer turned to his third prong,\nconsideration of “the extent to which the provision will tend\nto achieve those objectives, and whether there are other, less\nrestrictive ways of doing so.” Id. at 2551. Here, Justice\nBreyer concluded that it was “possible substantially to\nachieve the Government’s objective in less burdensome\nways.” Id. at 2555. According to Justice Breyer, Congress\ncould enact a more limited statute that adopted some of the\nnarrowing strategies used in other statutes and common law\ndoctrines punishing false speech, such as (1) requiring a\nshowing that the false statements caused a specific harm,\n(2) requiring that the lies be made in a context “where such\nlies are most likely to cause harm,” or (3) focusing on the\nmore important military awards that Congress most values.\nId. at 2555–56. Such a more narrowly tailored statute could\nbe combined with “information-disseminating devices,” such\nas “an accurate, publicly available register of military awards,\neasily obtainable by political opponents.” Id. at 2556.\nBecause the government failed to explain why a more limited\nstatute along with a method for providing more accurate\ninformation would not “significantly reduce the threat of First\nAmendment harm while permitting the statute to achieve its\nimportant protective objective,” Justice Breyer concluded that\n“the statute as presently drafted works disproportionate\n\f                UNITED STATES V. SWISHER                    17\n\nconstitutional harm” and “so violates the First Amendment.”\nId.\n\n                              B\n\n    In analyzing the constitutionality of § 704(b), Alvarez did\nnot directly address the closely related section of the Stolen\nValor Act, § 704(a), which is before us here. We first had\noccasion to consider a constitutional challenge to that section\nin United States v. Perelman, decided two months after the\nSupreme Court issued its opinion in Alvarez. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">695</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">866</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n    Before considering the applicability of Alvarez, Perelman\nconsidered the defendant’s overbreadth challenge to § 704(a).\nPerelman rejected this argument by construing the statute\nnarrowly as criminalizing only the unauthorized wearing of\nmedals “when the wearer intends to deceive.” Id. at 870\n(emphasis omitted).\n\n    Perelman then considered whether § 704(a), as construed,\nwould survive First Amendment scrutiny. Although the\nAlvarez plurality had applied “exacting scrutiny” to § 704(b),\nPerelman did not use this analytic framework because\n§ 704(a) did not criminalize speech, but rather criminalized\n“the harmful conduct of wearing a medal without\nauthorization and with intent to deceive.” Id. at 871.\nPerelman reasoned that “[e]ven if we assume that the\nintentionally deceptive wearing of a medal contains an\nexpressive element—the false statement that ‘I received a\nmedal’—the distinction between pure speech and conduct\nthat has an expressive element separates this case from\nAlvarez.” Id. Because, in Perelman’s view, § 704(a)\ncriminalized conduct, it was more akin to the impersonation\nstatutes discussed in Alvarez, or statutes prohibiting “the\n\f18               UNITED STATES V.

Second, the\ngovernment’s interests were “unrelated to the suppression of\nfree expression” because the statute “does not prevent the\nexpression of any particular message or viewpoint.” Id. And\nthird, “the incidental restriction on alleged First Amendment\nfreedoms” was “no greater than is essential to the furtherance\nof that interest,” because, “even if § 704(a) is not the most\neffective mechanism, in at least some measure it promotes the\ngoals of maintaining the integrity of the military’s medals and\npreventing the fraudulent wearing of military medals.” Id. at\n872–73. Accordingly, Perelman rejected the defendant’s\nfacial First Amendment challenge to § 704(a). Id. at 873.\n\n                               IV\n\n    Perelman based its conclusion that § 704(a) did not\nviolate the First Amendment on two grounds. First,\nPerelman distinguished between written or spoken speech on\nthe one hand and expressive conduct on the other. Id. at 871.\nSecond, Perelman implicitly determined that expressive\nconduct is per se subject to scrutiny under the test set forth in\n\f                 UNITED STATES V. SWISHER                    19\n\nO’Brien. Id. at 872.

See Reed, 135 S. Ct. at 2226–27.\nReed explained that “[g]overnment regulation of speech is\ncontent based if a law applies to particular speech because of\nthe topic discussed or the idea or message expressed.” Id. at\n2227. If “a regulation of speech ‘on its face’ draws\ndistinctions based on the message a speaker conveys,” it is a\ncontent-based regulation. Id. Laws that are facially content-\nneutral, but “cannot be justified without reference to the\ncontent of the regulated speech, or that were adopted by the\ngovernment because of disagreement with the message [the\nspeech] conveys,” are also content-based and subject to\nscrutiny under a higher standard. Id. (alteration in original)\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Government\nregulations of symbolic speech frequently fall into this\nsecond category of content-based prohibitions. For instance,\nwhere a state prohibited burning the American flag because\nit might lead people to believe that the flag does not stand for\nthe positive concepts of “nationhood and national unity,” the\nCourt was quick to conclude that such “concerns blossom\nonly when a person’s treatment of the flag communicates\nsome message, and thus are related to the suppression of free\nexpression.” Johnson, 491 U.S. at 410 (internal quotation\n\f24               UNITED STATES V.

Such a content-based regulation is “outside\nof O’Brien’s test altogether.” Id.\n\n    Even if a challenged restriction is content-based, it is not\nnecessarily subject to strict scrutiny. Although “[c]ontent-\nbased regulations are presumptively invalid,” the Court “has\npermitted restrictions upon the content of speech in a few\nlimited areas, which are of such slight social value as a step\nto truth that any benefit that may be derived from them is\nclearly outweighed by the social interest in order and\nmorality.” R.A.V. v.

Both the plurality and concurring opinions in\nAlvarez recognized the existence of “historical” and\ntraditional categories of content-based restrictions that are not\nsubject to strict scrutiny under the First Amendment and\nwhich courts have generally found permissible. Alvarez,\n132 S. Ct. at 2544 (Kennedy, J., plurality opinion) (explaining\nthat content-based restrictions on speech have been permitted\nonly for a “few historic and traditional categories” of speech,\nincluding incitement, obscenity, defamation, speech integral\nto criminal conduct, so-called “fighting words,” child\npornography, fraud, true threats, and “speech presenting some\ngrave and imminent threat the government has the power to\nprevent”); id. at 2553–54 (Breyer, J., concurring) (internal\nquotation marks omitted) (referencing additional “statutes\nand common-law doctrines” that make “utterance of certain\nkinds of false statements unlawful,” including torts involving\nintentional infliction of emotional distress, lying to a\ngovernment official, false claims of terrorist attacks or other\nlies about the commission of crimes or catastrophes,\nimpersonation of an officer, and trademark infringement,\namong others).\n\f                 UNITED STATES V. SWISHER                     25\n\n                               B\n\n     Applying these principles to Swisher’s facial challenge to\n§ 704(a), we first ask whether this statute regulates speech.\nIt clearly does. According to the government, the purpose of\na military medal is to communicate “that the recipient has\nserved the military efforts of the United States with valor,\nexceptional duty, or achievement worthy of commendation.”\nThe value of a military medal lies not in the materials of\nwhich it is comprised, but in its message; it is “a primitive but\neffective way of communicating ideas,” Barnette, 319 U.S. at\n632. Wearing a medal, like wearing a black armband or\nburning an American flag, conveys a message “by conduct\nthat is intended to be communicative and that, in context,\nwould reasonably be understood by the viewer to be\ncommunicative,” Clark, 468 U.S. at 294. Specifically,\nwearing a medal communicates that the wearer was awarded\nthat medal and is entitled to the nation’s recognition and\ngratitude “for acts of heroism and sacrifice in military\nservice.” Alvarez, 132 S. Ct. at 2548 (Kennedy, J., plurality\nopinion) (internal quotation mark omitted). Wearing a medal\nwithout authorization, therefore, generally communicates the\nfalse message that the wearer is entitled to such recognition\nand gratitude. Because wearing a medal is symbolic speech,\nand § 704(a) precludes the unauthorized wearing of a medal,\nwe conclude that § 704(a) regulates speech.\n\n    We next determine whether § 704(a) is a content-based or\ncontent-neutral restriction of symbolic speech. See Johnson,\n491 U.S. at 403. As in Johnson, the purpose of § 704(a) is to\nstop a particular message: the misappropriation or distortion\nof the message of valor conveyed by a medal. See Alvarez,\n132 S. Ct. at 2549 (noting the government’s argument that the\npurpose of the Stolen Valor Act is to avoid diluting “the value\n\f26                  UNITED STATES V. SWISHER\n\nand meaning of military awards”). Because these “concerns\nblossom,” Johnson, 491 U.S. at 410, only when a person’s\nunauthorized wearing of a medal communicates a false\nmessage, we conclude that § 704(a) “suppresses expression\nout of concern for its likely communicative impact,”\nEichman, 496 U.S. at 317, and is a content-based restriction\non speech.\n\n    As such, the tests applicable to content-neutral regulations\n(the time, place, or manner test, and the O’Brien test) are not\napplicable here. Johnson, 491 U.S. at 410 (stating that a\ncontent-based regulation is “outside of O’Brien’s test\naltogether”). Instead, § 704(a) “must, like a law directed at\nspeech itself, be justified by the substantial showing of need\nthat the First Amendment requires,” Johnson, 491 U.S. at\n406. In light of this analysis, we conclude that Perelman\nerred in applying the test set forth in O’Brien, which applies\nonly to content-neutral enactments.8\n\n                                    C\n\n   Because § 704(a) is a content-based regulation of false\nsymbolic speech, it is closely analogous to § 704(b). Indeed,\n\n\n 8\n    United States v. Hamilton, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">699</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">356</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (4th Cir. 2012), engaged in a\nsimilar analysis, correctly noting that “the key factor that determines\nwhether we apply the ‘relatively lenient’ test employed in O’Brien, or the\n‘most exacting scrutiny’ standard set forth in Johnson, is whether the\nstatute being reviewed is related to the suppression of free expression.”\nId. at 370. The Fourth Circuit further acknowledged that when § 704(a)\nis construed as requiring an intent to deceive, it “could reach conduct that\nsolely involves free expression, within the holding of Johnson.” Id. at\n371. The Fourth Circuit ultimately did not determine whether § 704(a)\nwas symbolic speech because it concluded, erroneously in our view, that\n§ 704(a) survived strict scrutiny. See id.\n\f                   UNITED STATES V. SWISHER                          27\n\nboth statutes bar lies about having received a military medal.\nAccordingly, we review the constitutionality of § 704(a)\nunder the tests enunciated in the plurality and concurring\nopinions in Alvarez. If they apply to § 704(a) in the same\nmanner as they apply to § 704(b), the reasoning of Alvarez\nrequires us to hold that § 704(a) is also unconstitutional.\n\n    We begin by considering the standard set forth in Justice\nBreyer’s concurring opinion, which reviewed the\nconstitutionality of § 704(b) under a less demanding test than\nthe plurality required. As a threshold matter, Justice Breyer\ninterpreted § 704(b) favorably to the government as\nproscribing “only false factual statements made with\nknowledge of their falsity and with the intent that they be\ntaken as true.” Alvarez, 132 S. Ct. at 2552–53 (Breyer, J.,\nconcurring). We adopt the same narrowing construction of\n§ 704(a), and interpret it as proscribing unauthorized persons\nfrom wearing military medals for the purpose of falsely\ncommunicating that they have been awarded such medals.\nSee also Perelman, 695 F.3d at 871 (concluding that a person\nviolates § 704(a) only “if he or she has an intent to deceive”).\n\n    The first prong of Justice Breyer’s intermediate scrutiny\ntest requires consideration of “the seriousness of the\nspeech-related harm the provision will likely cause.” Alvarez,\n132 S. Ct. at 2551. Justice Breyer noted that the narrowing\ninterpretation of § 704(b) “diminishes the extent to which the\nstatute endangers First Amendment values.” Id. at 2553.\nBecause we have adopted the same narrowing interpretation\nfor § 704(a), the same conclusion applies.9\n\n\n 9\n   Because both § 704(a), see supra at 26–27, and § 704(b), see Alvarez,\n132 S. Ct. 2552–53, prohibit only lies made knowingly and with an intent\nto deceive, both provisions impose an identical speech-related harm:\n\f28                 UNITED STATES V. SWISHER\n\n    But like § 704(b), § 704(a) lacks the limiting features that,\nin Justice Breyer’s view, justified other statutes and common\nlaw doctrines punishing the communication of false\nstatements. Id. at 2553–54. Section 704(a) does not require\n“proof of specific harm to identifiable victims,” or that\n“someone was deceived into following a course [of action] he\nwould not have pursued but for the deceitful conduct,” or\nspecify “that the lies be made in contexts in which a tangible\nharm to others is especially likely to occur.” See id. at 2254\n(alteration in original) (internal citations and quotation marks\nomitted). Nor is § 704(a) limited to false statements that “are\nparticularly likely to produce harm.” See id. Accordingly,\nwe conclude that under Justice Breyer’s test, § 704(a), like\n§ 704(b), “creates a significant risk of First Amendment\nharm.” Id. at 2555.\n\n    Arguing against this conclusion, the government asserts\nthat § 704(a) is analogous to statutes prohibiting trademark\ninfringement such as the Lanham Act, since it prevents\nmisappropriation of governmental property. Justice Breyer\nrejected a similar argument, concluding that § 704(b) had a\nbroader reach than trademark statutes, which are typically\n“focused upon commercial and promotional activities that are\nlikely to dilute the value of a mark,” and would “typically\nrequire a showing of likely confusion, a showing that tends to\nassure that the feared harm will in fact take place.” Id. at\n\n\nburdening the speech of a person who intentionally chooses to lie, see\nAlvarez, 132 S. Ct. at 2555–56. And in prosecuting either statute, the\ngovernment would be required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that\nthe defendant had the requisite mens rea. Therefore, we reject the\ndissent’s argument that § 704(b) would have a greater chilling effect and\npose a greater risk of selective prosecution than § 704(a) because a person\ncould thoughtlessly lie but could not thoughtlessly wear an unauthorized\nmedal. Dis. op. at 41.\n\f                UNITED STATES V. SWISHER                  29\n\n2554. Because § 704(a) has the same broad reach as\n§ 704(b), and likewise does not require that a specified harm\n(such as public confusion) will take place, the same analysis\napplies here, and we likewise reject the government’s\ncontention.\n\n    In reaching the conclusion that suppressing a symbolic\ncommunication threatens the same First Amendment harm as\nsuppressing a spoken communication, we again part ways\nwith Perelman. Although Perelman distinguished § 704(a)\nfrom § 704(b) on the ground that “[t]he use of a physical\nobject goes beyond mere speech and suggests that the wearer\nhas proof of the lie, or government endorsement of it,”\n695 F.3d at 871, we see no basis for Perelman’s conclusion\nthat wearing a medal is more probative than speaking a lie.\nCf. Kevin Jon Heller, The Cognitive Psychology of\nCircumstantial Evidence, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">L</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Rev. 241, 248–52\n(2006) (noting, as an empirical matter, that jurors give more\nweight to testimony, such as eyewitness identifications and\nconfessions, than to physical evidence, such as blood and\nfingerprints). As a practical matter, the government’s\nconcession at oral argument that military medals are freely\navailable for purchase confirms that the probative value of\nowning a medal or other military decoration is minimal. In\nany event, wearing a medal has no purpose other than to\ncommunicate a message. We therefore see no principled\nbasis for distinguishing a spoken communication from a\nsymbolic communication in this context.\n\n    We also reject Perelman’s reasoning that § 704(a) is like\nthe statutes described in Alvarez that prohibit impersonation\nof government officials, like 18 U.S.C. § 912, or the\nunauthorized wearing of military uniforms, like 18 U.S.C.\n§ 702, which the Court assumed (without deciding) was valid.\n\f30              UNITED STATES V. SWISHER\n\nSee 695 F.3d at 872 (citing Schacht, 398 U.S. at 61). As\nJustice Breyer pointed out, “[s]tatutes forbidding\nimpersonation of a public official typically focus on acts of\nimpersonation, not mere speech, and may require a showing\nthat, for example, someone was deceived into following a\ncourse [of action] he would not have pursued but for the\ndeceitful conduct.” Alvarez, 132 S. Ct. at 2554 (Breyer, J.,\nconcurring) (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). But § 704(a), like § 704(b), requires no act beyond\nthe false communication itself. While there is a quantum of\nconduct involved in pinning on a medal, it is not materially\ndifferent from the quantum of conduct involved in speaking\nor writing. Nor does § 704(a) require proof that anyone was\ndeceived into taking a course of action. We also reject\nPerelman’s reliance on Schacht to support its conclusion that\n§ 704(a) survives First Amendment scrutiny. Schacht itself\nmerely held that even if the government could constitutionally\nprohibit a person from wearing a military uniform without\nauthorization, Congress may not make “it a crime for an actor\nwearing a military uniform to say things during his\nperformance critical of the conduct or policies of the Armed\nForces.” 398 U.S. at 62–63; see also R.A.V., 505 U.S. at\n430–31 (interpreting Schacht as precluding viewpoint\ndiscrimination). Neither Schacht nor any other Supreme\nCourt case examined a First Amendment challenge to statutes\nprecluding wearing military uniforms without authorization,\nand both the Alvarez plurality and concurring opinion\nindicated that laws prohibiting impersonation of an officer are\ndistinguishable from false claims of entitlement to a military\n\f                    UNITED STATES V.

Ct. at 2546 (Kennedy, J., plurality\nopinion); id. at 2254 (Breyer, J., concurring).10\n\n    The second prong of Justice Breyer’s intermediate\nscrutiny test requires an evaluation of “the nature and\nimportance of the provision’s countervailing objectives.” Id.\nat 2551. We conclude that the government had the same\ncompelling interest in enacting § 704(a) as it did in enacting\n§ 704(b): in both cases, the government has a “substantial\ncountervailing objective” of avoiding dilution of “the\ncountry’s recognition of [award recipients’] sacrifice in the\nform of military honors.” Id. at 2555; see also Hamilton,\n699 F.3d at 371 (“Accordingly, we hold that the\ngovernment’s interest in preserving the integrity of the\nsystem honoring military members for their achievements and\nsacrifices is compelling.”).11\n\n    Finally, we consider the third prong of Justice Breyer’s\ntest: “the extent to which the provision will tend to achieve\nthose objectives, and whether there are other, less restrictive\nways of doing so.” Alvarez, 132 S. Ct. at 2551. As explained\nin Alvarez, Congress could adopt narrowing strategies to limit\n\n  10\n     Contrary to the dissent, our analysis does not necessarily invalidate\n18 U.S.C. § 709. Cf. Dis. op at 37–38. Because § 709 is limited to\nprecluding false representations in certain limited contexts (such as in the\nfield of banking, finance, or law enforcement) where “a tangible harm to\nothers is especially likely to occur,” Alvarez, 132 S. Ct. at 2554 (Breyer,\nJ., plurality opinion), it is distinguishable from § 704(a).\n  11\n    We are sympathetic to the dissent’s description of the government’s\npowerful interest in protecting the message of valor and heroism that is\nconveyed by a medal. Dis. op. at 43–46. But because we already\nconclude that the government’s interest in preventing the wearing of\nunauthorized medals is compelling, the dissent’s further elaboration does\nnot affect our First Amendment analysis.\n\f32                 UNITED STATES V. SWISHER\n\nthe breadth of the prohibition, and could establish\n“information-disseminating devices,” such as “an accurate,\npublicly available register of military awards, easily\nobtainable by political opponents.” Id. at 2556. These\nalternative means to meeting the government’s goals in\nenacting § 704(b) would be equally effective to meet the\ngovernment’s stated goals for § 704(a), namely to preserve\nthe integrity of the military honors system and protect the\nsymbolic value of military medals.12\n\n    Given that the statute fails Justice Breyer’s intermediate\nscrutiny test, it also fails under the plurality’s exacting\nscrutiny test. See id. at 2543 (Kennedy, J., plurality\nopinion).13 The plurality’s conclusion that the compelling\ninterest served by § 704(b) could be satisfied by a database of\nmedal winners, and that there is an insufficient causal link\nbetween the government’s compelling interest and the\nrestriction “on the false claims of liars,” is equally applicable\nto § 704(a). See id. at 2549–50.\n\n\n\n\n  12\n    The dissent’s arguments to the contrary, see Dis. op. at 47–48, are\nbased on its view that symbolic speech involving a physical emblem is\nqualitatively different than spoken or written speech, a position\ninconsistent with Johnson. 491 U.S. at 403–04. For the same reason, we\ndisagree with Hamilton’s conclusion that § 704(a) survives strict scrutiny\nbecause a database is inadequate to counter symbolic speech involving a\nphysical object. 699 F.3d at 373.\n  13\n    Although Alvarez lacked a majority opinion, we need not determine\nwhether the plurality opinion or Justice Breyer’s opinion constitutes the\nholding of the Court, see Marks v.

Ct. at 2546–47 (Kennedy, J., plurality opinion); id. at\n2553 (Breyer, J., concurring). Given that clarification, our\nanalysis follows a familiar road. Content-based prohibitions\nof speech and symbolic speech are analyzed under the same\nframework, and so Alvarez dictates our conclusion that\n§ 704(a) violates the First Amendment. Because § 704(a)\nwas unconstitutionally applied to Swisher’s conduct, the\ndistrict court erred in denying Swisher relief under 28 U.S.C.\n§ 2255. We therefore reverse the district court and overrule\nPerelman to the extent inconsistent with this opinion.14\n\n       REVERSED.\n\n\n\n\n  14\n     The government also argues that § 704(a) is not subject to the First\nAmendment because military medals convey government speech. In\nsupport, the government relies on Walker v. Texas Division, Sons of\nConfederate Veterans, Inc., which held that Texas could reject a proposed\ndesign for specialty license plates without violating the First Amendment\nbecause license plate designs constitute government speech. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2809762\"><a href=\"/opinion/2809762/walker-v-texas-div-sons-of-confederate-veterans-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

When the United States\nprosecuted Alvarez for “falsely represent[ing] himself . . .\nverbally” as having received a military decoration or medal,\n18 U.S.C. § 704(b) (2011 ed.), the Supreme Court held that\nhis speech was protected by the First Amendment.

Elven Swisher took Alvarez one step better: he\nnot only said he was a decorated soldier, he proved it by\nwearing his Marine Corps League uniform with five\nmedals—including a Silver Star, a Purple Heart, and the\nNavy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal with a bronze\n“V.” Like Alvarez, Swisher was an undeserving claimant;\nalthough a veteran, he had not earned a single one of the\ncommendations he wore. As in Alvarez, the United States\nindicted Swisher under the Stolen Valor Act, but this time it\naccused him of violating § 704(a), which prohibits\n“knowingly wear[ing] . . . any decoration or medal authorized\nby Congress . . . except when authorized.” 18 U.S.C.\n§ 704(a) (2002 ed.).\n\n    The majority today holds that Swisher’s conduct is a form\nof speech entitled to the same protection as Alvarez’s actual\nspeech. I beg to differ. The Supreme Court’s decision in\nAlvarez does not compel the result here. The law has always\nbeen able to tell the difference between conduct and speech,\neven when the conduct may have some communicative value.\nI respectfully dissent.\n\f                 UNITED STATES V. SWISHER                    35\n\n                               I\n\n    Alvarez held that false statements are not categorically\nunprotected by the First Amendment. Alvarez, 132 S. Ct. at\n2545–47 (Kennedy, J.) (plurality opinion); id. at 2552–53\n(Breyer, J., concurring in the judgment). As Justice Breyer\nexplained, the government can have little interest in policing\nthe “white lies” we tell to “provide the sick with comfort, or\npreserve a child’s innocence,” or false statements made “in\ntechnical, philosophical, and scientific contexts, where . . .\nexamination of a false statement . . . can promote a form of\nthought that ultimately helps realize the truth.” Id. at 2553\n(Breyer, J., concurring in the judgment). But the Court\nstopped well short of protecting lying generally. As Justice\nKennedy reminded us, “there are instances in which the\nfalsity of speech bears upon whether it is protected.” Id. at\n2546 (plurality opinion).\n\n     The statute at issue here, however, does not police “white\nlies,” nor does it prohibit lying generally. Instead, it targets\na very specific lie that implicates a very specific government\ninterest, an interest which the full court here and the Supreme\nCourt in Alvarez agrees is significant. And importantly, the\nlie the government wishes to punish cannot be uttered with\nwords; it can only be accomplished by falsely wearing the\nnation’s medals. Although the Court in Alvarez found that\nthe harm caused by the form of the lie regulated by § 704(b)\ndid not outweigh the First Amendment harm, the interests\nimplicated by § 704(a) must be weighed differently from\nthose at issue in Alvarez under § 704(b). The harm to the\ngovernment’s interest in upholding the military honors\nsystem caused by the false wearing of its medals is greater\nthan the harm caused by “bar stool braggadocio.” Alvarez,\n132 S. Ct. at 2555 (Breyer, J., concurring in the judgment).\n\f36                   UNITED STATES V. SWISHER\n\nConcomitantly, because § 704(a) requires proof of deceptive\nconduct, any harm to First Amendment interests is less than\nin Alvarez, and the less restrictive alternatives discussed in\nAlvarez, less effective.\n\n    The majority today ignores these distinctions, and\ndiscusses the outcome of this case as though Alvarez renders\nit a foregone conclusion. But it is not. Alvarez does not\nclearly compel the result here—indeed, that was the\nconclusion reached by a panel of our court in United States v.\nPerelman, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">695</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">866</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 872–73 (9th Cir. 2012), in which we\nupheld § 704(a) under the lesser scrutiny applied to conduct\nregulations laid out in O’Brien.1 It was also the conclusion\nreached by the Fourth Circuit, which found that § 704(a)\nwould survive strict scrutiny.

While I do not entirely\nagree with the reasoning in these cases, they demonstrate that\nthe reach—and indeed the holding—of Alvarez is unclear.\nAlvarez gives uncertain guidance as to how false statements\nshould be analyzed, especially if Justice Breyer’s opinion\ncontrols under Marks v.

In dissent, Justice Alito, joined by two\nothers, would have held that Alvarez’s false statement “merit[ed] no First\nAmendment protection.” Id. at 2563 (Alito, J., dissenting). Justice\nBreyer’s opinion is the narrowest opinion that a majority of the Court\nagreed upon. Marks, 430 U.S. at 193.\n\f                   UNITED STATES V. SWISHER                          37\n\n    Part of the analytical challenge of Alvarez is trying to\nunderstand why intermediate scrutiny applies. In Perelman,\nthe panel used the O’Brien test. 695 F.3d at 872. I can’t\nagree with the Perelman panel on that point because § 704(a)\nseems to violate at least one prong of O’Brien: The\nGovernment’s interest in § 704(a) is not “unrelated to the\nsuppression of free expression.” O’Brien, 391 U.S. at 377;\nsee also Texas v. Johnson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112304\"><a href=\"/opinion/112304/texas-v-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">491</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">397</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 410 (1989). For that\nreason, the Fourth Circuit did not apply O’Brien, but\nultimately concluded the statute would survive strict scrutiny.\nHamilton, 699 F.3d at 371. The anomaly is, as Judge Davis\npointed out, that § 704(a) survives strict scrutiny, but would\nfail O’Brien’s version of intermediate scrutiny. Id. at 377\n(Davis, J., concurring).3\n\n    Despite this ambiguity, the majority goes out of its way\nto extend Alvarez where it does not clearly apply. Moreover,\nthe majority fails to consider the consequences of our\ndecision. In addition to creating an unnecessary split with the\nFourth Circuit over a statute that is no longer in effect,4\n\n\n 3\n   In my view, § 704(a) should be reviewed under intermediate scrutiny\nand treated as an “impersonation of a war hero” statute. See Alvarez,\n132 S. Ct. at 2554 (Breyer, J., concurring in the judgment) (noting that\n§ 704(b) differs from anti-impersonation statutes because they typically\nprohibit “acts of impersonation, not mere speech” ); see also id. at\n2553–55 (discussing examples of the “many statutes and common-law\ndoctrines [that] make the utterance of certain kinds of false statements\nunlawful”). Unlike § 704(b), we deal here with something more than\n“mere speech.”\n     4\n    Both provisions of the Stolen Valor Act were amended following\nAlvarez, subsequent to the events that gave rise to Swisher’s case.\nCongress removed the “wearing” provision in § 704(a), apparently\npreemptively, and more substantively revised § 704(b) to comply with the\nCourt’s holding in Alvarez. See Stolen Valor Act of 2013, Pub. L. No.\n\f38                  UNITED STATES V. SWISHER\n\ntoday’s decision calls into question the validity of numerous\nother statutes that prohibit, for example: the unauthorized\nwearing of a military uniform, 18 U.S.C. § 702—which the\nSupreme Court has noted is “a valid statute on its face,”\nSchacht v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108149\"><a href=\"/opinion/108149/schacht-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">398</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">58</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 61 (1970); the\nunauthorized use of the name of federal agencies, 18 U.S.C.\n§ 709; or the impersonation of a federal officer, 18 U.S.C.\n§ 912—a statute we upheld in United States v. Tomsha-\nMiguel, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">766</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1041</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1048–49 (9th Cir. 2014), a case in\nwhich we relied on Perelman (which we now overturn).5 In\nlight of this, I see no reason to extend Alvarez to § 704(a), in\norder to protect deceptive conduct that has no First\nAmendment value, and which poses greater harm to the\ngovernment’s significant interest in upholding the military\nhonors system than did the speech covered by § 704(b).\n\n\n\n\n113-12, § 2, 127 Stat. 448 (2013). Thus, the precise provisions at issue\nhere are no longer in effect. As amended, however, the statute would still\nappear to cover Swisher’s conduct. Section 704(b) now reads: “Whoever,\nwith intent to obtain money, property, or other tangible benefit,\nfraudulently holds oneself out to be a recipient of a decoration or medal\n. . . shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than one year, or\nboth.” 127 Stat. 448.\n 5\n    Consider also: 18 U.S.C. § 703 (unauthorized wearing of a uniform of\na friendly nation); § 706 (wearing of Red Cross with the fraudulent\npurpose of inducing the belief that wearer is a member or agent of the Red\nCross); and § 706a (wearing of Geneva distinctive emblem (Red Crescent\nor Red Crystal) with fraudulent purpose of inducing the belief that wearer\nis a member or agent of an authorized national society using the emblem,\nthe International Committee of the Red Cross, or the International\nFederation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies).\n\f                 UNITED STATES V. SWISHER                     39\n\n                               II\n\n    The majority concludes that the Supreme Court’s decision\nin Alvarez dictates the outcome of this case, identifying three\nfactors from Justice Breyer’s concurring opinion in Alvarez,\nand mechanically applying them to the statute at issue here.\nMaj. Op. at 26–32. For the reasons I have explained, I agree\nwith the majority that Justice Breyer’s analysis controls and\nthat the relevant factors are: (1) “the seriousness of the\nspeech-related harm the provision will likely cause”; (2) “the\nnature and importance of the provision’s countervailing\nobjectives”; and (3) “the extent to which the provision will\ntend to achieve those objectives, and whether there are other,\nless restrictive ways of doing so.” Alvarez, 132 S. Ct. at\n2551. Yet in applying these factors, the majority fails to\naccount for the crucial differences between § 704(b) and\n§ 704(a)—and indeed, fails to engage in much critical\nanalysis at all. I am going to address each of the factors in\nturn.\n\n                               A\n\n    In analyzing the speech-related harm caused by § 704(a),\nthe majority concludes that § 704(a) works the same speech-\nrelated harm as § 704(b) because it “lacks the limiting\nfeatures that, in Justice Breyer’s view, justified other statutes\nand common law doctrines punishing the communication of\nfalse statements.” Maj. Op. at 28. I have two points. First,\nI part ways with the majority’s premise that speech and\ncommunicative conduct are the same for First Amendment\npurposes. In O’Brien, the Supreme Court rejected “the view\nthat an apparently limitless variety of conduct can be labeled\n‘speech’ whenever the person engaged in the conduct intends\nthereby to express an idea.” 391 U.S. at 376. Here, the\n\f40                  UNITED STATES V. SWISHER\n\nmajority doesn’t just blur the lines between conduct and\nspeech, it simply erases them: It finds that the “quantum of\nconduct involved in pinning on a medal . . . is not materially\ndifferent from the quantum of conduct involved in speaking\nor writing.” Maj. Op. at 30. With all respect, that just isn’t\ntrue. If it were, then we could save ourselves trouble and\nmoney by simply announcing that we are awarding medals\nwithout actually giving the recipients anything. But as\nanyone knows who has witnessed the President awarding the\nCongressional Medal of Honor or a promotion ceremony\npinning a new officer—or even an Olympic medals ceremony\nor a Cub Scout court of honor—there is value, both symbolic\nand tactile, in the awarding of a physical emblem. If there is\nimportant value in the act of awarding a physical medal, there\nis important value in the wearing of it.6\n\n\n\n\n  6\n    The majority notes, twice, that distinguishing between pure speech,\nlike false statements, and “symbolic speech” conveyed through conduct,\nlike the unauthorized wearing of a military medal, is inconsistent with\nTexas v. Johnson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112304\"><a href=\"/opinion/112304/texas-v-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">491</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">397</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1989). Maj. Op. at 20–21 n.6, 32 n.12.\nThis reference to Johnson is puzzling. Johnson is relevant only if we must\nanalyze this statute under strict scrutiny as a content-based restriction on\nspeech. See Johnson, 491 U.S. at 411–12 (applying strict scrutiny to a\nstatute prohibiting the burning of the American flag). But Justice Breyer’s\nconcurrence in Alvarez, on which the majority bases its entire analysis,\nclearly departs from this traditional First Amendment framework,\nanalyzing restrictions on false speech under an intermediate scrutiny,\nbalancing-of-interests approach Justice Breyer refers to as\n“proportionality.” Alvarez, 132 S. Ct. at 2551–52 (Breyer, J., concurring\nin the judgment). Moreover, as I have already noted, in analyzing false\nspeech, Justice Breyer specifically distinguishes between “mere speech”\nand “acts of impersonation where an act of impersonation is more likely\nto cause harm. Id. at 2554 (emphasis in original). Johnson is irrelevant\nhere.\n\f                    UNITED STATES V. SWISHER                            41\n\n    Second, even if there isn’t a relevant difference in content\nbetween the lie represented by saying one has a medal and the\ndeceit communicated by actually wearing it, the majority\nnever grapples with the speech-related harms that Justice\nBreyer focused on in striking down § 704(b), and therefore\nfails to consider whether there is any difference between the\ntwo situations that alters the need for the “limiting features”\ndiscussed in Alvarez. For example, Justice Breyer was\nparticularly concerned with the potential chilling effect of\n§ 704(b), because individuals would worry about “being\nprosecuted for a careless false statement” even if they lacked\nthe requisite mens rea, and so would curtail their own speech.\nAlvarez, 132 S. Ct. at 2555. It makes little sense, however, to\nextend this principle—that people sometimes thoughtlessly\nsay things that they don’t really mean—to the context of\n§ 704(a). Here, by contrast, it seems unlikely that an\nindividual could carelessly or negligently wear a military\nmedal with the intent to deceive. Thus, there is less danger\nhere that individuals will self-censor their sartorial choices\nfor fear of being prosecuted for negligent speech.7\n\n    There is also much less ambiguity in the wearing of a\nmilitary medal, and that diminishes the risk of selective\nprosecution under this provision. Id. at 2555 Breyer, J.,\nconcurring in the judgment) (noting the risk that § 704(b)\n\n\n   7\n     For reasons the panel explained in Perelman, because we must read\n§ 704(a) to prohibit only the wearing of a medal with the intent to deceive,\nthe statute does not apply to anyone wearing a medal in a theatrical\nproduction, as part of a Halloween costume, or in protest as a political\nstatement. 695 F.3d at 870 (listing these and other examples). In these\nsituations, we will readily recognize that the wearer is making no claim to\nbeing a medal recipient. The only person who can be prosecuted under\n§ 704(a) is one who is lying and wants us to rely on his possession of the\nmedal as proof of his valor. There is no First Amendment value in that lie.\n\f42                 UNITED STATES V. SWISHER\n\nmay be applied “subtly but selectively to speakers that the\nGovernment does not like,” particularly in the political\narena). Human speech is often ambiguous and subject to\ndifferent interpretations. As a result, speech subject to\n§ 704(b) must be understood in context, and thus is more\neasily subject to manipulation and “the risk of censorious\nselectivity by prosecutors.” Id. As judges, we are familiar\nwith the dangers of reading a cold record and trying to supply\nvoice inflection, facial expression, and body language.8 For\ngood reason, we defer to the fact-finders who have actually\nseen the witnesses to judge their demeanor as a measure of\ntheir truthfulness.

SWISHER                   43\n\n    By contrast, wearing clothing, particularly with the\nprecision demanded when one dons a military uniform, is far\nless ambiguous than the vagaries of human speech. The very\nnature of a uniform suggests that once we recognize the\ndistinctive colors and insignia, we know immediately whether\nwe are dealing with the local constabulary or a member of the\nnation’s armed forces, whether the service member is wearing\nthe camouflage of the ground forces or the crisp whites of the\nnavy, whether the service member belongs to the armored\ndivision or the medical corps, and whether the member is\ncommissioned or non-commissioned. In the same vein, we\ncan discern, without any words being exchanged, the\ncampaigns in which the member has participated and whether\nthe member has been decorated for actions in combat.\nIndeed, so clear is our understanding of the meaning of the\nuniform that no voice inflection or body language can\ncountermand what we have seen for ourselves. Elven\nSwisher didn’t have to tell anyone that his Purple Heart meant\nthat he had been wounded in battle, or that his Navy and\nMarine Corps Commendation Medal was awarded for valor.\n\n    Contrary to the majority’s assertion that there is no\nprincipled distinction between § 704(a) and § 704(b), Maj.\nOp. at 29, § 704(a) engenders less potential constitutional\nharm than § 704(b), because there is less risk to the First\nAmendment in the government identifying and policing\nspecific instances of deceptive conduct than in trying to\npolice the line between false and true statements.\n\n                              B\n\n    The false wearing of military medals poses significantly\ngreater harm to the government’s interests than does mere\nfalse speech. That means that, contrary to the majority’s\n\f44               UNITED STATES V. SWISHER\n\nassertion, Maj. Op. at 31, the government’s objectives here\nare not precisely the same as those at issue under § 704(b).\nThe United States has a powerful interest in protecting the\nintegrity of its military decorations. Indeed, Congress has\npunished the wearing, manufacture, or sale of military\ndecorations without authorization since 1923. See Act of\nFeb. 24, 1923, ch. 110, 42 Stat. 1286. The wearing of an\nunearned military medal dilutes the message conveyed by the\nmedal itself. Even if the wearer is later exposed as a liar, the\nutility of the medal as a symbol of government\ncommendation has been undermined. The public can no\nlonger trust that the medal actually is a symbol of government\ncommendation, i.e., that the person wearing the medal has\nactually earned it. This results in a different, more concrete\nharm than that which may arise from the false statement that\none has earned a military medal. It is one thing to say that\none has been decorated; it is quite another to produce the\nevidence for it by appropriating a symbol that the\ngovernment, through decades of effort, has imbued with a\nparticular message. Unlike false statements, which may work\nharm by giving the public the general impression that more\npersonnel earn military honors than actually do, the false\nwearing of medals directly undermines the government’s\nability to mark out specific worthy individuals, because the\nsymbol the government uses to convey this message can no\nlonger be trusted. This may also mean that those who\nrightfully wear a military medal are less likely to be believed.\n\n    In this respect, a military medal is akin to a trademark: a\nsymbol that denotes a particular level of quality, or\nworthiness. See Alvarez, 132 S. Ct. at 2554 (Breyer, J.,\nconcurring in the judgment) (“Statutes prohibiting trademark\ninfringement present, perhaps, the closest analogy to the\npresent statute.”). As Justice Breyer recognized in Alvarez,\n\f                UNITED STATES V. SWISHER                    45\n\na false claim regarding a military medal “creates confusion\nabout who is entitled to wear it, thus diluting its value to\nthose who have earned it, to their families, and to their\ncountry.” Id. Although in Alvarez, Justice Breyer ultimately\nconcluded that the confusion caused by false statements was\nnot sufficient to outweigh the constitutional harm caused by\nthe statute, here, the calculus is different, because § 704(a)\ncreates less risk of constitutional harm, and because the\nwearing of an unearned medal offers more convincing proof\nof the lie than a mere false statement.\n\n    The false and deceptive wearing of military medals\n“dilutes the value” of military honors generally, by conveying\nthe impression that “everyone” earns them. Moreover, such\nconduct also dilutes the symbolic value of the medal itself,\nhampering the government’s ability to reward those it has\nconcluded are worthy of recognition. The purpose of a\nmilitary medal is not only that it conveys the government’s\nappreciation for an individual’s service to the individual, but\nthat it conveys the government’s commendation of that\nindividual to others, identifying the medal winner “as an\nexample worthy of emulation.” United States v. Alvarez,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"173484\"><a href=\"/opinion/173484/united-states-v-alvarez/\"><span class=\"volume\">617</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1198</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1234 (9th Cir. 2010) (Bybee, J., dissenting).\nThe value of the military medal, like the value of a trademark,\nis that it is both recognizable and publicly understood to\nconvey a specific message: in this case, the message that the\nwearer has done something worthy of admiration. When\nthose who are unworthy are allowed to wear the medal, the\ngovernment can no longer identify its heroes in a way that is\neasily discernible by the public.\n\n   To be clear, this harm does not occur when an unearned\nmedal is worn for purposes of art, theater, political\nexpression, or the like. It is only when the medal-wearer\n\f46                  UNITED STATES V. SWISHER\n\nwears the medal in order to appropriate the message\nconveyed by the medal—that the wearer has actually earned\na military honor—that the medal’s symbolic value is diluted.\nElven Swisher, however, was not wearing his false military\nmedals for purposes of art, political expression, intellectual\ndebate, or even any of the “innocent” reasons people may lie.\nHe wore his medals to support the elaborate story he had\nconcocted to fraudulently obtain disability benefits from the\ngovernment. He even wore his fraudulent medals to\nembellish his credibility when testifying at a criminal trial\n(not his own). See United States v. Hinkson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1191667\"><a href=\"/opinion/1191667/united-states-v-hinkson/\"><span class=\"volume\">585</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1247</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(9th Cir. 2009) (en banc), as amended, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"150617\"><a href=\"/opinion/150617/united-states-v-hinkson/\"><span class=\"volume\">611</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1098</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th\nCir. 2010).9 It is absurd to argue that allowing someone like\nSwisher to wear unearned military honors in the course of\nimpersonating a war hero does not do significant damage to\nthe value of the genuine honor bestowed on those who have\nsacrificed for their country.\n\n\n\n  9\n    Swisher testified as a government witness in a federal murder-for-hire\ncase, appearing on the witness stand with a Purple Heart pinned to his\nlapel. Hinkson, 585 F.3d at 1254. Swisher testified that the defendant in\nthat case, David Hinkson, had heard about his impressive military service\nrecord and had wanted to hire him to torture and kill a federal judge, an\nAUSA, and an IRS agent. During the course of the trial, Hinkson’s\nlawyers called Swisher’s credibility into serious question, on the basis that\nhis “reissued” military discharge papers, which detailed the military\nhonors Swisher had supposedly won, could not be authenticated. See id.\nat 1251–57 (recapping the Hinkson trial and Swisher’s role); see also\nUnited States v. Hinkson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"150617\"><a href=\"/opinion/150617/united-states-v-hinkson/\"><span class=\"volume\">611</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1098</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 2010) (en banc)\n(amending the original en banc opinion); id. at 1099 (W. Fletcher, J.,\ndissenting) (discussing in even more detail Swisher’s relationship with\nHinkson and the Hinkson trial). The parties here agreed that Swisher’s\nconduct at the Hinkson trial would not be introduced at his own trial.\nSwisher was indicted based on a photograph showing that he had worn his\nfalse medals to a Marine Corps League event.\n\f                 UNITED STATES V. SWISHER                    47\n\n                               C\n\n    Finally, there are fewer less restrictive regulatory\nalternatives available to the government where the\nunauthorized and deceptive wearing of a military medal is\nconcerned. To be sure, the statutory provision at issue here\npunishes the same kind of lie at issue in Alvarez. But the fact\nthat the lie here is told in a more effective way, with physical\nproof in the form of the medal to support the false claim of\nentitlement, increases the harm caused by the lie and also\nmeans that other, less restrictive means are less likely to be\neffective. Justice Breyer noted that many statutes punishing\nfalse statements require some showing of actual or likely\nharm resulting from the lie and suggested that “a more finely\ntailored statue might . . . insist upon a showing that the false\nstatement caused specific harm or at least was material, or\nfocus its coverage on lies most likely to be harmful or on\ncontexts where such lies are most likely to cause harm.”\nAlvarez, 132 S. Ct. at 2556 (Breyer, J., concurring in the\njudgment).       Section 704(a) satisfies Justice Breyer’s\nconcerns. First, the harm caused by the false wearing of\nmilitary medals is material. It is material to the message\nconveyed by the medals themselves. When pretenders wear\nmedals, the medal itself can no longer be taken as a sign that\nthe wearer has earned it and is therefore worthy of\ncommendation. Second, § 704(a) is confined to a single\ncontext—the intentional wearing of medals when the wearer\nintends to deceive—where it is most likely to cause harm.\n\n    Moreover, “counterspeech” will be less effective in\ncorrecting the falsehood conveyed by deceptively wearing an\nunearned military decoration. See Alvarez, 132 S. Ct. at\n2549–50 (Kennedy, J.) (plurality opinion); id. at 2556\n(Breyer, J., concurring in the judgment). One could denounce\n\f48                 UNITED STATES V. SWISHER\n\nSwisher as an impostor, but as the Fourth Circuit explained,\n“speech may not effectively counter that which a person\nsees.” Hamilton, 699 F.3d at 373. One could, perhaps,\nengage in a war of words with Alvarez, but Swisher, who has\nthe medals on his uniform, occupies the high ground.\n\n    Finally, the majority, following Alvarez, 132 S. Ct. at\n2550–51 (Kennedy, J.) (plurality opinion); id. at 2556\n(Breyer, J., concurring in the judgment), proposes a database\nof medal winners as a means to counteract Swisher’s\ndeception.10 Maj. Op. at 31–32. To my mind, this is no\nsolution at all to the problem of individuals falsely wearing\nmedals. If the public has to check the database to confirm\nthat a medal wearer actually earned the medal, the purpose of\nthe medal itself is utterly defeated. If we can no longer trust\nwhat we can see, the only honor the United States can confer\non its heroes is a listing in a database. Once wearing the\nmedal itself doesn’t signify anything more than a\npresumption of a property right, the nation’s highest honors\nwill have become, literally, virtual.\n\n                                   III\n\n    I would uphold the constitutionality of §704(a).                    I\nrespectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n     10\n       The majority, quoting Alvarez, refers to the database as an\n“‘information-disseminating device’” for confirming that the medal wearer\nhas actually earned the military honor. Maj. Op. at 31–32 (quoting\nAlvarez, 132 S. Ct. at 2556 (Breyer, J., concurring in the judgment)).\nAlthough it is low-tech, we already have such an “information-\ndisseminating device”: the medal.\n\f</pre>",
