In 28 U.S.C. 1920(3) it is provided that there may be taxed as costs 'Fees and disbursements for printing and witnesses.'  Witness fees are covered by 28 U.S.C. 1821 which allows witnesses attending federal courts or depositions taken pursuant to rule or court order $4 for each day's attendance plus mileage and, in some instances, subsistence.

While that decision came before the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and involved the predecessor statute to 1821, we find nothing in either the rules or the present statute to cast doubt on the applicability of the Henkel decision.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The allowance for the map prepared by the surveyor presents a different problem.
