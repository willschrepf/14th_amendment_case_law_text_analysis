The State contends\nthat the district court acted contrary to the United\nStates Supreme Court’s decision in Missouri v. Jenkins,\n115 S. Ct. 2038 (1995) (Jenkins III) in denying its\nmotion. We do not believe that it did.\n\n\n                            4\n\f    On April 23, 1996, the district court appointed Dr.\nWilliam H. Danforth as settlement coordinator with the\nresponsibility and authority to conduct conferences with\nall persons involved in the case, to secure the services\nof experts, and to stimulate negotiations among the\nparties. Dr. Danforth continues in this capacity as of\nthe date of this opinion. Moreover, the district court\nhas under consideration a motion by the State to have the\nSt. Louis School District declared unitary. Given the\nlong history of state-mandated, segregated schools, the\ncomplexity of the issues, and the difficulty of\ndeveloping a plan that will ensure that students of all\nraces will have a continuing equal opportunity for a\nquality, integrated education, the district court did not\nabuse its discretion in denying the State’s motion to\nphase out the voluntary transfer of black city students\nto county districts pending settlement negotiations. We\nencourage the parties to proceed diligently with their\nnegotiations and believe that the settlement coordinator\nshould   be   permitted   to  complete   this   important\nassignment.   We urge the district court to ascertain the\nstatus of the negotiations, and in the event the\nnegotiations reach an impasse, the district court should\npromptly rule on the pending unitary status motion. We\naffirm the order of the district court.\n\n                                   Background\n\n    The early history of this litigation is chronicled in\nour earlier opinions and will only be summarized here.1\n\n\n      1\n       See Liddell v. Board of Educ., 882 F.2d 298 (8th Cir. 1989); Liddell v. Board\nof Educ., 873 F. 2d 191 (8th Cir. 1989); Liddell v. Missouri, 731 F.2d 1294 (8th Cir.)\n                                          5\n\fIn 1972, the plaintiffs brought an action against the\nBoard of Education of the City of St. Louis (City Board)\nalleging that the city schools were segregated by race as\na matter of state law and practice.      Thereafter, the\nState of\n\n\n\n\n(en banc), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 816 (1984) (Liddell VII); Liddell v. Board of Educ.,\n677 F.2d 626 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 877 (1982) (Liddell V); Liddell v. Board\nof Educ., 667 F.2d 643 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1081 (1981) (Liddell III); and\nAdams v. United States, 620 F.2d 1277 (8th Cir.) (en banc), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 826\n(1980).\n                                           6\n\fMissouri was joined as a party defendant. The plaintiffs\nand the United States as amicus submitted desegregation\nplans to the district court. The district court held a\ntrial and found no constitutional violation.           We\nreversed, holding that prior to 1865 the State prohibited\nthe creation or maintenance of schools for teaching black\nchildren to read or write and that, after that date until\n1980, the City Board and the State were jointly\nresponsible for maintaining a segregated school system.\nAdams v. United States, 620 F.2d 1277, 1280 (8th Cir.)\n(en banc), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 826 (1980).2 We further\nnoted that the City Board and the State failed to take\neffective measures to desegregate the school system in\nthe years immediately following Brown v. Board of\nEducation, 347 U.S. 483 (1954). We remanded the matter\nto the district court with directions to develop and\nimplement a plan to integrate the St. Louis public\nschools.\n\n    On   remand,   the   district   court   ordered   the\nimplementation of a mandatory desegregation plan within\nthe city schools with funding to be shared equally by the\nCity Board and the State. The district court directed\nthe City Board and the State to develop and submit plans\nto alleviate the segregated conditions within the city\nschools through interdistrict transfers between the city\nand the suburban school districts. Liddell v. Board of\nEduc., 491 F. Supp. 351 (E.D. Mo. 1980). The Liddell and\nCaldwell plaintiffs (representing black parents and\nstudents) and the Adams plaintiffs (representing white\n\n\n      2\n        Only one party, the Adams plaintiffs, petitioned the Supreme Court for a writ\nof certiorari. The State did not file a petition.\n                                         7\n\fparents and students) appealed.3 The State contended that\nit should not be required to pay any of the costs of\nintegration and specifically challenged paragraph 12 of\nthe district court’s order which provided:\n\n\n\n\n      3\n        The Liddell plaintiffs contended that the plan did not go far enough to remedy\nthe defendants’ discriminatory practices; and the Adams plaintiffs contended that the\ndistrict court had gone too far in its St. Louis School District reassignment plan.\n                                          8\n\f        12.     The State defendants, the United\n    States, and the St. Louis Board of Education are\n    ordered and directed as follows:\n\n              a)  To make every feasible effort to\n        work out with the appropriate school\n        districts in the St. Louis County and\n        develop, for 1980-81 implementation, a\n        voluntary,   cooperative   plan   of   pupil\n        exchanges which will assist in alleviating\n        the school segregation in the City of St.\n        Louis, and which also insures that inter-\n        district pupil transfers will not impair the\n        desegregation of the St. Louis school\n        district ordered herein, and submit such\n        plan to the Court for approval by July 1,\n        1980.\n\n\nId. at 353.    We affirmed, noting that “the voluntary\nexchanges contemplated by section [12](a) must be viewed\nas a valid part of the attempt to fashion a workable\nremedy within the City.” Liddell v. Board of Educ., 667\nF.2d 643, 651 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1081\n(1981).\n\n    On August 24, 1981, the district court added eighteen\nSt. Louis County suburban school districts (County\nDistricts) as parties defendant and entered various other\norders relating to desegregation of the city schools.\nThe County Districts, the State, and the City Board\nappealed.   The State contended that it could not be\nrequired to implement a remedy affecting County Districts\nuntil a hearing had been held.      The Adams plaintiffs\ncontended the district court could order the State to\nconsolidate city and county schools if necessary to\neffectuate desegregation of the city schools and that\n\n                            9\n\fthese actions could be taken without additional hearings\nor liability findings. The City Board argued that the\ndistrict court orders were not reviewable. We held that\nthe court order adding additional parties was not\nappealable. We stated:\n\n    The district court has yet to issue an order\n    that impacts any of the county schools or units\n    of government. Thus, we are being asked not to\n    rule on a specific plan but to anticipate what\n    the district court may have in mind and to\n    instruct it as to what it can or cannot do. The\n    most that can be said\n\n\n\n\n                           10\n\f      is that the district court has indicated in one\n      or more of its orders that it may take actions\n      which impact significantly on St. Louis County\n      school districts.\n\nLiddell v. Board of Educ., 677 F.2d 626, 641 (8th Cir.),\ncert. denied, 459 U.S. 877 (1982). We remanded to the\ndistrict court for action consistent with our opinion.\n\n    On August 6, 1982, the district court entered an\norder in which it disclosed that if it held a hearing and\nfound   that   the    County   Districts   had   committed\nconstitutional violations that contributed to the\nsegregation of the St. Louis School District, it would\norder the consolidation of the city and county schools.\nThe court scheduled interdistrict liability hearings.\nBefore the hearings were held, however, the City Board,\nthe Liddell plaintiffs, the Caldwell plaintiffs, and all\neighteen County Districts entered into a settlement\nagreement that settled the plaintiffs’ interdistrict\nclaims against the eighteen County Districts.          The\nagreement provided for voluntary interdistrict transfers\nbetween city and county schools and included fiscal\nincentives to be funded by the State to encourage the\ntransfers. Each district receiving sufficient transfers\nwithin   five   years    to  satisfy   its   desegregation\nobligations would receive a final judgment.4 The State,\nhaving been found to be the primary constitutional\nviolator, was ordered to fund the transfer of city\n\n\n      4\n        The settlement agreement further provided “that after a school district receives\nan order granting it final judgment, it has a continuing obligation to: ‘cooperate in the\nrecruitment and promotion of transfers . . . .’” Liddell v. Board of Educ., 96 F.3d 1091,\n1094 (8th Cir. 1996) (quoting Appellants’ Jt. App. at 108).\n                                           11\n\fstudents to the County Districts.       We affirmed the\ndistrict court in an en banc opinion and set forth our\nreasons in great detail. Liddell v. Missouri (Liddell\nVII), 731 F.2d 1294, 1301-09 (8th Cir.) (en banc), cert.\ndenied, 496 U.S. 816 (1984).5\n\n\n\n\n      5\n        In a subsequent opinion, Liddell v. Board of Educ., 851 F.2d 1104, 1105 (8th\nCir. 1988), we noted that 12,000 black students were then enrolled in the County\nDistricts. This number has remained relatively constant up to the present. The County\nDistricts state in their current briefs that they are willing to continue to accept the\nvoluntary transfers under the terms of the settlement agreement. Most, if not all, of the\nCounty Districts have achieved the plan ratios or goals established under the settlement\nagreement.\n                                           12\n\f    In Liddell v. Board of Education, 873 F.2d 191, 192\n(8th Cir. 1989), the State     appealed from a district\ncourt order “clarifying the extent of Missouri’s funding\nobligations for interdistrict student transfers in the .\n. . desegregation case.” It took the position that when\na County District had achieved its designated plan ratio,\nthe State was no longer required to pay for transfers.\nThe State sought further clarification of its funding\nobligation. We stated:\n\n    Missouri’s obligation is to fund interdistrict\n    transfers necessary to reach 15,000 students--no\n    more, no less. . . .      The parties agree the\n    total number of students currently attending\n    county schools under the interdistrict transfer\n    program is less than 15,000. Thus, Missouri’s\n    obligation to fund interdistrict transfers has\n    not yet been fulfilled. Insofar as the district\n    court’s order restoring state funding complies\n    with this portion of our opinion, we affirm.\n    Furthermore, the parties shall take whatever\n    steps are necessary to ensure that 15,000 city\n    students are enrolled in the county schools. In\n    light of the parties’ progress to date, this\n    goal is attainable, and it must be achieved at\n    the earliest opportunity.\n\nId. at 194. No petition for a writ of certiorari was\nfiled. We were asked to clarify our opinion a few months\nlater. We again stated:\n\n        1. Missouri is obligated to fund voluntary\n    transfer students up to a total of 15,000,\n    regardless of any individual county district’s\n    Plan Ratio and/or Plan Goal attainment. . . .\n\n        2.   The state’s obligation to fund the\n    voluntary transfer of students will continue\n\n                           13\n\f    until such time as the state is relieved of that\n    obligation.\n\nLiddell v. Board of Educ., 882 F.2d 298, 299 (8th Cir.\n1989). Again, no petition for a writ of certiorari was\nfiled.\n\n\n\n\n                           14\n\f    In October 1991, the State filed the first of three\nmotions to declare the St. Louis School District unitary,\nterminate   desegregation   funding,   and  release   all\ndefendants from court supervision. The United States,\nthe City Board, and the plaintiffs responded that\nconsideration of unitary status was premature. The State\ndid not reply to the responses. Instead, it filed a new\nmotion on May 7, 1992, requesting partial unitary status.\nThe district court held that while the State’s request\nwas premature,    the State was entitled to answers to\ncertain discovery requests because a future declaration\nof unitary status might be warranted. The State did not\nappeal this ruling to this court.\n\n    In November 1993, the State filed an amended motion\nfor unitary status. It informed the court that it would\nbe prepared to present evidence in support of its amended\nmotion within one year. Eleven months later the State\nasked the district court for a hearing date on its motion\nfor unitary status. On February 28, 1995, the district\ncourt scheduled a hearing for September 1995.        This\nhearing was later rescheduled for March 1996.\n\n    On January 4, 1996, while the unitary status motion\nwas still pending, the State filed a motion to terminate\nthe VITP on the basis of Jenkins III. It described its\nmotion as conditional and not ripe for court action\nbecause it desired a ruling on its motion only if the\ncourt failed to enter a finding of unitary status\nfollowing the hearing scheduled for March 1996. The City\nBoard and the plaintiffs requested that the hearing on\nunitary status be postponed while the State’s Jenkins III\nmotion was adjudicated. The plaintiffs, joined by the\n\n                           15\n\fUnited States, alternatively requested that the court\nappoint a settlement coordinator to resolve the\nlitigation without the need for trial. The State again\nrequested that the Jenkins III issue be addressed only\nafter a hearing on its unitary status motion and then\nonly if the unitary status motion was not granted in\nfull.\n    On February 15, 1996, the court denied the State’s\nJenkins III motion as not ripe.     It also denied the\nrequest to postpone the hearing on unitary status and\ndecided that the\n\n\n\n\n                          16\n\fappointment of a settlement coordinator would be more\nbeneficial after a hearing on the State’s unitary status\nmotion had been held. The court stated that:\n\n    [It] agreed with plaintiffs that the best\n    resolution of this case would be an agreed-upon\n    plan for ending Court supervision of the St.\n    Louis Public Schools.     The Court however is\n    reluctant to continue the hearing. It may well\n    be that the possibility for settlement will be\n    greater following the hearing, at which time the\n    appointment of a Settlement Coordinator would be\n    appropriate and beneficial.\n\nG(1939)96 at 2.    The State did not appeal the order\ndenying its Jenkins III motion.\n\n    In March 1996, following extensive discovery, the\ndistrict court conducted a three-week unitary status\nhearing. Following the hearing, it appointed Dr. William\nH. Danforth, former Chancellor of Washington University\nof St. Louis, as the settlement coordinator. It gave the\ncoordinator   broad    powers   designed   to  stimulate\nnegotiations and directed the parties and their counsel\nto attend all meetings scheduled by the settlement\ncoordinator and to participate in good faith in the\nnegotiations.   It ordered “that all components of the\nsettlement agreement now in force shall continue as they\nare currently operating.” G(2062)96.\n\n    On June 26, 1996, the district court, responding to\na motion by the State, held that settlement negotiations\nwould be kept confidential, that         the settlement\ncoordinator should not recommend to the court how the\ncase should be resolved, and refused to set a time limit\n\n                           17\n\ffor the parties to continue negotiations, indicating it\nwas confident that the settlement coordinator would\nproceed with all diligence. G(2134)96.\n\n    On July 24, 1996, the State appealed district court\norders G(2062)96 and G(2134)96, and sought a stay of the\ninterdistrict component of the desegregation remedy\npending appeal of the order appointing the settlement\ncoordinator. It sought alternative remedies limiting its\nobligations under the desegregation plan. The district\n\n\n\n\n                           18\n\fcourt denied motions for a stay pending appeal on August\n14, 1996. G(2175)96. This court and Justice Thomas, as\nCircuit Justice, denied substantially similar motions for\na stay. The State again appealed the denial of the stay\nmotion. This court consolidated and then dismissed all\npending appeals. We noted that G(2062)96 and G(2134)96\nwere interlocutory and related to settlement procedures\nand case management and could not be characterized as\nappeals from orders denying an injunction.      We stated\nthat “[a] district court, particularly in school\ndesegregation cases, has broad discretion to control its\ndocket and has the necessary flexibility to shape\nremedies that adjust public and private needs.” Liddell\nv. Board of Educ., 105 F.3d 1208, 1212 (8th Cir. 1997).\n With respect to G(2175)96, we stated:\n\n    The State argues that the district court erred\n    because it effectively denied its motion for\n    unitary status.    We disagree.    The district\n    court has yet to rule on the State’s unitary\n    status motion. The district court in this case\n    has not refused to rule on the State’s motion\n    that the St. Louis School District be declared\n    unitary. It has simply postponed post-hearing\n    briefing and deferred final ruling on this\n    matter. We cannot review a matter that has not\n    been ruled on by the district court. We lack\n    jurisdiction over the State’s claim that the\n    district court has erroneously denied its motion\n    for unitary status.\n\n Id. The State filed a petition for rehearing en banc;\nthat petition was denied on May 7, 1997. No petition for\na writ of certiorari was filed.\n\n\n\n\n                           19\n\f    On March 14, 1997, the State moved the district court\nfor an order directing that all parties immediately cease\nefforts to recruit and admit new students into the VITP\nand relieve the State from any funding obligations with\nrespect to such students.      The State made the same\nargument in this motion as it made in Liddell v. Board of\nEducation, 105 F.3d 1208 (8th Cir. 1997), that the VITP\nviolates Jenkins III. On April 10, 1997, the district\ncourt denied the State’s motion, stating that it did so\nfor the\n\n\n\n\n                           20\n\freasons set forth by the responses of certain county\ndistricts,   the  United   States, the   Caldwell-NAACP\nplaintiffs, and the City Board. The State now appeals.6\n\n   The District Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion in\nDenying the\n          State’s Motion to Phase Out the VITP\n\n    The State appeals from a district court order denying\nits motion for an order (1) directing that all parties\nand all court advisory panels immediately cease all\nefforts to recruit and admit new students into the VITP,\nand (2) relieving the State from any funding obligations\nas to such students. We ruled against the State on a\nsimilar question only eight months ago and held that the\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in denying\nthe State’s request. Liddell, 105 F.3d at 1212. No new\narguments are advanced that cause us to change our\nposition at this time. Settlement negotiations are still\nongoing.     At oral argument, counsel for the State\nasserted that settlement negotiations have reached an\n\n\n      6\n        The County Districts maintained that, while they took no position regarding\nwhen the VITP might be phased out, a sufficient amount of “lead time” would be\nnecessary to prevent disruption to students, parents, and staff as well as to preserve the\ninterests of sound budgetary and operational management. The United States\ncontended that the settlement process should be permitted to run its course and that the\nState’s Jenkins III motion was not yet ripe. The Caldwell plaintiffs argued that the\nState had already lost its challenge to the continuation of the VITP and questioned the\nState’s public posturing during the settlement process. They maintained that the State\nhad made no showing that the city schools, faculty, etc. were capable of absorbing\nreturning students if the VITP were terminated. The City Board argued that the State’s\nmotion should be denied because it undermined the settlement process, failed on the\nmerits, and violated the mandate from Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. 467 (1992), that\nrequires a transition phase for the orderly withdrawal of court supervision.\n                                           21\n\fimpasse, but counsel for all the other parties disagreed.\nAs all parties are bound by a district court order to\nmaintain   confidentiality    and   as   the   settlement\ncoordinator has not yet filed a report indicating an\nimpasse, we\n\n\n\n\n                           22\n\fcan only assume the settlement coordinator is making\nevery effort to resolve the many complex issues that must\nbe addressed.7\n\n    It is important to bear in mind that the current\nschool desegregation plan is based on a “unique and\ncomprehensive settlement agreement” approved by this\ncourt sitting en banc in 1984.      Liddell, 731 F.2d at\n     8\n1297. We note that all parties other than the State have\nindicated a willingness to continue essential elements of\nthe plan, including the interdistrict transfer of black\ncity students to the County Districts.\n\n    Settlement is the preferred method of resolving\nprotracted school desegregation cases. As recently as\n\n\n       7\n       We note that as recently as September 10, 1997, the attorney general of the\nState of Missouri made public a new proposal to end the litigation. We assume the\nsettlement director and all parties to this litigation were notified of the proposal and that\nthis proposal, as well as others, will be considered by the parties in settlement\nnegotiations.\n       8\n      This desegregation plan resulted from a settlement agreement encouraged by the\nHonorable William L. Hungate, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of\nMissouri. In encouraging the parties to settle, he stated:\n\n       Society’s greatest opportunities lie in encouraging human inclinations\n       toward compromise, rather than stirring our tendencies for competition\n       and rivalry. If lawyers, educators, and public officials do not help\n       marshall cooperation and design mechanisms that promote peaceful\n       resolution of conflicts, we shall miss an opportunity to participate in the\n       most creative social experiments of our time.\n\nLiddell v. Board of Educ., 567 F. Supp. 1037, 1041 (E.D. Mo. 1983) (citation omitted).\n\n\n                                             23\n\f1990 in considering the proposed settlement of the Little\nRock School District desegregation case, we stated:\n\n\n\n\n                           24\n\f      The law strongly favors settlements.      Courts\n      should hospitably receive them.     This may be\n      especially true in the present context--a\n      protracted,   highly   divisive,   even   bitter\n      [desegregation] litigation, any lasting solution\n      to which necessarily depends on the good faith\n      and cooperation of all the parties, especially\n      the defendants. As a practical matter, a remedy\n      that everyone agrees to is a lot more likely to\n      succeed than one to which the defendants must be\n      dragged kicking and screaming.\n\nLittle Rock Sch. Dist. v. Pulaski County Special Sch.\nDist. No. 1, 921 F.2d 1371, 1383 (8th Cir. 1990).\nConsistent with this court’s preference, we recently\napproved a settlement agreement in the Kansas City School\nDistrict desegregation case. Jenkins v. Missouri, No. 97-\n1968, slip op. at 35 (8th Cir. Aug. 12, 1997).9\n\n    Given the long history of state-mandated, segregated\nschools, the complexity of the issues, and the difficulty\nof developing a plan that will ensure that students of\nall races will have a continuing equal opportunity for a\nquality, integrated education, the district court did not\nabuse its discretion in denying the State’s motion to\nphase out the voluntary transfer of black city students\nto the County Districts pending settlement negotiations.\n\n\n      9\n       The general principle that the law favors settlement agreements has been\nrecognized for over 100 years. See Williams v. First Nat’l Bank, 216 U.S. 582, 595\n(1910) (compromises of disputed claims are favored by the courts) (citing Hennessy\nv. Bacon, 137 U.S. 78 (1890)). This principle is recognized in desegregation cases.\nArmstrong v. Board of Sch. Dirs., 616 F.2d 305, 313 (7th Cir. 1980)); Jones v. Caddo\nParish Sch. Bd., 704 F.2d 206, 221 (5th Cir. 1983). See also Daniel J. McMullen and\nIrene Hirata McMullen, Stubborn Facts of History--The Vestiges of Past\nDiscrimination in School Desegregation Cases, 44 Case W. Res. L. Rev. 75 (1993)).\n                                        25\n\f    There can be no doubt as to the complexity of the\nissues that need to be resolved either by settlement or\ncourt order.   For example, over the course of several\nyears, approximately 12,000 black city students per year\nhave voluntarily transferred from city schools to county\nschools.    Ending or phasing out this program will\ninevitably lead to\n\n\n\n\n                           26\n\fa significant increase in the black population of the St.\nLouis School District and may well result in the\nresegregation of the St. Louis schools through something\nother than a change in demographic factors. Moreover,\nthe desegregation plan involves remedial programs, magnet\nschools, student assignments, teacher exchanges, and\nother programs designed to give students of all races an\nequal opportunity for a quality, integrated education,\neach of which must be independently considered pursuant\nto Green v. New Kent County School Board., 391 U.S. 430\n(1968), and Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. 467 (1992). From\nthe beginning, the plan has relied on state and city\nfunding. All elements of the plan have been repeatedly\nsubject to district and circuit court review, many of\nwhich became the subject of petitions for writs of\ncertiorari to the United States Supreme Court. See note\n1, supra. Under these circumstances, we do not believe\nthat the district court abused its discretion in refusing\nthe State’s request to enjoin the parties and panels from\nimmediately ceasing all efforts to recruit and admit new\nstudents into the VITP and relieve the State from any\nfunding obligations as to such students pending\nsettlement negotiations.\n\n               The Unitary Status Motion\n\n    In the event the district court determines that an\nimpasse in the settlement negotiations has been reached,\nit must then decide the State’s pending motion to have\nthe St. Louis School District declared unitary and\ndetermine the consequences that flow from that decision.\nIn reaching these decisions, the district court shall be\nguided by the Supreme Court’s decisions in Freeman,\n\n                           27\n\fDowell v. Board of Education of Oklahoma City Public\nSchools, 498 U.S. 237 (1991), and Green.\n\n    It is clear from these decisions, particularly\nFreeman and Dowell, that the Supreme Court requires that\nonce a school district has achieved unitary status, a\ndistrict court should not deny that status to a school\ndistrict because of demographic factors or changes since\nthe desegregation plan was initiated.    The Court made\nclear in Dowell\n\n\n\n\n                           28\n\fthat on obtaining unitary status, the defendant school\ndistrict would not return to its former ways.10\n\n    Herein lies the problem.      The historical record\nreveals that significant progress has been made in\nproviding equal opportunities through the programs that\nhave been in effect for several years.     As previously\nnoted, if some or all of these programs are ended by a\ndeclaration that the St. Louis School District has\nachieved unitary status, then the immediate effect will\nmost probably be a significant resegregation of the city\nschools.     The inescapable result would be that\napproximately 12,000 black students would be reassigned\nto the city schools, thereby increasing the degree of\nsegregation in those schools. Unlike the situation in\nFreeman and Dowell, the resegregation would not result\nfrom changed demographic factors. Moreover, segregation\nmay very well be increased in the city schools if the\nmagnet or remedial programs are either eliminated or\nlimited in scope and the students are reassigned on the\nbasis of neighborhood schools rather than on the current\nbasis, which is designed to secure the maximum\n\n\n      10\n        The Court stated that:\n\n      In the present case, a finding by the District Court that the Oklahoma City\n      School District was being operated in compliance with the commands of\n      the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and that it was\n      unlikely that the Board would return to its former ways, would be a\n      finding that the purposes of the desegregation litigation had been fully\n      achieved. No additional showing of ‘grievous wrong evoked by new and\n      unforeseen conditions’ is required of the Board.\n\nDowell, 498 U.S. at 247.\n                                          29\n\fdesegregation practicable.11 We do not say and are not\nprepared to say at this time how the mandate of the\nSupreme Court, particularly in Dowell that\n\n\n\n\n      11\n         It may well be, as Freeman points out, that some elements of the program are\nunitary and will remain so if that status is declared. The Supreme Court states that each\nelement is to be treated independently. Freeman, 503 U.S. at 489.\n                                           30\n\fresegregation should not result from a declaration of\nunitary status, can be achieved; but the issue is one\nthat must be dealt with either in settlement negotiations\nor by district court order.\n\n    The State does not dispute the fact that ending the\nvoluntary interdistrict transfer of black city students\nto the County Districts and limiting its other\nresponsibilities    will   probably    result   in   some\nresegregation of the city schools. Nor does it dispute\nthat black students in St. Louis were either denied an\neducation or limited to attending segregated schools for\nat least 140 years, resulting in savings to the St. Louis\nSchool District and the State.      See Adams v. United\nStates, 620 F.2d 1277 (8th Cir. 1980).        Rather than\naddress these issues, the State argues that it has\nexpended large sums of money in the twenty years that\nthis program has been in effect, it has done its share,\nand the time has come to end its responsibilities in the\nmatter. In support of ending its obligations, the State\npoints to the fact that it has initiated a number of\nprograms that have particular benefit to disadvantaged\ncity students12 and has publicly proposed to settle its\nobligations by making a lump sum payment to the St. Louis\nSchool District.\n    The district court must take all of these factors\ninto consideration in determining whether to grant full\n\n      12\n         These programs include a comprehensive school improvement program,\nreading intervention programs, drug-free schools program, emphasis on early childhood\neducation, early childhood programs, AIDS awareness education, unwed mothers’\neducation, gun-free schools, provision of medical services to Medicaid-eligible school\nchildren, and Missouri’s nationally-renowned “Parents as Teachers” program. See Mo.\nRev. Stat. §§ 162.300; 167.268, .270, .294, .606; 191.668; 195.214; 571.030.\n                                         31\n\for partial unitary status and what the defendants’\ncontinuing obligations will be if such status is granted.\nWe will not prejudge that matter or issue an advisory\nopinion.   We merely repeat that the complexity of the\nissues involved support the view heretofore expressed\nthat the best way to resolve these problems and provide\na quality, integrated education to all city students is\nthrough good-faith settlement negotiations.\n\n\n\n\n                           32\n\f                          The Jenkins III Issue\n\n    The State’s principal argument is that the district\ncourt is without discretion in this matter and that\nJenkins III requires that the VITP be phased out now. We\ndo not agree that Jenkins III requires this result. A\npremise of Jenkins III was that the trial court\nspecifically found that no interdistrict violation had\ntaken place. No such determination has been made here.13\nTo the contrary, from the beginning the plaintiffs\nasserted interdistrict violations. Rather than contest\nthese allegations, the County Districts entered into a\nsettlement agreement under which they agreed to accept a\nsignificant number of transfer students and in return\nwere promised judgments relieving them from any possible\nconstitutional violations. Under these circumstances, it\nwould be wholly inappropriate for this court to make an\ninitial determination with respect to an interdistrict\nviolation.\n      Making such a determination would invade the\nprovince of the district court and would be unfair to the\nparties by denying them the opportunity, should it become\nnecessary, to litigate the interdistrict violation issue.\nTo require the County Districts to litigate this issue\nnow, after voluntarily accepting thousands of city\ntransfer students for twenty years, would violate their\nfundamental right to due process. The plaintiffs would\n\n\n      13\n        Justice O’Connor stated in Jenkins III in discussing the Kansas City School\nDistrict, “Neither the legal responsibility for nor the causal effects of . . . racial\nsegregation transgressed its boundaries, and absent such interdistrict violation or\nsegregative effects, Milliken and Gatreaux do not permit a regional remedial plan.”\nJenkins III, 115 S. Ct. at 2059 (O’Connor, J., concurring).\n                                         33\n\fbe equally deprived if they were denied the opportunity\nto prove interdistrict violations.         Moreover, the\nfundamental and undisputed fact remains that the State\nhas been found to be the primary constitutional violator,\nand this court has consistently held in panel and in en\nbanc opinions that the State could be required to fund\nthe VITP.     See note 1, supra.       Even if it were\nappropriate for us to address that issue today, however,\nthis court could not make a proper determination without\na complete record. In order\n\n\n\n\n                           34\n\fto apprehend fully the constitutional violations as they\nexisted many years ago, we must employ something more\nrigorous than hindsight, guesswork, and speculation.\n\n     In Jenkins III, Chief Justice Rehnquist, speaking for\nthe Court, stated that the Kansas City desegregation plan\nwas    grounded    in    “improving   the    desegregative\nattractiveness of the” Kansas City, Missouri School\nDistrict (KCMSD).      Jenkins III, 115 S. Ct. at 2050.\nHere,    neither   “desegregative   attractiveness”    nor\n“suburban comparability” were the basis of the settlement\nagreement or the district court’s or this court’s\napproval of the settlement plan. Rather, the plan was\npremised on the fact that both the State and the County\nDistricts opposed consolidation of the city and county\ndistricts and a voluntary transfer plan could and would\nbe an integral factor in desegregating the city schools.\nEveryone but the State agreed to this solution, and it\noffered no alternative designed to secure the black city\nstudents an opportunity for an equal education.        The\npremise has proven valid, and the St. Louis schools have\nachieved a high degree of integration.\n     We also note that Justice O’Connor, who concurred in\nthe plurality opinion in Jenkins III, stated that the\ndistrict court found “that the segregative effects of\nKCMSD’s constitutional violation did not transcend its\ngeographical boundaries.” Jenkins III, id. at 2060. As\npreviously noted, there has been no such finding in this\ncase.    Indeed, the parties are still at odds as to\nwhether interdistrict violations occurred; and rather\nthan    have  this    argument  resolved   after   lengthy\nlitigation, the plaintiffs, the City Board, the County\nDistricts, and the United States agreed to the VITP.\n\n                            35\n\fJustice O’Connor also noted the limited nature of the\nJenkins III decision and remand, stating that “[t]he\nCourt today discusses desegregative attractiveness only\ninsofar as it supports the salary increase order under\nreview, . . . and properly refrains from addressing the\n\n\n\n\n                          36\n\fpropriety of all the remedies that the District Court has\nordered, revised, and extended in the 18-year history of\nthis case.” Id. at 2061.14\n\n    There is, of course, language in the majority opinion\nin Jenkins III suggesting that no interdistrict relief\ncan be granted unless an interdistrict violation or\nsegregative effects have been proved. This language must\nbe tempered by the facts in Jenkins III and limited\nnature of the actual holding. In our view, the question\nremains sufficiently open to permit us to follow our\nnumerous precedents and hold that Jenkins III does not\nrequire us to hold that the VITP must be terminated or\nphased out at this time.\n\n                                    Conclusion\n\n    We affirm the order of the district court denying the\nState’s motion to end all efforts to recruit and admit\nnew students into the VITP for the 1997-98 school year.\nThe district court did not abuse its discretion in\ndenying the State’s motion to phase out the voluntary\ntransfer of black city students to the County Districts\npending settlement negotiations. Its decision to do so\nwas not contrary to the Supreme Court’s decision in\nJenkins III. We renew our encouragement to the parties\nto make every effort to resolve this matter so that\n\n\n      14\n         The district court determined that the KCMSD had attained unitariness in only\none of the five aspects enumerated in Green, 391 U.S. at 435.

We do not believe that it did.\n\n\n                            4\n\f    On April 23, 1996, the district court appointed Dr.\nWilliam H. Danforth as settlement coordinator with the\nresponsibility and authority to conduct conferences with\nall persons involved in the case, to secure the services\nof experts, and to stimulate negotiations among the\nparties. Dr. Danforth continues in this capacity as of\nthe date of this opinion. Moreover, the district court\nhas under consideration a motion by the State to have the\nSt. Louis School District declared unitary. Given the\nlong history of state-mandated, segregated schools, the\ncomplexity of the issues, and the difficulty of\ndeveloping a plan that will ensure that students of all\nraces will have a continuing equal opportunity for a\nquality, integrated education, the district court did not\nabuse its discretion in denying the State’s motion to\nphase out the voluntary transfer of black city students\nto county districts pending settlement negotiations. We\nencourage the parties to proceed diligently with their\nnegotiations and believe that the settlement coordinator\nshould   be   permitted   to  complete   this   important\nassignment.   We urge the district court to ascertain the\nstatus of the negotiations, and in the event the\nnegotiations reach an impasse, the district court should\npromptly rule on the pending unitary status motion.

We stated:\n\n    Missouri’s obligation is to fund interdistrict\n    transfers necessary to reach 15,000 students--no\n    more, no less. . . .      The parties agree the\n    total number of students currently attending\n    county schools under the interdistrict transfer\n    program is less than 15,000. Thus, Missouri’s\n    obligation to fund interdistrict transfers has\n    not yet been fulfilled.

Again, no petition for a writ of certiorari was\nfiled.\n\n\n\n\n                           14\n\f    In October 1991, the State filed the first of three\nmotions to declare the St. Louis School District unitary,\nterminate   desegregation   funding,   and  release   all\ndefendants from court supervision. The United States,\nthe City Board, and the plaintiffs responded that\nconsideration of unitary status was premature. The State\ndid not reply to the responses. Instead, it filed a new\nmotion on May 7, 1992, requesting partial unitary status.\nThe district court held that while the State’s request\nwas premature,    the State was entitled to answers to\ncertain discovery requests because a future declaration\nof unitary status might be warranted. The State did not\nappeal this ruling to this court.\n\n    In November 1993, the State filed an amended motion\nfor unitary status. It informed the court that it would\nbe prepared to present evidence in support of its amended\nmotion within one year. Eleven months later the State\nasked the district court for a hearing date on its motion\nfor unitary status. On February 28, 1995, the district\ncourt scheduled a hearing for September 1995.        This\nhearing was later rescheduled for March 1996.\n\n    On January 4, 1996, while the unitary status motion\nwas still pending, the State filed a motion to terminate\nthe VITP on the basis of Jenkins III. It described its\nmotion as conditional and not ripe for court action\nbecause it desired a ruling on its motion only if the\ncourt failed to enter a finding of unitary status\nfollowing the hearing scheduled for March 1996. The City\nBoard and the plaintiffs requested that the hearing on\nunitary status be postponed while the State’s Jenkins III\nmotion was adjudicated. The plaintiffs, joined by the\n\n                           15\n\fUnited States, alternatively requested that the court\nappoint a settlement coordinator to resolve the\nlitigation without the need for trial. The State again\nrequested that the Jenkins III issue be addressed only\nafter a hearing on its unitary status motion and then\nonly if the unitary status motion was not granted in\nfull.\n    On February 15, 1996, the court denied the State’s\nJenkins III motion as not ripe.     It also denied the\nrequest to postpone the hearing on unitary status and\ndecided that the\n\n\n\n\n                          16\n\fappointment of a settlement coordinator would be more\nbeneficial after a hearing on the State’s unitary status\nmotion had been held. The court stated that:\n\n    [It] agreed with plaintiffs that the best\n    resolution of this case would be an agreed-upon\n    plan for ending Court supervision of the St.\n    Louis Public Schools.     The Court however is\n    reluctant to continue the hearing. It may well\n    be that the possibility for settlement will be\n    greater following the hearing, at which time the\n    appointment of a Settlement Coordinator would be\n    appropriate and beneficial.\n\nG(1939)96 at 2.    The State did not appeal the order\ndenying its Jenkins III motion.\n\n    In March 1996, following extensive discovery, the\ndistrict court conducted a three-week unitary status\nhearing. Following the hearing, it appointed Dr. William\nH. Danforth, former Chancellor of Washington University\nof St. Louis, as the settlement coordinator. It gave the\ncoordinator   broad    powers   designed   to  stimulate\nnegotiations and directed the parties and their counsel\nto attend all meetings scheduled by the settlement\ncoordinator and to participate in good faith in the\nnegotiations.   It ordered “that all components of the\nsettlement agreement now in force shall continue as they\nare currently operating.” G(2062)96.\n\n    On June 26, 1996, the district court, responding to\na motion by the State, held that settlement negotiations\nwould be kept confidential, that         the settlement\ncoordinator should not recommend to the court how the\ncase should be resolved, and refused to set a time limit\n\n                           17\n\ffor the parties to continue negotiations, indicating it\nwas confident that the settlement coordinator would\nproceed with all diligence. G(2134)96.\n\n    On July 24, 1996, the State appealed district court\norders G(2062)96 and G(2134)96, and sought a stay of the\ninterdistrict component of the desegregation remedy\npending appeal of the order appointing the settlement\ncoordinator. It sought alternative remedies limiting its\nobligations under the desegregation plan. The district\n\n\n\n\n                           18\n\fcourt denied motions for a stay pending appeal on August\n14, 1996. G(2175)96. This court and Justice Thomas, as\nCircuit Justice, denied substantially similar motions for\na stay. The State again appealed the denial of the stay\nmotion. This court consolidated and then dismissed all\npending appeals. We noted that G(2062)96 and G(2134)96\nwere interlocutory and related to settlement procedures\nand case management and could not be characterized as\nappeals from orders denying an injunction.

We disagree.    The district\n    court has yet to rule on the State’s unitary\n    status motion. The district court in this case\n    has not refused to rule on the State’s motion\n    that the St. Louis School District be declared\n    unitary. It has simply postponed post-hearing\n    briefing and deferred final ruling on this\n    matter. We cannot review a matter that has not\n    been ruled on by the district court. We lack\n    jurisdiction over the State’s claim that the\n    district court has erroneously denied its motion\n    for unitary status.\n\n Id.

The State now appeals.6\n\n   The District Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion in\nDenying the\n          State’s Motion to Phase Out the VITP\n\n    The State appeals from a district court order denying\nits motion for an order (1) directing that all parties\nand all court advisory panels immediately cease all\nefforts to recruit and admit new students into the VITP,\nand (2) relieving the State from any funding obligations\nas to such students. We ruled against the State on a\nsimilar question only eight months ago and held that the\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in denying\nthe State’s request. Liddell, 105 F.3d at 1212.

The United States\ncontended that the settlement process should be permitted to run its course and that the\nState’s Jenkins III motion was not yet ripe. The Caldwell plaintiffs argued that the\nState had already lost its challenge to the continuation of the VITP and questioned the\nState’s public posturing during the settlement process. They maintained that the State\nhad made no showing that the city schools, faculty, etc. were capable of absorbing\nreturning students if the VITP were terminated. The City Board argued that the State’s\nmotion should be denied because it undermined the settlement process, failed on the\nmerits, and violated the mandate from Freeman v.

Liddell, 731 F.2d at\n     8\n1297. We note that all parties other than the State have\nindicated a willingness to continue essential elements of\nthe plan, including the interdistrict transfer of black\ncity students to the County Districts.\n\n    Settlement is the preferred method of resolving\nprotracted school desegregation cases.

In encouraging the parties to settle, he stated:\n\n       Society’s greatest opportunities lie in encouraging human inclinations\n       toward compromise, rather than stirring our tendencies for competition\n       and rivalry.

Moreover,\nthe desegregation plan involves remedial programs, magnet\nschools, student assignments, teacher exchanges, and\nother programs designed to give students of all races an\nequal opportunity for a quality, integrated education,\neach of which must be independently considered pursuant\nto Green v.

From\nthe beginning, the plan has relied on state and city\nfunding. All elements of the plan have been repeatedly\nsubject to district and circuit court review, many of\nwhich became the subject of petitions for writs of\ncertiorari to the United States Supreme Court. See note\n1, supra. Under these circumstances, we do not believe\nthat the district court abused its discretion in refusing\nthe State’s request to enjoin the parties and panels from\nimmediately ceasing all efforts to recruit and admit new\nstudents into the VITP and relieve the State from any\nfunding obligations as to such students pending\nsettlement negotiations.\n\n               The Unitary Status Motion\n\n    In the event the district court determines that an\nimpasse in the settlement negotiations has been reached,\nit must then decide the State’s pending motion to have\nthe St. Louis School District declared unitary and\ndetermine the consequences that flow from that decision.\nIn reaching these decisions, the district court shall be\nguided by the Supreme Court’s decisions in Freeman,\n\n                           27\n\fDowell v. Board of Education of Oklahoma City Public\nSchools, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112520\"><a href=\"/opinion/112520/board-of-ed-of-oklahoma-city-public-schools-v-dowell/\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">237</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1991), and Green.\n\n    It is clear from these decisions, particularly\nFreeman and Dowell, that the Supreme Court requires that\nonce a school district has achieved unitary status, a\ndistrict court should not deny that status to a school\ndistrict because of demographic factors or changes since\nthe desegregation plan was initiated.    The Court made\nclear in Dowell\n\n\n\n\n                           28\n\fthat on obtaining unitary status, the defendant school\ndistrict would not return to its former ways.10\n\n    Herein lies the problem.      The historical record\nreveals that significant progress has been made in\nproviding equal opportunities through the programs that\nhave been in effect for several years.     As previously\nnoted, if some or all of these programs are ended by a\ndeclaration that the St. Louis School District has\nachieved unitary status, then the immediate effect will\nmost probably be a significant resegregation of the city\nschools.     The inescapable result would be that\napproximately 12,000 black students would be reassigned\nto the city schools, thereby increasing the degree of\nsegregation in those schools. Unlike the situation in\nFreeman and Dowell, the resegregation would not result\nfrom changed demographic factors. Moreover, segregation\nmay very well be increased in the city schools if the\nmagnet or remedial programs are either eliminated or\nlimited in scope and the students are reassigned on the\nbasis of neighborhood schools rather than on the current\nbasis, which is designed to secure the maximum\n\n\n      10\n        The Court stated that:\n\n      In the present case, a finding by the District Court that the Oklahoma City\n      School District was being operated in compliance with the commands of\n      the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and that it was\n      unlikely that the Board would return to its former ways, would be a\n      finding that the purposes of the desegregation litigation had been fully\n      achieved. No additional showing of ‘grievous wrong evoked by new and\n      unforeseen conditions’ is required of the Board.\n\nDowell, 498 U.S. at 247.\n                                          29\n\fdesegregation practicable.11 We do not say and are not\nprepared to say at this time how the mandate of the\nSupreme Court, particularly in Dowell that\n\n\n\n\n      11\n         It may well be, as Freeman points out, that some elements of the program are\nunitary and will remain so if that status is declared. The Supreme Court states that each\nelement is to be treated independently. Freeman, 503 U.S. at 489.\n                                           30\n\fresegregation should not result from a declaration of\nunitary status, can be achieved; but the issue is one\nthat must be dealt with either in settlement negotiations\nor by district court order.\n\n    The State does not dispute the fact that ending the\nvoluntary interdistrict transfer of black city students\nto the County Districts and limiting its other\nresponsibilities    will   probably    result   in   some\nresegregation of the city schools. Nor does it dispute\nthat black students in St. Louis were either denied an\neducation or limited to attending segregated schools for\nat least 140 years, resulting in savings to the St. Louis\nSchool District and the State.      See Adams v. United\nStates, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"377936\"><a href=\"/opinion/377936/janice-adams-and-jack-adams-jr-minors-by-jerrianne-adams-their-natural/\"><span class=\"volume\">620</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1277</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (8th Cir. 1980).        Rather than\naddress these issues, the State argues that it has\nexpended large sums of money in the twenty years that\nthis program has been in effect, it has done its share,\nand the time has come to end its responsibilities in the\nmatter. In support of ending its obligations, the State\npoints to the fact that it has initiated a number of\nprograms that have particular benefit to disadvantaged\ncity students12 and has publicly proposed to settle its\nobligations by making a lump sum payment to the St. Louis\nSchool District.\n    The district court must take all of these factors\ninto consideration in determining whether to grant full\n\n      12\n         These programs include a comprehensive school improvement program,\nreading intervention programs, drug-free schools program, emphasis on early childhood\neducation, early childhood programs, AIDS awareness education, unwed mothers’\neducation, gun-free schools, provision of medical services to Medicaid-eligible school\nchildren, and Missouri’s nationally-renowned “Parents as Teachers” program. See Mo.\nRev. Stat. §§ 162.300; 167.268, .270, .294, .606; 191.668; 195.214; 571.030.\n                                         31\n\for partial unitary status and what the defendants’\ncontinuing obligations will be if such status is granted.\nWe will not prejudge that matter or issue an advisory\nopinion.   We merely repeat that the complexity of the\nissues involved support the view heretofore expressed\nthat the best way to resolve these problems and provide\na quality, integrated education to all city students is\nthrough good-faith settlement negotiations.\n\n\n\n\n                           32\n\f                          The Jenkins III Issue\n\n    The State’s principal argument is that the district\ncourt is without discretion in this matter and that\nJenkins III requires that the VITP be phased out now. We\ndo not agree that Jenkins III requires this result. A\npremise of Jenkins III was that the trial court\nspecifically found that no interdistrict violation had\ntaken place. No such determination has been made here.13\nTo the contrary, from the beginning the plaintiffs\nasserted interdistrict violations. Rather than contest\nthese allegations, the County Districts entered into a\nsettlement agreement under which they agreed to accept a\nsignificant number of transfer students and in return\nwere promised judgments relieving them from any possible\nconstitutional violations. Under these circumstances, it\nwould be wholly inappropriate for this court to make an\ninitial determination with respect to an interdistrict\nviolation.\n      Making such a determination would invade the\nprovince of the district court and would be unfair to the\nparties by denying them the opportunity, should it become\nnecessary, to litigate the interdistrict violation issue.\nTo require the County Districts to litigate this issue\nnow, after voluntarily accepting thousands of city\ntransfer students for twenty years, would violate their\nfundamental right to due process. The plaintiffs would\n\n\n      13\n        Justice O’Connor stated in Jenkins III in discussing the Kansas City School\nDistrict, “Neither the legal responsibility for nor the causal effects of . . . racial\nsegregation transgressed its boundaries, and absent such interdistrict violation or\nsegregative effects, Milliken and Gatreaux do not permit a regional remedial plan.”\nJenkins III, 115 S. Ct. at 2059 (O’Connor, J., concurring).\n                                         33\n\fbe equally deprived if they were denied the opportunity\nto prove interdistrict violations.         Moreover, the\nfundamental and undisputed fact remains that the State\nhas been found to be the primary constitutional violator,\nand this court has consistently held in panel and in en\nbanc opinions that the State could be required to fund\nthe VITP.     See note 1, supra.       Even if it were\nappropriate for us to address that issue today, however,\nthis court could not make a proper determination without\na complete record. In order\n\n\n\n\n                           34\n\fto apprehend fully the constitutional violations as they\nexisted many years ago, we must employ something more\nrigorous than hindsight, guesswork, and speculation.\n\n     In Jenkins III, Chief Justice Rehnquist, speaking for\nthe Court, stated that the Kansas City desegregation plan\nwas    grounded    in    “improving   the    desegregative\nattractiveness of the” Kansas City, Missouri School\nDistrict (KCMSD).      Jenkins III, 115 S. Ct. at 2050.\nHere,    neither   “desegregative   attractiveness”    nor\n“suburban comparability” were the basis of the settlement\nagreement or the district court’s or this court’s\napproval of the settlement plan. Rather, the plan was\npremised on the fact that both the State and the County\nDistricts opposed consolidation of the city and county\ndistricts and a voluntary transfer plan could and would\nbe an integral factor in desegregating the city schools.\nEveryone but the State agreed to this solution, and it\noffered no alternative designed to secure the black city\nstudents an opportunity for an equal education.        The\npremise has proven valid, and the St. Louis schools have\nachieved a high degree of integration.\n     We also note that Justice O’Connor, who concurred in\nthe plurality opinion in Jenkins III, stated that the\ndistrict court found “that the segregative effects of\nKCMSD’s constitutional violation did not transcend its\ngeographical boundaries.” Jenkins III, id. at 2060. As\npreviously noted, there has been no such finding in this\ncase.    Indeed, the parties are still at odds as to\nwhether interdistrict violations occurred; and rather\nthan    have  this    argument  resolved   after   lengthy\nlitigation, the plaintiffs, the City Board, the County\nDistricts, and the United States agreed to the VITP.\n\n                            35\n\fJustice O’Connor also noted the limited nature of the\nJenkins III decision and remand, stating that “[t]he\nCourt today discusses desegregative attractiveness only\ninsofar as it supports the salary increase order under\nreview, . . . and properly refrains from addressing the\n\n\n\n\n                          36\n\fpropriety of all the remedies that the District Court has\nordered, revised, and extended in the 18-year history of\nthis case.” Id. at 2061.14\n\n    There is, of course, language in the majority opinion\nin Jenkins III suggesting that no interdistrict relief\ncan be granted unless an interdistrict violation or\nsegregative effects have been proved. This language must\nbe tempered by the facts in Jenkins III and limited\nnature of the actual holding. In our view, the question\nremains sufficiently open to permit us to follow our\nnumerous precedents and hold that Jenkins III does not\nrequire us to hold that the VITP must be terminated or\nphased out at this time.\n\n                                    Conclusion\n\n    We affirm the order of the district court denying the\nState’s motion to end all efforts to recruit and admit\nnew students into the VITP for the 1997-98 school year.\nThe district court did not abuse its discretion in\ndenying the State’s motion to phase out the voluntary\ntransfer of black city students to the County Districts\npending settlement negotiations. Its decision to do so\nwas not contrary to the Supreme Court’s decision in\nJenkins III. We renew our encouragement to the parties\nto make every effort to resolve this matter so that\n\n\n      14\n         The district court determined that the KCMSD had attained unitariness in only\none of the five aspects enumerated in Green, 391 U.S. at 435. Jenkins v. Missouri, No.\n77-0420-CV-W-RGC, slip op. at 28-37, 59 (W.D. Mo. Mar. 25, 1997). We affirmed\nthe district court’s order. Jenkins v. Missouri, No. 97-1968, slip op. (8th Cir. Aug. 12,\n1997).\n                                           37\n\fstudents of all races will have a continuing equal\nopportunity for a quality, integrated education. In the\nunfortunate event that the negotiations reach an impasse,\nthe district court should promptly rule on the pending\nunitary status motion.\n\n\n\n\n                           38\n\fA true copy.\n\n    Attest.\n\n        CLERK, U.S. COURT OF APPEALS, EIGHTH CIRCUIT.\n\n\n\n\n                       39\n\f</pre>",
