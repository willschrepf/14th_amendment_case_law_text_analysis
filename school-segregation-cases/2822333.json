Glen Arnold brought this\r                    BOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge.\r                            ____________________\r<br>\r<br>          action against United  Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS),  alleging that\r<br>\r<br>          UPS  refused  to hire  him  because of  his  disability, diabetes\r<br>\r<br>          mellitus, in  violation of  the Americans  with Disabilities  Act\r<br>\r<br>          (ADA), 42 U.S.C.    12101  et seq.   The  district court  granted\r                                     ______\r<br>\r<br>          summary judgment to UPS, on the ground that Arnold had not  shown\r<br>\r<br>          that  he had a disability and therefore  was not protected by the\r<br>\r<br>          ADA's antidiscrimination provision.  In making its determination,\r<br>\r<br>          the  court considered  Arnold's diabetes  in  its treated  state,\r<br>\r<br>          after taking into account the ameliorative effects of his insulin\r<br>\r<br>          medication.   Arnold appeals, arguing  that such an  analysis was\r<br>\r<br>          legally erroneous, inconsistent  with the ADA and with the EEOC's\r<br>\r<br>          interpretive regulations.   He also argues that the  facts he has\r<br>\r<br>          introduced prove that he satisfies the statutory definition of an\r<br>\r<br>          \"individual  with  a  disability,\" and  that  UPS  has failed  to\r<br>\r<br>          demonstrate that it is  entitled to judgment as a matter  of law.\r<br>\r<br>          UPS  argues  that  the  district  court's  analysis  of  Arnold's\r<br>\r<br>          disability   was   proper,   including   its   consideration   of\r<br>\r<br>          ameliorative  medication.  As an alternative ground for upholding\r<br>\r<br>          the   grant  of  summary  judgment,  UPS  contends  that  federal\r<br>\r<br>          regulations  required  it   to  deny  Arnold's   application  for\r<br>\r<br>          employment, and UPS  is thereby entitled to judgment  as a matter\r<br>\r<br>          of law.  We reverse and remand.\r<br>\r<br>                                        Facts\r                                        Facts\r                                        _____\r<br>\r<br>                    Because this  is  an appeal  from  a grant  of  summary\r<br>\r<br>          judgment in  favor of  defendant UPS, we  state the facts  in the\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -2-\r                                          2\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          light most favorable to the  nonmovant, Arnold.

United\r                                                           ______    ______\r<br>\r<br>          States Dep't of Agriculture, 102 F.3d 1273, 1284 (1st Cir. 1996),\r          ___________________________\r<br>\r<br>          cert.  denied, 117 S. Ct.  2510 (1997).  Plaintiff-Appellant Glen\r          _____________\r<br>\r<br>          Arnold has Type I insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.   As such,\r<br>\r<br>          he is required to monitor his blood glucose levels throughout the\r<br>\r<br>          day, and give  himself injections of insulin two  to four times a\r<br>\r<br>          day.   He is also required to  pay constant attention to possible\r<br>\r<br>          signs of hypoglycemia,  and to follow a strict  diet and exercise\r<br>\r<br>          regimen to control the disease.  His physician states that Arnold\r<br>\r<br>          would die in  the absence of his insulin injections.   Arnold has\r<br>\r<br>          successfully controlled his diabetes for twenty-three years.\r<br>\r<br>                    In  October, 1995, Arnold  telephoned a human resources\r<br>\r<br>          representative at UPS about applying  for the position of  \"cover\r<br>\r<br>          mechanic.\"  The position called for covering the shifts of night-\r<br>\r<br>          time  mechanics  in four  locations:   Wells,  Maine,  and Dover,\r<br>\r<br>          Laconia, and Twin Mountain, New  Hampshire.  Arnold had worked as\r<br>\r<br>          an  automotive  mechanic  for  six years,  and  had  obtained  an\r<br>\r<br>          associate degree in automotive technology.\r<br>\r<br>                    After the  initial  phone conversation,  Arnold met  in\r<br>\r<br>          person with both the human resources representative for UPS, Paul\r<br>\r<br>          Tanguay, and with  John Kennedy, UPS's  fleet supervisor for  its\r<br>\r<br>          North  New Hampshire division.   By  all accounts,  both meetings\r<br>\r<br>          went well.  As a result, Kennedy indicated to Arnold that the job\r<br>\r<br>          was his if he wanted it.\r<br>\r<br>                    The next day,  Arnold contacted Kennedy, and  said that\r<br>\r<br>          he wanted the job.   The two agreed on an  October 16, 1995 start\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -3-\r                                          3\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          date.   Arnold was informed  shortly thereafter that he  would be\r<br>\r<br>          required to  pass a driving  test, have  his fingerprints  taken,\r<br>\r<br>          fill  out additional  paperwork, and  submit to  a  Department of\r<br>\r<br>          Transportation  (DOT) physical.1   On or about  October 12, 1995,\r<br>\r<br>          Arnold  filled out the  paperwork, was fingerprinted,  and passed\r<br>\r<br>          the  driving  test.   He was  then  sent to  a local  health care\r<br>\r<br>          facility,  Seacoast  Redicare, for  the  DOT  physical.   At  the\r<br>\r<br>          physical,  Arnold, responding to  a question from  the physician,\r<br>\r<br>          indicated  that  he  was  an  insulin-dependent  diabetic.    The\r<br>\r<br>          physician  informed him  that DOT  regulations preclude  insulin-\r<br>\r<br>          dependent diabetics from obtaining the DOT certification required\r<br>\r<br>          to operate commercial motor vehicles.   On return to UPS, Tanguay\r<br>\r<br>          informed Arnold that UPS could not hire him because he was unable\r<br>\r<br>          to obtain DOT certification.   Tanguay instead offered Arnold  an\r<br>\r<br>          alternate position, as  a package \"pre-loader,\" a  position which\r<br>\r<br>          provides substantially lower pay.  Arnold did not respond to this\r<br>\r<br>          alternate job offer.\r<br>\r<br>                    Arnold instituted this action on October 9, 1996 in the\r<br>\r<br>          United States District Court for  the District of Maine under the\r<br>\r<br>          ADA, 42 U.S.C.   12101 et seq., and the Maine Human Rights Act, 5\r                                 _______\r<br>\r<br>          M.R.S.A.   4551 et  seq.  On March 14, 1997,  after discovery had\r                          ________\r<br>\r<br>          been completed, UPS filed a motion for summary judgment.   On May\r<br>\r<br>          5, 1997, Magistrate  Judge David Cohen submitted  his Recommended\r<br>\r<br>          Decision, ruling  in favor  of UPS on  the grounds  that, because\r<br>                              \r          ____________________\r<br>\r<br>          1.

This appeal followed.\r<br>\r<br>                                          I\r                                          I\r<br>\r<br>                    The district court determined that, as a matter of law,\r<br>\r<br>          Arnold was  not disabled within  the meaning of the  ADA, because\r<br>\r<br>          his insulin-dependent  diabetic condition  did not  substantially\r<br>\r<br>          limit one  or more of his  major life activities.2   The district\r<br>\r<br>          court  addressed  the  question  of   substantial  limitation  by\r<br>\r<br>          analyzing   Arnold's  diabetic  condition   after  he   took  his\r                                                      _____\r<br>\r<br>          ameliorative medications, rather than analyzing his unameliorated\r<br>\r<br>          diabetes.   For the reasons  that follow, we think  this analysis\r<br>\r<br>          was erroneous as a matter of law.\r<br>\r<br>                                          A\r                                          A\r<br>\r<br>                    The \"starting point for interpretation of a statute 'is\r<br>\r<br>          the language  of the statute  itself.'\"  Kaiser Aluminum  &amp; Chem.\r                                                   ________________________\r<br>\r<br>          Corp. v.

The very first finding Congress listed in the preamble\r<br>\r<br>          to the Act  is that \"some  43,000,000 Americans have one  or more\r<br>\r<br>          physical or mental disabilities, and this number is increasing as\r<br>\r<br>          the  population  as a  whole  is  growing older.\"    42  U.S.C.  \r<br>\r<br>          12101(a)(1).  It  thus appears that Congress  not only considered\r<br>\r<br>          but actually intended  that the ADA's protections  sweep broadly,\r<br>\r<br>          covering a significant portion of the American populace.\r<br>\r<br>                    One example that demonstrates how UPS's  interpretation\r<br>\r<br>          of  the  statute would  be  inconsistent  with  the  Act's  broad\r<br>\r<br>          remedial  purposes was  pointed out  by  the EEOC  in its  amicus\r<br>\r<br>          brief.   Under UPS's interpretation, someone who could not afford\r<br>\r<br>          treatment for his  impairment would be protected by  the ADA from\r<br>\r<br>          discrimination in  hiring.   But once he  was hired  and obtained\r<br>\r<br>          treatment under  the employer's  health plan,  he would  lose the\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -17-\r                                          17\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          ADA's protection because  he would no longer be  \"disabled.\"  The\r<br>\r<br>          employer  could then  fire him  on  the basis  of his  disability\r<br>\r<br>          without fear of  the protective consequences embodied in the ADA.\r<br>\r<br>          UPS argues that \"[t]his is simply not true; such conduct would be\r<br>\r<br>          the very sort  of situation the 'regarded as'  prong was designed\r<br>\r<br>          to cover.\"  Even if such conduct were covered under prong  three,\r<br>\r<br>          that would not mean  the same conduct is  not also covered  under\r<br>\r<br>          prong  one.

In light of the broad\r<br>\r<br>          remedial purposes of  the ADA,  see Penny,  128 F.3d  at 414,  we\r                                          ___ _____\r<br>\r<br>          believe Congress intended the Act  to prohibit such a termination\r<br>\r<br>          under prong one.  \r<br>\r<br>                    Similarly,  UPS's  reading  would treat  differently  a\r<br>\r<br>          plaintiff  like Arnold (who takes his  medications and thus would\r<br>\r<br>          not be  protected by the ADA,  according to UPS) and  a plaintiff\r<br>\r<br>          who is  also  diabetic (i.e.,  suffering  from the  same  medical\r<br>\r<br>          condition  as  Arnold)  but   who  cannot  afford  to  take   his\r<br>\r<br>          medications.  The latter plaintiff  would be protected by the ADA\r<br>\r<br>          according to UPS's  analysis, but Arnold  would not.   We do  not\r<br>\r<br>          think Congress intended such an anomalous result.\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -18-\r                                          18\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                    Arnold's diabetes makes him just the type of person the\r<br>\r<br>          ADA was designed to protect.  He would have been hired by UPS but\r<br>\r<br>          for his inability to get  a commercial vehicle license, which was\r<br>\r<br>          prevented  only because he  had diabetes (the  underlying medical\r<br>\r<br>          condition, without  taking into account  ameliorative treatment).\r<br>\r<br>          But Arnold alleges  that, with treatment, he can  perform the job\r<br>\r<br>          despite  his impairment if  UPS will reasonably  accommodate him.\r<br>\r<br>          This would ordinarily be a factual question on the merits for the\r<br>\r<br>          court to  determine.   Yet under UPS's  and the  district court's\r<br>\r<br>          interpretation of the ADA, a  person in this archetypal situation\r<br>\r<br>          is not protected from discrimination by the ADA because he is not\r<br>\r<br>          disabled and  hence not  even a proper  plaintiff under  the Act.\r<br>\r<br>          According to UPS, in such  circumstances, the trier of fact never\r<br>\r<br>          gets  to  the  merits  of  the  alleged  discrimination,  of  the\r<br>\r<br>          \"qualified individual\" requirement,or of reasonableaccommodation.\r<br>\r<br>                    UPS's interpretation fails because, by \"confus[ing] the\r<br>\r<br>          disease  with  its  treatment,\"  Matczak  v.

The\r<br>\r<br>          determination  as to  whether  an individual  is \"disabled\"  is a\r<br>\r<br>          threshold  issue;  if  one  is  not disabled,  then  one  is  not\r<br>\r<br>          protected  by the ADA  against discrimination.   See Soileau, 105\r                                                           ___ _______\r<br>\r<br>          F.3d  at 15.  Once  a person is  determined to be  covered by the\r<br>\r<br>          ADA, then that person has a right not to be discriminated against\r<br>\r<br>          in employment  (inter alia)  on the basis  of her  disability, as\r<br>\r<br>          long  as  she is  qualified  for  the  job,  with  or  without  a\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -19-\r                                          19\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          reasonable accommodation.   Were  we to  adopt UPS's  position in\r<br>\r<br>          this  case,  a  plaintiff  would   have  to  prove  that  she  is\r<br>\r<br>          \"substantially limited\" even with  ameliorative medication -- and\r<br>\r<br>          therefore  possibly unable  to  perform  some  of  the  essential\r<br>\r<br>          elements of  the job -- in order just  to be covered by the ADA's\r<br>\r<br>          protective  umbrella.    Thus,  under  UPS's  interpretation, the\r<br>\r<br>          employer  could avoid  liability for discrimination  by excluding\r<br>\r<br>          the  plaintiff  from  the  ADA's  coverage,  without  giving  the\r<br>\r<br>          applicant an  opportunity to show  that she is qualified  for the\r<br>\r<br>          job   (with  or   without  a   reasonable  accommodation),   with\r<br>\r<br>          ameliorative  medication.

UPS\r<br>\r<br>          will have every opportunity to  demonstrate that Arnold is unable\r<br>\r<br>          to perform  one or more  of the essential  functions of the  job.\r<br>\r<br>          Indeed, the  burden will be on  Arnold to demonstrate that  he is\r<br>\r<br>          qualified for the job.  UPS will also be free to try to show that\r<br>\r<br>          any  accommodations  Arnold  needs  would  be  too  expensive  or\r<br>\r<br>          otherwise too burdensome to be considered \"reasonable.\"  But none\r<br>\r<br>          of UPS's  articulated concerns  are applicable  at the  threshold\r<br>\r<br>          stage where  the court is  determining whether the  individual is\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -20-\r                                          20\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          disabled and therefore  protected by the ADA in  the first place.\r<br>\r<br>          Thus,   contrary  to  UPS's  reading,  the  ADA's  definition  of\r<br>\r<br>          \"disability\" is most  consistent with the  broad purposes of  the\r<br>\r<br>          statute if Arnold's impairment and  its effects are evaluated  in\r<br>\r<br>          their  untreated  state,  without  the  ameliorative   effect  of\r<br>\r<br>          medications on his underlying medical condition.7\r<br>\r<br>                    Evaluating the statutory  language of the ADA  in light\r<br>\r<br>          of the legislative history and the broad remedial purposes of the\r<br>\r<br>          Act, we  conclude that  Congress  intended a  reviewing court  to\r<br>\r<br>          evaluate  Arnold's disability  based  on  his underlying  medical\r<br>\r<br>          condition  without  considering the  ameliorative effects  of his\r<br>\r<br>          insulin medication.

UPS's   interpretation  could   very  well   produce  results\r<br>          antithetical to its expressed  concerns and to the  Act's attempt\r<br>          to take  such  concerns  into account.    That a  person  with  a\r<br>          disability  is able  to use  medical  knowledge or  technology to\r<br>          overcome many of the effects of his illness (in Arnold's case, by\r<br>          a continuing regimen of medicine, proper eating habits, and rest)\r<br>          may mean  that he will,  in practice, rarely require  any sort of\r<br>          accommodation from his  employer; but his achievement  should not\r<br>          leave  him  subject  to discrimination  based  on  his underlying\r<br>          disability.   He should not be denied  the protections of the ADA\r<br>          because   he  has   independently   taken   the  initiative   and\r<br>          successfully brought his  diabetes under control.  It  is hard to\r<br>          imagine that Congress wished to provide protection to workers who\r<br>          leave  it to their employer  to accommodate their impairments but\r<br>          to deny protection  to workers who act  independently to overcome\r<br>          their disabilities, thereby creating a disincentive to self-help.\r<br>\r<br>                                         -21-\r                                          21\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          in its  guidelines.

UPS's  argument\r<br>\r<br>          essentially begs the  question.  The key question  is whether the\r<br>\r<br>          statutory  word  \"impairment\"  refers  to  treated  or  untreated\r<br>\r<br>          impairments.  The \"substantially limits\"  requirement pertains to\r<br>\r<br>          the impairment referred to in  the first part of the definitional\r<br>\r<br>          sentence,  regardless of whether that impairment  is read to mean\r<br>\r<br>          the condition in its treated or  untreated state.  Thus, far from\r<br>\r<br>          reading  that  requirement   out  of  the  statute,   the  EEOC's\r<br>\r<br>          interpretive  guideline  helps  to clarify  an  ambiguity  in the\r<br>\r<br>                              \r          ____________________\r<br>\r<br>          9.  UPS itself  relies on  a different section  of the  same EEOC\r<br>          Interpretive Guidance, 29 C.F.R. Part 1630, App.   1630.15(e), in\r<br>          making its  argument that the  district court decision  should be\r<br>          affirmed for a different reason than the court gave.\r<br>\r<br>                                         -24-\r                                          24\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          statute, and places the statutory words \"substantially limits\" in\r<br>\r<br>          proper  relation  to   the  impairment.    The   guideline  reads\r<br>\r<br>          \"substantially limits\"  as referring to the  untreated impairment\r<br>\r<br>          rather than the treated impairment.  The trier of fact must still\r<br>\r<br>          decide whether  the untreated  impairment \"substantially  limits\"\r<br>\r<br>          any  major   life  activity  before   the  untreated   impairment\r<br>\r<br>          constitutes a \"disability\"  within the meaning of the  ADA.  This\r<br>\r<br>          is a  permissible reading  of the  ambiguous statutory  language.\r<br>\r<br>          Id.  Surely,  nothing in the language  of the Act rules  out this\r          ___\r<br>\r<br>          approach.

This\r                                     ______\r<br>\r<br>          claim  is also  meritless.

Arnold  argues that,  even looking  at  his condition  after\r<br>          amelioration,  his impairment substantially limits his ability to\r<br>          engage in a number of major life activities.

(UPS),  alleging that\r<br>\r<br>          UPS  refused  to hire  him  because of  his  disability, diabetes\r<br>\r<br>          mellitus, in  violation of  the Americans  with Disabilities  Act\r<br>\r<br>          (ADA), 42 U.S.C.    12101  et seq.   The  district court  granted\r                                     ______\r<br>\r<br>          summary judgment to UPS, on the ground that Arnold had not  shown\r<br>\r<br>          that  he had a disability and therefore  was not protected by the\r<br>\r<br>          ADA's antidiscrimination provision.  In making its determination,\r<br>\r<br>          the  court considered  Arnold's diabetes  in  its treated  state,\r<br>\r<br>          after taking into account the ameliorative effects of his insulin\r<br>\r<br>          medication.   Arnold appeals, arguing  that such an  analysis was\r<br>\r<br>          legally erroneous, inconsistent  with the ADA and with the EEOC's\r<br>\r<br>          interpretive regulations.   He also argues that the  facts he has\r<br>\r<br>          introduced prove that he satisfies the statutory definition of an\r<br>\r<br>          \"individual  with  a  disability,\" and  that  UPS  has failed  to\r<br>\r<br>          demonstrate that it is  entitled to judgment as a matter  of law.\r<br>\r<br>          UPS  argues  that  the  district  court's  analysis  of  Arnold's\r<br>\r<br>          disability   was   proper,   including   its   consideration   of\r<br>\r<br>          ameliorative  medication.  As an alternative ground for upholding\r<br>\r<br>          the   grant  of  summary  judgment,  UPS  contends  that  federal\r<br>\r<br>          regulations  required  it   to  deny  Arnold's   application  for\r<br>\r<br>          employment, and UPS  is thereby entitled to judgment  as a matter\r<br>\r<br>          of law.  We reverse and remand.\r<br>\r<br>                                        Facts\r                                        Facts\r                                        _____\r<br>\r<br>                    Because this  is  an appeal  from  a grant  of  summary\r<br>\r<br>          judgment in  favor of  defendant UPS, we  state the facts  in the\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -2-\r                                          2\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          light most favorable to the  nonmovant, Arnold.

As such,\r<br>\r<br>          he is required to monitor his blood glucose levels throughout the\r<br>\r<br>          day, and give  himself injections of insulin two  to four times a\r<br>\r<br>          day.   He is also required to  pay constant attention to possible\r<br>\r<br>          signs of hypoglycemia,  and to follow a strict  diet and exercise\r<br>\r<br>          regimen to control the disease.  His physician states that Arnold\r<br>\r<br>          would die in  the absence of his insulin injections.   Arnold has\r<br>\r<br>          successfully controlled his diabetes for twenty-three years.\r<br>\r<br>                    In  October, 1995, Arnold  telephoned a human resources\r<br>\r<br>          representative at UPS about applying  for the position of  \"cover\r<br>\r<br>          mechanic.\"  The position called for covering the shifts of night-\r<br>\r<br>          time  mechanics  in four  locations:   Wells,  Maine,  and Dover,\r<br>\r<br>          Laconia, and Twin Mountain, New  Hampshire.  Arnold had worked as\r<br>\r<br>          an  automotive  mechanic  for  six years,  and  had  obtained  an\r<br>\r<br>          associate degree in automotive technology.\r<br>\r<br>                    After the  initial  phone conversation,  Arnold met  in\r<br>\r<br>          person with both the human resources representative for UPS, Paul\r<br>\r<br>          Tanguay, and with  John Kennedy, UPS's  fleet supervisor for  its\r<br>\r<br>          North  New Hampshire division.   By  all accounts,  both meetings\r<br>\r<br>          went well.  As a result, Kennedy indicated to Arnold that the job\r<br>\r<br>          was his if he wanted it.\r<br>\r<br>                    The next day,  Arnold contacted Kennedy, and  said that\r<br>\r<br>          he wanted the job.   The two agreed on an  October 16, 1995 start\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -3-\r                                          3\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          date.   Arnold was informed  shortly thereafter that he  would be\r<br>\r<br>          required to  pass a driving  test, have  his fingerprints  taken,\r<br>\r<br>          fill  out additional  paperwork, and  submit to  a  Department of\r<br>\r<br>          Transportation  (DOT) physical.1   On or about  October 12, 1995,\r<br>\r<br>          Arnold  filled out the  paperwork, was fingerprinted,  and passed\r<br>\r<br>          the  driving  test.   He was  then  sent to  a local  health care\r<br>\r<br>          facility,  Seacoast  Redicare, for  the  DOT  physical.   At  the\r<br>\r<br>          physical,  Arnold, responding to  a question from  the physician,\r<br>\r<br>          indicated  that  he  was  an  insulin-dependent  diabetic.    The\r<br>\r<br>          physician  informed him  that DOT  regulations preclude  insulin-\r<br>\r<br>          dependent diabetics from obtaining the DOT certification required\r<br>\r<br>          to operate commercial motor vehicles.   On return to UPS, Tanguay\r<br>\r<br>          informed Arnold that UPS could not hire him because he was unable\r<br>\r<br>          to obtain DOT certification.   Tanguay instead offered Arnold  an\r<br>\r<br>          alternate position, as  a package \"pre-loader,\" a  position which\r<br>\r<br>          provides substantially lower pay.  Arnold did not respond to this\r<br>\r<br>          alternate job offer.\r<br>\r<br>                    Arnold instituted this action on October 9, 1996 in the\r<br>\r<br>          United States District Court for  the District of Maine under the\r<br>\r<br>          ADA, 42 U.S.C.   12101 et seq., and the Maine Human Rights Act, 5\r                                 _______\r<br>\r<br>          M.R.S.A.   4551 et  seq.  On March 14, 1997,  after discovery had\r                          ________\r<br>\r<br>          been completed, UPS filed a motion for summary judgment.   On May\r<br>\r<br>          5, 1997, Magistrate  Judge David Cohen submitted  his Recommended\r<br>\r<br>          Decision, ruling  in favor  of UPS on  the grounds  that, because\r<br>                              \r          ____________________\r<br>\r<br>          1.

In UPS's\r<br>\r<br>          words, \"substantially  limits means  substantially limits.\"   But\r<br>\r<br>          this  formulation begs  the  question.   The  ambiguous issue  is\r<br>\r<br>          whether the ADA's  reference to an  \"impairment\" (which might  or\r<br>\r<br>          might not  substantially limit  a major life  activity) means  an\r<br>\r<br>          impairment  without treatment or  an impairment  after treatment.\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -9-\r                                          9\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          The  word  \"impairment\"   could  conceivably  be  read   to  mean\r<br>\r<br>          \"impairment  after  the  underlying  condition  is  treated  with\r<br>\r<br>          ameliorative  therapy,\" which is essentially the way the district\r<br>\r<br>          court  interpreted  it.    Or  the word  could  be  read  to mean\r<br>\r<br>          \"impairment that  results from  the underlying  condition in  the\r<br>\r<br>          absence  of  any ameliorative  treatment,\"  as the  EEOC  and the\r<br>\r<br>          Justice Department have read it.   The statutory language, on its\r<br>\r<br>          face, gives no clue as to which interpretation Congress intended.\r<br>\r<br>          Certainly that language does not plainly and unambiguously refute\r<br>\r<br>          Arnold's  contention that  his  underlying  medical condition  --\r<br>\r<br>          diabetes  mellitus  --   constitutes  an  \"impairment\"  that   is\r<br>\r<br>          protected   by  the  ADA.     Similarly,  \"[a]lthough   the  term\r<br>\r<br>          'substantially  limits' may be  unambiguous in and  of itself, it\r<br>\r<br>          nonetheless does not speak to the issue before [us]; that is, the\r<br>\r<br>          statute is silent as to whether a substantial limitation is to be\r<br>\r<br>          considered  with  or  without  regard  to  mitigating  measures.\"\r<br>\r<br>          Wilson v.

But that  is what Congress\r<br>\r<br>          intended.  The very first finding Congress listed in the preamble\r<br>\r<br>          to the Act  is that \"some  43,000,000 Americans have one  or more\r<br>\r<br>          physical or mental disabilities, and this number is increasing as\r<br>\r<br>          the  population  as a  whole  is  growing older.\"    42  U.S.C.  \r<br>\r<br>          12101(a)(1).  It  thus appears that Congress  not only considered\r<br>\r<br>          but actually intended  that the ADA's protections  sweep broadly,\r<br>\r<br>          covering a significant portion of the American populace.\r<br>\r<br>                    One example that demonstrates how UPS's  interpretation\r<br>\r<br>          of  the  statute would  be  inconsistent  with  the  Act's  broad\r<br>\r<br>          remedial  purposes was  pointed out  by  the EEOC  in its  amicus\r<br>\r<br>          brief.   Under UPS's interpretation, someone who could not afford\r<br>\r<br>          treatment for his  impairment would be protected by  the ADA from\r<br>\r<br>          discrimination in  hiring.   But once he  was hired  and obtained\r<br>\r<br>          treatment under  the employer's  health plan,  he would  lose the\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -17-\r                                          17\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          ADA's protection because  he would no longer be  \"disabled.\"  The\r<br>\r<br>          employer  could then  fire him  on  the basis  of his  disability\r<br>\r<br>          without fear of  the protective consequences embodied in the ADA.\r<br>\r<br>          UPS argues that \"[t]his is simply not true; such conduct would be\r<br>\r<br>          the very sort  of situation the 'regarded as'  prong was designed\r<br>\r<br>          to cover.\"  Even if such conduct were covered under prong  three,\r<br>\r<br>          that would not mean  the same conduct is  not also covered  under\r<br>\r<br>          prong  one.

In light of the broad\r<br>\r<br>          remedial purposes of  the ADA,  see Penny,  128 F.3d  at 414,  we\r                                          ___ _____\r<br>\r<br>          believe Congress intended the Act  to prohibit such a termination\r<br>\r<br>          under prong one.  \r<br>\r<br>                    Similarly,  UPS's  reading  would treat  differently  a\r<br>\r<br>          plaintiff  like Arnold (who takes his  medications and thus would\r<br>\r<br>          not be  protected by the ADA,  according to UPS) and  a plaintiff\r<br>\r<br>          who is  also  diabetic (i.e.,  suffering  from the  same  medical\r<br>\r<br>          condition  as  Arnold)  but   who  cannot  afford  to  take   his\r<br>\r<br>          medications.  The latter plaintiff  would be protected by the ADA\r<br>\r<br>          according to UPS's  analysis, but Arnold  would not.   We do  not\r<br>\r<br>          think Congress intended such an anomalous result.\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -18-\r                                          18\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                    Arnold's diabetes makes him just the type of person the\r<br>\r<br>          ADA was designed to protect.  He would have been hired by UPS but\r<br>\r<br>          for his inability to get  a commercial vehicle license, which was\r<br>\r<br>          prevented  only because he  had diabetes (the  underlying medical\r<br>\r<br>          condition, without  taking into account  ameliorative treatment).\r<br>\r<br>          But Arnold alleges  that, with treatment, he can  perform the job\r<br>\r<br>          despite  his impairment if  UPS will reasonably  accommodate him.\r<br>\r<br>          This would ordinarily be a factual question on the merits for the\r<br>\r<br>          court to  determine.   Yet under UPS's  and the  district court's\r<br>\r<br>          interpretation of the ADA, a  person in this archetypal situation\r<br>\r<br>          is not protected from discrimination by the ADA because he is not\r<br>\r<br>          disabled and  hence not  even a proper  plaintiff under  the Act.\r<br>\r<br>          According to UPS, in such  circumstances, the trier of fact never\r<br>\r<br>          gets  to  the  merits  of  the  alleged  discrimination,  of  the\r<br>\r<br>          \"qualified individual\" requirement,or of reasonableaccommodation.\r<br>\r<br>                    UPS's interpretation fails because, by \"confus[ing] the\r<br>\r<br>          disease  with  its  treatment,\"  Matczak  v.

Once  a person is  determined to be  covered by the\r<br>\r<br>          ADA, then that person has a right not to be discriminated against\r<br>\r<br>          in employment  (inter alia)  on the basis  of her  disability, as\r<br>\r<br>          long  as  she is  qualified  for  the  job,  with  or  without  a\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -19-\r                                          19\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          reasonable accommodation.   Were  we to  adopt UPS's  position in\r<br>\r<br>          this  case,  a  plaintiff  would   have  to  prove  that  she  is\r<br>\r<br>          \"substantially limited\" even with  ameliorative medication -- and\r<br>\r<br>          therefore  possibly unable  to  perform  some  of  the  essential\r<br>\r<br>          elements of  the job -- in order just  to be covered by the ADA's\r<br>\r<br>          protective  umbrella.    Thus,  under  UPS's  interpretation, the\r<br>\r<br>          employer  could avoid  liability for discrimination  by excluding\r<br>\r<br>          the  plaintiff  from  the  ADA's  coverage,  without  giving  the\r<br>\r<br>          applicant an  opportunity to show  that she is qualified  for the\r<br>\r<br>          job   (with  or   without  a   reasonable  accommodation),   with\r<br>\r<br>          ameliorative  medication.

UPS will also be free to try to show that\r<br>\r<br>          any  accommodations  Arnold  needs  would  be  too  expensive  or\r<br>\r<br>          otherwise too burdensome to be considered \"reasonable.\"  But none\r<br>\r<br>          of UPS's  articulated concerns  are applicable  at the  threshold\r<br>\r<br>          stage where  the court is  determining whether the  individual is\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -20-\r                                          20\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          disabled and therefore  protected by the ADA in  the first place.\r<br>\r<br>          Thus,   contrary  to  UPS's  reading,  the  ADA's  definition  of\r<br>\r<br>          \"disability\" is most  consistent with the  broad purposes of  the\r<br>\r<br>          statute if Arnold's impairment and  its effects are evaluated  in\r<br>\r<br>          their  untreated  state,  without  the  ameliorative   effect  of\r<br>\r<br>          medications on his underlying medical condition.7\r<br>\r<br>                    Evaluating the statutory  language of the ADA  in light\r<br>\r<br>          of the legislative history and the broad remedial purposes of the\r<br>\r<br>          Act, we  conclude that  Congress  intended a  reviewing court  to\r<br>\r<br>          evaluate  Arnold's disability  based  on  his underlying  medical\r<br>\r<br>          condition  without  considering the  ameliorative effects  of his\r<br>\r<br>          insulin medication.   The district court erred in  holding to the\r<br>\r<br>          contrary.\r<br>\r<br>                                          E\r                                          E\r<br>\r<br>                    Even if the legislative history were  not clear on this\r<br>\r<br>          point, the  court  also  erred  in  failing  to  afford  adequate\r<br>\r<br>          consideration to the similar interpretation set forth by the EEOC\r<br>\r<br>                              \r          ____________________\r<br>\r<br>          7.  UPS's   interpretation  could   very  well   produce  results\r<br>          antithetical to its expressed  concerns and to the  Act's attempt\r<br>          to take  such  concerns  into account.    That a  person  with  a\r<br>          disability  is able  to use  medical  knowledge or  technology to\r<br>          overcome many of the effects of his illness (in Arnold's case, by\r<br>          a continuing regimen of medicine, proper eating habits, and rest)\r<br>          may mean  that he will,  in practice, rarely require  any sort of\r<br>          accommodation from his  employer; but his achievement  should not\r<br>          leave  him  subject  to discrimination  based  on  his underlying\r<br>          disability.   He should not be denied  the protections of the ADA\r<br>          because   he  has   independently   taken   the  initiative   and\r<br>          successfully brought his  diabetes under control.  It  is hard to\r<br>          imagine that Congress wished to provide protection to workers who\r<br>          leave  it to their employer  to accommodate their impairments but\r<br>          to deny protection  to workers who act  independently to overcome\r<br>          their disabilities, thereby creating a disincentive to self-help.\r<br>\r<br>                                         -21-\r                                          21\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          in its  guidelines.  The  ADA authorizes -- indeed  \"requires\" --\r<br>\r<br>          the EEOC to  \"issue regulations in an accessible  format to carry\r<br>\r<br>          out\"  the  Act.   42 U.S.C.     12116 (1994).   Pursuant  to that\r<br>\r<br>          authority,  the  EEOC has  promulgated  regulations,  attached to\r<br>\r<br>          which as  an appendix it has compiled guidelines for interpreting\r<br>\r<br>          the statute.   According to those guidelines,  the determinations\r<br>\r<br>          of whether  an individual  has an \"impairment\"  and whether  that\r<br>\r<br>          impairment \"substantially limits a major life activity\" should be\r<br>\r<br>          made  \"on a  case by  case  basis, without  regard to  mitigating\r<br>\r<br>          measures  such as medicines, or assistive or prosthetic devices.\"\r<br>\r<br>          EEOC   Interpretive  Guidance,  29  C.F.R.

See  28 C.F.R.\r                                                             ___\r<br>\r<br>          Part 35, App. A    35.104 (\"disability should be assessed without\r<br>\r<br>          regard to the availability of mitigating measures\").\r<br>\r<br>                    Defendant  UPS claims  that  the EEOC's  interpretation\r<br>\r<br>          (and,  inferentially, the Justice  Department's) reads  the words\r<br>\r<br>          \"substantially limits\" out of the statute.   The Eleventh Circuit\r<br>\r<br>          rejected this argument  in Harris v.

UPS's  argument\r<br>\r<br>          essentially begs the  question.  The key question  is whether the\r<br>\r<br>          statutory  word  \"impairment\"  refers  to  treated  or  untreated\r<br>\r<br>          impairments.  The \"substantially limits\"  requirement pertains to\r<br>\r<br>          the impairment referred to in  the first part of the definitional\r<br>\r<br>          sentence,  regardless of whether that impairment  is read to mean\r<br>\r<br>          the condition in its treated or  untreated state.  Thus, far from\r<br>\r<br>          reading  that  requirement   out  of  the  statute,   the  EEOC's\r<br>\r<br>          interpretive  guideline  helps  to clarify  an  ambiguity  in the\r<br>\r<br>                              \r          ____________________\r<br>\r<br>          9.  UPS itself  relies on  a different section  of the  same EEOC\r<br>          Interpretive Guidance, 29 C.F.R. Part 1630, App.   1630.15(e), in\r<br>          making its  argument that the  district court decision  should be\r<br>          affirmed for a different reason than the court gave.\r<br>\r<br>                                         -24-\r                                          24\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          statute, and places the statutory words \"substantially limits\" in\r<br>\r<br>          proper  relation  to   the  impairment.    The   guideline  reads\r<br>\r<br>          \"substantially limits\"  as referring to the  untreated impairment\r<br>\r<br>          rather than the treated impairment.  The trier of fact must still\r<br>\r<br>          decide whether  the untreated  impairment \"substantially  limits\"\r<br>\r<br>          any  major   life  activity  before   the  untreated   impairment\r<br>\r<br>          constitutes a \"disability\"  within the meaning of the  ADA.  This\r<br>\r<br>          is a  permissible reading  of the  ambiguous statutory  language.\r<br>\r<br>          Id.  Surely,  nothing in the language  of the Act rules  out this\r          ___\r<br>\r<br>          approach.   Indeed,  as noted  supra,  at least  with respect  to\r                                         _____\r<br>\r<br>          insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, Congress appears to have had\r<br>\r<br>          such an  interpretation specifically  in mind.

This\r                                     ______\r<br>\r<br>          claim  is also  meritless.

For  example, even\r<br>\r<br>          under UPS's reading  of the statute, virtually  all quadriplegics\r<br>\r<br>          will   probably  be  found   to  qualify  as   \"individuals  with\r<br>\r<br>          disabilities\" under the ADA, but this result does not mean courts\r<br>\r<br>          are  applying  a  per  se  rule  rather  than  an  individualized\r                            _______\r<br>\r<br>          analysis.\r<br>\r<br>                                          F\r                                          F\r<br>\r<br>                    Finally, the  majority of  federal circuit  courts that\r<br>\r<br>          have  considered this issue have followed the EEOC interpretation\r<br>\r<br>          that  ameliorative   measures   should  not   be  considered   in\r<br>\r<br>          determining  whether   an  impairment  substantially   limits  an\r<br>\r<br>          individual's major life activities.
