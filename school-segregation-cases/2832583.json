In this preference\naction under 11 U.S.C. § 547, the bankruptcy court granted summary judgment in favor of the\ndefendant, concluding that the alleged preferential payments had not been property of the debtor\nbecause they were trust funds under Michigan law. For the reasons that follow, the decision will be\nreversed and the proceeding remanded.\n\n                                      I. ISSUES ON APPEAL\n\n        The issues on appeal are:\n(1) whether the defendant in a preference action who claims that it was paid with trust funds under\nthe Michigan Building Contract Fund Act (“MBCFA”) has the burden of tracing the trust funds\nthrough the debtor’s commingled bank account;\n(2) whether the bankruptcy court erred in concluding as a matter of law that monies loaned to the\ndebtor were trust funds under the MBCFA; and\n(3) whether the bankruptcy court erred in ruling that no issues of fact existed regarding whether the\npayments by the debtor to the defendant constituted the property of the debtor under § 547(b) of the\nBankruptcy Code.\n\n                     II. JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n        The Bankruptcy Appellate Panel (“BAP”) has jurisdiction to decide this appeal. The United\nStates District Court for the Western District of Michigan has authorized appeals to the BAP, and\na final order of the bankruptcy court may be appealed by right under 28 U.S.C. § 158(a)(1). An\norder, for the purpose of an appeal, is final if it “ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing\nfor the court to do but execute the judgment.” Midland Asphalt Corp. v. United States, 489 U.S.\n794, 798, 109 S. Ct. 1494, 1497 (1989). The bankruptcy court’s order granting summary judgment\nwas a final order. “An order granting summary judgment is a final order for purposes of appeal.”\n\n                                                   2\n\fWicheff v.

FACTS\n\n       On September 6, 2002, an order for relief under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code was\nentered against R.W. Leet Electric, Inc., an electrical construction contractor (the “Debtor”). On\nAugust 16, 2004, the chapter 7 trustee, Marcia R. Meoli (“Trustee”), commenced the present\nadversary proceeding against Kendall Electric, Inc. (“Kendall”), an electrical materials supplier, to\nrecover as preferential fourteen payments totaling $321,878.49 made by the Debtor to Kendall during\nthe ninety-day preference period. In its answer to the complaint, Kendall generally denied all of the\nstatutory elements of a preference. Additionally, Kendall specifically asserted that the payments it\nhad received from the Debtor had not been property of the Debtor because the monies were trust\n\n\n\n\n                                                  3\n\ffunds under the MBCFA, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. §§ 570.151-.153.1 Thereafter, on February 24,\n2006, Kendall moved for summary judgment on that basis, supported by the affidavit of Judith M.\nGates, the credit manager of Kendall.\n\n       Ms. Gates stated in the affidavit that upon purchasing electrical materials on credit from\nKendall, the Debtor would identify the party/construction contract for whom the materials were to\nbe used, with Kendall then setting up credit lines for the Debtor in the name of the particular party\n(“Job Account”). When the Debtor subsequently paid Kendall for the materials, it would designate\nthe Job Account to which the particular payment should be applied. According to Ms. Gates, all\npayments Kendall received from the Debtor, including those received during the preference period,\nwere applied in accordance with the Debtor’s instructions. Ms. Gates also stated that at the time\neach Job Account was established, the Debtor assured Kendall that it would forward payment to\nKendall as soon as it received payment from the contracting party and that the president of the\nDebtor had informed her that all payments by the Debtor to Kendall during the preference period had\nbeen remitted as the Debtor received payment from the contracting party. Ms. Gates attached to her\naffidavit a copy of the Debtor’s accounts payable ledger that set forth the various payments by the\nDebtor to Kendall and the particular Job Account for which payment was made.\n\n       Kendall’s motion for summary judgment was met with opposition from the Trustee, who\nasserted that genuine issues of material fact existed which precluded summary judgment. The\nTrustee conceded in her responsive brief for purposes of the motion that any monies received by the\nDebtor from its contracting parties were trust funds under the MBCFA. She denied, however, that\nthe Debtor paid Kendall with these monies. It is undisputed that the Debtor did not maintain\nseparate bank accounts for each of its projects; instead, it deposited all customer payments, along\nwith monies from other sources, into one general commercial account. Moreover, the Debtor often\n\n\n       1\n           The Act states, in relevant part, as follows:\n       Sec. 1. In the building construction industry, the building contract fund paid by any person\n       to a contractor, or by such person or contractor to a subcontractor, shall be considered by\n       this act to be a trust fund, for the benefit of the person making the payment, contractors,\n       laborers, subcontractors or materialmen, and the contractor or subcontractor shall be\n       considered the trustee of all funds so paid to him for building construction purposes.\nMich. Com. Laws Ann. § 570.151.\n\n                                                       4\n\fused one check to pay invoices on multiple jobs. Relying on the Debtor’s bank records at Bank One\nand the deposition transcript of a bank employee, the Trustee asserted that the Debtor’s payments\nto Kendall could not be traced back to trust funds received by the Debtor.\n\n       During the preference period, the Debtor made the following payments to Kendall:\n\n\n                   Check           Check Amount        Check Clearing Date\n\n                    19041               $50,462.31           06/10/2002\n                    19044               $20,877.12           06/10/2002\n                    19045                    $22.50          06/10/2002\n                    19068              $168,873.71           06/13/2002\n                    19076               $30,543.16           06/13/2002\n                    19265               $10,299.99           07/08/2002\n                    19266                    $52.06          07/08/2002\n                    19302                 $6,245.77          07/11/2002\n                    19303                   $144.96          07/17/2002\n                    19317               $20,000.00           07/12/2002\n                    19364                 $1,676.77          07/18/2002\n                    19381                 $7,464.52          07/30/2002\n                    19382                     $7.90          07/30/2002\n                    19399                 $5,207.72          07/30/2002\n                    Total              $321,878.49\n\n\n       The Debtor’s accounts payable ledger indicated that the first two payments to Kendall listed\nabove were for a Quincy Schools project and that the third payment was for a Pharmacia job. The\nTrustee argued that the evidence submitted by Kendall in support of its summary judgment motion\nfailed to establish that the owners of these projects had even paid the Debtor and, therefore, summary\njudgment should be denied as to these transfers because Kendall had failed to trace the monies\nreceived by it to trust funds previously received by the Debtor.\n\n\n                                                  5\n\f       With respect to check no. 19068 which was payment to Kendall on a Wal-Mart job, the\nDebtor’s bank records submitted by the Trustee indicated that the Debtor’s total bank deposit on\nJune 10, 2002, was $524,084.04, which included two checks from Wal-Mart totaling $392,749.51.\nOn June 11, the Debtor added to its bank account $200,000 that it had borrowed on its bank line of\ncredit. Also on that day, the Debtor’s funds on deposit were reduced by several checks which\ncleared the bank, including an $893,603.17 payment made by the Debtor on its commercial loan with\nBank One. As a result of all of these transactions, the closing balance in the Debtor’s bank account\non June 11 was $36,255.85. After the addition of deposits from other sources, Debtor’s check no.\n19068 to Kendall in the amount of $168,873.71 cleared the Debtor’s bank account on June 13.\n\n       Citing the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals’ decision in First Federal of Michigan v. Barrow,\n878 F.2d 912 (6th Cir. 1989), the Trustee asserted, “Where trust funds are commingled with other\nfunds in a single account and the balance of that account drops below the amount of the original\ntrust, only the lowest balance of the funds retain the ‘trust fund’ characteristics.” (Trustee’s App.\n0069.) Applying this “lowest intermediate test,” the Trustee argued that only $36,255.85 of the\n$168,873.71 check paid to Kendall could constitute trust funds and, therefore, the balance of the\ntransfer could be avoided as a preference.\n\n       Check no. 19076 in the amount of $30,543.16 to Kendall cleared on June 13, 2002, the same\nday that check no. 19068 for the Wal-Mart job cleared. The Debtor’s account payable ledger\nindicates that check no. 19076 was payment for invoices on at least twenty different jobs. The\nTrustee argued that Kendall had failed to trace payment of this check to trust funds received by the\nDebtor and that, additionally, application of the lowest intermediate balance test would not aid\nKendall since the bank balance of $36,255.85 on that same day was being used to protect part of the\nWal-Mart check from avoidance.\n\n       Lastly, with respect to the nine checks paid to Kendall in July, the Trustee asserted that the\nDebtor’s bank records establish that none of these payments had been made from trust funds, but had\ninstead been paid with funds the Debtor had borrowed from Bank One. More specifically, the\ndeposition testimony of the Bank One employee, Steve Peltz, revealed that immediately prior to the\npayment of these nine checks by the Debtor to Kendall, Bank One and the Debtor had changed the\n\n                                                 6\n\fDebtor’s banking arrangement due to the Debtor’s deteriorating financial condition. Pursuant to a\ndominion of funds agreement, all payments and checks written to the Debtor were deposited by the\nDebtor into a general “pooled” account at Bank One, which the bank swept daily and applied against\nthe line of credit owed by the Debtor to the bank. Subject to loan availability, the Debtor’s\noperations were then funded by new borrowings under the Debtor’s line of credit with the bank. The\nnew funds advanced to the Debtor were placed in a separate controlled disbursement account as\nnecessary to cover checks the Debtor wrote to fund operations, including the July 2002 payments\nto Kendall. As such, the Trustee asserts that Kendall was paid with monies the Debtor borrowed\nfrom Bank One rather than trust funds.\n\n           In a July 11, 2006 bench ruling, the bankruptcy court granted Kendall’s summary judgment\nmotion, concluding as a matter of law that Kendall had been paid with trust funds and, therefore, the\nTrustee would be unable to prove, as required by § 547(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, that the payments\nwere property of the Debtor. According to the court, even if the Debtor had initially used the trust\nfunds to pay down its bank obligation, funds the bank thereafter loaned the Debtor for payment to\nsuppliers regained trust fund status. Although the court did not specifically reference the payments\nto Kendall that did not originate from loaned funds, the court did suggest that any duty to trace must\nbe borne by the Trustee, citing the Trustee’s burden of proof under § 547(g) of the Bankruptcy Code\nand the Debtor’s obligation as a recipient of trust funds to account for the use of such funds, which\nthe court concluded continued post-bankruptcy and became the responsibility of the bankruptcy\ntrustee.\n\n           In accordance with this ruling, the bankruptcy court entered an order on July 13, 2006,\ngranting summary judgment and dismissing the adversary proceeding. After receiving an extension\nof time to appeal, the Trustee timely filed a notice of appeal on August 11, 2006.\n\n                                           IV. DISCUSSION\n\n           Pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 547(b),\n           the trustee may avoid any transfer of an interest of the debtor in property—\n                  (1) to or for the benefit of a creditor;\n\n\n                                                      7\n\f                (2) for or on account of an antecedent debt owed by the debtor before such\n                transfer was made;\n                (3) made while the debtor was insolvent;\n                (4) made—\n                        (A) on or within 90 days before the date of the filing of the petition;\n                        or\n                        (B) between ninety days and one year before the date of the filing of\n                        the petition, if such creditor at the time of such transfer was an\n                        insider; and\n                (5) that enables such creditor to receive more than such creditor would\n                        receive if—\n                        (A) the case were a case under chapter 7 of this title;\n                        (B) the transfer had not been made; and\n                        (C) such creditor received payment of such debt to the extent\n                        provided by the provisions of this title.\n\n        Although the Bankruptcy Code does not define “property of the debtor,” the Supreme Court\nhas found that the term is “best understood as that property that would have been part of the estate\nhad it not been transferred [by the debtor] before the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings.”\nBegier v. IRS, 496 U.S. 53, 58, 110 S. Ct. 2258, 2263 (1990). “In defining ‘an interest of the debtor\nin property’ the Sixth Circuit looks to 11 U.S.C. § 541(a)(1), which provides that the property of the\nestate includes ‘all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of\nthe case.’” Spradlin v. Jarvis (In re Tri-City Turf Club, Inc.), 323 F.3d 439, 443 (6th Cir. 2003)\n(citing Stevenson v. J.C. Bradford & Co. (In re Cannon), 277 F.3d 838, 849 (6th Cir. 2002)). In\naddition, in the absence of controlling federal bankruptcy law, the substantive nature of the debtor’s\nproperty interest is defined by state law. Id.

(In re Maple Mortgage, Inc.), 81 F.3d 592, 596 (5th Cir. 1996)).\n\n\n        Moreover, pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 541(d), “property of the estate” includes all property to\nwhich the debtor holds legal title, except “to the extent of any equitable interest in such property that\nthe debtor does not hold.” “Because the debtor does not own an equitable interest in property he\nholds in trust for another, that interest is not ‘property of the estate.’ Nor is such an equitable interest\n\n                                                     8\n\f‘property of the debtor’ for purposes of § 547(b).” Poss v.

Ct. at 2258)).\n\n        There is no dispute that any monies paid to the Debtor by contracting parties would be held\nin trust by the Debtor and would not constitute its property. Section 570.151 of the MBCFA\nprovides that “[i]n the building construction industry, the building contract fund paid by any person\nto a contractor, or by such person or contractor to a subcontractor, shall be construed by this act to\nbe a trust fund, for the benefit of the person making the payment, contractors, laborers,\nsubcontractors or materialmen . . . .” See Carlisle Cashway, Inc. v. Johnson (In re Johnson), 691\nF.2d 249, 252 (6th Cir. 1982) (“The Michigan Building Contract Fund Act imposes a ‘trust’ upon\nthe building contract fund paid by any person to a contractor or subcontractor . . . .”). The trust under\nthis statute has been expressly recognized by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in the preference\ncontext. See Selby v. Ford Motor Co., 590 F.2d 642, 647 (6th Cir. 1979) (“We . . . believe that\nfederal bankruptcy law should recognize and enforce the property rights created by state law under\nthe Michigan statutory trust.”).\n\n        However, it does not appear that the mere fact that the Debtor may have received trust funds\nis sufficient to insulate the payments to Kendall from avoidance. As argued by the Trustee, it must\nbe established that the payments actually paid to Kendall are traceable to the trust funds received by\nthe Debtor. See Begier, 496 U.S. at 62, 110 S. Ct. at 2258 (recognizing that it is insufficient under\ncommon law to establish that the debtor held funds in trust: it must also be established that the\nalleged preference recipient was paid with trust funds). In Selby, a case decided by the Sixth Circuit\nunder the Bankruptcy Act, the court concluded that payments by a debtor contractor to its\nsubcontractors and by an owner to subcontractors on the contractor’s behalf did not constitute\npreferences because the contractor had no interest in the monies which were impressed with a trust\nunder the MBCFA. Selby, 590 F.2d at 649. Unlike the instant case, there was no indication in Selby\nthat the debtor had placed the trust funds in a commingled account such that tracing was necessary.\nNonetheless, the court’s holding included an explicit recognition of the tracing requirement: “The\nbeneficial interest of subcontractors and materialmen in a building fund should not be regarded as\n\n\n\n\n                                                   9\n\fthe property of the bankrupt debtor, at least so long as the beneficial interests are traceable.” Id.\n(Emphasis supplied.)\n\n        The necessity of tracing was subsequently reiterated by the Sixth Circuit in the First Federal\nof Michigan v. Barrow decision. In that case, the bankruptcy trustee sought to recover as preferential\ncertain payments made by the debtor out of its commingled bank account. First Federal, 878 F.2d\nat 914. The payment recipients defended on the basis that the payments were not property of the\ndebtor because they were funds held in trust by the debtor and argued that tracing was unnecessary.\nId. at 915. The court unequivocally rejected this argument: “It is beyond peradventure that, as a\ngeneral rule, any party seeking to impress a trust upon funds for purposes of exemption from a\nbankruptcy estate must identify the trust fund in its original or substituted form.” Id. (citing Danning\nv. Bozke (In re Bullion Reserve of N. Am.), 836 F.2d 1214 (9th Cir. 1988) (requiring tracing for\nexpress trust where funds had been commingled)). Although First Federal involved a constructive\ntrust, the court’s reasoning for its holding applies with equal force to a statutory trust such as that\ninvolved in the present case, since in both instances trust money, having “no extrinsic identifiable\ncharacteristics of its own,” becomes unidentifiable when it is commingled with a debtor’s non-trust\nmonies in a general account. Id. at 915. See Lovett v. Homrich Inc. (In re Philip Servs. Corp.), 359\nB.R. 616 (Bankr. S.D. Tex. 2006) (recognizing that First Federal rule requiring tracing is equally\napplicable to express or statutory trusts); see also In re Bullion Reserve of N. Am., 836 F.2d at 1218\n(court of appeals noted that even if express trust had existed, preference recipient had “a duty under\nfederal bankruptcy law” to trace trust funds to bullion received by him).\n\n        The tracing requirement was expressly recognized and applied by the bankruptcy court in the\nrecent Philip Services decision, a case on all fours with the facts of the instant case. Based on its\nreview of the law in this area, including the Selby and First Federal decisions, along with cases\nunder Michigan law construing the MBCFA, the Philip Services court concluded that the courts\nconsidering the issue have, with one exception,“universally agree[d] that the trust beneficiary must\nbe able to trace the funds.” In re Philip Servs. Corp., 359 B.R. at 628 (citing Blair v. Trafco Prods.,\nInc., 369 N.W.2d 900 (Mich. App. 1985) (holding that funds were held in trust under the MBCFA\nbecause the claimant had sufficiently traced them through commingled funds); Distral Energy Corp.\n\n\n                                                  10\n\fv. Mich. Boiler & Eng’g Co. (In re Mich. Boiler & Eng’g Co.), 171 B.R. 565 (Bankr. E.D. Mich.\n1993) (concluding that a subcontractor, who asserts that debtor contractor is holding property in trust\nfor its benefit under the MBCFA, must be able to trace the specific funds received by the debtor from\nthe owner to any funds remaining in the debtor’s commingled bank account)); see also Daly v.\nRadulesco (In re Carrozzella & Richardson), 247 B.R. 595, 600-01 (B.A.P. 2d Cir. 2000) (holding\nthat under Connecticut law, a trust beneficiary must trace his property to a particular trust res) (citing\nIn re Faber’s, Inc., 360 F. Supp. 946, 949-50 (D. Conn. 1973) (“noting that even where a ‘trustee\nhas violated a statutory requirement by commingling funds, if the beneficiary cannot identify his\nmoney he will have to take his place at the end of the line behind those favored by the priorities set\nout in the Bankruptcy Act’”)).\n\n        The Philip Services court noted the only case which had not recognized a tracing requirement\nunder similar facts was Imperial Tile, wherein the bankruptcy court held, based on its interpretation\nof Selby, that “trust funds need only be traceable when they are in the custody of the estate as of\nfiling, . . . but that strict tracing is not necessary when the transfers have been completed prepetition.”\nImperial Tile and Carpet, Inc. v. Trustees of the Tile, Terrazzo, Marble and Pre-Cast Panel Workers\nInd. Ins. Fund (In re Imperial Tile and Carpet, Inc.), 94 B.R. 97, 99 (Bankr. W. Mich. 1988). The\nPhilip Services court rightfully rejected Imperial Tile’s reading of Selby: “[I]f ‘an interest of the\ndebtor in property’ means property that would become ‘property of the estate’ [had the transfer not\noccurred], Begier, supra, then it is irrelevant whether the transfer was pre or postpetition.” In re\nPhilip Servs. Corp., 359 B.R. at 628. And, as recognized by the court in Greenwald v. Center Line\nElectric, Inc. (In re Trans-End Technology, Inc.), No. 97-6119, 1998 WL 542331 (Bankr. N.D. Ohio\nJuly 8, 1998), the Imperial Tile decision was rendered prior to the Sixth Circuit’s decision in First\nFederal, wherein the court of appeals made it clear that “‘tracing’ within the context of ‘commingled\nfunds’ was not an issue that was joined, addressed, considered, or discussed in [Selby].” First\nFederal, 878 F.2d at 915.2\n\n\n        2\n         Imperial Tile was also decided prior to the Supreme Court’s decision in Begier. As discussed by\nthe Second Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate Panel in Carrozzella:\n                The Supreme Court, in Begier v. I.R.S., implicitly addressed the question of whether\n                                                                                             (continued...)\n\n                                                    11\n\f        Based on the foregoing cases, we are confident that the law in this area is that tracing is\nnecessary in order to establish that Kendall was actually paid with trust funds. And, even if we had\nthe discretion to rule otherwise—which we do not—we see no reason to do so. “Without a tracing\nrequirement, insolvent trustees who have converted trust assets for their own use would be able to\nchoose, on the eve of bankruptcy, who is to be repaid and who is not. Thus, similarly situated\ncreditors would receive disparate treatment.” In re Carrozzella & Richardson, 247 B.R. at 601.3\n\n        The cited cases also establish that the burden of tracing must be borne by Kendall rather than\nthe Trustee. The bankruptcy court’s contrary ruling in this case was based on the general burden of\nproof that a trustee has under § 547(g)4 of the Bankruptcy Code and on Little v. Little (In re Little),\n\n\n        2\n            (...continued)\n        the receipt of payments from a commingled account constitutes re-segregation thereby\n        relieving the recipient of having to trace its property. 496 U.S. 53, 110 S. Ct. 2258, 110\n        L.Ed.2d 46 (1990). In Begier, the I.R.S. received tax payments from a corporate debtor’s\n        general operating account during the ninety-day preference period. The Court was faced\n        with the question of whether or not the payments to the IRS constituted payments from\n        property of the estate, and thereby recoverable by the trustee, or merely IRS assets being\n        held in trust by the debtor, and thereby unrecoverable by him. The Court ultimately decided\n        that the payments constituted trust assets but, because the trust was created by an act of\n        Congress, it had unique attributes unlike common law trusts. The primary attribute that\n        made the trust unique was that the IRS was not required to trace its property. Significantly,\n        the Court based its holding on its interpretation of 26 U.S.C. § 7501 (1998) and not on the\n        fact that the funds had already been transferred to the IRS. Since such a holding, which\n        involved extensive legislative history analysis, is more complicated than the proposition\n        upon which the Bankruptcy Court made its determination, it is reasonable to conclude that\n        the Supreme Court implicitly rejected the notion that the making of payments from a\n        commingled account affects re-segregation.\nIn re Carrozzella & Richardson, 247 B.R. at 601.\n        3\n           Although no affidavit or other evidence was presented to support this assertion, the Trustee\nsuggests in her reply brief that creditors in this bankruptcy case include materialmen and suppliers who were\nentitled to but did not receive payment from trust funds paid to the Debtor on their behalf. (Trustee’s Rep.\nBr. 3.) (“Kendall was one of the preferred contractors who received payment before the Debtor closed its\ndoors. . . . [Kendall’s] position, and the bankruptcy court’s opinion . . . leaves no recourse for the less\nfortunate contractors who were not paid before the money ran out.”)\n        4\n            Section 547(g) provides:\n        For the purposes of this section, the trustee has the burden of proving the avoidability of a\n                                                                                              (continued...)\n\n                                                     12\n\f163 B.R. 497 (Bankr. E.D. Mich. 1994). Little was a nondischargeability action under 11 U.S.C.\n§ 523(a)(4) against a debtor/contractor who had failed to account for trust funds under the MBCFA.\nThe Little court concluded that because a contractor in possession of trust funds has a duty under\nMichigan law to account to beneficiaries for the disposition of such funds, when the contractor\nbecomes a debtor in bankruptcy it has the burden in a nondischargeability action to prove that no\ndefalcation occurred. Id. at 500-01. The bankruptcy court herein, in what it perceived as a logical\nextension of Little, concluded that a contractor’s duty to account for trust funds becomes the duty\nof its bankruptcy trustee. (Trustee’s App. 0349.)\n\n        Undeniably, a bankruptcy trustee has a duty to collect property of the estate and to be\naccountable for any property collected. See 11 U.S.C. § 704(a)(1) and (2).5 However, there is\nsimply no authority for the conclusion that a trustee bears the burden of establishing a negative: that\na debtor contractor’s commingled general bank account funds are not trust funds or that a preference\ndefendant, paid from a debtor’s general bank account, was paid with non-trust funds. The courts\nconsidering the MBCFA have consistently recognized that a party claiming a trust interest in a\ncontractor’s commingled funds has the burden of identifying or tracing the funds. See Blair v.\nTrafco Prods., Inc., 369 N.W.2d 900, 903 (Mich. App. 1985) (citing Burtnett v. First Nat’l Bank of\nCorunna (38 Mich. 630, 635 (1878)); In re Philip Servs. Corp., 359 B.R. at 628 (“the trust\nbeneficiary must be able to trace the funds”); In re Mich. Boiler & Eng’g Co., 171 B.R. at 569 (party\nclaiming trust fund interest under MBCFA in the debtor’s commingled bank account “must trace the\ntrust funds through the commingled account and it is not enough to simply show that trust funds\n\n\n\n\n        4\n            (...continued)\n        transfer under subsection (b) of this section, and the creditor or party in interest against\n        whom recovery or avoidance is sought has the burden of proving the nonavoidability of a\n        transfer under subsection (c) of this section.\n        5\n          “The trustee shall—\n(1) collect and reduce to money the property of the estate for which such trustee serves, and close such estate\nas expeditiously as is compatible with the best interests of parties in interest; [and]\n(2) be accountable for all property received[.]” 11 U.S.C. § 704(a).\n\n\n\n                                                      13\n\fwent into the commingled account”). Additionally, as the Sixth Circuit recognized in First Federal\nunder Michigan law:\n        Once the trust relationship has been established, one claiming as a cestui que trust\n        thereunder must identify the trust fund or property in the estate, and, if such fund or\n        property has been mingled with the general property of the debtor, sufficiently trace\n        the trust property. If the trust fund or property cannot be identified in its original or\n        substituted form, the cestui becomes merely a general creditor of the estate.\nFirst Federal, 878 F.2d at 915 (quoting Collier on Bankruptcy ¶ 541.13 (15th ed. 1988)) (court\nconcluding that because the defendants had not attempted to trace their trust funds beyond the\ndeposits into the debtor’s commingled bank account, the trust funds “irretrievably lost their\nidentity”).\n\n        The Trustee herein met her burden under § 547(g) of establishing that the transfer was “of\nan interest of the debtor in property” when she introduced evidence that Kendall was paid from the\nDebtor’s general, commingled bank account—an account that was not in any form or fashion\ndesignated as a trust account. See In re Bullion Reserve of N. Am., 836 F.2d at 1217 n.3 (because\npreference recipient received bullion purchased from debtor’s commingled bank accounts under\ndebtor’s control, it was presumed that distribution was property of the debtor; presumption could be\novercome by recipient tracing funds through debtor’s commingled accounts); In re Carrozzella &\nRichardson, 247 B.R. at 602 (finding that once the trustee establishes that the creditor was paid with\nfunds from the debtor’s commingled general account which the debtor used for all manner of\nexpenditures, the burden of proof shifted to the defendant to prove that the debtor only had legal title\nand to trace its interest in the commingled funds). As such, the bankruptcy court erred in holding\nthat the Trustee had failed to present a prima facie case under § 547(b) that Kendall was paid with\nproperty of the Debtor.\n\n        Moreover, it is clear that the tracing in this context involves application of the “lowest\nintermediate balance rule.” As described in First Federal:\n        The situation frequently occurs where trust funds have been traced into a general\n        bank account of the debtor. The following general principles have been applied. The\n        bankruptcy court will follow the trust fund and decree restitution where the amount\n        of the deposit has at all times since the intermingling of funds equaled or exceeded\n        the amount of the trust fund. But where, after the appropriation and mingling, all of\n\n                                                   14\n\f        the moneys are withdrawn, the equity of the cestui is lost, although moneys from\n        other sources are subsequently deposited in the same account. In the intermediate\n        case where the account is reduced to a smaller sum than the trust fund, the latter must\n        be regarded as dissipated, except as to the balance, and funds subsequently added\n        from other sources cannot be subject to the equitable claim of the cestui que trust.\n        If new money is deposited before the balance is reduced, the reduction should be\n        considered to be from the new money and not from monies held in trust. This\n        analysis may be referred to as the lowest intermediate balance test.\nFirst Federal, 878 F.2d at 916 (citing Collier on Bankruptcy ¶ 541.13 (15th ed. 1988)).\n\n        Lastly in this regard, we examine the bankruptcy court’s conclusion that notwithstanding the\nevidence in this case that Kendall in some instances was paid with funds the Debtor borrowed from\nBank One, the monies paid to Kendall were trust funds as a matter of law. The bankruptcy court\ncited no authority for this conclusion other than a policy one, that contractors should not be able to\nstrip trust funds of their status by using them for other purposes. The Trustee argues that the\nbankruptcy court’s conclusion was erroneous because the MBCFA only provides that construction\nfunds paid to a contractor are held in trust and nothing in the Act creates a “skipping” or floating\ntrust such that if the contractor uses the trust funds for another purpose and borrows to replace them\nthe borrowed funds regain trust status.\n\n        In response, Kendall argues that the bankruptcy court’s holding that a contractor is unable\nto strip trust funds under the MBCFA of their status is supported by In re Johnson, 691 F.2d at 249\n(debtor who knowingly used monies in building contract fund for personal use while debt to his\nsupplier remained unpaid had created debt nondischargeable as defalcation by fiduciary); B.R.\nFarnell Company v. Monahan, 141 N.W.2d 58 (Mich. 1966) (holding that a contractor who has not\npaid materialman holds funds received in payment for work performed under contract as trust fund\nfor benefit of materialman and such funds do not constitute part of contractor’s estate); Huizenga\nv. United States, 68 F.3d 139 (6th Cir. 1995) (holding that payments from a building contract fund\nto subcontractors could not be set aside as preferential transfers because the subcontractors held title\nto the money in the building contract fund as trust beneficiaries under the MBCFA); Official\nCommittee of Unsecured Creditors of the IT Group, Inc. v. Anderson Equipment Company (In re IT\nGroup, Inc.), 332 B.R. 673 (Bankr. D. Del. 2005) (holding that payments made under a New York\n\n\n                                                  15\n\flien law were part of a statutory trust and could not be avoided as preferential). These cases,\nhowever, are inapposite to the case at hand. None involved a commingling of trust funds with the\ndebtor’s general funds such that tracing was an issue.\n\n       In the Philip Services decision, rendered after the bankruptcy court herein made its ruling,\nthe bankruptcy court considered facts identical to these in the present case: a preference defendant\npaid with the debtor’s borrowed funds because all of the debtor’s accounts receivable, including trust\nfunds under the MBCFA, had been swept daily by the bank to a zero balance. In re Philip Servs.\nCorp., 359 B.R. at 627. The Philip Services court rejected the defendant’s argument that it had been\npaid with trust funds rather than property of the debtor, observing that neither tracing nor the lowest\nintermediate balance analysis would aid the defendant since it had been paid with borrowed funds.\nId. at 629. Cf. In re Fabricators Supply Co., 292 B.R. 531 (Bankr. D.N.J. 2003) (daily account\nsweep by bank of debtor’s accounts receivable account for application to debtor’s line of credit\nobligation constituted disbursements for which the debtor had to pay quarterly fees to the United\nStates trustee under 28 U.S.C. § 1930(a)(6)).\n\n       The Sixth Circuit does suggest in First Federal that the exact trust funds do not have to be\ntraced from owner to contractor to beneficiary, but that instead the trust funds can be identified in\na “substituted form.” First Federal, 878 F.2d at 915 (“any party seeking to impress a trust upon\nfunds for purposes of exemption from a bankrupt estate must identify the trust fund in its original\nor substituted form”) (citing In re Bullion Reserve of N. Am, 836 F.2d at 1218; Elliott v. Bumb, 356\nF.2d 749, 754 (9th Cir. 1966)). The court of appeals did not explain what is meant by “substituted\nform,” although the Bullion Reserve case cited by the court involved a beneficiary’s investment of\nfunds with the debtor for the purpose of purchasing bullion on the beneficiary’s behalf, with the\ndebtor conveying the bullion to the beneficiary during the preference period. The bankruptcy trustee\nwas able to avoid the transfer of the bullion because the beneficiary was unable to trace the funds\nit paid to the debtor, arguably trust funds, to the bullion ultimately received by the beneficiary. In\nre Bullion Reserve of N. Am, 836 F.2d at 1218.\n\n       On the subject of tracing funds that have changed form, the encyclopedia Corpus Juris\nSecundum states:\n\n                                                  16\n\f               The cestui que trust may follow the trust property through any change in form\n       or species and have the trust attached to the property in its new form; thus, the\n       proceeds which the trustee has received for the trust property may be claimed as\n       subject to the trust.\n                While it has been said that the right to follow and recover trust property first\n       existed only with reference to the identical trust property in its original form, which\n       it was necessary to identify, it is now well settled that the cestui que trust may follow\n       the trust property through any change in form or species and have the trust attached\n       to the property in its new form, for the product of the trust property follows the nature\n       of the original thing itself. Thus, the cestui que trust may generally claim, as subject\n       to the trust, any proceeds which the trustee has received for the trust property, or any\n       property into which the trustee has invested or converted the trust property, or the\n       proceeds thereof, provided, of course, the property claimed may be identified as the\n       product into which the trust property may be traced.\n90A C.J.S. Trusts § 672 (2007) (citations omitted) (emphasis supplied). This passage indicates that\nas long as the trust funds can continue to be traced, notwithstanding a change in form, the cestui que\ntrust follows. Thus, support for Kendall’s argument that the loaned funds were merely a replacement\nof the original trust funds does exist. The facts of First Federal indicate, however, the difficulty,\nif not impossibility, of tracing trust funds through a debtor’s commingled account that includes funds\nfrom multiple sources:\n               [A]ppellants have not attempted to trace their funds beyond the deposits into\n       the commingled Salem Central Account, which evidence, standing alone, is\n       insufficient to support their constructive trust theory of recovery. Since the purported\n       constructive trust consisted of money, which had no extrinsic identifiable\n       characteristics of its own, that was initially deposited and commingled into the Salem\n       Depository Account with unidentifiable funds received from innumerable and diverse\n       other sources and daily redeposited and again commingled in the negative balance\n       Salem Central Account, appellants’ funds irretrievably lost their identity and\n       “tracing” became a futile pursuit as a result of which the controversial payments here\n       in issue became avoidable transfers within the meaning of 11 U.S.C. § 547(b) and\n       550(a). [Citation omitted.]\nFirst Federal, 878 F.2d at 915-16. Additionally, the court of appeal’s discussion of the lowest\nintermediate balance test suggests that merely replacing the funds in a commingled general account\nwith other general funds is insufficient: “[W]here, after the appropriation and mingling, all of the\n\n\n\n\n                                                  17\n\fmoneys are withdrawn, the equity of the cestui is lost, although moneys from other sources are\nsubsequently deposited in the same account.” Id. at 916.6\n\n        Based on the foregoing, we must conclude that the bankruptcy court erred in holding as a\nmatter of law that the funds loaned by Bank One to the Debtor, from which Kendall was paid,\nconstituted Kendall’s trust funds in a substituted form. The cited authorities clearly require the\nbeneficiary to trace the trust funds into their substituted form so a legal conclusion in this regard by\nthe court was inappropriate. Moreover, although not fully developed, the facts of the case suggest\nthat tracing the trust funds into a substituted form of loaned funds would be a near impossibility\nbecause any trust funds received on Kendall’s behalf were commingled with other trust funds and\nthe Debtor’s personal funds in its one general account, such that Kendall’s funds lost their identity.\n\n        Consideration of the arguments and record in this case must be conducted in light of the\nstandards pertaining to a summary judgment motion. Summary judgment is proper when there exists\n“no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of\nlaw.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). “In considering a motion for summary judgment, the [bankruptcy] court\nmust construe the evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.”\nBriscoe v. Fine, 444 F.3d 478, 485 (6th Cir. 2006) (citing Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith\nRadio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 1356 (1986)).\n\n        The only evidence submitted by Kendall in support of its motion was the affidavit of its credit\nmanager, Ms. Gates, and a copy of the Debtor’s accounts payable ledger. This ledger only shows\nthe invoices and Job Account for each check paid by the Debtor to Kendall. It does not establish the\n\n\n\n        6\n           Corpus Juris Secundum does indicate that there is some authority for the proposition that funds\nfrom another source added to a depleted trust fund will be treated as property of the trust fund if “the trustee\nhas added the subsequent sums with the intent of restoring the trust funds, or the circumstances are such that\nthe restoration can be presumed to be of the amounts wrongfully withdrawn.” 90A C.J.S. Trusts § 677\n(citing In re Gottfried Baking Co., 312 F. Supp. 643 (S.D.N.Y. 1970); In re Hackett’s Will, 46 N.Y.S.2d 415\n(Sur. Ct. 1944)). Although we have seen no indication that Michigan courts would agree with this\nproposition, it would appear helpful to a trust beneficiary only if the trust funds remain easily traceable, such\nas where a debtor replaced funds depleted from a single trust account. It would appear to be of limited utility\nwhen applied to a commingled bank account involving multiple trusts and a debtor’s non-trust funds, such\nas in the present case.\n\n                                                       18\n\fsource of the Debtor’s payment. Although Ms. Gates states in her affidavit that the president of the\nDebtor advised her that the Debtor paid Kendall after it received payment from the contracting\nparties, this testimony was insufficient to establish that Kendall was paid with the trust funds since\nKendall was paid from the Debtor’s general account and Kendall failed to conduct the required\ntracing. Summary judgment in favor of Kendall was inappropriate because a genuine issue of\nmaterial fact existed as to whether Kendall was paid with property of the Debtor.\n\n                                        V. CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, the order of the bankruptcy court granting summary judgment in\nKendall’s favor is REVERSED and this adversary proceeding is REMANDED for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 19\n\f",

In this preference\naction under 11 U.S.C. § 547, the bankruptcy court granted summary judgment in favor of the\ndefendant, concluding that the alleged preferential payments had not been property of the debtor\nbecause they were trust funds under Michigan law. For the reasons that follow, the decision will be\nreversed and the proceeding remanded.\n\n                                      I. ISSUES ON APPEAL\n\n        The issues on appeal are:\n(1) whether the defendant in a preference action who claims that it was paid with trust funds under\nthe Michigan Building Contract Fund Act (“MBCFA”) has the burden of tracing the trust funds\nthrough the debtor’s commingled bank account;\n(2) whether the bankruptcy court erred in concluding as a matter of law that monies loaned to the\ndebtor were trust funds under the MBCFA; and\n(3) whether the bankruptcy court erred in ruling that no issues of fact existed regarding whether the\npayments by the debtor to the defendant constituted the property of the debtor under § 547(b) of the\nBankruptcy Code.\n\n                     II. JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n        The Bankruptcy Appellate Panel (“BAP”) has jurisdiction to decide this appeal.

FACTS\n\n       On September 6, 2002, an order for relief under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code was\nentered against R.W. Leet Electric, Inc., an electrical construction contractor (the “Debtor”). On\nAugust 16, 2004, the chapter 7 trustee, Marcia R. Meoli (“Trustee”), commenced the present\nadversary proceeding against Kendall Electric, Inc. (“Kendall”), an electrical materials supplier, to\nrecover as preferential fourteen payments totaling $321,878.49 made by the Debtor to Kendall during\nthe ninety-day preference period. In its answer to the complaint, Kendall generally denied all of the\nstatutory elements of a preference. Additionally, Kendall specifically asserted that the payments it\nhad received from the Debtor had not been property of the Debtor because the monies were trust\n\n\n\n\n                                                  3\n\ffunds under the MBCFA, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. §§ 570.151-.153.1 Thereafter, on February 24,\n2006, Kendall moved for summary judgment on that basis, supported by the affidavit of Judith M.\nGates, the credit manager of Kendall.\n\n       Ms. Gates stated in the affidavit that upon purchasing electrical materials on credit from\nKendall, the Debtor would identify the party/construction contract for whom the materials were to\nbe used, with Kendall then setting up credit lines for the Debtor in the name of the particular party\n(“Job Account”). When the Debtor subsequently paid Kendall for the materials, it would designate\nthe Job Account to which the particular payment should be applied. According to Ms. Gates, all\npayments Kendall received from the Debtor, including those received during the preference period,\nwere applied in accordance with the Debtor’s instructions. Ms. Gates also stated that at the time\neach Job Account was established, the Debtor assured Kendall that it would forward payment to\nKendall as soon as it received payment from the contracting party and that the president of the\nDebtor had informed her that all payments by the Debtor to Kendall during the preference period had\nbeen remitted as the Debtor received payment from the contracting party. Ms. Gates attached to her\naffidavit a copy of the Debtor’s accounts payable ledger that set forth the various payments by the\nDebtor to Kendall and the particular Job Account for which payment was made.\n\n       Kendall’s motion for summary judgment was met with opposition from the Trustee, who\nasserted that genuine issues of material fact existed which precluded summary judgment. The\nTrustee conceded in her responsive brief for purposes of the motion that any monies received by the\nDebtor from its contracting parties were trust funds under the MBCFA. She denied, however, that\nthe Debtor paid Kendall with these monies. It is undisputed that the Debtor did not maintain\nseparate bank accounts for each of its projects; instead, it deposited all customer payments, along\nwith monies from other sources, into one general commercial account. Moreover, the Debtor often\n\n\n       1\n           The Act states, in relevant part, as follows:\n       Sec. 1. In the building construction industry, the building contract fund paid by any person\n       to a contractor, or by such person or contractor to a subcontractor, shall be considered by\n       this act to be a trust fund, for the benefit of the person making the payment, contractors,\n       laborers, subcontractors or materialmen, and the contractor or subcontractor shall be\n       considered the trustee of all funds so paid to him for building construction purposes.\nMich. Com. Laws Ann. § 570.151.\n\n                                                       4\n\fused one check to pay invoices on multiple jobs. Relying on the Debtor’s bank records at Bank One\nand the deposition transcript of a bank employee, the Trustee asserted that the Debtor’s payments\nto Kendall could not be traced back to trust funds received by the Debtor.\n\n       During the preference period, the Debtor made the following payments to Kendall:\n\n\n                   Check           Check Amount        Check Clearing Date\n\n                    19041               $50,462.31           06/10/2002\n                    19044               $20,877.12           06/10/2002\n                    19045                    $22.50          06/10/2002\n                    19068              $168,873.71           06/13/2002\n                    19076               $30,543.16           06/13/2002\n                    19265               $10,299.99           07/08/2002\n                    19266                    $52.06          07/08/2002\n                    19302                 $6,245.77          07/11/2002\n                    19303                   $144.96          07/17/2002\n                    19317               $20,000.00           07/12/2002\n                    19364                 $1,676.77          07/18/2002\n                    19381                 $7,464.52          07/30/2002\n                    19382                     $7.90          07/30/2002\n                    19399                 $5,207.72          07/30/2002\n                    Total              $321,878.49\n\n\n       The Debtor’s accounts payable ledger indicated that the first two payments to Kendall listed\nabove were for a Quincy Schools project and that the third payment was for a Pharmacia job. The\nTrustee argued that the evidence submitted by Kendall in support of its summary judgment motion\nfailed to establish that the owners of these projects had even paid the Debtor and, therefore, summary\njudgment should be denied as to these transfers because Kendall had failed to trace the monies\nreceived by it to trust funds previously received by the Debtor.\n\n\n                                                  5\n\f       With respect to check no. 19068 which was payment to Kendall on a Wal-Mart job, the\nDebtor’s bank records submitted by the Trustee indicated that the Debtor’s total bank deposit on\nJune 10, 2002, was $524,084.04, which included two checks from Wal-Mart totaling $392,749.51.\nOn June 11, the Debtor added to its bank account $200,000 that it had borrowed on its bank line of\ncredit. Also on that day, the Debtor’s funds on deposit were reduced by several checks which\ncleared the bank, including an $893,603.17 payment made by the Debtor on its commercial loan with\nBank One. As a result of all of these transactions, the closing balance in the Debtor’s bank account\non June 11 was $36,255.85. After the addition of deposits from other sources, Debtor’s check no.\n19068 to Kendall in the amount of $168,873.71 cleared the Debtor’s bank account on June 13.\n\n       Citing the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals’ decision in First Federal of Michigan v. Barrow,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">878</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">912</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th Cir. 1989), the Trustee asserted, “Where trust funds are commingled with other\nfunds in a single account and the balance of that account drops below the amount of the original\ntrust, only the lowest balance of the funds retain the ‘trust fund’ characteristics.” (Trustee’s App.\n0069.) Applying this “lowest intermediate test,” the Trustee argued that only $36,255.85 of the\n$168,873.71 check paid to Kendall could constitute trust funds and, therefore, the balance of the\ntransfer could be avoided as a preference.\n\n       Check no. 19076 in the amount of $30,543.16 to Kendall cleared on June 13, 2002, the same\nday that check no. 19068 for the Wal-Mart job cleared. The Debtor’s account payable ledger\nindicates that check no. 19076 was payment for invoices on at least twenty different jobs. The\nTrustee argued that Kendall had failed to trace payment of this check to trust funds received by the\nDebtor and that, additionally, application of the lowest intermediate balance test would not aid\nKendall since the bank balance of $36,255.85 on that same day was being used to protect part of the\nWal-Mart check from avoidance.\n\n       Lastly, with respect to the nine checks paid to Kendall in July, the Trustee asserted that the\nDebtor’s bank records establish that none of these payments had been made from trust funds, but had\ninstead been paid with funds the Debtor had borrowed from Bank One. More specifically, the\ndeposition testimony of the Bank One employee, Steve Peltz, revealed that immediately prior to the\npayment of these nine checks by the Debtor to Kendall, Bank One and the Debtor had changed the\n\n                                                 6\n\fDebtor’s banking arrangement due to the Debtor’s deteriorating financial condition. Pursuant to a\ndominion of funds agreement, all payments and checks written to the Debtor were deposited by the\nDebtor into a general “pooled” account at Bank One, which the bank swept daily and applied against\nthe line of credit owed by the Debtor to the bank. Subject to loan availability, the Debtor’s\noperations were then funded by new borrowings under the Debtor’s line of credit with the bank. The\nnew funds advanced to the Debtor were placed in a separate controlled disbursement account as\nnecessary to cover checks the Debtor wrote to fund operations, including the July 2002 payments\nto Kendall. As such, the Trustee asserts that Kendall was paid with monies the Debtor borrowed\nfrom Bank One rather than trust funds.\n\n           In a July 11, 2006 bench ruling, the bankruptcy court granted Kendall’s summary judgment\nmotion, concluding as a matter of law that Kendall had been paid with trust funds and, therefore, the\nTrustee would be unable to prove, as required by § 547(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, that the payments\nwere property of the Debtor. According to the court, even if the Debtor had initially used the trust\nfunds to pay down its bank obligation, funds the bank thereafter loaned the Debtor for payment to\nsuppliers regained trust fund status. Although the court did not specifically reference the payments\nto Kendall that did not originate from loaned funds, the court did suggest that any duty to trace must\nbe borne by the Trustee, citing the Trustee’s burden of proof under § 547(g) of the Bankruptcy Code\nand the Debtor’s obligation as a recipient of trust funds to account for the use of such funds, which\nthe court concluded continued post-bankruptcy and became the responsibility of the bankruptcy\ntrustee.\n\n           In accordance with this ruling, the bankruptcy court entered an order on July 13, 2006,\ngranting summary judgment and dismissing the adversary proceeding. After receiving an extension\nof time to appeal, the Trustee timely filed a notice of appeal on August 11, 2006.\n\n                                           IV.

Section 570.151 of the MBCFA\nprovides that “[i]n the building construction industry, the building contract fund paid by any person\nto a contractor, or by such person or contractor to a subcontractor, shall be construed by this act to\nbe a trust fund, for the benefit of the person making the payment, contractors, laborers,\nsubcontractors or materialmen . . . .” See Carlisle Cashway, Inc. v.

As argued by the Trustee, it must\nbe established that the payments actually paid to Kendall are traceable to the trust funds received by\nthe Debtor. See Begier, 496 U.S. at 62, 110 S. Ct. at 2258 (recognizing that it is insufficient under\ncommon law to establish that the debtor held funds in trust: it must also be established that the\nalleged preference recipient was paid with trust funds). In Selby, a case decided by the Sixth Circuit\nunder the Bankruptcy Act, the court concluded that payments by a debtor contractor to its\nsubcontractors and by an owner to subcontractors on the contractor’s behalf did not constitute\npreferences because the contractor had no interest in the monies which were impressed with a trust\nunder the MBCFA. Selby, 590 F.2d at 649. Unlike the instant case, there was no indication in Selby\nthat the debtor had placed the trust funds in a commingled account such that tracing was necessary.\nNonetheless, the court’s holding included an explicit recognition of the tracing requirement: “The\nbeneficial interest of subcontractors and materialmen in a building fund should not be regarded as\n\n\n\n\n                                                   9\n\fthe property of the bankrupt debtor, at least so long as the beneficial interests are traceable.” Id.\n(Emphasis supplied.)\n\n        The necessity of tracing was subsequently reiterated by the Sixth Circuit in the First Federal\nof Michigan v. Barrow decision. In that case, the bankruptcy trustee sought to recover as preferential\ncertain payments made by the debtor out of its commingled bank account. First Federal, 878 F.2d\nat 914. The payment recipients defended on the basis that the payments were not property of the\ndebtor because they were funds held in trust by the debtor and argued that tracing was unnecessary.\nId. at 915. The court unequivocally rejected this argument: “It is beyond peradventure that, as a\ngeneral rule, any party seeking to impress a trust upon funds for purposes of exemption from a\nbankruptcy estate must identify the trust fund in its original or substituted form.” Id.

And, even if we had\nthe discretion to rule otherwise—which we do not—we see no reason to do so. “Without a tracing\nrequirement, insolvent trustees who have converted trust assets for their own use would be able to\nchoose, on the eve of bankruptcy, who is to be repaid and who is not. Thus, similarly situated\ncreditors would receive disparate treatment.” In re Carrozzella & Richardson, 247 B.R. at 601.3\n\n        The cited cases also establish that the burden of tracing must be borne by Kendall rather than\nthe Trustee.

In Begier, the I.R.S. received tax payments from a corporate debtor’s\n        general operating account during the ninety-day preference period. The Court was faced\n        with the question of whether or not the payments to the IRS constituted payments from\n        property of the estate, and thereby recoverable by the trustee, or merely IRS assets being\n        held in trust by the debtor, and thereby unrecoverable by him. The Court ultimately decided\n        that the payments constituted trust assets but, because the trust was created by an act of\n        Congress, it had unique attributes unlike common law trusts. The primary attribute that\n        made the trust unique was that the IRS was not required to trace its property. Significantly,\n        the Court based its holding on its interpretation of 26 U.S.C. § 7501 (1998) and not on the\n        fact that the funds had already been transferred to the IRS. Since such a holding, which\n        involved extensive legislative history analysis, is more complicated than the proposition\n        upon which the Bankruptcy Court made its determination, it is reasonable to conclude that\n        the Supreme Court implicitly rejected the notion that the making of payments from a\n        commingled account affects re-segregation.\nIn re Carrozzella & Richardson, 247 B.R. at 601.\n        3\n           Although no affidavit or other evidence was presented to support this assertion, the Trustee\nsuggests in her reply brief that creditors in this bankruptcy case include materialmen and suppliers who were\nentitled to but did not receive payment from trust funds paid to the Debtor on their behalf. (Trustee’s Rep.\nBr. 3.) (“Kendall was one of the preferred contractors who received payment before the Debtor closed its\ndoors. . . .

Little was a nondischargeability action under 11 U.S.C.\n§ 523(a)(4) against a debtor/contractor who had failed to account for trust funds under the MBCFA.\nThe Little court concluded that because a contractor in possession of trust funds has a duty under\nMichigan law to account to beneficiaries for the disposition of such funds, when the contractor\nbecomes a debtor in bankruptcy it has the burden in a nondischargeability action to prove that no\ndefalcation occurred. Id. at 500-01. The bankruptcy court herein, in what it perceived as a logical\nextension of Little, concluded that a contractor’s duty to account for trust funds becomes the duty\nof its bankruptcy trustee. (Trustee’s App. 0349.)\n\n        Undeniably, a bankruptcy trustee has a duty to collect property of the estate and to be\naccountable for any property collected. See 11 U.S.C. § 704(a)(1) and (2).5 However, there is\nsimply no authority for the conclusion that a trustee bears the burden of establishing a negative: that\na debtor contractor’s commingled general bank account funds are not trust funds or that a preference\ndefendant, paid from a debtor’s general bank account, was paid with non-trust funds.

If the trust fund or property cannot be identified in its original or\n        substituted form, the cestui becomes merely a general creditor of the estate.\nFirst Federal, 878 F.2d at 915 (quoting Collier on Bankruptcy ¶ 541.13 (15th ed. 1988)) (court\nconcluding that because the defendants had not attempted to trace their trust funds beyond the\ndeposits into the debtor’s commingled bank account, the trust funds “irretrievably lost their\nidentity”).\n\n        The Trustee herein met her burden under § 547(g) of establishing that the transfer was “of\nan interest of the debtor in property” when she introduced evidence that Kendall was paid from the\nDebtor’s general, commingled bank account—an account that was not in any form or fashion\ndesignated as a trust account. See In re Bullion Reserve of N. Am., 836 F.2d at 1217 n.3 (because\npreference recipient received bullion purchased from debtor’s commingled bank accounts under\ndebtor’s control, it was presumed that distribution was property of the debtor; presumption could be\novercome by recipient tracing funds through debtor’s commingled accounts); In re Carrozzella &\nRichardson, 247 B.R. at 602 (finding that once the trustee establishes that the creditor was paid with\nfunds from the debtor’s commingled general account which the debtor used for all manner of\nexpenditures, the burden of proof shifted to the defendant to prove that the debtor only had legal title\nand to trace its interest in the commingled funds). As such, the bankruptcy court erred in holding\nthat the Trustee had failed to present a prima facie case under § 547(b) that Kendall was paid with\nproperty of the Debtor.\n\n        Moreover, it is clear that the tracing in this context involves application of the “lowest\nintermediate balance rule.” As described in First Federal:\n        The situation frequently occurs where trust funds have been traced into a general\n        bank account of the debtor. The following general principles have been applied. The\n        bankruptcy court will follow the trust fund and decree restitution where the amount\n        of the deposit has at all times since the intermingling of funds equaled or exceeded\n        the amount of the trust fund. But where, after the appropriation and mingling, all of\n\n                                                   14\n\f        the moneys are withdrawn, the equity of the cestui is lost, although moneys from\n        other sources are subsequently deposited in the same account. In the intermediate\n        case where the account is reduced to a smaller sum than the trust fund, the latter must\n        be regarded as dissipated, except as to the balance, and funds subsequently added\n        from other sources cannot be subject to the equitable claim of the cestui que trust.\n        If new money is deposited before the balance is reduced, the reduction should be\n        considered to be from the new money and not from monies held in trust. This\n        analysis may be referred to as the lowest intermediate balance test.\nFirst Federal, 878 F.2d at 916 (citing Collier on Bankruptcy ¶ 541.13 (15th ed. 1988)).\n\n        Lastly in this regard, we examine the bankruptcy court’s conclusion that notwithstanding the\nevidence in this case that Kendall in some instances was paid with funds the Debtor borrowed from\nBank One, the monies paid to Kendall were trust funds as a matter of law. The bankruptcy court\ncited no authority for this conclusion other than a policy one, that contractors should not be able to\nstrip trust funds of their status by using them for other purposes. The Trustee argues that the\nbankruptcy court’s conclusion was erroneous because the MBCFA only provides that construction\nfunds paid to a contractor are held in trust and nothing in the Act creates a “skipping” or floating\ntrust such that if the contractor uses the trust funds for another purpose and borrows to replace them\nthe borrowed funds regain trust status.\n\n        In response, Kendall argues that the bankruptcy court’s holding that a contractor is unable\nto strip trust funds under the MBCFA of their status is supported by In re Johnson, 691 F.2d at 249\n(debtor who knowingly used monies in building contract fund for personal use while debt to his\nsupplier remained unpaid had created debt nondischargeable as defalcation by fiduciary); B.R.\nFarnell Company v.

These cases,\nhowever, are inapposite to the case at hand. None involved a commingling of trust funds with the\ndebtor’s general funds such that tracing was an issue.\n\n       In the Philip Services decision, rendered after the bankruptcy court herein made its ruling,\nthe bankruptcy court considered facts identical to these in the present case: a preference defendant\npaid with the debtor’s borrowed funds because all of the debtor’s accounts receivable, including trust\nfunds under the MBCFA, had been swept daily by the bank to a zero balance. In re Philip Servs.\nCorp., 359 B.R. at 627.

The court of appeals did not explain what is meant by “substituted\nform,” although the Bullion Reserve case cited by the court involved a beneficiary’s investment of\nfunds with the debtor for the purpose of purchasing bullion on the beneficiary’s behalf, with the\ndebtor conveying the bullion to the beneficiary during the preference period. The bankruptcy trustee\nwas able to avoid the transfer of the bullion because the beneficiary was unable to trace the funds\nit paid to the debtor, arguably trust funds, to the bullion ultimately received by the beneficiary. In\nre Bullion Reserve of N. Am, 836 F.2d at 1218.\n\n       On the subject of tracing funds that have changed form, the encyclopedia Corpus Juris\nSecundum states:\n\n                                                  16\n\f               The cestui que trust may follow the trust property through any change in form\n       or species and have the trust attached to the property in its new form; thus, the\n       proceeds which the trustee has received for the trust property may be claimed as\n       subject to the trust.\n                While it has been said that the right to follow and recover trust property first\n       existed only with reference to the identical trust property in its original form, which\n       it was necessary to identify, it is now well settled that the cestui que trust may follow\n       the trust property through any change in form or species and have the trust attached\n       to the property in its new form, for the product of the trust property follows the nature\n       of the original thing itself. Thus, the cestui que trust may generally claim, as subject\n       to the trust, any proceeds which the trustee has received for the trust property, or any\n       property into which the trustee has invested or converted the trust property, or the\n       proceeds thereof, provided, of course, the property claimed may be identified as the\n       product into which the trust property may be traced.\n90A C.J.S. Trusts § 672 (2007) (citations omitted) (emphasis supplied). This passage indicates that\nas long as the trust funds can continue to be traced, notwithstanding a change in form, the cestui que\ntrust follows. Thus, support for Kendall’s argument that the loaned funds were merely a replacement\nof the original trust funds does exist. The facts of First Federal indicate, however, the difficulty,\nif not impossibility, of tracing trust funds through a debtor’s commingled account that includes funds\nfrom multiple sources:\n               [A]ppellants have not attempted to trace their funds beyond the deposits into\n       the commingled Salem Central Account, which evidence, standing alone, is\n       insufficient to support their constructive trust theory of recovery. Since the purported\n       constructive trust consisted of money, which had no extrinsic identifiable\n       characteristics of its own, that was initially deposited and commingled into the Salem\n       Depository Account with unidentifiable funds received from innumerable and diverse\n       other sources and daily redeposited and again commingled in the negative balance\n       Salem Central Account, appellants’ funds irretrievably lost their identity and\n       “tracing” became a futile pursuit as a result of which the controversial payments here\n       in issue became avoidable transfers within the meaning of 11 U.S.C. § 547(b) and\n       550(a). [Citation omitted.]\nFirst Federal, 878 F.2d at 915-16. Additionally, the court of appeal’s discussion of the lowest\nintermediate balance test suggests that merely replacing the funds in a commingled general account\nwith other general funds is insufficient: “[W]here, after the appropriation and mingling, all of the\n\n\n\n\n                                                  17\n\fmoneys are withdrawn, the equity of the cestui is lost, although moneys from other sources are\nsubsequently deposited in the same account.” Id. at 916.6\n\n        Based on the foregoing, we must conclude that the bankruptcy court erred in holding as a\nmatter of law that the funds loaned by Bank One to the Debtor, from which Kendall was paid,\nconstituted Kendall’s trust funds in a substituted form. The cited authorities clearly require the\nbeneficiary to trace the trust funds into their substituted form so a legal conclusion in this regard by\nthe court was inappropriate. Moreover, although not fully developed, the facts of the case suggest\nthat tracing the trust funds into a substituted form of loaned funds would be a near impossibility\nbecause any trust funds received on Kendall’s behalf were commingled with other trust funds and\nthe Debtor’s personal funds in its one general account, such that Kendall’s funds lost their identity.\n\n        Consideration of the arguments and record in this case must be conducted in light of the\nstandards pertaining to a summary judgment motion. Summary judgment is proper when there exists\n“no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of\nlaw.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). “In considering a motion for summary judgment, the [bankruptcy] court\nmust construe the evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.”\nBriscoe v.
