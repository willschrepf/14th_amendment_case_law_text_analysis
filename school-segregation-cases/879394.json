Page 4\n09-1111                     Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\n                                  _________________\n                                      OPINION\n                                  _________________\n\n\n       COLE, Circuit Judge. A student seeking to have her family’s alumni connections\nconsidered in her application to one of Michigan’s esteemed public universities could\ndo one of four things to have the school adopt a legacy-conscious admissions policy: she\ncould lobby the admissions committee, she could petition the leadership of the\nuniversity, she could seek to influence the school’s governing board, or, as a measure of\nlast resort, she could initiate a statewide campaign to alter the state’s constitution. The\nsame cannot be said for a black student seeking the adoption of a constitutionally\npermissible race-conscious admissions policy. That student could do only one thing to\neffect change: she could attempt to amend the Michigan Constitution—a lengthy,\nexpensive, and arduous process—to repeal the consequences of Proposal 2. The\nexistence of such a comparative structural burden undermines the Equal Protection\nClause’s guarantee that all citizens ought to have equal access to the tools of political\nchange. We therefore REVERSE the judgment of the district court on this issue and find\nProposal 2 unconstitutional. We AFFIRM the denial of the University Defendants’\nmotion to be dismissed as parties, and we AFFIRM the grant of the Cantrell Plaintiffs’\nmotion for summary judgment as to Russell.\n\n                                            I.\n\nA. Factual Background\n\n       These appeals are before us as an epilogue to the long-running battle over the use\nof race-conscious admissions policies at Michigan’s public colleges and universities.\nThe saga began during the 1960s and 1970s, when racial minorities first successfully\nlobbied for the adoption of such policies. They remained largely in place until\nchallenges in the late 1990s culminated in the Supreme Court’s decisions in Gratz v.\nBollinger, 539 U.S. 244 (2003), and Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306 (2003), which\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;       Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.              Page 5\n09-1111                       Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nheld that “universities cannot establish quotas for members of certain racial groups” or\ntreat their applications uniquely. Grutter, 539 U.S. at 334. But the Court allowed\nuniversities to continue “consider[ing] race or ethnicity more flexibly as a ‘plus’ factor\nin the context of individualized consideration,” along with other relevant factors, id., a\nholding we do not today address or upset.\n\n         Following these decisions, Ward Connerly, a former University of California\nRegent who had championed a similar proposition in California, and Jennifer Gratz, the\nlead plaintiff in Gratz, mobilized to place on Michigan’s November 2006 statewide\nballot a proposal to amend the Michigan Constitution “to prohibit all sex- and race-based\npreferences in public education, public employment, and public contracting . . . .”\nOperation King’s Dream v. Connerly, 501 F.3d 584, 586 (6th Cir. 2007). The\ninitiative—officially designated Proposal 06-2 but commonly known as “Proposal\n2”—sought “to amend the State Constitution to ban affirmative action programs.” See\nNotice     of   State   Proposals     for   November       7,   2006    General     Election,\nhttp://www.michigan.gov/documents/sos/ED-138_State_Prop_11-06_174276_7.pdf, at\n5 (last visited May 22, 2012). Though Proposal 2 “found its way on the ballot through\nmethods that undermine[d] the integrity and fairness of our democratic processes,”\nOperation King’s Dream, 501 F.3d at 591, once there, it garnered enough support among\nMichigan voters to pass by a margin of 58% to 42%.\n\n         Proposal 2 amended the Michigan Constitution to include the following\nprovisions, entitled “Affirmative action,” in Article I:\n\n         (1) The University of Michigan, Michigan State University, Wayne State\n         University, and any other public college or university, community\n         college, or school district shall not discriminate against, or grant\n         preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race,\n         sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public\n         employment, public education, or public contracting.\n         (2) The state shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment\n         to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or\n         national origin in the operation of public employment, public education,\n         or public contracting.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;      Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.                Page 6\n09-1111                      Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\n        (3) For the purposes of this section “state” includes, but is not necessarily\n        limited to, the state itself, any city, county, any public college, university,\n        or community college, school district, or other political subdivision or\n        governmental instrumentality of or within the State of Michigan not\n        included in sub-section 1.\n\nMich. Const. art. I, § 26. Proposal 2 took effect in December 2006 and wrought two\nsignificant changes to the admissions policies at Michigan’s public colleges and\nuniversities. First, it eliminated the consideration of “race, sex, color, ethnicity, or\nnational origin” in individualized admissions decisions, modifying policies in place for\nnearly a half-century. No other admissions criterion—for example, grades, athletic\nability, geographic diversity, or family alumni connections—suffered the same fate.\nSecond, Proposal 2 entrenched this prohibition at the state constitutional level, thus\npreventing public colleges and universities or their boards from revisiting this\nissue—and only this issue—without repeal or modification of article I, section 26 of the\nMichigan Constitution.\n\nB. Procedural History\n\n        The litigation surrounding Proposal 2 has been lengthy and complex. On\nNovember 8, 2006, the day after Proposal 2 passed, a collection of interest groups and\nindividuals, including the Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, Integration and\nImmigration Rights and Fight for Equality By Any Means Necessary (“Coalition\nPlaintiffs”), filed suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of\nMichigan. They named as defendants then-Governor Jennifer Granholm, the Regents\nof the University of Michigan, the Board of Trustees of Michigan State University, and\nthe Board of Governors of Wayne State University (“University Defendants”), and\nalleged that the provisions of Proposal 2 affecting public colleges and universities\nviolated the United States Constitution and federal statutory law. The Coalition\nPlaintiffs limited their request for relief to Proposal 2 as it applies to public education,\nand did not challenge its constitutionality as it applies to public employment or public\ncontracting. About a month later, the Michigan Attorney General (“Attorney General”)\nfiled a motion to intervene as a defendant, which the district court granted. Shortly\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;     Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.           Page 7\n09-1111                     Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nthereafter, Eric Russell, then an applicant to the University of Michigan Law School, and\nToward A Fair Michigan (“TAFM”), a non-profit corporation formed to ensure\nimplementation of Proposal 2, also filed a motion to intervene in the litigation.\n\n       On December 19, 2006, a group of faculty members and prospective and current\nstudents at the University of Michigan (“Cantrell Plaintiffs”) filed a separate but similar\nsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan against\nGranholm. This lawsuit also limited its challenge to Proposal 2 as it applies to public\neducation.\n\n       That same day, the district court issued what was, in effect, a preliminary\ninjunction, postponing the application of Proposal 2 to the universities’ admissions and\nfinancial-aid policies until July 1, 2007, which was the conclusion of the 2006-2007\nadmissions and financial-aid cycle. The district court’s order stemmed from a stipulation\namong the University Defendants, Coalition Plaintiffs, Granholm, and the Attorney\nGeneral consenting to the injunction. Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action v. Granholm\n(Coal. I), No. 06-15024, 2006 WL 3953321 (E.D. Mich. Dec. 19, 2006). While awaiting\napproval as intervenors, Russell and TAFM opposed the Attorney General’s stipulation\nand sought a stay of the injunction from the district court. When two days passed\nwithout a ruling on their motions, Russell and TAFM filed with us an “Emergency\nMotion for a Stay Pending Appeal,” which we granted. Coal. to Defend Affirmative\nAction v. Granholm (Coal. II), 473 F.3d 237, 253 (6th Cir. 2006), application to vacate\nstay denied, 549 U.S. 1176 (2007). Meanwhile, we approved the district court’s decision\nto allow only Russell to intervene in the Proposal 2 litigation. Coal. to Defend\nAffirmative Action v. Granholm (Coal. III), 501 F.3d 775 (6th Cir. 2007).\n\n       On October 5, 2007, the Cantrell Plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment\nas to Russell, arguing that he should be dismissed from the litigation because he no\nlonger represented an interest distinct from that of the Attorney General. On October 17,\n2007, the University Defendants filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that they were\nnot necessary parties to the litigation. On November 30, 2007, the Attorney General\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;     Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.           Page 8\n09-1111                     Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nfiled a motion to dismiss for lack of standing or, in the alternative, a motion for summary\njudgment on the merits as to all Plaintiffs. Russell and the Cantrell Plaintiffs likewise\nfiled motions for summary judgment the same day.\n\n       On March 18, 2008, the district court issued two orders addressing these motions.\nFirst, the court denied the University Defendants’ request to be dismissed as parties and\nthe Cantrell Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment. Coal. to Defend Affirmative\nAction v. Regents of the Univ. of Mich. (Coal. IV), 539 F. Supp. 2d 924, 941, 950-58\n(E.D. Mich. 2008). The court also granted the Attorney General’s motion for summary\njudgment, rejecting the Plaintiffs’ arguments that Proposal 2 violated the Equal\nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Id. at 960. Second, the court granted\nthe Cantrell Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment, dismissing Russell as an\nintervenor. Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action v. Regents of the Univ. of Mich. (Coal.\nV), 539 F. Supp. 2d 960 (E.D. Mich. 2008). The Cantrell Plaintiffs subsequently moved\nthe court to reconsider the first order, but the court denied the motion. Coal. to Defend\nAffirmative Action v. Regents of the Univ. of Mich. (Coal. VI), 592 F. Supp. 2d 948 (E.D.\nMich. 2008).\n\n       The Plaintiffs, the University Defendants, and Russell appealed these orders to\nthis Court. A panel of this Court reversed the district court’s grant of summary judgment\nin favor of the Attorney General, concluding that the portions of Proposal 2 that affect\nMichigan’s public institutions of higher education impermissibly alter the political\nprocess in violation of the Equal Protection Clause. Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action\nv. Regents of the Univ. of Mich. (Coal. VII), 652 F.3d 607, 631-32 (6th Cir. 2011). This\nCourt also affirmed the district court’s dismissal of Russell and the denial of the\nUniversity Defendants’ motion to be dismissed. The Attorney General then sought en\nbanc review, which we granted, vacating the panel opinion.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;     Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.          Page 9\n09-1111                     Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\n                                            II.\n\nA. Constitutionality of Proposal 2\n\n       The Equal Protection Clause provides that “[n]o state shall . . . deny to any\nperson . . . the equal protection of the laws.” U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The Plaintiffs\nargue that Proposal 2 violates this provision in two distinct ways. Both Plaintiff groups\nargue that Proposal 2 violates the Equal Protection Clause by impermissibly\nrestructuring the political process along racial lines (the “political process” argument),\nand the Coalition Plaintiffs additionally argue that Proposal 2 violates the Equal\nProtection Clause by impermissibly classifying individuals on the basis of race (the\n“traditional” argument).\n\n       In addressing the Plaintiffs’ arguments, we are neither required nor inclined to\nweigh in on the constitutional status or relative merits of race-conscious admissions\npolicies as such. This case does not present us with a second bite at Gratz and\nGrutter—despite the best efforts of the dissenters to take one anyway. This case instead\npresents us with a challenge to the constitutionality of a state amendment that alters the\nprocess by which supporters of permissible race-conscious admissions policies may seek\nto enact those policies. In other words, the sole issue before us is whether Proposal 2\nruns afoul of the constitutional guarantee of equal protection by removing the power of\nuniversity officials to even consider using race as a factor in admissions\ndecisions—something they are specifically allowed to do under Grutter.\n\n       We review de novo a district court’s grant of summary judgment and denial of\na motion for reconsideration of that decision. Chen v. Dow Chem. Co., 580 F.3d 394,\n400 (6th Cir. 2009); Cockrel v. Shelby Cnty. Sch. Dist., 270 F.3d 1036, 1047 (6th Cir.\n2001). Whether a state’s constitution violates the federal constitution is a question of\nlaw, which we also review de novo. Cherry Hill Vineyards, LLC v. Lilly, 553 F.3d 423,\n431 (6th Cir. 2008).\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;     Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.          Page 10\n09-1111                     Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\n        1. Equal Protection Within the Political Process\n\n        The Equal Protection Clause “guarantees racial minorities the right to full\nparticipation in the political life of the community. It is beyond dispute . . . that given\nracial or ethnic groups may not be denied the franchise, or precluded from entering into\nthe political process in a reliable and meaningful manner.” Washington v. Seattle Sch.\nDist. No. 1, 458 U.S. 457, 467 (1982). But the Equal Protection Clause reaches even\nfurther, prohibiting “a political structure that treats all individuals as equals, yet more\nsubtly distorts governmental processes in such a way as to place special burdens on the\nability of minority groups to achieve beneficial legislation.” Id. (internal quotation\nmarks and citation omitted). “[T]he State may no more disadvantage any particular\ngroup by making it more difficult to enact legislation in its behalf than it may dilute any\nperson’s vote or give any group a smaller representation than another of comparable\nsize.” Hunter v. Erickson, 393 U.S. 385, 393 (1969).\n\n        The Supreme Court’s statements in Hunter and Seattle emphasize that equal\nprotection of the laws is more than a guarantee of equal treatment under existing law.\nIt is also a guarantee that minority groups may meaningfully participate in the process\nof creating these laws and the majority may not manipulate the channels of change so\nas to place unique burdens on issues of importance to them. In effect, the political-\nprocess doctrine hews to the unremarkable notion that when two competitors are running\na race, one may not require the other to run twice as far or to scale obstacles not present\nin the first runner’s course. Ensuring the fairness of the political process is particularly\nimportant because an electoral minority is disadvantaged by definition in its attempts to\npass legislation; this is especially true of “discrete and insular minorities,” who face\nunique additional hurdles. Cf. United States v. Carolene Prods. Co., 304 U.S. 144, 152\nn.4 (1938).\n\n        Ensuring a fair political process is nowhere more important than in education.\nEducation is the bedrock of equal opportunity and “the very foundation of good\ncitizenship.” Brown v. Bd. of Educ., 347 U.S. 483, 493 (1954). Safeguarding the\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;      Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.            Page 11\n09-1111                      Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nguarantee “that public institutions are open and available to all segments of American\nsociety, including people of all races and ethnicities, represents a paramount government\nobjective.” Grutter, 539 U.S. at 331-32 (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover,\nuniversities “represent the training ground for a large number of our Nation’s\nleaders. . . . [T]o cultivate a set of leaders with legitimacy in the eyes of the citizenry, it\nis necessary that the path to leadership be visibly open to talented and qualified\nindividuals of every race and ethnicity.” Id. at 332 (citation omitted). Therefore, in the\nhigh-stakes context of education, we must apply the political-process doctrine with the\nutmost rigor.\n\n        Of course, the Constitution does not protect minorities from political defeat:\nPolitics necessarily produces winners and losers. We must therefore have some way to\ndifferentiate between the constitutional and the impermissible. And Hunter and Seattle\nprovide just that. They set the benchmark for when the majority has not only won, but\nhas rigged the game to reproduce its success indefinitely.\n\n                a. Hunter v. Erickson\n\n        In Hunter, the citizens of Akron, Ohio, overturned a fair housing ordinance\nenacted by the City Council. 393 U.S. at 386. But the citizens did more than merely\nrepeal the ordinance; they amended the city charter through a referendum to require the\napproval of an electoral majority before any ordinance regulating real estate “on the\nbasis of race, color, religion, national origin or ancestry”—past or future—could take\neffect. Id. at 387, 390 n.6. In other words, only ordinances based on those factors\nrequired a city-wide majority; ordinances based on any other factor required just a vote\nby the City Council:\n\n        [T]he amendment changed the requirements for the adoption of one type\n        of local legislation: to enact an ordinance barring housing discrimination\n        on the basis of race or religion, proponents had to obtain the approval of\n        the City Council and of a majority of the voters citywide. To enact an\n        ordinance preventing housing discrimination on other grounds, or to\n        enact any other type of housing ordinance, proponents needed the support\n        of only the City Council.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;     Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.        Page 12\n09-1111                     Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nSeattle, 458 U.S. at 468 (describing Hunter). The referendum halted operation of the\nexisting fair housing ordinance, and more importantly for our purposes, erected a barrier\nto any similar ordinance in the future. Hunter, 393 U.S. at 389-90.\n\n       The Supreme Court found that the disparity between the process for enacting a\nfuture fair housing ordinance and the process for enacting any other housing ordinance\n“place[d] special burden[s] on racial minorities within the governmental process” by\nmaking it “substantially more difficult to secure enactment” of legislation that would be\nto their benefit. Id. at 390-91. While the enactment “treat[ed] Negro and white, Jew\nand gentile in an identical manner,” the Court found that “the reality is that the law’s\nimpact falls on the minority.” Id. at 391. That the law had been enacted via a popular\nreferendum did not save it from working “a real, substantial, and invidious denial of the\nequal protection of the laws.” Id. at 393.\n\n               b. Washington v. Seattle School District No. 1\n\n       In Seattle, a case that mirrors the one before us, the Supreme Court applied\nHunter to strike down a state statute, also enacted via a referendum, that prohibited\nracially integrative busing. Seattle, 458 U.S. at 463. Prior to the referendum, Seattle\nSchool District No. 1 (“District”) had implemented a school desegregation plan that\nmade extensive use of mandatory reassignments. Id. at 460-61. The District was under\nno obligation to adopt this plan: following Brown, school boards had been “charged with\nthe affirmative duty to take whatever steps might be necessary” to integrate schools that\nwere unconstitutionally segregated because of racial discrimination, Green v. Cnty. Sch.\nBd., 391 U.S. 430, 437 (1968), but there had been no finding that the de facto\nsegregation in Seattle’s schools was the product of discrimination. Nonetheless, the\nschool board implemented the plan to accelerate its existing program of voluntary\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;           Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.                   Page 13\n09-1111                           Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nbusing, which some constituencies saw as insufficiently alleviating racial imbalances.1\nSeattle, 458 U.S. at 460.\n\n          In response, Seattle residents drafted a statewide measure—known as Initiative\n350—providing in relevant part that “no school board . . . shall directly or indirectly\nrequire any student to attend a school other than the school which is geographically\nnearest or next nearest the student’s place of residence . . . .” Id. at 462 (alteration in\noriginal) (quoting Wash. Rev. Code § 28A.26.010 (1981)). Though the initiative was\nframed as a general ban on mandatory busing, its myriad exceptions made its real effect\nthe elimination of school reassignments for racial purposes only, except where a court\nordered such reassignments to remedy unconstitutional segregation. Id. at 462-63.\nInitiative 350 made it on the Washington ballot and passed by a substantial margin. Id.\nat 463.\n\n          The Court found that Initiative 350, like the Akron city charter amendment,\nviolated the Equal Protection Clause. Id. at 487. The Court stated that its prior cases\nyielded a “simple but central principle”: while “laws structuring political institutions or\nallocating political power according to neutral principles” do not violate the Fourteenth\nAmendment, “a different analysis is required when the State allocates governmental\npower nonneutrally, by explicitly using the racial nature of a decision to determine the\ndecisionmaking process.” Seattle, 458 U.S. at 469-70. Echoing Hunter, the Court\nexplained that this distinct analysis is necessary because non-neutral allocations of power\n“place[] special burdens on racial minorities within the governmental process, thereby\nmaking it more difficult for certain racial and religious minorities than for other\nmembers of the community to achieve legislation that is in their interest.” Id. at 470\n(internal quotation marks, citations, and brackets omitted). The Court dismissed the\n\n\n\n\n          1\n          It bears repeating that the school board took this step in the absence of a court order or any\nunconstitutional discrimination whatsoever. The voluntary plan was an ameliorative measure intended to\nbenefit minority students; it was not a protective measure intended to shield minority students from de jure\ndiscrimination, which no court had found to exist. See Seattle, 458 U.S. at 460-61; see also infra Part\nII.A.3.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;      Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.           Page 14\n09-1111                      Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nargument that Initiative 350 was not intended to prevent busing for racially-integrative\npurposes, and explained why Initiative 350 violated this “simple but central” principle.\n\n        As a threshold matter, the Court concluded that the busing program, like the fair\nhousing ordinance in Hunter, “at bottom inures primarily to the benefit of the minority,\nand is designed for that purpose.” Id. at 472. The Court reasoned that while “white as\nwell as Negro children benefit from exposure to ethnic and racial diversity in the\nclassroom,” desegregation primarily benefits minority children because these children\n“can achieve their full measure of success only if they learn to function in—and are fully\naccepted by—the larger community. Attending an ethnically diverse school may help\naccomplish this goal by preparing minority children for citizenship in our pluralistic\nsociety.” Id. at 472-73 (internal quotation marks omitted). Because racial minorities\nhad reason to “consider busing for integration to be ‘legislation that is in their interest,’”\nthe “racial focus of Initiative 350 . . . suffice[d] to trigger application of the Hunter\ndoctrine.” Id. at 474 (quoting Hunter, 393 U.S. at 395 (Harlan, J., concurring)).\n\n        Having concluded that Initiative 350 targeted a busing program that “inures\nprimarily to the benefit of the minority,” the Court held that “the practical effect of\nInitiative 350 is to work a reallocation of power of the kind condemned in Hunter.” Id.\nAs the Court explained, Initiative 350 did more than merely repeal the busing program:\n\n        The initiative removes the authority to address a racial problem—and\n        only a racial problem—from the existing decisionmaking body, in such\n        a way as to burden minority interests. Those favoring the elimination of\n        de facto school segregation now must seek relief from the state\n        legislature, or from the statewide electorate. Yet authority over all other\n        student assignment decisions, as well as over most other areas of\n        educational policy, remains vested in the local school board. . . . As in\n        Hunter, then, the community’s political mechanisms are modified to\n        place effective decisionmaking authority over a racial issue at a different\n        level of government.\n\nId. By removing authority over busing for racial purposes from the school board and\nplacing it at a more remote level of government, Initiative 350 required “those\nchampioning school integration to surmount a considerably higher hurdle than persons\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;           Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.                    Page 15\n09-1111                           Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nseeking comparable legislative action,” and disadvantaged “those who would benefit\nfrom laws barring de facto desegregation as against those who . . . would otherwise\nregulate student assignment decisions.” Id. at 474-75 (alteration in original) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). Accordingly, the Court held that Initiative 350 violated the\nEqual Protection Clause. Id. at 470.\n\n         In sum, Hunter and Seattle require us to examine an enactment that changes the\ngovernmental decisionmaking process for legislation with a racial focus to determine if\nit improperly manipulates the channels for change.2 Seattle, 458 U.S. at 470, 485;\nHunter, 393 U.S. at 391; cf. Carolene Prods., 304 U.S. at 152 n.4 (noting that more\nexacting judicial scrutiny is required when the majority curtails “the operation of those\npolitical processes ordinarily to be relied upon to protect minorities”). To the extent that\nit does, we must strike down the enactment absent a compelling state interest.\n\n         2. Application of the Hunter/Seattle Test to Proposal 2\n\n         Hunter and Seattle thus expounded the rule that an enactment deprives minority\ngroups of the equal protection of the laws when it: (1) has a racial focus, targeting a\npolicy or program that “inures primarily to the benefit of the minority”; and\n(2) reallocates political power or reorders the decisionmaking process in a way that\nplaces special burdens on a minority group’s ability to achieve its goals through that\nprocess. See Seattle, 458 U.S. at 467, 472; Hunter, 393 U.S. at 391. Applying this rule\nhere, we conclude that Proposal 2 targets a program that “inures primarily to the benefit\nof the minority” and reorders the political process in Michigan in a way that places\nspecial burdens on racial minorities.\n\n\n\n\n         2\n           This holds true for enactments that make it more difficult for minorities to use the political\nprocess to obtain any sort of legislation that is in their interest—notwithstanding whether one characterizes\nsuch legislation as seeking protection against discrimination or, alternatively, preferential treatment. See\ninfra Part II.A.3.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;           Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.                    Page 16\n09-1111                           Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\n                  a. Racial Focus\n\n         The first prong of the Hunter/Seattle test requires us to determine whether\nProposal 2 has a “racial focus.” Seattle, 458 U.S. at 474. This inquiry turns on whether\nthe targeted policy or program, here holistic race-conscious admissions policies at public\ncolleges and universities, “at bottom inures primarily to the benefit of the minority, and\nis designed for that purpose.” Id. at 472. The targeted policy need not be for the sole\nbenefit of minorities, for “it is enough that minorities may consider [the now burdened\npolicy] to be ‘legislation that is in their interest.’” Id. at 474 (quoting Hunter, 393 U.S.\nat 395 (Harlan, J., concurring)).3\n\n         Seattle conclusively answers whether a law targeting policies that seek to\nfacilitate classroom diversity, as Proposal 2 does, has a racial focus. In Seattle, the Court\nobserved that programs intended to promote school diversity and further the education\nof minority children enable these students to “achieve their full measure of success.” Id.\nat 472-73. Such programs do so through “preparing minority children for citizenship in\nour pluralistic society, while . . . teaching members of the racial majority to live in\nharmony and mutual respect with children of minority heritage.” Id. at 473 (internal\nquotation marks and citation omitted). Accordingly, the Court noted that “desegregation\nof the public schools . . . at bottom inures primarily to the benefit of the minority . . . .”\nId. at 472. Because minorities could “consider busing for integration to be ‘legislation\nthat is in their interest,’” the Court concluded that Initiative 350’s effective repeal of\nsuch programs had a racial focus sufficient to “trigger application of the Hunter\ndoctrine.” Id. at 474.\n\n\n\n\n         3\n           The Attorney General contends that Hunter and Seattle not only require that the targeted\nlegislation has a racial focus, but that the new legislation be enacted with discriminatory intent. This\nrequirement has no basis in law. To the contrary, the Supreme Court has explicitly rejected such an\nargument. See Seattle, 458 U.S. at 485 (“We have not insisted on a particularized inquiry into motivation\nin all equal protection cases: ‘A racial classification, regardless of purported motivation, is presumptively\ninvalid and can be upheld only upon an extraordinary justification.’ And legislation of the kind challenged\nin Hunter similarly falls into an inherently suspect category.”) (quoting Personnel Adm’r of Mass. v.\nFeeney, 442 U.S. 256, 272 (1979)).\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;     Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.          Page 17\n09-1111                     Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\n        The logic of the Court’s decision in Seattle applies with equal force here.\nProposal 2 targets race-conscious admissions policies that “promote[] ‘cross-racial\nunderstanding,’ help[] to break down racial stereotypes, and ‘enable[] students to better\nunderstand persons of different races.’” Grutter, 539 U.S. at 330 (alteration omitted)\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Just as an integrative busing program\nis designed to improve racial minorities’ representation at certain public schools, see\nSeattle, 458 U.S. at 461, race-conscious admissions policies are designed to increase\nracial minorities’ representation at institutions of higher education, see, e.g., Grutter,\n539 U.S. at 316, 328-33; Gratz, 539 U.S. at 253-56. There is no material difference\nbetween the enactment in Seattle and Proposal 2, as both targeted policies that benefit\nminorities by enhancing their educational opportunities and promoting classroom\ndiversity. Further, given that racial minorities lobbied for the implementation of the very\npolicies that Proposal 2 permanently eliminates, it is beyond question that Proposal 2\ntargets policies that “minorities may consider . . . [to be] in their interest.” Seattle,\n458 U.S. at 474. Therefore, Proposal 2 has a racial focus because race-conscious\nadmissions policies at Michigan’s public colleges and universities “inure[] primarily to\nthe benefit of the minority, and [are] designed for that purpose.” Id. at 472.\n\n        Seattle not only mandates our conclusion that Proposal 2 is racially focused, but\nit also dispels any notion that the benefit race-conscious admissions policies may confer\non the majority undercuts its “racial focus.”        Although it is true that increased\nrepresentation of racial minorities in higher education benefits all students, see Grutter,\n539 U.S. at 327-33; Seattle, 458 U.S. at 472-73, the Supreme Court has made clear that\nthese policies still have a racial focus. In Seattle, the Court recognized that it is “clear\nthat white as well as Negro children benefit from exposure to ethnic and racial diversity\nin the classroom.” Seattle, 458 U.S. at 472 (internal quotation marks omitted). But the\nSeattle Court found that the wider benefits of the busing plan did not serve to distinguish\nHunter, “for we may fairly assume that members of the racial majority both favored and\nbenefited from Akron’s fair housing ordinance.” Id. By the same token, the wider\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;           Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.                    Page 18\n09-1111                           Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nbenefits of race-conscious admissions policies do not undermine the conclusion that such\nadmissions policies “inure[] primarily to the benefit of the minority . . . .” Id.\n\n         Nor do policy arguments attacking the wisdom of race-conscious admissions\nprograms preclude our finding that these programs “inure[] primarily to the benefit of\nthe minority.” Id. Critics of affirmative action maintain that race-conscious admissions\npolicies actually harm minorities by stigmatizing minority students admitted into high-\ncaliber institutions through a perception that they lack sufficient qualifications; by\nimpeding the academic success of minority students admitted to institutions they are not\nqualified to attend; and by impairing the admissions prospects of traditionally higher-\nperforming minority groups, such as Asian-Americans. But the controversy surrounding\nthe policies that Proposal 2 targets is irrelevant as to whether Proposal 2 itself has a\nracial focus; rather, this controversy is a “matter[] to be resolved through the political\nprocess.” Id. at 474 (“It is undeniable that busing for integration . . . engenders\nconsiderably more controversy than does the sort of fair housing ordinance debated in\nHunter. But in the absence of a constitutional violation, the desirability and efficacy of\nschool desegregation are matters to be resolved through the political process.”). As in\nSeattle, “it is enough that minorities may consider [the repealed policy] to be ‘legislation\nthat is in their interest.’” Id. (quoting Hunter, 393 U.S. at 395 (Harlan, J., concurring)).\n\n         We find that the holistic race-conscious admissions policies now barred by\nProposal 2 inure primarily to the benefit of racial minorities, and that such groups\nconsider these policies to be in their interest. Indeed, we need not look further than the\napproved ballot language—characterizing Proposal 2 as an amendment “to ban\naffirmative action programs”—to confirm that this legislation targets race-conscious\nadmissions policies and, insofar as it prohibits consideration of applicants’ race in\nadmissions decisions, that it has a racial focus.4\n\n         4\n           It is of no consequence that Proposal 2, by its terms, purports to also prohibit preferences based\non sex, color, ethnicity, and national origin. As the primary dissent concedes in a self-defeating footnote,\nthe challenged amendment in Hunter also extended beyond race—covering color, religion, national origin,\nand ancestry as well. Here, as in Hunter, the clear focus of the challenged amendment is race. The history\nof Proposal 2 and its description on the ballot leave little doubt. Moreover, allowing drafters of racially-\nfocused legislation to evade the protections of the Fourteenth Amendment by nominally including more\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;         Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.

A Reordering of the Political Process That Burdens Racial Minorities\n\n        The second prong of the Hunter/Seattle test asks us to determine whether\nProposal 2 reallocates political power or reorders the political process in a way that\nplaces special burdens on racial minorities. See Seattle, 458 U.S. at 467; Hunter,\n393 U.S. at 391. We must first resolve (1) whether the affected admissions procedures\nlie within the “political process,” and then (2) whether Proposal 2 works a “reordering”\nof this political process in a way that imposes “special burdens” on racial minorities.\n\n                          i. Proposal 2’s Effect on a “Political Process”\n\n        The breadth of Proposal 2’s influence on a “political process” turns on the role\nthe popularly elected governing boards of the universities play in setting admissions\nprocedures. The key question is whether the boards had the power to alter the\nuniversities’ admissions policies prior to the enactment of Proposal 2. If the boards had\nthat power and could influence the use (or non-use) of race-conscious admissions\npolicies, then Proposal 2’s stripping of that power works a reordering of the political\nprocess because minorities can no longer seek to enact a type of legislation that is in\ntheir interest at the board level. But if board members lacked such power, because\npolicy decisions are actually under the control of politically unaccountable faculty\nmembers or admissions committees, then Proposal 2’s effect on the political process is\nnegligible.\n\n        This issue—whether the admissions policies affected by Proposal 2 are part of\na “political process”—was the subject of stark disagreement between the majority and\nthe dissent when this case was originally before a three-judge panel, and it continues to\nbe here. In supplemental briefing, the University Defendants clarified their admissions\npractices, undercutting the factual and legal basis of the panel dissent’s core contention\nthat Proposal 2 falls outside the political process. We examine the administrative\n\n\n\n\nthan one class of individuals would seem to elevate form at the expense of substance.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;           Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.                   Page 20\n09-1111                           Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nstructure of Michigan’s public universities and their admissions processes in light of this\nnew information, even though the dissenters choose to look the other way.\n\n         The Michigan Constitution establishes three public universities—the University\nof Michigan, Michigan State University, and Wayne State University—and grants\ncontrol of each to a governing board.5 Mich. Const. art. VIII, § 5; see also id. § 6\n(allowing the establishment of other institutions of higher learning, such as Michigan’s\nother public colleges and universities, and affording their governing boards similar\ncontrol). These boards have the same role: to run, with plenary authority, their\nrespective institutions. Id. art. VIII, §§ 5-6; Glass v. Dudley Paper Co., 112 N.W.2d\n489, 490 (Mich. 1961). Michigan law has consistently confirmed this absolute authority.\nSee, e.g., Glass, 112 N.W.2d at 490; Att’y Gen. ex rel. Cook v. Burhans, 7 N.W.2d 370,\n371 (Mich. 1942); Bd. of Regents of Univ. of Mich. v. Auditor Gen., 132 N.W. 1037,\n1040 (Mich. 1911); 1979-80 Mich. Op. Att’y Gen. 578, 1980 WL 114008, at *1-2\n(Mich. A.G. Jan. 31, 1980). Indeed, the boards are described as “the highest form of\njuristic person known to the law, a constitutional corporation of independent authority,\nwhich, within the scope of its functions, is co-ordinate with and equal to that of the\nlegislature.” Federated Publ’ns, Inc. v. Bd. of Trs. of Mich. State Univ., 594 N.W.2d\n491, 496 n.8 (Mich. 1999) (quoting Bd. of Regents of the Univ. of Mich. v. Auditor Gen.,\n132 N.W. 1037, 1040 (Mich. 1911)).\n\n         Eight popularly elected individuals sit on these boards, and they hold office for\neight years. Mich. Const. art. VIII, § 5; see also id. § 6. The boards have the “power to\nenact ordinances, by-laws and regulations for the government of the university.” Mich.\nComp. Laws § 390.5; see also id. §§ 390.3-.6.6 Exercising this power, the boards have\n\n\n         5\n         At each institution, these boards and their members have slightly differing names—for example,\n“Board of Trustees,” “Board of Governors,” or “Board of Regents.” Mich. Const. art. VIII, § 5.\n         6\n           Though the statutes and bylaws cited in this paragraph govern only the University of Michigan,\nthe boards of the other public colleges and universities in Michigan are similarly empowered. See, e.g.,\nMich. Comp. Laws §§ 390.102-.107 (Michigan State University), 390.641-.645 (Wayne State University).\nFor the sake of clarity, we refer exclusively to the University of Michigan’s bylaws and procedures, as they\nvery closely parallel those in place at other Michigan public educational institutions, such as Wayne State\nUniversity and Michigan State University.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;      Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.           Page 21\n09-1111                      Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nenacted bylaws—which they have complete authority to revise or revoke—detailing\nadmissions procedures. See Univ. of Mich., Bylaws of the Bd. of Regents § 8.01,\navailable at http://www.regents.umich.edu/bylaws (last visited May 22, 2012)\n[hereinafter Univ. of Mich. Bylaws]; Mich. State Univ., Bd. of Trs. Bylaws, art. 4,\navailable at http://www.trustees.msu.edu/bylaws (last visited May 22, 2012); Wayne\nState Univ. Statutes §§ 2.34.09, 2.34.12, available at http://www.bog.wayne.edu/code\n(last visited May 22, 2012).\n\n        The University of Michigan’s bylaws delegate the day-to-day management of\nundergraduate admissions to the associate vice provost and executive director of\nundergraduate admissions. See Univ. of Mich. Bylaws § 8.01. Although the board\ndelegates this responsibility, it continues to exercise ultimate decisionmaking authority\nbecause it directly appoints the associate vice provost and executive director of\nundergraduate admissions, id., and because it retains the power to revoke or alter the\nadmissions framework, id. §§ 14.03, 14.04. Nothing prevents the board from adopting\nan entirely new framework for admissions decisions if it is so inclined. See Mich. Const.\nart. VIII, § 5; Mich. Comp. Laws §§ 390.3-.6; Univ. of Mich. Bylaws § 8.01. Indeed,\nthat the board can revise its bylaws is not a mere theoretical possibility, but a reality that\noccurs with some frequency. Since 2008, the University of Michigan’s Board of\nRegents has revised more than two dozen of its bylaws, two of which fall within Chapter\nVIII, the section regulating admissions practices.\n\n        Of course power in a large university, a vast and highly complex institution, must\nbe delegated. As such, the board fulfills its general supervisory role by conducting\nmonthly public meetings to remain apprised of all university operations and by\nexercising its power to amend bylaws or revise delegations of responsibility. See Univ.\nof Mich. Bylaws §§ 1.01, 14.03. At these meetings, the board regularly discusses\nadmissions practices, including the use of race-conscious admissions policies. See, e.g.,\nUniv. of Mich. Bd. of Regents Proceedings, March 2007, 264-65 (report of Provost to\nBoard of Regents regarding new policies to increase the institution’s diversity in the\nwake of Proposal 2); Univ. of Mich. Bd. of Regents Proceedings, June 2004, 301 (report\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;           Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.                   Page 22\n09-1111                           Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nof University President to Board of Regents regarding undergraduate admissions policies\nin light of Gratz, including efforts to encourage minority applicants); Univ. of Mich. Bd.\nof Regents Proceedings, July 2003, 11 (discussion of the importance of race-conscious\nadmissions policies in light of Grutter, including comments in support of the\nUniversity’s efforts in Grutter from six Regents and the University President), available\nat http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?page=browse&c=umregproc (last visited\nMay 22, 2012). Thus, the elected boards of Michigan’s public universities can, and do,\nchange their respective admissions policies, making the policies themselves part of the\npolitical process.7 But even if they did not, the Attorney General provides no authority\nto support his contention that an unused power is a power abandoned.\n\n         Nevertheless, the Attorney General argues, echoed by the dissenters, that\nadmissions decisions lie outside the political process because the governing boards of\nthe universities have “fully delegated” responsibility for establishing admissions\nstandards to politically unaccountable admissions committees and faculty members. But\nthe Michigan Constitution, state statutes, and the universities’ bylaws and current\npractices directly contradict this argument. Article VIII, section 5 of the Michigan\nConstitution entrusts the board with “general supervision of its institution.” Mich.\nConst. art. VIII, § 5. Michigan statutes §§ 390.3-.5 vest full governing authority in the\nboard, including the power to enact bylaws and regulations to promote and achieve the\nuniversity’s educational mission. See Mich. Comp. Laws §§ 390.3-.5. The University\nof Michigan bylaws unambiguously retain the power to alter or revoke any bylaw,\nincluding any delegation of responsibility. See Univ. of Mich. Bylaws § 14.03. This\nrobust legal authority makes the fact of such delegation irrelevant for our purposes, as\nthe board may revoke the delegation at will.\n\n         Moreover, to the extent the Attorney General and the dissenters express concern\nover the degree to which the board has delegated admissions decisions, that delegation\n\n         7\n           As the Michigan Constitution grants the power to establish other institutions of higher education\nbeyond the three universities named above, see Mich. Const. art. VIII, § 6, to the extent the leadership of\nthese institutions are democratically accountable, whether tangentially or directly, their powers are part\nof the political process.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;      Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.         Page 23\n09-1111                      Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\ndoes not affect whether admissions decisions should be considered part of the political\nprocess. When an elected body delegates power to a non-elected body for the day-to-day\nimplementation of policy, it does not remove the policy from the political process. In\nthe administrative law context, for example, rule-making powers are delegated from the\nPresident to appointed cabinet officials, and as a practical matter, further down to civil\nservice professionals. Regardless of the level at which the rule is drafted, the rule-\nmaking process is at all times under the umbrella of the powers of the President. These\nrules are often the subject of political debate, lobbying, and electioneering, again without\nregard to who actually drafted the particular rule in question. Without question, federal\nrule-making is part of the political process. Similarly, whether it is the board or a\ndelegated body that sets the rules for consideration of race in admissions, these decisions\nfall under the umbrella of the elected board and are thus part of the political process.\n\n        Telling   evidence     that   board    members      can    influence    admissions\npolicies—bringing such policies within the political process—is that these policies can,\nand do, shape the campaigns of candidates seeking election to one of the boards. As the\nboards are popularly elected, citizens concerned with race-conscious admissions policies\nmay lobby for candidates who will act in accordance with their views—whatever they\nare. Board candidates have, and certainly will continue, to include their views on race-\nconscious admissions policies in their platforms. See League of Women Voters, 2005\nGeneral Election Voter Guide, available at http://www.lwvka.org/guide04/regents/html\n(last visited May 22, 2012) (noting that a candidate for the Board of Regents pledged to\n“work to end so-called ‘Affirmative-Action,’ a racist, degrading system”). Indeed,\nnothing prevents Michigan citizens from electing a slate of regents who promise to\nreview admissions policies based on their opposition to affirmative action. Once elected,\nthe new slate may revise the bylaws, see Univ. of Mich. Bylaws § 14.03, and change\ntheir university’s admissions policies—either by entirely revoking the delegation and\nhandling all admissions policies at the board level or by enacting new bylaws giving\nmore explicit direction to admissions committees. Thus, Proposal 2 affects a “political\nprocess.”\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;      Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.           Page 24\n09-1111                      Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\n                        ii. Reordering of a “Political Process”\n\n        The next issue is whether Proposal 2 reordered the political process in a way that\nplaces special burdens on racial minorities. The Supreme Court has found that both\nimplicit and explicit reordering violates the Fourteenth Amendment. See Seattle,\n458 U.S. at 474; Hunter, 393 U.S. at 387, 390. In Hunter, the express language of the\ncharter amendment required any ordinance regulating real estate “on the basis of race,\ncolor, religion, national origin or ancestry” to be approved by a majority of the electorate\nand the City Council, as opposed to solely the City Council for other real-estate\nordinances. 393 U.S. at 387, 390. This reallocation of power was directly written into\nthe charter amendment, creating “in effect . . . an ‘explicitly racial classification treating\nracial housing matters differently’” from all other housing matters. Seattle, 458 U.S. at\n468 (quoting Hunter, 393 U.S. at 389).\n\n        In Seattle, however, the reordering was implicit: On its face, Initiative 350 simply\nprohibited school boards from using mandatory busing, but its practical effect was to\nforce “[t]hose favoring the elimination of de facto school segregation” to “seek relief\nfrom the state legislature, or from the statewide electorate” in order to overturn Initiative\n350.    Id. at 474.     Nonetheless, “authority over all other student assignment\ndecisions . . . remain[ed] vested in the local school board.” Id. Whereas a proponent of\nsmaller class sizes could seek redress at the local level, a proponent of integrative busing\nhad to scale the more onerous hurdle of a successful statewide campaign. The Seattle\nlegislation implicitly reallocated power because the “initiative remove[d] the authority\nto address a racial problem—and only a racial problem—from the existing\ndecisionmaking body . . . .” Id. Similar to the amendment in Hunter, Initiative 350\nmodified “the community’s political mechanisms . . . to place effective decisionmaking\nauthority over a racial issue at a different level of government.” Id.\n\n        The Seattle Court then clarified what sort of reordering contravenes the political-\nprocess doctrine: “[t]he evil condemned by the Hunter Court was not the particular\npolitical obstacle of mandatory referenda imposed by the Akron charter amendment; it\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;     Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.         Page 25\n09-1111                     Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nwas, rather, the comparative structural burden placed on the political achievement of\nminority interests.” Id. at 474 n.17 (emphasis added). In both Hunter and Seattle, “the\neffect of the challenged action was to redraw decisionmaking authority over racial\nmatters—and only over racial matters—in such a way as to place comparative burdens\non minorities.” Id. (emphasis added). Thus, any “comparative structural burden,” be it\nlocal or statewide or national, satisfies the reordering prong of the Hunter/Seattle test.\nId.\n\n       The comparative structural burden we face here is every bit as troubling as those\nin Hunter and Seattle because Proposal 2 creates the highest possible hurdle. This\ncomparative structural burden is most apparent in tracing the channels for change\navailable to a citizen promoting any policy unmodified by Proposal 2 and those available\nto a citizen promoting constitutionally permissible race-conscious admissions policies.\n\n       An interested Michigan citizen may use any number of avenues to change the\nadmissions policies on an issue outside the scope of Proposal 2. For instance, a citizen\ninterested in admissions policies benefitting legacy applicants—sons and daughters of\nalumni of the university—may lobby the admissions committees directly, through\nwritten or in-person communication. He may petition higher administrative authorities\nat the university, such as the dean of admissions, the president of the university, or the\nuniversity’s board. He may seek to affect the election—through voting, campaigning,\nor other means—of any one of the eight board members whom the individual believes\nwill champion his cause and revise admissions policies accordingly. And he may\ncampaign for an amendment to the Michigan Constitution.\n\n       Each of these methods, respectively, becomes more expensive, lengthy, and\ncomplex. Because Proposal 2 entrenched the ban on all race-conscious admissions\npolicies at the highest level, this last resort—the campaign for a constitutional\namendment—is the sole recourse available to a Michigan citizen who supports enacting\nsuch policies. That citizen must now begin by convincing the Michigan electorate to\namend its constitution—an extraordinarily expensive process and the most arduous of\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;     Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.        Page 26\n09-1111                     Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nall the possible channels for change. Just to place a proposed constitutional amendment\nrepealing Proposal 2 on the ballot would require either the support of two-thirds of both\nthe Michigan House of Representatives and Senate, see Mich. Const. art. XII, § 1, or the\nsignatures of a number of voters equivalent to at least ten percent of the number of votes\ncast for all candidates for governor in the preceding general election, see id. art. XII,\n§ 2. Once on the ballot, the proposed amendment must then earn the support of a\nmajority of the voting electorate to undo Proposal 2’s categorical ban. See id. art. XII,\n§§ 1-2.\n\n          Only after traversing this difficult and costly road would our now-exhausted\ncitizen reach the starting point of his neighbor who sought a legacy-related admissions\npolicy change. After this successful constitutional amendment campaign, the citizen\ncould finally approach the university—by petitioning the admissions committees or\nhigher administrative authorities—to request the adoption of race-conscious admissions\npolicies. By amending the Michigan Constitution to prohibit university admissions units\nfrom using even modest race-conscious admissions policies, Proposal 2 thus removed\nthe authority to institute any such policy from Michigan’s universities and lodged it at\nthe most remote level of Michigan’s government, the state constitution. As with the\nunconstitutional enactment in Hunter, proponents of race-conscious admissions policies\nnow have to obtain the approval of the Michigan electorate and, if successful,\nadmissions units or other university powers—whereas proponents of other non-universal\nadmissions factors need only garner the support of the latter. See Seattle, 458 U.S. at\n468, 474.\n\n          The “simple but central principle” of Hunter and Seattle is that the Equal\nProtection Clause prohibits requiring racial minorities to surmount more formidable\nobstacles than those faced by other groups to achieve their political objectives. See id.\nat 469-70. A state may not “allocate[] governmental power nonneutrally, by explicitly\nusing the racial nature of a decision to determine the decisionmaking process.” Id. at\n470. As the Supreme Court has recognized, such special procedural barriers to minority\ninterests discriminate against racial minorities just as surely as—and more insidiously\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;     Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.         Page 27\n09-1111                     Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nthan—substantive legal barriers challenged under the traditional equal protection rubric.\nSee id. at 467 (“[T]he Fourteenth Amendment also reaches a political structure that treats\nall individuals as equals, yet more subtly distorts governmental processes in such a way\nas to place special burdens on the ability of minority groups to achieve beneficial\nlegislation.”) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Because less onerous\navenues to effect political change remain open to those advocating consideration of non-\nracial factors in admissions decisions, Michigan cannot force those advocating for\nconsideration of racial factors to traverse a more arduous road without violating the\nFourteenth Amendment. We thus conclude that Proposal 2 reorders the political process\nin Michigan to place special burdens on minority interests.\n\n       3. Objections to the Applicability of the Hunter/Seattle Doctrine to Proposal 2\n\n       The Attorney General and the dissenters make a number of arguments as to why\nProposal 2 survives constitutional scrutiny. At the outset, it should be noted that\nadopting these arguments as to Proposal 2’s constitutionality would be particularly\nironic, given that these arguments applied with equal force to Initiative 350 in Seattle.\nWhile distinctions obviously exist between the policy at issue here and that in Seattle,\nthe factual differences are not so material as to justify departure from relevant Supreme\nCourt precedent.\n\n               a. Hunter/Seattle Doctrine and Preferential Treatment Programs\n\n       The Attorney General and the dissenters assert that Hunter and Seattle are\ninapplicable to Proposal 2 because those cases only govern enactments that burden racial\nminorities’ ability to obtain protection from discrimination through the political process,\nwhereas Proposal 2 burdens racial minorities’ ability to obtain preferential treatment.\nAt bottom, this is an argument that an enactment violates the Equal Protection Clause\nunder Hunter and Seattle only if the political process is distorted to burden legislation\nproviding constitutionally-mandated protections, such as anti-discrimination laws.\nUnder this theory, a state may require racial minorities to endure a more burdensome\nprocess than all other citizens when seeking to enact policies that are in their favor if\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;          Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.                    Page 28\n09-1111                          Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nthose policies are constitutionally permissible but not constitutionally required. This\neffort to drive a wedge between the political-process rights afforded when seeking anti-\ndiscrimination legislation and so-called preferential treatment is fundamentally at odds\nwith Seattle.\n\n         The only way to find the Hunter/Seattle doctrine inapplicable to the enactment\nof preferential treatment is to adopt a strained reading that ignores the preferential nature\nof the legislation at issue in Seattle, and inaccurately recast it as anti-discrimination\nlegislation. Initiative 350 prohibited the voluntary busing of students to correct de facto\nsegregation. 458 U.S. at 460-61. The school board was under no obligation to undertake\nthis effort because there had been no finding that the District’s segregation was the result\nof intentional racial discrimination. Id. at 491-92 (Powell, J., dissenting) (“The Court\nhas never held that there is an affirmative duty to integrate the schools in the absence of\na finding of unconstitutional segregation. Certainly there is no constitutional duty to\nadopt mandatory busing in the absence of such a violation.”) (internal citations omitted).\nAs such, the District’s plan was an ameliorative measure and not a response to\ndiscrimination. It is therefore inaccurate to suggest that Initiative 350 affected anti-\ndiscrimination legislation by making it more difficult for minorities to obtain protection\nfrom discrimination through the political process. Quite the contrary: as the district\ncourt recognized, “[b]ecause prohibiting integration (when it is not constitutionally\nmandated) is not tantamount to discrimination . . . the Court in Seattle did not (and could\nnot) rely on the notion that the restructuring at issue impeded efforts to secure equal\ntreatment.”8 Coal. VI, 592 F. Supp. 2d at 951. Therefore, in applying the Hunter\n\n\n         8\n           In holding that Proposal 2 nonetheless does not violate the Equal Protection Clause, the district\ncourt asserted that the race-conscious admissions policies at issue here should be distinguished from the\nvoluntary busing program at issue in Seattle because, unlike race-conscious admissions policies, “school\ndesegregation programs are not inherently invidious, do not work wholly to the benefit of certain members\nof one group and correspondingly to the harm of certain members of another group, and do not deprive\ncitizens of rights.” Coal. VI, 592 F. Supp. 2d at 951 (quoting Coal. for Econ. Equity v. Wilson, 122 F.3d\n692, 707 n.16 (9th Cir. 1997)). The district court erred in this respect.\n          Indeed, such a distinction is incompatible with the Supreme Court’s decision in Grutter, and for\nthis reason, we decline to follow Coalition for Economic Equity v. Wilson, 122 F.3d 692 (9th Cir. 1997),\nas the district court did. In Grutter, the Supreme Court showed how narrowly-tailored race-conscious\nadmissions programs are not inherently invidious, see 539 U.S. at 334-44, and do not work wholly to the\nbenefit of members of one group, see id. at 330. The Court further explained that “the skills needed in\ntoday’s increasingly global marketplace can only be developed through exposure to widely diverse people,\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;          Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.                 Page 29\n09-1111                          Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\npolitical-process framework to an obstacle impeding preferential treatment, the Seattle\nCourt drew no distinction between the equal protection rights at stake in seeking anti-\ndiscrimination legislation and those at stake in seeking preferential treatment.\n\n         It should be unsurprising, then, that the language of Hunter and Seattle\nencompasses any legislation in the interest of racial minorities, and thus is broader than\nit would be were the distinction urged by the Attorney General and the dissenters valid.\nSee, e.g., Seattle, 458 U.S. at 467 (noting that the Fourteenth Amendment protects\nagainst distortions of the political process that “place special burdens on the ability of\nminority groups to achieve beneficial legislation”) (emphasis added); id. at 470\n(requiring searching judicial scrutiny where state action makes it more difficult for racial\nminorities “to achieve legislation that is in their interest”) (emphasis added) (internal\nquotation marks omitted); id. at 474 (finding it “enough that minorities may consider\nbusing for integration to be legislation that is in their interest”) (emphasis added)\n(internal quotation marks omitted); Hunter, 393 U.S. at 393 (“[T]he State may no more\ndisadvantage any particular group by making it more difficult to enact legislation in its\nbehalf than it may dilute any person’s vote . . . .”) (emphasis added).\n\n         This language makes clear that the Hunter/Seattle doctrine works to prevent the\nplacement of special procedural obstacles on minority objectives, whatever those\nobjectives may be. The distinction urged by the Attorney General and the dissenters thus\nerroneously imposes an outcome-based limitation on a process-based right. What\nmatters is whether racial minorities are forced to surmount procedural hurdles in\nreaching their objectives over which other groups do not have to leap. If they are, the\ndisparate procedural treatment violates the Equal Protection Clause, regardless of the\nobjective sought.\n\n\n\n\ncultures, ideas, and viewpoints.” Id. Nor are we swayed by Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action v.\nBrown, 674 F.3d 1128 (9th Cir. 2012), which offered only conclusory support for the precedential decision\nin Wilson.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;      Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.          Page 30\n09-1111                      Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\n                b. Proposal 2 as a Mere Repeal\n\n        Latching on to the Supreme Court’s observation that “the simple repeal or\nmodification of desegregation or antidiscrimination laws, without more, never has been\nviewed as embodying a presumptively invalid racial classification,” Crawford v. Bd. of\nEduc., 458 U.S. 527, 539 (1982); accord Hunter, 393 U.S. at 390 n.5; Seattle 458 U.S.\nat 483, the Attorney General implores us to classify Proposal 2 as a mere repeal of the\nuniversities’ race-conscious admissions policies, rather than the kind of political\nrestructuring that implicates the Hunter/Seattle doctrine. Crawford, a case decided the\nsame day as Seattle, emphasizes the difference between mere repeals and political\nrestructuring; state actors must retain the power to repeal policies without running afoul\nof the political-process doctrine—certainly not every policy elimination carries with it\na political-process violation. See 458 U.S. at 540. Crawford brings this difference into\nfocus, because the Court-approved political action in that case (amendment of the\nCalifornia Constitution) occurred at the same level of government as the original\nenactment (a prior amendment of the California Constitution), thus leaving the rules of\nthe political game unchanged. Id.\n\n        The Supreme Court has twice distinguished the “mere repeal” at issue in\nCrawford from the political reordering at issue in Hunter and Seattle. The Crawford\nCourt distinguished Hunter by clarifying that the charter amendment in Hunter was\n“something more than a mere repeal” because it not only repealed an ordinance adopted\nby the popularly elected City Council, it removed from the Council the power to\nreinstate it—more than just undoing an unpopular act, the electorate in Hunter had\naltered the framework of the political process. Crawford, 458 U.S. at 541. The Seattle\nCourt drew the same distinction between the Washington State legislation and the\nCalifornia amendment: it found that Initiative 350 “works something more than the\n‘mere repeal’ of a desegregation law by the political entity that created it . . . by lodging\ndecisionmaking authority over the question at a new and remote level of government.”\nSeattle, 458 U.S. at 483. Just as in Hunter, the electorate in Seattle changed the rules of\nthe political process.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;         Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.                Page 31\n09-1111                         Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\n        Here, the rules are not the same after Proposal 2. Rather than undoing an act of\npopularly elected officials by simply repealing the policies they created, Michigan voters\nrepealed the admissions policies that university officials created and took the additional\nstep of permanently removing the officials’ power to reinstate them. In short, Proposal\n2 “works something more than the ‘mere repeal’ of a desegregation law by the political\nentity that created it.” Id. Had those favoring elimination of all race-conscious\nadmissions policies successfully lobbied the universities’ admissions units, just as racial\nminorities did to have these policies adopted in the first place, there would be no equal\nprotection concern. Rather, like Initiative 350 did for any future attempt to implement\nintegrative busing (and the Akron city charter amendment did for any future attempt to\nenact a fair housing ordinance), Proposal 2 “burdens all future attempts” to implement\nrace-conscious admissions policies “by lodging decisionmaking authority over the\nquestion at a new and remote level of government.” Id.\n\n        This reallocation of decisionmaking authority at a “new and remote level of\ngovernment” distinguishes the instant case from Crawford. See id. Certainly, should\nMichigan’s public universities want to abolish these race-conscious admissions policies,\nthe admissions committees, the universities’ presidents and provosts, and the\nuniversities’ boards remain free to repeal them, without any infringement on the right\nto equal protection in the political process. The avenues of change available to\nMichigan’s public universities parallel those available to the District in Seattle. In ruling\nthe statewide repeal of the voluntary busing plan unconstitutional, the Seattle Court\nrequired any appeal to occur through local government, where the plan was originally\nenacted. Our decision no more entrenches a race-conscious policy than the Supreme\nCourt’s decisions in Seattle or Hunter. Indeed, while the dissenting opinions accuse us\nof judicially enshrining the presumptively invalid policy of considering race as one\nfactor in holistic admissions determinations, we take no such step.9\n\n\n\n\n        9\n         Moreover, by definition, we are only addressing valid, constitutional policies; the university\nboards have no authority to promulgate invalid, unconstitutional policies.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;          Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.                   Page 32\n09-1111                          Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\n         More generally, the dissenting opinions criticize our holding today in broad and\nstrident terms. At their core, these opinions express disapproval of the political-process\ndoctrine itself, dissatisfaction that Grutter allowed for even modest race-conscious\nadmissions policies, and incredulity at the possibility that a state constitutional\namendment forbidding consideration of race could violate the Equal Protection Clause.\nBut Hunter and Seattle have not been overruled; Grutter continues to permit the same\nholistic race-conscious admissions policies Proposal 2 seeks to permanently eliminate;\nand courts must decide equal protection challenges by application of precedent, rather\nthan resort to syllogism. Most importantly, our holding does not place race-conscious\nadmissions policies beyond the political process. Opponents of affirmative action\nremain free to advocate for their preferred policies in the same manner and at the same\nlevel of government as its proponents.\n\n         4. Constitutionality of Proposal 2 Under the Political-Process Doctrine\n\n         Proposal 2 modifies Michigan’s political process “to place special burdens on the\nability of minority groups to achieve beneficial legislation.” See id. at 467. Because\nProposal 2 fails the Hunter/Seattle test, it must survive strict scrutiny. See id. at 485\nn.28. Under the strict scrutiny standard, the Attorney General must prove that Proposal\n2 is “necessary to further a compelling state interest.” Crawford, 458 U.S. at 536. In\nSeattle, the Court did not consider whether a compelling state interest might justify a\nstate’s enactment of a racially-focused law that restructures the political process, because\nthe government made no such argument. 458 U.S. at 485 n.28. Likewise, because the\nAttorney General does not assert that Proposal 2 satisfies a compelling state interest, we\nneed not consider this argument. Therefore, those portions of Proposal 2 that affect\nMichigan’s public institutions of higher education violate the Equal Protection Clause.10\n\n\n\n\n         10\n           Because the Plaintiffs’ challenge is limited to public education, we do not decide today whether\nthe portions of Proposal 2 that affect public employment and public contracting also violate the Equal\nProtection Clause.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;      Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.          Page 33\n09-1111                      Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\n        5. Traditional Equal Protection Analysis\n\n        Having found that Proposal 2 deprives the Plaintiffs of equal protection of the\nlaw under the political-process doctrine, we need not reach the question of whether it\nalso violates the Equal Protection Clause when assessed using the “traditional” analysis.\n\nB. The University Defendants’ Non-Dismissal\n\n        The University Defendants appeal the district court’s denial of their motion to\nbe dismissed as misjoined parties under Rule 21 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\nWe review the district court’s decision for an abuse of discretion and must affirm unless\nwe are “left with a definite and firm conviction that the trial court committed a clear\nerror of judgment.” Letherer v. Alger Group, L.L.C., 328 F.3d 262, 266 (6th Cir. 2003)\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted), overruled on other grounds by Powerex\nCorp. v. Reliant Energy Servs., 551 U.S. 224 (2007).\n\n        Rule 21 states in relevant part: “[o]n motion or on its own, the court may at any\ntime, on just terms, add or drop a party.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 21. “The Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure do not define misjoinder, but the cases make clear that misjoinder of parties\noccurs when [parties] fail to satisfy the conditions for permissive joinder under Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 20(a).” Glendora v. Malone, 917 F. Supp. 224, 227 (S.D.N.Y. 1996). Because\na motion to be dismissed under Rule 21 tracks Rule 20(a), we must ask whether the\nCoalition Plaintiffs have satisfied the rules for permissive joinder. Under Rule 20(a),\ndefendants may be joined if “any right to relief is asserted against them jointly, severally,\nor in the alternative with respect to or arising out of the same transaction, occurrence, or\nseries of transactions or occurrences; and any question of law or fact common to all\ndefendants will arise in the action.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 20(a)(2). “A misjoinder of\nparties . . . frequently is declared because no relief is demanded from one or more of the\nparties joined as defendants.” Letherer, 328 F.3d at 267 (quoting 7 Charles Alan Wright\net al., Federal Practice and Procedure § 1683, at 475-76 (3d ed. 2001)).\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;     Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.         Page 34\n09-1111                     Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\n       The district court concluded that the University Defendants were properly joined\nparties under Rule 20(a) because the Coalition Plaintiffs asserted a request for relief on\na claim involving common issues of law and fact. The district court found that “the\nclaims brought against the universities are intertwined with those challenging Proposal\n2,” and “[i]f [the court] were to find Proposal 2 unconstitutional, affirmative action\nwould not automatically be reinstated into the admissions process.            Rather, the\nuniversities would have to choose to do so on their own.” Coal. IV, 539 F. Supp. 2d at\n941. Because the Coalition Plaintiffs’ traditional equal protection claim could have\nrequired the University Defendants to grant relief by reinstating race-conscious\nadmissions policies, the district court found Rule 20(a) satisfied and concluded that\ndismissal as a misjoined party was not appropriate. See id.\n\n       The discretionary language of Rule 21, coupled with our deferential standard of\nreview, presents a high hurdle for reversal of the district court’s determinations. The\nCoalition Plaintiffs asserted a right to relief against the University Defendants, and so\nwe are not “left with a definite and firm conviction that the trial court committed a clear\nerror of judgment,” Letherer, 328 F.3d at 266, and affirm the district court’s denial of\nthe University Defendants’ motion.\n\nC. Dismissal of Russell as an Intervenor\n\n       Intervening Defendant Russell appeals the district court’s decision granting the\nCantrell Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment to dismiss him from the case because\nhe no longer satisfied the requirements for intervention. We review de novo a district\ncourt’s grant of summary judgment, which “should be granted when the moving party\ncan show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Geiger v. Tower Auto., 579 F.3d 614, 620 (6th\nCir. 2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). We also review de novo district court\ndecisions on motions to intervene as of right, except for the element of timeliness, which\nis reviewed for an abuse of discretion. Northland Family Planning Clinic, Inc. v. Cox,\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;      Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.           Page 35\n09-1111                      Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\n487 F.3d 323, 344 (6th Cir. 2007). “Because the timeliness element is not in dispute\nhere, we review the entire intervention of right issue de novo.” Id.\n\n        At the time Russell originally moved to intervene as of right, he was an applicant\nto the University of Michigan Law School. With his application pending at the time\nProposal 2 passed, Russell was permitted to intervene because he purportedly had an\ninterest in the immediate termination of race-conscious admissions policies, as these\npolicies could theoretically affect his chances of gaining admittance. During the\npendency of this litigation, Russell has been denied admission from the University of\nMichigan Law School, attended and graduated from Wayne State University Law\nSchool, and following his graduation, accepted a position as a non-tenured lecturer at\nOakland Community College and Oakland University.\n\n        Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a), an interested party must meet four\nrequirements before being permitted to intervene as of right: (1) his motion to intervene\nmust be timely; (2) he must have a substantial legal interest in the subject matter of the\ncase; (3) he must demonstrate that his interest will be impaired in the absence of\nintervention; and (4) he must demonstrate that the parties already before the court do not\nadequately represent his interest. United States v. Michigan, 424 F.3d 438, 443 (6th Cir.\n2005). An intervenor also must continue to meet these requirements throughout the\nduration of the litigation, as courts must be able to ensure that parties have a live interest\nin the case. See Morgan v. McDonough, 726 F.2d 11, 14 (1st Cir. 1984) (affirming the\ndismissal of an intervening party whose legal interest had lapsed because “even if [the\nparty’s original intervention were as of right,] it would have gained no absolute\nentitlement to continue as a party until termination of the suit”).\n\n        Although Russell met all four requirements when he was permitted to intervene,\nit has become apparent during the course of litigation that Russell can no longer\ndemonstrate that the parties already before the court do not adequately represent his\ninterests. Russell’s burden of showing that “representation of his interests ‘may be’\ninadequate” is “minimal,” Trbovich v. United Mine Workers of Am., 404 U.S. 528, 538\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;     Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.        Page 36\n09-1111                     Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nn.10 (1972), however, he still must overcome “the presumption of adequate\nrepresentation” that arises if he shares “the same ultimate objective as a party to the\nsuit,” United States v. Michigan, 424 F.3d at 443-44. Although the Attorney General’s\nand Russell’s interests initially diverged—the Attorney General agreed to stipulate to\ndelay the application of Proposal 2, whereas Russell had an interest in Proposal 2’s\nimmediate enforcement—their interests are now aligned. Both now share the same\nultimate objective: the validation of Proposal 2. The Attorney General is unquestionably\nmounting a firm defense of Proposal 2, including a victory in the district court. Any\n“mere disagreement over litigation strategy” Russell may have with the Attorney\nGeneral’s defense “does not, in and of itself, establish inadequacy of representation.”\nBradley v. Milliken, 828 F.2d 1186, 1192 (6th Cir. 1987). Therefore, there is no genuine\nissue of material fact as to whether the Attorney General adequately represents Russell’s\ninterests. Russell’s intervention in this litigation is no longer proper and we affirm the\ndistrict court’s grant of the Cantrell Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment to dismiss\nhim.\n\n                                           III.\n\n       Finding those provisions of Proposal 2 affecting Michigan’s public colleges and\nuniversities unconstitutional, we REVERSE the district court’s judgment granting the\nDefendants-Appellees’ motion for summary judgment. We further AFFIRM the district\ncourt’s denial of the University Defendants’ motion to be dismissed as parties, and\nAFFIRM the district court’s grant of the Cantrell Plaintiffs’ motion for summary\njudgment as to Russell.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;           Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.

BOGGS, Circuit Judge, dissenting. In 1848, the relevant local\nauthority, the Boston School Board, decided that race should be used in making\nassignments in the Boston public schools. See Roberts v. City of Boston, 59 Mass. 198,\n208–09 (1849). They excluded and segregated black students. However, in 1855 the\nultimate political authority, the legislature of Massachusetts, established the general\nprinciple against racial discrimination in educational choices.1 The legislature was\nlauded for that choice. See generally J. Morgan Kousser, “The Supremacy of Equal\nRights”: The Struggle against Racial Discrimination in Antebellum Massachusetts and\nthe Foundations of the Fourteenth Amendment, 82 Nw. U. L. Rev. 941, 943 & nn. 8–9\n(1988).\n\n          Over 100 years later, various Michigan local and subordinate state authorities\nbegan to implement policies of racial discrimination in decisions on, inter alia,\neducational admissions. The Supreme Court of the United States held that such actions\nwere permissible, but certainly not that they were compelled. Grutter v. Bollinger,\n539 U.S. 306 (2003). Subsequently, the ultimate state political authority, the People of\nMichigan, voted to establish the same principle that Massachusetts did in 1855.2 This\nis the same principle embodied in President Kennedy’s Executive Order 10925 of\n1961—that governmental decisions should be undertaken “without regard to race, creed,\n\n\n\n\n          1\n           “In determining the qualifications of scholars to be admitted into any public school or any\ndistrict school in this Commonwealth, no distinction shall be made on account of the race, color or\nreligious opinions, of the applicant or scholar.” 1855 Mass. Acts ch. 256.\n\n          2\n           “The Univeristy of Michigan, Michigan State University, Wayne State University, and any other\npublic college or university, community college, or school district shall not discriminate against, or grant\npreferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national\norigin in the operation of public employment, public education, or public contracting.” Mich. Const. art.\nI, § 26.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;          Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.                 Page 38\n09-1111                          Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\ncolor or national origin.” 26 Fed. Reg. 1977, sec. 301(1) (Mar. 8, 1961). Indeed, the\nvery term “affirmative action” comes from that presidential order.3\n\n         The majority of the en banc court now holds that this action of the People of\nMichigan was unconstitutional, relying on an extreme extension of two United States\nSupreme Court cases ruling on very different circumstances.\n\n         To begin with, those two cases each involved a single action that transferred, for\nthe first time, decision making on a single matter, a transfer held to be wholly aimed at\none disadvantaged race. In one instance, approval of new anti-discrimination ordinances\nwas moved from the city council to the voters of the city of Akron, and in the other case,\npower over certain pupil assignment policies was moved from the citizens of one city in\nthe state of Washington to the citizens of the entire state.\n\n         In our case, however, we have the citizens of the entire state establishing a\nprinciple that would in general have seemed laudable. Even plaintiffs here do not allege,\nin the context of their political-process argument, that if this constitutional provision had\nbeen enacted at some earlier time in Michigan, for example upon its entry into the union,\nor upon the enactment of its new constitution in 1963, that it would have been\nunconstitutional. They instead contend that because of current circumstances, and\nintervening political decisions of racial discrimination, these Supreme Court cases make\nthe principled action of the People of Michigan unconstitutional.\n\n         Indeed, the majority seems to concede that some set of decision makers in\nMichigan would be able to reverse the policies that they claim are immune from actions\nby the entire body politic. Rather, they demand that any changes in the educational (and\nperhaps employment) policies here can be enacted only by individual actions of each of\nthe university governing authorities (three of which are chosen by statewide election\nover eight years, Mich. Const. art. VIII § 5), each regional state university (whose\n\n\n         3\n         “The contractor will take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and that\nemployees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin.”\nIbid.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;     Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.

On the other hand,\nvarious groups, sometimes defined as racial minorities, may be discriminated against.\nSee Ho v. S.F. Unified Sch. Dist., 965 F. Supp. 1316 (N.D. Calif 1997) (Chinese); St.\nFrancis Coll. v. Al-Khazraji, 481 U.S. 604 (1987) (Arabs); Shaare Tefila Congregation\nv.

Under those circumstances, if that\nchild or its parents wished it to compete for educational or employment opportunities in\nMichigan without discrimination for or against the child, however a bureaucrat might\nclassify the child, the majority’s position is that they could do so only by proceeding in\na large number of individual political and election campaigns across the length and\nbreadth of Michigan, rather than by, as was the case here, convincing voters of Michigan\nto enact a policy that would under most other circumstances have been held to be\nlaudable.\n\n       I cannot agree that this decision is correct, either as a matter of general\nconstitutional law or as an accurate interpretation of the Supreme Court precedents. I\ntherefore respectfully DISSENT.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;      Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.

Proposal 2 is not\nunconstitutional under either a political restructuring theory or under traditional equal\nprotection analysis. I therefore respectfully dissent.\n\n                                             I.\n\n        Elementary principles of constitutional law tell us that plaintiffs’ challenge to\nProposal 2 should have little to no chance of success. Plaintiffs argue that Michigan\nmust retain its racial and other preference policies in higher education and that the state’s\nvoters cannot make the contrary policy choice that factors like race and gender may not\nbe taken into account in admissions. They make this argument in the face of the core\nequal protection principle of nondiscrimination—a principle consistent with the choice\nof the people of Michigan. They make the argument despite the absence of any\nprecedent suggesting that states must employ racial preferences in university admissions.\nEssentially, the argument is one of constitutional protection for racial and gender\npreference—a concept at odds with the basic meaning of the Equal Protection Clause,\nas understood and explained through decades of jurisprudence.\n\n        Although it has convinced a majority of this court, plaintiffs’ argument must be\nunderstood for the marked departure it represents—for the first time, the presumptively\ninvalid policy of racial and gender preference has been judicially entrenched as beyond\nthe political process. In reaching its conclusion, the majority strays from analysis\nbounded by familiar principles of constitutional law and loses sight of the parameters\nwithin which we should operate in deciding this case. To be accurate in characterizing\nthe majority’s approach, it relies on two Supreme Court cases, which it deems highly\ninstructive. Yet, when examined carefully, these cases have no application here, and,\nin emphasizing them, the majority overlooks recent case law providing more relevant\nguidance.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;     Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.          Page 42\n09-1111                     Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\n                                            II.\n\n        The political restructuring theory on which the majority relies does not invalidate\nProposal 2. Racial preference policies in university admissions—presumptively invalid\nbut permissible under limited circumstances and for a finite period of time—do not\nreceive the same structural protections against statewide popular repeal as other laws that\ninure to the interest of minorities. To understand why this is the case, it is necessary to\nview the Hunter/Seattle doctrine in the context of the recent decisional law of race-based\nclassification. See Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306, 327 (2003) (“Context matters\nwhen reviewing race-based governmental action under the Equal Protection Clause.”).\n\n        In holding that student-body diversity is a compelling state interest that can\njustify the narrowly tailored use of race in university admissions policies, Grutter set\nforth three principles about race-based admissions policies that bear repeating here.\nFirst, Grutter reminded us that “‘[a] core purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment was to\ndo away with all governmentally imposed discrimination based on race’” and that, as a\nconsequence, “race-conscious admissions policies must be limited in time.” Grutter,\n539 U.S. at 341, 342 (quoting Palmore v. Sidotti, 466 U.S., 429, 432 (1984)). This\nprinciple makes sense because all “racial classifications are presumptively invalid . . . .”\nNev. Dep’t of Human Res. v. Hibbs, 538 U.S. 721, 736 (2003). Second, Grutter\nindicated that the decision to end race-conscious admissions policies is primarily one to\nbe made by states and their public universities, not courts. See Grutter, 539 U.S at 342\n(noting that “sunset provisions . . . and periodic reviews” could be used to determine the\ncontinuing necessity of racial preferences and noting with favor race-neutral alternatives\nalready employed in several states). And third, while racially conscious admissions\npolicies are permitted, they are not constitutionally required. Id. at 325 (“[S]tudent body\ndiversity is a compelling state interest that can justify the use of race in university\nadmissions.”) (emphasis added); see Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action v. Granholm,\n473 F.3d 237, 249 (6th Cir. 2006) (“Grutter never said, or even hinted, that state\nuniversities must do what they narrowly may do.”).\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;     Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.          Page 43\n09-1111                     Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\n                                            A.\n\n        With these core principles in mind we examine the applicability of Hunter and\nSeattle to the passage of Proposal 2 in Michigan. We begin with Hunter v. Erickson,\n393 U.S. 385, 386-87, 390 (1969), in which Akron voters repealed a fair housing\nordinance that banned discrimination in the sale or lease of real property and created a\nmore burdensome process for minorities to seek such protection. 393 U.S. at 386–87,\n390. The underlying law—the repeal of which was effected through section 137 of the\nCity Charter and was found to violate the political restructuring doctrine—protected\nminorities by mandating their equal right to be free from discrimination. Id. at 390–93.\nHunter thus involved the repeal of a presumptively valid law that mandated equal\ntreatment; it did not involve the repeal of a racial preference policy or any other law that\nwas itself presumptively invalid. See Coral Constr., Inc. v. San Francisco, 235 P.3d\n947, 959 (Cal. 2010) (“In no sense did [Hunter] concern preferences . . . .”). Because\nHunter considered only the political-process implications of repealing a law that required\nequal treatment, it cannot be read broadly to apply to the repeal of a law requiring\npreferential treatment. As we have observed, “[t]hese are fundamentally different\nconcepts.” Granholm, 473 F.3d at 251; see Coal. for Econ. Equity v. Wilson, 122 F.3d\n692, 708 (9th Cir. 1997) (“It is one thing to say that individuals have equal protection\nrights against political obstructions to equal treatment; it is quite another to say that\nindividuals have equal protection rights against political obstructions to preferential\ntreatment.”). Thus, Hunter does not guide us here.\n\n        Nor does Washington v. Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1, 458 U.S. 457 (1982), suggest\napplication of the political restructuring doctrine to Proposal 2. The underlying law in\nSeattle was a local ordinance that implemented a series of school desegregation\nmeasures, which was repealed by a statewide referendum called Initiative 350. Seattle,\n458 U.S. at 460–62. In finding that the passage of Initiative 350 violated the political\nstructure doctrine, Seattle explained that “when the political process or the\ndecisionmaking mechanism used to address racially conscious legislation—and only\nsuch legislation—is singled out for peculiar and disadvantageous treatment, the\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;          Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.                   Page 44\n09-1111                          Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\ngovernmental action plainly rests on distinctions based on race.” 458 U.S. at 485\n(second emphasis supplied) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also id. at 474 (“The\ninitiative removes the authority to address a racial problem—and only a racial\nproblem—from the existing decisionmaking body . . . .” (emphasis supplied)). In other\nwords, in order to trigger political-process concerns, Seattle instructs that the challenged\nenactment must single out racial issues or racially oriented legislation. And indeed, the\nchallenged enactment in Seattle, though facially neutral, was “carefully tailored to\ninterfere only with desegregative busing”—that is, to address “only a racial problem.”\nId. at 471 & n.14, 474. That is not the case here. Proposal 2 does not address “only a\nracial problem:” it prohibits any preference on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or\nnational origin. Mich. Const. art. I. § 26. Nor was Proposal 2 “carefully tailored” to\naffect only university admissions: it extends not just to public universities but also to\npublic employment and public contracting. Id. Accordingly, Proposal 2 is quite unlike\nthe narrow anti-busing measure struck down in Seattle; it represents “a sea change in\nstate policy, of a kind not present in Seattle or any other ‘political structure’ case.” See\nCoral Constr., 235 P.3d at 966 (Corrigan, J., concurring).\n\n         The majority is quick to conclude that Proposal 2 and Initiative 350 each target\npolicies—affirmative action and integrative busing, respectively—that “inure[] primarily\nto the benefit of the minority” and therefore each has a “racial focus.” (Maj. Op. at\n15–18.) But in a political-restructuring challenge, it is not enough to observe that some\nof the policies affected by the challenged enactment primarily benefit minorities. Nor\nis it enough to observe that, as here, the challenged enactment was passed in response\nto a high-profile case permitting racially conscious admissions policies under some\ncircumstances. Though relevant, these observations are alone insufficient: in a political\nrestructuring case, it is imperative to consider the scope of the challenged enactment\nitself.1 The majority fails to account for the broad substantive reach of Proposal 2 when\n\n         1\n           It is true that Hunter involved a challenged enactment that thwarted the passage of local\nordinances focusing not only on racial but also on religious and ancestral discrimination. Hunter, 393 U.S.\nat 386. But Hunter’s section 137 was far narrower than Proposal 2 in that it did not extend to sex nor did\nit apply beyond housing matters. Furthermore, as explained above, Hunter did not even arguably involve\nthe repeal of a law instituting racial preferences and thus does not suggest application of the political\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;         Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.          Page 45\n09-1111                         Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\ncompared to the narrow focus of Initiative 350 and, in so doing, improperly stretches the\npolitical restructuring doctrine that Seattle articulates to the instant case.\n\n         There is an additional reason that the political restructuring doctrine should not\napply here, a reason that has less to do with Seattle itself than with the evolution of equal\nprotection jurisprudence since it was decided. Today, it is plain that a racially conscious\nstudent assignment system—such as the one that the Seattle initiative attempted to make\nmore difficult to enact—would be presumptively invalid and subject to strict scrutiny.\nSee Parents Involved in Cmty. Sch. v. Seattle Schs. Dist. No. 1, 551 U.S. 701, 720 (2007)\n(“[T]he     school      districts   must   demonstrate     that   the   use     of   individual\nracial classifications in the assignment plans here under review is narrowly tailored to\nachieve a compelling government interest.” (internal quotation marks omitted)). But that\nwas not always the case. As the California Supreme Court has observed, “at the time\nSeattle was decided, the high court’s prior decisions indicated that the assignment of\npupils by ratios to achieve racial balance fell ‘within the broad discretionary powers of\nschool authorities’ to formulate ‘educational policy’ and to ‘prepare students to live in\na pluralistic society . . . .’” Coral Constr., 235 P.3d at 959 (quoting Swann v. Charlotte-\nMecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 402 U.S. 1, 16 (1971)); see N.C. State Bd. of Educ. v. Swann,\n402 U.S. 43, 45 (1971) (“[S]chool authorities have wide discretion in formulating school\npolicy, and that as a matter of educational policy school authorities may well conclude\nthat some kind of racial balance in the schools is desirable quite apart from any\nconstitutional requirements.”); see Deborah N. Archer, Moving Beyond Strict Scrutiny:\nThe Need for A More Nuanced Standard of Equal Protection Analysis for K Through 12\nIntegration Programs, 9 U. Pa. J. Const. L. 629, 648 & n.118 (2007) (writing, prior to\nParents Involved, that “strict scrutiny has never been applied in the context of school\ndesegregation by the Supreme Court”); cf. Parents Involved, 551 U.S. at 737 (plurality)\n(“[W]hen Swann was decided, this Court had not yet confirmed that strict scrutiny\napplies to racial classifications like those before us [i.e., a racially conscious student\n\n\n\nrestructuring doctrine here.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;           Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.

Indeed, it was not until 1995 that the Supreme Court made\nclear in Adarand Contractors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200, 227 (1995), that strict scrutiny\napplies to all racial classifications. See Parents Involved, 551 U.S. at 720 (majority\nopinion) (citing Adarand); id. at 739 n.16 (plurality opinion) (citing Adarand); id. at 758\n(Thomas, J., concurring) (citing Adarand); Jonathan Fischbach et al., Race at the Pivot\nPoint: The Future of Race-Based Policies to Remedy De Jure Segregation After Parents\nInvolved in Community Schools, 43 Harv. C.R.-C.L. L. Rev. 491, 529–30 (2008)\n(“Adarand . . . established the uniform application of strict scrutiny to all racial\nclassifications.”); Jed Rubenfeld, The Anti-Antidiscrimination Agenda, 111 Yale L.J.\n1141, 1168 (2002).\n\n         Thus, when articulating the reach of the political restructuring doctrine, Seattle\ndid not consider that the underlying policy affected by the challenged enactment was\npresumptively invalid.2           But we must consider that fact here.                  And indeed, the\ncircumstance that racially conscious admissions policies are subject to the most exacting\njudicial scrutiny and limited in time—legal realities that the Seattle Court neither\nconfronted nor factored into its decision—counsels heavily against applying the political\nrestructuring doctrine to the enactment of Proposal 2. See Grutter, 539 U.S. at 341–42.\nGrutter’s charge that “[u]niversities in other States can and should draw on the most\npromising aspects of . . . race-neutral alternatives as they develop” only underscores this\npoint. Id. at 342. So while the majority is correct that Seattle employs broad language\nabout protecting the “‘ability of minority groups to achieve beneficial legislation’” (Maj.\nOp. at 32 (quoting Seattle, 458 U.S. at 467)), it must be remembered that the “beneficial”\npolicy that Proposal 2 purportedly makes more difficult to enact is itself “‘highly\n\n\n\n\n         2\n           While the dissent in Seattle suggested that the busing program be subject to strict scrutiny,\n458 U.S. at 492 n.6 (Powell, J., dissenting), the majority did “not specifically pass on that issue” because\nno one had challenged “the propriety of race-conscious student assignments for the purpose of achieving\nintegration, even absent a finding of prior de jure segregation.” Id. at 472 n.15 (majority opinion); see also\nParents Involved, 551 U.S. at 721 n.10 (noting that in Seattle the question of “whether a district’s\nvoluntary adoption of race-based assignments in the absence of a finding of prior de jure segregation was\nconstitutionally permissible” was “an issue . . . expressly reserved”).\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;          Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.                  Page 47\n09-1111                          Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nsuspect.’”3 Grutter, 539 U.S. at 326 (quoting City of Richmond v. J.A. Cruson Co.,\n488 U.S. 469, 493 (1989)). This is exactly the type of “[c]ontext [that] matters when\nreviewing race-based governmental action under the Equal Protection Clause.” Id. at\n327. In short, equal protection jurisprudence regarding the use of racial classifications\nhas developed markedly since Seattle was decided, and this development makes clear\nthat applying the political restructuring doctrine to the enactment of Proposal 2 is hardly\nappropriate.\n\n                                                   B.\n\n         In concluding that a race-based classification that is presumptively invalid, but\npermissible under limited circumstances and for a finite period of time, receives the\nsame structural protections against statewide popular repeal as other laws that inure to\nthe interest of minorities, the majority walks alone. The two highest courts to have\nconsidered the question have concluded that the political restructuring doctrine of Hunter\nand Seattle does not prevent the statewide popular elimination of race-based\nclassification policies. The Ninth Circuit concluded that California’s Proposition 209,\nwhich eliminated public race-based and gender-based affirmative action programs, did\nnot violate equal protection because “[i]mpediments to preferential treatment do not\ndeny equal protection.” Wilson, 122 F.3d at 708. The court relied on an essential\nconstitutional principle: “While the Constitution protects against obstructions to equal\ntreatment, it erects obstructions to preferential treatment by its own terms . . . . The Equal\nProtection Clause, parked at our most ‘distant and remote’ level of government, singles\nout racial preferences for severe political burdens—it prohibits them in all but the most\ncompelling circumstances.” Id. The Ninth Circuit recently affirmed its commitment to\nthe reasoning in Wilson, finding it “easily reconciled” with Grutter. Coal. to Defend\nAffirmative Action v. Brown, 674 F.3d 1128, 1136 (9th Cir. 2012). The California\nSupreme Court came to the same conclusion, quoting Grutter for the principle that\n\n         3\n            For this reason, it is unimportant whether at the challenged enactment in Seattle imposed “an\nobstacle impeding preferential treatment” (Maj. Op. at 30) or whether the enactment merely made it more\ndifficult to seek protection from discrimination. Whatever the case, Seattle did not involve the rights of\nminorities to a policy that was presumptively invalid and explicitly limited in time.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;     Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.          Page 48\n09-1111                     Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\n“‘racial classifications, however compelling their goals, are potentially so dangerous that\nthey may be employed no more broadly than the interest demands. Enshrining a\npermanent justification for racial preferences would offend this fundamental equal\nprotection principle.’” Coral Constr., 235 P.3d at 960 (quoting Grutter, 539 U.S. at\n342). The court explained that “[i]nstead of burdening the right to equal treatment, [the\nstatewide referendum banning race-based classification] directly serves the principle that\n‘all governmental use of race must have a logical end point.’” Id. (quoting Grutter,\n539 U.S. at 342). Our own district court agreed: “Proposal 2 does not offend the Equal\nProtection Clause by distancing racial minority groups from the means of obtaining\nequal protection.” Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action v. Regents of Univ. of Mich., 539\nF. Supp. 2d 924, 957 (E.D. Mich. 2008).\n\n        The teaching of these cases is that equal treatment is the baseline rule embodied\nin the Equal Protection Clause, from which racial-preference programs are a departure.\nSee Grutter, 539 U.S. at 342 (“[R]ace-conscious admissions programs . . . [are a]\ndeviation from the norm of equal treatment of all racial and ethnic groups . . . .”). These\nprograms—fundamentally different from the underlying policies in Hunter and\nSeattle—cannot receive special sanctuary from a decision of the majority of voters to\nreturn their law to the equal protection norm of equal treatment.\n\n                                            III.\n\n        There is another reason that Hunter and Seattle cannot forbid the amendment of\nthe Michigan Constitution through the passage of Proposal 2. In both cases the relevant\nlawmaking authority was reallocated from a local legislative body to the “more complex\ngovernment structure,” id. at 477, of the city- or state-wide general electorate, thereby\nplacing a “comparative structural burden . . . on the political achievement of minority\ninterests,” id. at 475 n.17. A key consideration in analyzing a Hunter political structure\nchallenge, therefore, is whether the challenged law affects the ability of minorities to\nsecure “legislation that is in their interest” as minorities. Id. at 474 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted); see also id. at 475 n.17 (“Thus, in Hunter, the procedures for enacting\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;       Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.       Page 49\n09-1111                       Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nracial legislation were modified in a such a way as to place effective control in the hands\nof the citywide electorate. Similarly here [in Seattle], the power to enact racial\nlegislation has been reallocated.”). As the record here demonstrates, the people of\nMichigan have not restructured the state’s lawmaking process in the manner prohibited\nby Hunter and Seattle. Instead, their vote removed admissions policy from the hands of\ndecisionmakers who were unelected and unaccountable to either minority or majority\ninterests and placed it squarely in an electoral process in which all voters, both minority\nand majority, have a voice.\n\n                                             A.\n\n       Public higher education in Michigan is unique in that “[t]he Michigan\nConstitution confers a unique constitutional status on [Michigan’s] public universities\nand their governing boards.” Federated Publ’ns, Inc. v.

These\nboards are “the highest form of juristic person known to the law, a constitutional\ncorporation of independent authority, which, within the scope of its functions, is co-\nordinate with and equal to that of the legislature.” Id. at 496 n.8 (quoting Bd. of Regents\nof the Univ. of Mich. v. Auditor Gen., 132 N.W. 1037, 1040 (Mich. 1911)). Each\ngoverning board is vested with the power of “general supervision of its institution and\nthe control and direction of all expenditures from the institution’s funds.” Mich. Const.\nart. VIII, § 5. The constitution provides for eight-member governing boards, elected to\nstatewide office for eight-year terms, Mich. Const. art. VIII, § 5, and elections are\ntypically staggered, with, for example, an election every two years for regents of the\nUniversity of Michigan.\n\n       Although these universities and their respective boards are created by the\nMichigan Constitution, the admissions policies are placed within the control of the\nboards or school authorities only within each board’s bylaws. Thus, the admissions\npolicies are not established by the state constitution, and it is necessary to look to\ntestimony to determine where the power to set admissions policy lies.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;     Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.          Page 50\n09-1111                     Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\n        The governing boards have fully delegated the responsibility for establishing\nadmissions standards to several program-specific administrative units within each\ninstitution, which set admissions criteria through informal processes that can include a\nfaculty vote. For example, at the University of Michigan Law School the admissions\npolicy is set by the law school faculty admissions committee, with major substantive\nchanges occasionally voted upon by the entire law school faculty. Similarly, as\ndescribed by its former dean, at the Wayne State University Law School the ultimate\ndecision whether to change admissions standards rests with the faculty alone. Thus, as\nthe Cantrell Plaintiffs readily admitted in their previous briefing, the “faculty are the\nprimary architects of all the admissions criteria and protocols.”\n\n        As the deans of both law schools explained, at neither university is there a system\nin place to review or alter admissions policies at a level above a vote of the faculty.\nSarah Zearfoss, the dean of admissions at the University of Michigan Law School,\ntestified that no one could change the school’s admissions policy other than the faculty\nadmissions committee or the faculty itself, because “there’s no higher body” to which\nsomeone unhappy with an admissions policy could advocate change. And Frank Wu,\nthen the dean at Wayne State University Law School, agreed that “only the faculty at the\nlaw school has the authority to create and approve the admissions policy” at the school.\nIndeed, Wu testified that the admissions policy is not subject to the approval of the\nWayne State University Board of Governors, and, in his view, if the Board of Governors\nattempted to alter the decision of the law school’s faculty with respect to criteria for\nadmission, “it would precipitate a constitutional crisis.” Each institution’s board may\nsuperficially have “plenary authority” over its respective institution (see Maj. Op. at 20),\nbut the real authority to set admissions policy rests with each program-specific faculty\nwithin the universities.\n\n        The majority ignores the factual testimony of Deans Zearfoss and Wu, which\nexplains how admissions policies are actually crafted. Instead, the majority emphasizes\nthat the boards—although they have fully delegated their decisionmaking power to\nadmissions directors and faculty—can revoke this authority and can revise any bylaw\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;     Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.         Page 51\n09-1111                     Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nin order to effect changes in university admission policies. That the boards can legally\nrevoke a delegation of authority or have occasionally revised their bylaws to effect a\nchange in admissions policy, however, does not change the underlying factual reality\nthat the law school deans describe. Their testimony demonstrates that program-specific\nfaculties do not merely manage the “day-to-day implementation of policy,” (Maj. Op.\nat 23); these entities also set and change admissions policies—without any significant\noversight by the boards.\n\n                                            B.\n\n       The decisionmaking structure at the universities is important because these\nprogram-specific faculty admissions committees are far afield from the legislative bodies\nfrom which lawmaking authority was removed in Hunter and Seattle. To appreciate this\ncritical difference, we need look no further than Seattle itself.\n\n       In Seattle, the Court emphasized that the type of action it found objectionable\nwas the creation of comparative burdens “on minority participation in the political\nprocess.” 458 U.S. at 480 n.23; see id. at 486 (“[M]inorities are no less powerless with\nthe vote than without it when a racial criterion is used to assign governmental power in\nsuch a way as to exclude particular racial groups ‘from effective participation in the\npolitical proces[s].’” (quoting City of Mobile v. Bolden, 446 U.S. 55, 94 (1980) (White,\nJ., dissenting))). The Seattle majority, however, did not view state university admissions\ncommittees as a part of the “political process” in the manner of an elected school board\nor city council. A dialogue between the majority and dissent in Seattle is particularly\ninstructive on this point. In dissent, Justice Powell, critiquing the potential breadth of\nthe majority’s holding, argued:\n\n       Thus, if the admissions committee of a state law school developed an\n       affirmative-action plan that came under fire, the Court apparently would\n       find it unconstitutional for any higher authority to intervene unless that\n       authority traditionally dictated admissions policies. As a constitutional\n       matter, the dean of the law school, the faculty of the university system as\n       a whole, the university president, the chancellor of the university, and the\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;      Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.           Page 52\n09-1111                      Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\n        board of regents might be powerless to intervene despite their greater\n        authority under state law.\n\nId. at 498 n.14 (Powell, J., dissenting). The majority, however, flatly dismissed this\nconcern as a misunderstanding of the court’s decision: “It is evident, then, that the\nhorribles paraded by the dissent, post, at [footnote 14 of the dissent]—which have\nnothing to do with the ability of minorities to participate in the process of self-\ngovernment—are entirely unrelated to this case.” Id. at 480 n.23 (emphasis added).\n\n        For the Seattle majority, then, an impermissible reordering of the political\nprocess meant a reordering of the processes through which the people exercise their right\nto govern themselves. See id. at 486 (“And when the State’s allocation of power places\nunusual burdens on the ability of racial groups to enact legislation specifically designed\nto overcome the ‘special condition’ of prejudice, the governmental action seriously\n‘curtail[s] the operation of those political processes ordinarily to be relied upon to protect\nminorities’ . . . from the ‘majoritarian political process.’” (emphasis added) (quoting\nUnited States v. Carolene Prods. Co. 304 U.S. 144, 153 n.4 (1938); San Antonio Indep.\nSch. Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 28 (1973))); see id. at 467 (“But the Fourteenth\nAmendment also reaches a “‘political structure that treats all individuals as equals’ . . .\nyet more subtly distorts governmental processes in such a way as to place special\nburdens on the ability of minority groups to achieve beneficial legislation.” (emphasis\nadded) (quoting Bolden, 446 U.S. at 84)).\n\n        Thus, the academic processes at work in state university admissions in Michigan\nare not “political processes” in the manner contemplated in Seattle. Unlike the Seattle\nSchool Board and the Akron City Council, the various Michigan university admissions\ncommittees and faculty members are unelected. As at most public universities, tenured\nfaculty members have significant vested rights associated with their employment in order\nto preserve academic freedom and independence. The faculty members who are\npermitted to vote on policy matters are therefore significantly insulated from\npolitical pressure by virtue of their tenure.         These faculty are beholden to no\nconstituency—student, local, or otherwise. And, as demonstrated by the testimony of\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;           Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.                    Page 53\n09-1111                           Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nthe law school deans in this case, the people of Michigan have no ability to exert\nelectoral pressure on the university decision makers to change their admissions polices.\nAs they currently stand, the faculty admissions committees are islands unto themselves,\nvested with the full authority to set admissions policy for their respective university\nprograms.\n\n         Of course, when an elected body delegates a power, it does not automatically\nfollow that the delegatee’s decisions fall outside the political process. But that is not the\npoint. Rather, the testimony of the law school deans demonstrates that, whatever the\nformal legal structure, the faculty committees set admissions policies without significant\nreview by the boards—thus insulating them from the political pressures the boards\nthemselves face.4\n\n         Furthermore, there is no “local” university constituency as there is a local\nconstituency for a city council or city school board, i.e., the city’s voters. Rather, despite\nthere being a broad student, faculty, and staff community associated with each university,\nMichigan’s state universities were established as state-wide institutions with a state-wide\nconstituency. The faculty admissions committees therefore do not “represent” any local\nconstituency at all. This is particularly important because the Seattle majority looked\nclosely at the fact that Washington’s lodging of political decisionmaking authority over\nthe busing question at the statewide level directly burdened minority interests by\n“mak[ing] the enactment of racially beneficial legislation difficult, [because] the\nparticular program might not have inspired opposition had it been promulgated through\n\n\n         4\n           Nyquist v. Lee, 318 F. Supp. 710 (W.D.N.Y. 1970), aff’d Nyquist v. Lee, 402 U.S. 935 (1971),\na case from the Western District of New York that was summarily affirmed by the Supreme Court and\ncited in Seattle, is not to the contrary. In Nyquist, the court found that a New York statute that\n“prohibit[ed] state education officials and appointed school boards from assigning students, or establishing,\nreorganizing or maintaining school districts, school zones or attendance units for the purpose of achieving\nracial equality in attendance” unconstitutionally reordered the political process in violation of the Equal\nProtection Clause. Nyquist, 318 F. Supp. at 712, 720. The fact that appointed school boards were part of\nthe political process at issue in Nyquist does not mean that the university faculty admissions committees\nare similarly part of the political process. The decision in Nyquist made note of how the local boards were\naccountable to the community: “Parties considering themselves aggrieved by local board actions may seek\nto have the Commissioner enforce those policies. [The New York statute], however, singles out for\ndifferent treatment all plans which have as their purpose the assignment of students in order to alleviate\nracial imbalance.” Id. at 719 (internal citations omitted). Thus, even the appointed school boards were\naccountable to the community in a way in which the faculty admissions committees certainly are not.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;    Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.         Page 54\n09-1111                    Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nthe usual [local] legislative processes used for comparable legislation.” 458 U.S. at\n483–84. The Court continued:\n\n       That phenomenon is graphically demonstrated by the circumstances of\n       this litigation. The longstanding desegregation programs in Pasco and\n       Tacoma, as well as the Seattle middle school integration plan, have\n       functioned for years without creating undue controversy. Yet they have\n       been swept away, along with the Seattle Plan, by Initiative 350. As a\n       practical matter, it seems most unlikely that proponents of desegregative\n       busing in smaller communities such as Tacoma or Pasco will be able to\n       obtain the statewide support now needed to permit them to desegregate\n       the schools in their communities.\n\nId. at 484 n.27. The availability of “local” decisionmaking is therefore important when\nthe political power of groups who could succeed at the local level is diluted in the\nstatewide decisionmaking process. The universities here, however, are statewide\ninstitutions with a statewide constituency. There is nothing local about them.\n\n       Nor are the committees particularly accessible or subject to effective lobbying.\nWhile members of the public may attend faculty meetings at which admissions standards\nare reviewed, there is no formal mechanism by which a member of the public—student\nor not—can move the committees to amend the admissions standards. And while\ninterested students and members of the public are, with advance notice, permitted to\nspeak at faculty meetings to comment on the admissions policies, the committees are not\nrequired to consider these comments seriously, issue written findings addressing these\nconcerns, or do more than provide a forum for interested individuals to speak. Rather,\nit appears that the main source of divergent views on admissions policies is the faculty\nmembers themselves.\n\n       The lack of a viable electoral mechanism to change university admissions\npolicies at a sub-constitutional level means that the voters’ use of a constitutional\namendment in this instance does not serve to create “comparative structural burden[s]\n. . . on the political achievement of minority interests.” Seattle, 458 U.S. at 474 n.17.\nIf, as the evidence before this court makes plain, the voters cannot exert electoral\npressure on independent faculty committees, then all voters regardless of racial identity\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;     Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.          Page 55\n09-1111                     Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\ncompete on the same level for the political achievement of their higher-education\ninterests: the constitutional level. This state constitutional amendment does not, then,\ncreate an improper comparative structural burden, but rather merely requires proponents\nof the use of racial preferences in admissions policy to engage the same level of process\nfollowed by proponents of Proposal 2. Thus, contrary to what the majority suggests, the\nburden upon a citizen who advocates for legacy preferences in university admissions is\nsimilar to the burden upon a citizen who advocates for racial preferences. Although the\nformer may attempt to lobby a faculty committee or university directly, these\nentities—according to the clear testimony of the law school deans and the manner in\nwhich authority has been delegated—will likely be unresponsive. Likewise, efforts to\nelect a particular board member, where the evidence demonstrates that the boards do not\nalter the admissions policies approved by the faculty committees, will similarly have\nlittle effect on admission policies.\n\n       Although the majority appears to see no reason to distinguish between the\nunelected and unresponsive program-specific faculty admissions committees here and\nthe legislative bodies from which lawmaking authority was removed in Hunter and\nSeattle, a consideration of political accountability in the political process is squarely\ngrounded in the Seattle opinion. In Seattle, the Court undertook a close examination of\nWashington’s system of “establish[ing] the local school board, rather than the State, as\nthe entity charged with making decisions of the type at issue,” 458 U.S. at 477:\n\n       But Washington has chosen to meet its educational responsibilities\n       primarily through “state and local officials, boards, and committees,” and\n       the responsibility to devise and tailor educational programs to suit local\n       needs has emphatically been vested in the local school boards.\n       Thus “each common school district board of directors” is made\n       “accountable for the proper operation of its district to the local\n       community and its electorate.” To this end, each school board is “vested\n       with the final responsibility for the setting of policies ensuring quality in\n       the content and the extent of its educational program.”\n\nId. at 477–78 (citations omitted) (emphases added); see also id. (noting the “disclosure\nand reporting provisions specifically designed to ensure the board’s ‘accountability’ to\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;     Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.          Page 56\n09-1111                     Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nthe people of the community” (emphasis added)). It was only upon its consideration of\nthe state statutory structure’s vesting of decisionmaking in local and politically\naccountable school boards that the Court could conclude that “placing power over\ndesgregative busing at the state level . . . restructured the Washington political process.”\nId. at 480. Taking this into account, it is difficult to conclude that, in amending their\nstate constitution to prohibit the use of racial preferences in university admissions, the\npeople of Michigan modified “the community’s political mechanisms . . . to place\neffective decisionmaking authority over a racial issue at another level of government.”\nId. at 474 (emphases added). Michigan has not “‘burden[ed] all future attempts’ to\nimplement race-conscious admissions policies ‘by lodging decisionmaking authority\nover the question at a new and remote level of government.’” (Maj. Op. at 30–31\n(quoting Seattle, 458 U.S. at 483).) Having little or no direct or indirect influence on the\nbodies that actually set admissions standards—the faculty committees—the people of\nMichigan made a political change at the only level of government actually available to\nthem as voters. The Michigan electorate, therefore, as opposed to choosing a more\ncomplex structure for lawmaking, employed the one effective method available to exert\nelectoral pressure on the mechanisms of government.\n\n        In short, Michigan has chosen to structure its university system such that politics\nplays no part in university admissions at all levels within its constitutionally created\nuniversities. The Michigan voters have therefore not restructured the political process\nin their state by amending their state constitution; they have merely employed it.\n\n                                            IV.\n\n        Finally, it is plain that Proposal 2 does not violate the Equal Protection Clause\nunder a traditional approach to equal protection. “The central purpose of the Equal\nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is the prevention of official conduct\ndiscriminating on the basis of race.” Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 239 (1976).\nWe apply strict scrutiny to laws that (1) include a facial racial classification or (2) have\na discriminatory impact and a discriminatory purpose. Adarand, 515 U.S. at 227; Davis,\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;     Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.         Page 57\n09-1111                     Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\n426 U.S. at 239–42. Proposal 2, which prohibits racial classifications, a fortiori does not\nclassify facially on the basis of race. See Wilson, 122 F.3d at 702; Coral Constr.,\n235 P.3d at 957. As to discriminatory impact and purpose, the district court did find\n“sufficient evidence to establish a fact question on the disparate impact part of the test”\nbut found no discriminatory purpose. Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, 539 F. Supp.\n2d at 951–52. Indeed, it stated that “the demonstration of a discriminatory purpose . . .\ndooms [the] conventional equal protection argument” because it “cannot [be] sa[id] that\nthe only purpose of Proposal 2 is to discriminate against minorities.” Id. (citing various\nmotivations of Proposal 2’s chief supporters that were not racially discriminatory).\nThe district court’s conclusions are correct. “[A]bsent a referendum that facially\ndiscriminates racially, or one where although facially neutral, the only possible rationale\nis racially motivated, a district court cannot inquire into the electorate’s motivations in\nan equal protection clause context.” Arthur v. Toledo, 782 F.2d 565, 574 (6th Cir. 1986).\nThus, no heightened level of scrutiny need be applied to Proposal 2, and under rational\nbasis review, Proposal 2 is easily justifiable. Proposal 2 does not violate the Equal\nProtection Clause under the conventional analysis. See Brown, 674 F.3d at 1135;\nWilson, 122 F.3d at 701; Coral Constr., 235 P.3d at 957.\n\n                                            V.\n\n       As a last matter, I have no disagreement with the majority’s treatment of the\nprocedural issues discussed in Part II.B and C.\n\n                                           VI.\n\n       For these reasons, I would conclude that Proposal 2 does not violate the Equal\nProtection Clause of the United States Constitution under either a political restructuring\ntheory or traditional theory of equal protection. Accordingly, I would affirm the\njudgment of the district court.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;     Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.

That alone can hardly render the no-race-preference act\nunconstitutional. Whatever Hunter and Seattle hold, the Supreme Court cannot have\nintended such a ban.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;     Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.

I join Judge Gibbons’ dissent and write\nseparately to make a few additional points.\n\n       Today’s lawsuit transforms a potential virtue of affirmative action into a vice.\nIf there is one feature of affirmative-action programs that favors their constitutionality,\nit is that they grow out of the democratic process: the choice of a majority of a State’s\nresidents to create race-conscious admissions preferences at their public universities not\nto benefit a majority race but to facilitate the educational opportunities of disadvantaged\nracial minorities. Such democratically enacted programs, like all democratically enacted\nlaws, deserve initial respect in the courts, whether the particulars of a program satisfy\nthe Fourteenth Amendment, see Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306, 343 (2003), or\nviolate it, see Gratz v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 244, 275–76 (2003).\n\n       Yet this lawsuit turns these assumptions on their head. Democracy, it turns out,\nhas nothing to do with it. Plaintiffs insist that the Fourteenth Amendment’s guarantee\nof “equal protection of the laws” imposes two new rules on the policy debates\nsurrounding affirmative action in higher education. Rule one: States not only may\nestablish race-conscious affirmative-action programs, but they must do so to comply with\nthe Fourteenth Amendment. Rule two: even if the Fourteenth Amendment does not\nmandate that States establish affirmative-action programs at their public universities, it\nbars them from eliminating such programs through amendments to their constitutions.\n\n                                            A.\n\n       The first theory has little to recommend it, so little that the notion of mandatory\naffirmative action will come as a surprise to all Justices of the United States Supreme\nCourt, past and present, who have labored to determine whether state universities may\never enact such race-conscious programs under the United States Constitution. No\nJustice has taken the position that this recurring and vexing debate has all been a\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;      Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.            Page 60\n09-1111                      Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\ndistraction, one that overlooked the hidden truth that the Fourteenth Amendment\nnecessarily permits affirmative-action programs because it demands them.\n\n        Plaintiffs nonetheless insist that, “to the extent that [Proposal 2] . . . bar[s] race\nor gender conscious programs that would be permissible under the Fourteenth\nAmendment, it violates the Equal Protection Clause.” Coalition First Br. at 39; see also,\ne.g., Oral Arg. at 7:36–45. Yet the words of the one amendment (prohibiting the State\nfrom “discriminat[ing] . . . on the basis of race”) cannot violate the words of the other\n(“nor shall any State deny to any person . . . the equal protection of the laws”).\n\n        That is especially true in the context of classifications based on race, which are\npresumptively unconstitutional and which must run the gauntlet of strict scrutiny\nto survive. See Gratz, 539 U.S. at 270. If racial preferences are only occasionally and\nbarely constitutional, it cannot be the case that they are always required. A State that\nwishes to treat citizens of all races and nationalities equally “is free as a matter of its own\nlaw” to do so. Oregon v. Hass, 420 U.S. 714, 719 (1975). A first premise for resolving\nthis case is, and must be, that a State does not deny equal treatment by mandating it.\n\n                                              B.\n\n        The claimants’ other theory is of a piece. Having argued that the people of\nMichigan may not resort to the political process to eliminate racial preferences because\nthe Fourteenth Amendment demands them, the claimants alternatively insist that the\n“political process doctrine” of the Fourteenth Amendment separately prohibits the State\nfrom eliminating such programs already in existence by way of a state constitutional\namendment. Coalition First Br. at 27. That is not much of an alternative, as it comes to\nthe same end. More fundamentally, the argument misapprehends what States may do as\na matter of “politics” and “process.” Under the realm of politics, as just shown, the\npeople of a State may choose to end rather than continue affirmative-action programs.\nUnder the realm of process, the people of a State are free to use amendments to their\nconstitution—the same charter of state government that delegated power to create\naffirmative-action programs in the first place—as the vehicle for making the change.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;     Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.           Page 61\n09-1111                     Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\n       It is not that easy, plaintiffs insist. Even if States may do all of these things, the\npolitical-process doctrine prohibits States from altering their constitutions in a way that\nplaces “special burden[s] on racial minorities within the governmental process.” Hunter\nv. Erickson, 393 U.S. 385, 391 (1969); see Coalition First Br. at 28. Yes, of course. But\nMichigan did no such thing.\n\n       By any reasonable measure, Proposal 2 does not place “special burdens” on racial\nminorities. It bans “discriminat[ing] against, or grant[ing] preferential treatment to, any\nindividual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the\noperation of public employment, public education, or public contracting.” Mich. Const.\nart. I, § 26. That is not a natural way to impose race-based burdens. The words of the\namendment place no burden on anyone, and indeed are designed to prohibit the State\nfrom burdening one racial group relative to another. All of this furthers the objectives\nof the Fourteenth Amendment, the same seed from which the political-process doctrine\nsprouted.\n\n       That the people of Michigan made this change through their Constitution, as\nopposed to state legislation or a new policy embraced by the governing boards at the\nthree state universities, does not impose a “special burden” on any racial minority.\nThere is nothing unusual about placing an equal-protection guarantee in a constitution.\nThat is where individual-liberty guarantees often go, and that after all is where the\nnational framers placed the federal counterpart. States need not place equal-protection\nguarantees at the structural location of the plaintiffs’ choosing, be it at the governing\nboards of each university, the faculty of each university or the admissions office of each\nuniversity. Instead of neutralizing the political process, that approach would skew it.\n\n       What else at any rate could the people of Michigan have done? Keep in mind\nthat Proposal 2 applies not just to “public education” but also to “public employment”\nand to “public contracting.” Neither the governing boards of the universities nor the\nuniversities’ faculties nor for that matter each university’s admissions committee\noversees “public employment” or “public contracting” for the entire State. And the\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;     Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.         Page 62\n09-1111                     Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nMichigan Constitution prohibits the legislature from interfering in “the university’s\nsphere of educational authority.” Federated Publ’ns, Inc. v. Bd. of Trustees of Mich.\nState Univ., 594 N.W.2d 491, 497 (Mich. 1999). That left the State just one option for\naddressing racial preferences in all three areas: a statewide constitutional amendment.\nThis time-hallowed option places no special burden on proponents of affirmative action\nother than the customary burdens placed on anyone seeking to pass a constitutional\namendment.\n\n       The charge that the Federal Constitution prohibits States from banning racial\npreferences through amendments to their constitutions also fails to account for one of the\nmost fervent criticisms of state constitutions: They are too easy to change. The\nreferendum option facilitates change, as it makes altering the constitution as easy as (if\nnot easier than) altering legislation. After obtaining the requisite number of signatures\n(10% of the votes cast in the last gubernatorial election, see Mich. Const. art. XII, § 2),\nthe proponents of change need to obtain just 51% of a popular vote and are spared the\nneed to obtain the consent of the Governor and each house of the legislature. That is\nwhy the former Chief Justice of the California Supreme Court, faced with an equally\nvariable state constitution, decries the “perpetual instability of California’s state\nconstitutional law.” See Ronald M. George, Keynote Address, 62 Stan. L. Rev. 1515,\n1516 (2010).\n\n       Nothing prevents proponents of affirmative action from borrowing a page from\nthe same playbook in a future state referendum—unless, that is, 51% of Michigan voters\ndo not support the change. But if the caveat applies, the answer is not to resort to the\npolitical-process doctrine, the goal of which is to promote neutral democratic means and\nends, not to ban them. The short of it is that a bare requirement of a 51% popular vote\nas a vehicle for constitutional change is as good as it gets—at least from the perspective\nof proponents of future change. States may create higher, super-majority impediments\nto change. But they cannot create super-minority facilitations of it.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;     Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.           Page 63\n09-1111                     Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\n       Of the 51 constitutions in this country, moreover, the most difficult to change is\nthe Federal Constitution, which requires three-quarters of the States to ratify an\namendment. Now that is a difficult charter to change. Is it really possible that the same\nFederal Constitution that is nearly impervious to change precludes a State from housing\nits elimination of racial preferences in a constitution that requires just a 51% popular\nvote for passage? Doubtful.\n\n       Odder still, the United States Constitution generally does not meddle in the way\nthe States structure their governments. Sailors v. Bd. of Educ. of Kent Cnty., 387 U.S.\n105, 109 (1967). If they want a unicameral legislature, they can have it. See Neb. Const.\nart. III, § 1. And if they want direct democracy through constitutional and legislative\nreferenda, they can have it. Pac. States Tel. & Tel. Co. v. Oregon, 223 U.S. 118, 151\n(1912). If even the “republican form of government” guarantee is unenforceable, see\nU.S. Const. art. IV, § 4; Luther v. Borden, 48 U.S. (7 How.) 1, 42 (1849), it is surely the\ncase that the Fourteenth Amendment does not dictate the level of government at which\na State must enact a statewide ban on race discrimination.\n\n       It is worth considering plaintiffs’ alternative to this straightforward interpretation\nof the Fourteenth Amendment, the one every other court to face this issue has embraced,\nincluding our own when the plaintiffs sought to prevent Proposal 2 from going into\neffect in 2007. See Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action v. Granholm, 473 F.3d 237, 250\n(6th Cir. 2006); Coal. for Econ. Equity v. Wilson, 122 F.3d 692, 707 (9th Cir. 1997);\nCoral Constr., Inc. v. City & Cnty. of San Francisco, 235 P.3d 947, 960 (Cal. 2010).\nInstead of allowing the people of Michigan to end racial preferences through a statewide\npopular vote that amends the State Constitution, they insist the Fourteenth Amendment\npermits this change in one, and only one, way: multiple elections over multiple years.\nTheir theory contains several premises and several steps. One: any change may not\ncome through legislation because the Michigan Constitution puts the governing boards\nat each of the three public universities (Michigan, Michigan State and Wayne State) in\ncharge of educational policy, including apparently admissions policies, at each\nuniversity. Two: there are eight members of the Board at each university, and two of\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;     Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.        Page 64\n09-1111                     Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nthem stand for election every two years in statewide elections. Three: these statewide\nelections are the only neutral way to permit opponents of racial preferences to establish\nsuch an admissions policy. Four: after eight years, the opponents of racial preferences\nwill have had a chance to replace all members of the three Boards and presumably by\nthen, if not a few years before, would have the votes to end racial preferences\nat each university. And all of this explains only the rules for Michigan’s three\npublic universities. Anyone wishing to change admissions policies at Michigan’s other\ninstitutions of higher education faces an equally elaborate process. See Mich. Const. art.\nVIII, § 6 (authorizing the elected governor to appoint members of regional university\nboards to staggered eight-year terms); id. § 7 (authorizing locally elected boards to\nregulate community and junior colleges).\n\n       Whatever else one might say about the path on which this interpretation of the\nFourteenth Amendment takes us, it does not follow Occam’s razor in getting there. Yet\nneedless complexity is the least of the problems raised by this theory. How would the\nsupporters of Proposal 2 end racial preferences in public contracting and public\nemployment, which the university boards do not oversee? Does plaintiffs’ theory mean\nopponents of racial preferences must do both—win a statewide referendum and win\ntwenty-four statewide individual elections? Must proponents of affirmative action do\nthe same to reverse a contrary policy? Even if we ignore public contracting and\nemployment, who says a single 10% petition drive and a single 51% popular vote make\nlife more difficult for proponents of change than twenty-four statewide elections (among\nothers) for twenty-four individuals over an eight-year period? Where are the empirical\nstudies to prove the point?      Should not the proponents of invalidating a state\nconstitutional amendment be expected to prove the premise before the court accepts this\ninvitation? Could the supporters of Proposal 2 amend the Michigan Constitution to\nremove control of the universities from their governing boards and place it in the hands\nof the legislature? What then? Would statewide legislation banning (or reinstating)\nracial preferences be permissible? There are many questions here, and all of them\ncounsel against adopting this disfiguring interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;     Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.          Page 65\n09-1111                     Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\n        I do not doubt that Proposal 2 places a burden on proponents of affirmative\naction: They no longer have access to it, and they must amend the constitution to get it\nback. But the Fourteenth Amendment insists only that all participants in the debate have\nan equal shot. It does not ensure victory for one side or the other in this or that policy\ndebate. It would be paradoxical if something called the “political process doctrine”\ninsulated one side of a vigorous policy debate from a timeless rule of politics: win some,\nlose some. Winning some and losing some, as it happens, is just what has occurred\nacross the country with statewide ballots seeking to eliminate racial preferences. While\nsome initiatives have prevailed (California, Michigan, Nebraska and Washington), others\nhave failed (Colorado, Missouri and Oklahoma).            See Tim Hoover, Amendment\n46 Fizzling Out, Denver Post, Nov. 7, 2008 at B4.\n\n        Another oddity of this theory is that it would apply even if the Michigan\nConstitution eliminated affirmative-action programs in another way. In 1963, the\npeople of Michigan passed an earlier amendment to their Constitution, one that\nprohibited race discrimination by governmental entities. See Mich. Const. art. I, § 2. In\nview of this prohibition, a Michigan resident surely would have the right to bring a claim\nthat the State Constitution’s existing prohibition on race-based classifications bars a\nsystem of racial preferences in admissions, contracting and employment. If there is one\nthing that the closely divided decisions in Bakke, Gratz and Grutter illustrate, it is that\nthe Michigan Supreme Court could reasonably invalidate, or reasonably uphold, racial\npreferences under the State Constitution’s existing equal-protection guarantee. A\ndecision invalidating racial preferences, however, would have precisely the same effect\nas Proposal 2, establishing that the Constitution bars racial preferences and placing the\nonus on proponents of racial preferences to alter the Constitution. The claimants have\nno answer to this point. If Proposal 2 violates the political-process doctrine, so too\nwould a decision by the Michigan Supreme Court that comes to the same end through\na permissible interpretation of the 1963 equal-protection guarantee.\n\n        The same is true of a state court’s decision to apply strict scrutiny to racial\npreferences. Most state constitutions, including all of the ones in our circuit, mirror this\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;       Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.           Page 66\n09-1111                       Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\naspect of the Federal Constitution: They require strict scrutiny of governmental\nclassifications based on race. See, e.g., D.F. v. Codell, 127 S.W.3d 571, 575 (Ky. 2003);\nHarvey v. State, Dep’t of Mgmt. & Budget, Bureau of Retirement Servs., 664 N.W.2d\n767, 770 (Mich. 2003); State v. Thompson, 767 N.E.2d 251, 255–56 (Ohio 2002); State\nv. Tester, 879 S.W.2d 823, 828 (Tenn. 1994). One might think these constitutional\nsafeguards would be secure from second-guessing by federal courts, but they are not\nunder plaintiffs’ theory. For they impose special burdens on some policies that might\nbenefit racial minorities in the admissions process without imposing the same burdens\non policies that benefit groups categorized along non-suspect lines, such as children of\nalumni, athletes or band members. Under each of these state constitutions, a member of\na racial minority who wants a governmental privilege must identify a compelling state\ninterest that supports its provision. If plaintiffs are correct, that reality dooms the States’\nequal protection clauses, even though the federal Equal Protection Clause requires no\nless. That cannot be right.\n\n        The Court’s decision in Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620 (1996), which did not\nconcern racial classifications, holds nothing to the contrary. Colorado enacted a\nconstitutional amendment prohibiting the State and its municipalities from enacting laws\nbanning discrimination on the basis of “homosexual, lesbian or bisexual orientation,\nconduct, practices or relationships.” Id. at 624. In invalidating the amendment, the\nCourt noted that the amendment “impos[es] a broad and undifferentiated disability” (the\ninability to seek protection from discrimination at the state or local level) “on a single\nnamed group” (gays and lesbians). Id. at 632. The amendment “was inexplicable by\nanything but animus toward the class it affects” and therefore “lack[ed] a rational\nrelationship to legitimate state interests.” Id. By contrast, Proposal 2 serves a rational\ninterest, indeed a compelling one: eliminating racial classifications in admissions, public\nemployment and public contracting.\n\n        The Court’s decisions in Hunter and Seattle, which did concern racial\nclassifications, also hold nothing to the contrary. The laws invalidated in both cases\nwere designed to disadvantage one minority group—African-Americans—and no other.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;     Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.         Page 67\n09-1111                     Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nIn Hunter, the City of Akron in 1964 amended its charter to require that any housing\nordinance forbidding discrimination “on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin\nor ancestry” be approved in a city-wide referendum before going into effect, an\namendment designed to hinder only the political goals of the African-American\ncommunity. See 393 U.S. at 391; id. at 394, 395 (Harlan, J., concurring). In Seattle, the\nState of Washington in 1978 enacted a law forbidding school districts from requiring\nchildren to be bused to schools distant from their homes, but made exceptions for busing\ndesigned for virtually every purpose except racial integration. 458 U.S. at 462–63. It\nthus “remove[d] the authority to address a racial problem—and only a racial\nproblem—from [school boards].” Id. at 474.\n\n       The same cannot be said of Proposal 2. In the first place, Proposal 2 removes\nracial preferences, not anti-discrimination measures. To the extent Proposal 2 has any\neffect on the political structures through which a group may acquire special treatment\nin university admissions, it is a leveling one. The law imposes no “special burden[s]”\non anyone, Hunter, 393 U.S. at 391, but instead eliminates “pernicious” “racial\nclassifications,” Gratz, 539 U.S. at 270. If ever there were a neutral, non-special burden,\nthat is it. The Equal Protection Clause freely permits governments to ban racial\ndiscrimination, as here, but it does not freely permit them to ban all bans on racial\ndiscrimination, as in Hunter and Seattle.\n\n       In the second place, Proposal 2 prohibits discrimination not just on the basis of\nrace but also on the basis of sex, ethnicity and national origin. To the extent it\ndisadvantages anyone, it disadvantages groups that together account for a majority of\nMichigan’s population, not this or that racial minority. It “make[s] little sense to apply\n‘political structure’ equal protection principles where the group alleged to face special\npolitical burdens itself constitutes a majority of the electorate.” Coal. for Econ. Equity,\n122 F.3d at 704.\n\n       Nor is it even clear which groups—men or women, this racial group or that\none—Proposal 2 helps and hurts, or when each group will be affected. Perhaps there\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;     Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.          Page 68\n09-1111                     Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nwas a time when a ban on gender-based preferences favored men. Perhaps the opposite\nis true today, as female high school students increasingly outperform their male\nclassmates. See, e.g., Rob Mank, Men Far More Likely to Benefit from Affirmative\nAction     in   College      Admissions,        CBS     Ne ws,     Sept.     26,    2011,\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20111646-503544.html. A ban on racial\npreferences likewise may favor some racial groups today and others tomorrow. The one\nthing we know for sure is that race-based programs need not, indeed may not, last into\nperpetuity, as the Court assumed that all such programs would come to an end within\n25 years—namely by 2028. See Grutter, 539 U.S. at 343. It is the essence of democracy\nto allow the people to use their own judgment in deciding when a complicated policy has\noutlived its usefulness, and nothing in Grutter required the States to wait until 2028 to\nmake that choice.\n\n       It is no answer to say that Michigan may adopt a statewide policy regarding\nracial preferences if, and only if, they adopt statewide policies on other admissions\npolicies—from how much weight to give Advanced Placement courses to how many\nzoology students to admit to how to treat children of alumni to how to treat football\nplayers, oboists or thespians. The Equal Protection Clause reflects our collective\njudgment that generalizations based on race are dubious in the near term and destructive\nin the long term, making it appropriate to treat racial proxies, which are presumptively\nunconstitutional, differently from other more-pedestrian distinctions, which are\npresumptively constitutional. Gratz, 539 U.S. at 270. It does not bar Michigan from\nrecognizing the same.\n\n       Any doubt that Hunter and Seattle support rather than undermine the\nconstitutionality of Proposal 2 is removed by Seattle, the last of the two decisions. In\nSeattle, Justice Powell, no stranger to affirmative-action debates, raised the concern that\nthe majority’s reasoning meant that, “if the admissions committee of a state law school\ndeveloped an affirmative-action plan that came under fire, the Court apparently would\nfind it unconstitutional for any higher authority to intervene unless that authority\ntraditionally dictated admissions policies.” 458 U.S. at 499 n.14 (Powell, J., dissenting).\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;     Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.          Page 69\n09-1111                     Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nNo worries, the majority responded: The problem with Washington’s anti-busing\ninitiative was “the burden it impose[d] on minority participation in the political process,”\nid. at 480 n.23, a consideration that made Justice Powell’s hypothetical “entirely\nunrelated to this case” because it had “nothing to do with the ability of minorities to\nparticipate in the process of self-government.” Id. If the Court thought that the removal\nof an affirmative-action policy was “entirely unrelated” to the concerns in Seattle, then\nI am hard-pressed to understand why the same is not true in this instance—and just as\nhard-pressed to understand how anyone can insist our hands are tied in today’s case.\nThe companion political-process case to Seattle, handed down the same day, confirmed\nthe point. The “Equal Protection Clause,” it made clear, “is not violated by the mere\nrepeal of race-related legislation or policies that were not required by the Federal\nConstitution in the first place.” Crawford v. Bd. of Educ. of Los Angeles, 458 U.S. 527,\n538–39 (1982). That is all that happened here. The majority seeing it differently, I\nrespectfully dissent.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;     Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.         Page 70\n09-1111                     Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\n                                    ______________\n\n                                       DISSENT\n                                    ______________\n\n       GRIFFIN, Circuit Judge, dissenting. Today’s decision is the antithesis of the\nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The post-Civil War amendment\nthat guarantees equal protection to persons of all races has now been construed as\nbarring a state from prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race. As the United States\nSupreme Court has observed, “[i]t would be paradoxical to conclude that by adopting the\nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the voters of the State thereby\nhad violated it.” Crawford v. Bd. of Educ., 458 U.S. 527, 535 (1982). Yet the majority\nhas effectively so concluded in striking down a portion of Michigan’s Proposal 2 (MICH.\nCONST. art. I, § 26 ). I join Judge Gibbons’ dissent, except for Section III, and write\nseparately to emphasize that the “political structure” doctrine is an anomaly incompatible\nwith the Equal Protection Clause. I urge the Supreme Court to consign this misguided\ndoctrine to the annals of judicial history.\n\n       The Equal Protection Clause provides that “[n]o State shall . . . deny to any\nperson within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” U.S. CONST. amend. 14,\n§ 1. Under its application, a state law is subject to strict scrutiny when it explicitly\ndistinguishes between individuals on the basis of race. See Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of\nEduc., 476 U.S. 267, 279–80 (1986) (plurality opinion); Personnel Adm’r of Mass. v.\nFeeney, 442 U.S. 256, 272 (1979); McLaughlin v. Florida, 379 U.S. 184, 191–92 (1964).\nSuch express racial classifications are suspect because, “[a]bsent searching judicial\ninquiry[,] . . . there is simply no way of determining what classifications are ‘benign’ or\n‘remedial’ and what classifications are in fact motivated by illegitimate notions of racial\ninferiority or simple racial politics.” City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469,\n493 (1989) (plurality opinion); see also id. at 520 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).\n\n       Facially neutral laws, on the other hand, warrant strict scrutiny only if they are\n“motivated by a racial purpose or object,” Miller v. Johnson, 515 U.S. 900, 913 (1995),\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;      Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.          Page 71\n09-1111                      Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nor are “‘unexplainable on grounds other than race.’” Shaw v. Reno, 509 U.S. 630, 643\n(1993) (quoting Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 266\n(1977)); see also Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 242 (1976) (“Standing alone, . . .\n[disproportionate impact on a racial minority] does not trigger the rule that racial\nclassifications are to be subjected to the strictest scrutiny and are justifiable only by the\nweightiest of considerations.”) (internal citation omitted).\n\n        The ill-advised “political structure” doctrine employed by the majority in this\ncase was crafted by the Supreme Court more than one hundred years after the ratification\nof the Fourteenth Amendment. Before today, the cases fitting its mold numbered three:\nHunter v. Erickson, 393 U.S. 385 (1969); Washington v. Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1,\n458 U.S. 457 (1982); and Lee v. Nyquist, 318 F. Supp. 710 (W.D. N.Y. 1970)\n(three-judge court), summarily aff’d, 402 U.S. 935 (1971). The infrequent use of the\ndoctrine is not surprising given its lack of a constitutional basis. It replaces actual\nevidence of racial motivation with a judicial presumption and, hence, is an aberration\ninconsistent with the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n        The laws at issue in Hunter and Seattle were both facially neutral. See Hunter,\n393 U.S. at 391 (noting that “the law on its face treats Negro and white, Jew and gentile\nin an identical manner”); Seattle, 458 U.S. at 471 (referring to the “facial neutrality” of\nthe state legislation). Yet, in each case, the Supreme Court held that strict scrutiny\napplied without any need for the respective plaintiffs to show that the laws were enacted\nas a result of discriminatory intent or were inexplicable on grounds other than race. It\nsimply declared that there was an “‘explicitly racial classification’” where the prior law\ninured to the benefit of racial minorities, and the newly enacted law moved the\napplicable decisionmaking process to a more remote level of government. Seattle, 458\nU.S. at 468 (quoting Hunter, 393 U.S. at 389).\n\n        These decisions are justifiably characterized as “jurisprudential enigmas that\nseem to lack any coherent relationship to constitutional doctrine as a whole.” David J.\nBaron, The Promise of Cooley’s Cities: Traces of Local Constitutionalism, 147 U.

Rev. 2409, 2476 (2003) (“It\nis therefore easy to view these cases as constitutional oddballs, difficult or impossible\nto explain in light of accepted equal protection principles.”). “In the absence of a federal\nconstitutional violation requiring race-specific remedies, a policy of strict racial\nneutrality by a State . . . violate[s] no federal constitutional principle.” Seattle, 458 U.S.\nat 491 (Powell, J., dissenting).\n\n        Moreover, as first noted by Justice Powell, the political structure doctrine\nunconstitutionally suspends our normal and necessary democratic process by prohibiting\nchange when a lower level of state government has acted in a way that arguably benefits\nracial minorities. Id. at 494–96 (Powell, J., dissenting) (“The political process in\nWashington, as in other States, permits persons who are dissatisfied at a local level to\nappeal to the state legislature or the people of the State for redress,” but “[u]nder today’s\ndecision this heretofore undoubted supreme authority of a State’s electorate is to be\ncurtailed whenever a school board—or indeed any other state board or local\ninstrumentality—adopts a race-specific program that arguably benefits racial\nminorities.”).\n\n        In addition, the majority in the present case eschews a “traditional” Equal\nProtection Clause analysis by deeming its well-established principles unnecessary to the\nlegal equation. I respectfully disagree and would hold that by conventional equal\nprotection standards, Proposal 2 passes constitutional muster. “A law that prohibits the\nState from classifying individuals by race or gender a fortiori does not classify\nindividuals by race or gender.” Coal. for Econ. Equity v. Wilson, 122 F.3d 692, 702\n(9th Cir. 1997). In my view, racial discrimination and racial preference are synonymous.\nIn the realm of a finite number of classroom seats, the preference given one person based\nupon his race is the discrimination inflicted upon another based upon his.\nDiscrimination on the basis of race is racial discrimination, whether it is euphemistically\ncalled a “preference” or something else. In affirming California’s substantially similar\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;     Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.          Page 73\n09-1111                     Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nProposition 209, which banned race and gender preferences, the Ninth Circuit in Wilson\neloquently stated:\n\n        When the government prefers individuals on account of their race or\n        gender, it correspondingly disadvantages individuals who fortuitously\n        belong to another race or to the other gender. “Consistency does\n        recognize that any individual suffers an injury when he or she is\n        disadvantaged by the government because of his or her race.” Adarand,\n        515 U.S. at 230, 115 S. Ct. at 2114. Proposition 209 amends the\n        California Constitution simply to prohibit state discrimination against or\n        preferential treatment to any person on account of race or gender.\n        Plaintiffs charge that this ban on unequal treatment denies members of\n        certain races and one gender equal protection of the laws. If merely\n        stating this alleged equal protection violation does not suffice to refute\n        it, the central tenet of the Equal Protection Clause teeters on the brink of\n        incoherence.\n\nWilson, 122 F.3d at 702; cf. Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action v. Granholm, 473 F.3d\n237, 250 (6th Cir. 2006) (“If the Equal Protection Clause gives heightened scrutiny to\n[gender-based classifications], a State acts well within the letter and spirit of the Clause\nwhen it eliminates the risk of any such scrutiny by removing gender classifications\naltogether in its admissions programs.”) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n        In a footnote, the majority superficially acknowledges, but does not discuss, the\ncircuit split it creates in declining to follow the Ninth Circuit decisions upholding the\nconstitutionality of analogous Proposition 209. See Wilson and Coal. to Defend\nAffirmative Action v. Brown, 674 F.3d 1128 (9th Cir. 2012). I would adopt the\npersuasive reasoning of Wilson and hold that, in amending their state constitution to\nprohibit racial discrimination and “preferential treatment,” the citizens of Michigan did\nnot violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, but rather\nenshrined its principles into the Michigan Constitution.           Like Proposition 209,\nMichigan’s proscription of racial preference, “as a matter of law and logic, does not\nviolate the Equal Protection Clause in any conventional sense.” Wilson, 122 F.3d at 702.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;      Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.          Page 74\n09-1111                      Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\n        Finally, in an effort to avoid confusion and aid further review, I note the limits\nof the majority’s holding. My colleagues do not declare MICH. CONST. art. I, § 26\nunconstitutional in its entirety. Rather, their holding is limited to “racial minorities” and\nour court’s declaration “[f]inding those provisions of Proposal 2 affecting Michigan’s\npublic colleges and universities unconstitutional . . . .” Thus, the other provisions of\nMICH. CONST. art. I, § 26 that prohibit discrimination and preferential treatment on the\nbasis of sex, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public employment, public\neducation, and public contracting, survive this court’s ruling. Further, the Michigan\nconstitutional prohibitions against discrimination or preferential treatment based on race,\nexcept in the operation of public colleges and universities regarding “racial minorities,”\nremain in effect. In this regard, art I, § 26(7) contains a severability clause: “Any\nprovision held invalid shall be severable from the remaining portions of this section.”\n\n        I caution that because the term “racial minorities” is not defined by the majority\nopinion, the class of persons benefitting from it is unclear and will be a potent source of\nlitigation were it allowed to stand. Under today’s en banc decision, not all persons are\nentitled to the equal protection of the laws.\n\n        For these reasons, I would affirm the district court and therefore respectfully\ndissent.\n\f",

A student seeking to have her family’s alumni connections\nconsidered in her application to one of Michigan’s esteemed public universities could\ndo one of four things to have the school adopt a legacy-conscious admissions policy: she\ncould lobby the admissions committee, she could petition the leadership of the\nuniversity, she could seek to influence the school’s governing board, or, as a measure of\nlast resort, she could initiate a statewide campaign to alter the state’s constitution. The\nsame cannot be said for a black student seeking the adoption of a constitutionally\npermissible race-conscious admissions policy. That student could do only one thing to\neffect change: she could attempt to amend the Michigan Constitution—a lengthy,\nexpensive, and arduous process—to repeal the consequences of Proposal 2. The\nexistence of such a comparative structural burden undermines the Equal Protection\nClause’s guarantee that all citizens ought to have equal access to the tools of political\nchange. We therefore REVERSE the judgment of the district court on this issue and find\nProposal 2 unconstitutional. We AFFIRM the denial of the University Defendants’\nmotion to be dismissed as parties, and we AFFIRM the grant of the Cantrell Plaintiffs’\nmotion for summary judgment as to Russell.\n\n                                            I.\n\nA. Factual Background\n\n       These appeals are before us as an epilogue to the long-running battle over the use\nof race-conscious admissions policies at Michigan’s public colleges and universities.\nThe saga began during the 1960s and 1970s, when racial minorities first successfully\nlobbied for the adoption of such policies. They remained largely in place until\nchallenges in the late 1990s culminated in the Supreme Court’s decisions in Gratz v.\nBollinger, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130154\"><a href=\"/opinion/130154/gratz-v-bollinger/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">244</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2003), and Grutter v.

Grutter, 539 U.S. at 334. But the Court allowed\nuniversities to continue “consider[ing] race or ethnicity more flexibly as a ‘plus’ factor\nin the context of individualized consideration,” along with other relevant factors, id., a\nholding we do not today address or upset.\n\n         Following these decisions, Ward Connerly, a former University of California\nRegent who had championed a similar proposition in California, and Jennifer Gratz, the\nlead plaintiff in Gratz, mobilized to place on Michigan’s November 2006 statewide\nballot a proposal to amend the Michigan Constitution “to prohibit all sex- and race-based\npreferences in public education, public employment, and public contracting . . . .”\nOperation King’s Dream v. Connerly, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1460182\"><a href=\"/opinion/1460182/operation-kings-dream-v-connerly/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">584</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 586 (6th Cir. 2007). The\ninitiative—officially designated Proposal 06-2 but commonly known as “Proposal\n2”—sought “to amend the State Constitution to ban affirmative action programs.” See\nNotice     of   State   Proposals     for   November       7,   2006    General     Election,\nhttp://www.michigan.gov/documents/sos/ED-138_State_Prop_11-06_174276_7.pdf, at\n5 (last visited May 22, 2012). Though Proposal 2 “found its way on the ballot through\nmethods that undermine[d] the integrity and fairness of our democratic processes,”\nOperation King’s Dream, 501 F.3d at 591, once there, it garnered enough support among\nMichigan voters to pass by a margin of 58% to 42%.\n\n         Proposal 2 amended the Michigan Constitution to include the following\nprovisions, entitled “Affirmative action,” in Article I:\n\n         (1) The University of Michigan, Michigan State University, Wayne State\n         University, and any other public college or university, community\n         college, or school district shall not discriminate against, or grant\n         preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race,\n         sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public\n         employment, public education, or public contracting.\n         (2) The state shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment\n         to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or\n         national origin in the operation of public employment, public education,\n         or public contracting.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;      Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.                Page 6\n09-1111                      Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\n        (3) For the purposes of this section “state” includes, but is not necessarily\n        limited to, the state itself, any city, county, any public college, university,\n        or community college, school district, or other political subdivision or\n        governmental instrumentality of or within the State of Michigan not\n        included in sub-section 1.\n\nMich. Const. art. I, § 26. Proposal 2 took effect in December 2006 and wrought two\nsignificant changes to the admissions policies at Michigan’s public colleges and\nuniversities. First, it eliminated the consideration of “race, sex, color, ethnicity, or\nnational origin” in individualized admissions decisions, modifying policies in place for\nnearly a half-century. No other admissions criterion—for example, grades, athletic\nability, geographic diversity, or family alumni connections—suffered the same fate.\nSecond, Proposal 2 entrenched this prohibition at the state constitutional level, thus\npreventing public colleges and universities or their boards from revisiting this\nissue—and only this issue—without repeal or modification of article I, section 26 of the\nMichigan Constitution.\n\nB. Procedural History\n\n        The litigation surrounding Proposal 2 has been lengthy and complex. On\nNovember 8, 2006, the day after Proposal 2 passed, a collection of interest groups and\nindividuals, including the Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, Integration and\nImmigration Rights and Fight for Equality By Any Means Necessary (“Coalition\nPlaintiffs”), filed suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of\nMichigan. They named as defendants then-Governor Jennifer Granholm, the Regents\nof the University of Michigan, the Board of Trustees of Michigan State University, and\nthe Board of Governors of Wayne State University (“University Defendants”), and\nalleged that the provisions of Proposal 2 affecting public colleges and universities\nviolated the United States Constitution and federal statutory law. The Coalition\nPlaintiffs limited their request for relief to Proposal 2 as it applies to public education,\nand did not challenge its constitutionality as it applies to public employment or public\ncontracting. About a month later, the Michigan Attorney General (“Attorney General”)\nfiled a motion to intervene as a defendant, which the district court granted. Shortly\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;     Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.           Page 7\n09-1111                     Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nthereafter, Eric Russell, then an applicant to the University of Michigan Law School, and\nToward A Fair Michigan (“TAFM”), a non-profit corporation formed to ensure\nimplementation of Proposal 2, also filed a motion to intervene in the litigation.\n\n       On December 19, 2006, a group of faculty members and prospective and current\nstudents at the University of Michigan (“Cantrell Plaintiffs”) filed a separate but similar\nsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan against\nGranholm. This lawsuit also limited its challenge to Proposal 2 as it applies to public\neducation.\n\n       That same day, the district court issued what was, in effect, a preliminary\ninjunction, postponing the application of Proposal 2 to the universities’ admissions and\nfinancial-aid policies until July 1, 2007, which was the conclusion of the 2006-2007\nadmissions and financial-aid cycle. The district court’s order stemmed from a stipulation\namong the University Defendants, Coalition Plaintiffs, Granholm, and the Attorney\nGeneral consenting to the injunction.

On October 17,\n2007, the University Defendants filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that they were\nnot necessary parties to the litigation. On November 30, 2007, the Attorney General\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;     Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.

Russell and the Cantrell Plaintiffs likewise\nfiled motions for summary judgment the same day.\n\n       On March 18, 2008, the district court issued two orders addressing these motions.\nFirst, the court denied the University Defendants’ request to be dismissed as parties and\nthe Cantrell Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment.

Constitutionality of Proposal 2\n\n       The Equal Protection Clause provides that “[n]o state shall . . . deny to any\nperson . . . the equal protection of the laws.” U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The Plaintiffs\nargue that Proposal 2 violates this provision in two distinct ways. Both Plaintiff groups\nargue that Proposal 2 violates the Equal Protection Clause by impermissibly\nrestructuring the political process along racial lines (the “political process” argument),\nand the Coalition Plaintiffs additionally argue that Proposal 2 violates the Equal\nProtection Clause by impermissibly classifying individuals on the basis of race (the\n“traditional” argument).\n\n       In addressing the Plaintiffs’ arguments, we are neither required nor inclined to\nweigh in on the constitutional status or relative merits of race-conscious admissions\npolicies as such. This case does not present us with a second bite at Gratz and\nGrutter—despite the best efforts of the dissenters to take one anyway. This case instead\npresents us with a challenge to the constitutionality of a state amendment that alters the\nprocess by which supporters of permissible race-conscious admissions policies may seek\nto enact those policies. In other words, the sole issue before us is whether Proposal 2\nruns afoul of the constitutional guarantee of equal protection by removing the power of\nuniversity officials to even consider using race as a factor in admissions\ndecisions—something they are specifically allowed to do under Grutter.\n\n       We review de novo a district court’s grant of summary judgment and denial of\na motion for reconsideration of that decision.

Equal Protection Within the Political Process\n\n        The Equal Protection Clause “guarantees racial minorities the right to full\nparticipation in the political life of the community. It is beyond dispute . . . that given\nracial or ethnic groups may not be denied the franchise, or precluded from entering into\nthe political process in a reliable and meaningful manner.” Washington v. Seattle Sch.\nDist. No. 1, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110784\"><a href=\"/opinion/110784/washington-v-seattle-school-dist-no-1/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">457</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 467 (1982). But the Equal Protection Clause reaches even\nfurther, prohibiting “a political structure that treats all individuals as equals, yet more\nsubtly distorts governmental processes in such a way as to place special burdens on the\nability of minority groups to achieve beneficial legislation.” Id. (internal quotation\nmarks and citation omitted). “[T]he State may no more disadvantage any particular\ngroup by making it more difficult to enact legislation in its behalf than it may dilute any\nperson’s vote or give any group a smaller representation than another of comparable\nsize.” Hunter v. Erickson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107825\"><a href=\"/opinion/107825/hunter-v-erickson/\"><span class=\"volume\">393</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">385</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 393 (1969).\n\n        The Supreme Court’s statements in Hunter and Seattle emphasize that equal\nprotection of the laws is more than a guarantee of equal treatment under existing law.\nIt is also a guarantee that minority groups may meaningfully participate in the process\nof creating these laws and the majority may not manipulate the channels of change so\nas to place unique burdens on issues of importance to them. In effect, the political-\nprocess doctrine hews to the unremarkable notion that when two competitors are running\na race, one may not require the other to run twice as far or to scale obstacles not present\nin the first runner’s course. Ensuring the fairness of the political process is particularly\nimportant because an electoral minority is disadvantaged by definition in its attempts to\npass legislation; this is especially true of “discrete and insular minorities,” who face\nunique additional hurdles. Cf. United States v. Carolene Prods. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103017\"><a href=\"/opinion/103017/united-states-v-carolene-products-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">304</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">144</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 152\nn.4 (1938).\n\n        Ensuring a fair political process is nowhere more important than in education.\nEducation is the bedrock of equal opportunity and “the very foundation of good\ncitizenship.” Brown v.

Moreover,\nuniversities “represent the training ground for a large number of our Nation’s\nleaders. . . . [T]o cultivate a set of leaders with legitimacy in the eyes of the citizenry, it\nis necessary that the path to leadership be visibly open to talented and qualified\nindividuals of every race and ethnicity.” Id. at 332 (citation omitted). Therefore, in the\nhigh-stakes context of education, we must apply the political-process doctrine with the\nutmost rigor.\n\n        Of course, the Constitution does not protect minorities from political defeat:\nPolitics necessarily produces winners and losers. We must therefore have some way to\ndifferentiate between the constitutional and the impermissible. And Hunter and Seattle\nprovide just that. They set the benchmark for when the majority has not only won, but\nhas rigged the game to reproduce its success indefinitely.\n\n                a. Hunter v. Erickson\n\n        In Hunter, the citizens of Akron, Ohio, overturned a fair housing ordinance\nenacted by the City Council. 393 U.S. at 386. But the citizens did more than merely\nrepeal the ordinance; they amended the city charter through a referendum to require the\napproval of an electoral majority before any ordinance regulating real estate “on the\nbasis of race, color, religion, national origin or ancestry”—past or future—could take\neffect. Id. at 387, 390 n.6. In other words, only ordinances based on those factors\nrequired a city-wide majority; ordinances based on any other factor required just a vote\nby the City Council:\n\n        [T]he amendment changed the requirements for the adoption of one type\n        of local legislation: to enact an ordinance barring housing discrimination\n        on the basis of race or religion, proponents had to obtain the approval of\n        the City Council and of a majority of the voters citywide. To enact an\n        ordinance preventing housing discrimination on other grounds, or to\n        enact any other type of housing ordinance, proponents needed the support\n        of only the City Council.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;     Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.        Page 12\n09-1111                     Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nSeattle, 458 U.S. at 468 (describing Hunter). The referendum halted operation of the\nexisting fair housing ordinance, and more importantly for our purposes, erected a barrier\nto any similar ordinance in the future. Hunter, 393 U.S. at 389-90.\n\n       The Supreme Court found that the disparity between the process for enacting a\nfuture fair housing ordinance and the process for enacting any other housing ordinance\n“place[d] special burden[s] on racial minorities within the governmental process” by\nmaking it “substantially more difficult to secure enactment” of legislation that would be\nto their benefit. Id. at 390-91. While the enactment “treat[ed] Negro and white, Jew\nand gentile in an identical manner,” the Court found that “the reality is that the law’s\nimpact falls on the minority.” Id. at 391. That the law had been enacted via a popular\nreferendum did not save it from working “a real, substantial, and invidious denial of the\nequal protection of the laws.” Id. at 393.\n\n               b. Washington v. Seattle School District No. 1\n\n       In Seattle, a case that mirrors the one before us, the Supreme Court applied\nHunter to strike down a state statute, also enacted via a referendum, that prohibited\nracially integrative busing. Seattle, 458 U.S. at 463. Prior to the referendum, Seattle\nSchool District No. 1 (“District”) had implemented a school desegregation plan that\nmade extensive use of mandatory reassignments. Id. at 460-61. The District was under\nno obligation to adopt this plan: following Brown, school boards had been “charged with\nthe affirmative duty to take whatever steps might be necessary” to integrate schools that\nwere unconstitutionally segregated because of racial discrimination, Green v.

Rev. Code § 28A.26.010 (1981)). Though the initiative was\nframed as a general ban on mandatory busing, its myriad exceptions made its real effect\nthe elimination of school reassignments for racial purposes only, except where a court\nordered such reassignments to remedy unconstitutional segregation. Id. at 462-63.\nInitiative 350 made it on the Washington ballot and passed by a substantial margin. Id.\nat 463.\n\n          The Court found that Initiative 350, like the Akron city charter amendment,\nviolated the Equal Protection Clause. Id. at 487. The Court stated that its prior cases\nyielded a “simple but central principle”: while “laws structuring political institutions or\nallocating political power according to neutral principles” do not violate the Fourteenth\nAmendment, “a different analysis is required when the State allocates governmental\npower nonneutrally, by explicitly using the racial nature of a decision to determine the\ndecisionmaking process.” Seattle, 458 U.S. at 469-70. Echoing Hunter, the Court\nexplained that this distinct analysis is necessary because non-neutral allocations of power\n“place[] special burdens on racial minorities within the governmental process, thereby\nmaking it more difficult for certain racial and religious minorities than for other\nmembers of the community to achieve legislation that is in their interest.” Id. at 470\n(internal quotation marks, citations, and brackets omitted). The Court dismissed the\n\n\n\n\n          1\n          It bears repeating that the school board took this step in the absence of a court order or any\nunconstitutional discrimination whatsoever. The voluntary plan was an ameliorative measure intended to\nbenefit minority students; it was not a protective measure intended to shield minority students from de jure\ndiscrimination, which no court had found to exist. See Seattle, 458 U.S. at 460-61; see also infra Part\nII.A.3.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;      Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.           Page 14\n09-1111                      Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nargument that Initiative 350 was not intended to prevent busing for racially-integrative\npurposes, and explained why Initiative 350 violated this “simple but central” principle.\n\n        As a threshold matter, the Court concluded that the busing program, like the fair\nhousing ordinance in Hunter, “at bottom inures primarily to the benefit of the minority,\nand is designed for that purpose.” Id. at 472. The Court reasoned that while “white as\nwell as Negro children benefit from exposure to ethnic and racial diversity in the\nclassroom,” desegregation primarily benefits minority children because these children\n“can achieve their full measure of success only if they learn to function in—and are fully\naccepted by—the larger community. Attending an ethnically diverse school may help\naccomplish this goal by preparing minority children for citizenship in our pluralistic\nsociety.” Id. at 472-73 (internal quotation marks omitted). Because racial minorities\nhad reason to “consider busing for integration to be ‘legislation that is in their interest,’”\nthe “racial focus of Initiative 350 . . . suffice[d] to trigger application of the Hunter\ndoctrine.” Id. at 474 (quoting Hunter, 393 U.S. at 395 (Harlan, J., concurring)).\n\n        Having concluded that Initiative 350 targeted a busing program that “inures\nprimarily to the benefit of the minority,” the Court held that “the practical effect of\nInitiative 350 is to work a reallocation of power of the kind condemned in Hunter.” Id.\nAs the Court explained, Initiative 350 did more than merely repeal the busing program:\n\n        The initiative removes the authority to address a racial problem—and\n        only a racial problem—from the existing decisionmaking body, in such\n        a way as to burden minority interests. Those favoring the elimination of\n        de facto school segregation now must seek relief from the state\n        legislature, or from the statewide electorate. Yet authority over all other\n        student assignment decisions, as well as over most other areas of\n        educational policy, remains vested in the local school board. . . . As in\n        Hunter, then, the community’s political mechanisms are modified to\n        place effective decisionmaking authority over a racial issue at a different\n        level of government.\n\nId. By removing authority over busing for racial purposes from the school board and\nplacing it at a more remote level of government, Initiative 350 required “those\nchampioning school integration to surmount a considerably higher hurdle than persons\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;           Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.                    Page 15\n09-1111                           Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nseeking comparable legislative action,” and disadvantaged “those who would benefit\nfrom laws barring de facto desegregation as against those who . . . would otherwise\nregulate student assignment decisions.” Id. at 474-75 (alteration in original) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). Accordingly, the Court held that Initiative 350 violated the\nEqual Protection Clause. Id. at 470.\n\n         In sum, Hunter and Seattle require us to examine an enactment that changes the\ngovernmental decisionmaking process for legislation with a racial focus to determine if\nit improperly manipulates the channels for change.2 Seattle, 458 U.S. at 470, 485;\nHunter, 393 U.S. at 391; cf. Carolene Prods., 304 U.S. at 152 n.4 (noting that more\nexacting judicial scrutiny is required when the majority curtails “the operation of those\npolitical processes ordinarily to be relied upon to protect minorities”). To the extent that\nit does, we must strike down the enactment absent a compelling state interest.\n\n         2. Application of the Hunter/Seattle Test to Proposal 2\n\n         Hunter and Seattle thus expounded the rule that an enactment deprives minority\ngroups of the equal protection of the laws when it: (1) has a racial focus, targeting a\npolicy or program that “inures primarily to the benefit of the minority”; and\n(2) reallocates political power or reorders the decisionmaking process in a way that\nplaces special burdens on a minority group’s ability to achieve its goals through that\nprocess. See Seattle, 458 U.S. at 467, 472; Hunter, 393 U.S. at 391. Applying this rule\nhere, we conclude that Proposal 2 targets a program that “inures primarily to the benefit\nof the minority” and reorders the political process in Michigan in a way that places\nspecial burdens on racial minorities.\n\n\n\n\n         2\n           This holds true for enactments that make it more difficult for minorities to use the political\nprocess to obtain any sort of legislation that is in their interest—notwithstanding whether one characterizes\nsuch legislation as seeking protection against discrimination or, alternatively, preferential treatment. See\ninfra Part II.A.3.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;           Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.                    Page 16\n09-1111                           Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\n                  a. Racial Focus\n\n         The first prong of the Hunter/Seattle test requires us to determine whether\nProposal 2 has a “racial focus.” Seattle, 458 U.S. at 474. This inquiry turns on whether\nthe targeted policy or program, here holistic race-conscious admissions policies at public\ncolleges and universities, “at bottom inures primarily to the benefit of the minority, and\nis designed for that purpose.” Id. at 472. The targeted policy need not be for the sole\nbenefit of minorities, for “it is enough that minorities may consider [the now burdened\npolicy] to be ‘legislation that is in their interest.’” Id. at 474 (quoting Hunter, 393 U.S.\nat 395 (Harlan, J., concurring)).3\n\n         Seattle conclusively answers whether a law targeting policies that seek to\nfacilitate classroom diversity, as Proposal 2 does, has a racial focus. In Seattle, the Court\nobserved that programs intended to promote school diversity and further the education\nof minority children enable these students to “achieve their full measure of success.” Id.\nat 472-73. Such programs do so through “preparing minority children for citizenship in\nour pluralistic society, while . . . teaching members of the racial majority to live in\nharmony and mutual respect with children of minority heritage.” Id. at 473 (internal\nquotation marks and citation omitted). Accordingly, the Court noted that “desegregation\nof the public schools . . . at bottom inures primarily to the benefit of the minority . . . .”\nId. at 472. Because minorities could “consider busing for integration to be ‘legislation\nthat is in their interest,’” the Court concluded that Initiative 350’s effective repeal of\nsuch programs had a racial focus sufficient to “trigger application of the Hunter\ndoctrine.” Id. at 474.\n\n\n\n\n         3\n           The Attorney General contends that Hunter and Seattle not only require that the targeted\nlegislation has a racial focus, but that the new legislation be enacted with discriminatory intent. This\nrequirement has no basis in law. To the contrary, the Supreme Court has explicitly rejected such an\nargument. See Seattle, 458 U.S. at 485 (“We have not insisted on a particularized inquiry into motivation\nin all equal protection cases: ‘A racial classification, regardless of purported motivation, is presumptively\ninvalid and can be upheld only upon an extraordinary justification.’ And legislation of the kind challenged\nin Hunter similarly falls into an inherently suspect category.”) (quoting Personnel Adm’r of Mass. v.\nFeeney, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110098\"><a href=\"/opinion/110098/personnel-administrator-of-mass-v-feeney/\"><span class=\"volume\">442</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">256</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 272 (1979)).\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;     Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.          Page 17\n09-1111                     Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\n        The logic of the Court’s decision in Seattle applies with equal force here.\nProposal 2 targets race-conscious admissions policies that “promote[] ‘cross-racial\nunderstanding,’ help[] to break down racial stereotypes, and ‘enable[] students to better\nunderstand persons of different races.’” Grutter, 539 U.S. at 330 (alteration omitted)\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Just as an integrative busing program\nis designed to improve racial minorities’ representation at certain public schools, see\nSeattle, 458 U.S. at 461, race-conscious admissions policies are designed to increase\nracial minorities’ representation at institutions of higher education, see, e.g., Grutter,\n539 U.S. at 316, 328-33; Gratz, 539 U.S. at 253-56. There is no material difference\nbetween the enactment in Seattle and Proposal 2, as both targeted policies that benefit\nminorities by enhancing their educational opportunities and promoting classroom\ndiversity. Further, given that racial minorities lobbied for the implementation of the very\npolicies that Proposal 2 permanently eliminates, it is beyond question that Proposal 2\ntargets policies that “minorities may consider . . . [to be] in their interest.” Seattle,\n458 U.S. at 474. Therefore, Proposal 2 has a racial focus because race-conscious\nadmissions policies at Michigan’s public colleges and universities “inure[] primarily to\nthe benefit of the minority, and [are] designed for that purpose.” Id. at 472.\n\n        Seattle not only mandates our conclusion that Proposal 2 is racially focused, but\nit also dispels any notion that the benefit race-conscious admissions policies may confer\non the majority undercuts its “racial focus.”        Although it is true that increased\nrepresentation of racial minorities in higher education benefits all students, see Grutter,\n539 U.S. at 327-33; Seattle, 458 U.S. at 472-73, the Supreme Court has made clear that\nthese policies still have a racial focus. In Seattle, the Court recognized that it is “clear\nthat white as well as Negro children benefit from exposure to ethnic and racial diversity\nin the classroom.” Seattle, 458 U.S. at 472 (internal quotation marks omitted). But the\nSeattle Court found that the wider benefits of the busing plan did not serve to distinguish\nHunter, “for we may fairly assume that members of the racial majority both favored and\nbenefited from Akron’s fair housing ordinance.” Id. By the same token, the wider\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;           Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.                    Page 18\n09-1111                           Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nbenefits of race-conscious admissions policies do not undermine the conclusion that such\nadmissions policies “inure[] primarily to the benefit of the minority . . . .” Id.\n\n         Nor do policy arguments attacking the wisdom of race-conscious admissions\nprograms preclude our finding that these programs “inure[] primarily to the benefit of\nthe minority.” Id. Critics of affirmative action maintain that race-conscious admissions\npolicies actually harm minorities by stigmatizing minority students admitted into high-\ncaliber institutions through a perception that they lack sufficient qualifications; by\nimpeding the academic success of minority students admitted to institutions they are not\nqualified to attend; and by impairing the admissions prospects of traditionally higher-\nperforming minority groups, such as Asian-Americans. But the controversy surrounding\nthe policies that Proposal 2 targets is irrelevant as to whether Proposal 2 itself has a\nracial focus; rather, this controversy is a “matter[] to be resolved through the political\nprocess.” Id. at 474 (“It is undeniable that busing for integration . . . engenders\nconsiderably more controversy than does the sort of fair housing ordinance debated in\nHunter. But in the absence of a constitutional violation, the desirability and efficacy of\nschool desegregation are matters to be resolved through the political process.”). As in\nSeattle, “it is enough that minorities may consider [the repealed policy] to be ‘legislation\nthat is in their interest.’” Id. (quoting Hunter, 393 U.S. at 395 (Harlan, J., concurring)).\n\n         We find that the holistic race-conscious admissions policies now barred by\nProposal 2 inure primarily to the benefit of racial minorities, and that such groups\nconsider these policies to be in their interest. Indeed, we need not look further than the\napproved ballot language—characterizing Proposal 2 as an amendment “to ban\naffirmative action programs”—to confirm that this legislation targets race-conscious\nadmissions policies and, insofar as it prohibits consideration of applicants’ race in\nadmissions decisions, that it has a racial focus.4\n\n         4\n           It is of no consequence that Proposal 2, by its terms, purports to also prohibit preferences based\non sex, color, ethnicity, and national origin. As the primary dissent concedes in a self-defeating footnote,\nthe challenged amendment in Hunter also extended beyond race—covering color, religion, national origin,\nand ancestry as well. Here, as in Hunter, the clear focus of the challenged amendment is race. The history\nof Proposal 2 and its description on the ballot leave little doubt. Moreover, allowing drafters of racially-\nfocused legislation to evade the protections of the Fourteenth Amendment by nominally including more\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;         Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.           Page 19\n09-1111                         Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\n                 b. A Reordering of the Political Process That Burdens Racial Minorities\n\n        The second prong of the Hunter/Seattle test asks us to determine whether\nProposal 2 reallocates political power or reorders the political process in a way that\nplaces special burdens on racial minorities. See Seattle, 458 U.S. at 467; Hunter,\n393 U.S. at 391. We must first resolve (1) whether the affected admissions procedures\nlie within the “political process,” and then (2) whether Proposal 2 works a “reordering”\nof this political process in a way that imposes “special burdens” on racial minorities.\n\n                          i. Proposal 2’s Effect on a “Political Process”\n\n        The breadth of Proposal 2’s influence on a “political process” turns on the role\nthe popularly elected governing boards of the universities play in setting admissions\nprocedures. The key question is whether the boards had the power to alter the\nuniversities’ admissions policies prior to the enactment of Proposal 2. If the boards had\nthat power and could influence the use (or non-use) of race-conscious admissions\npolicies, then Proposal 2’s stripping of that power works a reordering of the political\nprocess because minorities can no longer seek to enact a type of legislation that is in\ntheir interest at the board level. But if board members lacked such power, because\npolicy decisions are actually under the control of politically unaccountable faculty\nmembers or admissions committees, then Proposal 2’s effect on the political process is\nnegligible.\n\n        This issue—whether the admissions policies affected by Proposal 2 are part of\na “political process”—was the subject of stark disagreement between the majority and\nthe dissent when this case was originally before a three-judge panel, and it continues to\nbe here. In supplemental briefing, the University Defendants clarified their admissions\npractices, undercutting the factual and legal basis of the panel dissent’s core contention\nthat Proposal 2 falls outside the political process. We examine the administrative\n\n\n\n\nthan one class of individuals would seem to elevate form at the expense of substance.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;           Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.

Const. art. VIII, § 5; see also id. § 6\n(allowing the establishment of other institutions of higher learning, such as Michigan’s\nother public colleges and universities, and affording their governing boards similar\ncontrol).

Mich. Const. art. VIII, § 5; see also id. § 6. The boards have the “power to\nenact ordinances, by-laws and regulations for the government of the university.” Mich.\nComp.

Const. art. VIII, § 5.\n         6\n           Though the statutes and bylaws cited in this paragraph govern only the University of Michigan,\nthe boards of the other public colleges and universities in Michigan are similarly empowered. See, e.g.,\nMich. Comp. Laws §§ 390.102-.107 (Michigan State University), 390.641-.645 (Wayne State University).\nFor the sake of clarity, we refer exclusively to the University of Michigan’s bylaws and procedures, as they\nvery closely parallel those in place at other Michigan public educational institutions, such as Wayne State\nUniversity and Michigan State University.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;      Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.

Statutes §§ 2.34.09, 2.34.12, available at http://www.bog.wayne.edu/code\n(last visited May 22, 2012).\n\n        The University of Michigan’s bylaws delegate the day-to-day management of\nundergraduate admissions to the associate vice provost and executive director of\nundergraduate admissions. See Univ. of Mich. Bylaws § 8.01. Although the board\ndelegates this responsibility, it continues to exercise ultimate decisionmaking authority\nbecause it directly appoints the associate vice provost and executive director of\nundergraduate admissions, id., and because it retains the power to revoke or alter the\nadmissions framework, id. §§ 14.03, 14.04. Nothing prevents the board from adopting\nan entirely new framework for admissions decisions if it is so inclined. See Mich. Const.\nart. VIII, § 5; Mich. Comp. Laws §§ 390.3-.6; Univ. of Mich. Bylaws § 8.01. Indeed,\nthat the board can revise its bylaws is not a mere theoretical possibility, but a reality that\noccurs with some frequency. Since 2008, the University of Michigan’s Board of\nRegents has revised more than two dozen of its bylaws, two of which fall within Chapter\nVIII, the section regulating admissions practices.\n\n        Of course power in a large university, a vast and highly complex institution, must\nbe delegated. As such, the board fulfills its general supervisory role by conducting\nmonthly public meetings to remain apprised of all university operations and by\nexercising its power to amend bylaws or revise delegations of responsibility. See Univ.\nof Mich. Bylaws §§ 1.01, 14.03. At these meetings, the board regularly discusses\nadmissions practices, including the use of race-conscious admissions policies. See, e.g.,\nUniv. of Mich. Bd. of Regents Proceedings, March 2007, 264-65 (report of Provost to\nBoard of Regents regarding new policies to increase the institution’s diversity in the\nwake of Proposal 2); Univ. of Mich. Bd. of Regents Proceedings, June 2004, 301 (report\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;           Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.

Thus, the elected boards of Michigan’s public universities can, and do,\nchange their respective admissions policies, making the policies themselves part of the\npolitical process.7 But even if they did not, the Attorney General provides no authority\nto support his contention that an unused power is a power abandoned.\n\n         Nevertheless, the Attorney General argues, echoed by the dissenters, that\nadmissions decisions lie outside the political process because the governing boards of\nthe universities have “fully delegated” responsibility for establishing admissions\nstandards to politically unaccountable admissions committees and faculty members. But\nthe Michigan Constitution, state statutes, and the universities’ bylaws and current\npractices directly contradict this argument. Article VIII, section 5 of the Michigan\nConstitution entrusts the board with “general supervision of its institution.” Mich.\nConst. art. VIII, § 5. Michigan statutes §§ 390.3-.5 vest full governing authority in the\nboard, including the power to enact bylaws and regulations to promote and achieve the\nuniversity’s educational mission. See Mich. Comp. Laws §§ 390.3-.5. The University\nof Michigan bylaws unambiguously retain the power to alter or revoke any bylaw,\nincluding any delegation of responsibility. See Univ. of Mich. Bylaws § 14.03. This\nrobust legal authority makes the fact of such delegation irrelevant for our purposes, as\nthe board may revoke the delegation at will.\n\n         Moreover, to the extent the Attorney General and the dissenters express concern\nover the degree to which the board has delegated admissions decisions, that delegation\n\n         7\n           As the Michigan Constitution grants the power to establish other institutions of higher education\nbeyond the three universities named above, see Mich. Const. art. VIII, § 6, to the extent the leadership of\nthese institutions are democratically accountable, whether tangentially or directly, their powers are part\nof the political process.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;      Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.         Page 23\n09-1111                      Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\ndoes not affect whether admissions decisions should be considered part of the political\nprocess. When an elected body delegates power to a non-elected body for the day-to-day\nimplementation of policy, it does not remove the policy from the political process. In\nthe administrative law context, for example, rule-making powers are delegated from the\nPresident to appointed cabinet officials, and as a practical matter, further down to civil\nservice professionals. Regardless of the level at which the rule is drafted, the rule-\nmaking process is at all times under the umbrella of the powers of the President. These\nrules are often the subject of political debate, lobbying, and electioneering, again without\nregard to who actually drafted the particular rule in question. Without question, federal\nrule-making is part of the political process. Similarly, whether it is the board or a\ndelegated body that sets the rules for consideration of race in admissions, these decisions\nfall under the umbrella of the elected board and are thus part of the political process.\n\n        Telling   evidence     that   board    members      can    influence    admissions\npolicies—bringing such policies within the political process—is that these policies can,\nand do, shape the campaigns of candidates seeking election to one of the boards. As the\nboards are popularly elected, citizens concerned with race-conscious admissions policies\nmay lobby for candidates who will act in accordance with their views—whatever they\nare. Board candidates have, and certainly will continue, to include their views on race-\nconscious admissions policies in their platforms. See League of Women Voters, 2005\nGeneral Election Voter Guide, available at http://www.lwvka.org/guide04/regents/html\n(last visited May 22, 2012) (noting that a candidate for the Board of Regents pledged to\n“work to end so-called ‘Affirmative-Action,’ a racist, degrading system”). Indeed,\nnothing prevents Michigan citizens from electing a slate of regents who promise to\nreview admissions policies based on their opposition to affirmative action. Once elected,\nthe new slate may revise the bylaws, see Univ. of Mich. Bylaws § 14.03, and change\ntheir university’s admissions policies—either by entirely revoking the delegation and\nhandling all admissions policies at the board level or by enacting new bylaws giving\nmore explicit direction to admissions committees. Thus, Proposal 2 affects a “political\nprocess.”\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;      Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.           Page 24\n09-1111                      Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\n                        ii. Reordering of a “Political Process”\n\n        The next issue is whether Proposal 2 reordered the political process in a way that\nplaces special burdens on racial minorities. The Supreme Court has found that both\nimplicit and explicit reordering violates the Fourteenth Amendment. See Seattle,\n458 U.S. at 474; Hunter, 393 U.S. at 387, 390. In Hunter, the express language of the\ncharter amendment required any ordinance regulating real estate “on the basis of race,\ncolor, religion, national origin or ancestry” to be approved by a majority of the electorate\nand the City Council, as opposed to solely the City Council for other real-estate\nordinances. 393 U.S. at 387, 390. This reallocation of power was directly written into\nthe charter amendment, creating “in effect . . . an ‘explicitly racial classification treating\nracial housing matters differently’” from all other housing matters. Seattle, 458 U.S. at\n468 (quoting Hunter, 393 U.S. at 389).\n\n        In Seattle, however, the reordering was implicit: On its face, Initiative 350 simply\nprohibited school boards from using mandatory busing, but its practical effect was to\nforce “[t]hose favoring the elimination of de facto school segregation” to “seek relief\nfrom the state legislature, or from the statewide electorate” in order to overturn Initiative\n350.    Id. at 474.     Nonetheless, “authority over all other student assignment\ndecisions . . . remain[ed] vested in the local school board.” Id. Whereas a proponent of\nsmaller class sizes could seek redress at the local level, a proponent of integrative busing\nhad to scale the more onerous hurdle of a successful statewide campaign. The Seattle\nlegislation implicitly reallocated power because the “initiative remove[d] the authority\nto address a racial problem—and only a racial problem—from the existing\ndecisionmaking body . . . .” Id. Similar to the amendment in Hunter, Initiative 350\nmodified “the community’s political mechanisms . . . to place effective decisionmaking\nauthority over a racial issue at a different level of government.” Id.\n\n        The Seattle Court then clarified what sort of reordering contravenes the political-\nprocess doctrine: “[t]he evil condemned by the Hunter Court was not the particular\npolitical obstacle of mandatory referenda imposed by the Akron charter amendment; it\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;     Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.         Page 25\n09-1111                     Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nwas, rather, the comparative structural burden placed on the political achievement of\nminority interests.” Id. at 474 n.17 (emphasis added). In both Hunter and Seattle, “the\neffect of the challenged action was to redraw decisionmaking authority over racial\nmatters—and only over racial matters—in such a way as to place comparative burdens\non minorities.” Id. (emphasis added). Thus, any “comparative structural burden,” be it\nlocal or statewide or national, satisfies the reordering prong of the Hunter/Seattle test.\nId.\n\n       The comparative structural burden we face here is every bit as troubling as those\nin Hunter and Seattle because Proposal 2 creates the highest possible hurdle. This\ncomparative structural burden is most apparent in tracing the channels for change\navailable to a citizen promoting any policy unmodified by Proposal 2 and those available\nto a citizen promoting constitutionally permissible race-conscious admissions policies.\n\n       An interested Michigan citizen may use any number of avenues to change the\nadmissions policies on an issue outside the scope of Proposal 2. For instance, a citizen\ninterested in admissions policies benefitting legacy applicants—sons and daughters of\nalumni of the university—may lobby the admissions committees directly, through\nwritten or in-person communication. He may petition higher administrative authorities\nat the university, such as the dean of admissions, the president of the university, or the\nuniversity’s board. He may seek to affect the election—through voting, campaigning,\nor other means—of any one of the eight board members whom the individual believes\nwill champion his cause and revise admissions policies accordingly. And he may\ncampaign for an amendment to the Michigan Constitution.\n\n       Each of these methods, respectively, becomes more expensive, lengthy, and\ncomplex. Because Proposal 2 entrenched the ban on all race-conscious admissions\npolicies at the highest level, this last resort—the campaign for a constitutional\namendment—is the sole recourse available to a Michigan citizen who supports enacting\nsuch policies. That citizen must now begin by convincing the Michigan electorate to\namend its constitution—an extraordinarily expensive process and the most arduous of\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;     Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.        Page 26\n09-1111                     Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nall the possible channels for change. Just to place a proposed constitutional amendment\nrepealing Proposal 2 on the ballot would require either the support of two-thirds of both\nthe Michigan House of Representatives and Senate, see Mich. Const. art. XII, § 1, or the\nsignatures of a number of voters equivalent to at least ten percent of the number of votes\ncast for all candidates for governor in the preceding general election, see id. art. XII,\n§ 2. Once on the ballot, the proposed amendment must then earn the support of a\nmajority of the voting electorate to undo Proposal 2’s categorical ban. See id. art. XII,\n§§ 1-2.\n\n          Only after traversing this difficult and costly road would our now-exhausted\ncitizen reach the starting point of his neighbor who sought a legacy-related admissions\npolicy change. After this successful constitutional amendment campaign, the citizen\ncould finally approach the university—by petitioning the admissions committees or\nhigher administrative authorities—to request the adoption of race-conscious admissions\npolicies. By amending the Michigan Constitution to prohibit university admissions units\nfrom using even modest race-conscious admissions policies, Proposal 2 thus removed\nthe authority to institute any such policy from Michigan’s universities and lodged it at\nthe most remote level of Michigan’s government, the state constitution. As with the\nunconstitutional enactment in Hunter, proponents of race-conscious admissions policies\nnow have to obtain the approval of the Michigan electorate and, if successful,\nadmissions units or other university powers—whereas proponents of other non-universal\nadmissions factors need only garner the support of the latter. See Seattle, 458 U.S. at\n468, 474.\n\n          The “simple but central principle” of Hunter and Seattle is that the Equal\nProtection Clause prohibits requiring racial minorities to surmount more formidable\nobstacles than those faced by other groups to achieve their political objectives. See id.\nat 469-70. A state may not “allocate[] governmental power nonneutrally, by explicitly\nusing the racial nature of a decision to determine the decisionmaking process.” Id. at\n470. As the Supreme Court has recognized, such special procedural barriers to minority\ninterests discriminate against racial minorities just as surely as—and more insidiously\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;     Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.         Page 27\n09-1111                     Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nthan—substantive legal barriers challenged under the traditional equal protection rubric.\nSee id. at 467 (“[T]he Fourteenth Amendment also reaches a political structure that treats\nall individuals as equals, yet more subtly distorts governmental processes in such a way\nas to place special burdens on the ability of minority groups to achieve beneficial\nlegislation.”) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Because less onerous\navenues to effect political change remain open to those advocating consideration of non-\nracial factors in admissions decisions, Michigan cannot force those advocating for\nconsideration of racial factors to traverse a more arduous road without violating the\nFourteenth Amendment. We thus conclude that Proposal 2 reorders the political process\nin Michigan to place special burdens on minority interests.\n\n       3. Objections to the Applicability of the Hunter/Seattle Doctrine to Proposal 2\n\n       The Attorney General and the dissenters make a number of arguments as to why\nProposal 2 survives constitutional scrutiny. At the outset, it should be noted that\nadopting these arguments as to Proposal 2’s constitutionality would be particularly\nironic, given that these arguments applied with equal force to Initiative 350 in Seattle.\nWhile distinctions obviously exist between the policy at issue here and that in Seattle,\nthe factual differences are not so material as to justify departure from relevant Supreme\nCourt precedent.\n\n               a. Hunter/Seattle Doctrine and Preferential Treatment Programs\n\n       The Attorney General and the dissenters assert that Hunter and Seattle are\ninapplicable to Proposal 2 because those cases only govern enactments that burden racial\nminorities’ ability to obtain protection from discrimination through the political process,\nwhereas Proposal 2 burdens racial minorities’ ability to obtain preferential treatment.\nAt bottom, this is an argument that an enactment violates the Equal Protection Clause\nunder Hunter and Seattle only if the political process is distorted to burden legislation\nproviding constitutionally-mandated protections, such as anti-discrimination laws.\nUnder this theory, a state may require racial minorities to endure a more burdensome\nprocess than all other citizens when seeking to enact policies that are in their favor if\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;          Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.                    Page 28\n09-1111                          Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nthose policies are constitutionally permissible but not constitutionally required. This\neffort to drive a wedge between the political-process rights afforded when seeking anti-\ndiscrimination legislation and so-called preferential treatment is fundamentally at odds\nwith Seattle.\n\n         The only way to find the Hunter/Seattle doctrine inapplicable to the enactment\nof preferential treatment is to adopt a strained reading that ignores the preferential nature\nof the legislation at issue in Seattle, and inaccurately recast it as anti-discrimination\nlegislation. Initiative 350 prohibited the voluntary busing of students to correct de facto\nsegregation. 458 U.S. at 460-61. The school board was under no obligation to undertake\nthis effort because there had been no finding that the District’s segregation was the result\nof intentional racial discrimination. Id. at 491-92 (Powell, J., dissenting) (“The Court\nhas never held that there is an affirmative duty to integrate the schools in the absence of\na finding of unconstitutional segregation. Certainly there is no constitutional duty to\nadopt mandatory busing in the absence of such a violation.”) (internal citations omitted).\nAs such, the District’s plan was an ameliorative measure and not a response to\ndiscrimination. It is therefore inaccurate to suggest that Initiative 350 affected anti-\ndiscrimination legislation by making it more difficult for minorities to obtain protection\nfrom discrimination through the political process. Quite the contrary: as the district\ncourt recognized, “[b]ecause prohibiting integration (when it is not constitutionally\nmandated) is not tantamount to discrimination . . . the Court in Seattle did not (and could\nnot) rely on the notion that the restructuring at issue impeded efforts to secure equal\ntreatment.”8 Coal. VI, 592 F. Supp. 2d at 951. Therefore, in applying the Hunter\n\n\n         8\n           In holding that Proposal 2 nonetheless does not violate the Equal Protection Clause, the district\ncourt asserted that the race-conscious admissions policies at issue here should be distinguished from the\nvoluntary busing program at issue in Seattle because, unlike race-conscious admissions policies, “school\ndesegregation programs are not inherently invidious, do not work wholly to the benefit of certain members\nof one group and correspondingly to the harm of certain members of another group, and do not deprive\ncitizens of rights.” Coal. VI, 592 F. Supp. 2d at 951 (quoting Coal. for Econ. Equity v.

The Court further explained that “the skills needed in\ntoday’s increasingly global marketplace can only be developed through exposure to widely diverse people,\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;          Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.

The distinction urged by the Attorney General and the dissenters thus\nerroneously imposes an outcome-based limitation on a process-based right. What\nmatters is whether racial minorities are forced to surmount procedural hurdles in\nreaching their objectives over which other groups do not have to leap. If they are, the\ndisparate procedural treatment violates the Equal Protection Clause, regardless of the\nobjective sought.\n\n\n\n\ncultures, ideas, and viewpoints.” Id.

Proposal 2 as a Mere Repeal\n\n        Latching on to the Supreme Court’s observation that “the simple repeal or\nmodification of desegregation or antidiscrimination laws, without more, never has been\nviewed as embodying a presumptively invalid racial classification,” Crawford v. Bd. of\nEduc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110786\"><a href=\"/opinion/110786/crawford-v-board-of-ed-of-los-angeles/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">527</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 539 (1982); accord Hunter, 393 U.S. at 390 n.5; Seattle 458 U.S.\nat 483, the Attorney General implores us to classify Proposal 2 as a mere repeal of the\nuniversities’ race-conscious admissions policies, rather than the kind of political\nrestructuring that implicates the Hunter/Seattle doctrine. Crawford, a case decided the\nsame day as Seattle, emphasizes the difference between mere repeals and political\nrestructuring; state actors must retain the power to repeal policies without running afoul\nof the political-process doctrine—certainly not every policy elimination carries with it\na political-process violation. See 458 U.S. at 540. Crawford brings this difference into\nfocus, because the Court-approved political action in that case (amendment of the\nCalifornia Constitution) occurred at the same level of government as the original\nenactment (a prior amendment of the California Constitution), thus leaving the rules of\nthe political game unchanged. Id.\n\n        The Supreme Court has twice distinguished the “mere repeal” at issue in\nCrawford from the political reordering at issue in Hunter and Seattle. The Crawford\nCourt distinguished Hunter by clarifying that the charter amendment in Hunter was\n“something more than a mere repeal” because it not only repealed an ordinance adopted\nby the popularly elected City Council, it removed from the Council the power to\nreinstate it—more than just undoing an unpopular act, the electorate in Hunter had\naltered the framework of the political process. Crawford, 458 U.S. at 541. The Seattle\nCourt drew the same distinction between the Washington State legislation and the\nCalifornia amendment: it found that Initiative 350 “works something more than the\n‘mere repeal’ of a desegregation law by the political entity that created it . . . by lodging\ndecisionmaking authority over the question at a new and remote level of government.”\nSeattle, 458 U.S. at 483. Just as in Hunter, the electorate in Seattle changed the rules of\nthe political process.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;         Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.                Page 31\n09-1111                         Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\n        Here, the rules are not the same after Proposal 2. Rather than undoing an act of\npopularly elected officials by simply repealing the policies they created, Michigan voters\nrepealed the admissions policies that university officials created and took the additional\nstep of permanently removing the officials’ power to reinstate them. In short, Proposal\n2 “works something more than the ‘mere repeal’ of a desegregation law by the political\nentity that created it.” Id. Had those favoring elimination of all race-conscious\nadmissions policies successfully lobbied the universities’ admissions units, just as racial\nminorities did to have these policies adopted in the first place, there would be no equal\nprotection concern. Rather, like Initiative 350 did for any future attempt to implement\nintegrative busing (and the Akron city charter amendment did for any future attempt to\nenact a fair housing ordinance), Proposal 2 “burdens all future attempts” to implement\nrace-conscious admissions policies “by lodging decisionmaking authority over the\nquestion at a new and remote level of government.” Id.\n\n        This reallocation of decisionmaking authority at a “new and remote level of\ngovernment” distinguishes the instant case from Crawford. See id. Certainly, should\nMichigan’s public universities want to abolish these race-conscious admissions policies,\nthe admissions committees, the universities’ presidents and provosts, and the\nuniversities’ boards remain free to repeal them, without any infringement on the right\nto equal protection in the political process. The avenues of change available to\nMichigan’s public universities parallel those available to the District in Seattle. In ruling\nthe statewide repeal of the voluntary busing plan unconstitutional, the Seattle Court\nrequired any appeal to occur through local government, where the plan was originally\nenacted. Our decision no more entrenches a race-conscious policy than the Supreme\nCourt’s decisions in Seattle or Hunter. Indeed, while the dissenting opinions accuse us\nof judicially enshrining the presumptively invalid policy of considering race as one\nfactor in holistic admissions determinations, we take no such step.9\n\n\n\n\n        9\n         Moreover, by definition, we are only addressing valid, constitutional policies; the university\nboards have no authority to promulgate invalid, unconstitutional policies.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;          Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.                   Page 32\n09-1111                          Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\n         More generally, the dissenting opinions criticize our holding today in broad and\nstrident terms. At their core, these opinions express disapproval of the political-process\ndoctrine itself, dissatisfaction that Grutter allowed for even modest race-conscious\nadmissions policies, and incredulity at the possibility that a state constitutional\namendment forbidding consideration of race could violate the Equal Protection Clause.\nBut Hunter and Seattle have not been overruled; Grutter continues to permit the same\nholistic race-conscious admissions policies Proposal 2 seeks to permanently eliminate;\nand courts must decide equal protection challenges by application of precedent, rather\nthan resort to syllogism. Most importantly, our holding does not place race-conscious\nadmissions policies beyond the political process. Opponents of affirmative action\nremain free to advocate for their preferred policies in the same manner and at the same\nlevel of government as its proponents.\n\n         4. Constitutionality of Proposal 2 Under the Political-Process Doctrine\n\n         Proposal 2 modifies Michigan’s political process “to place special burdens on the\nability of minority groups to achieve beneficial legislation.” See id. at 467. Because\nProposal 2 fails the Hunter/Seattle test, it must survive strict scrutiny. See id. at 485\nn.28. Under the strict scrutiny standard, the Attorney General must prove that Proposal\n2 is “necessary to further a compelling state interest.” Crawford, 458 U.S. at 536. In\nSeattle, the Court did not consider whether a compelling state interest might justify a\nstate’s enactment of a racially-focused law that restructures the political process, because\nthe government made no such argument. 458 U.S. at 485 n.28. Likewise, because the\nAttorney General does not assert that Proposal 2 satisfies a compelling state interest, we\nneed not consider this argument. Therefore, those portions of Proposal 2 that affect\nMichigan’s public institutions of higher education violate the Equal Protection Clause.10\n\n\n\n\n         10\n           Because the Plaintiffs’ challenge is limited to public education, we do not decide today whether\nthe portions of Proposal 2 that affect public employment and public contracting also violate the Equal\nProtection Clause.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;      Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.

Traditional Equal Protection Analysis\n\n        Having found that Proposal 2 deprives the Plaintiffs of equal protection of the\nlaw under the political-process doctrine, we need not reach the question of whether it\nalso violates the Equal Protection Clause when assessed using the “traditional” analysis.\n\nB. The University Defendants’ Non-Dismissal\n\n        The University Defendants appeal the district court’s denial of their motion to\nbe dismissed as misjoined parties under Rule 21 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\nWe review the district court’s decision for an abuse of discretion and must affirm unless\nwe are “left with a definite and firm conviction that the trial court committed a clear\nerror of judgment.” Letherer v.

The Supreme Court of the United States held that such actions\nwere permissible, but certainly not that they were compelled. Grutter v. Bollinger,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130155\"><a href=\"/opinion/130155/grutter-v-bollinger/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">306</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2003). Subsequently, the ultimate state political authority, the People of\nMichigan, voted to establish the same principle that Massachusetts did in 1855.2 This\nis the same principle embodied in President Kennedy’s Executive Order 10925 of\n1961—that governmental decisions should be undertaken “without regard to race, creed,\n\n\n\n\n          1\n           “In determining the qualifications of scholars to be admitted into any public school or any\ndistrict school in this Commonwealth, no distinction shall be made on account of the race, color or\nreligious opinions, of the applicant or scholar.” 1855 Mass. Acts ch. 256.\n\n          2\n           “The Univeristy of Michigan, Michigan State University, Wayne State University, and any other\npublic college or university, community college, or school district shall not discriminate against, or grant\npreferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national\norigin in the operation of public employment, public education, or public contracting.” Mich.

Indeed, the\nvery term “affirmative action” comes from that presidential order.3\n\n         The majority of the en banc court now holds that this action of the People of\nMichigan was unconstitutional, relying on an extreme extension of two United States\nSupreme Court cases ruling on very different circumstances.\n\n         To begin with, those two cases each involved a single action that transferred, for\nthe first time, decision making on a single matter, a transfer held to be wholly aimed at\none disadvantaged race. In one instance, approval of new anti-discrimination ordinances\nwas moved from the city council to the voters of the city of Akron, and in the other case,\npower over certain pupil assignment policies was moved from the citizens of one city in\nthe state of Washington to the citizens of the entire state.\n\n         In our case, however, we have the citizens of the entire state establishing a\nprinciple that would in general have seemed laudable. Even plaintiffs here do not allege,\nin the context of their political-process argument, that if this constitutional provision had\nbeen enacted at some earlier time in Michigan, for example upon its entry into the union,\nor upon the enactment of its new constitution in 1963, that it would have been\nunconstitutional. They instead contend that because of current circumstances, and\nintervening political decisions of racial discrimination, these Supreme Court cases make\nthe principled action of the People of Michigan unconstitutional.\n\n         Indeed, the majority seems to concede that some set of decision makers in\nMichigan would be able to reverse the policies that they claim are immune from actions\nby the entire body politic. Rather, they demand that any changes in the educational (and\nperhaps employment) policies here can be enacted only by individual actions of each of\nthe university governing authorities (three of which are chosen by statewide election\nover eight years, Mich. Const. art. VIII § 5), each regional state university (whose\n\n\n         3\n         “The contractor will take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and that\nemployees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin.”\nIbid.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;     Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.

Under those circumstances, if that\nchild or its parents wished it to compete for educational or employment opportunities in\nMichigan without discrimination for or against the child, however a bureaucrat might\nclassify the child, the majority’s position is that they could do so only by proceeding in\na large number of individual political and election campaigns across the length and\nbreadth of Michigan, rather than by, as was the case here, convincing voters of Michigan\nto enact a policy that would under most other circumstances have been held to be\nlaudable.\n\n       I cannot agree that this decision is correct, either as a matter of general\nconstitutional law or as an accurate interpretation of the Supreme Court precedents.

Proposal 2 is not\nunconstitutional under either a political restructuring theory or under traditional equal\nprotection analysis. I therefore respectfully dissent.\n\n                                             I.\n\n        Elementary principles of constitutional law tell us that plaintiffs’ challenge to\nProposal 2 should have little to no chance of success. Plaintiffs argue that Michigan\nmust retain its racial and other preference policies in higher education and that the state’s\nvoters cannot make the contrary policy choice that factors like race and gender may not\nbe taken into account in admissions. They make this argument in the face of the core\nequal protection principle of nondiscrimination—a principle consistent with the choice\nof the people of Michigan. They make the argument despite the absence of any\nprecedent suggesting that states must employ racial preferences in university admissions.\nEssentially, the argument is one of constitutional protection for racial and gender\npreference—a concept at odds with the basic meaning of the Equal Protection Clause,\nas understood and explained through decades of jurisprudence.\n\n        Although it has convinced a majority of this court, plaintiffs’ argument must be\nunderstood for the marked departure it represents—for the first time, the presumptively\ninvalid policy of racial and gender preference has been judicially entrenched as beyond\nthe political process. In reaching its conclusion, the majority strays from analysis\nbounded by familiar principles of constitutional law and loses sight of the parameters\nwithin which we should operate in deciding this case. To be accurate in characterizing\nthe majority’s approach, it relies on two Supreme Court cases, which it deems highly\ninstructive. Yet, when examined carefully, these cases have no application here, and,\nin emphasizing them, the majority overlooks recent case law providing more relevant\nguidance.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;     Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.

Racial preference policies in university admissions—presumptively invalid\nbut permissible under limited circumstances and for a finite period of time—do not\nreceive the same structural protections against statewide popular repeal as other laws that\ninure to the interest of minorities. To understand why this is the case, it is necessary to\nview the Hunter/Seattle doctrine in the context of the recent decisional law of race-based\nclassification. See Grutter v.

The underlying law in\nSeattle was a local ordinance that implemented a series of school desegregation\nmeasures, which was repealed by a statewide referendum called Initiative 350. Seattle,\n458 U.S. at 460–62. In finding that the passage of Initiative 350 violated the political\nstructure doctrine, Seattle explained that “when the political process or the\ndecisionmaking mechanism used to address racially conscious legislation—and only\nsuch legislation—is singled out for peculiar and disadvantageous treatment, the\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;          Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.

In other\nwords, in order to trigger political-process concerns, Seattle instructs that the challenged\nenactment must single out racial issues or racially oriented legislation. And indeed, the\nchallenged enactment in Seattle, though facially neutral, was “carefully tailored to\ninterfere only with desegregative busing”—that is, to address “only a racial problem.”\nId. at 471 & n.14, 474. That is not the case here. Proposal 2 does not address “only a\nracial problem:” it prohibits any preference on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or\nnational origin. Mich. Const. art. I. § 26. Nor was Proposal 2 “carefully tailored” to\naffect only university admissions: it extends not just to public universities but also to\npublic employment and public contracting. Id. Accordingly, Proposal 2 is quite unlike\nthe narrow anti-busing measure struck down in Seattle; it represents “a sea change in\nstate policy, of a kind not present in Seattle or any other ‘political structure’ case.” See\nCoral Constr., 235 P.3d at 966 (Corrigan, J., concurring).\n\n         The majority is quick to conclude that Proposal 2 and Initiative 350 each target\npolicies—affirmative action and integrative busing, respectively—that “inure[] primarily\nto the benefit of the minority” and therefore each has a “racial focus.” (Maj. Op. at\n15–18.) But in a political-restructuring challenge, it is not enough to observe that some\nof the policies affected by the challenged enactment primarily benefit minorities. Nor\nis it enough to observe that, as here, the challenged enactment was passed in response\nto a high-profile case permitting racially conscious admissions policies under some\ncircumstances. Though relevant, these observations are alone insufficient: in a political\nrestructuring case, it is imperative to consider the scope of the challenged enactment\nitself.1 The majority fails to account for the broad substantive reach of Proposal 2 when\n\n         1\n           It is true that Hunter involved a challenged enactment that thwarted the passage of local\nordinances focusing not only on racial but also on religious and ancestral discrimination. Hunter, 393 U.S.\nat 386. But Hunter’s section 137 was far narrower than Proposal 2 in that it did not extend to sex nor did\nit apply beyond housing matters. Furthermore, as explained above, Hunter did not even arguably involve\nthe repeal of a law instituting racial preferences and thus does not suggest application of the political\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;         Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.

Today, it is plain that a racially conscious\nstudent assignment system—such as the one that the Seattle initiative attempted to make\nmore difficult to enact—would be presumptively invalid and subject to strict scrutiny.\nSee Parents Involved in Cmty.

And indeed, the\ncircumstance that racially conscious admissions policies are subject to the most exacting\njudicial scrutiny and limited in time—legal realities that the Seattle Court neither\nconfronted nor factored into its decision—counsels heavily against applying the political\nrestructuring doctrine to the enactment of Proposal 2. See Grutter, 539 U.S. at 341–42.\nGrutter’s charge that “[u]niversities in other States can and should draw on the most\npromising aspects of . . . race-neutral alternatives as they develop” only underscores this\npoint. Id. at 342. So while the majority is correct that Seattle employs broad language\nabout protecting the “‘ability of minority groups to achieve beneficial legislation’” (Maj.\nOp. at 32 (quoting Seattle, 458 U.S. at 467)), it must be remembered that the “beneficial”\npolicy that Proposal 2 purportedly makes more difficult to enact is itself “‘highly\n\n\n\n\n         2\n           While the dissent in Seattle suggested that the busing program be subject to strict scrutiny,\n458 U.S. at 492 n.6 (Powell, J., dissenting), the majority did “not specifically pass on that issue” because\nno one had challenged “the propriety of race-conscious student assignments for the purpose of achieving\nintegration, even absent a finding of prior de jure segregation.” Id. at 472 n.15 (majority opinion); see also\nParents Involved, 551 U.S. at 721 n.10 (noting that in Seattle the question of “whether a district’s\nvoluntary adoption of race-based assignments in the absence of a finding of prior de jure segregation was\nconstitutionally permissible” was “an issue . . . expressly reserved”).\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;          Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.

This is exactly the type of “[c]ontext [that] matters when\nreviewing race-based governmental action under the Equal Protection Clause.” Id. at\n327. In short, equal protection jurisprudence regarding the use of racial classifications\nhas developed markedly since Seattle was decided, and this development makes clear\nthat applying the political restructuring doctrine to the enactment of Proposal 2 is hardly\nappropriate.\n\n                                                   B.\n\n         In concluding that a race-based classification that is presumptively invalid, but\npermissible under limited circumstances and for a finite period of time, receives the\nsame structural protections against statewide popular repeal as other laws that inure to\nthe interest of minorities, the majority walks alone. The two highest courts to have\nconsidered the question have concluded that the political restructuring doctrine of Hunter\nand Seattle does not prevent the statewide popular elimination of race-based\nclassification policies. The Ninth Circuit concluded that California’s Proposition 209,\nwhich eliminated public race-based and gender-based affirmative action programs, did\nnot violate equal protection because “[i]mpediments to preferential treatment do not\ndeny equal protection.” Wilson, 122 F.3d at 708. The court relied on an essential\nconstitutional principle: “While the Constitution protects against obstructions to equal\ntreatment, it erects obstructions to preferential treatment by its own terms . . . . The Equal\nProtection Clause, parked at our most ‘distant and remote’ level of government, singles\nout racial preferences for severe political burdens—it prohibits them in all but the most\ncompelling circumstances.” Id. The Ninth Circuit recently affirmed its commitment to\nthe reasoning in Wilson, finding it “easily reconciled” with Grutter. Coal. to Defend\nAffirmative Action v.

The California\nSupreme Court came to the same conclusion, quoting Grutter for the principle that\n\n         3\n            For this reason, it is unimportant whether at the challenged enactment in Seattle imposed “an\nobstacle impeding preferential treatment” (Maj. Op. at 30) or whether the enactment merely made it more\ndifficult to seek protection from discrimination. Whatever the case, Seattle did not involve the rights of\nminorities to a policy that was presumptively invalid and explicitly limited in time.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;     Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.

Enshrining a\npermanent justification for racial preferences would offend this fundamental equal\nprotection principle.’” Coral Constr., 235 P.3d at 960 (quoting Grutter, 539 U.S. at\n342). The court explained that “[i]nstead of burdening the right to equal treatment, [the\nstatewide referendum banning race-based classification] directly serves the principle that\n‘all governmental use of race must have a logical end point.’” Id. (quoting Grutter,\n539 U.S. at 342). Our own district court agreed: “Proposal 2 does not offend the Equal\nProtection Clause by distancing racial minority groups from the means of obtaining\nequal protection.” Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action v. Regents of Univ. of Mich., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2151443\"><a href=\"/opinion/2151443/coalition-to-def-aff-act-v-regents-of-u-of-mi/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">924</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 957 (E.D. Mich. 2008).\n\n        The teaching of these cases is that equal treatment is the baseline rule embodied\nin the Equal Protection Clause, from which racial-preference programs are a departure.\nSee Grutter, 539 U.S. at 342 (“[R]ace-conscious admissions programs . . . [are a]\ndeviation from the norm of equal treatment of all racial and ethnic groups . . . .”). These\nprograms—fundamentally different from the underlying policies in Hunter and\nSeattle—cannot receive special sanctuary from a decision of the majority of voters to\nreturn their law to the equal protection norm of equal treatment.\n\n                                            III.\n\n        There is another reason that Hunter and Seattle cannot forbid the amendment of\nthe Michigan Constitution through the passage of Proposal 2. In both cases the relevant\nlawmaking authority was reallocated from a local legislative body to the “more complex\ngovernment structure,” id. at 477, of the city- or state-wide general electorate, thereby\nplacing a “comparative structural burden . . . on the political achievement of minority\ninterests,” id. at 475 n.17. A key consideration in analyzing a Hunter political structure\nchallenge, therefore, is whether the challenged law affects the ability of minorities to\nsecure “legislation that is in their interest” as minorities. Id. at 474 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted); see also id. at 475 n.17 (“Thus, in Hunter, the procedures for enacting\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;       Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.

Similarly here [in Seattle], the power to enact racial\nlegislation has been reallocated.”). As the record here demonstrates, the people of\nMichigan have not restructured the state’s lawmaking process in the manner prohibited\nby Hunter and Seattle. Instead, their vote removed admissions policy from the hands of\ndecisionmakers who were unelected and unaccountable to either minority or majority\ninterests and placed it squarely in an electoral process in which all voters, both minority\nand majority, have a voice.\n\n                                             A.\n\n       Public higher education in Michigan is unique in that “[t]he Michigan\nConstitution confers a unique constitutional status on [Michigan’s] public universities\nand their governing boards.” Federated Publ’ns, Inc. v.

Const. art. VIII, §§ 5 and 6). These\nboards are “the highest form of juristic person known to the law, a constitutional\ncorporation of independent authority, which, within the scope of its functions, is co-\nordinate with and equal to that of the legislature.” Id. at 496 n.8 (quoting Bd. of Regents\nof the Univ. of Mich. v. Auditor Gen., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">1037</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1040 (Mich. 1911)). Each\ngoverning board is vested with the power of “general supervision of its institution and\nthe control and direction of all expenditures from the institution’s funds.” Mich. Const.\nart. VIII, § 5. The constitution provides for eight-member governing boards, elected to\nstatewide office for eight-year terms, Mich. Const. art. VIII, § 5, and elections are\ntypically staggered, with, for example, an election every two years for regents of the\nUniversity of Michigan.\n\n       Although these universities and their respective boards are created by the\nMichigan Constitution, the admissions policies are placed within the control of the\nboards or school authorities only within each board’s bylaws. Thus, the admissions\npolicies are not established by the state constitution, and it is necessary to look to\ntestimony to determine where the power to set admissions policy lies.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;     Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.          Page 50\n09-1111                     Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\n        The governing boards have fully delegated the responsibility for establishing\nadmissions standards to several program-specific administrative units within each\ninstitution, which set admissions criteria through informal processes that can include a\nfaculty vote. For example, at the University of Michigan Law School the admissions\npolicy is set by the law school faculty admissions committee, with major substantive\nchanges occasionally voted upon by the entire law school faculty. Similarly, as\ndescribed by its former dean, at the Wayne State University Law School the ultimate\ndecision whether to change admissions standards rests with the faculty alone. Thus, as\nthe Cantrell Plaintiffs readily admitted in their previous briefing, the “faculty are the\nprimary architects of all the admissions criteria and protocols.”\n\n        As the deans of both law schools explained, at neither university is there a system\nin place to review or alter admissions policies at a level above a vote of the faculty.\nSarah Zearfoss, the dean of admissions at the University of Michigan Law School,\ntestified that no one could change the school’s admissions policy other than the faculty\nadmissions committee or the faculty itself, because “there’s no higher body” to which\nsomeone unhappy with an admissions policy could advocate change. And Frank Wu,\nthen the dean at Wayne State University Law School, agreed that “only the faculty at the\nlaw school has the authority to create and approve the admissions policy” at the school.\nIndeed, Wu testified that the admissions policy is not subject to the approval of the\nWayne State University Board of Governors, and, in his view, if the Board of Governors\nattempted to alter the decision of the law school’s faculty with respect to criteria for\nadmission, “it would precipitate a constitutional crisis.” Each institution’s board may\nsuperficially have “plenary authority” over its respective institution (see Maj. Op. at 20),\nbut the real authority to set admissions policy rests with each program-specific faculty\nwithin the universities.\n\n        The majority ignores the factual testimony of Deans Zearfoss and Wu, which\nexplains how admissions policies are actually crafted. Instead, the majority emphasizes\nthat the boards—although they have fully delegated their decisionmaking power to\nadmissions directors and faculty—can revoke this authority and can revise any bylaw\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;     Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.         Page 51\n09-1111                     Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nin order to effect changes in university admission policies. That the boards can legally\nrevoke a delegation of authority or have occasionally revised their bylaws to effect a\nchange in admissions policy, however, does not change the underlying factual reality\nthat the law school deans describe. Their testimony demonstrates that program-specific\nfaculties do not merely manage the “day-to-day implementation of policy,” (Maj. Op.\nat 23); these entities also set and change admissions policies—without any significant\noversight by the boards.\n\n                                            B.\n\n       The decisionmaking structure at the universities is important because these\nprogram-specific faculty admissions committees are far afield from the legislative bodies\nfrom which lawmaking authority was removed in Hunter and Seattle. To appreciate this\ncritical difference, we need look no further than Seattle itself.\n\n       In Seattle, the Court emphasized that the type of action it found objectionable\nwas the creation of comparative burdens “on minority participation in the political\nprocess.” 458 U.S. at 480 n.23; see id. at 486 (“[M]inorities are no less powerless with\nthe vote than without it when a racial criterion is used to assign governmental power in\nsuch a way as to exclude particular racial groups ‘from effective participation in the\npolitical proces[s].’” (quoting City of Mobile v.

The Seattle majority, however, did not view state university admissions\ncommittees as a part of the “political process” in the manner of an elected school board\nor city council. A dialogue between the majority and dissent in Seattle is particularly\ninstructive on this point. In dissent, Justice Powell, critiquing the potential breadth of\nthe majority’s holding, argued:\n\n       Thus, if the admissions committee of a state law school developed an\n       affirmative-action plan that came under fire, the Court apparently would\n       find it unconstitutional for any higher authority to intervene unless that\n       authority traditionally dictated admissions policies.

Unlike the Seattle\nSchool Board and the Akron City Council, the various Michigan university admissions\ncommittees and faculty members are unelected. As at most public universities, tenured\nfaculty members have significant vested rights associated with their employment in order\nto preserve academic freedom and independence. The faculty members who are\npermitted to vote on policy matters are therefore significantly insulated from\npolitical pressure by virtue of their tenure.         These faculty are beholden to no\nconstituency—student, local, or otherwise. And, as demonstrated by the testimony of\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;           Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.                    Page 53\n09-1111                           Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nthe law school deans in this case, the people of Michigan have no ability to exert\nelectoral pressure on the university decision makers to change their admissions polices.\nAs they currently stand, the faculty admissions committees are islands unto themselves,\nvested with the full authority to set admissions policy for their respective university\nprograms.\n\n         Of course, when an elected body delegates a power, it does not automatically\nfollow that the delegatee’s decisions fall outside the political process. But that is not the\npoint. Rather, the testimony of the law school deans demonstrates that, whatever the\nformal legal structure, the faculty committees set admissions policies without significant\nreview by the boards—thus insulating them from the political pressures the boards\nthemselves face.4\n\n         Furthermore, there is no “local” university constituency as there is a local\nconstituency for a city council or city school board, i.e., the city’s voters. Rather, despite\nthere being a broad student, faculty, and staff community associated with each university,\nMichigan’s state universities were established as state-wide institutions with a state-wide\nconstituency. The faculty admissions committees therefore do not “represent” any local\nconstituency at all. This is particularly important because the Seattle majority looked\nclosely at the fact that Washington’s lodging of political decisionmaking authority over\nthe busing question at the statewide level directly burdened minority interests by\n“mak[ing] the enactment of racially beneficial legislation difficult, [because] the\nparticular program might not have inspired opposition had it been promulgated through\n\n\n         4\n           Nyquist v.

In Nyquist, the court found that a New York statute that\n“prohibit[ed] state education officials and appointed school boards from assigning students, or establishing,\nreorganizing or maintaining school districts, school zones or attendance units for the purpose of achieving\nracial equality in attendance” unconstitutionally reordered the political process in violation of the Equal\nProtection Clause. Nyquist, 318 F. Supp. at 712, 720. The fact that appointed school boards were part of\nthe political process at issue in Nyquist does not mean that the university faculty admissions committees\nare similarly part of the political process. The decision in Nyquist made note of how the local boards were\naccountable to the community: “Parties considering themselves aggrieved by local board actions may seek\nto have the Commissioner enforce those policies. [The New York statute], however, singles out for\ndifferent treatment all plans which have as their purpose the assignment of students in order to alleviate\nracial imbalance.” Id. at 719 (internal citations omitted). Thus, even the appointed school boards were\naccountable to the community in a way in which the faculty admissions committees certainly are not.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;    Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.

The Court continued:\n\n       That phenomenon is graphically demonstrated by the circumstances of\n       this litigation. The longstanding desegregation programs in Pasco and\n       Tacoma, as well as the Seattle middle school integration plan, have\n       functioned for years without creating undue controversy. Yet they have\n       been swept away, along with the Seattle Plan, by Initiative 350. As a\n       practical matter, it seems most unlikely that proponents of desegregative\n       busing in smaller communities such as Tacoma or Pasco will be able to\n       obtain the statewide support now needed to permit them to desegregate\n       the schools in their communities.\n\nId. at 484 n.27. The availability of “local” decisionmaking is therefore important when\nthe political power of groups who could succeed at the local level is diluted in the\nstatewide decisionmaking process. The universities here, however, are statewide\ninstitutions with a statewide constituency. There is nothing local about them.\n\n       Nor are the committees particularly accessible or subject to effective lobbying.\nWhile members of the public may attend faculty meetings at which admissions standards\nare reviewed, there is no formal mechanism by which a member of the public—student\nor not—can move the committees to amend the admissions standards. And while\ninterested students and members of the public are, with advance notice, permitted to\nspeak at faculty meetings to comment on the admissions policies, the committees are not\nrequired to consider these comments seriously, issue written findings addressing these\nconcerns, or do more than provide a forum for interested individuals to speak. Rather,\nit appears that the main source of divergent views on admissions policies is the faculty\nmembers themselves.\n\n       The lack of a viable electoral mechanism to change university admissions\npolicies at a sub-constitutional level means that the voters’ use of a constitutional\namendment in this instance does not serve to create “comparative structural burden[s]\n. . . on the political achievement of minority interests.” Seattle, 458 U.S. at 474 n.17.\nIf, as the evidence before this court makes plain, the voters cannot exert electoral\npressure on independent faculty committees, then all voters regardless of racial identity\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;     Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.          Page 55\n09-1111                     Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\ncompete on the same level for the political achievement of their higher-education\ninterests: the constitutional level. This state constitutional amendment does not, then,\ncreate an improper comparative structural burden, but rather merely requires proponents\nof the use of racial preferences in admissions policy to engage the same level of process\nfollowed by proponents of Proposal 2. Thus, contrary to what the majority suggests, the\nburden upon a citizen who advocates for legacy preferences in university admissions is\nsimilar to the burden upon a citizen who advocates for racial preferences. Although the\nformer may attempt to lobby a faculty committee or university directly, these\nentities—according to the clear testimony of the law school deans and the manner in\nwhich authority has been delegated—will likely be unresponsive. Likewise, efforts to\nelect a particular board member, where the evidence demonstrates that the boards do not\nalter the admissions policies approved by the faculty committees, will similarly have\nlittle effect on admission policies.\n\n       Although the majority appears to see no reason to distinguish between the\nunelected and unresponsive program-specific faculty admissions committees here and\nthe legislative bodies from which lawmaking authority was removed in Hunter and\nSeattle, a consideration of political accountability in the political process is squarely\ngrounded in the Seattle opinion. In Seattle, the Court undertook a close examination of\nWashington’s system of “establish[ing] the local school board, rather than the State, as\nthe entity charged with making decisions of the type at issue,” 458 U.S. at 477:\n\n       But Washington has chosen to meet its educational responsibilities\n       primarily through “state and local officials, boards, and committees,” and\n       the responsibility to devise and tailor educational programs to suit local\n       needs has emphatically been vested in the local school boards.\n       Thus “each common school district board of directors” is made\n       “accountable for the proper operation of its district to the local\n       community and its electorate.” To this end, each school board is “vested\n       with the final responsibility for the setting of policies ensuring quality in\n       the content and the extent of its educational program.”\n\nId. at 477–78 (citations omitted) (emphases added); see also id. (noting the “disclosure\nand reporting provisions specifically designed to ensure the board’s ‘accountability’ to\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;     Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.          Page 56\n09-1111                     Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nthe people of the community” (emphasis added)). It was only upon its consideration of\nthe state statutory structure’s vesting of decisionmaking in local and politically\naccountable school boards that the Court could conclude that “placing power over\ndesgregative busing at the state level . . . restructured the Washington political process.”\nId. at 480. Taking this into account, it is difficult to conclude that, in amending their\nstate constitution to prohibit the use of racial preferences in university admissions, the\npeople of Michigan modified “the community’s political mechanisms . . . to place\neffective decisionmaking authority over a racial issue at another level of government.”\nId. at 474 (emphases added). Michigan has not “‘burden[ed] all future attempts’ to\nimplement race-conscious admissions policies ‘by lodging decisionmaking authority\nover the question at a new and remote level of government.’” (Maj. Op. at 30–31\n(quoting Seattle, 458 U.S. at 483).) Having little or no direct or indirect influence on the\nbodies that actually set admissions standards—the faculty committees—the people of\nMichigan made a political change at the only level of government actually available to\nthem as voters. The Michigan electorate, therefore, as opposed to choosing a more\ncomplex structure for lawmaking, employed the one effective method available to exert\nelectoral pressure on the mechanisms of government.\n\n        In short, Michigan has chosen to structure its university system such that politics\nplays no part in university admissions at all levels within its constitutionally created\nuniversities. The Michigan voters have therefore not restructured the political process\nin their state by amending their state constitution; they have merely employed it.\n\n                                            IV.\n\n        Finally, it is plain that Proposal 2 does not violate the Equal Protection Clause\nunder a traditional approach to equal protection. “The central purpose of the Equal\nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is the prevention of official conduct\ndiscriminating on the basis of race.” Washington v.

Proposal 2, which prohibits racial classifications, a fortiori does not\nclassify facially on the basis of race. See Wilson, 122 F.3d at 702; Coral Constr.,\n235 P.3d at 957.

(citing various\nmotivations of Proposal 2’s chief supporters that were not racially discriminatory).\nThe district court’s conclusions are correct. “[A]bsent a referendum that facially\ndiscriminates racially, or one where although facially neutral, the only possible rationale\nis racially motivated, a district court cannot inquire into the electorate’s motivations in\nan equal protection clause context.” Arthur v.

Accordingly, I would affirm the\njudgment of the district court.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;     Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.

Such democratically enacted programs, like all democratically enacted\nlaws, deserve initial respect in the courts, whether the particulars of a program satisfy\nthe Fourteenth Amendment, see Grutter v. Bollinger, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130155\"><a href=\"/opinion/130155/grutter-v-bollinger/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">306</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 343 (2003), or\nviolate it, see Gratz v.

Democracy, it turns out,\nhas nothing to do with it. Plaintiffs insist that the Fourteenth Amendment’s guarantee\nof “equal protection of the laws” imposes two new rules on the policy debates\nsurrounding affirmative action in higher education. Rule one: States not only may\nestablish race-conscious affirmative-action programs, but they must do so to comply with\nthe Fourteenth Amendment. Rule two: even if the Fourteenth Amendment does not\nmandate that States establish affirmative-action programs at their public universities, it\nbars them from eliminating such programs through amendments to their constitutions.\n\n                                            A.\n\n       The first theory has little to recommend it, so little that the notion of mandatory\naffirmative action will come as a surprise to all Justices of the United States Supreme\nCourt, past and present, who have labored to determine whether state universities may\never enact such race-conscious programs under the United States Constitution. No\nJustice has taken the position that this recurring and vexing debate has all been a\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;      Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.            Page 60\n09-1111                      Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\ndistraction, one that overlooked the hidden truth that the Fourteenth Amendment\nnecessarily permits affirmative-action programs because it demands them.\n\n        Plaintiffs nonetheless insist that, “to the extent that [Proposal 2] . . . bar[s] race\nor gender conscious programs that would be permissible under the Fourteenth\nAmendment, it violates the Equal Protection Clause.” Coalition First Br. at 39; see also,\ne.g., Oral Arg. at 7:36–45. Yet the words of the one amendment (prohibiting the State\nfrom “discriminat[ing] . . . on the basis of race”) cannot violate the words of the other\n(“nor shall any State deny to any person . . . the equal protection of the laws”).\n\n        That is especially true in the context of classifications based on race, which are\npresumptively unconstitutional and which must run the gauntlet of strict scrutiny\nto survive. See Gratz, 539 U.S. at 270. If racial preferences are only occasionally and\nbarely constitutional, it cannot be the case that they are always required. A State that\nwishes to treat citizens of all races and nationalities equally “is free as a matter of its own\nlaw” to do so. Oregon v. Hass, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109221\"><a href=\"/opinion/109221/oregon-v-hass/\"><span class=\"volume\">420</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">714</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 719 (1975). A first premise for resolving\nthis case is, and must be, that a State does not deny equal treatment by mandating it.\n\n                                              B.\n\n        The claimants’ other theory is of a piece. Having argued that the people of\nMichigan may not resort to the political process to eliminate racial preferences because\nthe Fourteenth Amendment demands them, the claimants alternatively insist that the\n“political process doctrine” of the Fourteenth Amendment separately prohibits the State\nfrom eliminating such programs already in existence by way of a state constitutional\namendment. Coalition First Br. at 27. That is not much of an alternative, as it comes to\nthe same end. More fundamentally, the argument misapprehends what States may do as\na matter of “politics” and “process.” Under the realm of politics, as just shown, the\npeople of a State may choose to end rather than continue affirmative-action programs.\nUnder the realm of process, the people of a State are free to use amendments to their\nconstitution—the same charter of state government that delegated power to create\naffirmative-action programs in the first place—as the vehicle for making the change.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;     Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.           Page 61\n09-1111                     Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\n       It is not that easy, plaintiffs insist. Even if States may do all of these things, the\npolitical-process doctrine prohibits States from altering their constitutions in a way that\nplaces “special burden[s] on racial minorities within the governmental process.” Hunter\nv. Erickson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107825\"><a href=\"/opinion/107825/hunter-v-erickson/\"><span class=\"volume\">393</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">385</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 391 (1969); see Coalition First Br. at 28. Yes, of course. But\nMichigan did no such thing.\n\n       By any reasonable measure, Proposal 2 does not place “special burdens” on racial\nminorities. It bans “discriminat[ing] against, or grant[ing] preferential treatment to, any\nindividual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the\noperation of public employment, public education, or public contracting.” Mich. Const.\nart. I, § 26. That is not a natural way to impose race-based burdens. The words of the\namendment place no burden on anyone, and indeed are designed to prohibit the State\nfrom burdening one racial group relative to another. All of this furthers the objectives\nof the Fourteenth Amendment, the same seed from which the political-process doctrine\nsprouted.\n\n       That the people of Michigan made this change through their Constitution, as\nopposed to state legislation or a new policy embraced by the governing boards at the\nthree state universities, does not impose a “special burden” on any racial minority.\nThere is nothing unusual about placing an equal-protection guarantee in a constitution.\nThat is where individual-liberty guarantees often go, and that after all is where the\nnational framers placed the federal counterpart. States need not place equal-protection\nguarantees at the structural location of the plaintiffs’ choosing, be it at the governing\nboards of each university, the faculty of each university or the admissions office of each\nuniversity. Instead of neutralizing the political process, that approach would skew it.\n\n       What else at any rate could the people of Michigan have done? Keep in mind\nthat Proposal 2 applies not just to “public education” but also to “public employment”\nand to “public contracting.” Neither the governing boards of the universities nor the\nuniversities’ faculties nor for that matter each university’s admissions committee\noversees “public employment” or “public contracting” for the entire State. And the\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;     Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.

That left the State just one option for\naddressing racial preferences in all three areas: a statewide constitutional amendment.\nThis time-hallowed option places no special burden on proponents of affirmative action\nother than the customary burdens placed on anyone seeking to pass a constitutional\namendment.\n\n       The charge that the Federal Constitution prohibits States from banning racial\npreferences through amendments to their constitutions also fails to account for one of the\nmost fervent criticisms of state constitutions: They are too easy to change. The\nreferendum option facilitates change, as it makes altering the constitution as easy as (if\nnot easier than) altering legislation. After obtaining the requisite number of signatures\n(10% of the votes cast in the last gubernatorial election, see Mich. Const. art. XII, § 2),\nthe proponents of change need to obtain just 51% of a popular vote and are spared the\nneed to obtain the consent of the Governor and each house of the legislature. That is\nwhy the former Chief Justice of the California Supreme Court, faced with an equally\nvariable state constitution, decries the “perpetual instability of California’s state\nconstitutional law.” See Ronald M. George, Keynote Address, 62 Stan. L. Rev. 1515,\n1516 (2010).\n\n       Nothing prevents proponents of affirmative action from borrowing a page from\nthe same playbook in a future state referendum—unless, that is, 51% of Michigan voters\ndo not support the change. But if the caveat applies, the answer is not to resort to the\npolitical-process doctrine, the goal of which is to promote neutral democratic means and\nends, not to ban them. The short of it is that a bare requirement of a 51% popular vote\nas a vehicle for constitutional change is as good as it gets—at least from the perspective\nof proponents of future change. States may create higher, super-majority impediments\nto change. But they cannot create super-minority facilitations of it.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;     Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.

Now that is a difficult charter to change. Is it really possible that the same\nFederal Constitution that is nearly impervious to change precludes a State from housing\nits elimination of racial preferences in a constitution that requires just a 51% popular\nvote for passage? Doubtful.\n\n       Odder still, the United States Constitution generally does not meddle in the way\nthe States structure their governments. Sailors v.

One: any change may not\ncome through legislation because the Michigan Constitution puts the governing boards\nat each of the three public universities (Michigan, Michigan State and Wayne State) in\ncharge of educational policy, including apparently admissions policies, at each\nuniversity. Two: there are eight members of the Board at each university, and two of\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;     Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.        Page 64\n09-1111                     Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nthem stand for election every two years in statewide elections. Three: these statewide\nelections are the only neutral way to permit opponents of racial preferences to establish\nsuch an admissions policy. Four: after eight years, the opponents of racial preferences\nwill have had a chance to replace all members of the three Boards and presumably by\nthen, if not a few years before, would have the votes to end racial preferences\nat each university. And all of this explains only the rules for Michigan’s three\npublic universities. Anyone wishing to change admissions policies at Michigan’s other\ninstitutions of higher education faces an equally elaborate process. See Mich. Const. art.\nVIII, § 6 (authorizing the elected governor to appoint members of regional university\nboards to staggered eight-year terms); id. § 7 (authorizing locally elected boards to\nregulate community and junior colleges).\n\n       Whatever else one might say about the path on which this interpretation of the\nFourteenth Amendment takes us, it does not follow Occam’s razor in getting there. Yet\nneedless complexity is the least of the problems raised by this theory. How would the\nsupporters of Proposal 2 end racial preferences in public contracting and public\nemployment, which the university boards do not oversee? Does plaintiffs’ theory mean\nopponents of racial preferences must do both—win a statewide referendum and win\ntwenty-four statewide individual elections? Must proponents of affirmative action do\nthe same to reverse a contrary policy? Even if we ignore public contracting and\nemployment, who says a single 10% petition drive and a single 51% popular vote make\nlife more difficult for proponents of change than twenty-four statewide elections (among\nothers) for twenty-four individuals over an eight-year period? Where are the empirical\nstudies to prove the point?      Should not the proponents of invalidating a state\nconstitutional amendment be expected to prove the premise before the court accepts this\ninvitation? Could the supporters of Proposal 2 amend the Michigan Constitution to\nremove control of the universities from their governing boards and place it in the hands\nof the legislature? What then? Would statewide legislation banning (or reinstating)\nracial preferences be permissible? There are many questions here, and all of them\ncounsel against adopting this disfiguring interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;     Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.          Page 65\n09-1111                     Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\n        I do not doubt that Proposal 2 places a burden on proponents of affirmative\naction: They no longer have access to it, and they must amend the constitution to get it\nback. But the Fourteenth Amendment insists only that all participants in the debate have\nan equal shot. It does not ensure victory for one side or the other in this or that policy\ndebate. It would be paradoxical if something called the “political process doctrine”\ninsulated one side of a vigorous policy debate from a timeless rule of politics: win some,\nlose some. Winning some and losing some, as it happens, is just what has occurred\nacross the country with statewide ballots seeking to eliminate racial preferences. While\nsome initiatives have prevailed (California, Michigan, Nebraska and Washington), others\nhave failed (Colorado, Missouri and Oklahoma).            See Tim Hoover, Amendment\n46 Fizzling Out, Denver Post, Nov. 7, 2008 at B4.\n\n        Another oddity of this theory is that it would apply even if the Michigan\nConstitution eliminated affirmative-action programs in another way. In 1963, the\npeople of Michigan passed an earlier amendment to their Constitution, one that\nprohibited race discrimination by governmental entities. See Mich. Const. art. I, § 2. In\nview of this prohibition, a Michigan resident surely would have the right to bring a claim\nthat the State Constitution’s existing prohibition on race-based classifications bars a\nsystem of racial preferences in admissions, contracting and employment. If there is one\nthing that the closely divided decisions in Bakke, Gratz and Grutter illustrate, it is that\nthe Michigan Supreme Court could reasonably invalidate, or reasonably uphold, racial\npreferences under the State Constitution’s existing equal-protection guarantee. A\ndecision invalidating racial preferences, however, would have precisely the same effect\nas Proposal 2, establishing that the Constitution bars racial preferences and placing the\nonus on proponents of racial preferences to alter the Constitution. The claimants have\nno answer to this point. If Proposal 2 violates the political-process doctrine, so too\nwould a decision by the Michigan Supreme Court that comes to the same end through\na permissible interpretation of the 1963 equal-protection guarantee.\n\n        The same is true of a state court’s decision to apply strict scrutiny to racial\npreferences. Most state constitutions, including all of the ones in our circuit, mirror this\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;       Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.

One might think these constitutional\nsafeguards would be secure from second-guessing by federal courts, but they are not\nunder plaintiffs’ theory. For they impose special burdens on some policies that might\nbenefit racial minorities in the admissions process without imposing the same burdens\non policies that benefit groups categorized along non-suspect lines, such as children of\nalumni, athletes or band members. Under each of these state constitutions, a member of\na racial minority who wants a governmental privilege must identify a compelling state\ninterest that supports its provision. If plaintiffs are correct, that reality dooms the States’\nequal protection clauses, even though the federal Equal Protection Clause requires no\nless. That cannot be right.\n\n        The Court’s decision in Romer v. Evans, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118027\"><a href=\"/opinion/118027/romer-v-evans/\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">620</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1996), which did not\nconcern racial classifications, holds nothing to the contrary. Colorado enacted a\nconstitutional amendment prohibiting the State and its municipalities from enacting laws\nbanning discrimination on the basis of “homosexual, lesbian or bisexual orientation,\nconduct, practices or relationships.” Id. at 624. In invalidating the amendment, the\nCourt noted that the amendment “impos[es] a broad and undifferentiated disability” (the\ninability to seek protection from discrimination at the state or local level) “on a single\nnamed group” (gays and lesbians). Id. at 632. The amendment “was inexplicable by\nanything but animus toward the class it affects” and therefore “lack[ed] a rational\nrelationship to legitimate state interests.” Id. By contrast, Proposal 2 serves a rational\ninterest, indeed a compelling one: eliminating racial classifications in admissions, public\nemployment and public contracting.\n\n        The Court’s decisions in Hunter and Seattle, which did concern racial\nclassifications, also hold nothing to the contrary. The laws invalidated in both cases\nwere designed to disadvantage one minority group—African-Americans—and no other.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;     Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.         Page 67\n09-1111                     Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nIn Hunter, the City of Akron in 1964 amended its charter to require that any housing\nordinance forbidding discrimination “on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin\nor ancestry” be approved in a city-wide referendum before going into effect, an\namendment designed to hinder only the political goals of the African-American\ncommunity. See 393 U.S. at 391; id. at 394, 395 (Harlan, J., concurring). In Seattle, the\nState of Washington in 1978 enacted a law forbidding school districts from requiring\nchildren to be bused to schools distant from their homes, but made exceptions for busing\ndesigned for virtually every purpose except racial integration. 458 U.S. at 462–63. It\nthus “remove[d] the authority to address a racial problem—and only a racial\nproblem—from [school boards].” Id. at 474.\n\n       The same cannot be said of Proposal 2. In the first place, Proposal 2 removes\nracial preferences, not anti-discrimination measures. To the extent Proposal 2 has any\neffect on the political structures through which a group may acquire special treatment\nin university admissions, it is a leveling one. The law imposes no “special burden[s]”\non anyone, Hunter, 393 U.S. at 391, but instead eliminates “pernicious” “racial\nclassifications,” Gratz, 539 U.S. at 270. If ever there were a neutral, non-special burden,\nthat is it. The Equal Protection Clause freely permits governments to ban racial\ndiscrimination, as here, but it does not freely permit them to ban all bans on racial\ndiscrimination, as in Hunter and Seattle.\n\n       In the second place, Proposal 2 prohibits discrimination not just on the basis of\nrace but also on the basis of sex, ethnicity and national origin. To the extent it\ndisadvantages anyone, it disadvantages groups that together account for a majority of\nMichigan’s population, not this or that racial minority. It “make[s] little sense to apply\n‘political structure’ equal protection principles where the group alleged to face special\npolitical burdens itself constitutes a majority of the electorate.” Coal. for Econ. Equity,\n122 F.3d at 704.\n\n       Nor is it even clear which groups—men or women, this racial group or that\none—Proposal 2 helps and hurts, or when each group will be affected. Perhaps there\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;     Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.          Page 68\n09-1111                     Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nwas a time when a ban on gender-based preferences favored men. Perhaps the opposite\nis true today, as female high school students increasingly outperform their male\nclassmates. See, e.g., Rob Mank, Men Far More Likely to Benefit from Affirmative\nAction     in   College      Admissions,        CBS     Ne ws,     Sept.     26,    2011,\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20111646-503544.html. A ban on racial\npreferences likewise may favor some racial groups today and others tomorrow. The one\nthing we know for sure is that race-based programs need not, indeed may not, last into\nperpetuity, as the Court assumed that all such programs would come to an end within\n25 years—namely by 2028. See Grutter, 539 U.S. at 343. It is the essence of democracy\nto allow the people to use their own judgment in deciding when a complicated policy has\noutlived its usefulness, and nothing in Grutter required the States to wait until 2028 to\nmake that choice.\n\n       It is no answer to say that Michigan may adopt a statewide policy regarding\nracial preferences if, and only if, they adopt statewide policies on other admissions\npolicies—from how much weight to give Advanced Placement courses to how many\nzoology students to admit to how to treat children of alumni to how to treat football\nplayers, oboists or thespians. The Equal Protection Clause reflects our collective\njudgment that generalizations based on race are dubious in the near term and destructive\nin the long term, making it appropriate to treat racial proxies, which are presumptively\nunconstitutional, differently from other more-pedestrian distinctions, which are\npresumptively constitutional. Gratz, 539 U.S. at 270. It does not bar Michigan from\nrecognizing the same.\n\n       Any doubt that Hunter and Seattle support rather than undermine the\nconstitutionality of Proposal 2 is removed by Seattle, the last of the two decisions. In\nSeattle, Justice Powell, no stranger to affirmative-action debates, raised the concern that\nthe majority’s reasoning meant that, “if the admissions committee of a state law school\ndeveloped an affirmative-action plan that came under fire, the Court apparently would\nfind it unconstitutional for any higher authority to intervene unless that authority\ntraditionally dictated admissions policies.” 458 U.S. at 499 n.14 (Powell, J., dissenting).\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;     Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.          Page 69\n09-1111                     Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nNo worries, the majority responded: The problem with Washington’s anti-busing\ninitiative was “the burden it impose[d] on minority participation in the political process,”\nid. at 480 n.23, a consideration that made Justice Powell’s hypothetical “entirely\nunrelated to this case” because it had “nothing to do with the ability of minorities to\nparticipate in the process of self-government.” Id. If the Court thought that the removal\nof an affirmative-action policy was “entirely unrelated” to the concerns in Seattle, then\nI am hard-pressed to understand why the same is not true in this instance—and just as\nhard-pressed to understand how anyone can insist our hands are tied in today’s case.\nThe companion political-process case to Seattle, handed down the same day, confirmed\nthe point. The “Equal Protection Clause,” it made clear, “is not violated by the mere\nrepeal of race-related legislation or policies that were not required by the Federal\nConstitution in the first place.” Crawford v.

The infrequent use of the\ndoctrine is not surprising given its lack of a constitutional basis. It replaces actual\nevidence of racial motivation with a judicial presumption and, hence, is an aberration\ninconsistent with the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n        The laws at issue in Hunter and Seattle were both facially neutral. See Hunter,\n393 U.S. at 391 (noting that “the law on its face treats Negro and white, Jew and gentile\nin an identical manner”); Seattle, 458 U.S. at 471 (referring to the “facial neutrality” of\nthe state legislation). Yet, in each case, the Supreme Court held that strict scrutiny\napplied without any need for the respective plaintiffs to show that the laws were enacted\nas a result of discriminatory intent or were inexplicable on grounds other than race. It\nsimply declared that there was an “‘explicitly racial classification’” where the prior law\ninured to the benefit of racial minorities, and the newly enacted law moved the\napplicable decisionmaking process to a more remote level of government. Seattle, 458\nU.S. at 468 (quoting Hunter, 393 U.S. at 389).\n\n        These decisions are justifiably characterized as “jurisprudential enigmas that\nseem to lack any coherent relationship to constitutional doctrine as a whole.” David J.\nBaron, The Promise of Cooley’s Cities: Traces of Local Constitutionalism, 147 U. Pa.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;      Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.           Page 72\n09-1111                      Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nL. Rev. 487, 561 (1999); see also Daniel P. Tokaji, First Amendment Equal Protection:\nOn Discretion, Inequality, and Participation, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">L</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Rev. 2409, 2476 (2003) (“It\nis therefore easy to view these cases as constitutional oddballs, difficult or impossible\nto explain in light of accepted equal protection principles.”). “In the absence of a federal\nconstitutional violation requiring race-specific remedies, a policy of strict racial\nneutrality by a State . . . violate[s] no federal constitutional principle.” Seattle, 458 U.S.\nat 491 (Powell, J., dissenting).\n\n        Moreover, as first noted by Justice Powell, the political structure doctrine\nunconstitutionally suspends our normal and necessary democratic process by prohibiting\nchange when a lower level of state government has acted in a way that arguably benefits\nracial minorities. Id. at 494–96 (Powell, J., dissenting) (“The political process in\nWashington, as in other States, permits persons who are dissatisfied at a local level to\nappeal to the state legislature or the people of the State for redress,” but “[u]nder today’s\ndecision this heretofore undoubted supreme authority of a State’s electorate is to be\ncurtailed whenever a school board—or indeed any other state board or local\ninstrumentality—adopts a race-specific program that arguably benefits racial\nminorities.”).\n\n        In addition, the majority in the present case eschews a “traditional” Equal\nProtection Clause analysis by deeming its well-established principles unnecessary to the\nlegal equation. I respectfully disagree and would hold that by conventional equal\nprotection standards, Proposal 2 passes constitutional muster. “A law that prohibits the\nState from classifying individuals by race or gender a fortiori does not classify\nindividuals by race or gender.” Coal. for Econ. Equity v. Wilson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"744846\"><a href=\"/opinion/744846/the-coalition-for-economic-equity-california-naacp-northern-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">692</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 702\n(9th Cir. 1997). In my view, racial discrimination and racial preference are synonymous.\nIn the realm of a finite number of classroom seats, the preference given one person based\nupon his race is the discrimination inflicted upon another based upon his.\nDiscrimination on the basis of race is racial discrimination, whether it is euphemistically\ncalled a “preference” or something else. In affirming California’s substantially similar\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;     Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.          Page 73\n09-1111                     Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nProposition 209, which banned race and gender preferences, the Ninth Circuit in Wilson\neloquently stated:\n\n        When the government prefers individuals on account of their race or\n        gender, it correspondingly disadvantages individuals who fortuitously\n        belong to another race or to the other gender. “Consistency does\n        recognize that any individual suffers an injury when he or she is\n        disadvantaged by the government because of his or her race.” Adarand,\n        515 U.S. at 230, 115 S. Ct. at 2114. Proposition 209 amends the\n        California Constitution simply to prohibit state discrimination against or\n        preferential treatment to any person on account of race or gender.\n        Plaintiffs charge that this ban on unequal treatment denies members of\n        certain races and one gender equal protection of the laws. If merely\n        stating this alleged equal protection violation does not suffice to refute\n        it, the central tenet of the Equal Protection Clause teeters on the brink of\n        incoherence.\n\nWilson, 122 F.3d at 702; cf. Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action v. Granholm, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"796435\"><a href=\"/opinion/796435/coalition-to-defend-affirmative-action-v-jennifer-granholm-michael-cox/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">237</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 250 (6th Cir. 2006) (“If the Equal Protection Clause gives heightened scrutiny to\n[gender-based classifications], a State acts well within the letter and spirit of the Clause\nwhen it eliminates the risk of any such scrutiny by removing gender classifications\naltogether in its admissions programs.”) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n        In a footnote, the majority superficially acknowledges, but does not discuss, the\ncircuit split it creates in declining to follow the Ninth Circuit decisions upholding the\nconstitutionality of analogous Proposition 209. See Wilson and Coal. to Defend\nAffirmative Action v. Brown, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"626473\"><a href=\"/opinion/626473/coalition-to-defend-affirmative-action-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">674</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1128</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 2012). I would adopt the\npersuasive reasoning of Wilson and hold that, in amending their state constitution to\nprohibit racial discrimination and “preferential treatment,” the citizens of Michigan did\nnot violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, but rather\nenshrined its principles into the Michigan Constitution.           Like Proposition 209,\nMichigan’s proscription of racial preference, “as a matter of law and logic, does not\nviolate the Equal Protection Clause in any conventional sense.” Wilson, 122 F.3d at 702.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/1534;      Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.          Page 74\n09-1111                      Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\n        Finally, in an effort to avoid confusion and aid further review, I note the limits\nof the majority’s holding. My colleagues do not declare MICH. CONST. art. I, § 26\nunconstitutional in its entirety. Rather, their holding is limited to “racial minorities” and\nour court’s declaration “[f]inding those provisions of Proposal 2 affecting Michigan’s\npublic colleges and universities unconstitutional . . . .” Thus, the other provisions of\nMICH. CONST. art. I, § 26 that prohibit discrimination and preferential treatment on the\nbasis of sex, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public employment, public\neducation, and public contracting, survive this court’s ruling. Further, the Michigan\nconstitutional prohibitions against discrimination or preferential treatment based on race,\nexcept in the operation of public colleges and universities regarding “racial minorities,”\nremain in effect. In this regard, art I, § 26(7) contains a severability clause: “Any\nprovision held invalid shall be severable from the remaining portions of this section.”\n\n        I caution that because the term “racial minorities” is not defined by the majority\nopinion, the class of persons benefitting from it is unclear and will be a potent source of\nlitigation were it allowed to stand. Under today’s en banc decision, not all persons are\nentitled to the equal protection of the laws.\n\n        For these reasons, I would affirm the district court and therefore respectfully\ndissent.\n\f</pre>",
