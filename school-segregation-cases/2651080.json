The District Court dismissed the action pursuant to Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 12(b)(6), holding that PHEAA and one of the individual defendants in his official\n\ncapacity were immune from suit under the Eleventh Amendment, and that all individual\n\ndefendants were entitled to qualified immunity. Because we find these issues more\n\nproperly resolved after further factual development, we will vacate and remand for\n\nfurther proceedings.\n\n                                              I\n\n       PHEAA is a servicer of student loans organized under Pennsylvania law and\n\nheadquartered in Harrisburg. Lang and Brown worked at its customer service call centers\n\nand allege that PHEAA unlawfully failed to compensate its call center employees for the\n\ntime spent before their shifts “log[ging] into various computer applications to be ready to\n\nbegin handling calls at the beginning of their paid shift,” in violation of the Fair Labor\n\n\n\n\n       \n        This disposition is not an opinion of the full Court and pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7\ndoes not constitute binding precedent.\n                                              2\n\fStandards Act (“FLSA”), 29 U.S.C. § 201 et seq. App. 50.1 Their complaint named the\n\nfollowing defendants: PHEAA; James L. Preston, PHEAA’s President and CEO, in his\n\nofficial and individual capacities; Stephanie Foltz, PHEAA’s Vice President of Loan\n\nOperations, in her individual capacity; Todd Mosko, PHEAA’s Vice President of Loan\n\nAssets Management, in his individual capacity; and Matthew Sessa, PHEAA’s Vice\n\nPresident of FedLoan Servicing, in his individual capacity (collectively, “Defendants”).\n\n       The District Court dismissed the pertinent aspects of the complaint pursuant to\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).2 First, applying the three factors set forth in Fitchik v. New\n\nJersey Transit Rail Operations, Inc., 873 F.2d 655 (3d Cir. 1989), the District Court\n\nconcluded that PHEAA and Preston in his official capacity were immune from suit under\n\nthe Eleventh Amendment, reasoning that, while “a judgment against PHEAA is legally\n\ndistinguishable from a judgment against the Commonwealth,” App. 14, Pennsylvania law\n\nconsiders PHEAA an arm of the state.\n\n       Second, the District Court held that the claims against the individual Defendants in\n\ntheir individual capacities were barred by qualified immunity, holding that they were\n\ngovernment officials and that, “[i]n light of the considerable dispute surrounding the\n\napplicability of the FLSA to preparatory activities and the lack of any express statute or\n\nprecedential ruling on the particular issue . . . , we cannot conclude that all reasonable\n\n       1\n         The original complaint included state law claims under Pennsylvania’s Wage\nPayment and Collection Law and its Minimum Wage Act. Those claims were dismissed\nin a separate order that was not appealed.\n       2\n         Plaintiffs dismissed the remainder of the complaint, which embodied a request\nfor prospective declaratory relief against Preston in his official capacity.\n                                              3\n\fofficials should have understood PHEAA’s policy to be in violation of the FLSA.” App.\n\n30. Plaintiffs appeal.3\n\n                                                 II\n\n                                                 A\n\n       We first address whether PHEAA and Preston in his official capacity are entitled\n\nto Eleventh Amendment immunity. The Eleventh Amendment “immunize[s] an\n\nunconsenting state from suits brought in federal courts by her own citizens as well as by\n\ncitizens of another state.” Fitchik, 873 F.2d at 658 (internal quotation marks omitted). A\n\nsuit brought against an entity that is in essence “an arm of the state” is similarly barred by\n\nthe Eleventh Amendment. Id. To determine whether such an entity is entitled to\n\nEleventh Amendment immunity, we consider: “(1) [w]hether the money that would pay\n\nthe judgment would come from the state,” which entails consideration of “whether\n\npayment will come from the state’s treasury, whether the agency has the money to satisfy\n\nthe judgment, and whether the sovereign has immunized itself from responsibility for the\n\nagency’s debts”;4 “(2) [t]he status of the agency under state law,” including “how state\n\n\n       3\n          The District Court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331. We have jurisdiction\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1291. We review the District Court’s dismissal of the complaint de\nnovo and “accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true, construe the complaint\nin the light favorable to the plaintiff, and ultimately determine whether plaintiff may be\nentitled to relief under any reasonable reading of the complaint.” Mayer v. Belichick,\n605 F.3d 223, 229 (3d Cir. 2010). We may also consider “any matters incorporated by\nreference or integral to the claim, items subject to judicial notice, [and] matters of public\nrecord.” Buck v. Hampton Twp. Sch. Dist., 452 F.3d 256, 260 (3d Cir. 2006).\n        4\n          The focus of this first factor is “the entity’s potential legal liability, rather than its\nability or inability to require a third party to reimburse it, or to discharge the liability in\n                                                 4\n\flaw treats the agency generally, whether the entity is separately incorporated, whether the\n\nagency can sue or be sued in its own right, and whether it is immune from state taxation”;\n\nand “(3) [w]hat degree of autonomy the agency has.” Id. at 659. Applying these factors\n\nrequires “a fact-intensive review that calls for individualized determinations.” Bowers v.\n\nNCAA, 475 F.3d 524, 546 (3d Cir. 2007). We treat Eleventh Amendment immunity as\n\nan affirmative defense, and “the party asserting [it] bears the burden of proving\n\nentitlement to it.” Christy v. Pa. Turnpike Comm’n, 54 F.3d 1140, 1144 (3d Cir. 1995).\n\n       Presented with little beyond the allegations in the complaint (which we assume to\n\nbe true at this stage) and several Pennsylvania statutes, we cannot conclude that the\n\nFitchik factors necessarily cloak PHEAA with Eleventh Amendment immunity. As to\n\nthe first factor, the complaint asserts that PHEAA would be responsible for paying a\n\njudgment against it and that this burden would not fall directly on the state. The\n\ncomplaint’s allegation that Pennsylvania does not expend tax dollars “to support\n\nPHEAA’s lending, servicing, and other proprietary activities,” App. 55-56, is consistent\n\nwith the statutory scheme governing PHEAA, pursuant to which “no obligation of\n\n[PHEAA] shall be a debt of [Pennsylvania] and [PHEAA] shall have no power to pledge\n\nthe credit or taxing power of [Pennsylvania] nor to make its debts payable out of any\n\nmoneys except those of [PHEAA].” 24 Pa. Stat. Ann. § 5104(3). Further, PHEAA’s\n\nfunds are kept in a segregated account under the PHEAA board’s control, id. § 5105.10,\n\n\n\nthe first instance.” Benn v. First Judicial Dist. of Pa., 426 F.3d 233, 239-40 (3d Cir.\n2005) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n                                              5\n\fand used at its discretion to carry out its corporate purposes, id. § 5104(3); see Blake v.\n\nKline, 612 F.2d 718, 723 (3d Cir. 1979) (noting in Eleventh Amendment context that\n\nPennsylvania’s Public School Employees’ Retirement Board fund was “set apart in the\n\nstate treasury from general state funds” and “administered by the State Treasurer at the\n\ndirection of the Board” (footnote omitted)).5 Thus, viewing the allegations in the\n\ncomplaint as true and considering them in light of the statutory scheme governing\n\nPHEAA, we conclude that the first Fitchik factor weighs against Eleventh Amendment\n\nimmunity, as it appears that PHEAA would be obligated to pay any judgment against it\n\nfrom its segregated funds.\n\n       As to the second factor, PHEAA has allegedly stated “that it is not considered part\n\nof the primary government of Pennsylvania,” App. 61 (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted),6 but Pennsylvania law appears to treat it as an arm of the state. First, courts\n\n\n       5\n          Citing a Pennsylvania statute providing that the State Treasurer must generally\napprove payment of funds from the State Treasury, the District Court reasoned that\n“although the Commonwealth has disclaimed legal liability for PHEAA’s debts, payment\nof those debts will necessarily be taken from the State Treasury and require the approval\nof the State Treasurer.” App. 13 (citing 72 Pa. Stat. Ann. § 307). As this Court has made\nclear, however, it is the legal obligation to satisfy the agency’s debts that carries the most\nweight with respect to this first prong of the Eleventh Amendment analysis: “if a State is\nnot under a legal obligation to satisfy a judgment, then any increase in expenditures in the\nface of an adverse judgment is considered a voluntary or discretionary subsidy not\nentitled to Eleventh Amendment protections.” Bowers, 475 F.3d at 547 (emphasis in\noriginal). The present record provides no indication that Pennsylvania is legally\nobligated to satisfy a judgment against PHEAA and, for this further reason, we cannot\nhold that application of the first Fitchik factor favors Eleventh Amendment immunity.\n        6\n          Although the complaint alleges that “PHEAA is not an arm of the\nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania,” App. 55, this is a legal conclusion and is not entitled to\nthe assumption of truth. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).\n                                              6\n\fhave described PHEAA as “undeniably an agency of the Commonwealth.” PHEAA v.\n\nBarksdale, 449 A.2d 688, 689-90 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1982). Second, PHEAA’s enabling\n\nlegislation describes it as “a public corporation and government instrumentality,” 24 Pa.\n\nStat. Ann. § 5101, with the public purpose of “improv[ing] the higher educational\n\nopportunities of persons who are residents of [Pennsylvania] . . . by assisting them in\n\nmeeting their expenses of higher education,” id. § 5102, and thereby performing “an\n\nessential governmental function,” id. § 5105.6. Thus, on the limited record before us, the\n\nsecond Fitchik factor weighs in favor of Eleventh Amendment immunity.\n\n       The third Fitchik factor—PHEAA’s autonomy—presents a close question that is\n\ndifficult to resolve without the benefit of additional facts. Several allegations in the\n\ncomplaint are supported by statutory provisions that govern PHEAA and are suggestive\n\nof its autonomy. First, PHEAA allegedly uses no tax dollars to support its salaries or\n\nactivities, and it is controlled by a relatively autonomous board of directors that has\n\nunfettered control over PHEAA funds kept in a segregated account within the state’s\n\nTreasury. Id. §§ 5014(3), 5105.10. Second, PHEAA may independently enter into\n\ncontracts, id. § 5104(1.1)(iii), (4); Christy, 54 F.3d at 1149 (ability to enter contracts in its\n\nown name demonstrates Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission’s autonomy), sue and be\n\nsued in its own name, purchase and sell property, borrow money, earn profits from\n\ninvestments, and provide substantial bonuses to its executives. Third, PHEAA describes\n\nitself as more akin to a corporation than a state agency and states that it competes with\n\nloan servicing competitors nationwide. App. 59. These factual allegations demonstrate a\n                                               7\n\fhigh degree of autonomy. Other statutory provisions, however, reveal limits on\n\nPHEAA’s autonomy. PHEAA is subject to state audits and is required to report annually\n\nto the Governor and the Legislature. 24 Pa. Stat. Ann. § 5108. Further, the composition\n\nof PHEAA’s board is determined by state officials: of its twenty members, one is the\n\nstate Secretary of Education, three are appointed by the Governor, eight are appointed by\n\nthe President pro tempore of the state Senate, and eight are appointed by the Speaker of\n\nthe state House of Representatives. 71 Pa. Stat. Ann. § 111.2. State control of the\n\ncomposition of the board suggests PHEAA lacks autonomy and thus may be entitled to\n\nEleventh Amendment immunity. Christy, 54 F.3d at 1149. Viewing the allegations in\n\nthe complaint in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, however, we cannot definitively\n\nconclude that the third Fitchik factor weighs in favor of Eleventh Amendment immunity.\n\n       Because the first and third factors on this record do not weigh in favor of\n\nimmunity, we are unable to conclude at this stage that PHEAA has established it is\n\nentitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity. Accordingly, we will vacate the District\n\nCourt’s judgment and remand for further development of the factual record. Cf. U.S. ex\n\nrel. Oberg v. PHEAA, 745 F.3d 131, 140-41 (4th Cir. 2014) (vacating and remanding\n\nwith respect to status of PHEAA for similar reasons); Blake, 612 F.2d at 726 (vacating\n\nand remanding on Eleventh Amendment immunity question where, “in a close case . . . ,\n\nevidence beyond the mere statutory language is required”).\n\n\n\n\n                                             8\n\f                                              B\n\n       We next address whether the individual Defendants are entitled to qualified\n\nimmunity. “The doctrine of qualified immunity protects government officials from\n\nliability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established\n\nstatutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.”\n\nMesserschmidt v. Millender, 132 S. Ct. 1235, 1244 (2012) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted). The qualified immunity doctrine enables government officials “to preserve\n\ntheir ability to serve the public good or to ensure that talented candidates were not\n\ndeterred by the threat of damages suits from entering public service.” Wyatt v. Cole, 504\n\nU.S. 158, 167-68 (1992).\n\n       In light of the uncertainty of PHEAA’s status as a governmental entity under our\n\nEleventh Amendment analysis, we are unable to conclude that the individual defendants\n\nare government employees.7 We will therefore vacate the District Court’s dismissal of\n\nPlaintiffs’ claims against the individual Defendants in their individual capacities to\n\n       7\n         Qualified immunity also may be available to private individuals under certain\ncircumstances where they are in effect acting as government officials. See Filarsky v.\nDelia, 132 S. Ct. 1657, 1667-68 (2012) (extending qualified immunity under § 1983 to\nprivate investigator who “was retained by [a] [c]ity to assist in conducting an official\ninvestigation into potential wrongdoing”); see also Richardson v. McKnight, 521 U.S.\n399, 413 (1997) (holding qualified immunity under § 1983 is unavailable where “a\nprivate firm, systematically organized to assume a major lengthy administrative task\n(managing an institution) with limited direct supervision by the government, undertakes\nthat task for profit and potentially in competition with other firms”); Williams v.\nO’Leary, 55 F.3d 320, 323 (7th Cir. 1995) (permitting private defendant to raise qualified\nimmunity defense where he, “through his employer . . . , was under a government\ncontract to provide [medical] services to inmates which the State was obligated to\nprovide under the Constitution”).\n                                              9\n\fpermit development of a factual record with respect to the status of PHEAA to resolve\n\nboth its status as an arm of the state and whether its employees are government officials.8\n\nCf. Grant v. City of Pittsburgh, 98 F.3d 116, 122-23 (3d Cir. 1996) (remanding to district\n\ncourt for reevaluation of qualified immunity defense).\n\n                                            III\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we will vacate the judgment of the District Court and\n\nremand for further proceedings.\n\n\n\n\n       8\n         We express no opinion as to whether the District Court correctly concluded\nentitlement to compensation for pre-shift computer login time was not clearly established\nand that, as a result, the individual Defendants (if found to be government employees)\nwould be entitled to qualified immunity.\n                                            10\n\f",

The Eleventh Amendment “immunize[s] an\n\nunconsenting state from suits brought in federal courts by her own citizens as well as by\n\ncitizens of another state.” Fitchik, 873 F.2d at 658 (internal quotation marks omitted). A\n\nsuit brought against an entity that is in essence “an arm of the state” is similarly barred by\n\nthe Eleventh Amendment. Id. To determine whether such an entity is entitled to\n\nEleventh Amendment immunity, we consider: “(1) [w]hether the money that would pay\n\nthe judgment would come from the state,” which entails consideration of “whether\n\npayment will come from the state’s treasury, whether the agency has the money to satisfy\n\nthe judgment, and whether the sovereign has immunized itself from responsibility for the\n\nagency’s debts”;4 “(2) [t]he status of the agency under state law,” including “how state\n\n\n       3\n          The District Court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331.

We review the District Court’s dismissal of the complaint de\nnovo and “accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true, construe the complaint\nin the light favorable to the plaintiff, and ultimately determine whether plaintiff may be\nentitled to relief under any reasonable reading of the complaint.” Mayer v.

We treat Eleventh Amendment immunity as\n\nan affirmative defense, and “the party asserting [it] bears the burden of proving\n\nentitlement to it.” Christy v. Pa. Turnpike Comm’n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"696213\"><a href=\"/opinion/696213/charles-a-christy-v-pennsylvania-turnpike-commission-a-duly-organized/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1140</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1144 (3d Cir. 1995).\n\n       Presented with little beyond the allegations in the complaint (which we assume to\n\nbe true at this stage) and several Pennsylvania statutes, we cannot conclude that the\n\nFitchik factors necessarily cloak PHEAA with Eleventh Amendment immunity. As to\n\nthe first factor, the complaint asserts that PHEAA would be responsible for paying a\n\njudgment against it and that this burden would not fall directly on the state. The\n\ncomplaint’s allegation that Pennsylvania does not expend tax dollars “to support\n\nPHEAA’s lending, servicing, and other proprietary activities,” App. 55-56, is consistent\n\nwith the statutory scheme governing PHEAA, pursuant to which “no obligation of\n\n[PHEAA] shall be a debt of [Pennsylvania] and [PHEAA] shall have no power to pledge\n\nthe credit or taxing power of [Pennsylvania] nor to make its debts payable out of any\n\nmoneys except those of [PHEAA].” 24 Pa. Stat. Ann. § 5104(3). Further, PHEAA’s\n\nfunds are kept in a segregated account under the PHEAA board’s control, id. § 5105.10,\n\n\n\nthe first instance.” Benn v. First Judicial Dist. of Pa., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"792185\"><a href=\"/opinion/792185/donald-benn-v-first-judicial-district-of-pennsylvania-city-of-philadelphia/\"><span class=\"volume\">426</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">233</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 239-40 (3d Cir.\n2005) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n                                              5\n\fand used at its discretion to carry out its corporate purposes, id. § 5104(3); see Blake v.\n\nKline, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"373414\"><a href=\"/opinion/373414/blake-margaret-anne-a-minor-by-blake-james-her-guardian-v-kline/\"><span class=\"volume\">612</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">718</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 723 (3d Cir. 1979) (noting in Eleventh Amendment context that\n\nPennsylvania’s Public School Employees’ Retirement Board fund was “set apart in the\n\nstate treasury from general state funds” and “administered by the State Treasurer at the\n\ndirection of the Board” (footnote omitted)).5 Thus, viewing the allegations in the\n\ncomplaint as true and considering them in light of the statutory scheme governing\n\nPHEAA, we conclude that the first Fitchik factor weighs against Eleventh Amendment\n\nimmunity, as it appears that PHEAA would be obligated to pay any judgment against it\n\nfrom its segregated funds.\n\n       As to the second factor, PHEAA has allegedly stated “that it is not considered part\n\nof the primary government of Pennsylvania,” App. 61 (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted),6 but Pennsylvania law appears to treat it as an arm of the state. First, courts\n\n\n       5\n          Citing a Pennsylvania statute providing that the State Treasurer must generally\napprove payment of funds from the State Treasury, the District Court reasoned that\n“although the Commonwealth has disclaimed legal liability for PHEAA’s debts, payment\nof those debts will necessarily be taken from the State Treasury and require the approval\nof the State Treasurer.” App. 13 (citing 72 Pa. Stat. Ann. § 307). As this Court has made\nclear, however, it is the legal obligation to satisfy the agency’s debts that carries the most\nweight with respect to this first prong of the Eleventh Amendment analysis: “if a State is\nnot under a legal obligation to satisfy a judgment, then any increase in expenditures in the\nface of an adverse judgment is considered a voluntary or discretionary subsidy not\nentitled to Eleventh Amendment protections.” Bowers, 475 F.3d at 547 (emphasis in\noriginal). The present record provides no indication that Pennsylvania is legally\nobligated to satisfy a judgment against PHEAA and, for this further reason, we cannot\nhold that application of the first Fitchik factor favors Eleventh Amendment immunity.\n        6\n          Although the complaint alleges that “PHEAA is not an arm of the\nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania,” App. 55, this is a legal conclusion and is not entitled to\nthe assumption of truth. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145875\"><a href=\"/opinion/145875/ashcroft-v-iqbal/\"><span class=\"volume\">556</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">662</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 678 (2009).\n                                              6\n\fhave described PHEAA as “undeniably an agency of the Commonwealth.” PHEAA v.\n\nBarksdale, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">688</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 689-90 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1982). Second, PHEAA’s enabling\n\nlegislation describes it as “a public corporation and government instrumentality,” 24 Pa.\n\nStat. Ann. § 5101, with the public purpose of “improv[ing] the higher educational\n\nopportunities of persons who are residents of [Pennsylvania] . . . by assisting them in\n\nmeeting their expenses of higher education,” id. § 5102, and thereby performing “an\n\nessential governmental function,” id. § 5105.6. Thus, on the limited record before us, the\n\nsecond Fitchik factor weighs in favor of Eleventh Amendment immunity.\n\n       The third Fitchik factor—PHEAA’s autonomy—presents a close question that is\n\ndifficult to resolve without the benefit of additional facts. Several allegations in the\n\ncomplaint are supported by statutory provisions that govern PHEAA and are suggestive\n\nof its autonomy. First, PHEAA allegedly uses no tax dollars to support its salaries or\n\nactivities, and it is controlled by a relatively autonomous board of directors that has\n\nunfettered control over PHEAA funds kept in a segregated account within the state’s\n\nTreasury. Id. §§ 5014(3), 5105.10. Second, PHEAA may independently enter into\n\ncontracts, id. § 5104(1.1)(iii), (4); Christy, 54 F.3d at 1149 (ability to enter contracts in its\n\nown name demonstrates Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission’s autonomy), sue and be\n\nsued in its own name, purchase and sell property, borrow money, earn profits from\n\ninvestments, and provide substantial bonuses to its executives. Third, PHEAA describes\n\nitself as more akin to a corporation than a state agency and states that it competes with\n\nloan servicing competitors nationwide. App. 59. These factual allegations demonstrate a\n                                               7\n\fhigh degree of autonomy. Other statutory provisions, however, reveal limits on\n\nPHEAA’s autonomy. PHEAA is subject to state audits and is required to report annually\n\nto the Governor and the Legislature. 24 Pa. Stat. Ann. § 5108. Further, the composition\n\nof PHEAA’s board is determined by state officials: of its twenty members, one is the\n\nstate Secretary of Education, three are appointed by the Governor, eight are appointed by\n\nthe President pro tempore of the state Senate, and eight are appointed by the Speaker of\n\nthe state House of Representatives. 71 Pa. Stat. Ann. § 111.2. State control of the\n\ncomposition of the board suggests PHEAA lacks autonomy and thus may be entitled to\n\nEleventh Amendment immunity. Christy, 54 F.3d at 1149. Viewing the allegations in\n\nthe complaint in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, however, we cannot definitively\n\nconclude that the third Fitchik factor weighs in favor of Eleventh Amendment immunity.\n\n       Because the first and third factors on this record do not weigh in favor of\n\nimmunity, we are unable to conclude at this stage that PHEAA has established it is\n\nentitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity. Accordingly, we will vacate the District\n\nCourt’s judgment and remand for further development of the factual record. Cf. U.S. ex\n\nrel. Oberg v. PHEAA, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">745</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">131</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 140-41 (4th Cir. 2014) (vacating and remanding\n\nwith respect to status of PHEAA for similar reasons); Blake, 612 F.2d at 726 (vacating\n\nand remanding on Eleventh Amendment immunity question where, “in a close case . . . ,\n\nevidence beyond the mere statutory language is required”).\n\n\n\n\n                                             8\n\f                                              B\n\n       We next address whether the individual Defendants are entitled to qualified\n\nimmunity. “The doctrine of qualified immunity protects government officials from\n\nliability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established\n\nstatutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.”\n\nMesserschmidt v.
