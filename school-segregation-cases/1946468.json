R. 47.5, the court has determined\nthat this opinion should not be published and is not precedent\nexcept under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR. R.\n47.5.4.\n\fthe Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et\n\nseq. (1994).    Stalcup appeals from the district court’s grant of\n\nsummary judgment in favor of Defendant-Appellee the Communication\n\nWorkers of America.     For the following reasons, we AFFIRM the\n\njudgment of the district court.\n\n                  I.   Factual and Procedural History\n\n     Janis A. Stalcup began her employment with Southwestern Bell\n\nTelephone Company (“SWB”) in July 1977.     During her employment\n\nwith SWB, Stalcup was a member of the Communication Workers of\n\nAmerica (“CWA”), the collective bargaining representative for SWB\n\nemployees.     Over the course of her employment, Stalcup suffered\n\nfrom a condition known as Multiple Chemical Sensitivity.\n\nAccording to Stalcup, this condition led to chronic sinusitis,\n\nupper respiratory infections, sinus headaches, migraines,\n\nseizures, difficulty sleeping, chronic diarrhea, and colon\n\nspasms.   These medical problems caused Stalcup to be absent from\n\nwork on many occasions.     On July 9, 1993, Stalcup was terminated\n\nfrom her job as a supplies attendant because of unsatisfactory\n\nattendance.\n\n      Stalcup alleges that her attendance problems and eventual\n\ntermination were caused, at least in part, by CWA’s\n\ndiscriminatory behavior.     Specifically, Stalcup asserts that CWA\n\nengaged in discrimination prohibited by the Americans with\n\nDisabilities Act of 1990 (the “ADA”) by refusing to file, appeal,\n\n\n\n                                   2\n\for arbitrate Stalcup’s grievances claiming disability\n\ndiscrimination, by refusing to secure favorable accommodations\n\nfor Stalcup under the ADA, and by failing to discipline CWA\n\nmembers regarding discriminatory acts against Stalcup.    Stalcup\n\nfiled charges of disability discrimination with the Equal\n\nEmployment Opportunity Commission (the “EEOC”) against both SWB\n\nand CWA.    Stalcup received a letter from the EEOC, dated April 7,\n\n2000, informing her of her right to sue CWA.    Stalcup filed suit\n\nagainst CWA in federal district court on July 7, 2000.1    CWA\n\nmoved for summary judgment on April 16, 2001, and the district\n\ncourt granted summary judgment in favor of CWA on September 4,\n\n2001.    The district court concluded that Stalcup failed to\n\ndemonstrate that she is a “qualified individual with a\n\ndisability” under the ADA and, in the alternative, failed to\n\nestablish a prima facie case of disability discrimination by CWA.\n\nStalcup timely appealed to this court.\n\n              II.   Summary Judgment Standard of Review\n\n     We review a grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the\n\nsame standards as the district court.    Chaney v. New Orleans Pub.\n\nFacility Mgmt., Inc., 179 F.3d 164, 167 (5th Cir. 1999).       Summary\n\njudgment is proper when “there is no genuine issue as to any\n\nmaterial fact and [] the moving party is entitled to a judgment\n\n     1\n        Stalcup sued SWB in a separate lawsuit filed in\nSeptember 1995. That suit eventually settled. A third-party\ncomplaint filed in this case by CWA against SWB was voluntarily\ndismissed on March 26, 2001.\n\n                                  3\n\fas a matter of law.”    FED. R. CIV. P. 56(c).    We view the evidence\n\nin a light most favorable to the non-movant.        Coleman v. Houston\n\nIndep. Sch. Dist., 113 F.3d 528, 533 (5th Cir. 1997).       However,\n\nif the moving party presents sufficient evidence to support\n\nsummary judgment, the non-movant must go beyond the pleadings and\n\ncome forward with specific facts indicating a genuine issue for\n\ntrial in order to avoid summary judgment.        Celotex Corp. v.\n\nCatrett, 477 U.S. 317, 324 (1986).\n\n               III.    Stalcup’s ADA Claim Against CWA\n\n     The ADA prohibits discrimination by a “covered entity”\n\nagainst “a qualified individual with a disability because of the\n\ndisability of such individual in regard to job application\n\nprocedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees,\n\nemployee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions,\n\nand privileges of employment.”    42 U.S.C. § 12112(a).     A “covered\n\nentity” includes a “labor organization.”     Id. at § 12111(2).     The\n\nparties do not dispute that the expansive discrimination claims\n\nalleged by Stalcup fall within the purview of the ADA because\n\nthey relate to “job application procedures, the hiring,\n\nadvancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation,\n\njob training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of\n\nemployment.”   In response to Stalcup’s claims, CWA argues that\n\nthe district court was correct in concluding: (1) that Stalcup is\n\nnot a “qualified individual with a disability” under the ADA and\n\n\n\n                                   4\n\f(2) that, even if Stalcup is a “qualified individual with a\n\ndisability,” she fails to establish a prima facie case of\n\ndisability discrimination.\n\n     A. Elements of a Prima Facie Case of Discrimination by a\n     Union\n\n     Neither this court nor any of our sister courts of appeals\n\nhas specified the elements of a prima facie case for\n\ndiscrimination by a union in the context of the ADA.   However, we\n\nhave previously recognized that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act\n\nof 1964 (“Title VII”) and the ADA are similar in their language,\n\npurposes, and remedial structures.2   Flowers v. S. Reg’l\n\nPhysician Servs. Inc., 247 F.3d 229, 234 (5th Cir. 2001).\n\nBecause of this similarity, we regularly borrow from Title VII\n\njurisprudence when analyzing ADA claims.   See, e.g., id. at 234-\n\n35; Miller v. Pub. Storage Mgmt., Inc., 121 F.3d 215, 218 (5th\n\nCir. 1997); Buchanan v. City of San Antonio, 85 F.3d 196, 200\n\n\n     2\n        Title VII provides that it is unlawful for an employer:\n          (1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge\n          any individual, or otherwise to discriminate\n          against any individual with respect to his\n          compensation, terms, conditions, or\n          privileges of employment, because of such\n          individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or\n          national origin; or\n          (2) to limit, segregate, or classify his\n          employees or applicants for employment in any\n          way which would deprive or tend to deprive\n          any individual of employment opportunities or\n          otherwise adversely affect his status as an\n          employee, because of such individual's race,\n          color, religion, sex, or national origin.\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a) (1994).\n\n                                5\n\f(5th Cir. 1996); Daigle v. Liberty Life Ins. Co., 70 F.3d 394,\n\n396 (5th Cir. 1995).   Thus, we now turn to Title VII\n\njurisprudence for assistance in determining the elements of\n\nStalcup’s prima facie case.\n\n     The Seventh Circuit, in Bugg v. International Union of\n\nAllied Industrial Workers of America, Local 507, 674 F.2d 595\n\n(7th Cir. 1982), first articulated the elements of a prima facie\n\ncase of discrimination by a union.     Under Bugg, a plaintiff\n\nestablishes a prima facie case against a union by showing: “(1)\n\nthat the [employer] committed a violation of the collective\n\nbargaining agreement with respect to the plaintiff; (2) that the\n\n[union] permitted that breach to go unrepaired, thus breaching\n\nits own duty of fair representation; and (3) that there was some\n\nindication that the [union’s] actions were motivated by racial\n\nanimus.”   Id. at 598 n.5.    In analyzing Stalcup’s prima facie\n\ncase of discrimination, the district court in this case applied\n\nthe Bugg elements.\n\n     Stalcup argues that, instead of analyzing her prima facie\n\ncase under the Bugg elements, the district court should have\n\nlooked for guidance from the Supreme Court’s opinion in Goodman\n\nv. Lukens Steel Co., 482 U.S. 656 (1987).     In Goodman, African-\n\nAmerican employees asserted racial discrimination claims under\n\nTitle VII against their union.     Id. at 658-59.   The employees\n\nargued that the union discriminated against them by repeatedly\n\nfailing to include assertions of racial discrimination in\n\n                                   6\n\fgrievances filed with their employer.   Id. at 666.   The Court\n\nconcluded that “[a] union which intentionally avoids asserting\n\ndiscrimination claims, either so as not to antagonize the\n\nemployer and thus improve its chances of success on other issues,\n\nor in deference to the perceived desires of its white membership,\n\nis liable under [Title VII].”   Id. at 669 (internal citations and\n\nquotations omitted).   In coming to this conclusion, the Court\n\nnoted that the employees’ claims of disparate treatment required\n\na showing of intentional discrimination.   Id. at 668-69.\n\n     Stalcup argues that her case is factually analogous to\n\nGoodman because CWA intentionally avoided asserting her\n\ngrievances just as the union in Goodman refused to assert the\n\ngrievances of its African American members.   Stalcup further\n\nargues that a showing of intentional discrimination is sufficient\n\nunder Goodman to establish CWA’s ADA violation.   Stalcup\n\nmaintains that she is not required to show a breach of the\n\ncollective bargaining agreement, a breach of the duty of fair\n\nrepresentation, or animus in order to establish a prima facie\n\ncase of discrimination against CWA.   For purposes of this appeal\n\nonly, we assume that Stalcup is correct.   We assume that Stalcup\n\ncan establish an ADA violation with evidence of intentional\n\ndiscrimination and that she need not establish a breach of the\n\n\n\n\n                                 7\n\fcollective bargaining agreement, a breach of the duty of fair\n\nrepresentation, or animus.3\n\n     In order to establish intentional discrimination, Stalcup\n\nmay produce direct evidence of discrimination or may utilize the\n\nframework established by McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411\n\nU.S. 792 (1973), to raise an inference of discrimination.\n\nDaigle, 70 F.3d at 396.   In the ADA context, under the McDonnell\n\nDouglas framework, when asserting an ADA claim against an\n\nemployer, a plaintiff can establish a prima facie case of\n\ndiscrimination by showing that: (1) she suffers from a\n\ndisability; (2) she is qualified for the job; (3) she was subject\n\nto an adverse employment action; and (4) she was treated less\n\nfavorably than non-disabled employees.   Id.   It is well-\n\n\n     3\n        In Vaca v. Sipes, 386 U.S. 171 (1967), the Supreme Court\nestablished the parameters of the duty of fair representation.\nThe Court explained that a breach of the duty of fair\nrepresentation “occurs only when a union’s conduct toward a\nmember of the collective bargaining unit is arbitrary,\ndiscriminatory, or in bad faith.” Id. at 190. Given this\ndefinition of a breach of the duty of fair representation, there\nis not much difference between the Bugg and Goodman standards.\nOnce a Title VII plaintiff establishes intentional discrimination\nby a union – either with direct evidence or by using the burden-\nshifting framework of McDonnell Douglas – the plaintiff also\ninherently establishes a breach of the union’s duty of fair\nrepresentation. See Causey v. Ford Motor Co., 516 F.2d 416, 425\nn.12 (5th Cir. 1975) (observing that “[t]he fair representation\nduty under the [Labor Management Relations Act], as enumerated in\nVaca, overlaps with the Title VII protection, and the Vaca\nstandards (proscribing arbitrary, discriminatory, and bad faith\nconduct) apply in Title VII cases.”) (internal citations and\nquotations omitted). Thus, the real effect of our assumption in\nthis case is to excuse Stalcup from establishing a breach of the\ncollective bargaining agreement and animus.\n\n                                 8\n\festablished that prima facie elements are not set in stone but,\n\nrather, can be formulated to fit the circumstances of a\n\nparticular case.    McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802 n.13; see\n\nalso LaPierre v. Benson Nissan, Inc., 86 F.3d 444, 448 n.3 (5th\n\nCir. 1996) (noting that “[t]he elements of a plaintiff’s prima\n\nfacie case necessarily vary according to the facts of the case\n\nand the nature of the claim”).    The prima facie elements of an\n\nADA claim, as outlined by this court in Daigle, can be easily\n\nmanipulated to fit the contours of Stalcup’s discrimination claim\n\nagainst CWA.    Therefore, even assuming that Stalcup is not\n\nrequired to establish a breach of the collective bargaining\n\nagreement, a breach of the duty of fair representation, or animus\n\nto prevail, Stalcup must still establish that: (1) she suffers\n\nfrom a disability; (2) she was subject to an adverse union\n\naction; and (3) she was treated less favorably than non-disabled\n\nemployees.4    See Alexander v. Local 496, Laborers’ Int’l Union of\n\nN. Am., 177 F.3d 394, 402-03 (6th Cir. 1999) (requiring the\n\n\n\n\n     4\n        The second Daigle element, whether the plaintiff is\nqualified for the job, is irrelevant in this case because Stalcup\nis asserting discrimination in the context of the grievance\nprocess. Stalcup is entitled to a non-discriminatory grievance\nprocess regardless of her job qualifications. However, it is\ncertainly conceivable that some claims of union discrimination\nwould require a showing of job qualification to establish a prima\nfacie case. For example, a prima facie case of discrimination by\na union based on the union’s failure to recommend the plaintiff\nfor a promotion might require a showing that the plaintiff is\nqualified for the promotion.\n\n                                  9\n\fplaintiff to demonstrate similar elements in order to establish a\n\nprima facie case of discrimination by a union).\n\n     B. Did Stalcup Establish a Prima Facie Case of\n     Discrimination by CWA?\n\n     Accepting arguendo that Stalcup is disabled, we nevertheless\n\nconclude that Stalcup did not establish a prima facie case of\n\ndiscrimination by CWA because Stalcup has not established by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence that CWA treated her less favorably\n\nthan non-disabled employees.    Stalcup’s evidence shows that CWA\n\ndid not fully pursue all of Stalcup’s complaints.   Although CWA\n\npursued some of Stalcup’s complaints with formal grievances, CWA\n\naddressed other complaints with informal grievances or informal\n\nmeetings with SWB management.   Viewing the evidence in a light\n\nmost favorable to Stalcup, CWA apparently decided not to pursue\n\nwith SWB some of Stalcup’s complaints at all.   However, nothing\n\nin the record suggests that CWA’s handling of Stalcup’s\n\ncomplaints was different than its handling of complaints from\n\nnon-disabled employees.\n\n     In Vaca, the Court emphasized the importance of a union’s\n\npower “to settle the majority of grievances short of the costlier\n\nand more time-consuming steps” of the grievance process.     386\n\nU.S. at 192.   The evidence in the record shows that CWA addressed\n\neach of Stalcup’s documented complaints in some manner, even if\n\nit ultimately decided not to submit each one to the higher steps\n\nof the grievance process or to arbitration.   In answer to\n\n\n                                 10\n\fStalcup’s many complaints, CWA successfully prompted SWB to\n\nimplement a number of workplace accommodations which eased\n\nStalcup’s discomfort.   For example, SWB designated a smoke-free,\n\nfragrance-free vehicle for Stalcup’s use, installed a ventilation\n\nsystem in the smoking lounge, moved the employee refrigerator out\n\nof the smoking lounge, and prohibited employees from bringing\n\nnon-necessary fragrance sources into the workplace.   At Stalcup’s\n\nrequest, CWA also discussed with management SWB’s by-passing of\n\nStalcup for the position of Operator, a position for which\n\nStalcup was qualified and was the senior applicant.   CWA secured\n\nSWB’s agreement to offer the position to Stalcup, who\n\nsubsequently refused to accept the position.\n\n     Furthermore, CWA filed formal grievances regarding Stalcup’s\n\nfinal suspension and termination from SWB.   CWA processed those\n\ngrievances through all the steps of the grievance process,\n\narguing at each step that SWB had acted too harshly in\n\nterminating Stalcup.    In the grievance meetings, CWA urged SWB to\n\nprovide Stalcup with the remedies she sought, including\n\nreinstatement after termination, correction of her attendance\n\nrecords, improved indoor air quality, unlimited access to\n\nrestrooms, a transfer to another department, and a compensatory\n\nlump sum settlement or disability pension.   No evidence in the\n\nrecord suggests that CWA exerts greater efforts for non-disabled\n\nemployees than it did for Stalcup.    Stalcup’s subjective belief\n\nof discrimination is not sufficient to warrant judicial relief.\n\n                                 11\n\fBauer v. Albemarle Corp., 169 F.3d 962, 967 (5th Cir. 1999).\n\nThus, we conclude that Stalcup fails to demonstrate by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence that CWA treated her less favorably\n\nthan non-disabled employees.   Because Stalcup’s prima facie case\n\nof disability discrimination fails on this ground, we need not\n\nconsider whether Stalcup has demonstrated the other elements of a\n\nprima facie case of discrimination by a union.\n\n                         IV.   Conclusion\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, we find that the district court\n\nproperly granted summary judgment for CWA.   The district court\n\ncorrectly concluded that Stalcup has failed to establish her\n\nprima facie case of disability discrimination.   Accordingly, we\n\nAFFIRM the district court’s judgment in favor of CWA.\n\n\n\n\n                                12\n\f",

Over the course of her employment, Stalcup suffered\n\nfrom a condition known as Multiple Chemical Sensitivity.\n\nAccording to Stalcup, this condition led to chronic sinusitis,\n\nupper respiratory infections, sinus headaches, migraines,\n\nseizures, difficulty sleeping, chronic diarrhea, and colon\n\nspasms.   These medical problems caused Stalcup to be absent from\n\nwork on many occasions.     On July 9, 1993, Stalcup was terminated\n\nfrom her job as a supplies attendant because of unsatisfactory\n\nattendance.\n\n      Stalcup alleges that her attendance problems and eventual\n\ntermination were caused, at least in part, by CWA’s\n\ndiscriminatory behavior.     Specifically, Stalcup asserts that CWA\n\nengaged in discrimination prohibited by the Americans with\n\nDisabilities Act of 1990 (the “ADA”) by refusing to file, appeal,\n\n\n\n                                   2\n\for arbitrate Stalcup’s grievances claiming disability\n\ndiscrimination, by refusing to secure favorable accommodations\n\nfor Stalcup under the ADA, and by failing to discipline CWA\n\nmembers regarding discriminatory acts against Stalcup.    Stalcup\n\nfiled charges of disability discrimination with the Equal\n\nEmployment Opportunity Commission (the “EEOC”) against both SWB\n\nand CWA.    Stalcup received a letter from the EEOC, dated April 7,\n\n2000, informing her of her right to sue CWA.    Stalcup filed suit\n\nagainst CWA in federal district court on July 7, 2000.1    CWA\n\nmoved for summary judgment on April 16, 2001, and the district\n\ncourt granted summary judgment in favor of CWA on September 4,\n\n2001.    The district court concluded that Stalcup failed to\n\ndemonstrate that she is a “qualified individual with a\n\ndisability” under the ADA and, in the alternative, failed to\n\nestablish a prima facie case of disability discrimination by CWA.\n\nStalcup timely appealed to this court.\n\n              II.

Stalcup’s ADA Claim Against CWA\n\n     The ADA prohibits discrimination by a “covered entity”\n\nagainst “a qualified individual with a disability because of the\n\ndisability of such individual in regard to job application\n\nprocedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees,\n\nemployee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions,\n\nand privileges of employment.”    42 U.S.C. § 12112(a).     A “covered\n\nentity” includes a “labor organization.”     Id. at § 12111(2).     The\n\nparties do not dispute that the expansive discrimination claims\n\nalleged by Stalcup fall within the purview of the ADA because\n\nthey relate to “job application procedures, the hiring,\n\nadvancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation,\n\njob training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of\n\nemployment.”   In response to Stalcup’s claims, CWA argues that\n\nthe district court was correct in concluding: (1) that Stalcup is\n\nnot a “qualified individual with a disability” under the ADA and\n\n\n\n                                   4\n\f(2) that, even if Stalcup is a “qualified individual with a\n\ndisability,” she fails to establish a prima facie case of\n\ndisability discrimination.\n\n     A. Elements of a Prima Facie Case of Discrimination by a\n     Union\n\n     Neither this court nor any of our sister courts of appeals\n\nhas specified the elements of a prima facie case for\n\ndiscrimination by a union in the context of the ADA.   However, we\n\nhave previously recognized that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act\n\nof 1964 (“Title VII”) and the ADA are similar in their language,\n\npurposes, and remedial structures.2   Flowers v.

Under Bugg, a plaintiff\n\nestablishes a prima facie case against a union by showing: “(1)\n\nthat the [employer] committed a violation of the collective\n\nbargaining agreement with respect to the plaintiff; (2) that the\n\n[union] permitted that breach to go unrepaired, thus breaching\n\nits own duty of fair representation; and (3) that there was some\n\nindication that the [union’s] actions were motivated by racial\n\nanimus.”   Id. at 598 n.5.    In analyzing Stalcup’s prima facie\n\ncase of discrimination, the district court in this case applied\n\nthe Bugg elements.\n\n     Stalcup argues that, instead of analyzing her prima facie\n\ncase under the Bugg elements, the district court should have\n\nlooked for guidance from the Supreme Court’s opinion in Goodman\n\nv.

In Goodman, African-\n\nAmerican employees asserted racial discrimination claims under\n\nTitle VII against their union.     Id. at 658-59.   The employees\n\nargued that the union discriminated against them by repeatedly\n\nfailing to include assertions of racial discrimination in\n\n                                   6\n\fgrievances filed with their employer.   Id. at 666.   The Court\n\nconcluded that “[a] union which intentionally avoids asserting\n\ndiscrimination claims, either so as not to antagonize the\n\nemployer and thus improve its chances of success on other issues,\n\nor in deference to the perceived desires of its white membership,\n\nis liable under [Title VII].”   Id. at 669 (internal citations and\n\nquotations omitted).   In coming to this conclusion, the Court\n\nnoted that the employees’ claims of disparate treatment required\n\na showing of intentional discrimination.   Id. at 668-69.\n\n     Stalcup argues that her case is factually analogous to\n\nGoodman because CWA intentionally avoided asserting her\n\ngrievances just as the union in Goodman refused to assert the\n\ngrievances of its African American members.   Stalcup further\n\nargues that a showing of intentional discrimination is sufficient\n\nunder Goodman to establish CWA’s ADA violation.   Stalcup\n\nmaintains that she is not required to show a breach of the\n\ncollective bargaining agreement, a breach of the duty of fair\n\nrepresentation, or animus in order to establish a prima facie\n\ncase of discrimination against CWA.   For purposes of this appeal\n\nonly, we assume that Stalcup is correct.   We assume that Stalcup\n\ncan establish an ADA violation with evidence of intentional\n\ndiscrimination and that she need not establish a breach of the\n\n\n\n\n                                 7\n\fcollective bargaining agreement, a breach of the duty of fair\n\nrepresentation, or animus.3\n\n     In order to establish intentional discrimination, Stalcup\n\nmay produce direct evidence of discrimination or may utilize the\n\nframework established by McDonnell Douglas Corp. v.

In the ADA context, under the McDonnell\n\nDouglas framework, when asserting an ADA claim against an\n\nemployer, a plaintiff can establish a prima facie case of\n\ndiscrimination by showing that: (1) she suffers from a\n\ndisability; (2) she is qualified for the job; (3) she was subject\n\nto an adverse employment action; and (4) she was treated less\n\nfavorably than non-disabled employees.

Given this\ndefinition of a breach of the duty of fair representation, there\nis not much difference between the Bugg and Goodman standards.\nOnce a Title VII plaintiff establishes intentional discrimination\nby a union – either with direct evidence or by using the burden-\nshifting framework of McDonnell Douglas – the plaintiff also\ninherently establishes a breach of the union’s duty of fair\nrepresentation.

The prima facie elements of an\n\nADA claim, as outlined by this court in Daigle, can be easily\n\nmanipulated to fit the contours of Stalcup’s discrimination claim\n\nagainst CWA.    Therefore, even assuming that Stalcup is not\n\nrequired to establish a breach of the collective bargaining\n\nagreement, a breach of the duty of fair representation, or animus\n\nto prevail, Stalcup must still establish that: (1) she suffers\n\nfrom a disability; (2) she was subject to an adverse union\n\naction; and (3) she was treated less favorably than non-disabled\n\nemployees.4    See Alexander v.

Stalcup is entitled to a non-discriminatory grievance\nprocess regardless of her job qualifications. However, it is\ncertainly conceivable that some claims of union discrimination\nwould require a showing of job qualification to establish a prima\nfacie case. For example, a prima facie case of discrimination by\na union based on the union’s failure to recommend the plaintiff\nfor a promotion might require a showing that the plaintiff is\nqualified for the promotion.\n\n                                  9\n\fplaintiff to demonstrate similar elements in order to establish a\n\nprima facie case of discrimination by a union).\n\n     B. Did Stalcup Establish a Prima Facie Case of\n     Discrimination by CWA?\n\n     Accepting arguendo that Stalcup is disabled, we nevertheless\n\nconclude that Stalcup did not establish a prima facie case of\n\ndiscrimination by CWA because Stalcup has not established by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence that CWA treated her less favorably\n\nthan non-disabled employees.    Stalcup’s evidence shows that CWA\n\ndid not fully pursue all of Stalcup’s complaints.   Although CWA\n\npursued some of Stalcup’s complaints with formal grievances, CWA\n\naddressed other complaints with informal grievances or informal\n\nmeetings with SWB management.   Viewing the evidence in a light\n\nmost favorable to Stalcup, CWA apparently decided not to pursue\n\nwith SWB some of Stalcup’s complaints at all.   However, nothing\n\nin the record suggests that CWA’s handling of Stalcup’s\n\ncomplaints was different than its handling of complaints from\n\nnon-disabled employees.\n\n     In Vaca, the Court emphasized the importance of a union’s\n\npower “to settle the majority of grievances short of the costlier\n\nand more time-consuming steps” of the grievance process.     386\n\nU.S. at 192.   The evidence in the record shows that CWA addressed\n\neach of Stalcup’s documented complaints in some manner, even if\n\nit ultimately decided not to submit each one to the higher steps\n\nof the grievance process or to arbitration.   In answer to\n\n\n                                 10\n\fStalcup’s many complaints, CWA successfully prompted SWB to\n\nimplement a number of workplace accommodations which eased\n\nStalcup’s discomfort.   For example, SWB designated a smoke-free,\n\nfragrance-free vehicle for Stalcup’s use, installed a ventilation\n\nsystem in the smoking lounge, moved the employee refrigerator out\n\nof the smoking lounge, and prohibited employees from bringing\n\nnon-necessary fragrance sources into the workplace.   At Stalcup’s\n\nrequest, CWA also discussed with management SWB’s by-passing of\n\nStalcup for the position of Operator, a position for which\n\nStalcup was qualified and was the senior applicant.   CWA secured\n\nSWB’s agreement to offer the position to Stalcup, who\n\nsubsequently refused to accept the position.\n\n     Furthermore, CWA filed formal grievances regarding Stalcup’s\n\nfinal suspension and termination from SWB.   CWA processed those\n\ngrievances through all the steps of the grievance process,\n\narguing at each step that SWB had acted too harshly in\n\nterminating Stalcup.    In the grievance meetings, CWA urged SWB to\n\nprovide Stalcup with the remedies she sought, including\n\nreinstatement after termination, correction of her attendance\n\nrecords, improved indoor air quality, unlimited access to\n\nrestrooms, a transfer to another department, and a compensatory\n\nlump sum settlement or disability pension.   No evidence in the\n\nrecord suggests that CWA exerts greater efforts for non-disabled\n\nemployees than it did for Stalcup.    Stalcup’s subjective belief\n\nof discrimination is not sufficient to warrant judicial relief.\n\n                                 11\n\fBauer v.

Because Stalcup’s prima facie case\n\nof disability discrimination fails on this ground, we need not\n\nconsider whether Stalcup has demonstrated the other elements of a\n\nprima facie case of discrimination by a union.\n\n                         IV.   Conclusion\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, we find that the district court\n\nproperly granted summary judgment for CWA.   The district court\n\ncorrectly concluded that Stalcup has failed to establish her\n\nprima facie case of disability discrimination.   Accordingly, we\n\nAFFIRM the district court’s judgment in favor of CWA.\n\n\n\n\n                                12\n\f</pre>",
