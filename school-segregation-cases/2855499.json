The plaintiffs, prisoners incarcerated\nat Tamms Correctional Center (“Tamms”) in Illinois,\nbrought this § 1983 action against officers and employees of\nthe Illinois Department of Corrections (collectively,\n“IDOC”). The prisoners alleged that their transfers to\nTamms violated their rights to due process of law and\n\f2                                                No. 03-3318\n\nfreedom of association and against ex post facto punish-\nment. The district court dismissed these counts for failure to\nstate a claim. Another count, alleging that the transfer\nconstituted retaliation for the exercise of First Amendment\nrights, survived this initial scrutiny. The parties then\nconducted discovery on this remaining count. Following\ndiscovery, the district court granted summary judgment to\nIDOC. The prisoners appeal the decision of the district court\nwith respect to all of these claims. After oral argument, we\nordered the parties to file supplemental briefs addressing\nthe administrative process by which an inmate, already\nincarcerated at Tamms, can challenge his assignment to that\nfacility. After the Supreme Court decided Wilkinson v.\nAustin, 125 S. Ct. 2384 (2005), the parties filed supplemental\nbriefs addressing the applicability of that decision to this\ncase. For the reasons set forth in the following opinion, we\naffirm the judgment of the district court with respect to the\nfreedom of association and ex post facto claims. With\nrespect to the retaliation and due process claims, we reverse\nthe judgment of the district court and remand the case for\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n                              I\n                     BACKGROUND\nA. Facts\n  Tamms is the highest security prison in Illinois. IDOC\ndesigned the conditions there to be harsh, so that the threat\nof being transferred to Tamms would deter prisoners\nthroughout the system from disobeying prison rules.\nAccording to IDOC, all Tamms prisoners are exposed to\nhardships that are not experienced in segregated confine-\n\fNo. 03-3318                                                        3\n                                                                    1\nment at any other maximum security facility in Illinois.\nIDOC transferred the plaintiffs to Tamms within a year after\nit opened.\n                  2\n  The plaintiffs are organized into two categories, labeled\ngenerally the “litigation plaintiffs” and the “gang plaintiffs.”\nThe gang plaintiffs, some of whom are also litigation\nplaintiffs, are associated with prison gangs (in IDOC\nterminology, “Security Threat Groups” or “STGs”). The\ngang plaintiffs claim that IDOC encouraged their gang\nactivity before 1996, but then changed policies and now\ntransfers gang leaders to Tamms for no reason but their\ngang affiliation. The litigation plaintiffs submit that IDOC\nhas a policy of transferring inmates with a history of filing\nactions, grievances or other complaints about IDOC and\nprison conditions. They claim that IDOC has a policy of\ntransferring prisoners with litigation histories to Tamms as\na means of retaliating for the trouble they cause the depart-\nment through their litigation activities. Each of these\nprisoners asserts that his disciplinary history does not\nwarrant an assignment to Tamms.\n\n\n\n\n1\n  In their initial complaint, the plaintiffs described the purpose\nof Tamms and the harshness of confinement conditions there. In\nthis appeal, IDOC has accepted the descriptions as true.\n2\n   Of the thirty-three captioned appellants in this case, Mr. Carroll\nhas been dismissed by his own request and Mr. Chapman\ncommitted suicide in August 2004. Of the remaining defendants,\nit appears that several have been released from IDOC’s custody\nor no longer are at Tamms. To the extent that the appellants no\nlonger are in custody or are incarcerated at Tamms, they lack\nstanding to request injunctive relief from their assignment to\nTamms.\n\f4                                                 No. 03-3318\n\nB. District Court Proceedings\n   In a four-count § 1983 complaint, only three counts of\nwhich are now before this court, the gang plaintiffs alleged\nviolations of the First Amendment right of association and\nof the right to be free from ex post facto punishment. The\nlitigation plaintiffs sought money damages and injunctive\nrelief for retaliatory interference with their First Amend-\nment right to petition the courts. All prisoners asserted\nviolations of their right to due process.\n  The district court conducted a preliminary screening of\nthe prisoners’ complaints. See 28 U.S.C. § 1915A. This review\nresulted in the dismissal for failure to state a claim of the\ndue process claim of all the prisoners as well as the associa-\ntional rights claim and the ex post facto claim of the gang\nplaintiffs.\n  With respect to the retaliation claim, the district court held\nthat the litigation plaintiffs met the threshold requirements\nof § 1915A because retaliation for exercising one’s right to\naccess to the courts is a cognizable constitutional claim, and\nthe prisoners had pleaded sufficiently such a claim. How-\never, the district court struck, as a discovery sanction, a\ngood deal of the evidence submitted by the prisoners on the\nissue of retaliation. Subsequently, it granted the state\nofficials summary judgment on the retaliation claim.\n   A more detailed rendition of the district court’s rationale\nis set forth in our discussion of each claim on appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                              II\n\fNo. 03-3318                                                5\n\n                      DISCUSSION\nA. The Gang Plaintiffs’ Claims\n  The gang plaintiffs asserted that their transfer to Tamms,\non account of gang membership, violated their First\nAmendment right to freedom of association and the Ex Post\nFacto Clause. The district court rejected the associational\nrights claim on the grounds that the prisoners had no First\nAmendment right to belong to a gang and that regulating\ngang activity served legitimate penological goals. The court\nrejected the ex post facto argument because the change in\nprison conditions constituted a reasonable regulation and\nnot additional punishment. Therefore, reasoned the district\ncourt, even if IDOC transferred them to Tamms in retalia-\ntion for their gang activities, the gang plaintiffs had no\ncognizable claim.\n  We review these § 1915A dismissals de novo. Calhoun v.\nDeTella, 319 F.3d 936, 939 (7th Cir. 2003). In undertaking\nsuch a review, we must construe all allegations as true and\nin the light most favorable to the prisoners. Id.\n\n\n    1. Freedom of Association\n  The gang plaintiffs submit that IDOC’s policy of transfer-\nring STG members to Tamms violates their First Amend-\nment right of association. They allege that IDOC’s policy\nprior to 1996 encouraged gang membership; current policy,\nby contrast, restricts prisoners’ rights to associate with\n               3\nprison gangs. The gang plaintiffs challenge IDOC’s regula-\ntions that allow officials to transfer prisoners who are gang\n\n\n3\n  At oral argument, IDOC admitted that prisons in the system\nhad a pre-1996 practice of cooperating with prison gangs to\nmaintain order in the facilities.\n\f6                                                   No. 03-3318\n\nmembers or “who may be planning to engage” in gang\nactivity, Ill. Admin. Code tit. 20, § 505.40(b), as unconstitu-\ntionally overbroad.\n  IDOC contends that the prisoners’ transfers to Tamms\nimplicate neither expressive nor intimate rights to associa-\ntion. In its view, regardless of whether IDOC once had a\npolicy of cooperating with prison gangs, prisoners have no\nFirst Amendment right to associate with gangs.\n   We agree with IDOC on this point. “Prison walls do not\nform a barrier separating prison inmates from the\nprotections of the Constitution.” Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78,\n84 (1987). “When a prison regulation or practice offends a\nfundamental constitutional guarantee, federal courts will\ndischarge their duty to protect constitutional rights.”\nProcunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396, 405-06 (1974). Although\nwe have not so held expressly, we have opined that “gang\nmembership seems not to implicate the right of association.”\nFuller ex rel. Fuller v. Decatur Pub. Sch. Bd. of Educ., 251 F.3d\n662, 667 (7th Cir. 2001) (citing City of Chicago v. Morales, 527\nU.S. 41 (1999)). But cf. Fuller v. Johnson, 114 F.3d 491, 498 (5th\nCir. 1997) (assuming protection but holding no constitu-\ntional error in admitting evidence of membership in a gang\nthat had committed brutal acts, as evidence of future\ndangerousness, with citation to Dawson v. Delaware, 503 U.S.\n159 (1992)).\n  We see no basis for maintaining that those who have been\nincarcerated as a result of a criminal conviction and conse-\nquently deprived of some of the most basic of associational\nopportunities during their imprisonment somehow retain\nthe right to belong to a gang within the prison walls when\nprison officials have determined that such a group is\ndetrimental to the achievement of the prison’s legitimate\npenological goals. The decision of prison administrators as\n\fNo. 03-3318                                                    7\n\nto the detrimental effect of such groups is a decision to\nwhich we owe great deference. See Jones v. North Carolina\nPrisoners’ Labor Union, Inc., 433 U.S. 119, 132 (1977). More-\nover, just recently, the Supreme Court spelled out, in no\nuncertain terms, the incompatibility of prison gangs with\nany penological system:\n    Prison security, imperiled by the brutal reality of prison\n    gangs, provides the backdrop of the State’s interest.\n    Clandestine, organized, fueled by race-based hostility,\n    and committed to fear and violence as a means of\n    disciplining their own members and their rivals, gangs\n    seek nothing less than to control prison life and to\n    extend their power outside prison walls. See Brief for\n    State of California et al. as Amici Curiae 6. Murder of an\n    inmate, a guard, or one of their family members on the\n    outside is a common form of gang discipline and\n    control, as well as a condition for membership in some\n    gangs. See, e.g., United States v. Santiago, 46 F.3d 885, 888\n    (C.A.9 1995); United States v. Silverstein, 732 F.2d 1338,\n    1341 (C.A.7 1984). Testifying against, or otherwise\n    informing on, gang activities can invite one’s own death\n    sentence. It is worth noting in this regard that for prison\n    gang members serving life sentences, some without the\n    possibility of parole, the deterrent effects of ordinary\n    criminal punishment may be substantially diminished.\n    See id., at 1343 (“[T]o many inmates of Marion’s Control\n    Unit [a federal Supermax facility,] the price of murder\n    must not be high and to some it must be close to zero”).\n\n\nWilkinson, 125 S. Ct. at 2396-97.\n  Although, in the past, some prison officials in Illinois\napparently intentionally abdicated their authority to prison\ngang leaders, this inexplicable deviation certainly does not\n\f8                                                  No. 03-3318\n\ncast doubt on the reality that prison gangs are a manifest\nthreat to prison order and discipline and that there is no\nfederal constitutional impediment to their ban by prison\nofficials. We thus agree with the district court that the gang\nplaintiffs’ contention that they have a right grounded in the\nFirst Amendment to belong to a prison gang is simply too\ntenuous to state a claim. See Jones, 433 U.S. at 126-29; Rios v.\nLane, 812 F.2d 1032, 1036 (7th Cir. 1987).\n\n\n    2. Ex Post Facto\n  The gang plaintiffs further submit that the district court\nerred in dismissing their § 1983 complaint because IDOC’s\npolicy of transferring them to Tamms violates the Ex Post\nFacto Clause of the Constitution. They base their argument\non IDOC’s pre-1996 policy of cooperating with prison\ngangs. According to the prisoners, IDOC’s policy shift from\nencouraging gang membership to transferring gang mem-\nbers to Tamms once the facility opened, constitutes ex post\n                                                  4\nfacto punishment of previously allowed activity.\n  The Ex Post Facto Clause forbids a legislature from\npassing laws retroactively altering the elements of or\nincreasing the punishment for a crime. California Dep’t of\nCorr. v. Morales, 514 U.S. 499, 504 (1995). For ex post facto\npurposes, therefore, we must address whether (1) the action\ncomplained of constitutes a “law,” and (2) the sanction can\nbe considered a “punishment.” Id.\n\n\n\n4\n  In the alternative, the prisoners argue that the change in\nIDOC’s policy violates their due process rights because they were\nnot given fair warning that gang membership would give rise to\nadditional criminal penalties. We discuss this alternative argu-\nment in the due process discussion infra.\n\fNo. 03-3318                                                   9\n\n  On the first inquiry, we generally have limited ex post\nfacto consideration to legislative acts, and have not ex-\ntended the definition to interpretations of law made by\nadministrative agencies. See Prater v. U.S. Parole Comm’n, 802\nF.2d 948 (7th Cir. 1986) (en banc). Under Illinois law, IDOC\nhas the discretionary authority to assign prisoners to any\nfacility in its system, 730 ILCS § 5/5-8-6(a), and we cannot\nsay that the exercise of this discretionary authority consti-\ntutes a “law” for ex post facto purposes.\n   The prisoners also fail the second inquiry. “As Collins [v.\nYoungblood, 497 U.S. 37 (1990)] and subsequent cases make\nclear, the Ex Post Facto Clause does not prohibit every\nalteration in a prisoner’s confinement that may work to his\ndisadvantage.” Gilbert v. Peters, 55 F.3d 237, 238 (7th Cir.\n1995). “Punishment” for ex post facto analysis concerns the\nlength of imprisonment, not the conditions of imprison-\nment. Garner v. Jones, 529 U.S. 244, 250 (2000); United States\nv. Shorty, 159 F.3d 312, 317 (7th Cir. 1998). We have noted\nthat a significant factor to consider in determining whether\na law is punitive is the statute’s purpose. Gilbert, 55 F.3d at\n238. Although a transfer to Tamms constitutes a change in\nthe conditions of confinement for a duly-convicted prisoner,\nit cannot be characterized as an increase in the punishment\nfor the crime of conviction, but rather is a response to\nlegitimate security concerns and forwards valid penological\ninterests. See Morales, 514 U.S. at 510.\n  The district court correctly dismissed the gang plaintiffs’\nex post facto claims.\n\n\nB. The Litigation Plaintiffs’ Claims\n   The litigation plaintiffs alleged that they had been sent to\nTamms in retaliation for filing lawsuits against IDOC and\nits officials. The district court determined that several of the\n\f10                                                   No. 03-3318\n\nprisoners—Mr. Felton, Mr. Horton, Mr. V. Rodriguez and\nMr. Santiago—had failed to exhaust their administrative\nremedies. It therefore dismissed the suits of these prisoners\nwithout prejudice.\n  IDOC moved for summary judgment. At the same time,\nthey moved to strike certain evidence offered by the prison-\ners in response, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n37(c)(1). The evidence consisted of affidavits indicating that\n                                                  5\ninformation in the prisoners’ placement forms was false.\nThe IDOC officials admitted relying upon these forms in\nmaking their transfer decisions. IDOC predicated its motion\nto strike on the assertion that the prisoners had presented\nthis evidence but had failed to amend answers to\npreviously-served IDOC interrogatories as required by\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 26.\n  The district court granted both the motion to strike and\nthe motion for summary judgment. On the motion to strike,\nthe substance of which is considered in greater detail below,\nthe court determined that the prisoners had insufficient\njustification for failing to amend their answers to IDOC\ninterrogatories. The district court therefore did not consider,\nwhen deciding the summary judgment motion, the prison-\ners’ claim that IDOC had placed them at Tamms based on\n                            6\nfalsified placement forms.\n\n\n5\n   Placement forms summarize personal information about the\nprisoner, including their segregation status and the STG affilia-\ntion or general disciplinary problems justifying their transfer to\nTamms.\n6\n  The district court also determined that the prisoners failed to\ndisclose facts supporting their claim against Mr. Snyder as\nrequested in the interrogatories. As a result, the court dismissed\n                                                     (continued...)\n\fNo. 03-3318                                                      11\n                                                             7\n  On the merits of the summary judgment motion, the\ndistrict court noted that, in order to prevail on their retalia-\ntion claim, the prisoners had to demonstrate that their\nconduct was constitutionally protected and that this conduct\n(the litigation previously filed by the prisoners) constituted\na substantial or motivating factor in IDOC’s decision to\ntransfer them to Tamms. Each prisoner presented a chronol-\nogy of events that allegedly demonstrated that their filing of\na previous lawsuit had motivated IDOC’s transfer decision.\n                                            8\nWith the sole exception of Mr. Clayton, the district court\ndetermined that the prisoners’ chronologies had failed to\nconnect their transfers to their previous litigation activity.\nBecause these prisoners had not offered any additional\nevidence, the court determined that they had not met their\nburden. The court further opined that the same result would\nobtain for Mr. Felton and Mr. Horton, had their cases not\nbeen dismissed for failure to exhaust.\n    The prisoners now appeal the district court’s § 1915A\n\n\n6\n (...continued)\nMr. Snyder as a defendant.\n7\n  The court also treated the motion for summary judgment as a\nmotion by all of the officials—including some defendants who\nhad not filed motions—because the Illinois Attorney General\nrepresented all of the defendants.\n8\n  As for Mr. Clayton, the district court noted that he had\npresented some evidence of a direct threat, made by one of the\nofficials named as defendants, to send him to Tamms because of\nhis grievances and lawsuits. However, because an official other\nthan the one who had allegedly threatened Mr. Clayton approved\nhis transfer, the district court determined that Mr. Clayton had\nfailed to connect his activities with his transfer. Therefore, with\nrespect to each of the prisoners, the district court granted\nsummary judgment in favor of the prison officials.\n\f12                                                 No. 03-3318\n\nruling based on exhaustion as well as its grant of IDOC’s\nmotions to strike and for summary judgment.\n\n\n  1. Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies\n  The Prison Litigation Reform Act (“PLRA”) prohibits\nprisoners from filing suit with respect to prison conditions\nunless all available administrative remedies have been\nexhausted. 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a). The parties agree that this\naction is subject to the PLRA’s exhaustion requirement.\nAlthough exhaustion is a precondition to the prisoners’ suit,\nfailure to exhaust is an affirmative defense that IDOC has\nthe burden of proving. See Dale v. Lappin, 376 F.3d 652, 656\n(7th Cir. 2004). IDOC claims that several of the prisoners\nfailed to exhaust their administrative remedies and are\nprecluded from bringing this suit.\n  Our consideration of this question requires that we\nascertain the administrative procedures by which a prisoner\nmay challenge his transfer to Tamms. Because the record\nand the initial briefing did not present a clear picture, we\nrequested that the parties file supplemental briefs address-\ning the administrative procedures available to a Tamms\nprisoner. Upon review of these submissions,we must\nconclude that IDOC has not carried its burden of establish-\ning that the prisoners failed to exhaust available administra-\ntive remedies.\n  IDOC submits that inmates have two avenues through\nwhich they must challenge their transfers to Tamms:\nthrough the transfer review hearing process and the inmate\ngrievance process. Illinois regulations establish two types of\ntransfer hearings at Tamms, depending on the inmate’s\nsegregation category upon arrival at the facility. Prisoners\nare classified as subject to either administrative or disciplin-\n\fNo. 03-3318                                                 13\n\nary segregation, and different review processes govern each\ncategory.\n   Inmates who are in administrative detention when they\narrive are afforded a transfer review hearing within ten\nworking days (“whenever possible”) of their transfer to\nTamms. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 20, § 505.60(a). This hearing\nincludes the opportunity for an inmate to appear, make\nstatements challenging his placement, submit documentary\nevidence and request that the transfer review committee\ninterview other persons. Id. § 505.60(b). The committee then\nmakes a recommendation to the Chief Administrative\nOfficer (“CAO,” i.e., the warden), who approves or denies\nthe recommendation before forwarding it to the Assistant\n                                    9\nDeputy Director. Id. § 505.60(d). Presumably, those plain-\ntiffs who were sent to Tamms in administrative detention\nstatus received this initial transfer review hearing, although,\nfor reasons discussed below, the record is silent in that\nrespect.\n  Inmates who are transferred to Tamms in disciplinary\nsegregation status are not afforded an initial transfer review\nhearing; regulations provide only that such individuals\nreceive a hearing after their term of disciplinary segregation\nends. Id. § 505.60(a). This provision must prove problematic\nfor some inmates. If a prisoner is sent to Tamms in a\ndisciplinary segregation status that does not expire for a\nvery long time, he will not have a hearing on his transfer to\nTamms until the expiration of that very long disciplinary\nsentence.\n\n\n9\n  IDOC notes that its policy has changed from that contained in\nthe regulations and that the recommendation goes from the CAO\nto the Deputy Director, who apparently approves a transfer if\nwarranted.\n\f14                                               No. 03-3318\n\n  Apart from the initial transfer review hearing, the review\ncommittee conducts a review of each prisoner’s file every\nninety days to determine whether placement at Tamms is\nstill appropriate. Id. § 505.70(a). The ninety-day review does\nnot afford the inmate an opportunity to be heard or to\npresent evidence. In addition, although IDOC represents\nthat the ninety-day review is conducted for every Tamms\ninmate, see Appellees’ Supplemental Br. at 4 n.4, the regula-\ntion indicates that such quarterly review only applies to\nthose in administrative detention, see Ill. Admin. Code tit.\n20, § 505.70(a) (noting that the committee “review[s] the\nrecord of each committed person in administrative deten-\ntion”).\n  For individuals in administrative detention, the transfer\nreview committee conducts an additional hearing every\nyear in which the inmate has the same opportunity to be\nheard and to present evidence challenging his transfer as in\nthe initial hearing, and is also entitled to notice of the\ncommittee’s finding. Id. § 505.70(b) (stating that the annual\nhearing is to be held in accordance with the standards of the\ninitial review). Again, the individuals in administrative\ndetention that have been at Tamms for more than a year\nhave presumably been afforded such annual reviews, while\nthose in disciplinary detention status presumably have not.\n  We say “presumably” with respect to the administrative\nreview hearings because it appears that IDOC has not\nprovided the prisoners with the hearing records, which they\nrequested early in this litigation. Nevertheless, without\nevidence to the contrary, we presume that Tamms officials\nfollow Illinois regulations, in which case every prisoner\ntransferred in administrative detention has been afforded a\n\fNo. 03-3318                                                     15\n                  10\nreview hearing. Prisoners who were transferred in, and\nremain in, disciplinary segregation have not yet qualified\nfor a review hearing, and this administrative remedy is\nunavailable to them. See Lewis v. Washington, 300 F.3d 829,\n833 (7th Cir. 2002).\n   IDOC’s position that the transfer review process affords\nan administrative remedy is unconvincing for another\nreason. Many of the prisoners contend that they were not\ntold the reasons for their transfer to Tamms; indeed, several\nprisoners filed grievances to complain about this problem.\nIDOC regulations do not require the department to notify\nprisoners why they have been transferred. We doubt\nwhether the transfer review process is effective for prisoners\nwho do not know the grounds for their transfer and who\nthus have no basis with which to contest their transfer. More\nimportantly, if a prisoner discovers the reasons for his\ntransfer shortly after completing the initial transfer review\nhearing and wishes to contest the transfer because, for\ninstance, the reasons are based on incorrect facts, he must\nwait at least one more year before he can present evidence\nat his annual review hearing. For all these reasons, with\nrespect to the transfer review process, IDOC has not carried\nits burden of establishing that the prisoners have not\nsatisfied PLRA exhaustion requirements.\n\n\n\n\n10\n  IDOC does not argue that the prisoners have failed to exhaust\nadministrative remedies because an annual status review is\navailable to those in administrative detention status. Nor do they\nargue that the ultimate availability of a transfer hearing to those\nin disciplinary segregation—available, that is, after their period\nof disciplinary segregation ends—means that such prisoners have\nalso failed to exhaust available remedies.\n\f16                                                No. 03-3318\n\n  IDOC also submits that the inmate grievance process is\nanother avenue for challenging transfer to Tamms. Al-\nthough we have considered, in previous cases, IDOC’s\ngrievance process in challenging general prison conditions,\nwe have not addressed whether the grievance process is an\nadministrative remedy by which a prisoner may challenge\nhis transfer to Tamms. In Illinois, “incidents, problems, or\ncomplaints” may be grieved, Ill. Admin. Code tit. 20,\n§ 504.810(a), but the grievance process cannot be “utilized\nfor complaints regarding decisions that are outside the\nauthority of the Department, such as parole decisions,\nclemency, or orders regarding length of sentence or deci-\nsions that have been rendered by the Director.” Id.\n  There seems to be significant confusion within IDOC,\npresumably caused by the “or decisions that have been\nrendered by the Director” clause of section 504.810(a), as to\nwhether a Tamms prisoner may grieve his transfer, IDOC\ndid not challenge every plaintiff on exhaustion grounds,\nand treatment of grievances by IDOC’s ultimate grievance\nappeal body, the Administrative Review Board (“ARB”),\nvaried among the prisoners. For instance, the ARB re-\nsponded to Mr. Combs’ grievance complaining about\nimproper placement at Tamms by offering reasons for the\ntransfer (e.g., gang activity). This action would seem to\nindicate that the ARB, at least, believed the grievance\nprocess to be the proper challenge avenue. In contrast,\nalthough he is no longer a party to this suit, the treatment of\nMr. Carroll’s grievance is instructive, especially given that\nIDOC did not challenge whether he exhausted his remedies.\nThe ARB simply replied to his complaint that transfer to\nTamms was not an issue that it could address, but rather\nwas an administrative prerogative of IDOC.\n\fNo. 03-3318                                                    17\n\n  In addition, there is some evidence that a Tamms coun-\nselor told Mr. Knox that he could not grieve placement at\nthe facility; this evidence the district court found sufficient\nto establish that Mr. Knox had exhausted all available\nadministrative remedies. However, Mr. V. Rodriguez, one\nof the prisoners whose claims the district court dismissed\nfor failure to exhaust, also submitted an affidavit setting\nforth a similar account. Prior to his transfer to Tamms, he\nreceived a disciplinary report at another facility, but he\ncompleted the appeal of that report after his transfer. Mr. V.\nRodriguez claims that IDOC officials led him to believe that\nhis administrative remedy lay in challenging his transfer to\nTamms, together with an existing administrative appeal that\n                                                       11\nhe was pursuing to challenge disciplinary action. In its\nsupplemental brief, IDOC does not respond to or explain\nthe inconsistent treatment.\n   Despite a number of Tamms-specific regulations in the\nIllinois Administrative Code, see id., pt. 505, IDOC does not\npoint to any regulation or department policy that clearly\nidentifies how a prisoner challenges his transfer to Tamms.\nIf, for example, the regulations specified that a prisoner\nmust challenge his transfer through the grievance process,\nor indicated the form that such a challenge should take, the\nprisoners would be obliged to conform to those administra-\n\n\n11\n  Mr. V. Rodriguez was transferred to Tamms while awaiting a\ndisciplinary action (assaulting a guard) through the IDOC\nadministrative system. He claims that the grievance officer at\nTamms told him that he could challenge his transfer together\nwith his administrative appeal of the disciplinary action. Mr. V.\nRodriguez never filed a separate grievance challenging his\ntransfer because he claims that he was led to believe that, by\nappealing his transfer at the same time he appealed the disciplin-\nary action, he exhausted his administrative remedies.\n\f18                                                    No. 03-3318\n\ntive requirements. If the ARB took consistent positions on its\nauthority to address a transfer grievance, a clear route for\nthe prisoner at least would be evident and we could proceed\nto determine its effectiveness. But, as this case comes to us,\nwe find the record “hopelessly unclear . . . whether any\nadministrative remedy” remained open for the prisoners to\nchallenge their transfers through the grievance process.\nWalker v. Thompson, 288 F.3d 1005, 1009 (7th Cir. 2002). With\nregard to Mr. Felton, Mr. Horton, Mr. V. Rodriquez and Mr.\n           12\nSantiago, IDOC failed to meet its burden of proving that\nthey failed to exhaust an available administrative remedy,\nDale, 376 F.3d at 656, even after we afforded the opportunity\nto clarify the record through supplemental briefing.\n   Although we base our decision on IDOC’s failure to meet\nits burden on the exhaustion issue, we pause to note as well\nthat the district court erred in finding Mr. Felton’s and Mr.\nHorton’s grievances insufficient to “alert[ ] the prison to the\nnature of the wrong for which redress is sought,” which is\nall that the PLRA requires. Strong v. David, 297 F.3d 646, 650\n(7th Cir. 2002). Although their purported placement chal-\nlenges were made within substantive complaints about\nTamms conditions, each prisoners’ grievance expressed\nconcern about not being told the reason for his transfer to\nTamms or listed something to the effect of “Transfer from\nTamms” as the requested remedy. These complaints were\n\n\n12\n  The district court dismissed Mr. Santiago because he submitted\nthe grievance that he claimed exhausted his administrative\nremedies after this suit was filed. The appellants here do not\nchallenge his dismissal. But, because it is unclear whether the\ngrievance process may be used to challenge a prisoner’s transfer\nto Tamms, Mr. Santiago’s failure timely to file a grievance is of no\nmoment, and we conclude that the district court erred in dismiss-\ning him on that ground.\n\fNo. 03-3318                                                     19\n\nsufficient to alert prison officials that Mr. Felton and Mr.\nHorton challenged their transfers, even though the griev-\nance officers in each case addressed the prison condition\ncomplaints without mentioning their transfers to Tamms.\n  We therefore reverse the district court’s dismissal of the\nclaims of Mr. Felton, Mr. Horton, Mr. V. Rodriguez and Mr.\nSantiago.\n\n\n     2. Discovery\n   The litigation plaintiffs believe that they were sent to\nTamms in retaliation for filing legal actions against IDOC\n                  13\nand its officials. Proving this theory required the prisoners\nto reconstruct the decision-making process leading to their\ntransfers. To accomplish this task, the prisoners requested\na number of documents from IDOC. Included in the re-\nquested documents were: placement forms for each pris-\noner; the results of any administrative reviews conducted\nsince their arrival at Tamms; each prisoner’s ARB file; the\nlitigation files of each litigation plaintiff; documents listing\nprisoners considered eligible for placement in Tamms who\n\n\n\n13\n  Because the district court rejected the associational rights and\nthe ex post facto counts of the gang plaintiffs, the remaining\ndiscovery disputes primarily involved the litigation plaintiffs.\nIndeed, given that the First Amendment and ex post facto\ncomplaints were dismissed early on, the district court and\nmagistrate judge determined, correctly, that many of the prison-\ners’ discovery requests had become irrelevant. Because the\ndistrict court correctly dismissed these counts, we need not\naddress the district court’s handling of the prisoners’ discovery\nrequests aimed solely at proving the gang plaintiffs’ associational\nrights and ex post facto violations.\n\f20                                                     No. 03-3318\n                         14\nwere not transferred; and any documents discussing the\ntransfer of the named plaintiffs, rather than other prisoners,\nto Tamms.\n  Before considering the specific discovery disputes at issue\nin this appeal, it is useful to recount certain aspects of the\ndiscovery history in this case. The record reveals that both\nIDOC and the prisoners were slow in discovery. The\nprisoners delayed answering IDOC’s interrogatories and, at\n                                                         15\none point, earned a warning about possible sanctions.\n\n14\n   The prisoners sought records of non-Tamms inmates to\ndemonstrate, among other things, that IDOC transferred the\nlitigation plaintiffs but did not transfer prisoners who presented\nmore severe disciplinary or gang-related problems. They argued\nthat, together with their litigation files, these records would raise\nan inference that the litigation plaintiffs were transferred solely\non the basis of their litigation activities.\n15\n  In a similar vein, later in the proceedings, the prisoners’\nidentical form responses to IDOC’s interrogatories were to\nbecome a matter of controversy. Every IDOC defendant except\nMr. Snyder served three interrogatories on each remaining\nplaintiff. Mr. Snyder served four interrogatories; numbers 2\nthrough 4 were the same as other officials’ three interrogatories.\nThe relevant interrogatory, numbered 1 generally but Mr.\nSnyder’s number 2, read: “State the factual basis for your\nassertion that Defendant [official’s last name] approved your\ntransfer to Tamms Super Max Correctional Center in retaliation\nfor litigation, grievances or ‘writ writing.’ ” See, e.g., R.69, Ex.3.\n  The prisoner responses were apparently drafted using Mr.\nSnyder’s interrogatories as a model, and repeated for every\nprisoner in response to each IDOC official. Each prisoner gave the\nsame response to the second interrogatory, that is, Mr. Snyder’s\nsecond, even though, for the other officials, the response should\nhave been to the first question. Regardless of which IDOC official\n                                                     (continued...)\n\fNo. 03-3318                                                     21\n\n  The circumstances surrounding the State’s production of\nthe placement forms, crucial to the prisoners’ claim, must be\n                          16\nexamined in some detail. IDOC eventually produced the\nforms and attached them to its renewed motion for sum-\nmary judgment, together with affidavits from IDOC officers\nstating that they had relied on the placement forms when\ndeciding the appropriateness of a prisoner’s transfer to\nTamms. The State argued that the officials’ reliance on\n\n\n15\n  (...continued)\nthe prisoner addressed, the prisoner stated:\n     I do not have any personal knowledge that defendant Snyder\n     personally approved my transfer to Tamms. Rather, I\n     contend that defendant Snyder approved policies and\n     procedures which permitted prisoners to be transferred to\n     Tamms in retaliation for activities which were protected by\n     the First Amendment.\nSee, e.g., R.69, Ex.29. The plaintiffs claimed that, “[r]ather than\nprovide duplicative answers to the same questions asked\nseparately by each of the defendants, plaintiffs sought to simplify\ntheir responses by combining all defendants’ interrogatories.”\nR.104 at 5.\n16\n  On October 28, 2002, at the same time the district court granted\nIDOC leave to renew its summary judgment motion, it ordered\nIDOC to produce documents relied on by the officials in deciding\nwhich prisoners to transfer to Tamms. The prisoners had asked\nfor the documents with their initial discovery request in August\n2000. A month later, IDOC produced approximately 7500 pages\nof documents in compliance. Based on the volume of material,\nthe district court granted additional time, until January 29, 2003,\nfor the prisoners to reply to IDOC’s summary judgment motion.\nThe district court subsequently granted a motion to file instanter,\nand the prisoners filed their response on February 10, 2003—the\nsame day the court held a hearing on the summary judgment\nmotion.\n\f22                                                No. 03-3318\n\nprisoner placement forms belied the prisoners’ claim that\nIDOC transferred them in retaliation for any protected\nactivity.\n  The prisoners then sought to introduce affidavits alleging\nthat the information contained in the placement forms was\nuntrue. They contended that IDOC officials had falsified\ntheir gang associations or disciplinary histories to justify\ntheir transfers to Tamms. IDOC moved to strike this evi-\ndence and all other evidence that the placement forms were\nincorrect, that the prisoners’ disciplinary histories were\ninsufficient to warrant assignment to Tamms, that the\ntiming of their transfers was suspicious, and that Mr.\nSnyder could be held liable for the transfers.\n  In resisting the efforts of the prisoners to have the court\nconsider the prisoners’ evidence that the transfer documents\nwere false, IDOC crafted its motion as a request for discov-\nery sanctions. It argued that the prisoners had failed to\namend their previous interrogatory answers (that is, their\n                     17\nanswer number 2) to encompass the new falsification\ntheories, in violation of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n26(e)(2).\n  The district court granted IDOC’s motion to strike on\nessentially two related grounds. First, the court considered\nthe prisoners’ answers to IDOC interrogatories to be\n“incomplete” under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(a)(3)\nbecause they failed to present any supporting facts in spite\nof the interrogatories’ request for “the factual basis for your\nassertion that Defendant . . . approved your transfer to\nTamms.” R.69, Ex.3. Second, the district court agreed with\nIDOC that the prisoners’ contention—that information in\n\n\n17\n     See supra note 15.\n\fNo. 03-3318                                                      23\n\ntheir placement forms had been falsified—was a new theory\nbased on new evidence. Because the prisoners failed to\namend their responses to the IDOC interrogatories to reflect\ntheir new allegation and provide more complete factual\nbases for their claims, as required by Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 26(e)(2), the district court excluded from consid-\neration the prisoners’ affidavits (or any other evidence that\nthey might have produced) contending that their placement\n                                                             18\nforms had been falsified, as a sanction under Rule 37(c)(1).\n                                                           19\n  The prisoners’ argument in this appeal is twofold. First,\nthey submit that the district court erred in concluding that\nthey had violated Rule 26(e)(2) by not supplementing their\ninterrogatory responses. Because IDOC had not produced\nthe placement forms or other requested discovery when\nthey answered the interrogatories, the prisoners note that\nthey could not have known the falsehoods contained in the\nforms—falsehoods which formed the “factual basis” for\ntheir claim. The prisoners argue that they complied with the\nrequirements of Rule 26 by offering affidavits, and they\ncharacterize any requirement to go back and supplement\ntheir interrogatory answers as a “duplicative, meaningless\n\n\n18\n  In addition, the district court noted that the prisoners’ form\nresponses to IDOC interrogatories mentioned only Mr. Snyder.\nSee supra note 15. Because their responses were inadequate and\nonly applied to Mr. Snyder, the district court determined that he\nwas not liable as a matter of law and dismissed him from the suit.\nGiven our decision concerning the propriety of the discovery\nsanction, it was inappropriate for the district court to dismiss Mr.\nSnyder at this stage of the litigation.\n19\n   IDOC argues that the prisoners have waived any challenge to\ndistrict court discovery decisions because their brief does not\ncomply with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28(a)(9)(A). We\nfind the prisoners’ submission to be sufficient.\n\f24                                                No. 03-3318\n\nformality.” Appellants’ Br. at 44. Second, the prisoners\nassert that, even if they violated the letter of Rule 26, the\ndistrict court abused its discretion by imposing its Rule 37\nsanction.\n  Although we review the district court’s discovery rulings\nfor abuse of discretion, “[t]he district court must apply the\ncorrect legal standards and not reach an erroneous conclu-\nsion of law in forming the basis for the sanction of exclu-\nsion.” Musser v. Gentiva Health Servs., 356 F.3d 751, 755 (7th\nCir. 2004). Reaching an erroneous legal conclusion consti-\ntutes an abuse of discretion. Id. We therefore first consider\nthe district court’s determination that the prisoners violated\nRule 26 by failing to amend their interrogatories.\n  At the outset, we cannot accept the argument that, as a\ngeneral proposition, the requirements of Rule 26 constitute\na meaningless formality. Although the prisoners may\ndisagree about its application to their case, “the formal\nrequirements of Rule 26 are not pointless.” Hoffman v.\nCaterpillar, Inc., 368 F.3d 709, 714 (7th Cir. 2004). Litigants\nwould be well advised to conform their conduct in litigation\nto the Rules.\n     Under Rule 26,\n     [a] party who has made a disclosure under subdivision\n     (a) or responded to a request for discovery with a\n     disclosure or response is under a duty to supplement or\n     correct the disclosure or response to include information\n     thereafter acquired if ordered by the court or in the\n     following circumstances:\n\n\n           ....\n             (2) A party is under a duty seasonably to amend\n\fNo. 03-3318                                                      25\n\n           a prior response to an interrogatory, request for\n           production, or request for admission if the party\n           learns that the response is in some material re-\n           spect incomplete or incorrect and if the additional\n           or corrective information has not otherwise been\n           made known to the other parties during the\n           discovery process or in writing.\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 26(e).\n  The prisoners submit that they complied with Rule 26\nbecause they produced affidavits with their response to\nIDOC’s summary judgment motion that stated clearly their\nallegation that the transfer forms state false reasons for the\nprisoners’ transfers. They contend that the affidavits\n“otherwise . . . made known . . . in writing” to IDOC that the\nprisoners contested the truthfulness of their placement\nforms and therefore complied with Rule 26. Accordingly,\nthey submit, they are excused from actually amending their\n                 20\ninterrogatories.\n\n\n20\n  It appears from the record that the prisoners argued for the first\ntime in this appeal that by submitting their affidavits they\ncomplied with Rule 26’s “otherwise . . . made known” clause.\nThis is not the argument that they made before the district court.\nRather, in opposing the State’s motion to strike their evidence, the\nprisoners asserted several points. First, they contended that the\naffidavits were consistent with their interrogatory answers.\nSecond, the prisoners noted that they informed the IDOC officials\nthat they would supplement their interrogatory answers if the\nofficials specified what information was missing—a specification\nthat the prisoners never received. Third, they argued that any\nfailure to amend their interrogatories should be excused because\nthey were swamped with discovery only two months before the\n                                                      (continued...)\n\f26                                                      No. 03-3318\n\n   The prisoners’ argument has merit. The present situation\nis governed by the “otherwise” clause in Rule 26(e)(2). See\nGutierrez v. AT&T Broadband, LLC, 382 F.3d 725, 733 (7th Cir.\n2004). Although the prisoners did not amend their interrog-\natory answers, their response to IDOC’s summary judgment\nmotion placed the officials on written notice that the\nprisoners challenged the placement forms’ veracity. There\nwas no unfair surprise in the prisoners’ failure to amend\ntheir interrogatories, especially given IDOC’s delay in\nproducing the relevant documents. The prisoners’ submis-\nsions complied with Rule 26.\n  Because the district court declined to consider the prison-\ners’ contention that information in their placement forms\nwas false, it assumed the forms to be true when analyzing\nIDOC’s rationale for transferring the plaintiffs. The prison-\ners were left only with chronologies indicating that their\ntransfers were suspicious; the district court found these\nchronologies to be inadequate to allow the prisoners to\nsurvive summary judgment. We cannot say whether the\n\n\n20\n  (...continued)\nmotion was heard and more than two years after they first\nrequested the documents.\n   We ordinarily refuse to consider arguments not made before\nthe district court. However, we also hold fast to the principle that\na defense of waiver may itself be waived if not raised. See Riemer\nv. Illinois Dep’t of Transp., 148 F.3d 800, 804 n.4 (7th Cir. 1998). In\ntheir submission to this court, IDOC’s waiver argument on this\nissue is focused solely on the adequacy of the prisoners’ brief; the\nofficials do not argue that the appellants have waived their\ncontention that submitting affidavits complied with their Rule 26\nobligations. We therefore find that IDOC waived any waiver\nargument on this issue, and we will consider the prisoners’\nsubmission.\n\fNo. 03-3318                                                       27\n\ndistrict court would have reached the same conclusion had\nit considered, in addition to the chronologies, evidence that\nIDOC relied on false placement forms in transferring the\nprisoners, or other evidence establishing that the prisoners\nwere transferred in retaliation for their litigation activities.\nThe district court should have considered the prisoners’\nallegations and summary judgment based on its refusal to\n                          21\ndo so was inappropriate.\n\n\n21\n   Even if the prisoners had failed to comply with Rule 26 by not\namending their interrogatory responses, we do not believe that\nthe district court should have excluded the prisoners’ evidence as\na sanction.\n   Rule 37 provides that a party who fails to amend an interroga-\ntory response under Rule 26(e)(2) “is not, unless such failure is\nharmless, permitted to use as evidence . . . information not so\ndisclosed.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1) (emphasis added). Notably,\ncontrary to what the prisoners seem to argue here, there is no\nsliding scale of sanctions under Rule 37. In the Rule 26(a) context,\nwe have noted that “the sanction of exclusion is automatic and\nmandatory unless the sanctioned party can show that its violation\nof Rule 26(a) was either justified or harmless.” Salgado v. Gen.\nMotors Corp., 150 F.3d 735, 742 (7th Cir. 1998). Similarly, here once\nthe district court found a Rule 26 violation, it was obligated to\nexclude the offered evidence unless the prisoners’ failure to\namend was harmless or justified. See Williams v. Morton, 343 F.3d\n212, 222 (3d Cir. 2003).\n  The determination of whether a failure is harmless or justified\nis left to the broad discretion of the district court. David v.\nCaterpillar, Inc., 324 F.3d 851, 857 (7th Cir. 2003). The trial court\nneed not make explicit findings regarding a justification or the\nharmlessness of the Rule 26 violation, id., but\n\n     we have indicated that the following factors should guide the\n                                                     (continued...)\n\f28                                                        No. 03-3318\n\n\n\n21\n     (...continued)\n        district court’s discretion: (1) the prejudice or surprise to the\n        party against whom the evidence is offered; (2) the ability of\n        the party to cure the prejudice; (3) the likelihood of disrup-\n        tion to the trial; and (4) the bad faith or willfulness involved\n        in not disclosing the evidence at an earlier date.\nId. (citing, among others, Bronk v. Ineichen, 54 F.3d 425, 428 (7th\nCir. 1995)).\n  In this case, the prisoners argued in their response to IDOC’s\nmotion to strike that any violation of Rule 26 on their part was\nharmless. The district court responded to this argument with a\nsingle sentence: “The Court finds that Plaintiffs have not submit-\nted sufficient justification for their failure to amend their interrog-\natory responses and that this failure is not harmless.” R.106 at 6.\nThe district court’s one-sentence discussion of the issue before\nimposing a Rule 37 sanction did not constitute the “thoughtful\ndiscussion” that would assure us that the court considered the\nDavid factors. David, 324 F.3d at 858. Indeed, our review of the\nhistory of this case indicates that application of the David factors\nleads to a conclusion that any Rule 26 violation was harmless.\n  There is no evidence that the prisoners’ failure to amend their\ninterrogatory responses was the result of willfulness or bad faith;\nindeed, it seems clear that IDOC resisted producing discovery,\ndelayed in submitting the placement forms and, in the end,\ndeluged the prisoners with document production shortly before\nthe district court resolved its summary judgment motion.\n  Nor can we say that the prisoners’ failure to amend their\ninterrogatory responses prejudiced or surprised IDOC because\nthe prisoners offered their falsification theory shortly after\ndiscovering it through IDOC’s late discovery. Indeed, if there was\nprejudice in this case it was to the plaintiffs, based on IDOC’s\ndelayed production. Cf. Rosario v. Livaditis, 963 F.2d 1013, 1019\n(7th Cir. 1992) (“A party who fails to pursue discovery in the face\n                                                     (continued...)\n\fNo. 03-3318                                                    29\n\nC. All Prisoners’ Due Process Claim\n  Both groups of prisoners, the litigation plaintiffs and the\ngang plaintiffs, submit that the district court improperly\ndismissed their due process claims. These claims alleged\nthat the transfer to Tamms constituted punishment and\ntherefore required that the prisoners receive notice and a\nhearing. The district court read our decision in Wagner v.\nHanks, 128 F.3d 1173 (7th Cir. 1997), to imply that the\nprisoners would have a liberty interest only if the conditions\nat Tamms were significantly more restrictive than adminis-\ntrative detention at the most secure prison in the state. In\nthis case, that prison is the one where the prisoners are\nincarcerated, Tamms. Under the district court’s reading of\nWagner, no prisoner in administrative detention at Tamms\ncould make out a due process claim. Additionally, held the\ncourt, because the prisoners offered no evidence showing\nthat disciplinary segregation at Tamms was significantly\nmore restrictive than administrative detention at the facility\n(indeed, the evidence seems to suggest that the conditions\nare equally harsh), prisoners in disciplinary segregation\nstatus likewise failed to demonstrate a liberty interest.\n  Our colleague in the district court had to deal with these\ncontentions without the benefit of the Supreme Court’s\ndecision in Wilkinson v. Austin, 125 S. Ct. 2384 (2005).\n\n\n21\n  (...continued)\nof a court ordered cut-off cannot plead prejudice from his own\ninaction.”). Moreover, any prejudice that IDOC did suffer easily\ncould have been cured by granting IDOC additional time in\nwhich to respond to the new allegations. Therefore, even if the\nprisoners had violated Rule 26 by failing to amend their interrog-\natory responses, the district court abused its discretion in\nexcluding evidence supporting their falsification theory.\n\f30                                                No. 03-3318\n\nWilkinson gives substantial guidance on the appropriate\nresolution of the issues in the present case. Consequently,\nafter its rendition by the Supreme Court, the parties to this\ncase submitted their views on how the Court’s rationale\nought to affect our decision in this case.\n   Wilkinson upheld, against a due process challenge, Ohio’s\nprocedure for transferring prisoners to the Ohio State\nPenitentiary (“OSP”), that state’s “supermax” prison, a\nfacility designed to hold the most dangerous prisoners who\nposed a special threat if incarcerated in the general prison\npopulation. At OSP, almost every aspect of the inmate’s life\nwas controlled and monitored. Extreme isolation was\nimposed; opportunities for visitation were sharply curtailed\nand always conducted through glass walls. The inmates\nwere deprived of almost every form of environmental or\nsensory stimuli. There was very little human contact. A\nprisoner could be placed in the supermax for an indefinite\nperiod of time; only the length of the prisoner’s sentence\nmarked the outer limits of his stay. If an inmate was other-\nwise eligible for parole, he lost that eligibility while as-\nsigned to the facility.\n  Under the policy finally adopted by Ohio to govern the\nselection of prisoners for placement in the supermax facility,\na prison official conducted, prior to placement, a classifica-\ntion review. This review focused on the offense of convic-\ntion in the case of prisoners just committed to the prison\nsystem and on certain types of conduct in the case of those\nalready incarcerated. The prisoner was notified of the\nfactual basis for a recommendation for placement in the\nsupermax and given a fair opportunity for rebuttal at a\nhearing. He could not, however, call witnesses. Addition-\nally, prior to the final level of review, the prisoner was given\nan opportunity to submit objections to the recommendation.\nThere were three levels of review. At each level, a decision\n\fNo. 03-3318                                                  31\n\nagainst placement in the supermax facility terminated the\nprocess and the prisoner was not assigned to the supermax.\nAfter placement in the supermax prison, a prisoner received\na review after thirty days and an annual review thereafter.\n  The Supreme Court held that prisoners had a constitution-\nally protected liberty interest in avoiding assignment to\nOSP. Reiterating the conclusion it reached in Meachum v.\nFano, 427 U.S. 215, 225 (1976), the Court noted “that the\nConstitution itself does not give rise to a liberty interest in\navoiding transfer to more adverse conditions of confine-\nment.” Wilkinson, 125 S. Ct. at 2393. However, continued the\nCourt, “a liberty interest in avoiding particular conditions\nof confinement may arise from state policies or regulations,\nsubject to the important limitations set forth in Sandin v.\nConnor, 515 U.S. 472 (1995).” Id. The Court went on to\nemphasize that Sandin pointedly had rejected the methodol-\nogy of parsing the language of particular regulations.\nRather, “the touchstone of the inquiry into the existence of\na protected, state-created liberty interest . . . is not the\nlanguage of regulations regarding those conditions but the\nnature of those conditions themselves ‘in relation to the\nordinary incidents of prison life.’ ” Id. at 2394 (quoting\nSandin, 515 U.S. at 484).\n  The Supreme Court then went on to apply the methodol-\nogy of Sandin to the situation before it. It noted the inconsis-\ntent results that courts of appeals have reached in applying\nthe Sandin formula because it is difficult to determine a\nbaseline from which to ascertain whether the conditions of\nconfinement are an atypical and significant hardship.\nNoting the absence of briefing on the subject in the case\nbefore it, the Court nevertheless concluded that it was\nunnecessary to explore the issue because the conditions at\nOSP posed an “atypical and significant hardship under any\n\f32                                                No. 03-3318\n\nplausible baseline.” Id. It described those conditions in these\nterms:\n     For an inmate placed in OSP, almost all human contact\n     is prohibited, even to the point that conversation is not\n     permitted from cell to cell; the light, though it may be\n     dimmed, is on for 24 hours; exercise is for 1 hour per\n     day, but only in a small indoor room. Save perhaps for\n     the especially severe limitations on all human contact,\n     these conditions likely would apply to most solitary\n     confinement facilities, but here there are two added\n     components. First is the duration. Unlike the 30-day\n     placement in Sandin, placement at OSP is indefinite and,\n     after an initial 30-day review, is reviewed just annually.\n     Second is that placement disqualifies an otherwise\n     eligible inmate for parole consideration. While any of\n     these conditions standing alone might not be sufficient\n     to create a liberty interest, taken together they impose\n     an atypical and significant hardship within the correc-\n     tional context. It follows that respondents have a liberty\n     interest in avoiding assignment to OSP.\nWilkinson, 125 S. Ct. at 2394-95 (citations omitted).\n  Having determined that the conditions at the Ohio\nsupermax facility imposed an atypical and significant\nhardship within the correctional context and thus consti-\ntuted the deprivation of a liberty interest, the Supreme\nCourt turned to the question of what process was required\nbefore such conditions were imposed on a prisoner. Re-\nminding the reader that the Court previously has avoided\nthe use of rigid rules, see Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471,\n481 (1972), in favor of flexibility tailored to the particular\nsituation, the Court articulated the familiar framework of\nMathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976), that requires a court\nto consider the following three factors:\n\fNo. 03-3318                                                 33\n\n    First, the private interest that will be affected by the\n    official action; second, the risk of an erroneous depriva-\n    tion of such interest through the procedures used, and\n    the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute\n    procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government’s\n    interest, including the function involved and the fiscal\n    and administrative burdens that the additional or\n    substitute procedural requirement would entail.\nId. at 335.\n   With respect to the first factor, the Court noted that the\nprivate interest of the prisoner to be free from confinement,\nwhile “more than minimal,” had to be evaluated in the\ncontext of the prison system where, pursuant to a lawful\nsentence, confinement already has curtailed liberty to a\ngreat degree. Wilkinson, 125 S. Ct. at 2395. The private\nliberty interest, then, is clearly not as plenary as that of an\nindividual not under the sentence of a court. With respect to\nthe second factor, the Court focused on Ohio’s provision for\nnotice and opportunity to rebut the reasons offered by the\nState for placement in OSP. Id. at 2396. The Court noted that,\nin addition to notice and hearing, the prisoner was given an\nopportunity to submit a rebuttal to an affirmative recom-\nmendation at the last of three levels of review. Moreover, a\nrecommendation against placement at any level ended the\nprocess and the prisoner was not placed at the supermax. If\na reviewer did recommend placement in the supermax, the\nprisoner received a statement of reasons for use before the\nnext decision-maker or in a subsequent classification\nreview. The statement also served, noted the Court, as a\nguide for the prisoner with respect to his future behavior.\nFinally, noted the Court, the Ohio regulations provided for\na review after the prisoner had been at the supermax facility\nfor thirty days. In the Court’s view, this regulatory scheme\nadequately ensured against an erroneous decision in the\n\f34                                                 No. 03-3318\n\nplacement process.\n  The Court minced no words in applying the third Mathews\nfactor, the interest of the public officials charged with the\nresponsibility of running prisons. See id. at 2396-97. The\nState’s first responsibility, the Court wrote, is to ensure the\nsafety of guards, prison personnel, the public and the\nprisoners themselves. The Court also noted the pressing\nneed of the State to manage prudently its assets in a context\nof scarce resources. Therefore, concluded the Justices, courts\nmust approach estimations such as the one required by the\nthird prong of the Mathews test with substantial deference\nto prison management decisions. Id. at 2397.\n  After balancing the Mathews factors, the Court concluded\nthat Ohio’s policies adequately safeguarded against an\nerroneous decision. The Court pointed out that the inquiry\nhere is not an inquiry into a specific incident, but an assess-\nment of a prisoner’s entire record and a prognostication\nabout future behavior. Such a decision does not turn simply\non whether the prisoner committed a specific act. Rather, it\nturns on an assessment that requires the experience of\nprison administrators—an assessment that is more suscepti-\nble to resolution in an informal procedure.\n  We turn now to an examination of how the Supreme\nCourt’s recent guidance in Wilkinson governs the case before\nus. As we noted earlier, we have the assistance of counsel\nfor both parties through the thoughtful supplemental briefs\nthey have filed recently.\n  The State of Illinois, representing its defendant officials,\ntakes the position that, under Wilkinson, the prisoners\ncannot claim a cognizable liberty interest. First, it notes that\nthere are some differences between Tamms and OSP with\nrespect to the conditions of confinement. The cells in\nTamms, it points out, have windows; the doors are mesh\n\fNo. 03-3318                                                  35\n\nrather than solid steel; the exercise yard is partially out-\ndoors. It also points out that, although the prisoners allege\nthat visitation at Tamms is cumbersome and expensive,\nespecially for individuals from the Chicago area, they do\nnot allege, as the Ohio prisoners did, that the opportunities\nfor visitation are rare. More important, continues the State,\nassignment to Tamms does not affect the length of confine-\nment because nothing in the regulations says that placement\nat Tamms directly affects parole eligibility, mandatory\nsupervised release, good conduct credits or good time\nrestoration. In the State’s view, this latter point is crucial\nbecause it reads both Wilkinson and Sandin as grounding a\nrecognition of liberty interest on the effect of the state-\nimposed restraint on the length of the prisoner’s sentence.\n   In the alternative, the State claims that, even if there is a\nliberty interest implicated in a placement at Tamms, the pre-\nand post-transfer procedures for such assignments satisfy\nthe needs of due process. It begins its argument by empha-\nsizing that Wilkinson requires only an informal,\nnonadversarial process. It also points out that the Supreme\nCourt did not say that the detailed procedures employed by\nOhio were to be considered a constitutional floor.\n  The prisoners take a different view of the applicability of\nWilkinson. They emphasize the procedural posture of this\naspect of the present case. Because the district court dis-\nmissed the due process claim of the complaint on the\npleadings, we are obliged to read all the allegations of that\ncomplaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs. They\nfurther submit that the complaint contains statements that\nclearly allege that the conditions at Tamms fit the profile for\n“atypical and significant hardship” as that phrase is em-\nployed in Sandin and in Wilkinson. They specifically note the\nfollowing:\n    Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint alleged:\n\f36                                                No. 03-3318\n\n        9. Tamms is designed to be extremely harsh. IDOC\n        officials have stated that they want conditions at\n        Tamms to be so bad that inmates throughout the\n        system are motivated to follow all departmental\n        rules based upon the mere threat of being trans-\n        ferred to Tamms.\n        10. The conditions of confinement at Tamms present\n        inmates with atypical and significant hardships in\n        relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life,\n        including the hardships imposed at the most restric-\n        tive segregation units in Illinois’ maximum security\n        prisons. At Tamms, control and punishment are\n        imposed through extreme social isolation, severely\n        restricted movement, and an environment that\n        virtually eliminates all external stimuli.\nPlaintiffs’ amended complaint describes the extraordinarily\nrestrictive conditions imposed on prisoners at Tamms in\ngreat detail (¶’s 11-24). The restrictions include (among\nothers) virtually complete absence of human contact (¶’s 11,\n15, and 18), virtual elimination of all out of cell movements\n(¶’s 12, 14, 18), severe restrictions on showers and out of cell\nexercise (¶’s 16 and 19), severe restrictions on family visits\n(¶ 20), elimination of all jobs and other programming (¶ 14),\nsevere restrictions on religious services (¶ 21) and on a\nprisoner’s communication with attorneys (¶ 22). Property is\nsimilarly restricted (¶ 14). In sum, being confined to Tamms\nis to be subjected to virtual sensory deprivation, with\nprisoners forced to spend most days doing literally nothing\nbut staring at the four blank walls of their cells.\n     In Count Three of their amended complaint, plaintiffs\n     allege (¶ 120):\n        120. Transfer to Tamms subjects plaintiffs to atypi-\n        cal and significant hardships in relation to the\n\fNo. 03-3318                                                     37\n\n        ordinary incidents of prison life and to hardships\n        which are not experienced at the most restrictive\n        segregation unit at any of the maximum security\n        prisons in Illinois.\nAppellants’ Supplemental Br. at 3-4.\n  With respect to the other factors mentioned in Wikinson,\nthe prisoners note that, although prisoners at Tamms are\neligible for parole, there are strict limits on the good time\nthat they can earn because of the lack of rehabilitative\nprograms at the facility. With respect to the length of time\nthat a prisoner can be incarcerated at Tamms, the prisoners\nsimply point out that the only time limit is the length of the\nunderlying sentence.\n  With respect to the available procedures for contesting a\nplacement in Tamms, the prisoners point out the absence of\nany hearing for those in disciplinary status and the lack of\nnotice as to the reasons for the placement in the case of\nthose in administrative detention. They also note the lack of\nany pre-placement hearing for those in administrative\ndetention.\n  We believe that the allegations of the complaint, which we\nmust accept as true at this stage of the litigation, preclude\ndismissal under the now-governing standards of Wilkinson.\nThere are some differences between the features of the Ohio\nsupermax at issue in Wilkinson and those of the Illinois\nfacility at issue here. It is not at all clear, however, that those\ndifferences are so qualitatively different as to require a\ndifferent characterization of the facility for purposes of due\nprocess analysis under Wilkinson. Illinois’ contention that\nthe liberty interest identified in Wilkinson turned exclusively\non the absence of parole constitutes, our view, far too\ncrabbed a reading of the decision. The very text of the\ndecision belies such a claim in noting that, “[w]hile any of\n\f38                                                 No. 03-3318\n\nthese conditions standing alone might not be sufficient to\ncreate a liberty interest, taken together they impose an\natypical and significant hardship within the correctional\ncontext.” Wilkinson, 125 S. Ct. at 2395. We also note that, if,\nafter considering all the evidence submitted by the parties,\nthe district court is not of the view that the Illinois situation\nis, like the Ohio facility, “an atypical and significant hard-\nship under any plausible baseline,” id. at 2394, the district\ncourt must confront the issue of what does constitute the\nappropriate baseline for the Illinois system. See id.\n  Assuming that a liberty interest is determined to exist, the\ndistrict court will then have to confront whether the proce-\ndures that we have discussed at some length with respect to\nthe exhaustion of administrative remedies provide sufficient\nprocess to protect the prisoners’ liberty interest in this case.\nThe fact that the procedures available in Illinois are different\nfrom those employed in Ohio is, of course, in no way\noutcome determinative. The Supreme Court has made clear\nthat application of the Mathews test requires flexibility with\nrespect to the precise procedural devices employed. The\nCourt has made clear that the informal, nonadversarial\nprocedures set forth in Hewitt v. Helms, 459 U.S. 460 (1983)\nand Greenholtz v. Inmates of Nebraska Penal & Correctional\nComplex, 442 U.S. 1 (1979), are the appropriate models. See\nWilkinson, 125 S. Ct. at 2397.\n  On the basis of what we can ascertain on this record, it\nappears that the district court will have to evaluate with\nparticular care whether the prisoner is given sufficient\nnotice of the reasons for his transfer to afford meaningful\nopportunity to challenge his placement. With respect to\nprisoners in disciplinary status, there is the added question\nof whether the disciplinary hearing on the underlying\ndisciplinary violation is a sufficient vehicle by which to\nchallenge the Tamms placement. For those in administrative\n\fNo. 03-3318                                                  39\n\nstatus, the lack of any pre-transfer hearing may require close\nexamination. See Hewitt, 459 U.S. at 477. The district court\nalso must, of course, consider the matter of continued\nmonitoring of the situation after the initial transfer decision.\nSee id. at 477 n.9.\n  Finally, with respect to the viability of the grievance\nprocedure to contest a placement at Tamms, the district\ncourt must explore fully the allegation that IDOC’s conflict-\ning pronouncements on the use of this procedure to chal-\nlenge placement renders it useless.\n\n                         Conclusion\n  For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the\njudgment of the district court with respect to all claims but\nthe retaliation claim and the due process claim. With respect\nto these claims, the judgment of the district court is reversed\nand the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with\nthis opinion. The parties shall bear their own costs on this\nappeal.\n        AFFIRMED in part; REVERSED and REMANDED in part\n\nA true Copy:\n        Teste:\n\n                           _____________________________\n                            Clerk of the United States Court of\n                              Appeals for the Seventh Circuit\n\n\n\n\n                     USCA-02-C-0072—9-6-05\n\f",

IDOC\ndesigned the conditions there to be harsh, so that the threat\nof being transferred to Tamms would deter prisoners\nthroughout the system from disobeying prison rules.\nAccording to IDOC, all Tamms prisoners are exposed to\nhardships that are not experienced in segregated confine-\n\fNo. 03-3318                                                        3\n                                                                    1\nment at any other maximum security facility in Illinois.\nIDOC transferred the plaintiffs to Tamms within a year after\nit opened.\n                  2\n  The plaintiffs are organized into two categories, labeled\ngenerally the “litigation plaintiffs” and the “gang plaintiffs.”\nThe gang plaintiffs, some of whom are also litigation\nplaintiffs, are associated with prison gangs (in IDOC\nterminology, “Security Threat Groups” or “STGs”). The\ngang plaintiffs claim that IDOC encouraged their gang\nactivity before 1996, but then changed policies and now\ntransfers gang leaders to Tamms for no reason but their\ngang affiliation. The litigation plaintiffs submit that IDOC\nhas a policy of transferring inmates with a history of filing\nactions, grievances or other complaints about IDOC and\nprison conditions. They claim that IDOC has a policy of\ntransferring prisoners with litigation histories to Tamms as\na means of retaliating for the trouble they cause the depart-\nment through their litigation activities. Each of these\nprisoners asserts that his disciplinary history does not\nwarrant an assignment to Tamms.\n\n\n\n\n1\n  In their initial complaint, the plaintiffs described the purpose\nof Tamms and the harshness of confinement conditions there. In\nthis appeal, IDOC has accepted the descriptions as true.\n2\n   Of the thirty-three captioned appellants in this case, Mr. Carroll\nhas been dismissed by his own request and Mr. Chapman\ncommitted suicide in August 2004. Of the remaining defendants,\nit appears that several have been released from IDOC’s custody\nor no longer are at Tamms. To the extent that the appellants no\nlonger are in custody or are incarcerated at Tamms, they lack\nstanding to request injunctive relief from their assignment to\nTamms.\n\f4                                                 No. 03-3318\n\nB. District Court Proceedings\n   In a four-count § 1983 complaint, only three counts of\nwhich are now before this court, the gang plaintiffs alleged\nviolations of the First Amendment right of association and\nof the right to be free from ex post facto punishment. The\nlitigation plaintiffs sought money damages and injunctive\nrelief for retaliatory interference with their First Amend-\nment right to petition the courts. All prisoners asserted\nviolations of their right to due process.\n  The district court conducted a preliminary screening of\nthe prisoners’ complaints. See 28 U.S.C. § 1915A. This review\nresulted in the dismissal for failure to state a claim of the\ndue process claim of all the prisoners as well as the associa-\ntional rights claim and the ex post facto claim of the gang\nplaintiffs.\n  With respect to the retaliation claim, the district court held\nthat the litigation plaintiffs met the threshold requirements\nof § 1915A because retaliation for exercising one’s right to\naccess to the courts is a cognizable constitutional claim, and\nthe prisoners had pleaded sufficiently such a claim. How-\never, the district court struck, as a discovery sanction, a\ngood deal of the evidence submitted by the prisoners on the\nissue of retaliation. Subsequently, it granted the state\nofficials summary judgment on the retaliation claim.\n   A more detailed rendition of the district court’s rationale\nis set forth in our discussion of each claim on appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                              II\n\fNo. 03-3318                                                5\n\n                      DISCUSSION\nA. The Gang Plaintiffs’ Claims\n  The gang plaintiffs asserted that their transfer to Tamms,\non account of gang membership, violated their First\nAmendment right to freedom of association and the Ex Post\nFacto Clause. The district court rejected the associational\nrights claim on the grounds that the prisoners had no First\nAmendment right to belong to a gang and that regulating\ngang activity served legitimate penological goals. The court\nrejected the ex post facto argument because the change in\nprison conditions constituted a reasonable regulation and\nnot additional punishment. Therefore, reasoned the district\ncourt, even if IDOC transferred them to Tamms in retalia-\ntion for their gang activities, the gang plaintiffs had no\ncognizable claim.\n  We review these § 1915A dismissals de novo. Calhoun v.\nDeTella, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"780878\"><a href=\"/opinion/780878/tyrone-calhoun-v-george-e-detella/\"><span class=\"volume\">319</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">936</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 939 (7th Cir. 2003). In undertaking\nsuch a review, we must construe all allegations as true and\nin the light most favorable to the prisoners. Id.\n\n\n    1. Freedom of Association\n  The gang plaintiffs submit that IDOC’s policy of transfer-\nring STG members to Tamms violates their First Amend-\nment right of association. They allege that IDOC’s policy\nprior to 1996 encouraged gang membership; current policy,\nby contrast, restricts prisoners’ rights to associate with\n               3\nprison gangs. The gang plaintiffs challenge IDOC’s regula-\ntions that allow officials to transfer prisoners who are gang\n\n\n3\n  At oral argument, IDOC admitted that prisons in the system\nhad a pre-1996 practice of cooperating with prison gangs to\nmaintain order in the facilities.\n\f6                                                   No. 03-3318\n\nmembers or “who may be planning to engage” in gang\nactivity, Ill. Admin. Code tit. 20, § 505.40(b), as unconstitu-\ntionally overbroad.\n  IDOC contends that the prisoners’ transfers to Tamms\nimplicate neither expressive nor intimate rights to associa-\ntion. In its view, regardless of whether IDOC once had a\npolicy of cooperating with prison gangs, prisoners have no\nFirst Amendment right to associate with gangs.\n   We agree with IDOC on this point. “Prison walls do not\nform a barrier separating prison inmates from the\nprotections of the Constitution.” Turner v.

The decision of prison administrators as\n\fNo. 03-3318                                                    7\n\nto the detrimental effect of such groups is a decision to\nwhich we owe great deference.

More-\nover, just recently, the Supreme Court spelled out, in no\nuncertain terms, the incompatibility of prison gangs with\nany penological system:\n    Prison security, imperiled by the brutal reality of prison\n    gangs, provides the backdrop of the State’s interest.\n    Clandestine, organized, fueled by race-based hostility,\n    and committed to fear and violence as a means of\n    disciplining their own members and their rivals, gangs\n    seek nothing less than to control prison life and to\n    extend their power outside prison walls. See Brief for\n    State of California et al. as Amici Curiae 6. Murder of an\n    inmate, a guard, or one of their family members on the\n    outside is a common form of gang discipline and\n    control, as well as a condition for membership in some\n    gangs. See, e.g., United States v. Santiago, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"687686\"><a href=\"/opinion/687686/united-states-v-richard-santiago-aka-chuco/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">885</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 888\n    (C.A.9 1995); United States v.

Testifying against, or otherwise\n    informing on, gang activities can invite one’s own death\n    sentence. It is worth noting in this regard that for prison\n    gang members serving life sentences, some without the\n    possibility of parole, the deterrent effects of ordinary\n    criminal punishment may be substantially diminished.\n    See id., at 1343 (“[T]o many inmates of Marion’s Control\n    Unit [a federal Supermax facility,] the price of murder\n    must not be high and to some it must be close to zero”).\n\n\nWilkinson, 125 S. Ct. at 2396-97.\n  Although, in the past, some prison officials in Illinois\napparently intentionally abdicated their authority to prison\ngang leaders, this inexplicable deviation certainly does not\n\f8                                                  No. 03-3318\n\ncast doubt on the reality that prison gangs are a manifest\nthreat to prison order and discipline and that there is no\nfederal constitutional impediment to their ban by prison\nofficials. We thus agree with the district court that the gang\nplaintiffs’ contention that they have a right grounded in the\nFirst Amendment to belong to a prison gang is simply too\ntenuous to state a claim. See Jones, 433 U.S. at 126-29; Rios v.\nLane, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"483858\"><a href=\"/opinion/483858/victor-rios-v-michael-p-lane/\"><span class=\"volume\">812</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1032</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1036 (7th Cir. 1987).\n\n\n    2. Ex Post Facto\n  The gang plaintiffs further submit that the district court\nerred in dismissing their § 1983 complaint because IDOC’s\npolicy of transferring them to Tamms violates the Ex Post\nFacto Clause of the Constitution. They base their argument\non IDOC’s pre-1996 policy of cooperating with prison\ngangs. According to the prisoners, IDOC’s policy shift from\nencouraging gang membership to transferring gang mem-\nbers to Tamms once the facility opened, constitutes ex post\n                                                  4\nfacto punishment of previously allowed activity.\n  The Ex Post Facto Clause forbids a legislature from\npassing laws retroactively altering the elements of or\nincreasing the punishment for a crime. California Dep’t of\nCorr. v. Morales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117925\"><a href=\"/opinion/117925/california-dept-of-corrections-v-morales/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 504 (1995). For ex post facto\npurposes, therefore, we must address whether (1) the action\ncomplained of constitutes a “law,” and (2) the sanction can\nbe considered a “punishment.” Id.\n\n\n\n4\n  In the alternative, the prisoners argue that the change in\nIDOC’s policy violates their due process rights because they were\nnot given fair warning that gang membership would give rise to\nadditional criminal penalties. We discuss this alternative argu-\nment in the due process discussion infra.\n\fNo. 03-3318                                                   9\n\n  On the first inquiry, we generally have limited ex post\nfacto consideration to legislative acts, and have not ex-\ntended the definition to interpretations of law made by\nadministrative agencies. See Prater v. U.S. Parole Comm’n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"477817\"><a href=\"/opinion/477817/william-j-prater-v-us-parole-commission-and-thomas-keohane-warden/\"><span class=\"volume\">802</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">948</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th Cir. 1986) (en banc). Under Illinois law, IDOC\nhas the discretionary authority to assign prisoners to any\nfacility in its system, 730 ILCS § 5/5-8-6(a), and we cannot\nsay that the exercise of this discretionary authority consti-\ntutes a “law” for ex post facto purposes.\n   The prisoners also fail the second inquiry. “As Collins [v.\nYoungblood, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112471\"><a href=\"/opinion/112471/collins-v-youngblood/\"><span class=\"volume\">497</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1990)] and subsequent cases make\nclear, the Ex Post Facto Clause does not prohibit every\nalteration in a prisoner’s confinement that may work to his\ndisadvantage.” Gilbert v.

We have noted\nthat a significant factor to consider in determining whether\na law is punitive is the statute’s purpose. Gilbert, 55 F.3d at\n238. Although a transfer to Tamms constitutes a change in\nthe conditions of confinement for a duly-convicted prisoner,\nit cannot be characterized as an increase in the punishment\nfor the crime of conviction, but rather is a response to\nlegitimate security concerns and forwards valid penological\ninterests. See Morales, 514 U.S. at 510.\n  The district court correctly dismissed the gang plaintiffs’\nex post facto claims.\n\n\nB. The Litigation Plaintiffs’ Claims\n   The litigation plaintiffs alleged that they had been sent to\nTamms in retaliation for filing lawsuits against IDOC and\nits officials. The district court determined that several of the\n\f10                                                   No. 03-3318\n\nprisoners—Mr. Felton, Mr. Horton, Mr. V. Rodriguez and\nMr. Santiago—had failed to exhaust their administrative\nremedies. It therefore dismissed the suits of these prisoners\nwithout prejudice.\n  IDOC moved for summary judgment. At the same time,\nthey moved to strike certain evidence offered by the prison-\ners in response, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n37(c)(1). The evidence consisted of affidavits indicating that\n                                                  5\ninformation in the prisoners’ placement forms was false.\nThe IDOC officials admitted relying upon these forms in\nmaking their transfer decisions. IDOC predicated its motion\nto strike on the assertion that the prisoners had presented\nthis evidence but had failed to amend answers to\npreviously-served IDOC interrogatories as required by\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 26.\n  The district court granted both the motion to strike and\nthe motion for summary judgment. On the motion to strike,\nthe substance of which is considered in greater detail below,\nthe court determined that the prisoners had insufficient\njustification for failing to amend their answers to IDOC\ninterrogatories. The district court therefore did not consider,\nwhen deciding the summary judgment motion, the prison-\ners’ claim that IDOC had placed them at Tamms based on\n                            6\nfalsified placement forms.\n\n\n5\n   Placement forms summarize personal information about the\nprisoner, including their segregation status and the STG affilia-\ntion or general disciplinary problems justifying their transfer to\nTamms.\n6\n  The district court also determined that the prisoners failed to\ndisclose facts supporting their claim against Mr. Snyder as\nrequested in the interrogatories. As a result, the court dismissed\n                                                     (continued...)\n\fNo. 03-3318                                                      11\n                                                             7\n  On the merits of the summary judgment motion, the\ndistrict court noted that, in order to prevail on their retalia-\ntion claim, the prisoners had to demonstrate that their\nconduct was constitutionally protected and that this conduct\n(the litigation previously filed by the prisoners) constituted\na substantial or motivating factor in IDOC’s decision to\ntransfer them to Tamms. Each prisoner presented a chronol-\nogy of events that allegedly demonstrated that their filing of\na previous lawsuit had motivated IDOC’s transfer decision.\n                                            8\nWith the sole exception of Mr. Clayton, the district court\ndetermined that the prisoners’ chronologies had failed to\nconnect their transfers to their previous litigation activity.\nBecause these prisoners had not offered any additional\nevidence, the court determined that they had not met their\nburden. The court further opined that the same result would\nobtain for Mr. Felton and Mr. Horton, had their cases not\nbeen dismissed for failure to exhaust.\n    The prisoners now appeal the district court’s § 1915A\n\n\n6\n (...continued)\nMr. Snyder as a defendant.\n7\n  The court also treated the motion for summary judgment as a\nmotion by all of the officials—including some defendants who\nhad not filed motions—because the Illinois Attorney General\nrepresented all of the defendants.\n8\n  As for Mr. Clayton, the district court noted that he had\npresented some evidence of a direct threat, made by one of the\nofficials named as defendants, to send him to Tamms because of\nhis grievances and lawsuits. However, because an official other\nthan the one who had allegedly threatened Mr. Clayton approved\nhis transfer, the district court determined that Mr. Clayton had\nfailed to connect his activities with his transfer. Therefore, with\nrespect to each of the prisoners, the district court granted\nsummary judgment in favor of the prison officials.\n\f12                                                 No. 03-3318\n\nruling based on exhaustion as well as its grant of IDOC’s\nmotions to strike and for summary judgment.\n\n\n  1. Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies\n  The Prison Litigation Reform Act (“PLRA”) prohibits\nprisoners from filing suit with respect to prison conditions\nunless all available administrative remedies have been\nexhausted. 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a). The parties agree that this\naction is subject to the PLRA’s exhaustion requirement.\nAlthough exhaustion is a precondition to the prisoners’ suit,\nfailure to exhaust is an affirmative defense that IDOC has\nthe burden of proving. See Dale v. Lappin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"787033\"><a href=\"/opinion/787033/curtis-l-dale-v-harley-g-lappin/\"><span class=\"volume\">376</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">652</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 656\n(7th Cir. 2004). IDOC claims that several of the prisoners\nfailed to exhaust their administrative remedies and are\nprecluded from bringing this suit.\n  Our consideration of this question requires that we\nascertain the administrative procedures by which a prisoner\nmay challenge his transfer to Tamms. Because the record\nand the initial briefing did not present a clear picture, we\nrequested that the parties file supplemental briefs address-\ning the administrative procedures available to a Tamms\nprisoner. Upon review of these submissions,we must\nconclude that IDOC has not carried its burden of establish-\ning that the prisoners failed to exhaust available administra-\ntive remedies.\n  IDOC submits that inmates have two avenues through\nwhich they must challenge their transfers to Tamms:\nthrough the transfer review hearing process and the inmate\ngrievance process. Illinois regulations establish two types of\ntransfer hearings at Tamms, depending on the inmate’s\nsegregation category upon arrival at the facility. Prisoners\nare classified as subject to either administrative or disciplin-\n\fNo. 03-3318                                                 13\n\nary segregation, and different review processes govern each\ncategory.\n   Inmates who are in administrative detention when they\narrive are afforded a transfer review hearing within ten\nworking days (“whenever possible”) of their transfer to\nTamms. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 20, § 505.60(a). This hearing\nincludes the opportunity for an inmate to appear, make\nstatements challenging his placement, submit documentary\nevidence and request that the transfer review committee\ninterview other persons. Id. § 505.60(b). The committee then\nmakes a recommendation to the Chief Administrative\nOfficer (“CAO,” i.e., the warden), who approves or denies\nthe recommendation before forwarding it to the Assistant\n                                    9\nDeputy Director. Id. § 505.60(d). Presumably, those plain-\ntiffs who were sent to Tamms in administrative detention\nstatus received this initial transfer review hearing, although,\nfor reasons discussed below, the record is silent in that\nrespect.\n  Inmates who are transferred to Tamms in disciplinary\nsegregation status are not afforded an initial transfer review\nhearing; regulations provide only that such individuals\nreceive a hearing after their term of disciplinary segregation\nends. Id. § 505.60(a). This provision must prove problematic\nfor some inmates. If a prisoner is sent to Tamms in a\ndisciplinary segregation status that does not expire for a\nvery long time, he will not have a hearing on his transfer to\nTamms until the expiration of that very long disciplinary\nsentence.\n\n\n9\n  IDOC notes that its policy has changed from that contained in\nthe regulations and that the recommendation goes from the CAO\nto the Deputy Director, who apparently approves a transfer if\nwarranted.\n\f14                                               No. 03-3318\n\n  Apart from the initial transfer review hearing, the review\ncommittee conducts a review of each prisoner’s file every\nninety days to determine whether placement at Tamms is\nstill appropriate. Id. § 505.70(a). The ninety-day review does\nnot afford the inmate an opportunity to be heard or to\npresent evidence. In addition, although IDOC represents\nthat the ninety-day review is conducted for every Tamms\ninmate, see Appellees’ Supplemental Br. at 4 n.4, the regula-\ntion indicates that such quarterly review only applies to\nthose in administrative detention, see Ill. Admin. Code tit.\n20, § 505.70(a) (noting that the committee “review[s] the\nrecord of each committed person in administrative deten-\ntion”).\n  For individuals in administrative detention, the transfer\nreview committee conducts an additional hearing every\nyear in which the inmate has the same opportunity to be\nheard and to present evidence challenging his transfer as in\nthe initial hearing, and is also entitled to notice of the\ncommittee’s finding. Id. § 505.70(b) (stating that the annual\nhearing is to be held in accordance with the standards of the\ninitial review). Again, the individuals in administrative\ndetention that have been at Tamms for more than a year\nhave presumably been afforded such annual reviews, while\nthose in disciplinary detention status presumably have not.\n  We say “presumably” with respect to the administrative\nreview hearings because it appears that IDOC has not\nprovided the prisoners with the hearing records, which they\nrequested early in this litigation. Nevertheless, without\nevidence to the contrary, we presume that Tamms officials\nfollow Illinois regulations, in which case every prisoner\ntransferred in administrative detention has been afforded a\n\fNo. 03-3318                                                     15\n                  10\nreview hearing. Prisoners who were transferred in, and\nremain in, disciplinary segregation have not yet qualified\nfor a review hearing, and this administrative remedy is\nunavailable to them. See Lewis v. Washington, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"778797\"><a href=\"/opinion/778797/peter-lewis-v-odie-washington-director-illinois-department-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">300</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">829</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n833 (7th Cir. 2002).\n   IDOC’s position that the transfer review process affords\nan administrative remedy is unconvincing for another\nreason. Many of the prisoners contend that they were not\ntold the reasons for their transfer to Tamms; indeed, several\nprisoners filed grievances to complain about this problem.\nIDOC regulations do not require the department to notify\nprisoners why they have been transferred. We doubt\nwhether the transfer review process is effective for prisoners\nwho do not know the grounds for their transfer and who\nthus have no basis with which to contest their transfer. More\nimportantly, if a prisoner discovers the reasons for his\ntransfer shortly after completing the initial transfer review\nhearing and wishes to contest the transfer because, for\ninstance, the reasons are based on incorrect facts, he must\nwait at least one more year before he can present evidence\nat his annual review hearing. For all these reasons, with\nrespect to the transfer review process, IDOC has not carried\nits burden of establishing that the prisoners have not\nsatisfied PLRA exhaustion requirements.\n\n\n\n\n10\n  IDOC does not argue that the prisoners have failed to exhaust\nadministrative remedies because an annual status review is\navailable to those in administrative detention status. Nor do they\nargue that the ultimate availability of a transfer hearing to those\nin disciplinary segregation—available, that is, after their period\nof disciplinary segregation ends—means that such prisoners have\nalso failed to exhaust available remedies.\n\f16                                                No. 03-3318\n\n  IDOC also submits that the inmate grievance process is\nanother avenue for challenging transfer to Tamms. Al-\nthough we have considered, in previous cases, IDOC’s\ngrievance process in challenging general prison conditions,\nwe have not addressed whether the grievance process is an\nadministrative remedy by which a prisoner may challenge\nhis transfer to Tamms. In Illinois, “incidents, problems, or\ncomplaints” may be grieved, Ill. Admin. Code tit. 20,\n§ 504.810(a), but the grievance process cannot be “utilized\nfor complaints regarding decisions that are outside the\nauthority of the Department, such as parole decisions,\nclemency, or orders regarding length of sentence or deci-\nsions that have been rendered by the Director.” Id.\n  There seems to be significant confusion within IDOC,\npresumably caused by the “or decisions that have been\nrendered by the Director” clause of section 504.810(a), as to\nwhether a Tamms prisoner may grieve his transfer, IDOC\ndid not challenge every plaintiff on exhaustion grounds,\nand treatment of grievances by IDOC’s ultimate grievance\nappeal body, the Administrative Review Board (“ARB”),\nvaried among the prisoners. For instance, the ARB re-\nsponded to Mr. Combs’ grievance complaining about\nimproper placement at Tamms by offering reasons for the\ntransfer (e.g., gang activity). This action would seem to\nindicate that the ARB, at least, believed the grievance\nprocess to be the proper challenge avenue. In contrast,\nalthough he is no longer a party to this suit, the treatment of\nMr. Carroll’s grievance is instructive, especially given that\nIDOC did not challenge whether he exhausted his remedies.\nThe ARB simply replied to his complaint that transfer to\nTamms was not an issue that it could address, but rather\nwas an administrative prerogative of IDOC.\n\fNo. 03-3318                                                    17\n\n  In addition, there is some evidence that a Tamms coun-\nselor told Mr. Knox that he could not grieve placement at\nthe facility; this evidence the district court found sufficient\nto establish that Mr. Knox had exhausted all available\nadministrative remedies. However, Mr. V. Rodriguez, one\nof the prisoners whose claims the district court dismissed\nfor failure to exhaust, also submitted an affidavit setting\nforth a similar account. Prior to his transfer to Tamms, he\nreceived a disciplinary report at another facility, but he\ncompleted the appeal of that report after his transfer. Mr. V.\nRodriguez claims that IDOC officials led him to believe that\nhis administrative remedy lay in challenging his transfer to\nTamms, together with an existing administrative appeal that\n                                                       11\nhe was pursuing to challenge disciplinary action. In its\nsupplemental brief, IDOC does not respond to or explain\nthe inconsistent treatment.\n   Despite a number of Tamms-specific regulations in the\nIllinois Administrative Code, see id., pt. 505, IDOC does not\npoint to any regulation or department policy that clearly\nidentifies how a prisoner challenges his transfer to Tamms.\nIf, for example, the regulations specified that a prisoner\nmust challenge his transfer through the grievance process,\nor indicated the form that such a challenge should take, the\nprisoners would be obliged to conform to those administra-\n\n\n11\n  Mr. V. Rodriguez was transferred to Tamms while awaiting a\ndisciplinary action (assaulting a guard) through the IDOC\nadministrative system. He claims that the grievance officer at\nTamms told him that he could challenge his transfer together\nwith his administrative appeal of the disciplinary action. Mr. V.\nRodriguez never filed a separate grievance challenging his\ntransfer because he claims that he was led to believe that, by\nappealing his transfer at the same time he appealed the disciplin-\nary action, he exhausted his administrative remedies.\n\f18                                                    No. 03-3318\n\ntive requirements. If the ARB took consistent positions on its\nauthority to address a transfer grievance, a clear route for\nthe prisoner at least would be evident and we could proceed\nto determine its effectiveness. But, as this case comes to us,\nwe find the record “hopelessly unclear . . . whether any\nadministrative remedy” remained open for the prisoners to\nchallenge their transfers through the grievance process.\nWalker v. Thompson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"777502\"><a href=\"/opinion/777502/tony-walker-v-tommy-g-thompson/\"><span class=\"volume\">288</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1005</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1009 (7th Cir. 2002). With\nregard to Mr. Felton, Mr. Horton, Mr. V.

Although their purported placement chal-\nlenges were made within substantive complaints about\nTamms conditions, each prisoners’ grievance expressed\nconcern about not being told the reason for his transfer to\nTamms or listed something to the effect of “Transfer from\nTamms” as the requested remedy. These complaints were\n\n\n12\n  The district court dismissed Mr. Santiago because he submitted\nthe grievance that he claimed exhausted his administrative\nremedies after this suit was filed. The appellants here do not\nchallenge his dismissal. But, because it is unclear whether the\ngrievance process may be used to challenge a prisoner’s transfer\nto Tamms, Mr. Santiago’s failure timely to file a grievance is of no\nmoment, and we conclude that the district court erred in dismiss-\ning him on that ground.\n\fNo. 03-3318                                                     19\n\nsufficient to alert prison officials that Mr. Felton and Mr.\nHorton challenged their transfers, even though the griev-\nance officers in each case addressed the prison condition\ncomplaints without mentioning their transfers to Tamms.\n  We therefore reverse the district court’s dismissal of the\nclaims of Mr. Felton, Mr. Horton, Mr. V. Rodriguez and Mr.\nSantiago.\n\n\n     2. Discovery\n   The litigation plaintiffs believe that they were sent to\nTamms in retaliation for filing legal actions against IDOC\n                  13\nand its officials. Proving this theory required the prisoners\nto reconstruct the decision-making process leading to their\ntransfers. To accomplish this task, the prisoners requested\na number of documents from IDOC. Included in the re-\nquested documents were: placement forms for each pris-\noner; the results of any administrative reviews conducted\nsince their arrival at Tamms; each prisoner’s ARB file; the\nlitigation files of each litigation plaintiff; documents listing\nprisoners considered eligible for placement in Tamms who\n\n\n\n13\n  Because the district court rejected the associational rights and\nthe ex post facto counts of the gang plaintiffs, the remaining\ndiscovery disputes primarily involved the litigation plaintiffs.\nIndeed, given that the First Amendment and ex post facto\ncomplaints were dismissed early on, the district court and\nmagistrate judge determined, correctly, that many of the prison-\ners’ discovery requests had become irrelevant. Because the\ndistrict court correctly dismissed these counts, we need not\naddress the district court’s handling of the prisoners’ discovery\nrequests aimed solely at proving the gang plaintiffs’ associational\nrights and ex post facto violations.\n\f20                                                     No. 03-3318\n                         14\nwere not transferred; and any documents discussing the\ntransfer of the named plaintiffs, rather than other prisoners,\nto Tamms.\n  Before considering the specific discovery disputes at issue\nin this appeal, it is useful to recount certain aspects of the\ndiscovery history in this case. The record reveals that both\nIDOC and the prisoners were slow in discovery. The\nprisoners delayed answering IDOC’s interrogatories and, at\n                                                         15\none point, earned a warning about possible sanctions.\n\n14\n   The prisoners sought records of non-Tamms inmates to\ndemonstrate, among other things, that IDOC transferred the\nlitigation plaintiffs but did not transfer prisoners who presented\nmore severe disciplinary or gang-related problems. They argued\nthat, together with their litigation files, these records would raise\nan inference that the litigation plaintiffs were transferred solely\non the basis of their litigation activities.\n15\n  In a similar vein, later in the proceedings, the prisoners’\nidentical form responses to IDOC’s interrogatories were to\nbecome a matter of controversy. Every IDOC defendant except\nMr. Snyder served three interrogatories on each remaining\nplaintiff. Mr. Snyder served four interrogatories; numbers 2\nthrough 4 were the same as other officials’ three interrogatories.\nThe relevant interrogatory, numbered 1 generally but Mr.\nSnyder’s number 2, read: “State the factual basis for your\nassertion that Defendant [official’s last name] approved your\ntransfer to Tamms Super Max Correctional Center in retaliation\nfor litigation, grievances or ‘writ writing.’ ” See, e.g., R.69, Ex.3.\n  The prisoner responses were apparently drafted using Mr.\nSnyder’s interrogatories as a model, and repeated for every\nprisoner in response to each IDOC official. Each prisoner gave the\nsame response to the second interrogatory, that is, Mr. Snyder’s\nsecond, even though, for the other officials, the response should\nhave been to the first question. Regardless of which IDOC official\n                                                     (continued...)\n\fNo. 03-3318                                                     21\n\n  The circumstances surrounding the State’s production of\nthe placement forms, crucial to the prisoners’ claim, must be\n                          16\nexamined in some detail. IDOC eventually produced the\nforms and attached them to its renewed motion for sum-\nmary judgment, together with affidavits from IDOC officers\nstating that they had relied on the placement forms when\ndeciding the appropriateness of a prisoner’s transfer to\nTamms. The State argued that the officials’ reliance on\n\n\n15\n  (...continued)\nthe prisoner addressed, the prisoner stated:\n     I do not have any personal knowledge that defendant Snyder\n     personally approved my transfer to Tamms. Rather, I\n     contend that defendant Snyder approved policies and\n     procedures which permitted prisoners to be transferred to\n     Tamms in retaliation for activities which were protected by\n     the First Amendment.\nSee, e.g., R.69, Ex.29. The plaintiffs claimed that, “[r]ather than\nprovide duplicative answers to the same questions asked\nseparately by each of the defendants, plaintiffs sought to simplify\ntheir responses by combining all defendants’ interrogatories.”\nR.104 at 5.\n16\n  On October 28, 2002, at the same time the district court granted\nIDOC leave to renew its summary judgment motion, it ordered\nIDOC to produce documents relied on by the officials in deciding\nwhich prisoners to transfer to Tamms. The prisoners had asked\nfor the documents with their initial discovery request in August\n2000. A month later, IDOC produced approximately 7500 pages\nof documents in compliance. Based on the volume of material,\nthe district court granted additional time, until January 29, 2003,\nfor the prisoners to reply to IDOC’s summary judgment motion.\nThe district court subsequently granted a motion to file instanter,\nand the prisoners filed their response on February 10, 2003—the\nsame day the court held a hearing on the summary judgment\nmotion.\n\f22                                                No. 03-3318\n\nprisoner placement forms belied the prisoners’ claim that\nIDOC transferred them in retaliation for any protected\nactivity.\n  The prisoners then sought to introduce affidavits alleging\nthat the information contained in the placement forms was\nuntrue. They contended that IDOC officials had falsified\ntheir gang associations or disciplinary histories to justify\ntheir transfers to Tamms. IDOC moved to strike this evi-\ndence and all other evidence that the placement forms were\nincorrect, that the prisoners’ disciplinary histories were\ninsufficient to warrant assignment to Tamms, that the\ntiming of their transfers was suspicious, and that Mr.\nSnyder could be held liable for the transfers.\n  In resisting the efforts of the prisoners to have the court\nconsider the prisoners’ evidence that the transfer documents\nwere false, IDOC crafted its motion as a request for discov-\nery sanctions. It argued that the prisoners had failed to\namend their previous interrogatory answers (that is, their\n                     17\nanswer number 2) to encompass the new falsification\ntheories, in violation of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n26(e)(2).\n  The district court granted IDOC’s motion to strike on\nessentially two related grounds. First, the court considered\nthe prisoners’ answers to IDOC interrogatories to be\n“incomplete” under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(a)(3)\nbecause they failed to present any supporting facts in spite\nof the interrogatories’ request for “the factual basis for your\nassertion that Defendant . . . approved your transfer to\nTamms.” R.69, Ex.3. Second, the district court agreed with\nIDOC that the prisoners’ contention—that information in\n\n\n17\n     See supra note 15.\n\fNo. 03-3318                                                      23\n\ntheir placement forms had been falsified—was a new theory\nbased on new evidence. Because the prisoners failed to\namend their responses to the IDOC interrogatories to reflect\ntheir new allegation and provide more complete factual\nbases for their claims, as required by Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 26(e)(2), the district court excluded from consid-\neration the prisoners’ affidavits (or any other evidence that\nthey might have produced) contending that their placement\n                                                             18\nforms had been falsified, as a sanction under Rule 37(c)(1).\n                                                           19\n  The prisoners’ argument in this appeal is twofold. First,\nthey submit that the district court erred in concluding that\nthey had violated Rule 26(e)(2) by not supplementing their\ninterrogatory responses. Because IDOC had not produced\nthe placement forms or other requested discovery when\nthey answered the interrogatories, the prisoners note that\nthey could not have known the falsehoods contained in the\nforms—falsehoods which formed the “factual basis” for\ntheir claim. The prisoners argue that they complied with the\nrequirements of Rule 26 by offering affidavits, and they\ncharacterize any requirement to go back and supplement\ntheir interrogatory answers as a “duplicative, meaningless\n\n\n18\n  In addition, the district court noted that the prisoners’ form\nresponses to IDOC interrogatories mentioned only Mr. Snyder.\nSee supra note 15. Because their responses were inadequate and\nonly applied to Mr. Snyder, the district court determined that he\nwas not liable as a matter of law and dismissed him from the suit.\nGiven our decision concerning the propriety of the discovery\nsanction, it was inappropriate for the district court to dismiss Mr.\nSnyder at this stage of the litigation.\n19\n   IDOC argues that the prisoners have waived any challenge to\ndistrict court discovery decisions because their brief does not\ncomply with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28(a)(9)(A). We\nfind the prisoners’ submission to be sufficient.\n\f24                                                No. 03-3318\n\nformality.” Appellants’ Br. at 44. Second, the prisoners\nassert that, even if they violated the letter of Rule 26, the\ndistrict court abused its discretion by imposing its Rule 37\nsanction.\n  Although we review the district court’s discovery rulings\nfor abuse of discretion, “[t]he district court must apply the\ncorrect legal standards and not reach an erroneous conclu-\nsion of law in forming the basis for the sanction of exclu-\nsion.” Musser v.

They contend that the affidavits\n“otherwise . . . made known . . . in writing” to IDOC that the\nprisoners contested the truthfulness of their placement\nforms and therefore complied with Rule 26.

Although the prisoners did not amend their interrog-\natory answers, their response to IDOC’s summary judgment\nmotion placed the officials on written notice that the\nprisoners challenged the placement forms’ veracity. There\nwas no unfair surprise in the prisoners’ failure to amend\ntheir interrogatories, especially given IDOC’s delay in\nproducing the relevant documents. The prisoners’ submis-\nsions complied with Rule 26.\n  Because the district court declined to consider the prison-\ners’ contention that information in their placement forms\nwas false, it assumed the forms to be true when analyzing\nIDOC’s rationale for transferring the plaintiffs. The prison-\ners were left only with chronologies indicating that their\ntransfers were suspicious; the district court found these\nchronologies to be inadequate to allow the prisoners to\nsurvive summary judgment. We cannot say whether the\n\n\n20\n  (...continued)\nmotion was heard and more than two years after they first\nrequested the documents.\n   We ordinarily refuse to consider arguments not made before\nthe district court.

In\ntheir submission to this court, IDOC’s waiver argument on this\nissue is focused solely on the adequacy of the prisoners’ brief; the\nofficials do not argue that the appellants have waived their\ncontention that submitting affidavits complied with their Rule 26\nobligations.

Indeed, our review of the\nhistory of this case indicates that application of the David factors\nleads to a conclusion that any Rule 26 violation was harmless.\n  There is no evidence that the prisoners’ failure to amend their\ninterrogatory responses was the result of willfulness or bad faith;\nindeed, it seems clear that IDOC resisted producing discovery,\ndelayed in submitting the placement forms and, in the end,\ndeluged the prisoners with document production shortly before\nthe district court resolved its summary judgment motion.\n  Nor can we say that the prisoners’ failure to amend their\ninterrogatory responses prejudiced or surprised IDOC because\nthe prisoners offered their falsification theory shortly after\ndiscovering it through IDOC’s late discovery.

Moreover, any prejudice that IDOC did suffer easily\ncould have been cured by granting IDOC additional time in\nwhich to respond to the new allegations. Therefore, even if the\nprisoners had violated Rule 26 by failing to amend their interrog-\natory responses, the district court abused its discretion in\nexcluding evidence supporting their falsification theory.\n\f30                                                No. 03-3318\n\nWilkinson gives substantial guidance on the appropriate\nresolution of the issues in the present case. Consequently,\nafter its rendition by the Supreme Court, the parties to this\ncase submitted their views on how the Court’s rationale\nought to affect our decision in this case.\n   Wilkinson upheld, against a due process challenge, Ohio’s\nprocedure for transferring prisoners to the Ohio State\nPenitentiary (“OSP”), that state’s “supermax” prison, a\nfacility designed to hold the most dangerous prisoners who\nposed a special threat if incarcerated in the general prison\npopulation. At OSP, almost every aspect of the inmate’s life\nwas controlled and monitored. Extreme isolation was\nimposed; opportunities for visitation were sharply curtailed\nand always conducted through glass walls. The inmates\nwere deprived of almost every form of environmental or\nsensory stimuli. There was very little human contact. A\nprisoner could be placed in the supermax for an indefinite\nperiod of time; only the length of the prisoner’s sentence\nmarked the outer limits of his stay. If an inmate was other-\nwise eligible for parole, he lost that eligibility while as-\nsigned to the facility.\n  Under the policy finally adopted by Ohio to govern the\nselection of prisoners for placement in the supermax facility,\na prison official conducted, prior to placement, a classifica-\ntion review. This review focused on the offense of convic-\ntion in the case of prisoners just committed to the prison\nsystem and on certain types of conduct in the case of those\nalready incarcerated. The prisoner was notified of the\nfactual basis for a recommendation for placement in the\nsupermax and given a fair opportunity for rebuttal at a\nhearing. He could not, however, call witnesses. Addition-\nally, prior to the final level of review, the prisoner was given\nan opportunity to submit objections to the recommendation.\nThere were three levels of review. At each level, a decision\n\fNo. 03-3318                                                  31\n\nagainst placement in the supermax facility terminated the\nprocess and the prisoner was not assigned to the supermax.\nAfter placement in the supermax prison, a prisoner received\na review after thirty days and an annual review thereafter.\n  The Supreme Court held that prisoners had a constitution-\nally protected liberty interest in avoiding assignment to\nOSP. Reiterating the conclusion it reached in Meachum v.\nFano, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109510\"><a href=\"/opinion/109510/meachum-v-fano/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">215</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 225 (1976), the Court noted “that the\nConstitution itself does not give rise to a liberty interest in\navoiding transfer to more adverse conditions of confine-\nment.” Wilkinson, 125 S. Ct. at 2393. However, continued the\nCourt, “a liberty interest in avoiding particular conditions\nof confinement may arise from state policies or regulations,\nsubject to the important limitations set forth in Sandin v.\nConnor, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117957\"><a href=\"/opinion/117957/sandin-v-conner/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1995).” Id. The Court went on to\nemphasize that Sandin pointedly had rejected the methodol-\nogy of parsing the language of particular regulations.\nRather, “the touchstone of the inquiry into the existence of\na protected, state-created liberty interest . . . is not the\nlanguage of regulations regarding those conditions but the\nnature of those conditions themselves ‘in relation to the\nordinary incidents of prison life.’ ” Id. at 2394 (quoting\nSandin, 515 U.S. at 484).\n  The Supreme Court then went on to apply the methodol-\nogy of Sandin to the situation before it. It noted the inconsis-\ntent results that courts of appeals have reached in applying\nthe Sandin formula because it is difficult to determine a\nbaseline from which to ascertain whether the conditions of\nconfinement are an atypical and significant hardship.\nNoting the absence of briefing on the subject in the case\nbefore it, the Court nevertheless concluded that it was\nunnecessary to explore the issue because the conditions at\nOSP posed an “atypical and significant hardship under any\n\f32                                                No. 03-3318\n\nplausible baseline.” Id. It described those conditions in these\nterms:\n     For an inmate placed in OSP, almost all human contact\n     is prohibited, even to the point that conversation is not\n     permitted from cell to cell; the light, though it may be\n     dimmed, is on for 24 hours; exercise is for 1 hour per\n     day, but only in a small indoor room. Save perhaps for\n     the especially severe limitations on all human contact,\n     these conditions likely would apply to most solitary\n     confinement facilities, but here there are two added\n     components. First is the duration. Unlike the 30-day\n     placement in Sandin, placement at OSP is indefinite and,\n     after an initial 30-day review, is reviewed just annually.\n     Second is that placement disqualifies an otherwise\n     eligible inmate for parole consideration. While any of\n     these conditions standing alone might not be sufficient\n     to create a liberty interest, taken together they impose\n     an atypical and significant hardship within the correc-\n     tional context. It follows that respondents have a liberty\n     interest in avoiding assignment to OSP.\nWilkinson, 125 S. Ct. at 2394-95 (citations omitted).\n  Having determined that the conditions at the Ohio\nsupermax facility imposed an atypical and significant\nhardship within the correctional context and thus consti-\ntuted the deprivation of a liberty interest, the Supreme\nCourt turned to the question of what process was required\nbefore such conditions were imposed on a prisoner. Re-\nminding the reader that the Court previously has avoided\nthe use of rigid rules, see Morrissey v. Brewer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108606\"><a href=\"/opinion/108606/morrissey-v-brewer/\"><span class=\"volume\">408</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">471</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n481 (1972), in favor of flexibility tailored to the particular\nsituation, the Court articulated the familiar framework of\nMathews v. Eldridge, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109382\"><a href=\"/opinion/109382/mathews-v-eldridge/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">319</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1976), that requires a court\nto consider the following three factors:\n\fNo. 03-3318                                                 33\n\n    First, the private interest that will be affected by the\n    official action; second, the risk of an erroneous depriva-\n    tion of such interest through the procedures used, and\n    the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute\n    procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government’s\n    interest, including the function involved and the fiscal\n    and administrative burdens that the additional or\n    substitute procedural requirement would entail.\nId. at 335.\n   With respect to the first factor, the Court noted that the\nprivate interest of the prisoner to be free from confinement,\nwhile “more than minimal,” had to be evaluated in the\ncontext of the prison system where, pursuant to a lawful\nsentence, confinement already has curtailed liberty to a\ngreat degree. Wilkinson, 125 S. Ct. at 2395. The private\nliberty interest, then, is clearly not as plenary as that of an\nindividual not under the sentence of a court. With respect to\nthe second factor, the Court focused on Ohio’s provision for\nnotice and opportunity to rebut the reasons offered by the\nState for placement in OSP. Id. at 2396. The Court noted that,\nin addition to notice and hearing, the prisoner was given an\nopportunity to submit a rebuttal to an affirmative recom-\nmendation at the last of three levels of review. Moreover, a\nrecommendation against placement at any level ended the\nprocess and the prisoner was not placed at the supermax. If\na reviewer did recommend placement in the supermax, the\nprisoner received a statement of reasons for use before the\nnext decision-maker or in a subsequent classification\nreview. The statement also served, noted the Court, as a\nguide for the prisoner with respect to his future behavior.\nFinally, noted the Court, the Ohio regulations provided for\na review after the prisoner had been at the supermax facility\nfor thirty days. In the Court’s view, this regulatory scheme\nadequately ensured against an erroneous decision in the\n\f34                                                 No. 03-3318\n\nplacement process.\n  The Court minced no words in applying the third Mathews\nfactor, the interest of the public officials charged with the\nresponsibility of running prisons. See id. at 2396-97. The\nState’s first responsibility, the Court wrote, is to ensure the\nsafety of guards, prison personnel, the public and the\nprisoners themselves. The Court also noted the pressing\nneed of the State to manage prudently its assets in a context\nof scarce resources. Therefore, concluded the Justices, courts\nmust approach estimations such as the one required by the\nthird prong of the Mathews test with substantial deference\nto prison management decisions. Id. at 2397.\n  After balancing the Mathews factors, the Court concluded\nthat Ohio’s policies adequately safeguarded against an\nerroneous decision. The Court pointed out that the inquiry\nhere is not an inquiry into a specific incident, but an assess-\nment of a prisoner’s entire record and a prognostication\nabout future behavior. Such a decision does not turn simply\non whether the prisoner committed a specific act. Rather, it\nturns on an assessment that requires the experience of\nprison administrators—an assessment that is more suscepti-\nble to resolution in an informal procedure.\n  We turn now to an examination of how the Supreme\nCourt’s recent guidance in Wilkinson governs the case before\nus. As we noted earlier, we have the assistance of counsel\nfor both parties through the thoughtful supplemental briefs\nthey have filed recently.\n  The State of Illinois, representing its defendant officials,\ntakes the position that, under Wilkinson, the prisoners\ncannot claim a cognizable liberty interest. First, it notes that\nthere are some differences between Tamms and OSP with\nrespect to the conditions of confinement. The cells in\nTamms, it points out, have windows; the doors are mesh\n\fNo. 03-3318                                                  35\n\nrather than solid steel; the exercise yard is partially out-\ndoors. It also points out that, although the prisoners allege\nthat visitation at Tamms is cumbersome and expensive,\nespecially for individuals from the Chicago area, they do\nnot allege, as the Ohio prisoners did, that the opportunities\nfor visitation are rare. More important, continues the State,\nassignment to Tamms does not affect the length of confine-\nment because nothing in the regulations says that placement\nat Tamms directly affects parole eligibility, mandatory\nsupervised release, good conduct credits or good time\nrestoration. In the State’s view, this latter point is crucial\nbecause it reads both Wilkinson and Sandin as grounding a\nrecognition of liberty interest on the effect of the state-\nimposed restraint on the length of the prisoner’s sentence.\n   In the alternative, the State claims that, even if there is a\nliberty interest implicated in a placement at Tamms, the pre-\nand post-transfer procedures for such assignments satisfy\nthe needs of due process. It begins its argument by empha-\nsizing that Wilkinson requires only an informal,\nnonadversarial process. It also points out that the Supreme\nCourt did not say that the detailed procedures employed by\nOhio were to be considered a constitutional floor.\n  The prisoners take a different view of the applicability of\nWilkinson. They emphasize the procedural posture of this\naspect of the present case. Because the district court dis-\nmissed the due process claim of the complaint on the\npleadings, we are obliged to read all the allegations of that\ncomplaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs. They\nfurther submit that the complaint contains statements that\nclearly allege that the conditions at Tamms fit the profile for\n“atypical and significant hardship” as that phrase is em-\nployed in Sandin and in Wilkinson. They specifically note the\nfollowing:\n    Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint alleged:\n\f36                                                No. 03-3318\n\n        9. Tamms is designed to be extremely harsh. IDOC\n        officials have stated that they want conditions at\n        Tamms to be so bad that inmates throughout the\n        system are motivated to follow all departmental\n        rules based upon the mere threat of being trans-\n        ferred to Tamms.\n        10. The conditions of confinement at Tamms present\n        inmates with atypical and significant hardships in\n        relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life,\n        including the hardships imposed at the most restric-\n        tive segregation units in Illinois’ maximum security\n        prisons. At Tamms, control and punishment are\n        imposed through extreme social isolation, severely\n        restricted movement, and an environment that\n        virtually eliminates all external stimuli.\nPlaintiffs’ amended complaint describes the extraordinarily\nrestrictive conditions imposed on prisoners at Tamms in\ngreat detail (¶’s 11-24). The restrictions include (among\nothers) virtually complete absence of human contact (¶’s 11,\n15, and 18), virtual elimination of all out of cell movements\n(¶’s 12, 14, 18), severe restrictions on showers and out of cell\nexercise (¶’s 16 and 19), severe restrictions on family visits\n(¶ 20), elimination of all jobs and other programming (¶ 14),\nsevere restrictions on religious services (¶ 21) and on a\nprisoner’s communication with attorneys (¶ 22). Property is\nsimilarly restricted (¶ 14). In sum, being confined to Tamms\nis to be subjected to virtual sensory deprivation, with\nprisoners forced to spend most days doing literally nothing\nbut staring at the four blank walls of their cells.\n     In Count Three of their amended complaint, plaintiffs\n     allege (¶ 120):\n        120. Transfer to Tamms subjects plaintiffs to atypi-\n        cal and significant hardships in relation to the\n\fNo. 03-3318                                                     37\n\n        ordinary incidents of prison life and to hardships\n        which are not experienced at the most restrictive\n        segregation unit at any of the maximum security\n        prisons in Illinois.\nAppellants’ Supplemental Br. at 3-4.\n  With respect to the other factors mentioned in Wikinson,\nthe prisoners note that, although prisoners at Tamms are\neligible for parole, there are strict limits on the good time\nthat they can earn because of the lack of rehabilitative\nprograms at the facility. With respect to the length of time\nthat a prisoner can be incarcerated at Tamms, the prisoners\nsimply point out that the only time limit is the length of the\nunderlying sentence.\n  With respect to the available procedures for contesting a\nplacement in Tamms, the prisoners point out the absence of\nany hearing for those in disciplinary status and the lack of\nnotice as to the reasons for the placement in the case of\nthose in administrative detention. They also note the lack of\nany pre-placement hearing for those in administrative\ndetention.\n  We believe that the allegations of the complaint, which we\nmust accept as true at this stage of the litigation, preclude\ndismissal under the now-governing standards of Wilkinson.\nThere are some differences between the features of the Ohio\nsupermax at issue in Wilkinson and those of the Illinois\nfacility at issue here. It is not at all clear, however, that those\ndifferences are so qualitatively different as to require a\ndifferent characterization of the facility for purposes of due\nprocess analysis under Wilkinson. Illinois’ contention that\nthe liberty interest identified in Wilkinson turned exclusively\non the absence of parole constitutes, our view, far too\ncrabbed a reading of the decision. The very text of the\ndecision belies such a claim in noting that, “[w]hile any of\n\f38                                                 No. 03-3318\n\nthese conditions standing alone might not be sufficient to\ncreate a liberty interest, taken together they impose an\natypical and significant hardship within the correctional\ncontext.” Wilkinson, 125 S. Ct. at 2395. We also note that, if,\nafter considering all the evidence submitted by the parties,\nthe district court is not of the view that the Illinois situation\nis, like the Ohio facility, “an atypical and significant hard-\nship under any plausible baseline,” id. at 2394, the district\ncourt must confront the issue of what does constitute the\nappropriate baseline for the Illinois system. See id.\n  Assuming that a liberty interest is determined to exist, the\ndistrict court will then have to confront whether the proce-\ndures that we have discussed at some length with respect to\nthe exhaustion of administrative remedies provide sufficient\nprocess to protect the prisoners’ liberty interest in this case.\nThe fact that the procedures available in Illinois are different\nfrom those employed in Ohio is, of course, in no way\noutcome determinative. The Supreme Court has made clear\nthat application of the Mathews test requires flexibility with\nrespect to the precise procedural devices employed. The\nCourt has made clear that the informal, nonadversarial\nprocedures set forth in Hewitt v. Helms, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110829\"><a href=\"/opinion/110829/hewitt-v-helms/\"><span class=\"volume\">459</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">460</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1983)\nand Greenholtz v.

See\nWilkinson, 125 S. Ct. at 2397.\n  On the basis of what we can ascertain on this record, it\nappears that the district court will have to evaluate with\nparticular care whether the prisoner is given sufficient\nnotice of the reasons for his transfer to afford meaningful\nopportunity to challenge his placement. With respect to\nprisoners in disciplinary status, there is the added question\nof whether the disciplinary hearing on the underlying\ndisciplinary violation is a sufficient vehicle by which to\nchallenge the Tamms placement. For those in administrative\n\fNo. 03-3318                                                  39\n\nstatus, the lack of any pre-transfer hearing may require close\nexamination. See Hewitt, 459 U.S. at 477. The district court\nalso must, of course, consider the matter of continued\nmonitoring of the situation after the initial transfer decision.\nSee id. at 477 n.9.\n  Finally, with respect to the viability of the grievance\nprocedure to contest a placement at Tamms, the district\ncourt must explore fully the allegation that IDOC’s conflict-\ning pronouncements on the use of this procedure to chal-\nlenge placement renders it useless.\n\n                         Conclusion\n  For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the\njudgment of the district court with respect to all claims but\nthe retaliation claim and the due process claim. With respect\nto these claims, the judgment of the district court is reversed\nand the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with\nthis opinion. The parties shall bear their own costs on this\nappeal.\n        AFFIRMED in part; REVERSED and REMANDED in part\n\nA true Copy:\n        Teste:\n\n                           _____________________________\n                            Clerk of the United States Court of\n                              Appeals for the Seventh Circuit\n\n\n\n\n                     USCA-02-C-0072—9-6-05\n\f</pre>",
