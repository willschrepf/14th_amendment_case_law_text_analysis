Reg. 46621, 46623 (Aug. 3, 2011).

For a compact and convincing summary of the benefits to\nsociety in general and women in particular of inexpensive\naccess to contraception, see Priests for Life v. U.S. Dept. of\nHealth & Human Services, 772 F.3d 229, 257–64 (D.C. Cir.\n2014).\n    The University of Notre Dame provides health benefits to\nboth its employees and its students. It self-insures its em-\nployees’ medical expenses, but has hired Meritain Health,\nInc. to administer the employee health plan without provid-\ning any insurance coverage; Meritain is therefore the third-\nparty administrator of the university’s employee health plan.\nTo take care of its students’ medical needs, Notre Dame has\na contract with Aetna, Inc., the well-known health care and\nhealth insurance company (and Meritain’s parent); the con-\n\f4                                                 No. 13-3853\n\n\ntract gives the students the option of obtaining health insur-\nance from Aetna at rates negotiated by Notre Dame. Mer-\nitain administers coverage for some 4600 employees of Notre\nDame (out of a total of 5200) and 6400 dependents of em-\nployees. Aetna insures 2600 students and 100 dependents;\nNotre Dame has about 11,000 students, most of whom have\ncoverage under either their parents’ health insurance poli-\ncies or under their own policies rather than under the Aetna\nNotre Dame Health Plan.\n    Because Catholic doctrine forbids the use of contracep-\ntives to prevent pregnancy (the “rhythm” method of avoid-\ning pregnancy, which is permitted, is a form of abstention,\nnot of contraception), Notre Dame has never paid for contra-\nceptives for its employees or permitted Aetna to insure stu-\ndents under the Aetna Notre Dame Health Plan (or any oth-\ner Aetna plan) for the expense of contraceptives. Cognizant\nof the religious objections of Catholic and a number of other\nreligious institutions to contraception, and mindful of the\ndictate of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, 42 U.S.C.\n§§ 2000bb-1(a), (b), that “Government shall not substantially\nburden a person’s exercise of religion even if the burden re-\nsults from a rule of general applicability,” unless “it demon-\nstrates that application of the burden to the person—(1) is in\nfurtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and (2) is\nthe least restrictive means of furthering that compelling gov-\nernmental interest,” some months after the enactment of the\nAffordable Care Act the government offered a religious ex-\nemption from the contraception guidelines. See “Group\nHealth Plans and Health Insurance Issuers Relating to Cov-\nerage of Preventive Services,” 76 Fed. Reg. 46621, 46626\n(Aug. 3, 2011) (codified at 45 C.F.R. § 147.130(a)(1)(iv)); see\nalso 77 Fed. Reg. 8725, 8727–29 (Feb. 15, 2012).\n\fNo. 13-3853                                                   5\n\n\n    At first the exemption was limited to churches and so ex-\ncluded religious institutions that are incorporated as non-\nprofit (rather than as religious) institutions, such as Notre\nDame. The exclusion precipitated the filing in 2012 of a fed-\neral suit by the university against the government, claiming\nthat the contraceptive regulations infringed rights conferred\non the university by both the First Amendment and the Reli-\ngious Freedom Restoration Act. That suit was dismissed on\nstanding and ripeness grounds, the government having\npromised that Notre Dame wouldn’t have to comply with\nthe regulations for one year, during which new regulations\nwould be issued. University of Notre Dame v. Sebelius, 2012\nWL 6756332, at *3–4 (N.D. Ind. Dec. 31, 2012); see “Certain\nPreventive Services Under the Affordable Care Act,” 77 Fed.\nReg. 16501, 16502–03 (Mar. 21, 2012). The new regulations\nwere issued as promised—and as expected they enlarged the\nexemption. See “Coverage of Certain Preventive Services\nUnder the Affordable Care Act,” 78 Fed. Reg. 39870, 39875–\n90 (July 2, 2013); 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(a); 45 C.F.R.\n§ 147.131(b). As a result, Notre Dame now came within its\nscope.\n    But to exercise its right conferred by the new regulations\nto opt out of having to pay for contraceptive coverage either\ndirectly (with or without the administrative assistance of a\nthird-party administrator, such as Meritain) or through a\nhealth insurer, such as Aetna, the university had to fill out\n“EBSA      Form      700—Certification.”     See   45   C.F.R.\n§ 147.131(b)(4). The form (www.dol.gov/ebsa/pdf/preventive\nserviceseligibleorganizationcertificationform.pdf) is short, its\nmeat the following sentence: “I certify that, on account of re-\nligious objections, the organization opposes providing cov-\nerage for some or all of any contraceptive services that\n\f6                                                    No. 13-3853\n\n\nwould otherwise be required to be covered; the organization\nis organized and operates as a nonprofit entity; and the or-\nganization holds itself out as a religious organization.” The\nform states that “the organization or its plan must provide a\ncopy of this certification to the plan’s health insurance issuer\n(for insured health plans) or a third party administrator (for\nself-insured health plans) in order for the plan to be accom-\nmodated with respect to the contraceptive coverage re-\nquirement.” So Notre Dame, if it decided to sign the exemp-\ntion form, would have to give copies to both Aetna and Mer-\nitain.\n    As noted at the outset of this opinion, the Affordable\nCare Act requires providers of health insurance (including\nthird-party administrators of self-insured health plans, even\nthough they are conduits rather than ultimate payors of plan\nbenefits) to provide contraceptive coverage for women. See\nalso 45 C.F.R. §§ 147.131(c)(2)(i)(B), (ii); 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-\n2713A(b)(3). The exemption form if signed by Notre Dame\nand sent to Aetna and Meritain would therefore inform them\nthat since Notre Dame was not going to pay for contracep-\ntive coverage of its students and staff, Aetna and Meritain\nwould have to pay. Aetna (including its Meritain subsidiary)\nhas neither religious nor financial objections to paying for\ncontraception. Regarding the cost to these companies, the\ngovernment will reimburse at least 110 percent of the third-\nparty administrator’s (Meritain’s) costs, 45 C.F.R.\n§ 156.50(d)(3), while Aetna can expect to recoup its costs of\ncontraceptive coverage from savings on pregnancy medical\ncare (since there will be fewer pregnancies if contraception is\nmore broadly available, at no cost, to Notre Dame’s female\nemployees and students) as well as from other regulatory\n\fNo. 13-3853                                                 7\n\n\noffsets. See “Coverage of Certain Preventive Services Under\nthe Affordable Care Act,” supra, 78 Fed. Reg. at 39877–78.\n    The regulations required Aetna and Meritain, if Notre\nDame signed and sent the exemption form—but not Notre\nDame—to inform the university’s female employees and\nstudents that those companies would be covering their con-\ntraceptive costs. See 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-2713A(d); 29 C.F.R.\n§ 2590.715-2713A(d). The companies could either “provide\npayments for contraceptive services” themselves or, alterna-\ntively, “arrange for an insurer or other entity to provide\npayments for” those services, but they could not “impos[e]\nany cost-sharing requirements (such as a copayment, coin-\nsurance, or a deductible), or impos[e] a premium, fee, or\nother charge, or any portion thereof, directly or indirectly,\non the eligible organization, the group health plan, or plan\nparticipants or beneficiaries.” 29 C.F.R. §§ 2590.715-\n2713A(b)(2), (c)(2).\n    The regulations thus sought an accommodation between\nthe secular interests that had motivated the requirement to\nprovide contraceptive services to women free of charge and\nthe interests of religious objectors. Accommodation is con-\nsistent with the balancing act required by the Religious\nFreedom Restoration Act, which as we noted requires con-\nsideration of “substantial burden” (on the institution unwill-\ning to provide contraceptive services), a “compelling gov-\nernmental interest” in that provision, and the “least restric-\ntive means” that is feasible for realizing the government’s\ninterest.\n   When the accommodation was promulgated in July of\n2013, Notre Dame did not at first bring a new suit (remem-\nber that its previous suit, brought when the university was\n\f8                                                  No. 13-3853\n\n\nexcluded from opting out of contraceptive coverage, had\nbeen dismissed on jurisdictional grounds, and those grounds\nwere irrelevant to a suit challenging the new regulations).\nNot until December 2013 did the university file the present\nsuit, challenging the accommodation. The delay in suing was\nawkward, since the regulations were to take effect with re-\nspect to the employee health plan—and did take effect—on\nJanuary 1, 2014. “Coverage of Certain Preventive Services\nUnder the Affordable Care Act,” supra, 78 Fed. Reg. at 39889.\n(The student health plan, provided by Aetna, had until Au-\ngust 2014 to comply. See id.; University of Notre Dame,\n2013–2014 Student Injury and Sickness Insurance Plan 3, 5,\nhttp://uhs.nd.edu/assets/108455/nd_brochure_1314.pdf.)\n    With the January deadline for compliance looming, the\nuniversity, less than a week after filing its second suit on De-\ncember 3, 2014, asked the district court to issue a preliminary\ninjunction that would prevent the government from enforc-\ning the regulation against it pending a trial. The district\njudge denied the motion on December 20, and Notre Dame\nfiled its appeal from that denial the same day. On December\n30 we denied the university’s emergency motion for an in-\njunction pending appeal. The next day—the last day before\nit would be penalized for violating the regulations—the uni-\nversity signed EBSA Form 700 and thereby opted out of\nproviding contraceptive coverage for its employees. On Jan-\nuary 28 it filed with us a second appeal from the denial of\nthe preliminary injunction that it had sought. Later it signed\nthe same form regarding Aetna.\n   The lawsuit had been only a few weeks old when Notre\nDame appealed, and so the district judge suspended all pro-\nceedings in his court pending our resolution of the appeal\n\fNo. 13-3853                                                    9\n\n\n(which as just noted had become two appeals). The parties\nhad thus had only a slender window in which to present ev-\nidence, and very little had been presented. Because of Notre\nDame’s focus on obtaining relief at the appellate level, there\nhas been no resumption of proceedings in the district court,\nand as a result there is very little evidence in the record be-\nfore us. That is one reason why, in a decision issued on Feb-\nruary 21, 2014, we declined (with one member of the panel\ndissenting) to reverse the district judge’s denial of the pre-\nliminary injunction sought by Notre Dame. University of\nNotre Dame v. Sebelius, 743 F.3d 547 (7th Cir. 2014). A few\nmonths later, in an almost identical case, the Sixth Circuit\nalso ruled in favor of the government, Michigan Catholic Con-\nference & Catholic Family Services v. Burwell, 755 F.3d 372 (6th\nCir. 2014), vacated and remanded, 2015 WL 1879768 (April\n27, 2015), and afterward was joined by the D.C. Circuit in\nPriests for Life v. U.S. Dept. of Health & Human Services, supra.\n    Notre Dame continued filing appellate petitions, the\nmost notable being a petition for certiorari, granted by the\nSupreme Court on March 9 of this year in an order (Universi-\nty of Notre Dame v. Burwell, 135 S. Ct. 1528) that states in its\nentirety: “On petition for writ of certiorari to the United\nStates Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. Petition for\nwrit of certiorari granted. Judgment vacated, and case re-\nmanded to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sev-\nenth Circuit for further consideration in light of Burwell v.\nHobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 573 U.S. ___, 134 S.Ct. 2751 (2014).”\nWith the case now back in this court, the parties filed posi-\ntion statements, after which we heard oral argument for an\nhour and fifty minutes. The discussion of issues that follows\nin this opinion is based on the position statements and oral\n\f10                                                No. 13-3853\n\n\nargument, on portions of our original opinion, and on the\nHobby Lobby decision.\n    Our previous opinion had expressed puzzlement about\nwhat exactly the university wanted us to enjoin. It had by\nthat time signed EBSA Form 700 and sent copies to Aetna\nand Meritain, thus obtaining the statutory accommodation,\nand the companies had notified Notre Dame’s employees\nand students that they (the companies, not the university)\nwould be providing contraceptive coverage. We now have\n(we think) a clearer idea of what the university wants. It\nwants us to enjoin the government from forbidding Notre\nDame to bar Aetna and Meritain from providing contracep-\ntive coverage to any of the university’s students or employ-\nees. Because of its contractual relations with the two compa-\nnies, which continue to provide health insurance coverage\nand administration for medical services apart from contra-\nception as a method of preventing pregnancy, Notre Dame\nclaims to be complicit in the sin of contraception. It wants to\ndissolve that complicity by forbidding Aetna and Meritain—\nwith both of which, to repeat, it continues to have contractu-\nal relations—to provide any contraceptive coverage to Notre\nDame students or staff. The result would be that the stu-\ndents and staff currently lacking coverage other than from\nAetna or Meritain would have to fend for themselves, seek-\ning contraceptive coverage elsewhere in the health insurance\nmarket.\n    Notre Dame does not forbid its students or staff to use\ncontraception or to obtain reimbursement from health insur-\nance companies for their purchase of contraceptives. Its ob-\njection that it asks us to ratify by issuing a preliminary in-\njunction is to Aetna’s and Meritain’s being legally obligated\n\fNo. 13-3853                                                   11\n\n\nto make contraceptive coverage available to Notre Dame\nstudents and staff. It regards its contractual relationship with\nthose companies as making the university a conduit between\nthe suppliers of the coverage and the university’s students\nand employees. In the university’s words, the contraception\nregulation imposes a substantial burden on it by forcing the\nuniversity to “identify[] and contract[] with a third party\nwilling to provide the very services Notre Dame deems ob-\njectionable.”\n    But the scanty record contains no evidence to support the\nconduit theory. Although Notre Dame is the final arbiter of\nits religious beliefs, it is for the courts to determine whether\nthe law actually forces Notre Dame to act in a way that\nwould violate those beliefs. As far as we can determine from\nthe very limited record, the only “conduit” is between the\ncompanies and Notre Dame students and staff; the universi-\nty has stepped aside. Thus it tells its students (and we as-\nsume its staff as well) that “the University of Notre Dame\nhonors the moral teachings of the Catholic Church. There-\nfore, for example, University Health Services may prescribe\ncontraceptive medications to treat approved medical condi-\ntions, but not to prevent pregnancy. To comply with federal\nlaw, Aetna Student Health provides coverage for additional\nwomen’s health products or procedures that the University\nobjects to based on its religious beliefs. This coverage is sepa-\nrate from Notre Dame. Students enrolled in Aetna Student\nHealth may call Aetna customer service at 877-378-9492 for\nmore information. Students not covered by Aetna Student\nHealth should check with their own insurance plans regard-\ning federally-mandated women’s health coverage.” Univer-\nsity of Notre Dame Health Services, “FAQ-Aetna Student\nHealth,” http://uhs.nd.edu/insurance-billing/faq-aetna-stude\n\f12                                                No. 13-3853\n\n\nnt-health-ans/ (emphasis added). There thus is no suggestion\nthat Notre Dame is involved at all in Aetna’s and Meritain’s\ncontraception coverage.\n   When the case was last before us, in 2014, the university’s\nlawyer had similarly argued that Notre Dame’s health plans\nwere the “conduit” through which the employees and stu-\ndents obtained contraceptive coverage, making Notre Dame\ncomplicit in sin. But the lawyer also had said that his client\nwould have no problem if each of its female employees\nsigned and mailed to Meritain (and its students mailed to\nAetna) a form saying “I have insurance through Notre\nDame, but the university won’t cover contraceptive services,\nso now you must cover them.” It’s difficult to see how that\nwould make the health plan any less of a “conduit” between\nNotre Dame and Aetna/Meritain.\n    It’s not even clear that by forcing Aetna/Meritain to pro-\nvide Notre Dame’s students and staff with contraception\ncoverage the government is forcing Notre Dame to do busi-\nness with an entity that is providing an objectionable service\nto the Notre Dame community. For the government author-\nizes a third-party administrator to “arrange for an issuer or\nother entity” to pay for contraception coverage and bill the\nexpense to the government. 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-\n2713A(b)(2)(ii). Notre Dame thus could ask Meritain to out-\nsource contraception coverage for both students and staff to\nan entity that does no business with Notre Dame. The uni-\nversity would have no contractual relationship with that en-\ntity and so would not be involved even indirectly in the pro-\nvision of contraceptive coverage to its students and employ-\nees.\n\fNo. 13-3853                                                  13\n\n\n    A further problem with Notre Dame’s quest for a prelim-\ninary injunction is the absence from the record of its con-\ntracts with Aetna and Meritain. We are not told what the du-\nration of the contracts is, whether or in what circumstances\nthey are terminable by Notre Dame before their expiration\ndate, or what the financial consequences to the companies\nmight be given that the federal government reimburses\nhealth insurers’ contraception payouts generously. So far as\ncontraception is concerned, health insurers are merely in-\ntermediaries between the federal government and the con-\nsumers. We are led in turn to wonder whether the govern-\nment—which rarely provides health services directly to pa-\ntients but rather uses health care companies to provide those\nservices as the government’s agents—might without offend-\ning Notre Dame’s religious scruples hire Aetna and Meritain\nto provide that coverage. That would be simpler and more\ndirect than the government’s shopping for other health in-\nsurance companies to be its agents in dealing with Notre\nDame’s students and staff.\n    It is irregular, moreover, for a court to be asked to enjoin\nnonparties. For all we know, Aetna and its subsidiary value\nthe opportunity to provide contraception coverage with\ngenerous reimbursement by the federal government. (The\nrecord, consistent with its sparseness, contains almost noth-\ning about Aetna or Meritain.) Their business is providing\nhealth care, health care administration, and health insurance,\nand Notre Dame wants unilaterally to exclude them from a\npossibly lucrative chunk of that business. When the universi-\nty, albeit under protest, signed and mailed the exemption\nform, Aetna and Meritain reasonably believed that they had\nan economic opportunity—that for the first time they would\nbe providing contraceptive coverage to the Notre Dame\n\f14                                                  No. 13-3853\n\n\ncommunity. (Remember that before the Affordable Care Act\nwas passed they provided no such coverage to the commu-\nnity.) They have had no opportunity to intervene in the dis-\ntrict court, where proceedings have been suspended pend-\ning Notre Dame’s appellate submissions culminating in this\ncase.\n    Notre Dame takes particular umbrage at the regulation\nunder the Affordable Care Act which states that “if the eligi-\nble organization provides a copy of the self-certification\n[EBSA Form 700] of its objection to administering or funding\nany contraceptive benefits … to a third party administrator\n[Meritain], the self-certification shall be an instrument under\nwhich the plan is operated, [and] shall be treated as a desig-\nnation of the third party administrator as the plan adminis-\ntrator under section 3(16) of ERISA for any contraceptive\nservices required to be covered under § 2590.715-\n2713(a)(1)(iv) of this chapter to which the eligible organiza-\ntion objects on religious grounds.” 29 C.F.R. § 2510.3-16(b).\n(What a mouthful!) Notre Dame treats this regulation as\nhaving made its mailing of the certification form to its third-\nparty administrator (Meritain) the cause of the provision of\ncontraceptive services to its employees in violation of its re-\nligious beliefs. That’s not correct. Since there is now a federal\nright, unquestioned by Notre Dame, to contraceptive ser-\nvices, the effect of the university’s exercise of its religious\nexemption is to throw the entire burden of administration on\nthe entities (Aetna and Meritain) that now provide contra-\nceptive coverage to Notre Dame’s students and staff. The\nuniversity is permitted to opt out of providing federally\nmandated contraceptive services, and the federal govern-\nment determines (enlists, drafts, conscripts) substitute pro-\nviders, and it is not surprising that they are the providers\n\fNo. 13-3853                                                 15\n\n\nwho already are providing health services to university stu-\ndents and staff.\n    The university argues that by conditioning its right not to\nprovide contraceptive coverage for its students and staff on\nits signing EBSA Form 700 and giving copies to Aetna and\nMeritain, the government has, in violation of RFRA, “sub-\nstantially burden[ed] a person’s exercise of religion” (the\nuniversity is a nonprofit corporate “person”; cf. 1 U.S.C. § 1;\nKorte v. Sebelius, 735 F.3d 654, 674 (7th Cir. 2013)), and that\nno “compelling governmental interest” justifies that burden-\ning. It notes that the Catholic concept of “scandal” forbids\nthe encouragement (equivalent to aiding and abetting) of\nsinful acts; a 2013 affidavit by Notre Dame’s executive vice-\npresident defines “‘scandal’ … in the theological context …\nas encouraging by words or example other persons to en-\ngage in wrongdoing.” Of course in invoking the exemption\nthe university also throws the entire administrative and fi-\nnancial burden of providing contraception on the health in-\nsurer and third-party administrator, which are secular or-\nganizations that unlike the university have no aversion to\nproviding contraceptive coverage. The result is to lift a bur-\nden from the university’s shoulders.\n    Alternatively Notre Dame charges that the government\nhas “coerce[d] [it] into serving as the crucial link between\ncontraceptive providers and recipients.” That’s a recursion\nto the “conduit” theory, and ignores that as a result of the\nuniversity’s signing the exemption form, students and staff\nnow deal directly with Aetna and Meritain, bypassing Notre\nDame. It is federal law, rather than the religious organiza-\ntion’s signing and mailing the form, that requires health-care\ninsurers, along with third-party administrators of self-\n\f16                                                No. 13-3853\n\n\ninsured health plans, to cover contraceptive services. By re-\nfusing to fill out the form Notre Dame would subject itself to\npenalties, but Aetna and Meritain would still be required to\nprovide the services to the university’s students and em-\nployees.\n    Notre Dame says no—that had it not filled out the form,\nMeritain wouldn’t have been authorized to provide contra-\nceptive services because it would have been a “plan admin-\nistrator” under section 3(16) of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. § 1002(16),\nand thus not a plan fiduciary entitled to make expenditures\n(as for contraception coverage) on behalf of the plan. The\nuniversity argues that it alone is authorized to designate a\nplan fiduciary, 29 U.S.C. § 1102(a)(2), and that it made that\ndesignation in the form that it mailed to the company and\nthus is complicit in the provision of contraceptives to the\nuniversity’s staff. This version of Notre Dame’s “triggering”\nargument does not apply to Aetna, which is the students’\nhealth insurer and so already a plan fiduciary, 29 U.S.C.\n§ 1002(21)(A), required therefore by the Affordable Care Act\nto provide contraceptive coverage to plan members whether\nor not Notre Dame signs the form. 45 C.F.R. §§ 147.\n130(a)(1)(iv), 147.131(f). Even as to Meritain, although “many\nagreements between third party administrators and plan\nsponsors prohibit third party administrators from serving as\nfiduciaries,” “Coverage of Certain Preventive Services Un-\nder the Affordable Care Act,” supra, 78 Fed. Reg. at 39879,\n“many” is not “all” or even “most.” Notre Dame has pre-\nsented no evidence that its contract with Meritain forbids the\nlatter to be a plan fiduciary (remember that the contract is\nnot in the record).\n\fNo. 13-3853                                                  17\n\n\n    Nor has the university been ordered to name Meritain as\na plan fiduciary. Rather, the signed form “shall be treated as a\ndesignation of the third party administrator as the plan ad-\nministrator under section 3(16) of ERISA for any contracep-\ntive services required to be covered.” 29 C.F.R. § 2510.3-16(b)\n(emphasis added). Treated and designated by whom? By the\ngovernment. The delivery of a copy of the form to Meritain\nreminds it of an obligation that the law, not the university,\nimposes on it—the obligation to pick up the ball if Notre\nDame decides, as is its right, to drop it. Notre Dame’s sign-\ning the form no more “triggers” Meritain’s obligation to\nprovide contraceptive services than a tortfeasor’s declaring\nbankruptcy “triggers” his co-tortfeasors’ joint and several\nliability for damages. Meritain must provide the services no\nmatter what; signing the form simply shifts the financial\nburden from the university to the government, as desired by\nthe university.\n    Suppose the United States, like the United Kingdom,\nCanada, and many other foreign nations, had a “single pay-\ner” health care system. In such a system, the government\npays the cost of specified medical services (if the United\nStates had such a system, it would be the equivalent of Med-\nicare for everyone), rather than employers, health insurers,\nand patients, though patients may be charged directly for\nsome of the expense of the medical care provided by the sys-\ntem, as distinct from indirectly through taxes. If our hypo-\nthetical single-payer system paid the full expense of female\ncontraceptives, Notre Dame couldn’t argue that the system\nplaced a “substantial burden” on the university’s compli-\nance with Catholic doctrine, for Notre Dame does not deny\nthe existence of the legitimate secular interests noted at the\noutset of this opinion that justify a federal program of pay-\n\f18                                                 No. 13-3853\n\n\ning for contraceptive expenses. (For a summary of those in-\nterests, see “Coverage of Certain Preventive Services Under\nthe Affordable Care Act,” supra, 78 Fed. Reg. at 39872–73.) It\neven advised the district court that to “achieve its asserted\ninterests without forcing Notre Dame to violate its religious\nbeliefs” the government could “directly provide contracep-\ntive[s]” to the university’s staff and students or, alternative-\nly, “directly offer insurance coverage for contraceptive ser-\nvices.” The consequence in either case would be a single-\npayer system for contraceptives. The main difference be-\ntween such a system and the Affordable Care Act is that un-\nder the Act the government, instead of providing medical\nservices directly, uses private insurance providers and\nhealth plan administrators as its agents to provide medical\nservices subsidized by the government.\n    If the government is entitled to require that female con-\ntraceptives be provided to women free of charge, it is un-\nclear how signing the form that declares Notre Dame’s au-\nthorized refusal to pay for contraceptives for its students or\nstaff, and its mailing the authorization document to those\ncompanies, which under federal law are obligated to pick up\nthe tab, could be thought to “trigger” the provision of con-\ntraceptive coverage.\n    But we must—we have been ordered by the Supreme\nCourt to—consider the bearing on our analysis of Burwell v.\nHobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 2751 (2014). The case (an-\nticipated by our decision in Korte v. Sebelius, supra) involved\nthree closely held for-profit corporations whose owners ob-\njected on religious grounds to having (by virtue of the con-\ntraception provisions of the Affordable Care Act and the\nregulations issued under it) to provide insurance coverage\n\fNo. 13-3853                                                  19\n\n\nfor their employees’ purchase of contraceptives that can de-\nstroy a fertilized ovum, such as “morning after” pills and\nintrauterine contraceptive devices (IUDs); the owners’ objec-\ntions were thus objections not to contraceptives as such but\nto what they considered to be abortifacients. The question\nwas whether RFRA should be interpreted to apply to nonre-\nligious institutions owned by persons having sincere reli-\ngious objections to their institutions’ having to comply with\nthe ACA’s contraceptive regulations. The Court held that it\nshould be so interpreted, and therefore the institutions\nwould be entitled to the “accommodation,” that is, to fill out\nform FSBA 700 and mail it to their health insurers: “HHS has\nalready established an accommodation for nonprofit organi-\nzations with religious objections. Under that accommoda-\ntion, the organization can self-certify that it opposes provid-\ning coverage for particular contraceptive services. If the or-\nganization makes such a certification, the organization’s in-\nsurance issuer or third-party administrator must ‘[e]xpressly\nexclude contraceptive coverage from the group health insur-\nance coverage provided in connection with the group health\nplan’ and ‘[p]rovide separate payments for any contracep-\ntive services required to be covered’ without imposing ‘any\ncost-sharing requirements … on the eligible organization,\nthe group health plan, or plan participants or beneficiaries.’”\n134 S. Ct. at 2782 (citations and cross-reference omitted). This\nof course is what Notre Dame did in our case; the companies\nin the Hobby Lobby case did it without protesting—which\nshows how different the two cases are. The companies in\nHobby Lobby requested the accommodation; Justice Kenne-\ndy, concurring in Hobby Lobby, described the accommodation\nas an “existing, recognized, workable, and already imple-\nmented framework to provide coverage” for employees of\n\f20                                                 No. 13-3853\n\n\n“an objecting employer.” 134 S. Ct. at 2786. Notre Dame, in\ncontrast, deems the accommodation a violation of its reli-\ngious rights.\n   The Supreme Court did leave open in Hobby Lobby the\npossibility that the accommodation sought and obtained\nthere would not prevent religious beliefs or practices from\nbeing substantially burdened in some cases. But it gave no\nexamples; perhaps it remanded our case for further consid-\neration of that possibility. We’ve suggested in this opinion\nthat Notre Dame could as an alternative to the official ac-\ncommodation direct Meritain to delegate to companies that\nhave no contractual relationship with Notre Dame (as Aetna\nand Meritain do) the provision of contraception coverage to\nthe university’s students and staff. Then Notre Dame would\nbe outside the loop.\n    Notre Dame does note possible alternatives, such as a\nsingle-payer system in which Notre Dame women would\napply directly to the government for reimbursement of their\ncosts of buying contraceptives. But at this stage in the litiga-\ntion, with no trial having been conducted, we have no basis\nfor concluding that any of the university’s proposed alterna-\ntives would avoid imposing an unreasonable cost either on\nthe government or on Notre Dame’s students and employ-\nees. The government, as we said, typically provides medical\nservices, including reimbursement of costs incurred by med-\nical providers, indirectly, through health insurance compa-\nnies such as Aetna. Does Notre Dame expect the government\nto establish a federal contraception agency to which Notre\nDame women should send the bills for the contraceptives\nthey buy? Alternatively, must every woman who wants re-\nimbursement of contraceptive costs pick a health insurance\n\fNo. 13-3853                                                  21\n\n\ncompany, maybe on the basis of a Google search, to contract\nwith? This seem to be what the university has in mind when\nit says in its position statement that it has no “objection to a\nsystem in which its employees or students coordinated with\nan independent insurer to provide coverage that ‘would not\ninvolve Notre Dame’” (emphasis in original). But because\nit’s a bother for a person to shop for the “best” contraceptive\ncoverage, the proposed solution would reduce the number\nof women with such coverage, compared to their being enti-\ntled to such coverage automatically by virtue of being Notre\nDame students or employees. See Brigitte C. Madrian &\nDennis F. Shea, “The Power of Suggestion: Inertia in 401(k)\nParticipation and Savings Behavior,” 116 Quarterly Journal of\nEconomics 1149 (2001), comparing employee participation in\nemployer-sponsored savings plans under “opt-in” and “opt-\nout” enrollment and finding that there is much greater par-\nticipation when one has to opt out in order to forgo it.\n    The Supreme Court pertinently observed in its Hobby\nLobby opinion that the official accommodation (the accom-\nmodation that Notre Dame wants to escape from) would not\nimpede “women’s receipt of benefits by requiring them to\ntake steps to learn about, and to sign up for, a new govern-\nment funded and administered health benefit.” 134 S. Ct. at\n2783. So far as we can tell from an undeveloped record, the\nalternatives suggested by Notre Dame would impede the\nreceipt of such benefits.\n    Notre Dame says in its position statement that the gov-\nernment has “many alternative ways of providing free con-\ntraceptive coverage without using the health plans of object-\ning religious non-profits as the conduit” (emphasis added).\nPut to one side the question in what sense students and staff\n\f22                                                      No. 13-3853\n\n\ndealing directly as they now do with Aetna and Meritain are\n“using” Notre Dame’s health plans—plans that exclude con-\ntraception coverage. Our present concern is that Notre Dame\nhas thus far failed to explain the “many alternative ways”\n(elsewhere it refers to “the myriad ways” or “any number of\nways” in which the government can provide free contracep-\ntive coverage to Notre Dame’s students and staff)—and it\nadmits that it (that is, Notre Dame) “opposes many of these\nalternatives on policy grounds.”\n   It lists the following “myriad ways”: The government\ncould\n     (i)     directly provide contraceptive services to the few indi-\n             viduals who do not receive it under their health plans;\n     (ii)    offer grants to entities that already provide contracep-\n             tive services at free or subsidized rates and/or work\n             with these entities to expand delivery of the services;\n     (iii)   directly offer insurance coverage for contraceptive ser-\n             vices;\n     (iv)    grant tax credits or deductions to women who pur-\n             chase contraceptive services; or\n     (v)     allow Notre Dame and other Catholic non-profit or-\n             ganizations to comply with the Mandate [what we are\n             calling the accommodation or official accommodation]\n             by providing coverage for methods of family planning\n             consistent with Catholic beliefs (i.e., Natural Family\n             Planning training and materials).\n    Number v is not contraception at all; iv elides all consid-\neration of the costs and complications of the administrative\nmachinery for providing tax incentives to consumers; op-\ntions i through iii similarly would involve cumbersome ad-\nministrative machinery and at the same time impose a bur-\n\fNo. 13-3853                                                   23\n\n\nden on Notre Dame’s female students and employees who\nwant to obtain contraceptives.\n   Nor does Notre Dame explain how a government pro-\ngram that directly or indirectly provided contraception cov-\nerage to Notre Dame employees—as Notre Dame suggests—\nwould avoid complicity in sin. Were Notre Dame to hire an\nunemployed person who, by virtue of becoming employed\nby Notre Dame, obtained contraception coverage for the first\ntime, would not the university be “triggering” the new em-\nployee’s access to contraception?\n     We point out, finally, that a religious institution does not\nhave to sign FSBA 700 in order to exempt itself from the re-\nquirement of providing contraceptive coverage to employees\nand (if the institution is a college or university) students. It\ncan in the alternative notify the Department of Health and\nHuman Services. That was the alternative chosen by another\ninstitution of higher learning that was unwilling to provide\ncontraceptive coverage or even sign the FSBA 700. In\nWheaton College v. Burwell, 134 S. Ct. 2806 (2014) (per curi-\nam), the Supreme Court said that “if the applicant informs\nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services in writing that\nit is a nonprofit organization that holds itself out as religious\nand has religious objections to providing coverage for con-\ntraceptive services, the respondents are enjoined from en-\nforcing against the applicant the challenged provisions of the\nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act and related regu-\nlations pending final disposition of appellate review. To\nmeet the condition for injunction pending appeal, the appli-\ncant need not use the form prescribed by the Government,\nEBSA Form 700, and need not send copies to health insur-\nance issuers or third-party administrators.” We assume that\n\f24                                                No. 13-3853\n\n\nNotre Dame could ask Aetna and Meritain to ignore its\nsubmission to them of the signed FSBA 700, and instead\ncould itself inform the Secretary of Health and Human Ser-\nvices of its desire to be exempt on religious grounds from\nproviding contraceptive coverage; undoubtedly the Secre-\ntary would agree.\n    Notre Dame tells us that it likewise objects to that alter-\nnative. But based on the sparse record before us, there is a\nstrong argument that given the government’s legitimate in-\nterest in the provision of contraceptive coverage to women\nwithout cost to them, notice to the government would strike\nthe proper balance between legitimate governmental and\nsincere religious interests. That was the accommodation\nsought and received by Wheaton College.\n     We are put in mind of Bowen v. Roy, 476 U.S. 693 (1986).\nRoy objected that any use of his daughter’s Social Security\nnumber would substantially burden his religious beliefs be-\ncause he believed that use of that unique identifier would\nharm her spirit. He wanted an accommodation that would\nrelieve him of the burden of providing the number in his\napplications for welfare and food stamps and prevent the\ngovernment from using the number in its internal admin-\nistration. The Supreme Court refused. It said that “Roy may\nno more prevail on his religious objection to the Govern-\nment’s use of a Social Security number for his daughter than\nhe could on a sincere religious objection to the size or color\nof the Government’s filing cabinets.” Id. at 700. The very\nword “accommodation” implies a balance of competing in-\nterests; and when we compare the burden on the govern-\nment or third parties of having to establish some entirely\nnew method of providing contraceptive coverage with the\n\fNo. 13-3853                                                    25\n\n\nburden on Notre Dame of simply notifying the government\nthat the ball is now in the government’s court, we cannot\nconclude that Notre Dame has yet established its right to the\ninjunctive relief that it is seeking before trial. The mandate to\ncover contraceptive care as part of any broad health insur-\nance package provided by employers (or in the case of edu-\ncational institutions, students as well) was intended to min-\nimize financial, administrative, and logistical obstacles to\nsuch coverage. See 78 Fed. Reg. 39888 (July 2, 2013), rejecting\nalternative proposals and explaining the importance of min-\nimizing costs and logistical and administrative obstacles to\ncontraceptive coverage; see also Priests for Life v. U.S. Dept. of\nHealth & Human Services, supra, 772 F.3d at 265. All of Notre\nDame’s suggested alternatives would impose significant fi-\nnancial, administrative, and logistical obstacles by requiring\nwomen to sign up for separate coverage either with a gov-\nernment agency or with another private insurer. Such obsta-\ncles were considered by the Supreme Court in Hobby Lobby\nin support of the same accommodation that Notre Dame re-\nfuses to accept.\n    We emphasize in closing the tentative character of the\nanalysis in this opinion. The record is insufficiently devel-\noped to enable us to rule definitively on Notre Dame’s\nclaims. The burden of establishing an entitlement to a pre-\nliminary injunction was of course on the university, not on\nthe government. The burden has not been carried. Chief\nJudge Simon’s denial of preliminary relief is therefore once\nagain\n                                                   AFFIRMED.\n\f26                                                  No. 13-3853\n\n\n\n    HAMILTON, Circuit Judge, concurring. I join Judge Posner’s\nopinion in full. Notre Dame is not entitled to preliminary in-\njunctive relief at this point. While the ultimate decision on\nthe merits of this case remains uncertain, equitable consider-\nations weigh against a grant of a preliminary injunction now.\nAn injunction would disrupt the status quo and temporarily\ncut off contraceptive coverage for hundreds or thousands of\nwomen.\n    What this case needs now is a trial on the merits where\nthe relevant factual issues can be explored in depth. The lim-\nited factual record before us was made in the district court\non an emergency basis in December 2013. That record was\nalso made without the participation of the intervenors, who\nwould be affected most directly by the injunction Notre\nDame seeks. Since that time, also, the legal and factual land-\nscapes shaping the issues have shifted a good deal.\n    Where the law is evolving rapidly and the facts are com-\nplex, the better course is usually full exploration of the evi-\ndence and thorough findings of fact by the district court, ra-\nther than reliance on sweeping legal doctrines and hypothe-\nsized or assumed facts. See Lalonde v. Textron, Inc., 369 F.3d 1,\n6 (1st Cir. 2004) (vacating in part dismissal of ERISA case\nchallenging actions of employee stock ownership plan and\nallowing for factual development where law was “neither\nmature nor uniform”); Doe v. Walker, 193 F.3d 42, 46 (1st Cir.\n1999) (Boudin, J.) (vacating dismissal on issue with “im-\nportant social and moral implications” where further factual\ndevelopment might make it unnecessary to decide hard case\nand in any event would be “likely to contribute to a more\nsensitive assessment of what the law ‘is’ (which, absent deci-\n\fNo. 13-3853                                                   27\n\nsive precedent, means what it ‘should be’)”); Nelson v.\nIPALCO Enterprises, Inc., 2005 WL 1924332, at *3 (S.D. Ind.\nAug. 11, 2005) (denying cross-motions for summary judg-\nment to allow further factual development where applicable\nlaw was “emerging, controversial, and highly fact-\nsensitive”). The district court is best suited for those respon-\nsibilities even where—and perhaps especially where—the\nappellate courts are still debating the applicable law.\n    For now, however, the Supreme Court has ordered us to\nreconsider our earlier interlocutory decision in light of Bur-\nwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 573 U.S. —, 134 S. Ct. 2751\n(2014). The accommodation for religious not-for-profits like\nNotre Dame played a pivotal role in Hobby Lobby, but not in\na way that helps Notre Dame in this case. Hobby Lobby\nStores is a for-profit corporation that was not eligible for this\naccommodation. The very existence of the accommodation\nfor religious not-for-profits, however, persuaded the Su-\npreme Court that the government could achieve its purpose\nof making contraceptives available to employees and their\nfamilies without infringing on Hobby Lobby’s religious be-\nliefs. 134 S. Ct. at 2782.\n    The Court’s conclusion focused on how the accommoda-\ntion allowed the employer to avoid paying for contraceptives\ncontrary to the owners’ religious beliefs while still making\nthem available to employees and their families in a conven-\nient and seamless way. In praising the accommodation, the\nCourt explained that the effect of the accommodation on\nemployees “would be precisely zero. Under that accommo-\ndation, these women would still be entitled to all FDA-\napproved contraceptives without cost sharing.” 134 S. Ct. at\n2760. Justice Kennedy’s concurring opinion embraced the\n\f28                                                 No. 13-3853\n\naccommodation as a fully satisfactory alternative for accom-\nplishing the government’s objectives without infringing on\nHobby Lobby’s religious beliefs. 134 S. Ct. at 2786–87 (Ken-\nnedy, J., concurring). He also made clear that neither he nor\nthe other Justices in the majority expected the government to\ncreate “a whole new program or burden on the Govern-\nment” to provide the accommodation needed by the for-\nprofit employer-plaintiffs. Id.\n    The accommodation for religious not-for-profits thus\nmade it fairly easy for the Hobby Lobby Court to find that a\nless restrictive and equally effective alternative was available\nto accomplish the government’s purposes, which the Court\nassumed were compelling. The Court’s solution was to ex-\ntend the accommodation to religious owners of closely held\nbusinesses.\n    What does Hobby Lobby teach us about this case? In de-\nciding Hobby Lobby, the Supreme Court was well aware of\npending lawsuits like this one, in which religious not-for-\nprofits have challenged the accommodation itself as violat-\ning their rights under the Religious Freedom Restoration\nAct. The majority opinion referred to this category of cases\nin footnote 9 and wrote later “We do not decide today\nwhether an approach of this type [i.e., the accommodation]\ncomplies with RFRA for purposes of all religious claims.”\n134 S. Ct. at 2782 & n.40.\n    Despite this inconclusive comment, it is useful to consid-\ner in turn the three principal issues under RFRA in light of\nthe Court’s remand order after Hobby Lobby. Those issues are:\n(1) “substantial burden” on the exercise of religion; (2) com-\npelling governmental interests; and (3) less restrictive alter-\nnatives.\n\fNo. 13-3853                                                   29\n\n    1. Substantial Burden: Notre Dame reads Hobby Lobby as\nresolving conclusively in its favor the issue whether the ac-\ncommodation substantially burdens its exercise of its reli-\ngion. In Hobby Lobby, the Court found that the Affordable\nCare Act’s requirements for contraceptive coverage by for-\nprofit employers substantially burdened the plaintiffs’ exer-\ncise of religion. The employers were required by law to con-\ntract and pay for contraceptive coverage to which the em-\nployers’ owners objected on sincere religious grounds. The\nalternatives to compliance would have imposed stiff finan-\ncial consequences, which the Court deemed a substantial\nburden. 134 S. Ct. at 2776–77. Notre Dame faces essentially\nthe same financial consequences if it refuses to certify its eli-\ngibility for the religious accommodation.\n    Notre Dame finds most helpful to its position the Hobby\nLobby rejection of the government’s argument that the role of\nthe employer in contracting and paying for contraceptive\ncoverage was too remote from an employee’s use of contra-\nceptives to impose a substantial burden on the exercise of\nreligion. Federal courts had no business addressing whether\nthe plaintiffs’ religious beliefs about their moral complicity\nwere reasonable. Id. at 2778. The Court explained:\n       This belief implicates a difficult and important\n       question of religion and moral philosophy,\n       namely, the circumstances under which it is\n       wrong for a person to perform an act that is in-\n       nocent in itself but that has the effect of ena-\n       bling or facilitating the commission of an im-\n       moral act by another. Arrogating the authority\n       to provide a binding national answer to this re-\n       ligious and philosophical question, HHS and\n\f30                                                  No. 13-3853\n\n       the principal dissent in effect tell the plaintiffs\n       that their beliefs are flawed. For good reason,\n       we have repeatedly refused to take such a step.\n134 S. Ct. at 2778 (footnote omitted).\n    The accommodation for religious not-for-profits accepts\nan employer’s religious beliefs and provides a mechanism to\nprovide coverage to employees and their families, while\nmaking sure that the employer need not contract, arrange,\npay, or refer for the health care it finds objectionable on reli-\ngious grounds. Notre Dame asserts, however, that the mere\nact of requesting the exemption substantially burdens its re-\nligious exercise because it still has an attenuated role in caus-\ning its employees and students to receive the objectionable\ncoverage. Citing Hobby Lobby, Notre Dame asserts that its\nopinion or belief is beyond the reach of a federal court, apart\nfrom questions of sincerity.\n    It is not obvious that the reasoning of Hobby Lobby on the\nsubstantial burden issue extends to this case. There are im-\nportant differences between the cases: Notre Dame challeng-\nes not the general rule but the accommodation itself, and it\nattempts to prevent the government from arranging for a\nsubstitute for the employer to pay for contraceptive care.\nNotre Dame also contends, in effect, that its religious belief\ncan substitute for legal analysis regarding the operation of\nfederal law.\n    Any student of United States history learns the central\nroles that religious faith and tolerance have played in the set-\ntlement of this land and in the founding of the British colo-\nnies and the modern States and the federal Republic. We\nhave a long tradition of governing in ways that accommo-\n\fNo. 13-3853                                                   31\n\ndate the free exercise of religion. Special treatment of reli-\ngious faith and practice abounds. From conscientious objec-\ntor status in the military draft to federal and state tax codes,\nfrom compulsory school attendance laws to school lunch\nmenus, from zoning law to employment law and even fish\nand wildlife rules, our governments at every level have long\nmade room for religious faith by allowing exceptions from\ngenerally applicable laws. Through such exceptions and ac-\ncommodations, we respect diverse faiths, and we govern\nwith reasonable compromises that avoid unnecessary fric-\ntion between law and faith.\n    As we pointed out in our first opinion in this case, the\nmost extraordinary feature of this lawsuit is Notre Dame’s\nclaim that the process of requesting the accommodation is\nitself a substantial burden on its religious exercise. Notre\nDame v. Sebelius, 743 F.3d 547, 557–58 (7th Cir. 2014). True,\nthere are rare cases in which courts have considered the pos-\nsibility that an accommodation process itself might be too\nprolonged, intrusive, ineffective, and/or otherwise burden-\nsome. See, e.g., Saints Constantine & Helen Greek Orthodox\nChurch, Inc. v. City of New Berlin, 396 F.3d 895 (7th Cir. 2005),\nand cases cited there dealing with land-use decisions, and\nUnited States v. Friday, 525 F.3d 938 (10th Cir. 2008), and cases\ncited there, dealing with processes for seeking permits to kill\nprotected wildlife for use in Native American religious prac-\ntices.\n    The accommodation in this case, however, poses no such\nburdens. To take advantage of the accommodation, so that\nNotre Dame can avoid contracting, paying, arranging, or re-\nferring for the objectionable contraceptive care, a university\nofficial must only fill out a simple form asserting that Notre\n\f32                                                No. 13-3853\n\nDame is a not-for-profit employer that objects on religious\ngrounds to the law’s contraceptive coverage requirements.\nThe official must then send the form to either the Depart-\nment of Health and Human Services or the insurer or third-\nparty administrator. Notre Dame has already done so, and it\nneed do nothing more.\n    As Judge Posner’s opinion explains, Bowen v. Roy, 476\nU.S. 693 (1986), weighs against Notre Dame’s claim of a sub-\nstantial burden here. Roy had objected on religious grounds\nto the government’s use of his daughter’s Social Security\nnumber to administer federal benefits for the family. The\nSupreme Court rejected the challenge, holding: “The Free\nExercise Clause simply cannot be understood to require the\nGovernment to conduct its own internal affairs in ways that\ncomport with the religious beliefs of particular citizens.” Id.\nat 699.\n    Notre Dame’s position is analogous. At this point, Notre\nDame has requested the accommodation and provided the\ngovernment with contact information for Aetna and Mer-\nitain. The government requires no further action from Notre\nDame. The government has informed Aetna and Meritain of\ntheir federal obligations to provide contraceptive coverage\nthat Notre Dame has been exempted from providing. The\ngovernment’s steps to have others substitute for Notre Dame\nare parallel to the internal procedures at issue in Roy.\n    Notre Dame disagrees, arguing that only it can answer\nwhat it says is the religious question of whether its religious\nexercise is substantially burdened by the government’s ac-\ntions. But the Court rejected precisely that argument when it\nwas advanced by Roy. “The Federal Government’s use of a\nSocial Security number for Little Bird of the Snow does not\n\fNo. 13-3853                                                  33\n\nitself in any degree impair Roy’s ‘freedom to believe, ex-\npress, and exercise’ his religion.” 476 U.S. at 700–01.\n    While the Court acknowledged that “Roy's religious\nviews may not accept this distinction between individual\nand governmental conduct,” id. at 701 n.6, the Court con-\ncluded that this was ultimately a legal question, not a reli-\ngious one: “It is clear, however, that the Free Exercise Clause,\nand the Constitution generally, recognize such a distinction;\nfor the adjudication of a constitutional claim, the Constitu-\ntion, rather than an individual’s religion, must supply the\nframe of reference.” Id. Under Roy, whether the government\nis causing a substantial burden on a person’s religious exer-\ncise is a question of federal law. Accord, Geneva College v.\nSecretary of the United States Dep’t of Health and Human Ser-\nvices, 778 F.3d 422, 436–38 (3rd Cir. 2015) (courts must con-\nsider substantial burden issue under RFRA); Priests for Life v.\nBurwell, 772 F.3d 229, 247–49 (D.C. Cir. 2014); Michigan Catho-\nlic Conference v. Burwell, 755 F.3d 372, 385–87 (6th Cir. 2014),\nremanded, 2015 WL 1879768 (April 27, 2015).\n    Notre Dame argues, however, that the consequence of its\ncertification and exemption imposes the substantial burden.\nThe consequence is that federal law then requires other enti-\nties (Meritain and Aetna) to step in as substitutes to provide\ncontraceptive coverage directly to Notre Dame employees\nand students, respectively, and to their families. Notre Dame\nobjects to this consequence on religious grounds and says it\ncould avoid this consequence only by incurring burdensome\nfinancial penalties.\n   The problem with this argument is that regardless of\nNotre Dame’s choice—to provide contraceptive coverage, to\ninvoke the accommodation for religious not-for-profits, or\n\f34                                                            No. 13-3853\n\neven not to provide any health insurance coverage at all—\nthose employees and students would receive contraceptive\ncoverage through some form of health insurance. As we and\nother circuits have pointed out, their coverage results from\nfederal law, not from Notre Dame’s actions.\n    This is an issue not of moral philosophy but of federal\nlaw. Federal courts are not required to treat Notre Dame’s\nerroneous legal interpretation as beyond their reach—even if\nthat interpretation is also a sincere and religious belief. Notre\nDame is not entitled to nullify the law’s benefits for others\nbased on this mistake of law, which is the foundation of its\nclaim of a substantial burden. 1\n    As in Roy, Notre Dame’s “religious views may not accept\nthis distinction.” 476 U.S. at 701 n.6. But the courts cannot\nsubstitute even the most sincere religious beliefs for legal\nanalysis. To do so would “afford an individual a right to dic-\ntate the conduct of the Government’s internal procedures,”\nwhich the Court has expressly rejected. Id. at 700.\n    A comparison to the military draft helps to illustrate the\nextraordinary nature of Notre Dame’s objection to the gov-\nernment’s accommodation and finding of substitutes for it.\nFederal law allows for exemption from military training and\nservice for any person “who, by reason of religious training\nand belief, is conscientiously opposed to participation in war\nin any form.” 50 App. U.S.C. § 456(j). (The process for claim-\ning conscientious objector status is far more demanding than\n\n\n     1 Accord, Geneva College, 778 F.3d at 437 (3rd Cir. 2015); Priests for\nLife, 772 F.3d at 252; Michigan Catholic Conference, 755 F.3d at 387; 78 Fed.\nReg. 39870, 39876 (July 2, 2013) (final rules explaining that obligations of\ninsurers and third-party administrators are imposed by federal law).\n\fNo. 13-3853                                                 35\n\nthe accommodation to which Notre Dame objects, but that’s\nnot my focus here.) Suppose a person’s religious faith leads\nhim to believe that it is wrong for people to engage in war.\nHe applies for conscientious objector status. The local draft\nboard grants him the exemption.\n    But suppose a board member then points out that be-\ncause the objector will not be drafted, someone else will be\ndrafted in his place. He objects again, asserting, much as\nNotre Dame does here, that if his exemption means someone\nelse must substitute for him to engage in wrongdoing, he\nwill be morally responsible for it and his religious exercise\nwill be substantially burdened. Citing RFRA, he therefore\ndemands that he be exempted without a substitute.\n    As we said in our prior opinion, that seems a “fantastic\nsuggestion.” Notre Dame, 743 F.3d at 556. Yet Notre Dame\nhas embraced that reasoning. It argues that national catas-\ntrophe could be avoided by treating the substitute draftee as\nthe least restrictive means to achieve a compelling govern-\nmental purpose. See Notre Dame Rule 54 Statement at 11\nn.4. This seems wrong in two fundamental ways.\n    First, for reasons explained above, the arrangements the\ngovernment makes to find substitutes for those given the\nbenefit of a religious exemption are imposed as a matter of\nfederal law, not as a result of the exemption itself. The party\nclaiming the exemption is not entitled to raise a religious ob-\njection to the arrangements the government makes for a sub-\nstitute. See Geneva College, 778 F.3d at 439 n.14 (making simi-\nlar point with example of employee who asks for time off to\naccommodate his religion, but who then objects to employ-\ner’s substitution for him). And not coincidentally, the gov-\nernment’s ability to find substitutes fits well with the Su-\n\f36                                                  No. 13-3853\n\npreme Court’s decision, just a few days after it decided Hob-\nby Lobby, in a RFRA case much more similar to this one. In\nWheaton College v. Burwell, 134 S. Ct. 2806 (2014), the Court\nissued an interim order allowing another religious college to\ninvoke the exemption by notifying the government rather\nthan its insurer. The Court pointed out: “Nothing in this or-\nder precludes the Government from relying on this notice, to\nthe extent it considers it necessary, to facilitate the provision\nof full contraceptive coverage under the Act.” Id. at 2807. In\nother words, the Court’s order allowed the government to\npass the notice on to the insurer so that the insurer could\ncomply with its obligations under federal law. That order left\nWheaton College essentially where Notre Dame is now.\n    Second, if even such mistaken and attenuated objections\nwere sufficient to invoke RFRA’s stringent least-restrictive-\nmeans test, fair governance where the law imposes burdens\non individuals would become nearly impossible. In the draft\ncontext, the conscientious objector could argue, much as\nNotre Dame does here, in favor of an all-volunteer military\nas a less restrictive means. Should arguments for such radi-\ncal restructuring of government programs be sufficient un-\nder RFRA? And in contexts not involving national security\nand defense, would government accommodations of religion\nthat require finding substitutes all have to satisfy compel-\nling-interest, least-restrictive-means scrutiny?\n   For these reasons, RFRA should not be understood to\nrecognize such mistaken views about substitutes as “sub-\nstantial burdens” on religious belief. Accord, Geneva College,\n778 F.3d at 438; Priests for Life, 772 F.3d at 251, 256; Michigan\nCatholic Conference, 755 F.3d at 388; see generally Bowen v.\nRoy, 476 U.S. at 699–700; Kaemmerling v. Lappin, 553 F.3d 669,\n\fNo. 13-3853                                                 37\n\n679–80 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (prisoner’s religious exercise not bur-\ndened by government’s analysis of DNA taken from his tis-\nsue sample).\n    2. Compelling Governmental Interest: Even if Notre Dame\ncan ultimately show a substantial burden on its religious be-\nlief, the next major issue under RFRA is whether imposing\nthe burden on Notre Dame furthers a “compelling govern-\nmental interest.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb–1. In the abbreviated\ndistrict court proceedings back in December 2013, the federal\ngovernment did not contest this issue because of our ruling\nin Korte v. Sebelius, 735 F.3d 654 (7th Cir. 2013), though the\ngovernment preserved its right to dispute the issue in the\nfuture.\n    Hobby Lobby now shows that the government has a strong\nargument on the compelling-interest issue. The Hobby Lobby\nmajority assumed that the burden on those plaintiffs would\nserve a compelling governmental interest. 134 S. Ct. at 2780.\nJustice Kennedy’s concurring opinion made clear that he\nviewed the governmental interests as compelling. Id. at 2786\n(“It is important to confirm that a premise of the Court’s\nopinion is its assumption that the HHS regulation here at\nissue furthers a legitimate and compelling interest in the\nhealth of female employees.”). And all four dissenting Jus-\ntices viewed the government interests as compelling. Id. at\n2799–2801 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting). The compelling inter-\nests include women’s health, the role that access to contra-\nception plays in enabling women to participate fully and\nequally in society, and significant cost savings. See 78 Fed.\nReg. 39870, 39873 & nn. 22, 23, & 24 (July 2, 2013) (final\nrules). The D.C. Circuit has explained in detail the factual\n\f38                                                No. 13-3853\n\nbases for the government’s compelling interests. See Priests\nfor Life, 772 F.3d at 257–64.\n    3. Least Restrictive Means: If the RFRA analysis proceeds\nto whether the accommodation for religious not-for-profits\nlike Notre Dame is the least restrictive means of furthering\nthe government’s interest, the question demands much more\nexploration than was possible in the emergency proceedings\nin the district court back in December 2013.\n    The general mandate to cover contraceptive care as part\nof any broad health insurance package provided by employ-\ners was intended to minimize financial, administrative, and\nlogistical obstacles to such coverage. 78 Fed. Reg. at 39888\n(rejecting alternative proposals and explaining importance of\navoiding incremental costs and minimizing logistical and\nadministrative obstacles for contraceptive coverage); Priests\nfor Life, 772 F.3d at 265. The accommodation for religious not-\nfor-profits has also been designed to minimize those obsta-\ncles.\n    Notre Dame’s suggested alternatives would all impose\nsignificant financial, administrative, and logistical obstacles\nby requiring women to sign up for separate coverage, either\nwith a government agency or another private insurer, and to\npay additional costs unless the government paid for the pro-\ngram. Such obstacles were specifically considered in Hobby\nLobby. In debating whether the accommodation would suf-\nfice for the for-profit employers, the majority and dissent\npaid close attention to cost and to administrative and logisti-\ncal obstacles. See 134 S. Ct. at 2782–83 (under the accommo-\ndation, plaintiffs’ employees would continue to receive con-\ntraceptive coverage without cost sharing and with “minimal\nlogistical and administrative obstacles”); id. at 2802 (Gins-\n\fNo. 13-3853                                                 39\n\nburg, J., dissenting) (new government program as substitute\nwould impose obstacles to effective coverage). Those con-\ncerns about effectiveness of alternatives seem to have sub-\nstantial merit. They deserve exploration in the district court.\n    The least-restrictive-means issue also presents a question\nof law for which the contours are not yet well-defined. The\nlegal question is in essence the scope of imagination permit-\nted in thinking of supposedly less restrictive means.\n    The heart of the Affordable Care Act was a decision to\napproach universal health insurance by expanding the em-\nployer-based system of private health insurance that had\nevolved in our country, rather than to substitute a new “sin-\ngle payer” government program to pay for health care, like\nthe systems in place in the United Kingdom and Canada. I\ndo not see support for Notre Dame’s view that a least-\nrestrictive-means analysis would need to consider such radi-\ncally different alternatives.\n     In fact, Justice Kennedy’s Hobby Lobby concurrence em-\nphasized that the accommodation for religious not-for-\nprofits was an “existing, recognized, workable, and already-\nimplemented framework to provide coverage” for employ-\nees with an objecting employer. 134 S. Ct. at 2786 (Kennedy,\nJ., concurring). In finding that the accommodation was a less\nrestrictive alternative, Justice Kennedy noted that “the Gov-\nernment has not met its burden of showing that it cannot ac-\ncommodate the plaintiffs’ similar religious objections under\nthis established framework.” Id. (emphasis added). He also\ncommented that accommodation was possible “without im-\nposition of a whole new program or burden on the Govern-\nment.” Id.\n\f40                                                  No. 13-3853\n\n    Consistent with those observations, I doubt that a hypo-\nthetical new single-payer program for contraceptives, which\nwould require separate registration or application, would be\nfor RFRA purposes a “less restrictive” means of achieving\nthe government’s interests. It also seems likely that such a\nprogram would impose the sort of logistical and administra-\ntive obstacles of such concern in Hobby Lobby.\n    Further fact-finding in the district court may cast the case\nin a different light, of course. But for all of these reasons, as\nwell as those explained in Judge Posner’s opinion, I continue\nto agree that Chief Judge Simon properly denied a prelimi-\nnary injunction in this case.\n\fNo. 13-3853                                                 41\n\n   FLAUM, Circuit Judge, dissenting.\n       By requiring health insurers to provide contraceptive\n   coverage, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act\n   (“ACA”) forces Notre Dame to act in ways it says violate\n   its religious beliefs. The resultant burden on Notre\n   Dame’s rights is substantial: because Notre Dame offers\n   health insurance to its students, and especially because it\n   acts as a self-insurer for its employees, the law turns\n   Notre Dame into a conduit for the provision of cost-free\n   contraception. It also compels Notre Dame to contract\n   with parties—Meritain and Aetna—in a manner in which\n   Notre Dame believes makes it complicit in moral wrong.\n   Notre Dame’s only alternative is to endure crippling\n   fines.\n       In light of the Supreme Court’s ruling in Burwell v.\n   Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 2751 (2014)—the deci-\n   sion the Court cited in asking us to reconsider this case—\n   Notre Dame has articulated a substantial burden for\n   purposes of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act\n   (“RFRA”), 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb et seq. As a result, strict\n   scrutiny governs our consideration of Notre Dame’s chal-\n   lenge here, and the government has the burden of\n   demonstrating that the challenged accommodation is the\n   least restrictive means of serving a compelling interest. In\n   my view, the government has not satisfied that charge.\n   Accordingly, I respectfully dissent, concluding that Notre\n   Dame is entitled to a preliminary injunction pending the\n   district court’s decision of this case on the merits.\n                           *      *      *\n\f42                                                 No. 13-3853\n\n         The Catholic Church—like all religious employers—is\n     exempt from the ACA’s contraceptive mandate. See Hobby\n     Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2763. The U.S. Department of Health\n     & Human Services excluded churches and religious or-\n     ders from its edict, permitting them to offer employee\n     health insurance that does not include coverage for con-\n     traception. Notre Dame seeks that same treatment, be-\n     cause it has the same religious objections to rendering\n     available contraceptive health coverage for those it em-\n     ploys (and those that attend its school, in Notre Dame’s\n     case). At present, Notre Dame—as a nonprofit religious\n     organization that opposes providing contraceptive cov-\n     erage—may avail itself of what has become commonly\n     referred to as “the accommodation,” see e.g., 45 C.F.R.\n     § 147.131(b), the effects of which Notre Dame says also\n     violate its religious beliefs.\n         Notre Dame has two distinct roles as far as health in-\n     surance is concerned. With respect to its employees,\n     Notre Dame acts as a self-insurer (hiring Meritain as the\n     third-party administrator of its insurance plan). For its\n     students, Notre Dame acts as an insurance broker (nego-\n     tiating on their behalf to offer them an insurance plan\n     through insurer Aetna). When Notre Dame invoked the\n     accommodation, its relationship with both Meritain and\n     Aetna changed because of the ACA. Meritain, its third-\n     party administrator, became both authorized and re-\n     quired to offer contraceptive coverage to Notre Dame’s\n     employees. See Wheaton Coll. v. Burwell, 134 S. Ct. 2806,\n     2814 n.6 (2014) (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (noting that a\n     religious university’s “third-party administrator bears the\n     legal obligation to provide contraceptive coverage only\n     upon receipt of a valid self-certification” (emphasis add-\n\fNo. 13-3853                                                   43\n\n   ed)). Aetna, as the insurer for the student plans, became\n   obligated to segregate premium payments from Notre\n   Dame’s students and to provide them with contraceptive\n   coverage at Aetna’s expense, separate and apart from the\n   insurance plan offered by the school. See Hobby Lobby, 134\n   S. Ct. at 2763 (“When a group-health-insurance issuer re-\n   ceives notice that one of its clients has invoked this provi-\n   sion, the issuer must then exclude contraceptive coverage\n   from the employer’s plan and provide separate payments\n   for contraceptive services for plan participants without\n   imposing any cost-sharing requirements on the eligible\n   organization, its insurance plan, or its employees benefi-\n   ciaries.”(citing 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(c)).\n       While Notre Dame is no longer obligated to pay for\n   contraceptive services for its employees, it’s apparent to\n   me that, at a minimum, the ACA thrusts Notre Dame into\n   a facilitator’s role that, Notre Dame says, violates its reli-\n   gious beliefs by forcing it to serve as a continuing link be-\n   tween Meritain and the contraceptive services it provides\n   to Notre Dame’s employees.\n       With regard to the student health plan, there seems to\n   be outstanding disagreement over whether Notre Dame’s\n   invocation of the accommodation “triggers” Aetna’s obli-\n   gation to cover student contraception. See Wheaton Coll.,\n   134 S. Ct. at 2807 (majority opinion) (“The Government\n   contends that the applicant’s health insurance issuer …\n   [is] required by federal law to provide full contraceptive\n   coverage regardless [of] whether the applicant” invokes\n   the accommodation, while Wheaton College “contends,\n   by contrast, that the obligations of its health insurance is-\n   suer ... are dependent on their receipt of notice that the\n\f44                                                No. 13-3853\n\n     applicant objects to the contraceptive coverage require-\n     ment.”). But see 42 U.S.C. § 300gg–13(a) (“A group health\n     plan and a health insurance issuer offering group or in-\n     dividual health insurance coverage shall, at a minimum\n     provide coverage for and shall not impose any cost shar-\n     ing requirements for— … (4) with respect to women,\n     such additional preventive care and screenings … as\n     provided for in comprehensive guidelines supported by\n     the Health Resources and Services Administration … .”).\n     But that question really is of no moment here, because\n     Notre Dame also believes that being driven into an ongo-\n     ing contractual relationship with an insurer—especially\n     one that Notre Dame chose—that provides its students\n     with contraception compels it to act in contravention of\n     its beliefs.\n        In Notre Dame’s view, the ACA alters its relationships\n     with both Meritain and Aetna in a way that renders\n     Notre Dame morally complicit in the provision of contra-\n     ception. Put simply, Notre Dame is too engaged in a pro-\n     cess—the very premise of which offends its religion—\n     that the church itself is exempted from entirely.\n         The majority appears to minimize the significance of\n     Notre Dame’s position by focusing on its continued ob-\n     jection to the mandate in the face of a proffered accom-\n     modation. I believe that any inquiry into the rationality\n     of that position is precluded by the Supreme Court’s de-\n     cision in Hobby Lobby, which in my view underscores the\n     legitimacy of Notre Dame’s religious objection. There, as\n     here, HHS’s main argument was “basically that the con-\n     nection between what the objecting parties must do …\n     and the end that they find to be morally wrong … [was]\n\fNo. 13-3853                                                           45\n\n   simply too attenuated.” 134 S. Ct. at 2777. However, the\n   Supreme Court made clear that this position, at least in\n   this narrow context, is untenable. That’s because it\n   “dodges the question that RFRA presents (whether the\n   HHS mandate imposes a substantial burden on the abil-\n   ity of the objecting parties to conduct business in accord-\n   ance with their religious beliefs) and instead addresses a\n   very different question that the federal courts have no\n   business addressing (whether the religious belief asserted\n   in a RFRA case is reasonable).” Id. at 2778 (emphasis in\n   original).\n        Like the plaintiffs’ challenge in Hobby Lobby, Notre\n   Dame’s deeply held religious beliefs about contraception\n   and the formation and prevention of human life “impli-\n   cate[] a difficult and important question of religion and\n   moral philosophy, namely, the circumstances under\n   which it is wrong for a person to perform an act that is\n   innocent in itself but that has the effect of enabling or fa-\n   cilitating the commission of an immoral act by another.”\n   Id. Notre Dame is no doubt differently situated than the\n   Hobby Lobby plaintiffs, who had to directly provide con-\n   traceptive insurance. Nevertheless, the ACA also places\n   Notre Dame in a position that contravenes its belief sys-\n   tem. Yet the majority here sides with HHS, and “in effect\n   tell[s] the plaintiff[] that [its] beliefs are flawed.” 1 Id. The\n\n   1 To the extent the majority views Notre Dame’s burden as less sub-\n   stantial than the burden imposed on the plaintiffs in Hobby Lobby\n   (and thus not actionable under RFRA) because Notre Dame is fur-\n   ther removed from the direct provision of contraception, I suggest\n   that analysis is flawed. Hobby Lobby instructs that, once we determine\n   a religious belief is burdened, substantiality is measured by the se-\n\f46                                                          No. 13-3853\n\n     Hobby Lobby Court, however, rejected that position. See id.\n     (“Repeatedly and in many different contexts, we have\n     warned that courts must not presume to determine … the\n     plausibility of a religious claim.” (quoting Emp’t Div.,\n     Dep’t of Human Res. of Or. v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 887\n     (1990))). And so do I.\n        For that reason, the Hobby Lobby Court had “little\n     trouble concluding” that “the HHS contraceptive man-\n     date ‘substantially burden[ed]’ the exercise of religion” in\n     view of the plaintiffs’ asserted beliefs. 2 Id. at 2775. The\n     Court thus proceeded to the compelling interest compo-\n     nent of the RFRA test. See id. at 2779 (“Since the HHS con-\n\n                                                                      –––\n     verity of the penalties for non-compliance. 134 S. Ct. at 2759, 2775–\n     76. Because the contraceptive mandate forced the Hobby Lobby plain-\n     tiffs “to pay an enormous sum of money ... if they insist[ed] on\n     providing insurance coverage in accordance with their religious be-\n     liefs, the mandate clearly impose[d] a substantial burden on those\n     beliefs.” Id. at 2779. Here, Notre Dame faces the same penalties the\n     Hobby Lobby plaintiffs faced: $100 per day for each affected individu-\n     al. 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-22(b)(2)(C). “These sums are surely substan-\n     tial.” Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2776.\n     2 I would be remiss not to note that just one week after the Supreme\n     Court issued its opinion in Hobby Lobby, Wheaton College—which,\n     on the basis of our first (and now vacated) decision in this case was\n     denied a preliminary injunction in its own Seventh Circuit suit chal-\n     lenging the contraceptive mandate’s accommodation provision—\n     sought and was granted emergency relief by the Supreme Court.\n     Wheaton Coll., 134 S. Ct. at 2807. In granting the preliminary injunc-\n     tion, the Court necessarily found (at least for preliminary injunctive\n     purposes) that the accommodation substantially burdened Wheaton\n     College. Notre Dame challenges that same (though slightly revised)\n     accommodation.\n\fNo. 13-3853                                                  47\n\n   traceptive mandate imposes a substantial burden on the\n   exercise of religion, we must move on and decide wheth-\n   er HHS has shown that the mandate both ‘(1) is in fur-\n   therance of a compelling governmental interest; and (2) is\n   the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling\n   governmental interest.’ 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb–1(b).”). In\n   Hobby Lobby, “HHS assert[ed] that the contraceptive\n   mandate serves a variety of important interests, but\n   many of these [were] couched in very broad terms, such\n   as promoting ‘public health’ and ‘gender equality.’” Id.\n   HHS asserted those same interests to the district court in\n   this case. See Defs.’ Resp. in Opp’n to Pl.’s Mot. for Pre-\n   lim. Inj. at 15–16, Notre Dame v. Sebelius, 988 F. Supp. 2d\n   912 (N.D. Ind. 2013) (No. 3:13-cv-01276) (“[E]ven if the\n   challenged regulations were deemed to impose a sub-\n   stantial burden on plaintiff’s religious exercise, the regu-\n   lations satisfy strict scrutiny because they are narrowly\n   tailored to serve compelling government interests in pub-\n   lic health and gender inequality.” (emphases added)). The\n   Supreme Court, however, rejected the simple assertion of\n   such broad interests.\n       “RFRA … contemplates a ‘more focused’ inquiry: It\n   ‘requires the Government to demonstrate that the com-\n   pelling interest test is satisfied through application of the\n   challenged law ‘to the person’—the particular claimant\n   whose sincere exercise of religion is being substantially\n   burdened.’” Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2779 (quoting Gon-\n   zales v. O Centro Espírita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal, 546\n   U.S. 418, 430–31 (2006)). “This requires us to ‘loo[k] be-\n   yond broadly formulated interests’ and to ‘scrutiniz[e]\n   the asserted harm of granting specific exemptions to par-\n   ticular religious claimants … .’” Id. (quoting O Centro, 546\n\f48                                                   No. 13-3853\n\n     U.S. at 431). Nevertheless, the Court found it unnecessary\n     to delve into the “features of [the] ACA that support [the]\n     view” that the government lacks a compelling interest\n     here (such as the fact that “many employees—those cov-\n     ered by grandfathered plans and those who work for\n     employers with fewer than 50 employees—may have no\n     contraceptive coverage without cost sharing at all”), be-\n     cause—even assuming that the government’s interest is a\n     compelling one—HHS failed to demonstrate “that the\n     contraceptive mandate is ‘the least restrictive means of\n     furthering’” it. Id. at 2780 (citing § 2000bb–1(b)(2)).\n         As the Court noted, “[t]he least-restrictive-means\n     standard is exceptionally demanding,” and it is the gov-\n     ernment’s burden to demonstrate that “it lacks other\n     means of achieving its desired goal without imposing a\n     substantial burden on the exercise of religion by the ob-\n     jecting part[y].” Id. Here again, the majority in our case\n     sets aside Hobby Lobby, instead assigning Notre Dame\n     this burden because it seeks a preliminary injunction. But\n     Hobby Lobby, too, sought a preliminary injunction. Hob-\n     by Lobby Stores Inc. v. Sebelius, 723 F.3d 1114, 1143 (10th\n     Cir. 2013) (“[E]ven at the preliminary injunction stage,\n     RFRA requires the government to demonstrate that man-\n     dating a plaintiff’s compliance with the contraceptive-\n     coverage requirement is ‘the least restrictive means of\n     advancing a compelling interest.’” (emphasis in original)\n     (citing O Centro, 546 U.S. at 423)), aff’d, 134 S. Ct. 2751.\n     And the law in our own circuit is clear on this point. See\n     Korte v. Sebelius, 735 F.3d 654, 673 (7th Cir. 2013) (noting,\n     in the preliminary injunction context, that “[o]nce a\n     RFRA claimant makes a prima facie case that the applica-\n     tion of a law or regulation substantially burdens his reli-\n\fNo. 13-3853                                                  49\n\n   gious practice, the burden shifts to the government to jus-\n   tify the burden under strict scrutiny”). Indeed, the gov-\n   ernment—in this very case—conceded in its brief to the\n   district court that Korte dictates the issuance of a prelimi-\n   nary injunction if the court finds a substantial burden on\n   Notre Dame’s religious beliefs. See Defs.’ Resp. in Opp’n\n   to Pl.’s Mot. for Prelim. Inj., supra, at 15–16 (“Defendants\n   recognize that a majority of the Seventh Circuit rejected\n   these arguments [that the regulations satisfy strict scruti-\n   ny because they are narrowly tailored to serve compel-\n   ling governmental interests in public health and gender\n   equality] in Korte, and that this Court is bound by that\n   decision.”). In Korte, we granted the preliminary injunc-\n   tion because the government had made minimal efforts\n   “to explain how the contraception mandate is the least\n   restrictive means of furthering its stated goals of promot-\n   ing public health and gender equality.” 735 F.3d at 687.\n   Korte, of course, was our iteration of Hobby Lobby, and it\n   remains the law of this circuit—yet it appears not to in-\n   struct the majority.\n       The majority observes that Notre Dame has presented\n   “possible alternatives” to the accommodation that would\n   not infringe its religious exercise. Yet it concludes that\n   Notre Dame has failed to present an adequate proposal\n   for how the government can efficiently (and convenient-\n   ly) implement and administer an alternative program.\n   But to reiterate, Hobby Lobby expressly informs—\n   consistent with Korte—that it is the government’s, not\n   Notre Dame’s, burden to establish that the accommoda-\n   tion is the least restrictive means of advancing a compel-\n   ling government interest. Moreover, the suggestion by\n   the majority that any alternative method of advancing\n\f50                                                 No. 13-3853\n\n     the government’s interests would likely be too costly or\n     cumbersome to the government turns a blind eye to the\n     Supreme Court’s latest teachings. What matters under\n     RFRA is whether the means by which the government is\n     attempting to advance its compelling interest is the least\n     burdensome on Notre Dame’s religious beliefs. Accord-\n     ingly, RFRA may require the government to start over\n     and “creat[e] … entirely new programs,” and it “may in\n     some circumstances require the Government to expend\n     additional funds to accommodate citizens’ religious be-\n     liefs.” Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2781. For those reasons,\n     the Supreme Court made clear that, in this sphere, “[t]he\n     most straightforward way” of serving the Government’s\n     interests would be for it to assume the cost of providing\n     contraception “to any women who are unable to obtain\n     them under their health-insurance policies due to their\n     employers’ religious objections.” Id. at 2780. Here, as in\n     Hobby Lobby, “HHS has not shown … that this is not a vi-\n     able alternative.” Id. For that reason, I would reverse the\n     decision of the district court denying Notre Dame a pre-\n     liminary injunction.\n\f",

Cir.\n2014).\n    The University of Notre Dame provides health benefits to\nboth its employees and its students. It self-insures its em-\nployees’ medical expenses, but has hired Meritain Health,\nInc. to administer the employee health plan without provid-\ning any insurance coverage; Meritain is therefore the third-\nparty administrator of the university’s employee health plan.\nTo take care of its students’ medical needs, Notre Dame has\na contract with Aetna, Inc., the well-known health care and\nhealth insurance company (and Meritain’s parent); the con-\n\f4                                                 No. 13-3853\n\n\ntract gives the students the option of obtaining health insur-\nance from Aetna at rates negotiated by Notre Dame. Mer-\nitain administers coverage for some 4600 employees of Notre\nDame (out of a total of 5200) and 6400 dependents of em-\nployees. Aetna insures 2600 students and 100 dependents;\nNotre Dame has about 11,000 students, most of whom have\ncoverage under either their parents’ health insurance poli-\ncies or under their own policies rather than under the Aetna\nNotre Dame Health Plan.\n    Because Catholic doctrine forbids the use of contracep-\ntives to prevent pregnancy (the “rhythm” method of avoid-\ning pregnancy, which is permitted, is a form of abstention,\nnot of contraception), Notre Dame has never paid for contra-\nceptives for its employees or permitted Aetna to insure stu-\ndents under the Aetna Notre Dame Health Plan (or any oth-\ner Aetna plan) for the expense of contraceptives. Cognizant\nof the religious objections of Catholic and a number of other\nreligious institutions to contraception, and mindful of the\ndictate of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, 42 U.S.C.\n§§ 2000bb-1(a), (b), that “Government shall not substantially\nburden a person’s exercise of religion even if the burden re-\nsults from a rule of general applicability,” unless “it demon-\nstrates that application of the burden to the person—(1) is in\nfurtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and (2) is\nthe least restrictive means of furthering that compelling gov-\nernmental interest,” some months after the enactment of the\nAffordable Care Act the government offered a religious ex-\nemption from the contraception guidelines. See “Group\nHealth Plans and Health Insurance Issuers Relating to Cov-\nerage of Preventive Services,” 76 Fed. Reg. 46621, 46626\n(Aug. 3, 2011) (codified at 45 C.F.R. § 147.130(a)(1)(iv)); see\nalso 77 Fed.

The exclusion precipitated the filing in 2012 of a fed-\neral suit by the university against the government, claiming\nthat the contraceptive regulations infringed rights conferred\non the university by both the First Amendment and the Reli-\ngious Freedom Restoration Act. That suit was dismissed on\nstanding and ripeness grounds, the government having\npromised that Notre Dame wouldn’t have to comply with\nthe regulations for one year, during which new regulations\nwould be issued. University of Notre Dame v. Sebelius, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">6756332</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *3–4 (N.D. Ind. Dec. 31, 2012); see “Certain\nPreventive Services Under the Affordable Care Act,” 77 Fed.\nReg. 16501, 16502–03 (Mar. 21, 2012). The new regulations\nwere issued as promised—and as expected they enlarged the\nexemption. See “Coverage of Certain Preventive Services\nUnder the Affordable Care Act,” 78 Fed. Reg. 39870, 39875–\n90 (July 2, 2013); 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(a); 45 C.F.R.\n§ 147.131(b). As a result, Notre Dame now came within its\nscope.\n    But to exercise its right conferred by the new regulations\nto opt out of having to pay for contraceptive coverage either\ndirectly (with or without the administrative assistance of a\nthird-party administrator, such as Meritain) or through a\nhealth insurer, such as Aetna, the university had to fill out\n“EBSA      Form      700—Certification.”     See   45   C.F.R.\n§ 147.131(b)(4). The form (www.dol.gov/ebsa/pdf/preventive\nserviceseligibleorganizationcertificationform.pdf) is short, its\nmeat the following sentence: “I certify that, on account of re-\nligious objections, the organization opposes providing cov-\nerage for some or all of any contraceptive services that\n\f6                                                    No. 13-3853\n\n\nwould otherwise be required to be covered; the organization\nis organized and operates as a nonprofit entity; and the or-\nganization holds itself out as a religious organization.” The\nform states that “the organization or its plan must provide a\ncopy of this certification to the plan’s health insurance issuer\n(for insured health plans) or a third party administrator (for\nself-insured health plans) in order for the plan to be accom-\nmodated with respect to the contraceptive coverage re-\nquirement.” So Notre Dame, if it decided to sign the exemp-\ntion form, would have to give copies to both Aetna and Mer-\nitain.\n    As noted at the outset of this opinion, the Affordable\nCare Act requires providers of health insurance (including\nthird-party administrators of self-insured health plans, even\nthough they are conduits rather than ultimate payors of plan\nbenefits) to provide contraceptive coverage for women. See\nalso 45 C.F.R. §§ 147.131(c)(2)(i)(B), (ii); 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-\n2713A(b)(3). The exemption form if signed by Notre Dame\nand sent to Aetna and Meritain would therefore inform them\nthat since Notre Dame was not going to pay for contracep-\ntive coverage of its students and staff, Aetna and Meritain\nwould have to pay. Aetna (including its Meritain subsidiary)\nhas neither religious nor financial objections to paying for\ncontraception. Regarding the cost to these companies, the\ngovernment will reimburse at least 110 percent of the third-\nparty administrator’s (Meritain’s) costs, 45 C.F.R.\n§ 156.50(d)(3), while Aetna can expect to recoup its costs of\ncontraceptive coverage from savings on pregnancy medical\ncare (since there will be fewer pregnancies if contraception is\nmore broadly available, at no cost, to Notre Dame’s female\nemployees and students) as well as from other regulatory\n\fNo. 13-3853                                                 7\n\n\noffsets. See “Coverage of Certain Preventive Services Under\nthe Affordable Care Act,” supra, 78 Fed. Reg. at 39877–78.\n    The regulations required Aetna and Meritain, if Notre\nDame signed and sent the exemption form—but not Notre\nDame—to inform the university’s female employees and\nstudents that those companies would be covering their con-\ntraceptive costs. See 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-2713A(d); 29 C.F.R.\n§ 2590.715-2713A(d). The companies could either “provide\npayments for contraceptive services” themselves or, alterna-\ntively, “arrange for an insurer or other entity to provide\npayments for” those services, but they could not “impos[e]\nany cost-sharing requirements (such as a copayment, coin-\nsurance, or a deductible), or impos[e] a premium, fee, or\nother charge, or any portion thereof, directly or indirectly,\non the eligible organization, the group health plan, or plan\nparticipants or beneficiaries.” 29 C.F.R. §§ 2590.715-\n2713A(b)(2), (c)(2).\n    The regulations thus sought an accommodation between\nthe secular interests that had motivated the requirement to\nprovide contraceptive services to women free of charge and\nthe interests of religious objectors. Accommodation is con-\nsistent with the balancing act required by the Religious\nFreedom Restoration Act, which as we noted requires con-\nsideration of “substantial burden” (on the institution unwill-\ning to provide contraceptive services), a “compelling gov-\nernmental interest” in that provision, and the “least restric-\ntive means” that is feasible for realizing the government’s\ninterest.\n   When the accommodation was promulgated in July of\n2013, Notre Dame did not at first bring a new suit (remem-\nber that its previous suit, brought when the university was\n\f8                                                  No. 13-3853\n\n\nexcluded from opting out of contraceptive coverage, had\nbeen dismissed on jurisdictional grounds, and those grounds\nwere irrelevant to a suit challenging the new regulations).\nNot until December 2013 did the university file the present\nsuit, challenging the accommodation. The delay in suing was\nawkward, since the regulations were to take effect with re-\nspect to the employee health plan—and did take effect—on\nJanuary 1, 2014. “Coverage of Certain Preventive Services\nUnder the Affordable Care Act,” supra, 78 Fed. Reg. at 39889.\n(The student health plan, provided by Aetna, had until Au-\ngust 2014 to comply. See id.; University of Notre Dame,\n2013–2014 Student Injury and Sickness Insurance Plan 3, 5,\nhttp://uhs.nd.edu/assets/108455/nd_brochure_1314.pdf.)\n    With the January deadline for compliance looming, the\nuniversity, less than a week after filing its second suit on De-\ncember 3, 2014, asked the district court to issue a preliminary\ninjunction that would prevent the government from enforc-\ning the regulation against it pending a trial. The district\njudge denied the motion on December 20, and Notre Dame\nfiled its appeal from that denial the same day. On December\n30 we denied the university’s emergency motion for an in-\njunction pending appeal. The next day—the last day before\nit would be penalized for violating the regulations—the uni-\nversity signed EBSA Form 700 and thereby opted out of\nproviding contraceptive coverage for its employees. On Jan-\nuary 28 it filed with us a second appeal from the denial of\nthe preliminary injunction that it had sought. Later it signed\nthe same form regarding Aetna.\n   The lawsuit had been only a few weeks old when Notre\nDame appealed, and so the district judge suspended all pro-\nceedings in his court pending our resolution of the appeal\n\fNo. 13-3853                                                    9\n\n\n(which as just noted had become two appeals). The parties\nhad thus had only a slender window in which to present ev-\nidence, and very little had been presented. Because of Notre\nDame’s focus on obtaining relief at the appellate level, there\nhas been no resumption of proceedings in the district court,\nand as a result there is very little evidence in the record be-\nfore us. That is one reason why, in a decision issued on Feb-\nruary 21, 2014, we declined (with one member of the panel\ndissenting) to reverse the district judge’s denial of the pre-\nliminary injunction sought by Notre Dame.

The discussion of issues that follows\nin this opinion is based on the position statements and oral\n\f10                                                No. 13-3853\n\n\nargument, on portions of our original opinion, and on the\nHobby Lobby decision.\n    Our previous opinion had expressed puzzlement about\nwhat exactly the university wanted us to enjoin. It had by\nthat time signed EBSA Form 700 and sent copies to Aetna\nand Meritain, thus obtaining the statutory accommodation,\nand the companies had notified Notre Dame’s employees\nand students that they (the companies, not the university)\nwould be providing contraceptive coverage. We now have\n(we think) a clearer idea of what the university wants. It\nwants us to enjoin the government from forbidding Notre\nDame to bar Aetna and Meritain from providing contracep-\ntive coverage to any of the university’s students or employ-\nees. Because of its contractual relations with the two compa-\nnies, which continue to provide health insurance coverage\nand administration for medical services apart from contra-\nception as a method of preventing pregnancy, Notre Dame\nclaims to be complicit in the sin of contraception. It wants to\ndissolve that complicity by forbidding Aetna and Meritain—\nwith both of which, to repeat, it continues to have contractu-\nal relations—to provide any contraceptive coverage to Notre\nDame students or staff. The result would be that the stu-\ndents and staff currently lacking coverage other than from\nAetna or Meritain would have to fend for themselves, seek-\ning contraceptive coverage elsewhere in the health insurance\nmarket.\n    Notre Dame does not forbid its students or staff to use\ncontraception or to obtain reimbursement from health insur-\nance companies for their purchase of contraceptives. Its ob-\njection that it asks us to ratify by issuing a preliminary in-\njunction is to Aetna’s and Meritain’s being legally obligated\n\fNo. 13-3853                                                   11\n\n\nto make contraceptive coverage available to Notre Dame\nstudents and staff. It regards its contractual relationship with\nthose companies as making the university a conduit between\nthe suppliers of the coverage and the university’s students\nand employees. In the university’s words, the contraception\nregulation imposes a substantial burden on it by forcing the\nuniversity to “identify[] and contract[] with a third party\nwilling to provide the very services Notre Dame deems ob-\njectionable.”\n    But the scanty record contains no evidence to support the\nconduit theory. Although Notre Dame is the final arbiter of\nits religious beliefs, it is for the courts to determine whether\nthe law actually forces Notre Dame to act in a way that\nwould violate those beliefs. As far as we can determine from\nthe very limited record, the only “conduit” is between the\ncompanies and Notre Dame students and staff; the universi-\nty has stepped aside. Thus it tells its students (and we as-\nsume its staff as well) that “the University of Notre Dame\nhonors the moral teachings of the Catholic Church. There-\nfore, for example, University Health Services may prescribe\ncontraceptive medications to treat approved medical condi-\ntions, but not to prevent pregnancy. To comply with federal\nlaw, Aetna Student Health provides coverage for additional\nwomen’s health products or procedures that the University\nobjects to based on its religious beliefs. This coverage is sepa-\nrate from Notre Dame. Students enrolled in Aetna Student\nHealth may call Aetna customer service at 877-378-9492 for\nmore information. Students not covered by Aetna Student\nHealth should check with their own insurance plans regard-\ning federally-mandated women’s health coverage.” Univer-\nsity of Notre Dame Health Services, “FAQ-Aetna Student\nHealth,” http://uhs.nd.edu/insurance-billing/faq-aetna-stude\n\f12                                                No. 13-3853\n\n\nnt-health-ans/ (emphasis added). There thus is no suggestion\nthat Notre Dame is involved at all in Aetna’s and Meritain’s\ncontraception coverage.\n   When the case was last before us, in 2014, the university’s\nlawyer had similarly argued that Notre Dame’s health plans\nwere the “conduit” through which the employees and stu-\ndents obtained contraceptive coverage, making Notre Dame\ncomplicit in sin. But the lawyer also had said that his client\nwould have no problem if each of its female employees\nsigned and mailed to Meritain (and its students mailed to\nAetna) a form saying “I have insurance through Notre\nDame, but the university won’t cover contraceptive services,\nso now you must cover them.” It’s difficult to see how that\nwould make the health plan any less of a “conduit” between\nNotre Dame and Aetna/Meritain.\n    It’s not even clear that by forcing Aetna/Meritain to pro-\nvide Notre Dame’s students and staff with contraception\ncoverage the government is forcing Notre Dame to do busi-\nness with an entity that is providing an objectionable service\nto the Notre Dame community. For the government author-\nizes a third-party administrator to “arrange for an issuer or\nother entity” to pay for contraception coverage and bill the\nexpense to the government. 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-\n2713A(b)(2)(ii). Notre Dame thus could ask Meritain to out-\nsource contraception coverage for both students and staff to\nan entity that does no business with Notre Dame. The uni-\nversity would have no contractual relationship with that en-\ntity and so would not be involved even indirectly in the pro-\nvision of contraceptive coverage to its students and employ-\nees.\n\fNo. 13-3853                                                  13\n\n\n    A further problem with Notre Dame’s quest for a prelim-\ninary injunction is the absence from the record of its con-\ntracts with Aetna and Meritain. We are not told what the du-\nration of the contracts is, whether or in what circumstances\nthey are terminable by Notre Dame before their expiration\ndate, or what the financial consequences to the companies\nmight be given that the federal government reimburses\nhealth insurers’ contraception payouts generously. So far as\ncontraception is concerned, health insurers are merely in-\ntermediaries between the federal government and the con-\nsumers. We are led in turn to wonder whether the govern-\nment—which rarely provides health services directly to pa-\ntients but rather uses health care companies to provide those\nservices as the government’s agents—might without offend-\ning Notre Dame’s religious scruples hire Aetna and Meritain\nto provide that coverage. That would be simpler and more\ndirect than the government’s shopping for other health in-\nsurance companies to be its agents in dealing with Notre\nDame’s students and staff.\n    It is irregular, moreover, for a court to be asked to enjoin\nnonparties. For all we know, Aetna and its subsidiary value\nthe opportunity to provide contraception coverage with\ngenerous reimbursement by the federal government. (The\nrecord, consistent with its sparseness, contains almost noth-\ning about Aetna or Meritain.) Their business is providing\nhealth care, health care administration, and health insurance,\nand Notre Dame wants unilaterally to exclude them from a\npossibly lucrative chunk of that business. When the universi-\nty, albeit under protest, signed and mailed the exemption\nform, Aetna and Meritain reasonably believed that they had\nan economic opportunity—that for the first time they would\nbe providing contraceptive coverage to the Notre Dame\n\f14                                                  No. 13-3853\n\n\ncommunity. (Remember that before the Affordable Care Act\nwas passed they provided no such coverage to the commu-\nnity.) They have had no opportunity to intervene in the dis-\ntrict court, where proceedings have been suspended pend-\ning Notre Dame’s appellate submissions culminating in this\ncase.\n    Notre Dame takes particular umbrage at the regulation\nunder the Affordable Care Act which states that “if the eligi-\nble organization provides a copy of the self-certification\n[EBSA Form 700] of its objection to administering or funding\nany contraceptive benefits … to a third party administrator\n[Meritain], the self-certification shall be an instrument under\nwhich the plan is operated, [and] shall be treated as a desig-\nnation of the third party administrator as the plan adminis-\ntrator under section 3(16) of ERISA for any contraceptive\nservices required to be covered under § 2590.715-\n2713(a)(1)(iv) of this chapter to which the eligible organiza-\ntion objects on religious grounds.” 29 C.F.R. § 2510.3-16(b).\n(What a mouthful!) Notre Dame treats this regulation as\nhaving made its mailing of the certification form to its third-\nparty administrator (Meritain) the cause of the provision of\ncontraceptive services to its employees in violation of its re-\nligious beliefs. That’s not correct. Since there is now a federal\nright, unquestioned by Notre Dame, to contraceptive ser-\nvices, the effect of the university’s exercise of its religious\nexemption is to throw the entire burden of administration on\nthe entities (Aetna and Meritain) that now provide contra-\nceptive coverage to Notre Dame’s students and staff. The\nuniversity is permitted to opt out of providing federally\nmandated contraceptive services, and the federal govern-\nment determines (enlists, drafts, conscripts) substitute pro-\nviders, and it is not surprising that they are the providers\n\fNo. 13-3853                                                 15\n\n\nwho already are providing health services to university stu-\ndents and staff.\n    The university argues that by conditioning its right not to\nprovide contraceptive coverage for its students and staff on\nits signing EBSA Form 700 and giving copies to Aetna and\nMeritain, the government has, in violation of RFRA, “sub-\nstantially burden[ed] a person’s exercise of religion” (the\nuniversity is a nonprofit corporate “person”; cf. 1 U.S.C. § 1;\nKorte v. Sebelius, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">735</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">654</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 674 (7th Cir. 2013)), and that\nno “compelling governmental interest” justifies that burden-\ning. It notes that the Catholic concept of “scandal” forbids\nthe encouragement (equivalent to aiding and abetting) of\nsinful acts; a 2013 affidavit by Notre Dame’s executive vice-\npresident defines “‘scandal’ … in the theological context …\nas encouraging by words or example other persons to en-\ngage in wrongdoing.” Of course in invoking the exemption\nthe university also throws the entire administrative and fi-\nnancial burden of providing contraception on the health in-\nsurer and third-party administrator, which are secular or-\nganizations that unlike the university have no aversion to\nproviding contraceptive coverage. The result is to lift a bur-\nden from the university’s shoulders.\n    Alternatively Notre Dame charges that the government\nhas “coerce[d] [it] into serving as the crucial link between\ncontraceptive providers and recipients.” That’s a recursion\nto the “conduit” theory, and ignores that as a result of the\nuniversity’s signing the exemption form, students and staff\nnow deal directly with Aetna and Meritain, bypassing Notre\nDame. It is federal law, rather than the religious organiza-\ntion’s signing and mailing the form, that requires health-care\ninsurers, along with third-party administrators of self-\n\f16                                                No. 13-3853\n\n\ninsured health plans, to cover contraceptive services. By re-\nfusing to fill out the form Notre Dame would subject itself to\npenalties, but Aetna and Meritain would still be required to\nprovide the services to the university’s students and em-\nployees.\n    Notre Dame says no—that had it not filled out the form,\nMeritain wouldn’t have been authorized to provide contra-\nceptive services because it would have been a “plan admin-\nistrator” under section 3(16) of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. § 1002(16),\nand thus not a plan fiduciary entitled to make expenditures\n(as for contraception coverage) on behalf of the plan. The\nuniversity argues that it alone is authorized to designate a\nplan fiduciary, 29 U.S.C. § 1102(a)(2), and that it made that\ndesignation in the form that it mailed to the company and\nthus is complicit in the provision of contraceptives to the\nuniversity’s staff. This version of Notre Dame’s “triggering”\nargument does not apply to Aetna, which is the students’\nhealth insurer and so already a plan fiduciary, 29 U.S.C.\n§ 1002(21)(A), required therefore by the Affordable Care Act\nto provide contraceptive coverage to plan members whether\nor not Notre Dame signs the form. 45 C.F.R. §§ 147.\n130(a)(1)(iv), 147.131(f). Even as to Meritain, although “many\nagreements between third party administrators and plan\nsponsors prohibit third party administrators from serving as\nfiduciaries,” “Coverage of Certain Preventive Services Un-\nder the Affordable Care Act,” supra, 78 Fed. Reg. at 39879,\n“many” is not “all” or even “most.” Notre Dame has pre-\nsented no evidence that its contract with Meritain forbids the\nlatter to be a plan fiduciary (remember that the contract is\nnot in the record).\n\fNo. 13-3853                                                  17\n\n\n    Nor has the university been ordered to name Meritain as\na plan fiduciary. Rather, the signed form “shall be treated as a\ndesignation of the third party administrator as the plan ad-\nministrator under section 3(16) of ERISA for any contracep-\ntive services required to be covered.” 29 C.F.R. § 2510.3-16(b)\n(emphasis added). Treated and designated by whom? By the\ngovernment. The delivery of a copy of the form to Meritain\nreminds it of an obligation that the law, not the university,\nimposes on it—the obligation to pick up the ball if Notre\nDame decides, as is its right, to drop it. Notre Dame’s sign-\ning the form no more “triggers” Meritain’s obligation to\nprovide contraceptive services than a tortfeasor’s declaring\nbankruptcy “triggers” his co-tortfeasors’ joint and several\nliability for damages. Meritain must provide the services no\nmatter what; signing the form simply shifts the financial\nburden from the university to the government, as desired by\nthe university.\n    Suppose the United States, like the United Kingdom,\nCanada, and many other foreign nations, had a “single pay-\ner” health care system. In such a system, the government\npays the cost of specified medical services (if the United\nStates had such a system, it would be the equivalent of Med-\nicare for everyone), rather than employers, health insurers,\nand patients, though patients may be charged directly for\nsome of the expense of the medical care provided by the sys-\ntem, as distinct from indirectly through taxes. If our hypo-\nthetical single-payer system paid the full expense of female\ncontraceptives, Notre Dame couldn’t argue that the system\nplaced a “substantial burden” on the university’s compli-\nance with Catholic doctrine, for Notre Dame does not deny\nthe existence of the legitimate secular interests noted at the\noutset of this opinion that justify a federal program of pay-\n\f18                                                 No. 13-3853\n\n\ning for contraceptive expenses. (For a summary of those in-\nterests, see “Coverage of Certain Preventive Services Under\nthe Affordable Care Act,” supra, 78 Fed. Reg. at 39872–73.) It\neven advised the district court that to “achieve its asserted\ninterests without forcing Notre Dame to violate its religious\nbeliefs” the government could “directly provide contracep-\ntive[s]” to the university’s staff and students or, alternative-\nly, “directly offer insurance coverage for contraceptive ser-\nvices.” The consequence in either case would be a single-\npayer system for contraceptives. The main difference be-\ntween such a system and the Affordable Care Act is that un-\nder the Act the government, instead of providing medical\nservices directly, uses private insurance providers and\nhealth plan administrators as its agents to provide medical\nservices subsidized by the government.\n    If the government is entitled to require that female con-\ntraceptives be provided to women free of charge, it is un-\nclear how signing the form that declares Notre Dame’s au-\nthorized refusal to pay for contraceptives for its students or\nstaff, and its mailing the authorization document to those\ncompanies, which under federal law are obligated to pick up\nthe tab, could be thought to “trigger” the provision of con-\ntraceptive coverage.\n    But we must—we have been ordered by the Supreme\nCourt to—consider the bearing on our analysis of Burwell v.\nHobby Lobby Stores, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2681317\"><a href=\"/opinion/2681317/burwell-v-hobby-lobby-stores-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2751</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2014). The case (an-\nticipated by our decision in Korte v. Sebelius, supra) involved\nthree closely held for-profit corporations whose owners ob-\njected on religious grounds to having (by virtue of the con-\ntraception provisions of the Affordable Care Act and the\nregulations issued under it) to provide insurance coverage\n\fNo. 13-3853                                                  19\n\n\nfor their employees’ purchase of contraceptives that can de-\nstroy a fertilized ovum, such as “morning after” pills and\nintrauterine contraceptive devices (IUDs); the owners’ objec-\ntions were thus objections not to contraceptives as such but\nto what they considered to be abortifacients. The question\nwas whether RFRA should be interpreted to apply to nonre-\nligious institutions owned by persons having sincere reli-\ngious objections to their institutions’ having to comply with\nthe ACA’s contraceptive regulations. The Court held that it\nshould be so interpreted, and therefore the institutions\nwould be entitled to the “accommodation,” that is, to fill out\nform FSBA 700 and mail it to their health insurers: “HHS has\nalready established an accommodation for nonprofit organi-\nzations with religious objections. Under that accommoda-\ntion, the organization can self-certify that it opposes provid-\ning coverage for particular contraceptive services. If the or-\nganization makes such a certification, the organization’s in-\nsurance issuer or third-party administrator must ‘[e]xpressly\nexclude contraceptive coverage from the group health insur-\nance coverage provided in connection with the group health\nplan’ and ‘[p]rovide separate payments for any contracep-\ntive services required to be covered’ without imposing ‘any\ncost-sharing requirements … on the eligible organization,\nthe group health plan, or plan participants or beneficiaries.’”\n134 S. Ct. at 2782 (citations and cross-reference omitted). This\nof course is what Notre Dame did in our case; the companies\nin the Hobby Lobby case did it without protesting—which\nshows how different the two cases are. The companies in\nHobby Lobby requested the accommodation; Justice Kenne-\ndy, concurring in Hobby Lobby, described the accommodation\nas an “existing, recognized, workable, and already imple-\nmented framework to provide coverage” for employees of\n\f20                                                 No. 13-3853\n\n\n“an objecting employer.” 134 S. Ct. at 2786. Notre Dame, in\ncontrast, deems the accommodation a violation of its reli-\ngious rights.\n   The Supreme Court did leave open in Hobby Lobby the\npossibility that the accommodation sought and obtained\nthere would not prevent religious beliefs or practices from\nbeing substantially burdened in some cases. But it gave no\nexamples; perhaps it remanded our case for further consid-\neration of that possibility. We’ve suggested in this opinion\nthat Notre Dame could as an alternative to the official ac-\ncommodation direct Meritain to delegate to companies that\nhave no contractual relationship with Notre Dame (as Aetna\nand Meritain do) the provision of contraception coverage to\nthe university’s students and staff. Then Notre Dame would\nbe outside the loop.\n    Notre Dame does note possible alternatives, such as a\nsingle-payer system in which Notre Dame women would\napply directly to the government for reimbursement of their\ncosts of buying contraceptives. But at this stage in the litiga-\ntion, with no trial having been conducted, we have no basis\nfor concluding that any of the university’s proposed alterna-\ntives would avoid imposing an unreasonable cost either on\nthe government or on Notre Dame’s students and employ-\nees. The government, as we said, typically provides medical\nservices, including reimbursement of costs incurred by med-\nical providers, indirectly, through health insurance compa-\nnies such as Aetna. Does Notre Dame expect the government\nto establish a federal contraception agency to which Notre\nDame women should send the bills for the contraceptives\nthey buy? Alternatively, must every woman who wants re-\nimbursement of contraceptive costs pick a health insurance\n\fNo. 13-3853                                                  21\n\n\ncompany, maybe on the basis of a Google search, to contract\nwith? This seem to be what the university has in mind when\nit says in its position statement that it has no “objection to a\nsystem in which its employees or students coordinated with\nan independent insurer to provide coverage that ‘would not\ninvolve Notre Dame’” (emphasis in original). But because\nit’s a bother for a person to shop for the “best” contraceptive\ncoverage, the proposed solution would reduce the number\nof women with such coverage, compared to their being enti-\ntled to such coverage automatically by virtue of being Notre\nDame students or employees. See Brigitte C. Madrian &\nDennis F. Shea, “The Power of Suggestion: Inertia in 401(k)\nParticipation and Savings Behavior,” 116 Quarterly Journal of\nEconomics 1149 (2001), comparing employee participation in\nemployer-sponsored savings plans under “opt-in” and “opt-\nout” enrollment and finding that there is much greater par-\nticipation when one has to opt out in order to forgo it.\n    The Supreme Court pertinently observed in its Hobby\nLobby opinion that the official accommodation (the accom-\nmodation that Notre Dame wants to escape from) would not\nimpede “women’s receipt of benefits by requiring them to\ntake steps to learn about, and to sign up for, a new govern-\nment funded and administered health benefit.” 134 S. Ct. at\n2783. So far as we can tell from an undeveloped record, the\nalternatives suggested by Notre Dame would impede the\nreceipt of such benefits.\n    Notre Dame says in its position statement that the gov-\nernment has “many alternative ways of providing free con-\ntraceptive coverage without using the health plans of object-\ning religious non-profits as the conduit” (emphasis added).\nPut to one side the question in what sense students and staff\n\f22                                                      No. 13-3853\n\n\ndealing directly as they now do with Aetna and Meritain are\n“using” Notre Dame’s health plans—plans that exclude con-\ntraception coverage. Our present concern is that Notre Dame\nhas thus far failed to explain the “many alternative ways”\n(elsewhere it refers to “the myriad ways” or “any number of\nways” in which the government can provide free contracep-\ntive coverage to Notre Dame’s students and staff)—and it\nadmits that it (that is, Notre Dame) “opposes many of these\nalternatives on policy grounds.”\n   It lists the following “myriad ways”: The government\ncould\n     (i)     directly provide contraceptive services to the few indi-\n             viduals who do not receive it under their health plans;\n     (ii)    offer grants to entities that already provide contracep-\n             tive services at free or subsidized rates and/or work\n             with these entities to expand delivery of the services;\n     (iii)   directly offer insurance coverage for contraceptive ser-\n             vices;\n     (iv)    grant tax credits or deductions to women who pur-\n             chase contraceptive services; or\n     (v)     allow Notre Dame and other Catholic non-profit or-\n             ganizations to comply with the Mandate [what we are\n             calling the accommodation or official accommodation]\n             by providing coverage for methods of family planning\n             consistent with Catholic beliefs (i.e., Natural Family\n             Planning training and materials).\n    Number v is not contraception at all; iv elides all consid-\neration of the costs and complications of the administrative\nmachinery for providing tax incentives to consumers; op-\ntions i through iii similarly would involve cumbersome ad-\nministrative machinery and at the same time impose a bur-\n\fNo. 13-3853                                                   23\n\n\nden on Notre Dame’s female students and employees who\nwant to obtain contraceptives.\n   Nor does Notre Dame explain how a government pro-\ngram that directly or indirectly provided contraception cov-\nerage to Notre Dame employees—as Notre Dame suggests—\nwould avoid complicity in sin. Were Notre Dame to hire an\nunemployed person who, by virtue of becoming employed\nby Notre Dame, obtained contraception coverage for the first\ntime, would not the university be “triggering” the new em-\nployee’s access to contraception?\n     We point out, finally, that a religious institution does not\nhave to sign FSBA 700 in order to exempt itself from the re-\nquirement of providing contraceptive coverage to employees\nand (if the institution is a college or university) students. It\ncan in the alternative notify the Department of Health and\nHuman Services. That was the alternative chosen by another\ninstitution of higher learning that was unwilling to provide\ncontraceptive coverage or even sign the FSBA 700. In\nWheaton College v. Burwell, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2806</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2014) (per curi-\nam), the Supreme Court said that “if the applicant informs\nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services in writing that\nit is a nonprofit organization that holds itself out as religious\nand has religious objections to providing coverage for con-\ntraceptive services, the respondents are enjoined from en-\nforcing against the applicant the challenged provisions of the\nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act and related regu-\nlations pending final disposition of appellate review. To\nmeet the condition for injunction pending appeal, the appli-\ncant need not use the form prescribed by the Government,\nEBSA Form 700, and need not send copies to health insur-\nance issuers or third-party administrators.” We assume that\n\f24                                                No. 13-3853\n\n\nNotre Dame could ask Aetna and Meritain to ignore its\nsubmission to them of the signed FSBA 700, and instead\ncould itself inform the Secretary of Health and Human Ser-\nvices of its desire to be exempt on religious grounds from\nproviding contraceptive coverage; undoubtedly the Secre-\ntary would agree.\n    Notre Dame tells us that it likewise objects to that alter-\nnative. But based on the sparse record before us, there is a\nstrong argument that given the government’s legitimate in-\nterest in the provision of contraceptive coverage to women\nwithout cost to them, notice to the government would strike\nthe proper balance between legitimate governmental and\nsincere religious interests. That was the accommodation\nsought and received by Wheaton College.\n     We are put in mind of Bowen v. Roy, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111688\"><a href=\"/opinion/111688/bowen-v-roy/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">693</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1986).\nRoy objected that any use of his daughter’s Social Security\nnumber would substantially burden his religious beliefs be-\ncause he believed that use of that unique identifier would\nharm her spirit. He wanted an accommodation that would\nrelieve him of the burden of providing the number in his\napplications for welfare and food stamps and prevent the\ngovernment from using the number in its internal admin-\nistration. The Supreme Court refused. It said that “Roy may\nno more prevail on his religious objection to the Govern-\nment’s use of a Social Security number for his daughter than\nhe could on a sincere religious objection to the size or color\nof the Government’s filing cabinets.” Id. at 700. The very\nword “accommodation” implies a balance of competing in-\nterests; and when we compare the burden on the govern-\nment or third parties of having to establish some entirely\nnew method of providing contraceptive coverage with the\n\fNo. 13-3853                                                    25\n\n\nburden on Notre Dame of simply notifying the government\nthat the ball is now in the government’s court, we cannot\nconclude that Notre Dame has yet established its right to the\ninjunctive relief that it is seeking before trial. The mandate to\ncover contraceptive care as part of any broad health insur-\nance package provided by employers (or in the case of edu-\ncational institutions, students as well) was intended to min-\nimize financial, administrative, and logistical obstacles to\nsuch coverage. See 78 Fed. Reg. 39888 (July 2, 2013), rejecting\nalternative proposals and explaining the importance of min-\nimizing costs and logistical and administrative obstacles to\ncontraceptive coverage; see also Priests for Life v. U.S. Dept. of\nHealth & Human Services, supra, 772 F.3d at 265. All of Notre\nDame’s suggested alternatives would impose significant fi-\nnancial, administrative, and logistical obstacles by requiring\nwomen to sign up for separate coverage either with a gov-\nernment agency or with another private insurer. Such obsta-\ncles were considered by the Supreme Court in Hobby Lobby\nin support of the same accommodation that Notre Dame re-\nfuses to accept.\n    We emphasize in closing the tentative character of the\nanalysis in this opinion. The record is insufficiently devel-\noped to enable us to rule definitively on Notre Dame’s\nclaims. The burden of establishing an entitlement to a pre-\nliminary injunction was of course on the university, not on\nthe government. The burden has not been carried. Chief\nJudge Simon’s denial of preliminary relief is therefore once\nagain\n                                                   AFFIRMED.\n\f26                                                  No. 13-3853\n\n\n\n    HAMILTON, Circuit Judge, concurring. I join Judge Posner’s\nopinion in full. Notre Dame is not entitled to preliminary in-\njunctive relief at this point. While the ultimate decision on\nthe merits of this case remains uncertain, equitable consider-\nations weigh against a grant of a preliminary injunction now.\nAn injunction would disrupt the status quo and temporarily\ncut off contraceptive coverage for hundreds or thousands of\nwomen.\n    What this case needs now is a trial on the merits where\nthe relevant factual issues can be explored in depth. The lim-\nited factual record before us was made in the district court\non an emergency basis in December 2013. That record was\nalso made without the participation of the intervenors, who\nwould be affected most directly by the injunction Notre\nDame seeks. Since that time, also, the legal and factual land-\nscapes shaping the issues have shifted a good deal.\n    Where the law is evolving rapidly and the facts are com-\nplex, the better course is usually full exploration of the evi-\ndence and thorough findings of fact by the district court, ra-\nther than reliance on sweeping legal doctrines and hypothe-\nsized or assumed facts.

The accommodation for religious not-for-profits like\nNotre Dame played a pivotal role in Hobby Lobby, but not in\na way that helps Notre Dame in this case. Hobby Lobby\nStores is a for-profit corporation that was not eligible for this\naccommodation. The very existence of the accommodation\nfor religious not-for-profits, however, persuaded the Su-\npreme Court that the government could achieve its purpose\nof making contraceptives available to employees and their\nfamilies without infringing on Hobby Lobby’s religious be-\nliefs. 134 S. Ct. at 2782.\n    The Court’s conclusion focused on how the accommoda-\ntion allowed the employer to avoid paying for contraceptives\ncontrary to the owners’ religious beliefs while still making\nthem available to employees and their families in a conven-\nient and seamless way. In praising the accommodation, the\nCourt explained that the effect of the accommodation on\nemployees “would be precisely zero. Under that accommo-\ndation, these women would still be entitled to all FDA-\napproved contraceptives without cost sharing.” 134 S. Ct. at\n2760. Justice Kennedy’s concurring opinion embraced the\n\f28                                                 No. 13-3853\n\naccommodation as a fully satisfactory alternative for accom-\nplishing the government’s objectives without infringing on\nHobby Lobby’s religious beliefs. 134 S. Ct. at 2786–87 (Ken-\nnedy, J., concurring). He also made clear that neither he nor\nthe other Justices in the majority expected the government to\ncreate “a whole new program or burden on the Govern-\nment” to provide the accommodation needed by the for-\nprofit employer-plaintiffs. Id.\n    The accommodation for religious not-for-profits thus\nmade it fairly easy for the Hobby Lobby Court to find that a\nless restrictive and equally effective alternative was available\nto accomplish the government’s purposes, which the Court\nassumed were compelling. The Court’s solution was to ex-\ntend the accommodation to religious owners of closely held\nbusinesses.\n    What does Hobby Lobby teach us about this case? In de-\nciding Hobby Lobby, the Supreme Court was well aware of\npending lawsuits like this one, in which religious not-for-\nprofits have challenged the accommodation itself as violat-\ning their rights under the Religious Freedom Restoration\nAct. The majority opinion referred to this category of cases\nin footnote 9 and wrote later “We do not decide today\nwhether an approach of this type [i.e., the accommodation]\ncomplies with RFRA for purposes of all religious claims.”\n134 S. Ct. at 2782 & n.40.\n    Despite this inconclusive comment, it is useful to consid-\ner in turn the three principal issues under RFRA in light of\nthe Court’s remand order after Hobby Lobby. Those issues are:\n(1) “substantial burden” on the exercise of religion; (2) com-\npelling governmental interests; and (3) less restrictive alter-\nnatives.\n\fNo. 13-3853                                                   29\n\n    1. Substantial Burden: Notre Dame reads Hobby Lobby as\nresolving conclusively in its favor the issue whether the ac-\ncommodation substantially burdens its exercise of its reli-\ngion. In Hobby Lobby, the Court found that the Affordable\nCare Act’s requirements for contraceptive coverage by for-\nprofit employers substantially burdened the plaintiffs’ exer-\ncise of religion. The employers were required by law to con-\ntract and pay for contraceptive coverage to which the em-\nployers’ owners objected on sincere religious grounds. The\nalternatives to compliance would have imposed stiff finan-\ncial consequences, which the Court deemed a substantial\nburden. 134 S. Ct. at 2776–77. Notre Dame faces essentially\nthe same financial consequences if it refuses to certify its eli-\ngibility for the religious accommodation.\n    Notre Dame finds most helpful to its position the Hobby\nLobby rejection of the government’s argument that the role of\nthe employer in contracting and paying for contraceptive\ncoverage was too remote from an employee’s use of contra-\nceptives to impose a substantial burden on the exercise of\nreligion. Federal courts had no business addressing whether\nthe plaintiffs’ religious beliefs about their moral complicity\nwere reasonable. Id. at 2778. The Court explained:\n       This belief implicates a difficult and important\n       question of religion and moral philosophy,\n       namely, the circumstances under which it is\n       wrong for a person to perform an act that is in-\n       nocent in itself but that has the effect of ena-\n       bling or facilitating the commission of an im-\n       moral act by another. Arrogating the authority\n       to provide a binding national answer to this re-\n       ligious and philosophical question, HHS and\n\f30                                                  No. 13-3853\n\n       the principal dissent in effect tell the plaintiffs\n       that their beliefs are flawed. For good reason,\n       we have repeatedly refused to take such a step.\n134 S. Ct. at 2778 (footnote omitted).\n    The accommodation for religious not-for-profits accepts\nan employer’s religious beliefs and provides a mechanism to\nprovide coverage to employees and their families, while\nmaking sure that the employer need not contract, arrange,\npay, or refer for the health care it finds objectionable on reli-\ngious grounds. Notre Dame asserts, however, that the mere\nact of requesting the exemption substantially burdens its re-\nligious exercise because it still has an attenuated role in caus-\ning its employees and students to receive the objectionable\ncoverage. Citing Hobby Lobby, Notre Dame asserts that its\nopinion or belief is beyond the reach of a federal court, apart\nfrom questions of sincerity.\n    It is not obvious that the reasoning of Hobby Lobby on the\nsubstantial burden issue extends to this case. There are im-\nportant differences between the cases: Notre Dame challeng-\nes not the general rule but the accommodation itself, and it\nattempts to prevent the government from arranging for a\nsubstitute for the employer to pay for contraceptive care.\nNotre Dame also contends, in effect, that its religious belief\ncan substitute for legal analysis regarding the operation of\nfederal law.\n    Any student of United States history learns the central\nroles that religious faith and tolerance have played in the set-\ntlement of this land and in the founding of the British colo-\nnies and the modern States and the federal Republic. We\nhave a long tradition of governing in ways that accommo-\n\fNo. 13-3853                                                   31\n\ndate the free exercise of religion. Special treatment of reli-\ngious faith and practice abounds. From conscientious objec-\ntor status in the military draft to federal and state tax codes,\nfrom compulsory school attendance laws to school lunch\nmenus, from zoning law to employment law and even fish\nand wildlife rules, our governments at every level have long\nmade room for religious faith by allowing exceptions from\ngenerally applicable laws. Through such exceptions and ac-\ncommodations, we respect diverse faiths, and we govern\nwith reasonable compromises that avoid unnecessary fric-\ntion between law and faith.\n    As we pointed out in our first opinion in this case, the\nmost extraordinary feature of this lawsuit is Notre Dame’s\nclaim that the process of requesting the accommodation is\nitself a substantial burden on its religious exercise. Notre\nDame v. Sebelius, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">743</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">547</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 557–58 (7th Cir. 2014). True,\nthere are rare cases in which courts have considered the pos-\nsibility that an accommodation process itself might be too\nprolonged, intrusive, ineffective, and/or otherwise burden-\nsome. See, e.g., Saints Constantine & Helen Greek Orthodox\nChurch, Inc. v. City of New Berlin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"789098\"><a href=\"/opinion/789098/sts-constantine-and-helen-greek-orthodox-church-inc-and-john-w/\"><span class=\"volume\">396</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">895</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th Cir. 2005),\nand cases cited there dealing with land-use decisions, and\nUnited States v.

To take advantage of the accommodation, so that\nNotre Dame can avoid contracting, paying, arranging, or re-\nferring for the objectionable contraceptive care, a university\nofficial must only fill out a simple form asserting that Notre\n\f32                                                No. 13-3853\n\nDame is a not-for-profit employer that objects on religious\ngrounds to the law’s contraceptive coverage requirements.\nThe official must then send the form to either the Depart-\nment of Health and Human Services or the insurer or third-\nparty administrator. Notre Dame has already done so, and it\nneed do nothing more.\n    As Judge Posner’s opinion explains, Bowen v. Roy, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111688\"><a href=\"/opinion/111688/bowen-v-roy/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">693</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1986), weighs against Notre Dame’s claim of a sub-\nstantial burden here. Roy had objected on religious grounds\nto the government’s use of his daughter’s Social Security\nnumber to administer federal benefits for the family. The\nSupreme Court rejected the challenge, holding: “The Free\nExercise Clause simply cannot be understood to require the\nGovernment to conduct its own internal affairs in ways that\ncomport with the religious beliefs of particular citizens.” Id.\nat 699.\n    Notre Dame’s position is analogous. At this point, Notre\nDame has requested the accommodation and provided the\ngovernment with contact information for Aetna and Mer-\nitain. The government requires no further action from Notre\nDame. The government has informed Aetna and Meritain of\ntheir federal obligations to provide contraceptive coverage\nthat Notre Dame has been exempted from providing. The\ngovernment’s steps to have others substitute for Notre Dame\nare parallel to the internal procedures at issue in Roy.\n    Notre Dame disagrees, arguing that only it can answer\nwhat it says is the religious question of whether its religious\nexercise is substantially burdened by the government’s ac-\ntions. But the Court rejected precisely that argument when it\nwas advanced by Roy. “The Federal Government’s use of a\nSocial Security number for Little Bird of the Snow does not\n\fNo. 13-3853                                                  33\n\nitself in any degree impair Roy’s ‘freedom to believe, ex-\npress, and exercise’ his religion.” 476 U.S. at 700–01.\n    While the Court acknowledged that “Roy's religious\nviews may not accept this distinction between individual\nand governmental conduct,” id. at 701 n.6, the Court con-\ncluded that this was ultimately a legal question, not a reli-\ngious one: “It is clear, however, that the Free Exercise Clause,\nand the Constitution generally, recognize such a distinction;\nfor the adjudication of a constitutional claim, the Constitu-\ntion, rather than an individual’s religion, must supply the\nframe of reference.” Id. Under Roy, whether the government\nis causing a substantial burden on a person’s religious exer-\ncise is a question of federal law.

Notre Dame\nobjects to this consequence on religious grounds and says it\ncould avoid this consequence only by incurring burdensome\nfinancial penalties.\n   The problem with this argument is that regardless of\nNotre Dame’s choice—to provide contraceptive coverage, to\ninvoke the accommodation for religious not-for-profits, or\n\f34                                                            No. 13-3853\n\neven not to provide any health insurance coverage at all—\nthose employees and students would receive contraceptive\ncoverage through some form of health insurance. As we and\nother circuits have pointed out, their coverage results from\nfederal law, not from Notre Dame’s actions.\n    This is an issue not of moral philosophy but of federal\nlaw. Federal courts are not required to treat Notre Dame’s\nerroneous legal interpretation as beyond their reach—even if\nthat interpretation is also a sincere and religious belief. Notre\nDame is not entitled to nullify the law’s benefits for others\nbased on this mistake of law, which is the foundation of its\nclaim of a substantial burden. 1\n    As in Roy, Notre Dame’s “religious views may not accept\nthis distinction.” 476 U.S. at 701 n.6. But the courts cannot\nsubstitute even the most sincere religious beliefs for legal\nanalysis. To do so would “afford an individual a right to dic-\ntate the conduct of the Government’s internal procedures,”\nwhich the Court has expressly rejected. Id. at 700.\n    A comparison to the military draft helps to illustrate the\nextraordinary nature of Notre Dame’s objection to the gov-\nernment’s accommodation and finding of substitutes for it.\nFederal law allows for exemption from military training and\nservice for any person “who, by reason of religious training\nand belief, is conscientiously opposed to participation in war\nin any form.” 50 App. U.S.C. § 456(j). (The process for claim-\ning conscientious objector status is far more demanding than\n\n\n     1 Accord, Geneva College, 778 F.3d at 437 (3rd Cir. 2015); Priests for\nLife, 772 F.3d at 252; Michigan Catholic Conference, 755 F.3d at 387; 78 Fed.\nReg. 39870, 39876 (July 2, 2013) (final rules explaining that obligations of\ninsurers and third-party administrators are imposed by federal law).\n\fNo. 13-3853                                                 35\n\nthe accommodation to which Notre Dame objects, but that’s\nnot my focus here.) Suppose a person’s religious faith leads\nhim to believe that it is wrong for people to engage in war.\nHe applies for conscientious objector status. The local draft\nboard grants him the exemption.\n    But suppose a board member then points out that be-\ncause the objector will not be drafted, someone else will be\ndrafted in his place. He objects again, asserting, much as\nNotre Dame does here, that if his exemption means someone\nelse must substitute for him to engage in wrongdoing, he\nwill be morally responsible for it and his religious exercise\nwill be substantially burdened. Citing RFRA, he therefore\ndemands that he be exempted without a substitute.\n    As we said in our prior opinion, that seems a “fantastic\nsuggestion.” Notre Dame, 743 F.3d at 556. Yet Notre Dame\nhas embraced that reasoning. It argues that national catas-\ntrophe could be avoided by treating the substitute draftee as\nthe least restrictive means to achieve a compelling govern-\nmental purpose. See Notre Dame Rule 54 Statement at 11\nn.4. This seems wrong in two fundamental ways.\n    First, for reasons explained above, the arrangements the\ngovernment makes to find substitutes for those given the\nbenefit of a religious exemption are imposed as a matter of\nfederal law, not as a result of the exemption itself. The party\nclaiming the exemption is not entitled to raise a religious ob-\njection to the arrangements the government makes for a sub-\nstitute. See Geneva College, 778 F.3d at 439 n.14 (making simi-\nlar point with example of employee who asks for time off to\naccommodate his religion, but who then objects to employ-\ner’s substitution for him). And not coincidentally, the gov-\nernment’s ability to find substitutes fits well with the Su-\n\f36                                                  No. 13-3853\n\npreme Court’s decision, just a few days after it decided Hob-\nby Lobby, in a RFRA case much more similar to this one. In\nWheaton College v. Burwell, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2806</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2014), the Court\nissued an interim order allowing another religious college to\ninvoke the exemption by notifying the government rather\nthan its insurer. The Court pointed out: “Nothing in this or-\nder precludes the Government from relying on this notice, to\nthe extent it considers it necessary, to facilitate the provision\nof full contraceptive coverage under the Act.” Id. at 2807. In\nother words, the Court’s order allowed the government to\npass the notice on to the insurer so that the insurer could\ncomply with its obligations under federal law. That order left\nWheaton College essentially where Notre Dame is now.\n    Second, if even such mistaken and attenuated objections\nwere sufficient to invoke RFRA’s stringent least-restrictive-\nmeans test, fair governance where the law imposes burdens\non individuals would become nearly impossible. In the draft\ncontext, the conscientious objector could argue, much as\nNotre Dame does here, in favor of an all-volunteer military\nas a less restrictive means. Should arguments for such radi-\ncal restructuring of government programs be sufficient un-\nder RFRA? And in contexts not involving national security\nand defense, would government accommodations of religion\nthat require finding substitutes all have to satisfy compel-\nling-interest, least-restrictive-means scrutiny?\n   For these reasons, RFRA should not be understood to\nrecognize such mistaken views about substitutes as “sub-\nstantial burdens” on religious belief.

Compelling Governmental Interest: Even if Notre Dame\ncan ultimately show a substantial burden on its religious be-\nlief, the next major issue under RFRA is whether imposing\nthe burden on Notre Dame furthers a “compelling govern-\nmental interest.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb–1. In the abbreviated\ndistrict court proceedings back in December 2013, the federal\ngovernment did not contest this issue because of our ruling\nin Korte v. Sebelius, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">735</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">654</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th Cir. 2013), though the\ngovernment preserved its right to dispute the issue in the\nfuture.\n    Hobby Lobby now shows that the government has a strong\nargument on the compelling-interest issue. The Hobby Lobby\nmajority assumed that the burden on those plaintiffs would\nserve a compelling governmental interest. 134 S. Ct. at 2780.\nJustice Kennedy’s concurring opinion made clear that he\nviewed the governmental interests as compelling. Id. at 2786\n(“It is important to confirm that a premise of the Court’s\nopinion is its assumption that the HHS regulation here at\nissue furthers a legitimate and compelling interest in the\nhealth of female employees.”). And all four dissenting Jus-\ntices viewed the government interests as compelling. Id. at\n2799–2801 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting). The compelling inter-\nests include women’s health, the role that access to contra-\nception plays in enabling women to participate fully and\nequally in society, and significant cost savings. See 78 Fed.\nReg. 39870, 39873 & nn. 22, 23, & 24 (July 2, 2013) (final\nrules). The D.C. Circuit has explained in detail the factual\n\f38                                                No. 13-3853\n\nbases for the government’s compelling interests. See Priests\nfor Life, 772 F.3d at 257–64.\n    3. Least Restrictive Means: If the RFRA analysis proceeds\nto whether the accommodation for religious not-for-profits\nlike Notre Dame is the least restrictive means of furthering\nthe government’s interest, the question demands much more\nexploration than was possible in the emergency proceedings\nin the district court back in December 2013.\n    The general mandate to cover contraceptive care as part\nof any broad health insurance package provided by employ-\ners was intended to minimize financial, administrative, and\nlogistical obstacles to such coverage. 78 Fed. Reg. at 39888\n(rejecting alternative proposals and explaining importance of\navoiding incremental costs and minimizing logistical and\nadministrative obstacles for contraceptive coverage); Priests\nfor Life, 772 F.3d at 265. The accommodation for religious not-\nfor-profits has also been designed to minimize those obsta-\ncles.\n    Notre Dame’s suggested alternatives would all impose\nsignificant financial, administrative, and logistical obstacles\nby requiring women to sign up for separate coverage, either\nwith a government agency or another private insurer, and to\npay additional costs unless the government paid for the pro-\ngram. Such obstacles were specifically considered in Hobby\nLobby. In debating whether the accommodation would suf-\nfice for the for-profit employers, the majority and dissent\npaid close attention to cost and to administrative and logisti-\ncal obstacles. See 134 S. Ct. at 2782–83 (under the accommo-\ndation, plaintiffs’ employees would continue to receive con-\ntraceptive coverage without cost sharing and with “minimal\nlogistical and administrative obstacles”); id. at 2802 (Gins-\n\fNo. 13-3853                                                 39\n\nburg, J., dissenting) (new government program as substitute\nwould impose obstacles to effective coverage). Those con-\ncerns about effectiveness of alternatives seem to have sub-\nstantial merit. They deserve exploration in the district court.\n    The least-restrictive-means issue also presents a question\nof law for which the contours are not yet well-defined. The\nlegal question is in essence the scope of imagination permit-\nted in thinking of supposedly less restrictive means.\n    The heart of the Affordable Care Act was a decision to\napproach universal health insurance by expanding the em-\nployer-based system of private health insurance that had\nevolved in our country, rather than to substitute a new “sin-\ngle payer” government program to pay for health care, like\nthe systems in place in the United Kingdom and Canada. I\ndo not see support for Notre Dame’s view that a least-\nrestrictive-means analysis would need to consider such radi-\ncally different alternatives.\n     In fact, Justice Kennedy’s Hobby Lobby concurrence em-\nphasized that the accommodation for religious not-for-\nprofits was an “existing, recognized, workable, and already-\nimplemented framework to provide coverage” for employ-\nees with an objecting employer. 134 S. Ct. at 2786 (Kennedy,\nJ., concurring). In finding that the accommodation was a less\nrestrictive alternative, Justice Kennedy noted that “the Gov-\nernment has not met its burden of showing that it cannot ac-\ncommodate the plaintiffs’ similar religious objections under\nthis established framework.” Id. (emphasis added). He also\ncommented that accommodation was possible “without im-\nposition of a whole new program or burden on the Govern-\nment.” Id.\n\f40                                                  No. 13-3853\n\n    Consistent with those observations, I doubt that a hypo-\nthetical new single-payer program for contraceptives, which\nwould require separate registration or application, would be\nfor RFRA purposes a “less restrictive” means of achieving\nthe government’s interests. It also seems likely that such a\nprogram would impose the sort of logistical and administra-\ntive obstacles of such concern in Hobby Lobby.\n    Further fact-finding in the district court may cast the case\nin a different light, of course. But for all of these reasons, as\nwell as those explained in Judge Posner’s opinion, I continue\nto agree that Chief Judge Simon properly denied a prelimi-\nnary injunction in this case.\n\fNo. 13-3853                                                 41\n\n   FLAUM, Circuit Judge, dissenting.\n       By requiring health insurers to provide contraceptive\n   coverage, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act\n   (“ACA”) forces Notre Dame to act in ways it says violate\n   its religious beliefs. The resultant burden on Notre\n   Dame’s rights is substantial: because Notre Dame offers\n   health insurance to its students, and especially because it\n   acts as a self-insurer for its employees, the law turns\n   Notre Dame into a conduit for the provision of cost-free\n   contraception. It also compels Notre Dame to contract\n   with parties—Meritain and Aetna—in a manner in which\n   Notre Dame believes makes it complicit in moral wrong.\n   Notre Dame’s only alternative is to endure crippling\n   fines.\n       In light of the Supreme Court’s ruling in Burwell v.\n   Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2681317\"><a href=\"/opinion/2681317/burwell-v-hobby-lobby-stores-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2751</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2014)—the deci-\n   sion the Court cited in asking us to reconsider this case—\n   Notre Dame has articulated a substantial burden for\n   purposes of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act\n   (“RFRA”), 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb et seq. As a result, strict\n   scrutiny governs our consideration of Notre Dame’s chal-\n   lenge here, and the government has the burden of\n   demonstrating that the challenged accommodation is the\n   least restrictive means of serving a compelling interest. In\n   my view, the government has not satisfied that charge.\n   Accordingly, I respectfully dissent, concluding that Notre\n   Dame is entitled to a preliminary injunction pending the\n   district court’s decision of this case on the merits.\n                           *      *      *\n\f42                                                 No. 13-3853\n\n         The Catholic Church—like all religious employers—is\n     exempt from the ACA’s contraceptive mandate. See Hobby\n     Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2763. The U.S. Department of Health\n     & Human Services excluded churches and religious or-\n     ders from its edict, permitting them to offer employee\n     health insurance that does not include coverage for con-\n     traception. Notre Dame seeks that same treatment, be-\n     cause it has the same religious objections to rendering\n     available contraceptive health coverage for those it em-\n     ploys (and those that attend its school, in Notre Dame’s\n     case). At present, Notre Dame—as a nonprofit religious\n     organization that opposes providing contraceptive cov-\n     erage—may avail itself of what has become commonly\n     referred to as “the accommodation,” see e.g., 45 C.F.R.\n     § 147.131(b), the effects of which Notre Dame says also\n     violate its religious beliefs.\n         Notre Dame has two distinct roles as far as health in-\n     surance is concerned. With respect to its employees,\n     Notre Dame acts as a self-insurer (hiring Meritain as the\n     third-party administrator of its insurance plan). For its\n     students, Notre Dame acts as an insurance broker (nego-\n     tiating on their behalf to offer them an insurance plan\n     through insurer Aetna). When Notre Dame invoked the\n     accommodation, its relationship with both Meritain and\n     Aetna changed because of the ACA. Meritain, its third-\n     party administrator, became both authorized and re-\n     quired to offer contraceptive coverage to Notre Dame’s\n     employees. See Wheaton Coll. v. Burwell, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2806</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n     2814 n.6 (2014) (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (noting that a\n     religious university’s “third-party administrator bears the\n     legal obligation to provide contraceptive coverage only\n     upon receipt of a valid self-certification” (emphasis add-\n\fNo. 13-3853                                                   43\n\n   ed)). Aetna, as the insurer for the student plans, became\n   obligated to segregate premium payments from Notre\n   Dame’s students and to provide them with contraceptive\n   coverage at Aetna’s expense, separate and apart from the\n   insurance plan offered by the school. See Hobby Lobby, 134\n   S. Ct. at 2763 (“When a group-health-insurance issuer re-\n   ceives notice that one of its clients has invoked this provi-\n   sion, the issuer must then exclude contraceptive coverage\n   from the employer’s plan and provide separate payments\n   for contraceptive services for plan participants without\n   imposing any cost-sharing requirements on the eligible\n   organization, its insurance plan, or its employees benefi-\n   ciaries.”(citing 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(c)).\n       While Notre Dame is no longer obligated to pay for\n   contraceptive services for its employees, it’s apparent to\n   me that, at a minimum, the ACA thrusts Notre Dame into\n   a facilitator’s role that, Notre Dame says, violates its reli-\n   gious beliefs by forcing it to serve as a continuing link be-\n   tween Meritain and the contraceptive services it provides\n   to Notre Dame’s employees.\n       With regard to the student health plan, there seems to\n   be outstanding disagreement over whether Notre Dame’s\n   invocation of the accommodation “triggers” Aetna’s obli-\n   gation to cover student contraception. See Wheaton Coll.,\n   134 S. Ct. at 2807 (majority opinion) (“The Government\n   contends that the applicant’s health insurance issuer …\n   [is] required by federal law to provide full contraceptive\n   coverage regardless [of] whether the applicant” invokes\n   the accommodation, while Wheaton College “contends,\n   by contrast, that the obligations of its health insurance is-\n   suer ... are dependent on their receipt of notice that the\n\f44                                                No. 13-3853\n\n     applicant objects to the contraceptive coverage require-\n     ment.”). But see 42 U.S.C. § 300gg–13(a) (“A group health\n     plan and a health insurance issuer offering group or in-\n     dividual health insurance coverage shall, at a minimum\n     provide coverage for and shall not impose any cost shar-\n     ing requirements for— … (4) with respect to women,\n     such additional preventive care and screenings … as\n     provided for in comprehensive guidelines supported by\n     the Health Resources and Services Administration … .”).\n     But that question really is of no moment here, because\n     Notre Dame also believes that being driven into an ongo-\n     ing contractual relationship with an insurer—especially\n     one that Notre Dame chose—that provides its students\n     with contraception compels it to act in contravention of\n     its beliefs.\n        In Notre Dame’s view, the ACA alters its relationships\n     with both Meritain and Aetna in a way that renders\n     Notre Dame morally complicit in the provision of contra-\n     ception. Put simply, Notre Dame is too engaged in a pro-\n     cess—the very premise of which offends its religion—\n     that the church itself is exempted from entirely.\n         The majority appears to minimize the significance of\n     Notre Dame’s position by focusing on its continued ob-\n     jection to the mandate in the face of a proffered accom-\n     modation. I believe that any inquiry into the rationality\n     of that position is precluded by the Supreme Court’s de-\n     cision in Hobby Lobby, which in my view underscores the\n     legitimacy of Notre Dame’s religious objection. There, as\n     here, HHS’s main argument was “basically that the con-\n     nection between what the objecting parties must do …\n     and the end that they find to be morally wrong … [was]\n\fNo. 13-3853                                                           45\n\n   simply too attenuated.” 134 S. Ct. at 2777. However, the\n   Supreme Court made clear that this position, at least in\n   this narrow context, is untenable. That’s because it\n   “dodges the question that RFRA presents (whether the\n   HHS mandate imposes a substantial burden on the abil-\n   ity of the objecting parties to conduct business in accord-\n   ance with their religious beliefs) and instead addresses a\n   very different question that the federal courts have no\n   business addressing (whether the religious belief asserted\n   in a RFRA case is reasonable).” Id. at 2778 (emphasis in\n   original).\n        Like the plaintiffs’ challenge in Hobby Lobby, Notre\n   Dame’s deeply held religious beliefs about contraception\n   and the formation and prevention of human life “impli-\n   cate[] a difficult and important question of religion and\n   moral philosophy, namely, the circumstances under\n   which it is wrong for a person to perform an act that is\n   innocent in itself but that has the effect of enabling or fa-\n   cilitating the commission of an immoral act by another.”\n   Id. Notre Dame is no doubt differently situated than the\n   Hobby Lobby plaintiffs, who had to directly provide con-\n   traceptive insurance. Nevertheless, the ACA also places\n   Notre Dame in a position that contravenes its belief sys-\n   tem. Yet the majority here sides with HHS, and “in effect\n   tell[s] the plaintiff[] that [its] beliefs are flawed.” 1 Id. The\n\n   1 To the extent the majority views Notre Dame’s burden as less sub-\n   stantial than the burden imposed on the plaintiffs in Hobby Lobby\n   (and thus not actionable under RFRA) because Notre Dame is fur-\n   ther removed from the direct provision of contraception, I suggest\n   that analysis is flawed. Hobby Lobby instructs that, once we determine\n   a religious belief is burdened, substantiality is measured by the se-\n\f46                                                          No. 13-3853\n\n     Hobby Lobby Court, however, rejected that position. See id.\n     (“Repeatedly and in many different contexts, we have\n     warned that courts must not presume to determine … the\n     plausibility of a religious claim.” (quoting Emp’t Div.,\n     Dep’t of Human Res. of Or. v.

And so do I.\n        For that reason, the Hobby Lobby Court had “little\n     trouble concluding” that “the HHS contraceptive man-\n     date ‘substantially burden[ed]’ the exercise of religion” in\n     view of the plaintiffs’ asserted beliefs. 2 Id. at 2775. The\n     Court thus proceeded to the compelling interest compo-\n     nent of the RFRA test. See id. at 2779 (“Since the HHS con-\n\n                                                                      –––\n     verity of the penalties for non-compliance. 134 S. Ct. at 2759, 2775–\n     76. Because the contraceptive mandate forced the Hobby Lobby plain-\n     tiffs “to pay an enormous sum of money ... if they insist[ed] on\n     providing insurance coverage in accordance with their religious be-\n     liefs, the mandate clearly impose[d] a substantial burden on those\n     beliefs.” Id. at 2779. Here, Notre Dame faces the same penalties the\n     Hobby Lobby plaintiffs faced: $100 per day for each affected individu-\n     al. 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-22(b)(2)(C). “These sums are surely substan-\n     tial.” Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2776.\n     2 I would be remiss not to note that just one week after the Supreme\n     Court issued its opinion in Hobby Lobby, Wheaton College—which,\n     on the basis of our first (and now vacated) decision in this case was\n     denied a preliminary injunction in its own Seventh Circuit suit chal-\n     lenging the contraceptive mandate’s accommodation provision—\n     sought and was granted emergency relief by the Supreme Court.\n     Wheaton Coll., 134 S. Ct. at 2807. In granting the preliminary injunc-\n     tion, the Court necessarily found (at least for preliminary injunctive\n     purposes) that the accommodation substantially burdened Wheaton\n     College. Notre Dame challenges that same (though slightly revised)\n     accommodation.\n\fNo. 13-3853                                                  47\n\n   traceptive mandate imposes a substantial burden on the\n   exercise of religion, we must move on and decide wheth-\n   er HHS has shown that the mandate both ‘(1) is in fur-\n   therance of a compelling governmental interest; and (2) is\n   the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling\n   governmental interest.’ 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb–1(b).”). In\n   Hobby Lobby, “HHS assert[ed] that the contraceptive\n   mandate serves a variety of important interests, but\n   many of these [were] couched in very broad terms, such\n   as promoting ‘public health’ and ‘gender equality.’” Id.\n   HHS asserted those same interests to the district court in\n   this case.

Ind. 2013) (No. 3:13-cv-01276) (“[E]ven if the\n   challenged regulations were deemed to impose a sub-\n   stantial burden on plaintiff’s religious exercise, the regu-\n   lations satisfy strict scrutiny because they are narrowly\n   tailored to serve compelling government interests in pub-\n   lic health and gender inequality.” (emphases added)). The\n   Supreme Court, however, rejected the simple assertion of\n   such broad interests.\n       “RFRA … contemplates a ‘more focused’ inquiry: It\n   ‘requires the Government to demonstrate that the com-\n   pelling interest test is satisfied through application of the\n   challenged law ‘to the person’—the particular claimant\n   whose sincere exercise of religion is being substantially\n   burdened.’” Hobby Lobby, 134 S.

(quoting O Centro, 546\n\f48                                                   No. 13-3853\n\n     U.S. at 431). Nevertheless, the Court found it unnecessary\n     to delve into the “features of [the] ACA that support [the]\n     view” that the government lacks a compelling interest\n     here (such as the fact that “many employees—those cov-\n     ered by grandfathered plans and those who work for\n     employers with fewer than 50 employees—may have no\n     contraceptive coverage without cost sharing at all”), be-\n     cause—even assuming that the government’s interest is a\n     compelling one—HHS failed to demonstrate “that the\n     contraceptive mandate is ‘the least restrictive means of\n     furthering’” it. Id. at 2780 (citing § 2000bb–1(b)(2)).\n         As the Court noted, “[t]he least-restrictive-means\n     standard is exceptionally demanding,” and it is the gov-\n     ernment’s burden to demonstrate that “it lacks other\n     means of achieving its desired goal without imposing a\n     substantial burden on the exercise of religion by the ob-\n     jecting part[y].” Id. Here again, the majority in our case\n     sets aside Hobby Lobby, instead assigning Notre Dame\n     this burden because it seeks a preliminary injunction.

Indeed, the gov-\n   ernment—in this very case—conceded in its brief to the\n   district court that Korte dictates the issuance of a prelimi-\n   nary injunction if the court finds a substantial burden on\n   Notre Dame’s religious beliefs. See Defs.’ Resp. in Opp’n\n   to Pl.’s Mot. for Prelim. Inj., supra, at 15–16 (“Defendants\n   recognize that a majority of the Seventh Circuit rejected\n   these arguments [that the regulations satisfy strict scruti-\n   ny because they are narrowly tailored to serve compel-\n   ling governmental interests in public health and gender\n   equality] in Korte, and that this Court is bound by that\n   decision.”). In Korte, we granted the preliminary injunc-\n   tion because the government had made minimal efforts\n   “to explain how the contraception mandate is the least\n   restrictive means of furthering its stated goals of promot-\n   ing public health and gender equality.” 735 F.3d at 687.\n   Korte, of course, was our iteration of Hobby Lobby, and it\n   remains the law of this circuit—yet it appears not to in-\n   struct the majority.\n       The majority observes that Notre Dame has presented\n   “possible alternatives” to the accommodation that would\n   not infringe its religious exercise. Yet it concludes that\n   Notre Dame has failed to present an adequate proposal\n   for how the government can efficiently (and convenient-\n   ly) implement and administer an alternative program.\n   But to reiterate, Hobby Lobby expressly informs—\n   consistent with Korte—that it is the government’s, not\n   Notre Dame’s, burden to establish that the accommoda-\n   tion is the least restrictive means of advancing a compel-\n   ling government interest. Moreover, the suggestion by\n   the majority that any alternative method of advancing\n\f50                                                 No. 13-3853\n\n     the government’s interests would likely be too costly or\n     cumbersome to the government turns a blind eye to the\n     Supreme Court’s latest teachings. What matters under\n     RFRA is whether the means by which the government is\n     attempting to advance its compelling interest is the least\n     burdensome on Notre Dame’s religious beliefs. Accord-\n     ingly, RFRA may require the government to start over\n     and “creat[e] … entirely new programs,” and it “may in\n     some circumstances require the Government to expend\n     additional funds to accommodate citizens’ religious be-\n     liefs.” Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2781. For those reasons,\n     the Supreme Court made clear that, in this sphere, “[t]he\n     most straightforward way” of serving the Government’s\n     interests would be for it to assume the cost of providing\n     contraception “to any women who are unable to obtain\n     them under their health-insurance policies due to their\n     employers’ religious objections.” Id. at 2780. Here, as in\n     Hobby Lobby, “HHS has not shown … that this is not a vi-\n     able alternative.” Id. For that reason, I would reverse the\n     decision of the district court denying Notre Dame a pre-\n     liminary injunction.\n\f</pre>",
