We affirm.\n\n\n     We review de novo the district court's grant of summary judgment.\nSee Beyerbach v. Sears, 49 F.3d 1324, 1325 (8th Cir. 1995).         We agree with\nthe district court that appellants' conditions-of-confinement claim for\ninjunctive and declaratory relief was moot due to the inmates' transfer to\na different facility.         See Martin v. Sargent, 780 F.2d 1334, 1337 (8th Cir.\n1985).       We reject appellants' contention that their claims are \"capable of\nrepetition, yet evading review,\" because they have not demonstrated there\nexists a \"reasonable expectation\" that they will again be subject to the\nsame action, or that any such repeated exposure would be of too short a\nduration to permit litigation.           See Murphy v. Hunt, 455 U.S. 478, 482\n(1982) (per curiam); McFarlin v. Newport Special Sch. Dist., 980 F.2d 1208,\n1211 (8th Cir. 1992).          Thus, the district court properly granted summary\njudgment on appellants' conditions-of-confinement claim.        We further reject\nappellants' contention that the court abused its discretion in denying them\nleave to amend their complaint.\n\n\n     We also find summary judgment was proper on Moise's claim that he was\nplaced in administrative segregation without a finding of guilt.        Moise did\nnot allege that any defendant was personally involved in or actually knew\nof the unlawful placement.         See Givens v. Jones, 900 F.2d 1229, 1233 (8th\nCir. 1990); McDowell v. Jones, 990 F.2d 433, 435 (8th Cir. 1993).\n\n\n\n\n         1\n      The Honorable Jean C. Hamilton, Chief Judge, United States\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Missouri.\n\fThe judgment is affirmed.\n\n\nA true copy.\n\n\n     Attest:\n\n\n           CLERK, U. S.
