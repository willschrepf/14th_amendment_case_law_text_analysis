MARTIN, JR., Circuit Judge. Rasins Landscape & Associates, Inc., a\n\nsubcontractor, sued the Michigan Department of Transportation because fourteen prime contractors\n\nfailed to pay Rasins for work completed on projects for the Department. The district court dismissed\n\nRasins’s claims on the grounds that Rasins did not have standing to bring suit against the\n\nDepartment. Rasins appeals the district court’s judgment, and for the following reasons, we\n\nAFFIRM.\n\n                                                 I.\n\n       The Department receives federal funding for road and highway improvements from the\n\nFederal Highway Administration. In compliance with the Highway Administration’s regulations,\n\n       *\n        The Honorable Curtis L. Collier, United States District Court Judge for the Eastern District\nof Tennessee, sitting by designation.\n\fNo. 11-2176\nRasins Landscape & Assocs., Inc. v. Michigan Dep’t of Transp.\n\nthe Department encourages prime contractors who bid on projects to hire a certain number of\n\nDisadvantaged Business Entity subcontractors. The Department also requires that prime contractors\n\nenter into a contract with the Department that mandates compliance with 23 U.S.C. § 324, which\n\nprohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, and that prime contractors post bond for payments owed\n\nto subcontractors by obtaining a surety to guarantee such payments.\n\n         Pursuant to 49 C.F.R. § 26.29(a), the “prompt payment” provision, the Department requires\n\nthat prime contractors pay subcontractors for satisfactory performance within ten days from the date\n\nthat the prime contractor receives payment from the Department. In compliance with 49 C.F.R. §\n\n26.29(d), the Department provides means to enforce the prompt-payment requirement. The\n\nDepartment may sanction prime contractors for non-compliance through the “withholding of\n\nestimates on projects where prompt-payment violations are confirmed; reduction of prequalification\n\nratings; and/or withdrawal of bidding privileges.” In addition, the subcontractor may submit a lien\n\nclaim to the Department’s Contract Services Division to notify the project surety of a non-payment\n\nissue.\n\n         Rasins, a company majority-owned and operated by Christina Rasins, provided landscaping\n\nservices for large-scale projects. Christina applied for and received certification as a Disadvantaged\n\nBusiness Entity.    A number of prime contractors awarded Rasins subcontracts to perform\n\nlandscaping work on major road-construction projects for the Department. Although Rasins duly\n\ncompleted the projects, several of the prime contractors failed to pay Rasins. In sum, fourteen\n\ndifferent prime contractors owed Rasins approximately $491,160.76.\n\n\n\n                                                -2-\n\fNo. 11-2176\nRasins Landscape & Assocs., Inc. v. Michigan Dep’t of Transp.\n\n         After repeatedly making payment demands on the prime contractors, Rasins informed the\n\nDepartment of the prime contractors’ failure to pay and demanded that it force payment. Further,\n\nRasins filed a complaint with the Department alleging that the prime contractors’ failure to pay\n\namounted to a violation of the Department’s regulations and of gender-discrimination laws.\n\nSubsequently, the Department held a hearing and found the prime contractors liable to Rasins for\n\npayments due, but the Department did not ultimately sanction them or enforce payment. Rasins did\n\nnot pursue legal action against either the prime contractors or the sureties.\n\n         In the end, Rasins never received the $491,160.76 owed to it and is in the process of\n\ndissolving. Rasins filed suit in United States District Court, alleging, among other things, that the\n\nDepartment violated 23 U.S.C. § 234 by discriminating against Rasins on the basis of Christina\n\nRasins’s gender and by engaging in retaliatory conduct. Rasins complained that the Department\n\nfailed to use the enforcement mechanisms at its disposal. Additionally, Rasins alleged that the\n\nDepartment colluded with the prime contractors to avoid payment and instructed one prime\n\ncontractor to file a lawsuit against Rasins to prevent suspension of the prime contractor’s bidding\n\nrights. The Department moved to dismiss the claims, and after a hearing on the motion, the district\n\ncourt found that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over Rasins’s claims because Rasins did not\n\nhave standing. Accordingly, it granted the Department’s motion to dismiss.\n\n                                                 II.\n\n         We review de novo a district court’s dismissal of a case under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) for\n\nlack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Stalley v. Methodist Healthcare, 517 F.3d 911, 916 (6th Cir.\n\n2008).\n\n                                                -3-\n\fNo. 11-2176\nRasins Landscape & Assocs., Inc. v. Michigan Dep’t of Transp.\n\n                                                 III.\n\n       As a threshold matter, the Department does not have the power to perform two of the actions\n\nthat Rasins demands: forcing prime contractors to pay Rasins and forcing sureties to pay Rasins.\n\nFirst, the Department has stated, both at trial and on appeal, that it has no mechanism in place to\n\ndirectly compel prime contractors to pay subcontractors, an assertion that the district court accepted\n\nand that Rasins does not appear to contest on appeal. Second, the Department does not have the\n\npower to force the project sureties to pay Rasins. While the Department must require prime\n\ncontractors to post bond by obtaining a surety to guarantee payments to subcontractors, see Mich.\n\nComp. Laws § 570.101, an unpaid subcontractor’s remedy is to sue the surety, not to request that the\n\nDepartment compel the surety to pay, see Mich. Comp. Laws § 570.104. Rasins failed to exercise\n\nits opportunity to seek payment from the sureties. A subcontractor may submit a lien claim to the\n\nDepartment in order to notify the project surety of non-payment, but the surety is the party that must\n\nensure that all payments are made and that must be sued if a dispute arises.\n\n       Thus, the question that remains is whether Rasins had standing to demand that the\n\nDepartment use the remaining methods at its disposal—withholding future payments and restricting\n\neligibility to bid on future projects—to sanction the prime contractors.\n\n                                                 IV.\n\n       The Supreme Court has stated that “the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing\n\ncontains three elements”: (1) an “injury in fact”; (2) “a causal connection between the injury and the\n\nconduct complained of”; and (3) that “the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.” Lujan\n\nv. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560–61 (1992) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n                                                -4-\n\fNo. 11-2176\nRasins Landscape & Assocs., Inc. v. Michigan Dep’t of Transp.\n\nMoreover, “[t]he party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing these elements.”\n\nId. at 561. The Department does not dispute that Rasins has an injury in fact—its unpaid fees in the\n\namount of $491,176.60. The case turns on elements (2) and (3) of the standing analysis—whether\n\nthe Department was the cause of Rasins’s injury and whether the relief that Rasins seeks will redress\n\nthat injury.\n\n        With regard to causation, the Supreme Court has elaborated that the injury must be “fairly\n\n. . . trace[able] to the challenged action of the defendant, and not . . . th[e] result [of] the independent\n\naction of some third party not before the court.” Id. at 560 (alteration in original) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted). Rasins’s injury is not fairly traceable to the Department. The prime contractors\n\ncaused Rasins’s injury when they refused to pay Rasins and thus the injury is the result of an\n\nindependent action of some third party not before the court. In fact, the Department’s actions about\n\nwhich Rasins now complains—failing to sanction the prime contractors—occurred well after the\n\nprime contractors inflicted Rasins’s injury. In effect, Rasins’s allegations do not show that the\n\nDepartment caused its injury; rather, they show that after third parties injured Rasins, the Department\n\nfailed to order those that truly caused Rasins’s injury to make recompense.\n\n        This case presents an unfortunate set of circumstances, but Rasins has sued the wrong party,\n\nbringing before the court a government entity whose failure to enforce its regulations did not cause\n\nRasins’s injury. See Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 757–59 (1984) (finding no causation of\n\nplaintiffs’ injury—their children’s diminished ability to receive an education in a racially integrated\n\nschool—when the IRS failed to deny tax-exempt status to racially segregated private schools); Simon\n\nv. E. Ky. Welfare Rights Org., 426 U.S. 26, 44–45 (1976) (finding no causation of plaintiffs’\n\n                                                   -5-\n\fNo. 11-2176\nRasins Landscape & Assocs., Inc. v. Michigan Dep’t of Transp.\n\ninjury—fewer hospitals for indigents—when the IRS allowed favorable tax treatment to a nonprofit\n\nhospital that offered only emergency-room service to indigents). To permit Rasins’s error to create\n\njurisdiction seems especially unnecessary given that all Rasins needed to do to recoup its money was\n\nto sue the project surety. It is unclear why Rasins, rather than going after the parties that actually\n\ninjured it—or the sureties insuring them—has chosen to blame the Department for its losses. As the\n\nAllen court put it, “[t]he links in the chain of causation between the challenged Government conduct\n\nand the asserted injury are far too weak for the chain as a whole to sustain [Rasins’s] standing.”\n\nAllen, 468 U.S. at 759.\n\n       While the inquiry could end here, it is also worth noting that Rasins has not established the\n\nthird element required for standing—redressability. The Supreme Court has stated that “it must be\n\nlikely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.”\n\nLujan, 504 U.S. at 561 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Supreme Court has also noted that\n\nwhen “a plaintiff’s asserted injury arises from the government’s allegedly unlawful regulation (or\n\nlack of regulation) of someone else,” a likelihood of redressability is “substantially more difficult\n\nto establish,” as it “depends on the unfettered choices made by independent actors not before the\n\ncourts and whose exercise of broad and legitimate discretion the courts cannot presume either to\n\ncontrol or to predict.” Id. at 562 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n       In this case, Rasins bears the burden of demonstrating that it is likely, rather than merely\n\nspeculative, that a court ordering the Department to issue sanctions would redress Rasins’s injury\n\nand result in the collection of the money owed. Rasins’s only attempt at a redressability argument\n\nis the conclusory statement that “[o]nly a willfully irrational prime contractor would withhold\n\n                                                -6-\n\fNo. 11-2176\nRasins Landscape & Assocs., Inc. v. Michigan Dep’t of Transp.\n\npayments in the face of [the Department’s] sanctions.” Other than this unsupported statement,\n\nRasins offers no evidence to demonstrate that a prime contractor would likely pay its debts rather\n\nthan suffer sanctions.\n\n        Rasins has failed to develop a record that supports its claims, as it is unclear that a prime\n\ncontractor would pay its debts even if sanctioned. Some of the debtor-contractors owe large sums\n\nof money to Rasins and thus payment to Raisin may cost more than the threatened sanctions. Some\n\nmay no longer be solvent or in business. Some may have already received all payments owed to\n\nthem by the Department such that the Department’s threat to withhold future payments would not\n\nprompt payment. And some may not anticipate bidding on future Michigan government contracts\n\nsuch that the Department’s revocation of bidding privileges would similarly fail to compel payment.\n\nHowever unfortunate Rasins’s circumstances may be, what is clear is that we cannot make a\n\ndetermination that it is likely, rather than merely speculative, that a favorable decision from this court\n\nwill redress Rasins’s injuries. In sum, Rasins has failed to carry its burden of proving redressability.\n\n        For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  -7-\n\f",

Michigan Dep’t of Transp.\n\n                                                 III.\n\n       As a threshold matter, the Department does not have the power to perform two of the actions\n\nthat Rasins demands: forcing prime contractors to pay Rasins and forcing sureties to pay Rasins.\n\nFirst, the Department has stated, both at trial and on appeal, that it has no mechanism in place to\n\ndirectly compel prime contractors to pay subcontractors, an assertion that the district court accepted\n\nand that Rasins does not appear to contest on appeal. Second, the Department does not have the\n\npower to force the project sureties to pay Rasins. While the Department must require prime\n\ncontractors to post bond by obtaining a surety to guarantee payments to subcontractors, see Mich.\n\nComp. Laws § 570.101, an unpaid subcontractor’s remedy is to sue the surety, not to request that the\n\nDepartment compel the surety to pay, see Mich. Comp. Laws § 570.104. Rasins failed to exercise\n\nits opportunity to seek payment from the sureties. A subcontractor may submit a lien claim to the\n\nDepartment in order to notify the project surety of non-payment, but the surety is the party that must\n\nensure that all payments are made and that must be sued if a dispute arises.\n\n       Thus, the question that remains is whether Rasins had standing to demand that the\n\nDepartment use the remaining methods at its disposal—withholding future payments and restricting\n\neligibility to bid on future projects—to sanction the prime contractors.\n\n                                                 IV.\n\n       The Supreme Court has stated that “the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing\n\ncontains three elements”: (1) an “injury in fact”; (2) “a causal connection between the injury and the\n\nconduct complained of”; and (3) that “the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.” Lujan\n\nv.

Michigan Dep’t of Transp.\n\nMoreover, “[t]he party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing these elements.”\n\nId. at 561. The Department does not dispute that Rasins has an injury in fact—its unpaid fees in the\n\namount of $491,176.60. The case turns on elements (2) and (3) of the standing analysis—whether\n\nthe Department was the cause of Rasins’s injury and whether the relief that Rasins seeks will redress\n\nthat injury.\n\n        With regard to causation, the Supreme Court has elaborated that the injury must be “fairly\n\n. . . trace[able] to the challenged action of the defendant, and not . . . th[e] result [of] the independent\n\naction of some third party not before the court.” Id. at 560 (alteration in original) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted). Rasins’s injury is not fairly traceable to the Department. The prime contractors\n\ncaused Rasins’s injury when they refused to pay Rasins and thus the injury is the result of an\n\nindependent action of some third party not before the court. In fact, the Department’s actions about\n\nwhich Rasins now complains—failing to sanction the prime contractors—occurred well after the\n\nprime contractors inflicted Rasins’s injury. In effect, Rasins’s allegations do not show that the\n\nDepartment caused its injury; rather, they show that after third parties injured Rasins, the Department\n\nfailed to order those that truly caused Rasins’s injury to make recompense.\n\n        This case presents an unfortunate set of circumstances, but Rasins has sued the wrong party,\n\nbringing before the court a government entity whose failure to enforce its regulations did not cause\n\nRasins’s injury.

To permit Rasins’s error to create\n\njurisdiction seems especially unnecessary given that all Rasins needed to do to recoup its money was\n\nto sue the project surety. It is unclear why Rasins, rather than going after the parties that actually\n\ninjured it—or the sureties insuring them—has chosen to blame the Department for its losses. As the\n\nAllen court put it, “[t]he links in the chain of causation between the challenged Government conduct\n\nand the asserted injury are far too weak for the chain as a whole to sustain [Rasins’s] standing.”\n\nAllen, 468 U.S. at 759.\n\n       While the inquiry could end here, it is also worth noting that Rasins has not established the\n\nthird element required for standing—redressability. The Supreme Court has stated that “it must be\n\nlikely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.”\n\nLujan, 504 U.S. at 561 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Supreme Court has also noted that\n\nwhen “a plaintiff’s asserted injury arises from the government’s allegedly unlawful regulation (or\n\nlack of regulation) of someone else,” a likelihood of redressability is “substantially more difficult\n\nto establish,” as it “depends on the unfettered choices made by independent actors not before the\n\ncourts and whose exercise of broad and legitimate discretion the courts cannot presume either to\n\ncontrol or to predict.” Id. at 562 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n       In this case, Rasins bears the burden of demonstrating that it is likely, rather than merely\n\nspeculative, that a court ordering the Department to issue sanctions would redress Rasins’s injury\n\nand result in the collection of the money owed. Rasins’s only attempt at a redressability argument\n\nis the conclusory statement that “[o]nly a willfully irrational prime contractor would withhold\n\n                                                -6-\n\fNo. 11-2176\nRasins Landscape & Assocs., Inc. v. Michigan Dep’t of Transp.\n\npayments in the face of [the Department’s] sanctions.” Other than this unsupported statement,\n\nRasins offers no evidence to demonstrate that a prime contractor would likely pay its debts rather\n\nthan suffer sanctions.\n\n        Rasins has failed to develop a record that supports its claims, as it is unclear that a prime\n\ncontractor would pay its debts even if sanctioned. Some of the debtor-contractors owe large sums\n\nof money to Rasins and thus payment to Raisin may cost more than the threatened sanctions. Some\n\nmay no longer be solvent or in business. Some may have already received all payments owed to\n\nthem by the Department such that the Department’s threat to withhold future payments would not\n\nprompt payment. And some may not anticipate bidding on future Michigan government contracts\n\nsuch that the Department’s revocation of bidding privileges would similarly fail to compel payment.\n\nHowever unfortunate Rasins’s circumstances may be, what is clear is that we cannot make a\n\ndetermination that it is likely, rather than merely speculative, that a favorable decision from this court\n\nwill redress Rasins’s injuries. In sum, Rasins has failed to carry its burden of proving redressability.\n\n        For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  -7-\n\f</pre>",
