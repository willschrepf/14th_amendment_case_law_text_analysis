Its progress has been recorded at several stages in opinions by the able District Judge, by this Court, and by the Supreme Court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  In August, 1973, the district court ordered the parties then in this case--the plaintiffs, the defendant School Board, and the United States--to submit proposals for further desegregation of the Montgomery County system in light of decisions by this Court and the Supreme Court since the entry in 1970 of the last comprehensive order in the case.  One week later, plaintiffs-intervenors, Jenkins, et al., filed their motion to intervene, which was granted in February, 1974.  During the first four months of 1974, plaintiffs, plaintiffs-intervenors, and the School Board each prepared and proposed new pupil assignment plans.  Hearings were held on each plan in April.  The School Board amended its plan in response to prodding from the Bench, and in an order entered May 22, 1974, and opinion reported at 377 F.Supp. 1123, the district court adopted the School Board plan, as amended, in its entirety.  Costs were taxed half against the plaintiffs and half against the plaintiffs-intervenors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs, the plaintiffs-intervenors, and the United States appeal, arguing between them that the district court erred in adopting the School Board's plan for the assignment of elementary and high school students, that the School Board assignment plan saddles black elementary school students with a disproportionate transportation burden, and that costs should have been taxed against the School Board.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I would hold that the district court should not have adopted the School Board's proposed assignment plan for the elementary grades because it fell short of establishing a unitary school system, and there was no sufficient finding that no workable alternative could be implemented.  The record indicates additionally that the School Board plan for the assignment of junior high students, as implemented, fails to comply with constitutional mandates.  Accordingly, I would remand to the district court for further proceedings to develop workable unitary school assignment plans for the elementary and junior high grades.  In light of this I would find it unnecessary at this time to pass on the appellants' claims of unequal transportation burdens.  I would vacate the district court's award of costs in favor of the School Board, to permit the entry of an appropriate award after the further proceedings on remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>* Background</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the 1973-74 term, Montgomery County public schools enrolled 36.016 students, 17,042 (47%) of whom were black, and 18,974 (53%) white, in some 54 regular schools, organized along a 1-6, 7-9, 10-12 pattern.  The 36 elementary schools enrolled 18,449 students (9,279, or 50%, black), the 13 junior high schools, 9,644 (4,390, or 45%, black), and the 5 high schools 7,923 (3,373, or 43%), black)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  All but 7 of the schools then in sue stood within the corporate limits of the City of Montgomery, and the total county population is similarly concentrated within the City.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The student population residing in the area of Montgomery County outside the City is predominantly black.  Within the City the student population is predominantly white:  the eastern half of the City is more concentratedly white;  most of the western half is virtually all-black;  and a narrow integrated corridor running North-South bisects the City.  Under the desegregation plan adopted in 1970 and effective in 1973-74, most pupils within the City were assigned to neighborhood schools.  Outside the City, school children in all but the extreme south of the county<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> were organized into \"periphery zones.\"   Most of these \"periphery zones.\"   Most of these \"periphery zone\" students were bused to schools in the City, and they made up the majority of the 11,176 students (31%) bused by the county.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Implementation of the neighborhood-assignment based plan adopted in 1970 left a high number of all-one-race or virtually all-one-race schools.  The record discloses that in the Spring of 1974, 15 elementary schools were 87% or more black, and 6 were 87% or more white;  6 junior highs were 94% or more black, another was 85% black, and 1 was 90% white;  1 senior high was 99% black, and another was 86% black.  Responding to these conditions, in its order below the district court replaced its 1970 plan with the School Board's most current proposal.  That plan adheres to the techniques employed in the 1970 plan, and, unlike the plans suggested by the plaintiffs and plaintiffs-intervenors, eschews pairing or clustering of schools.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the high school level, the School Board plan employes rezoning and peripheral reassignments to reduce the percentages of black students at each City school to 33-48%;  only Montgomery County High School, in the extreme south of the County, retains an 87% black student body.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  None of the appellants question the propriety of this high school plan, and it requires no further discussion.  Rather, this appeal was brought to test the constitutional sufficiency of the School Board's student assignment plans for the elementary and junior high levels.  I will discuss each of the two educational stages in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>Elementary School Plan</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs and plaintiffs-intervenors each proposed alternative plans for assignment of elementary school students.  Each plan aimed at eliminating \"racially identifiable\" schools, defined at the outset by each plan's architect as a school whose racial balance varied more than 10-15% from the racial make-up of the county-wide student body for that level.  Neither plan clung strictly to such statistical profiles, however, and each left at least one virtually all-black elementary school.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs' plan was directed only toward the elementary schools within the City.  It generally retained the zone lines drawn by the School Board, but changed assigned patterns within those zones through pairing and clustering, and some modification of peripheral assignments, to reach a 24-66% black concentration in each city school.  The district court calculated that implementation of the plaintiffs' plan would require reassignment of 43% of the elementary school population and additional transportation of 28% of the elementary student body.  The district court concluded that the plaintiffs' plan was designed \"for the sole purpose of attaining a strict racial balance in each elementary school involved,\" 377 F.Supp. at 1129, and that the increased busing, large scale reassignment of students and teachers, and the \"fracturization of grade structure\" inherent in pairing and clustering, \"be disruptive to the educational processes and would place an excessive and unnecessarily heavy administrative burden on the school system.\"   Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs-intervenors proposed a more complicated overhaul of elementary school assignments.  Their plans abandoned the School Board zone lines, replacing them with two sets of new zones:  one set of strip zones, running generally North-South, for grades 1-3;  another set of strip zones, running generally East-West, for grades 4-6.  Utilizing this basic network the plaintiffs-intervenors offered two possible plans.  The simpler plan merely assigned students to the school within their proposed continuous zone.  This left 400 black students in grades 4-6 in a school 81% black, and 2233 of the black primary grade 1-3 children in schools 84% or more black.  The plaintiffs-intervenors' alternative, and preferred, plan retained their grade 4-6 zone pattern and the single 81% black school, but added satellite zoning to the primary grade assignments, reducing to 402 the total of black students in one 84% black primary school.  The plaintiffs-intervenors' plan offered transportation advantages over the plaintiffs' plan, requiring additional busing for only 11% of the elementary school students, according to the district court.  There was evidence that the plaintiffs-intervenors' plan would prove the more likely thwarted in practice, however, and the district court found that implementation of either of the plaintiffs-intervenors' plans would involve reassignment of 60-70% of all of the elementary school population.  The district court entered no specific findings as to the workability of the plaintiffs-intervenors' plans.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The School Board plan adopted by the district court for the assignment of elementary school children furthers desegregation by closing 5 previously virtually all-black elementary schools and assigning some pupils from those schools to predominantly white schools, and by reassigning some 400 black students at another virtually all-black school to 4 predominantly white schools.  Under this plan, however, 55% of the black students were projected to be enrolled at elementary schools 87% or more black, and 44% were expected to attend elementary schools 87% or more black, and 44% were expected to attend elementary schools 93% or more black.  The statistics showing actual enrollment as of September 15, 1974, demonstrate that the true profiles are slightly worse.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Under the School Board plan no white elementary school students were reassigned to a school that would remain predominantly black.  The School Board estimated that its elementary school plan would produce a significant net reduction of transportation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p>* Unitary School System</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the Supreme Court established in Green v. School Bd. of New Kent County, 1968, 391 U.S. 430, 436, 88 S.Ct. 1689, 1693, 20 L.Ed.2d 716, 722, \"The transition to a unitary, nonracial system of public education ... is the ultimate end to be brought about\" in school desegregation cases.  In this pursuit the school authorities and district court \"will ... necessarily be concerned with the elimination of one-race schools.\"   Swann v. Charlotte-Mechlenburg Bd. of Educ., 1971, 402 U.S. 1, 26, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 1281, 28 L.Ed.2d 554, 572.  The district court, relying on Ellis v. Board of Public Instruc. of Orange County, 5 Cir.1970, 423 F.2d 203 (Ellis I ), concluded, however, that the persistence of virtually all-black elementary schools in Montgomery County under the School Board's \"neighborhood assignment\" plan did not prevent that system from reaching the unitary status mandated by Green.   I disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ellis I approved, as modified,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> a student desegregation plan for Orange County, Florida, which was based on neighborhood school assignments and left several virtually all-black schools.  We held that \"[u]nder the facts of this case, it happens that the school board's choice of a neighborhood assignment system is adequate to convert the Orange County school system from a dual to a unitary system.\"  423 F.2d at 208, n. 7.  Ellis I did not, however, automatically sanctify any \"neighborhood school\" student assignment plan which placed the same percentages of students in fully integrated schools.  Rather, as we explicitly cautioned,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p>There are many variables in the student assignment approach necessary to bring about unitary school systems.  The answer in each case turns, in the final analysis, as here, on all of the facts including those which are peculiar to the particular system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">423 F.2d at 208, n. 7.  This passage has become a refrain in our school desegregation decisions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Indeed, our school desegregation cases are too numerous, their facts, figures, and conditions too particular, and our remedies too flexibly fashioned, to lend themselves to a simple sorting into neat rows.  But I believe that the weight of our pre- Swann decisions adopting and adapting the neighborhood assignment approach of Ellis I do not permit us to certify the School Board's plan for Montgomery as the achievement of a unitary system.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  As we concluded in Allen v. Board of Public Instruc. of Broward County, 5 Cir.1970, 432 F.2d 362, \"In the conversion from dual school systems based on race to unitary school systems, the continued existence of all-black or virtually all-black schools is unacceptable where reasonable alternatives exist.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even were the School Board's plan adequate to achieve a unitary school system under Ellis I and the cases immediately following it, however, I think it manifest that the School Board's plan cannot stand after Swann;  Davis v. Board of School Comm'rs of Mobile County, 1971, 402 U.S. 33, 91 S.Ct. 1289, 28 L.Ed.2d 577, and Keyes v. School District No. 1, 1973, 413 U.S. 189, 93 S.Ct. 2686, 37 L.Ed.2d 548.  Swann shed new light on the constitutional requisites in school desegregation cases, and since Swann we have refused to accept mere compliance with our decision in Ellis I as the mark of a school board plan's constitutional sufficiency.  Indeed, we held in Ellis v. Board of Public Instruc. of Orange County, 5 Cir.1972, 465 F.2d 878, cert. denied, 1973, 410 U.S. 966, 93 S.Ct. 1438, 35 L.Ed.2d 700 (Ellis II ), that the school board was obliged to desegregate each all-black school remaining in Orange County under our prior holding.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  See also Dandridge v. Jefferson Parish School Bd., 5 Cir.1972, 456 F.2d 552, 554,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> cert. denied, 1972, 409 U.S. 978, 93 S.Ct. 306, 34 L.Ed.2d 240.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The concentration of black students in virtually all-black schools contradicts the assertion that the School Board's plan for Montgomery establishes a unitary school system under these controlling standards.  Compare, e.g., Swann, supra;  Davis, supra;  Ellis II, supra;  Flax v. Potts, 5 Cir.1972, 464 F.2d 865, 869, cert. denied, 1972, 409 U.S. 1007, 93 S.Ct. 433, 34 L.Ed.2d 299 (middle schools, high schools);  Dandridge v. Jefferson Parish School Bd., 5 Cir.1972, 456 F.2d 552, cert. denied, 1972, 409 SU.S. 978, 93 S.Ct. 306, 34 L.Ed.2d 240;  cases cited, note 9 supra;  see also Keyes v. School Dist. No. 1, 1973, 413 U.S. 189, 199, n. 10, 93 S.Ct. 2686, 2692, 37 L.Ed.2d 548, 558.  The teaching of Swann and Keyes is that no school which reflects vestigal discrimination through its virtually discrimination through its virtually single-race student body can be omitted from a desegregation plan unless inclusion is unworkable;  where desegregation is possible we can tolerate no abandonment of some given portion of students locked into a uniracial educational experience.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In appraising a school board's plan we are, of course, attentive to conditions other than racial concentrations.  I cannot agree, however, with the suggestion that compliance with the remaining five of the six requirements established in Green v. School Board of New Kent County, 1968, 391 U.S. 430, 435, 88 S.Ct. 1689, 1693, 20 L.Ed.2d 716, 722--\"can immunize the School Board's plan.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  So to conclude would ignore that \"[in Green the court spoke in terms of the whole system,\" Ellis I, 423 F.2d at 204, and would disregard the recognition that student assignment is the most important single aspect of a desegregated school system.  Our cases have always required compliance with all six particulars.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  The School Board additionally argues that the secondary schools in Montgomery County are desegregated, and points out that we have taken note of thorough integration at the secondary level, in some cases approving assignment plans which left some all-black primary schools.

Even assuming arguendo that the secondary schools in Montgomery County were fully integrated, we would as in the pre- Swann cases relied upon by the School Board, attach little weight to that consideration.

A review of the circumstances of the Montgomery County system, particularly the concentration of black elementary students in virtually all-black schools, reveals that the School Board plan approved by the district court was insufficient to achieve a unitary school system as required under Green and Swann.

Because the district court's opinion offers no supporting discussion, it is unclear whether the district court believed that the present existence of virtually all-black schools could be laid in part to residential patterns established during the period of statutory school segregation yet not induced by that state action, or that the development of racially identifiable neighborhoods since the onset of efforts to integrate the schools had precipitated the virtually all-black schools.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a>  In either event, I think the district court erred in its legal determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aware that \"[p]eople gravitate toward school facilities, just as schools are located in response to the needs of people,\" the Supreme Court has recognized that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p>[t]he location of schools may ... influence the patterns of residential development of a metropolitan area and have important impact on composition of inner-city neighborhoods.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p>In the past, choices in this respect have been used as a potent weapon for creating or maintaining a state-segregated school system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Swann, 402 U.S. at 20, 21, 91 S.Ct. at 1278, 28 L.Ed.2d at 569.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p>[A] connection between past segregative acts and present segregation may be present even when not apparent and ... close examination is required before concluding that the connection does not exist.

Upon determining that none of the alternatives presented was satisfactory, the district court should have held further proceedings to forge a workable and effective plan.  See Cisneros v.

The district court simply specified the total of children to be reassigned and the number of students to be newly bused under the plaintiffs' and plaintiffs-intervenors' plans;  observed without any specific findings that busing would involve a substantial increase in the time and distance that students would have to travel to school;  and then concluded that the plaintiffs'--but not the plaintiff-intervenors'--plan \"would be disruptive to the educational processes and would place an excessive and unnecessarily heavy administrative burden on the school system.\"   These findings are an inadequate foundation on which to rest either a determination of the unworkability of the proposed plans or a conclusion that no improvement of the Board's solution could be obtained.  Nor does the fact of the record reveal any inherent obstacle to the progress of all further desegregation in Montgomery through the instruments of zoning, pairing, and busing.  Each of these tools has been approved in Swann, 402 U.S. at 27-29, 91 S.Ct. at 1281-82, 28 L.Ed.2d at 573-74, and Cisneros v. Corpus Christi Indep.  School Dist., 5 Cir.

The record fails to indicate in any way how Montgomery's situation differs from the conditions existing in any of the many other school districts in which we have specified that these meansures be employed.  Indeed, examination of the record suggest the feasability of their utilization in several instances.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a>  Accordingly, I would hold that the district court erred in approving the School Board plan, and remand the cause for implementation of a constitutionally sufficient plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To summarize, I would hold that the district court erred in adopting the School Board plan, because that plan falls short of the constitutional mark, and because there is no indication of the unworkability of a Constitutional remedy.  I do not believe the district court's result can be upheld on any of the argument advanced, whether independently or cumulatively considered.  If there be no other way to desegregate, the tools of pairing and clustering must be used to relieve the barricaded and beleagured blacks from their school garrisons.  These mixing mechanisms have received judicial blessing, and they must be employed unless manifestly unusable for constitutional reasons.  Other innovations may be considered.  Nothing to achieve the constitutional mandate to desegregate can be avoided because of whimsy, white flight and fright, inconvenience, annoyance or any other actual or conjured excuse.  Desegregation of education is a constitutional necessity and not an optional luxury, and bland generalities will not suffice to justify segregated schools.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I would be unwilling to require the immediate implementation of any of the alternative elementary school plans presented, however, in light of the district court's determination that the plans of the plaintiffs and plaintiffs-intervenors were generated to achieve racial ratios beyond and in contravention of the mandate of Swann, in light of the state of the record, and in light of the opportunity remaining for the district court to define and meld the various plans before it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31\" id=\"fn31_ref\">31</a>  Rather I would remand the case to the district court for further proceedings to develop a proper plan.  We have in the past required specific and detailed findings to accompany the district court's selection of a desegregation remedy that promises to be less effective than alternative plans for establishing a unitary school system.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fn32_ref\">32</a>  This requirement is meant to secure to the reviewing court the full advantages of the factual appraisals and perspective of the particularly well-situated trail court, in order to maximize the benefits of the district court's informed discretion.  Cf. Brown v. Board of Educ. of Topeka, 1955, 349 U.S. 294, 299-300, 75 S.Ct. 753, 755-756, 99 L.Ed. 1083, 1105-06 (Brown II).  Thus I would direct that, if the district court should approve on remand a plan less than fully effective in establishing a unitary school system in Montgomery County, it must support its conclusion with precise and detailed findings of fact, keeping in mind Swann's heavy burden upon officials to legitimate any less than thorough desegregation plan on ground of unworkability.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn33\" id=\"fn33_ref\">33</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p>All things being equal, with no history of discrimination, it might well be desirable to assign pupils to schools nearest their homes.  But all things are not equal in a system that has been deliberately constructed and maintained to enforce racial segregation.  The remedy for such segregation may be administratively awkward, inconvenient, and even bizarre in some situations and may impose burdens on some;  but all awkwardness and inconvenience cannot be avoided in the interim period when remedial adjustments are being made to eliminate the dual school systems.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">402 U.S. at 28, 91 S.Ct. at 1282, 28 L.Ed.2d at 573.  Many practicalities affect the judgment and aims of school authorities in pursuing their daily occupation of maintaining a pragmatic educational system.  But when the constitutionally mandated establishment of a unitary school system rests in the balance, workaday practicalities are no longer determinative factors.  The conservation of such daily efficiencies may have been a considered objective in the days of Plessy v. Ferguson, 1896, 163 U.S. 537, 16 S.Ct. 1138, 41 L.Ed. 256, but Brown v. Board of Educ. of Topeka, 1954, 347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873 (Brown I), has taken us down a new road.  Brown and its post-adolescent progeny have imposed upon school authorities and courts and affirmative duty to see that such stumbling blocks in the path of desegregation are relegated to a footnote in history.  As we observed in a prior Montgomery case,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn34\" id=\"fn34_ref\">34</a> \"This obligation is unremitting, and there can be no abdication, no matter how temporary.\"   A school board's plan may have any number of advantages when appraised in ordinary perspective, but these give way where they impeded the progress of desegregation;  convenience as well as custom must bend to constitutional prescription.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given my resolution of this aspect of the attack on the School Board's plan for the elementary grades, I would find it unnecessary to consider at this time whether that plan imposes a discriminatorily harsh burden on the black students.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>Junior High School Plan</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The junior high school student assignment plan in effect in the Spring of 1974 left over half of the black students in 7 junior high schools which were over 85% black.  The School Board plan, as implemented by the district court, proposed to reduce this concentration through rezoning, peripheral reassignments, and the elimination of three black schools;  the district court projected that McIntyre Junior High, enrolling 792 of the County's black junior high students (18%) would remain the only high facility<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn35\" id=\"fn35_ref\">35</a> more than 80% black under the School Board plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both the plaintiffs and plaintiffs-intervenors submitted alternative plans for desegregation at the junior high level.  The plaintiffs proposed to modify the basic School Board plan through additional busing to achieve a closer racial balance at McIntyre and two other junior high schools left substantially black under the Board plan, Bellingrath and Baldwin.  The plaintiffs-intervenors projected a 65% black student body at McIntyre, and a less than 60% black enrollment at each of 8 other junior high schools within the City, under a plan of new elongated but continuous strip zones, with transportation to be provided within each zone where necessary.  In adopting the School Board plan for the junior high schools, the district court dismissed these alternative proposals as too inflexibly wedded to abstract racial balancing, and suggested that they were unfeasible.  Emphasizing the insolation of McIntyre as the only virtually all-black junior high remaining under the School Board plan, the district court held that \"under the circumstances that exist in the Montgomery school system\" no further requirement of desegregation could be imposed upon the County.  377 F.Supp. at 1139.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn36\" id=\"fn36_ref\">36</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unfortunately, the data revealing the actual desegregation at the junior high schools accomplished under the School Board plan, as of September 15, 1974, show that \"the circumstances\" have changed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn37\" id=\"fn37_ref\">37</a>  False to predictions, the student body of McIntyre Junior High is 98% black, Baldwin is 85% black, and Bellingrath is, as I compute it,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn38\" id=\"fn38_ref\">38</a> 81% black.  Thus, more than a quarter of the black junior high school students in the City<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn39\" id=\"fn39_ref\">39</a> are locked in schools 85% or more black, and nearly 40% in schools 80% or more black.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I would not pass now on the academic question of the acceptability of the School Board plan as proposed and implemented by the district court.  It is now clear that the School Board plan has been unsuccessful, as implemented, in accomplishing desegregation at the junior high level,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn40\" id=\"fn40_ref\">40</a> and there is no indication on the record that the present circumstances are beyond remedy.  As the previous discussion of the elementary school plan should make clear, the School Board plan for the junior high schools cannot stand as it appears, unless improvement is unworkable.  The record does not suggest what remedial plan might be employed at this stage.  I would leave that difficulty for resolution by the district court, following whatever further proceedings it might find to be necessary.  I would emphasize again, however, that the district court's order should be accompanied with supporting findings and conclusions of sufficient precision and detail to fully apprise a reviewing court of its reasons and understanding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV</p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We deal here with a school system whose roots were segregated by law.  There is no indication that those roots have withered away, and that the racial separation in the present system is anything but the fruit of a tainted crop.  The School Board still plans to cultivate its gardens separately;  and it does not promise ever to integrate in any future season.  Rather, its plan guarantees perennial one-race educational experiences for over a third of the black students within its elementary and junior high schools.  Desegregation is not impossible in Montgomery.  It might be uncomfortable, expensive, disturbing, or even disconcerting.  But these words are not amendments to the Fourteenth Amendment's commands.  Much progress has been made in Montgomery school desegregation, but medals earned for past performance cannot justify contemporary failure.  I am confident that our respected, scholarly, and courageous trial judge did not hesitate to apply the law correctly as he saw it to the facts before him in Montgomery.  I firmly believe, however, that that view of the law is erroneous and in conflict with previous decisions of this Court and the Supreme Court of the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I would reverse the order of the district court insofar as it adopts and implements the School Board plans for elementary and junior high schools in Montgomery County, and remand the cause for such further proceedings as would be necessary to bring Montgomery County to a unitary system.  In order to permit the district court to reconsider its award of costs against the plaintiffs and plaintiffs-intervenors in light of further proceedings, I would vacate the judgment awarding costs in favor of the School Board.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <pre>                                  APPENDIX A\n                                  ----------\n   Adoption of the School Board plan produces the following profiles of the\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       elementary school student bodies:\n                       ---------------------------------\n                            Projected Enrollment    Actual Enrollment 9/15/74 a\n                           -----------------------  ---------------------------\n                 Normal\n               ----------\nSchool          Capacity   Black   White   % Black   Black     White    % Black\n-------------  ----------  ------  ------  -------  --------  --------  -------\nBear             630          186     505      27%    185       407         31%\nBellinger        300          186      43      81%    211        35         86%\n  Hill\nBellingrath    1,230 b        115     100      53%    115 c     100 c       53%\nB.

(The plaintiffs-intervenors assert that the opinion below is clearly erroneous in its computation of busing required under their junior high plan;  I would not pass on the issue at this time.)

Actual enrollment as of September 15, 1974, listed by the School Board is a combined total of (681 black, 230 white) students;  no breakdown is given as to grade levels.  The total actual attendance at Bellingrath is considerably lower than the total projected attendance.  The net over-projection is 93 black students (12% of projection), and 260 white students (53% of projection).  In estimating actual attendance, I have, conservatively, attributed the total decrease to the junior high level, where the enrollment was projected to be 62% black, and for which the zone was to be significantly shifted for 1974-75.

Its progress has been recorded at several stages in opinions by the able District Judge, by this Court, and by the Supreme Court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  In August, 1973, the district court ordered the parties then in this case--the plaintiffs, the defendant School Board, and the United States--to submit proposals for further desegregation of the Montgomery County system in light of decisions by this Court and the Supreme Court since the entry in 1970 of the last comprehensive order in the case.  One week later, plaintiffs-intervenors, Jenkins, et al., filed their motion to intervene, which was granted in February, 1974.  During the first four months of 1974, plaintiffs, plaintiffs-intervenors, and the School Board each prepared and proposed new pupil assignment plans.  Hearings were held on each plan in April.  The School Board amended its plan in response to prodding from the Bench, and in an order entered May 22, 1974, and opinion reported at <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2343228\"><a href=\"/opinion/2343228/carr-v-montgomery-county-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">377</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1123</span></a></span>, the district court adopted the School Board plan, as amended, in its entirety.  Costs were taxed half against the plaintiffs and half against the plaintiffs-intervenors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs, the plaintiffs-intervenors, and the United States appeal, arguing between them that the district court erred in adopting the School Board's plan for the assignment of elementary and high school students, that the School Board assignment plan saddles black elementary school students with a disproportionate transportation burden, and that costs should have been taxed against the School Board.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I would hold that the district court should not have adopted the School Board's proposed assignment plan for the elementary grades because it fell short of establishing a unitary school system, and there was no sufficient finding that no workable alternative could be implemented.  The record indicates additionally that the School Board plan for the assignment of junior high students, as implemented, fails to comply with constitutional mandates.  Accordingly, I would remand to the district court for further proceedings to develop workable unitary school assignment plans for the elementary and junior high grades.  In light of this I would find it unnecessary at this time to pass on the appellants' claims of unequal transportation burdens.  I would vacate the district court's award of costs in favor of the School Board, to permit the entry of an appropriate award after the further proceedings on remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>* Background</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the 1973-74 term, Montgomery County public schools enrolled 36.016 students, 17,042 (47%) of whom were black, and 18,974 (53%) white, in some 54 regular schools, organized along a 1-6, 7-9, 10-12 pattern.  The 36 elementary schools enrolled 18,449 students (9,279, or 50%, black), the 13 junior high schools, 9,644 (4,390, or 45%, black), and the 5 high schools 7,923 (3,373, or 43%), black)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  All but 7 of the schools then in sue stood within the corporate limits of the City of Montgomery, and the total county population is similarly concentrated within the City.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The student population residing in the area of Montgomery County outside the City is predominantly black.  Within the City the student population is predominantly white:  the eastern half of the City is more concentratedly white;  most of the western half is virtually all-black;  and a narrow integrated corridor running North-South bisects the City.  Under the desegregation plan adopted in 1970 and effective in 1973-74, most pupils within the City were assigned to neighborhood schools.  Outside the City, school children in all but the extreme south of the county<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> were organized into \"periphery zones.\"   Most of these \"periphery zones.\"   Most of these \"periphery zone\" students were bused to schools in the City, and they made up the majority of the 11,176 students (31%) bused by the county.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Implementation of the neighborhood-assignment based plan adopted in 1970 left a high number of all-one-race or virtually all-one-race schools.  The record discloses that in the Spring of 1974, 15 elementary schools were 87% or more black, and 6 were 87% or more white;  6 junior highs were 94% or more black, another was 85% black, and 1 was 90% white;  1 senior high was 99% black, and another was 86% black.  Responding to these conditions, in its order below the district court replaced its 1970 plan with the School Board's most current proposal.  That plan adheres to the techniques employed in the 1970 plan, and, unlike the plans suggested by the plaintiffs and plaintiffs-intervenors, eschews pairing or clustering of schools.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the high school level, the School Board plan employes rezoning and peripheral reassignments to reduce the percentages of black students at each City school to 33-48%;  only Montgomery County High School, in the extreme south of the County, retains an 87% black student body.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  None of the appellants question the propriety of this high school plan, and it requires no further discussion.  Rather, this appeal was brought to test the constitutional sufficiency of the School Board's student assignment plans for the elementary and junior high levels.  I will discuss each of the two educational stages in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>Elementary School Plan</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs and plaintiffs-intervenors each proposed alternative plans for assignment of elementary school students.  Each plan aimed at eliminating \"racially identifiable\" schools, defined at the outset by each plan's architect as a school whose racial balance varied more than 10-15% from the racial make-up of the county-wide student body for that level.  Neither plan clung strictly to such statistical profiles, however, and each left at least one virtually all-black elementary school.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs' plan was directed only toward the elementary schools within the City.  It generally retained the zone lines drawn by the School Board, but changed assigned patterns within those zones through pairing and clustering, and some modification of peripheral assignments, to reach a 24-66% black concentration in each city school.  The district court calculated that implementation of the plaintiffs' plan would require reassignment of 43% of the elementary school population and additional transportation of 28% of the elementary student body.  The district court concluded that the plaintiffs' plan was designed \"for the sole purpose of attaining a strict racial balance in each elementary school involved,\" 377 F.Supp. at 1129, and that the increased busing, large scale reassignment of students and teachers, and the \"fracturization of grade structure\" inherent in pairing and clustering, \"be disruptive to the educational processes and would place an excessive and unnecessarily heavy administrative burden on the school system.\"   Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs-intervenors proposed a more complicated overhaul of elementary school assignments.  Their plans abandoned the School Board zone lines, replacing them with two sets of new zones:  one set of strip zones, running generally North-South, for grades 1-3;  another set of strip zones, running generally East-West, for grades 4-6.  Utilizing this basic network the plaintiffs-intervenors offered two possible plans.  The simpler plan merely assigned students to the school within their proposed continuous zone.  This left 400 black students in grades 4-6 in a school 81% black, and 2233 of the black primary grade 1-3 children in schools 84% or more black.  The plaintiffs-intervenors' alternative, and preferred, plan retained their grade 4-6 zone pattern and the single 81% black school, but added satellite zoning to the primary grade assignments, reducing to 402 the total of black students in one 84% black primary school.  The plaintiffs-intervenors' plan offered transportation advantages over the plaintiffs' plan, requiring additional busing for only 11% of the elementary school students, according to the district court.  There was evidence that the plaintiffs-intervenors' plan would prove the more likely thwarted in practice, however, and the district court found that implementation of either of the plaintiffs-intervenors' plans would involve reassignment of 60-70% of all of the elementary school population.  The district court entered no specific findings as to the workability of the plaintiffs-intervenors' plans.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The School Board plan adopted by the district court for the assignment of elementary school children furthers desegregation by closing 5 previously virtually all-black elementary schools and assigning some pupils from those schools to predominantly white schools, and by reassigning some 400 black students at another virtually all-black school to 4 predominantly white schools.  Under this plan, however, 55% of the black students were projected to be enrolled at elementary schools 87% or more black, and 44% were expected to attend elementary schools 87% or more black, and 44% were expected to attend elementary schools 93% or more black.  The statistics showing actual enrollment as of September 15, 1974, demonstrate that the true profiles are slightly worse.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Under the School Board plan no white elementary school students were reassigned to a school that would remain predominantly black.  The School Board estimated that its elementary school plan would produce a significant net reduction of transportation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p>* Unitary School System</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the Supreme Court established in Green v.

The teaching of Swann and Keyes is that no school which reflects vestigal discrimination through its virtually discrimination through its virtually single-race student body can be omitted from a desegregation plan unless inclusion is unworkable;  where desegregation is possible we can tolerate no abandonment of some given portion of students locked into a uniracial educational experience.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In appraising a school board's plan we are, of course, attentive to conditions other than racial concentrations.

A review of the circumstances of the Montgomery County system, particularly the concentration of black elementary students in virtually all-black schools, reveals that the School Board plan approved by the district court was insufficient to achieve a unitary school system as required under Green and Swann.

Because the district court's opinion offers no supporting discussion, it is unclear whether the district court believed that the present existence of virtually all-black schools could be laid in part to residential patterns established during the period of statutory school segregation yet not induced by that state action, or that the development of racially identifiable neighborhoods since the onset of efforts to integrate the schools had precipitated the virtually all-black schools.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a>  In either event, I think the district court erred in its legal determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aware that \"[p]eople gravitate toward school facilities, just as schools are located in response to the needs of people,\" the Supreme Court has recognized that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p>[t]he location of schools may ... influence the patterns of residential development of a metropolitan area and have important impact on composition of inner-city neighborhoods.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p>In the past, choices in this respect have been used as a potent weapon for creating or maintaining a state-segregated school system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Swann, 402 U.S. at 20, 21, 91 S.Ct. at 1278, 28 L.Ed.2d at 569.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p>[A] connection between past segregative acts and present segregation may be present even when not apparent and ... close examination is required before concluding that the connection does not exist.

While there is must evidence of the residential separations between whites and blacks in Montgomery, which in some cases shows that those patterns are not new, evidence of this sort is insufficient to overcome the presumption established in Swann connecting the development of persistently segregated residential patterns with state-mandated school segregation.

Nor does the fact of the record reveal any inherent obstacle to the progress of all further desegregation in Montgomery through the instruments of zoning, pairing, and busing.

Indeed, examination of the record suggest the feasability of their utilization in several instances.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a>  Accordingly, I would hold that the district court erred in approving the School Board plan, and remand the cause for implementation of a constitutionally sufficient plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To summarize, I would hold that the district court erred in adopting the School Board plan, because that plan falls short of the constitutional mark, and because there is no indication of the unworkability of a Constitutional remedy.  I do not believe the district court's result can be upheld on any of the argument advanced, whether independently or cumulatively considered.  If there be no other way to desegregate, the tools of pairing and clustering must be used to relieve the barricaded and beleagured blacks from their school garrisons.  These mixing mechanisms have received judicial blessing, and they must be employed unless manifestly unusable for constitutional reasons.  Other innovations may be considered.  Nothing to achieve the constitutional mandate to desegregate can be avoided because of whimsy, white flight and fright, inconvenience, annoyance or any other actual or conjured excuse.  Desegregation of education is a constitutional necessity and not an optional luxury, and bland generalities will not suffice to justify segregated schools.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I would be unwilling to require the immediate implementation of any of the alternative elementary school plans presented, however, in light of the district court's determination that the plans of the plaintiffs and plaintiffs-intervenors were generated to achieve racial ratios beyond and in contravention of the mandate of Swann, in light of the state of the record, and in light of the opportunity remaining for the district court to define and meld the various plans before it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31\" id=\"fn31_ref\">31</a>  Rather I would remand the case to the district court for further proceedings to develop a proper plan.  We have in the past required specific and detailed findings to accompany the district court's selection of a desegregation remedy that promises to be less effective than alternative plans for establishing a unitary school system.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fn32_ref\">32</a>  This requirement is meant to secure to the reviewing court the full advantages of the factual appraisals and perspective of the particularly well-situated trail court, in order to maximize the benefits of the district court's informed discretion.

Board of Educ. of Topeka, 1955, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105312\"><a href=\"/opinion/105312/brown-v-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">349</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">294</span></a></span>, 299-300, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105312\"><a href=\"/opinion/105312/brown-v-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Thus I would direct that, if the district court should approve on remand a plan less than fully effective in establishing a unitary school system in Montgomery County, it must support its conclusion with precise and detailed findings of fact, keeping in mind Swann's heavy burden upon officials to legitimate any less than thorough desegregation plan on ground of unworkability.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn33\" id=\"fn33_ref\">33</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p>All things being equal, with no history of discrimination, it might well be desirable to assign pupils to schools nearest their homes.

The remedy for such segregation may be administratively awkward, inconvenient, and even bizarre in some situations and may impose burdens on some;  but all awkwardness and inconvenience cannot be avoided in the interim period when remedial adjustments are being made to eliminate the dual school systems.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">402 U.S. at 28, 91 S.Ct. at 1282, 28 L.Ed.2d at 573.  Many practicalities affect the judgment and aims of school authorities in pursuing their daily occupation of maintaining a pragmatic educational system.  But when the constitutionally mandated establishment of a unitary school system rests in the balance, workaday practicalities are no longer determinative factors.

Brown and its post-adolescent progeny have imposed upon school authorities and courts and affirmative duty to see that such stumbling blocks in the path of desegregation are relegated to a footnote in history.  As we observed in a prior Montgomery case,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn34\" id=\"fn34_ref\">34</a> \"This obligation is unremitting, and there can be no abdication, no matter how temporary.\"   A school board's plan may have any number of advantages when appraised in ordinary perspective, but these give way where they impeded the progress of desegregation;  convenience as well as custom must bend to constitutional prescription.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given my resolution of this aspect of the attack on the School Board's plan for the elementary grades, I would find it unnecessary to consider at this time whether that plan imposes a discriminatorily harsh burden on the black students.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>Junior High School Plan</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The junior high school student assignment plan in effect in the Spring of 1974 left over half of the black students in 7 junior high schools which were over 85% black.  The School Board plan, as implemented by the district court, proposed to reduce this concentration through rezoning, peripheral reassignments, and the elimination of three black schools;  the district court projected that McIntyre Junior High, enrolling 792 of the County's black junior high students (18%) would remain the only high facility<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn35\" id=\"fn35_ref\">35</a> more than 80% black under the School Board plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both the plaintiffs and plaintiffs-intervenors submitted alternative plans for desegregation at the junior high level.  The plaintiffs proposed to modify the basic School Board plan through additional busing to achieve a closer racial balance at McIntyre and two other junior high schools left substantially black under the Board plan, Bellingrath and Baldwin.  The plaintiffs-intervenors projected a 65% black student body at McIntyre, and a less than 60% black enrollment at each of 8 other junior high schools within the City, under a plan of new elongated but continuous strip zones, with transportation to be provided within each zone where necessary.  In adopting the School Board plan for the junior high schools, the district court dismissed these alternative proposals as too inflexibly wedded to abstract racial balancing, and suggested that they were unfeasible.  Emphasizing the insolation of McIntyre as the only virtually all-black junior high remaining under the School Board plan, the district court held that \"under the circumstances that exist in the Montgomery school system\" no further requirement of desegregation could be imposed upon the County.  377 F.Supp. at 1139.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn36\" id=\"fn36_ref\">36</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unfortunately, the data revealing the actual desegregation at the junior high schools accomplished under the School Board plan, as of September 15, 1974, show that \"the circumstances\" have changed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn37\" id=\"fn37_ref\">37</a>  False to predictions, the student body of McIntyre Junior High is 98% black, Baldwin is 85% black, and Bellingrath is, as I compute it,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn38\" id=\"fn38_ref\">38</a> 81% black.  Thus, more than a quarter of the black junior high school students in the City<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn39\" id=\"fn39_ref\">39</a> are locked in schools 85% or more black, and nearly 40% in schools 80% or more black.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I would not pass now on the academic question of the acceptability of the School Board plan as proposed and implemented by the district court.  It is now clear that the School Board plan has been unsuccessful, as implemented, in accomplishing desegregation at the junior high level,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn40\" id=\"fn40_ref\">40</a> and there is no indication on the record that the present circumstances are beyond remedy.  As the previous discussion of the elementary school plan should make clear, the School Board plan for the junior high schools cannot stand as it appears, unless improvement is unworkable.  The record does not suggest what remedial plan might be employed at this stage.  I would leave that difficulty for resolution by the district court, following whatever further proceedings it might find to be necessary.  I would emphasize again, however, that the district court's order should be accompanied with supporting findings and conclusions of sufficient precision and detail to fully apprise a reviewing court of its reasons and understanding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV</p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We deal here with a school system whose roots were segregated by law.  There is no indication that those roots have withered away, and that the racial separation in the present system is anything but the fruit of a tainted crop.  The School Board still plans to cultivate its gardens separately;  and it does not promise ever to integrate in any future season.  Rather, its plan guarantees perennial one-race educational experiences for over a third of the black students within its elementary and junior high schools.  Desegregation is not impossible in Montgomery.  It might be uncomfortable, expensive, disturbing, or even disconcerting.  But these words are not amendments to the Fourteenth Amendment's commands.  Much progress has been made in Montgomery school desegregation, but medals earned for past performance cannot justify contemporary failure.  I am confident that our respected, scholarly, and courageous trial judge did not hesitate to apply the law correctly as he saw it to the facts before him in Montgomery.  I firmly believe, however, that that view of the law is erroneous and in conflict with previous decisions of this Court and the Supreme Court of the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I would reverse the order of the district court insofar as it adopts and implements the School Board plans for elementary and junior high schools in Montgomery County, and remand the cause for such further proceedings as would be necessary to bring Montgomery County to a unitary system.  In order to permit the district court to reconsider its award of costs against the plaintiffs and plaintiffs-intervenors in light of further proceedings, I would vacate the judgment awarding costs in favor of the School Board.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <pre>                                  APPENDIX A\n                                  ----------\n   Adoption of the School Board plan produces the following profiles of the\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       elementary school student bodies:\n                       ---------------------------------\n                            Projected Enrollment    Actual Enrollment 9/15/74 a\n                           -----------------------  ---------------------------\n                 Normal\n               ----------\nSchool          Capacity   Black   White   % Black   Black     White    % Black\n-------------  ----------  ------  ------  -------  --------  --------  -------\nBear             630          186     505      27%    185       407         31%\nBellinger        300          186      43      81%    211        35         86%\n  Hill\nBellingrath    1,230 b        115     100      53%    115 c     100 c       53%\nB.

The apparent premise to this treatment is that \"[i]t is conceded by all parties that Montgomery County High School ... cannot be effectively desegregated because of its isolation.\"  377 F.Supp. at 1138, n. 37.  This conclusion is not contested here, although the plaintiffs-intervenors' plan did propose to reduce the junior high class at Montgomery County High from 92% to 82% black.

(The plaintiffs-intervenors assert that the opinion below is clearly erroneous in its computation of busing required under their junior high plan;  I would not pass on the issue at this time.)   The district court did not enter any findings regarding the proportion of students reassigned, projected to be reassigned, or newly transported under the School Board plan.  Nor does the opinion below reveal any specific conclusions regarding the significance of the burdens of reassigning or transporting additional students, except that the McIntyre facility \"is impossible to effectively desegregate in a stable and workable manner.\"  377 F.Supp. at 1132</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn37\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn37_ref\">37</a>\n        <p> See Appendix B.

According to the district court's opinion, projected attendance at the Bellingrath facility was to be 215 (115 black, 100 white) at the elementary level and 1049 (659 black, 390 white) at the junior high level.  Actual enrollment as of September 15, 1974, listed by the School Board is a combined total of (681 black, 230 white) students;  no breakdown is given as to grade levels.  The total actual attendance at Bellingrath is considerably lower than the total projected attendance.  The net over-projection is 93 black students (12% of projection), and 260 white students (53% of projection).  In estimating actual attendance, I have, conservatively, attributed the total decrease to the junior high level, where the enrollment was projected to be 62% black, and for which the zone was to be significantly shifted for 1974-75.  I would, of course, direct that on remand the district court proceed to determine the actual enrollment figures with certainty</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn39\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn39_ref\">39</a>\n        <p> These percentages do not include the junior high students at the Montgomery County Senior High facility.
