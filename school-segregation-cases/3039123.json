Jones delivered the decision of the Court, in which\nPresiding Judge Diane M. Johnsen and Judge Patricia A. Orozco joined.\n\n\nJ O N E S, Judge:\n\n¶1            Kristin Cason (Wife) appeals the division of property in the\ndecree of dissolution of her marriage to Bobby Cason (Husband). For the\nfollowing reasons, we affirm.\n\n                FACTS1 AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n¶2            In January 2006, Wife purchased real property in Queen\nCreek, and the parties founded a business, Silver Linings Hunters and\nJumpers (Silver Linings), for the purpose of raising, training, and boarding\nhorses. Husband and Wife were married in April 2006 and began living at\nand operating Silver Linings from the Queen Creek property. At the time\nof their marriage, Wife also owned real property in Gilbert.\n\n¶3            Over the next six years, Husband made improvements to both\nproperties, paid utility bills, and worked twenty to thirty hours per week\nfor the business. Meanwhile, Wife comingled business funds, rental income\nfrom the Gilbert property, and community income in accounts held by\nSilver Linings, which she used for business, personal, and community\nexpenses, including the mortgages on both properties.\n\n¶4            The parties separated in July 2010 and pursued counseling.\nAlthough Husband was removed from Silver Linings’ bank account and\ndid not receive any distributions from the business after July 2010, he\ncontinued to work for Silver Linings until Wife obtained an order of\nprotection in July 2012. Husband thereafter filed a petition for dissolution\nof marriage in October 2012.\n\n\n\n\n1       We view the facts in the light most favorable to upholding the family\ncourt’s decree. Gutierrez v. Gutierrez, 193 Ariz. 343, 346, ¶ 5 (App. 1998)\n(citing Mitchell v. Mitchell, 152 Ariz. 317, 323 (1987)).\n\n                                     2\n\f                            CASON v. CASON\n                           Decision of the Court\n\n¶5            During the course of discovery, the family court ordered the\nparties to complete a business valuation of Silver Linings; Wife refused. In\nMarch 2013, Husband filed a motion to compel Wife to respond to\n“standard” discovery requests, including requests for production of bank\nstatements, business records, and mortgage information, which the court\ngranted after Wife openly admitted in her response that she “refuse[d] to\nshare any documents or related items.” Wife did not comply. Following a\nsettlement conference in June 2013, the parties agreed Husband would pay\nfor appraisals of the Queen Creek and Gilbert properties, subject to\nreallocation of the cost at trial, and Wife would permit the appraiser access\nto the properties. However, Wife did not cooperate, and the appraisals\nwere not completed by the start of trial. Wife had also agreed to disclose\nthe accounting files for Silver Linings, as well as invoices and receipts to\nsupport the asserted debts and expenses of the business. Instead, Wife gave\nHusband summaries of her business activities, without any supporting\ndocumentation.\n\n¶6            The family court held a two-day trial in August and\nNovember 2013. After taking the matter under advisement, the court\nentered a final decree of dissolution. Within the decree, the family court\nexpressed its difficulty in valuing Husband’s interest in the community\nassets as a result of Wife’s refusal to participate in the discovery process,\nstating:\n\n      Wife did not cooperate in any meaningful way in the\n      discovery process in this case. She did not disclose a single\n      financial account. She refused to participate in a business\n      evaluation of the parties’ business, Silver Linings\n      Hunters/Jumpers, LLC.        She refused to answer any\n      interrogatories or requests for information. She refused to\n      provide any financial records related to Silver Linings. She\n      never disclosed a single exhibit to [Husband]’s counsel that\n      she intended to use at trial. She refused to provide\n      information about the mortgage and payment history of the\n      two pieces of real property that she owned prior to the\n      marriage. She continued to refuse to comply in any\n      meaningful way in the discovery process even after being\n      ordered to do so.\n\n      ...\n\n      [Wife] has candidly admitted in some of her pleadings that\n      she had not cooperated with discovery requests because she\n\n                                     3\n\f                             CASON v. CASON\n                            Decision of the Court\n\n       didn’t feel Husband was entitled to any of the information\n       because they had already divided their property and debt in\n       August 2010. Her lack of cooperation in the discovery process\n       has made it very difficult for the Court to make a fair and\n       equitable division of the community property and debts. To\n       the extent that the Court’s findings and orders set forth below\n       on the remaining disputed issues results in an unequal, or\n       unfair, division of property and debt, it is almost entirely the\n       result of [Wife’s] stubbornness and refusal to cooperate in the\n       basic discovery process that is followed in any type of\n       litigation.\n\n¶7            The family court awarded Husband: (1) a community interest\nin the value of Silver Linings in the amount of $94,184; (2) a lien against the\nQueen Creek property in the amount of $57,546; and (3) one-half of the\namount paid toward the mortgage for the Gilbert property during the\nparties’ marriage. Wife filed a motion for new trial, which was denied.\nWife timely appealed. We have jurisdiction pursuant to Arizona Revised\nStatutes (A.R.S.) sections 12-120.21(A)(1),2 -2101(A)(1) and (A)(5)(a).\n\n                               DISCUSSION\n\nI. Silver Linings\n\n¶8            Wife argues the family court’s valuation of Silver Linings was\narbitrary and did not take into account the business expenses and tax\nreturns or her own testimony regarding its finances. “‘The valuation of\nassets is a factual determination that must be based on the facts and\ncircumstances of each case’ . . . and [we] ‘will not disturb [the] trial court’s\nfactual findings unless clearly erroneous.’” Walsh v. Walsh, 230 Ariz. 486,\n490, ¶ 9 (App. 2012) (quoting Kelsey v. Kelsey, 186 Ariz. 49, 51 (App. 1996),\nand Hrudka v. Hrudka, 186 Ariz. 84, 92 (App. 1995)). A finding of fact is\nclearly erroneous when “‘the reviewing court on the entire record is left\nwith the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.’”\nPark Cent. Dev. Co. v. Roberts Dry Goods, Inc., 11 Ariz. App. 58, 60 (1969)\n(quoting Merryweather v. Pendleton, 91 Ariz. 334, 338 (1962)). On this record,\nwe find no error.\n\n\n\n\n2     Absent material changes from the relevant date, we cite a statute’s\ncurrent version.\n                                       4\n\f                            CASON v. CASON\n                           Decision of the Court\n\n¶9            After concluding Silver Linings was a community business,\nthe family court admitted “[t]he lack of documentation . . . make[s] it\nimpossible to arrive at any type of accurate assessment of business income.”\nBecause Wife did not present any evidence to support her claims, the court\nconsidered Husband’s request that he instead be awarded “one half of the\nfunds that were received from the business from the time of the parties’\nseparation in August 2010 until 2013 as his interest in the business,” in the\namount of $188,432.44. To support this request, Husband submitted\nstatements for two accounts in the name of Silver Linings that received\ndeposits of more than $480,000 between August 2010 and 2013.\n\n¶10          In reaching its decision, the family court explained:\n\n      The figures presented by [Husband] from a review of the\n      bank accounts reflect business “deposits”. They do not\n      account for any reasonable business expenses that would\n      necessarily [have] been deducted from the receipts in order to\n      determine the business income. . . . However, common sense\n      tells you that the “receipt” figure is not the income that was\n      received by the business.\n\nThe court awarded Husband “a community interest in the value of the\nbusiness” in the amount of one-half of what he requested — $94,184. In\ndoing so, the court apparently estimated, absent evidence from Wife as to\nthe actual value of Silver Linings’ expenses, that half of the business’s\nincome was used to pay expenses.3 See Murren v. Murren, 191 Ariz. 335, 337,\n¶ 8 (App. 1998) (“‘[B]ecause no fact findings were requested, we must\nassume that the trial court resolved every issue of fact in a way that\nsupports the judgment.’”) (quoting Crye v. Edwards, 178 Ariz. 327, 328 (App.\n1993)). It then divided the remaining amount — Silver Linings’ profits —\nequally between the parties.\n\n\n\n\n3      This conclusion is consistent with the profit and loss summaries\nprovided by Wife, Wife’s testimony that approximately half of the\nbusiness’s income was used to pay expenses, and Wife’s affidavit of\nfinancial information reflecting monthly income from Silver Linings of\n$8,000.\n\n\n\n                                     5\n\f                             CASON v. CASON\n                            Decision of the Court\n\n¶11            The family court has discretion to rely on various methods of\nvaluation. See Kelsey, 186 Ariz. at 51 (holding that the failure to calculate\nthe value of an asset according to standard methodology affects only the\nweight of the evidence, not its admissibility) (citing Maricopa Cnty. v.\nBarkley, 168 Ariz. 234, 239 (App. 1990)); see also Gutierrez, 193 Ariz. at 347-48\n(noting the trial court has broad discretion to choose between conflicting\nevidence). Here, although not calculated via a traditional method of\nbusiness valuation, the figure the family court arrived at is supported by\nHusband’s testimony and evidence, and therefore, cannot be arbitrary.4 See\nUnited Cal. Bank v. Prudential Ins. Co. of America, 140 Ariz. 238, 304 (App.\n1983) (“An owner of property has, by definition, knowledge of the\ncomponents of value that are useful in ascertaining value, and an owner,\nno less than an ‘expert,’ can base his opinion of value on that knowledge.”);\nMoore v. Title Ins. Co. of Minn., 148 Ariz. 408, 413 (App. 1985) (“A finding of\nfact cannot be ‘clearly erroneous’ if there is substantial evidence to support\nit, even though there might be substantial conflicting evidence.”).\n\n¶12          Although Wife may have presented some evidence and\ntestimony suggesting a different valuation,5 we find no fault with the family\n\n4       Although characterized as a portion of the business value, the award\nto Husband could also represent his share of the income from the\ncommunity business during the parties’ separation. Thus, an additional\nbasis to affirm the family court exists in that Husband is entitled to an\nequitable share of the income generated from the community business\nduring that period. See A.R.S. § 25-211(B) (“[A] petition for dissolution of\nmarriage . . . does not . . . alter the status of preexisting community property\n[or] [c]hange the status of community property used to acquire new\nproperty or the status of that new property as community property.”);\nSchickner v. Schickner, 237 Ariz. 194, 201, ¶ 30 (App. 2015) (noting profits\nderived from existing community assets are subject to equitable division);\nsee also ARCAP 13(b) (stating the appellate court may affirm judgment\nbased on any grounds properly presented in the record); Pettit v. Pettit, 218\nAriz. 529, 531, ¶ 4 (App. 2008) (“[W]e will affirm the court’s ruling on any\nlegal theory supported by the record.”) (citing Cross v. Cross, 94 Ariz. 28, 31\n(1963)).\n5      Wife does not suggest an alternate calculation or identify any trial\ntestimony or exhibit that would support an alternative valuation, and we\nwill not scour the record for evidence to contradict the family court’s\nfindings. See Adams v. Valley Nat’l Bank of Ariz., 139 Ariz. 340, 343 (App.\n1984) (“‘The adversary system of dispensing justice is effective only in the\n\n                                       6\n\f                             CASON v. CASON\n                            Decision of the Court\n\ncourt’s approach under the circumstances and will not second-guess its\ndetermination of witness credibility and the weight given to conflicting\nevidence. Gutierrez, 193 Ariz. at 347-48 (citing Premier Fin. Servs. v. Citibank\n(Ariz.), 185 Ariz. 80, 85 (App. 1995)). This is particularly true because the\nlack of sophistication in the court’s methodology was caused by Wife’s own\n“stubbornness and refusal to cooperate in the basic discovery process.” See\nsupra ¶ 6. To that extent, Wife has invited any purported error, and we will\nnot consider it. Schlecht v. Schiel, 76 Ariz. 214, 220 (1953) (“By the rule of\ninvited error, one who deliberately leads the court to take certain action\nmay not upon appeal assign that action as error.”), abrogated in part on other\ngrounds as recognized in A Tumbling-T Ranches v. Paloma Inv. Ltd. P’ship, 197\nAriz. 545, 552, ¶ 23 (App. 2000).\n\nII. Queen Creek Property\n\n¶13           Wife next argues the family court erred in calculating the\namount of the lien imposed in favor of Husband against the Queen Creek\nproperty because the court did not apply a formula that considered the\nvalue of the property at the time of dissolution. Valuation is, again, a\nquestion of fact, which we review for an abuse of discretion. See supra ¶ 8.\n\n¶14           In Valento v. Valento, this Court articulated a formula to\ncalculate the value of an equitable lien against one spouse’s separate\nproperty where the community contributes to the asset but the property\nnonetheless has negative equity at the time of dissolution. 225 Ariz. 477,\n482, ¶ 16 (App. 2010). That formula requires figures for the depreciation in\nvalue of the property during the marriage, the value of the property on the\ndate of marriage, and the community contributions to the principal or\nmarket value to establish a lien amount. See id. Here, however, the family\ncourt specifically stated it “[wa]s unable to apply any type of formula . . .\nbecause Wife refused to provide any of the information necessary for that\nprocess.” In the absence of the required information, the court awarded\nHusband one-half the value of the mortgage and utility payments made by\nWife from community funds towards the Queen Creek property — $57,546.\n\n\n\n\nevent that there is some substantial advocacy and effort on both sides of a\nquestion to be judicially determined.’ . . . We are not required to assume\nthe duties of an advocate and search voluminous records and exhibits to\nsubstantiate an appellant’s claims.”) (quoting State v. Turovh, 3 Ariz. App.\n252, 254 (1966), and citing Clemens v. Clark, 101 Ariz. 413, 414 (1966)).\n                                       7\n\f                             CASON v. CASON\n                            Decision of the Court\n\n¶15            While application of the Valento formula is certainly\npreferable where possible, the family court retains discretion to value assets\nin accordance with the facts and circumstances of each case. See Walsh, 230\nAriz. at 490, ¶ 9 (quoting Kelsey, 186 Ariz. at 51). Here, Wife did not provide\nthe information required to complete the calculation at trial, does not\nidentify within the record where these figures might be found, and does not\nprovide figures for a Valento calculation within her opening brief. The\nfamily court’s adoption of a simple reimbursement scheme was a\nreasonable alternative.6 Cf. Drahos v. Rens, 149 Ariz. 248, 250 (App. 1985)\n(noting a “value-at-dissolution formula” is preferable to an “amount-spent\nformula” because the latter does not fully account for the enhanced value\nof the property).\n\n¶16           On this record, we conclude the family court did not abuse its\ndiscretion.\n\nIII. Gilbert Property\n\n¶17           Finally, Wife argues the family court erred in finding\nHusband was entitled to any portion of the value of the Gilbert property\nbecause, she asserts, the property “supported itself” through rent payments\nthroughout the marriage. Whether a party is entitled to some portion of his\nspouse’s separate property is a mixed question of law and fact, which we\nreview de novo. See Valento, 225 Ariz. at 481, ¶ 11. Although we draw our\nown legal conclusions, we will accept the family court’s findings of fact\nunless they are clearly erroneous. Id. (citing Hrudka, 186 Ariz. at 91).\n\n¶18           Here, the family court specifically found community funds\nwere expended on the Gilbert property in the form of mortgage payments,\ntaxes, improvements, maintenance, and upkeep. This finding is supported\nby the record. The Gilbert property was rented out, and Wife deposited the\nproceeds into a community account. When mortgage payments on separate\nproperty are made from commingled funds, we presume community funds\nwere used. Drahos, 149 Ariz. at 251. Wife did not present clear and\n\n\n6      To Husband’s credit, he attempted to complete the Valento formula\nwithin his closing argument, but candidly admitted he was unable to\nprovide an accurate calculation because Wife did not disclose any\ninformation regarding the property’s second mortgage. Using only the\nlimited information Wife had provided, the value of Husband’s lien,\ncalculated under Valento, was $97,037.67 — nearly twice what the family\ncourt ultimately awarded him.\n\n                                      8\n\f                             CASON v. CASON\n                            Decision of the Court\n\nsatisfactory evidence that the rent deposits retained their character as\nseparate property after being deposited into the community account. See\nEvans v. Evans, 79 Ariz. 284, 287 (1955) (“The law furnishes no rule that will\nunscramble and separate” separate funds from community funds where\nthey are “so mixed that no intelligent segregation can be made.”); Franklin\nv. Franklin, 75 Ariz. 151, 155 (1953) (holding rent from separate property\nbecomes a community asset where the spouse “ma[kes] no effort to keep\nthe income from her separate property apart from the community funds”).\n\n¶19            The evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to upholding\nthe family court’s ruling, establishes that rental proceeds from the Gilbert\nproperty were comingled with, and became, community property, which\nWife then used to make the mortgage payments on the Gilbert property.\nAnd, Arizona has long-recognized the community’s right to an equitable\nlien against separate property where, as here, community funds are used to\npay the mortgage on the separate property. See Drahos, 149 Ariz. at 249-50;\nsee also A.R.S. § 25-318(E)(1) (allowing a court to “impress a lien on the\nseparate property of either party or the marital property awarded to either\nparty in order to secure the payment of [a]ny interest or equity the other\nparty has in or to the property”). The family court’s finding that\ncommunity funds were used to pay the mortgage on the Gilbert property\nis supported by the record, and we find no error in the award to Husband\nof one-half of the amount paid toward the mortgage for the Gilbert property\nduring the parties’ marriage.\n\n                               CONCLUSION\n\n¶20           The decree of dissolution is affirmed.7\n\n¶21          Both parties ask for an award of attorneys’ fees on appeal\npursuant to A.R.S. § 25-324. Wife does not qualify for an award of fees\nbecause she is not represented by counsel on appeal. Connor v. Cal–Az\n\n\n7      In her opening brief, Wife suggests the family court abused its\ndiscretion in excluding Wife’s evidence from trial. Because she did not\nsupport this argument within her brief by citing to the record or legal\nauthority, it is waived. See MacMillan v.

For the\nfollowing reasons, we affirm.\n\n                FACTS1 AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n¶2            In January 2006, Wife purchased real property in Queen\nCreek, and the parties founded a business, Silver Linings Hunters and\nJumpers (Silver Linings), for the purpose of raising, training, and boarding\nhorses. Husband and Wife were married in April 2006 and began living at\nand operating Silver Linings from the Queen Creek property. At the time\nof their marriage, Wife also owned real property in Gilbert.\n\n¶3            Over the next six years, Husband made improvements to both\nproperties, paid utility bills, and worked twenty to thirty hours per week\nfor the business. Meanwhile, Wife comingled business funds, rental income\nfrom the Gilbert property, and community income in accounts held by\nSilver Linings, which she used for business, personal, and community\nexpenses, including the mortgages on both properties.\n\n¶4            The parties separated in July 2010 and pursued counseling.\nAlthough Husband was removed from Silver Linings’ bank account and\ndid not receive any distributions from the business after July 2010, he\ncontinued to work for Silver Linings until Wife obtained an order of\nprotection in July 2012. Husband thereafter filed a petition for dissolution\nof marriage in October 2012.\n\n\n\n\n1       We view the facts in the light most favorable to upholding the family\ncourt’s decree. Gutierrez v.

CASON\n                           Decision of the Court\n\n¶5            During the course of discovery, the family court ordered the\nparties to complete a business valuation of Silver Linings; Wife refused. In\nMarch 2013, Husband filed a motion to compel Wife to respond to\n“standard” discovery requests, including requests for production of bank\nstatements, business records, and mortgage information, which the court\ngranted after Wife openly admitted in her response that she “refuse[d] to\nshare any documents or related items.” Wife did not comply. Following a\nsettlement conference in June 2013, the parties agreed Husband would pay\nfor appraisals of the Queen Creek and Gilbert properties, subject to\nreallocation of the cost at trial, and Wife would permit the appraiser access\nto the properties. However, Wife did not cooperate, and the appraisals\nwere not completed by the start of trial. Wife had also agreed to disclose\nthe accounting files for Silver Linings, as well as invoices and receipts to\nsupport the asserted debts and expenses of the business. Instead, Wife gave\nHusband summaries of her business activities, without any supporting\ndocumentation.\n\n¶6            The family court held a two-day trial in August and\nNovember 2013. After taking the matter under advisement, the court\nentered a final decree of dissolution. Within the decree, the family court\nexpressed its difficulty in valuing Husband’s interest in the community\nassets as a result of Wife’s refusal to participate in the discovery process,\nstating:\n\n      Wife did not cooperate in any meaningful way in the\n      discovery process in this case. She did not disclose a single\n      financial account. She refused to participate in a business\n      evaluation of the parties’ business, Silver Linings\n      Hunters/Jumpers, LLC.        She refused to answer any\n      interrogatories or requests for information. She refused to\n      provide any financial records related to Silver Linings. She\n      never disclosed a single exhibit to [Husband]’s counsel that\n      she intended to use at trial. She refused to provide\n      information about the mortgage and payment history of the\n      two pieces of real property that she owned prior to the\n      marriage. She continued to refuse to comply in any\n      meaningful way in the discovery process even after being\n      ordered to do so.\n\n      ...\n\n      [Wife] has candidly admitted in some of her pleadings that\n      she had not cooperated with discovery requests because she\n\n                                     3\n\f                             CASON v. CASON\n                            Decision of the Court\n\n       didn’t feel Husband was entitled to any of the information\n       because they had already divided their property and debt in\n       August 2010. Her lack of cooperation in the discovery process\n       has made it very difficult for the Court to make a fair and\n       equitable division of the community property and debts. To\n       the extent that the Court’s findings and orders set forth below\n       on the remaining disputed issues results in an unequal, or\n       unfair, division of property and debt, it is almost entirely the\n       result of [Wife’s] stubbornness and refusal to cooperate in the\n       basic discovery process that is followed in any type of\n       litigation.\n\n¶7            The family court awarded Husband: (1) a community interest\nin the value of Silver Linings in the amount of $94,184; (2) a lien against the\nQueen Creek property in the amount of $57,546; and (3) one-half of the\namount paid toward the mortgage for the Gilbert property during the\nparties’ marriage. Wife filed a motion for new trial, which was denied.\nWife timely appealed. We have jurisdiction pursuant to Arizona Revised\nStatutes (A.R.S.) sections 12-120.21(A)(1),2 -2101(A)(1) and (A)(5)(a).\n\n                               DISCUSSION\n\nI. Silver Linings\n\n¶8            Wife argues the family court’s valuation of Silver Linings was\narbitrary and did not take into account the business expenses and tax\nreturns or her own testimony regarding its finances. “‘The valuation of\nassets is a factual determination that must be based on the facts and\ncircumstances of each case’ . . . and [we] ‘will not disturb [the] trial court’s\nfactual findings unless clearly erroneous.’” Walsh v.

CASON\n                           Decision of the Court\n\n¶9            After concluding Silver Linings was a community business,\nthe family court admitted “[t]he lack of documentation . . . make[s] it\nimpossible to arrive at any type of accurate assessment of business income.”\nBecause Wife did not present any evidence to support her claims, the court\nconsidered Husband’s request that he instead be awarded “one half of the\nfunds that were received from the business from the time of the parties’\nseparation in August 2010 until 2013 as his interest in the business,” in the\namount of $188,432.44. To support this request, Husband submitted\nstatements for two accounts in the name of Silver Linings that received\ndeposits of more than $480,000 between August 2010 and 2013.\n\n¶10          In reaching its decision, the family court explained:\n\n      The figures presented by [Husband] from a review of the\n      bank accounts reflect business “deposits”. They do not\n      account for any reasonable business expenses that would\n      necessarily [have] been deducted from the receipts in order to\n      determine the business income. . . . However, common sense\n      tells you that the “receipt” figure is not the income that was\n      received by the business.\n\nThe court awarded Husband “a community interest in the value of the\nbusiness” in the amount of one-half of what he requested — $94,184. In\ndoing so, the court apparently estimated, absent evidence from Wife as to\nthe actual value of Silver Linings’ expenses, that half of the business’s\nincome was used to pay expenses.3 See Murren v. Murren, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">191</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ariz.</span> <span class=\"page\">335</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 337,\n¶ 8 (App. 1998) (“‘[B]ecause no fact findings were requested, we must\nassume that the trial court resolved every issue of fact in a way that\nsupports the judgment.’”) (quoting Crye v.

It then divided the remaining amount — Silver Linings’ profits —\nequally between the parties.\n\n\n\n\n3      This conclusion is consistent with the profit and loss summaries\nprovided by Wife, Wife’s testimony that approximately half of the\nbusiness’s income was used to pay expenses, and Wife’s affidavit of\nfinancial information reflecting monthly income from Silver Linings of\n$8,000.\n\n\n\n                                     5\n\f                             CASON v. CASON\n                            Decision of the Court\n\n¶11            The family court has discretion to rely on various methods of\nvaluation. See Kelsey, 186 Ariz. at 51 (holding that the failure to calculate\nthe value of an asset according to standard methodology affects only the\nweight of the evidence, not its admissibility) (citing Maricopa Cnty. v.\nBarkley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1386770\"><a href=\"/opinion/1386770/maricopa-county-v-barkley/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ariz.</span> <span class=\"page\">234</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 239 (App. 1990)); see also Gutierrez, 193 Ariz. at 347-48\n(noting the trial court has broad discretion to choose between conflicting\nevidence). Here, although not calculated via a traditional method of\nbusiness valuation, the figure the family court arrived at is supported by\nHusband’s testimony and evidence, and therefore, cannot be arbitrary.4 See\nUnited Cal.

Thus, an additional\nbasis to affirm the family court exists in that Husband is entitled to an\nequitable share of the income generated from the community business\nduring that period.

This is particularly true because the\nlack of sophistication in the court’s methodology was caused by Wife’s own\n“stubbornness and refusal to cooperate in the basic discovery process.” See\nsupra ¶ 6.

Queen Creek Property\n\n¶13           Wife next argues the family court erred in calculating the\namount of the lien imposed in favor of Husband against the Queen Creek\nproperty because the court did not apply a formula that considered the\nvalue of the property at the time of dissolution. Valuation is, again, a\nquestion of fact, which we review for an abuse of discretion. See supra ¶ 8.\n\n¶14           In Valento v. Valento, this Court articulated a formula to\ncalculate the value of an equitable lien against one spouse’s separate\nproperty where the community contributes to the asset but the property\nnonetheless has negative equity at the time of dissolution. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">225</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ariz.</span> <span class=\"page\">477</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n482, ¶ 16 (App. 2010). That formula requires figures for the depreciation in\nvalue of the property during the marriage, the value of the property on the\ndate of marriage, and the community contributions to the principal or\nmarket value to establish a lien amount. See id. Here, however, the family\ncourt specifically stated it “[wa]s unable to apply any type of formula . . .\nbecause Wife refused to provide any of the information necessary for that\nprocess.” In the absence of the required information, the court awarded\nHusband one-half the value of the mortgage and utility payments made by\nWife from community funds towards the Queen Creek property — $57,546.\n\n\n\n\nevent that there is some substantial advocacy and effort on both sides of a\nquestion to be judicially determined.’ . . .

See Walsh, 230\nAriz. at 490, ¶ 9 (quoting Kelsey, 186 Ariz. at 51). Here, Wife did not provide\nthe information required to complete the calculation at trial, does not\nidentify within the record where these figures might be found, and does not\nprovide figures for a Valento calculation within her opening brief. The\nfamily court’s adoption of a simple reimbursement scheme was a\nreasonable alternative.6 Cf. Drahos v. Rens, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1279614\"><a href=\"/opinion/1279614/drahos-v-rens/\"><span class=\"volume\">149</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ariz.</span> <span class=\"page\">248</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 250 (App. 1985)\n(noting a “value-at-dissolution formula” is preferable to an “amount-spent\nformula” because the latter does not fully account for the enhanced value\nof the property).\n\n¶16           On this record, we conclude the family court did not abuse its\ndiscretion.\n\nIII. Gilbert Property\n\n¶17           Finally, Wife argues the family court erred in finding\nHusband was entitled to any portion of the value of the Gilbert property\nbecause, she asserts, the property “supported itself” through rent payments\nthroughout the marriage. Whether a party is entitled to some portion of his\nspouse’s separate property is a mixed question of law and fact, which we\nreview de novo. See Valento, 225 Ariz. at 481, ¶ 11. Although we draw our\nown legal conclusions, we will accept the family court’s findings of fact\nunless they are clearly erroneous. Id. (citing Hrudka, 186 Ariz. at 91).\n\n¶18           Here, the family court specifically found community funds\nwere expended on the Gilbert property in the form of mortgage payments,\ntaxes, improvements, maintenance, and upkeep. This finding is supported\nby the record. The Gilbert property was rented out, and Wife deposited the\nproceeds into a community account. When mortgage payments on separate\nproperty are made from commingled funds, we presume community funds\nwere used. Drahos, 149 Ariz. at 251. Wife did not present clear and\n\n\n6      To Husband’s credit, he attempted to complete the Valento formula\nwithin his closing argument, but candidly admitted he was unable to\nprovide an accurate calculation because Wife did not disclose any\ninformation regarding the property’s second mortgage. Using only the\nlimited information Wife had provided, the value of Husband’s lien,\ncalculated under Valento, was $97,037.67 — nearly twice what the family\ncourt ultimately awarded him.\n\n                                      8\n\f                             CASON v.

See Drahos, 149 Ariz. at 249-50;\nsee also A.R.S. § 25-318(E)(1) (allowing a court to “impress a lien on the\nseparate property of either party or the marital property awarded to either\nparty in order to secure the payment of [a]ny interest or equity the other\nparty has in or to the property”). The family court’s finding that\ncommunity funds were used to pay the mortgage on the Gilbert property\nis supported by the record, and we find no error in the award to Husband\nof one-half of the amount paid toward the mortgage for the Gilbert property\nduring the parties’ marriage.\n\n                               CONCLUSION\n\n¶20           The decree of dissolution is affirmed.7\n\n¶21          Both parties ask for an award of attorneys’ fees on appeal\npursuant to A.R.S. § 25-324. Wife does not qualify for an award of fees\nbecause she is not represented by counsel on appeal. Connor v. Cal–Az\n\n\n7      In her opening brief, Wife suggests the family court abused its\ndiscretion in excluding Wife’s evidence from trial. Because she did not\nsupport this argument within her brief by citing to the record or legal\nauthority, it is waived. See MacMillan v.
