The nature and effect of the order is a mandatory\n\ntemporary injunction, for which the proper appellate remedy is an\n\ninterlocutory appeal under Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code\n\n§ 51.014(a)(4). Qwest Commc’ns Corp. v. AT&T Corp., 24 S.W.3d 334, 336 (Tex.\n\n2000); Helix Energy Solutions Grp., Inc. v. Howard, 452 S.W.3d 40, 44 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2104, no pet.). The Court has jurisdiction under\n\nsection 51.014(a)(4) of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code. The\n\nparties have briefed the issue of jurisdiction in response to the Court’s Order of\n\nAugust 19, 2015.\n\n\n\n                     Statement Regarding Oral Argument\n\n      The underlying lawsuit seeks to place a proposition on the November\n\n2015 ballot. The deadline to do so has passed and therefore both the\n\nunderlying lawsuit and the order appealed from are moot. Appellants do not\n\nbelieve oral argument would substantially aid the Court’s decisional process on\n\nthis issue. However, if the Court reaches the merits, oral argument may be\n\n\n\n\n                                        ix\n\fhelpful on the issue of why the trial court’s July 28, 2015 Order of mandamus\n\nwas error. For this reason, Appellants conditionally request oral argument.\n\n\n                                 Statement of the Case\n\n       Nature of the Case: Suit to compel the City Secretary to certify to the City\n\nCouncil the number of valid signatures on a petition submitted by David B.\n\nWilson (Wilson) purportedly to amend the City Charter, but in reality to alter\n\nthe definition of “gender identity” in the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance\n\n(“equal rights ordinance” or “HERO”).\n\n       Course of Proceedings: On July 9, 2015, Wilson presented a petition to the\n\nCity Secretary attempting to alter the definition of “gender identity” found in\n\nthe equal rights ordinance, but calling it a petition to amend the City Charter.\n\nCR.9. It is undisputed the City Secretary took no action to count the signatures\n\nat that time. On July 10, 2015, Wilson sued, seeking a writ of mandamus to\n\ncompel the City Secretary to count the signatures. CR.4-14. Over the City’s\n\nobjection to proceeding without proper notice, on July 24, 2015, the trial court\n\nheld a hearing on the application for mandamus relief. CR.38; 2RR.1.1\n\n\n\n\n1\n  The Reporter’s Record filed in this appeal consists of two volumes, but each volume is\nlabeled “Volume 1 of 1.” Thus, in this brief, Appellants cite to the July 13, 2015 hearing as\n“1RR.___” and to the July 24 hearing as “2RR.___.”\n\n\n\n                                             x\n\f      Disposition: On July 28, 2015, the court ordered the City Secretary to\n\n“count and certify to Houston City Council the number of valid signatures\n\ncontained in the petition.” CR.74 (App. A). Under the Order, the City\n\nSecretary was to complete this task within 30 days of the date the petition was\n\noriginally filed. CR.74. The defendants, the City Secretary, Mayor Parker, and\n\nthe City of Houston (referred to collectively as “the City”) filed a notice of\n\ninterlocutory appeal, pursuant to Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code\n\n§ 51.014(a)(4). CR.91-93.\n\n      Trial Court: The Honorable Brent Gamble, Harris County, Texas, 270th\n\nJudicial District Court.\n\n\n                               Issues Presented\n\n      1.    It is too late for Wilson to obtain the relief he pled for,\n            inclusion of his proposition as a ballot item in the November\n            2015 election. Therefore, both the July 28, 2015 Order and\n            the underlying lawsuit are moot and must be dismissed.\n\n      2.    The trial court erred by requiring the City Secretary to count\n            the signatures. The petition filed by Wilson is not a charter\n            amendment but a referendum; as such, its filing was\n            untimely and triggered no duty for the City Secretary to\n            count the valid signatures or certify the number to City\n            Council.\n\n      3.    The trial court abused its discretion in making what\n            effectively was a merits decision without giving the City of\n            Houston proper notice of trial.\n\n\n\n\n                                       xi\n\f4.   The trial court abused its discretion when it entered an order\n     that was in effect a temporary injunction, but without proof\n     of a probable right to relief or irreparable injury, and without\n     meeting the procedural requirements of specificity and a\n     bond under Texas Rules of Civil Procedure 683 and 684.\n\n\n\n\n                                xii\n\f                                    Statement of Facts\n\n       On May 28, 2014, the Houston City Council voted to pass Ordinance\n\nNo. 2014-530, known as the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, also referred to\n\nas “HERO.” Supp.CR.___2 (App. B). The ordinance was officially published\n\non June 3, 2014. The equal rights ordinance prohibits discrimination based on\n\nan individual’s sex, race, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, familial status,\n\nmarital status, religion, disability, sexual orientation, genetic information,\n\ngender identity, or pregnancy in city contracts, public accommodations,\n\nprivate employment (excluding religious organizations), city services, city\n\nemployment and housing. Supp.CR.___ (App. B). The ordinance included a\n\ndefinition of “gender identity.” Supp.CR.___ (App. B). This is the only place\n\nin the entire City Code of Ordinances or City Charter where “gender identity”\n\nis ever mentioned.\n\n       The equal rights ordinance was the subject of a timely-filed referendum\n\nto repeal the ordinance, which eventually was the subject of a jury trial3 and a\n\n\n\n\n2\n  Appellants’ exhibits were requested but were not included in the original Clerk’s Record.\nThe Appellants have requested a Supplemental Clerk’s Record to correct the error. Because\nthe Supplemental Record was not filed by the deadline for this brief, Appellants will file an\namended brief to include all citations to the supplemental record.\n3\n Woodfill, et al. v. Anna Russell, City Secretary, et al., No. 2014-44974, in the 152nd Judicial\nDistrict Court of Harris County, Texas.\n\fpetition for writ of mandamus to the Texas Supreme Court.4 During the same\n\ntime period, Wilson was circulating his own separate petitions for adoption of\n\na definition of “gender identity” that was contrary to the definition in the equal\n\nrights ordinance. 1RR.11:7-23.\n\n         On July 9, 2015, over a year after the equal rights ordinance was\n\nadopted, Wilson presented his petition to the City Secretary. CR.61. Under the\n\nCity Charter, a referendum on an ordinance must be filed within 30 days of the\n\nday the ordinance was published and must conform to specific “form and\n\nmanner” requirements, including a requirement that there be a circulator’s\n\naffidavit on every page.5 Wilson’s petition was an untimely referendum and\n\ndid not conform to those requirements. The City Secretary took no action to\n\ncount the signatures at that time.\n\n         Wilson alleged his petition was not a referendum on the ordinance but\n\nwas instead a “charter amendment.” CR.5. On July 10, 2015, the next day, he\n\nfiled in the district court a pleading entitled “Original Petition for Mandamus”\n\nagainst the City Secretary, the Mayor, and the City of Houston. CR.4. Wilson\n\npled for “mandatory injunctive relief to require each of the Respondents to fulfill\n\ntheir ministerial duties.” CR.12 (emphasis added). He sought “all other and\n\n4\n    In re Jared Woodfill, --- S.W.3d ---, 2015 WL 4498229 (Tex. July 24, 2015).\n5\n    City of Houston Charter, art. VII-b, § 3.\n\n\n\n                                                 2\n\ffurther declaratory and injunctive relief to which Petitioners may show\n\nthemselves to be justly entitled.” CR.13 (emphasis added). Before the City was\n\nserved with the Petition, it was served with a “Notice of Hearing” setting a\n\n“Motion to Mandamus” for hearing on Monday, July 13, 2015 at 9:00 a.m.,\n\nthree days after the petition had been filed. CR.15.\n\n      At the July 13, 2015 hearing, the Court sustained the City’s objection to\n\nproceeding with insufficient notice. Wilson amended his lawsuit and\n\nimmediately reset the mandamus to July 24, 2015. CR.23, 30. In the first\n\namended petition, Wilson dropped his allegations against the City and the\n\nMayor, and asserted a claim for a declaratory judgment with respect to the\n\nduty of the City Secretary.6 CR.27. He also removed the request for injunctive\n\nrelief. CR.27.\n\n      Just two weeks after the original petition was filed, the trial judge held a\n\nhearing on Wilson’s petition for writ of mandamus. Wilson offered no\n\nevidence at the hearing, but in argument asked the court to grant immediate\n\nemergency relief. 2RR.35:18-23. On July 28, 2015, the trial court entered an\n\norder that\n\n\n\n\n6\n The City and Mayor were still named as parties but the only claims in the body of the\npetition were against the City Secretary. Wilson later also added claims against City\nCouncil members. CR.75.\n\n\n\n                                          3\n\f        Anna Russell in her capacity as City Secretary for the City of\n        Houston shall count and certify to Houston City Council the\n        number of valid signatures contained in the petition submitted by\n        Plaintiff on or before 30 (thirty) days from the date the same were\n        filed, namely July 9, 2015.\n\nCR.74.\n\n        The City unsuccessfully sought clarification of the Order and an\n\nextension of time, based on Ms. Russell’s affidavit that she did not believe that\n\nshe and her staff would be able to timely comply. Supp.CR.___. On August 7,\n\n2015, the City timely filed a notice of interlocutory appeal and superseded the\n\norder. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 51.014(a)(4) and 6.002; Tex. R. App. P.\n\n29.2.\n\n        On July 24, 2015, the Texas Supreme Court decided In re Jared Woodfill,\n\nordering City Council to reconsider the equal rights ordinance, and if they did\n\nnot repeal it, to submit the equal rights ordinance to the voters in the next City\n\nelection. --- S.W.3d ---, 2015 WL 4498229 (Tex. July 24, 2015). Council did\n\nnot repeal the ordinance and voted to put it on the ballot in November, 2015.\n\nIn a second opinion regarding the language required on the ballot, the\n\nSupreme Court held that the vote was to “submit the ordinance” for the voters’\n\napproval; it was not a vote to “repeal” the ordinance. In re Williams, --- S.W.3d\n\n---, 2015 WL 4931372 (Tex. Aug. 19, 2015). Therefore whether the equal rights\n\nordinance, including its definition of “gender identity,” should be included in\n\n\n                                        4\n\fthe Code of Ordinances will be voted on by the voters in the City of Houston\n\nin the November 2015 election.\n\n\n                          Summary of the Argument\n\n      The Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, if approved by the voters, will\n\nprohibit discrimination in city employment and city services, city contracts,\n\npublic accommodations, private employment, and housing. Like others who\n\nhave opposed the Ordinance, Wilson’s objection to it has always been focused\n\non its definition of “gender identity.” Wilson is concerned about the effect of\n\nthis provision on the safety of public bathrooms.\n\n      The substantive issue raised by this lawsuit is whether Wilson’s petition\n\nto submit to the voters a definition of “gender identity” contrary to that in the\n\nequal rights ordinance was in form and effect a petition for an amendment to\n\nthe City of Houston Charter, as he claims, or whether it was a referendum to\n\nrepeal a term of the ordinance. The answer to that question is fundamental to\n\nwhether Wilson was entitled to the relief he sought—that the City Secretary be\n\nordered to count and certify the number of valid signatures in time for the\n\nNovember 2015 election.\n\n      The City was faced with the same issue in a challenge to its red-light\n\ncamera ordinance in 2010, where it accepted the citizens’ characterization of\n\nthe petition as a charter amendment. A federal district court ultimately ruled\n\n                                       5\n\fthat the City was wrong not to look beyond the “label” of the petition, holding\n\nit is the “character and effect” of the proposition, not the “label” on it, that\n\ndetermines if it is a charter amendment or a referendum on an ordinance. City\n\nof Houston v. Am. Traffic Solutions, Inc., No. H-10-4545, 2011 WL 2462670 (S.D.\n\nTex. June 17, 2011).\n\n      Here, the trial court never answered the basic question of the character of\n\nWilson’s petition. It accepted Wilson’s label and on that faulty foundation\n\nentered an order unsupported by either fact or law. For that reason alone, the\n\norder compelling the City Secretary to count and certify the number of valid\n\nsignatures was error. CR.74. The City Secretary had no ministerial duty to\n\ncount signatures because the petition was, in “character and effect,” a\n\nreferendum to repeal the definition of “gender identity” in the equal rights\n\nordinance and was untimely. Further, even accepting Wilson’s label of the\n\npetition as a charter amendment, he could point to nothing establishing a clear\n\nduty for the City Secretary to perform any action within the 30-day time limit\n\nhe sued for.\n\n      But although these substantive issues are important, several procedural\n\nissues should preclude the Court from ever reaching them. First and most\n\nimportant, Wilson’s lawsuit, as well as the July 28 Order, are now moot.\n\nWilson’s pleadings in the trial court sought immediate relief in order to meet\n\n\n                                       6\n\fthe deadlines for the November 2015 election. Even while the case was\n\npending in this Court, he went directly to the Texas Supreme Court seeking a\n\nwrit of mandamus, arguing there was a compelling reason to do so because\n\nwithout immediate relief it would “likely be too late” for his proposition to be\n\nplaced on the November 2015 ballot.7 The deadline for items to be placed on\n\nthe ballot is now passed and Wilson’s claims, along with the July 28 Order, are\n\nmoot. A lawsuit on his proposition to redefine “gender identity” will not be\n\nripe until and if the citizens of the City of Houston vote in favor of the equal\n\nrights ordinance.\n\n      The trial court also abused its discretion in the procedure it followed. A\n\ntrial court mandamus is not a common procedure, but the Texas Supreme\n\nCourt has made clear it is a civil action and is subject to the rules of procedure\n\njust as in any other suit. Anderson v. City of Seven Points, 806 S.W.2d 791, 792\n\n(Tex. 1991). It is not in itself a basis for emergency injunctive relief.\n\nNevertheless, over the City’s objection, the trial court held a hearing on the\n\npetition for writ of mandamus just fourteen days after Wilson filed suit and\n\nfour days later entered an order granting Wilson the relief he sought—all\n\nbefore even the deadline for filing an original answer had passed. The failure to\n\n\n7\n See In re Wilson, No. 15-0636, in the Texas Supreme Court, Petition for Writ of\nMandamus, p. 12. (Copy attached as App. C.)\n\n\n\n                                        7\n\ffollow the rules of procedure, including allowing at least 45-days’ notice of a\n\ntrial setting on the petition for writ of mandamus, was a clear abuse of\n\ndiscretion.\n\n      In fact, although he noticed the July 24 hearing as a hearing on the\n\npetition for writ of mandamus, the relief Wilson sought, and that the trial court\n\ngranted, was injunctive—a mandatory injunction under Rule 687 of the Texas\n\nRules of Civil Procedure. The City Secretary was clearly required to “obey and\n\nexecute such order as the judge has seen proper to make,” the definition of a\n\nmandatory injunction. Tex. R. Civ. P. 687. It is the character and function of\n\nan order, not its title, that determine its classification.\n\n      But although it granted injunctive relief, the July 28 Order was\n\nunsupported by any witness testimony or documentary evidence, did not “set\n\nforth the reasons for its issuance,” did not set a trial date, and was not\n\nsupported by a bond. Tex. R. Civ. P. 683, 684. The Order fails to comply with\n\nany of the evidentiary or procedural requirements for an injunction.\n\n      For all of these reasons, the trial court erred in signing the order. This\n\nCourt should find Wilson’s lawsuit moot, and declare the order of July 28,\n\n2015 void. If the Court does not find the lawsuit moot, it should reverse and\n\nvacate the order.\n\n\n\n\n                                           8\n\f                                     Argument\n\nI.    Standard of Review\n\n      An original proceeding for a writ of mandamus initiated in the trial court\n\nis a civil action subject to trial and appeal on substantive law issues and subject\n\nto the rules of procedure as any other civil suit. Anderson, 806 S.W.2d at 792\n\nn.2 (Tex. 1991). The standard of review on appeal is the same as in any civil\n\nproceeding. Id. at n.2, 3 (applying sufficiency of the evidence review to trial\n\ncourt’s fact findings in suit for mandamus); see also, e.g., Univ. of Tex. Law Sch. v.\n\nTex. Legal Found., 958 S.W.2d 479, 481 (Tex. App.—Austin 1997, no writ)\n\n(citing Anderson) (“[W]e do not review the trial court’s findings of fact and\n\nconclusions of law under the abuse of discretion standard applicable to\n\nmandamus actions originating in appellate courts … [w]e review them in\n\naccordance with the standards generally applicable to trial-court findings and\n\nconclusions.”); Mattox v. Grimes Cnty. Comm’rs Court, 305 S.W.3d 375, 380-81\n\n(Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist. 2010, pet. denied) (in mandamus suit\n\ndecided by summary judgment, applying summary judgment standard).\n\nHowever here, because no evidence was presented at the hearing, there are no\n\nfact-findings and no evidence to review.\n\n      This Court reviews the issue of mootness as a question of law. See, e.g.,\n\nCamarena v. Tex. Emp’t Comm’n, 754 S.W.2d 149, 151 (Tex. 1988).\n\n\n                                          9\n\fII.       The underlying lawsuit and the July 28, 2015 Order are moot and\n          should be dismissed.\n\n          Wilson’s lawsuit is moot; it will not be ripe until and if the equal rights\n\nordinance is approved by the voters in the November 2015 election. Wilson\n\nadmitted that his claims would be moot if not placed on the November 2015\n\nballot when he filed an emergency petition for writ of mandamus in the Texas\n\nSupreme Court on August 24, 2015, while the appeal was pending.8 Wilson\n\nargued he had a compelling reason to go directly to the Supreme Court to seek\n\na mandamus because otherwise he would miss the deadline for the November\n\n2015 election.9\n\n          Mootness and ripeness are related doctrines. Both limit courts to\n\ndeciding cases in which an actual controversy exists. Camarena, 754 S.W.2d at\n\n151 (holding the mootness doctrine limits courts to deciding cases in which an\n\nactual controversy exists); Robinson v. Parker, 353 S.W.3d 753, 755 (Tex. 2011)\n\n(“Ripeness … emphasizes the need for a concrete injury for a justiciable claim\n\nto be presented.”) (citations omitted). Both doctrines are rooted in the\n\nprohibition against advisory opinions. See Patterson v. Planned Parenthood of\n\nHouston & Se. Tex., Inc., 971 S.W.2d 439, 442 (Tex. 1998).\n\n\n8\n In re Wilson, No. 15-0636, in the Texas Supreme Court, Petition for Writ of Mandamus, p.\n12. (App. C).\n9\n    Id. at p. 14. (App. C).\n\n\n\n                                           10\n\f      On July 28, 2015, when the court entered the order of mandamus, the\n\nlive pleading was the First Amended Petition, where Wilson sought “to\n\nexercise his statutory right to obtain a vote by the citizens of the city of\n\nHouston to decide the matter in November 2015 election ballot.” CR.26.\n\n      Wilson argued that “irreparable harm” would result from failure to place\n\nthe item on the November 2015 ballot, and that otherwise “the issue becomes\n\nmoot.” CR.27.\n\n      Wilson’s current live pleading below, the Second Amended Petition\n\n(filed after the July 24 hearing) pleads:\n\n      that City Council members “order Wilson’s proposed amendment\n      to be printed on the election ballot for the November 2015\n      election”;\n\n      … that each City Council member perform his/her ministerial\n      duties and order, or cause Wilson’s Charter Amendment be placed\n      in the official city newspaper at least two weeks prior to the\n      election and cause Wilson’s proposed Charter Amendment to\n      appear on the election ballot;\n\n      that Wilson “seeks to exercise his statutory right to obtain a vote\n      by the citizens of the city of Houston to decide the matter in\n      November 2015 election ballot”; and\n\n      that “Wilson, and the people of Houston will suffer irreparable\n      harm if the proposed Charter Amendment is not put on the\n      election ballot.”\n\nCR.78, 79.\n\n      In his Prayer, he specifically seeks\n\n\n\n                                            11\n\f          … that Wilson’s proposed Charter Amendment be placed on the\n          November election ballot….\n\nCR.81.\n\n          Wilson also sued all City Council members for the purpose of including\n\nhis proposition on the ballot for the November 2015 election, and alleged\n\ndamages of $80,000 and attorneys’ fees if Defendants “maliciously failed to\n\nperform.” CR.80.10\n\n          The deadline for issues to be placed on the November 2015 ballot has\n\npassed.11 The July 28, 2015 Order that is the subject of this appeal is moot.\n\nWilson’s mandamus suit seeking that his petition be placed on the November\n\n2015 ballot is also moot and must be dismissed. See Polk v. Davidson, 145 Tex.\n\n200, 196 S.W.2d 632, 634 (1946) (“[W]hen the time comes that the issues\n\ncannot be heard and a final judgment entered adjudging the validity or\n\ninvalidity of the nominee’s certificate so that absentee ballots can be printed\n\nand available to voters as and when required by statute, the contest is moot\n\nand must be dismissed.”); see also, e.g., In re Uresti, 377 S.W.3d 696, 696 (Tex.\n\n2012) (holding once an election begins, a challenge to the candidacy of an\n\nindividual becomes moot).\n\n\n\n10\n     These claims are unsupported by any factual allegations.\n11\n     At the Texas Supreme Court Wilson argued the deadline was August 31, 2015.\n\n\n\n                                               12\n\fIII.   The trial court erred in entering the July 28, 2015 Order.\n\n       If the Court does not dismiss the underlying case as moot and reaches\n\nthe merits of this appeal, it should find a) that Wilson’s petition was a\n\nreferendum to repeal the definition of “gender identity” in the equal rights\n\nordinance, not a charter amendment; b) that the City Secretary had no duty to\n\ncount and certify the signatures; c) that the trial court failed to comply with the\n\nrules of procedure; and d) that the court’s order was a temporary injunction\n\nunsupported by evidence of a probable right to relief or irreparable injury.\n\n       A.    Wilson’s petition was an untimely referendum, not a charter\n             amendment.\n\n       Wilson’s petition was an untimely effort to repeal the definition of\n\n“gender identity” in the equal rights ordinance. He cannot change its character\n\nby claiming it is something else. The nature of the petition is fundamental to\n\nunderstanding why the trial court erred in ordering the City Secretary to count\n\nand certify the signatures.\n\n       This is not the first time this issue has arisen in Houston. In City of\n\nHouston v. American Traffic Solutions, Inc., federal district judge Lynn Hughes\n\nconsidered whether a petition to remove red light cameras was a charter\n\namendment or a referendum. 2011 WL 2462670. The issues in that case are\n\nalmost identical to those here, and Judge Hughes’ opinion provides a clear\n\nroadmap for analyzing whether Wilson’s petition is a charter amendment as he\n\n                                        13\n\fclaims, or a mislabeled petition to repeal a part of the equal rights ordinance.\n\nThe effect of the proposed amendment is key to that distinction.\n\n      ATS arose from a controversy regarding the use of cameras to record\n\ncars running red lights, resulting in penalties to the car owners. Id., at *1. The\n\nCity adopted an ordinance to use the cameras and two years later hired ATS to\n\ninstall the cameras, administer the notices to car owners, and collect the\n\npenalties. Four years after the cameras were installed, a citizen group\n\npetitioned the City for an election to amend the City Charter to disallow the\n\nuse of cameras. The City accepted the petition as the citizens characterized it,\n\nas a petition to amend the City Charter, and called a special election. A\n\nmajority of the voters agreed that the cameras should not be used. As a result,\n\nthe City amended its Charter and then cancelled its contract with ATS.\n\n      ATS sued the City in federal court for breach of contract, arguing that\n\nthe charter amendment was invalid. ATS argued that the citizen’s petition was\n\nin reality a referendum targeted to repeal a specific ordinance. The validity of\n\nthe election, and the City’s right to cancel the contract, depended on the nature\n\nof the petition.\n\n      The court explained the differences in the City Charter and ordinances:\n\n      The charter, like a constitution, structures the government;\n      ordinances, like statutes, make policy choices for their operation.\n      Charters create officers, specify election or appointment, prohibit\n      types and levels of taxation, and similar elemental things.\n\n                                       14\n\f      Ordinances set speed limits, reorganize departments, appropriate,\n      and similar managerial things. Although this distinction may blur\n      at the edge, charters and ordinances are different and must be\n      distinguishable. The rules of Texas and Houston call for them to\n      be treated differently.\n\n2011 WL 2462670, at *2.\n\n      Ordinances, like statutes, “control the ordinary operations of the city.”\n\nId., at *1. The nature of the proposition regarding red-light cameras was like a\n\nstatute and the text of the proposition voted on at the election was taken from\n\nthe ordinance. If passed, the effect of the proposition would be to repeal the\n\nordinance—it could not be enforced with that charter amendment on the\n\nbooks. In short, “[b]oth the ordinance and the amendment are about exactly\n\nthe same thing.” Id., at *2. Judge Hughes held that “given its effect, the\n\nproposition is a referendum.” Id., at *3. Because a referendum petition must be\n\nfiled within 30 days of the adoption of the ordinance, it was untimely. Id.\n\n      Like the anti-red light petition in ATS, the nature of Wilson’s proposition\n\nto redefine “gender identity” is like a statute. It reflects a policy choice for\n\noperation of city government. In addition, the significant language of the\n\nproposition is taken from the definition of “gender identity” in the equal rights\n\nordinance:\n\n\n\n\n                                       15\n\f                                    Except as required by State or Federal\nGender identity means an individual’s\ninnate identification, appearance,  law, the City of Houston shall only\n                                    define gender identify [sic] as an\nexpression or behavior as either male\nor female, although the same may notindividual innate identification, as\ncorrespond to the individual’s body or\n                                    either a male or female which is\ngender as assigned at birth.        assigned at birth. Perceived or\n                                    expressed gender identification is not\nEqual Rights Ordinance, § 17-1. allowed in defining gender identify\nSupp.CR.___ (emphasis added). (App. [sic].\nB).\n                                    Plaintiff’s Second Amended Pet., ¶ 7.\n                                    CR. 77 (emphasis added).\n\n\n      The effect of the proposition would be to repeal the protections of the\n\nequal rights ordinance (if passed) for one of its protected groups. In short, just\n\nlike the red-light camera proposition, Wilson’s petition was in nature and effect\n\na referendum to repeal a part of the ordinance. Wilson mislabeled the petition\n\na charter amendment because he filed it far too late to meet the 30-day\n\nreferendum deadline. See, City of Houston Charter, art. VII-b, §§ 2(b), (3).\n\nCalling this a petition for a charter amendment does not make it so. It is an\n\nuntimely referendum.\n\n      In ATS, Judge Hughes quoted Abraham Lincoln: “If Congress said that\n\na goat’s tail was a leg, how many legs would a goat have? Four. Calling a tail a\n\nleg does not make it so.” 2011 WL 2462670, at *3. Wilson calling his\n\nreferendum a “charter amendment” does not make it so.\n\n\n\n\n                                       16\n\f      B.     Wilson’s proposed definition of “gender identity” is not\n             relevant to Section 22 of the City Charter; it is based on and\n             directly opposed to the definition of “gender identity” in the\n             equal rights ordinance.\n\n      In his First Amended Petition, Wilson clearly identified “Ordinance No.\n\n2014-530, Art. 17-2,” the equal rights ordinance, as his target:\n\n      The proposed Charter Amendment will benefit the people of\n      Houston in that it will aid to law enforcement officers in protecting\n      young boys and girls using the public restrooms from those people\n      that would enter a public restroom of the opposite sex with the\n      intent to gratify their sexual perversions by watching others. Under\n      a current ordinance, gender identification is too broadly defined to\n      protect children from child predators and provides: City Ordinance\n      No. 2014-530, Article 17-2 provides: Gender Identity means an\n      individual’s innate identification, appearance, expression or\n      behavior as either male or female, although the same may not\n      correspond to the individual’s body or gender as assigned at birth.\n\nCR.26.\n\n      To try to avoid the fact that his referendum was untimely, Wilson claimed\n\nhis petition seeks to amend not the equal rights ordinance, but Section 22 of the\n\nCity Charter. CR.24. But Section 22 does not in any way address gender\n\nidentity; it concerns employment benefits for City employees and those doing\n\nbusiness with the City. Section 22 provides, in part:\n\n      Except as required by State or Federal law, the City of Houston\n      shall not provide employment benefits, including health care, to\n      persons other than employees, their legal spouses and dependent\n      children; nor shall the City provide any privilege in promotion,\n      hiring, or contracting to a person or group on the basis of sexual\n      preference, either by a vote of the city council or an executive\n      order by the Mayor. Further, the City of Houston shall not require\n\n                                         17\n\f      entities doing business with the City to have any of the above\n      benefits or policies.\n\nSupp.CR.___.\n\n      Section 22 does not use the term “gender identity”; and following\n\nObergefell v. Hodges, the term “legal spouses” is not impacted by gender. 135 S.\n\nCt. 2584 (2015). Neither does Section 22 concern sex-segregated restrooms.\n\nThe term “gender identity” is nowhere found in the City Charter.\n\n      That Wilson’s true goal was to repeal the definition of gender identity in\n\nthe equal rights ordinance is also evidenced by his letter accompanying the\n\nJune, 2015 petition drive. There, Wilson referenced what he referred to as the\n\n“Bathroom Ordinance”:\n\n      You may have heard that the two previous petition drives\n      challenging and seeking to reverse Mayor Parker’s Bathroom\n      Ordinance are either tied up in court or rejected by the City.\n\nSupp.CR.___ (emphasis added).\n\n      The cover letter he sent with the April, 2015 petition again identified the\n\ntarget of his efforts:\n\n      The City of Houston Mayor Parker is pushing her personal\n      homosexual agenda with Executive Order (1-50) and City of\n      Houston Ordinance (#2014-530) [the equal rights ordinance]\n      which allows men to use the women’s restroom if they perceive or\n      express themselves as women.\n\nSupp.CR.___ (emphasis added).\n\n\n\n\n                                       18\n\f      Wilson requested that the City Secretary count and certify the results of\n\nhis petition within 30 days, the time limit set out in Houston City Charter,\n\narticle VII-b, the City Charter provision governing referenda. The City Charter\n\ndoes not include a similar provision for charter amendments. Only state law\n\nprovides a source for citizen-initiated charter amendments, and it does not\n\ninclude any statute imposing a ministerial duty on a city secretary or any other\n\nofficial to count and certify within 30 days. Tex. Loc. Gov’t Code § 9.004.\n\n      Just like a court must look beyond the title of a pleading to its substance,\n\nneither the City nor this Court is bound to accept Wilson’s characterization of\n\nhis petition as a charter amendment. See Ryland Enter., Inc. v. Weatherspoon, 355\n\nS.W.3d 664, 666 (Tex. 2011) (observing that courts should acknowledge the\n\nsubstance of the relief sought despite the formal styling of the pleading). See\n\nalso, e.g., Diversicare Gen. Partner, Inc. v. Rubio, 185 S.W.3d 842, 851 (Tex. 2005)\n\n(holding that a health care liability claim cannot be recast as another cause of\n\naction to avoid statutory requirements); Haase v. Glazner, 62 S.W.3d 795, 799\n\n(Tex. 2001) (holding that if it permitted a fraud claim seeking to recover the\n\nbenefit of the unenforceable bargain, the court would deprive the statute of\n\nfrauds of any effect); In re Crawford & Co., 458 S.W.3d 920, 926 (Tex. 2015)\n\n(holding that claimants could not recast their claims to avoid the exclusive\n\njurisdiction of administrative agency).\n\n\n                                          19\n\f      The trial court abused its discretion by failing to look beyond Wilson’s\n\ncharacterization of the petition to determine its true character and effect. Had\n\nit done so, the court would have seen, as Judge Hughes did in ATS, that the\n\npetition does not seek a charter amendment; it seeks a referendum to\n\neffectively repeal the part of the equal rights ordinance that would protect\n\nindividuals based on their gender identity.\n\n\n      C.    The trial court erred in ordering the City Secretary to count and\n            certify the signatures.\n\n      As the federal court’s decision in ATS made clear, the City Secretary\n\ncould not simply accept Wilson’s “label” of his petition as a charter\n\namendment. The City Secretary had no ministerial duty to accept the petition\n\nor begin counting when the petition did not comply with City requirements as\n\nto form, content and procedure for a referendum. See, e.g., Escobar v. Sutherland,\n\n917 S.W.2d 399, 406 (Tex. App.—El Paso 1996, orig. proceeding) (where\n\napplication for a place on the electoral ballot did not comply with form content\n\nand procedure required by law, application must be rejected). Those\n\nprocedures assure an orderly process for challenging City ordinances in a\n\ntimely manner. The trial court’s order that the City Secretary count signatures\n\nand certify the number of valid signatures, even though Wilson had not met\n\nthe 30-day deadline for challenging a City ordinance, defeats that procedure.\n\n\n                                       20\n\f      And even accepting Wilson’s characterization of the petition as a charter\n\namendment, the trial court still abused its discretion because it ordered that the\n\nCity Secretary perform ministerial duties that are not clearly specified and\n\nsupported by law. A court cannot issue mandamus relief against a public\n\nofficial unless “the law clearly spells out the duty to be performed by the\n\nofficial with sufficient certainty that nothing is left to the exercise of\n\ndiscretion.” In re Jared Woodfill, 2015 WL 4498229, at *3 (quoting Anderson,\n\n806 S.W.2d at 793). See also Mattox, 305 S.W.3d at 380.\n\n      Wilson stated to the trial court that the relief he was seeking was under\n\nthe Local Government Code; he also admitted that nothing in that law\n\nrequired the City Secretary to count signatures for an amendment to the City\n\nCharter. 2RR.26 Nor does the Local Government Code mandate a 30-day\n\nperiod for signatures to be counted for a charter amendment. Tex. Loc. Gov’t\n\nCode § 9.004. Section 9.004 imposes no time limit for the governing body to\n\nsubmit a proposed charter amendment to the voters and no time limit for\n\ndetermining if a petition is signed by a number of qualified voters. Nothing in\n\nSection 9.004 imposes on the City Secretary a “clear duty” to count and certify\n\nsignatures for a charter amendment within 30 days of the date the petition is\n\ndelivered.\n\n\n\n\n                                       21\n\f      If Wilson is in fact seeking an amendment to the City Charter as he\n\nclaims and pleads, there was no duty for the City Secretary to comply within\n\n30 days. If, as the City asserts, the nature and effect of Wilson’s petition,\n\ndemonstrates that it is a referendum on the equal rights ordinance, it was\n\nuntimely. Either way, the trial court erred by ordering the City Secretary to\n\ncount and certify the signatures.\n\n\n      D.    The trial court abused its discretion by proceeding with the\n            mandamus proceeding without proper notice as required by the\n            Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\n      The trial court erred not only by the substance of the order, but also by\n\nthe procedure it followed. The court failed to comply with the rules of civil\n\nprocedure with respect to the hearing on the mandamus petition and in so\n\ndoing deprived the City of due process of law.\n\n      An original proceeding for a writ of mandamus issued in a trial court is a\n\ncivil action subject to trial and appeal on substantive law issues and is subject\n\nto rules of procedure just as any other civil suit. Anderson, 806 S.W.2d at 792.\n\nA mandamus must proceed to trial and judgment just as in any other action.\n\nId. “There is no distinguishable difference in principle in the course of\n\nproceeding and result attained in it and any other suit in the District Court.”\n\nId.\n\n\n\n                                       22\n\f      In his “Original Petition for Mandamus,” Wilson pled for “mandatory\n\ninjunctive relief to require each of the Respondents to fulfill their ministerial\n\nduties” and in his prayer sought “all further declaratory and injunctive relief to\n\nwhich Petitioners may show themselves to be justly entitled.” CR.12-13\n\n(emphasis added). Even before the City was served with the Petition, it was\n\nserved with a “Notice of Hearing” setting a “Motion to Mandamus” for\n\nhearing on Monday, July 13, 2015 at 9:00 a.m., three days after the petition\n\nhad been filed. CR.15.\n\n      The City objected to the short notice and the July 13 hearing was reset to\n\nJuly 24, 2015. CR.18, 30. By that time Wilson had amended his petition to add\n\na claim for declaratory relief. CR.27. While he dropped the direct references to\n\ninjunctive relief, Wilson still pled he had suffered and would continue to suffer\n\n“irreparable harm” and that he had “no other adequate remedy at law.”\n\nCR.26, 27. Fourteen days after the original petition was filed, Wilson had his\n\nhearing, but he offered no evidence to support his claims. Nevertheless, on\n\nJuly 28, 2015, the trial court entered an order that\n\n      Anna Russell in her capacity as City Secretary for the City of\n      Houston shall count and certify to Houston City Council the\n      number of valid signatures contained in the petition submitted by\n      Plaintiff on or before 30 (thirty) days from the date the same were\n      filed, namely July 9, 2015.\n\n\n\n\n                                        23\n\fCR.74.12\n\n      If the hearing on July 24, 2015 was in fact a hearing for final relief on a\n\npetition for writ of mandamus, the trial court abused its discretion when it\n\nfailed to follow the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure and proceeded with the\n\nhearing on insufficient notice. The City was entitled to a minimum of 20 days\n\nto prepare and serve an answer and to reasonable notice of not less than 45\n\ndays for trial, just as with any other lawsuit. Anderson, 806 S.W.2d at 792; Tex.\n\nR. Civ. P. 245. When a defendant makes an appearance in a case, as the City\n\nSecretary did here, the 45 days’ notice of a trial setting is a matter of due\n\nprocess and is mandatory. Tex. R. Civ. P. 245; see LBL Oil Co. v. Int’l Power\n\nServs., Inc., 777 S.W.2d 390, 390–91 (Tex. 1989) (per curiam); Custom–Crete,\n\nInc. v. K–Bar Servs., Inc., 82 S.W.3d 655, 659 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2002,\n\nno pet.). Failure to give proper notice is grounds for reversal. Custom-Crete, 82\n\nS.W.3d at 659.\n\n      The hearing on the petition for writ of mandamus proceeded, over the\n\nCity Secretary’s objection, only fourteen days after Wilson filed his petition.\n\nCR.32; 2RR.1. The order purported to be a final ruling on “Plaintiff’s\n\nApplication for Writ of Mandamus.” CR.74. In this Court, Wilson disputes\n\n12\n  On July 30, 2015, Wilson again amended his petition to sue the City Council members\nand add a claim for money damages. City Council members were not parties to this suit at\nthe time the trial court entered its Order.\n\n\n\n                                          24\n\fthe order is in reality a temporary injunction. See Reply to Response to Notice\n\nto Show Court’s Appellate Jurisdiction, filed September 1, 2015. However, if\n\nthis order is, as Wilson contends, a final order on his petition for writ of\n\nmandamus, the Appellants should have been afforded forty-five days’ notice of\n\nthe hearing, as required by Rule 245 and due process.\n\n\n      E.    Wilson sought and received injunctive relief without meeting\n            the requirements of a temporary injunction.\n\n            1.    The order is a mandatory injunction.\n\n      The hearing on July 24, 2015 did not result in a final order on a petition\n\nfor writ of mandamus, but instead in an order that is, in its character and\n\nfunction, a temporary injunction. Wilson originally pled for injunctive relief\n\nand the relief he sought and obtained was injunctive relief.\n\n      Under Rule 687, a temporary injunction may be either prohibitive or\n\nmandatory—it may order a party to “desist and refrain from the commission\n\nor continuance of the act enjoined,” or to “obey and execute such order as the\n\njudge has seen proper to make.” Tex. R. Civ. P. 687; In re Hardwick, 426\n\nS.W.3d 151, 159 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2012, no pet.) (“An\n\ninjunction may be either prohibitive, forbidding particular conduct, or\n\nmandatory, requiring particular conduct.”). The July 28 order was mandatory.\n\nIt ordered that the City Secretary “shall count and certify to the Houston City\n\n\n                                       25\n\fCouncil the number of valid signatures.” CR.74. Although the order does not\n\nacknowledge it is a mandatory temporary injunction, the Texas Supreme\n\nCourt has long ago “rejected the notion that ‘matters of form control the nature\n\nof the order itself.’” Qwest, 24 S.W.3d at 336 (quoting Del Valle Indep. Sch. Dist.\n\nv. Lopez, 845 S.W.2d 808, 809 (Tex.1992)); see also, e.g., In re Hardwick, 426\n\nS.W.3d at 159 (citing Del Valle, 845 S.W.2d at 809) (“Matters of form do not\n\ncontrol whether an order is an injunction; rather ‘it is the character and\n\nfunction of an order that determine its classification.’”).\n\n      In Qwest, the Supreme Court held that a trial court’s interlocutory order\n\nthat compelled Qwest to undertake certain monitoring and notice provisions\n\nwhen conducting its operations was a temporary injunction. The Court\n\nexplained:\n\n      In Del Valle Independent School District v. Lopez, we rejected the\n      notion that “matters of form control the nature of the order itself—\n      it is the character and function of an order that determine its\n      classification.” 845 S.W.2d 808, 809 (Tex. 1992). We reasoned\n      that if errors in the form of the order determined the order’s status,\n      then those errors would deny review of the very defects that render\n      the order void. See Del Valle, 845 S.W.2d at 809–10; Brines v.\n      McIlhaney, 596 S.W.2d 519, 523 (Tex.1980).\n\nQwest, 24 S.W.3d at 336.\n\n      The Fourteenth Court of Appeals’ recent decision in Helix similarly\n\nfound that an interlocutory order requiring a maritime employer to make\n\npayments to a seaman was a temporary injunction, even though it was labeled\n\n                                        26\n\fas an order granting a motion to compel. Helix, 452 S.W.3d at 44. Justice\n\nChristopher’s comment in that case applies equally here: “[Plaintiff] has not\n\ncited, and we have not found, any provision of Texas procedural law\n\nauthorizing a litigant to obtain an interlocutory order on the merits from a state\n\ncourt while avoiding both the rules governing summary judgments and those\n\ngoverning injunctive relief.” Id.\n\n      In his Original Petition for Writ of Mandamus, Wilson pled for\n\ninjunctive relief. CR.11, 13. Although he dropped the words “injunctive relief”\n\nfrom his First Amended Petition, the substantive relief he requested remained\n\nthe same. CR.27. The specific action the trial court ordered—that the City\n\nSecretary “count and certify” the signatures on a short deadline—is a classic\n\nexample of a mandatory temporary injunction. See, e.g., Helix, 452 S.W.3d at\n\n44.\n\n      There are no special provisions in the rules of civil procedure for\n\nimmediate, emergency relief in a suit seeking a trial court mandamus. A party\n\nwho files a petition for writ of mandamus in a district court and wants\n\nimmediate temporary relief has the same burden and must follow the same\n\nprocedures as in any other suit. He must seek temporary injunctive relief under\n\nRules 680-693 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. See Tobin v. Serna, 277\n\nS.W. 2d 176, 177 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1955, writ ref’d); Tex. R. Civ. P.\n\n\n                                       27\n\f680 et seq.13 The requirements for obtaining a temporary injunction may not be\n\nevaded by calling it something else. See, e.g., Helix, 452 S.W.3d at 44 (holding\n\norder “to compel” payments was in reality a mandatory temporary injunction).\n\n       The July 28 Order was not the result of a summary judgment\n\nproceeding, a trial on the merits, or even an evidentiary hearing. At the time\n\nthe order was entered, there was still pending an asserted claim for a\n\ndeclaratory judgment. CR.27. Although all of the underlying claims are now\n\nmoot, at the time the July 28 Order was entered it was an interlocutory order,\n\nand in character and function it was a temporary injunction.\n\n\n              2.     Wilson did not prove a right to injunctive relief and the\n                     order does not comply with Rules 683 and 684.\n\n       The July 28 Order must be reviewed as a temporary injunction. To\n\nobtain a temporary injunction, the applicant must plead and prove: (1) a cause\n\nof action against the defendant; (2) a probable right to the relief sought; and\n\n(3) a probable, imminent, and irreparable injury in the interim.

And\n\nsignificantly here, the applicant must introduce at the hearing competent\n\nevidence to support a probable right to recovery and a probable injury. Letson v.\n\nBarnes, 979 S.W.2d 414, 417 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 1998, pet. denied). Wilson\n\noffered no evidence at the hearing to support any of the elements of injunctive\n\nrelief.\n\n          Rule 683 also requires that an “order granting an injunction … shall set\n\nforth the reasons for its issuance[.]” Tex. R. Civ. P. 683. The trial court must\n\nset forth specific reasons, not merely conclusory statements, in the order\n\ngranting temporary injunctive relief. See In re Chaumette, 456 S.W.3d 299, 305\n\n(Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2015, no pet.). The order must “set forth the\n\nreasons why the court deems it proper to issue the writ to prevent injury to the\n\napplicant in the interim; that is, the reasons why the court believes the\n\napplicant’s probable right will be endangered if the writ does not issue.” Id.\n\n(citing Transp. Co. of Tex. v. Robertson Transps., Inc., 261 S.W.2d 549, 553 (Tex.\n\n1953)). The trial court’s order does not meet that standard.\n\n          The bond provisions of Rule 684 are also mandatory. Rule 684 requires\n\nthat before the issuance of the temporary injunction, the applicant “shall\n\nexecute and file with the clerk a bond to the adverse party.” Tex. R. Civ. P.\n\n\n                                         29\n\f684. A temporary injunction is subject to being declared void when a bond is\n\nnot posted prior to its issuance. See Qwest, 24 S.W.3d at 337 (emphasis added)\n\n(citing Lancaster v. Lancaster, 155 Tex. 528, 291 S.W.2d 303, 308 (1956)). No\n\nbond was required here.\n\n      The trial court’s July 28 order is not supported by evidence and fails to\n\ncomply with any of the procedural or evidentiary requirements for a temporary\n\ninjunction. If this Court reaches the issue, it should find the Order is void.\n\n\n                             Conclusion and Prayer\n\n      The Appellants respectfully pray that this Court dismiss the underlying\n\nsuit as moot. If it reaches the merits, the Appellants pray that the Court reverse\n\nand vacate the order of July 28, 2015 and remand to the trial court for further\n\nproceedings, and for such other relief to which they may be entitled.\n\n\n\n\n                                        30\n\fRespectfully submitted,\n\nDONNA L.

Notwithstanding a determination that disclosure of a\n      conciliation agreement is not required, the fair housing administrator may publish tabulated\n      descriptions of the results of all conciliation efforts.\n(j)   If the aggrieved person brings a civil action under a local, state, or federal law seeking relief for the\n      alleged discriminatory housing practice and the trial in the action begins, the fair housing\n      administrator shall terminate efforts to conciliate the complaint unless the court specifically requests\n      assistance from the fair housing administrator. The fair housing administrator may also terminate\n      efforts to conciliate the complaint if:\n      (1) The respondent fails or refuses to confer with the fair housing administrator;\n      (2) The aggrieved person or the respondent fails to make a good faith effort to resolve any dispute;\n          or\n      (3) The fair housing administrator finds, for any reason, that voluntary agreement is not likely to\n          result.\n\n(Ord. No. 2014-530, § 2(Exh A), 5-28-2014)\n\nSec. 17-136. - Violation of conciliation agreement.\n\n(a) A person commits an offense if, after the person executes a conciliation agreement under section\n    17-135 of this Code, he or she violates any term or condition contained in the agreement.\n(b) It is no defense to criminal prosecution in municipal court under this section that, with respect to a\n    discriminatory housing practice that gave rise to the conciliation agreement under section 17-135 of\n    this Code:\n      (1) The respondent did not commit the discriminatory housing practice; or\n      (2) The fair housing administrator did not have probable cause to believe the discriminatory\n          housing practice was committed.\n(c) If the fair housing administrator determines that a conciliation agreement has been violated, the fair\n    housing administrator shall give written notice to all parties subject to the agreement.\n(d) When the fair housing administrator has reasonable cause to believe that a respondent has\n    breached a conciliation agreement, the fair housing administrator shall refer the matter to the city\n    attorney for appropriate action in accordance with this article.\n\n(Ord. No. 2014-530, § 2(Exh A), 5-28-2014)\n\nSec. 17-137. - Reasonable cause determination.\n\n(a) A panel consisting of a fair housing investigator representative, the city attorney, and the fair housing\n    administrator, shall determine based on all the facts whether reasonable cause exists to believe that\n    a discriminatory housing practice has occurred or is about to occur.\n                                                                                                             th\n(b) The panel shall make the determination under subsection (a) of this section not later than the 100\n    day after the date a complaint is filed unless:\n      (1) It is impracticable to make the determination; or\n      (2) The city attorney has approved a conciliation agreement relating to the complaint.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                      Page 19\n\f(c) If it is impracticable to make the determination within the time period provided by subsection (b) of\n    this section, the panel shall notify the complainant, and the aggrieved person if different from the\n    complainant, and the respondent, in writing, of the reasons for the delay.\n(d) If the city attorney determines that no reasonable cause exists to believe that a discriminatory\n    housing practice has occurred, the city attorney shall issue to the fair housing administrator a short\n    and plain written statement of the facts upon which the city attorney based the no reasonable cause\n    determination. If the city attorney issues such a statement, the panel shall automatically determine\n    that no reasonable cause exists to believe that a discriminatory practice has occurred or is about to\n    occur.\n(e) If the panel determines that reasonable cause exists to believe that a discriminatory housing practice\n    has occurred or is about to occur, the city attorney shall proceed with appropriate enforcement\n    action.\n\n(Ord. No. 2014-530, § 2(Exh A), 5-28-2014)\n\nSec. 17-138. - Charge.\n\n(a) A charge issued under section 17-137 of this Code:\n     (1) Must consist of a short and plain statement of the facts upon which the fair housing\n         administrator and the city attorney have found reasonable cause to believe that a discriminatory\n         housing practice has occurred or is about to occur;\n     (2) Must be based on the final investigative report; and\n     (3) Need not be limited to the facts or grounds alleged in the complaint.\n(b) Not later than the 20th day after the fair housing administrator issues a charge, the fair housing staff\n    shall send a copy of the charge to:\n     (1) Each respondent; and\n     (2) Each aggrieved person on whose behalf the complaint was filed.\n\n(Ord. No. 2014-530, § 2(Exh A), 5-28-2014)\n\nSec. 17-139. - Dismissal.\n\n(a) A complaint shall be dismissed by the fair housing administrator during the investigation and prior to\n    referral to the city attorney when the fair housing administrator determines that:\n     (1) The complaint was not timely filed;\n     (2) The location of the alleged discriminatory housing practice is not within the city's jurisdiction;\n     (3) The alleged discriminatory housing practice is not a violation of this article;\n     (4) The complainant, or the aggrieved person if different from the complainant, refuses to cooperate\n         with the fair housing administrator in the investigation of the complaint or enforcement of the\n         executed conciliation agreement; or\n     (5) The complainant, or the aggrieved person if different from the complainant, cannot be located\n         after the fair housing administrator has performed a reasonable search.\n(b) A criminal action may be dismissed by a municipal judge upon motion of the city attorney, if after the\n    city attorney files the action charging a respondent with a discriminatory housing practice, a\n    conciliation agreement is executed under section 17-135 of this Code before the trial begins in\n    municipal court.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                      Page 20\n\f(c) The fair housing administrator shall notify the complainant, the aggrieved person if different from the\n    complainant, and the respondent of the dismissal of the complaint, including a written statement of\n    facts, and may make public disclosure of the dismissal unless the respondent requests that no public\n    disclosure be made.\n\n(Ord.

He requested that his proposed amendment be submitted to\n\nthe voters in the next election. Houston City Secretary, Anna Russell, (“Russell”) had\n\nthe duty to count and certify the petitions. To date she has not performed this\n\nministerial duty.\n\n       On Wilson’s petition for writ of mandamus, the 270th District Court of Harris\n\nCounty granted Wilson mandamus relief to compel Russell to count and certify the\n\npetitions. (Appendix 1). Even after the order, Russell refused to perform her\n\nministerial duties. Instead, Russell filed a notice of Interlocutory Appeal1 calculated\n\nto cause Wilson and the 22,000 plus petition signers to miss an August 31, 2015\n\ndeadline to submit the proposed amendment to the voters.

Appendix “3” This action appears to have been calculated to use up precious\n\ntime to get beyond the August 31, 2015 deadline.\n\n        The appeal was assigned to the First Court of Appeals. Wilson moved to\n\ndismiss the appeal. (Appendix “4”). On August 19, 2015, the Court of Appeals\n\ndenied the motion, but indicated its concern that it lacked jurisdiction. (Appendix\n\n“2”).    It gave the Real Parties in Interest ten days to respond to its concern.\n\nUnfortunately August 29, 2015 (a Saturday), will likely be too late. This petition for\n\nemergency mandamus followed.\n\n        Statement of Facts\n\n        During the months of April, May June, and July 2015 Wilson sponsored and\n\nconducted a petition drive to amend, modify, or supplement Article II, Section 22 of\n\nHouston's City Charter. Pursuant to Texas Election Code § 277.001, and Texas\n\nGovernment Code § 9.004(a), Wilson collected approximately 22,000 petitions to\n\ndefine the term \"gender identity.\" The Petition sought to define gender identity as:\n\n              Except as required by State or Federal law, the City of\n              Houston shall only define gender identify as an individual's\n              innate identification, as either a male or female which is\n              assigned at birth.       Perceived or expressed gender\n              identification is not allowed in defining gender identify.\n              Further, the City of Houston shall require entities doing\n              business with the city to abide by the same definition of\n\n                                       Page -12-\n\f             gender identification.\"\n\n      On July 9, 2015, Wilson filed the petitions with the Anna Russell, the Houston\n\nCity Secretary. He requested that the petition be adopted by Houston City Council as\n\na Charter Amendment, or alternatively, submitted to the voters for a vote. Anna\n\nRussell refused to count or certify Wilson's petitions. On July 10, 2015, Wilson filed\n\nhis Original Petition for Writ of Mandamus with the 270th District Court of Harris\n\nCounty, Texas. On July 31, 2015, the district court conducted a hearing on Wilson's\n\nPetition for Writ of Mandamus. (Appendix “4”)        On July 28, 2015, the granted\n\nWilson's Petition for Writ of Mandamus with respect to Defendant, Anna Russell and\n\nordered her to count the petitions submitted by Wilson and to certify and present the\n\nsame to the Houston City Council by August 8, 2015. (Appendix “1\") On August 7,\n\n2015, the day before the Anna Russell was to have completed her count and\n\ncertification, she filed her notice of interlocutory appeal with the Court of Appeals.\n\n(Appendix “3\").\n\n\n\n\n                                       Page -13-\n\f                        STATEMENT OF JURISDICTION\n\n      This Court has jurisdiction to issue writs of mandamus under Texas\n\nConstitution Article 5, Section 6; Texas Government Code Section 22.221(a); Texas\n\nElection Code Section 273.061; and Tex. R. App. P. 52. No genuine issues of\n\nmaterial fact exist to divest this Court of mandamus jurisdiction. Relators are mindful\n\nof Tex. R. App. P. 52.3(c), which ordinarily requires Relators to file this Petition and\n\nMotion first with the Houston Court of Appeals, given that Court and this Court both\n\nhave original jurisdiction to review this matter. However, although a number of\n\nmatters were submitted to the Court of Appeals, given the time constraints, there is\n\nsimply not enough time to go through both Courts, and thus a “compelling reason”\n\nwithin the meaning of the rule applies here for Relators to file with this Court and not\n\nthe Houston Court of Appeals.\n\n\n\n\n                                       Page -14-\n\f                            SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\n\n       No interlocutory appeal lies from an interlocutory order granting a petition for\n\nwrit of mandamus issued by a Texas District Court. CMH Homes v. Perez, 340\n\nS.W.3d 444, 447–48 (Tex. 2011)(interlocutory appeals may only be taken where\n\nstatutorily authorized). Since the First Court of Appeals lacks jurisdiction of the Real\n\nParties in Interest’s appeal, and its continued exercise of jurisdiction will likely result\n\nin irreparable harm to legislative power reserved to the people of Houston, In re Jared\n\nWoodfill,__ S.W.3d __, __, 2015 WL 4498229 (Tex. 2015) (per curiam), this Court\n\nshould ordered that First Court of Appeals dismiss the appeal styled Annise D.\n\nParker, Mayor, Anna Russell, City Secretary, and City of Houston v. David B.\n\nWilson, 01-15-00687-CV, First Court of Appeals, Trial Court Number 2015-39706,\n\n270th District Court of Harris County, Texas, for lack of jurisdiction.\n\n       Texas Government Code § 9.004(a) empowers Houston citizens to vote to\n\namend their City Charter after a petition signed by a number of qualified voters of\n\nthe municipality equal to at least five percent of the number of qualified voters of the\n\nmunicipality or 20,000 whichever number is smaller. The City of Houston Charter\n\ndelegates to the city Secretary, Anna Russell, the ministerial function to certify to the\n\nHouston City Council the number of valid signatures on said petition, and present\n\nsuch petition and certificate to the Houston City Council. She refuse to do so, and\n\n                                         Page -15-\n\fcontinues to refuse to do so. For the reasons set forth this Court’s recent decisions\n\nin In Re F.N. Williams, Sr, and Jared Woodfill, No. 15-00581 (Tex. August 19,\n\n2015); In re Woodfill, __ S.W.3d __, __, 2015 WL 4498229 (Tex. 2015) (per\n\ncuriam) mandamus is appropriate to compel Anna Russell to perform her ministerial\n\nduties.\n\n\n\n\n                                      Page -16-\n\f                         ARGUMENT & AUTHORITIES\n\n      Argument & Authorities Under Issue One\n\n      Does the Court of Appeals have appellate jurisdiction of an interlocutory order\n\nof mandamus issued by a trial court? The answer is no. The order of the trial court\n\nwas not an temporary injunction. It was the granting of a writ of mandamus. As\n\nstated by the Court of Appeals:\n\n             This Court generally has jurisdiction only over appeals\n             from final judgments unless a statute authorizes an\n             interlocutory appeal.\n\nciting, See CMH Homes v. Perez, 340 S.W.3d 444, 447–48 (Tex. 2011); Paulsen v.\n\nYarrell, 455 S.W.3d 192, 195 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2014, no pet.) (citing\n\nRusk State Hosp. v. Black, 392 S.W.3d 88, 92 (Tex. 2012)); see also, e.g., Tex. Civ.\n\nPrac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 51.014 (West 2015) (authorizing appeals from certain\n\ninterlocutory orders). (Appendix 2) No statutory basis exists for reviewing an\n\ninterlocutory mandamus by appeal.\n\n      A writ of mandamus will issue to compel a public official to perform a\n\nministerial act. Womack v. Berry, 156 Tex. 44, 291 S.W.2d 677, 682 (1956); Turner\n\nv. Pruitt, 161 Tex. 532, 342 S.W.2d 422, 423 (1961). A writ of injunction is governed\n\nby Chapter 65 of the Texas Civil Practice & Remedies Code and requires balancing\n\nequities. The Texas Legislature permits interlocutory appeals of temporary\n\n                                      Page -17-\n\finjunctions, but makes no allowance for appeals of mandamus orders. Tex. Civ. Pract.\n\n& Rem. Code Ann. § 51.014 (4) (West 2015). The courts strictly construe statutes\n\nthat allow interlocutory appeals. Bally Total Fitness Corp. v. Jackson, 53 S.W.3d 352\n\n(Tex. 2001).\n\n       The First Court of Appeals should have dismissed, and its delay (even if ever\n\nso slight) will result in irreparable harm to Wilson and the citizens of Houston. The\n\nresult will be that the legislative powers of the citizens of Houston not be honored.\n\nIn re Jared Woodfill,__ S.W.3d __, __, 2015 WL 4498229 (Tex. 2015) (per curiam).\n\nWilson requests this Court to direct the court of appeals to dismiss the appeal styled\n\nAnnise D. Parker, Mayor, Anna Russell, City Secretary, and City of Houston v. David\n\nB. Wilson, 01-15-00687-CV, First Court of Appeals, Trial Court Number\n\n2015-39706, 270th District Court of Harris County, Texas, for want of jurisdiction,\n\nand certify that no further appeals are available.\n\n      Argument & Authorities Under Issue Two\n\n      A writ of mandamus will issue to compel a public official to perform a\n\nministerial act. M.D. Anderson v. City of Seven Points, 806 S.W. 2d 791, 793 (Tex.\n\n1991). An act is ministerial when the law clearly spells out the duty to be performed\n\nby the official with sufficient certainty that nothing is left to the exercise of\n\ndiscretion. Id. Generally, entitlement to mandamus relief is subject to establishing\n\n                                       Page -18-\n\fthree requisites: a legal duty to perform a non-discretionary act, a demand for\n\nperformance, and a refusal. In re Cullar, 320 S.W. 3d 560, 564 (Tex.App.-Dallas\n\n2010) citing O'Conner v. First Court of Appeals, 837 S.W. 2d 94, 97 (Tex. 1992). A\n\nwrit of mandamus is appropriate to compel a public official to perform a ministerial\n\nact. In Re Roof, 130 S.W. 3d 414, 416 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2004).\n\n      The Texas Government Code authorizes qualified voters of a municipality to\n\npropose amendments to the city's charter. Texas Government Code § 9.004(a)\n\nSpecifically § 9.004(a) provides in relevant part:\n\n             .... The governing body shall submit a proposed charter\n             amendment to the voters for their approval at an election if\n             a petition signed by a number of qualified voters of the\n             municipality equal to at least five percent of the number of\n             qualified voters of the municipality or 20,000, whichever\n             number is smaller, supports the submission.\n\n\n      Because Texas Government Code 9.004 does not designate a particular person\n\nto count and certify the number of petitions, we look to other sources of law to make\n\nthe determination. Houston's City Charter, the Texas Election Code, and the Texas\n\nSupreme Court placed the duty and responsibility on the City Secretary. The Houston\n\nCity Secretary admits to performing the function. It is undisputed that Wilson\n\nsubmitted over 22,000 petitions to Anna Russell, Houston’s city secretary.\n\n      This Court has recently addressed a number of refusals by the City of Houston\n\n                                      Page -19-\n\fand its officers to recognize citizen initiatives. The Texas Supreme Court, on July 24,\n\n2015 conditionally issued a writ of mandamus in In Re Woodfill over a referendum\n\nto repeal Houston's Equal Rights Ordinance. See In re Jared Woodfill,__ S.W.3d __,\n\n__, 2015 WL 4498229 (Tex. 2015) (per curiam). More recently, In re F.N. Williams,\n\nSr., No. 15-0581 (Tex. August 19 2015), the Court granted a mandamus concerning\n\nHouston officials’ ministerial duties. In Woodfill, this Court wrote\"This dispute\n\nconcerns the duties of the City Secretary and the City Council of Houston when a\n\nreferendum petition is filed.\" After examining the Houston City Charter, this Court\n\ndetermined the responsibilities for counting petitions lies with the Houston City\n\nSecretary:\n\n             The filing of a \"signed and verified\" petition in the\n             prescribed form and manner triggers the City Secretary's\n             duties. The Charter commits the following responsibilities\n             to the City Secretary:\n             On or before the thirtieth day after the date of filing of the\n             petition the City Secretary shall certify to the City Council\n             (a) the greatest total vote cast for Mayor at any city general\n             election held within three years next preceding the date of\n             the filing of such petition, and\n             (b) the number of valid signatures on said petition, and\n             shall present such petition and certificate to the Council.\n\nCiting Houston City Charter Art. VII-b, § 2(b).\n\n      On or before the 30th day after the date of filing of the petition the City\n\nSecretary shall certify to the City Council the number of valid signatures on said\n\n                                       Page -20-\n\fpetition, and shall present such petition and certificate to the Council. The Houston\n\nCity Secretary, Anna Russell, has refused to perform this simple, ministerial act. For\n\nsimilar reasons set forth in Woodfill and Williams this court should direct Anna\n\nRussell, City Secretary, to certify to the City Council the number of valid signatures\n\non said petition, and shall present such petition and certificate to the Houston City\n\nCouncil.\n\n\n\n\n                                      Page -21-\n\f                                       PRAYER\n\n       WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Real Party In Interest prays that\n\nthe Court direct the court of appeals to immediately dismiss the appeal in No.\n\n01-15-00687-CV, or alternative to direct Anna Russell, City Secretary to certify to\n\nthe City Council the number of valid signatures on the petitions submitted by Relator,\n\nand after Russell counts if the requisite number of signatures are present that city\n\ncouncil either adopt the petition or place it on the November 3 ballot, and for such\n\nother and further relief as is just.\n\n                                        Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                        ___/S/James D.

The Court has jurisdiction under\n\nsection 51.014(a)(4) of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code. The\n\nparties have briefed the issue of jurisdiction in response to the Court’s Order of\n\nAugust 19, 2015.\n\n\n\n                     Statement Regarding Oral Argument\n\n      The underlying lawsuit seeks to place a proposition on the November\n\n2015 ballot. The deadline to do so has passed and therefore both the\n\nunderlying lawsuit and the order appealed from are moot. Appellants do not\n\nbelieve oral argument would substantially aid the Court’s decisional process on\n\nthis issue. However, if the Court reaches the merits, oral argument may be\n\n\n\n\n                                        ix\n\fhelpful on the issue of why the trial court’s July 28, 2015 Order of mandamus\n\nwas error. For this reason, Appellants conditionally request oral argument.\n\n\n                                 Statement of the Case\n\n       Nature of the Case: Suit to compel the City Secretary to certify to the City\n\nCouncil the number of valid signatures on a petition submitted by David B.\n\nWilson (Wilson) purportedly to amend the City Charter, but in reality to alter\n\nthe definition of “gender identity” in the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance\n\n(“equal rights ordinance” or “HERO”).\n\n       Course of Proceedings: On July 9, 2015, Wilson presented a petition to the\n\nCity Secretary attempting to alter the definition of “gender identity” found in\n\nthe equal rights ordinance, but calling it a petition to amend the City Charter.\n\nCR.9. It is undisputed the City Secretary took no action to count the signatures\n\nat that time. On July 10, 2015, Wilson sued, seeking a writ of mandamus to\n\ncompel the City Secretary to count the signatures. CR.4-14. Over the City’s\n\nobjection to proceeding without proper notice, on July 24, 2015, the trial court\n\nheld a hearing on the application for mandamus relief. CR.38; 2RR.1.1\n\n\n\n\n1\n  The Reporter’s Record filed in this appeal consists of two volumes, but each volume is\nlabeled “Volume 1 of 1.” Thus, in this brief, Appellants cite to the July 13, 2015 hearing as\n“1RR.___” and to the July 24 hearing as “2RR.___.”\n\n\n\n                                             x\n\f      Disposition: On July 28, 2015, the court ordered the City Secretary to\n\n“count and certify to Houston City Council the number of valid signatures\n\ncontained in the petition.” CR.74 (App. A). Under the Order, the City\n\nSecretary was to complete this task within 30 days of the date the petition was\n\noriginally filed. CR.74. The defendants, the City Secretary, Mayor Parker, and\n\nthe City of Houston (referred to collectively as “the City”) filed a notice of\n\ninterlocutory appeal, pursuant to Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code\n\n§ 51.014(a)(4). CR.91-93.\n\n      Trial Court: The Honorable Brent Gamble, Harris County, Texas, 270th\n\nJudicial District Court.\n\n\n                               Issues Presented\n\n      1.    It is too late for Wilson to obtain the relief he pled for,\n            inclusion of his proposition as a ballot item in the November\n            2015 election. Therefore, both the July 28, 2015 Order and\n            the underlying lawsuit are moot and must be dismissed.\n\n      2.    The trial court erred by requiring the City Secretary to count\n            the signatures. The petition filed by Wilson is not a charter\n            amendment but a referendum; as such, its filing was\n            untimely and triggered no duty for the City Secretary to\n            count the valid signatures or certify the number to City\n            Council.\n\n      3.    The trial court abused its discretion in making what\n            effectively was a merits decision without giving the City of\n            Houston proper notice of trial.\n\n\n\n\n                                       xi\n\f4.   The trial court abused its discretion when it entered an order\n     that was in effect a temporary injunction, but without proof\n     of a probable right to relief or irreparable injury, and without\n     meeting the procedural requirements of specificity and a\n     bond under Texas Rules of Civil Procedure 683 and 684.\n\n\n\n\n                                xii\n\f                                    Statement of Facts\n\n       On May 28, 2014, the Houston City Council voted to pass Ordinance\n\nNo. 2014-530, known as the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, also referred to\n\nas “HERO.” Supp.CR.___2 (App. B). The ordinance was officially published\n\non June 3, 2014. The equal rights ordinance prohibits discrimination based on\n\nan individual’s sex, race, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, familial status,\n\nmarital status, religion, disability, sexual orientation, genetic information,\n\ngender identity, or pregnancy in city contracts, public accommodations,\n\nprivate employment (excluding religious organizations), city services, city\n\nemployment and housing. Supp.CR.___ (App. B). The ordinance included a\n\ndefinition of “gender identity.” Supp.CR.___ (App. B). This is the only place\n\nin the entire City Code of Ordinances or City Charter where “gender identity”\n\nis ever mentioned.\n\n       The equal rights ordinance was the subject of a timely-filed referendum\n\nto repeal the ordinance, which eventually was the subject of a jury trial3 and a\n\n\n\n\n2\n  Appellants’ exhibits were requested but were not included in the original Clerk’s Record.\nThe Appellants have requested a Supplemental Clerk’s Record to correct the error. Because\nthe Supplemental Record was not filed by the deadline for this brief, Appellants will file an\namended brief to include all citations to the supplemental record.\n3\n Woodfill, et al. v.

CR.61. Under the\n\nCity Charter, a referendum on an ordinance must be filed within 30 days of the\n\nday the ordinance was published and must conform to specific “form and\n\nmanner” requirements, including a requirement that there be a circulator’s\n\naffidavit on every page.5 Wilson’s petition was an untimely referendum and\n\ndid not conform to those requirements. The City Secretary took no action to\n\ncount the signatures at that time.\n\n         Wilson alleged his petition was not a referendum on the ordinance but\n\nwas instead a “charter amendment.” CR.5. On July 10, 2015, the next day, he\n\nfiled in the district court a pleading entitled “Original Petition for Mandamus”\n\nagainst the City Secretary, the Mayor, and the City of Houston. CR.4. Wilson\n\npled for “mandatory injunctive relief to require each of the Respondents to fulfill\n\ntheir ministerial duties.” CR.12 (emphasis added).

Before the City was\n\nserved with the Petition, it was served with a “Notice of Hearing” setting a\n\n“Motion to Mandamus” for hearing on Monday, July 13, 2015 at 9:00 a.m.,\n\nthree days after the petition had been filed. CR.15.\n\n      At the July 13, 2015 hearing, the Court sustained the City’s objection to\n\nproceeding with insufficient notice. Wilson amended his lawsuit and\n\nimmediately reset the mandamus to July 24, 2015. CR.23, 30. In the first\n\namended petition, Wilson dropped his allegations against the City and the\n\nMayor, and asserted a claim for a declaratory judgment with respect to the\n\nduty of the City Secretary.6 CR.27. He also removed the request for injunctive\n\nrelief. CR.27.\n\n      Just two weeks after the original petition was filed, the trial judge held a\n\nhearing on Wilson’s petition for writ of mandamus. Wilson offered no\n\nevidence at the hearing, but in argument asked the court to grant immediate\n\nemergency relief. 2RR.35:18-23. On July 28, 2015, the trial court entered an\n\norder that\n\n\n\n\n6\n The City and Mayor were still named as parties but the only claims in the body of the\npetition were against the City Secretary. Wilson later also added claims against City\nCouncil members.

Supp.CR.___. On August 7,\n\n2015, the City timely filed a notice of interlocutory appeal and superseded the\n\norder. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 51.014(a)(4) and 6.002; Tex. R.

Council did\n\nnot repeal the ordinance and voted to put it on the ballot in November, 2015.\n\nIn a second opinion regarding the language required on the ballot, the\n\nSupreme Court held that the vote was to “submit the ordinance” for the voters’\n\napproval; it was not a vote to “repeal” the ordinance.

Aug. 19, 2015). Therefore whether the equal rights\n\nordinance, including its definition of “gender identity,” should be included in\n\n\n                                        4\n\fthe Code of Ordinances will be voted on by the voters in the City of Houston\n\nin the November 2015 election.\n\n\n                          Summary of the Argument\n\n      The Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, if approved by the voters, will\n\nprohibit discrimination in city employment and city services, city contracts,\n\npublic accommodations, private employment, and housing. Like others who\n\nhave opposed the Ordinance, Wilson’s objection to it has always been focused\n\non its definition of “gender identity.” Wilson is concerned about the effect of\n\nthis provision on the safety of public bathrooms.\n\n      The substantive issue raised by this lawsuit is whether Wilson’s petition\n\nto submit to the voters a definition of “gender identity” contrary to that in the\n\nequal rights ordinance was in form and effect a petition for an amendment to\n\nthe City of Houston Charter, as he claims, or whether it was a referendum to\n\nrepeal a term of the ordinance. The answer to that question is fundamental to\n\nwhether Wilson was entitled to the relief he sought—that the City Secretary be\n\nordered to count and certify the number of valid signatures in time for the\n\nNovember 2015 election.\n\n      The City was faced with the same issue in a challenge to its red-light\n\ncamera ordinance in 2010, where it accepted the citizens’ characterization of\n\nthe petition as a charter amendment. A federal district court ultimately ruled\n\n                                       5\n\fthat the City was wrong not to look beyond the “label” of the petition, holding\n\nit is the “character and effect” of the proposition, not the “label” on it, that\n\ndetermines if it is a charter amendment or a referendum on an ordinance. City\n\nof Houston v. Am. Traffic Solutions, Inc., No. H-10-4545, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2462670</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (S.D.\n\nTex. June 17, 2011).\n\n      Here, the trial court never answered the basic question of the character of\n\nWilson’s petition. It accepted Wilson’s label and on that faulty foundation\n\nentered an order unsupported by either fact or law. For that reason alone, the\n\norder compelling the City Secretary to count and certify the number of valid\n\nsignatures was error. CR.74. The City Secretary had no ministerial duty to\n\ncount signatures because the petition was, in “character and effect,” a\n\nreferendum to repeal the definition of “gender identity” in the equal rights\n\nordinance and was untimely. Further, even accepting Wilson’s label of the\n\npetition as a charter amendment, he could point to nothing establishing a clear\n\nduty for the City Secretary to perform any action within the 30-day time limit\n\nhe sued for.\n\n      But although these substantive issues are important, several procedural\n\nissues should preclude the Court from ever reaching them. First and most\n\nimportant, Wilson’s lawsuit, as well as the July 28 Order, are now moot.\n\nWilson’s pleadings in the trial court sought immediate relief in order to meet\n\n\n                                       6\n\fthe deadlines for the November 2015 election. Even while the case was\n\npending in this Court, he went directly to the Texas Supreme Court seeking a\n\nwrit of mandamus, arguing there was a compelling reason to do so because\n\nwithout immediate relief it would “likely be too late” for his proposition to be\n\nplaced on the November 2015 ballot.7 The deadline for items to be placed on\n\nthe ballot is now passed and Wilson’s claims, along with the July 28 Order, are\n\nmoot. A lawsuit on his proposition to redefine “gender identity” will not be\n\nripe until and if the citizens of the City of Houston vote in favor of the equal\n\nrights ordinance.\n\n      The trial court also abused its discretion in the procedure it followed. A\n\ntrial court mandamus is not a common procedure, but the Texas Supreme\n\nCourt has made clear it is a civil action and is subject to the rules of procedure\n\njust as in any other suit. Anderson v. City of Seven Points, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1519282\"><a href=\"/opinion/1519282/anderson-v-city-of-seven-points/\"><span class=\"volume\">806</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">791</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 792\n\n(Tex. 1991). It is not in itself a basis for emergency injunctive relief.\n\nNevertheless, over the City’s objection, the trial court held a hearing on the\n\npetition for writ of mandamus just fourteen days after Wilson filed suit and\n\nfour days later entered an order granting Wilson the relief he sought—all\n\nbefore even the deadline for filing an original answer had passed. The failure to\n\n\n7\n See In re Wilson, No. 15-0636, in the Texas Supreme Court, Petition for Writ of\nMandamus, p. 12. (Copy attached as App. C.)\n\n\n\n                                        7\n\ffollow the rules of procedure, including allowing at least 45-days’ notice of a\n\ntrial setting on the petition for writ of mandamus, was a clear abuse of\n\ndiscretion.\n\n      In fact, although he noticed the July 24 hearing as a hearing on the\n\npetition for writ of mandamus, the relief Wilson sought, and that the trial court\n\ngranted, was injunctive—a mandatory injunction under Rule 687 of the Texas\n\nRules of Civil Procedure. The City Secretary was clearly required to “obey and\n\nexecute such order as the judge has seen proper to make,” the definition of a\n\nmandatory injunction. Tex. R. Civ. P. 687. It is the character and function of\n\nan order, not its title, that determine its classification.\n\n      But although it granted injunctive relief, the July 28 Order was\n\nunsupported by any witness testimony or documentary evidence, did not “set\n\nforth the reasons for its issuance,” did not set a trial date, and was not\n\nsupported by a bond. Tex. R. Civ. P. 683, 684. The Order fails to comply with\n\nany of the evidentiary or procedural requirements for an injunction.\n\n      For all of these reasons, the trial court erred in signing the order. This\n\nCourt should find Wilson’s lawsuit moot, and declare the order of July 28,\n\n2015 void. If the Court does not find the lawsuit moot, it should reverse and\n\nvacate the order.\n\n\n\n\n                                           8\n\f                                     Argument\n\nI.

The trial court erred in entering the July 28, 2015 Order.\n\n       If the Court does not dismiss the underlying case as moot and reaches\n\nthe merits of this appeal, it should find a) that Wilson’s petition was a\n\nreferendum to repeal the definition of “gender identity” in the equal rights\n\nordinance, not a charter amendment; b) that the City Secretary had no duty to\n\ncount and certify the signatures; c) that the trial court failed to comply with the\n\nrules of procedure; and d) that the court’s order was a temporary injunction\n\nunsupported by evidence of a probable right to relief or irreparable injury.\n\n       A.    Wilson’s petition was an untimely referendum, not a charter\n             amendment.\n\n       Wilson’s petition was an untimely effort to repeal the definition of\n\n“gender identity” in the equal rights ordinance. He cannot change its character\n\nby claiming it is something else. The nature of the petition is fundamental to\n\nunderstanding why the trial court erred in ordering the City Secretary to count\n\nand certify the signatures.\n\n       This is not the first time this issue has arisen in Houston. In City of\n\nHouston v. American Traffic Solutions, Inc., federal district judge Lynn Hughes\n\nconsidered whether a petition to remove red light cameras was a charter\n\namendment or a referendum. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2462670</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. The issues in that case are\n\nalmost identical to those here, and Judge Hughes’ opinion provides a clear\n\nroadmap for analyzing whether Wilson’s petition is a charter amendment as he\n\n                                        13\n\fclaims, or a mislabeled petition to repeal a part of the equal rights ordinance.\n\nThe effect of the proposed amendment is key to that distinction.\n\n      ATS arose from a controversy regarding the use of cameras to record\n\ncars running red lights, resulting in penalties to the car owners. Id., at *1. The\n\nCity adopted an ordinance to use the cameras and two years later hired ATS to\n\ninstall the cameras, administer the notices to car owners, and collect the\n\npenalties. Four years after the cameras were installed, a citizen group\n\npetitioned the City for an election to amend the City Charter to disallow the\n\nuse of cameras. The City accepted the petition as the citizens characterized it,\n\nas a petition to amend the City Charter, and called a special election. A\n\nmajority of the voters agreed that the cameras should not be used. As a result,\n\nthe City amended its Charter and then cancelled its contract with ATS.\n\n      ATS sued the City in federal court for breach of contract, arguing that\n\nthe charter amendment was invalid. ATS argued that the citizen’s petition was\n\nin reality a referendum targeted to repeal a specific ordinance. The validity of\n\nthe election, and the City’s right to cancel the contract, depended on the nature\n\nof the petition.\n\n      The court explained the differences in the City Charter and ordinances:\n\n      The charter, like a constitution, structures the government;\n      ordinances, like statutes, make policy choices for their operation.\n      Charters create officers, specify election or appointment, prohibit\n      types and levels of taxation, and similar elemental things.\n\n                                       14\n\f      Ordinances set speed limits, reorganize departments, appropriate,\n      and similar managerial things. Although this distinction may blur\n      at the edge, charters and ordinances are different and must be\n      distinguishable. The rules of Texas and Houston call for them to\n      be treated differently.\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2462670</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2.\n\n      Ordinances, like statutes, “control the ordinary operations of the city.”\n\nId., at *1. The nature of the proposition regarding red-light cameras was like a\n\nstatute and the text of the proposition voted on at the election was taken from\n\nthe ordinance. If passed, the effect of the proposition would be to repeal the\n\nordinance—it could not be enforced with that charter amendment on the\n\nbooks. In short, “[b]oth the ordinance and the amendment are about exactly\n\nthe same thing.” Id., at *2. Judge Hughes held that “given its effect, the\n\nproposition is a referendum.” Id., at *3. Because a referendum petition must be\n\nfiled within 30 days of the adoption of the ordinance, it was untimely. Id.\n\n      Like the anti-red light petition in ATS, the nature of Wilson’s proposition\n\nto redefine “gender identity” is like a statute. It reflects a policy choice for\n\noperation of city government. In addition, the significant language of the\n\nproposition is taken from the definition of “gender identity” in the equal rights\n\nordinance:\n\n\n\n\n                                       15\n\f                                    Except as required by State or Federal\nGender identity means an individual’s\ninnate identification, appearance,  law, the City of Houston shall only\n                                    define gender identify [sic] as an\nexpression or behavior as either male\nor female, although the same may notindividual innate identification, as\ncorrespond to the individual’s body or\n                                    either a male or female which is\ngender as assigned at birth.        assigned at birth. Perceived or\n                                    expressed gender identification is not\nEqual Rights Ordinance, § 17-1. allowed in defining gender identify\nSupp.CR.___ (emphasis added). (App. [sic].\nB).\n                                    Plaintiff’s Second Amended Pet., ¶ 7.\n                                    CR. 77 (emphasis added).\n\n\n      The effect of the proposition would be to repeal the protections of the\n\nequal rights ordinance (if passed) for one of its protected groups. In short, just\n\nlike the red-light camera proposition, Wilson’s petition was in nature and effect\n\na referendum to repeal a part of the ordinance. Wilson mislabeled the petition\n\na charter amendment because he filed it far too late to meet the 30-day\n\nreferendum deadline. See, City of Houston Charter, art. VII-b, §§ 2(b), (3).\n\nCalling this a petition for a charter amendment does not make it so. It is an\n\nuntimely referendum.\n\n      In ATS, Judge Hughes quoted Abraham Lincoln: “If Congress said that\n\na goat’s tail was a leg, how many legs would a goat have? Four. Calling a tail a\n\nleg does not make it so.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2462670</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *3. Wilson calling his\n\nreferendum a “charter amendment” does not make it so.\n\n\n\n\n                                       16\n\f      B.     Wilson’s proposed definition of “gender identity” is not\n             relevant to Section 22 of the City Charter; it is based on and\n             directly opposed to the definition of “gender identity” in the\n             equal rights ordinance.\n\n      In his First Amended Petition, Wilson clearly identified “Ordinance No.\n\n2014-530, Art. 17-2,” the equal rights ordinance, as his target:\n\n      The proposed Charter Amendment will benefit the people of\n      Houston in that it will aid to law enforcement officers in protecting\n      young boys and girls using the public restrooms from those people\n      that would enter a public restroom of the opposite sex with the\n      intent to gratify their sexual perversions by watching others. Under\n      a current ordinance, gender identification is too broadly defined to\n      protect children from child predators and provides: City Ordinance\n      No. 2014-530, Article 17-2 provides: Gender Identity means an\n      individual’s innate identification, appearance, expression or\n      behavior as either male or female, although the same may not\n      correspond to the individual’s body or gender as assigned at birth.\n\nCR.26.\n\n      To try to avoid the fact that his referendum was untimely, Wilson claimed\n\nhis petition seeks to amend not the equal rights ordinance, but Section 22 of the\n\nCity Charter. CR.24. But Section 22 does not in any way address gender\n\nidentity; it concerns employment benefits for City employees and those doing\n\nbusiness with the City. Section 22 provides, in part:\n\n      Except as required by State or Federal law, the City of Houston\n      shall not provide employment benefits, including health care, to\n      persons other than employees, their legal spouses and dependent\n      children; nor shall the City provide any privilege in promotion,\n      hiring, or contracting to a person or group on the basis of sexual\n      preference, either by a vote of the city council or an executive\n      order by the Mayor. Further, the City of Houston shall not require\n\n                                         17\n\f      entities doing business with the City to have any of the above\n      benefits or policies.\n\nSupp.CR.___.\n\n      Section 22 does not use the term “gender identity”; and following\n\nObergefell v. Hodges, the term “legal spouses” is not impacted by gender. 135 S.\n\nCt. 2584 (2015). Neither does Section 22 concern sex-segregated restrooms.\n\nThe term “gender identity” is nowhere found in the City Charter.\n\n      That Wilson’s true goal was to repeal the definition of gender identity in\n\nthe equal rights ordinance is also evidenced by his letter accompanying the\n\nJune, 2015 petition drive. There, Wilson referenced what he referred to as the\n\n“Bathroom Ordinance”:\n\n      You may have heard that the two previous petition drives\n      challenging and seeking to reverse Mayor Parker’s Bathroom\n      Ordinance are either tied up in court or rejected by the City.\n\nSupp.CR.___ (emphasis added).\n\n      The cover letter he sent with the April, 2015 petition again identified the\n\ntarget of his efforts:\n\n      The City of Houston Mayor Parker is pushing her personal\n      homosexual agenda with Executive Order (1-50) and City of\n      Houston Ordinance (#2014-530) [the equal rights ordinance]\n      which allows men to use the women’s restroom if they perceive or\n      express themselves as women.\n\nSupp.CR.___ (emphasis added).\n\n\n\n\n                                       18\n\f      Wilson requested that the City Secretary count and certify the results of\n\nhis petition within 30 days, the time limit set out in Houston City Charter,\n\narticle VII-b, the City Charter provision governing referenda. The City Charter\n\ndoes not include a similar provision for charter amendments. Only state law\n\nprovides a source for citizen-initiated charter amendments, and it does not\n\ninclude any statute imposing a ministerial duty on a city secretary or any other\n\nofficial to count and certify within 30 days. Tex. Loc. Gov’t Code § 9.004.\n\n      Just like a court must look beyond the title of a pleading to its substance,\n\nneither the City nor this Court is bound to accept Wilson’s characterization of\n\nhis petition as a charter amendment.

The trial court erred in ordering the City Secretary to count and\n            certify the signatures.\n\n      As the federal court’s decision in ATS made clear, the City Secretary\n\ncould not simply accept Wilson’s “label” of his petition as a charter\n\namendment. The City Secretary had no ministerial duty to accept the petition\n\nor begin counting when the petition did not comply with City requirements as\n\nto form, content and procedure for a referendum. See, e.g., Escobar v.

Those\n\nprocedures assure an orderly process for challenging City ordinances in a\n\ntimely manner. The trial court’s order that the City Secretary count signatures\n\nand certify the number of valid signatures, even though Wilson had not met\n\nthe 30-day deadline for challenging a City ordinance, defeats that procedure.\n\n\n                                       20\n\f      And even accepting Wilson’s characterization of the petition as a charter\n\namendment, the trial court still abused its discretion because it ordered that the\n\nCity Secretary perform ministerial duties that are not clearly specified and\n\nsupported by law. A court cannot issue mandamus relief against a public\n\nofficial unless “the law clearly spells out the duty to be performed by the\n\nofficial with sufficient certainty that nothing is left to the exercise of\n\ndiscretion.” In re Jared Woodfill, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4498229</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *3 (quoting Anderson,\n\n806 S.W.2d at 793). See also Mattox, 305 S.W.3d at 380.\n\n      Wilson stated to the trial court that the relief he was seeking was under\n\nthe Local Government Code; he also admitted that nothing in that law\n\nrequired the City Secretary to count signatures for an amendment to the City\n\nCharter. 2RR.26 Nor does the Local Government Code mandate a 30-day\n\nperiod for signatures to be counted for a charter amendment. Tex. Loc. Gov’t\n\nCode § 9.004. Section 9.004 imposes no time limit for the governing body to\n\nsubmit a proposed charter amendment to the voters and no time limit for\n\ndetermining if a petition is signed by a number of qualified voters. Nothing in\n\nSection 9.004 imposes on the City Secretary a “clear duty” to count and certify\n\nsignatures for a charter amendment within 30 days of the date the petition is\n\ndelivered.\n\n\n\n\n                                       21\n\f      If Wilson is in fact seeking an amendment to the City Charter as he\n\nclaims and pleads, there was no duty for the City Secretary to comply within\n\n30 days. If, as the City asserts, the nature and effect of Wilson’s petition,\n\ndemonstrates that it is a referendum on the equal rights ordinance, it was\n\nuntimely. Either way, the trial court erred by ordering the City Secretary to\n\ncount and certify the signatures.\n\n\n      D.    The trial court abused its discretion by proceeding with the\n            mandamus proceeding without proper notice as required by the\n            Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\n      The trial court erred not only by the substance of the order, but also by\n\nthe procedure it followed. The court failed to comply with the rules of civil\n\nprocedure with respect to the hearing on the mandamus petition and in so\n\ndoing deprived the City of due process of law.\n\n      An original proceeding for a writ of mandamus issued in a trial court is a\n\ncivil action subject to trial and appeal on substantive law issues and is subject\n\nto rules of procedure just as any other civil suit. Anderson, 806 S.W.2d at 792.\n\nA mandamus must proceed to trial and judgment just as in any other action.\n\nId. “There is no distinguishable difference in principle in the course of\n\nproceeding and result attained in it and any other suit in the District Court.”\n\nId.\n\n\n\n                                       22\n\f      In his “Original Petition for Mandamus,” Wilson pled for “mandatory\n\ninjunctive relief to require each of the Respondents to fulfill their ministerial\n\nduties” and in his prayer sought “all further declaratory and injunctive relief to\n\nwhich Petitioners may show themselves to be justly entitled.” CR.12-13\n\n(emphasis added). Even before the City was served with the Petition, it was\n\nserved with a “Notice of Hearing” setting a “Motion to Mandamus” for\n\nhearing on Monday, July 13, 2015 at 9:00 a.m., three days after the petition\n\nhad been filed. CR.15.\n\n      The City objected to the short notice and the July 13 hearing was reset to\n\nJuly 24, 2015. CR.18, 30. By that time Wilson had amended his petition to add\n\na claim for declaratory relief. CR.27. While he dropped the direct references to\n\ninjunctive relief, Wilson still pled he had suffered and would continue to suffer\n\n“irreparable harm” and that he had “no other adequate remedy at law.”\n\nCR.26, 27. Fourteen days after the original petition was filed, Wilson had his\n\nhearing, but he offered no evidence to support his claims. Nevertheless, on\n\nJuly 28, 2015, the trial court entered an order that\n\n      Anna Russell in her capacity as City Secretary for the City of\n      Houston shall count and certify to Houston City Council the\n      number of valid signatures contained in the petition submitted by\n      Plaintiff on or before 30 (thirty) days from the date the same were\n      filed, namely July 9, 2015.\n\n\n\n\n                                        23\n\fCR.74.12\n\n      If the hearing on July 24, 2015 was in fact a hearing for final relief on a\n\npetition for writ of mandamus, the trial court abused its discretion when it\n\nfailed to follow the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure and proceeded with the\n\nhearing on insufficient notice. The City was entitled to a minimum of 20 days\n\nto prepare and serve an answer and to reasonable notice of not less than 45\n\ndays for trial, just as with any other lawsuit. Anderson, 806 S.W.2d at 792; Tex.\n\nR. Civ. P. 245. When a defendant makes an appearance in a case, as the City\n\nSecretary did here, the 45 days’ notice of a trial setting is a matter of due\n\nprocess and is mandatory. Tex. R. Civ.

The order purported to be a final ruling on “Plaintiff’s\n\nApplication for Writ of Mandamus.” CR.74. In this Court, Wilson disputes\n\n12\n  On July 30, 2015, Wilson again amended his petition to sue the City Council members\nand add a claim for money damages. City Council members were not parties to this suit at\nthe time the trial court entered its Order.\n\n\n\n                                          24\n\fthe order is in reality a temporary injunction. See Reply to Response to Notice\n\nto Show Court’s Appellate Jurisdiction, filed September 1, 2015. However, if\n\nthis order is, as Wilson contends, a final order on his petition for writ of\n\nmandamus, the Appellants should have been afforded forty-five days’ notice of\n\nthe hearing, as required by Rule 245 and due process.\n\n\n      E.    Wilson sought and received injunctive relief without meeting\n            the requirements of a temporary injunction.\n\n            1.    The order is a mandatory injunction.\n\n      The hearing on July 24, 2015 did not result in a final order on a petition\n\nfor writ of mandamus, but instead in an order that is, in its character and\n\nfunction, a temporary injunction. Wilson originally pled for injunctive relief\n\nand the relief he sought and obtained was injunctive relief.\n\n      Under Rule 687, a temporary injunction may be either prohibitive or\n\nmandatory—it may order a party to “desist and refrain from the commission\n\nor continuance of the act enjoined,” or to “obey and execute such order as the\n\njudge has seen proper to make.” Tex.

The July 28 order was mandatory.\n\nIt ordered that the City Secretary “shall count and certify to the Houston City\n\n\n                                       25\n\fCouncil the number of valid signatures.” CR.74. Although the order does not\n\nacknowledge it is a mandatory temporary injunction, the Texas Supreme\n\nCourt has long ago “rejected the notion that ‘matters of form control the nature\n\nof the order itself.’” Qwest, 24 S.W.3d at 336 (quoting Del Valle Indep.

The Court\n\nexplained:\n\n      In Del Valle Independent School District v. Lopez, we rejected the\n      notion that “matters of form control the nature of the order itself—\n      it is the character and function of an order that determine its\n      classification.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2429810\"><a href=\"/opinion/2429810/del-valle-indep-school-dist-v-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">845</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">808</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 809 (Tex. 1992). We reasoned\n      that if errors in the form of the order determined the order’s status,\n      then those errors would deny review of the very defects that render\n      the order void. See Del Valle, 845 S.W.2d at 809–10; Brines v.\n      McIlhaney, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1509118\"><a href=\"/opinion/1509118/brines-v-mcilhaney/\"><span class=\"volume\">596</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">519</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 523 (Tex.1980).\n\nQwest, 24 S.W.3d at 336.\n\n      The Fourteenth Court of Appeals’ recent decision in Helix similarly\n\nfound that an interlocutory order requiring a maritime employer to make\n\npayments to a seaman was a temporary injunction, even though it was labeled\n\n                                        26\n\fas an order granting a motion to compel. Helix, 452 S.W.3d at 44. Justice\n\nChristopher’s comment in that case applies equally here: “[Plaintiff] has not\n\ncited, and we have not found, any provision of Texas procedural law\n\nauthorizing a litigant to obtain an interlocutory order on the merits from a state\n\ncourt while avoiding both the rules governing summary judgments and those\n\ngoverning injunctive relief.” Id.\n\n      In his Original Petition for Writ of Mandamus, Wilson pled for\n\ninjunctive relief. CR.11, 13. Although he dropped the words “injunctive relief”\n\nfrom his First Amended Petition, the substantive relief he requested remained\n\nthe same. CR.27. The specific action the trial court ordered—that the City\n\nSecretary “count and certify” the signatures on a short deadline—is a classic\n\nexample of a mandatory temporary injunction. See, e.g., Helix, 452 S.W.3d at\n\n44.\n\n      There are no special provisions in the rules of civil procedure for\n\nimmediate, emergency relief in a suit seeking a trial court mandamus. A party\n\nwho files a petition for writ of mandamus in a district court and wants\n\nimmediate temporary relief has the same burden and must follow the same\n\nprocedures as in any other suit. He must seek temporary injunctive relief under\n\nRules 680-693 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. See Tobin v. Serna, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">277</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">176</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 177 (Tex.

See, e.g., Helix, 452 S.W.3d at 44 (holding\n\norder “to compel” payments was in reality a mandatory temporary injunction).\n\n       The July 28 Order was not the result of a summary judgment\n\nproceeding, a trial on the merits, or even an evidentiary hearing. At the time\n\nthe order was entered, there was still pending an asserted claim for a\n\ndeclaratory judgment. CR.27. Although all of the underlying claims are now\n\nmoot, at the time the July 28 Order was entered it was an interlocutory order,\n\nand in character and function it was a temporary injunction.\n\n\n              2.     Wilson did not prove a right to injunctive relief and the\n                     order does not comply with Rules 683 and 684.\n\n       The July 28 Order must be reviewed as a temporary injunction. To\n\nobtain a temporary injunction, the applicant must plead and prove: (1) a cause\n\nof action against the defendant; (2) a probable right to the relief sought; and\n\n(3) a probable, imminent, and irreparable injury in the interim.

He requested that his proposed amendment be submitted to\n\nthe voters in the next election. Houston City Secretary, Anna Russell, (“Russell”) had\n\nthe duty to count and certify the petitions. To date she has not performed this\n\nministerial duty.\n\n       On Wilson’s petition for writ of mandamus, the 270th District Court of Harris\n\nCounty granted Wilson mandamus relief to compel Russell to count and certify the\n\npetitions. (Appendix 1). Even after the order, Russell refused to perform her\n\nministerial duties. Instead, Russell filed a notice of Interlocutory Appeal1 calculated\n\nto cause Wilson and the 22,000 plus petition signers to miss an August 31, 2015\n\ndeadline to submit the proposed amendment to the voters.

Wilson moved to\n\ndismiss the appeal. (Appendix “4”). On August 19, 2015, the Court of Appeals\n\ndenied the motion, but indicated its concern that it lacked jurisdiction. (Appendix\n\n“2”).    It gave the Real Parties in Interest ten days to respond to its concern.\n\nUnfortunately August 29, 2015 (a Saturday), will likely be too late.

Pursuant to Texas Election Code § 277.001, and Texas\n\nGovernment Code § 9.004(a), Wilson collected approximately 22,000 petitions to\n\ndefine the term \"gender identity.\" The Petition sought to define gender identity as:\n\n              Except as required by State or Federal law, the City of\n              Houston shall only define gender identify as an individual's\n              innate identification, as either a male or female which is\n              assigned at birth.       Perceived or expressed gender\n              identification is not allowed in defining gender identify.\n              Further, the City of Houston shall require entities doing\n              business with the city to abide by the same definition of\n\n                                       Page -12-\n\f             gender identification.\"\n\n      On July 9, 2015, Wilson filed the petitions with the Anna Russell, the Houston\n\nCity Secretary. He requested that the petition be adopted by Houston City Council as\n\na Charter Amendment, or alternatively, submitted to the voters for a vote. Anna\n\nRussell refused to count or certify Wilson's petitions. On July 10, 2015, Wilson filed\n\nhis Original Petition for Writ of Mandamus with the 270th District Court of Harris\n\nCounty, Texas. On July 31, 2015, the district court conducted a hearing on Wilson's\n\nPetition for Writ of Mandamus. (Appendix “4”)        On July 28, 2015, the granted\n\nWilson's Petition for Writ of Mandamus with respect to Defendant, Anna Russell and\n\nordered her to count the petitions submitted by Wilson and to certify and present the\n\nsame to the Houston City Council by August 8, 2015. (Appendix “1\") On August 7,\n\n2015, the day before the Anna Russell was to have completed her count and\n\ncertification, she filed her notice of interlocutory appeal with the Court of Appeals.\n\n(Appendix “3\").\n\n\n\n\n                                       Page -13-\n\f                        STATEMENT OF JURISDICTION\n\n      This Court has jurisdiction to issue writs of mandamus under Texas\n\nConstitution Article 5, Section 6; Texas Government Code Section 22.221(a); Texas\n\nElection Code Section 273.061; and Tex. R. App. P. 52. No genuine issues of\n\nmaterial fact exist to divest this Court of mandamus jurisdiction. Relators are mindful\n\nof Tex. R. App. P. 52.3(c), which ordinarily requires Relators to file this Petition and\n\nMotion first with the Houston Court of Appeals, given that Court and this Court both\n\nhave original jurisdiction to review this matter. However, although a number of\n\nmatters were submitted to the Court of Appeals, given the time constraints, there is\n\nsimply not enough time to go through both Courts, and thus a “compelling reason”\n\nwithin the meaning of the rule applies here for Relators to file with this Court and not\n\nthe Houston Court of Appeals.\n\n\n\n\n                                       Page -14-\n\f                            SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\n\n       No interlocutory appeal lies from an interlocutory order granting a petition for\n\nwrit of mandamus issued by a Texas District Court.

Texas Government Code § 9.004(a)\n\nSpecifically § 9.004(a) provides in relevant part:\n\n             .... The governing body shall submit a proposed charter\n             amendment to the voters for their approval at an election if\n             a petition signed by a number of qualified voters of the\n             municipality equal to at least five percent of the number of\n             qualified voters of the municipality or 20,000, whichever\n             number is smaller, supports the submission.\n\n\n      Because Texas Government Code 9.004 does not designate a particular person\n\nto count and certify the number of petitions, we look to other sources of law to make\n\nthe determination. Houston's City Charter, the Texas Election Code, and the Texas\n\nSupreme Court placed the duty and responsibility on the City Secretary. The Houston\n\nCity Secretary admits to performing the function. It is undisputed that Wilson\n\nsubmitted over 22,000 petitions to Anna Russell, Houston’s city secretary.\n\n      This Court has recently addressed a number of refusals by the City of Houston\n\n                                      Page -19-\n\fand its officers to recognize citizen initiatives.

More recently, In re F.N. Williams,\n\nSr., No. 15-0581 (Tex. August 19 2015), the Court granted a mandamus concerning\n\nHouston officials’ ministerial duties. In Woodfill, this Court wrote\"This dispute\n\nconcerns the duties of the City Secretary and the City Council of Houston when a\n\nreferendum petition is filed.\" After examining the Houston City Charter, this Court\n\ndetermined the responsibilities for counting petitions lies with the Houston City\n\nSecretary:\n\n             The filing of a \"signed and verified\" petition in the\n             prescribed form and manner triggers the City Secretary's\n             duties.
