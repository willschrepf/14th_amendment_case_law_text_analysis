Riley, a 22 year old black man, was\nsentenced to death on the vote of a Delaware state jury in\nDecember 1982. If the time intervening between that\nsentence and this court's en banc consideration of the\nmatter has been lengthy, it is not because there has been\nundue delay at any stage but because the case raises\nlegitimate questions that go to the constitutionality of the\noriginal trial and sentencing. It was necessary to complete\na series of proceedings in both state and federal court, none\nof them duplicative, before the case reached this stage.\n\n                                  2\n\fAfter all, there can be no reconsideration after the\nexecution of a death sentence.\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nAccording to testimony at the trial, Riley and Tyrone\nBaxter stopped in a liquor store in Dover, Delaware, on\nFebruary 8, 1982, to get some beer and rob the store.\nMichael Williams waited in the car. Baxter testified that\nRiley, armed with a gun, placed a bottle of beer on the\ncounter and announced the store was being robbed. When\nthe store owner, James Feeley, a 59 year old white man,\nbacked away from the cash register, Baxter grabbed the\nmoney out of the cash drawer. Riley tried to take Feeley's\nwallet, but Feeley resisted. At Baxter's urging, Riley shot\nFeeley in the leg. Feeley, who was then hopping up and\ndown, apparently from the gunshot, said \"[Y]ou f 'ing\nniggers.\" App. at 327. As Riley and Baxter were proceeding\nto the door to leave, Feeley threw a wine bottle that struck\nRiley in the arm. Riley then shot Feeley in the chest, killing\nhim.\n\nIn May 1982, Riley, Baxter, and Williams were indicted\non charges of felony murder, intentional murder, first\ndegree robbery, possession of a deadly weapon during a\nfelony, and second degree conspiracy. Riley pled not guilty\nto all charges. Baxter pled guilty to first degree murder and\nwas sentenced to life imprisonment in exchange for his\ntestimony against Riley. The murder and weapon charges\nagainst Williams were also dropped in exchange for his\ntestimony against Riley, and he was subsequently convicted\nof the robbery and conspiracy charges.\n\nRiley was represented at trial by appointed counsel, a\ndefense-side civil litigator who had never represented a\ncriminal defendant in either a murder or a capital case. His\npretrial motions for co-counsel and funds for a private\ninvestigator were denied. The prosecutors in Riley's case\nwere James Liguori and Mark McNulty. Liguori, the lead\nprosecutor, was a friend and neighbor of Feeley's, and they\nbelonged to the same church.\n\n                               3\n\fThe State presented the testimony of Baxter, Williams,\nBaxter's mother (who testified that Riley spent the night\nbefore the robbery at her house), and a witness who\nreported that Riley's fingerprints were on a bottle of beer in\nthe liquor store. In defense, Riley testified that he was in\nPhiladelphia on the day of the murder celebrating his\nmother's birthday. However, Riley's mother did not testify in\nsupport of his alibi. The only witness Riley presented other\nthan himself was an inmate at the prison in which Baxter\nwas incarcerated, and he testified that Baxter had admitted\nto shooting Feeley.\n\nRiley was tried before and convicted on all counts by an\nall white jury in Kent County Superior Court (the Delaware\ntrial court) in December 1982. Four days after the verdict,\nthe jury proceeded to consider the penalty. The State\nsought the death penalty, relying only on Riley's felony\nmurder conviction and using the underlying robbery as the\nlone aggravating circumstance. Following a two-hour\npenalty hearing, the jury unanimously recommended a\nsentence of death which the court accepted. Riley was also\nsentenced to life imprisonment without parole for\nintentional murder, 20 years imprisonment for robbery, 5\nyears imprisonment for possession of a deadly weapon, and\n3 years imprisonment for conspiracy. Riley's attorney\nexplained to the trial court that he spent only 14 hours\npreparing for the penalty phase because he had been too\nbusy \"with the defense and the merits\" to spend more time\nbuilding a case in mitigation. App. at 443-444.\n\nRiley appealed his conviction and sentence on numerous\ngrounds. In July 1985, the Delaware Supreme Court\naffirmed, see Riley v. State, 496 A.2d 997 (Del. 1985)\n(hereafter \"Riley I\"), and the Supreme Court of the United\nStates denied certiorari, see Riley v. Delaware , 478 U.S.\n1022 (1986).\n\nRepresented by new counsel, Riley filed a motion for\npost-conviction relief in Kent County Superior Court in\nMarch 1987 before Judge Bush, the judge who had\npresided at the trial (the \"trial judge\"), alleging, inter alia,\nthat his trial counsel had provided ineffective assistance of\ncounsel and that the prosecution had exercised its\nperemptory challenges in a racially discriminatory manner\n\n                                4\n\fin violation of Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986). After\nthree days of evidentiary hearings limited to the ineffective\nassistance of counsel claim, the trial judge denied Riley's\nmotion. See State v. Riley, 1988 WL 47076 (Del. Super.\n1988) (hereafter \"Riley II\"). Riley then requested the\nSuperior Court consider reargument on his Batson claim.\nThe trial judge had passed away and Judge Steele of the\nSuperior Court (\"the hearing judge\") granted Riley's request\nfor reargument, finding that Riley had established a prima\nfacie case of discrimination under Batson . See State v.\nRiley, 1988 WL 130430, at *3 (Del. Super. 1988) (hereafter\n\"Riley III\"). After holding an evidentiary hearing, the hearing\njudge rejected Riley's Batson claim and all his other claims\nas well. See Riley v. State, No. 200, 1988 (Del. Super. Ct.\nApril 21, 1989), App. at 886 (hereafter \"Riley IV\"). On\nappeal, the Delaware Supreme Court again affirmed, see\nRiley v. State, 585 A.2d 719 (Del. 1990) (hereafter \"Riley\nV\"), and the Supreme Court of the United States again\ndenied certiorari, see Riley v. Delaware, 501 U.S. 1223\n(1991).\n\nOn August 12, 1991, Riley filed a petition for a writ of\nhabeas corpus in the United States District Court for the\nDistrict of Delaware pursuant to 28 U.S.C. S 2254. Again\nRiley obtained new lead counsel, although his post-\nconviction counsel remained as co-counsel. The District\nCourt denied Riley's request to amend his petition to add\ntwo additional claims and then denied his petition without\nan evidentiary hearing. See Riley v. Snyder, 840 F. Supp.\n1012 (D. Del. 1993) (hereafter \"Riley VI\"). Riley appealed,\nand this court held that the denial of his motion to amend\nwas an abuse of discretion and remanded the case so that\nRiley could raise all the issues he sought to raise in an\namended petition. See Riley v. Taylor, 62 F.3d 86 (3d Cir.\n1995) (hereafter \"Riley VII\").\n\nRiley filed his amended habeas petition on August 28,\n1995, alleging 12 grounds for relief. The District Court\ndenied Riley's petition without holding an evidentiary\nhearing. See Riley v. Taylor, 1998 WL 172856 (D. Del. Jan.\n16, 1998) (hereafter \"Riley VIII\"). We then issued a\ncertificate of probable cause and Riley appealed, raising 12\nclaims. He asserted that:\n\n                               5\n\f1. The State's exercise of peremptory challeng es to\nstrike all prospective black jurors violated the\nEqual Protection Clause under Batson v.\nKentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986).\n\n2. The State's continuing conduct in withholdi ng\nwiretap tapes of a key witness from Riley violated\nBrady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963).\n\n3. Riley received ineffective assistance of co unsel\nbecause he was prejudiced by trial counsel's\ndeficient performance at the penalty hearing.\n\n4. The trial court violated Riley's Sixth and\nFourteenth Amendment rights by denying his\nmotions to appoint co-counsel and a private\ninvestigator.\n\n5. The prosecution and the trial court made\nimproper remarks at the penalty hearing violating\nthe Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments under\nCaldwell v. Mississippi, 472 U.S. 320 (1985).\n\n6. The trial court failed to probe equivocal r esponses\nduring the death penalty voir dire in violation of\nWitherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 510 (1968).\n\n7. Riley's jury was unconstitutionally biased in favor\nof returning the death penalty because the trial\njudge's voir dire failed to identify all prospective\njurors who automatically would impose the death\npenalty.\n\n8. Riley was deprived of his constitutional ri ght to a\nfair and impartial jury because of pretrial\npublicity.\n\n9. The Delaware Supreme Court's proportionalit y\nreview violated Riley's Eighth and Fourteenth\nAmendment rights.\n\n10. The trial court's jury instructions failed\nadequately to guide Riley's jurors on the law,\nthereby creating a substantial risk that the jurors\nwould impose the death penalty in an arbitrary\nand capricious manner in violation of both the\nEighth and Fourteenth Amendments.\n\n                        6\n\f       11. The use of felony murder to establish both Riley's\n       eligibility for death and the aggravating\n       circumstance warranting imposition of the death\n       penalty is arbitrary and capricious in violation of\n       the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.\n\n       12. The District Court abused its discretion in not\n       holding an evidentiary hearing, in denying Riley's\n       motions to conduct discovery and expand the\n       record, and in denying Riley's applications for\n       funds for medical and investigative experts.\n\nA divided panel of this court affirmed. See Riley v. Taylor,\n2001 WL 43597 (3d Cir. 2001) (hereafter \"Riley IX\"). The\nauthor of this opinion dissented on two claims, those\nraising Batson and Caldwell violations (claims numbered 1\nand 5 above). On March 5, 2001, the full court granted\nRiley's petition for rehearing en banc, and vacated the\npanel's opinion and judgment. See Riley v. Taylor, 237 F.3d\n348 (3d Cir. 2001). Our order limited the en banc\nproceedings to the District Court's denial of Riley's Batson\nand Caldwell claims. See id. We now reverse and direct the\nDistrict Court to grant the writ of habeas corpus. 1\n\nThe District Court exercised subject matter jurisdiction\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. S 2254. We possess appellate\njurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. SS 1291 and 2253.\n\nII.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nRiley presents two arguments to the en banc court. He\nargues first, that the prosecution exercised its peremptory\nchallenges to strike black jurors in violation of the Equal\nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and\nsecond, that the prosecutor's statements to the jury in his\nopening argument at sentencing misled the jury regarding\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. Our en banc order vacated the panel opinion and judgment in full. We\nwill reinstate the portion of the panel opinion authored by Judge Alito\nthat disposed of Riley's ten other claims, and append it hereto as\nAppendix A.\n\n                               7\n\fits role in the sentencing process in violation of the Eighth\nand Fourteenth Amendments. We will address each of these\narguments in turn.\n\nA.\n\nTHE BATSON CLAIM\n\nRiley's claim that the prosecution violated the Equal\nProtection Clause by using its peremptory challenges to\nstrike all three prospective black jurors from the jury panel\nbecause of their race, thereby leaving no black juror sitting\non the jury, stems from the Supreme Court decision in\nBatson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986).2\n\n1. Preservation of Claim\n\nThe District Court held that Riley was procedurally\nbarred from raising his Batson claim in his habeas petition\nbecause he failed to present that claim to the trial court.\nSee Riley VIII, 1998 WL 172856, at *15. We do not agree.3\nThe Delaware Supreme Court concluded on Riley's direct\nappeal \"that no Sixth Amendment peremptory challenge\nclaim was fairly presented to the Trial Court,\" and also\nheld, in the alternate, that Riley's Batson claim failed on\nthe merits. Riley I, 496 A.2d at 1010. However, the\nSupreme Court of the United States has since made clear\nthat, \"[i]f the last state court to be presented with a\nparticular federal claim reaches the merits, it removes any\nbar to federal-court review that might otherwise have been\navailable.\" Ylst v. Nunnemaker, 501 U.S. 797, 801 (1991).\n\nIn his memorandum opinion granting Riley's motion for a\npost-conviction evidentiary hearing, the Superior Court\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. Although Riley's trial occurred several years before the Batson\ndecision, the Supreme Court did not deny certiorari in Riley's direct\nappeal until shortly after Batson was decided, thus entitling Riley to the\nbenefit of that decision. See Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U.S. 314, 328\n(1987); Deputy v. Taylor, 19 F.3d 1485, 1491 n.6 (3d Cir. 1994).\n\n3. Much of the discussion of procedural bar is taken from the opinion of\nJudge Alito from the panel opinion that was vacated. See Riley IX, 2001\nWL 43597, at *2-*6.\n\n                               8\n\fhearing judge stated that he did not think the State\nSupreme Court would maintain its position that Riley had\nfailed to timely present a Batson claim. See Riley III, 1988\nWL 130430, at *2 (citing Baynard v. State, 518 A.2d 682\n(Del. 1986)).4 Thereafter, the hearing judge considered and\nrejected Riley's Batson claim on the merits. See Riley IV,\nApp. at 887-891. On appeal, the Delaware Supreme Court\naffirmed the hearing judge's decision, using language that\nexpressly refers to the Superior Court's rejection of Riley's\nBatson claim on the merits. See infra note 9. Moreover, in\nthat passage, the Delaware Supreme Court expressly\nreaffirmed its holding on direct appeal that the\nprosecution's use of peremptory challenges in this case did\nnot violate the state constitution. Not only is there no\nreaffirmation of its prior holding concerning procedural\ndefault, but there is no reference to that holding, leading us\nto conclude it no longer relied on a procedural bar. See\nHarris v. Reed, 489 U.S. 255, 266 (1989) (concluding that\nhabeas claim was not procedurally barred where state court\nrejected the claim on the merits notwithstanding its\nobservation that allegations \"could have been raised [on]\ndirect appeal\").\n\nIf the Delaware Supreme Court had continued to believe\nat the time of its most recent decision that Riley's Batson\nclaim was foreclosed for failure to make a proper objection\nat the time of trial, it seems likely that the Court would\nhave made that point expressly, instead of affirming the\nhearing judge's findings on the merits. Indeed, it is unlikely\nthat it would have made no comment on the hearing\njudge's failure to follow its earlier decision on foreclosure.\nThus, we interpret the decision of the Delaware Supreme\nCourt in Riley V (its most recent) to be a rejection of Riley's\nBatson claim on the merits. Accordingly, Riley's Batson\nclaim is not procedurally barred and we proceed to examine\nits merits.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4. In Baynard, the Court held that the defendant sufficiently raised an\nobjection to the State's peremptory challenges which resulted in an all\nwhite jury being impaneled where defendant \"noted the race of each\nblack against whom the State exercised a peremptory challenge,\" \"moved\nthe Court to refuse the peremptory challenges against two of the drawn\nblack jurors and moved to quash the entire panel at the end of the jury\nselection process.\" 518 A.2d at 687.\n\n                               9\n\f2. Batson v. Kentucky\n\nIn Batson, the Supreme Court reiterated the well-settled\nprinciple that the Equal Protection Clause prohibits\ndiscrimination on account of race in selection of both the\nvenire and the petit jury. See 476 U.S. at 88. This principle,\nwhich dates back at least as far as Strauder v. West\nVirginia, 100 U.S. 303 (1880), recognizes that racial\ndiscrimination in the selection of jurors harms\"not only the\naccused whose life or liberty they are summoned to try,\"\nbut also harms the potential juror, whose race \"is unrelated\nto his fitness as a juror.\" Batson, 476 U.S. at 87 (quotation\nomitted). As the Court noted in Batson,\"[s]election\nprocedures that purposefully exclude black persons from\njuries undermine public confidence in the fairness of our\nsystem of justice.\" Id.\n\nThe Court granted certiorari in Batson so that it could\nreexamine the evidentiary burden its opinion in Swain v.\nAlabama, 380 U.S. 202 (1965), had placed on a criminal\ndefendant who alleged that the State improperly used its\nperemptory challenges to exclude jurors based on race. In\nSwain, the Court had held that a defendant could satisfy a\nprima facie case of purposeful discrimination by showing\nthat a prosecutor, \"in case after case, whatever the\ncircumstances, whatever the crime and whoever the\ndefendant or the victim may be, is responsible for the\nremoval of Negroes who have been selected as qualified\njurors by the jury commissioners and who have survived\nchallenges for cause, with the result that no Negroes ever\nserve on petit juries.\" Id. at 223. The Batson Court noted\nthat many lower courts interpreted Swain to hold \"that\nproof of repeated striking of blacks over a number of cases\nwas necessary to establish a violation of the Equal\nProtection Clause.\" Batson, 476 U.S. at 92. The Court in\nBatson recognized that this standard had \"placed on\ndefendants a crippling burden of proof \" that resulted in\n\"prosecutors' peremptory challenges [becoming] largely\nimmune from constitutional scrutiny.\" Id. at 92-93 (footnote\nomitted). Accordingly, it rejected the Swain evidentiary\nformulation.\n\nIn the jurisprudence that has evolved following Batson,\nthe inquiry has been characterized as a three-step one.\n\n                               10\n\fBatson stated that \"a defendant may establish a prima facie\ncase of purposeful discrimination in selection of the petit\njury solely on evidence concerning the prosecutor's exercise\nof peremptory challenges at the defendant's trial.\" Id. at 96.\nOnce the defendant makes a prima facie showing of racial\ndiscrimination (step one), the prosecution must articulate a\nrace-neutral explanation for its use of peremptory\nchallenges (step two). If it does so, the trial court must\ndetermine whether the defendant has established\npurposeful discrimination (step three). See id. at 96-98;\nSimmons v. Beyer, 44 F.3d 1160, 1167 (3d Cir. 1995);\nDeputy v. Taylor, 19 F.3d 1485, 1492 (3d Cir. 1994). The\nultimate burden of persuasion regarding racial motivation\nrests with, and does not shift from, the defendant. See\nPurkett v. Elem, 514 U.S. 765, 768 (1995).\n\n3. Riley's Batson Challenge in State Court\n\nIn this case, the hearing judge determined, and the State\ndoes not contest, that Riley made out a prima facie case of\ndiscrimination in jury selection, as the State had used its\nperemptory challenges to strike all three prospective black\njurors from the venire, \"result[ing] in an all-white jury\nsitting on a first degree murder trial involving a black\ndefendant and a white victim.\" Riley III, 1988 WL 130430,\nat *2. The hearing judge then conducted an evidentiary\nhearing. The State proceeded to step two of the Batson\ninquiry by offering race-neutral justifications for its use of\nthe peremptory challenges to strike Ray Nichols, Lois\nBeecher, and Charles McGuire, each of whom was black.\n\nLiguori, the lead prosecutor at trial and the State's\nprincipal witness at the post-conviction relief hearing,\ntestified that the State \"wanted to have minority\nrepresentation on the jury panel.\" App. at 792-793. He\nstated that he wanted jurors who would be attentive and\nwho would vote for a death sentence. He testified that he\nwanted \"to make sure we were not only going to get a\nconviction of murder in the first degree, but also the death\npenalty.\" App. at 797.\n\nWith respect to Nichols, Liguori remembered clearly that\n\"Mr. Nichols was an individual who, and unfortunately the\nrecord doesn't reflect this, who was not, in my particular\n\n                                11\n\fmind, not certain with regard to being able to return a\nverdict for death.\" App. at 797-798 (emphasis added). As\nLiguori explained, \"there was a pause and a significant\npause in [Nichols'] answering [the court's] inquiry [at voir\ndire] and that to me was enough to suggest that he might\nnot be able to return a death penalty and I didn't want\nanyone that wasn't going to give me a death penalty.\" App.\nat 798-799.\n\nWith regard to Beecher, Liguori testified that he struck\nher because of her response to the court that she did not\nthink she could impose the death penalty. App. at 804.\n\nAs for McGuire, Liguori explained that he used the\nperemptory challenge because he presumed McGuire would\nbe unable to \"give his full time and attention\" to the trial.\nApp. at 801. According to Liguori,\n\n       Mr. McGuire was an individual who had requested--\n       remember, this was going to be around Christmas also.\n\n       Mr. McGuire had previously requested to be excused\n       from jury service. When Mr. McGuire came up, the first\n       thing I wanted to make clear--as I said earlier, I\n       wanted someone that was going to be attentive and you\n       can read all the books you want with regard to\n       selecting prospective jurors and it is always make sure\n       you have attentive jurors, people not concerned about\n       getting home early to take care of their kids, or\n       vacation.\n\n       Mr. McGuire himself had requested the Court to\n       excuse him. The Court didn't. When he went through\n       his inquiry, we asked the judge to excuse him for\n       cause. The judge said no. It then left us with no\n       alternative but to think he would not give his full time\n       and attention and therefore we struck Mr. McGuire.\n\nApp. at 801.\n\nOn cross-examination of Liguori, Riley's attorney\nintroduced Liguori's handwritten notes from voir dire.\nWritten next to McGuire's name was the word \"Out.\" App.\nat 832. Among the names on the same page was that of\nCharles Reed, a white man who actually served on Riley's\njury. Next to Reed's name on the sheet was written,\"works\n\n                               12\n\fLowe's, wants off.\" App. at 823. Despite repeated efforts by\nRiley's counsel to refresh Liguori's recollection, Liguori\ntestified that he had no recollection of Reed whatsoever.\nLiguori agreed, however, that the notation next to Reed's\nname indicated that Reed had requested to be excused from\nservice on the jury. Liguori offered no explanation for his\ndecision not to strike Reed.\n\nRiley then presented McGuire as a witness at the state\npost-conviction hearing. McGuire testified that, in contrast\nto Liguori's testimony, he had never asked to be excused\nfrom the jury. McGuire specifically denied ever indicating to\neither the prosecutors or the court that he was unwilling to\nserve on the jury or that he wanted to be excused. Instead,\nhe testified that his supervisor had told him that he was\ngoing to make a \"formal request\" that McGuire be excused\nand that his supervisor did send a letter to the trial judge\nrequesting he be relieved from jury duty. App. at 860.\nAccording to McGuire, in response to his supervisor's letter,\nhe was questioned by the trial judge whom he advised of\nhis willingness to serve on the jury. App. at 849-850.\n\nRiley also presented evidence that in addition to the\nprosecutor's striking of the three prospective black jurors in\nhis trial, the Kent County Prosecutor's office used its\nperemptory challenges to remove every prospective black\njuror in the three other first degree murder trials that\noccurred within a year of his trial.5 Counsel for the State\nobjected to the admission of this evidence, arguing that\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5. The three other trials were:\n\n       a. Andre Deputy--state struck the lone prospective black juror, a\n       second juror designated as \"Indian,\" and six prospective white\n       jurors;\n\n       b. Judith McBride--state struck all three prospective black jurors,\n       five whites, plus two other jurors whose race has not been\n       identified; and\n\n       c. Daniel Pregent--state struck the lone prospective black juror\n       and four whites.\n\nAlthough the race of two of the jurors who were ultimately impaneled\nhas not been identified, the State does not contest Riley's assertion that\nevery impaneled juror was white.\n\n                                  13\n\fevidence of general prosecutorial practices was relevant\nonly to Riley's prima facie case. The hearing judge rejected\nthis argument and admitted the evidence, explaining that it\nwas being offered to show that \"the exercise of the\nperemptory challenges in this particular case followed some\nkind of pattern that exists in the prosecutorial actions in\nfirst degree murder cases involving minority defendants and\nit is not segregable or severable from past history.\" App. at\n872.\n\nCounsel for the State then requested and received an\nadditional four weeks in which to \"attempt to prepare the\nsame sort of information which . . . would be contrary to\nthe representations made by [Riley's counsel's]\ninformation.\" App. at 874. He informed the court that he\nhad not yet been able to obtain materials from other cases,\nbut he assured the court that \"they do exist.\" App. at 874.\nYet approximately one month after the hearing, the State\nadvised the hearing judge by a letter dated January 27,\n1989 from Jeffrey M. Taschner, Deputy Attorney General,\nthat stated in full: \"Please be advised that the State will not\nsupplement the record of the post conviction relief hearing\nheld in the above-captioned matter on December 30, 1988.\"\nLetter to this Court from Thomas J. Allingham II (Dec. 16,\n1999), Ex. B (on file in the Clerk's office).\n\nThe hearing judge ultimately accepted the State's race-\nneutral explanations and rejected Riley's Batson claim,\nwithout mentioning any of the evidence introduced by Riley\nat the hearing. See Riley IV, App. at 887-891. The Delaware\nSupreme Court affirmed, likewise without discussion of\nRiley's evidence. See Riley V, 585 A.2d at 725.\n\n4. Standard of Review\n\nA Batson claim presents mixed questions of law and fact.\nSee Jones v. Ryan, 987 F.2d 960, 965 (3d Cir. 1993). We\nexercise plenary review over questions of law and we look to\n28 U.S.C. S 2254 for our standard of review of findings of\nfact. See id. Riley's federal habeas petition was filed before\nthe enactment of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death\nPenalty Act (\"AEDPA\") of 1996, 110 Stat. 1214, and\ntherefore AEDPA does not govern our standard of review.\nSee Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U.S. 320 (1997). Instead, under\n\n                               14\n\fthe federal habeas statute in effect at the time Riley filed\nhis petition, we must presume correct the state court's\nfindings of fact unless one of the statutory exceptions\napplies. See 28 U.S.C. S 2254(d) (1988).\n\nThe District Court rejected Riley's Batson claim on the\nmerits by relying on this presumption of correctness. See\nRiley VIII, 1998 WL 172856, at *17. Riley contends that the\npresumption of correctness is not warranted because the\nhearing judge's factual findings are \"not fairly supported by\nthe record,\" 28 U.S.C. S 2254(d)(8) (1988), and because he\n\"did not receive a full, fair, and adequate hearing in the\nState court proceeding,\" 28 U.S.C. S 2254(d)(6) (1988).\nBecause we resolve Riley's appeal pursuant to S 2254(d)(8),\nwe need not consider Riley's latter argument.\n\nThe limited nature of review underlying the requirement\nthat a federal court must defer to the state court findings\nof fact if they are \"fairly supported by the record\" reflects\nimportant policy considerations. See, e.g., Miller v. Fenton,\n474 U.S. 104, 114 (1985) (presumption of correctness\nrecognizes that \"as a matter of the sound administration of\njustice, one judicial actor is better positioned than another\nto decide the issue\"). In Rushen v. Spain, 464 U.S. 114, 122\nn.6 (1983), the Court stated that \"28 U.S.C.S 2254(d)\nrequires that a federal habeas court more than simply\ndisagree with the state court before rejecting its factual\ndeterminations.\" The Court further noted that the statutory\ntest set forth in S 2254(d)(8) \"is satisfied by the existence of\nprobative evidence underlying the [state court's]\nconclusion.\" Id.\n\nIn the instant case, it appears that the hearing judge's\nfactual findings were based primarily on determinations\nregarding the credibility of Liguori at the post-conviction\nhearing. Such findings are generally owed \"even greater\ndeference\" because \"only the trial judge can be aware of the\nvariations in demeanor and tone of voice that bear so\nheavily on the listener's understanding of and belief in what\nis said.\" Anderson v. City of Bessemer City , 470 U.S. 564,\n575 (1985); see also Batson, 476 U.S. at 98 n.21 (\"Since\nthe trial judge's findings in [this] context .. . largely will\nturn on evaluation of credibility, a reviewing court\nordinarily should give those findings great deference.\").\n\n                               15\n\fStill, this does not signify that \"federal review. . . is a\nnullity.\" Caldwell v. Maloney, 159 F.3d 639, 651 (1st Cir.\n1998) (hereafter \"Maloney\"). In Purkett, the Supreme Court\nstated that \"implausible or fantastic justifications may (and\nprobably will) be found to be pretexts for purposeful\ndiscrimination.\" 514 U.S. at 768. In addition, the Supreme\nCourt has suggested, albeit in a non-habeas context, that\nreviewing courts need not accept a trial judge's findings\nbased on credibility determinations if the witness has not\ntold a \"coherent and facially plausible story\" or if his story\nis \"contradicted by extrinsic evidence.\" Anderson, 470 U.S.\nat 575. Thus, we must determine whether there is fair\nsupport to conclude that the State put forth \"a coherent\nand facially plausible\" explanation of its strikes of the\nprospective black jurors or whether the State's explanations\nare \"implausible.\" Ultimately, when we review the record at\nstep three of the Batson inquiry, we must decide whether\nthe state courts' acceptance of the State's explanation has\nbeen made after consideration of all the evidence on the\nrecord.\n\n5. State's Race-Neutral Explanations\n\nAt the post-conviction hearing, the State proceeded to\nstep two of the Batson inquiry by offering race-neutral\nreasons for striking the black jurors. It did so primarily\nthrough Liguori's testimony. Riley does not argue that the\nState failed to meet its step two burden. His contention is\nthat the state courts failed to engage in the step three\ninquiry, which requires evaluation of the proffered race-\nneutral reasons in light of all the other evidence in the\nrecord.\n\nLiguori contended he struck Nichols because he doubted\nwhether Nichols would be willing to return a death\nsentence. He based this doubt on his clear recollection of \"a\nsignificant pause\" by Nichols when asked about the death\npenalty. App. at 798. Yet, as Liguori himself admitted in his\ntestimony, the record reflects no such pause and no such\nuncertainty on Nichols' part.\n\nAt voir dire, Nichols had answered the two questions\nposed by the court regarding the jurors' willingness to\nsentence a defendant to death in a manner seemingly\nfavorable to the prosecution:\n\n                               16\n\f       Q: Do you have any conscientious scruples against\n       finding a verdict of guilty where the punishment might\n       be death or against imposing the death penalty even if\n       the evidence should so warrant?\n\n       A: No.\n\n       Q: Regardless of any personal beliefs or feelings that\n       you may have, if the evidence justified it, would you be\n       able to find a person guilty of murder in the first\n       degree and would you be able to impose the death\n       penalty.\n\n       A: I think so.\n\nApp. at 226-227. A prospective white juror, Angelo LePore,\nprovided the exact same answers to the court's questions,\nyet he was not stricken and actually served on Riley's jury.\nApp. at 231-232. The record provides no basis for\ndistinguishing Nichols from LePore.\n\nMoreover, despite Nichols' alleged pause, the prosecutors\ndid not ask the trial court to remove Nichols for cause or to\ninquire further into his willingness to award the death\npenalty, even though the trial judge excused six\nvenirepersons for cause because they said they couldn't, or\nbelieved they couldn't, impose the death penalty, App. at\n234-237, 245-246, 265-271, and two more who responded\nequivocally, App. at 273-276, 282-286. This raises the\nquestion why, if Nichols actually did pause \"a significant\npause,\" the State did not seek to have him removed for\ncause like the others. The record does not show (and the\nState does not claim) that the prosecutors ever expressed to\nthe trial court the concern that Nichols would be unwilling\nto impose the death penalty, that the court independently\nexpressed concern, or that any of the contemporaneous\nnotes kept by the prosecutors as to some of the jurors\nreflected either the existence of a pause or the concern\nabout which Liguori testified six years later. Thus, Liguori's\nexplanation is entirely unsupported by the record. See\nJohnson v. Vasquez, 3 F.3d 1327, 1331 (9th Cir. 1993)\n(stating that courts are not bound to accept race-neutral\nreasons that are either unsupported by the record or\nrefuted by it).\n\n                               17\n\fSimilarly, the record offers little basis for distinguishing\nMcGuire, a prospective black juror who was struck, from\nReed, a white juror who served without challenge by the\nState. Liguori testified that he struck McGuire because\nMcGuire asked to be excused from jury service and he\nfeared that McGuire would be an inattentive juror. 6 Liguori,\nwho claimed to remember Nichols' pause six years later\nwithout benefit of any assistance, testified that he had no\nrecollection at all regarding Reed. Liguori's notes from voir\ndire, however, state that Reed \"works Lowe's, wants off,\"\nApp. at 823, which strongly suggests that Reed too was\nlikely to be an inattentive juror. Yet at no point during voir\ndire did the prosecution ever express any concern over\nReed's place on the jury. Based on this record evidence,\nthere is no basis for distinguishing between McGuire's\ndesire to be excused and Reed's desire to be excused.\n\nAlthough the State strains to distinguish the two jurors\nby arguing that McGuire's desire to be excused from jury\nservice was stronger than Reed's desire because McGuire's\nemployer had intervened to seek his release, its effort is not\npersuasive. First, Liguori did not testify before the hearing\njudge that this was the basis for the strike; in fact, Liguori\ntestified to the opposite -- that McGuire himself had asked\nto be excused from jury service. Second, even if McGuire\nwould have been inattentive for work-related reasons, the\nprosecution's notes from voir dire connecting Reed's\nemployment to his \"wants off \" suggest that Reed's desire to\nbe excused from jury service may have been work-related\nas well. Third, there is no evidence in the record to suggest\nthat a juror will be more inattentive because s/he wants to\nbe off the jury for work-related reasons rather than for\nother reasons, which is the basis for the State's position\nthat McGuire's desire to be excused was stronger than\nReed's desire to \"want[ ] off,\" documented in Liguori's\ncontemporaneous notes.\n\nWith regard to both Nichols and McGuire, the state\ncourts failed to mention in their opinions the weaknesses in\nthe State's explanations, and therefore failed to complete\nthe required step three Batson inquiry.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6. In fact, McGuire testified at the post-conviction hearing that he never\nasked to be excused from the jury.\n\n                               18\n\f6. Statistical Evidence\n\nIn addition to Riley's challenge to the State's explanations\nat the post-conviction hearing for striking Nichols and\nMcGuire by pointing to inconsistencies in the record, Riley\nintroduced evidence that the prosecution used its\nperemptory challenges to strike every prospective black\njuror in the three other first degree murder trials occurring\nin Kent County within one year of Riley's trial. It did so\nboth for the other black murder defendant and the two\nwhite murder defendants.7 In these four trials (including\nRiley's), the prosecution struck all 8 prospective black\njurors who were called, i.e., 100%. By contrast, the\nprosecution used its peremptory challenges to strike only\n23 of the 71 prospective white jurors, or 32%. After the\nprosecution used its peremptory challenges to strike 23\nwhites, 8 blacks, 1 Indian, and 2 jurors of unidentified\nrace, the remaining racial makeup of the actual jurors in\nthe four trials was 48 white jurors. See Letter to this Court\nfrom Thomas J. Allingham II (Dec. 16, 1999), Ex. A (on file\nin the Clerk's office).\n\nAn amateur with a pocket calculator can calculate the\nnumber of blacks that would have served had the State\nused its strikes in a racially proportionate manner. In the\nfour capital cases there was a total of 82 potential jurors on\nthe venires who were not removed for cause, of whom eight,\nor 9.76%, were black. If the prosecution had used its\nperemptory challenges in a manner proportional to the\npercentage of blacks in the overall venire, then only 3 of the\n34 jurors peremptorily struck (8.82%) would have been\nblack and 5 of the 48 actual jurors (10.42%) would have\nbeen black. Instead, none of the 48 jurors were black.\n\nAdmittedly, there was no statistical analysis of these\nfigures presented by either side in the post-conviction\nproceeding. But is it really necessary to have a\nsophisticated analysis by a statistician to conclude that\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n7. The exclusion by the Kent County prosecutor of all black jurors in the\ntrials of the two white defendants is relevant to establishing a pattern\nof\nrace-based use of peremptories. See Powers v. Ohio, 499 U.S. 400 (1991)\n(excluding jurors on the basis of race is unconstitutional regardless of\nthe race of the defendant).\n\n                               19\n\fthere is little chance of randomly selecting four consecutive\nall white juries? The State never argued before the hearing\njudge and does not argue before this court that the\nselection of four consecutive all white juries could have\nbeen due to pure chance. Nor does it suggest that Riley's\nevidence does not accurately represent Kent County\nprosecutorial practices. Moreover, not once has the State\noffered an explanation for its use of peremptory challenges\nto strike all prospective black jurors in the four consecutive\ncapital cases. The State has never sought to explain the\ndata by variables other than race. Nor has it sought to\nrebut Riley's evidence.\n\nThe failure of the State to produce evidence from other\ntrials is significant because it was the State, not Riley, that\nwould have had access to such evidence, it was the State\nthat asserted that such evidence was available and\nforthcoming, and it was the State, not Riley, that failed to\nprovide it. Yet again, neither the hearing judge in his\nopinion nor the Delaware Supreme Court discussed Riley's\nevidence that showed the systematic exclusion of blacks\nfrom the petit juries in Delaware. In fact, having stated that\nthis evidence was introduced to demonstrate that\"the\nexercise of the peremptory challenges in this particular case\nfollowed some kind of pattern that exists in the\nprosecutorial actions in first degree murder cases involving\nminority defendants,\" App. at 872, the hearing judge\ndiscussed neither the statistics nor the State's failure to\nexplain them. Thus, once again by overlooking and ignoring\na significant segment of Riley's evidence, the hearing\njudge's opinion does not satisfy the crucial third step of the\nBatson analysis.\n\n7. Analysis\n\nAt the conclusion of the evidentiary post-conviction\nhearing, the hearing judge issued a written opinion in\nwhich he addressed the prosecutors' reasons for striking\nthe three black jurors, as required by step three of the\nBatson inquiry. He stated:\n\n       The State in this case provided race-neutral\n       explanations for the peremptory challenges on all three\n       black jurors. After examining the demeanor and\n\n                               20\n\f       credibility of the witnesses and prosecutors at the\n       evidentiary hearing, I believe the State exercised its\n       peremptory challenges entirely within the strictures of\n       the Fourteenth Amendment. No factual basis exists for\n       a successful claim of an equal protection violation. The\n       State successfully rebutted any prima facie showing of\n       discrimination in jury selection based upon race.\n\nRiley IV, App. at 890-891. This determination that the\nprosecutors did not intend to discriminate on the basis of\nrace in exercising their peremptory strikes against the three\nchallenged jurors is a factual finding entitled to a\npresumption of correctness unless one of the exceptions in\nS 2254(d) (1988) applies. See Hernandez v. New York, 500\nU.S. 352, 365-66 (1991).\n\nThe inquiry required by Batson must be focused on the\ndistinctions actually offered by the State in the state court,\nnot on all possible distinctions we can hypothesize. See\nMahaffey v. Page, 162 F.3d 481, 483 n.1 (7th Cir. 1998)\n(concerning itself with actual reasons, not apparent ones,\nfor state's use of peremptory challenges); Turner v.\nMarshall, 121 F.3d 1248, 1253 (9th Cir. 1997) (\"The\narguments that the State has made since the evidentiary\nhearing do not form part of the prosecutor's explanation.\").\nApparent or potential reasons do not shed any light on the\nprosecutor's intent or state of mind when making the\nperemptory challenge. As to both Nichols and McGuire, the\nhearing judge merely repeated Liguori's articulated\nexplanations without any reference to, or analysis of, Riley's\nevidence of pretext and seems to have accepted the State's\njustifications at face value.\n\nLiguori simply testified that he struck McGuire because\nhe would be inattentive at trial, and for no other reason, a\njustification that would apply equally to Reed. The State\ngave no explanation as to Reed other than Liguori's plain\nlack of memory. Cf. Harrison v. Ryan, 909 F.2d 84, 87 (3d\nCir. 1990) (concluding that prosecutor's failure to recall his\nreason for striking prospective juror did not constitute a\nrace-neutral explanation). And the credibility of Liguori's\nlack of memory is somewhat in doubt considering that he\nclaimed to remember Nichols' \"significant pause.\" The only\ndistinction between the two jurors that is apparent from the\n\n                               21\n\frecord is that McGuire, who was struck, is black; Reed,\nwho was retained, is white.\n\nA comparison between a stricken black juror and a\nsitting white juror is relevant to determining whether the\nprosecution's asserted justification for striking the black\njuror is pretextual. See McClain v. Prunty, 217 F.3d 1209,\n1220 (9th Cir. 2000) (\"A prosecutor's motives may be\nrevealed as pretextual where a given explanation is equally\napplicable to a juror of a different race who was not\nstricken by the exercise of a peremptory challenge.\");\nJordan v. Lefevre, 206 F.3d 196, 201 (2d Cir. 2000)\n(\"Support for the notion that there was purposeful\ndiscrimination in the peremptory challenge may lie in the\nsimilarity between the characteristics of jurors struck and\njurors accepted. Where the principal difference between\nthem is race, the credibility of the prosecutor's explanation\nis much weakened.\"); Maloney, 159 F.3d at 653 (\"[A]s a\ngeneral matter, comparisons between challenged jurors and\nsimilarly situated, unchallenged jurors of a different race or\ngender can be probative of whether a peremptory challenge\nis racially motivated.\"); Coulter v. Gilmore , 155 F.3d 912,\n921 (7th Cir. 1998) (\"A facially neutral reason for striking a\njuror may show discrimination if that reason is invoked\nonly to eliminate African-American prospective jurors and\nnot others who also have that characteristic.\"); Turner, 121\nF.3d at 1251-52 (\"A comparative analysis of jurors struck\nand those remaining is a well-established tool for exploring\nthe possibility that facially race-neutral reasons are a\npretext for discrimination.\").\n\nThe comparison between McGuire and Reed is strongly\nsuggestive of the State's race-based use of its peremptory\nchallenges. See, e.g., McClain, 217 F.3d at 1224 (concluding\nthat Batson was violated where two of six proffered race-\nneutral explanations were \"pretextual based upon\ncomparisons of voir dire responses by non-black jurors who\nwere seated without objection by the prosecutor,\" and other\nfour were contrary to the facts); Turner, 121 F.3d at 1253-\n54 (holding that the district court clearly erred in finding\nthat prosecutor did not discriminate in jury selection where\nsole justification offered for striking a black juror applied\nequally to non-stricken white juror); Devose v. Norris, 53\n\n                               22\n\fF.3d 201, 205 (8th Cir. 1995) (concluding that Batson was\nviolated where the only justification prosecutor offered for\nstriking three out of four prospective black jurors with prior\njury experience was that they might be \"burned out\" by\nprior service and where at least five white jurors were not\nstricken although they had previously served on juries);\nJones v. Ryan, 987 F.2d 960 (3d Cir. 1993) (rejecting the\nprosecutor's proffered race-neutral explanation for striking\nblack jurors where the prosecutor did not apply the same\nrationale to similarly-situated white jurors); Garrett v.\nMorris, 815 F.2d 509, 514 (8th Cir. 1987) (\"The prosecutor's\nrationale [for striking three black jurors]-- the blacks'\npurported lack of education, background, and knowledge --\nseems clearly pretextual in light of his decision not to strike\nwhite jurors who differed in no significant way\").\n\nNichols' answers as to his willingness to return a death\nsentence were the same as LePore's, and were it not for\nLiguori's testimony as to the suspect \"significant pause,\"\nthere would be no significant difference between them as\nwell, except, of course, that Nichols, who was struck, is\nblack and LePore, who was retained, is white.\n\nFurthermore, each piece of evidence should not be\nreviewed in isolation. It is clear that \"[a]n explanation for a\nparticular challenge need not necessarily be pigeon-holed\nas wholly acceptable or wholly unacceptable. The relative\nplausibility or implausibility of each explanation for a\nparticular challenge . . . may strengthen or weaken the\nassessment of the prosecution's explanation as to other\nchallenges.\" United States v. Alvarado, 923 F.2d 253, 256\n(2d Cir. 1991). In short, \"[a] reviewing court's level of\nsuspicion may . . . be raised by a series of very weak\nexplanations for a prosecutor's peremptory challenges. The\nwhole may be greater than the sum of its parts.\" Maloney,\n159 F.3d at 651.\n\nIt is in this connection that we must turn to the\nstatistical evidence presented by Riley of the pattern of the\nState's use of its peremptories. It may be that such\nevidence, standing alone, would not be sufficient to show\nintentional discrimination in selection of juries by the Kent\nCounty Prosecutor's office in the year in question. It is,\nhowever, particularly troublesome because the State failed\n\n                                23\n\fto provide the rebuttal data as to Riley's evidence when\ngiven the opportunity which it requested. In that\ncircumstance, an inference adverse to the State may fairly\nbe drawn. As has been recognized, \"[w]here relevant\ninformation . . . is in the possession of one party and not\nprovided, then an adverse inference may be drawn that\nsuch information would be harmful to the party who fails to\nprovide it.\" McMahan & Co. v. Po Folks, Inc. , 206 F.3d 627,\n632 (6th Cir. 2000) (quotation omitted). Indeed, the\nSupreme Court has stated, \"The production of weak\nevidence when strong is available can lead only to the\nconclusion that the strong would have been adverse.\"\nInterstate Circuit, Inc. v. United States, 306 U.S. 208, 226\n(1939). Accordingly, the State must accept the negative\ninference that flows from its failure to provide the rebuttal\ndata, and that inescapable inference is that the Kent\nCounty Prosecutor's office did not want blacks on its juries\nin first degree murder cases.\n\nThe Supreme Court in Batson recognized the significance\nof evidence of systematic exclusion of blacks in jury\nselection. It stated, \"Proof of systematic exclusion from the\nvenire raises an inference of purposeful discrimination\nbecause the `result bespeaks discrimination.' \" Batson, 476\nU.S. at 94-95 (quoting Hernandez v. Texas, 347 U.S. 475,\n482 (1954)). It likewise recognized the relevance of\nsystematic exclusion of blacks from the petit jury. See id. at\n96-97; see also McClain, 217 F.3d at 1224 (finding that \"the\nfact that all blacks in the venire pool were struck raises an\ninference of discrimination\" where 3 of 39 people in venire\npool were black). On the record before us, it is difficult to\navoid drawing the inference that the Kent County\nProsecutor followed a pattern of using peremptory\nchallenges in a racially discriminatory manner. 8\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n8. The pattern is relevant even if Riley has not undertaken to prove a\nBatson violation in the other three trials. Defendants Daniel Pregent and\nJudith McBride were both tried before Batson was decided, and thus\nwere not likely to have raised a Batson objection, particularly since\nneither was black and the Supreme Court did not extend the Batson\nholding to apply regardless of whether the defendant and excluded juror\nwere of the same race until its opinion in Powers v. Ohio, 499 U.S. 400\n(1991). The third capital defendant, Deputy, did not challenge the\n\n                               24\n\fDespite the State's efforts to explain away the various\nparts of the evidentiary picture Riley has presented, the\nrecord as a whole squarely contradicts its position. The\nquestionable nature of Liguori's explanations for the strikes\nof McGuire and Nichols must be evaluated not only in light\nof the uncontested evidence of the use of peremptory\nstrikes in Kent County but also in light of the nature of the\nState's pre-Batson defense on direct appeal.\n\nWhen Riley's direct appeal came before the Delaware\nSupreme Court in 1984, the State justified the use of race\nin selecting jurors in criminal trials. On that occasion,\nwhich was the State's first opportunity to defend the use of\nits peremptory challenges in Riley's trial, the State did not\noffer a single race-neutral explanation, not even as an\nalternate argument; instead, it claimed that it was\npermissible -- even socially desirable -- to exclude jurors\nbased on what it called \"group association,\" App. at 896,\nwhich a Justice of the Delaware Supreme Court was\nreported to have recognized as a \"euphemism for race,\"\nApp. at 1321. In its brief to the Delaware Supreme Court,\nthe State interpreted Swain v. Alabama, 380 U.S. 202\n(1965), as \"recogniz[ing] how peremptory challenges, even\nthose exercised on the basis of group association, foster the\nconstitutional goal of an impartial jury.\" App. at 896. The\nState added in a footnote that it \"emphatically denies that\nthe prosecutor [in Riley's case] exercised any of his\nchallenges solely on the assumption that the juror's race, in\nthe context of the facts of this case, indicated a verdict\nposition adverse to the prosecution. Rather, the State will\nargue that even if such was the case, no constitutional\ncommand would have been contravened.\" App. at 896\n(emphasis added).\n_________________________________________________________________\n\ncomposition of the jury in the state courts and thus the racial makeup\nof the venire was not available when this court decided the appeal. See\nDeputy, 19 F.3d at 1491-93. Moreover, the Supreme Court in Batson\nmade clear that \"a defendant may make a prima facie showing of\npurposeful racial discrimination in selection of the venire by relying\nsolely on the facts concerning its selection in his case.\" Batson, 486\nU.S.\nat 95 (emphasis in original).\n\n                               25\n\fBefore this court, the State contends that Swain was\n\"good law\" at the time, so reliance on that case cannot be\nviewed as a concession that some of its peremptory\nchallenges may not have been race-neutral. Tr. of Oral\nArgument at 31. Yet, significant for purposes here is that in\nresponse to Riley's challenge to its use of peremptories, the\nState never denied on direct appeal that race played a role\nin its use of peremptory challenges; it only claimed that it\ndid not exercise them solely based on race. Its justification\nfor that practice certainly suggests that race was at least a\npartial basis for its use of peremptory challenges. And that\nsuggestion further supports the conclusion we are led to by\nour earlier analysis of the record that the State's proffered\nrace-neutral explanations are pretextual.\n\nThe requirement that we defer to the State's findings of\nfact does not apply when those findings are not supported\nby probative evidence. The State's position is that under\nS 2254(d) \"all that is required\" is that the state court make\nfindings of fact, and flatly states that because the hearing\njudge did so, we must defer. Tr. of Oral Argument at 41.\nAlthough the State concedes that we must concern\nourselves under Rushen, 464 U.S. at 121 n.6, with whether\nthere is probative evidence in the record to support the\nstate court's findings, it then seems to argue that since the\nfindings are primarily based on credibility determinations,\nthe mere fact that Liguori testified is sufficiently probative\nto support these determinations.\n\nCertainly it is not required that a federal court should\ndefer to a state court's findings of fact on habeas review as\nlong as the state court accepted the prosecutor's race-\nneutral explanation, no matter how incredible,\ncontradicted, and implausible it may be. On the contrary,\nseveral courts of appeals have acknowledged that the\ntraditional level of deference should not govern appellate\nreview when a prosecutor's explanations are obviously not\ncredible. See McClain, 217 F.3d at 1221 (\" `[I]mplausible or\nfantastic justifications may (and probably will) be found to\nbe pretexts for purposeful discrimination.' \") (quoting\nPurkett, 514 U.S. at 768); United States v. Griffin, 194 F.3d\n808, 826 (7th Cir. 1999) (noting that a basis for reversal of\nstate court exists where \"the reason given [by the\n\n                               26\n\fprosecutor] is completely outlandish or there is other\nevidence which demonstrated its falsity\"); Maloney, 159\nF.3d at 651 (stating that serious questions of pretext arise\nwhen the facts in the record are \"objectively contrary to\" the\nprosecutor's explanations).\n\nIn light of the lack of probative evidence in the record to\nsupport the findings that the State exercised its peremptory\nchallenges at Riley's trial in a race-neutral manner, we\ndecline to give these findings deference. Such deference is\nordinarily based, at least in part, on the original trial\ncourt's ability to make contemporaneous assessments. See\nHernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. at 365. Recently, the\nCourt of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit deferred to the state\ncourt's findings on a Batson claim precisely because the\ncourt had that opportunity. It explained,\n\n       Indeed, it would be an impermissible exercise in\n       hindsight for us now to upset the trial court's\n       credibility determination in evaluating the prosecutor's\n       explanation. And as the district court correctly\n       observed, the `retrospective parsing of the `curricula\n       vitae' of the jurors' is no substitute for the observations\n       of the trial judge, who witnessed first-hand the\n       process. We simply cannot overlook the fact that the\n       trial court had conducted an extensive voir dire of the\n       jury pool, which was documented in several hundred\n       pages of trial transcripts, and was able to observe the\n       demeanor and hear the responses of the prospective\n       jurors in court. This insight enabled the trial court to\n       compare the prosecutor's explanation with what\n       occurred at the bench and in open court. Most\n       significantly, the trial court was able to observe the\n       prosecutor's demeanor and conduct and evaluate the\n       credibility of his explanation.\n\nEvans v. Smith, 220 F.3d 306, 316 (4th Cir. 2000)\n(emphases added).\n\nIt may be that because the findings at issue here were\nmade by the hearing judge six years after the State had\nexercised its peremptory challenges before the trial judge\nand the hearing judge neither witnessed the challenges\nfirst-hand nor examined the witnesses at the time the\n\n                                27\n\fchallenges were exercised, he did not note or comment on\nsome of the troublesome inconsistencies in the State's race-\nneutral explanations.\n\nDeference in a Batson case must be viewed in the context\nof the requirement that the state courts engage in the\nthree-step Batson inquiry. As the Court of Appeals for the\nFourth Circuit described step three: \"If [the State's] burden\n[under step two] is met, the court then addresses and\nevaluates all evidence introduced by each side (including all\nevidence introduced in the first and second steps) that\ntends to show that race was or was not the real reason and\ndetermines whether the defendant has met his burden of\npersuasion.\" McMillon, 14 F.3d 948, 953 n.4 (4th Cir.\n1994); see also Jordan, 206 F.3d at 200 (stating that step\nthree of Batson inquiry requires examination of \"all the\nfacts and circumstances\") (quotation omitted).\n\nHere, the state courts failed to examine all of the\nevidence to determine whether the State's proffered race-\nneutral explanations were pretextual. Not only is there no\nindication on the record that the hearing judge engaged in\nthe required analysis, but there is no indication that the\nDelaware Supreme Court did so, by making findings which\nalso would have been entitled to deference. See Sumner v.\nMata, 449 U.S. 539, 547 (1981). The omission of the crucial\nstep of evaluating the State's proffered explanations in light\nof all the evidence can be gleaned by the absence of the\nword \"pretext\" in both the opinion of the hearing judge and\nin the opinion of the Delaware Supreme Court. Nor is there\nany language in either opinion that suggests, whatever the\nwords used, that either court recognized the nature of the\nanalysis it was required to undertake. In Jones v. Ryan, we\nnoted that the state court decision rejecting a Batson claim\ncontained no factual findings relating to the different\nprongs of the Batson analysis, to which we could accord a\npresumption of correctness. See 987 F.2d at 965-66. The\nsituation before us is similar.\n\nThe State argues that our concern with the hearing\njudge's failure to discuss critical evidence in his decision is\nmerely a complaint about the manner in which he wrote his\nopinion. It states in its supplemental brief that\"[i]t may\nwell have been better for the state judge to have further\n\n                               28\n\fexplained his decision . . . [b]ut the federal habeas statutes\ndo not set standards for the writing of opinions by state\njudges.\" Supp. Memo. of Appellees at 7.\n\nBut the concern is not how the decision was written, a\ntrifling matter. It is the failure of the state courts to\ncomplete the required Batson analysis by comparing the\nstricken black jurors with the sitting white jurors,\nacknowledging the statistical evidence of striking all black\njurors in capital murder cases in Kent County within a year\nof Riley's trial, and recognizing the State's position in this\nvery case that use of peremptories for racial reasons was\nboth constitutional and socially beneficial.\n\nComparable to the case before us is the decision in\nCoulter v. Gilmore, 155 F.3d 912 (7th Cir. 1998). There the\ncourt acknowledged that deference is owed to the state\ncourt findings under S 2254(d), but rejected those findings\nand refused to apply the presumption of correctness\nbecause \"the state judge made those findings without ever\ntaking into account the totality of the circumstances on the\nrecord.\" Id. at 920. It noted that Batson requires \"that, one\nway or another, a trial court . . . consider all relevant\ncircumstances before it issues a final ruling on a\ndefendant's motion.\" Id. at 921. In a compelling statement\nof the court's role under step three of the Batson inquiry,\nthe court wrote:\n\n       In light of the deferential standard of the post-AEDPA\n       S 2254 and the perfunctory quality of the second step\n       of a Batson inquiry after Purkett v. Elem, it is more\n       important today than ever that the Batson inquiry not\n       omit consideration of the totality of the circumstances,\n       both for itself and as it relates to the evaluation of\n       similarly situated potential jurors. . . . Under the pre-\n       AEDPA standards that apply here, we agree with the\n       district court that [defendant's] rights under Batson\n       were denied.\n\nId. at 921-22.\n\nThe state courts in this case rejected Riley's Batson claim\nwithout discussing any of the ample evidence that throws\ninto question the explanations offered by the prosecutor for\nstriking two of the black jurors and there is nothing\n\n                               29\n\frelevant in the record that might otherwise support the\nstate courts' decisions. Thus, we do not know why the state\ncourts found the State's explanation was plausible and\ncredible in light of the other evidence. It is because of the\nstate courts' omission of a requirement under the third step\nof the Batson inquiry -- of an ultimate determination on the\nissue of discriminatory intent based on all the facts and\ncircumstances -- that the State's argument founders.\n\nWe cannot avoid noting that Batson was not a death\npenalty case. This is. If the State failed to accord Riley his\nconstitutional right to a jury selected on a race-neutral\nbasis, we must not shirk to so hold. As Riley's lawyer asked\nat oral argument, \"If not this case, what case? If the\nevidence in this case is insufficient to show that the\nprosecutors' race-neutral rationales were pretextual, what\ncase, short of a prosecutorial mea culpa would do the job?\"\nTr. of Oral Argument at 3.\n\nAfter consideration of all the arguments and the record,\nwe are compelled to conclude that the prosecution violated\nRiley's constitutional rights under Batson, and that Riley is\nentitled to relief.\n\n8. The Dissenting Opinion -- The Batson Issue\n\nIt is fitting to discuss the Dissenting Opinion at this point\nbecause our difference with the Dissent is most acute in\nour respective views of the requirements of step three of the\nBatson inquiry. Although the Dissent takes issue with\nmuch of the majority opinion, its principal argument is that\nin a habeas case the federal court must defer to the state\ncourts' findings, in this case the finding that the prosecutor\ndid not use the State's peremptory challenges striking black\njurors in a manner that violated the principles of Batson.\nWe have already discussed in detail when a state court's\nfindings are entitled to deference and when they are not,\nfocusing on the exception in S 2254(d)(8) for the situation\nwhere the state court's findings are \"not fairly supported by\nthe record.\" See supra Part II.A.4 (Standard of Review). It is\nmanifest that a finding that Batson has been satisfied must\nbe made in accordance with the process enunciated in that\ncase.\n\n                               30\n\fThe Dissent agrees that under step three of the Batson\ninquiry a judge or court must consider \"all of the relevant\nevidence that has been adduced.\" See Dis. Op. at 88. As we\npreviously discussed, the courts after Batson have\ndescribed step three as requiring the judge or court to\nexamine the prosecutor's proffered reasons for striking the\nminority jurors against the evidence presented by the\ndefendant and/or the weaknesses in the prosecutor's\nreasons. See, e.g., McMillon, 14 F.3d at 953 n.4; Jordan,\n206 F.3d at 200. The Dissent sees no reason to believe that\nthe Delaware courts did not do so in Riley's case, even\nthough the opinions of the Delaware courts rejecting Riley's\nBatson challenges never commented on the weaknesses in\nthe State's case or, even more important, never\nacknowledged that there was a step three to the Batson\ninquiry. We, therefore, proceed to try to ascertain whether\nthe hearing judge and the Delaware Supreme Court made\ntheir findings that there was no purposeful discrimination\nin accordance with the process required by Batson. If not,\nthen deference to those findings is not appropriate.\n\nThe extent of the Delaware courts' recognition of the need\nto engage in the step three inquiry is open to question on\nthis record. Nothing in the discussion of the hearing judge\nsuggests that the court performed the necessary evaluation.\nSee Riley IV, App. at 887-91. The hearing judge, using\nlanguage taken from Riley I rather than Batson, understood\nthat his obligation was to consider the prosecutor's\nproffered explanation for striking the jurors and\"then . . .\nbe satisfied by that neutral explanation and make a ruling\nto that effect.\" App. at 888. Accordingly, following what he\nunderstood to be the applicable law, the hearing judge\ndiscussed the prosecutor's proffered reasons for the two\nstrikes at issue here, and found that the prosecutor was\ncredible. See App. at 889 (\"the State provided a credible,\nrace-neutral reason for exercising its peremptory\nchallenge\") (emphasis added); id. (\"The State articulated a\nspecific race-neutral ground for challenging juror McGuire.\n. . .\") (emphasis added). Throughout, the hearing judge\nmade clear that he understood that \"[t]he test applied is the\ncredibility of the explanation given . . . .\" App. at 890.\nNothing in the hearing judge's discussion suggests that he\nundertook an evaluation of the proffered reasons in light of\n\n                               31\n\fthe evidence submitted by Riley, which is the essence of\nstep three.\n\nIt is even more questionable whether on appeal from that\ndecision the Delaware Supreme Court fully appreciated the\nrequirement. Its entire discussion of this issue is fully set\nforth in the margin.9 In this one paragraph, the Court relied\non its 1985 decision on Riley's direct appeal where it\nrejected Riley's challenge to the State's peremptory\nchallenges. Riley I, 496 A.2d 997 (Del. 1985). The 1985\ndecision is noteworthy because on that occasion (a year\nbefore Batson), the Delaware Supreme Court concluded, for\nthe first time, that \"use of peremptory challenges to exclude\nprospective jurors solely upon the basis of race violates a\ncriminal defendant's right under Del. Const., Art. I, S 7 to a\ntrial by an impartial jury.\" Riley I, 496 A.2d at 1012.\n\nIn Riley I, the Court also set out the procedure to be\nfollowed10 but nothing in the Delaware Court's laudable\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n9. The Court stated:\n\n         Riley's next contention, that the State exercised its peremptory\n         challenges for racial reasons, we find to be simply a renewed\n         attempt to reopen previously settled issues. In Riley I, [496 A.2d\n997\n         (Del. 1985)], we set forth a legal analysis functionally identical\nto the\n       Supreme Court's analysis later articulated in Batson, 476 U.S. at\n       79. In Riley I, we found that Riley's constitutional right to an\n       impartial jury had not been violated. 496 A.2d at 1009. The\n       Superior Court, after an evidentiary hearing on Riley's motion for\n       postconviction relief, held that Riley had not been denied equal\n       protection as a result of the State's use of peremptory challenges.\n       The court found that the State had provided race-neutral\n       explanations for its peremptory challenges. We find no error in\n       Superior Court's rejection of Riley's Batson claim. See Holland v.\n       Illinois, 493 U.S. 474 (1990) (the Sixth Amendment fair cross-\nsection\n       requirement of an impartial jury does not deprive a party of the\nright\n       to exercise peremptory challenges on racial or any other grounds\n       from a venire that otherwise meets Sixth Amendment cross-sectional\n       standards of representativeness). Moreover, we reaffirm our earlier\n       decision sustaining the State's peremptory challenges on state\n       constitutional grounds. Riley I, 496 A.2d at 1010-1013.\n\nRiley V, 585 A.2d 719, 725 (Del. 1990).\n\n10. That procedure required that the defendant make a prima facie\nshowing after which the trial judge\n\f32\n\fdecision requires an inquiry comparable to the Batson step\nthree. The Delaware cases at that time appear to have\nrequired that the prosecutor provide, or articulate, a race-\nneutral reason for the peremptory challenges, and that the\ncourt find the prosecutor to be credible. They do not require\nan evaluation comparable to step three. Therefore, if, as it\nappears, the Delaware Supreme Court in Riley IV rejected\nRiley's Batson claim by relying on its earlier opinion in Riley\nI, and the Riley I opinion did not require a step three\ninquiry, any assumption that the Court engaged in such an\ninquiry would be unwarranted. Or, to phrase it somewhat\ndifferently, if the state courts' findings to which the Dissent\nwould defer were not made in accordance with the process\nrequired by the United States Supreme Court, deference is\nnot required.\n\nThis digression into Delaware law was undertaken to\nprovide the context in which to view the Dissent's\nsubsidiary argument, which is that we should assume that\nthe Delaware courts performed the step three analysis and\nthat it was not necessary for the Delaware courts to\ncomment on that analysis. We do not suggest that every\nstate court decision that is the subject of a habeas review\nbe as explicit as a Social Security Administrative Law\nJudge's decision. See Dis. Op. at 89. But Batson is not a\ndisability case. Although a judge considering a Batson\nchallenge is not required to comment explicitly on every\npiece of evidence in the record, some engagement with the\nevidence considered is necessary as part of step three of the\nBatson inquiry.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n       determine[s] whether there is a substantial likelihood that the\n       prosecutor is exercising the State's peremptory challenges on the\n       basis of race. A ruling in favor of the State will end any further\n       inquiry. A ruling in favor of the defendant, however, will shift\nthe\n       burden to the State to prove that the exercised challenges were not\n       racially motivated. To sustain this burden, the State . . . must\n       satisfy the court that its peremptory challenges were made on\n       grounds of specific, individual juror bias, or on grounds\nreasonably\n       related to the particular case or trial . . . and not solely on the\n       ground of the juror's race.\n\nRiley I, 496 A.2d at 1013 (quotation and citation omitted).\n\n                               33\n\fIn United States v. Harris, 192 F.3d 580, 588 (6th Cir.\n1999), the Sixth Circuit reviewed the district court's\nrejection of a Batson challenge in a case where one African-\nAmerican juror was seated but two were struck by the\ngovernment's peremptory challenges. The Court of Appeals\nremanded because it found that the district court's\"terse\nanalysis\" of step three of the Batson inquiry was\ninsufficient as it appeared that the district court\"made no\neffort to weigh the credibility of the prosecutor's asserted\nreasons for striking the panelists.\" Id. at 588. A year earlier,\nin United States v. Hill, 146 F.3d 337 (6th Cir. 1998), the\nsame court remanded another case to the district court\nbecause its analysis of step three of the Batson inquiry was\ninsufficient. The court stated, in language that could be\nequally applicable here, that \"[t]he record before us\nindicates nothing about the district court's thought\nprocesses in its step three analysis apart from its abrupt\nconclusion indicating the apparent view that the\nprosecutor's asserted justification outweighed [the\ndefendant's] showing under the totality of circumstances.\"\nId. at 342. And in Hill, unlike here, the trial court ruling on\nthe Batson claim at least stated that it performed some sort\nof weighing analysis.\n\nAlthough both of these cases came to the Court of\nAppeals on direct appeal of a district court decision rather\nthan on habeas review of a state decision, that does not\ndetract from the force of the court's understanding of what\nis required in a Batson inquiry. The process required by\nBatson, including step three, does not differ if the\nprosecutor used the peremptories to strike jurors in a state\ntrial or in a federal trial. After all, the same Constitution\napplies to both fora.\n\nThe Dissent relies almost exclusively on the statutory\npresumption of correctness owed to a state court's factual\ndetermination made after a hearing on the merits. This\ndeference is indeed the fulcrum on which our federalism\nturns. Yet in case after case -- and most particularly in\ncapital cases -- we have found that even applying the more\nstringent post-AEDPA standard of review (not applicable\nhere), there are reasons not to accord the usual deference\nto the state courts' findings. See, e.g., Jermyn v. Horn, 266\n\n                               34\n\fF.3d 257, 305 (3d Cir. 2001) (post-AEDPA denial of\ndeference to state court because it unreasonably applied\nthe principles of Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668\n(1984)); Moore v. Morton, 255 F.3d 95, 120 (3d Cir. 2001)\n(post-AEDPA denial of deference to state court because \"[a]\nreasonable application of Supreme Court precedent . . .\nrequires finding [defendant's] trial was so infected with\nunfairness that he was denied due process\"); Appel v. Horn,\n250 F.3d 203, 211 (3d Cir. 2001) (post-AEDPA denial of\ndeference to state court because, among other things, the\nstate court failed to apply the relevant Supreme Court\nprecedent of United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648 (1984)).\n\nAs we discuss in detail in the immediately preceding\nsection of this opinion, see supra Part II.A.7 (Analysis), the\nrequirement that the state courts faced with a Batson\nchallenge engage in the critical step three analysis is not a\nproduct of our own creativity but an accepted element of a\nhabeas court's obligation to examine whether a defendant's\nconstitutional right to a race-neutral jury has been\ninfringed. See, e.g., Jordan, 206 F.3d at 200; Coulter, 155\nF.3d at 921; McMillon, 14 F.3d at 953 n.4; Jones, 987 F.2d\nat 967.\n\nThe Dissent accords little weight to these authorities. But\nour disinclination to include long string cites does not\nmean that there are not numerous cases in which the\ncourts, both state11 and federal, have made clear that the\nBatson step three inquiry is not merely a formalistic one,\nbut an integral element of the required analysis. In addition\nto Harris and Hill, the Sixth Circuit cases cited above, the\nSecond Circuit has also made this point. In Barnes v.\nAnderson, 202 F.3d 150 (2d Cir. 1999), the court ordered a\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n11. See, e.g., MacKintrush v. State , 978 S.W.2.d 293, 297 (Ark. 1998)\n(describing step three of Batson as requiring \"that the trial court weigh\nand assess what has been presented to it to decide whether in light of\nall the circumstances, the proponent's explanation is or is not\npretextual\"); State v. Collier, 553 So.2d 815, 821 (La. 1989) (holding\nthat\nthe trial judge cannot simply \"[r]ubber stamp. . . [a prosecutor's] non-\nracial explanation, no matter how whimsical or fanciful, . . . [but] in\norder to permit a questioned [peremptory] challenge, . . . must conclude\nthat the proffered reasons are, first, neutral and reasonable, and,\nsecond, not a pretext\") (quotation omitted).\n\n                               35\n\fnew trial because the trial court had denied a Batson\nmotion \"without explicit adjudication of the credibility of the\nnon-movant's race-neutral explanations for the challenged\nstrikes.\" Id. at 156 (emphasis added).\n\nThe Dissent suggests that we exceed our authority as a\nhabeas court when we comment on the failure of the state\ncourts reviewing Riley's Batson challenge to provide a\nreasoned statement for their rejection of Riley's challenge.\nAlthough the state court is not required to \"comment on all\nof the evidence\" before it, Dis. Op. at 89 (emphasis added),\nan adequate step three Batson analysis requires something\nmore than a \"terse,\" Harris, 192 F.3d at 588, \"abrupt,\" Hill,\n146 F.3d at 342, comment that the prosecutor has satisfied\nBatson.\n\nSimilarly, we do not think that a habeas court may reject\na state court's ruling on a Batson claim simply because \"it\nwas not persuaded by a particular piece of proof,\" as the\nDissent states. Dis. Op. at 87. However, as we have\nexplained, without any such statement there is no basis on\nthis record to determine if the state courts undertook, or\neven were aware of, the required Batson step three inquiry.\nThe Fourth Circuit expressed the same thought in United\nStates v. Joe, 928 F.2d 99, 103 (4th Cir. 1991), where it\nstated: \"[T]he failure of the district court to rule at each\nstep of the Batson analysis deprives . . .[a reviewing] court\nof the benefit of its factual determination and the reasons\nsupporting its ultimate holding.\" And its cases make clear\nthat such review requires that the trial court's rulings must\nbe clearly articulated. See, e.g., Jones v. Plaster, 57 F.3d\n417, 421 (4th Cir. 1995) (\"The ruling of the district court is\nso unclear that we cannot determine on the present record\nwhether the ultimate conclusion of the district court to\noverrule [the Batson] objection may be sustained.\"); United\nStates v. Blotcher, No. 95-5590, 1996 U.S. App. Lexis\n19835, *11-*12 (4th Cir. August 7, 1996) (unpublished)\n(\"We find the record so unclear that we cannot determine\nwhether the district court applied the proper legal analysis\nin sustaining the prosecution's Batson objection to\n[defendent's] peremptory strike against [a] juror.\").\n\nMost of the Dissent's other comments on the Batson\nissue in this case have been previously anticipated and\n\n                               36\n\fdiscussed. We take this opportunity, however, to remark\nupon the manner in which the Dissent comments upon the\nreference to the pattern of the State's use of its\nperemptories to exclude black jurors in all four first degree\nmurder cases, including Riley's, tried in the county the\nsame year. Because of the lack of information about some\nof those cases, we refrained from suggesting that such\nevidence, standing alone, would show intentional\ndiscrimination but pointed out that it was the State that\nsought an opportunity to produce supplementary evidence.\nThe following correspondence, which was preceded by the\noral dialogue quoted previously in its opinion, supra at\ntypescript page 18, clarifies the situation.\n\nOn January 9, 1989, the hearing judge wrote to counsel:\n\n        This will confirm the conclusion of the postconviction\n       relief hearing in the above-captioned matter. It is the\n       Court's understanding that the defendant's\n       presentation and all rebuttal by the State available on\n       the date of the hearing has been completed. However,\n       at the State's request, the Court did hold the record\n       open on the hearing to be supplemented by a rebuttal\n       summary of jury composition in State peremptory\n       challenges in first degree murder trials in Kent County\n       over a determined period of time if the State wished to\n       supplement the record.\n\n        Further, the hearing record will close on January 30,\n       1989; the Court expects proposed findings of fact and\n       conclusions of law from both parties no later than\n       February 6, 1989.\n\nSee Letter to this Court from Thomas J. Allingham II (Dec.\n16, 1999), Ex. B (on file in the Clerk's office) (emphasis\nadded).\n\nSome three weeks later, on January 27, 1989, and just\nbefore the hearing record was to close, the State advised\nthe court as follows:\n\n        Please be advised that the State will not supplement\n       the record of the post conviction relief hearing held in\n       the above-captioned matter on December 30, 1988.\n\nId.\n\n                                37\n\fThus the State, which had assured the court that\nmaterials from other cases \"do exist\" that would be contrary\nto Riley's representation, App. at 874, and having been\ngiven the opportunity that it requested to supplement the\nrecord with evidence as to jury composition, surprisingly\nand without explanation, declined to produce evidence that\nblacks served on juries in first degree murder cases in the\ncounty in the same period that Riley was tried before an all-\nwhite jury. The presumption that could be drawn from\nthese facts is one of the circumstances that should have\nbeen evaluated by the Delaware courts in the required step\nthree inquiry.\n\nThe Dissent comments that Riley offered no expert\nanalysis of the statistics. The procedural posture of the\ncase at that time provided no such opportunity. Riley\nproduced evidence of the statistics of the racial composition\nof the jurors in the four cases, the State requested the\nadditional time to provide counter-evidence, and the\nhearing judge left the record open for that purpose. There\nwould have been no basis for expert analysis until all the\nevidence as to jury composition was produced. The State's\nletter that it would produce no evidence was dated three\ndays before the record closed.\n\nFurther, the Dissent's attempt to analogize the statistical\nevidence of the use of peremptory challenges to strike black\njurors to the percent of left-handed presidents requires\nsome comment. The dissent has overlooked the obvious fact\nthat there is no provision in the Constitution that protects\npersons from discrimination based on whether they are\nright-handed or left handed. To suggest any comparability\nto the striking of jurors based on their race is to minimize\nthe history of discrimination against prospective black\njurors and black defendants, which was the raison d'etre of\nthe Batson decision.\n\nTo reiterate, the factual findings of a state court are\nentitled to deference only when there is \"probative evidence\nunderlying [its] conclusion.\" See Rushen, 464 U.S. at 122\nn.6. The Dissent points to no such probative evidence. It\nrelies merely on the credibility finding of the hearing judge,\na finding that we cannot be sure was made following\nconsideration of all the evidence presented by Riley and the\n\n                               38\n\fweaknesses he pointed to in the prosecutor's proffered\nreasons.\n\n9. Appropriate Remedy\n\nWhen counsel for the State was asked at the en banc\nargument whether, if this court were to find a Batson\nviolation, the State would rather the relief be the grant of a\nnew trial or the remand for a federal evidentiary hearing,\ncounsel candidly responded:\n\n        MR. MEYERS: If we -- the answer is yes. If, and if we\n       -- I mean, if the court imagines, has all these problems\n       with the hearing that was done six years after the trial,\n       those problems are simply going to be magnified,\n       amplified by exponential order of magnitude 20 years\n       after the trial. I mean if you think that people have\n       memory problems six years, how much worse are you\n       going to be 20 years later?\n\nTr. of Oral Argument at 46. Riley's counsel concurred,\nstating that a federal habeas judge would be no better off\nthan the hearing judge was in 1988.\n\nWe agree. Much of the Dissent's opposition is directed to\nthe majority's failure to remand to the District Court for a\nhearing but the Dissent may have overlooked that both\nparties preferred a new trial to a remand should this court\nfind that the state proceedings were not shown to be\nconsistent with the requirement of Batson. It is highly\nunlikely that the witnesses can provide more illuminating\ntestimony thirteen years later. Moreover, there are no\nfactual issues that can be solved by a federal evidentiary\nhearing.12 Although the Dissent chooses to characterize the\nresult in this case as a federal court's substitution of its\nown findings for those of the state court, in fact we are\nmerely fulfilling the traditional role of a federal habeas\ncourt, which is, in part, to determine whether the state\ncourt's decision is \"fairly supported by the record.\" The one\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n12. This is unlike the situation in Hakeem v. Beyer, 990 F.2d 750 (3d\nCir. 1993), where we held that the state court's finding regarding the\ndelay in the proceedings was not entitled to the presumption of\ncorrectness but directed the district court to determine in a federal\nhabeas evidentiary hearing the reason for the delay.\n\n                                39\n\fpossible factual issue cannot be resolved by a hearing,13\nand the statistical evidence, which might be the subject of\nsome analysis at such a hearing, is relevant but not\ndispositive to our decision.\n\nThe question of the remedy a habeas court should order\nfollowing a finding that the state process did not comply\nwith constitutional requirements is not a new one. In\nBrown v. Kelly, 973 F.2d 116 (2d Cir. 1992), the federal\ncourt of appeals was faced with a comparable situation as\nthat before us. Defendant was convicted in state court of\nmurder and first degree robbery. He eventually came to the\nfederal court with a petition for a writ of habeas corpus,\nclaiming, inter alia, a violation of Batson. The federal courts\ndid not find that Batson had been violated but the Second\nCircuit took the opportunity to consider the appropriate\nremedy when a constitutional violation is found by the\nfederal courts sitting in habeas. The court stated,\"[T]here\nare cases where the passage of time may impair a trial\ncourt's ability to make a reasoned determination of the\nprosecutor's state of mind when the jury was selected.\nWhere such demonstrably exists, there must be a new\ntrial.\" Id. at 121.\n\nThe Brown court cited United States v. Alcantar, 897 F.2d\n436, 438-39 (9th Cir. 1990) (ordering a new trial because\nthere was inadequate evidence to determine, as part of\nBatson analysis, why the jurors were struck). And in\nBarnes, 202 F.3d at 157, the Court of Appeals ordered a\nnew trial rather than a remand for a hearing on the Batson\nissues because the trial judge had died and the court was\n\"not confident . . . that further proceedings would . . . shed\nreliable light upon the voir dire.\") (quotation omitted).\n\nThe circumstances of this case are closely analogous to\nthose in Hardcastle v. Horn, ___ F. Supp. 2d ___, 2001 WL\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n13. Although neither party has focused on it, there is an apparent\nfactual discrepancy between McGuire's testimony that he did not request\nto be excused, App. at 850, and the trial judge's statement that McGuire\ncame to see him and requested to be excused, App. at 250. It is agreed\nthat McGuire saw the trial judge, but McGuire testified it was at the\njudge's direction. As the trial judge is deceased, a federal evidentiary\nhearing would not resolve this issue, even if it were important to do so.\n\n                               40\n\f722781 (E.D. Pa., June 27, 2001), where the district court\nfound a Batson violation but dismissed the notion of\nordering a federal evidentiary hearing instead of a new trial\nin state court, commenting that \"[n]early twenty years have\npassed since Petitioner's trial, such a length of time that\neven Respondents admit that an evidentiary hearing on\nPetitioner's Batson claim is unlikely to be helpful.\" Id. at\n*19. The Hardcastle court stated that \"[a] new trial is\nespecially appropriate where as here, the passage of time\nmakes a new evidentiary hearing on the petition\nimpossible.\" Id.14 Likewise, we see no reason to order the\nDistrict Court to provide Riley with an evidentiary hearing\nthat it declined to provide on two prior occasions. Instead,\nwe will reverse the District Court's order denying Riley's\npetition for a writ of habeas corpus, and remand for the\nDistrict Court to grant the writ without prejudice to the\nState retrying the case pursuant to the guidelines to be set\nby the District Court.\n\nB.\n\nTHE CALDWELL CLAIM\n\nIn addition to Riley's Batson claim presented to the en\nbanc court, Riley argues that the prosecutor and the trial\njudge made remarks to the jury during the penalty hearing\nthat misled the jury as to its sense of responsibility in the\nsentencing process, in violation of the principles set forth in\nCaldwell v. Mississippi, 472 U.S. 320 (1985). In Caldwell,\nthe Supreme Court held that prosecutorial comments at\nsentencing violated the Eighth Amendment by leading the\njury to believe that ultimate responsibility for determining\nthe appropriateness of the death sentence rested with the\nstate supreme court. See 472 U.S. at 333.\n\nThe Delaware Supreme Court, on direct appeal, rejected\nRiley's Caldwell claim, commenting that\"[i]n no sense may\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n14. The Hardcastle case is on appeal to this court, and our reference to\nthis limited aspect of the decision, which is applicable here, is not\nintended to reflect an opinion as to the merits of the District Court's\ndecision on the Batson issue.\n\n                               41\n\fit reasonably be said that the prosecutor was either\nmisstating the law, misleading the jury as to its role, or\nminimizing its sentencing responsibility.\" Riley I, 496 A.2d\nat 1025. The District Court agreed, thus denying Riley\nhabeas relief. See Riley VIII, 1998 WL 172856, at *31. A\nCaldwell claim presents mixed questions of law and fact\nsubject to plenary review in the habeas context. See Miller\nv. Fenton, 474 U.S. 104, 112-14 (1985); see also Moore v.\nGibson, 195 F.3d 1152, 1171 (10th Cir. 1999).\n\nIn Caldwell, the defense attorney in a capital murder\ncase pleaded with the jury in closing arguments at the\nsentencing phase to spare the defendant's life. In reply, the\nprosecutor stated:\n\n       Ladies and gentlemen, I intend to be brief. I'm in\n       complete disagreement with the approach the defense\n       has taken. I don't think it's fair. I think it's unfair. I\n       think the lawyers know better. Now, they would have\n       you believe that you're going to kill this man and they\n       know--they know that your decision is not the final\n       decision. My God, how unfair can you be? Your job is\n       reviewable. They know it.\n\n472 U.S. at 325 (emphases added).\n\nCaldwell's defense counsel objected to this statement but\nthe trial court overruled the objection, stating that it was\n\"proper that the jury realizes it is reviewable automatically\nas the death penalty commands.\" Id. The prosecutor\ncontinued:\n\n       Throughout their remarks, they attempted to give you\n       the opposite, sparing the truth. They said `Thou shall\n       not kill.' If that applies to him, it applies to you,\n       insinuating that your decision is the final decision and\n       that they're gonna take Bobby Caldwell out in the front\n       of this Courthouse in moments and string him up and\n       that is terribly, terribly unfair. For they know, as I\n       know, and as Judge Baker has told you, that the\n       decision you render is automatically reviewable by the\n       Supreme Court. Automatically, and I think it's unfair\n       and I don't mind telling them so.\n\nId. at 325-26 (emphasis added).\n\n                                  42\n\fAlthough the jury's sentence in Caldwell was indeed\nsubject to automatic review by the state supreme court, the\nUnited States Supreme Court's plurality opinion stated that\nthe prosecutor's statement was \"inaccurate, both because it\nwas misleading as to the nature of the appellate court's\nreview and because it depicted the jury's role in a way\nfundamentally at odds with the role that a capital sentencer\nmust perform.\" Id. at 336. Justice O'Connor, who cast the\nfifth and deciding vote, emphasized that \"[j]urors may\nharbor misconceptions about the power of state appellate\ncourts or, for that matter, [the United States Supreme\nCourt] to override a jury's sentence of death.\" Id. at 342\n(O'Connor, J., concurring). According to Justice O'Connor,\nthe prosecutor's statements were impermissible because\nthey \"creat[ed] the mistaken impression that automatic\nappellate review of the jury's sentence would provide the\nauthoritative determination of whether death was\nappropriate\" whereas under state law the relevant scope of\nreview was limited to whether the verdict was \"so arbitrary\nthat it was against the overwhelming weight of the\nevidence.\" Id. at 343 (O'Connor, J., concurring) (quotation\nomitted).\n\nIn Romano v. Oklahoma, 512 U.S. 1 (1994), the Supreme\nCourt clarified the Caldwell holding. Accepting Justice\nO'Connor's concurrence as controlling, the Romano Court\nexplained that Caldwell prohibits prosecutorial comments\nthat \"mislead the jury as to its role in the sentencing\nprocess in a way that allows the jury to feel less responsible\nthan it should for the sentencing decision.\" Id. at 9\n(quotation omitted). Accordingly, \"[t]o establish a Caldwell\nviolation, a defendant necessarily must show that the\nremarks to the jury improperly described the role assigned\nto the jury by local law.\" Id. (quotation omitted). The Court\nsubsequently rejected Romano's Caldwell claim because\n\"the jury was not affirmatively misled regarding its role in\nthe sentencing process.\" Id.\n\nIn Riley's case, Liguori began his opening comments in\nthe penalty phase by stating:\n\n       As the Judge has explained to you we have a specific\n       statute with regard to what occurred in a penalty\n       hearing in a capital case.\n\n                               43\n\f       Let me say at the outset that what you do today is\n       automatically reviewed by our Supreme Court and that\n       is why there is an automatic review on the death\n       penalty. That is why, if you return a decision of death,\n       that is why you will receive and have to fill out a two-\n       page interrogatory that the Court will give you. This is\n       an interrogatory that specifically sets out the questions\n       that the State request and whether or not you believe\n       it beyond a reasonable doubt and if you want in your\n       determination, if you believe the sentence should be\n       death than each and every one of you has to sign this.\n       This goes to the Supreme Court. That is why it is\n       concise and we believe clear and it should be looked\n       carefully on and answered appropriately.\n\nApp. at 393 (emphases added).\n\nAt oral argument before the en banc court, the State\nconceded that Liguori's statement, at least \"on its face,\" is\nno different from that of the prosecutor in Caldwell. Tr. of\nOral Argument at 49. Counsel for the State told us that\nwhen \"[y]ou compare the two, they are pretty much alike.\"\nTr. of Oral Argument at 49. Like the statement in Caldwell,\nLiguori's statement regarding automatic appellate review\nwas technically accurate since Delaware law provided for\nautomatic review by the Delaware Supreme Court of a\njury's sentence of death. However, that automatic review\nwas extremely limited, as was that of the Mississippi\nSupreme Court in Caldwell.\n\nAt the time of Riley's sentencing hearing, the relevant\nportion of the capital sentencing statute provided:\n\n       The Supreme Court shall limit its review under this\n       section to the recommendation on and imposition of\n       the penalty of death and shall determine:\n\n       a. Whether, considering the totality of evidence in\n       aggravation and mitigation which bears upon the\n       particular circumstances or details of the offense and\n       the character and propensities of the offender, the\n       death penalty was either arbitrarily or capriciously\n       imposed or recommended . . . .\n\nDel. Code Ann. tit. 11, S 4209(g)(2) (1982) (emphasis\n\n                                44\n\fadded). Indeed, in Delaware the jury's weighing of\naggravating and mitigating circumstances was, for all\npractical purposes, final. We have found no published\nopinion during the relevant time period in which the\nDelaware Supreme Court reversed a jury's sentence of\ndeath as arbitrarily or capriciously imposed.15\n\nIt is apparent, then, that, like the prosecutor's statement\nin Caldwell, Liguori's reference to automatic appellate\nreview was misleading as to the scope of appellate review.\nAs was explained in Caldwell, jurors may not understand\nthe limited nature of appellate review, which affords\nsubstantial deference to a jury's determination that death is\nthe appropriate sentence. See 472 U.S. at 332-33.\nFurthermore, jurors who are unconvinced that death is the\nappropriate punishment but who are eager to send a\nmessage of disapproval for the defendant's acts might be\n\"very receptive to the prosecutor's assurance that [they] can\nmore freely err because the error may be corrected on\nappeal.\" Id. at 331 (quotation omitted). As one of our sister\ncircuits has explained, \"[f]or the jury to see itself as\nadvisory when it is not, or to be comforted by a belief that\nits decision will not have effect unless others make the\nsame decision, is a frustration of the essence of the jury\nfunction.\" Sawyer v. Butler, 881 F.2d 1273, 1282 (5th Cir.\n1989).\n\nIt is therefore not enough to argue, as the State does,\nthat Liguori's comments at sentencing were a correct and\naccurate statement of Delaware law. The statute at the time\ncontained more than 40 different provisions detailing\nprocedures and requirements applicable to a death\nsentence, but the only one the prosecutor chose to\nemphasize was that providing for automatic review of the\njury's sentence.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n15. The Delaware capital sentencing scheme was substantially amended\nin 1991. Under the amended statute, \"the jury now functions only in an\nadvisory capacity. The judge, after taking the jury's recommendation into\nconsideration, has the ultimate responsibility for determining whether\nthe defendant will be sentenced to life imprisonment or death.\" State v.\nCohen, 604 A.2d 846, 849 (Del. 1992). In contrast, when Riley was\nsentenced, the jury's death sentence was binding on the judge.\n\n                               45\n\fNor does the State satisfactorily explain why Liguori\nreferred to \"automatic review on the death penalty\" in\nconnection with his explanation of the interrogatory form.\nApp. at 393. The interrogatory form contained only two\nquestions: whether the jury unanimously found beyond a\nreasonable doubt that an aggravating circumstance existed16\nand, if the jury answered \"yes,\" whether it unanimously\nrecommended a sentence of death. Such a simple and\nstraightforward form hardly needed an explanation.\nInstead, that \"explanation\" appears to have been used as a\nsegue to alert the jury to the fact that the Delaware\nSupreme Court would automatically review its decision to\nimpose a death sentence.\n\n\"The sentencing decision in capital cases is born out of\nan inherent and unique mixture of anger, judgment and\nretribution, and requires a determination whether certain\nacts are so beyond the pale of community standards as to\nwarrant the execution of their author.\" Sawyer, 881 F.2d at\n1278. Perhaps more than any other decision rendered by a\njury, a sentence of death is \"irreducibl[y] discretionary.\" Id.\nYet in Caldwell, the Supreme Court noted that \"[b]elief in\nthe truth of the assumption that sentencers treat their\npower to determine the appropriateness of death as an\nawesome responsibility has allowed this Court to view\nsentencer discretion as consistent with--and indeed as\nindispensable to--the Eighth Amendment's need for\nreliability in the determination that death is the appropriate\npunishment in a specific case.\" 472 U.S. at 330 (quotations\nomitted). It follows that there is particular concern \"when\nthere are state-induced suggestions that the sentencing\njury may shift its sense of responsibility to an appellate\ncourt.\" Id. Unlike our decision in Zettlemoyer v. Fulcomer,\n923 F.2d 284, 306 (3d Cir. 1991), where we rejected a\nCaldwell claim, in part because \"[t]here was no suggestion\nto the jury that the [state] Supreme Court . .. or anyone\nelse would have the last word in the case,\" here the\nprosecutor expressly stated both \"there is an automatic\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n16. The jury had previously been instructed that, by convicting Riley of\nfelony murder, it already had found that an aggravating circumstance\nexisted.\n\n                               46\n\freview\" and \"[t]his goes to the [state] Supreme Court.\" App.\nat 393.\n\nThe Dissent suggests that there was no Caldwell violation\nhere because the prosecutor's statement was made\"near\nthe very beginning of his summation,\" and consisted of\n\"accurate, unemotional, passing remarks.\" The Dissent also\ncharacterizes the prosecutor's remarks as \"the mere\nmention of the fact that there would be an automatic\nappeal to the state supreme court.\"\n\nIt is true that the prosecutor's statement was made near\nthe beginning of his summation, but his summation was\nnot a lengthy speech, occupying a mere four pages of the\ntranscript, App. at 393-97, of which the remarks in\nquestion take almost a full page. We cannot tell whether\nthey were \"emotional\" or not, but they can hardly be\ncharacterized as \"passing,\" as the prosecutor began by\nsaying, \"Let me say at the outset that what you do today is\nautomatically reviewed by our Supreme Court.\" And, as we\nnoted above, in that one paragraph, the prosecutor referred\nnot once but twice to the Supreme Court -- both\nmentioning \"automatic review\" and that the interrogatory to\nbe completed by the jurors also \"goes to the Supreme\nCourt.\"\n\nWe are unwilling to treat lightly the prosecutor's pointed\nreferences to appellate review of this crucial decision.\nStatements, like those made by the prosecutor here,\"can\nbe literally true but quite misleading by failing, for example,\nto disclose information essential to make what was said not\nmisleading.\" Sawyer, 881 F.2d at 1285. As a result, a\nCaldwell violation may be established where a technically\naccurate statement describing the state appellate review\nprocess nonetheless \"misled the jury to minimize its role in\nthe sentencing process.\" Driscoll v. Delo, 71 F.3d 701, 713\n(8th Cir. 1995) (holding that prosecutor had violated\nCaldwell by emphasizing that the trial judge could\ndisregard the jury's recommendation of death even though\nno state judge had in fact ever done so).\n\nGiven the limited nature of the Delaware Supreme\nCourt's review of a jury's sentence of death at the time of\nRiley's sentencing, a fact Liguori did not explain to the jury,\n\n                                47\n\fwe conclude that there was a Caldwell violation in this case.17\nAs suggested in Caldwell, jurors are unlikely to understand\nthe exceptionally narrow scope of appellate review given to\njury determinations on death. See 472 U.S. at 330-31; see\nalso id. at 342 (O'Connor, J., concurring). Although\nLiguori's remarks were brief, they were the first comments\nthat the jury heard at sentencing, making them more likely\nto have made an impression. A statement does not have to\nbe lengthy to be effective in suggesting to the jury that\nultimate responsibility for sentencing lies elsewhere.\n\nMoreover, nothing the trial court said corrected any\nmisimpression left by the prosecution's statements, as the\njudge made no comment whatsoever pertaining to appellate\nreview. Unlike Jones v. Butler, 864 F.2d 348, 360 (5th Cir.\n1988), where the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held\nthat the prosecutor's statement that \"[I]f, in fact, you do\nreturn the death penalty . . . yours will not be the last\nword. Every sentence is reviewed by the Supreme Court,\"\nwas improper but cured by a prompt curative instruction\nby the trial judge, here there was no curative instruction.18\n\nCaldwell and its progeny make clear that\"the sentencing\njury must continue to feel the weight of responsibility so\nlong as it has responsibility.\" Sawyer, 881 F.2d at 1282.\nBecause the prosecutor's remarks may have misled the jury\ninto thinking the Delaware Supreme Court was the final\narbiter of Riley's fate, we conclude that Riley's\nconstitutional rights were violated under Caldwell. Thus,\neven were we to find that Riley has not shown a Batson\nviolation entitling him to a new trial, we still would direct\nthe District Court to grant the writ of habeas corpus\nentitling Riley to a new sentencing hearing.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n17. At oral argument counsel for the State acknowledged that \"[p]erhaps\nbetter practice would have been for Liguori to insert the word `limited' \"\ninto his reference to automatic appellate review. Tr. of Oral Argument at\n50. This could be construed as a concession by the State that Liguori's\ncomments were misleading because of what they did not tell the jury.\n\n18. We are not persuaded by Riley's contention that the trial judge's\nrepeated references to the jury's determination on death as a\n\"recommendation\" misled the jury as to its actual responsibility in the\nsentencing process. See generally Flamer v. Delaware, 68 F.3d 710 (3d\nCir. 1995).\n\n                               48\n\fIII.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThis is an appropriate case for the issuance of a writ of\nhabeas corpus. One of the principal objections to the\noperation of the death penalty in this country is that it is\napplied unevenly, particularly against poor black\ndefendants. Another concern is that because of the complex\nreview process, the jury may not comprehend the\nsignificance of its life-or-death decision. Both of these\nissues are implicated in this case. An appropriate order\nfollows.\n\n                               49\n\f[This page intentionally left blank]\n\n                               50\n\fVolume 2 of 2\n\n                51\n\fAPPENDIX A\n\nExcerpts from Panel Opinion in Riley v.

He contends,\nfirst, that it should be presumed that he was prejudiced by\npretrial publicity because the record establishes the\nexistence of a \"hostile trial atmosphere\" and, second, that\nthe record shows that several jurors were unable to be\nimpartial due to exposure to unfavorable pretrial publicity.\n\nA.\n\n\"Where media or other community reaction to a crime or\na defendant engenders an atmosphere so hostile and\npervasive as to preclude a rational trial process, a court\nreviewing for constitutional error will presume prejudice to\nthe defendant without reference to an examination of the\nattitudes of those who served as the defendant's jurors.\"\nRock v. Zimmerman, 959 F.2d 1237, 1252 (3d Cir. 1992).\nSee also Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U.S. 333 (1966); Estes\nv. Texas, 381 U.S. 532 (1965); Rideau v. Louisiana, 373\nU.S. 723 (1963); Flamer v. Delaware, 68 F.3d 736, 755 (3d\nCir. 1995) (en banc). \"The community and media reaction,\nhowever, must have been so hostile and so pervasive as to\nmake it apparent that even the most careful voir dire\nprocess would be unable to assure an impartial jury.. . .\nSuch cases are exceedingly rare.\" Rock, 959 F.2d at 1252-\n53.\n\nIn this case, the state courts made a finding of\nimpartiality. Such a finding is entitled to deference, see\nPatton v. Yount, 467 U.S. 1025, 1031 & n. 7 (1984), and we\nfind no basis for overturning that finding.\n\n                                52\n\fRiley relies on a relatively small number of newspaper\narticles, almost half of which appeared six months or more\nbefore the trial. Although two of the articles named Riley as\na suspect in Feeley's murder, and although a few of the\narticles discussed the plight of the Feeley children, who\nwere orphaned by the murder, the articles were not\ninflammatory. In short, the media coverage was not\"so\nhostile and pervasive as to preclude a rational trial\nprocess.\" Rock, 959 F.2d at 1252.\n\nB.\n\nBecause Riley has not shown the presence of\ncircumstances justifying a presumption of prejudice, he\n\"must establish that those who actually served on his jury\nlacked a capacity to reach a fair and impartial verdict based\nsolely on the evidence they heard in the courtroom.\" Rock,\n959 F.2d at 1253. See also Patton, 467 U.S. at 1035; Irvin\nv. Dowd, 366 U.S. 717, 723 (1961). \"The fact that jury\nmembers may have been exposed to press reports or other\ncommunity reaction concerning the case and even the fact\nthat they may have formed a tentative opinion based on\nthat exposure will not establish a constitutional violation if\nthe trial court has found, with record support, that each of\nthe jurors was able to put aside extrinsic influences.\" Rock,\n959 F.2d at 1253.\n\nRiley contends that two jurors, Leon Morris and Carl\nPatterson, were unable to be impartial due to exposure to\npretrial publicity. We do not agree.\n\nMorris testified during voir dire that he \"had read\nsomething about\" the case in the newspaper at the time of\nthe murder and that he had heard on the radio that the\ncase was \"coming to trial.\" App. 277. The following\nexchange then occurred:\n\n        Q. . . . Because of what you read in the newspaper,\n       do you feel that you could sit here as an impartial\n       jury?\n\n        A. Yes, because I know nothing of the evidence or\n       anything else.\n\nApp. 278.\n\n                               53\n\fCarl Patterson during voir dire was asked whether\nanything he had read in the newspaper had created bias or\nprejudice against the defendant. See App. 294. He\nresponded that he could not remember a lot of what he\nread in the newspaper. See id. The following colloquy then\noccurred:\n\n        Q. Then do you know of any reason why you can't\n       render an impartial verdict based solely upon the law\n       and the evidence?\n\n        A. No, Your Honor.\n\nId.\n\nThe trial judge implicitly found that these jurors were\nimpartial, and the Delaware Supreme Court agreed on\ndirect appeal. Such implicit findings are entitled to a\npresumption of correctness. Parke v. Raley, 506 U.S. 20, 35\n(1992); Weeks v. Snyder, 2000 WL 975043 (3d Cir. July 17,\n2000); Campbell v. Vaughn, 209 F.3d 280, 290 (3d Cir.\n2000), and we see no ground for holding that that\npresumption has been overcome.\n\nIV.\n\nRiley argues that the prosecution violated his right to due\nprocess by failing to disclose exculpatory evidence in its\npossession as required by Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83\n(1963). In Brady, the Supreme Court held that \"the\nsuppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an\naccused upon request violates due process where the\nevidence is material either to guilt or to punishment,\nirrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the\nprosecution.\" Id. at 87. To state a valid Brady claim, a\nplaintiff must show that the evidence was (1) suppressed,\n(2) favorable, and (3) material to the defense. See United\nStates v. Perdomo, 929 F.2d 967, 970 (3d Cir. 1991).\nEvidence is material if there is a reasonable probability that\nthe outcome would have been different had the evidence\nbeen disclosed to the defense. See United States v. Bagley,\n473 U.S. 667, 678 (1985). Evidence that may be used to\nimpeach may qualify as Brady material. See Kyles v.\nWhitley, 514 U.S. 419, 445 (1995); Bagley , 473 U.S. at 676.\n\n                                54\n\fRiley's Brady argument concerns a wiretap on the\ntelephone of the mother of Tyrone Baxter. Before trial,\nRiley's lawyer asked the state to produce recordings or\ntranscripts of the intercepted calls, but the state refused,\narguing that the tapes contained no exculpatory material.\nWithout listening to the tape himself, the trial judge\naccepted the prosecutor's representation and denied Riley's\nmotion for production. Throughout the subsequent\nproceedings in state and federal court, no judge listened to\nthe tapes.\n\nIn his briefs in this appeal, Riley made a strong Brady\nargument. He asserted that between the time of the Feeley\nmurder and Baxter's arrest, \"Baxter spoke to his mother on\nthe telephone on several occasions\"; that \"Baxter's\ntestimony was the State's strongest evidence against\" him;\nand that statements made by Baxter to his mother might\nhave provided valuable impeachment evidence. Appellant's\nBr. at 5. At a minimum, he contended, the state courts or\nthe District Court should have listened to the tapes in\ncamera to determine whether they contained Brady\nmaterial.\n\nAt oral argument, however, counsel for the appellees\nrepresented that an examination of the logs of the wiretap\non Mrs. Baxter's telephone did not reveal any intercepted\nconversations in which Baxter participated. Copies of the\nlogs were provided to Riley's attorneys and to the court, and\nRiley's attorneys submitted a letter-brief commenting on the\ncontents of the logs. We have examined the logs, and it\nappears that the state's representation is correct: we see no\nrecord of any conversations in which Baxter participated.\nThe revelation that the logs do not mention any such\nconversations fatally undermines the Brady argument made\nin Riley's briefs.\n\nIn their post-argument letter-brief commenting on the\nlogs, Riley's attorneys advance different arguments to show\nthat an in camera inspection of the wiretap recordings is\nrequired. A defendant seeking an in camera inspection to\ndetermine whether files contain Brady material must at\nleast make a \"plausible showing\" that the inspection will\nreveal material evidence. Pennsylvania v. Ritchie, 480 U.S.\n39, 58 n.15 (1987) (quoting United States v. Valenzuela-\n\n                                55\n\fBernal, 458 U.S. 858, 867 (1982)). Mere speculation is not\nenough. United States v. Navarro, 737 F.2d 625, 631 (7th\nCir. 1984). The arguments made by Riley's attorneys in\ntheir post-argument submission do not satisfy this\nstandard.\n\nRiley's attorneys first note that several log entries\n\"expressly refer to conversations about Tyrone Baxter.\"\n12/16/99 Letter-brief at 3 (emphasis added). But it is\nunlikely that statements \"about\" Baxter by third persons --\nunlike statements made by Baxter himself -- could have\nbeen used to impeach Baxter's testimony or could have\nbeen admitted at trial on some other ground. For that\nreason alone, it is unlikely that these statements are\nmaterial. See Wood v. Bartholomew, 516 U.S. 1, 5-6 (1995).\nMoreover, even if the problem of admissibility is put aside,\nit is pure speculation to suppose that the contents of the\nstatements are in any way exculpatory.\n\nRiley's attorneys also suggest that conversations between\nBaxter and his mother may have been intercepted and\nrecorded but that the person or persons who compiled the\nlogs may not have recognized Baxter's voice. This, however,\nis nothing but the purest speculation. We note that the\nwiretap occurred while the police were seeking to arrest\nBaxter; they therefore had a strong incentive to identify him\nif he participated in any of the intercepted conversations.\nWe have considered all of Riley's Brady arguments and find\nthem to be without merit.\n\nV.\n\nRiley argues that he was denied the effective assistance\nof counsel at the penalty phase of his trial.1 The District\nCourt held that many of Riley's arguments concerning the\nalleged deficiencies of his attorney's performance were never\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. Riley's amended federal habeas petition raised claims regarding the\nalleged ineffectiveness of trial counsel at the guilty phase, but the\nDistrict Court held that these claims were procedurally barred. See Riley\nVI, 1998 WL 172856, at **18-20. On appeal, Riley refers to these claims\nin a footnote. See Appellant's Br. at 38 n.16. This footnote is inadequate\nto raise the issue on appeal.\n\n                                56\n\fpresented to the Delaware Supreme Court and were thus\nprocedurally barred, and the District Court rejected Riley's\nremaining arguments regarding this matter on the merits.\nOn appeal, Riley attacks both parts of the District Court's\nholding.\n\nA.\n\nRiley contends that the District Court was required to\nhold an evidentiary hearing on the question of procedural\ndefault for two reasons. First, he maintains that at least\nsome of the arguments that the District Court held were\nprocedurally barred might have been presented to the\nDelaware Supreme Court during the oral argument of his\ndirect appeal even though those arguments were not\ncontained in his brief. Because the record does not include\na transcript of the oral argument, Riley maintains that the\nDistrict Court should have held an evidentiary hearing for\nthe purpose of reconstructing the record. See Appellant's\nBr. at 38-39. We disagree.\n\nOn direct appeal, Riley was represented by the same\nattorney who had represented him at trial. In his amended\nhabeas petition, Riley acknowledges that no ineffective\nassistance argument was made in the direct appeal brief\nthat was ultimately submitted on his behalf and accepted\nfor filing by the Delaware Supreme Court.2 See App. 1198.\nIn addition, the opinion issued by the Delaware Supreme\nCourt in the direct appeal makes no mention of ineffective\nassistance of counsel. See Riley I. Under these\ncircumstances, the District Court was certainly not\nrequired to conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine\nwhether the attorney who represented Riley at trial chose at\noral argument before the state supreme court to make\narguments not mentioned in his brief and to condemn his\nown performance in the trial court.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. The first brief submitted by Riley's attorney on direct appeal\ncontained\na conclusory passage that purported to raise the issue of ineffective\nassistance (without any factual elaboration) for the purpose of preserving\nthe issue. See App. 1198. However, this brief was rejected by the\nDelaware Supreme Court, and the brief that was ultimately submitted\nand accepted contained no such passage. See App. 1198-99.\n\n                               57\n\fWith little elaboration, Riley also contends that the\nDistrict Court should have held an evidentiary hearing so\nthat Riley could show that he had \"cause\" for not raising\nthe arguments in question in state court. See Appellant's\nBr. at 39. However, Riley has not even identified any\n\"cause\" that he would have attempted to show. We will not\nreverse the decision of the District Court and order that\nCourt to conduct an evidentiary hearing so that Riley can\ndevelop the factual predicate for a \"cause\" that Riley has\nnot even disclosed.\n\nPerhaps the most frequently asserted \"cause\" for\nprocedural default is ineffective assistance of counsel, and\nwe will therefore comment briefly on the steps that Riley\nshould have taken if he wished to rely on this \"cause.\" As\nthe District Court pointed out, in order for Riley to show\nthat ineffective assistance provided \"cause\" for failing to\nraise the arguments in question in the state court\nproceedings, Riley would have to show that the new\nattorney who represented him in the state post-conviction\nrelief proceedings was ineffective. See Dist. Ct. Op. at 50 &\nn.16, 56-57. This is so because Delaware permits a claim of\nineffective assistance to be raised in a post-conviction relief\nproceeding even if it was not raised on direct appeal. See\nRiley VI, 1998 WL 172856, at **17-18 & n.16. 3\n\nRiley has not argued, however, that the attorney who\nrepresented him in the state post-conviction relief\nproceedings provided ineffective assistance by failing to\nmake the specific arguments that the District Court held\nwere procedurally barred.4 Moreover, because Riley never\nraised a claim in state court that his post-conviction relief\nattorney was ineffective, he runs afoul of the rule that \"a\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. Indeed, in Riley's case, ineffective assistance was vigorously argued\nin\nthe post-conviction relief proceedings, and the Delaware Supreme Court\naddressed these arguments on the merits. See Riley V, 585 A.2d at 726-\n29.\n\n4. Even if Riley had asserted a \"cause\" for the procedural default, he\nwould have to confront the rule that a habeas petitioner is not entitled\nto an evidentiary hearing in federal court to establish a factual record\nunless the petitioner can show \"cause\" for not making the necessary\nfactual record in the state proceedings. See Keeney v. Tamayo-Reyes,\n504 U.S. 1, 11-12 (1992).\n\n                                58\n\fpetitioner must demonstrate independent cause and\nprejudice excusing the default of the ineffectiveness claim\nbefore that claim can be assessed as cause in relation to a\nsecond, substantive claim.\" Hill v. Jones, 81 F.3d 1015,\n1030 (11th Cir. 1996). See also Justus v. Murray , 897 F.2d\n709, 713 (4th Cir. 1990).\n\nB.\n\nWe will now discuss the ineffective assistance arguments\nthat were not procedurally defaulted. In order to show that\nhis constitutional right to the assistance of counsel was\nviolated at the penalty phase, Riley must satisfy the two-\npronged test of Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687\n(1984). First, he must demonstrate that his attorney\"made\nerrors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the\n`counsel' guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth\nAmendment.\" Id. at 687. \"Judicial scrutiny of counsel's\nperformance must be highly deferential. It is all too\ntempting for a defendant to second-guess counsel's\nassistance after . . . [an] adverse sentence, and it is all too\neasy for a court, examining counsel's defense after it has\nproved unsuccessful, to conclude that a particular act or\nomission of counsel was unreasonable.\" Id. at 689. Second,\nif counsel's representation is shown to fall outside\"the wide\nrange of reasonable professional assistance,\" id., it must be\nshown that \"the deficient performance prejudiced the\ndefense,\" that is, that \"there is a reasonable probability\nthat, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of\nthe proceeding would have been different.\" Id . at 694.\n\n1. In his brief in our court, Riley presented a greatly\ntruncated version of arguments previously advanced\nregarding trial counsel's failure to call certain family\nmembers to testify at the penalty phase of the trial and trial\ncounsel's failure to locate or contact other family members\nwho might have testified. All of these family members, Riley\nargues, could have provided evidence about his traumatic\nexperiences as a child and his \"severely dysfunctional\nfamily.\" Appellant's Br. at 41.\n\nThe Superior Court, the Delaware Supreme Court, and\nthe District Court all addressed these arguments in some\n\n                               59\n\fdetail and rejected them. They concluded that Riley's trial\nattorney made reasonable efforts to find certain family\nmembers who could not be located, that he did not act\nunreasonably in failing to call others as witnesses, and that\nhis failure to rely on what was termed Riley's \"social\nhistory\" represented a reasonable strategy. See Riley II,\n1988 WL 47076 at *3-4, *7-9; Riley V, 585 A.2d at 726-28;\nRiley VI, 1998 WL 172856, at **20-23.\n\nIn his brief in our court, Riley merely states without\nelaboration that \"trial counsel failed to call as witnesses\nmembers of Mr. Riley's immediate family, several of whom\nlived within a few hours of Dover, Delaware\" and that these\nwitnesses could have testified about his childhood and\nfamily. Appellant's Br. at 41. He provides no response to\nthe detailed reasons given by the state courts and the\nDistrict Court for holding that trial counsel was not\nineffective in failing to call or locate family members for the\npurpose of eliciting testimony about Riley's childhood and\nfamily.\n\nNothing has been presented that convinces us that the\nstate courts and the District Court erred. We agree with the\nstate courts and the District Court that Riley has not\nshown that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to call\nthose family members who could be located, such as Riley's\nmother. The District Court analyzed trial counsel's decision\nnot to put Riley's mother on the stand as follows:\n\n        The record is replete with circumstances that\n       support trial counsel's decision not to call Petitioner's\n       mother. First, Petitioner informed trial counsel that he\n       did not wish to expose his mother's problems at trial.\n       . . . Second, trial counsel testified that Petitioner's\n       mother refused to support Petitioner's alibi, and as a\n       result, he was concerned about the prosecutor's cross-\n       examination of her during the penalty phase. . . .\n       Third, the record indicates that Petitioner's mother had\n       a severe drinking problem and was drinking heavily at\n       the time of the trial. . . . As a result, trial counsel\n       believed that the witnesses that he chose to call in\n       mitigation, instead, would make a better impression on\n       the jury. . . . Under these circumstances, the Court\n       finds trial counsel's decision not to call Petitioner's\n\n                               60\n\f       mother to be reasonable and within the bounds of his\n       strategic discretion.\n\nRiley VI, 1998 WL 172856, at *2. We agree.\n\nWe also agree that Riley has not demonstrated that his\ntrial attorney was ineffective in failing to locate certain\nother family members. See Riley II, **3-5; Riley V, 585 A.2d\nat 727-28; Riley VI, 1998 WL 172856, at *21. Finally, we\nagree that a strategy of not introducing evidence regarding\nRiley's background and family fell within \"the wide range of\nreasonable professional assistance.\" Strickland, 466 U.S. at\n689. The Superior Court wrote as follows:\n\n       The adverse inferences to be drawn from the fact that\n       defendant's parents were both alcoholics, his sister an\n       unwed mother of three, his brother an incarcerated\n       criminal and his home life a series of jails and\n       temporary living quarters would no doubt have been\n       magnified in the semi-rural county where this case was\n       tried . . . . Likewise, it is certainly within the range of\n       strategic choices to forego mitigating evidence, which\n       may be seen as \"excuse making\" and rely upon a plea\n       for mercy . . . . In Riley's case, evidence offered as to\n       mitigating circumstances included: that the actual\n       killer was Tyrone Baxter, the co-defendant; that Baxter\n       received a less severe penalty; and that Riley's\n       background indicated that he was a diligent worker,\n       possessing a non-violent and good character.\n\n       In this case, trial counsel gave a strong argument that\n       Riley's life should be spared in light of the fact that\n       Tyrone Baxter, defendant's accomplice and principal\n       accuser, would be spared the death penalty as the\n       result of a plea bargain. Moreover, Walter Ross testified\n       without contradiction at the [post-conviction relief]\n       hearing that the defendant did not want his family\n       background discussed at the penalty phase. Given\n       defendant's wishes, the lack of positive evidence in\n       mitigation, counsel's focused argument for leniency in\n       light of Baxter's plea bargain, and the potentially\n       negative impact the purportedly positive evidence\n       would have wrought before the jury, defendant has\n       failed to show that counsel's decision to limit the\n\n                               61\n\f       testimony at the penalty phase was constitutionally\n       deficient.\n\nRiley II, 1988 WL 47076, at *11-12. This analysis was\naccepted by the Delaware Supreme Court and the District\nCourt. We cannot disagree.\n\n2. Riley contends that his trial attorney was ineffective\nbecause he did not present testimony by a mental health\nexpert. Riley relies on the affidavits of two experts, who\nexamined him in connection with the post-conviction relief\nproceeding. One of the experts characterized Riley as a\nperson with \"borderline defective\" intelligence whose\ncapacity \"for objectively analyzing events, circumstances\nand relationships [is] narrowed by stress and complexity.\"\nAppellant's Br. at 42. We agree with Riley that this\nexplanation might have been helpful at the penalty phase.\nThe question remains, however, whether trial counsel was\nineffective in failing to obtain such evidence at the time.\n\nIn the post-conviction relief proceeding in Superior Court,\ntrial counsel testified that he did not seek to have Riley\nexamined by a mental health expert because he had no\nreason to think, in light of his conversations with Riley,\nthat such an examination would have revealed anything\nuseful. See App. 592-96. He testified that Riley appeared to\nunderstand what they discussed and that Riley prepared\nand filed some motions on his own behalf. See App. 592-\n93. Trial counsel stated that Riley never mentioned any\nhead injury or any psychological problems. See App. 590.\nRelying on this testimony, the Superior Court found that\ntrial counsel \"had no inkling that evaluation of Mr. Riley's\nmental or emotional state might be helpful in mitigation.\"\nRiley II, 1988 WL 47076, at *7.\n\nBefore us, Riley has not argued that counsel in a capital\ncase must always seek a mental examination of the\ndefendant, and cases from other circuits reject that\nproposition. Instead, they hold that a case-by-case\ndetermination must be made and that counsel is not\nineffective if he or she has no reason to think that a mental\nexamination would be useful. See Thomas v. Gilmore, 144\nF.3d 513, 515-16 (7th Cir. 1998); United States v. Miller,\n907 F.2d 994, 998-99 (10th Cir. 1990); United States ex rel.\nRivera v. Franzen, 794 F.2d 314, 317 (7th Cir. 1986).\n\n                               62\n\fUnder this standard, we see no ground for reversing the\ndecision of the District Court here. Riley has simply not\nidentified any fact that should have alerted his trial\nattorney that he had mental problems that might have\nprovided the basis for mitigation. The only fact even\nmentioned in Riley's briefs is the \"implausible\" nature of\nRiley's alibi, see Reply Br. at 21, but this is insufficient to\nalert counsel to the possibility of mental problems that\nmight be relevant to mitigation. For the most part, Riley\nmerely notes what the subsequent examinations by mental\nhealth experts revealed. However, \"[a] fair assessment of\nattorney performance requires that every effort be made to\neliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct\nthe circumstances of counsel's challenged conduct, and to\nevaluate the conduct from counsel's perspective at the\ntime.\" Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689.\n\n3. Finally, Riley cites trial counsel's inexperience and\nthe fact that he spent only 14 hours preparing for the\npenalty phase of the trial. These facts are not comforting,\nbut they do not in themselves establish that counsel was\nineffective. We have taken them into account in evaluating\nthe other deficiencies properly asserted in this appeal. We\ncannot say, however, that Riley's constitutional right to the\neffective assistance of counsel was denied.\n\nVI.\n\nRelying on Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U.S. 68, 76-77 (1985),\nRiley argues that his right to due process was violated\nbecause the trial judge refused to appoint co-counsel or an\ninvestigator to assist his attorney. Riley again notes the\ninexperience of his attorney, and he asserts that co-counsel\nhad been appointed in Kent County in prior capital cases.\nAlthough Riley claims that the lack of co-counsel and an\ninvestigator caused him \"extreme prejudice,\" his brief\nprovides no details.\n\nA. We turn first to Riley's argument that he was\nconstitutionally entitled to the appointment of co-counsel.\nIn some jurisdictions, there is a statutory right to the\nappointment of two defense attorneys in capital cases. See,\ne.g., 18 U.S.C. S 3005. However, we are aware of no\n\n                               63\n\fauthority holding that the federal Constitution confers such\na right, and we see no basis for such a holding. The\nConstitution specifies the quality of representation that all\ncriminal defendants, including capital defendants, must\nreceive, namely, \"reasonably effective assistance.\"\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 687. The Constitution does not\nspecify the number of lawyers who must be appointed. If a\nsingle attorney provides reasonably effective assistance, the\nConstitution is satisfied, and if a whole team of lawyers\nfails to provide such assistance, the Constitution is\nviolated. Thus, there is no constitutional right per se to the\nappointment of co-counsel in a capital case. Bell v.\nWatkins, 692 F.2d 999, 1009 (5th Cir. 1982); Jimenez v.\nState, 703 So. 2d 437, 439 (Fla. 1997) (per curiam); State\nv. Phelps, 478 S.E.2d 563, 574-75 (W.Va. 1996) (per\ncuriam); State v. Rodriguez, 921 P.2d 643, 652 (Ariz. 1996);\nSpranger v. State, 650 N.E.2d 1117, 1122-23 (Ind. 1995);\nUptergrove v. State, 881 S.W.2d 529, 531 (Tex. Ct. App.\n1994). Cf. Hatch v. Oklahoma, 58 F.3d 1447, 1456 (10th\nCir. 1995).\n\nRiley's brief does not identify any unusual features of this\ncase that demanded the appointment of a second attorney.\nWhile he does cite the inexperience of his trial attorney,\nwithout a showing that this attorney did not provide the\nlevel of representation required by the Constitution, we\ncannot hold that the failure to appoint co-counsel to assist\nhim violated the Constitution.\n\nB. We must also reject Riley's argument that the failure\nto appoint a private investigator violated the Constitution.\nIn Caldwell v. Mississippi, 472 U.S. 320, 323 n.1 (1985),\nthe Supreme Court made it clear that there is no\nconstitutional right to the appointment of an investigator\nwhere the defendant offers \"little more than undeveloped\nassertions that the requested assistance would be\nbeneficial.\" See also Gray v. Thompson, 58 F.3d 59, 66-67\n(4th Cir. 1995), vacated on other grounds sub nom. Gray v.\nNetherland, 518 U.S. 152 (1996). Riley has offered nothing\nmore here.\n\n. . .\n\n                               64\n\fVIII.\n\nRiley contends that the trial judge contravened the\nholding of Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 510 (1968),\nwhen the judge dismissed two jurors for cause after they\nresponded to voir dire questions concerning capital\npunishment. In Witherspoon, the Supreme Court held that\nmembers of a jury panel may not be excused for cause\n\"simply because they voiced general objections to the death\npenalty or expressed conscientious or religious scruples\nagainst its infliction.\" Id. at 522. Some lower courts,\nhowever, interpreted footnotes in Witherspoon to mean that\npotential jurors could be dismissed only if they stated\nunambiguously that they would automatically vote against\nthe death penalty.5\n\nThe Supreme Court clarified the meaning of Witherspoon\nin Wainwright v. Witt, 469 U.S. 412 (1985). The Court held\nthat \"the proper standard for determining when a\nprospective juror may be excluded for cause because of his\nor her views on capital punishment . . . is whether the\njuror's views would `prevent or substantially impair the\nperformance of his duties as a juror in accordance with his\ninstructions and his oath.' \" Id. at 424 (quoting\nWitherspoon, 391 U.S. at 45). The Court noted:\n\n       [T]his standard . . . does not require that a juror's bias\n       be proved with `unmistakable clarity' . . . because\n       determinations of juror bias cannot be reduced to\n       question-and-answer sessions which obtain results in\n       the manner of a catechism. What common sense\n       should have realized experience has proved: many\n       veniremen simply cannot be asked enough questions to\n       reach the point where their bias has been made\n       \"unmistakably clear\"; these veniremen may not know\n       how they will react when faced with imposing the death\n       sentence, or may be unable to articulate, or may wish\n       to hide their true feelings. Despite this lack of clarity in\n       the printed record, however, there will be situations\n       where the trial judge is left with the definite impression\n       that a prospective juror would be unable to faithfully\n       and impartially apply the law.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5. See Wainwright v. Witt, 469 U.S. 412, 419 (1985).\n\n                               65\n\fId. at 424-26 (footnote omitted). The Court went on to hold\nthat a trial judge's finding under this standard is entitled to\nthe presumption of correctness in 28 U.S.C. S 2254(d).6 469\nU.S. at 428. Applying these standards, the Court sustained\nthe dismissal of a juror who said, when asked whether her\nbeliefs would interfere with her sitting as a juror in a\ncapital case, \"I am afraid it would\" and \"I think it would.\"\nId. at 416.\n\nThe two potential jurors at issue in the present case are\nMae Floyd and Gerald Mood. During Floyd's voir dire, the\nfollowing exchange occurred:\n\n        The Court: . . . Do you have any conscientious\n       scruples against finding a verdict of guilty where the\n       punishment might be death or against imposing the\n       death penalty if the evidence should so warrant?\n\n       Ms. Floyd: I would say yes, I think so.\n\n       The Court: You do have conscientious scruples?\n\n       Ms. Floyd: Yes.\n\n       The Court: Regardless of any personal beliefs or\n       feelings you have, if the evidence justified it, would you\n       be able to find a person guilty of murder in the first\n       degree and impose the death penalty?\n\n       Ms. Floyd: That is a hard one to tell you the truth.\n\n       The Court: I will repeat the question.\n\n       Ms. Floyd: I heard it. All right. Repeat the question.\n\n       The Court: I will repeat it. Regardless of your\n       personal belief or feelings, if the evidence justified it,\n       would you be able to find a person guilty of murder in\n       the first degree and would you be able to impose the\n       death penalty?\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6. See also Deputy v. Taylor, 19 F.3d 1485, 1498 (3d Cir. 1994) (citations\nomitted) (internal quotation marks omitted)(\"a trial court may excuse a\njuror for cause where such juror's views would prevent or substantially\nimpair the performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with his\ninstructions and his oath. . . . [and] that a state trial judge's finding\nthat\na prospective juror is impermissibly biased against the death penalty is\nentitled to a presumption of correctness under S 28 U.S.C.A. 2254(d).\").\n\n                               66\n\f       Ms. Floyd: That is a two-part question, right?\n\n       The Court: Yes, it is.\n\n       Ms. Floyd: The latter part--\n\n       The Court: First of all, would you be able to find a\n       person guilty of murder in the first degree?\n\n       Ms. Floyd: I may, yes.\n\n       The Court: And the second part is would you be\n       able to impose the death penalty?\n\n       Ms. Floyd: I tell you the truth I don't think so.\n\n       The Court: I will excuse you. Thank you very much.\n\nApp. 285-86 (emphasis added).\n\nAs both the Delaware Supreme Court and the District\nCourt observed, Floyd's responses were very similar to\nthose of the potential juror in question in Wainwright v.\nWitt, supra. See Riley I, 496 A.2d at 1005-06 Riley VI, 1998\nWL 172856, at *11. We agree with their analysis and hold\nthat Riley has not overcome the presumption of correctness\nthat attaches to the implicit finding of the trial judge.\n\nThe dismissal of the other potential juror in question,\nGerald Mood, took place after the following colloquy:\n\n       The Court: . . .   . Do you have any conscientious\n       scruples against   finding a verdict of guilty when the\n       punishment might   be death or against imposing the\n       death penalty if   the evidence should so warrant?\n\n       Mr. Mood: I don't know. I have mixed emotions about\n       that.\n\n       The Court: Regardless of any personal belief or\n       feelings that you have, if the evidence justified it, would\n       you be able to find a person guilty of murder in the\n       first degree and would you be able to impose the death\n       penalty?\n\n       Mr. Mood: Maybe I could. I don't really know.\n\n       The Court: I am going to excuse you sir . . . .\n\nApp. 276.\n\n                                 67\n\fThe District Judge aptly analyzed the dismissal of Mood,\nand we adopt his analysis:7\n\n       Unlike venireperson Floyd, venireperson Mood's\n       responses were much more succinct. Mood twice\n       responded to the trial court's capital punishment\n       questions with the phrase, \"I don't know.\" . .. .\n       Particularly in situations such as this, where an\n       individual's record response is so brief that its printed\n       reproduction reveals little, the Court should defer to\n       those credibility factors that would only have been\n       known to the trial court, such as the juror's demeanor,\n       tone of voice and attitude. See Witt, 469 U.S. at 434\n       (emphasizing importance of trial court's assessment of\n       venireperson's demeanor, particularly where printed\n       record may not be \"crystal clear\"). Accordingly, the\n       Court finds adequate record support for the trial\n       court's decision to excuse venireperson Mood.\n\nRiley VI, 1998 WL 172856, at *12.\n\nIX.\n\nRelying on Morgan v. Illinois, 504 U.S. 719 (1992), Riley\nargues that the trial judge erred in failing sua sponte to ask\nprospective jurors during voir dire whether they would\nautomatically impose the death penalty if they found him\nguilty. The District Court rejected this claim on the ground\nthat Morgan requires that such questions be asked only if\nthe defense so requests. We agree.\n\nIn Morgan, the Supreme Court framed the relevant issue\nin these terms: \"whether on voir dire the court must, on\ndefendant's request, inquire into the prospective jurors'\nviews on capital punishment.\" 504 U.S. at 726 (emphasis\nadded). The Court stated its holding as follows:\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n7. In addition, as the District Court noted, some of the answers given by\nFloyd and Mood to questions not concerning capital punishment may\nhave influenced the trial judge's decision to dismiss them. Floyd revealed\nthat she knew Tyrone Baxter and was a casual friend of Baxter's mother.\nMood said that he was a good friend of one of the police officers involved\nin the case and had served with him in the fire department. See Riley VI,\n1998 WL 172856, at *12.\n\n                               68\n\f       Petitioner was entitled, upon his request, to inquiry\n       discerning those jurors who, even prior to the State's\n       case in chief, had predetermined the terminating issue\n       of his trial, that being whether to impose the death\n       penalty.\n\nId. at 736 (emphasis added). The dissent described the\nCourt's holding in similar language: \"The Court today holds\nthat . . . the Constitution requires that voir dire directed to\n[reverse-Witherspoon] `bias' be provided upon the\ndefendant's request.\" Id. at 739 (Scalia, J., dissenting)\n(emphasis added).\n\nWe cannot regard the Court's choice of words as\naccidental, and we think that the holding of Morgan is\nclear: a reverse-Witherspoon inquiry must be made \"on\ndefendant's request.\" See United States v. Tipton, 90 F.3d\n861, 879 (4th Cir. 1996).\n\nRiley makes two arguments in response. First, he notes\nthat the state supreme court rejected his argument on the\nmerits, and he contends that \"the State should not now be\nheard to raise alleged procedural bars to federal court\nresolution of the claim on the merits.\" Appellant's Br. at 52.\nOur holding, however, has nothing to do with a procedural\nbar, i.e., a state rule of procedure that bars a federal\nhabeas court from reaching the merits of a federal claim.\nRather, our holding is based on the fact that the\nconstitutional right recognized in Morgan applies only if the\ndefense makes a request for a reverse-Witherspoon inquiry.\n\nSecond, Riley argues that his trial attorney was\nineffective in failing to request reverse-Witherspoon\nquestioning. However, this argument was not made in the\nstate courts, and it is thus procedurally barred.\n\nX.\n\nUnder 11 Del. C. S 4209(g)(2), the Delaware Supreme\nCourt is required to undertake a proportionality review in\ndeath penalty cases. The statute mandates that the Court\ninquire into whether \"the death penalty was either\narbitrarily or capriciously imposed or recommended, or\ndisproportionate to the penalty recommended or imposed in\n\n                                69\n\fsimilar cases.\" 11 Del. C. S 4209(g)(2)(a). In affirming Riley's\ndeath sentence, the Delaware Supreme Court examined 21\ncases, including five in which the death penalty was\nimposed. It found that Riley's case was comparable to the\nfive death penalty cases (Whalen, Rush, Deputy, Flamer\nand Bailey), because they all involved\n\n       an unprovoked, cold-blooded murder of a helpless\n       person (or persons) committed upon victims lacking the\n       ability to defend themselves and solely for the purposes\n       of pecuniary gain (except in Whalen's case). In none of\n       these killings is there any evidence of provocation or of\n       homicide committed out of passion or rage. In each\n       case, except Whalen, the murder occurred in the court\n       of a robbery that was deliberately planned and carried\n       out with the use of deadly weapons. In each case, the\n       perpetrators of these crimes offered no extenuating\n       circumstance for taking the life of another.\n\nRiley I, 496 A.2d at 1027.\n\nRiley challenges this finding on two grounds. First, he\npoints to the fact that two of the death sentences relied on\n-- Rush and Whalen -- had been vacated. Second, he\nargues that the remaining cases -- Deputy, Bailey, and\nFlamer -- do not furnish appropriate comparisons because\neach involved the killing of more than one person. He\nmaintains that these errors violated the Eighth and\nFourteenth Amendments.\n\nIt is clear that proportionality review is not required by\nthe federal Constitution. See Pulley v. Harris , 465 U.S. 37,\n50-51 (1984). Riley justifies advancing his proportionality\nargument in federal court on two grounds.8 First, he argues\nthat the allegedly improper review resulted in a punishment\nthat was \"inherently disproportionate and, therefore,\narbitrary and capricious\" in violation of the Eighth\nAmendment. Appellant's Br. at 56. Second, he argues that\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n8. Ordinarily, federal habeas relief is not available for an error of\nstate\nlaw: the habeas statute provides that a writ disturbing a state court\njudgment may issue only if a prisoner is in custody\"in violation of the\nConstitution or laws or treaties of the United States.\" 28 U.S.C.\nS 2241(c)(3). See Pulley v. Harris, 465 U.S. 37, 41 (1984).\n\n                               70\n\fDelaware's failure to abide by its own statutory scheme for\nproportionality review violated due process. See Fetterly v.\nPaskett, 997 F.2d 1295, 1300 (9th Cir. 1993) (\"the failure\nof a state to abide by its own statutory commands may\nimplicate a liberty interest protected by the Fourteenth\nAmendment against arbitrary deprivation by a state\").\n\nRiley bases his first argument on the principle that\"[i]f a\nState has determined that death should be an available\npenalty for certain crimes, then it must administer the\npenalty in a way that can rationally distinguish between\nthose individuals for whom death is an appropriate\nsanction and those for whom it is not.\" Spaziano v. Florida,\n468 U.S. 447, 460 (1984). Riley claims that the\nproportionality review conducted by the Delaware Supreme\nCourt in his case failed to protect him from arbitrary\nimposition of the death penalty, and in fact upheld a\ndisproportionate punishment. This argument rests on the\npremise that applying the death penalty in Riley's case\nwould be so disproportionate as to constitute cruel and\nunusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment.\nTherefore, Riley's argument really attacks the imposition of\nthe penalty itself, rather than the state's method of\nreviewing proportionality.\n\nRiley's argument is not tenable. The Supreme Court has\n\"occasionally struck down punishments as inherently\ndisproportionate, and therefore cruel and unusual, when\nimposed for a particular crime or category of crime.\" Pulley,\n465 U.S. at 43. However, in this case, Riley's crime--\nkilling a defenseless person without provocation in the\ncourse of an armed robbery -- is not such that application\nof the death penalty in these circumstances would\"shock\nthe conscience.\" See Lindsey v. Smith, 820 F.2d 1137, 1154\n(11th Cir. 1987); Spinkellink v. Wainwright, 578 F.2d 582,\n606 n.28 (5th Cir. 1976). Riley has thus failed to show an\nEighth Amendment violation.\n\nRiley's second argument is based on the principle that\nwhen a state creates a right, the Due Process clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment entitles a defendant to procedures\nto ensure that the right is not arbitrarily denied. He argues\nthat the Delaware Supreme Court, by failing to conduct an\n\n                               71\n\fadequate proportionality review as required by state\nstatute, denied him due process.\n\nAs a threshold matter, it is unclear whether, under Third\nCircuit law, a state proportionality-review statute creates\nany cognizable liberty interest for due process purposes.\nSee Frey v. Fulcomer, 132 F.3d 916, 925 n.7 (3d Cir. 1997)\n(noting that Supreme Court precedent on this issue is in\nflux). We need not address this question, however, because\neven if Riley has such a liberty interest, he has not shown\nany denial of due process. In evaluating a claim that a state\ncourt erred in conducting its proportionality review, a\nfederal court may only inquire into whether the state court\n\"undertook its proportionality review in good faith and\nfound that [the defendant's] sentence was proportional to\nthe sentences imposed in cases similar to his.\" Walton v.\nArizona, 497 U.S. 639, 656 (1990). Because there is no\nfederal constitutional right to proportionality review, if the\nfederal court finds that the review was undertaken in good\nfaith, it cannot \"look behind\" the state court's conclusion of\nproportionality to consider whether the state court\nmisapplied state proportionality law. See id.; Bannister v.\nDelo, 100 F.3d 610, 627 (8th Cir. 1996). In this case, the\nDelaware Supreme Court compared Riley's case with a\nsubstantial number of other death-eligible cases, and, even\ndisregarding the two vacated death sentences, it found\ncommon characteristics between Riley's case and three\nother cases in which the sentence was not vacated.\nAlthough Riley argues that these cases are not entirely\nanalogous, because each contained an additional\naggravating factor (more than one victim), there is no\nindication that the Delaware court acted in bad faith in\nconducting its review. We are thus without power to order\nhabeas relief.\n\nXI.\n\nWe now turn to Riley's contentions concerning jury\ninstructions given by the trial judge at the sentencing\nphase.\n\nA.\n\nRiley argues that the jury instructions at the penalty\nphase impermissibly restricted the jury's consideration of\n\n                                72\n\fmitigating circumstances. He takes issue with the following\ninstruction, issued at the start of the penalty hearing:\n\n       A sentence of death shall not be imposed unless the\n       jury finds:\n\n       (1) Beyond a reasonable doubt at least one statutory\n       aggravating circumstance; and\n\n       (2) Unanimously recommends, after weighing all\n       relevant evidence in aggravation or mitigation\n       which bears upon the particular circumstances or\n       details of the commission of the offense and the\n       character and propensities of the offender, that a\n       sentence of death shall be imposed. Where the\n       jury submits such a finding and recommendation,\n       the Court shall sentence the defendant to death. A\n       finding by the jury of a statutory aggravating\n       circumstance, and a consequent recommendation of\n       death, supported by the evidence, shall be binding\n       on the Court.\n\nApp. 392 (emphasis added). Riley contends that, given the\nplacement of the word \"consequent,\" \"a reasonable jury\ncould understand the underscored sentence to mean that\nthe effect of a finding that a statutory aggravating\ncircumstance existed, is that the death penalty must be\nimposed.\" Appellant's Br. 59. Because the trial judge had\npreviously informed the jury that the statutory aggravating\ncircumstance -- commission of the murder during a\nrobbery -- had already been proven beyond a reasonable\ndoubt in the guilt phase, Riley argues that a reasonable\njury could have read the instruction to mean that it need\nnot consider mitigation evidence.\n\nWhen reviewing a jury instruction that is claimed to\nimpermissibly restrict a jury's consideration of relevant\nevidence, a court must ask \"whether there is a reasonable\nlikelihood that the jury has applied the challenged\ninstruction in a way that prevents the consideration of\nconstitutionally relevant evidence.\" Boyde v. California, 494\nU.S. 370, 380 (1990). If there is \"only a possibility\" of such\ninhibition, however, the challenge must fail. Id . Moreover,\nthe challenged instructions \"must be evaluated not in\n\n                               73\n\fisolation but in the context of the entire charge.\" Jones v.\nUnited States, 527 U.S. 373, 391 (1999).\n\nWhen the jury charge is read as a whole, there is no\nreasonable likelihood that a jury could have understood it\nto preclude consideration of mitigating circumstances. At\nthe close of the penalty hearing, the court again instructed\nthe jury in terms that cleared up any ambiguity that might\nhave been present in its earlier instruction:\n\n       In conclusion, a sentence of death shall not be imposed\n       unless you, the jury, find:\n\n       (1) Beyond a reasonable doubt at least one statutory\n       aggravating circumstance has been established;\n       and\n\n       (2) Unanimously recommend that a sentence of death\n       be imposed after weighing all relevant evidence in\n       aggravation and mitigation which bear upon the\n       particular circumstances and details of the\n       commission of the offense and the character and\n       propensities of the offender.\n\n       Should you fail to agree unanimously to either of these\n       two matters, the Court shall sentence the defendant to\n       life imprisonment without benefit of probation or\n       parole.\n\nApp. 438-40 (emphasis added).\n\nThis instruction made it clear that a jury was required\nboth to find at least one statutory aggravator and to weigh\naggravating factors against mitigating factors in order to\nsupport a death sentence. This belies Riley's argument that\nthe jury was misled into believing that its job was done\nonce the felony murder aggravator was found.\n\nB.\n\nRiley next takes issue with the trial court's failure at the\npenalty phase to instruct the jury that it was required to\nconclude unanimously that aggravating circumstances\noutweigh mitigating circumstances before imposing death,\nas required by Delaware law. See Whalen v. State , 492 A.2d\n552, 560 (Del. 1985) (setting forth \"outweighing\" standard).\n\n                                74\n\fRather, the court simply instructed the jury that it had to\n\"[u]nanimously recommend that a sentence of death be\nimposed after weighing all relevant evidence in aggravation\nand mitigation.\" App. 438; see also App. 392, 437.\n\nThis argument provides no grounds for habeas relief. The\nfederal Constitution does not require \"specific standards for\nbalancing aggravating against mitigating circumstances.\"\nZant v. Stephens, 462 U.S. 862, 876 n.13 (1983). As long as\na jury is permitted to consider all relevant mitigating\ncircumstances in making its death recommendation, there\nis no federal constitutional problem. In addition, Riley has\nnot suggested how a jury's decision would be any different\nunder the language the court used in this case. Because\nthe jury was instructed not to make a sentencing\nrecommendation until after it had \"weigh[ed] all relevant\nevidence in aggravation and mitigation,\" the necessary\ninference was that the death penalty should be imposed\nonly if aggravating factors outweighed mitigating factors\n(otherwise, the entire \"weighing\" process would be\nmeaningless).\n\nC.\n\nFinally, Riley argues that the penalty phase instructions\nimproperly suggested that the jury had to be unanimous in\nimposing a life sentence, in violation of Whalen v. State,\n492 A.2d 552, 562 (Del. 1985). He points to the instruction\nthat \"[i]f you are not unanimous in your recommendation to\nimpose the death penalty, or you cannot agree unanimously\nas to your recommendation, then the Court is bound to\nimpose a sentence of life.\" App. 438 (emphasis added). The\nword \"recommendation\" in the underlined phrase, he\nsuggests, could be read to refer to a life sentence\nrecommendation as well as to a recommendation of death.\n\nAs a threshold issue, the government argues that Riley\nfailed to raise this issue before the District Court because\nhe based his argument there \"solely on the interpretation of\nthe interrogatories posed to the jury\" rather than on the\njury instruction he points to here. Appellee's Br. at 75.\nHowever, Riley, although pointing specifically to the\ninterrogatories to support his point, nevertheless raised the\n\n                               75\n\fgeneral argument in his amended petition that \"the\ninstructions were likely to confuse the jury about whether\nthe verdict must be unanimous.\" App. 1191. This is\nsufficient to preserve his argument before this Court.\n\nOn the merits, however, Riley's claim must fail. First,\nwhen the jury charge is viewed as a whole, it reveals several\ninstances in which the word \"unanimous\" was explicitly\npaired solely with the death recommendation. In light of\nthis pattern, it appears unlikely that the jury would have\nviewed the isolated passage that Riley relies on as\nextending the unanimity requirement to a recommendation\nof life imprisonment. Second, the Delaware Supreme Court,\nin reviewing this allegation, stated that it was\"satisfied that\nthe jury understood that, in the event of its failure to\nunanimously agree upon imposition of a death penalty, an\nimposition of life imprisonment would result.\" Riley V, 585\nA.2d at 725. Because the instruction made clear that the\ndefault rule in case of a lack of unanimity was life\nimprisonment, it is hard to see how the jury's deliberations\nwould have been affected even had it adopted Riley's\ninterpretation of the instruction. Finally, the challenged\ninstruction was identical to one approved by the Delaware\nSupreme Court in Flamer v. State, 490 A.2d 104 (Del.\n1984), aff 'd sub nom. Flamer v. Delaware, 68 F.3d 710 (3d\nCir. 1995) and Flamer v. Delaware, 68 F.2d 736 (3d Cir.\n1995) (en banc). The Delaware Supreme Court explicitly\npointed to the similarities with Flamer, and distinguished\nthe instructions from those in Whalen, in upholding the\ndeath sentence on direct appeal. See Riley, 585 A.2d at\n722-25. For these reasons, we reject Riley's claim.\n\nXII.\n\nRiley was convicted of intentional murder and felony\nmurder, with the underlying felony being first-degree\nrobbery. The statutory aggravating circumstance relied on\nfor the death sentence was that the murder was committed\nwhile Riley was engaged in the commission of first degree\nrobbery. See 11 Del. C. S 4209(e)(1)(j) (establishing felony\nmurder aggravator). Riley argues that it is unconstitutional\nto double-count robbery as both an element of the crime\n\n                                76\n\f(felony murder) that made Riley death-eligible and as a\nstatutory aggravating circumstance.\n\nThis Court rejected precisely the same claim in Deputy v.\nTaylor, 19 F.3d 1485,1502 (3d Cir. 1994), holding that\n\"within the context of Delaware's death penalty statute, the\nprovision requiring the double-counting of the felony at the\nguilty phase and sentencing phase does not impermissibly\nweaken the statute's constitutionally mandated narrowing\nfunction.\" This precedent binds our panel.\n\nXIII.\n\nRiley's final argument is that the District Court erred in\ndenying his motion for funds for investigative and expert\nassistance and in refusing to conduct an evidentiary\nhearing. We disagree.\n\nA.\n\nUnder 18 U.S.C. S 3006A(e) and 21 U.S.C. S 848(q)(4)(B)\nand (9), Riley was entitled to investigative and expert\nassistance upon a finding that such assistance was\n\"necessary\" or \"reasonably necessary\" with respect to his\nrepresentation in the habeas proceeding. Riley sought the\nservices of an investigator to gather additional evidence\nconcerning his childhood experiences. He sought the\nservices of a forensic psychiatrist to develop further\nmitigating evidence concerning his mental problems. All of\nthese services were requested in order to support Riley's\narguments that his trial attorney was ineffective at the\npenalty phase and that the trial judge should have\nappointed a co-counsel and investigator to assist him.\n\nRiley has not shown that the services in question were\n\"necessary\" or \"reasonably necessary.\" The discovery at the\ntime of the federal habeas proceeding of new evidence about\nRiley's childhood would not have shown that the efforts of\nRiley's trial attorney to locate family members who might\nhave testified about such matters were objectively\nunreasonable. See pages 38-41, supra. Nor would the\ndiscovery of such evidence have demonstrated that it was\nstrategically unreasonable for Riley's trial attorney to\n\n                                77\n\feschew a penalty-phase defense based on Riley's\"social\nhistory.\" See id. Similarly, the development of additional\nevidence regarding Riley's mental condition at the time of\nthe federal habeas proceeding would not have shown that\nRiley's trial attorney was objectively unreasonable in not\nseeking a mental examination prior to the penalty. See\npages 41-43, supra.\n\nB.\n\n\"Where the District Court denies the petition for a writ of\nhabeas corpus in the absence of an evidentiary hearing,\" we\nask, first, \"whether the petitioner asserts facts which entitle\nhim to relief \" and, second, \"whether an evidentiary hearing\nis needed.\" Todaro v. Fulcomer, 944 F.2d 1079, 1082 (3d\nCir. 1991). See also Heiser v. Ryan, 951 F.2d 559, 561 (3d\nCir. 1991). Riley argues that the District Court should have\nheld an evidentiary hearing concerning the prosecution's\nperemptory challenges, the impartiality of the jury, his\nBrady claim, and other unspecified issues. We disagree. As\npreviously discussed, we are required to accept the state\ncourts' findings regarding the peremptory challenges and\nthe impartiality of the jury, and those findings are\ndispositive. Thus, an evidentiary hearing in federal court on\nthose matters was not needed. In addition, in light of the\nrevelation after briefing that no conversation in which\nBaxter participated is listed in the logs of the wiretap on\nMrs. Baxter's telephone, it is clear that there was no need\nfor an evidentiary hearing concerning Riley's Brady claim.\nNor do we believe that the District Court was an evidentiary\nhearing was needed on any other matter.\n\n                                78\n\fBECKER, Chief Judge, Concurring in the Judgment.\n\nThis en banc appeal ultimately turns on the petitioner's\nBatson claim. Unfortunately, I find myself unable to join in\neither Judge Sloviter's or Judge Alito's opinion on that issue.1\n\nFirst, I cannot agree with Judge Sloviter's treatment of\nthe prosecution's challenge to prospective juror Nichols.\nRather, I agree with Judge Alito's opinion on this issue, see\nDis. Op. at 83-91, largely because I do not share Judge\nSloviter's skepticism of the prosecutor's testimony as to\nNichols's \"significant pause.\" Human memory can be quite\npowerful, and I think it entirely possible that this\n\"significant pause\" became indelibly etched in the\nprosecutor's mind. As explicated by the dissent, the hearing\njudge determined that the prosecutor's testimony on this\nmatter was credible, and I cannot agree that the race-\nneutral reason proffered for striking Nichols was\"not fairly\nsupported by the record.\" 28 U.S.C. S 2254(d)(8) (1988).\n\nOn the other hand, while the point is quite close, I\ncannot bring myself to join Judge Alito's discussion of the\nchallenge to prospective juror McGuire. Unlike the\nchallenge to Nichols, an action for which the prosecutor\nrelied on his memory to articulate a race-neutral\nexplanation, the prosecutor had no recollection whatsoever\nabout the differences between McGuire and Reed. I\ntherefore agree with Judge Sloviter that there is no basis in\nthe record for distinguishing McGuire, a prospective black\njuror who was struck, from Reed, a white man who was not\nstruck and who ultimately served on the jury. While ideally\nthis issue would be developed further at a federal habeas\nhearing, I reluctantly conclude, again agreeing with Judge\nSloviter, that no purpose would be served by having such\na hearing at this late date. Accordingly, I will join in the\njudgment accompanying her opinion.\n\nWhile I might end at this point, I am impelled to\ncomment on the statistical evidence by reason of the\nprominent discussion of the issue in the Sloviter and Alito\nopinions, and the fact that Judge Alito's dissent identifies\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. I do, however, join in Part II of Judge Alito's opinion, dealing with\nthe\nCaldwell issue.\n\n                               79\n\fsignificant problems with Judge Sloviter's discussion of that\nevidence. I feel myself unable to join in Judge Alito's\nopinion on that facet of the case for he has not allayed my\nconcern about the practices of the Kent County\nprosecutor's office at times relevant here. Specifically, the\nabsence of black jurors on four juries in a county that was\n18% black and had a jury venire that was 9% black\nremains troubling. As the Supreme Court has observed in\nother contexts when presented with perhaps imperfect\nstatistical data, \"[F]ine tuning of the statistics could not\nhave obscured the glaring absence of minoriti[ies]. . . . [T]he\n. . . inability to rebut the inference of discrimination came\nnot from a misuse of statistics, but from the inexorable\nzero.\" Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324,\n342 n.23 (1977) (internal quotations omitted).\n\nThis concern is exacerbated for me by the State's failure\nto submit rebuttal evidence. If Riley's data was too weak to\nsupport an inference of discrimination in the face of the\nprosecutor's race-neutral explanations, there was no\nburden on the government to submit rebuttal data.\nHowever, as Judge Sloviter's discussion of the chronology of\nevents makes clear, the State volunteered to provide\nrebuttal data, and then failed to do so. See Op. of the Court\nat 38. If the hearing judge had acknowledged the State's\nfailure to provide evidence notwithstanding its promise and\nthen specifically said that he did not consider this failure to\nbe sufficiently probative to overcome the credibility\ndetermination, his factual conclusion would be fait\naccompli. But the fact that the hearing judge did not\nmention the State's failure to provide evidence, in the wake\nof the \"volunteering,\" sticks out like a sore thumb, and\nrenders it doubtful for me that the \"record as a whole\"\nsupports the hearing judge's conclusion.\n\nJudge Sloviter seems to concede that a federal habeas\nhearing would give Riley ample time to conduct an expert\nstatistical analysis of the complete record, time which he\nlacked at the earlier hearing, as she explains, because of\nthe State's late decision not to submit any statistical\nevidence. See Op. of the Court at 38. Were the statistical\nevidence dispositive of Riley's Batson claim, I would remand\nfor a federal habeas hearing. Judge Sloviter, however,\n\n                               80\n\fstates that the statistical evidence is \"relevant but not\ndispositive to our decision.\" Op. of the Court at 40. Because\nI accept her representation on this matter, I do not press\nthe issue further, and simply join in the judgment\naccompanying her opinion.2\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. I note that, even if I did not agree with Judge Sloviter on the juror\nMcGuire issue, the judgment accompanying her opinion is plainly closer\nto my own position than the views of Judge Alito. Under these\ncircumstances, I would vote with her anyhow to avoid a stalemate. See\nScrews v. United States, 325 U.S. 91, 134 (1945) (Rutledge, J.,\nconcurring); see also Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 607-08 (1999)\n(Stevens, J., concurring); Bragdon v. Abbott, 524 U.S. 624, 656 (1998)\n(Stevens, J., concurring); AUSA Life Ins. Co. v. Ernst & Young, 206 F.3d\n202, 225 (2d Cir. 2000) (Jacobs, J., concurring).\n\n\n                               81\n\fALITO, Circuit Judge, with whom Judges SCIRICA, BARRY,\nFUENTES and STAPLETON join as to Part I, and with\nwhom Chief Judge BECKER, and Judges BARRY, and\nSTAPLETON join as to Part II, dissenting:\n\nThis is a troubling case, but after considering all of the\npetitioner's arguments and applying the standard of review\nprescribed by the federal habeas statute, I see no ground\nfor reversing the decision of the district court. The majority\nholds that the petitioner's rights under Batson v. Kentucky,\n476 U.S. 79 (1986), were violated, but I do not believe that\nthere is a proper basis for disturbing the credibility findings\nmade by the conscientious state judge. The majority also\nholds that comments made by the prosecutor in closing\nargument at the penalty phase of the trial violated Caldwell\nv. Mississippi, 472 U.S. 320 (1985), but in my view the\nmajority misinterprets that decision as in effect embodying\na per se prohibition against any mention of the availability\nof appellate review of a death sentence, a procedure of\nwhich virtually all jurors are surely aware. Because I\ncannot agree with the majority's analysis of either of these\nissues, I must respectfully dissent.\n\nI.\n\nA.\n\nI turn first to the argument that the prosecution violated\nBatson by using peremptory challenges to strike three\nAfrican Americans from the jury panel. In Batson , the\nSupreme Court held that it is a violation of the Equal\nProtection Clause for a prosecutor to strike a juror because\nof race. The Court also set out a three-step process for\nadjudicating a claim that a particular peremptory was\nracially based.\n\n       [O]nce the opponent of a peremptory challenge has\n       made out a prima facie case of racial discrimination\n       (step one), the burden of production shifts to the\n       proponent of the strike to come forward with a race-\n       neutral explanation (step two). If a race-neutral\n       explanation is tendered, the trial court must then\n       decide (step three) whether the opponent of the strike\n\n                               82\n\f       has proved purposeful racial discrimination. Hernandez\n       v. New York, 500 U.S. 352, 358-359 (1991)(plurality\n       opinion); id., at 375 (O'CONNOR, J., concurring in\n       judgment); Batson, [476 U.S.] at 96-98.\n\nPurkett v. Elem, 514 U.S. 765, 767 (1995)(per curiam).\n\nIn this case, the Superior Court found that the petitioner,\nWilliam Riley, made out a prima facie case, see Riley v.\nState, No. 200, 1988 (Super. Ct. April 21, 1989) at 2, and\nthe state does not dispute this point. The state offered race-\nneutral justifications for its contested strikes, and the state\ncourts accepted those explanations and found that the\ndisputed peremptories were not racially based. Id. at 3-6;\nRiley v. State, 585 A.2d 719, 725 (Del. Sup. Ct. 1990). The\nmajority however, rejects the state courts' findings\nregarding two of the state's peremptories and substitutes\nits own contrary findings. I will discuss each of the\nchallenges on which the majority relies.1\n\nB: Ray Nichols\n\n1. The prosecutor testified that he struck Nichols\nbecause he was uncertain that Nichols would be able to\nvote for a death sentence. See App. 797-99. According to\nthe prosecutor's testimony, \"there was a pause and a\nsignificant pause in [his] answering [the trial judge's]\ninquiry and that to me was enough to suggest that he\nmight not be able to return a death penalty.\" Id. Having\nheard the prosecutor's testimony, the judge who presided\nover the Batson hearing [hereinafter\"the hearing judge\"],\nconcluded: \"I find the State provided a credible, race-\nneutral reason for exercising its peremptory challenge after\nappraising the demeanor and credibility of the juror. The\nState's exercise of its peremptory challenge was non-\ndiscriminatory. I am satisfied that the peremptory challenge\nwas not made on the ground of the juror's race.\" Id. at 889.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. Riley also contends that a third member of the venire, Lois Beecher,\nwas peremptorily challenged by the state because of race. The majority,\nhowever, does not rely on this strike, and accordingly I do not discuss\nit in this opinion.\n\n                               83\n\fRiley suggests that it is not believable that the prosecutor\nwas able to remember at the time of the evidentiary hearing\nin 1988 that Nichols had paused while answering a\nquestion during voir dire six years earlier. In addition, Riley\ncontrasts the prosecutor's ability to remember this pause\nwith his inability to remember another potentially\nsignificant aspect of the jury selection process, and Riley\nnotes that the prosecutor was a friend and neighbor of the\nvictim. These facts were highlighted during the cross-\nexamination of the prosecutor at the Batson hearing, see\nApp. 820-29, and I agree that they were important factors\nto be considered in assessing the prosecutor's credibility.\nThe hearing judge was aware of these facts and had the\nopportunity to observe the prosecutor testify on the witness\nstand. Despite these facts, however, the hearing judge\nfound that the prosecutor's testimony was credible.\n\nOur standard of review of the hearing judge's finding is\nnarrow. In Batson, the Supreme Court took pains to note\nthat \"[s]ince the trial judge's findings in the context under\nconsideration here will largely turn on evaluation of\ncredibility, a reviewing court ordinarily should give those\nfindings great deference.\" Batson, 476 U.S. at 98 n.21. In a\nlater case applying Batson, the plurality elaborated:\n\n       In the typical peremptory challenge inquiry, the\n       decisive question will be whether counsel's race-neutral\n       explanation for a peremptory challenge should be\n       believed. There will seldom be much evidence bearing\n       on that issue, and the best evidence often will be the\n       demeanor of the attorney who exercised the challenge.\n       . . . [E]valuation of the prosecutor's state of mind based\n       on demeanor and credibility lies `peculiarly within a\n       trial judge's province.'\n\nHernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352, 353 (1991) (pluralty)\n(citation omitted).\n\nBecause the present case is a proceeding under the\nfederal habeas statute, our scope of review is, if anything,\neven narrower. Under 28 U.S.C. S2254(d)(8)(1988 & Supp.\n1990), any state-court factual finding that is \"fairly\nsupported by the record\" is entitled to a presumption of\ncorrectness. Discussing this provision, the Supreme Court\n\n                                84\n\fwrote in Marshall v. Lonberger, 459 U.S. 422, 434 (1983),\nthat \"28 U.S.C. S 2254(d) gives federal habeas courts no\nlicense to redetermine credibility of witnesses whose\ndemeanor has been observed by the state trial court, but\nnot by them.\" Accord, Rushen v. Spain, 464 U.S. 114, 122\nn.6 (1983)(per curiam). The Marshall Court elaborated:\n\n       In United States v. Oregon Medical Society, 343 U.S.\n       326 (1952), commenting on the deference which this\n       Court gave to the findings of a District Court on direct\n       appeal from a judgment in a bench trial, we stated:\n\n       \"As was aptly stated by the New York Court of\n       Appeals, although in a case of a rather different\n       substantive nature: `Face to face with living\n       witnesses the original trier of the facts holds a\n       position of advantage from which appellate judges\n       are excluded. In doubtful cases the exercise of his\n       power of observation often proves the most\n       accurate method of ascertaining the truth. . . . How\n       can we say the judge is wrong? We never saw the\n       witnesses. . . . To the sophistication and sagacity of\n       the trial judge the law confides the duty of\n       appraisal.' Boyd v. Boyd, 252 N.Y. 422, 429,169\n       N.E. 632.\" Id., at 339.\n\n       We greatly doubt that Congress, when it used the\n       language \"fairly supported by the record\" considered\n       \"as a whole\" intended to authorize broader federal\n       review of state court credibility determinations than are\n       authorized in appeals within the federal system itself.\n\n459 U.S. at 434. See also Purkett, 514 U.S. at 769.\n\nUnder the very limited scope of review that applies here,\nI do not see how the hearing judge's finding that the\nprosecutor testified truthfully regarding the reason for\nchallenging Nichols can be overturned. The hearing judge\nheard the prosecutor testify. He was aware of the factors\nnoted above that provided grounds for doubting his\ntestimony, but he nevertheless found that the prosecutor\nwas truthful. I would sustain that finding.\n\n2. The majority rejects that finding (as well as the state\ncourts' finding with respect to another prospective juror\n\n                                85\n\fwhom I discuss below) in large part because, in the\nmajority's view, \"there is no basis to determine if the state\ncourts undertook, or even were aware of, the required\nBatson step three inquiry.\" Maj. Op. at 36. In making this\nargument, the majority (a) misunderstands what Batson\nrequires, (b) ignores what the Delaware courts did in this\ncase, (c) imposes novel and unwarranted procedural\nrequirements on the state courts, and (d) awards relief that\nextends beyond what its own logic warrants.\n\nWhat step three of Batson requires. Although the majority\nmakes step three seem elaborate and elusive -- so elusive\nthat, according to the majority, the Delaware courts may\nnot have \"fully appreciated the requirement\" (Maj. Op. at\n32) -- step three, is neither conceptually difficult nor\nprocedurally complicated. Step three simply requires the\njudge to make a finding of fact -- \"to determine if the\ndefendant has established purposeful discrimination,\"\nBatson, 476 U.S. at 98 (footnote omitted). See also Purkett,\n514 U.S. at 767; Hernandez, 500 U.S. at 358-59 (plurality\nopinion); id. at 375 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment).\nNeither Batson nor any subsequent Supreme Court or\nThird Circuit case has added to this requirement.\n\nWhat the Delaware courts did. The Delaware courts did\nexactly what step three requires. With respect to potential\njuror Nichols, the hearing judge, whose analysis the state\nsupreme court endorsed, see 585 A.2d at 725, noted that\nthe state had provided a race-neutral reason for the\nchallenge, stated that he found the explanation credible,\nand concluded: \"I am satisfied that the peremptory\nchallenge was not made on the ground of the juror's\nrace.\"2 This is precisely the finding that step three of\nBatson mandates. See Batson, 476 U.S. at 98 (the court\nhas \"the duty to determine if the defendant has established\npurposeful discrimination\").\n\nWhat the majority requires. Although the majority opinion\nis loathe to admit it, what the majority really finds wanting\nin the opinions of the Delaware courts is not a failure to\nmake the finding mandated by step three of the Batson\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. The state courts' findings regarding the other potential juror at\nissue,\nCharles McGuire, are discussed below. See infra at 91-93.\n\n                               86\n\finquiry but a failure to comment on the record regarding\nevidence that seems, in the majority's view, to undermine\nthe prosecution's proffered explanations for the disputed\nperemptories. See Maj. Op. at 29 (\"the state courts in this\ncase rejected Riley's Batson claim without discussing any of\nthe ample evidence that throws into question the\nexplanations offered by the prosecutor for striking two of\nthe black jurors . . . .\").3 This approach is inconsistent with\nthe federal habeas statute and Supreme Court precedent.\n\nThe provision of the federal habeas statute on which the\nmajority relies provides that if a state court's\n\"determination after a hearing on the merits of a factual\nissue\" is \"evidenced by a written finding, written opinion, or\nother reliable and adequate written indicia,\" that\ndetermination \"shall be presumed to be correct\" unless it is\nnot \"fairly supported by the record\" as a whole. 28 U.S.C.\nS2254(d)(8)(1988 & Supp. 1990)(amended 1996). Under this\nprovision, the state court's factual determination must\nsimply be evidenced by \"a written finding, written opinion,\nor other reliable and adequate written indicia,\" and it is not\neven necessary that a state court \"specifically articulate its\ncredibility findings.\" LaVallee v. Delle Rose , 410 U.S. 690,\n692 (1973). See also Marshall v. Lonberger, 459 U.S. at\n433. Thus, 28 U.S.C. S 2254(d) plainly does not authorize\nus to disregard a state court's factual finding on the ground\nthat the state court failed to discuss all the evidence or to\nexplain why it was not persuaded by a particular piece of\nproof.\n\nI do not question that a judge, in making the factual\nfinding required by step three of Batson, should consider all\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. See, e.g., Maj Op. at 18 (\"With regard to both Nichols and McGuire,\nthe state courts failed to mention in their opinions the weaknesses in the\nState's explanations . . . .\"); id. at 20 (\"[T]he hearing judge discussed\nneither the statistics nor the State's failure to explain them[,] . . .\noverlooking and ignoring a significant segment of Riley's evidence . . .\n.\");\nid. at 21 (hearing judge made no \"reference to, or analysis of, Riley's\nevidence of pretext\"); id. at 28 (\"Here, the state courts failed to\nexamine\nall of the evidence to determine whether the State's proffered race-\nneutral explanations were pretextual. Not only is there no indication on\nthe record that the hearing judge engaged in the required analysis, but\nthere is no indication that the Delaware Supreme Court did so.\").\n\n                               87\n\fof the relevant evidence that has been adduced. But neither\nBatson nor any later Supreme Court or Third Circuit case4\nsuggests that a federal habeas court is free to reject the\nfactual findings of a state court if the state court does not\ncomment on all of the evidence or provide what the federal\ncourt regards as a satisfactory explanation for its finding.5\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4. The only Third Circuit case cited in this connection by the majority\n(see Maj. Op. at 35) is Jones v. Ryan, 987 F.2d 960 (1993). Jones,\nhowever, was very different from the present case (see footnote nine,\ninfra) and does not support the proposition that a finding of a state\ncourt\nis not entitled to the presumption of correctness if the state court did\nnot\nexplain why the court was not persuaded by particular items of evidence.\n\n5. Nor does the majority cite much other authority to support its\nposition. See Maj. Op. at 28, 30, 34, 35. The majority (at 28) quotes\ndictum in a footnote in United States v. McMillon, 14 F.3d 948, 953 n.4\n(4th Cir. 1994)(emphasis added), to the effect that at step three of\nBatson\n\"the court then addresses and evaluates all evidence introduced by each\nside.\" The reasons for not attaching too much weight to one word\n(\"addresses\") in this statement are too obvious to require mention.\n\nThe majority cites two federal habeas cases in which courts of appeals\nfound great fault with the procedures used by state judges in\nadjudicating Batson objections. In Jordan v. LeFevre, 206 F.3d 196 (2d\nCir. 2000), the court of appeals held that the trial judge \"could not\nproperly decide the third Batson step\" because he \"resisted counsel's\nefforts to make arguments regarding the peremptory strikes so as to\ncreate a full record\" and instead \"ruled summarily\" after \"an extremely\nbrief colloquy.\" Id. at 201. Likewise, in Coulter v. Gilmore, 155 F.3d 912\n(7th Cir. 1998), the court of appeals spent several pages describing the\nbizarre nature of the procedure used by the state trial court in ruling on\nBatson objections. Id. at 915-16, 918. The court of appeals ultimately\nconcluded that the state court had not considered the totality of the\nrelevant circumstances and thus ordered that the petitioner be released\nif the state court did not conduct a Batson hearing using \"the proper\nmethodology.\" Id. at 922. The procedures used by the Delaware courts\nin the present case bear no resemblance to the procedures found\ndeficient in Jordan and Coulter.\n\nThe majority also cites two appeals in which the Sixth Circuit\nremanded cases for the district courts to provide more complete\nexplanations of Batson rulings. See United States v. Harris, 192 F.3d\n580, 588 (6th Cir. 1999); United States v. Hill , 146 F.3d 337 (6th Cir.\n1998). These, however, were direct federal appeals, not habeas\nproceedings initiated by state prisoners, and the relief ordered --\nremands for fuller explanation -- goes far beyond what the majority\nordered here.\n\f88\n\fThe majority confuses the obligation to consider all of the\nrelevant evidence (something that a court should always do\nin making findings of fact) with the obligation to comment\non all of the evidence (an obligation that we are not free to\nimpose on state courts).\n\nIn this case, as I have noted, there is no question that\nthe state courts did precisely what step three of Batson\nrequired -- they made findings as to whether Riley had\nestablished purposeful discrimination. And they did so only\nafter discovery and a thorough hearing. There is no reason\nto believe that the state courts did not consider all of the\nrelevant evidence, including all of the evidence that the\nmajority now finds persuasive. The Delaware courts simply\ndid not comment on all of this evidence. (Judgments about\ncredibility based on a witness's demeanor often do not lend\nthemselves to such explanation). But the Delaware courts\nwere not obligated to comment on all of the evidence. The\nmajority in this case reviews the decisions of the Delaware\ncourts as if they were decisions of a Social Security\nadministrative law judge, who must, we have held,\"give\nsome reason for discounting the evidence she rejects.\"\nPlummer v. Apfel, 186 F.3d 422, 429 (3d Cir. 1999). The\nDelaware courts, however, are not to be treated as if they\nwere federal administrative agencies.\n\nThe majority's relief. Even if the majority were correct\nthat the Delaware courts were obligated to explain on the\nrecord why they accepted the prosecution's explanations for\nits strikes and were not persuaded by Riley's evidence, that\nwould hardly justify the relief that the majority orders --\nthe granting of the writ unless Riley is re-tried. When a\ndecision is found to be faulty for failure to provide an\nadequate explanation, the logical remedy is to remand so\nthat an adequate explanation can be supplied. See, e.g.,\nFlorida Power & Light Co. v. Lorion, 470 U.S. 729, 744\n(1985); Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. v. State Farm Mut., 463\nU.S. 29, 57 (1983). Here, however, the majority does not\ngive the Delaware courts a chance to comply with the\nmajority's newly found procedural requirements. Nor does\nthe majority remand to the District Court for a hearing and\nfindings specifically addressing the points that the majority\nviews as important. Instead, the majority orders that the\nwrit be granted unless Riley is re-tried.\n\n                               89\n\fHow the state courts' failure to address Riley's evidence\non the record can justify such relief is baffling. If the lack\nof explanations on the record is important to the majority's\nanalysis, then the case should be remanded so that\nexplanations may be provided. If no explanations on the\nrecord could satisfy the majority -- and I believe that to be\nthe case -- then the majority's lengthy discussion of the\ninadequacy of the Delaware courts' opinions is beside the\npoint.\n\n3. The majority's remaining reasons for rejecting the\nhearing judge's finding require little response. The majority\nnotes that, although the prosecutor testified that Nichols\npaused, \"the record reflects no such pause.\" Maj. Op. at 16.\nI have read many trial transcripts, and I do not recall any\nin which the court reporter noted that a witness had or had\nnot paused before answering a question.\n\nThe majority finds it significant that \"despite Nichols'\nalleged pause, the prosecutors did not ask the trial court to\nremove Nichols for cause.\" Maj. Op. at 17. The majority\nraises the question \"why if Nichols actually did pause `a\nsignificant pause,' the state did not seek to have him\nremoved for cause.\" Id. Does the majority seriously believe\nthat a prospective juror who pauses before answering a\nquestion about the death penalty may properly be removed\nfor cause?\n\nThe majority observes that \"[t]he record does not show\n. . . that any of the contemporaneous notes kept by the\nprosecutors as to some of the jurors reflected either the\nexistence of a pause or the concern about which[the\nprosecutor] testified six years later.\" Maj. Op. at 17. The\nprosecutor's notes, however, consist of a handwritten sheet\nwith a few words or abbreviations scrawled next to the\nnames of some of the prospective jurors. Nichols's name is\nnot even on this sheet. The notes by no means record the\nreasons for all of the prosecution's strikes.\n\nI wish there were some scientific test that could\ndetermine with complete certainty whether Nichols paused\nand whether the prosecutor told the truth. Unfortunately,\nthere is no such test. We must rely to a substantial degree\non the ability of the judge who heard the prosecutor's\n\n                               90\n\ftestimony to make an accurate assessment of his\ncredibility. There is no question that the hearing judge took\nhis responsibility seriously and made his finding in good\nfaith. Our role under the federal habeas statute is to\ndetermine whether that credibility finding is \"fairly\nsupported by the record.\" It is.\n\nC: Charles McGuire.\n\n1. Riley's strongest Batson claim concerns the\nprosecution's strike of Charles McGuire. At trial, the\nprosecutor first used a peremptory challenge against\nMcGuire and then immediately made the following\napplication to the trial judge:\n\n        [THE PROSECUTOR]: Your Honor, may I ask the\n       Court to reconsider charging the State for that strike.\n       This Mr. McGuire came to chambers yesterday and\n       expressed his belief that he didn't know if he could last\n       the two weeks [the estimated length of the trial], there\n       was some problem with work. He was an inspector or\n       something for the Department of Labor. I know he\n       came in yesterday.\n\n        THE COURT: I will not strike him for cause for that\n       reason. He asked to be excused yesterday and I\n       decided not to excuse him.\n\nApp. 250.\n\nAt the evidentiary hearing held before the hearing judge,\nthe prosecutor testified that he struck McGuire because\nMcGuire \"had previously requested to be excused from jury\nservice\" and because the prosecutor \"wanted attentive\njurors\" who were not worried about missing other\nobligations or activities while the trial took place. App. 801.\n\nThe defense called McGuire as a witness at the\nevidentiary hearing. McGuire testified that he was employed\nby the State of Delaware as a Social Security \"disability\nadjudicator,\" App. 846-47; that he had been reporting for\njury duty in the courthouse in Dover for two to three weeks\nbefore he was questioned in connection with the Riley case\nbut had not been seated on a jury, id. at 852-53; that while\nhe was away from work, the disability claims assigned to\n\n                               91\n\fhim would \"just sit[ ],\" id. at 850; that the director of his\noffice had told him that he was going to make a\"formal\nrequest\" that McGuire be excused, id. at 860; that such a\nrequest was sent, id. at 853, 856; and that the request had\nbeen discussed in chambers with the judge. Id . at 849-50,\n856. McGuire said, however, that he himself had never\nexpressed an unwillingness to serve on the jury and had\nbeen willing to do so. See id. at 850.\n\nThe hearing judge accepted the prosecutor's explanation\nof the reason for striking McGuire. The hearing judge\nfound:\n\n       The State peremptorily challenged Charles McGuire\n       because [the prosecutor] believed he requested to be\n       excused from jury duty and, therefore, may have been\n       unable or unwilling to serve for the entirety of the trial.\n       . . . McGuire's employer sent a letter requesting he be\n       released from jury duty because he could not be\n       replaced at his job if he was chosen for jury duty. The\n       letter by McGuire's employer clearly gave the State\n       reason to question whether McGuire would give his full\n       time and attention to the trial and whether he would\n       be able to serve for the entirety of the time projected for\n       the trial. Whether McGuire, in fact, did not request\n       relief from jury duty and did wish to serve is of no\n       consequence.\n\nRiley v. State, No. 200, 1988 at 4-5 (emphasis added). The\nhearing judge then noted that the state's explanation for\nstriking McGuire, was \"entirely unrelated to the juror's\nrace,\" and the judge credited that explanation. Id. at 5.\nObviously, by crediting an explanation that was\"entirely\nunrelated to the juror's race,\" the hearing judge necessarily\nfound that Riley had not \"established purposeful\ndiscrimination,\" Batson, 476 U.S. at 98, and the hearing\njudge thus fully complied with Batson's step three.6\n\nSeveral factors provide substantial support for this\nfinding. It is apparent that McGuire's work situation was on\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6. The majority, however, incorrectly suggests (Maj. Op. at 33) that\nfinding \"the prosecutor to be credible\" is different from finding that\npurposeful discrimination was not proved.\n\n                               92\n\fthe prosecutor's mind when McGuire was peremptorily\nchallenged because, as noted, immediately after striking\nMcGuire, the prosecutor asked that McGuire's dismissal be\ndeemed for cause since he had \"expressed his belief that he\ndidn't know if he could last the two weeks.\" App. 250. In\naddition, a reasonable prosecutor might well have wondered\nwhether McGuire's work situation would adversely affect\nhis attentiveness at trial. As noted, McGuire's supervisor\nhad made a \"formal request\" that he be excused\"because\nhe could not be replaced at his job if he was chosen for jury\nduty.\"7 Whether or not McGuire himself in fact wished to\nserve on the jury, the impression apparently was conveyed\nthat McGuire wanted to be excused and to return to work,\nsince the trial judge commented: \"He asked to be excused\nyesterday and I decided not to excuse him.\" See App. 250.\nUnder these circumstances, a reasonable prosecutor could\nhave been concerned that McGuire might have been\ninattentive at trial due to worry about missing work, leaving\nhis duties unattended, and perhaps incurring his\nsupervisor's displeasure.\n\nRiley attacks the hearing judge's finding on two grounds.\nFirst, he points out that, according to McGuire's testimony\nat the post-conviction relief evidentiary hearing, McGuire\nhimself did not ask to be excused. This argument is\nunpersuasive. Although McGuire testified that he did not\nask to be excused, the trial judge, as noted, stated at the\ntime of McGuire's dismissal: \"He asked to be excused\nyesterday and I decided not to excuse him.\" App. 250\n(emphasis added). Thus, McGuire, who was unable to\nremember many details at the time of the post-conviction\nrelief evidentiary hearing, see id. at 853, 857-62, may have\nbeen mistaken, or he may have conveyed the impression at\nthe time of trial that he personally wanted to be excused.\n\nSecond, Riley points out that the handwritten sheet\nprepared by the prosecutors during voir dire contains the\nfollowing notation next to the name of a white juror,\nCharles Reed, whom the prosecution did not peremptorily\nstrike: \"works Lowe's -- wants off.\" One of the prosecutors\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n7. Riley v. State, No. 200, 1988 at 4. See also App. 860 (McGuire's\ntestimony at the evidentiary hearing).\n\n                               93\n\fwas questioned about this notation by Riley's attorney at\nthe post-conviction relief evidentiary hearing, but the\nprosecutor testified that he had no recollection of Reed. See\nApp. 823-24.\n\nThe notation by Reed's name and the prosecutor's\ntestimony at the evidentiary hearing are certainly factors\nthat the hearing judge could have viewed as tending to\nundermine the credibility of the prosecutor's explanation for\nstriking McGuire, but the notation and the prosecutor's\ntestimony are insufficient to show that the hearing judge's\nfinding is not \"fairly supported by the record.\" 28 U.S.C.\nS 2254(d). It is reasonable to infer from the notation \"wants\noff \" that, at some point in the jury selection process, Reed\nexpressed a desire to be excused for some reason. As far as\nI am aware, however, the record does not establish why8 or\nhow strongly Reed wanted to be excused. The transcript of\nthe voir dire shows that, at the final stage of the jury\nselection process, the members of the venire were asked\nwhether there was \"any reason why [they] absolutely [could\nnot] serve,\" App. 223; that members of the venire then\nsuccessfully asked to be released for reasons such as a\npreviously planned vacation, id. at 253; but that Reed made\nno request to be excused at that time. See id . at 229-30.\nThus, as far as the record appears to reveal, Reed may have\nhad a relatively weak desire and reason to be excused, and\nhis situation may not have been at all comparable in this\nrespect to McGuire's.9\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n8. Although the notation \"wants off \" appears after the words \"works at\nLowe's,\" it is not clear that Reed's desire to be excused was related to\nhis\nemployment. The prosecutor's notes appear to contain notations of the\nemployment of other jurors.\n\n9. Many decisions have held that Batson is not contravened simply\nbecause two jurors exhibit similar characteristics and one is excluded\nwhile the other is retained. See, e.g., Matthews v. Evatt, 105 F.3d 907,\n918 (4th Cir. 1997); United States v. Spriggs , 102 F.3d 1245, 1255 (D.C.\nCir. 1997); United States v. Stewart, 65 F.3d 918, 926 (11th Cir. 1995);\nUnited States v. Alvarado, 951 F.2d 22, 25 (2d Cir. 1991); United States\nv. Lance, 853 F.2d 1177, 1181 (5th Cir. 1988); United States v. McCoy,\n848 F.2d 743, 745 (6th Cir. 1988); United States v. Lewis, 837 F.2d 415,\n417 n.5 (9th Cir. 1988).\n\n                               94\n\fAs I have noted, our scope of review of the hearing\njudge's finding is narrow. Although it would be satisfying to\nknow why Reed was not stricken, that unanswered\nquestion is not enough, in view of the \"great deference\"10\nowed the hearing judge's credibility determination, to\ndemonstrate that the hearing judge's finding is not\"fairly\nsupported by the record.\"11 28 U.S.C. S 2254(d)(8) (1988 &\nSupp. 1990).\n\nIn an effort to bolster its unusual decision to overturn the\nhearing judge's credibility finding, the majority points to a\nstatement contained in the brief filed by the state in Riley's\ndirect appeal. The majority writes:\n\n       When Riley's direct appeal came before the Delaware\n       Supreme Court in 1984, the State justified the use of\n       race in selecting jurors in criminal trials. On that\n       occasion, which was the State's first opportunity to\n       defend the use of its peremptory challenges in Riley's\n       trial, the State did not offer a single race-neutral\n       explanation, not even as an alternate argument;\n       instead, it claimed that it was permissible -- even\n       socially desirable -- to exclude jurors based on what it\n       called `group association.' \"\n\nMaj. Op. at 25 (quoting App. 896).\n\nThis argument is not well taken. Responding to Riley's\nsuggestion that the Delaware Supreme Court should\nhold that individual race-based peremptories were\nunconstitutional, the state's brief argued as follows:\n\n       Because the Sixth Amendment does not support\n       [Riley's argument] and the decision in Swain v.\n       Alabama, 380 U.S. 202 (1965), more appropriately\n       recognizes how peremptory challenges, even those\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n10. Batson, 476 U.S. at 98 n.21.\n\n11. This case is very different from Jones v. Ryan, 987 F.2d 960 (1993).\nThere, exercising plenary review in the absence of any findings of fact by\na state court, we held that Batson was violated where the prosecutor\nexcluded a black juror who had a child approximately the same age as\nthe defendant, while retaining a white juror who was similarly situated.\nJones, 987 F.2d at 973. In the present case, we are limited to deciding\nwhether the state court finding is fairly supported by the evidence.\n\n                               95\n\f       exercised on the basis of group association, foster the\n       constitutional goal of an impartial jury, the state\n       asserts that no reversal is required here.\n\nApp. 896-97 (footnotes omitted). Thus, the state's brief --\nwhich the lead trial prosecutor did not even sign-- merely\nurged the state supreme court to follow the reasoning of the\nUnited States Supreme Court in what was then the\ngoverning federal precedent. It is far-fetched to interpret the\nstate's reliance on Swain as a tacit admission that its\nperemptories in this case were based on race -- particularly\nsince, in a footnote to the sentence quoted above, the state\nwas careful to deny that its challenges were racially based.12\n\nIt is also unreasonable to draw an adverse inference\nagainst the state for not providing race-neutral\nexplanations for its challenges in its appellate brief. Since\nthere was no evidence in the record regarding the reasons\nfor the strikes, the state could hardly have expected the\nstate supreme court to base a decision on explanations\nprovided without record support. The majority's arguments\nregarding the state's brief are insubstantial.\n\nThe majority's reliance on statistical evidence is even\nworse. In the Batson proceeding before the hearing judge,\nRiley made a proffer that no African American had served\non any of the three other first-degree murder trials that had\noccurred in Kent County within a year of his own and that\nin those cases the prosecution had peremptorily challenged\nfive African Americans. The three other trials were those of\nAndre Deputy, an African American, and two whites, Daniel\nPregent, who was acquitted, and Judith McBride, who was\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n12. The state's brief stated that it \"emphatically denie[d] that the\nprosecutor exercised any of his challenges solely on the assumption that\nthe juror's race, in the context of the facts of this case, indicated a\nverdict position adverse to the prosecution.\" App. 896. The majority\nseizes on the word \"solely\" in this sentence as a tacit admission that\nrace\nplayed a part in the decision to exercise peremptories. In my view, it is\nwholly unreasonable to read that much into the word\"solely.\" The\nSupreme Court in Batson itself used this same word in the same\ncontext. See 476 U.S. at 89 (emphasis added)(\"[T]he Equal Protection\nClause forbids the prosecutor to challenge potential jurors solely on\naccount of their race.\").\n\n                               96\n\fconvicted. With respect to these cases, no information was\nprovided at the time -- and none has been provided since\n-- about the identities of the prosecutors who participated\nin jury selection, the racial makeup of the venire, or the\nrace of jurors who were dismissed for cause or peremptorily\nchallenged by the defense.\n\nIn the trial of Andre Deputy, who was convicted and\nultimately executed, the state struck four whites, one\nAfrican American, and one person listed as \"Indian.\"\nDeputy argued that the prosecution's peremptory challenge\nof the African American venireperson violated Batson. See\nDeputy v. Taylor, 19 F.3d 1485, 1492 (3d Cir. 1994).\nDeputy's Batson argument was rejected in the district court\ndecision denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus,\nand our court affirmed. See id. at 1492. Since it has been\nheld that no Batson violation was shown in Deputy, it is\ndifficult to see how that case can be viewed as supporting\nRiley's argument here.\n\nIn Pregent's case, the state struck four whites and one\nblack. There is nothing before us to indicate that any\nBatson objection was made, and it is doubtful that the\npattern of strikes exercised by the prosecution sufficed to\nmake out a prima facie case.\n\nThe remaining case is the prosecution of Judith McBride\nfor murdering her husband. See McBride v. State , 477 A.2d\n174 (Del. 1984). The state exercised a total of 10 strikes, of\nwhich three were against potential jurors identified as black.13\nThere is nothing to indicate that any Batson objection was\nmade. Without in effect holding a Batson hearing, there is\nno way of determining whether any prosecution\nperemptories were based on race.\n\nAlthough Riley was represented at the Batson hearing by\na professor of law and has been represented in the federal\nhabeas proceeding by attorneys from one of the nation's\nleading law firms, no expert analysis of these statistics has\never been offered.14 According to the majority, however, the\n\"sophisticated analysis of a statistician\" is not needed to\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n13. According to Riley's statistics, five of those struck by the state\nwere\nwhite, and the race of two is not provided.\n14. The majority's statement that \"the procedural posture of the case\"\nprovided \"no opportunity\" for Riley to offer an expert analysis of his\nstatistics (Maj. Op. at 38) is difficult to understand. What stopped Riley\nfrom offering the evidence of a statistician as to the significance of the\nscant statistics that Riley provided?\n\f97\n\finterpret the significance of these statistics. Maj. Op. at 19.\n\"An amateur with a pocket calculator,\" the majority writes,\ncan calculate that \"there is little chance of randomly\nselecting four consecutive all white juries.\" Id.\n\nStatistics can be very revealing -- and also terribly\nmisleading in the hands of \"an amateur with a pocket\ncalculator.\" The majority's simplistic analysis treats the\nprospective jurors who were peremptorily challenged as if\nthey had no relevant characteristics other than race, as if\nthey were in effect black and white marbles in a jar from\nwhich the lawyers drew. In reality, however, these\nindividuals had many other characteristics, and without\ntaking those variables into account, it is simply not possible\nto determine whether the prosecution's strikes were based\non race or something else.\n\nThe dangers in the majority's approach can be easily\nillustrated. Suppose we asked our \"amateur with a pocket\ncalculator\" whether the American people take right- or left-\nhandedness into account in choosing their Presidents.\nAlthough only about 10% of the population is left-handed,\nleft-handers have won five of the last six presidential\nelections.15 Our \"amateur with a calculator\" would conclude\nthat \"there is little chance of randomly selecting\" left-\nhanders in five out of six presidential elections. But does it\nfollow that the voters cast their ballots based on whether a\ncandidate was right- or left-handed?\n\nWhether even a careful multiple-regression analysis of\nperemptory challenge statistics in other cases would suffice\nto show that a Batson violation occurred in this case is\nunclear. Cf. McClesky v. Kemp, 481 U.S. 279 (1987). Here,\nhowever, we have not been presented with any expert\nstatistical evidence.\n\nThe majority and the concurrence argue that an adverse\ninference should be drawn against the state for failing to\ncome forward with data to rebut Riley's statistics. I see no\nbasis for this approach. Whether an adverse inference\nshould be drawn under particular circumstances based on\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n15. See \"Forget Left-Wing. Say Hello to Left-Handed Politics,\" New York\nTimes, Jan. 23, 2000.\n\n                               98\n\fa party's failure to produce evidence in a state proceeding\nis in the first instance a question of state law, and unless\na state court's failure to draw such an inference in a\nparticular case denies due process or a fair and adequate\nhearing, a federal habeas court should be reluctant to\nreject the state court's ruling. Cf. 28 U.S.C. S 2254 (6) and\n(7) (1988 & Supp. 1990) (amended 1996). Moreover, even if\nthis were a collateral attack on a federal conviction, we\nwould defer to the decision of the judge who conducted the\nhearing as to whether the circumstances justified the\ndrawing of adverse inference and would reverse only if the\njudge committed an abuse of discretion. See, e.g., Bouzo v.\nCitibank, N.A., 96 F.3d 51, 60 (2d Cir. 2000).\n\nHere, the state courts' failure to draw such an inference\ncertainly did not constitute an abuse of discretion. The\nstate was never given notice that it had any obligation to\nprovide additional data, and it is not at all clear what sort\nof evidence the majority expects the state to have provided.\nThe information that is most critically lacking-- the\nprosecutors' reasons for striking the five African American\nvenire members in the Deputy, McBride, and Pregent cases\n-- probably could not have been obtained without in effect\nconducting retrospective Batson hearings in those cases.\nDoes the majority think that such a hearing would have\nbeen practical? Or does the majority think that the state\nshould have retained am expert to analyze the state's use\nof peremptory challenges in some other set of cases? In\norder to make such an analysis, the expert probably would\nhave needed detailed information about the prospective\njurors whom the state did and did not strike -- e.g., their\nages, marital status, education, occupations, and past\nexperiences with law enforcement, to name just a few of the\nmyriad variables that often figure in decisions about\nperemptory challenges. We have no indication that such\ninformation was available, and in any event, compiling and\nanalyzing the data concerning a reasonable sample of cases\ncould have been a massive undertaking. In my view, it is\nentirely unwarranted to hold that the state courts abused\ntheir discretion because they did not draw adverse\ninferences from the state's failure to volunteer to conduct\nsuch a study in response to the statistics that Riley\nproffered.\n\n                               99\n\fIn sum, I see no ground for overturning the hearing\njudge's credibility findings. I would thus hold that the\npresumption of correctness has not been overcome and\nwould reject Riley's Batson argument. The majority -- by in\neffect making its own credibility findings on the cold state\ncourt record -- seriously errs. See Marshall v. Lonberger,\n459 U.S. at 434.\n\nII.\n\nI now turn to the majority's holding that a remark made\nby the prosecutor in closing argument at the penalty phase\nof the trial violated Caldwell v. Mississippi , supra. In\nCaldwell, the defense attorney's closing argument asked the\njury to \"confront both the gravity and responsibility of\ncalling for another's death.\" 472 U.S. at 324. In response,\nthe prosecutor took strong exception to the defense\nattorney's comments and stated:\n\n       Now, they would have you believe that you're going to\n       kill this man and they know -- they know that your\n       decision is not the final decision. My God, how unfair\n       can you be? Your job is reviewable. They know it. . . .\n       For they know, as I know, and as [the judge] has told\n       you, that the decision you render is automatically\n       reviewable by the Supreme Court.\n\nId. at 325-26.\n\nBy a vote of five to three, the United States Supreme\nCourt reversed the defendant's death sentence. The\nplurality opinion approved by four justices concluded that\nthe prosecutor's comments were improper for two reasons:\nfirst, because the prosecutor's description of the state\nscheme of appellate review was not \"accurate\" and, second,\nbecause the availability of appellate review was\"wholly\nirrelevant to the determination of the appropriate sentence.\"\nId.\n\nJustice O'Connor, who cast the deciding fifth vote for\nreversal, refused to endorse the principle that\"the giving of\nnonmisleading and accurate information regarding the\njury's role in the sentencing scheme is irrelevant to the\nsentencing decision.\" 472 U.S. at 341 (opinion of O'Connor,\n\n                               100\n\fJ.) (emphasis added). However, she agreed that the\nprosecutor's statements were improper because they\n\"creat[ed] the mistaken impression that automatic appellate\nreview of the jury's sentence would provide the\nauthoritative determination of whether death was\nappropriate,\" whereas in fact the state supreme court\nexercised only a narrow scope of review. Id.\n\nIn subsequent cases, the Court has clarified the holding\nin Caldwell. In Romano v. Oklahoma, 512 U.S. 1, 9 (1994),\nthe Court wrote as follows:\n\n       As Justice O'CONNOR supplied the fifth vote in\n       Caldwell, and concurred on grounds narrower than\n       those put forth by the plurality, her position is\n       controlling. See Marks v. United States, 430 U.S. 188,\n       193 (1977) . . . . Accordingly, we have since read\n       Caldwell as \"relevant only to certain types of comment\n       --those that mislead the jury as to its role in the\n       sentencing process in a way that allows the jury to feel\n       less responsible than it should for the sentencing\n       decision.\" Durden v. Wainwright, 477 U.S. 168, 184,\n       n.15 (1986). Thus, \"[t]o establish a Caldwell violation,\n       a defendant necessarily must show that the remarks to\n       the jury improperly described the role assigned to the\n       jury by local law.\" Dugger v. Adams, 489 U.S. 401, 407\n       (1989), see also Sawyer v. Smith, 497 U.S. 227, 233\n       (1990).\n\nThe Romano Court rejected the Caldwell argument\nadvanced in that case because \"the jury was not\naffirmatively misled regarding its role in the sentencing\nprocess.\" Id. at 10.\n\nRiley's argument is based on a statement made by the\nprosecutor near the very beginning of his summation at the\nsentencing phase of the trial. The prosecutor stated:\n\n       As the Judge has explained to you we have a specific\n       statute with regard to what occurred in a penalty\n       hearing on a capital case.\n\n       Let me say at the outset that what you do today is\n       automatically reviewed by our Supreme Court and that\n       is why there is an automatic review on the death\n\n                                101\n\f       penalty. That is why, if you return a decision of death,\n       that is why you will receive and have to fill out a two-\n       page interrogatory that the Court will give you. This is\n       an interrogatory that specifically sets out the questions\n       that the State request and whether or not you believe\n       it beyond a reasonable doubt and if you want in your\n       determination, if you believe the sentence should be\n       death then each and every one of you has to sign this.\n       This goes to the Supreme Court. That is why it is\n       concise and we believe clear and it should be looked\n       carefully on and answered appropriately.\n\nApp. 393 (emphasis added). Riley argues that the\nhighlighted words quoted above violated Caldwell .\n\nIn its decision on direct appeal, the Delaware Supreme\nCourt responded to this argument as follows:\n\n       [T]he prosecutor's remarks in no way suggested that\n       responsibility for ultimately determining whether\n       defendant faced life imprisonment or death rested\n       elsewhere. The prosecutor's passing comment to the\n       jury that its decision would be \"automatically reviewed\"\n       was fairly made in the context of the prosecutor's\n       preceding reference to the \"specific statute[controlling]\n       a penalty hearing on a capital case.\" 11 Del.C.S 4209.\n       Since subsection (g) of S 4209 mandates the\"Automatic\n       Review of Death Penalty by Delaware Supreme Court\",\n       the prosecutor in the instant case was simply quoting\n       the statute. In no sense may it reasonably be said that\n       the prosecutor was either misstating the law,\n       misleading the jury as to its role, or minimizing its\n       sentencing responsibility.\n\n496 A.2d at 1025 (alteration in original). I agree with this\nanalysis.\n\nThe prosecutor's remarks in Caldwell were\"quite\nfocused, unambiguous, and strong.\" 472 U.S. at 340. The\nclear message was that, contrary to the suggestion of\ndefense counsel that the jury should \"confront both the\ngravity and responsibility of calling for another's death,\" id.\nat 324, the jury need not shoulder that responsibility\nbecause \"the authoritative determination of whether death\nwas appropriate\" would be made by the state supreme\n\n                               102\n\fcourt. Id. at 343 (Opinion of O'Connor, J.). It was in this\nsense that the remarks \" `improperly described the role\nassigned to the jury by local law' \"16 and thus \" `allowed the\njury to feel less responsible than it should for the\nsentencing decision.' \"17\n\nThe prosecutor's remarks in this case were very different.\nHere, the prosecutor made accurate, unemotional, passing\nremarks in the context of describing the state statute and\nexplaining why the jury would have to \"fill out a two-page\ninterrogatory\" if it returned a capital sentence. These\nremarks did not convey the message that the jury should\nnot confront the gravity of returning a death verdict, and\nthus the mere mention of the fact that there would be an\nautomatic appeal to the state supreme court did not\nmislead the jury as to its role in the sentencing process. In\nthis connection, it is noteworthy that after the closing\narguments, the trial judge instructed the jury on its role\nusing language that left no doubt about its responsibility.\nThe trial judge stated: \"Where the jury submits such a\nfinding and recommendation, the Court shall sentence the\ndefendant to death.\" See 585 A.2d at 731 (emphasis added).\nA \"recommendation of death, supported by the evidence,\nshall be binding on the Court.\" Id. (emphasis added). \"Your\nunanimous recommendation for the imposition of the death\npenalty, if supported by the evidence, is binding on the\nCourt.\" Id. at 734 (emphasis added). In light of the\nsubstantial factual differences between Caldwell and this\ncase, and in light of the Supreme Court's subsequent\nexplanation of the meaning of Caldwell, I would reject\nRiley's Caldwell claim.\n\nThe majority appears to hold that a Caldwell violation\noccurred simply because the prosecutor accurately stated\nthat there would be an automatic appeal to the state\nsupreme court without attempting to explain the scope of\nreview that the state supreme court would exercise. I do not\nagree with this reading of Caldwell. Neither Justice\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n16. Romano v. Oklahoma, 512 U.S. at 9 (quoting Dugger v. Adams, 489\nU.S. at 407).\n\n17. Romano v. Oklahoma, 512 U.S. at 9 (quoting Durden v. Wainwright,\n477 U.S. at 184, n.15).\n\n                               103\n\fO'Connor's controlling opinion in Caldwell nor the Court's\nsubsequent explanation in Romano took the position that\nan unadorned reference to automatic judicial review of a\ncapital verdict is enough to violate the Constitution. And\nsuch a holding would make little sense. As the Seventh\nCircuit has noted:\n\n       Everyone knows that after a death sentence is\n       imposed, there are tiers of appellate review designed to\n       catch errors; the prosecutor wasn't telling the jurors\n       anything they didn't know already. Appellate review is\n       a fact of almost all criminal cases that are tried.\n       Knowledge of this does not cause jurors to take lightly\n       their sentencing responsibilities.\n\nFleenor v. Anderson, 171 F.3d 1096, 1098 (7th Cir. 1999).\nWhat Caldwell forbids is not a simple reference to\nautomatic appellate review, but the suggestion that the\nscope of review is broader than it is in fact. The remarks in\nCaldwell conveyed such a suggestion; the comments here\ndid not. I would therefore hold that no Caldwell violation\noccurred.\n\nIII.\n\nReviewing habeas decisions in capital cases is one of the\nmost important and difficult responsibilities of this court.\nOur role is vital -- but limited -- and is not to be confused\nwith that of the jury or the various branches of state\ngovernment. Applying the legal standards that are\napplicable to us in the present context, I believe that the\ndecision of the district court must be affirmed.\n\nA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n\n                                104\n\f",

Riley, a 22 year old black man, was\nsentenced to death on the vote of a Delaware state jury in\nDecember 1982. If the time intervening between that\nsentence and this court's en banc consideration of the\nmatter has been lengthy, it is not because there has been\nundue delay at any stage but because the case raises\nlegitimate questions that go to the constitutionality of the\noriginal trial and sentencing. It was necessary to complete\na series of proceedings in both state and federal court, none\nof them duplicative, before the case reached this stage.\n\n                                  2\n\fAfter all, there can be no reconsideration after the\nexecution of a death sentence.\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nAccording to testimony at the trial, Riley and Tyrone\nBaxter stopped in a liquor store in Dover, Delaware, on\nFebruary 8, 1982, to get some beer and rob the store.\nMichael Williams waited in the car. Baxter testified that\nRiley, armed with a gun, placed a bottle of beer on the\ncounter and announced the store was being robbed. When\nthe store owner, James Feeley, a 59 year old white man,\nbacked away from the cash register, Baxter grabbed the\nmoney out of the cash drawer. Riley tried to take Feeley's\nwallet, but Feeley resisted. At Baxter's urging, Riley shot\nFeeley in the leg. Feeley, who was then hopping up and\ndown, apparently from the gunshot, said \"[Y]ou f 'ing\nniggers.\" App. at 327. As Riley and Baxter were proceeding\nto the door to leave, Feeley threw a wine bottle that struck\nRiley in the arm. Riley then shot Feeley in the chest, killing\nhim.\n\nIn May 1982, Riley, Baxter, and Williams were indicted\non charges of felony murder, intentional murder, first\ndegree robbery, possession of a deadly weapon during a\nfelony, and second degree conspiracy. Riley pled not guilty\nto all charges. Baxter pled guilty to first degree murder and\nwas sentenced to life imprisonment in exchange for his\ntestimony against Riley. The murder and weapon charges\nagainst Williams were also dropped in exchange for his\ntestimony against Riley, and he was subsequently convicted\nof the robbery and conspiracy charges.\n\nRiley was represented at trial by appointed counsel, a\ndefense-side civil litigator who had never represented a\ncriminal defendant in either a murder or a capital case. His\npretrial motions for co-counsel and funds for a private\ninvestigator were denied. The prosecutors in Riley's case\nwere James Liguori and Mark McNulty. Liguori, the lead\nprosecutor, was a friend and neighbor of Feeley's, and they\nbelonged to the same church.\n\n                               3\n\fThe State presented the testimony of Baxter, Williams,\nBaxter's mother (who testified that Riley spent the night\nbefore the robbery at her house), and a witness who\nreported that Riley's fingerprints were on a bottle of beer in\nthe liquor store. In defense, Riley testified that he was in\nPhiladelphia on the day of the murder celebrating his\nmother's birthday. However, Riley's mother did not testify in\nsupport of his alibi. The only witness Riley presented other\nthan himself was an inmate at the prison in which Baxter\nwas incarcerated, and he testified that Baxter had admitted\nto shooting Feeley.\n\nRiley was tried before and convicted on all counts by an\nall white jury in Kent County Superior Court (the Delaware\ntrial court) in December 1982. Four days after the verdict,\nthe jury proceeded to consider the penalty. The State\nsought the death penalty, relying only on Riley's felony\nmurder conviction and using the underlying robbery as the\nlone aggravating circumstance. Following a two-hour\npenalty hearing, the jury unanimously recommended a\nsentence of death which the court accepted. Riley was also\nsentenced to life imprisonment without parole for\nintentional murder, 20 years imprisonment for robbery, 5\nyears imprisonment for possession of a deadly weapon, and\n3 years imprisonment for conspiracy. Riley's attorney\nexplained to the trial court that he spent only 14 hours\npreparing for the penalty phase because he had been too\nbusy \"with the defense and the merits\" to spend more time\nbuilding a case in mitigation. App. at 443-444.\n\nRiley appealed his conviction and sentence on numerous\ngrounds. In July 1985, the Delaware Supreme Court\naffirmed, see Riley v.

The\nauthor of this opinion dissented on two claims, those\nraising Batson and Caldwell violations (claims numbered 1\nand 5 above).

We will address each of these\narguments in turn.\n\nA.\n\nTHE BATSON CLAIM\n\nRiley's claim that the prosecution violated the Equal\nProtection Clause by using its peremptory challenges to\nstrike all three prospective black jurors from the jury panel\nbecause of their race, thereby leaving no black juror sitting\non the jury, stems from the Supreme Court decision in\nBatson v. Kentucky, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111662\"><a href=\"/opinion/111662/batson-v-kentucky/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1986).2\n\n1. Preservation of Claim\n\nThe District Court held that Riley was procedurally\nbarred from raising his Batson claim in his habeas petition\nbecause he failed to present that claim to the trial court.\nSee Riley VIII, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">172856</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *15. We do not agree.3\nThe Delaware Supreme Court concluded on Riley's direct\nappeal \"that no Sixth Amendment peremptory challenge\nclaim was fairly presented to the Trial Court,\" and also\nheld, in the alternate, that Riley's Batson claim failed on\nthe merits. Riley I, 496 A.2d at 1010. However, the\nSupreme Court of the United States has since made clear\nthat, \"[i]f the last state court to be presented with a\nparticular federal claim reaches the merits, it removes any\nbar to federal-court review that might otherwise have been\navailable.\" Ylst v. Nunnemaker, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112642\"><a href=\"/opinion/112642/ylst-v-nunnemaker/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">797</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 801 (1991).\n\nIn his memorandum opinion granting Riley's motion for a\npost-conviction evidentiary hearing, the Superior Court\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. Although Riley's trial occurred several years before the Batson\ndecision, the Supreme Court did not deny certiorari in Riley's direct\nappeal until shortly after Batson was decided, thus entitling Riley to the\nbenefit of that decision. See Griffith v. Kentucky, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111785\"><a href=\"/opinion/111785/griffith-v-kentucky/\"><span class=\"volume\">479</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">314</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 328\n(1987); Deputy v.

Much of the discussion of procedural bar is taken from the opinion of\nJudge Alito from the panel opinion that was vacated. See Riley IX, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2001</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">43597</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2-*6.\n\n                               8\n\fhearing judge stated that he did not think the State\nSupreme Court would maintain its position that Riley had\nfailed to timely present a Batson claim. See Riley III, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1988</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">130430</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2 (citing Baynard v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2361653\"><a href=\"/opinion/2361653/baynard-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">682</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(Del. 1986)).4 Thereafter, the hearing judge considered and\nrejected Riley's Batson claim on the merits. See Riley IV,\nApp. at 887-891. On appeal, the Delaware Supreme Court\naffirmed the hearing judge's decision, using language that\nexpressly refers to the Superior Court's rejection of Riley's\nBatson claim on the merits. See infra note 9. Moreover, in\nthat passage, the Delaware Supreme Court expressly\nreaffirmed its holding on direct appeal that the\nprosecution's use of peremptory challenges in this case did\nnot violate the state constitution. Not only is there no\nreaffirmation of its prior holding concerning procedural\ndefault, but there is no reference to that holding, leading us\nto conclude it no longer relied on a procedural bar. See\nHarris v. Reed, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112205\"><a href=\"/opinion/112205/harris-v-reed/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">255</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 266 (1989) (concluding that\nhabeas claim was not procedurally barred where state court\nrejected the claim on the merits notwithstanding its\nobservation that allegations \"could have been raised [on]\ndirect appeal\").\n\nIf the Delaware Supreme Court had continued to believe\nat the time of its most recent decision that Riley's Batson\nclaim was foreclosed for failure to make a proper objection\nat the time of trial, it seems likely that the Court would\nhave made that point expressly, instead of affirming the\nhearing judge's findings on the merits. Indeed, it is unlikely\nthat it would have made no comment on the hearing\njudge's failure to follow its earlier decision on foreclosure.\nThus, we interpret the decision of the Delaware Supreme\nCourt in Riley V (its most recent) to be a rejection of Riley's\nBatson claim on the merits. Accordingly, Riley's Batson\nclaim is not procedurally barred and we proceed to examine\nits merits.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4. In Baynard, the Court held that the defendant sufficiently raised an\nobjection to the State's peremptory challenges which resulted in an all\nwhite jury being impaneled where defendant \"noted the race of each\nblack against whom the State exercised a peremptory challenge,\" \"moved\nthe Court to refuse the peremptory challenges against two of the drawn\nblack jurors and moved to quash the entire panel at the end of the jury\nselection process.\" 518 A.2d at 687.\n\n                               9\n\f2. Batson v. Kentucky\n\nIn Batson, the Supreme Court reiterated the well-settled\nprinciple that the Equal Protection Clause prohibits\ndiscrimination on account of race in selection of both the\nvenire and the petit jury. See 476 U.S. at 88. This principle,\nwhich dates back at least as far as Strauder v. West\nVirginia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"90039\"><a href=\"/opinion/90039/strauder-v-west-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">303</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1880), recognizes that racial\ndiscrimination in the selection of jurors harms\"not only the\naccused whose life or liberty they are summoned to try,\"\nbut also harms the potential juror, whose race \"is unrelated\nto his fitness as a juror.\" Batson, 476 U.S. at 87 (quotation\nomitted). As the Court noted in Batson,\"[s]election\nprocedures that purposefully exclude black persons from\njuries undermine public confidence in the fairness of our\nsystem of justice.\" Id.\n\nThe Court granted certiorari in Batson so that it could\nreexamine the evidentiary burden its opinion in Swain v.\nAlabama, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106997\"><a href=\"/opinion/106997/swain-v-alabama/\"><span class=\"volume\">380</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">202</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1965), had placed on a criminal\ndefendant who alleged that the State improperly used its\nperemptory challenges to exclude jurors based on race. In\nSwain, the Court had held that a defendant could satisfy a\nprima facie case of purposeful discrimination by showing\nthat a prosecutor, \"in case after case, whatever the\ncircumstances, whatever the crime and whoever the\ndefendant or the victim may be, is responsible for the\nremoval of Negroes who have been selected as qualified\njurors by the jury commissioners and who have survived\nchallenges for cause, with the result that no Negroes ever\nserve on petit juries.\" Id. at 223. The Batson Court noted\nthat many lower courts interpreted Swain to hold \"that\nproof of repeated striking of blacks over a number of cases\nwas necessary to establish a violation of the Equal\nProtection Clause.\" Batson, 476 U.S. at 92. The Court in\nBatson recognized that this standard had \"placed on\ndefendants a crippling burden of proof \" that resulted in\n\"prosecutors' peremptory challenges [becoming] largely\nimmune from constitutional scrutiny.\" Id. at 92-93 (footnote\nomitted). Accordingly, it rejected the Swain evidentiary\nformulation.\n\nIn the jurisprudence that has evolved following Batson,\nthe inquiry has been characterized as a three-step one.\n\n                               10\n\fBatson stated that \"a defendant may establish a prima facie\ncase of purposeful discrimination in selection of the petit\njury solely on evidence concerning the prosecutor's exercise\nof peremptory challenges at the defendant's trial.\" Id. at 96.\nOnce the defendant makes a prima facie showing of racial\ndiscrimination (step one), the prosecution must articulate a\nrace-neutral explanation for its use of peremptory\nchallenges (step two). If it does so, the trial court must\ndetermine whether the defendant has established\npurposeful discrimination (step three). See id. at 96-98;\nSimmons v. Beyer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"686731\"><a href=\"/opinion/686731/lawrence-l-simmons-v-howard-l-beyer-and-the-attorney-general-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1160</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1167 (3d Cir. 1995);\nDeputy v.

The\nultimate burden of persuasion regarding racial motivation\nrests with, and does not shift from, the defendant. See\nPurkett v. Elem, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117934\"><a href=\"/opinion/117934/purkett-v-elem/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">765</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 768 (1995).\n\n3. Riley's Batson Challenge in State Court\n\nIn this case, the hearing judge determined, and the State\ndoes not contest, that Riley made out a prima facie case of\ndiscrimination in jury selection, as the State had used its\nperemptory challenges to strike all three prospective black\njurors from the venire, \"result[ing] in an all-white jury\nsitting on a first degree murder trial involving a black\ndefendant and a white victim.\" Riley III, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1988</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">130430</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\nat *2. The hearing judge then conducted an evidentiary\nhearing. The State proceeded to step two of the Batson\ninquiry by offering race-neutral justifications for its use of\nthe peremptory challenges to strike Ray Nichols, Lois\nBeecher, and Charles McGuire, each of whom was black.\n\nLiguori, the lead prosecutor at trial and the State's\nprincipal witness at the post-conviction relief hearing,\ntestified that the State \"wanted to have minority\nrepresentation on the jury panel.\" App. at 792-793. He\nstated that he wanted jurors who would be attentive and\nwho would vote for a death sentence. He testified that he\nwanted \"to make sure we were not only going to get a\nconviction of murder in the first degree, but also the death\npenalty.\" App. at 797.\n\nWith respect to Nichols, Liguori remembered clearly that\n\"Mr. Nichols was an individual who, and unfortunately the\nrecord doesn't reflect this, who was not, in my particular\n\n                                11\n\fmind, not certain with regard to being able to return a\nverdict for death.\" App. at 797-798 (emphasis added). As\nLiguori explained, \"there was a pause and a significant\npause in [Nichols'] answering [the court's] inquiry [at voir\ndire] and that to me was enough to suggest that he might\nnot be able to return a death penalty and I didn't want\nanyone that wasn't going to give me a death penalty.\" App.\nat 798-799.\n\nWith regard to Beecher, Liguori testified that he struck\nher because of her response to the court that she did not\nthink she could impose the death penalty. App. at 804.\n\nAs for McGuire, Liguori explained that he used the\nperemptory challenge because he presumed McGuire would\nbe unable to \"give his full time and attention\" to the trial.\nApp. at 801. According to Liguori,\n\n       Mr. McGuire was an individual who had requested--\n       remember, this was going to be around Christmas also.\n\n       Mr. McGuire had previously requested to be excused\n       from jury service. When Mr. McGuire came up, the first\n       thing I wanted to make clear--as I said earlier, I\n       wanted someone that was going to be attentive and you\n       can read all the books you want with regard to\n       selecting prospective jurors and it is always make sure\n       you have attentive jurors, people not concerned about\n       getting home early to take care of their kids, or\n       vacation.\n\n       Mr. McGuire himself had requested the Court to\n       excuse him. The Court didn't. When he went through\n       his inquiry, we asked the judge to excuse him for\n       cause. The judge said no. It then left us with no\n       alternative but to think he would not give his full time\n       and attention and therefore we struck Mr. McGuire.\n\nApp. at 801.\n\nOn cross-examination of Liguori, Riley's attorney\nintroduced Liguori's handwritten notes from voir dire.\nWritten next to McGuire's name was the word \"Out.\" App.\nat 832. Among the names on the same page was that of\nCharles Reed, a white man who actually served on Riley's\njury. Next to Reed's name on the sheet was written,\"works\n\n                               12\n\fLowe's, wants off.\" App. at 823. Despite repeated efforts by\nRiley's counsel to refresh Liguori's recollection, Liguori\ntestified that he had no recollection of Reed whatsoever.\nLiguori agreed, however, that the notation next to Reed's\nname indicated that Reed had requested to be excused from\nservice on the jury. Liguori offered no explanation for his\ndecision not to strike Reed.\n\nRiley then presented McGuire as a witness at the state\npost-conviction hearing. McGuire testified that, in contrast\nto Liguori's testimony, he had never asked to be excused\nfrom the jury. McGuire specifically denied ever indicating to\neither the prosecutors or the court that he was unwilling to\nserve on the jury or that he wanted to be excused. Instead,\nhe testified that his supervisor had told him that he was\ngoing to make a \"formal request\" that McGuire be excused\nand that his supervisor did send a letter to the trial judge\nrequesting he be relieved from jury duty. App. at 860.\nAccording to McGuire, in response to his supervisor's letter,\nhe was questioned by the trial judge whom he advised of\nhis willingness to serve on the jury. App. at 849-850.\n\nRiley also presented evidence that in addition to the\nprosecutor's striking of the three prospective black jurors in\nhis trial, the Kent County Prosecutor's office used its\nperemptory challenges to remove every prospective black\njuror in the three other first degree murder trials that\noccurred within a year of his trial.5 Counsel for the State\nobjected to the admission of this evidence, arguing that\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5. The three other trials were:\n\n       a. Andre Deputy--state struck the lone prospective black juror, a\n       second juror designated as \"Indian,\" and six prospective white\n       jurors;\n\n       b. Judith McBride--state struck all three prospective black jurors,\n       five whites, plus two other jurors whose race has not been\n       identified; and\n\n       c. Daniel Pregent--state struck the lone prospective black juror\n       and four whites.\n\nAlthough the race of two of the jurors who were ultimately impaneled\nhas not been identified, the State does not contest Riley's assertion that\nevery impaneled juror was white.\n\n                                  13\n\fevidence of general prosecutorial practices was relevant\nonly to Riley's prima facie case. The hearing judge rejected\nthis argument and admitted the evidence, explaining that it\nwas being offered to show that \"the exercise of the\nperemptory challenges in this particular case followed some\nkind of pattern that exists in the prosecutorial actions in\nfirst degree murder cases involving minority defendants and\nit is not segregable or severable from past history.\" App. at\n872.\n\nCounsel for the State then requested and received an\nadditional four weeks in which to \"attempt to prepare the\nsame sort of information which . . . would be contrary to\nthe representations made by [Riley's counsel's]\ninformation.\" App. at 874. He informed the court that he\nhad not yet been able to obtain materials from other cases,\nbut he assured the court that \"they do exist.\" App. at 874.\nYet approximately one month after the hearing, the State\nadvised the hearing judge by a letter dated January 27,\n1989 from Jeffrey M. Taschner, Deputy Attorney General,\nthat stated in full: \"Please be advised that the State will not\nsupplement the record of the post conviction relief hearing\nheld in the above-captioned matter on December 30, 1988.\"\nLetter to this Court from Thomas J. Allingham II (Dec. 16,\n1999), Ex. B (on file in the Clerk's office).\n\nThe hearing judge ultimately accepted the State's race-\nneutral explanations and rejected Riley's Batson claim,\nwithout mentioning any of the evidence introduced by Riley\nat the hearing. See Riley IV, App. at 887-891. The Delaware\nSupreme Court affirmed, likewise without discussion of\nRiley's evidence. See Riley V, 585 A.2d at 725.\n\n4.

See 28 U.S.C. S 2254(d) (1988).\n\nThe District Court rejected Riley's Batson claim on the\nmerits by relying on this presumption of correctness.

S 2254(d)(6) (1988).\nBecause we resolve Riley's appeal pursuant to S 2254(d)(8),\nwe need not consider Riley's latter argument.\n\nThe limited nature of review underlying the requirement\nthat a federal court must defer to the state court findings\nof fact if they are \"fairly supported by the record\" reflects\nimportant policy considerations.

In Purkett, the Supreme Court\nstated that \"implausible or fantastic justifications may (and\nprobably will) be found to be pretexts for purposeful\ndiscrimination.\" 514 U.S. at 768. In addition, the Supreme\nCourt has suggested, albeit in a non-habeas context, that\nreviewing courts need not accept a trial judge's findings\nbased on credibility determinations if the witness has not\ntold a \"coherent and facially plausible story\" or if his story\nis \"contradicted by extrinsic evidence.\" Anderson, 470 U.S.\nat 575. Thus, we must determine whether there is fair\nsupport to conclude that the State put forth \"a coherent\nand facially plausible\" explanation of its strikes of the\nprospective black jurors or whether the State's explanations\nare \"implausible.\" Ultimately, when we review the record at\nstep three of the Batson inquiry, we must decide whether\nthe state courts' acceptance of the State's explanation has\nbeen made after consideration of all the evidence on the\nrecord.\n\n5. State's Race-Neutral Explanations\n\nAt the post-conviction hearing, the State proceeded to\nstep two of the Batson inquiry by offering race-neutral\nreasons for striking the black jurors. It did so primarily\nthrough Liguori's testimony. Riley does not argue that the\nState failed to meet its step two burden. His contention is\nthat the state courts failed to engage in the step three\ninquiry, which requires evaluation of the proffered race-\nneutral reasons in light of all the other evidence in the\nrecord.\n\nLiguori contended he struck Nichols because he doubted\nwhether Nichols would be willing to return a death\nsentence. He based this doubt on his clear recollection of \"a\nsignificant pause\" by Nichols when asked about the death\npenalty. App. at 798. Yet, as Liguori himself admitted in his\ntestimony, the record reflects no such pause and no such\nuncertainty on Nichols' part.\n\nAt voir dire, Nichols had answered the two questions\nposed by the court regarding the jurors' willingness to\nsentence a defendant to death in a manner seemingly\nfavorable to the prosecution:\n\n                               16\n\f       Q: Do you have any conscientious scruples against\n       finding a verdict of guilty where the punishment might\n       be death or against imposing the death penalty even if\n       the evidence should so warrant?\n\n       A: No.\n\n       Q: Regardless of any personal beliefs or feelings that\n       you may have, if the evidence justified it, would you be\n       able to find a person guilty of murder in the first\n       degree and would you be able to impose the death\n       penalty.\n\n       A: I think so.\n\nApp. at 226-227. A prospective white juror, Angelo LePore,\nprovided the exact same answers to the court's questions,\nyet he was not stricken and actually served on Riley's jury.\nApp. at 231-232. The record provides no basis for\ndistinguishing Nichols from LePore.\n\nMoreover, despite Nichols' alleged pause, the prosecutors\ndid not ask the trial court to remove Nichols for cause or to\ninquire further into his willingness to award the death\npenalty, even though the trial judge excused six\nvenirepersons for cause because they said they couldn't, or\nbelieved they couldn't, impose the death penalty, App. at\n234-237, 245-246, 265-271, and two more who responded\nequivocally, App. at 273-276, 282-286. This raises the\nquestion why, if Nichols actually did pause \"a significant\npause,\" the State did not seek to have him removed for\ncause like the others. The record does not show (and the\nState does not claim) that the prosecutors ever expressed to\nthe trial court the concern that Nichols would be unwilling\nto impose the death penalty, that the court independently\nexpressed concern, or that any of the contemporaneous\nnotes kept by the prosecutors as to some of the jurors\nreflected either the existence of a pause or the concern\nabout which Liguori testified six years later. Thus, Liguori's\nexplanation is entirely unsupported by the record. See\nJohnson v. Vasquez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"629069\"><a href=\"/opinion/629069/andre-johnson-v-daniel-b-vasquez-warden/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1327</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1331 (9th Cir. 1993)\n(stating that courts are not bound to accept race-neutral\nreasons that are either unsupported by the record or\nrefuted by it).\n\n                               17\n\fSimilarly, the record offers little basis for distinguishing\nMcGuire, a prospective black juror who was struck, from\nReed, a white juror who served without challenge by the\nState. Liguori testified that he struck McGuire because\nMcGuire asked to be excused from jury service and he\nfeared that McGuire would be an inattentive juror. 6 Liguori,\nwho claimed to remember Nichols' pause six years later\nwithout benefit of any assistance, testified that he had no\nrecollection at all regarding Reed. Liguori's notes from voir\ndire, however, state that Reed \"works Lowe's, wants off,\"\nApp. at 823, which strongly suggests that Reed too was\nlikely to be an inattentive juror. Yet at no point during voir\ndire did the prosecution ever express any concern over\nReed's place on the jury. Based on this record evidence,\nthere is no basis for distinguishing between McGuire's\ndesire to be excused and Reed's desire to be excused.\n\nAlthough the State strains to distinguish the two jurors\nby arguing that McGuire's desire to be excused from jury\nservice was stronger than Reed's desire because McGuire's\nemployer had intervened to seek his release, its effort is not\npersuasive. First, Liguori did not testify before the hearing\njudge that this was the basis for the strike; in fact, Liguori\ntestified to the opposite -- that McGuire himself had asked\nto be excused from jury service. Second, even if McGuire\nwould have been inattentive for work-related reasons, the\nprosecution's notes from voir dire connecting Reed's\nemployment to his \"wants off \" suggest that Reed's desire to\nbe excused from jury service may have been work-related\nas well. Third, there is no evidence in the record to suggest\nthat a juror will be more inattentive because s/he wants to\nbe off the jury for work-related reasons rather than for\nother reasons, which is the basis for the State's position\nthat McGuire's desire to be excused was stronger than\nReed's desire to \"want[ ] off,\" documented in Liguori's\ncontemporaneous notes.\n\nWith regard to both Nichols and McGuire, the state\ncourts failed to mention in their opinions the weaknesses in\nthe State's explanations, and therefore failed to complete\nthe required step three Batson inquiry.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6. In fact, McGuire testified at the post-conviction hearing that he never\nasked to be excused from the jury.\n\n                               18\n\f6. Statistical Evidence\n\nIn addition to Riley's challenge to the State's explanations\nat the post-conviction hearing for striking Nichols and\nMcGuire by pointing to inconsistencies in the record, Riley\nintroduced evidence that the prosecution used its\nperemptory challenges to strike every prospective black\njuror in the three other first degree murder trials occurring\nin Kent County within one year of Riley's trial. It did so\nboth for the other black murder defendant and the two\nwhite murder defendants.7 In these four trials (including\nRiley's), the prosecution struck all 8 prospective black\njurors who were called, i.e., 100%. By contrast, the\nprosecution used its peremptory challenges to strike only\n23 of the 71 prospective white jurors, or 32%. After the\nprosecution used its peremptory challenges to strike 23\nwhites, 8 blacks, 1 Indian, and 2 jurors of unidentified\nrace, the remaining racial makeup of the actual jurors in\nthe four trials was 48 white jurors. See Letter to this Court\nfrom Thomas J. Allingham II (Dec. 16, 1999), Ex. A (on file\nin the Clerk's office).\n\nAn amateur with a pocket calculator can calculate the\nnumber of blacks that would have served had the State\nused its strikes in a racially proportionate manner. In the\nfour capital cases there was a total of 82 potential jurors on\nthe venires who were not removed for cause, of whom eight,\nor 9.76%, were black. If the prosecution had used its\nperemptory challenges in a manner proportional to the\npercentage of blacks in the overall venire, then only 3 of the\n34 jurors peremptorily struck (8.82%) would have been\nblack and 5 of the 48 actual jurors (10.42%) would have\nbeen black. Instead, none of the 48 jurors were black.\n\nAdmittedly, there was no statistical analysis of these\nfigures presented by either side in the post-conviction\nproceeding. But is it really necessary to have a\nsophisticated analysis by a statistician to conclude that\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n7. The exclusion by the Kent County prosecutor of all black jurors in the\ntrials of the two white defendants is relevant to establishing a pattern\nof\nrace-based use of peremptories. See Powers v. Ohio, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112570\"><a href=\"/opinion/112570/powers-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">400</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1991)\n(excluding jurors on the basis of race is unconstitutional regardless of\nthe race of the defendant).\n\n                               19\n\fthere is little chance of randomly selecting four consecutive\nall white juries? The State never argued before the hearing\njudge and does not argue before this court that the\nselection of four consecutive all white juries could have\nbeen due to pure chance. Nor does it suggest that Riley's\nevidence does not accurately represent Kent County\nprosecutorial practices. Moreover, not once has the State\noffered an explanation for its use of peremptory challenges\nto strike all prospective black jurors in the four consecutive\ncapital cases. The State has never sought to explain the\ndata by variables other than race. Nor has it sought to\nrebut Riley's evidence.\n\nThe failure of the State to produce evidence from other\ntrials is significant because it was the State, not Riley, that\nwould have had access to such evidence, it was the State\nthat asserted that such evidence was available and\nforthcoming, and it was the State, not Riley, that failed to\nprovide it. Yet again, neither the hearing judge in his\nopinion nor the Delaware Supreme Court discussed Riley's\nevidence that showed the systematic exclusion of blacks\nfrom the petit juries in Delaware. In fact, having stated that\nthis evidence was introduced to demonstrate that\"the\nexercise of the peremptory challenges in this particular case\nfollowed some kind of pattern that exists in the\nprosecutorial actions in first degree murder cases involving\nminority defendants,\" App. at 872, the hearing judge\ndiscussed neither the statistics nor the State's failure to\nexplain them. Thus, once again by overlooking and ignoring\na significant segment of Riley's evidence, the hearing\njudge's opinion does not satisfy the crucial third step of the\nBatson analysis.\n\n7. Analysis\n\nAt the conclusion of the evidentiary post-conviction\nhearing, the hearing judge issued a written opinion in\nwhich he addressed the prosecutors' reasons for striking\nthe three black jurors, as required by step three of the\nBatson inquiry. He stated:\n\n       The State in this case provided race-neutral\n       explanations for the peremptory challenges on all three\n       black jurors. After examining the demeanor and\n\n                               20\n\f       credibility of the witnesses and prosecutors at the\n       evidentiary hearing, I believe the State exercised its\n       peremptory challenges entirely within the strictures of\n       the Fourteenth Amendment. No factual basis exists for\n       a successful claim of an equal protection violation. The\n       State successfully rebutted any prima facie showing of\n       discrimination in jury selection based upon race.\n\nRiley IV, App. at 890-891. This determination that the\nprosecutors did not intend to discriminate on the basis of\nrace in exercising their peremptory strikes against the three\nchallenged jurors is a factual finding entitled to a\npresumption of correctness unless one of the exceptions in\nS 2254(d) (1988) applies. See Hernandez v. New York, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112601\"><a href=\"/opinion/112601/hernandez-v-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">352</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 365-66 (1991).\n\nThe inquiry required by Batson must be focused on the\ndistinctions actually offered by the State in the state court,\nnot on all possible distinctions we can hypothesize.

As to both Nichols and McGuire, the\nhearing judge merely repeated Liguori's articulated\nexplanations without any reference to, or analysis of, Riley's\nevidence of pretext and seems to have accepted the State's\njustifications at face value.\n\nLiguori simply testified that he struck McGuire because\nhe would be inattentive at trial, and for no other reason, a\njustification that would apply equally to Reed. The State\ngave no explanation as to Reed other than Liguori's plain\nlack of memory. Cf. Harrison v.

It may be that such\nevidence, standing alone, would not be sufficient to show\nintentional discrimination in selection of juries by the Kent\nCounty Prosecutor's office in the year in question. It is,\nhowever, particularly troublesome because the State failed\n\n                                23\n\fto provide the rebuttal data as to Riley's evidence when\ngiven the opportunity which it requested.

It stated, \"Proof of systematic exclusion from the\nvenire raises an inference of purposeful discrimination\nbecause the `result bespeaks discrimination.' \" Batson, 476\nU.S. at 94-95 (quoting Hernandez v.

On the record before us, it is difficult to\navoid drawing the inference that the Kent County\nProsecutor followed a pattern of using peremptory\nchallenges in a racially discriminatory manner. 8\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n8. The pattern is relevant even if Riley has not undertaken to prove a\nBatson violation in the other three trials. Defendants Daniel Pregent and\nJudith McBride were both tried before Batson was decided, and thus\nwere not likely to have raised a Batson objection, particularly since\nneither was black and the Supreme Court did not extend the Batson\nholding to apply regardless of whether the defendant and excluded juror\nwere of the same race until its opinion in Powers v. Ohio, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112570\"><a href=\"/opinion/112570/powers-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">400</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(1991).

The\nquestionable nature of Liguori's explanations for the strikes\nof McGuire and Nichols must be evaluated not only in light\nof the uncontested evidence of the use of peremptory\nstrikes in Kent County but also in light of the nature of the\nState's pre-Batson defense on direct appeal.\n\nWhen Riley's direct appeal came before the Delaware\nSupreme Court in 1984, the State justified the use of race\nin selecting jurors in criminal trials. On that occasion,\nwhich was the State's first opportunity to defend the use of\nits peremptory challenges in Riley's trial, the State did not\noffer a single race-neutral explanation, not even as an\nalternate argument; instead, it claimed that it was\npermissible -- even socially desirable -- to exclude jurors\nbased on what it called \"group association,\" App. at 896,\nwhich a Justice of the Delaware Supreme Court was\nreported to have recognized as a \"euphemism for race,\"\nApp. at 1321. In its brief to the Delaware Supreme Court,\nthe State interpreted Swain v. Alabama, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106997\"><a href=\"/opinion/106997/swain-v-alabama/\"><span class=\"volume\">380</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">202</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(1965), as \"recogniz[ing] how peremptory challenges, even\nthose exercised on the basis of group association, foster the\nconstitutional goal of an impartial jury.\" App. at 896. The\nState added in a footnote that it \"emphatically denies that\nthe prosecutor [in Riley's case] exercised any of his\nchallenges solely on the assumption that the juror's race, in\nthe context of the facts of this case, indicated a verdict\nposition adverse to the prosecution. Rather, the State will\nargue that even if such was the case, no constitutional\ncommand would have been contravened.\" App. at 896\n(emphasis added).\n_________________________________________________________________\n\ncomposition of the jury in the state courts and thus the racial makeup\nof the venire was not available when this court decided the appeal. See\nDeputy, 19 F.3d at 1491-93. Moreover, the Supreme Court in Batson\nmade clear that \"a defendant may make a prima facie showing of\npurposeful racial discrimination in selection of the venire by relying\nsolely on the facts concerning its selection in his case.\" Batson, 486\nU.S.\nat 95 (emphasis in original).\n\n                               25\n\fBefore this court, the State contends that Swain was\n\"good law\" at the time, so reliance on that case cannot be\nviewed as a concession that some of its peremptory\nchallenges may not have been race-neutral. Tr. of Oral\nArgument at 31. Yet, significant for purposes here is that in\nresponse to Riley's challenge to its use of peremptories, the\nState never denied on direct appeal that race played a role\nin its use of peremptory challenges; it only claimed that it\ndid not exercise them solely based on race. Its justification\nfor that practice certainly suggests that race was at least a\npartial basis for its use of peremptory challenges. And that\nsuggestion further supports the conclusion we are led to by\nour earlier analysis of the record that the State's proffered\nrace-neutral explanations are pretextual.\n\nThe requirement that we defer to the State's findings of\nfact does not apply when those findings are not supported\nby probative evidence. The State's position is that under\nS 2254(d) \"all that is required\" is that the state court make\nfindings of fact, and flatly states that because the hearing\njudge did so, we must defer. Tr. of Oral Argument at 41.\nAlthough the State concedes that we must concern\nourselves under Rushen, 464 U.S. at 121 n.6, with whether\nthere is probative evidence in the record to support the\nstate court's findings, it then seems to argue that since the\nfindings are primarily based on credibility determinations,\nthe mere fact that Liguori testified is sufficiently probative\nto support these determinations.\n\nCertainly it is not required that a federal court should\ndefer to a state court's findings of fact on habeas review as\nlong as the state court accepted the prosecutor's race-\nneutral explanation, no matter how incredible,\ncontradicted, and implausible it may be. On the contrary,\nseveral courts of appeals have acknowledged that the\ntraditional level of deference should not govern appellate\nreview when a prosecutor's explanations are obviously not\ncredible. See McClain, 217 F.3d at 1221 (\" `[I]mplausible or\nfantastic justifications may (and probably will) be found to\nbe pretexts for purposeful discrimination.' \") (quoting\nPurkett, 514 U.S. at 768); United States v.

Such deference is\nordinarily based, at least in part, on the original trial\ncourt's ability to make contemporaneous assessments. See\nHernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. at 365. Recently, the\nCourt of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit deferred to the state\ncourt's findings on a Batson claim precisely because the\ncourt had that opportunity. It explained,\n\n       Indeed, it would be an impermissible exercise in\n       hindsight for us now to upset the trial court's\n       credibility determination in evaluating the prosecutor's\n       explanation. And as the district court correctly\n       observed, the `retrospective parsing of the `curricula\n       vitae' of the jurors' is no substitute for the observations\n       of the trial judge, who witnessed first-hand the\n       process. We simply cannot overlook the fact that the\n       trial court had conducted an extensive voir dire of the\n       jury pool, which was documented in several hundred\n       pages of trial transcripts, and was able to observe the\n       demeanor and hear the responses of the prospective\n       jurors in court. This insight enabled the trial court to\n       compare the prosecutor's explanation with what\n       occurred at the bench and in open court. Most\n       significantly, the trial court was able to observe the\n       prosecutor's demeanor and conduct and evaluate the\n       credibility of his explanation.\n\nEvans v. Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769640\"><a href=\"/opinion/769640/vernon-lee-evans-jr-v-willie-smith-warden-united-states-penitentiary/\"><span class=\"volume\">220</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">306</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 316 (4th Cir. 2000)\n(emphases added).\n\nIt may be that because the findings at issue here were\nmade by the hearing judge six years after the State had\nexercised its peremptory challenges before the trial judge\nand the hearing judge neither witnessed the challenges\nfirst-hand nor examined the witnesses at the time the\n\n                                27\n\fchallenges were exercised, he did not note or comment on\nsome of the troublesome inconsistencies in the State's race-\nneutral explanations.\n\nDeference in a Batson case must be viewed in the context\nof the requirement that the state courts engage in the\nthree-step Batson inquiry. As the Court of Appeals for the\nFourth Circuit described step three: \"If [the State's] burden\n[under step two] is met, the court then addresses and\nevaluates all evidence introduced by each side (including all\nevidence introduced in the first and second steps) that\ntends to show that race was or was not the real reason and\ndetermines whether the defendant has met his burden of\npersuasion.\" McMillon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"661478\"><a href=\"/opinion/661478/united-states-v-julia-mcmillon-aka-julia-walker-aka-julia-bivens/\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">948</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 953 n.4 (4th Cir.\n1994); see also Jordan, 206 F.3d at 200 (stating that step\nthree of Batson inquiry requires examination of \"all the\nfacts and circumstances\") (quotation omitted).\n\nHere, the state courts failed to examine all of the\nevidence to determine whether the State's proffered race-\nneutral explanations were pretextual. Not only is there no\nindication on the record that the hearing judge engaged in\nthe required analysis, but there is no indication that the\nDelaware Supreme Court did so, by making findings which\nalso would have been entitled to deference. See Sumner v.\nMata, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110382\"><a href=\"/opinion/110382/sumner-v-mata/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">539</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 547 (1981). The omission of the crucial\nstep of evaluating the State's proffered explanations in light\nof all the evidence can be gleaned by the absence of the\nword \"pretext\" in both the opinion of the hearing judge and\nin the opinion of the Delaware Supreme Court. Nor is there\nany language in either opinion that suggests, whatever the\nwords used, that either court recognized the nature of the\nanalysis it was required to undertake. In Jones v. Ryan, we\nnoted that the state court decision rejecting a Batson claim\ncontained no factual findings relating to the different\nprongs of the Batson analysis, to which we could accord a\npresumption of correctness. See 987 F.2d at 965-66. The\nsituation before us is similar.\n\nThe State argues that our concern with the hearing\njudge's failure to discuss critical evidence in his decision is\nmerely a complaint about the manner in which he wrote his\nopinion. It states in its supplemental brief that\"[i]t may\nwell have been better for the state judge to have further\n\n                               28\n\fexplained his decision . . . [b]ut the federal habeas statutes\ndo not set standards for the writing of opinions by state\njudges.\" Supp. Memo. of Appellees at 7.\n\nBut the concern is not how the decision was written, a\ntrifling matter. It is the failure of the state courts to\ncomplete the required Batson analysis by comparing the\nstricken black jurors with the sitting white jurors,\nacknowledging the statistical evidence of striking all black\njurors in capital murder cases in Kent County within a year\nof Riley's trial, and recognizing the State's position in this\nvery case that use of peremptories for racial reasons was\nboth constitutional and socially beneficial.\n\nComparable to the case before us is the decision in\nCoulter v. Gilmore, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"757816\"><a href=\"/opinion/757816/dwayne-coulter-v-jerry-gilmore/\"><span class=\"volume\">155</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">912</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th Cir. 1998). There the\ncourt acknowledged that deference is owed to the state\ncourt findings under S 2254(d), but rejected those findings\nand refused to apply the presumption of correctness\nbecause \"the state judge made those findings without ever\ntaking into account the totality of the circumstances on the\nrecord.\" Id. at 920. It noted that Batson requires \"that, one\nway or another, a trial court . . . consider all relevant\ncircumstances before it issues a final ruling on a\ndefendant's motion.\" Id. at 921. In a compelling statement\nof the court's role under step three of the Batson inquiry,\nthe court wrote:\n\n       In light of the deferential standard of the post-AEDPA\n       S 2254 and the perfunctory quality of the second step\n       of a Batson inquiry after Purkett v. Elem, it is more\n       important today than ever that the Batson inquiry not\n       omit consideration of the totality of the circumstances,\n       both for itself and as it relates to the evaluation of\n       similarly situated potential jurors. . . . Under the pre-\n       AEDPA standards that apply here, we agree with the\n       district court that [defendant's] rights under Batson\n       were denied.\n\nId. at 921-22.\n\nThe state courts in this case rejected Riley's Batson claim\nwithout discussing any of the ample evidence that throws\ninto question the explanations offered by the prosecutor for\nstriking two of the black jurors and there is nothing\n\n                               29\n\frelevant in the record that might otherwise support the\nstate courts' decisions. Thus, we do not know why the state\ncourts found the State's explanation was plausible and\ncredible in light of the other evidence. It is because of the\nstate courts' omission of a requirement under the third step\nof the Batson inquiry -- of an ultimate determination on the\nissue of discriminatory intent based on all the facts and\ncircumstances -- that the State's argument founders.\n\nWe cannot avoid noting that Batson was not a death\npenalty case. This is. If the State failed to accord Riley his\nconstitutional right to a jury selected on a race-neutral\nbasis, we must not shirk to so hold. As Riley's lawyer asked\nat oral argument, \"If not this case, what case? If the\nevidence in this case is insufficient to show that the\nprosecutors' race-neutral rationales were pretextual, what\ncase, short of a prosecutorial mea culpa would do the job?\"\nTr. of Oral Argument at 3.\n\nAfter consideration of all the arguments and the record,\nwe are compelled to conclude that the prosecution violated\nRiley's constitutional rights under Batson, and that Riley is\nentitled to relief.\n\n8. The Dissenting Opinion -- The Batson Issue\n\nIt is fitting to discuss the Dissenting Opinion at this point\nbecause our difference with the Dissent is most acute in\nour respective views of the requirements of step three of the\nBatson inquiry. Although the Dissent takes issue with\nmuch of the majority opinion, its principal argument is that\nin a habeas case the federal court must defer to the state\ncourts' findings, in this case the finding that the prosecutor\ndid not use the State's peremptory challenges striking black\njurors in a manner that violated the principles of Batson.\nWe have already discussed in detail when a state court's\nfindings are entitled to deference and when they are not,\nfocusing on the exception in S 2254(d)(8) for the situation\nwhere the state court's findings are \"not fairly supported by\nthe record.\" See supra Part II.A.4 (Standard of Review). It is\nmanifest that a finding that Batson has been satisfied must\nbe made in accordance with the process enunciated in that\ncase.\n\n                               30\n\fThe Dissent agrees that under step three of the Batson\ninquiry a judge or court must consider \"all of the relevant\nevidence that has been adduced.\" See Dis. Op. at 88. As we\npreviously discussed, the courts after Batson have\ndescribed step three as requiring the judge or court to\nexamine the prosecutor's proffered reasons for striking the\nminority jurors against the evidence presented by the\ndefendant and/or the weaknesses in the prosecutor's\nreasons. See, e.g., McMillon, 14 F.3d at 953 n.4; Jordan,\n206 F.3d at 200. The Dissent sees no reason to believe that\nthe Delaware courts did not do so in Riley's case, even\nthough the opinions of the Delaware courts rejecting Riley's\nBatson challenges never commented on the weaknesses in\nthe State's case or, even more important, never\nacknowledged that there was a step three to the Batson\ninquiry. We, therefore, proceed to try to ascertain whether\nthe hearing judge and the Delaware Supreme Court made\ntheir findings that there was no purposeful discrimination\nin accordance with the process required by Batson. If not,\nthen deference to those findings is not appropriate.\n\nThe extent of the Delaware courts' recognition of the need\nto engage in the step three inquiry is open to question on\nthis record. Nothing in the discussion of the hearing judge\nsuggests that the court performed the necessary evaluation.\nSee Riley IV, App. at 887-91. The hearing judge, using\nlanguage taken from Riley I rather than Batson, understood\nthat his obligation was to consider the prosecutor's\nproffered explanation for striking the jurors and\"then . . .\nbe satisfied by that neutral explanation and make a ruling\nto that effect.\" App. at 888. Accordingly, following what he\nunderstood to be the applicable law, the hearing judge\ndiscussed the prosecutor's proffered reasons for the two\nstrikes at issue here, and found that the prosecutor was\ncredible. See App. at 889 (\"the State provided a credible,\nrace-neutral reason for exercising its peremptory\nchallenge\") (emphasis added); id. (\"The State articulated a\nspecific race-neutral ground for challenging juror McGuire.\n. . .\") (emphasis added). Throughout, the hearing judge\nmade clear that he understood that \"[t]he test applied is the\ncredibility of the explanation given . . . .\" App. at 890.\nNothing in the hearing judge's discussion suggests that he\nundertook an evaluation of the proffered reasons in light of\n\n                               31\n\fthe evidence submitted by Riley, which is the essence of\nstep three.\n\nIt is even more questionable whether on appeal from that\ndecision the Delaware Supreme Court fully appreciated the\nrequirement. Its entire discussion of this issue is fully set\nforth in the margin.9 In this one paragraph, the Court relied\non its 1985 decision on Riley's direct appeal where it\nrejected Riley's challenge to the State's peremptory\nchallenges. Riley I, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1958976\"><a href=\"/opinion/1958976/riley-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">496</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">997</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Del. 1985). The 1985\ndecision is noteworthy because on that occasion (a year\nbefore Batson), the Delaware Supreme Court concluded, for\nthe first time, that \"use of peremptory challenges to exclude\nprospective jurors solely upon the basis of race violates a\ncriminal defendant's right under Del. Const., Art. I, S 7 to a\ntrial by an impartial jury.\" Riley I, 496 A.2d at 1012.\n\nIn Riley I, the Court also set out the procedure to be\nfollowed10 but nothing in the Delaware Court's laudable\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n9. The Court stated:\n\n         Riley's next contention, that the State exercised its peremptory\n         challenges for racial reasons, we find to be simply a renewed\n         attempt to reopen previously settled issues. In Riley I, [</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1958976\"><a href=\"/opinion/1958976/riley-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">496</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">997</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n         (Del. 1985)], we set forth a legal analysis functionally identical\nto the\n       Supreme Court's analysis later articulated in Batson, 476 U.S. at\n       79. In Riley I, we found that Riley's constitutional right to an\n       impartial jury had not been violated. 496 A.2d at 1009. The\n       Superior Court, after an evidentiary hearing on Riley's motion for\n       postconviction relief, held that Riley had not been denied equal\n       protection as a result of the State's use of peremptory challenges.\n       The court found that the State had provided race-neutral\n       explanations for its peremptory challenges. We find no error in\n       Superior Court's rejection of Riley's Batson claim. See Holland v.\n       Illinois, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112358\"><a href=\"/opinion/112358/holland-v-illinois/\"><span class=\"volume\">493</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">474</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1990) (the Sixth Amendment fair cross-\nsection\n       requirement of an impartial jury does not deprive a party of the\nright\n       to exercise peremptory challenges on racial or any other grounds\n       from a venire that otherwise meets Sixth Amendment cross-sectional\n       standards of representativeness). Moreover, we reaffirm our earlier\n       decision sustaining the State's peremptory challenges on state\n       constitutional grounds. Riley I, 496 A.2d at 1010-1013.\n\nRiley V, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1486590\"><a href=\"/opinion/1486590/riley-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">585</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">719</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 725 (Del. 1990).\n\n10. That procedure required that the defendant make a prima facie\nshowing after which the trial judge\n\f32\n\fdecision requires an inquiry comparable to the Batson step\nthree. The Delaware cases at that time appear to have\nrequired that the prosecutor provide, or articulate, a race-\nneutral reason for the peremptory challenges, and that the\ncourt find the prosecutor to be credible. They do not require\nan evaluation comparable to step three. Therefore, if, as it\nappears, the Delaware Supreme Court in Riley IV rejected\nRiley's Batson claim by relying on its earlier opinion in Riley\nI, and the Riley I opinion did not require a step three\ninquiry, any assumption that the Court engaged in such an\ninquiry would be unwarranted. Or, to phrase it somewhat\ndifferently, if the state courts' findings to which the Dissent\nwould defer were not made in accordance with the process\nrequired by the United States Supreme Court, deference is\nnot required.\n\nThis digression into Delaware law was undertaken to\nprovide the context in which to view the Dissent's\nsubsidiary argument, which is that we should assume that\nthe Delaware courts performed the step three analysis and\nthat it was not necessary for the Delaware courts to\ncomment on that analysis. We do not suggest that every\nstate court decision that is the subject of a habeas review\nbe as explicit as a Social Security Administrative Law\nJudge's decision. See Dis. Op. at 89. But Batson is not a\ndisability case. Although a judge considering a Batson\nchallenge is not required to comment explicitly on every\npiece of evidence in the record, some engagement with the\nevidence considered is necessary as part of step three of the\nBatson inquiry.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n       determine[s] whether there is a substantial likelihood that the\n       prosecutor is exercising the State's peremptory challenges on the\n       basis of race. A ruling in favor of the State will end any further\n       inquiry. A ruling in favor of the defendant, however, will shift\nthe\n       burden to the State to prove that the exercised challenges were not\n       racially motivated. To sustain this burden, the State . . . must\n       satisfy the court that its peremptory challenges were made on\n       grounds of specific, individual juror bias, or on grounds\nreasonably\n       related to the particular case or trial . . . and not solely on the\n       ground of the juror's race.\n\nRiley I, 496 A.2d at 1013 (quotation and citation omitted).\n\n                               33\n\fIn United States v.

The court stated, in language that could be\nequally applicable here, that \"[t]he record before us\nindicates nothing about the district court's thought\nprocesses in its step three analysis apart from its abrupt\nconclusion indicating the apparent view that the\nprosecutor's asserted justification outweighed [the\ndefendant's] showing under the totality of circumstances.\"\nId. at 342. And in Hill, unlike here, the trial court ruling on\nthe Batson claim at least stated that it performed some sort\nof weighing analysis.\n\nAlthough both of these cases came to the Court of\nAppeals on direct appeal of a district court decision rather\nthan on habeas review of a state decision, that does not\ndetract from the force of the court's understanding of what\nis required in a Batson inquiry. The process required by\nBatson, including step three, does not differ if the\nprosecutor used the peremptories to strike jurors in a state\ntrial or in a federal trial. After all, the same Constitution\napplies to both fora.\n\nThe Dissent relies almost exclusively on the statutory\npresumption of correctness owed to a state court's factual\ndetermination made after a hearing on the merits. This\ndeference is indeed the fulcrum on which our federalism\nturns. Yet in case after case -- and most particularly in\ncapital cases -- we have found that even applying the more\nstringent post-AEDPA standard of review (not applicable\nhere), there are reasons not to accord the usual deference\nto the state courts' findings.

Dis. Op. at 87. However, as we have\nexplained, without any such statement there is no basis on\nthis record to determine if the state courts undertook, or\neven were aware of, the required Batson step three inquiry.\nThe Fourth Circuit expressed the same thought in United\nStates v.

We take this opportunity, however, to remark\nupon the manner in which the Dissent comments upon the\nreference to the pattern of the State's use of its\nperemptories to exclude black jurors in all four first degree\nmurder cases, including Riley's, tried in the county the\nsame year. Because of the lack of information about some\nof those cases, we refrained from suggesting that such\nevidence, standing alone, would show intentional\ndiscrimination but pointed out that it was the State that\nsought an opportunity to produce supplementary evidence.\nThe following correspondence, which was preceded by the\noral dialogue quoted previously in its opinion, supra at\ntypescript page 18, clarifies the situation.\n\nOn January 9, 1989, the hearing judge wrote to counsel:\n\n        This will confirm the conclusion of the postconviction\n       relief hearing in the above-captioned matter. It is the\n       Court's understanding that the defendant's\n       presentation and all rebuttal by the State available on\n       the date of the hearing has been completed. However,\n       at the State's request, the Court did hold the record\n       open on the hearing to be supplemented by a rebuttal\n       summary of jury composition in State peremptory\n       challenges in first degree murder trials in Kent County\n       over a determined period of time if the State wished to\n       supplement the record.\n\n        Further, the hearing record will close on January 30,\n       1989; the Court expects proposed findings of fact and\n       conclusions of law from both parties no later than\n       February 6, 1989.\n\nSee Letter to this Court from Thomas J. Allingham II (Dec.\n16, 1999), Ex. B (on file in the Clerk's office) (emphasis\nadded).\n\nSome three weeks later, on January 27, 1989, and just\nbefore the hearing record was to close, the State advised\nthe court as follows:\n\n        Please be advised that the State will not supplement\n       the record of the post conviction relief hearing held in\n       the above-captioned matter on December 30, 1988.\n\nId.\n\n                                37\n\fThus the State, which had assured the court that\nmaterials from other cases \"do exist\" that would be contrary\nto Riley's representation, App. at 874, and having been\ngiven the opportunity that it requested to supplement the\nrecord with evidence as to jury composition, surprisingly\nand without explanation, declined to produce evidence that\nblacks served on juries in first degree murder cases in the\ncounty in the same period that Riley was tried before an all-\nwhite jury. The presumption that could be drawn from\nthese facts is one of the circumstances that should have\nbeen evaluated by the Delaware courts in the required step\nthree inquiry.\n\nThe Dissent comments that Riley offered no expert\nanalysis of the statistics. The procedural posture of the\ncase at that time provided no such opportunity. Riley\nproduced evidence of the statistics of the racial composition\nof the jurors in the four cases, the State requested the\nadditional time to provide counter-evidence, and the\nhearing judge left the record open for that purpose. There\nwould have been no basis for expert analysis until all the\nevidence as to jury composition was produced. The State's\nletter that it would produce no evidence was dated three\ndays before the record closed.\n\nFurther, the Dissent's attempt to analogize the statistical\nevidence of the use of peremptory challenges to strike black\njurors to the percent of left-handed presidents requires\nsome comment. The dissent has overlooked the obvious fact\nthat there is no provision in the Constitution that protects\npersons from discrimination based on whether they are\nright-handed or left handed. To suggest any comparability\nto the striking of jurors based on their race is to minimize\nthe history of discrimination against prospective black\njurors and black defendants, which was the raison d'etre of\nthe Batson decision.\n\nTo reiterate, the factual findings of a state court are\nentitled to deference only when there is \"probative evidence\nunderlying [its] conclusion.\" See Rushen, 464 U.S. at 122\nn.6. The Dissent points to no such probative evidence. It\nrelies merely on the credibility finding of the hearing judge,\na finding that we cannot be sure was made following\nconsideration of all the evidence presented by Riley and the\n\n                               38\n\fweaknesses he pointed to in the prosecutor's proffered\nreasons.\n\n9. Appropriate Remedy\n\nWhen counsel for the State was asked at the en banc\nargument whether, if this court were to find a Batson\nviolation, the State would rather the relief be the grant of a\nnew trial or the remand for a federal evidentiary hearing,\ncounsel candidly responded:\n\n        MR. MEYERS: If we -- the answer is yes. If, and if we\n       -- I mean, if the court imagines, has all these problems\n       with the hearing that was done six years after the trial,\n       those problems are simply going to be magnified,\n       amplified by exponential order of magnitude 20 years\n       after the trial. I mean if you think that people have\n       memory problems six years, how much worse are you\n       going to be 20 years later?\n\nTr. of Oral Argument at 46. Riley's counsel concurred,\nstating that a federal habeas judge would be no better off\nthan the hearing judge was in 1988.\n\nWe agree. Much of the Dissent's opposition is directed to\nthe majority's failure to remand to the District Court for a\nhearing but the Dissent may have overlooked that both\nparties preferred a new trial to a remand should this court\nfind that the state proceedings were not shown to be\nconsistent with the requirement of Batson. It is highly\nunlikely that the witnesses can provide more illuminating\ntestimony thirteen years later. Moreover, there are no\nfactual issues that can be solved by a federal evidentiary\nhearing.12 Although the Dissent chooses to characterize the\nresult in this case as a federal court's substitution of its\nown findings for those of the state court, in fact we are\nmerely fulfilling the traditional role of a federal habeas\ncourt, which is, in part, to determine whether the state\ncourt's decision is \"fairly supported by the record.\" The one\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n12.

Beyer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"604136\"><a href=\"/opinion/604136/ali-abdul-habib-hakeem-aka-thomas-wooten-v-howard-l-beyer-attorney/\"><span class=\"volume\">990</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">750</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d\nCir. 1993), where we held that the state court's finding regarding the\ndelay in the proceedings was not entitled to the presumption of\ncorrectness but directed the district court to determine in a federal\nhabeas evidentiary hearing the reason for the delay.\n\n                                39\n\fpossible factual issue cannot be resolved by a hearing,13\nand the statistical evidence, which might be the subject of\nsome analysis at such a hearing, is relevant but not\ndispositive to our decision.\n\nThe question of the remedy a habeas court should order\nfollowing a finding that the state process did not comply\nwith constitutional requirements is not a new one. In\nBrown v. Kelly, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"589660\"><a href=\"/opinion/589660/larry-brown-v-walter-kelly-superintendent-attica-correctional-facility/\"><span class=\"volume\">973</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">116</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2d Cir. 1992), the federal\ncourt of appeals was faced with a comparable situation as\nthat before us. Defendant was convicted in state court of\nmurder and first degree robbery. He eventually came to the\nfederal court with a petition for a writ of habeas corpus,\nclaiming, inter alia, a violation of Batson. The federal courts\ndid not find that Batson had been violated but the Second\nCircuit took the opportunity to consider the appropriate\nremedy when a constitutional violation is found by the\nfederal courts sitting in habeas. The court stated,\"[T]here\nare cases where the passage of time may impair a trial\ncourt's ability to make a reasoned determination of the\nprosecutor's state of mind when the jury was selected.\nWhere such demonstrably exists, there must be a new\ntrial.\" Id. at 121.\n\nThe Brown court cited United States v. Alcantar, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"537260\"><a href=\"/opinion/537260/united-states-v-guadalupe-alcantar/\"><span class=\"volume\">897</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 438-39 (9th Cir. 1990) (ordering a new trial because\nthere was inadequate evidence to determine, as part of\nBatson analysis, why the jurors were struck). And in\nBarnes, 202 F.3d at 157, the Court of Appeals ordered a\nnew trial rather than a remand for a hearing on the Batson\nissues because the trial judge had died and the court was\n\"not confident . . . that further proceedings would . . . shed\nreliable light upon the voir dire.\") (quotation omitted).\n\nThe circumstances of this case are closely analogous to\nthose in Hardcastle v. Horn, ___ F. Supp. 2d ___, 2001 WL\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n13. Although neither party has focused on it, there is an apparent\nfactual discrepancy between McGuire's testimony that he did not request\nto be excused, App. at 850, and the trial judge's statement that McGuire\ncame to see him and requested to be excused, App. at 250. It is agreed\nthat McGuire saw the trial judge, but McGuire testified it was at the\njudge's direction. As the trial judge is deceased, a federal evidentiary\nhearing would not resolve this issue, even if it were important to do so.\n\n                               40\n\f722781 (E.D. Pa., June 27, 2001), where the district court\nfound a Batson violation but dismissed the notion of\nordering a federal evidentiary hearing instead of a new trial\nin state court, commenting that \"[n]early twenty years have\npassed since Petitioner's trial, such a length of time that\neven Respondents admit that an evidentiary hearing on\nPetitioner's Batson claim is unlikely to be helpful.\" Id. at\n*19. The Hardcastle court stated that \"[a] new trial is\nespecially appropriate where as here, the passage of time\nmakes a new evidentiary hearing on the petition\nimpossible.\" Id.14 Likewise, we see no reason to order the\nDistrict Court to provide Riley with an evidentiary hearing\nthat it declined to provide on two prior occasions. Instead,\nwe will reverse the District Court's order denying Riley's\npetition for a writ of habeas corpus, and remand for the\nDistrict Court to grant the writ without prejudice to the\nState retrying the case pursuant to the guidelines to be set\nby the District Court.\n\nB.\n\nTHE CALDWELL CLAIM\n\nIn addition to Riley's Batson claim presented to the en\nbanc court, Riley argues that the prosecutor and the trial\njudge made remarks to the jury during the penalty hearing\nthat misled the jury as to its sense of responsibility in the\nsentencing process, in violation of the principles set forth in\nCaldwell v. Mississippi, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111471\"><a href=\"/opinion/111471/caldwell-v-mississippi/\"><span class=\"volume\">472</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">320</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1985). In Caldwell,\nthe Supreme Court held that prosecutorial comments at\nsentencing violated the Eighth Amendment by leading the\njury to believe that ultimate responsibility for determining\nthe appropriateness of the death sentence rested with the\nstate supreme court. See 472 U.S. at 333.\n\nThe Delaware Supreme Court, on direct appeal, rejected\nRiley's Caldwell claim, commenting that\"[i]n no sense may\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n14. The Hardcastle case is on appeal to this court, and our reference to\nthis limited aspect of the decision, which is applicable here, is not\nintended to reflect an opinion as to the merits of the District Court's\ndecision on the Batson issue.\n\n                               41\n\fit reasonably be said that the prosecutor was either\nmisstating the law, misleading the jury as to its role, or\nminimizing its sentencing responsibility.\" Riley I, 496 A.2d\nat 1025.

In reply, the\nprosecutor stated:\n\n       Ladies and gentlemen, I intend to be brief. I'm in\n       complete disagreement with the approach the defense\n       has taken. I don't think it's fair. I think it's unfair. I\n       think the lawyers know better. Now, they would have\n       you believe that you're going to kill this man and they\n       know--they know that your decision is not the final\n       decision. My God, how unfair can you be? Your job is\n       reviewable. They know it.\n\n472 U.S. at 325 (emphases added).\n\nCaldwell's defense counsel objected to this statement but\nthe trial court overruled the objection, stating that it was\n\"proper that the jury realizes it is reviewable automatically\nas the death penalty commands.\" Id. The prosecutor\ncontinued:\n\n       Throughout their remarks, they attempted to give you\n       the opposite, sparing the truth. They said `Thou shall\n       not kill.' If that applies to him, it applies to you,\n       insinuating that your decision is the final decision and\n       that they're gonna take Bobby Caldwell out in the front\n       of this Courthouse in moments and string him up and\n       that is terribly, terribly unfair. For they know, as I\n       know, and as Judge Baker has told you, that the\n       decision you render is automatically reviewable by the\n       Supreme Court. Automatically, and I think it's unfair\n       and I don't mind telling them so.\n\nId. at 325-26 (emphasis added).\n\n                                  42\n\fAlthough the jury's sentence in Caldwell was indeed\nsubject to automatic review by the state supreme court, the\nUnited States Supreme Court's plurality opinion stated that\nthe prosecutor's statement was \"inaccurate, both because it\nwas misleading as to the nature of the appellate court's\nreview and because it depicted the jury's role in a way\nfundamentally at odds with the role that a capital sentencer\nmust perform.\" Id. at 336. Justice O'Connor, who cast the\nfifth and deciding vote, emphasized that \"[j]urors may\nharbor misconceptions about the power of state appellate\ncourts or, for that matter, [the United States Supreme\nCourt] to override a jury's sentence of death.\" Id. at 342\n(O'Connor, J., concurring). According to Justice O'Connor,\nthe prosecutor's statements were impermissible because\nthey \"creat[ed] the mistaken impression that automatic\nappellate review of the jury's sentence would provide the\nauthoritative determination of whether death was\nappropriate\" whereas under state law the relevant scope of\nreview was limited to whether the verdict was \"so arbitrary\nthat it was against the overwhelming weight of the\nevidence.\" Id. at 343 (O'Connor, J., concurring) (quotation\nomitted).\n\nIn Romano v.

Accepting Justice\nO'Connor's concurrence as controlling, the Romano Court\nexplained that Caldwell prohibits prosecutorial comments\nthat \"mislead the jury as to its role in the sentencing\nprocess in a way that allows the jury to feel less responsible\nthan it should for the sentencing decision.\" Id. at 9\n(quotation omitted). Accordingly, \"[t]o establish a Caldwell\nviolation, a defendant necessarily must show that the\nremarks to the jury improperly described the role assigned\nto the jury by local law.\" Id. (quotation omitted). The Court\nsubsequently rejected Romano's Caldwell claim because\n\"the jury was not affirmatively misled regarding its role in\nthe sentencing process.\" Id.\n\nIn Riley's case, Liguori began his opening comments in\nthe penalty phase by stating:\n\n       As the Judge has explained to you we have a specific\n       statute with regard to what occurred in a penalty\n       hearing in a capital case.\n\n                               43\n\f       Let me say at the outset that what you do today is\n       automatically reviewed by our Supreme Court and that\n       is why there is an automatic review on the death\n       penalty. That is why, if you return a decision of death,\n       that is why you will receive and have to fill out a two-\n       page interrogatory that the Court will give you. This is\n       an interrogatory that specifically sets out the questions\n       that the State request and whether or not you believe\n       it beyond a reasonable doubt and if you want in your\n       determination, if you believe the sentence should be\n       death than each and every one of you has to sign this.\n       This goes to the Supreme Court. That is why it is\n       concise and we believe clear and it should be looked\n       carefully on and answered appropriately.\n\nApp. at 393 (emphases added).\n\nAt oral argument before the en banc court, the State\nconceded that Liguori's statement, at least \"on its face,\" is\nno different from that of the prosecutor in Caldwell. Tr. of\nOral Argument at 49. Counsel for the State told us that\nwhen \"[y]ou compare the two, they are pretty much alike.\"\nTr. of Oral Argument at 49. Like the statement in Caldwell,\nLiguori's statement regarding automatic appellate review\nwas technically accurate since Delaware law provided for\nautomatic review by the Delaware Supreme Court of a\njury's sentence of death. However, that automatic review\nwas extremely limited, as was that of the Mississippi\nSupreme Court in Caldwell.\n\nAt the time of Riley's sentencing hearing, the relevant\nportion of the capital sentencing statute provided:\n\n       The Supreme Court shall limit its review under this\n       section to the recommendation on and imposition of\n       the penalty of death and shall determine:\n\n       a. Whether, considering the totality of evidence in\n       aggravation and mitigation which bears upon the\n       particular circumstances or details of the offense and\n       the character and propensities of the offender, the\n       death penalty was either arbitrarily or capriciously\n       imposed or recommended . . . .\n\nDel. Code Ann. tit. 11, S 4209(g)(2) (1982) (emphasis\n\n                                44\n\fadded). Indeed, in Delaware the jury's weighing of\naggravating and mitigating circumstances was, for all\npractical purposes, final. We have found no published\nopinion during the relevant time period in which the\nDelaware Supreme Court reversed a jury's sentence of\ndeath as arbitrarily or capriciously imposed.15\n\nIt is apparent, then, that, like the prosecutor's statement\nin Caldwell, Liguori's reference to automatic appellate\nreview was misleading as to the scope of appellate review.\nAs was explained in Caldwell, jurors may not understand\nthe limited nature of appellate review, which affords\nsubstantial deference to a jury's determination that death is\nthe appropriate sentence. See 472 U.S. at 332-33.\nFurthermore, jurors who are unconvinced that death is the\nappropriate punishment but who are eager to send a\nmessage of disapproval for the defendant's acts might be\n\"very receptive to the prosecutor's assurance that [they] can\nmore freely err because the error may be corrected on\nappeal.\" Id. at 331 (quotation omitted). As one of our sister\ncircuits has explained, \"[f]or the jury to see itself as\nadvisory when it is not, or to be comforted by a belief that\nits decision will not have effect unless others make the\nsame decision, is a frustration of the essence of the jury\nfunction.\" Sawyer v. Butler, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"527548\"><a href=\"/opinion/527548/robert-sawyer-v-robert-h-butler-sr-warden-louisiana-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">881</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1273</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1282 (5th Cir.\n1989).\n\nIt is therefore not enough to argue, as the State does,\nthat Liguori's comments at sentencing were a correct and\naccurate statement of Delaware law. The statute at the time\ncontained more than 40 different provisions detailing\nprocedures and requirements applicable to a death\nsentence, but the only one the prosecutor chose to\nemphasize was that providing for automatic review of the\njury's sentence.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n15. The Delaware capital sentencing scheme was substantially amended\nin 1991. Under the amended statute, \"the jury now functions only in an\nadvisory capacity. The judge, after taking the jury's recommendation into\nconsideration, has the ultimate responsibility for determining whether\nthe defendant will be sentenced to life imprisonment or death.\" State v.\nCohen, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1481517\"><a href=\"/opinion/1481517/state-v-cohen/\"><span class=\"volume\">604</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">846</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 849 (Del. 1992). In contrast, when Riley was\nsentenced, the jury's death sentence was binding on the judge.\n\n                               45\n\fNor does the State satisfactorily explain why Liguori\nreferred to \"automatic review on the death penalty\" in\nconnection with his explanation of the interrogatory form.\nApp. at 393. The interrogatory form contained only two\nquestions: whether the jury unanimously found beyond a\nreasonable doubt that an aggravating circumstance existed16\nand, if the jury answered \"yes,\" whether it unanimously\nrecommended a sentence of death. Such a simple and\nstraightforward form hardly needed an explanation.\nInstead, that \"explanation\" appears to have been used as a\nsegue to alert the jury to the fact that the Delaware\nSupreme Court would automatically review its decision to\nimpose a death sentence.\n\n\"The sentencing decision in capital cases is born out of\nan inherent and unique mixture of anger, judgment and\nretribution, and requires a determination whether certain\nacts are so beyond the pale of community standards as to\nwarrant the execution of their author.\" Sawyer, 881 F.2d at\n1278. Perhaps more than any other decision rendered by a\njury, a sentence of death is \"irreducibl[y] discretionary.\" Id.\nYet in Caldwell, the Supreme Court noted that \"[b]elief in\nthe truth of the assumption that sentencers treat their\npower to determine the appropriateness of death as an\nawesome responsibility has allowed this Court to view\nsentencer discretion as consistent with--and indeed as\nindispensable to--the Eighth Amendment's need for\nreliability in the determination that death is the appropriate\npunishment in a specific case.\" 472 U.S. at 330 (quotations\nomitted). It follows that there is particular concern \"when\nthere are state-induced suggestions that the sentencing\njury may shift its sense of responsibility to an appellate\ncourt.\" Id. Unlike our decision in Zettlemoyer v. Fulcomer,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"554033\"><a href=\"/opinion/554033/keith-w-zettlemoyer-v-thomas-a-fulcomer-superintendent-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">923</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">284</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 306 (3d Cir. 1991), where we rejected a\nCaldwell claim, in part because \"[t]here was no suggestion\nto the jury that the [state] Supreme Court . .. or anyone\nelse would have the last word in the case,\" here the\nprosecutor expressly stated both \"there is an automatic\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n16.

We cannot tell whether\nthey were \"emotional\" or not, but they can hardly be\ncharacterized as \"passing,\" as the prosecutor began by\nsaying, \"Let me say at the outset that what you do today is\nautomatically reviewed by our Supreme Court.\" And, as we\nnoted above, in that one paragraph, the prosecutor referred\nnot once but twice to the Supreme Court -- both\nmentioning \"automatic review\" and that the interrogatory to\nbe completed by the jurors also \"goes to the Supreme\nCourt.\"\n\nWe are unwilling to treat lightly the prosecutor's pointed\nreferences to appellate review of this crucial decision.\nStatements, like those made by the prosecutor here,\"can\nbe literally true but quite misleading by failing, for example,\nto disclose information essential to make what was said not\nmisleading.\" Sawyer, 881 F.2d at 1285. As a result, a\nCaldwell violation may be established where a technically\naccurate statement describing the state appellate review\nprocess nonetheless \"misled the jury to minimize its role in\nthe sentencing process.\" Driscoll v. Delo, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">701</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 713\n(8th Cir. 1995) (holding that prosecutor had violated\nCaldwell by emphasizing that the trial judge could\ndisregard the jury's recommendation of death even though\nno state judge had in fact ever done so).\n\nGiven the limited nature of the Delaware Supreme\nCourt's review of a jury's sentence of death at the time of\nRiley's sentencing, a fact Liguori did not explain to the jury,\n\n                                47\n\fwe conclude that there was a Caldwell violation in this case.17\nAs suggested in Caldwell, jurors are unlikely to understand\nthe exceptionally narrow scope of appellate review given to\njury determinations on death. See 472 U.S. at 330-31; see\nalso id. at 342 (O'Connor, J., concurring). Although\nLiguori's remarks were brief, they were the first comments\nthat the jury heard at sentencing, making them more likely\nto have made an impression. A statement does not have to\nbe lengthy to be effective in suggesting to the jury that\nultimate responsibility for sentencing lies elsewhere.\n\nMoreover, nothing the trial court said corrected any\nmisimpression left by the prosecution's statements, as the\njudge made no comment whatsoever pertaining to appellate\nreview. Unlike Jones v. Butler, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">864</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">348</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 360 (5th Cir.\n1988), where the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held\nthat the prosecutor's statement that \"[I]f, in fact, you do\nreturn the death penalty . . . yours will not be the last\nword. Every sentence is reviewed by the Supreme Court,\"\nwas improper but cured by a prompt curative instruction\nby the trial judge, here there was no curative instruction.18\n\nCaldwell and its progeny make clear that\"the sentencing\njury must continue to feel the weight of responsibility so\nlong as it has responsibility.\" Sawyer, 881 F.2d at 1282.\nBecause the prosecutor's remarks may have misled the jury\ninto thinking the Delaware Supreme Court was the final\narbiter of Riley's fate, we conclude that Riley's\nconstitutional rights were violated under Caldwell. Thus,\neven were we to find that Riley has not shown a Batson\nviolation entitling him to a new trial, we still would direct\nthe District Court to grant the writ of habeas corpus\nentitling Riley to a new sentencing hearing.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n17.

We are not persuaded by Riley's contention that the trial judge's\nrepeated references to the jury's determination on death as a\n\"recommendation\" misled the jury as to its actual responsibility in the\nsentencing process.

One of the principal objections to the\noperation of the death penalty in this country is that it is\napplied unevenly, particularly against poor black\ndefendants. Another concern is that because of the complex\nreview process, the jury may not comprehend the\nsignificance of its life-or-death decision. Both of these\nissues are implicated in this case.

Before trial,\nRiley's lawyer asked the state to produce recordings or\ntranscripts of the intercepted calls, but the state refused,\narguing that the tapes contained no exculpatory material.\nWithout listening to the tape himself, the trial judge\naccepted the prosecutor's representation and denied Riley's\nmotion for production. Throughout the subsequent\nproceedings in state and federal court, no judge listened to\nthe tapes.\n\nIn his briefs in this appeal, Riley made a strong Brady\nargument. He asserted that between the time of the Feeley\nmurder and Baxter's arrest, \"Baxter spoke to his mother on\nthe telephone on several occasions\"; that \"Baxter's\ntestimony was the State's strongest evidence against\" him;\nand that statements made by Baxter to his mother might\nhave provided valuable impeachment evidence. Appellant's\nBr. at 5. At a minimum, he contended, the state courts or\nthe District Court should have listened to the tapes in\ncamera to determine whether they contained Brady\nmaterial.\n\nAt oral argument, however, counsel for the appellees\nrepresented that an examination of the logs of the wiretap\non Mrs. Baxter's telephone did not reveal any intercepted\nconversations in which Baxter participated. Copies of the\nlogs were provided to Riley's attorneys and to the court, and\nRiley's attorneys submitted a letter-brief commenting on the\ncontents of the logs. We have examined the logs, and it\nappears that the state's representation is correct: we see no\nrecord of any conversations in which Baxter participated.\nThe revelation that the logs do not mention any such\nconversations fatally undermines the Brady argument made\nin Riley's briefs.\n\nIn their post-argument letter-brief commenting on the\nlogs, Riley's attorneys advance different arguments to show\nthat an in camera inspection of the wiretap recordings is\nrequired. A defendant seeking an in camera inspection to\ndetermine whether files contain Brady material must at\nleast make a \"plausible showing\" that the inspection will\nreveal material evidence.

Bartholomew, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117975\"><a href=\"/opinion/117975/wood-v-bartholomew/\"><span class=\"volume\">516</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 5-6 (1995).\nMoreover, even if the problem of admissibility is put aside,\nit is pure speculation to suppose that the contents of the\nstatements are in any way exculpatory.\n\nRiley's attorneys also suggest that conversations between\nBaxter and his mother may have been intercepted and\nrecorded but that the person or persons who compiled the\nlogs may not have recognized Baxter's voice. This, however,\nis nothing but the purest speculation. We note that the\nwiretap occurred while the police were seeking to arrest\nBaxter; they therefore had a strong incentive to identify him\nif he participated in any of the intercepted conversations.\nWe have considered all of Riley's Brady arguments and find\nthem to be without merit.\n\nV.\n\nRiley argues that he was denied the effective assistance\nof counsel at the penalty phase of his trial.1 The District\nCourt held that many of Riley's arguments concerning the\nalleged deficiencies of his attorney's performance were never\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. Riley's amended federal habeas petition raised claims regarding the\nalleged ineffectiveness of trial counsel at the guilty phase, but the\nDistrict Court held that these claims were procedurally barred. See Riley\nVI, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">172856</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at **18-20. On appeal, Riley refers to these claims\nin a footnote. See Appellant's Br. at 38 n.16. This footnote is inadequate\nto raise the issue on appeal.\n\n                                56\n\fpresented to the Delaware Supreme Court and were thus\nprocedurally barred, and the District Court rejected Riley's\nremaining arguments regarding this matter on the merits.\nOn appeal, Riley attacks both parts of the District Court's\nholding.\n\nA.\n\nRiley contends that the District Court was required to\nhold an evidentiary hearing on the question of procedural\ndefault for two reasons. First, he maintains that at least\nsome of the arguments that the District Court held were\nprocedurally barred might have been presented to the\nDelaware Supreme Court during the oral argument of his\ndirect appeal even though those arguments were not\ncontained in his brief. Because the record does not include\na transcript of the oral argument, Riley maintains that the\nDistrict Court should have held an evidentiary hearing for\nthe purpose of reconstructing the record. See Appellant's\nBr. at 38-39. We disagree.\n\nOn direct appeal, Riley was represented by the same\nattorney who had represented him at trial. In his amended\nhabeas petition, Riley acknowledges that no ineffective\nassistance argument was made in the direct appeal brief\nthat was ultimately submitted on his behalf and accepted\nfor filing by the Delaware Supreme Court.2 See App. 1198.\nIn addition, the opinion issued by the Delaware Supreme\nCourt in the direct appeal makes no mention of ineffective\nassistance of counsel. See Riley I. Under these\ncircumstances, the District Court was certainly not\nrequired to conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine\nwhether the attorney who represented Riley at trial chose at\noral argument before the state supreme court to make\narguments not mentioned in his brief and to condemn his\nown performance in the trial court.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. The first brief submitted by Riley's attorney on direct appeal\ncontained\na conclusory passage that purported to raise the issue of ineffective\nassistance (without any factual elaboration) for the purpose of preserving\nthe issue. See App. 1198. However, this brief was rejected by the\nDelaware Supreme Court, and the brief that was ultimately submitted\nand accepted contained no such passage. See App. 1198-99.\n\n                               57\n\fWith little elaboration, Riley also contends that the\nDistrict Court should have held an evidentiary hearing so\nthat Riley could show that he had \"cause\" for not raising\nthe arguments in question in state court. See Appellant's\nBr. at 39. However, Riley has not even identified any\n\"cause\" that he would have attempted to show. We will not\nreverse the decision of the District Court and order that\nCourt to conduct an evidentiary hearing so that Riley can\ndevelop the factual predicate for a \"cause\" that Riley has\nnot even disclosed.\n\nPerhaps the most frequently asserted \"cause\" for\nprocedural default is ineffective assistance of counsel, and\nwe will therefore comment briefly on the steps that Riley\nshould have taken if he wished to rely on this \"cause.\" As\nthe District Court pointed out, in order for Riley to show\nthat ineffective assistance provided \"cause\" for failing to\nraise the arguments in question in the state court\nproceedings, Riley would have to show that the new\nattorney who represented him in the state post-conviction\nrelief proceedings was ineffective. See Dist. Ct. Op. at 50 &\nn.16, 56-57. This is so because Delaware permits a claim of\nineffective assistance to be raised in a post-conviction relief\nproceeding even if it was not raised on direct appeal. See\nRiley VI, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">172856</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at **17-18 & n.16. 3\n\nRiley has not argued, however, that the attorney who\nrepresented him in the state post-conviction relief\nproceedings provided ineffective assistance by failing to\nmake the specific arguments that the District Court held\nwere procedurally barred.4 Moreover, because Riley never\nraised a claim in state court that his post-conviction relief\nattorney was ineffective, he runs afoul of the rule that \"a\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. Indeed, in Riley's case, ineffective assistance was vigorously argued\nin\nthe post-conviction relief proceedings, and the Delaware Supreme Court\naddressed these arguments on the merits. See Riley V, 585 A.2d at 726-\n29.\n\n4. Even if Riley had asserted a \"cause\" for the procedural default, he\nwould have to confront the rule that a habeas petitioner is not entitled\nto an evidentiary hearing in federal court to establish a factual record\nunless the petitioner can show \"cause\" for not making the necessary\nfactual record in the state proceedings.

Washington, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 687\n(1984). First, he must demonstrate that his attorney\"made\nerrors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the\n`counsel' guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth\nAmendment.\" Id. at 687. \"Judicial scrutiny of counsel's\nperformance must be highly deferential. It is all too\ntempting for a defendant to second-guess counsel's\nassistance after . . . [an] adverse sentence, and it is all too\neasy for a court, examining counsel's defense after it has\nproved unsuccessful, to conclude that a particular act or\nomission of counsel was unreasonable.\" Id. at 689. Second,\nif counsel's representation is shown to fall outside\"the wide\nrange of reasonable professional assistance,\" id., it must be\nshown that \"the deficient performance prejudiced the\ndefense,\" that is, that \"there is a reasonable probability\nthat, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of\nthe proceeding would have been different.\" Id . at 694.\n\n1. In his brief in our court, Riley presented a greatly\ntruncated version of arguments previously advanced\nregarding trial counsel's failure to call certain family\nmembers to testify at the penalty phase of the trial and trial\ncounsel's failure to locate or contact other family members\nwho might have testified. All of these family members, Riley\nargues, could have provided evidence about his traumatic\nexperiences as a child and his \"severely dysfunctional\nfamily.\" Appellant's Br. at 41.\n\nThe Superior Court, the Delaware Supreme Court, and\nthe District Court all addressed these arguments in some\n\n                               59\n\fdetail and rejected them. They concluded that Riley's trial\nattorney made reasonable efforts to find certain family\nmembers who could not be located, that he did not act\nunreasonably in failing to call others as witnesses, and that\nhis failure to rely on what was termed Riley's \"social\nhistory\" represented a reasonable strategy. See Riley II,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1988</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">47076</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at *3-4, *7-9; Riley V, 585 A.2d at 726-28;\nRiley VI, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">172856</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at **20-23.\n\nIn his brief in our court, Riley merely states without\nelaboration that \"trial counsel failed to call as witnesses\nmembers of Mr. Riley's immediate family, several of whom\nlived within a few hours of Dover, Delaware\" and that these\nwitnesses could have testified about his childhood and\nfamily. Appellant's Br. at 41. He provides no response to\nthe detailed reasons given by the state courts and the\nDistrict Court for holding that trial counsel was not\nineffective in failing to call or locate family members for the\npurpose of eliciting testimony about Riley's childhood and\nfamily.\n\nNothing has been presented that convinces us that the\nstate courts and the District Court erred. We agree with the\nstate courts and the District Court that Riley has not\nshown that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to call\nthose family members who could be located, such as Riley's\nmother. The District Court analyzed trial counsel's decision\nnot to put Riley's mother on the stand as follows:\n\n        The record is replete with circumstances that\n       support trial counsel's decision not to call Petitioner's\n       mother. First, Petitioner informed trial counsel that he\n       did not wish to expose his mother's problems at trial.\n       . . . Second, trial counsel testified that Petitioner's\n       mother refused to support Petitioner's alibi, and as a\n       result, he was concerned about the prosecutor's cross-\n       examination of her during the penalty phase. . . .\n       Third, the record indicates that Petitioner's mother had\n       a severe drinking problem and was drinking heavily at\n       the time of the trial. . . . As a result, trial counsel\n       believed that the witnesses that he chose to call in\n       mitigation, instead, would make a better impression on\n       the jury. . . . Under these circumstances, the Court\n       finds trial counsel's decision not to call Petitioner's\n\n                               60\n\f       mother to be reasonable and within the bounds of his\n       strategic discretion.\n\nRiley VI, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">172856</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2. We agree.\n\nWe also agree that Riley has not demonstrated that his\ntrial attorney was ineffective in failing to locate certain\nother family members. See Riley II, **3-5; Riley V, 585 A.2d\nat 727-28; Riley VI, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">172856</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *21. Finally, we\nagree that a strategy of not introducing evidence regarding\nRiley's background and family fell within \"the wide range of\nreasonable professional assistance.\" Strickland, 466 U.S. at\n689. The Superior Court wrote as follows:\n\n       The adverse inferences to be drawn from the fact that\n       defendant's parents were both alcoholics, his sister an\n       unwed mother of three, his brother an incarcerated\n       criminal and his home life a series of jails and\n       temporary living quarters would no doubt have been\n       magnified in the semi-rural county where this case was\n       tried . . . . Likewise, it is certainly within the range of\n       strategic choices to forego mitigating evidence, which\n       may be seen as \"excuse making\" and rely upon a plea\n       for mercy . . . . In Riley's case, evidence offered as to\n       mitigating circumstances included: that the actual\n       killer was Tyrone Baxter, the co-defendant; that Baxter\n       received a less severe penalty; and that Riley's\n       background indicated that he was a diligent worker,\n       possessing a non-violent and good character.\n\n       In this case, trial counsel gave a strong argument that\n       Riley's life should be spared in light of the fact that\n       Tyrone Baxter, defendant's accomplice and principal\n       accuser, would be spared the death penalty as the\n       result of a plea bargain. Moreover, Walter Ross testified\n       without contradiction at the [post-conviction relief]\n       hearing that the defendant did not want his family\n       background discussed at the penalty phase. Given\n       defendant's wishes, the lack of positive evidence in\n       mitigation, counsel's focused argument for leniency in\n       light of Baxter's plea bargain, and the potentially\n       negative impact the purportedly positive evidence\n       would have wrought before the jury, defendant has\n       failed to show that counsel's decision to limit the\n\n                               61\n\f       testimony at the penalty phase was constitutionally\n       deficient.\n\nRiley II, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1988</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">47076</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *11-12. This analysis was\naccepted by the Delaware Supreme Court and the District\nCourt. We cannot disagree.\n\n2. Riley contends that his trial attorney was ineffective\nbecause he did not present testimony by a mental health\nexpert. Riley relies on the affidavits of two experts, who\nexamined him in connection with the post-conviction relief\nproceeding. One of the experts characterized Riley as a\nperson with \"borderline defective\" intelligence whose\ncapacity \"for objectively analyzing events, circumstances\nand relationships [is] narrowed by stress and complexity.\"\nAppellant's Br. at 42. We agree with Riley that this\nexplanation might have been helpful at the penalty phase.\nThe question remains, however, whether trial counsel was\nineffective in failing to obtain such evidence at the time.\n\nIn the post-conviction relief proceeding in Superior Court,\ntrial counsel testified that he did not seek to have Riley\nexamined by a mental health expert because he had no\nreason to think, in light of his conversations with Riley,\nthat such an examination would have revealed anything\nuseful. See App. 592-96. He testified that Riley appeared to\nunderstand what they discussed and that Riley prepared\nand filed some motions on his own behalf. See App. 592-\n93. Trial counsel stated that Riley never mentioned any\nhead injury or any psychological problems. See App. 590.\nRelying on this testimony, the Superior Court found that\ntrial counsel \"had no inkling that evaluation of Mr. Riley's\nmental or emotional state might be helpful in mitigation.\"\nRiley II, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1988</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">47076</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *7.\n\nBefore us, Riley has not argued that counsel in a capital\ncase must always seek a mental examination of the\ndefendant, and cases from other circuits reject that\nproposition. Instead, they hold that a case-by-case\ndetermination must be made and that counsel is not\nineffective if he or she has no reason to think that a mental\nexamination would be useful. See Thomas v. Gilmore, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"754520\"><a href=\"/opinion/754520/walter-l-thomas-v-jerry-gilmore-warden-pontiac-correctional-center/\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">513</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 515-16 (7th Cir. 1998); United States v.

Riley has simply not\nidentified any fact that should have alerted his trial\nattorney that he had mental problems that might have\nprovided the basis for mitigation. The only fact even\nmentioned in Riley's briefs is the \"implausible\" nature of\nRiley's alibi, see Reply Br. at 21, but this is insufficient to\nalert counsel to the possibility of mental problems that\nmight be relevant to mitigation. For the most part, Riley\nmerely notes what the subsequent examinations by mental\nhealth experts revealed. However, \"[a] fair assessment of\nattorney performance requires that every effort be made to\neliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct\nthe circumstances of counsel's challenged conduct, and to\nevaluate the conduct from counsel's perspective at the\ntime.\" Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689.\n\n3. Finally, Riley cites trial counsel's inexperience and\nthe fact that he spent only 14 hours preparing for the\npenalty phase of the trial. These facts are not comforting,\nbut they do not in themselves establish that counsel was\nineffective. We have taken them into account in evaluating\nthe other deficiencies properly asserted in this appeal. We\ncannot say, however, that Riley's constitutional right to the\neffective assistance of counsel was denied.\n\nVI.\n\nRelying on Ake v. Oklahoma, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111356\"><a href=\"/opinion/111356/ake-v-oklahoma/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">68</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 76-77 (1985),\nRiley argues that his right to due process was violated\nbecause the trial judge refused to appoint co-counsel or an\ninvestigator to assist his attorney. Riley again notes the\ninexperience of his attorney, and he asserts that co-counsel\nhad been appointed in Kent County in prior capital cases.\nAlthough Riley claims that the lack of co-counsel and an\ninvestigator caused him \"extreme prejudice,\" his brief\nprovides no details.\n\nA. We turn first to Riley's argument that he was\nconstitutionally entitled to the appointment of co-counsel.\nIn some jurisdictions, there is a statutory right to the\nappointment of two defense attorneys in capital cases. See,\ne.g., 18 U.S.C. S 3005. However, we are aware of no\n\n                               63\n\fauthority holding that the federal Constitution confers such\na right, and we see no basis for such a holding. The\nConstitution specifies the quality of representation that all\ncriminal defendants, including capital defendants, must\nreceive, namely, \"reasonably effective assistance.\"\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 687. The Constitution does not\nspecify the number of lawyers who must be appointed. If a\nsingle attorney provides reasonably effective assistance, the\nConstitution is satisfied, and if a whole team of lawyers\nfails to provide such assistance, the Constitution is\nviolated. Thus, there is no constitutional right per se to the\nappointment of co-counsel in a capital case.

The Court held\nthat \"the proper standard for determining when a\nprospective juror may be excluded for cause because of his\nor her views on capital punishment . . . is whether the\njuror's views would `prevent or substantially impair the\nperformance of his duties as a juror in accordance with his\ninstructions and his oath.' \" Id. at 424 (quoting\nWitherspoon, 391 U.S. at 45). The Court noted:\n\n       [T]his standard . . . does not require that a juror's bias\n       be proved with `unmistakable clarity' . . . because\n       determinations of juror bias cannot be reduced to\n       question-and-answer sessions which obtain results in\n       the manner of a catechism. What common sense\n       should have realized experience has proved: many\n       veniremen simply cannot be asked enough questions to\n       reach the point where their bias has been made\n       \"unmistakably clear\"; these veniremen may not know\n       how they will react when faced with imposing the death\n       sentence, or may be unable to articulate, or may wish\n       to hide their true feelings. Despite this lack of clarity in\n       the printed record, however, there will be situations\n       where the trial judge is left with the definite impression\n       that a prospective juror would be unable to faithfully\n       and impartially apply the law.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5.

First, he notes\nthat the state supreme court rejected his argument on the\nmerits, and he contends that \"the State should not now be\nheard to raise alleged procedural bars to federal court\nresolution of the claim on the merits.\" Appellant's Br. at 52.\nOur holding, however, has nothing to do with a procedural\nbar, i.e., a state rule of procedure that bars a federal\nhabeas court from reaching the merits of a federal claim.\nRather, our holding is based on the fact that the\nconstitutional right recognized in Morgan applies only if the\ndefense makes a request for a reverse-Witherspoon inquiry.\n\nSecond, Riley argues that his trial attorney was\nineffective in failing to request reverse-Witherspoon\nquestioning. However, this argument was not made in the\nstate courts, and it is thus procedurally barred.\n\nX.\n\nUnder </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Del.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. S 4209(g)(2), the Delaware Supreme\nCourt is required to undertake a proportionality review in\ndeath penalty cases. The statute mandates that the Court\ninquire into whether \"the death penalty was either\narbitrarily or capriciously imposed or recommended, or\ndisproportionate to the penalty recommended or imposed in\n\n                                69\n\fsimilar cases.\" </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Del.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. S 4209(g)(2)(a). In affirming Riley's\ndeath sentence, the Delaware Supreme Court examined 21\ncases, including five in which the death penalty was\nimposed. It found that Riley's case was comparable to the\nfive death penalty cases (Whalen, Rush, Deputy, Flamer\nand Bailey), because they all involved\n\n       an unprovoked, cold-blooded murder of a helpless\n       person (or persons) committed upon victims lacking the\n       ability to defend themselves and solely for the purposes\n       of pecuniary gain (except in Whalen's case). In none of\n       these killings is there any evidence of provocation or of\n       homicide committed out of passion or rage. In each\n       case, except Whalen, the murder occurred in the court\n       of a robbery that was deliberately planned and carried\n       out with the use of deadly weapons. In each case, the\n       perpetrators of these crimes offered no extenuating\n       circumstance for taking the life of another.\n\nRiley I, 496 A.2d at 1027.\n\nRiley challenges this finding on two grounds. First, he\npoints to the fact that two of the death sentences relied on\n-- Rush and Whalen -- had been vacated. Second, he\nargues that the remaining cases -- Deputy, Bailey, and\nFlamer -- do not furnish appropriate comparisons because\neach involved the killing of more than one person. He\nmaintains that these errors violated the Eighth and\nFourteenth Amendments.\n\nIt is clear that proportionality review is not required by\nthe federal Constitution. See Pulley v. Harris , </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111092\"><a href=\"/opinion/111092/pulley-v-harris/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n50-51 (1984). Riley justifies advancing his proportionality\nargument in federal court on two grounds.8 First, he argues\nthat the allegedly improper review resulted in a punishment\nthat was \"inherently disproportionate and, therefore,\narbitrary and capricious\" in violation of the Eighth\nAmendment. Appellant's Br. at 56. Second, he argues that\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n8. Ordinarily, federal habeas relief is not available for an error of\nstate\nlaw: the habeas statute provides that a writ disturbing a state court\njudgment may issue only if a prisoner is in custody\"in violation of the\nConstitution or laws or treaties of the United States.\" 28 U.S.C.\nS 2241(c)(3).

Florida,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111250\"><a href=\"/opinion/111250/spaziano-v-florida/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">447</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 460 (1984). Riley claims that the\nproportionality review conducted by the Delaware Supreme\nCourt in his case failed to protect him from arbitrary\nimposition of the death penalty, and in fact upheld a\ndisproportionate punishment. This argument rests on the\npremise that applying the death penalty in Riley's case\nwould be so disproportionate as to constitute cruel and\nunusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment.\nTherefore, Riley's argument really attacks the imposition of\nthe penalty itself, rather than the state's method of\nreviewing proportionality.\n\nRiley's argument is not tenable. The Supreme Court has\n\"occasionally struck down punishments as inherently\ndisproportionate, and therefore cruel and unusual, when\nimposed for a particular crime or category of crime.\" Pulley,\n465 U.S. at 43. However, in this case, Riley's crime--\nkilling a defenseless person without provocation in the\ncourse of an armed robbery -- is not such that application\nof the death penalty in these circumstances would\"shock\nthe conscience.\" See Lindsey v. Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"489605\"><a href=\"/opinion/489605/michael-lindsey-v-fred-smith-commissioner-alabama-department-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">820</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1137</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1154\n(11th Cir. 1987); Spinkellink v.

Riley has thus failed to show an\nEighth Amendment violation.\n\nRiley's second argument is based on the principle that\nwhen a state creates a right, the Due Process clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment entitles a defendant to procedures\nto ensure that the right is not arbitrarily denied. He argues\nthat the Delaware Supreme Court, by failing to conduct an\n\n                               71\n\fadequate proportionality review as required by state\nstatute, denied him due process.\n\nAs a threshold matter, it is unclear whether, under Third\nCircuit law, a state proportionality-review statute creates\nany cognizable liberty interest for due process purposes.\nSee Frey v. Fulcomer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"749873\"><a href=\"/opinion/749873/roderick-herman-frey-v-thomas-a-fulcomer-warden-state-correctional/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">916</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 925 n.7 (3d Cir. 1997)\n(noting that Supreme Court precedent on this issue is in\nflux). We need not address this question, however, because\neven if Riley has such a liberty interest, he has not shown\nany denial of due process. In evaluating a claim that a state\ncourt erred in conducting its proportionality review, a\nfederal court may only inquire into whether the state court\n\"undertook its proportionality review in good faith and\nfound that [the defendant's] sentence was proportional to\nthe sentences imposed in cases similar to his.\" Walton v.\nArizona, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112485\"><a href=\"/opinion/112485/walton-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">497</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">639</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 656 (1990). Because there is no\nfederal constitutional right to proportionality review, if the\nfederal court finds that the review was undertaken in good\nfaith, it cannot \"look behind\" the state court's conclusion of\nproportionality to consider whether the state court\nmisapplied state proportionality law. See id.; Bannister v.\nDelo, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">610</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 627 (8th Cir. 1996). In this case, the\nDelaware Supreme Court compared Riley's case with a\nsubstantial number of other death-eligible cases, and, even\ndisregarding the two vacated death sentences, it found\ncommon characteristics between Riley's case and three\nother cases in which the sentence was not vacated.\nAlthough Riley argues that these cases are not entirely\nanalogous, because each contained an additional\naggravating factor (more than one victim), there is no\nindication that the Delaware court acted in bad faith in\nconducting its review. We are thus without power to order\nhabeas relief.\n\nXI.\n\nWe now turn to Riley's contentions concerning jury\ninstructions given by the trial judge at the sentencing\nphase.\n\nA.\n\nRiley argues that the jury instructions at the penalty\nphase impermissibly restricted the jury's consideration of\n\n                                72\n\fmitigating circumstances. He takes issue with the following\ninstruction, issued at the start of the penalty hearing:\n\n       A sentence of death shall not be imposed unless the\n       jury finds:\n\n       (1) Beyond a reasonable doubt at least one statutory\n       aggravating circumstance; and\n\n       (2) Unanimously recommends, after weighing all\n       relevant evidence in aggravation or mitigation\n       which bears upon the particular circumstances or\n       details of the commission of the offense and the\n       character and propensities of the offender, that a\n       sentence of death shall be imposed. Where the\n       jury submits such a finding and recommendation,\n       the Court shall sentence the defendant to death. A\n       finding by the jury of a statutory aggravating\n       circumstance, and a consequent recommendation of\n       death, supported by the evidence, shall be binding\n       on the Court.\n\nApp. 392 (emphasis added). Riley contends that, given the\nplacement of the word \"consequent,\" \"a reasonable jury\ncould understand the underscored sentence to mean that\nthe effect of a finding that a statutory aggravating\ncircumstance existed, is that the death penalty must be\nimposed.\" Appellant's Br. 59. Because the trial judge had\npreviously informed the jury that the statutory aggravating\ncircumstance -- commission of the murder during a\nrobbery -- had already been proven beyond a reasonable\ndoubt in the guilt phase, Riley argues that a reasonable\njury could have read the instruction to mean that it need\nnot consider mitigation evidence.\n\nWhen reviewing a jury instruction that is claimed to\nimpermissibly restrict a jury's consideration of relevant\nevidence, a court must ask \"whether there is a reasonable\nlikelihood that the jury has applied the challenged\ninstruction in a way that prevents the consideration of\nconstitutionally relevant evidence.\" Boyde v. California, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112386\"><a href=\"/opinion/112386/boyde-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">370</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 380 (1990). If there is \"only a possibility\" of such\ninhibition, however, the challenge must fail. Id . Moreover,\nthe challenged instructions \"must be evaluated not in\n\n                               73\n\fisolation but in the context of the entire charge.\" Jones v.\nUnited States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118309\"><a href=\"/opinion/118309/jones-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">373</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 391 (1999).\n\nWhen the jury charge is read as a whole, there is no\nreasonable likelihood that a jury could have understood it\nto preclude consideration of mitigating circumstances. At\nthe close of the penalty hearing, the court again instructed\nthe jury in terms that cleared up any ambiguity that might\nhave been present in its earlier instruction:\n\n       In conclusion, a sentence of death shall not be imposed\n       unless you, the jury, find:\n\n       (1) Beyond a reasonable doubt at least one statutory\n       aggravating circumstance has been established;\n       and\n\n       (2) Unanimously recommend that a sentence of death\n       be imposed after weighing all relevant evidence in\n       aggravation and mitigation which bear upon the\n       particular circumstances and details of the\n       commission of the offense and the character and\n       propensities of the offender.\n\n       Should you fail to agree unanimously to either of these\n       two matters, the Court shall sentence the defendant to\n       life imprisonment without benefit of probation or\n       parole.\n\nApp. 438-40 (emphasis added).\n\nThis instruction made it clear that a jury was required\nboth to find at least one statutory aggravator and to weigh\naggravating factors against mitigating factors in order to\nsupport a death sentence. This belies Riley's argument that\nthe jury was misled into believing that its job was done\nonce the felony murder aggravator was found.\n\nB.\n\nRiley next takes issue with the trial court's failure at the\npenalty phase to instruct the jury that it was required to\nconclude unanimously that aggravating circumstances\noutweigh mitigating circumstances before imposing death,\nas required by Delaware law. See Whalen v.

As long as\na jury is permitted to consider all relevant mitigating\ncircumstances in making its death recommendation, there\nis no federal constitutional problem. In addition, Riley has\nnot suggested how a jury's decision would be any different\nunder the language the court used in this case. Because\nthe jury was instructed not to make a sentencing\nrecommendation until after it had \"weigh[ed] all relevant\nevidence in aggravation and mitigation,\" the necessary\ninference was that the death penalty should be imposed\nonly if aggravating factors outweighed mitigating factors\n(otherwise, the entire \"weighing\" process would be\nmeaningless).\n\nC.\n\nFinally, Riley argues that the penalty phase instructions\nimproperly suggested that the jury had to be unanimous in\nimposing a life sentence, in violation of Whalen v. State,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1937403\"><a href=\"/opinion/1937403/whalen-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">492</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">552</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 562 (Del. 1985). He points to the instruction\nthat \"[i]f you are not unanimous in your recommendation to\nimpose the death penalty, or you cannot agree unanimously\nas to your recommendation, then the Court is bound to\nimpose a sentence of life.\" App. 438 (emphasis added). The\nword \"recommendation\" in the underlined phrase, he\nsuggests, could be read to refer to a life sentence\nrecommendation as well as to a recommendation of death.\n\nAs a threshold issue, the government argues that Riley\nfailed to raise this issue before the District Court because\nhe based his argument there \"solely on the interpretation of\nthe interrogatories posed to the jury\" rather than on the\njury instruction he points to here. Appellee's Br. at 75.\nHowever, Riley, although pointing specifically to the\ninterrogatories to support his point, nevertheless raised the\n\n                               75\n\fgeneral argument in his amended petition that \"the\ninstructions were likely to confuse the jury about whether\nthe verdict must be unanimous.\" App. 1191. This is\nsufficient to preserve his argument before this Court.\n\nOn the merits, however, Riley's claim must fail. First,\nwhen the jury charge is viewed as a whole, it reveals several\ninstances in which the word \"unanimous\" was explicitly\npaired solely with the death recommendation. In light of\nthis pattern, it appears unlikely that the jury would have\nviewed the isolated passage that Riley relies on as\nextending the unanimity requirement to a recommendation\nof life imprisonment. Second, the Delaware Supreme Court,\nin reviewing this allegation, stated that it was\"satisfied that\nthe jury understood that, in the event of its failure to\nunanimously agree upon imposition of a death penalty, an\nimposition of life imprisonment would result.\" Riley V, 585\nA.2d at 725. Because the instruction made clear that the\ndefault rule in case of a lack of unanimity was life\nimprisonment, it is hard to see how the jury's deliberations\nwould have been affected even had it adopted Riley's\ninterpretation of the instruction. Finally, the challenged\ninstruction was identical to one approved by the Delaware\nSupreme Court in Flamer v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2317266\"><a href=\"/opinion/2317266/flamer-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">104</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Del.\n1984), aff 'd sub nom.

See Riley, 585 A.2d at\n722-25. For these reasons, we reject Riley's claim.\n\nXII.\n\nRiley was convicted of intentional murder and felony\nmurder, with the underlying felony being first-degree\nrobbery. The statutory aggravating circumstance relied on\nfor the death sentence was that the murder was committed\nwhile Riley was engaged in the commission of first degree\nrobbery.

We disagree.\n\nA.\n\nUnder 18 U.S.C. S 3006A(e) and 21 U.S.C. S 848(q)(4)(B)\nand (9), Riley was entitled to investigative and expert\nassistance upon a finding that such assistance was\n\"necessary\" or \"reasonably necessary\" with respect to his\nrepresentation in the habeas proceeding. Riley sought the\nservices of an investigator to gather additional evidence\nconcerning his childhood experiences. He sought the\nservices of a forensic psychiatrist to develop further\nmitigating evidence concerning his mental problems. All of\nthese services were requested in order to support Riley's\narguments that his trial attorney was ineffective at the\npenalty phase and that the trial judge should have\nappointed a co-counsel and investigator to assist him.\n\nRiley has not shown that the services in question were\n\"necessary\" or \"reasonably necessary.\" The discovery at the\ntime of the federal habeas proceeding of new evidence about\nRiley's childhood would not have shown that the efforts of\nRiley's trial attorney to locate family members who might\nhave testified about such matters were objectively\nunreasonable. See pages 38-41, supra. Nor would the\ndiscovery of such evidence have demonstrated that it was\nstrategically unreasonable for Riley's trial attorney to\n\n                                77\n\feschew a penalty-phase defense based on Riley's\"social\nhistory.\" See id. Similarly, the development of additional\nevidence regarding Riley's mental condition at the time of\nthe federal habeas proceeding would not have shown that\nRiley's trial attorney was objectively unreasonable in not\nseeking a mental examination prior to the penalty. See\npages 41-43, supra.\n\nB.\n\n\"Where the District Court denies the petition for a writ of\nhabeas corpus in the absence of an evidentiary hearing,\" we\nask, first, \"whether the petitioner asserts facts which entitle\nhim to relief \" and, second, \"whether an evidentiary hearing\nis needed.\" Todaro v.

Riley argues that the District Court should have\nheld an evidentiary hearing concerning the prosecution's\nperemptory challenges, the impartiality of the jury, his\nBrady claim, and other unspecified issues. We disagree. As\npreviously discussed, we are required to accept the state\ncourts' findings regarding the peremptory challenges and\nthe impartiality of the jury, and those findings are\ndispositive. Thus, an evidentiary hearing in federal court on\nthose matters was not needed. In addition, in light of the\nrevelation after briefing that no conversation in which\nBaxter participated is listed in the logs of the wiretap on\nMrs. Baxter's telephone, it is clear that there was no need\nfor an evidentiary hearing concerning Riley's Brady claim.\nNor do we believe that the District Court was an evidentiary\nhearing was needed on any other matter.\n\n                                78\n\fBECKER, Chief Judge, Concurring in the Judgment.\n\nThis en banc appeal ultimately turns on the petitioner's\nBatson claim. Unfortunately, I find myself unable to join in\neither Judge Sloviter's or Judge Alito's opinion on that issue.1\n\nFirst, I cannot agree with Judge Sloviter's treatment of\nthe prosecution's challenge to prospective juror Nichols.\nRather, I agree with Judge Alito's opinion on this issue, see\nDis. Op. at 83-91, largely because I do not share Judge\nSloviter's skepticism of the prosecutor's testimony as to\nNichols's \"significant pause.\" Human memory can be quite\npowerful, and I think it entirely possible that this\n\"significant pause\" became indelibly etched in the\nprosecutor's mind. As explicated by the dissent, the hearing\njudge determined that the prosecutor's testimony on this\nmatter was credible, and I cannot agree that the race-\nneutral reason proffered for striking Nichols was\"not fairly\nsupported by the record.\" 28 U.S.C. S 2254(d)(8) (1988).\n\nOn the other hand, while the point is quite close, I\ncannot bring myself to join Judge Alito's discussion of the\nchallenge to prospective juror McGuire. Unlike the\nchallenge to Nichols, an action for which the prosecutor\nrelied on his memory to articulate a race-neutral\nexplanation, the prosecutor had no recollection whatsoever\nabout the differences between McGuire and Reed. I\ntherefore agree with Judge Sloviter that there is no basis in\nthe record for distinguishing McGuire, a prospective black\njuror who was struck, from Reed, a white man who was not\nstruck and who ultimately served on the jury. While ideally\nthis issue would be developed further at a federal habeas\nhearing, I reluctantly conclude, again agreeing with Judge\nSloviter, that no purpose would be served by having such\na hearing at this late date. Accordingly, I will join in the\njudgment accompanying her opinion.\n\nWhile I might end at this point, I am impelled to\ncomment on the statistical evidence by reason of the\nprominent discussion of the issue in the Sloviter and Alito\nopinions, and the fact that Judge Alito's dissent identifies\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. I do, however, join in Part II of Judge Alito's opinion, dealing with\nthe\nCaldwell issue.\n\n                               79\n\fsignificant problems with Judge Sloviter's discussion of that\nevidence. I feel myself unable to join in Judge Alito's\nopinion on that facet of the case for he has not allayed my\nconcern about the practices of the Kent County\nprosecutor's office at times relevant here. Specifically, the\nabsence of black jurors on four juries in a county that was\n18% black and had a jury venire that was 9% black\nremains troubling. As the Supreme Court has observed in\nother contexts when presented with perhaps imperfect\nstatistical data, \"[F]ine tuning of the statistics could not\nhave obscured the glaring absence of minoriti[ies]. . . . [T]he\n. . . inability to rebut the inference of discrimination came\nnot from a misuse of statistics, but from the inexorable\nzero.\" Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109665\"><a href=\"/opinion/109665/teamsters-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">324</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n342 n.23 (1977) (internal quotations omitted).\n\nThis concern is exacerbated for me by the State's failure\nto submit rebuttal evidence. If Riley's data was too weak to\nsupport an inference of discrimination in the face of the\nprosecutor's race-neutral explanations, there was no\nburden on the government to submit rebuttal data.\nHowever, as Judge Sloviter's discussion of the chronology of\nevents makes clear, the State volunteered to provide\nrebuttal data, and then failed to do so. See Op. of the Court\nat 38. If the hearing judge had acknowledged the State's\nfailure to provide evidence notwithstanding its promise and\nthen specifically said that he did not consider this failure to\nbe sufficiently probative to overcome the credibility\ndetermination, his factual conclusion would be fait\naccompli. But the fact that the hearing judge did not\nmention the State's failure to provide evidence, in the wake\nof the \"volunteering,\" sticks out like a sore thumb, and\nrenders it doubtful for me that the \"record as a whole\"\nsupports the hearing judge's conclusion.\n\nJudge Sloviter seems to concede that a federal habeas\nhearing would give Riley ample time to conduct an expert\nstatistical analysis of the complete record, time which he\nlacked at the earlier hearing, as she explains, because of\nthe State's late decision not to submit any statistical\nevidence. See Op. of the Court at 38. Were the statistical\nevidence dispositive of Riley's Batson claim, I would remand\nfor a federal habeas hearing. Judge Sloviter, however,\n\n                               80\n\fstates that the statistical evidence is \"relevant but not\ndispositive to our decision.\" Op. of the Court at 40. Because\nI accept her representation on this matter, I do not press\nthe issue further, and simply join in the judgment\naccompanying her opinion.2\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. I note that, even if I did not agree with Judge Sloviter on the juror\nMcGuire issue, the judgment accompanying her opinion is plainly closer\nto my own position than the views of Judge Alito. Under these\ncircumstances, I would vote with her anyhow to avoid a stalemate. See\nScrews v.

Because I\ncannot agree with the majority's analysis of either of these\nissues, I must respectfully dissent.\n\nI.\n\nA.\n\nI turn first to the argument that the prosecution violated\nBatson by using peremptory challenges to strike three\nAfrican Americans from the jury panel. In Batson , the\nSupreme Court held that it is a violation of the Equal\nProtection Clause for a prosecutor to strike a juror because\nof race. The Court also set out a three-step process for\nadjudicating a claim that a particular peremptory was\nracially based.\n\n       [O]nce the opponent of a peremptory challenge has\n       made out a prima facie case of racial discrimination\n       (step one), the burden of production shifts to the\n       proponent of the strike to come forward with a race-\n       neutral explanation (step two). If a race-neutral\n       explanation is tendered, the trial court must then\n       decide (step three) whether the opponent of the strike\n\n                               82\n\f       has proved purposeful racial discrimination.

Ct. April 21, 1989) at 2, and\nthe state does not dispute this point. The state offered race-\nneutral justifications for its contested strikes, and the state\ncourts accepted those explanations and found that the\ndisputed peremptories were not racially based. Id. at 3-6;\nRiley v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1486590\"><a href=\"/opinion/1486590/riley-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">585</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">719</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 725 (Del. Sup. Ct. 1990). The\nmajority however, rejects the state courts' findings\nregarding two of the state's peremptories and substitutes\nits own contrary findings. I will discuss each of the\nchallenges on which the majority relies.1\n\nB: Ray Nichols\n\n1. The prosecutor testified that he struck Nichols\nbecause he was uncertain that Nichols would be able to\nvote for a death sentence. See App. 797-99. According to\nthe prosecutor's testimony, \"there was a pause and a\nsignificant pause in [his] answering [the trial judge's]\ninquiry and that to me was enough to suggest that he\nmight not be able to return a death penalty.\" Id. Having\nheard the prosecutor's testimony, the judge who presided\nover the Batson hearing [hereinafter\"the hearing judge\"],\nconcluded: \"I find the State provided a credible, race-\nneutral reason for exercising its peremptory challenge after\nappraising the demeanor and credibility of the juror. The\nState's exercise of its peremptory challenge was non-\ndiscriminatory. I am satisfied that the peremptory challenge\nwas not made on the ground of the juror's race.\" Id. at 889.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. Riley also contends that a third member of the venire, Lois Beecher,\nwas peremptorily challenged by the state because of race. The majority,\nhowever, does not rely on this strike, and accordingly I do not discuss\nit in this opinion.\n\n                               83\n\fRiley suggests that it is not believable that the prosecutor\nwas able to remember at the time of the evidentiary hearing\nin 1988 that Nichols had paused while answering a\nquestion during voir dire six years earlier. In addition, Riley\ncontrasts the prosecutor's ability to remember this pause\nwith his inability to remember another potentially\nsignificant aspect of the jury selection process, and Riley\nnotes that the prosecutor was a friend and neighbor of the\nvictim. These facts were highlighted during the cross-\nexamination of the prosecutor at the Batson hearing, see\nApp. 820-29, and I agree that they were important factors\nto be considered in assessing the prosecutor's credibility.\nThe hearing judge was aware of these facts and had the\nopportunity to observe the prosecutor testify on the witness\nstand. Despite these facts, however, the hearing judge\nfound that the prosecutor's testimony was credible.\n\nOur standard of review of the hearing judge's finding is\nnarrow. In Batson, the Supreme Court took pains to note\nthat \"[s]ince the trial judge's findings in the context under\nconsideration here will largely turn on evaluation of\ncredibility, a reviewing court ordinarily should give those\nfindings great deference.\" Batson, 476 U.S. at 98 n.21. In a\nlater case applying Batson, the plurality elaborated:\n\n       In the typical peremptory challenge inquiry, the\n       decisive question will be whether counsel's race-neutral\n       explanation for a peremptory challenge should be\n       believed. There will seldom be much evidence bearing\n       on that issue, and the best evidence often will be the\n       demeanor of the attorney who exercised the challenge.\n       . . .

Boyd, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3613217\"><a href=\"/opinion/3630021/boyd-v-boyd/\"><span class=\"volume\">252</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.Y.</span> <span class=\"page\">422</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 429,169\n       N.E. 632.\" Id., at 339.\n\n       We greatly doubt that Congress, when it used the\n       language \"fairly supported by the record\" considered\n       \"as a whole\" intended to authorize broader federal\n       review of state court credibility determinations than are\n       authorized in appeals within the federal system itself.\n\n459 U.S. at 434. See also Purkett, 514 U.S. at 769.\n\nUnder the very limited scope of review that applies here,\nI do not see how the hearing judge's finding that the\nprosecutor testified truthfully regarding the reason for\nchallenging Nichols can be overturned. The hearing judge\nheard the prosecutor testify. He was aware of the factors\nnoted above that provided grounds for doubting his\ntestimony, but he nevertheless found that the prosecutor\nwas truthful. I would sustain that finding.\n\n2. The majority rejects that finding (as well as the state\ncourts' finding with respect to another prospective juror\n\n                                85\n\fwhom I discuss below) in large part because, in the\nmajority's view, \"there is no basis to determine if the state\ncourts undertook, or even were aware of, the required\nBatson step three inquiry.\" Maj. Op. at 36. In making this\nargument, the majority (a) misunderstands what Batson\nrequires, (b) ignores what the Delaware courts did in this\ncase, (c) imposes novel and unwarranted procedural\nrequirements on the state courts, and (d) awards relief that\nextends beyond what its own logic warrants.\n\nWhat step three of Batson requires. Although the majority\nmakes step three seem elaborate and elusive -- so elusive\nthat, according to the majority, the Delaware courts may\nnot have \"fully appreciated the requirement\" (Maj. Op. at\n32) -- step three, is neither conceptually difficult nor\nprocedurally complicated. Step three simply requires the\njudge to make a finding of fact -- \"to determine if the\ndefendant has established purposeful discrimination,\"\nBatson, 476 U.S. at 98 (footnote omitted). See also Purkett,\n514 U.S. at 767; Hernandez, 500 U.S. at 358-59 (plurality\nopinion); id. at 375 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment).\nNeither Batson nor any subsequent Supreme Court or\nThird Circuit case has added to this requirement.\n\nWhat the Delaware courts did. The Delaware courts did\nexactly what step three requires. With respect to potential\njuror Nichols, the hearing judge, whose analysis the state\nsupreme court endorsed, see 585 A.2d at 725, noted that\nthe state had provided a race-neutral reason for the\nchallenge, stated that he found the explanation credible,\nand concluded: \"I am satisfied that the peremptory\nchallenge was not made on the ground of the juror's\nrace.\"2 This is precisely the finding that step three of\nBatson mandates. See Batson, 476 U.S. at 98 (the court\nhas \"the duty to determine if the defendant has established\npurposeful discrimination\").\n\nWhat the majority requires. Although the majority opinion\nis loathe to admit it, what the majority really finds wanting\nin the opinions of the Delaware courts is not a failure to\nmake the finding mandated by step three of the Batson\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. The state courts' findings regarding the other potential juror at\nissue,\nCharles McGuire, are discussed below. See infra at 91-93.\n\n                               86\n\finquiry but a failure to comment on the record regarding\nevidence that seems, in the majority's view, to undermine\nthe prosecution's proffered explanations for the disputed\nperemptories. See Maj. Op. at 29 (\"the state courts in this\ncase rejected Riley's Batson claim without discussing any of\nthe ample evidence that throws into question the\nexplanations offered by the prosecutor for striking two of\nthe black jurors . . . .\").3 This approach is inconsistent with\nthe federal habeas statute and Supreme Court precedent.\n\nThe provision of the federal habeas statute on which the\nmajority relies provides that if a state court's\n\"determination after a hearing on the merits of a factual\nissue\" is \"evidenced by a written finding, written opinion, or\nother reliable and adequate written indicia,\" that\ndetermination \"shall be presumed to be correct\" unless it is\nnot \"fairly supported by the record\" as a whole. 28 U.S.C.\nS2254(d)(8)(1988 & Supp. 1990)(amended 1996). Under this\nprovision, the state court's factual determination must\nsimply be evidenced by \"a written finding, written opinion,\nor other reliable and adequate written indicia,\" and it is not\neven necessary that a state court \"specifically articulate its\ncredibility findings.\" LaVallee v. Delle Rose , </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108743\"><a href=\"/opinion/108743/lavallee-v-delle-rose/\"><span class=\"volume\">410</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">690</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n692 (1973). See also Marshall v. Lonberger, 459 U.S. at\n433. Thus, 28 U.S.C. S 2254(d) plainly does not authorize\nus to disregard a state court's factual finding on the ground\nthat the state court failed to discuss all the evidence or to\nexplain why it was not persuaded by a particular piece of\nproof.\n\nI do not question that a judge, in making the factual\nfinding required by step three of Batson, should consider all\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. See, e.g., Maj Op. at 18 (\"With regard to both Nichols and McGuire,\nthe state courts failed to mention in their opinions the weaknesses in the\nState's explanations . . . .\"); id. at 20 (\"[T]he hearing judge discussed\nneither the statistics nor the State's failure to explain them[,] . . .\noverlooking and ignoring a significant segment of Riley's evidence . . .\n.\");\nid. at 21 (hearing judge made no \"reference to, or analysis of, Riley's\nevidence of pretext\"); id. at 28 (\"Here, the state courts failed to\nexamine\nall of the evidence to determine whether the State's proffered race-\nneutral explanations were pretextual. Not only is there no indication on\nthe record that the hearing judge engaged in the required analysis, but\nthere is no indication that the Delaware Supreme Court did so.\").\n\n                               87\n\fof the relevant evidence that has been adduced. But neither\nBatson nor any later Supreme Court or Third Circuit case4\nsuggests that a federal habeas court is free to reject the\nfactual findings of a state court if the state court does not\ncomment on all of the evidence or provide what the federal\ncourt regards as a satisfactory explanation for its finding.5\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4. The only Third Circuit case cited in this connection by the majority\n(see Maj. Op. at 35) is Jones v. Ryan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"601793\"><a href=\"/opinion/601793/kevin-jones-v-joseph-ryan-superintendent-state-correctional-institution/\"><span class=\"volume\">987</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">960</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1993). Jones,\nhowever, was very different from the present case (see footnote nine,\ninfra) and does not support the proposition that a finding of a state\ncourt\nis not entitled to the presumption of correctness if the state court did\nnot\nexplain why the court was not persuaded by particular items of evidence.\n\n5. Nor does the majority cite much other authority to support its\nposition. See Maj. Op. at 28, 30, 34, 35. The majority (at 28) quotes\ndictum in a footnote in United States v. McMillon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"661478\"><a href=\"/opinion/661478/united-states-v-julia-mcmillon-aka-julia-walker-aka-julia-bivens/\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">948</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 953 n.4\n(4th Cir. 1994)(emphasis added), to the effect that at step three of\nBatson\n\"the court then addresses and evaluates all evidence introduced by each\nside.\" The reasons for not attaching too much weight to one word\n(\"addresses\") in this statement are too obvious to require mention.\n\nThe majority cites two federal habeas cases in which courts of appeals\nfound great fault with the procedures used by state judges in\nadjudicating Batson objections. In Jordan v. LeFevre, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767962\"><a href=\"/opinion/767962/flanders-jordan-v-eugene-s-lefevre/\"><span class=\"volume\">206</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">196</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2d\nCir. 2000), the court of appeals held that the trial judge \"could not\nproperly decide the third Batson step\" because he \"resisted counsel's\nefforts to make arguments regarding the peremptory strikes so as to\ncreate a full record\" and instead \"ruled summarily\" after \"an extremely\nbrief colloquy.\" Id. at 201. Likewise, in Coulter v. Gilmore, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"757816\"><a href=\"/opinion/757816/dwayne-coulter-v-jerry-gilmore/\"><span class=\"volume\">155</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">912</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(7th Cir. 1998), the court of appeals spent several pages describing the\nbizarre nature of the procedure used by the state trial court in ruling on\nBatson objections. Id. at 915-16, 918. The court of appeals ultimately\nconcluded that the state court had not considered the totality of the\nrelevant circumstances and thus ordered that the petitioner be released\nif the state court did not conduct a Batson hearing using \"the proper\nmethodology.\" Id. at 922. The procedures used by the Delaware courts\nin the present case bear no resemblance to the procedures found\ndeficient in Jordan and Coulter.\n\nThe majority also cites two appeals in which the Sixth Circuit\nremanded cases for the district courts to provide more complete\nexplanations of Batson rulings. See United States v. Harris, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766256\"><a href=\"/opinion/766256/united-states-v-tyransee-a-harris/\"><span class=\"volume\">192</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">580</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 588 (6th Cir. 1999); United States v. Hill , </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"755176\"><a href=\"/opinion/755176/united-states-v-darrell-hill-97-5009-and-donald-l-gunn-97-5010/\"><span class=\"volume\">146</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">337</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th Cir.\n1998). These, however, were direct federal appeals, not habeas\nproceedings initiated by state prisoners, and the relief ordered --\nremands for fuller explanation -- goes far beyond what the majority\nordered here.\n\f88\n\fThe majority confuses the obligation to consider all of the\nrelevant evidence (something that a court should always do\nin making findings of fact) with the obligation to comment\non all of the evidence (an obligation that we are not free to\nimpose on state courts).\n\nIn this case, as I have noted, there is no question that\nthe state courts did precisely what step three of Batson\nrequired -- they made findings as to whether Riley had\nestablished purposeful discrimination. And they did so only\nafter discovery and a thorough hearing. There is no reason\nto believe that the state courts did not consider all of the\nrelevant evidence, including all of the evidence that the\nmajority now finds persuasive. The Delaware courts simply\ndid not comment on all of this evidence. (Judgments about\ncredibility based on a witness's demeanor often do not lend\nthemselves to such explanation). But the Delaware courts\nwere not obligated to comment on all of the evidence. The\nmajority in this case reviews the decisions of the Delaware\ncourts as if they were decisions of a Social Security\nadministrative law judge, who must, we have held,\"give\nsome reason for discounting the evidence she rejects.\"\nPlummer v. Apfel, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765512\"><a href=\"/opinion/765512/evelyn-plummer-v-kenneth-s-apfel-commissioner-of-social-security/\"><span class=\"volume\">186</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">422</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 429 (3d Cir. 1999). The\nDelaware courts, however, are not to be treated as if they\nwere federal administrative agencies.\n\nThe majority's relief. Even if the majority were correct\nthat the Delaware courts were obligated to explain on the\nrecord why they accepted the prosecution's explanations for\nits strikes and were not persuaded by Riley's evidence, that\nwould hardly justify the relief that the majority orders --\nthe granting of the writ unless Riley is re-tried. When a\ndecision is found to be faulty for failure to provide an\nadequate explanation, the logical remedy is to remand so\nthat an adequate explanation can be supplied. See, e.g.,\nFlorida Power & Light Co. v. Lorion, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111379\"><a href=\"/opinion/111379/florida-power-light-co-v-lorion/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">729</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 744\n(1985); Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. v. State Farm Mut., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110991\"><a href=\"/opinion/110991/motor-vehicle-mfrs-assn-of-united-states-inc-v-state-farm-mut/\"><span class=\"volume\">463</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 57 (1983). Here, however, the majority does not\ngive the Delaware courts a chance to comply with the\nmajority's newly found procedural requirements. Nor does\nthe majority remand to the District Court for a hearing and\nfindings specifically addressing the points that the majority\nviews as important. Instead, the majority orders that the\nwrit be granted unless Riley is re-tried.\n\n                               89\n\fHow the state courts' failure to address Riley's evidence\non the record can justify such relief is baffling. If the lack\nof explanations on the record is important to the majority's\nanalysis, then the case should be remanded so that\nexplanations may be provided. If no explanations on the\nrecord could satisfy the majority -- and I believe that to be\nthe case -- then the majority's lengthy discussion of the\ninadequacy of the Delaware courts' opinions is beside the\npoint.\n\n3. The majority's remaining reasons for rejecting the\nhearing judge's finding require little response. The majority\nnotes that, although the prosecutor testified that Nichols\npaused, \"the record reflects no such pause.\" Maj. Op. at 16.\nI have read many trial transcripts, and I do not recall any\nin which the court reporter noted that a witness had or had\nnot paused before answering a question.\n\nThe majority finds it significant that \"despite Nichols'\nalleged pause, the prosecutors did not ask the trial court to\nremove Nichols for cause.\" Maj. Op. at 17. The majority\nraises the question \"why if Nichols actually did pause `a\nsignificant pause,' the state did not seek to have him\nremoved for cause.\" Id. Does the majority seriously believe\nthat a prospective juror who pauses before answering a\nquestion about the death penalty may properly be removed\nfor cause?\n\nThe majority observes that \"[t]he record does not show\n. . . that any of the contemporaneous notes kept by the\nprosecutors as to some of the jurors reflected either the\nexistence of a pause or the concern about which[the\nprosecutor] testified six years later.\" Maj. Op. at 17. The\nprosecutor's notes, however, consist of a handwritten sheet\nwith a few words or abbreviations scrawled next to the\nnames of some of the prospective jurors. Nichols's name is\nnot even on this sheet. The notes by no means record the\nreasons for all of the prosecution's strikes.\n\nI wish there were some scientific test that could\ndetermine with complete certainty whether Nichols paused\nand whether the prosecutor told the truth. Unfortunately,\nthere is no such test. We must rely to a substantial degree\non the ability of the judge who heard the prosecutor's\n\n                               90\n\ftestimony to make an accurate assessment of his\ncredibility. There is no question that the hearing judge took\nhis responsibility seriously and made his finding in good\nfaith. Our role under the federal habeas statute is to\ndetermine whether that credibility finding is \"fairly\nsupported by the record.\" It is.\n\nC: Charles McGuire.\n\n1. Riley's strongest Batson claim concerns the\nprosecution's strike of Charles McGuire. At trial, the\nprosecutor first used a peremptory challenge against\nMcGuire and then immediately made the following\napplication to the trial judge:\n\n        [THE PROSECUTOR]: Your Honor, may I ask the\n       Court to reconsider charging the State for that strike.\n       This Mr. McGuire came to chambers yesterday and\n       expressed his belief that he didn't know if he could last\n       the two weeks [the estimated length of the trial], there\n       was some problem with work. He was an inspector or\n       something for the Department of Labor. I know he\n       came in yesterday.\n\n        THE COURT: I will not strike him for cause for that\n       reason. He asked to be excused yesterday and I\n       decided not to excuse him.\n\nApp. 250.\n\nAt the evidentiary hearing held before the hearing judge,\nthe prosecutor testified that he struck McGuire because\nMcGuire \"had previously requested to be excused from jury\nservice\" and because the prosecutor \"wanted attentive\njurors\" who were not worried about missing other\nobligations or activities while the trial took place. App. 801.\n\nThe defense called McGuire as a witness at the\nevidentiary hearing. McGuire testified that he was employed\nby the State of Delaware as a Social Security \"disability\nadjudicator,\" App. 846-47; that he had been reporting for\njury duty in the courthouse in Dover for two to three weeks\nbefore he was questioned in connection with the Riley case\nbut had not been seated on a jury, id. at 852-53; that while\nhe was away from work, the disability claims assigned to\n\n                               91\n\fhim would \"just sit[ ],\" id. at 850; that the director of his\noffice had told him that he was going to make a\"formal\nrequest\" that McGuire be excused, id. at 860; that such a\nrequest was sent, id. at 853, 856; and that the request had\nbeen discussed in chambers with the judge. Id . at 849-50,\n856. McGuire said, however, that he himself had never\nexpressed an unwillingness to serve on the jury and had\nbeen willing to do so. See id. at 850.\n\nThe hearing judge accepted the prosecutor's explanation\nof the reason for striking McGuire. The hearing judge\nfound:\n\n       The State peremptorily challenged Charles McGuire\n       because [the prosecutor] believed he requested to be\n       excused from jury duty and, therefore, may have been\n       unable or unwilling to serve for the entirety of the trial.\n       . . . McGuire's employer sent a letter requesting he be\n       released from jury duty because he could not be\n       replaced at his job if he was chosen for jury duty. The\n       letter by McGuire's employer clearly gave the State\n       reason to question whether McGuire would give his full\n       time and attention to the trial and whether he would\n       be able to serve for the entirety of the time projected for\n       the trial. Whether McGuire, in fact, did not request\n       relief from jury duty and did wish to serve is of no\n       consequence.\n\nRiley v. State, No. 200, 1988 at 4-5 (emphasis added). The\nhearing judge then noted that the state's explanation for\nstriking McGuire, was \"entirely unrelated to the juror's\nrace,\" and the judge credited that explanation. Id. at 5.\nObviously, by crediting an explanation that was\"entirely\nunrelated to the juror's race,\" the hearing judge necessarily\nfound that Riley had not \"established purposeful\ndiscrimination,\" Batson, 476 U.S. at 98, and the hearing\njudge thus fully complied with Batson's step three.6\n\nSeveral factors provide substantial support for this\nfinding. It is apparent that McGuire's work situation was on\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6. The majority, however, incorrectly suggests (Maj. Op. at 33) that\nfinding \"the prosecutor to be credible\" is different from finding that\npurposeful discrimination was not proved.\n\n                               92\n\fthe prosecutor's mind when McGuire was peremptorily\nchallenged because, as noted, immediately after striking\nMcGuire, the prosecutor asked that McGuire's dismissal be\ndeemed for cause since he had \"expressed his belief that he\ndidn't know if he could last the two weeks.\" App. 250. In\naddition, a reasonable prosecutor might well have wondered\nwhether McGuire's work situation would adversely affect\nhis attentiveness at trial. As noted, McGuire's supervisor\nhad made a \"formal request\" that he be excused\"because\nhe could not be replaced at his job if he was chosen for jury\nduty.\"7 Whether or not McGuire himself in fact wished to\nserve on the jury, the impression apparently was conveyed\nthat McGuire wanted to be excused and to return to work,\nsince the trial judge commented: \"He asked to be excused\nyesterday and I decided not to excuse him.\" See App. 250.\nUnder these circumstances, a reasonable prosecutor could\nhave been concerned that McGuire might have been\ninattentive at trial due to worry about missing work, leaving\nhis duties unattended, and perhaps incurring his\nsupervisor's displeasure.\n\nRiley attacks the hearing judge's finding on two grounds.\nFirst, he points out that, according to McGuire's testimony\nat the post-conviction relief evidentiary hearing, McGuire\nhimself did not ask to be excused. This argument is\nunpersuasive. Although McGuire testified that he did not\nask to be excused, the trial judge, as noted, stated at the\ntime of McGuire's dismissal: \"He asked to be excused\nyesterday and I decided not to excuse him.\" App. 250\n(emphasis added). Thus, McGuire, who was unable to\nremember many details at the time of the post-conviction\nrelief evidentiary hearing, see id. at 853, 857-62, may have\nbeen mistaken, or he may have conveyed the impression at\nthe time of trial that he personally wanted to be excused.\n\nSecond, Riley points out that the handwritten sheet\nprepared by the prosecutors during voir dire contains the\nfollowing notation next to the name of a white juror,\nCharles Reed, whom the prosecution did not peremptorily\nstrike: \"works Lowe's -- wants off.\" One of the prosecutors\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n7. Riley v. State, No. 200, 1988 at 4. See also App. 860 (McGuire's\ntestimony at the evidentiary hearing).\n\n                               93\n\fwas questioned about this notation by Riley's attorney at\nthe post-conviction relief evidentiary hearing, but the\nprosecutor testified that he had no recollection of Reed. See\nApp. 823-24.\n\nThe notation by Reed's name and the prosecutor's\ntestimony at the evidentiary hearing are certainly factors\nthat the hearing judge could have viewed as tending to\nundermine the credibility of the prosecutor's explanation for\nstriking McGuire, but the notation and the prosecutor's\ntestimony are insufficient to show that the hearing judge's\nfinding is not \"fairly supported by the record.\" 28 U.S.C.\nS 2254(d). It is reasonable to infer from the notation \"wants\noff \" that, at some point in the jury selection process, Reed\nexpressed a desire to be excused for some reason. As far as\nI am aware, however, the record does not establish why8 or\nhow strongly Reed wanted to be excused. The transcript of\nthe voir dire shows that, at the final stage of the jury\nselection process, the members of the venire were asked\nwhether there was \"any reason why [they] absolutely [could\nnot] serve,\" App. 223; that members of the venire then\nsuccessfully asked to be released for reasons such as a\npreviously planned vacation, id. at 253; but that Reed made\nno request to be excused at that time. See id . at 229-30.\nThus, as far as the record appears to reveal, Reed may have\nhad a relatively weak desire and reason to be excused, and\nhis situation may not have been at all comparable in this\nrespect to McGuire's.9\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n8. Although the notation \"wants off \" appears after the words \"works at\nLowe's,\" it is not clear that Reed's desire to be excused was related to\nhis\nemployment. The prosecutor's notes appear to contain notations of the\nemployment of other jurors.\n\n9. Many decisions have held that Batson is not contravened simply\nbecause two jurors exhibit similar characteristics and one is excluded\nwhile the other is retained. See, e.g., Matthews v. Evatt, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"734134\"><a href=\"/opinion/734134/earl-matthews-jr-v-parker-evatt-commissioner-south-carolina-department/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">907</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n918 (4th Cir. 1997); United States v.

Although it would be satisfying to\nknow why Reed was not stricken, that unanswered\nquestion is not enough, in view of the \"great deference\"10\nowed the hearing judge's credibility determination, to\ndemonstrate that the hearing judge's finding is not\"fairly\nsupported by the record.\"11 28 U.S.C. S 2254(d)(8) (1988 &\nSupp. 1990).\n\nIn an effort to bolster its unusual decision to overturn the\nhearing judge's credibility finding, the majority points to a\nstatement contained in the brief filed by the state in Riley's\ndirect appeal. The majority writes:\n\n       When Riley's direct appeal came before the Delaware\n       Supreme Court in 1984, the State justified the use of\n       race in selecting jurors in criminal trials. On that\n       occasion, which was the State's first opportunity to\n       defend the use of its peremptory challenges in Riley's\n       trial, the State did not offer a single race-neutral\n       explanation, not even as an alternate argument;\n       instead, it claimed that it was permissible -- even\n       socially desirable -- to exclude jurors based on what it\n       called `group association.' \"\n\nMaj. Op. at 25 (quoting App. 896).\n\nThis argument is not well taken. Responding to Riley's\nsuggestion that the Delaware Supreme Court should\nhold that individual race-based peremptories were\nunconstitutional, the state's brief argued as follows:\n\n       Because the Sixth Amendment does not support\n       [Riley's argument] and the decision in Swain v.\n       Alabama, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106997\"><a href=\"/opinion/106997/swain-v-alabama/\"><span class=\"volume\">380</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">202</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1965), more appropriately\n       recognizes how peremptory challenges, even those\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n10. Batson, 476 U.S. at 98 n.21.\n\n11. This case is very different from Jones v. Ryan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"601793\"><a href=\"/opinion/601793/kevin-jones-v-joseph-ryan-superintendent-state-correctional-institution/\"><span class=\"volume\">987</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">960</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1993).\nThere, exercising plenary review in the absence of any findings of fact by\na state court, we held that Batson was violated where the prosecutor\nexcluded a black juror who had a child approximately the same age as\nthe defendant, while retaining a white juror who was similarly situated.\nJones, 987 F.2d at 973. In the present case, we are limited to deciding\nwhether the state court finding is fairly supported by the evidence.\n\n                               95\n\f       exercised on the basis of group association, foster the\n       constitutional goal of an impartial jury, the state\n       asserts that no reversal is required here.\n\nApp. 896-97 (footnotes omitted). Thus, the state's brief --\nwhich the lead trial prosecutor did not even sign-- merely\nurged the state supreme court to follow the reasoning of the\nUnited States Supreme Court in what was then the\ngoverning federal precedent. It is far-fetched to interpret the\nstate's reliance on Swain as a tacit admission that its\nperemptories in this case were based on race -- particularly\nsince, in a footnote to the sentence quoted above, the state\nwas careful to deny that its challenges were racially based.12\n\nIt is also unreasonable to draw an adverse inference\nagainst the state for not providing race-neutral\nexplanations for its challenges in its appellate brief. Since\nthere was no evidence in the record regarding the reasons\nfor the strikes, the state could hardly have expected the\nstate supreme court to base a decision on explanations\nprovided without record support. The majority's arguments\nregarding the state's brief are insubstantial.\n\nThe majority's reliance on statistical evidence is even\nworse. In the Batson proceeding before the hearing judge,\nRiley made a proffer that no African American had served\non any of the three other first-degree murder trials that had\noccurred in Kent County within a year of his own and that\nin those cases the prosecution had peremptorily challenged\nfive African Americans. The three other trials were those of\nAndre Deputy, an African American, and two whites, Daniel\nPregent, who was acquitted, and Judith McBride, who was\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n12. The state's brief stated that it \"emphatically denie[d] that the\nprosecutor exercised any of his challenges solely on the assumption that\nthe juror's race, in the context of the facts of this case, indicated a\nverdict position adverse to the prosecution.\" App. 896. The majority\nseizes on the word \"solely\" in this sentence as a tacit admission that\nrace\nplayed a part in the decision to exercise peremptories. In my view, it is\nwholly unreasonable to read that much into the word\"solely.\" The\nSupreme Court in Batson itself used this same word in the same\ncontext. See 476 U.S. at 89 (emphasis added)(\"[T]he Equal Protection\nClause forbids the prosecutor to challenge potential jurors solely on\naccount of their race.\").\n\n                               96\n\fconvicted. With respect to these cases, no information was\nprovided at the time -- and none has been provided since\n-- about the identities of the prosecutors who participated\nin jury selection, the racial makeup of the venire, or the\nrace of jurors who were dismissed for cause or peremptorily\nchallenged by the defense.\n\nIn the trial of Andre Deputy, who was convicted and\nultimately executed, the state struck four whites, one\nAfrican American, and one person listed as \"Indian.\"\nDeputy argued that the prosecution's peremptory challenge\nof the African American venireperson violated Batson. See\nDeputy v. Taylor, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"666559\"><a href=\"/opinion/666559/andre-stanley-deputy-v-stanley-taylor-warden-sussex-correctional/\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1485</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1492 (3d Cir. 1994).\nDeputy's Batson argument was rejected in the district court\ndecision denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus,\nand our court affirmed. See id. at 1492. Since it has been\nheld that no Batson violation was shown in Deputy, it is\ndifficult to see how that case can be viewed as supporting\nRiley's argument here.\n\nIn Pregent's case, the state struck four whites and one\nblack. There is nothing before us to indicate that any\nBatson objection was made, and it is doubtful that the\npattern of strikes exercised by the prosecution sufficed to\nmake out a prima facie case.\n\nThe remaining case is the prosecution of Judith McBride\nfor murdering her husband. See McBride v. State , </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1506069\"><a href=\"/opinion/1506069/mcbride-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">174</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Del. 1984). The state exercised a total of 10 strikes, of\nwhich three were against potential jurors identified as black.13\nThere is nothing to indicate that any Batson objection was\nmade. Without in effect holding a Batson hearing, there is\nno way of determining whether any prosecution\nperemptories were based on race.\n\nAlthough Riley was represented at the Batson hearing by\na professor of law and has been represented in the federal\nhabeas proceeding by attorneys from one of the nation's\nleading law firms, no expert analysis of these statistics has\never been offered.14 According to the majority, however, the\n\"sophisticated analysis of a statistician\" is not needed to\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n13. According to Riley's statistics, five of those struck by the state\nwere\nwhite, and the race of two is not provided.\n14. The majority's statement that \"the procedural posture of the case\"\nprovided \"no opportunity\" for Riley to offer an expert analysis of his\nstatistics (Maj. Op. at 38) is difficult to understand. What stopped Riley\nfrom offering the evidence of a statistician as to the significance of the\nscant statistics that Riley provided?\n\f97\n\finterpret the significance of these statistics. Maj. Op. at 19.\n\"An amateur with a pocket calculator,\" the majority writes,\ncan calculate that \"there is little chance of randomly\nselecting four consecutive all white juries.\" Id.\n\nStatistics can be very revealing -- and also terribly\nmisleading in the hands of \"an amateur with a pocket\ncalculator.\" The majority's simplistic analysis treats the\nprospective jurors who were peremptorily challenged as if\nthey had no relevant characteristics other than race, as if\nthey were in effect black and white marbles in a jar from\nwhich the lawyers drew. In reality, however, these\nindividuals had many other characteristics, and without\ntaking those variables into account, it is simply not possible\nto determine whether the prosecution's strikes were based\non race or something else.\n\nThe dangers in the majority's approach can be easily\nillustrated. Suppose we asked our \"amateur with a pocket\ncalculator\" whether the American people take right- or left-\nhandedness into account in choosing their Presidents.\nAlthough only about 10% of the population is left-handed,\nleft-handers have won five of the last six presidential\nelections.15 Our \"amateur with a calculator\" would conclude\nthat \"there is little chance of randomly selecting\" left-\nhanders in five out of six presidential elections. But does it\nfollow that the voters cast their ballots based on whether a\ncandidate was right- or left-handed?\n\nWhether even a careful multiple-regression analysis of\nperemptory challenge statistics in other cases would suffice\nto show that a Batson violation occurred in this case is\nunclear. Cf. McClesky v. Kemp, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111869\"><a href=\"/opinion/111869/mccleskey-v-kemp/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">279</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1987). Here,\nhowever, we have not been presented with any expert\nstatistical evidence.\n\nThe majority and the concurrence argue that an adverse\ninference should be drawn against the state for failing to\ncome forward with data to rebut Riley's statistics. I see no\nbasis for this approach. Whether an adverse inference\nshould be drawn under particular circumstances based on\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n15. See \"Forget Left-Wing. Say Hello to Left-Handed Politics,\" New York\nTimes, Jan. 23, 2000.\n\n                               98\n\fa party's failure to produce evidence in a state proceeding\nis in the first instance a question of state law, and unless\na state court's failure to draw such an inference in a\nparticular case denies due process or a fair and adequate\nhearing, a federal habeas court should be reluctant to\nreject the state court's ruling. Cf. 28 U.S.C. S 2254 (6) and\n(7) (1988 & Supp. 1990) (amended 1996). Moreover, even if\nthis were a collateral attack on a federal conviction, we\nwould defer to the decision of the judge who conducted the\nhearing as to whether the circumstances justified the\ndrawing of adverse inference and would reverse only if the\njudge committed an abuse of discretion. See, e.g., Bouzo v.\nCitibank, N.A., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">51</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 60 (2d Cir. 2000).\n\nHere, the state courts' failure to draw such an inference\ncertainly did not constitute an abuse of discretion. The\nstate was never given notice that it had any obligation to\nprovide additional data, and it is not at all clear what sort\nof evidence the majority expects the state to have provided.\nThe information that is most critically lacking-- the\nprosecutors' reasons for striking the five African American\nvenire members in the Deputy, McBride, and Pregent cases\n-- probably could not have been obtained without in effect\nconducting retrospective Batson hearings in those cases.\nDoes the majority think that such a hearing would have\nbeen practical? Or does the majority think that the state\nshould have retained am expert to analyze the state's use\nof peremptory challenges in some other set of cases? In\norder to make such an analysis, the expert probably would\nhave needed detailed information about the prospective\njurors whom the state did and did not strike -- e.g., their\nages, marital status, education, occupations, and past\nexperiences with law enforcement, to name just a few of the\nmyriad variables that often figure in decisions about\nperemptory challenges. We have no indication that such\ninformation was available, and in any event, compiling and\nanalyzing the data concerning a reasonable sample of cases\ncould have been a massive undertaking. In my view, it is\nentirely unwarranted to hold that the state courts abused\ntheir discretion because they did not draw adverse\ninferences from the state's failure to volunteer to conduct\nsuch a study in response to the statistics that Riley\nproffered.\n\n                               99\n\fIn sum, I see no ground for overturning the hearing\njudge's credibility findings. I would thus hold that the\npresumption of correctness has not been overcome and\nwould reject Riley's Batson argument. The majority -- by in\neffect making its own credibility findings on the cold state\ncourt record -- seriously errs. See Marshall v. Lonberger,\n459 U.S. at 434.\n\nII.\n\nI now turn to the majority's holding that a remark made\nby the prosecutor in closing argument at the penalty phase\nof the trial violated Caldwell v. Mississippi , supra. In\nCaldwell, the defense attorney's closing argument asked the\njury to \"confront both the gravity and responsibility of\ncalling for another's death.\" 472 U.S. at 324. In response,\nthe prosecutor took strong exception to the defense\nattorney's comments and stated:\n\n       Now, they would have you believe that you're going to\n       kill this man and they know -- they know that your\n       decision is not the final decision. My God, how unfair\n       can you be? Your job is reviewable. They know it. . . .\n       For they know, as I know, and as [the judge] has told\n       you, that the decision you render is automatically\n       reviewable by the Supreme Court.\n\nId. at 325-26.\n\nBy a vote of five to three, the United States Supreme\nCourt reversed the defendant's death sentence. The\nplurality opinion approved by four justices concluded that\nthe prosecutor's comments were improper for two reasons:\nfirst, because the prosecutor's description of the state\nscheme of appellate review was not \"accurate\" and, second,\nbecause the availability of appellate review was\"wholly\nirrelevant to the determination of the appropriate sentence.\"\nId.\n\nJustice O'Connor, who cast the deciding fifth vote for\nreversal, refused to endorse the principle that\"the giving of\nnonmisleading and accurate information regarding the\njury's role in the sentencing scheme is irrelevant to the\nsentencing decision.\" 472 U.S. at 341 (opinion of O'Connor,\n\n                               100\n\fJ.) (emphasis added). However, she agreed that the\nprosecutor's statements were improper because they\n\"creat[ed] the mistaken impression that automatic appellate\nreview of the jury's sentence would provide the\nauthoritative determination of whether death was\nappropriate,\" whereas in fact the state supreme court\nexercised only a narrow scope of review. Id.\n\nIn subsequent cases, the Court has clarified the holding\nin Caldwell. In Romano v. Oklahoma, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117851\"><a href=\"/opinion/117851/romano-v-oklahoma/\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 9 (1994),\nthe Court wrote as follows:\n\n       As Justice O'CONNOR supplied the fifth vote in\n       Caldwell, and concurred on grounds narrower than\n       those put forth by the plurality, her position is\n       controlling. See Marks v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109611\"><a href=\"/opinion/109611/marks-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">430</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">188</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n       193 (1977) . . . . Accordingly, we have since read\n       Caldwell as \"relevant only to certain types of comment\n       --those that mislead the jury as to its role in the\n       sentencing process in a way that allows the jury to feel\n       less responsible than it should for the sentencing\n       decision.\" Durden v.

Thus, \"[t]o establish a Caldwell violation,\n       a defendant necessarily must show that the remarks to\n       the jury improperly described the role assigned to the\n       jury by local law.\" Dugger v. Adams, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112210\"><a href=\"/opinion/112210/dugger-v-adams/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">401</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 407\n       (1989), see also Sawyer v.

The prosecutor stated:\n\n       As the Judge has explained to you we have a specific\n       statute with regard to what occurred in a penalty\n       hearing on a capital case.\n\n       Let me say at the outset that what you do today is\n       automatically reviewed by our Supreme Court and that\n       is why there is an automatic review on the death\n\n                                101\n\f       penalty. That is why, if you return a decision of death,\n       that is why you will receive and have to fill out a two-\n       page interrogatory that the Court will give you. This is\n       an interrogatory that specifically sets out the questions\n       that the State request and whether or not you believe\n       it beyond a reasonable doubt and if you want in your\n       determination, if you believe the sentence should be\n       death then each and every one of you has to sign this.\n       This goes to the Supreme Court. That is why it is\n       concise and we believe clear and it should be looked\n       carefully on and answered appropriately.\n\nApp. 393 (emphasis added). Riley argues that the\nhighlighted words quoted above violated Caldwell .\n\nIn its decision on direct appeal, the Delaware Supreme\nCourt responded to this argument as follows:\n\n       [T]he prosecutor's remarks in no way suggested that\n       responsibility for ultimately determining whether\n       defendant faced life imprisonment or death rested\n       elsewhere. The prosecutor's passing comment to the\n       jury that its decision would be \"automatically reviewed\"\n       was fairly made in the context of the prosecutor's\n       preceding reference to the \"specific statute[controlling]\n       a penalty hearing on a capital case.\" 11 Del.C.S 4209.\n       Since subsection (g) of S 4209 mandates the\"Automatic\n       Review of Death Penalty by Delaware Supreme Court\",\n       the prosecutor in the instant case was simply quoting\n       the statute. In no sense may it reasonably be said that\n       the prosecutor was either misstating the law,\n       misleading the jury as to its role, or minimizing its\n       sentencing responsibility.\n\n496 A.2d at 1025 (alteration in original). I agree with this\nanalysis.\n\nThe prosecutor's remarks in Caldwell were\"quite\nfocused, unambiguous, and strong.\" 472 U.S. at 340. The\nclear message was that, contrary to the suggestion of\ndefense counsel that the jury should \"confront both the\ngravity and responsibility of calling for another's death,\" id.\nat 324, the jury need not shoulder that responsibility\nbecause \"the authoritative determination of whether death\nwas appropriate\" would be made by the state supreme\n\n                               102\n\fcourt. Id. at 343 (Opinion of O'Connor, J.). It was in this\nsense that the remarks \" `improperly described the role\nassigned to the jury by local law' \"16 and thus \" `allowed the\njury to feel less responsible than it should for the\nsentencing decision.' \"17\n\nThe prosecutor's remarks in this case were very different.\nHere, the prosecutor made accurate, unemotional, passing\nremarks in the context of describing the state statute and\nexplaining why the jury would have to \"fill out a two-page\ninterrogatory\" if it returned a capital sentence. These\nremarks did not convey the message that the jury should\nnot confront the gravity of returning a death verdict, and\nthus the mere mention of the fact that there would be an\nautomatic appeal to the state supreme court did not\nmislead the jury as to its role in the sentencing process. In\nthis connection, it is noteworthy that after the closing\narguments, the trial judge instructed the jury on its role\nusing language that left no doubt about its responsibility.\nThe trial judge stated: \"Where the jury submits such a\nfinding and recommendation, the Court shall sentence the\ndefendant to death.\" See 585 A.2d at 731 (emphasis added).\nA \"recommendation of death, supported by the evidence,\nshall be binding on the Court.\" Id. (emphasis added). \"Your\nunanimous recommendation for the imposition of the death\npenalty, if supported by the evidence, is binding on the\nCourt.\" Id. at 734 (emphasis added). In light of the\nsubstantial factual differences between Caldwell and this\ncase, and in light of the Supreme Court's subsequent\nexplanation of the meaning of Caldwell, I would reject\nRiley's Caldwell claim.\n\nThe majority appears to hold that a Caldwell violation\noccurred simply because the prosecutor accurately stated\nthat there would be an automatic appeal to the state\nsupreme court without attempting to explain the scope of\nreview that the state supreme court would exercise. I do not\nagree with this reading of Caldwell. Neither Justice\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n16. Romano v. Oklahoma, 512 U.S. at 9 (quoting Dugger v. Adams, 489\nU.S. at 407).\n\n17. Romano v. Oklahoma, 512 U.S. at 9 (quoting Durden v. Wainwright,\n477 U.S. at 184, n.15).\n\n                               103\n\fO'Connor's controlling opinion in Caldwell nor the Court's\nsubsequent explanation in Romano took the position that\nan unadorned reference to automatic judicial review of a\ncapital verdict is enough to violate the Constitution. And\nsuch a holding would make little sense. As the Seventh\nCircuit has noted:\n\n       Everyone knows that after a death sentence is\n       imposed, there are tiers of appellate review designed to\n       catch errors; the prosecutor wasn't telling the jurors\n       anything they didn't know already. Appellate review is\n       a fact of almost all criminal cases that are tried.\n       Knowledge of this does not cause jurors to take lightly\n       their sentencing responsibilities.\n\nFleenor v. Anderson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"762643\"><a href=\"/opinion/762643/dh-fleenor-v-ron-anderson-superintendent-of-indiana-state-prison/\"><span class=\"volume\">171</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1096</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1098 (7th Cir. 1999).\nWhat Caldwell forbids is not a simple reference to\nautomatic appellate review, but the suggestion that the\nscope of review is broader than it is in fact. The remarks in\nCaldwell conveyed such a suggestion; the comments here\ndid not. I would therefore hold that no Caldwell violation\noccurred.\n\nIII.\n\nReviewing habeas decisions in capital cases is one of the\nmost important and difficult responsibilities of this court.\nOur role is vital -- but limited -- and is not to be confused\nwith that of the jury or the various branches of state\ngovernment.
