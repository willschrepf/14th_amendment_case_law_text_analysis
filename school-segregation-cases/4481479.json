They were detained beginning in the fall of\n\n2003, and ultimately were released without being charged with a\n\ncrime.    In    2008,    they   filed   this    civil    action     against      CACI\n\nPremier   Technology,       Inc.      (CACI),    which       provided      contract\n\ninterrogation    services       for   the   military    at    the   time    of    the\n\nalleged mistreatment.\n\n     In their third amended complaint, the plaintiffs alleged\n\npursuant to the Alien Tort Statute (ATS), 28 U.S.C. § 1350, that\n\nCACI employees committed acts involving torture and war crimes,\n\nand cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment.               The plaintiffs also\n\nasserted various tort claims under the common law, including\n\nassault and battery, sexual assault and battery, and intentional\n\ninfliction of emotional distress.\n\n     This case is before this Court for the fourth time.                    In our\n\nmost recent decision, we remanded the case to the district court\n\nto conduct jurisdictional discovery on the issue whether the\n\npolitical question doctrine barred the plaintiffs’ claims.                        On\n\nremand, after reopening discovery, the district court dismissed\n\nthe plaintiffs’ complaint on the ground that it presented a non-\n\n                                        4\n\fjusticiable political question.                        The court based its decision on\n\nthree grounds: (1) that the military exercised direct control\n\nover     interrogation              operations          at     Abu     Ghraib;         (2)        that\n\nadjudication of the plaintiffs’ claims would require the court\n\nimproperly        to   question       sensitive          military      judgments;        and       (3)\n\nthat the court lacked any judicially manageable standards to\n\nresolve the plaintiffs’ claims.\n\n       The   plaintiffs        once        again       appeal.       Upon    our       review,     we\n\nconclude      that      the    district          court       erred   in     its    analysis        by\n\nfailing      to     determine        whether       the       military     exercised          actual\n\ncontrol      over      any    of    CACI’s       alleged       conduct.           We   hold       that\n\nconduct by CACI employees that was unlawful when committed is\n\njusticiable,        irrespective           whether       that      conduct    occurred        under\n\nthe actual control of the military.                           We further hold that acts\n\ncommitted by CACI employees are shielded from judicial review\n\nunder the political question doctrine if they were not unlawful\n\nwhen   committed        and    occurred          under       the   actual    control         of    the\n\nmilitary or involved sensitive military judgments.\n\n       We    therefore        vacate       the    district         court’s    judgment.            We\n\nremand the case for the district court to re-examine its subject\n\nmatter      jurisdiction           under    the    political         question      doctrine         in\n\naccordance with the above holdings.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   5\n\f                                            I.\n\n       We recounted the circumstances underlying the plaintiffs’\n\ncomplaint and the complicated procedural history of this case at\n\nlength    in   our   previous        opinion,     Al     Shimari      v.    CACI    Premier\n\nTech., Inc., 758 F.3d 516 (4th Cir. 2014) (Al Shimari III).                              We\n\nwill review here only the facts relevant to the present appeal.\n\n       Following the invasion of Iraq in 2003, the United States\n\ntook    control    of     Abu   Ghraib      prison     (Abu     Ghraib),      a    facility\n\nlocated near Baghdad, Iraq that previously was under the control\n\nof Saddam Hussein.            Upon assuming control of the facility, the\n\nUnited    States     military     used      the   prison       to    detain    criminals,\n\nenemies of the provisional government, and other persons held\n\nfor interrogation related to intelligence gathering.                               Due to a\n\nshortage of military interrogators, the United States government\n\nentered     into     a    contract      with      CACI    to        provide    additional\n\ninterrogation services at Abu Ghraib.\n\n       As documented in a later investigation conducted by the\n\nUnited    States     Department        of   Defense,      “numerous         incidents    of\n\nsadistic, blatant, and wanton criminal abuses were inflicted on\n\nseveral detainees” at Abu Ghraib between October and December\n\n2003.     Al Shimari III, 758 F.3d at 521 (citing Maj. Gen. Antonio\n\nM.   Taguba,   Article        15-6   Investigation         of    the    800th      Military\n\nPolice    Brigade        16   (2004)    (Taguba        Report)).           Department    of\n\nDefense investigators concluded that CACI interrogators as well\n\n                                             6\n\fas    military       personnel       engaged          in    such    abusive      conduct.         Id.\n\n(citing Taguba Report at 48 and Maj. Gen. George R. Fay, Article\n\n15-6    Investigation          of    the        Abu      Ghraib     Detention      Facility       and\n\n205th Military Intelligence Brigade 7-8, 84, 86-87, 89, 116-17,\n\n132-35       (2004)).         Numerous          service          members    were     disciplined\n\nadministratively or punished under military law by court martial\n\nfor    conduct       related        to     these          acts.      Some       service     members\n\nreceived significant terms of imprisonment for their role in\n\nthese offenses.\n\n       The        plaintiffs        alleged          in     their     complaint       that       CACI\n\ninterrogators            entered         into     a        conspiracy       with     low-ranking\n\nmilitary          police    officials           to        commit    abusive       acts      on    the\n\nplaintiffs, in order to “soften up” the detainees so that they\n\nwould    be       more     responsive       during          later    interrogations.              The\n\nplaintiffs         further     alleged       that         they     were    victims    of    a    wide\n\nrange        of     mistreatment,           including              being     beaten,        choked,\n\n“subjected to electric shocks,” “repeatedly shot in the head\n\nwith     a    taser        gun,”     “forcibly             subjected       to    sexual      acts,”\n\nsubjected to sensory deprivation, placed in stress positions for\n\nextended periods of time, deprived of food, water, and sleep,\n\nthreatened with unleashed dogs and death, and forced to wear\n\nwomen’s underwear.\n\n       Additionally,               the      plaintiffs               alleged         that        CACI\n\ninterrogators              “instigated,               directed,            participated           in,\n\n                                                     7\n\fencouraged, and aided and abetted conduct towards detainees that\n\nclearly violated the Geneva Conventions, the Army Field Manual,\n\nand    the    laws      of     the     United       States.”           According       to    the\n\nplaintiffs,       most    of    these    acts       of     abuse    occurred       during    the\n\nnighttime shift at the prison, in order to reduce the likelihood\n\nthat    nonparticipants           would        learn       of      this     conduct.         The\n\nplaintiffs        contend      that     these       acts      of    abuse     were    possible\n\nbecause      of   a    “command       vacuum”       at   Abu    Ghraib,      caused     by   the\n\nfailure of military leaders to exercise effective oversight over\n\nCACI interrogators and military police.\n\n       CACI moved to dismiss the plaintiffs’ complaint on several\n\ngrounds,      including        the     political         question         doctrine,    federal\n\npreemption, derivative sovereign immunity, and lack of subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction under the ATS.                         The district court denied\n\nthe defendants’ motion, holding in part that the plaintiffs’\n\nclaims did not present a political question.                              Nevertheless, the\n\ncourt concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over the plaintiffs’\n\nATS    claims,     because      CACI     was    a    private        party    rather     than   a\n\ngovernmental          actor,   and     opined       that      those    claims      could     only\n\nproceed under diversity or federal question jurisdiction.\n\n       On    appeal,      a    panel     of     this      Court       concluded      that    the\n\nplaintiffs’       claims       were    preempted         by     federal      law     under   the\n\nSupreme Court’s decision in Boyle v. United Technologies Corp.,\n\n487 U.S. 500 (1988).              Al Shimari v. CACI Int’l, Inc., 658 F.3d\n\n                                                8\n\f413 (4th Cir. 2011) (Al Shimari I), vacated, 679 F.3d 205 (4th\n\nCir. 2012) (en banc).         On rehearing en banc, this Court vacated\n\nthe panel decision and dismissed CACI’s appeal as interlocutory.\n\nAl Shimari v. CACI Int’l, Inc., 679 F.3d 205 (4th Cir. 2012) (en\n\nbanc) (Al Shimari II).\n\n      On remand from Al Shimari II, the district court reinstated\n\nthe plaintiffs’ ATS claims, but dismissed without prejudice the\n\nplaintiffs’ claims alleging a conspiracy between CACI and the\n\nmilitary. 1    The district court dismissed as barred by the statute\n\nof    limitations    the   common     law   claims    brought     by     all   the\n\nplaintiffs except Al Shimari.          In response, the plaintiffs filed\n\na third amended complaint to supplement their allegations of\n\nconspiracy, limit their common law claims to Al Shimari, and\n\nname CACI as the only defendant.             The third amended complaint\n\n(the complaint) is the complaint at issue in this appeal.\n\n      In April 2013, shortly after the third amended complaint\n\nwas   filed,   the   deadline   for    discovery     on   the   merits    of   the\n\nplaintiffs’ claims expired.           The same week, the Supreme Court\n\nissued its decision in Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., 133\n\nS.    Ct.   1659    (2013),   which    imposed     certain      limitations    on\n\nextraterritorial application of the ATS.             Relying on Kiobel, the\n\n\n      1The court also dismissed with prejudice the plaintiffs’\nclaims against the parent company of CACI, CACI International,\nand the conspiracy claims against individual CACI employees.\n\n\n                                       9\n\fdistrict court dismissed the plaintiffs’ ATS claims, because the\n\nunderlying conduct occurred exclusively in Iraq.                                The district\n\ncourt also dismissed Al Shimari’s common law tort claims under\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), holding that Iraqi law\n\ndid not permit imposition of liability on CACI.\n\n      On    appeal       from     that     decision,           in    Al     Shimari     III     we\n\nconcluded      that     the     district     court          had   jurisdiction        over     the\n\nplaintiffs’ ATS claims under the Supreme Court’s reasoning in\n\nKiobel.      758 F.3d 516 (4th Cir. 2014).                               Although CACI also\n\nargued     that    the    case        should      be        dismissed      pursuant     to     the\n\npolitical question doctrine, we declined to decide the political\n\nquestion issue based on the limited appellate record available\n\nat the time.            Instead, we vacated the district court’s order\n\ndismissing      the     ATS     and    common         law    claims,      and   remanded       the\n\nentire case for the district court to develop the factual record\n\nregarding      the      extent        of   the        military’s         control   over       CACI\n\ninterrogators and whether CACI’s intended defenses raised any\n\npolitical issues.         Id. at 536-37.\n\n      On remand from Al Shimari III, the district court reopened\n\nthe   record      for   jurisdictional            discovery         on    the   issue   of     the\n\npolitical question doctrine, although it appears that minimal,\n\n\n\n\n                                                 10\n\fif    any,   additional       discovery     was    taken. 2      As   noted      above,\n\nfollowing      the    reopened     discovery      period,     the   district         court\n\ndismissed all the plaintiffs’ claims under Federal Rule of Civil\n\nProcedure     12(b)(1)       on   the   ground    that    they   presented      a     non-\n\njusticiable political question.                 The plaintiffs now appeal the\n\ndistrict court’s dismissal of their complaint on this ground.\n\n\n\n                                         II.\n\n       The plaintiffs contend that the district court erred in\n\ndismissing      their        complaint     as     non-justiciable         under       the\n\npolitical      question      doctrine.          They     first   assert       that    the\n\ndistrict court erred in finding that the military had direct\n\ncontrol over formal interrogations at Abu Ghraib prison, and in\n\nfailing to evaluate whether the military actually exercised such\n\ncontrol      during    related     activities      that    occurred     outside       the\n\nformal interrogation process.              In the plaintiffs’ view, we are\n\nnot   presented       with   a    political      question,    because     a    “command\n\nvacuum” existed at Abu Ghraib in which the military did not\n\nexercise actual control over the conduct of the military police\n\nand the CACI interrogators.\n\n\n\n\n       2\n       Notably, after eight years of litigation, to date only one\nof the plaintiffs has been deposed in this case, because the\nUnited States government has not allowed the plaintiffs to enter\nthe United States.\n\n\n                                          11\n\f       The    plaintiffs     also        argue    that     their    claims     would    not\n\nrequire      the    courts   to        evaluate    sensitive       military     judgments\n\nbecause      the    claims   challenge        the    legality,        rather    than    the\n\nreasonableness, of CACI’s conduct.                    Separately, the plaintiffs\n\nassert    that      the   district       court     erred    in     concluding    that    it\n\nlacked manageable standards for resolving their claims.\n\n       In response, CACI contends that the district court properly\n\nconcluded      that       this    case      presents       a     political      question.\n\nAccording      to    CACI,       the     district     court’s       finding     that    the\n\nmilitary exercised control over interrogation operations at Abu\n\nGhraib ends the issue of justiciability in this case.                           CACI also\n\nmaintains that the district court correctly held that the case\n\nis non-justiciable because judicial review of the interrogation\n\ntactics      used    would       require     a     court    to     question     sensitive\n\nmilitary judgments.              Finally, CACI asserts that the district\n\ncourt correctly concluded that it lacked manageable standards\n\nfor resolving the plaintiffs’ claims.                      We disagree with CACI’s\n\narguments.\n\n\n\n                                            III.\n\n       In reviewing a district court’s dismissal of a claim for\n\nlack   of    jurisdiction         under     Federal      Rule    of   Civil     Procedure\n\n12(b)(1), we review the court’s factual findings for clear error\n\nand its legal conclusions de novo.

We may consider the\n\nplaintiffs’       pleadings        as    “mere      evidence”       on    the    question    of\n\njurisdiction,          and   may        also   consider          evidence       outside     the\n\npleadings without converting the motion to dismiss into a motion\n\nfor summary judgment.           Id.\n\n       The   district        court        is   authorized          to     resolve       factual\n\ndisputes in evaluating its subject matter jurisdiction.

Although\n\nmost    military    decisions     are     committed         exclusively    to    the\n\nexecutive branch, a claim is not shielded from judicial review\n\nmerely because it arose from action taken under orders of the\n\nmilitary.

Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 211 (1962))\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n       The Supreme Court established a six-factor test in Baker v.\n\nCarr, 369 U.S. 186 (1962) (the Baker factors), to aid courts in\n\ndetermining whether a case presents a political question.                       These\n\nfactors   ask   whether   there    is:       “(1)   a     textually   demonstrable\n\nconstitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political\n\ndepartment, (2) a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable\n\nstandards   for    resolving    the     issue,      (3)    the   impossibility    of\n\ndeciding the issue without an initial policy determination of a\n\nkind clearly for nonjudicial discretion, (4) the impossibility\n\nof a court’s undertaking independent resolution of the issue\n\nwithout expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches\n\nof government, (5) an unusual need for unquestioning adherence\n\nto a political decision already made, or (6) the potentiality of\n\nembarrassment      from   multifarious          pronouncements        by   various\n\ndepartments on one question.”           Burn Pit, 744 F.3d at 334 (citing\n\n                                        14\n\fBaker, 369 U.S. at 217) (internal quotations and alterations\n\nomitted).\n\n     In Taylor v. Kellogg Brown & Root Services, Inc., 658 F.3d\n\n402 (4th Cir. 2011), we considered the proper application of the\n\nBaker   factors     to   cases   involving         the    civil    liability         of   a\n\ngovernment contractor in a negligence case.                       We distilled the\n\nBaker     factors      into    two     questions         for    consideration             in\n\ndetermining whether a court has subject matter jurisdiction in a\n\nsuit against a government contractor.                    We first asked “whether\n\nthe government contractor was under the ‘plenary’ or ‘direct’\n\ncontrol of the military” (direct control).                     Al Shimari III, 758\n\nF.3d at 533 (quoting Taylor, 658 F.3d at 411).                     Second, we asked\n\nwhether “national defense interests were ‘closely intertwined’\n\nwith military decisions governing the contractor’s conduct, such\n\nthat a decision on the merits of the claim ‘would require the\n\njudiciary to question actual, sensitive judgments made by the\n\nmilitary.’”     Id. at 533-34 (quoting Taylor, 658 F.3d at 411).\n\nAn affirmative response to either of the two Taylor factors,\n\nnamely,   the   fact     of   direct   control      or    the     need       to   question\n\nsensitive military judgments, generally triggers application of\n\nthe political question doctrine.             Id.\n\n     The plaintiff in Taylor, a Marine who suffered injuries\n\nresulting from an electrical shock sustained on a military base\n\nin   Iraq,    asserted    a    negligence      claim      against        a    government\n\n                                        15\n\fcontractor based on the contractor’s activation of a generator\n\nwhile the plaintiff was performing work on a wiring box.                              658\n\nF.3d   at    403-04.       We    concluded        that    because      the   contractor\n\nintended     to       assert    as    a   defense        that    the    military      was\n\ncontributorily negligent, the district court would be forced to\n\n“question     actual,     sensitive       judgments       made   by    the   military.”\n\nId. at 411-12 (internal quotation marks omitted).                        We therefore\n\nheld that the political question doctrine deprived the court of\n\njurisdiction to consider the plaintiff’s negligence claim.                            Id.\n\nat 412.\n\n       Our   holding      in    Taylor    reflected       our    concern     that    when\n\nnational defense interests are at stake, courts must carefully\n\nassess the extent to which these interests may be implicated in\n\nany litigation of a plaintiff’s claims involving the conduct of\n\na military contractor.               Taylor, 658 F.3d at 409-10.                We give\n\nthis    question       particular      attention     because      courts       are   ill-\n\nequipped     to   evaluate      discretionary       operational        decisions     made\n\nby, or at the direction of, the military on the battlefield.\n\nSee generally Carmichael v. Kellogg, Brown & Root Servs., Inc.,\n\n572 F.3d 1271 (11th Cir. 2009).\n\n                                             B.\n\n       The present case requires us to examine the factors and\n\nrelated considerations discussed in Taylor.                         However, because\n\nTaylor    was     a   negligence      case    and   the    present      case   involves\n\n                                             16\n\fallegations       of    intentional         acts,    we    frame     our    analysis       in\n\naccordance with that distinction.\n\n                                            i.\n\n       As stated above, the first Taylor factor asks whether the\n\nacts   occurred        while    the    government        contractor       was    under    the\n\ndirect control of the military.                    Taylor, 658 F.3d at 411.                In\n\nAl Shimari III, we also described this factor in terms of “the\n\nextent to which military personnel actually exercised control”\n\nover the contractor’s acts.                 Al Shimari III, 758 F.3d at 535.\n\nIn the present case, after considering this first Taylor factor,\n\nthe    district    court       credited      the     evidence      that    the    military\n\nmaintained formal control over the interrogations, and concluded\n\nthat the case presented a political question depriving the court\n\nof subject matter jurisdiction.\n\n       In   the        district       court,       the    evidence        regarding       the\n\nmilitary’s       control       over   the    CACI     interrogators        proceeded       on\n\nparallel    tracks,       with    evidence         demonstrating      formal      military\n\ncontrol presented alongside evidence showing that the military\n\nfailed to exercise actual control over the interrogators.                                With\n\nregard to formal control, the record shows that the military was\n\nin charge of the official command structure at Abu Ghraib and\n\ninstituted procedures governing the interrogation process.                               For\n\nexample,    in    September       and     October        2003,   military       leadership\n\nlocated     in    Baghdad        issued      two     memoranda      establishing         the\n\n                                             17\n\fparticularized      rules    of    engagement       for   interrogations          (IROEs)\n\nconducted at Abu Ghraib, which authorized the use of several,\n\nspecific     interrogation             techniques. 3          In     addition,          all\n\ninterrogators were required to submit interrogation plans to the\n\nmilitary chain of command for advance approval.                            These plans\n\nspecified     the     interrogation          methods       that      the     particular\n\ninterrogators       intended      to     employ   and     included     requests         for\n\nseparate approval of more aggressive tactics, if necessary.\n\n     Other evidence in the record, however, indicated that the\n\nmilitary     failed    to    exercise       actual       control     over    the       work\n\nconducted by the CACI interrogators.                   In one government report,\n\nan investigator unequivocally concluded that military leaders at\n\nAbu Ghraib “failed to supervise subordinates or provide direct\n\noversight”    of     the    mission,       and    that    the      “lack    of    command\n\npresence, particularly at night, was clear.” 4                      Lt. Gen. Anthony\n\nR. Jones, AR 15-6 Investigation of the Abu Ghraib Prison and\n\n205th    Military     Intelligence        Brigade      1137     (2004).          The   same\n\nreport emphasized that interrogation operations were “plagued by\n\n\n     3  We observe that the September 2003 IROE memorandum\nauthorized aggressive interrogation tactics to be used under\ncertain conditions, including the use of stress positions and\n“sleep management.”  The later, superseding memorandum removed\nthese tactics.\n\n     4 Generally, investigative government reports of this nature\nare admissible as an exception to the rule against hearsay under\nFederal Rule of Evidence 803(8)(A)(iii).\n\n\n                                           18\n\fa lack of an organizational chain of command presence and by a\n\nlack of proper actions to establish standards and training” by\n\nsenior leadership.     Id.     Additional evidence in the record also\n\nindicates   that    CACI    interrogators    ordered     low-level     military\n\npersonnel to mistreat detainees.            This evidence supported the\n\nplaintiffs’ contention that the formal command authority held by\n\nthe military did not translate into actual control of day-to-day\n\ninterrogation operations.\n\n     The    above   evidence     of   a    “command    vacuum”      raises   the\n\nquestion whether the military exercised actual control over any\n\ninterrogation-related        activities    during     which   the    challenged\n\nconduct occurred.          Also, through operation of the Army Field\n\nManual 5 and IROEs, the military may have expressly prohibited the\n\n\n     5 The United States Department of the Army Field Manual 34-\n52, Intelligence Interrogation (Sept. 28, 1992) (the Field\nManual or Manual), in effect at the time of the alleged events\nin this case, states that interrogations must occur within the\n“constraints” of the Uniform Code of Military Justice as well as\nthe Geneva Conventions.      Id. preface at iv-v.    The Manual\nexpressly prohibits “[p]hysical or mental torture and coercion,”\ndefining “torture” as “the infliction of intense pain to body or\nmind to extract a confession or information, or for sadistic\npleasure.”    Id. at 1-8.     The Manual also lists examples of\nprohibited   practices,   including   some  of   the  techniques\nchallenged in this case, such as electric shocks, food\ndeprivation, “[a]ny form of beating,” “[f]orcing an individual\nto stand, sit, or kneel in abnormal positions for prolonged\nperiods of time,” mock executions, and “[a]bnormal sleep\ndeprivation.”   Id.  The Field Manual cautions that any “[s]uch\nillegal acts are not authorized and will not be condoned” by the\nmilitary.

This\n\napproach failed to address the full scope of review that the\n\ndistrict court needed to conduct on remand.                           We explained in Al\n\nShimari    III    that     the    record      was    inconclusive         “regarding        the\n\nextent to which military personnel actually exercised control\n\nover CACI employees in their performance of their interrogation\n\nfunctions.”        Al     Shimari      III,    758       F.3d    at    535.    We     further\n\nobserved that we were “unable to determine the extent to which\n\nthe military controlled the conduct of the CACI interrogators\n\noutside     the    context        of     required         interrogations,           which    is\n\nparticularly concerning given the plaintiffs’ allegations that\n\n‘[m]ost of the abuse’ occurred at night, and that the abuse was\n\nintended to ‘soften up’ the detainees for later interrogations.”\n\nId. at 536.\n\n      We thus asked the district court to consider whether the\n\nmilitary     actually       controlled             the    CACI        interrogators’        job\n\nperformance, including any activities that occurred outside the\n\nformal interrogation process.                  The first Taylor factor is not\n\nsatisfied    by    merely        examining     the        directives      issued      by    the\n\nmilitary for conducting interrogation sessions, or by reviewing\n\n                                              20\n\fany   particular       interrogation     plans    that      the    military       command\n\napproved in advance.              Instead, the concept of direct control\n\nencompasses not only the requirements that were set in place in\n\nadvance of the interrogations, but also what actually occurred\n\nin practice during those interrogations and related activities.\n\n      In examining the issue of direct control, when a contractor\n\nengages     in   a   lawful    action   under    the     actual     control       of    the\n\nmilitary, we will consider the contractor’s action to be a “de\n\nfacto military decision[]” shielded from judicial review under\n\nthe   political        question    doctrine.      Taylor,         658    F.3d    at    410.\n\nHowever, the military cannot lawfully exercise its authority by\n\ndirecting a contractor to engage in unlawful activity.                                Thus,\n\nwhen a contractor has engaged in unlawful conduct, irrespective\n\nof    the   nature      of    control   exercised      by     the       military,       the\n\ncontractor cannot claim protection under the political question\n\ndoctrine.        The    district    court     failed   to    draw       this    important\n\ndistinction.         Accordingly, we conclude that a contractor’s acts\n\nmay be shielded from judicial review under the first prong of\n\nTaylor only to the extent that those acts (1) were committed\n\nunder actual control of the military; and (2) were not unlawful.\n\n                                        ii.\n\n      We turn now to consider the district court’s treatment of\n\nthe second Taylor factor, which asks whether a decision on the\n\nmerits of the claim would require the court to “question actual,\n\n                                         21\n\fsensitive judgments made by the military.”                  Al Shimari III, 758\n\nF.3d at 533-34 (quoting Taylor, 658 F.3d at 411).                     The district\n\ncourt concluded that the plaintiffs’ claims were non-justiciable\n\nunder this second Taylor factor.                 The court explained that it\n\nwas unequipped to evaluate whether the use of certain “extreme\n\ninterrogation measures in the theatre of war” was appropriate or\n\njustified.        In the court’s view, adjudicating the plaintiffs’\n\nclaims    would    impinge    on   the    military’s       authority     to      select\n\ninterrogation       strategies     and    rules      of   engagement.         Debates\n\nexisting within the executive branch at that time regarding the\n\npropriety of certain aggressive interrogation tactics reinforced\n\nthe court’s conclusion.\n\n       We conclude that the above analysis that the district court\n\nconducted    was     incomplete.         In    addressing    the     second      Taylor\n\nfactor,     the    district      court    erred      in    failing     to     draw     a\n\ndistinction between unlawful conduct and discretionary acts that\n\nwere not unlawful when committed.\n\n       The commission of unlawful acts is not based on “military\n\nexpertise and judgment,” and is not a function committed to a\n\ncoordinate branch of government.                See Carmichael, 572 F.3d at\n\n1282     (emphasis    omitted).          To    the      contrary,    Congress        has\n\nestablished        criminal      penalties        for     commission        of     acts\n\nconstituting torture and war crimes.                    See 18 U.S.C. §§ 2340A,\n\n2441.     Therefore, to the extent that the plaintiffs’ claims rest\n\n                                          22\n\fon    allegations    of    unlawful       conduct    in     violation      of   settled\n\ninternational law or criminal law then applicable to the CACI\n\nemployees,    those       claims    fall    outside       the    protection      of   the\n\npolitical question doctrine.              On remand, the district court must\n\nfirst segregate such justiciable claims in its analysis before\n\nproceeding to determine whether any claims alleging conduct that\n\nwas not unlawful implicated sensitive military judgments under\n\nthe second prong of Taylor.\n\n                                          iii.\n\n       In reaching this conclusion, we emphasize the long-standing\n\nprinciple that courts are competent to engage in the traditional\n\njudicial     exercise      of    determining       whether       particular     conduct\n\ncomplied with applicable law.              See El-Shifa Pharm. Indus. Co. v.\n\nUnited States, 607 F.3d 836, 842 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (en banc)\n\n(majority opinion) (“[T]hat a case may involve the conduct of\n\nthe   nation’s     foreign      affairs    does     not    necessarily      prevent     a\n\ncourt from determining whether the Executive has exceeded the\n\nscope of prescribed statutory authority or failed to obey the\n\nprohibition of a statute or treaty.”); cf. Gilligan v. Morgan,\n\n413 U.S. 1, 11-12 (1973) (“[W]e neither hold nor imply that the\n\nconduct of the National Guard is always beyond judicial review\n\nor that there may not be accountability in a judicial forum for\n\nviolations    of    law    for     specific      unlawful       conduct    by   military\n\npersonnel.”)     (emphasis       added).         Accordingly,       when    a   military\n\n                                           23\n\fcontractor     acts       contrary    to     settled     international            law   or\n\napplicable    criminal       law,    the    separation      of      powers       rationale\n\nunderlying the political question doctrine does not shield the\n\ncontractor’s actions from judicial review.                     See Baker, 369 U.S.\n\nat 217.\n\n     For   the   same      reasons,     this      principle         generally     renders\n\njusticiable claims against a government contractor alleging a\n\nstatutory violation.            See El-Shifa, 607 F.3d at 851 (Ginsburg,\n\nJ., concurring in the judgment).                   The adjudication of such a\n\nclaim   requires      a    court     only    to    engage      in    the    traditional\n\njudicial     function      of    “say[ing]        what   the     law      is,”    and   of\n\ndetermining how that law applies to the facts of a particular\n\ncase, rather than passing judgment on a discretionary policy\n\nchoice.    Burn Pit, 744 F.3d at 334 (quoting Marbury v. Madison,\n\n5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 177 (1803)).\n\n     The Supreme Court likewise has explained that the political\n\nquestion doctrine does not strip courts of their authority to\n\nconstrue treaties and agreements entered into by the executive\n\nbranch, despite the potential political implications of judicial\n\nreview.    Japan Whaling, 478 U.S. at 230.                Courts thus retain the\n\nability to apply traditional rules of statutory interpretation\n\nto the facts presented in a particular case.                        Id.    Conducting a\n\n“textual, structural, and historical” examination of a statute\n\nor treaty “is what courts do” and typically is not barred by the\n\n                                            24\n\fpolitical question doctrine.                   Zivotofsky, 132 S. Ct. at 1427,\n\n1430;      see     also     El-Shifa,       607     F.3d    at    856       (Kavanaugh,      J.,\n\nconcurring         in     the   judgment)      (“The       Supreme      Court       has    never\n\napplied      the    political        question       doctrine      in    a    case    involving\n\nalleged statutory violations.”) (emphasis in original). 6\n\n                                              iv.\n\n      Applying the Taylor factors in accordance with the above-\n\nstated      principles,         we    hold     that    any       conduct      of     the     CACI\n\nemployees that occurred under the actual control of the military\n\nor involved sensitive military judgments, and was not unlawful\n\nwhen committed, constituted a protected exercise of discretion\n\nunder the political question doctrine.                       Conversely, any acts of\n\nthe       CACI     employees         that     were     unlawful         when        committed,\n\nirrespective whether they occurred under actual control of the\n\nmilitary, are subject to judicial review.                         Thus, the plaintiffs’\n\nclaims are justiciable to the extent that the challenged conduct\n\nviolated settled international law or the criminal law to which\n\nthe     CACI     employees       were       subject    at    the       time    the        conduct\n\n\n\n\n      6Given the nature of the claims alleged in this case, we\nare not presented at this stage of the litigation with “policy\nchoices and value determinations” embedded within a claim\nalleging a violation of customary international law.    See El-\nShifa, 607 F.3d at 843-44 (majority opinion) (citation omitted)\n(holding non-justiciable a claim under the law of nations\nrequiring the court to determine whether a U.S. military attack\nwas “mistaken and not justified”).\n\n\n                                               25\n\foccurred. 7     Cf.     Japan    Whaling,      478    U.S.    at    230;    Hamdi    v.\n\nRumsfeld, 542 U.S. 507, 536 (2004) (explaining that “a state of\n\nwar is not a blank check for the President” with respect to\n\nindividual rights) (opinion of O’Connor, J.).\n\n       We   remain    mindful,   however,      that    this    dichotomy         between\n\nlawful discretionary acts and unlawful activity will not always\n\nbe clear when applied to particular conduct.                       Although alleged\n\nconduct that on its face is aggravated and criminal in nature,\n\nsuch   as   sexual    assault    and    beatings,     clearly      will    present    a\n\nsubject for judicial review unaffected by the political question\n\ndoctrine,     other    conduct    may    not    be    capable       of    such    clear\n\ncategorization.        In instances in which the lawfulness of such\n\nconduct was not settled at the time the conduct occurred, and\n\nthe conduct occurred under the actual control of the military or\n\ninvolved sensitive military judgments, that conduct will not be\n\nsubject to judicial review.              Cf. Viet. Ass’n for Victims of\n\nAgent Orange v. Dow Chem. Co., 517 F.3d 104, 123 (2d Cir. 2008)\n\n(dismissing claims under the ATS because the plaintiffs did not\n\n“ground[] their claims arising under international law in a norm\n\n       7\n       We decline CACI’s invitation to rely on out-of-circuit\nprecedent cited in its letter submitted to the Court after oral\nargument.   These citations are not the proper subject of a\nsubmission pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure\n28(j). And, in any event, these authorities only reinforce our\nview that, when a plaintiff’s claim challenges a core foreign\npolicy decision made by the political branches of government,\nthe political question doctrine bars review.\n\n\n                                         26\n\fthat was universally accepted at the time of the events giving\n\nrise to the injuries alleged”).                    The absence of clear norms of\n\ninternational        law    or   applicable         criminal        law   regarding      the\n\nlawfulness of a particular mode of treatment will render that\n\n“grey area” conduct non-justiciable under the political question\n\ndoctrine, as long as the conduct was committed under the actual\n\ncontrol    of      the     military      or    implicated           sensitive     military\n\njudgments.\n\n       Here, the plaintiffs alleged pursuant to the ATS that CACI\n\ninterrogators engaged in a wide spectrum of conduct amounting to\n\ntorture,     war     crimes,      and/or       cruel,        inhuman,      or    degrading\n\ntreatment, as well as various torts under the common law.                              Among\n\nother things, the plaintiffs alleged that they were subjected to\n\nbeatings, stress positions, forced nudity, sexual assault, and\n\ndeath threats, in addition to the withholding of food, water,\n\nand medical care, sensory deprivation, and exposure to extreme\n\ntemperatures.        Counsel for CACI conceded at oral argument that\n\nat least some of the most egregious conduct alleged, including\n\nsexual assault and beatings, was clearly unlawful, even though\n\nCACI    maintains        that    the    plaintiffs       cannot        show     that    CACI\n\ninterrogators perpetrated any of these abuses.\n\n       We decline to render in the first instance a comprehensive\n\ndetermination        of     which       acts       alleged     were       unlawful      when\n\ncommitted,      or   whether      the    plaintiffs          have    stated     claims    to\n\n                                              27\n\frelief that could survive a motion filed under Federal Rule of\n\nCivil Procedure 12(b)(6).     Nevertheless, as noted above, some of\n\nthe alleged acts plainly were unlawful at the time they were\n\ncommitted and will not require extensive consideration by the\n\ndistrict court.      Accordingly, on remand, the district court will\n\nbe   required   to    determine   which    of   the   alleged   acts,   or\n\nconstellations of alleged acts, violated settled international\n\nlaw and criminal law governing CACI’s conduct and, therefore,\n\nare subject to judicial review. 8       The district court also will be\n\nrequired to identify any “grey area” conduct that was committed\n\nunder the actual control of the military or involved sensitive\n\nmilitary judgments and, thus, is protected under the political\n\nquestion doctrine.\n\n\n     8 As with the ATS claims, to the extent that conduct\nunderlying the common law claims was unlawful, those claims also\nwill be justiciable.        We observe, however, that certain\nallegations underlying the common law claims may involve conduct\nthat, although tortious under the common law, did not constitute\na violation of applicable criminal or international law.       A\nnonconsensual touching that might constitute battery, or conduct\nthat might amount to intentional infliction of emotional\ndistress, under the common law nevertheless may have been an\ninterrogation tactic that the military lawfully could have\nauthorized.      Accordingly,   we  express  no   view   on  the\njusticiability of common law claims alleging conduct that was\nnot unlawful at the time.     We leave this determination to the\ndistrict court in the first instance.\n     In the event that the district court determines that any of\nthe common law claims are justiciable, the court nevertheless\nmay elect to reinstate its prior order dismissing those claims\nunder Rule 12(b)(6), which order this Court has not yet\nreviewed.\n\n\n                                   28\n\f       This “discriminating analysis,” see Baker, 369 U.S. at 211,\n\nwill     require   the      district        court       to    examine       the     evidence\n\nregarding    the   specific          conduct      to    which   the   plaintiffs           were\n\nsubjected and the source of any direction under which the acts\n\ntook place.        If disputed facts are “inextricably intertwined”\n\nwith the facts underlying the merits of the plaintiffs’ claims,\n\nthe district court should resolve these disputed jurisdictional\n\nfacts along with the intertwined merits issues.                         See Kerns, 585\n\nF.3d at 193.\n\n                                             C.\n\n       Distinct    from        its    holding      of     non-justiciability              under\n\nTaylor, the district court separately concluded under the second\n\nBaker    factor    that    the       case    lacked      manageable       standards        for\n\njudicial     resolution        of    the    plaintiffs’         claims.           The    court\n\nemphasized     that      its    general      lack       of   expertise       in     applying\n\ninternational      law,        and    the     difficulty        of    determining          the\n\nconstraints of such law, also rendered the case non-justiciable.\n\nWe disagree with the district court’s conclusion.\n\n       Unlike in negligence cases calling into question military\n\nstandards of conduct, the district court in the present case is\n\ncalled     upon    to     interpret         statutory        terms    and     established\n\ninternational norms to resolve the issues presented by the ATS\n\nclaims.

Likewise,\n\nin his common law claims, Al Shimari has alleged familiar torts\n\nbased on long-standing common law principles.\n\n      Although        the    substantive           law       applicable         to    the     present\n\nclaims may be unfamiliar and complicated in many respects, we\n\ncannot     conclude     that       we    lack      manageable            standards         for     their\n\nadjudication       justifying           invocation           of    the    political          question\n\ndoctrine.        In    reaching         this      conclusion,            we     agree       with     the\n\nobservation       that       courts       may          not        “decline       to        resolve     a\n\ncontroversy       within       their      traditional               competence         and       proper\n\njurisdiction       simply         because      the       question         is     difficult,          the\n\nconsequences weighty, or the potential real for conflict with\n\nthe policy preferences of the political branches.”                                     Zivotofsky,\n\n132   S.

Nor will we risk weakening\n\nprohibitions under United States and international law against\n\ntorture and war crimes by questioning the justiciability of a\n\ncase merely because the case involves the need to define such\n\nterms.   The political question doctrine does not shield from\n\njudicial review intentional acts by a government contractor that\n\nwere unlawful at the time they were committed.\n\n     Accordingly, we vacate the district court’s judgment, and\n\nremand this case for further proceedings consistent with the\n\nprinciples and instructions stated in this opinion.\n\n\n\n                                             VACATED AND REMANDED\n\n\n\n\n                               32\n\fFLOYD, Circuit Judge, concurring:\n\n      I am pleased to join in Judge Keenan’s fine opinion in this\n\ncase.     I write separately to articulate my understanding of one\n\naspect of our holding.                I agree that the “dichotomy between\n\nlawful discretionary acts and unlawful activity will not always\n\nbe clear when applied to particular conduct.”                       Ante at 26.        In\n\ndiscussing this concept with the term “grey area,” ante at 26-\n\n28,   I   do    not    understand     the     opinion    to    suggest    that   courts\n\ncannot     adjudicate         close     questions       of     lawfulness      regarding\n\nmilitary affairs.         Courts can adjudicate such questions without\n\noffending the political question doctrine.\n\n      “The nonjusticiability of a political question is primarily\n\na function of the separation of powers” under our constitutional\n\nscheme.        Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 210 (1962).                     That scheme\n\ndoes not assign military decision making to the judiciary and,\n\nas a consequence, questions of military policy are not for us to\n\nresolve.         But   this    does     not    mean    that    every    case   touching\n\nmilitary affairs is nonjusticiable.                   In separating the powers of\n\ngovernment, the Constitution assigns to the judiciary the power\n\nto resolve “what the law is.”                  Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137,\n\n177   (1803).          Thus    although       the     reasonableness      of   military\n\nconduct may not be justiciable, the lawfulness of that conduct\n\nassuredly       is.     Cf.,    e.g.,    Boumediene       v.    Bush,    553   U.S.   723\n\n(2008); Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 548 U.S. 557 (2006).\n\n                                              33\n\f      The precise contours of “what the law is” may be uncertain\n\nuntil a court evaluates the lawfulness of specific conduct.                          For\n\nexample, despite repeated judicial application of torture laws,\n\nsee ante at 30, the precise legal scope of the prohibition on\n\ntorture is not perfectly defined.                     There is, in other words,\n\nconduct     for     which   the    judiciary      has    yet    to   determine       the\n\nlawfulness:       loosely, a grey area.\n\n      But    this    greyness      does   not    render      close   torture     cases\n\nnonjusticiable merely because the alleged torturer was part of\n\nthe executive branch.            While executive officers can declare the\n\nmilitary reasonableness of conduct amounting to torture, it is\n\nbeyond the power of even the President to declare such conduct\n\nlawful.       The    same   is    true    for    any    other    applicable      legal\n\nprohibition.          The    fact    that       the     President--let       alone    a\n\nsignificantly       inferior      executive     officer--opines       that    certain\n\nconduct is lawful does not determine the actual lawfulness of\n\nthat conduct.        The determination of specific violations of law\n\nis constitutionally committed to the courts, even if that law\n\ntouches military affairs.             Cf., e.g., Gilligan v. Morgan, 413\n\nU.S. 1, 11-12 (1973).\n\n      Of course the fact that a claim is justiciable under the\n\npolitical question doctrine says very little about that claim’s\n\nprocedural or substantive merits.                Among other things, a claim\n\nmay   be    inadequately     alleged,      barred       by   other   jurisdictional\n\n                                          34\n\fdoctrines, or ultimately not proven.                      “In instances in which\n\nthe lawfulness of . . . conduct was not settled at the time the\n\nconduct occurred,” ante at 26, a defendant may be able to avoid\n\nliability through the doctrine of qualified immunity, the ATS\n\nrequirement     that    conduct      violate   customary        international      law,\n\nthe requirement of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12 that a\n\nclaim    be   stated    for   which     relief      may   be    granted,     or   other\n\napplicable law.         See, e.g., Viet. Ass’n for Victims of Agent\n\nOrange   v.    Dow    Chem.   Co.,     517   F.3d    104,      123   (2d   Cir.    2008)\n\n(adjudicating and dismissing claims brought pursuant to the ATS\n\nbecause the plaintiffs did not allege conduct proscribed by a\n\nsufficiently         universal    customary         international          law    norm).\n\nHowever,      the    judiciary    is   well    equipped        to    adjudicate     such\n\nissues without impermissibly answering political questions.\n\n\n\n\n                                         35\n\f",

They were detained beginning in the fall of\n\n2003, and ultimately were released without being charged with a\n\ncrime.    In    2008,    they   filed   this    civil    action     against      CACI\n\nPremier   Technology,       Inc.      (CACI),    which       provided      contract\n\ninterrogation    services       for   the   military    at    the   time    of    the\n\nalleged mistreatment.\n\n     In their third amended complaint, the plaintiffs alleged\n\npursuant to the Alien Tort Statute (ATS), 28 U.S.C. § 1350, that\n\nCACI employees committed acts involving torture and war crimes,\n\nand cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment.               The plaintiffs also\n\nasserted various tort claims under the common law, including\n\nassault and battery, sexual assault and battery, and intentional\n\ninfliction of emotional distress.\n\n     This case is before this Court for the fourth time.                    In our\n\nmost recent decision, we remanded the case to the district court\n\nto conduct jurisdictional discovery on the issue whether the\n\npolitical question doctrine barred the plaintiffs’ claims.                        On\n\nremand, after reopening discovery, the district court dismissed\n\nthe plaintiffs’ complaint on the ground that it presented a non-\n\n                                        4\n\fjusticiable political question.                        The court based its decision on\n\nthree grounds: (1) that the military exercised direct control\n\nover     interrogation              operations          at     Abu     Ghraib;         (2)        that\n\nadjudication of the plaintiffs’ claims would require the court\n\nimproperly        to   question       sensitive          military      judgments;        and       (3)\n\nthat the court lacked any judicially manageable standards to\n\nresolve the plaintiffs’ claims.\n\n       The   plaintiffs        once        again       appeal.       Upon    our       review,     we\n\nconclude      that      the    district          court       erred   in     its    analysis        by\n\nfailing      to     determine        whether       the       military     exercised          actual\n\ncontrol      over      any    of    CACI’s       alleged       conduct.           We   hold       that\n\nconduct by CACI employees that was unlawful when committed is\n\njusticiable,        irrespective           whether       that      conduct    occurred        under\n\nthe actual control of the military.                           We further hold that acts\n\ncommitted by CACI employees are shielded from judicial review\n\nunder the political question doctrine if they were not unlawful\n\nwhen   committed        and    occurred          under       the   actual    control         of    the\n\nmilitary or involved sensitive military judgments.\n\n       We    therefore        vacate       the    district         court’s    judgment.            We\n\nremand the case for the district court to re-examine its subject\n\nmatter      jurisdiction           under    the    political         question      doctrine         in\n\naccordance with the above holdings.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   5\n\f                                            I.\n\n       We recounted the circumstances underlying the plaintiffs’\n\ncomplaint and the complicated procedural history of this case at\n\nlength    in   our   previous        opinion,     Al     Shimari      v.

We\n\nwill review here only the facts relevant to the present appeal.\n\n       Following the invasion of Iraq in 2003, the United States\n\ntook    control    of     Abu   Ghraib      prison     (Abu     Ghraib),      a    facility\n\nlocated near Baghdad, Iraq that previously was under the control\n\nof Saddam Hussein.            Upon assuming control of the facility, the\n\nUnited    States     military     used      the   prison       to    detain    criminals,\n\nenemies of the provisional government, and other persons held\n\nfor interrogation related to intelligence gathering.                               Due to a\n\nshortage of military interrogators, the United States government\n\nentered     into     a    contract      with      CACI    to        provide    additional\n\ninterrogation services at Abu Ghraib.\n\n       As documented in a later investigation conducted by the\n\nUnited    States     Department        of   Defense,      “numerous         incidents    of\n\nsadistic, blatant, and wanton criminal abuses were inflicted on\n\nseveral detainees” at Abu Ghraib between October and December\n\n2003.

The\n\nplaintiffs         further     alleged       that         they     were    victims    of    a    wide\n\nrange        of     mistreatment,           including              being     beaten,        choked,\n\n“subjected to electric shocks,” “repeatedly shot in the head\n\nwith     a    taser        gun,”     “forcibly             subjected       to    sexual      acts,”\n\nsubjected to sensory deprivation, placed in stress positions for\n\nextended periods of time, deprived of food, water, and sleep,\n\nthreatened with unleashed dogs and death, and forced to wear\n\nwomen’s underwear.\n\n       Additionally,               the      plaintiffs               alleged         that        CACI\n\ninterrogators              “instigated,               directed,            participated           in,\n\n                                                     7\n\fencouraged, and aided and abetted conduct towards detainees that\n\nclearly violated the Geneva Conventions, the Army Field Manual,\n\nand    the    laws      of     the     United       States.”           According       to    the\n\nplaintiffs,       most    of    these    acts       of     abuse    occurred       during    the\n\nnighttime shift at the prison, in order to reduce the likelihood\n\nthat    nonparticipants           would        learn       of      this     conduct.         The\n\nplaintiffs        contend      that     these       acts      of    abuse     were    possible\n\nbecause      of   a    “command       vacuum”       at   Abu    Ghraib,      caused     by   the\n\nfailure of military leaders to exercise effective oversight over\n\nCACI interrogators and military police.\n\n       CACI moved to dismiss the plaintiffs’ complaint on several\n\ngrounds,      including        the     political         question         doctrine,    federal\n\npreemption, derivative sovereign immunity, and lack of subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction under the ATS.                         The district court denied\n\nthe defendants’ motion, holding in part that the plaintiffs’\n\nclaims did not present a political question.                              Nevertheless, the\n\ncourt concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over the plaintiffs’\n\nATS    claims,     because      CACI     was    a    private        party    rather     than   a\n\ngovernmental          actor,   and     opined       that      those    claims      could     only\n\nproceed under diversity or federal question jurisdiction.\n\n       On    appeal,      a    panel     of     this      Court       concluded      that    the\n\nplaintiffs’       claims       were    preempted         by     federal      law     under   the\n\nSupreme Court’s decision in Boyle v.

In response, the plaintiffs filed\n\na third amended complaint to supplement their allegations of\n\nconspiracy, limit their common law claims to Al Shimari, and\n\nname CACI as the only defendant.             The third amended complaint\n\n(the complaint) is the complaint at issue in this appeal.\n\n      In April 2013, shortly after the third amended complaint\n\nwas   filed,   the   deadline   for    discovery     on   the   merits    of   the\n\nplaintiffs’ claims expired.           The same week, the Supreme Court\n\nissued its decision in Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., 133\n\nS.    Ct.   1659    (2013),   which    imposed     certain      limitations    on\n\nextraterritorial application of the ATS.             Relying on Kiobel, the\n\n\n      1The court also dismissed with prejudice the plaintiffs’\nclaims against the parent company of CACI, CACI International,\nand the conspiracy claims against individual CACI employees.\n\n\n                                       9\n\fdistrict court dismissed the plaintiffs’ ATS claims, because the\n\nunderlying conduct occurred exclusively in Iraq.                                The district\n\ncourt also dismissed Al Shimari’s common law tort claims under\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), holding that Iraqi law\n\ndid not permit imposition of liability on CACI.\n\n      On    appeal       from     that     decision,           in    Al     Shimari     III     we\n\nconcluded      that     the     district     court          had   jurisdiction        over     the\n\nplaintiffs’ ATS claims under the Supreme Court’s reasoning in\n\nKiobel.      </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">758</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">516</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (4th Cir. 2014).                               Although CACI also\n\nargued     that    the    case        should      be        dismissed      pursuant     to     the\n\npolitical question doctrine, we declined to decide the political\n\nquestion issue based on the limited appellate record available\n\nat the time.            Instead, we vacated the district court’s order\n\ndismissing      the     ATS     and    common         law    claims,      and   remanded       the\n\nentire case for the district court to develop the factual record\n\nregarding      the      extent        of   the        military’s         control   over       CACI\n\ninterrogators and whether CACI’s intended defenses raised any\n\npolitical issues.         Id. at 536-37.\n\n      On remand from Al Shimari III, the district court reopened\n\nthe   record      for   jurisdictional            discovery         on    the   issue   of     the\n\npolitical question doctrine, although it appears that minimal,\n\n\n\n\n                                                 10\n\fif    any,   additional       discovery     was    taken. 2      As   noted      above,\n\nfollowing      the    reopened     discovery      period,     the   district         court\n\ndismissed all the plaintiffs’ claims under Federal Rule of Civil\n\nProcedure     12(b)(1)       on   the   ground    that    they   presented      a     non-\n\njusticiable political question.                 The plaintiffs now appeal the\n\ndistrict court’s dismissal of their complaint on this ground.\n\n\n\n                                         II.\n\n       The plaintiffs contend that the district court erred in\n\ndismissing      their        complaint     as     non-justiciable         under       the\n\npolitical      question      doctrine.          They     first   assert       that    the\n\ndistrict court erred in finding that the military had direct\n\ncontrol over formal interrogations at Abu Ghraib prison, and in\n\nfailing to evaluate whether the military actually exercised such\n\ncontrol      during    related     activities      that    occurred     outside       the\n\nformal interrogation process.              In the plaintiffs’ view, we are\n\nnot   presented       with   a    political      question,    because     a    “command\n\nvacuum” existed at Abu Ghraib in which the military did not\n\nexercise actual control over the conduct of the military police\n\nand the CACI interrogators.\n\n\n\n\n       2\n       Notably, after eight years of litigation, to date only one\nof the plaintiffs has been deposed in this case, because the\nUnited States government has not allowed the plaintiffs to enter\nthe United States.\n\n\n                                          11\n\f       The    plaintiffs     also        argue    that     their    claims     would    not\n\nrequire      the    courts   to        evaluate    sensitive       military     judgments\n\nbecause      the    claims   challenge        the    legality,        rather    than    the\n\nreasonableness, of CACI’s conduct.                    Separately, the plaintiffs\n\nassert    that      the   district       court     erred    in     concluding    that    it\n\nlacked manageable standards for resolving their claims.\n\n       In response, CACI contends that the district court properly\n\nconcluded      that       this    case      presents       a     political      question.\n\nAccording      to    CACI,       the     district     court’s       finding     that    the\n\nmilitary exercised control over interrogation operations at Abu\n\nGhraib ends the issue of justiciability in this case.                           CACI also\n\nmaintains that the district court correctly held that the case\n\nis non-justiciable because judicial review of the interrogation\n\ntactics      used    would       require     a     court    to     question     sensitive\n\nmilitary judgments.              Finally, CACI asserts that the district\n\ncourt correctly concluded that it lacked manageable standards\n\nfor resolving the plaintiffs’ claims.                      We disagree with CACI’s\n\narguments.\n\n\n\n                                            III.\n\n       In reviewing a district court’s dismissal of a claim for\n\nlack   of    jurisdiction         under     Federal      Rule    of   Civil     Procedure\n\n12(b)(1), we review the court’s factual findings for clear error\n\nand its legal conclusions de novo.

Id.\n\n     The plaintiff in Taylor, a Marine who suffered injuries\n\nresulting from an electrical shock sustained on a military base\n\nin   Iraq,    asserted    a    negligence      claim      against        a    government\n\n                                        15\n\fcontractor based on the contractor’s activation of a generator\n\nwhile the plaintiff was performing work on a wiring box.                              658\n\nF.3d   at    403-04.       We    concluded        that    because      the   contractor\n\nintended     to       assert    as    a   defense        that    the    military      was\n\ncontributorily negligent, the district court would be forced to\n\n“question     actual,     sensitive       judgments       made   by    the   military.”\n\nId. at 411-12 (internal quotation marks omitted).                        We therefore\n\nheld that the political question doctrine deprived the court of\n\njurisdiction to consider the plaintiff’s negligence claim.                            Id.\n\nat 412.\n\n       Our   holding      in    Taylor    reflected       our    concern     that    when\n\nnational defense interests are at stake, courts must carefully\n\nassess the extent to which these interests may be implicated in\n\nany litigation of a plaintiff’s claims involving the conduct of\n\na military contractor.               Taylor, 658 F.3d at 409-10.                We give\n\nthis    question       particular      attention     because      courts       are   ill-\n\nequipped     to   evaluate      discretionary       operational        decisions     made\n\nby, or at the direction of, the military on the battlefield.\n\nSee generally Carmichael v.

However, because\n\nTaylor    was     a   negligence      case    and   the    present      case   involves\n\n                                             16\n\fallegations       of    intentional         acts,    we    frame     our    analysis       in\n\naccordance with that distinction.\n\n                                            i.\n\n       As stated above, the first Taylor factor asks whether the\n\nacts   occurred        while    the    government        contractor       was    under    the\n\ndirect control of the military.                    Taylor, 658 F.3d at 411.                In\n\nAl Shimari III, we also described this factor in terms of “the\n\nextent to which military personnel actually exercised control”\n\nover the contractor’s acts.                 Al Shimari III, 758 F.3d at 535.\n\nIn the present case, after considering this first Taylor factor,\n\nthe    district    court       credited      the     evidence      that    the    military\n\nmaintained formal control over the interrogations, and concluded\n\nthat the case presented a political question depriving the court\n\nof subject matter jurisdiction.\n\n       In   the        district       court,       the    evidence        regarding       the\n\nmilitary’s       control       over   the    CACI     interrogators        proceeded       on\n\nparallel    tracks,       with    evidence         demonstrating      formal      military\n\ncontrol presented alongside evidence showing that the military\n\nfailed to exercise actual control over the interrogators.                                With\n\nregard to formal control, the record shows that the military was\n\nin charge of the official command structure at Abu Ghraib and\n\ninstituted procedures governing the interrogation process.                               For\n\nexample,    in    September       and     October        2003,   military       leadership\n\nlocated     in    Baghdad        issued      two     memoranda      establishing         the\n\n                                             17\n\fparticularized      rules    of    engagement       for   interrogations          (IROEs)\n\nconducted at Abu Ghraib, which authorized the use of several,\n\nspecific     interrogation             techniques. 3          In     addition,          all\n\ninterrogators were required to submit interrogation plans to the\n\nmilitary chain of command for advance approval.                            These plans\n\nspecified     the     interrogation          methods       that      the     particular\n\ninterrogators       intended      to     employ   and     included     requests         for\n\nseparate approval of more aggressive tactics, if necessary.\n\n     Other evidence in the record, however, indicated that the\n\nmilitary     failed    to    exercise       actual       control     over    the       work\n\nconducted by the CACI interrogators.                   In one government report,\n\nan investigator unequivocally concluded that military leaders at\n\nAbu Ghraib “failed to supervise subordinates or provide direct\n\noversight”    of     the    mission,       and    that    the      “lack    of    command\n\npresence, particularly at night, was clear.” 4                      Lt. Gen. Anthony\n\nR. Jones, AR 15-6 Investigation of the Abu Ghraib Prison and\n\n205th    Military     Intelligence        Brigade      1137     (2004).          The   same\n\nreport emphasized that interrogation operations were “plagued by\n\n\n     3  We observe that the September 2003 IROE memorandum\nauthorized aggressive interrogation tactics to be used under\ncertain conditions, including the use of stress positions and\n“sleep management.”  The later, superseding memorandum removed\nthese tactics.\n\n     4 Generally, investigative government reports of this nature\nare admissible as an exception to the rule against hearsay under\nFederal Rule of Evidence 803(8)(A)(iii).\n\n\n                                           18\n\fa lack of an organizational chain of command presence and by a\n\nlack of proper actions to establish standards and training” by\n\nsenior leadership.     Id.     Additional evidence in the record also\n\nindicates   that    CACI    interrogators    ordered     low-level     military\n\npersonnel to mistreat detainees.            This evidence supported the\n\nplaintiffs’ contention that the formal command authority held by\n\nthe military did not translate into actual control of day-to-day\n\ninterrogation operations.\n\n     The    above   evidence     of   a    “command    vacuum”      raises   the\n\nquestion whether the military exercised actual control over any\n\ninterrogation-related        activities    during     which   the    challenged\n\nconduct occurred.          Also, through operation of the Army Field\n\nManual 5 and IROEs, the military may have expressly prohibited the\n\n\n     5 The United States Department of the Army Field Manual 34-\n52, Intelligence Interrogation (Sept. 28, 1992) (the Field\nManual or Manual), in effect at the time of the alleged events\nin this case, states that interrogations must occur within the\n“constraints” of the Uniform Code of Military Justice as well as\nthe Geneva Conventions.      Id. preface at iv-v.    The Manual\nexpressly prohibits “[p]hysical or mental torture and coercion,”\ndefining “torture” as “the infliction of intense pain to body or\nmind to extract a confession or information, or for sadistic\npleasure.”    Id. at 1-8.     The Manual also lists examples of\nprohibited   practices,   including   some  of   the  techniques\nchallenged in this case, such as electric shocks, food\ndeprivation, “[a]ny form of beating,” “[f]orcing an individual\nto stand, sit, or kneel in abnormal positions for prolonged\nperiods of time,” mock executions, and “[a]bnormal sleep\ndeprivation.”   Id.  The Field Manual cautions that any “[s]uch\nillegal acts are not authorized and will not be condoned” by the\nmilitary. Id.\n\n\n\n                                      19\n\fuse   of   certain      interrogation         methods,          but   failed   to     enforce\n\nthese prohibitions in practice.\n\n       Rather than addressing the issue of actual control, the\n\ndistrict     court       began     and     ended         its     analysis      by     drawing\n\nconclusions       based    on    the     evidence        of     formal   control.           This\n\napproach failed to address the full scope of review that the\n\ndistrict court needed to conduct on remand.                           We explained in Al\n\nShimari    III    that     the    record      was    inconclusive         “regarding        the\n\nextent to which military personnel actually exercised control\n\nover CACI employees in their performance of their interrogation\n\nfunctions.”        Al     Shimari      III,    758       F.3d    at    535.    We     further\n\nobserved that we were “unable to determine the extent to which\n\nthe military controlled the conduct of the CACI interrogators\n\noutside     the    context        of     required         interrogations,           which    is\n\nparticularly concerning given the plaintiffs’ allegations that\n\n‘[m]ost of the abuse’ occurred at night, and that the abuse was\n\nintended to ‘soften up’ the detainees for later interrogations.”\n\nId. at 536.\n\n      We thus asked the district court to consider whether the\n\nmilitary     actually       controlled             the    CACI        interrogators’        job\n\nperformance, including any activities that occurred outside the\n\nformal interrogation process.                  The first Taylor factor is not\n\nsatisfied    by    merely        examining     the        directives      issued      by    the\n\nmilitary for conducting interrogation sessions, or by reviewing\n\n                                              20\n\fany   particular       interrogation     plans    that      the    military       command\n\napproved in advance.              Instead, the concept of direct control\n\nencompasses not only the requirements that were set in place in\n\nadvance of the interrogations, but also what actually occurred\n\nin practice during those interrogations and related activities.\n\n      In examining the issue of direct control, when a contractor\n\nengages     in   a   lawful    action   under    the     actual     control       of    the\n\nmilitary, we will consider the contractor’s action to be a “de\n\nfacto military decision[]” shielded from judicial review under\n\nthe   political        question    doctrine.      Taylor,         658    F.3d    at    410.\n\nHowever, the military cannot lawfully exercise its authority by\n\ndirecting a contractor to engage in unlawful activity.                                Thus,\n\nwhen a contractor has engaged in unlawful conduct, irrespective\n\nof    the   nature      of    control   exercised      by     the       military,       the\n\ncontractor cannot claim protection under the political question\n\ndoctrine.        The    district    court     failed   to    draw       this    important\n\ndistinction.         Accordingly, we conclude that a contractor’s acts\n\nmay be shielded from judicial review under the first prong of\n\nTaylor only to the extent that those acts (1) were committed\n\nunder actual control of the military; and (2) were not unlawful.\n\n                                        ii.\n\n      We turn now to consider the district court’s treatment of\n\nthe second Taylor factor, which asks whether a decision on the\n\nmerits of the claim would require the court to “question actual,\n\n                                         21\n\fsensitive judgments made by the military.”                  Al Shimari III, 758\n\nF.3d at 533-34 (quoting Taylor, 658 F.3d at 411).                     The district\n\ncourt concluded that the plaintiffs’ claims were non-justiciable\n\nunder this second Taylor factor.                 The court explained that it\n\nwas unequipped to evaluate whether the use of certain “extreme\n\ninterrogation measures in the theatre of war” was appropriate or\n\njustified.        In the court’s view, adjudicating the plaintiffs’\n\nclaims    would    impinge    on   the    military’s       authority     to      select\n\ninterrogation       strategies     and    rules      of   engagement.         Debates\n\nexisting within the executive branch at that time regarding the\n\npropriety of certain aggressive interrogation tactics reinforced\n\nthe court’s conclusion.\n\n       We conclude that the above analysis that the district court\n\nconducted    was     incomplete.         In    addressing    the     second      Taylor\n\nfactor,     the    district      court    erred      in    failing     to     draw     a\n\ndistinction between unlawful conduct and discretionary acts that\n\nwere not unlawful when committed.\n\n       The commission of unlawful acts is not based on “military\n\nexpertise and judgment,” and is not a function committed to a\n\ncoordinate branch of government.                See Carmichael, 572 F.3d at\n\n1282     (emphasis    omitted).          To    the      contrary,    Congress        has\n\nestablished        criminal      penalties        for     commission        of     acts\n\nconstituting torture and war crimes.                    See 18 U.S.C. §§ 2340A,\n\n2441.     Therefore, to the extent that the plaintiffs’ claims rest\n\n                                          22\n\fon    allegations    of    unlawful       conduct    in     violation      of   settled\n\ninternational law or criminal law then applicable to the CACI\n\nemployees,    those       claims    fall    outside       the    protection      of   the\n\npolitical question doctrine.              On remand, the district court must\n\nfirst segregate such justiciable claims in its analysis before\n\nproceeding to determine whether any claims alleging conduct that\n\nwas not unlawful implicated sensitive military judgments under\n\nthe second prong of Taylor.\n\n                                          iii.\n\n       In reaching this conclusion, we emphasize the long-standing\n\nprinciple that courts are competent to engage in the traditional\n\njudicial     exercise      of    determining       whether       particular     conduct\n\ncomplied with applicable law.

See Baker, 369 U.S.\n\nat 217.\n\n     For   the   same      reasons,     this      principle         generally     renders\n\njusticiable claims against a government contractor alleging a\n\nstatutory violation.            See El-Shifa, 607 F.3d at 851 (Ginsburg,\n\nJ., concurring in the judgment).                   The adjudication of such a\n\nclaim   requires      a    court     only    to    engage      in    the    traditional\n\njudicial     function      of    “say[ing]        what   the     law      is,”    and   of\n\ndetermining how that law applies to the facts of a particular\n\ncase, rather than passing judgment on a discretionary policy\n\nchoice.    Burn Pit, 744 F.3d at 334 (quoting Marbury v.

Japan Whaling, 478 U.S. at 230.

Among\n\nother things, the plaintiffs alleged that they were subjected to\n\nbeatings, stress positions, forced nudity, sexual assault, and\n\ndeath threats, in addition to the withholding of food, water,\n\nand medical care, sensory deprivation, and exposure to extreme\n\ntemperatures.        Counsel for CACI conceded at oral argument that\n\nat least some of the most egregious conduct alleged, including\n\nsexual assault and beatings, was clearly unlawful, even though\n\nCACI    maintains        that    the    plaintiffs       cannot        show     that    CACI\n\ninterrogators perpetrated any of these abuses.\n\n       We decline to render in the first instance a comprehensive\n\ndetermination        of     which       acts       alleged     were       unlawful      when\n\ncommitted,      or   whether      the    plaintiffs          have    stated     claims    to\n\n                                              27\n\frelief that could survive a motion filed under Federal Rule of\n\nCivil Procedure 12(b)(6).     Nevertheless, as noted above, some of\n\nthe alleged acts plainly were unlawful at the time they were\n\ncommitted and will not require extensive consideration by the\n\ndistrict court.      Accordingly, on remand, the district court will\n\nbe   required   to    determine   which    of   the   alleged   acts,   or\n\nconstellations of alleged acts, violated settled international\n\nlaw and criminal law governing CACI’s conduct and, therefore,\n\nare subject to judicial review. 8       The district court also will be\n\nrequired to identify any “grey area” conduct that was committed\n\nunder the actual control of the military or involved sensitive\n\nmilitary judgments and, thus, is protected under the political\n\nquestion doctrine.\n\n\n     8 As with the ATS claims, to the extent that conduct\nunderlying the common law claims was unlawful, those claims also\nwill be justiciable.        We observe, however, that certain\nallegations underlying the common law claims may involve conduct\nthat, although tortious under the common law, did not constitute\na violation of applicable criminal or international law.       A\nnonconsensual touching that might constitute battery, or conduct\nthat might amount to intentional infliction of emotional\ndistress, under the common law nevertheless may have been an\ninterrogation tactic that the military lawfully could have\nauthorized.      Accordingly,   we  express  no   view   on  the\njusticiability of common law claims alleging conduct that was\nnot unlawful at the time.     We leave this determination to the\ndistrict court in the first instance.\n     In the event that the district court determines that any of\nthe common law claims are justiciable, the court nevertheless\nmay elect to reinstate its prior order dismissing those claims\nunder Rule 12(b)(6), which order this Court has not yet\nreviewed.\n\n\n                                   28\n\f       This “discriminating analysis,” see Baker, 369 U.S. at 211,\n\nwill     require   the      district        court       to    examine       the     evidence\n\nregarding    the   specific          conduct      to    which   the   plaintiffs           were\n\nsubjected and the source of any direction under which the acts\n\ntook place.        If disputed facts are “inextricably intertwined”\n\nwith the facts underlying the merits of the plaintiffs’ claims,\n\nthe district court should resolve these disputed jurisdictional\n\nfacts along with the intertwined merits issues.                         See Kerns, 585\n\nF.3d at 193.\n\n                                             C.\n\n       Distinct    from        its    holding      of     non-justiciability              under\n\nTaylor, the district court separately concluded under the second\n\nBaker    factor    that    the       case    lacked      manageable       standards        for\n\njudicial     resolution        of    the    plaintiffs’         claims.           The    court\n\nemphasized     that      its    general      lack       of   expertise       in     applying\n\ninternational      law,        and    the     difficulty        of    determining          the\n\nconstraints of such law, also rendered the case non-justiciable.\n\nWe disagree with the district court’s conclusion.\n\n       Unlike in negligence cases calling into question military\n\nstandards of conduct, the district court in the present case is\n\ncalled     upon    to     interpret         statutory        terms    and     established\n\ninternational norms to resolve the issues presented by the ATS\n\nclaims.

For\n\nexample, despite repeated judicial application of torture laws,\n\nsee ante at 30, the precise legal scope of the prohibition on\n\ntorture is not perfectly defined.                     There is, in other words,\n\nconduct     for     which   the    judiciary      has    yet    to   determine       the\n\nlawfulness:       loosely, a grey area.\n\n      But    this    greyness      does   not    render      close   torture     cases\n\nnonjusticiable merely because the alleged torturer was part of\n\nthe executive branch.

The    same   is    true    for    any    other    applicable      legal\n\nprohibition.          The    fact    that       the     President--let       alone    a\n\nsignificantly       inferior      executive     officer--opines       that    certain\n\nconduct is lawful does not determine the actual lawfulness of\n\nthat conduct.
